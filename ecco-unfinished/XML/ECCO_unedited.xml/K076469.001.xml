<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE, ESQ</HEAD>
<P>A GREAT part of the poetic works of Mr. SHENSTONE, particularly his Elegies and Pastorals, are (as he himself expresses it) "The exact transcripts of the situation of his own mind;" and abound in frequent allusions to his own place, the beautiful scene of his retirement from the world. Exclusively therefore of our natural curiosity to be acquainted with the history of an author, whose works we peruse with pleasure, some short account of Mr. SHENSTONE's personal character, and situ∣ation in life, may not only be agreeable, but abso∣lutely necessary to the reader; as it is impossible he should enter into the true spirit of his writings, if he is entirely ignorant of those circumstances of his life, which sometimes so greatly influences his reflection.</P>
<P>I could wish however that this task had been al∣lotted to some person capable of performing it in that masterly manner which the subject so well de∣serves. To confess the truth, it was chiefly to pre∣vent his remains from falling into the hands of any one still less qualified to do him justice, that I have unwillingly ventured to undertake the publication of them myself.</P>
<P>Mr. SHENSTONE was the eldest son of a plain uneducated country gentleman in Shropshire, who farmed his own estate. The father, sensible of his son's extraordinary capacity, resolved to give him a learned education, and sent him a commoner to Pembroke College in Oxford, designing him for
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
the church: but though he had the most awful no∣tions of the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, he never could be persuaded to enter into orders. In his private opinions he adhered to no particular sect, and hated all religious disputes. But what∣ever were his own sentiments, he always shewed great tenderness to those who differed from him. Tenderness, indeed, in every sense of the word, was his peculiar characteristic; his friends, his do∣mestics, his poor neighbours, all daily experienced his benevolent turn of mind. Indeed, this virtue in him was often carried to such excess, that it some∣times bordered upon weakness: yet if he was con∣vinced that any of those ranked amongst the num∣ber of his friends, had treated him ungenerously, he was not easily reconciled. He used a maxim, however, on such occasions, which is worthy of being observed and imitated; "I never (said he) will be a revengeful enemy; but I cannot, it is not in my nature, to be half a friend." He was in his temper quite unsuspicious; but if suspicion was once awakened in him, it was not laid asleep again without difficulty.</P>
<P>He was no oeconomist; the generosity of his temper prevented him from paying a proper re∣gard to the use of money: he exceeded therefore the bounds of his paternal fortune, which before he died was considerably encumbered. But when one recollects the perfect paradise he had raised around him, the hospitality with which he lived, his great indulgence to his servants, his charities to the in∣digent, and all done with an estate not more than three hundred pounds a year, one should rather be led to wonder that he left any thing behind him, than to blame his want of oeconomy. He left how∣ever more than sufficient to pay all his debts; and by his will appropriated his whole for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6"/>
It was perhaps from some considerations on the narrowness of his fortune, that he forbore to mar∣ry; for he was no enemy to wedlock, had a high opinion of many among the fair sex, was fond of their society, and no stranger to the tenderest im∣pressions. One, which he received in his youth, was with difficulty surmounted. The lady was the subject of that sweet pastoral, in four parts, which has been so universally admired; and which, one would have thought, must have subdued the loftiest heart, and softened the most obdurate.</P>
<P>His person, as to height, was above the middle stature, but largely and rather inelegantly formed: his face seemed plain till you conversed with him, and then it grew very pleasing. In his dress he was negligent, even to a fault; though when young, at the university, he was accounted a Beau. He wore his own hair, which was quite grey very early, in a particular manner; not from any affectation of singularity, but from a maxim he had laid down that without too slavish a regard to fashion, every one should dress in a manner most suitable to his own person and figure. In short, his faults were only little blemishes, thrown in by nature, as it were on purpose to prevent him from rising too much above the level of imperfection allotted to humanity.</P>
<P>His character as a writer will be distinguished by simplicity with elegance, and genius with correct∣ness. He had a sublimity equal to the highest at∣tempts; yet from the indolence of his temper, he chose rather to amuse himself <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n culling flowers at the foot of the mount, than to take the trouble of climbing the more arduous steeps of Parnassus. But whenever he was disposed to rise, his steps, though natural, were noble, and always well sup∣ported. In the tenderness of elegiac poetry he hath not been excelled; in the simplicity of pastoral, one
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
may venture to say he had very few equals. Of great sensibility himself, he never failed to engage the hearts of his readers: and amidst the nicest at∣tention to the harmony of his numbers, he always took care to express with propriety the sentiments of an elegant mind. In all his writings, his greatest difficulty was to please himself. <Q>I remember a pas∣sage in one of his letters, where, speaking of his love songs, he says—“Some were written on oc∣casions a good deal imaginary, others not so; and the reason there are so many is, that I wanted to write one good song, and could never please myself.”</Q> It was this diffidence which occasioned him to throw aside many of his pieces before he had bestowed upon them his last touches. I have sup∣pressed several on this account; and if among those which I have selected, there should be discovered some little want of his finishing polish, I hope it will be attributed to this cause, and of course be excused: yet I flatter myself there will always ap∣pear something well worthy of having been pre∣served. And though I was afraid of inserting what might injure the character of my friend, yet as the sketches of a great master are always valuable, I was unwilling the public should lose any thing material of so accomplished a writer. In this di∣lemma it will easily be conceived that the task I had to perform would become somewhat difficult. How I have acquitted myself, the public must judge. Nothing, however, except what he had al∣ready published, has been admitted without the ad∣vice of his most judicious friends, nothing altered, without their particular concurrence. It is impos∣sible to please every one; but it is hoped that no reader will be so unreasonable, as to imagine that the author wrote solely for his amusement: his talents were various; and though it may perhaps
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
be allowed that his excellence chiefly appeared in subjects of tenderness and simplicity, yet he fre∣quently condescended to trifle with those of humour and drollery: these, indeed, he himself in some measure degraded by the title which he gave them of Levites; but had they been entirely rejected, the public would have been deprived of some Jeux d'esprits, excellent in their kind, and Mr. SHEN∣STONE's character as a writer would have been but imperfectly exhibited.</P>
<P>But the talents of Mr. SHENSTONE were not confined merely to poetry; his character, as a man of clear judgement, and deep penetration, will best appear from his prose works. It is there we must search for the acuteness of his understanding, and his profound knowledge of the human heart. It is to be lamented indeed, that some things here are unfinished, and can be regarded only as fragments: many are left as single thoughts, but which, like the sparks of diamonds, shew the richness of the mine to which they belong; or like the foot of a Hercules, discover the uncommon strength, and ex∣traordinary dimensions of that hero. I have no apprehension of incurring blame from any one, for preserving these valuable remains: they will dis∣cover to every reader, the author's sentiments on several important subjects. And there can be very few, to whom they will not impart many thoughts, which they would never perhaps have been able to draw from the source of their own reflections.</P>
<P>But I believe little need be said to recommend the writings of this gentleman to public attention. His character is already sufficiently established. And if he be not injured by the inability of his editor, but there is no doubt he will ever maintain an eminent station among the best of our English writers.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAYS ON MEN AND MANNERS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On Publications.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unamusing to consider the several apologies that people make when they commence authors. It is taken for granted that, on every publication, there is at least a seeming violation of modesty; a presump∣tion, on the writer's side, that he is able to instruct or to entertain the world; which implies a supposition that he can communicate, what they cannot draw from their own reflections.</P>
<P>To remove any prejudice this might occasion, has been the general intent of prefaces. Some we find ex∣tremely solicitous to claim acquaintance with their reader; addressing him by the most tender and endearing appellations. He is in general styled the most loving, candid, and courteous creature that ever breathed; with a view, doubtless, that he will deserve the compliment; and that his favour may be secured at the expence of his better judgement. Mean and idle expectation! The accidental elopements and adventures of a composition; the danger of an imperfect and surreptitious publica∣tion; the pressing and indiscreet instances of friends;
<PB N="2" REF="11" MS="y"/>
the pious and well-meant frauds of acquaintance; with the irresistible commands of persons in high life; have been excuses often substituted in place of the real motives, vanity and hunger.</P>
<P>The most allowable reasons for appearing thus in public are, either the advantage or amusement of our fellow-creatures, or our own private emolument and re∣putation.</P>
<P>A man possessed off intellectual talents would be more blamable in confining them to his own private use, than the mean-spirited miser, that did the same by his money. The latter is indeed obliged to bid adieu to what he communicates! the former enjoys his treasures, even while he renders others the better for them. A composition that enters the world with a view of im∣proving or amusing it (I mean only, amusing it in a po∣lite or innocent way) has a claim to our utmost indulg∣ence, even though it fail of the effect intended.</P>
<P>When a writer's private interest appears the motive of his publication, the reader has a larger scope for ac∣cusation, if he be a sufferer. Whoever pays for thoughts, which this kind of writers may be said to vend, has room enough to complain, if he be disap∣pointed of his bargain. He has no revenge, but ridi∣cule; and, contrary to the practice in other cases, to make the worst of a bad bargain.</P>
<P>When the love of fame acts upon a man of genius the case appears to stand thus. The generality of the world, distinguished by the name of readers, observe with a reluctance not unnatural, a person raising himself above them. All men have some desire of fame, and fame is grounded on comparison. Every one then is somewhat inclined to dispute his title to a superiority; and to disallow his pretensions upon the discovery of a flaw. Indeed, a fine writer, like a luminous body, may be beneficial to the person he enlightens; but it is plain, he renders the capacity of the other more discern∣ible.—Examination, however, is a sort of turnpike in the way to fame, where, though a writer be a while detained, and part with a trifle from his pocket, he
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
finds in his return a more commodious and easy road to the temple.</P>
<P>When therefore, a man is conscious of ability to serve his country, or believes himself possessed of it (for there is no previous test on this occasion) he has no room to hesitate, or need to make apology—When self-interest inclines a man to print, he should consider that the purchaser expects a penny-worth for his penny; and has reason to asperse his honesty if he finds himself deceived—Also, that it is possible to publish a book of no value, which is too frequently the product of such mercenary people.—When fame is the principal object of our devotion, it should be considered whether our character is like to gain in point of wit, what it will probably lose in point of modesty: otherwise, we shall be censured of vanity more than famed for genius; and depress our character while we strive to raise it.</P>
<P>After all, there is a propensity in some to communi∣cate their thoughts without any view at all: the more sanguine of these employ the press; the less lively are contented with being impertinent in conversation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On the Test of Popular Opinion.</HEAD>
<P>I HAPPEN to fall into company with a citizen, a courtier, and an academic.</P>
<P>Says the citizen, I am told continually of taste, re∣finement and politeness; but methinks the vulgar and illiterate generally approve the same productions with the connoisseurs. One rarely finds a landscape, a build∣ing, or a play, that has charms for the critic exclusive of the mechanic. But, on the other hand, one readily remarks students who labour to be dull, depraving their native relish by the very means they use to refine it. The vulgar may not indeed be capable of giving the reasons why a composition pleases them. That mecha∣nical distinction they leave to the connoisseur. But they are at all times, methinks, judges of the beauty of an
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
effect, a part of knowledge in most respects allowedly more genteel than that of the operator.</P>
<P>Says the courtier, I cannot answer for every indivi∣dual instance: but I think, moderately speaking, the vulgar are generally in the wrong. If they happen to be otherwise, it is principally owing to their implicit re∣liance on the skill of their superiors: and this has some∣times been strangely effectual in making them imagine they relish perfection. In short, if ever they judge well, it is at the time they least presume to frame opinions for themselves.</P>
<P>It is true they will pretend to taste an object which they know their betters do. But then they consider some person's judgement as a certain standard or rule; they find the object exactly tally; and this demonstrated appearance of beauty affords them some small degree of satisfaction.</P>
<P>It is the same with regard to the appetite, from which the metaphor of taste is borrowed. <Q>“Such a soup or olio, say they, is much in vogue; and if you do not like it, you must learn to like it.”</Q></P>
<P>But in poetry, for instance, it is urged that the vul∣gar discover the same beauties with the man of reading.</P>
<P>Now half or more of the beauties of poetry depend on metaphor or allusion, neither of which, by a mind un∣cultivated, can be applied to their proper counterparts. Their beauty, of consequence, is like a picture to a blind man.</P>
<P>How many of these peculiarities in poetry turn upon a knowledge of philosophy and history: and let me add, these latent beauties give the most delight to such as can unfold them.</P>
<P>I might launch out much farther in regard to the nar∣row limits of their apprehensions—What I have said may exclude their infallibility; and it is my opinion they are seldom right.</P>
<P>The academic spoke little, but to the purpose; assert∣ing that all ranks and stations have their different spheres of judging: that a clown of native taste enough to relish Handel's Messiah, might unquestionably be so
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
instructed as to relish it yet more: that an author, be∣fore he prints, should not flatter himself with a confused expectation of pleasing both the vulgar and the polite; few things, in comparison, being capable of doing both in any great degree: that he should always measure out his plan for the size of understanding he would fit. If he can content himself with the mob, he is pretty sure of numbers for a time. If he write with more abund∣ant elegance, it may escape the organs of such readers; but he will have a chance for such applause as will more sensibly affect him. Let a writer then in his first per∣formances neglect the idea of profit, and the vulgar's applause entirely: let him address him to the judicious few, and then profit and the mob will follow. His first appearance on the stage of letters will engross the politer compliments; and his latter will partake of the irra∣tional huzza.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On allowing Merit in Others.</HEAD>
<P>A CERTAIN gentleman was expressing himself as follows:</P>
<P>I confess, I have no great taste for poetry; but, if I had, I am apt to believe I should read no other poetry than that of Mr. Pope. The rest but barely arrive at a mediocrity in their art; and, to be sure, poetry of that stamp can afford but slender pleasure.</P>
<P>I know not, says another, what may be the gentle∣man's motive to give this opinion: but I am persuaded, numbers pretend the same through mere jealousy or envy.</P>
<P>A reader considers an author, as one who lays claim to a superior genius. He is ever inclined to dispute it, because, if he happen to invalidate his title, he has at least one superior the less. Now though a man's abso∣lute merit may not depend upon the inferiority of an∣other, yet his comparative worth varies in regard to that of other people. Self-love, therefore, is ever attentive to pursue the single point of admitting no more into the
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
class of superiors, than it is impossible to exclude. Could it even limit the number to one, they would soon attempt to undermine him. Even Mr. Pope had been re∣fused his honours, but that the very constraint, and even absurdity, of people's shutting their eyes grew as disa∣greeable to them, as that excellence, which, when open, they could not but discover.</P>
<P>But self-love obtains it's wishes in another respect also. It hereby not only depresses the characters of many that have wrote, but stifles the genius of such as might hereafter rise from amongst our inferiors.</P>
<P>Let us not deny to Mr. Pope the praises which a person enamoured of poetry would bestow on one that excelled in it: but let us consider Parnassus rather as a republic than a monarchy; where, although some may be in possession of a more cultivated spot, yet others may possess land as fruitful, upon equal cultiva∣tion.</P>
<P>On the whole, let us reflect, that the nature of the soil, and the extent of its fertility, must remain undis∣covered, if the gentleman's desponding principle should meet with approbation.</P>
<P>Mr. Pope's chief excellence lies in what I would term consolidating or condensing sentences, yet preserving ease and perspecuity. In smoothness of verse, perhaps, he has been equalled: in regard to invention, excelled.</P>
<P>Add to this, if the writers of antiquity may be es∣teemed our truest models, Mr. Pope is much more witty, and less simple, than his own Horace appears in any of his writings. More witty, and less simple, than the modern Monsieur Boileau, who claimed the merit of uniting the style of Juvenal and Persius with that of Horace.</P>
<P>Satire gratifies self-love. This was one source of his popularity; and he seems even so very conscious of it as to stigmatize many inoffensive characters.</P>
<P>The circumstance of what is called alliteration and the nice adjustment of the pause, have conspired t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charm the present age, but have at the same time give<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his verses a very cloying peculiarity.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="16"/>
But, perhaps, we must not expect to trace the flow of Waller, the landscape of Thomson, the fire of Dryden, the imagery of Shakespear, the simplicity of Spenser, the courtliness of Prior, the humour of Swift, the wit of Cowley, the delicacy of Addison, the tenderness of Otway, and the invention, the spirit, and sublimity of Milton, joined in any single writer. The lovers of poetry, therefore, should allow some praise to those who shine in any branch of it, and only range them into classes according to that species in which they shine.</P>
<Q>"Quare agite, O juvenes!"</Q>
<P>Banish the self-debasing principle, and scorn the disinge∣nuity of readers. Humility has depressed many a genius into an hermit; but never yet raised one into a poet of eminence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The Impromptu.</HEAD>
<P>THE critics, however unable to fix the time which it is most proper to allow for the action of an epic poem, have universally agreed that some certain space is not to be exceeded. Concerning this, Aristotle, their great Lycurgus, is entirely silent. Succeeding critics have done little more than cavil concerning the time really taken up by the greatest epic writers: that, if they could not frame a law, they might at least establish a precedent of unexceptionable authority. Homer, say they, confined the action of his Iliad, or rather his ac∣tion may be reduced, to the space of two months. His Odyssey, according to Bossu and Dacier, is extended to eight years. Virgil's Aeneid has raised very different opinions in his commentators. Tasso's poem includes a summer—But leaving such knotty points to persons that appear born for the discussion of them, let us endeavour to establish laws that are more likely to be obeyed, than controverted. An epic writer, though limited in regard to the time of his action, is under no sort of restraint
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
with regard to the time he takes to finish his poem. Far different is the case with a writer of Impromptu's. He indeed is allowed all the liberties that he can possibly take in his composition, but is rigidly circumscribed with re∣gard to the space in which it is completed. And no wonder; for whatever degree of poignancy may be required in this composition, it's peculiar merit must ever be relative to the expedition with which it is pro∣duced.</P>
<P>It appears indeed to me to have the nature of that kind of sallad, which certain eminent adepts in chemis∣try have contrived to raise, while a joint of mutton is roasting. We do not allow ourselves to blame it's un∣usual flatness and insipidity, but extol the flavour it has, considering the time of it's vegetation.</P>
<P>An extemporaneous poet, therefore, is to be judged as we judge a race-horse; not by the gracefulness of his motion, but the time he takes to finish his course. The best critic upon earth may err in determining his precise degree of merit, if he have neither a stop-watch in his hand, nor a clock within his hearing.</P>
<P>To be a little more serious. An extemporaneous piece ought to be examined by a compound ratio, or a medium compounded of it's real worth, and the short∣ness of the time that is employed in it's production. By this rule, even Virgil's poem may be in some sort deemed extemporaneous, as the time he took to perfect so extraordinary a composition, considered with it's real worth, appears shorter than the time employed to write the distics of Cosconius.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I cannot allow this title to the flashes of my friend S—in the magazine, which have no sort of claim to be called verses, besides their instantaneity.</P>
<P>Having ever made it my ambition to see my writings distinguished for something poignant, unexpected, or, in some respects, peculiar; I have acquired a degree of fame by a firm adherence to the Concetti. I have stung folks with my epigrams, amused them with acrostics, puzzled them with rebusses, and distracted them with
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
riddles. It remained only for me to succeed in the Im∣promptu, for which I was utterly disqualified by a whoreson slowness of apprehension.</P>
<P>Still desirous, however, of the immortal honour to grow distinguished for an extempore; I petitioned Apollo to that purpose in a dream. His answer was as follows. <Q>“That whatever piece of wit, either written or verbal, makes any pretence to merit, as of extemporaneous production, shall be said or written within the time that the author supports himself on one leg. That Horace had explained his meaning, by the phrase stans pede in uno. And forasmuch as one man may persevere in the posture longer than another, he would recommend it to all candidates for this extraordinary accomplishment, that they would habituate themselves to study in no other attitude whatsoever,”</Q></P>
<P>Methought I received his answer with the utmost plea∣sure as well as veneration; hoping, that, however I was debarred of the acumen requisite for an extempore, I might learn to weary out my betters in standing on one leg.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>An Humourist.</HEAD>
<P>TO form an estimate of the proportion which one man's happiness bears to another's we are to con∣sider the mind that is allotted him with as much atten∣tion as the circumstances. It were superfluous to evince that the same objects which one despises, are frequently to another the substantial source of admiration. The man of business and the man of pleasure are to each other mutually contemptible; and a blue garter has less charms for some, than they can discover in a butterfly. The more candid and sage observer condemns neither for his pursuits, but for the derision he so profusely lavishes upon the disposition of his neighbour. He concludes that schemes infinitely various were at first intended for our pursuit and pleasure; and that some find their ac∣count
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
in heading a cry of hounds, as much as others in the dignity of lord chief-justice.</P>
<P>Having premised thus much, I proceed to give some account of a character which came within the sphere of my own observation.</P>
<P>Not the entrance of a cathedral, not the found of a passing bell, not the furs of a magistrate, nor the fa∣bles of a funeral, were fraught with half the solemnity of face!</P>
<P>Nay so wonderfully serious was he observed to be on all occasions, that it was found hardly possible to be otherwise in his company. He quashed the loudest tem∣pest of laughter, whenever he entered the room; and men's features, though ever so much roughened, were sure to grow smooth at his approach.</P>
<P>The man had nothing vicious, or even ill-natured in his character; yet he was the dread of all jovial conver∣sation; the young, the gay, found their spirits fly be∣fore him. Even the kitten and the puppy, as it were by instinct, would forego their frolics, and be still. The depression he occasioned was like that of a damp, or vitiated air. Unconscious of any apparent cause, you found your spirits sink insensibly: and were any one to sit for the picture of ill-luck it is not possible the painter could select a more proper person.</P>
<P>Yet he did not fail to boast of a superior share of reason, even for the want of that very faculty, risibility, with which it is supposed to be always joined.</P>
<P>Indeed he acquired the character of the most ingenious person of his county, from this meditative temper. Not that he had ever made any great discovery of his talents; but a few oracular declarations, joined with a common opinion that he was writing somewhat for pos∣terity, completed his reputation.</P>
<P>Numbers would have willingly depreciated his charac∣ter, had not his known sobriety and reputed sense deterred them.</P>
<P>He was one day overheard at his devotions, return∣ing his most fervent thanks for some particularities in his
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
situation, which the generality of mankind would have but little regarded.</P>
<P>Accept, said he, the gratitude of thy most humble, yet most happy creature, not for silver or gold, the tin∣sel of mankind, but for those amiable peculiarities which thou hast so graciously interwoven both with my fortune and my complexion: for those treasures so well adapted to that frame of mind thou hast assigned me.</P>
<P>That the surname which has descended to me is liable to no pun.</P>
<P>That it runs chiefly upon vowels and liquids.</P>
<P>That I have a picturesque countenance rather than one that is esteemed of regular features.</P>
<P>That there is an intermediate hill, intercepting my view of a nobleman's seat, whose ill-obtained superiority I cannot bear to recollect.</P>
<P>That my estate is over-run with brambles, reso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds with cataracts, and is beautifully varied with rocks and precipices, rather than an even cultivated spot, fertile of corn, or wine, or oil; or those kinds of productions in which the sons of men delight themselves.</P>
<P>That as thou dividest thy bounties impartially; giv∣ing riches to one, and the contempt of riches to an∣other, so thou hast given me, in the midst of poverty, to despise the insolence of riches, and by declining all emulation that is founded upon wealth, to maintain the dignity and superiority of the Muses.</P>
<P>That I have a disposition either so elevated or so in∣genuous, that I can derive to myself amusement from the very expedients and contrivances with which rigor∣ous necessity furnishes my invention.</P>
<P>That I can laugh at my own follies, foibles, and in∣firmities; and that I do not want infirmities to employ this disposition.</P>
<P>This poor gentleman caught cold one winter's night, as he was contemplating, by the side of a crystal stream, by moonshine. This afterwards terminated in a sever that was fatal to him.

<HEAD><HI>The Hermit.</HI> (In the manner of Cambray.)</HEAD>
<P>IT was in that delightful month which Love pre∣fers before all others, and which most reveres this deity: that month which ever weaves a verdant carpet for the earth, and embroiders it with flowers. The banks became inviting through their coverlets of moss; the violets, refreshed by the moisture of descend∣ing rains, enriched the tepid air with their agreeable perfumes. But the shower was past; the sun dispersed the vapours; and the sky was clear and lucid, when Po∣lydore walked forth. He was of a complexion alto∣gether plain and unaffected; a lover of the Muses, and beloved by them. He would oftentimes retire from the noise of mixed conversation, to enjoy the melody of birds, or the murmurs of a water-fall. His neighbours often smiled at his peculiarity of temper; and he no less, at the vulgar cast of theirs. He could never be content to pass his irrevocable time in an idle comment upon a newspaper, or in adjusting the precise difference of temperature betwixt the weather of to-day and yes∣terday.
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
In short he was not void of some ambition, but what he felt he acknowledged, and was never averse to vindicate. As he never censured any one who indulg∣ed their humour inoffensively, so he claimed no manner of applause for those pursuits which gratified his own. But the sentiments he entertained of honour, and the dig∣nity conferred by royal authority, made it wonderful how he bore the thoughts of obscurity and oblivion. He mentioned with applause the youths who by merit had arrived at station; but he thought that all should in life's visit leave some token of their existence; and that their friends might more reasonably expect it from them, than they from their posterity.</P>
<P>There were few, he thought, of talents so very incon∣siderable, as to be unalterably excluded from all degrees of fame: and in regard to such as had a liberal educa∣tion, he ever wished that in some art or science they would be persuaded to engrave their names. He thought it might be some pleasure to reflect, that their names would at least be honoured by their descendants, al∣though they might escape the notice of such as were not prejudiced in their favour.</P>
<P>What a lustre, said he, does the reputation of a Wren, a Waller, or a Walsingham, cast upon their re∣motest progeny? and who would not wish rather to be descended from them, than from the mere carcase of no∣bility? Yet wherever superb titles are faithfully offered as the reward of merit, he thought the allurements of ambition were too transporting to be resisted. But to return.</P>
<P>Polydore, a new inhabitant in a sort of wild, un∣inhabited country, was now ascended to the top of a mountain, and in the full enjoyment of a very exten∣sive prospect. Before him a broad and winding valley, variegated with all the charms of landscape. Fertile meadows, glittering streams, pendent rocks, and nod∣ding ruins. But these indeed were much less thes ob∣jects of his attention, than those distant hills and spire that were almost concealed by one undistinguished azure. The sea, indeed, appeared to close the scene, though
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
distant as it was it but little variegated the view. Hardly indeed were it distinguishable but for the beams of a descending sun, which at the same time warned our traveller to return, before the duskiness and dews of evening had rendered his walk uncomfortable.</P>
<P>He had now descended to the foot of the mountain, when he remarked an old hermit approaching to a little hut, which he had formed with his own hands, at the very bottom of the precipice. Polydore, all enamoured of the beauties he had been surveying, could not avoid wondering at his conduct, who, not content with shun∣ning all commerce with mankind, had contrived as much as possible to exclude all views of nature. He accosted him in the manner following. Father, says he, it is with no small surprise, that I observe your choice of situation, by which you seem to neglect the most dis∣tant and delightful landscape that ever my eyes beheld. The hill, beneath which you have contrived to hide your habitation, would have afforded you such a variety of natural curiosities, as to a person so contemplative, must appear highly entertaining: and as the cell to which you are advancing is seemingly of your own con∣trivance, methinks it was probable you would so have placed it, as to present them, in all their beauty, to your eye.</P>
<P>The hermit made him this answer. My son, says he, the evening approaches, and you have deviated from your way. I would not therefore detain you by my story, did I not imagine the moon would prove a safer guide to you, than that setting sun which you must otherwise rely upon. Enter therefore for a while into my cave, and I will give you then some account of my adventures, which will solve you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doubts perhaps more effectually than any method I can propose. But before you enter my lone abode, calculated only for the use of meditation, dare to contemn superfluous magnificence, and render thyself worthy of the being I contemplate.</P>
<P>Know then, that I owe what the world is pleased to call my ruin (and indeed justly, were it not for the use whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h I have made of it) to an assured dependence, in a
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
literal sense, upon confused and distant prospects: a con∣fideration, which hath indeed so affected me, that I shall never henceforth enjoy a landscape that lies at so re∣mote a distance, as not to exhibit all its parts. And indeed were I to form the least pretensions to what your world calls taste, I might even then perhaps contend that a well-discriminated landscape was at all times to be preferred to a distant and promiscuous azure.</P>
<P>I was born in the parish of a nobleman who arrived to the principal management of the business of the na∣tion. The heir of his family and myself were of the same age, and for some time school fellows. I had made considerable advances in his esteem; and the mu∣tual affection we entertained for each other, did not long remain unobserved by his family or my own. He was sent early upon his travels pursuant to a very inju∣dicious custom, and my parents were solicited to con∣sent that I might accompany him. Intimations were given to my friends, that a person of such importance as his father might contribute much more to my immediate promotion, than the utmost diligence I could use in pur∣suit of it. My father, I remember, assented with re∣luctance: my mother, fired with the ambition of her son's future greatness, through much importunity, "wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng from him his slow leave." I, for my own part, wanted no great persuasion. We made what is called the great tour of Europe. We neither of us, I believe, could be said to want natural sense; but being banished so early in life, were more attentive to every de∣viation from our own indifferent customs, than to any useful examination of their polices or manners. Judge∣ment, for the most part, ripens very slowly. Fancy often expands her blossoms all at once.</P>
<P>We were now returning home from a six year's ab∣sence: anticipating the caresses of our parents and rela∣tions, when my ever-honoured companion was attacked by a fever. All possible means of safety proving finally ineffectual, he accosted me in one of his lucid intervals as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="25"/>
Alas! my Clytander! my life, they tell me, is of very short continuance. The next paroxysm of my fever will probably be conclusive.</P>
<P>The prospect of this sudden change does not allow me to speak the gratitude I owe thee; much less to reward the kindness on which it is so justly grounded. Thou knowest I was sent away yearly from my parents, and the more rational part of my life has been passed with thee alone. It cannot be but they will prove solicitous in their enquiries concerning me. Thy narrative will awake their tenderness, and they cannot but conceive some for their son's companion and his friend. What I would hope is, that they will render thee some services, in place of those their beloved son intended thee, and which I can unfeignedly assert, would have been only bounded by my power. My dear companion! farewell. All other temporal enjoyments have I banished from my heart; but friendship lingers long, and 'tis with tears I say farewell.—</P>
<P>My concern was truly so great, that, upon my arrival in my native country, it was not at all encreased by the consideration that the nobleman, on whom my hopes de∣pended, was removed from all his places. I waited on him; and he appeared sensibly grieved that the friend∣ship he had ever professed could now so little avail me. He recommended me however to a friend of his that was then of the successful party, and who, he was as∣sured, would, at his request, assist me to the utmost of his power. I was now in the prime of life, which I ef∣fectually consumed upon the empty forms of our court-attendance. Hopes arose before me like bubbles upon a stream; as quick succeeding one another, as superfi∣cial and as vain. Thus busied in my pursuit, and re∣jecting the assistance of cool examination, I found the winter of life approaching, and nothing procured to shelter or protect me when my second patron died. A race of new ones appeard before me, and even yet kept my expectations in play. I wished indeed I had retreat∣ed sooner; but to retire at last unrecompenced, and
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
when a few months attendance might happen to prove successful, was beyond all power of resolution.</P>
<P>However, after a few years more attendance, distri∣buted in equal proportions upon each of these new pa∣trons, I at length obtained a place of much trouble and small emolument. On the acceptance of this, my eyes seemed open all at once. I had no passion remaining for the splendor which was grown familiar to me, and for civi∣lity and confinement I entertained an utter aversion. I officiated however for a few weeks in my post, wonder∣ing still more and more how I could ever covet the life I led. I was ever most sincere, but sincerity clashed with my situation every moment of the day. In short, I returned home to a paternal income, not indeed intend∣ing that austere life in which you at present find me en∣gaged. I thought to content myself with common ne∣cessaries, and to give the rest, if aught remained, to cha∣rity; determined, however, to avoid all appearance of singularity. But alas! to my great surprize, the person who supplied my expences had so far embroiled my lit∣tle affairs, that, when my debts, &amp;c. were discharged, I was unable to subsist in any better manner than I do at present. I grew at first entirely melancholy; left the country where I was born, and raised the humble roof that covers me in a country where I am not known. I now begin to think myself happy in my present way of life: I cultivate a few vegetables to support me; and the little well there, is a very clear one. I am now an useless individual; little able to benefit mankind; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prey to shame, and to confusion, on the first glance of every eye that knows me. My spirits are indeed something raised by a clear sky, or a meridian sun; but as to extensive views of the country, I think them well enough exchanged for the warmth and comfort which this vale affords me. Ease is at least the proper ambition of age, and it is confessedly my supreme one.</P>

<HEAD>On Distinctions, Orders, and Dignities.</HEAD>
<P>THE subject turned upon the nature of societies, ranks, orders, and distinctions, amongst men.</P>
<P>A gentleman of spirit, and of the popular faction, had been long declaiming against any kind of honours that tended to elevate a body of people into a distinct species from the rest of the nation. Particularly titles and blue ribbands were the object of his indignation. They were, as he pretended, too invidious an ostentation of su∣periority, to be allowed in any nation that stiled itself free. Much was said upon the subject of appearances, so far as they were countenanced by law or custom. The bi∣shop's lawn; the marshal's truncheon; the baron's robe; and the judge's peruke, were considered only as necessary substitutes, where genuine purity, real cou∣rage, native dignity, and suitable penetration, were wanting to complete the characters of those to whom they were assigned.</P>
<P>It was urged that policy had often effectually made it a point to dazzle in order to enslave; and instances were brought of groundless distinctions borne about in the glare of day by certain persons, who, being stripped of them, would be less esteemed than the meanest plebeian.</P>
<P>He acknowledged, indeed, that kings, the fountains of all political honour, had hitherto shewn no complai∣sance to that sex whose softer dispositions rendered them more excusably fond of such peculiarities.</P>
<P>That, in favour of the ladies, he should esteem himself sufficiently happy in the honour of inventing one order, which should be styled, The powerful order of beauties.</P>
<P>That their number in Great Britain should be limit∣ed to five thousand; the dignity for ever to be conferred
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
by the queen alone, who should be styled sovereign of the order, and the rest the companions.</P>
<P>That the instalment should be rendered a thousand times more ceremonious, the dresses more superb, and the plumes more enormous, than those already in use amongst the companions of the garter.</P>
<P>That the distinguishing badge of this order should be an artificial nosegay, to be worn on the left breast; con∣sisting of a lily and a rose, the proper emblems of com∣plexion, and intermixed with a branch of myrtle, the tree sacred to Venus.</P>
<P>That instead of their shields being affixed to the stalls appointed for this order, there should be a gallery erect∣ed to receive their pictures at full length. Their por∣traits to be taken by four painters of the greatest emi∣nence, and he whose painting was preferred, to be styled A knight of the rose and lily.</P>
<P>That when any person addressed a letter to a lady of this order, the style should always be To the Right beau∣tiful Miss or Lady such-a-one.</P>
<P>He seemed for some time undetermined whether they should forfeit their title upon marriage; but at length, for many reasons, proposed it should be continued to them.</P>
<P>And thus far the gentleman proceeded in his ha∣rangue; when it was objected that the queen, unless she unaccountably chose to mark out game for her husband, could take no sort of pleasure in conferring this honour where it was most due: That as ladies grew in years, this epithet of beautiful would burlesque them; and, in short, considering the frailty of beauty, there was no lasting compliment that could be bestowed upon it.</P>
<P>At this the orator smiled; and acknowledged it was true: But asked at the same time, why it was more ab∣surd to style a lady right beautiful, in the days of her de∣formity, than to term a peer right honourable when he grew a scandal to mankind?</P>
<P>That this was some times the case, he said, was not to be disputed; because titles have been sometimes granted to a worthless son, in consequence of a father's enormous
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
wealth most unjustly acquired. And few had ever surpassed in villainy the right honourable the earl of A—.</P>
<P>The company was a little surprised at the sophistry of our declaimant. However, it was replied to, by a per∣son present, that Lord—'s title being fictitious, no one ought to instance him to the disadvantage of the p—rage, who had, strictly speaking, never been of that number.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>On the same Subject.</HEAD>
<P>THE declaiment, I before mentioned, continued his harangue. There are, said he, certain epithets which so frequently occur, that they are the less considered; and which are seldom or never examined, on account of the many opportunities of examination that present themselves.</P>
<P>Of this kind is the word Gentleman. This word, on it's first introduction, was given, I suppose, to freemen, in opposition to vassals; these being the two classes into which the nation was once divided <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the author is not writing a treatise on the feudal law, but a moral essay; any little inaccuracies, it is to be hoped, will be over-looked by those, who, from several late trei∣tises on this subject, might expect great exactness and preci∣sion in a serious discussion of this point.</NOTE>. The freeman was he, who was possessed of land, and could therefore subsist without manual labour; the vassal, he who tenant∣ed the land, and was obliged to his thane for the neces∣saries of life. The different manners, we may presume, that sprung from their different situations and con∣nexions, occasioned the one to be denominated a civilized or gentle personage; and the other to obtain the name of a mere rustic or villain.</P>
<P>But upon the publication of crusades, the state of things was considerably altered: It was then that every
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
freeman distinguished the shield which he wore with some painted emblem or device; and this, in order that his fellow-combatants might attribute to him his pro∣per applause, which, upon account of similar accoutre∣ments, might be otherwise subject to misapplication.</P>
<P>Upon this there arose a distinction betwixt freeman and freeman. All who had served in those religious wars continued the use of their first devices, but all de∣vices were not illustrated by the same pretensions to mi∣litary glory.</P>
<P>However, these campaigns were discontinued: fresh families sprung up; who, without any pretence to mark themselves with such devices as these holy combatants, were yet as desirous of respect, of estimation, of distinc∣tion. It would be tedious enough to trace the steps by which money establishes even absurdity. A court of heraldry sprung up, to supply the place of crusade ex∣ploits, to grant imaginary shields and trophies to fami∣lies that never wore real armour, and it is but of late that it has been discovered to have no real jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Yet custom is not at once overthrown; and he is even now deemed a gentleman who has arms recorded in the Herald's office, and at the same time follows none, except a liberal employment.</P>
<P>Allowing this distinction, it is obvious to all who consider, that a churlish, morose, illiterate clown; a lazy, beggarly, sharping vagabond; a stupid, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubberly, inactive sot, or pick-pocket, nay even an highwayman, may be nevertheless a gentleman as by law established. In short, that the definition may, together with others include also the filth, the scum, and the dregs of the cre∣ation.</P>
<P>But do we not appear to disallow this account, when we say, "such or such an action was not done in a gen∣tleman-like manner," "such usage was not the beha∣viour of a gentleman," and so forth. We seem thus to insmuate that the appellation of gentleman regards morals as well as family; and that integrity, politeness, generosity, and affability, have the truest claim to a dis∣tinction of this kind. Whence then shall we suppose
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
was derived this contradiction? Shall we say that the plebeians, having the virtues on their side, by degrees re∣moved this appellation from the basis of family to that of merit; which they esteemed, and not unjustly, to be the true and proper pedestal? This the gentry will scarce allow. Shall we then insist that every thing great and god-like was heretofore the atchievement of the gen∣try? But this, perhaps, will not obtain the approbation of the commoners.</P>
<P>To reconcile the difference, let us suppose the denomi∣nation may belong equally to two sorts of men. The one, what may be styled a gentleman de jure, viz. a man of generosity, politeness, learning, taste, genius, or affa∣bility; in short, accomplished in all that is splendid, or endeared to us by all that is amiable, on the one side: and on the other, a gentleman de facto, or what, to English readers, I would term a gentleman as by law established.</P>
<P>As to the latter appellation, what is really essential, or, as logicians would say, "quarto modo proprium," is a real, or at least a specious claim to the inheritance of certain coat-armour from a second or more distant ancestor; and this unstained by any mechanical or illi∣beral employment.</P>
<P>We may discover, on this state of the case, that, how∣ever material a difference this distinction supposes, yet it is not wholly impracticable for a gentleman de jure to render himself in some sort a gentleman de facto. A certain sum of money, deposited in the hands of my good friends Norroy or Rougedragon, will convey to him a coat of arms descending from as many ancestors as he pleases. On the other hand, the gentleman de facto may become a gentleman also de jure, by the ac∣quisition of certain virtues, which are rarely all of them unattainable. The latter, I must acknowledge, is the more difficult talk; at least we may daily discover crowds acquire sufficient wealth to buy gentility, but very few that possess the virtues which ennoble human nature, and (in the best sense of the word) constitute a gentleman.</P>

<HEAD>A Character.</HEAD>
<P>—HE was a youth so amply furnished, with every ex∣cellence of mind, that he seemed alike capable of acquiring or disregarding the goods of fortune. He had indeed all the learning and erudition that can be derived from universities, without the pedantry and ill manners which are too often their attendants. What few or none acquire by the most intense assiduity, he possessed by nature; I mean, that elegance of taste, which dis∣posed him to admire beauty under it's great variety of appearances. It passed not unobserved by him either in the cut of a sleeve, or the integrity of a moral action. The proportion of a statue, the convenience of an edifice, the movement in a dance, and the complexion of a cheek or flower, afforded him sensations of beauty; that beauty which inferior geniuses are taught coldly to dis∣tinguish; or to discern rather than feel. He could trace the excellencies both of the courtier and the student; who are matually ridiculous in the eyes of each other. He had nothing in his character that could obscure so great accomplishments, beside the want, the total want, of a desire to exhibit them. Through this it came to pass, that what would have raised another to the heights of reputation, was oftentimes in him passed over unre∣garded. For, in respect to ordinary observers, it is re∣quisite to lay some stress yourself, on what you intend should be remarked by others; and this never was his way. His knowledge of books had in some degree di∣minished his knowledge of the world; or, rather, the external forms and manners of it. His ordinary con∣versation was, perhaps, rather too pregnant with senti∣ment, the usual fault of rigid students; and this he would in some degree have regulated better, did not the universality of his genius, together with the method of his education, so largely contribute to this amiable de∣fect. This kind of awkwardness (since his modesty will allow it no better name) may be compared to the stiffness of a fine piece of brocade, whose turgescency indeed
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
constitutes, and is inseparable from, its value. He gave delight by an happy boldness in the extirpation of common prejudices; which he could as readily pene∣trate, as he could humourously ridicule: and he had such entire possession of the hearts as well as understand∣ings of his friends, that he could soon make the most surprising paradoxes believed and well-accepted. His image, like that of a sovereign, could give an addi∣tional value to the most precious ore; and we no sooner believed our eyes that it was he who spake it, than we as readily believed whatever he had to say. In this he differed from W—r, that he had the talents of ren∣dering the greatest virtues un-envied: whereas the latter shone more remarkably in making his very faults agree∣able: I mean in regard to those few he had to exercise his skill.</P>

<HEAD>On Reserve.—A Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>TAKING an evening's walk with a friend in the country, among many grave remarks, he was making the following observation. There is not, says he, any one quality so inconsistent with respect, as what is commonly called familiarity. You do not find one in fifty, whose regard is proof against it. At the same time, it is hardly possible to insist upon such a deference as will render you ridiculous, if it be supported by com∣mon sense. Thus much at least is evident, that your demands will be so successful, as to procure a greater share than if you had made no such demand. I may frankly own to you, Leander, that I frequently derived uneasiness, from a familiarity with such persons as de∣spised every thing they could obtain with ease. Were it not better, therefore, to be somewhat frugal of our af∣fability, at least to allot it only to the sew persons of
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
discernment who can make the proper distinction be∣twixt real dignity and pretended: to neglect those characters, which, being impatient to grow familiar, are at the same time very far from familiarity-proof: to have posthumous fame in view, which affords us the most pleasing landscape: to enjoy the amusement of reading, and the consciousness that reading paves the way to general esteem: to preserve a constant regularity of temper, and also of constitution, for the most part but little consistent with a promiscuous intercourse with men: to shun all illiterate, though ever so jovial assemblies, in∣sipid, perhaps, when present, and upon reflection painful: to meditate on those absent or departed friends, who value or valued us for those qualities with which they were best acquainted: to partake with such a friend as you, the delights of a studious and rational retirement—Are not these the paths that lead to happiness?</P>
<P>In answer to this (for he seemed to feel some late mor∣tification) I observed, that what we lost by familiarity in respect, was generally made up to us by the affection it procured; and that an absolute solitude was so very contrary to our natures, that were he excluded from so∣ciety but for a single fortnight, he would be exhilarated at the sight of the first beggar that he saw.</P>
<P>What follows were thoughts thrown out in our fur∣ther discourse upon the subject; without order or con∣nexion, as they occur to my remembrance.</P>
<P>Some reserve is a debt to prudence; as freedom and simplicity of conversation is a debt to good-nature.</P>
<P>There would not be any absolute necessity for reserve, if the world were honest: yet, even then, it would prove expedient. For, in order to attain any degree of defe∣rence, it seems necessary that people should imagine you have more accomplishments than you discover.</P>
<P>It is on this depends one of the excellencies of the judicious Virgil. He leaves you something ever to ima∣gine: and such is the constitution of the human mind, that we think so highly of nothing, as of that whereof we do not see the bounds. This, as Mr. Burke ingeni∣ously

<HEAD>On external Figure.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a young gentleman in my parish, who, on account of his superior equipage, is esteemed universally more proud and more haughty than his neigh∣bours. It is frequently hinted, that he is by no means intitled to so splendid an appearance, either by his birth, his station, or his fortune; and that it is of consequence mere pride that urges him to live beyond his rank, or renders him blind to the knowledge of it. With all this fondness for external splendor, he is a most affable and ingenious man; and for this reason I am inclined to vindicate him, when these things are mentioned to his disadvantage.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is by no means clear, that dress and equipage are sure signs of pride. Where it is joined with a supercilious behaviour, it becomes then a corro∣borative testimony. But this is not always the case: the refinements of luxury in equipage, or a table, are per∣haps as often the gratifications of fancy, as the conse∣quence of an ambition to surpass and ec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipse our equals. Whoever thinks that taste has nothing to do here, must confine the expression to improper limits; assuredly ima∣gination may find its account in them, wholly inde∣pendent of worldly homage and considerations more invi∣dious.</P>
<P>In the warmth of friendship for this gentleman, I am sometimes prompted to go further. I insist, it is not birth or fortune only that give a person claim to a splen∣did appearance; that it may be conferred by other quali∣fications, in which my friend is acknowledged to have a share.</P>
<P>I have sometime urged that remarkable ingenuity, any great degree of merit in learning, arts or sciences, are a more reasonable authority for a splendid appearance than those which are commonly presumed to be so. That there is something more personal in this kind of advan∣tages than in rank or fortune, will not be denied: and surely there ought to be some proportion observed be∣twixt
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
the case and the thing enclosed. The propensity of rich and worthless people to appear with a splendor upon all occasions, puts one in mind of the country shopkeeper, who gilds his boxes in order to be the re∣ceptacle of pitch or tobacco. It is not unlike the ma∣nagement at our theatres royal, where you see a piece of candle honoured with a crown.</P>
<P>I have generally considered those as privileged people, who are able to support the character they assume. Those who are incapable of shining but by dress, would do well to consider that the contrast betwixt them and their cloaths turns out much to their disadvantage. It is on this account I have sometimes observed with pleasure some noblemen of immense fortune to dress ex∣ceeding plain.</P>
<P>If dress be only allowable to persons of family, it may then be considered as a sort of family-livery, and Jack the groom may, with equal justice, pride himself upon the gaudy wardrobe his master gives him. Nay more—for a gentleman, before he hires a servant, will require some testimony of his merit; whereas the master challenges his own right to splendor, though possessed of no merit at all.</P>
<P>Upon my present scheme of dress, it may seem to an∣swer some very good purposes. It is then established on the same foundation, as the judge's robe and the pre∣late's lawn. If dress were only authorised in men of ingenuity, we should find many aiming at the previous merit, in hopes of the subsequent distinction. The finery of an empty fellow would render him as ridiculous as a star and garter would one never knighted: and men would use as commendable a diligence to qualify them∣selves for a brocaded waistcoat, or a gold snuff-box, as they now do to procure themselves a right of investing their limbs in lawn or ermine. We should not esteem a man a coxcomb for his dress, till, by frequent con∣versation, we discovered a flaw in his title. If he was incapable of uttering a bon mot, the gold upon his coat would seem foreign to his circumstances. A man should not wear a French dress, till he could give an
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
account of the best French authors; and should be versed in all the oriental languages before he should pre∣sume to wear a diamond.</P>
<P>It may be urged, that men of the greatest merit may not be able to shew it in their dress, on account of their slender income. But here it should be considered that an∣other part of the world would find their equipage so much reduced by a sumptuary law of this nature, that a very moderate degree of splendor would distinguish them more than a greater does at present.</P>
<P>What I propose, however, upon the whole is, that men of merit should be allowed to dress in proportion to it; but this with the privilege of appearing plain, whenever they found an expediency in so doing: as a nobleman lays aside his garter, when he sees no valuable consequence in the discovery of his quality.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Character.</HI> "Animae nil magnae laudis egentes."</HEAD>
<P>THERE is an order of persons in the world, whose thoughts never deviate from the common road; whatever events occur, whatever objects present them∣selves, their observations are as uniform as though they were the consequence of instinct. There is nothing places these men in a more insignificant point of light, than a comparison of their ideas with the refinements of some great genius. I shall only add, by way of reflec∣tion, that it is people of this stamp, who, together with the foundest health, often enjoy the greatest equanimity: their passions, like dull steeds, being the least apt to en∣danger or misguide them: yet such is the fatality! Men of genius are often expected to act with most dis∣cretion, on account of that very fancy which is their greatest impediment.</P>
<P>I was taking a view of Westminster-abbey, with an old gentleman of exceeding honesty, but the same degree of understanding as that I have described.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="41"/>
There had nothing passed in our way thither, beside the customary salutations, and an endeavour to decide with accuracy upon the present temperature of the wea∣ther. On passing over the threshold, he observed with an air of thoughtfulness, that it was a brave ancient place.</P>
<P>I told him, I thought there was none more suitable, to moralize upon the futility of all earthly glory, as there was none which contained the ashes of men that had acquired a greater share of it. On this he gave a nod of approbation, but did not seem to comprehend me.</P>
<P>Silence ensued for many minutes; when having had time to reflect upon the monuments of men famous in their generations, he stood collected in himself; <Q>assuring me “there was no sort of excellence could exempt a man from death.”</Q></P>
<P>I applauded the justice of his observation; and said, it was not only my present opinion, but had been so for a number of years. <Q>"Right," says he, “and for my own part I seldom love to publish my remarks upon a subject, till I have had them confirmed to me by a long course of experience.”</Q></P>
<P>This last maxim, somewhat beyond his usual depth, occasioned a silence of some few minutes. The spring had been too much bent to recover immediately it's wonted vigour. We had taken some few turns, up and down the left hand ayle, when he caught sight of a mo∣nument somewhat larger than the rest, and more calcu∣lated to make impression upon an ordinary imagination. As I remember, it was raised to an ancestor of the D. of Newcastle. <Q>"Well," says he, with an air of cun∣ning," “this is indeed a fine piece of workmanship; but I cannot conceive this finery is of any significa∣tion to the person buried there.”</Q> I told him, I thought not; and that, under a notion of respect to the deceased, people were frequently imposed upon by their own pride and affectation.</P>
<P>We were now arrived at the monument of Sir George Chamberlain; where my friend had just perused enough
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
to inform him that he was an eminent physician, when he broke out with precipitation, and as though some important discovery had struck his fancy on a sudden. I listened to him with attention, till I found him la∣bouring to insinuate that physicians themselves could not save their lives when their time was come.</P>
<P>He had not proceeded many steps from it before he beckoned to our Ciceroni. <Q>"Friend," says he; pointing with his cane, “how long has that gentleman been dead?”</Q> <Q>The man set him right in that particular; after which putting on a woeful countenance, "Well," says he, “to behold how fast time flies away! 'Tis but a small time to look back upon, since he and I” met at the Devil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A well-known tavern near Temple-Bar.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>Alas," continued he, “we shall never do so again:”</Q> indulging myself with a pun that escaped me on a sudden, I told him I hoped not; and immediately took my leave.</P>
<P>This old gentleman, as I have since heard, passed his life chiefly in the country; where it faintly participated either of pleasure or of pain. His chief delights indeed were sensual, but those of the less vigorous kind; an afternoon's pipe, an evening walk, or a nap after din∣ner. His death, which happened, it seems, quickly after, was occasioned by an uniform application to Bostock's cordial, whatever his case required. Indeed his discourse, when any complained of sickness, was a little exuberant in the praises of this noble cathartic. But his distemper proving of a nature to which this re∣medy was wholly foreign, as well as this precluding the use of a more effectual recipe, he expired, not with∣out the character of a most considerate person. I find, by one part of his will, he obliged his heir to consume a certain quantity of ale among his neighbours, on the day he was born; and by another, left a ring of bells to the church adjoining to his garden. It looks as if the old gentleman had not only an aversion to much re∣flection in himself, but endeavoured to provide against it in succeeding generations.</P>

I have heard that he sometimes boasted that he was a distant relation of Sir Roger de Coverly.</P>

<HEAD>An Opinion of Ghosts.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable how much the belief of ghosts and apparitions of persons departed, has lost ground within these fifty years. This may perhaps be explain∣ed by the general growth of knowledge; and by the consequent decay of superstition, even in those king∣doms where it is most essentially interwoven with reli∣gion.</P>
<P>The same credulity, which disposed the mind to be∣lieve the miracles of a popish saint, set aside at once the interposition of reason; and produced a fondness for the marvellous, which it was the priest's advantage to pro∣mote.</P>
<P>It may be natural enough to suppose that a belief of this kind might spread in the days of popish infatua∣tion. A belief, as much supported by ignorance, as the ghosts themselves were indebted to the night.</P>
<P>But whence comes it, that narratives of this kind have at any time been given, by persons of veracity, of judgement, and of learning? men neither liable to be deceived themselves, nor to be suspected of an inclina∣tion to deceive others, though it were their interest; nor who could be supposed to have any interest in it, even though it were their inclination?</P>
<P>Here seems a further explanation wanting than what can be drawn from superstition.</P>
<P>I go upon a supposition, that the relations themselves were false. For as to the arguments sometimes used in this case, that had there been no true shilling there had been no counterfeit, it seems wholly a piece of so∣phistry. The true shilling here should mean the living person; and the counterfeit resemblance, the posthu∣mous figure of him, that either strikes our senses or our imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="44"/>
Supposing no ghost then ever appeared, is it a conse∣quence that no man could ever imagine that they saw the figure of a person deceased? Surely those, who say this, little know the force, the caprice, or the defects, of the imagination.</P>
<P>Persons after a debauch of liquor, or under the in∣fluence of terror, or in the deliria of a fever, or in a fit of lunacy, or even walking in their sleep, have had their brain as deeply impressed with chimerical represent∣ations as they could possibly have been, had their repre∣sentations struck their senses.</P>
<P>I have mentioned but a few instances, wherein the brain is primarily affected. Others may be given, per∣haps not quite so common, where the stronger passions, either acute or chronical, have impressed their object upon the brain; and this in so lively a manner, as to leave the visionary no room to doubt of their real presence.</P>
<P>How difficult then must it be to undeceive a person as to objects thus imprinted? imprinted absolutely with the same force as their eyes themselves could have pour∣trayed them! and how many persons must there needs be, who could never be undeceived at all!</P>
<P>Some of these causes might not improbably have given rise to the notion of apparitions: and when the notion had been once promulgated, it had a natural ten∣dency to produce more instances.</P>
<P>The gloom of night, that was productive of terror, would be naturally productive of apparitions. The event confirmed it.</P>
<P>The passion of grief for a departed friend, of horror for a murdered enemy, of remorse for a wronged testator, of love for a mistress killed by inconstancy, of gratitude to a wife of long fidelity, of desire to be reconciled to one who died at variance, of impatience to vindicate what was falsely construed, of propensity to consult with an adviser that is lost.—The more faint as well as the more powerful passions, when bearing relation to a per∣son deceased, have often, I fancy, with concurrent cir∣cumstances, been sufficient to exhibit the dead to the living.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="45"/>
But, what is more, there seems no other account that is adequate to the case as I have stated it. Allow this, and you have at once a reason, why the most upright may have published a falsehood, and the most judicious confirmed an absurdity.</P>
<P>Supposing then that apparitions of this kind may have some real use in God's moral government: is not any moral purpose, for which they may be employed, as effectually answered on my supposition, as the other? for surely it cannot be of any importance, by what means the brain receives these images. The effect, the conviction, and the resolution consequent, may be just the same in either of the cases.</P>
<P>Such appears, to me at least, to be the true existence of apparitions.</P>
<P>The reasons against any external apparition, among others that may be brought, are these that follow.</P>
<P>They are, I think, never seen by day; and darkness being the season of terror and uncertainty, and the ima∣gination less restrained, they are never visible to more than one person: which had more probably been the case, were not the vision internal.</P>
<P>They have not been reported to have appeared these twenty years. What cause can be assigned, were their existence real, for so great a change as their discon∣tinuance?</P>
<P>The cause of superstition has lost ground for this last century: the notion of ghosts has been, together ex∣ploded: a reason why the imagination should be less prone to conceive them; but not a reason why they themselves should cease.</P>
<P>Most of those, who relate that these spectres have ap∣peared to them, have been persons either deeply supersti∣tious in other respects; of enthusiastic imaginations, or strong passions, which are the consequence; or else have allowedly felt some perturbation at the time.</P>
<P>Some few instances may be supposed, where the caprice of imagination, so very remarkable in dreams, may have presented fantasms to those that waked. I believe there are few but can recollect some, wherein it has
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
wrought mistakes, at least equal to that of a white horse for a winding-sheet.</P>
<P>To conclude. As my hypothesis supposes the chimera to give terror equal to the reality, our best means of avoiding it, is to keep a strict guard over our passions—To avoid intemperance, as we would a charnel-house; and by making frequent appeals to cool reason and common sense, secure to ourselves the property of a well-regulated imagination.</P>

<HEAD>On Cards.—A Fragment.</HEAD>
<P>—WE had passed our evening with some certain persons famous for their taste, their learn∣ing, and refinement: But, as ill-luck would have it, two fellows, duller than the rest, had contrived to put them∣selves upon a level, by introducing a game at cards.</P>
<P>It is a sign, said he, the world is far gone in absurdity, or surely the fashion of cards would be accounted no small one. Is it not surprising that men of sense should sub∣mit to join in this idle custom, which appears original∣ly invented to supply its deficiency? But such is the fa∣tality! imperfections give rise to fashions! and are followed by those who do not labour under the defects that introduced them. Nor is the hoop the only instance of a fashion invented by those who found their account in it; and afterwards countenanced by others to whose figure it was prejudicial.</P>
<P>How can men, who value themselves upon their re∣flections, give encouragement to a practice, which puts an end to thinking?</P>
<P>I intimated the old allusion of the bow, that requires fresh vigour by a temporary relaxation.</P>
<P>He answered, this might be applicable, provided I could shew, that cards did not require the pain of think∣ing; and merely exclude from it, the profit and the pleasure.</P>
<P>Cards, if one may guess from their first appearance,
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
seem invented for the use of children; and, among the toys peculiar to infancy, the bells, the whistle, the rat∣tle, and the hobby-horse, deserved their share of com∣mendation. By degrees men, who came nearest to chil∣dren in understanding and want of ideas, grew ena∣moured of the use of them as a suitable entertainment. Others also, pleased to reflect on the innocent part of their lives, had recourse to this amusement, as what recalled it to their minds. A knot of villains encreased the party; who, regardless of that entertainment, which the former seemed to draw from cards, considered them in a more serious light, and made use of them as a more decent substitute to robbing on the road, or picking pockets. But men who propose to themselves a dignity of character, where will you find their inducement to this kind of game? For difficult indeed were it to determine, whether it appear more odious among sharpers, or more empty and ridiculous among persons of character.</P>
<P>Perhaps, replied I, your men of wit and fancy may favour this diversion, as giving occasion for the crop of jest and witticism, which naturally enough arises from the names and circumstances of the cards.</P>
<P>He said, he would allow this as a proper motive, in case the men of wit and humour would accept the ex∣cuse themselves.</P>
<P>In short, says he, as persons of ability are capable of furnishing out a much more agreeable entertain∣ment; when a gentleman offers me cards, I shall esteem it as his private opinion that I have neither sense nor fancy.</P>
<P>I asked how much he had lost—His answer was, he did not much regard ten pieces; but that it hurt him to have squandered them away on cards; and that to the loss of conversation, for which he would have given twenty.</P>
</DIV2>

<PB N="39" REF="48"/>
<HEAD>On Hypocrisy.</HEAD>
<P>WERE hypocrites to pretend to no uncommon sanctity, their want of merit would be less dis∣coverable. But pretentions of this nature bring their characters upon the carpet. Those who endeavour to pass for the lights of the world must expect to attract the eyes of it. A small blemish is more easily discover∣able in them, and more justly ridiculous, than a much greater in their neighbours. A small blemish also pre∣sents a clue, which very often conducts us through the most intricate mazes and dark recesses of their character.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the evidence of this, how often do we see pretence cultivated in proportion as virtue is neglected! As religion sinks in one scale, pretence is exalted in the other.</P>
<P>Perhaps, there is not a more effectual key to the discovery of hypocrisy than a censorious temper. The man possessed of real virtue knows the difficulty of at∣taining it; and is, of course, more inclined to pity others, who happen to fail in the pursuit. The hypocrite, on the other hand, having never trod the thorny path, is less induced to pity those who desert it for the flowery one. He exposes the unhappy victim without compuc∣tion, and even with a kind of triumph; not considering that vice is the proper object of compassion; or that propensity to censure is almost a worse quality than any it can expose.</P>
<P>Clelia was born in England, of Romish parents, about the time of the revolution. She seemed naturally framed for love, if you were to judge by her external beauties; but if you build your opinion on her outward conduct, you would have deemed her as naturally averse to it. Numerous were the garçons of the polite and gallant nation, who endeavoured to overcome her prejudices, and to reconcile her manners to her form. Persons of rank, fortune, learning, wit, youth, and beauty sued to her; nor had she any reason to quarrel with love for
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
the shapes in which he appeared before her. Yet in vain were all applications. Religion was her only ob∣ject; and she seemed resolved to pass her days in all the the austerities of the most rigid convent. To this pur∣pose she sought out an abbess that presided over a nun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery in Languedoc, a small community, particularly remarkable for extraordinary instances of self-denial. The abbess herself exhibited a person in which chastity appeared indeed not very meritorious. Her character was perfectly well known before she went to preside over this little society. Her virtues were indeed such as she thought most convenient to her circumstances. Her fasts were the effect of avarice, and her devotions of the spleen. She considered the cheapness of house-keeping as the great reward of piety, and added profuseness to the seven deadly sins. She knew fack-cloth to be cheaper than brocade, and ashes than sweet powder.</P>
<P>Her heart sympathized with every cup that was broken, and she instituted a fast for each domestic mis∣fortune. She had converted her larder into a study, and the greater part of her library consisted of manuals for fasting-days. By these arts, and this way of life, she seemed to enjoy as great a freedom from inordinate de∣sir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as the persons might be supposed to do, who were favoured with her smiles or her conversation.</P>
<P>To this lady was Clelia admitted; and after the year of probation assumed the veil.</P>
<P>Among many others who had solicited her notice, before she became a member of this convent, was Lean∣der, a young physician of great l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arning and ingenuity. His personal accomplishments were at least equal to those of any of his rivals, and his passion was superior. He urged in his behalf all that wit, inspired by fondness, and recommended by person, dress, and equipage, could insinuate; but in vain. She grew angry at the solici∣tations with which she resolved never to to comply, and which she found so difficult to evade.</P>
<P>But Clelia now had assumed the veil, and Leander was the most miserable of mortals. He had not so high an opinion of his fair one's sanctity and zeal, as some
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
other of her admirers: But he had a conviction of her beauty, and that altogether irresistible. His extrava∣gant passion had produced in him a jealousy that was not easily eluded,</P>
<Q><L>"At regina dolos—</L>
<L>"Quid non sentit amor?"</L></Q>
<P>He had observed his mistress go more frequently to her confessor, a young and blooming ecclesiastic, than was, perhaps, necessary for so much apparent pu∣rity, or, as he thought, consistent with it. It was enough to put a lover on the rack, and it had this ef∣fect upon Leander. His suspicions were by no means lessened, when he found the convent to which Clelia had given the preference before all others, was one where this young friar supplied a confessional chair.</P>
<P>It happened that Leander was brought to the abbess in the capacity of a physician, and he had one more opportunity offered him of beholding Clelia through the grate.</P>
<P>She, quite shocked at his appearance, burst out into a sudden rage, inveighing bitterly against his presump∣tion, and calling loudly on the name of the blessed vir∣gin and the holy friar. The convent was, in short, alarmed; nor was Clelia capable of being pacified till the good man was called, in order to allay, by suitable applications, the emotions raised by this unexpected interview.</P>
<P>Leander grew daily more convinced, that it was not only verbal communications which passed between Clelia and the friar. This, however, he did not think him∣self fully warranted to disclose, till an accident of a sin∣gular nature, gave him an opportunity of receiving more ample testimony.</P>
<P>The confessor had a favourite spaniel, which he had lost for some time, and was informed at length that he was killed, at a village in the neighbourhood, being evidently mad. The friar was at first not much con∣cerned; but in a little time recollected that the dog had
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
snapped his fingers the very day before his elopement. A physician's advice was thought expedient on the occasion, and Leander was the next physician. He told him with great frankness, that no prescription he could write, had the sanction of so much experience as immersion in sea-water. The friar, therefore, the next day, set for∣ward upon his journey, while Leander, not without a mischievous kind of satisfaction, conveys the following lines to Clelia.</P>
<P>"My charming Clelia,</P>
<P><Q>“THOUGH I yet love you to distraction, I cannot but suspect that you have granted favours to your confessor, which you might, with greater inno∣cence, have granted to Leander. All I have to add is this, that amorous intercourses of this nature, which you have enjoyed with Friar Laurence, put you under the like necessity with him of seeking a” remedy in the ocean.</Q></P>
<P>"Adieu! LEANDER!"</P>
<P>Imagine Clelia guilty; and then imagine her confu∣sion. To rail was insignificant, and to blame her phy∣sician was absu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, when she found herself under a neces∣sity of pursuing his advice. The whole society was made acquainted with the journey she was undertaking, and the causes of it. It were uncharitable to suppose the whole community under the same constraint with the unhappy Clelia. However, the greater part thought it decent to attend her. Some went as her companions, some for exercise, some for amusement, and the abbess herself as guardian of her train, and concerned in her society's misfortunes.</P>

<HEAD>On Vanity.</HEAD>
<P>HISTORY preserves the memory of empires and of states, with which it necessarily interweaves that o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heroes, kings, and statesmen. Biography affords a pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce to the remarkable characters of private men. There are likewise other subordinate testimonies, which serve to perpetuate, at least prolong, the memories of men, whose characters and stations give them no claim to a place in story. For instance, when a person fails of making that figure in the world which he makes in the eyes of his own relations or himself, he is rarely digni∣fied any farther than with his picture whilst he is living, or with an inscription upon his monument after his de∣cease. Inscriptions have been so fallacious, that we be∣gin to expect little from them b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>side elegance of style. To inveigh against the writers, for their manifest want of truth, were as absurd as to censure Homer for the the beauties of an imaginary character.—But even paintings, in order to gratisy the vanity of the person who bespeaks them, are taught, now-a-days, to flatter like epitaphs.</P>
<P>Falsehoods upon a tomb or monument may be intitled to some excuse in the affection, the gratitude, and piety, of surviving friends. Even grief itself disposes us to magnify the virtues of a relation, as visible objects also appear larger through tears. But the man who through an idle vanity susters his features to be belied or ex∣changed for others of a more agreeable make, may with great truth be said to lose his property in the portrait. In like manner, if he encourage the painter to belie his dress, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. seems to transfer his claim to the man with whose station his assumed trappings are connected.</P>
<P>I remember a bag-piper, whose physiognomy was so remarkable and familiar to a club he attended, that it was agreed to have his picture placed over their chimney-piece. There was this remarkable in the fellow, that he chose always to go barefoot, though he was daily of∣fered a pair of shoes. However, when the painter had
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
been so exact as to omit this little piece of dress, the fellow offered all he had in the world, the whole produce of three night's harmony, to have those feet covered in the effigy, which he so much scorned to cover in the ori∣ginal. Perhaps he thought it a disgrace to his instrument to be e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernized in the hands of so much apparent poverty. However, when a person of low station adorns himself with trophies to which he has no pretensions to aspire, he should consider the picture as actually telling a lie to posterity.</P>
<P>The absurdity of this is evident, if a person assume to himself a mitre, a blue garter, or a coronet, impro∣perly; but station may be falsified by other decorations, as well as these.</P>
<P>But I am driven into this grave discourse, on a subject perhaps not very important, by a real fit of spleen. I this morning saw a fellow drawn in a night-gown of so rich a stuff, that the expence, had he purchased such a one, would more than half have ruined him; and ano∣ther coxcomb, seated by his painter in a velvet chair, who would have been surprised at the deference paid him, had he been offered a cushion.</P>

<HEAD>An Adventure.</HEAD>
<L>—"Gaudent praenomine molles</L>
<L>"Auriculae"—</L>
<P>IT is a very convenient piece of knowledge for a per∣son upon a journey, to know the compellations with which it is proper to address those he happens to meet by his way. Some accuracy here may be of use to him who would be well directed either in the length or the tenden∣cy of his road; or be freed from any itinerary difficul∣ties incident to those who do not know the country. It may not be indeed imprudent to accost a passenger with a title superior to what he may appear to claim. This will seldom fail to diffuse a wonderful alacrity in his
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
countenance; and be, perhaps, a method of securing you from any mistake of greater importance.</P>
<P>I was led into these observations by some solicitudes I lately underwent, on account of my ignorance in these peculiarities. Being somewhat more versed in books than I can pretend to be in the orders of men, it was my fortune to undertake a journey, which I was to perform by means of enquiries. I had passed a number of miles without any sort of difficulty, by help of the manifold instructions that had been given me on my setting out. At length, being something dubious concerning my way, I met a person, whom, from his night-cap and several domestic parts of dress, I deemed to be of the neighbourhood. His station of life appeared to me, to be what we call a gentleman-farmer; a sort of subaltern character, in respect of which the world seems not inva∣riably determined. It is in short what King Charles the Second esteemed the happiest of all stations; superior to the toilsome task and ridiculous dignity of constable; and as much inferior to the intricate practice and invi∣dious decisions of a justice of peace. <Q>"Honest man," says I, “be so good as to inform me whether I am in the way to Mirlington?”</Q> He replied, with a sort of surliness, that he knew nothing of the matter; and turned away with as much disgust, as though I had called him rogue or rascal.</P>
<P>I did not readily penetrate the cause of his displeasure, but proceeded on my way, with hopes to find other means of information. The next I met was a young fellow, dressed in all the pride of rural spruceness; and beside him, walked a gi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l in a dress agreeable to that of her companion. As I presumed him by no means averse to appear considerable in the eyes of his mistress, I sup∣posed a compliment might not be disagreeable; and en∣quiring the road to Mirlington, addressed him by the name of "Honesty." The fellow, whether to shew his wit before his mistress, or whether he was displeased with my familiarity, I cannot tell, directed me to follow a part of my face (which I was well assured could be no
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
guide to me, and that other parts would follow of con∣sequence.</P>
<P>The next I met, appeared, by his look and gait, to stand high in his own opinion. I therefore judged the best way of proceeding was to adapt my phrase to his own ideas, and saluting him by the name of "Sir," de∣sired to obtain some insight into my road. My gentleman, without hesitation, gave me ample instructions for the rest of my journey.</P>
<P>I passed on, musing with myself, why an appellation relative to fortune should be preferred to one founded on merit; when I happened to behold a gentleman examin∣ing a sun-dial in his garden. <Q>“Friend," says I, will you tell me what a clock it is?”</Q> He made me no sort of answer, and seemed as much dissatisfied with my openness of temper, as with the confidence I placed in his.—The refusal of an answer in this case was not of much importance. I proceeded on my way, and hap∣pened to meet a very old woman, whom I determined to accost by the appellation of "Dame;" and withal wished her a good night.</P>
<P>But, alas! she seemed so little pleased with the man∣ner of my address, that she returned me no manner of thanks for my kind wishes as to her repose. It is not clear whether my phrase was faulty, in regard to her dignity, or in respect of her age. But it is very proba∣ble she might conclude it an impropriety in respect of both.</P>
<P>I had by this time found the inconvenience of an ut∣ter ignorance in rural distinctions. The future part of my journey afforded me yet farther means of conviction. I was exposed to the danger of three quicksands, by calling a girl "sweetheart," instead of "madam;" and was within a foot of rushing down a precipice, by calling another, "Forsooth," who might easily have told me how to avoid it.</P>
<P>In short, I found myself well or ill used, as I hap∣pened, or not, to suit my salutations to people's ideas of their own rank. Towards the last part of my stage, I was to pass a brook, so much swelled by land-floods,
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
that the proper way through it was undistinguishable. A well-dressed gentleman was passing a bridge on my left hand. It was here of much importance for me to suc∣ceed in my enquiry. I was, therefore, meditating within myself which might be the most endearing of all appellations; and at last besought him to give me some instructions, under the name of "Honest Friend." He was not seemingly so much pleased as I assured my∣self he would be, and trudged onward without reply. After this, I had not gone many steps (out of the path, for so it proved) before I found myself and horse plunged headlong in the brook; and my late honest friend in a laughter at our downfall.</P>
<P>I made a shift, however, to recover both myself and horse; and, after a few more difficulties, arrived at the end of my journey. I have since made strict enquiry into the due application of such inferior titles, and may, perhaps, communicate them to you, on some future occasion. In the mean time, you may, if you please, consider the vast importance of superior titles, when there is no one so inconsiderable but there is also a mind that it can influence.</P>
<P>When your reflect upon this subject, you will, per∣haps, be less severe on your friend—, who, you tell me, is now trafficing for this species of dignity.</P>
<P>Learn to be wise then from others harm; and do not forget to observe decorum, on every occasion that you may have to address him for the future. Pretend no more at the close of your epistle to be his faithful ser∣vant, much less his affectionate one. Tender your ser∣vices with great respect, if you do not choose to do it with profound veneration. He will certainly have no more to do with sincerity and truth. Remember,</P>

<HEAD>On Modesty and Impudence.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a man of genius does not print, he disco∣vers himself by nothing more than by his abi∣lities
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
in dispute. However let him shew solidity in his opinions, together with ease, elegance, and vivacity in his expressions; yet if an impudent face be found to baffle him, he shall be judged inferior in other respects. I mean, he will grow cheap in mixed company: for as to select judges, they will form their opinions by ano∣ther scale: with these, a single epistle, penned with pro∣priety, will more effectually prove his wit, than an hun∣dred defects in his conversation will demonstrate the re∣verse.</P>
<P>It is true, there is nothing displays a genius, I mean a quickness of genius, more than a dispute; as two diamonds, encountering, contribute to each other's lus∣tre. But perhaps the odds is much against the man of taste in this particular.</P>
<P>Bashfulness is more frequently connected with good sense, than we find assurance: and impudence, on the other hand, is often the mere effect of downright stu∣pidity. On this account the man of genius has as much the advantage of his antagonist, as a race-horse, carry∣ing a small weight, has over his rival that bears a larger: modesty, like the weight to which I allude, not suffer∣ing its owner to exert its real strength; which effrontery is allowed to do, without let or impediment.</P>
<P>It may be urged, and justly enough, that it is com∣mon to be partial to the modest man; and that diffidence makes good amends for any restraint it lays us under, by the prejudice it gives every hearer in our favour. But indeed this can only happen, where it meets with the most ingenuous judges. Otherwise a laugh will carry the day, with which the ignorant side is generally best accommodated.</P>
<P>In order to put these antagonists upon a somewhat more equal footing, I have invented the following in∣strument; for the sole structure and sale of which, I am not without hopes of procuring a patent. What I mean, is an artificial laugher. There are few so little conversant in toys, but must have seen instruments me∣chanically framed to counterseit the voices of different
<PB N="49" REF="58"/>
birds. The quail-pipe is brought to such perfection as even to delude the very species. The cuckow has been mimicked with no less accuracy. Would it not then be an easy matter to represent the laugh of this empty tribe, which has in itself something artificial; and is not more affected than it is particular? For the convenience of the person that bears it, its dimensions should be so contrived as that it might be played on in his pocket. Does it not seem seasible, that a laughter of this kind may be brought to answer every purpose of that noise which it resembles? If there be occasion for an expletive, let the owner seek it in his fob; as his antagonist would find his account in a loud oath or an empty pun. If there be need of a good sounding cadence at the close of a common period, it may not be amiss to harmonize a a sentence by what may be called a finishing stroke. This instrument is so contrived as to produce all the va∣riety of an human laugh; and this variation is to be regulated, not by the nature of your subject, nor the wit or humour of a repartee, but by the disposition of the company, and the proper minute for such an inter∣tude. But to become a master of the said machine, let the candidate for applause frequent the company of vo∣ciferous disputants; among whom he may soon learn how to perform a conversation.</P>
<P>One or two of these instruments I have already finished, though not indeed to the perfection at which I expect they may soon arrive. A gentleman visited me the other day, who has the justest claim that can be, to the use of them; having nothing in his character than can ob∣scure the greatest merit, but the greatest modesty. I communicated my invention, desiring him to make trial of it, on the first occasion. He did so; and when I saw him next, gave me leave to publish the following account of its efficacy in my next advertisement. The first time I employed it, said my friend, was in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort of controversy with a beau; who had contrived means, by the use of his snuff-box, to supply both want of language and of thought. In this manner he prolonged his argument; and really to the company,
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
which consisted of ladies, discovered more sagacity with∣out thinking, than I could do by its assistance. I be∣thought myself immediately of your instrument, and had recourse to it. I observed in what part of his dis∣coure he most employed his fingers, and had suddenly recourse to mine, with equal emphasis and significancy. The art was not discovered, ere I had routed my antago∣nist; having seated myself in a dark corner, where my operations were not discernible. I observed, that as he found himself more closely pressed, he grew more and more assiduous in his application to his snuff-box, much as an otter closely pursued is forced to throw up bubbles that show his distress. I therefore discovered gradually less and less occasion for speaking; and for thinking, none at all. I played only a flourish in answer to the ar∣gument at his finger's ends; and after a while found him as mortal in this part as in any other. When his cause was just expiring, after a very long pursuit, and many fruitless turnings and evasions in the course of it, I sounded my instrument, with as much alacrity as a huntsman does his horn on the death of an hare.</P>
<P>The next whom I engaged was a more formidable disputant; and I own, with a sense of gratitude, that your instrument alone could render me a match for him. His strength of argument was h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s strength of lungs; and he was, unquestionably, an able antagonist. How∣ever, if your machine put me upon a par with him, I think I may say without vanity, that in point of rea∣son, I had the upper hand. I shal only add that as it was habitual for him to answer arguments by vocifera∣tion, so it became needless for me to give him any an∣swer of a better kind.</P>
<P>Thus far my friend: I do not question but there will appear artists, that shall undertake to instruct the diffi∣dent, the submissive, and the bashful, how to perform the whole gamut of oratorical and risible music: and as there is a kind of humourous <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aughter, which draws all others into its own vortex, I need not here assert that I would have this branch very much inculcated.</P>
<P>Neither is this instrument of importance in dispute
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
alone, or controversy; but wherever one man's faculties are more prone to laughter than another's. Trifles will burst one man's sides, which will not disturb the features of another; and a laugh one cannot join, is almost as irksome as a lamentation. It is like a peal rung after a wedding; where a whole parish shall be stunned with noise, because they want that occasion to rejoice, which the persons at least imagine to be their lot, that occa∣sioned it. The sounds are pleasing to their ears, who find them conformable to their own ideas; but those who are not in temper, or unconcerned, find them a stu∣pifying repetition.</P>
<P>When therefore my mind is not in tune with another's, what strikes his, will not vibrate on mine. All I then have to do, is to counterfeit a laugh; which is an ope∣ration as artificial, as the machine I have been de∣scribing.</P>

<HEAD>The History of Don Pedro ****.</HEAD>
<P>THE actions of our lives, even those we call most important, seem as much subject to trifles, as our very lives themselves. We frame many notable projects in imagination, and promise to ourselves an equal term of life. It is however in the power of the minutest ac∣cident, to shorten the one, and disconcert the other. It is with mankind as with certain fire-engines, whose motion may be stopped in the midst of its rapidity, by the interposition of straw in a particular part of them.</P>
<P>The following translation from the original Spanish, will sufficiently illustrate the foregoing assertion. Don Pedro **** was one of the principal grandees of his age and country. He had a genius equal to his birth, and a disposition remarkably contemplative. It was his cus∣tom, on this account, to retire from the world at stated periods, and to indulge himself in all the mazes of a fine imagination. It happened as he one day safe in his study, that he fixed his eye on a neighbouring spi∣der. The most trivial object (if any natural object can
<PB N="52" REF="61"/>
be termed so) served him frequently for the foundation of some moral and sublime reflection. He surveyed the creature attentively, and indulged the bias of his thought, till he was lost in the excursions of a profound reverie. The curious workmanship of this unregarded animal brought at once into his mind the whole art of fortifica∣tion. He observed the deficiency of human skill, and that no cunning could have contrived her so proper an habitation. He found that no violence could affect the extremities of her lines, but what was immediately perceptible, and liable to alarm her at the centre. He observed the road by which she sallied forth, served to convey intelligence from without, at the same time that it added strength and stability to the work within. He was at once surprised and pleased with an object which, although common, he hap∣pened not to have beheld in the same light, or with the same attention. From this instant he bent his thoughts upon the advancement of military fortification: and he often would declare it was this trivial incident, that gave him a relish for that study, which he afterwards pursued with such application and success.</P>
<P>He spent in short so much time upon the attainment of this science, that he grew as capable of executing any part of it, as speculation alone could render him. Nothing wanted now, but practice to complete the fame of his abilities. That in short was his next pursuit. He became desirous of experiencing, what had been so successful in imagination. and to make those mural sal∣lies, which had been attended there with victory. To this end he had little to do, but excite the ambition of his young monarch; to enforce, by testimony of his friends, his qualifications for the post he fought; and, on the first delivery of his petition, to obtain prefer∣ment from the king.</P>
<P>This happened to be a time of the profoundest tran∣quillity: little agreeable to a person eager of glory, fur∣nished with skill, and conscious of abilities. Such was this ingenious nobleman. He well knew the ambition of princes, and of his monarch in particular. But he was not acquainted with his own. That imperious and subtle passion is often most predominate when it is least
<PB N="53" REF="62"/>
perceived. When it once prevails in any great degree, we and our reason grow subservient, and, instead of checking or contradicting, it stoops to flatter and to au∣thorize it. Instead of undeceiving, she confirms us in our error; and even levels the mounds, and smooths the obstructions, which it is her natural province to inter∣pose. This was the case of Don Pedro. The delicacy of his taste encreased his sensibility; and his sensibility made him more a slave. The mind of man, like the finer parts of matter, the more delicate it is, naturally admits the more deep and the more visible impressions. The purest spirits are the soonest apt to take flame. Let us therefore be the more candid to him, on account of the vivacity of his passions, seduced, as indeed he was, into very unwarrantable schemes.</P>
<P>He had in brief conceived a project, to give his mas∣ter an universal monarchy. He had calculated every ar∣ticle with the utmost labour and precision, and intended within a few days, to present his project to the king.</P>
<P>Spain was then in a state of affluence; had a large army on foot; together with means and opportunities of raising an immense one. It were impossible to answer for the possible events, that might destroy their hopes of such an enterprize. Difficulty often attends the execu∣tion of things the most feasible and well contrived in theory. But whoever was acquainted with the author of this project, knew the posture of affairs in Europe at that time, the ambition of the prince, and the many circumstances that conspired to favour it, might have thought the project would have been agreed to, put in practice, and, without some particular interposition of fortune, been attended with success—But sortune did not put herself to any particular trouble about the matter.</P>
<P>Don Pedro, big with vast designs, was one day walk∣ing in his fields. He was promised next morning an audience of the king. He was preparing himself for a conversation, which might prove of so much conse∣quence to all mankind; when walking thoughtfully along, and regardless of his path, his foot happened to
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
stumble and to overturn an ant's nest. He cast his eyes upon the ground to see the occasion of his mistake, where he spyed the little animals in the most miserable con∣fusion. He had the delicacy of sentiment, to be really sorry for what he had done; and, putting himself in their condition, began to reflect upon the consequence. It might be an age, to them, ere they could recover their tranquillity. He viewed them with a sort of smile, to find the anxiety they underwent for such perishable ha∣bitations. Yet he considered that his contempt was only the effect of his own superiority; and that there might be some created beings, to whom his own species must appear as trifling. His remark did not cease here. He considered his future enterprize, with an eye to such a race of beings. He found it must appear to them in a light as disadvantageous, as the ambition, and vain-glory of an ant would, to himself. How ridiculous, he said, must this republic appear to me, could I discern its actions, as it has probably many, that are analogous to those of human nature! Suppose them at continual variance about the property of a grain of sand. Sup∣pose one, that had acquired a few sands more to his por∣tion—as also one grain of wheat, and one small particle of barley-flour—should think himself qualified to tyran∣nize over his equals, and to lord it, uncontrouled. Consider him, on this account, not contented to make use of the numerous legs with which nature has supplied him, borne alo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by a couple of slaves within the hollow of an husk of wheat, five or six others, at the same time, attending solemnly upon the procession. Suppose lastly, that among this people, the prime minister should persuade the rest to levy war upon a neighbouring co∣lony; and this in order to be stiled the sovereign of two hillocks, instead of one; while perhaps their present condition leaves them nothing to wish besides superflui∣ties. At the same time it is in the power of the most inconsiderable among mankind, nay of any species of animals superior to their own, to destroy at once the mi∣nister and people all together: this is doubtless very ri∣diculous; yet this is doubtless my own case, in respect
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
to many subordinate beings, and very certainly of the Supreme one. Farewell then, ye air-built citadels! farewell, visions of unsolid glory! Don Pedro will seek no honour of so equivocal an acceptation, as to degrade his character to a superior species, in proportion as it exalts him before his own.</P>
<P>See here a just conclusion! in short, he found it so fairly drawn, as immediately to drop his project, leave the army, and retire: of which whimsical relation it may be well enough observed, that a spider had enslaved the world, had not an ant obstructed his design.</P>

<HEAD>Upon Envy.—To a Friend, R. G.</HEAD>
<P>WHENCE is it, my friend, that I feel it impossi∣ble to envy you, although, hereafter, your qua∣lifications may make whole millions do so? for, believe me, when I affirm, that I deem it much more super∣fluous, to wish you honours to gratify your ambition, than to wish you ambition enough to make your honours satisfactory.</P>
<P>It seems an hard case that envy should be the conse∣quence of merit, at the same time that scorn so naturally attends the want of it. It is however in some measure perhaps an unavoidable (and perhaps in some sense an useful) passion in all the most heroic natures; where, re∣fined through certain strainers, it takes the name of emu∣lation. It is a pain arising in our breasts, on contem∣plation of the superior advantages of another: and its tendency is truly good, under some certain regulations.</P>
<P>All honour, very evidently, depends upon compari∣son; and consequently the more numerous are our su∣periors, the smaller portion of it falls to our share. Considered relatively, we are dwarfs, or giants; though considered absolutely, we are neither. However, the love of this relative grandeur is made a part of our na∣tures; and the use of emulation is to excite our dili∣gence in pursuit of power, for the sake of beneficence.
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
The instances of its perversion are obvious to every one's observation. A vicious mind, instead of its own emo∣lument, studies the debasement of his superior. A per∣son to please one of this cast, must needs divest himself of all useful qualities; and in order to be beloved, dis∣cover nothing that is truly amiable. One may very safely fix our esteem on those whom we hear some people depreciate. Merit is to them as uniformly odious, as the sun itself to the birds of darkness. An author, to judge of his own merit, may fix his eye upon this tribe of men; and suffer his satisfaction to arise in due pro∣portion to their discontent. Their disapprobation will sufficiently influence every generous bosom in his favour: and I would as implicitly give my applause to one whom they pull to pieces, as the inhabitants of Pegu worship those, that have been devoured by apes.</P>
<P>It is another perversion of this passion, though of a less enormous nature, when it merely stimulates us to rival others in points of no intrinsic worth. To equal others in the useless parts of learning; to pursue riches for the sake of an equipage as brilliant; to covet an equal knowledge of a table; to vie in jockey-ship, or cunning at a bett. These, and many other rivalships, answer not the genuine purposes of emulation.</P>
<P>I believe the passion is oftentimes derived from a too partial view of our own and others excellencies. We behold a man possessed of some particular advantage, and we immediately reflect upon its deficiency in ourselves. We wait not to examine what others we have to balance it. We envy another man's bodily accomplishments; when our mental ones might preponderate, would we put them into the scale. Should we ask our own bosoms whether we would change situations altogether, I fancy self-love would, generally, make us prefer our own con∣dition. But if our sentiments remain the same after such an examination, all we can justly endeavour is our own real advancement. To meditate this detriment either in fortune, power, or reputation, at the same time that it is infamous, has often a tendency to depress our∣selves. But let us confine our emulation to points of
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
real worth; to riches, power, or knowledge, only that we may rival others in beneficence.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>A Vision.</HEAD>
<P>INGENIOUS was the device of those celebrated wor∣thies, who, for the more effectual promulgation of their well-grounded maxims, first pretended to divine inspiration. Peace be to their manes; may the turf lie lightly on their breast; and the verdure over their grave be as perpetual as their memories! Well knew they questionless, that a proceeding of this nature must af∣ford an excuse to their modesty, as well as add a weight to their instructions. For, from the beginning of time, if we may believe the histories of the best repute, man has ever found a delight in giving credit to surprising lies. There was indeed a necessary degree of credit, previous to this delight; and there was as necessary a delight, in order to enforce any degree of credit. But so it was, that the pleasure rose, in proportion to the wonder; and if the love of wonder was but gratified, no matter whether the tale was founded upon a witch or an Egeria; on a rat, a pigeon, the pummel of a sword, a bloated sibyl, or a three-foot stool.</P>
<P>Of all writers that bear any resemblance to these ori∣ginals, those who approach the nearest, are such, as de∣scribe their extraordinary dreams and visions. Of osten∣tation we may not, peradventure, accuse them, who claim to themselves no other than the merit of spectators. Of want of abilities we must not censure them; when we are given to know that their imagination had no more part in the affair, than a whited wall has, in those various figures, which some crafty artist represents thereon.</P>
<P>The first meditation of a solitary, is the behaviour of men in active life. Hapless species, I cried, how very grossly art thou mistaken! how very supine, while youth permits thee to gain the prize of virtue, by restraint!
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
how very resolute, when thine age leaves nothing to re∣strain thee! thou givest a loose to thine inclinations, till they lose their very being; and, like a lamp over∣whelmed with oil, are extinguished by indulgence. What folly to dream of virtue, when there is no longer room for self-denial; or, when the enemy expires by sickness, to demand the honour of a triumph!—Musing upon this subject, I fell into a profound slumber; and the vision with which it furnished me, shall supply ma∣terials for this essay.</P>
<P>I was, methought, transported into a winding valley, on each side of whose area, so far as my eye could see, were held up (in the manner of a picture) all the pleas∣ing objects either of art or nature. Hills rose one be∣yond another, crowned with trees, or adorned with edi∣fices; broken rocks contrasted with lawns, and foaming rivers poured headlong over them; gilded spires enli∣vened even the sunshine; and lonesome ruins, by the side of woods, gave a solemnity to the shade. It would be endless, or rather impossible, to give an idea of the vast variety. It seemed, as though people of whatever inclinations might here meet with their favourite object.</P>
<P>While I stood amazed, and even confounded, at so astonishing a landscape; an old man approached towards me, and offered his assistance in alleviating my surpize. You observe, says he, in the middle path, a train of sprightly female pilgrims <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Passions.</NOTE>, conducted by a matron <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Reason.</NOTE> of a graver cast. She is habited, as you may observe, in a robe far more plain and simple than that of any amidst her followers. It is her province to restrain her pupils, that the objects glittering on each side may may not se∣duce them to make excursions, from which they scarce ever find their right away again. You may not, per∣haps, suspect the gulphs and precipices that lie inter∣mixed amidst a scenery so delightful to the eye. You see, indeed, at a considerable distance, the gilt dome of a temple, raised on columns of the whitest marble. I must inform you, that within this temple resides a lady <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Virtue.</NOTE>▪
<PB N="59" REF="68"/>
weaving wreaths of immortal amaranth for that wor∣thy matron, if she exert her authority; and, as their obedience is more or less entire, she has also garlands of inferior lustre to recompence the ladies in her train.</P>
<P>Your own sagacity, added he, will supply the place of farther instructions; and then vanished in an instant.</P>
<P>The space before me, as it appeared, was crossed by four successive rivers. Over these were thrown as many bridges, and beyond each of these streams the ground seemed to vary its degree of lustre, as much as if it had lain under a different climate. On the side of each of these rivers appeared, as I thought, a receptacle for travellers; so that the journey seemed to be portioned into four distinct stages. It is possible that these were meant to represent the periods of a man's life; which may be distinguished by the names of infancy, youth, manhood, and old age.</P>
<P>During the first stage, our travellers proceeded with∣out much disturbance. Their excursions were of no greater extent than to crop a primrose, or a daisy, that grew on the way-side: and in these their governess in∣dulged them. She gave them but few checks, and they afforded her but little occasion. But when they arrived at the second period, the case then was greatly altered. The young ladies grew visibly enamoured of the beau∣ties on each side; and the governess began to feel a con∣sciousness of her duty to restrain them. They petition∣ed clamorously to make one short excursion, and met with a decent refusal. One of them, that visibly shewed her∣self the greatest vixen and romp <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Love.</NOTE> amongst them, had a thousand arts and stratagems to circumvent her well-meaning governess. I must here mention, what I re∣marked afterwards, that some of the pupils felt greater attractions in one stage; and some in another. And the scene before them being well variegated with mossy banks and purling streams, frisking lambs and piping shepherds; inspired a longing that was inexpressible, to one that seemed of an amorous complexion. She re∣quested
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
to make a short digression; pointed to the band of shepherds dancing; and, as I observed, presented a glass, through which the matron might distinctly view them. The governess applied the glass, and it was wonderful to trace the change it effected. She, who be∣fore had with much constancy opposed the prayers of her petitioner, now began to lean towards her demands; and, as if she herself were not quite indisferent to the scene of pleasure she had beheld, grew remiss in her dis∣cipline; softened the language of dissent; and with a gentle reprimand, suffered her pupil to elope. After this, however, she winked her eyes; that she might not at least bear testimony to the step she did not approve. When the lady had gratified her curiosity, she returned for the present; but with an appetite more inflamed, and more impatient to repeat her frolic. The gover∣ness appeared uneasy, and to repent of her own compli∣ance; and reason good she had; considering the confi∣dence it gave her pupil, and the weight it took from her own authority.</P>
<P>They were not passed far from the second stage of their journey, ere they all determined to rebel, and sub∣mit to the tyranny of their leader no longer.</P>
<P>Another now took the lead; and seizing an em∣broidered handkerchief, completely hoodwinked the di∣rectress. All now was tumult, anarchy, disagreement, and confusion. They led their guide along, blindfold, not without proposals of downright murder. They soon lost sight of the regular path, and strode along with amazing rapidity. I should however, except some few <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Virtuoso-passion.</NOTE>, who, being of a complexion naturally languid, and thus deprived of their protectress, had neither constancy to keep the road, nor spirit enough to stray far from it. These found the utmost of their inclinations gratified, in treasuring up shells from the banks of the river, scooping fossils from the rocks, or preserving plants that grew in the valley. A moth or butterfly afforded
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
them a chace, and a grub or beetle was a suitable com∣panion. But to return to vagabonds.</P>
<P>The lady that performed the feat of blinding her governess, for a time, bore the chief rule; and held the rest in a state of servitude <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ambition.</NOTE>. She seemed to be indeed formed for that power and grandeur, which was her de∣light; being of a stature remarkably tall, with an air of dignity in her countenance. Not but others would sometimes insist upon some temporary gratification. As they shaped their way to a great city, one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Indolence.</NOTE> would loll and loiter on a bed of roses; another would join the dance of shepherds, and sometimes retire with <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gallantry.</NOTE> one into the covert. A <NOTE N="∥" PLACE="foot">Avarice.</NOTE> third would not move a step farther, till she had gathered some ore that was washed from the mountains. When they entered the city, their dissipa∣tion was yet more observable. One <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ebriety.</NOTE> intoxicated her∣self with cordials; another <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Pride and Vanity</NOTE> went in quest of lace and equipage. The <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ambition.</NOTE> lady, however, at this time the most enterprising, and who (as I mentioned before) had given such a turn to their affairs, discovered a strange fondness herself for lawn and ermine, embroidered stars, and golden collars. However disficult it seemed to reach them, or how little necessary soever they seemed to happiness, these alone engaged her attention; and to these alone her hopes aspired. Nay she went so far, as, in failure of these, to resolve on misery and wilful wretchedness.</P>
<P>She at length succeeded, at least so far as to find how little they enhanced her happiness; and her former com∣peers, having ruined their constitutions, were once again desirous to have their queen reign over them. In short, their loyalty regained the ascendant; insomuch, that with one consent they removed the bandage from her eyes, and vowed to obey her future directions.</P>
<P>She promised to secure them all the happiness that was consistent with their present state; and advised them all to follow her towards the path they had forsaken.</P>
<P>Our travellers, in a little time after this, passed over
&lt;
<PB N="62" REF="71"/>
the bridge that introduced them to their closing stage. The subjects, very orderly, repentant, and demissive; the governess, more rigid and imperious than ever. The former, withered, decrepid, languishing; the latter, in greater vigour, and more beautiful than before. Time appeared to produce in her, a very opposite effect, to that it wrought in her companions. She seemed, in∣deed, no more that easy ductile creature, insulted and borne away by the whims of her companions. She ap∣peared more judicious in the commands she gave, and more rigorous in the execution. In short, both her own activity, and-the supine lethargy of those whom she con∣ducted united to make way for her unlimited authority. Now, indeed, a more limited rule might have secured obedience, and maintained a regularity. The ladies were but little struck with the glare of objects on each side the way. One alone I must except, whom I beheld look wishfully, with a retorted eye, towards the golden ore washed down by the torrents. The governess re∣presented, in the strongest terms, that the materials could not be imported into the realms they were about to enter. That, were this even the case, they could be there of no importance. However, she had not extir∣pated the bias of this craving dame, when they ap∣proached the temple to which I formerly alluded.</P>
<P>The temple stood upon a lofty hill, half encircled with trees of never-fading verdure. Between the milk-white columns (which were of the Dorick order, the bases gilt, as also the capitals) a blaze of glory issued, of such superior lustre, that none beside the governess was able to approach it. She, indeed, with a dejected counte∣nance, drew near unto the goddess; who gently waved her hand in the way of salutation.</P>
<P>The matron seemed less dazzled, than delighted with her excessive beauty. She accosted her with reverence, and with much diffidence began to mention their pre∣tension to her favour. <Q>“She must own, she had been too remiss in the beginning of her government; she hoped it would be attributed to inexperience in the subtle wiles of her fellow-travellers. She flattered
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
herself, that her severity towards the conclusion of her journey might in some sort make atonement for her misbehaviour in the beginning. Lastly, that she sometimes found it impossible to hear the dictates of the Goddess amid the clamours of her pupils, and the din of their persuasions.”</Q></P>
<P>To this the goddess may reply.</P>
<P>"You have heard," said she, <Q>“no doubt that the favours I bestow, are by no means consistent with a state of inactivity. The only time when you were allowed an opportunity to deserve them, was the time when your pupils were the most refractory and per∣verse. The honours you expect in my court are pro∣portioned to the difficulty of a good undertaking. May you, hereafter, partake them, in reward of your more vigorous conduct: for the present, you are little entitled to any recompence from me. As to your pupils, I observe, they have passed sentence upon themselves.”</Q></P>
<P>At this instant of time the bell rung for supper, and awaked me: I found the gardener by my side, prepared to plant a parcel of trees; and that I had slumbered away the hours, in which I should have given him suit∣able directions.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Unconnected Thoughts on Gardening.</HEAD>
<P>GARDENING may be divided into three species—kitchen-gardening—parterre-gardening—and landscape, or picturesque-gardening: which latter is the subject intended in the following pages—It consists in pleasing the imagination by scenes of grandeur, beauty, or variety. Convenience merely has no share here, any farther than as it pleases the imagination.</P>
<P>Perhaps the division of the pleasures of imagination, according as they are struck by the great, the various, and the beautiful, may be accurate enough for my pre∣sent purpose: why each of them affects us with plea∣sure
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
may be traced in other authors. See Burke, Hutchinson, Gerard, the theory of agreeable sensations, &amp;c <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Garden-scenes may perhaps be divided into the sublime, the beautiful, and the melancholy or pensive; to which last I know not but we may assign a middle place betwixt the former two, as being in some sort composed of both. See Burke's Sublime.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There seems however to be some objects, which afford a pleasure not reducible to either of the foregoing heads. A ruin, for instance, may be neither new to us, nor ma∣jestic, nor beautiful, yet afford that pleasing melancholy which proceeds from a reflexion on decayed magnifi∣cence. For this reason, an able gardener should avail himself of objects, perhaps, not very striking; if they serve to connect ideas, that convey reflexions of the pleasing kind.</P>
<P>Objects should indeed be less calculated to strike the immediate eye, than the judgement or well-formed imagination; as in painting.</P>
<P>It is no objection to the pleasure of novelty, that it makes an ugly object more disagreeable. It is enough that it produces a superiority betwixt things in other respects equal. It seems, on some occasions, to go even farther. Are there not broken rocks and rugged grounds, to which we can hardly attribute either beau∣ty or grandeur; and yet when introduced near an ex∣tent of lawn, impart a pleasure equal to more shapely scenes? Thus a series of lawn, though ever so beauti∣ful, may satiate and cloy, unless the eye passes to them from wilder scenes; and then they acquire the grace of novelty.</P>
<P>Variety appears to me to derive good part of its ef∣fect from novelty; as the eye, passing from one form or colour, to a form or colour of a different kind, finds a degree of novelty in its present object, which affords im∣mediate satisfaction.</P>
<P>Variety however, in some instances, may be carried to such excess as to lose its whole effect. I have observed
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
ceilings so crammed with stucco-ornaments; that, al∣though of the most different kinds, they have produced an uniformity. A sufficient quantity of undecorated space is necessary to exhibit such decorations to advan∣tage.</P>
<P>Ground should first be considered with an eye to its peculiar character: whether it be the grand, the savage, the melancholy, the horrid, or the beautiful. As one or other of these characters prevail, one may somewhat strengthen its effect, by allowing every part some deno∣mination, and then supporting its title by suitable ap∣pendages—For instance, The lover's walk may have as∣signation seats, with proper mottoes—urns to faithful lovers—trophies, garlands, &amp;c. by means of art.</P>
<P>What an advantage must some Italian seats derive from the circumstance of being situate on ground men∣tioned in the classics? And, even in England, wherever a park or garden happens to have been the scene of any event in history, one would surely avail one's self of that circumstance, to make it more interesting to the imagi∣nation. Mottoes should allude to it, columns, &amp;c. re∣cord it; verses moralize upon it; and curiosity receive its share of pleasure.</P>
<P>In designing a house and gardens, it is happy when there is an opportunity of maintaining a subordination of parts; the house so luckily placed as to exhibit a view of the whole design. I have sometimes thought that there was room for it to resemble an epic or dramatic poem. It is rather to be wished than required, that the more striking scenes may succeed those which are less so.</P>
<P>Taste depends much upon temper. Some prefer Ti∣bullus to Virgil, and Virgil to Homer—Hagley to Persfield, and Persfield to the Welsh mountains. This occasions the different preferences that are given to situ∣ations—A garden strikes us most, where the grand and the pleasing succeed, not intermingle with, each other.</P>
<P>I believe, however, the sublime has generally a deeper effect than the merely beautiful.</P>
<P>I use the words landscape and prospect, the former as
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
expressive of home scenes, the latter of distant images. Prospects should take in the blue distant hills; but never so remotely, that they be not distinguishable from clouds. Yet this mere extent is what the vulgar value.</P>
<P>Landscape should contain variety enough to form a picture upon canvas; and this is no bad test, as I think the landscape painter is the gardener's best designer. The eye requires a sort of balance here; but not so as to encroach upon probable nature. A wood, or hill, may balance a house or obelisk; for exactness would be displeasing. We form our notions from what we have seen; and though, could we comprehend the universe, we might perhaps find it uniformly regular; yet the portions that we see of it, habituate our fancy to the contrary.</P>
<P>The eye should always look rather down upon water: customary nature makes this requisite. I know nothing more sensibly displeasing than Mr. T—'s flat ground betwixt his terrace and his water.</P>
<P>It is not easy to account for the fondness of former times for straight lined avenues to their houses; straight-lined walks through their woods; and, in short, every kind of straight-line; where the foot is to travel over, what the eye has done before. This cir∣cumstance, is one objection. Another, somewhat of the same kind, is the repetition of the same object, tree after tree, for a length of way together. A third is, that this identity is purchased by the loss of that varie∣ty, which the natural country supplies every where, in a greater or less degree. To stand still and survey such ave∣nues, may afford some slender satisfaction, through the change derived some perspective; but to move on con∣tinually and find no change of scene in the least attend∣ant on our change of place, must give actual pain to a person of taste. For such an one to be condemned to pass along the famous vista <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Montesquieu, on Taste.</NOTE> from Moscow to Peters∣burg, or that other from Arga to Lahor in India, must be as disagreeable a sentence, as to be condenmed to la∣bour at the gallies. I conceived some idea of the sen∣sation
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
he must feel, from walking but a few minutes, immured, betwixt Lord D—'s high-shorn yew-hedges; which run exactly parellel, at the distance of about ten feet; and are contrived perfectly to exclude all kind of objects whatsoever.</P>
<P>When a building, or other object, has been once view∣ed from its proper point, the foot should never travel to it by the same path, which the eye has travelled over be∣fore. Lose the object, and draw nigh, obliquely.</P>
<P>The side-trees in vistas should be so circumstanced as to afford a probability that they grew by nature.</P>
<P>Ruinated structures appear to derive their power of ple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing, from the irregularity of surface, which is va∣riety; and the latitude they afford the imagination, to conceive an enlargement of their dimensions, or to re∣collect any events or circumstances appertaining to their pristine grandeur, so far as concerns grandeur and so∣lemnity. The breaks in them should be as bold and abrupt as possible.—If mere beauty be aimed at (which however is not their chief excellence) the waving line, with more easy transitions, will become of greater im∣portance—Events relating to them may be simulated by numberless little artifices; but it is ever to be remem∣bered, that high hills and sudden descents are most suit∣able to castles; and fertile vales, near wood and water, most imitative of the usual situation for abbeys and reli∣gious houses; large oaks, in particular, are essential to these latter;</P>
<Q><L>"Whose branching arms, and reverend height,</L>
<L>"Admit a dim religious light."</L></Q>
<P>A cottage is a pleasing object, partly on account of the variety it may introduce; on account of the tranquilli∣ty that seems to reign there; and perhaps (I am some∣what afraid) on account of the pride of human nature:</P>
<Q>"Longi alterius spectare laborem."</Q>
<P>In a scene presented to the eye, objects should never lie
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
so much to the right or left, as to give it any uneasiness in the examination. Sometimes, however, it may be better to admit valuable objects even with this disad∣vantage. They should else never be seen beyond a cer∣tain angle. The eye must be easy, before it can be pleased.</P>
<P>No mere slope from one side to the other can be agree∣able ground: The eye requires a balance—i. e. a de∣gree of uniformity: but this may be otherwise effected, and the rule should be understood with some limitation.</P>
<Q><L>"—Each alley has its brother,</L>
<L>"And half the plat-form just reflects the other."</L></Q>
<P>Let us examine what may be said in favour of that regularity which Mr. Pope exposes. Might he not seemingly as well object to the disposition of an human face, because it has an eye or cheek, that is the very picture of its companion? Or does not providence, who has observed this regularity in the external struc∣ture of our bodies and disregarded it within, seem to consider it as a beauty? The arms, the limbs, and the several parts of them correspond, but it is not the same case with the thorax a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the abdomen. I believe one is generally solicitous for a kind of balance in a land∣scape; and, if I am not mistaken, the painters generally furnish one: a building for instance on one side, con∣trasted by a group of trees, a large oak, or a rising hill on the other. Whence then does this taste proceed, but from the love we bear to regularity in persection? Af∣ter all, in regard to gardens, the shape of ground, the disposition of trees, and the figure of water, must be sa∣cred to nature; and no forms must be allowed that make a discovery of art.</P>
<P>All trees have a character analogous to that of men: oaks are in all respects the perfect image of the manly character: in former times I should have said, and in present times I think I am authorized to say, the British one. As a brave man is not suddenly either elated by prosperity or depressed by adversity, so the oak displays
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
not its verdure on the sun's first approach; nor drops it, on his first departure. Add to this its majestic appear∣ance, the rough grandeur of its bark, and the wide pro∣tection of its branches.</P>
<P>A large, branching, aged oak, is perhaps the most venerable of all inanimate objects.</P>
<P>Urns are more solemn, if large and plain; more beau∣tiful, if less and ornamented. Solemnity is perhaps their point, and the situation of them should still co-operate with it.</P>
<P>By the way, I wonder that lead statues are not more in vogue in our modern gardens. Though they may not express the finer lines of an human body, yet they seem perfectly well calculated, on account of their durg∣tion, to embelish landscapes, were they some degrees in∣ferior to what we generally behold. A statue in a room challenges examination, and is to be examined critically as a statue. A statue in a garden is to be considered as one part of a scene or landscape; the minuter touches are no more essential to it, than a good landscape paint∣er would esteem them were he to represent a statue in his picture.</P>
<P>Apparent art, in its proper province, is almost as im∣portant as im∣portant as apparent nature. They contrast agreeably; but their provinces ever should be kept distinct.</P>
<P>Some artificial beauties are so dextrously managed, that one cannot but conceive them natural; some natu∣ral ones so extremely fortunate, that one is ready to swear they are artificial.</P>
<P>Concerning scenes, the more uncommon they appear, the better, provided they form a picture, and include nothing that pretends to be of nature's production, and is not. The shape of ground, the site of trees, and the fall of water, nature's province. Whatever thwarts her is treason.</P>
<P>On the other hand, buildings and the works of art need have no other reference to nature than that they af∣ford the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> with which the human mind is de∣lighted.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="79"/>
Art should never be allowed to set a foot in the pro∣vince of nature, otherwise than clandestinely and by night. Whenever she is allowed to appear here, and men begin to compromise the difference—night, gothic∣ism, confusion, and absolute chaos, are come again.</P>
<P>To see one's urns, obelisks, and waterfalls laid open; the nakedness of our beloved mistresses, the Naiads and the Dryads, exposed by that ruffian Winter to universal observation; is a severity scarcely to be supported by the help of blazing hearths, cheerful companions, and a bottle of the most grateful burgundy.</P>
<P>The works of a person that builds, begin immedi∣ately to decay; while those of him who plants begin di∣rectly to improve. In this, planting promises a more lasting pleasure, than building; which, were it to re∣main in equal perfection, would at best begin to moulder and want repairs in imagination. Now trees have a circumstance that suits our taste, and that is annual va∣riety. It is inconvenient indeed, if they cause our love of life to take root and flourish with them; whereas the very sameness of our structures will, without the help of dilapidation, serve to wean us from our attachment to them.</P>
<P>It is a custom in some countries to condemn the cha∣racters of those (after death) that have neither planted a tree, nor begot a child.</P>
<P>The taste of the citizen and of the mere peasant are in all respects the same. The former gilds his balls; paints his stonework and statues white; plants his trees in lines or circles; cuts his yew-trees four-square or conic; or gives them, what he can, of the resemblance of birds, or bears, or men; squirts up his rivulets in jetteaus; in short, admires no part of nature, but her ductility; exhibits every thing that is glaring, that implies expence, or that effects a surprize because it is unnatural. The peasant is his admirer.</P>
<P>It is always to be remembered in gardening, that sublimity or magnificience, and beauty or variety, are very different things. Every scene we see in nature is either tame and insipid; or compounded of those. It
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
often happens that the same ground may receive from art, either certain degrees of sublimity and magnificance, or certain degrees of variety and beauty; or a mixture of each kind. In this case it remains to be considered in which light they can be rendered most remarkable, whether as objects of beauty or magnificence. Even the temper of the proprietor should not perhaps be whol∣ly disregarded: for certain complexions of soul will pre∣fer an orange tree or a myrtle, to an oak or cedar. However, this should not induce a gardener to parcel out a lawn into knots of shrubbery; or invest a moun∣tain with a garb of roses. This would be like dressing a giant in a sarsenet gown, or a Saracen's head in a Brussel's night-cap. Indeed the small and circular clumps of firs, which I see planted upon some fine large swells, put me often in mind of a coronet placed on an elephant or camel's back. I say, a gardener should not do this, any more than a poet should attempt to write of the king of Prussia in the style of Philips. On the other side, what would become of Lesbia's spar∣row, should it be treated in the same language with the anger of Achilles?</P>
<P>Gardeners may be divided into three sorts, the land∣scape gardener, the paterre gardener, and the kitchen gardener, agreeably to our first division of gardens.</P>
<P>I have used the word landscape-gardeners; because, in pursuance of our present taste in gardening, every good painter of landscape appears to me the most proper de∣signer. The misfortune of it is, that these painters are apt to regard the execution of their work, much more than the choice of subject.</P>
<P>The art of distancing and approximating, comes tru∣ly within their sphere: the former by the gradual dimi∣nution of distinctness, and of size; the latter by the re∣verse. A straight-lined avenue that is widened in front, and planted there with yew trees, then firs, then with trees more and more fady, till they end in the almond-willow, or silver osier; will produce a very remarkable deception of the former kind; which deception will be encreased, if the nearer dark trees are proportionable
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
and truly larger than those at the end of the avenue that are more fady.</P>
<P>To distance a building, plant as near as you can to it, two or three circles of different-coloured greens—Ever-greens are best for all such purposes—Suppose the outer one of holly, and the next of laurel, &amp;c. The consequence will be that the imagination immediately allows a space betwixt these circles, and another betwixt the house and them; and as the imagined space is deter∣minate, if your building be dim-coloured, it will not appear inconsiderable. The imagination is a greater magnifier than a microscope glass. And on this head, I have known some instances, where, by shewing inter∣mediate ground, the distance has appeared less, than while an hedge or grove concealed it.</P>
<P>Hedges, appearing as such, are universally bad. They discover art in nature's province.</P>
<P>Trees in hedges partake of their artificiality, and be∣come a part of them. There is no more sudden and ob∣vious improvement, than an hedge removed, and the trees remaining; yet not in such manner as to mark out the former hedge.</P>
<P>Water should ever appear, as an irregular lake, or winding stream.</P>
<P>Islands give beauty, if the water be adequate; but lessen grandeur through variety.</P>
<P>It was the wise remark of some sagacious observer, that familiarity is for the most part productive of con∣tempt. Graceless offspring of so amiable a parent! Unfortunate beings that we are, whose enjoyments must be either checked, or prove destructive of themselves. Our passions are permitted to sip a little pleasure: but are extinguished by indulgence, like a lamp overw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Im∣ed with oil. Hence we neglect the beauty with which we have been intimate; nor would any addition it could receive, prove an equivalent for the advantage it derived from the first impression. Thus, negligent of graces that have the merit of reality, we too often prefer imaginary ones that have only the charm of no∣velty: and hence we may account, in general, for the
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
preference of art to nature, in our old-fashioned gardens.</P>
<P>Art, indeed, is often requisite to collect and epito∣mize the beauties of nature; but should never be suf∣fered to set her mark upon them; I mean, in regard to those articles that are of nature's province; the shaping of ground, the planting of trees, and the disposition of lakes and rivulets. Many more particulars will soon occur, which, however, she is allowed to regulate, somewhat clandestinely, upon the following account—Man is not capable of comprehending the universe at one survey. Had he faculties equal to this, he might well be censured for any minute regulations of his own. It were the same, as if, in his present situation, he strove to find amusement in contriving the fabric of an ant's nest, or the partitions of a bee-hive. But we are placed in the corner of a sphere; endued neither with or∣gans, nor allowed a station, proper to give us an univer∣sal view or to exhibit to us the variety, the orderly propor∣tions, and dispositions of the system. We perceive many breaks and blemishes, several neglected and un∣variegated placed in the part; which, in the whole, would appear either imperceptible, or beautiful. And we might as rationally expect a snail to be satisfied with the beauty of our parterres, slopes, and terraces—or an ant to prefer our buildings to her own orderly range of granaries, as that man should be satisfied, without a single thought that he can improve the spot that falls to his share. But, though art be necessary for collecting nature's beauties, by what reason is she authorized to thwart and to oppose her? Why fantastically endeavour to humanize those vegetables, of which nature, discreet nature, thought it proper to make trees? Why endow the vegetable bird with wings, which nature has made momentarily dependent upon the soil? Here art seems very affectedly to make a display of that industry, which it is her glory to conceal. The stone which represents an asterisk, is valued only on account of its natural produc∣tion: Nor do we view with pleasure the laboured cary∣ings and futile diligence of gothic artists. We view with much more satisfaction some plain Grecian fabric,
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
where art, indeed, has been equally, but less visibly, industrious. It is thus we, indeed, admire the shining texture of the silkworm; but we loath the puny author, when she thinks proper to emerge; and to disgust us with the appearance of so vile a grub.</P>
<P>But this is merely true in regard to the particulars of nature's province; wherein art can only appear as the most abject vassal, and had, therefore, better not appear at all. The case is different where she has the direction of buildings, useful or ornamental; or perhaps, claims as much honour from temples, as the deities to whom they are inscribed. Here then it is his interest to be seen as much as possible: and, though nature appear doubly beautiful by the contrast her structures furnish, it is not easy for her to confer a benefit which nature, on her side, will not repay.</P>
<P>A rural scene to me is never perfect without the ad∣dition of some kind of building: indeed I have known a scar of rock-work, in great measure, supply the de∣ficiency.</P>
<P>In gardening, it is no small point to enforce either grandeur or beauty by surprize; for instance, by abrupt transition from their contraries—but to lay a stress upon surprize only; for example, on the surprize occasioned by an aha! without including any nobler purpose; is a symptom of bad taste, and a violent fondness for mere concetto.</P>
<P>Grandeur and beauty are so very opposite, that you often diminish the one as you encrease the other. Va∣riety is most a-kin to the latter, simplicity to the former.</P>
<P>Suppose a large hill varied, by art, with large patches of different-coloured clumps, scars of rocks, chalk-quarries, villages, or farm-houses; you will have, perhaps, a more beautiful scene, but much less grand than it was before.</P>
<P>In many instances, it is most eligible to compound your scene of beauty and grandeur—Suppose a magnifi¦cent swell arising out of a well-variegated valley; it would be disadvantageous to encrease its beauty, by means destructive to its magnificence.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="84"/>
There may possibly, but there seldom happens to be any occasion to fill up valleys, with trees or otherwise. It is for the most part the gardener's business to remove trees, or aught that fills up the low ground; and to give, as far as nature allows, an artificial eminence to the high.</P>
<P>The hedge-row apple-trees in Herefordshire afford a most beautiful scenery, at the time they are in blossom: but the prospect would be really grander, did it consist of simple foliage. For the same reason, a large oak (or beech) in autumn, is a grander object than the same in spring. The sprightly green is then obfuscated.</P>
<P>Smoothness and easy transitions are no small ingre∣dient in the beautiful; abrupt and rectangular breaks have more of the nature of the sublime. Thus a taper∣ing spire is, perhaps, a more beautiful object than a tower, which is grander.</P>
<P>Many of the different opinions relating to the pre∣ference to be given to seats, villas, &amp;c. are owing to want of distinction betwixt the beautiful and the mag∣nificent. Both the former and the latter please; but there are imaginations particularly adapted to the one, and to the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Addison thought an open uninclosed champain country, formed the best landscape. Somewhat here is to be considered. Large, unvariegated, simple objects have the best pretensions to sublimity; a large mountain, whose sides are unvaried with objects, is grander than one with infinite variety: but then its beauty is propor∣tionably less.</P>
<P>However, I think a plain space near the eye gives it a kind of liberty it loves: and then the picture, whe∣ther you chuse the grand or beautiful, should be held up at its proper distance. Variety is the principal in∣gredient in beauty; and simplicity is essential to gran∣deur.</P>
<P>Offensive objects, at a proper distance, acquire even a degree of beauty: for instance, stubble fallow ground—</P>

<P>PERHAPS men of the most different sects and par∣ties very frequently think the same; only vary in their phrase and language. At least, if one examines their first principles, which very often coincide, it were a point of prudence, as well as candour, to consider the rest as nothing more.</P>

<P>The most animated social pleasure, that I can con∣ceive, may be, perhaps, felt by a general after a suc∣cessful engag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment, or in it: I mean by such command∣ers as have souls equal to their occupation. This, how∣ever, seems paradoxical, and requires some explanation.</P>
<P>Resistance to the reigning powers is justifiable, upon a conviction that their government is inconsistent with the good of the subject; that our interposition tends to establish better measures; and this without a probability of occasioning evils that may overbalance them. But these considerations must never be separated.</P>
<P>People are, perhaps, more vicious in towns, because they have fewer natural objects there, to employ their attention—or admiration: likewise because one vicious character tends to encourage and keep another in coun∣tenance. However it be, excluding accidental circum∣stances, I believe the largest cities are the most vicious of all others.</P>
<P>Laws are generally found to be nets of such a texture, as the little creep through, the great break through, and the middle size are alone entangled in.</P>
<P>Though I have no sort of inclination to vindicate the late rebellion, yet I am led by candour to make some dis∣tinction between the immorality of its abettors, and the illegality of their offence. My Lord Hardwick, in his condemnation-speech, remarks with great propriety, that the laws of all nations have adjudged rebellion to be the worst of crimes. And in regard to civil societies, I be∣lieve there are none but madmen will dispute it. But surely with regard to conscience, erroneous judgements and ill-grounded convictions may render it some people's
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
duty. Sin does not consist in any deviation from receiv∣ed opinion; it does not depend upon the understanding, but the will. Now, if it appear that a man's opinion has happened to misplace his duty; and this opinion has not been owing to any vicious desire of indulging his appetites—In short, if his own reason, liable to err, have biased his will; rather than his will any way con∣tributed to bias and deprave his reason, he will, perhaps, appear guilty before none, beside an earthly tribunal.</P>
<P>A person's right to resist, depends upon a conviction, that the government is ill-managed; that others have more claim to manage it, or will administer it better: that he, by his resistance, can introduce a change to its advantage, and this without any consequential evils that will bear proportion to the said advantage.</P>
<P>Whether this were not in appearance the case of Bal∣merino, I will not presume to say: how conceived, or from what delusion sprung.

<P N="24">XXIV. Had I a fortune of eight or ten thousand pounds a year, I would methinks make myself a neighbourhood.

These would I people with a select number of well-chosen friends, assigning to each annually the sum of two hun∣dred pounds for life. The salary should be irrevocable, in order to give them independency.

XXVII. What pleasure it is to pay ones debts! I remember to have heard Sir T. Lyttleton make the same observation. It seems to flow from a combination of circumstances, each of which is productive of pleasure. In the first place, it removes that uneasiness, which a true spirit feels from dependence and obligation. It affords plea∣sure to the creditor, and therefore gratifies our social affection: it promotes that future confidence, which is so very interesting to an honest mind: it opens a prospect of being readily supplied with what we want on future occasions: it leaves a consciousness of our own virtue: and it is a measure we know to be right, both in point of justice and of sound oeconomy. Finally, it is a main support of simple reputation.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. It is a maxim with me (and I would recommend it to others also, upon the score of prudence) whenever I lose a person's friendship, who generally commences enemy, to engage a fresh friend in his place. And this may be best effected by bringing over some of one's enemies; by which means one is a gainer, having the same number of friends at least, if not an enemy the less. Such a method of proceeding, should, I think, be as regularly observed, as the distribution of vacant ribbons, upon the death of knights of the garter.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It has been a maxim with me to admit of an easy re∣conciliation with a person, whose offence proceeded from no depravity of heart: but where I was convinced it did so, to forego, for my own sake, all opportunities of re∣venge: to forget the persons of my enemies as much as I was able, and to call to remembrance, in their place, the more pleasing idea of my friends. I am convinced that I have derived no small share of happiness from this principle.</P>

XXX. I have been formerly so silly as to hope, that, every servant I had might be made a friend: I am now con∣vinced that the nature of servitude generally bears a contrary tendency. Peoples characters are to be chiefly collected from their education and place in life: birth itself does but little. Kings in general are born with the same propensities as other men; but yet it is pro∣bable, that from the licence and flattery that attends their education, that they will be more haughty, more luxurious, and more subjected to their passions, than any men beside. I question not but there are many at∣torneys born with open and honest hearts: but I know not one, that has had the least practice, who is not selfish, trickish, and disingenuous. So it is the nature of servitude to discard all generous motives of obedi∣ence; and to point out no other than those scoundrel ones of interest and fear. There are however some ex∣ceptions to this rule, which I know by my own ex∣perience.</P>

<HEAD>On Dress.</HEAD>
<P>DRESS, like writing, should never appear the effect of too much study and application. On this ac∣count, I have seen parts of dress, in themselves ex∣tremely beautiful, which at the same time subject the wearer to the character of foppishness and affectation.</P>
<P N="2">II. A man's dress in the former part of life should rather tend to set off his person, than to express riches, rank or dignity: in the latter, the reverse.</P>
<P N="3">III. Extreme elegance in liveries, I mean such as is ex∣pressed by the more languid colours, is altogether ab∣surd.

They ought to be rather gawdy than genteel; if for no other reason, yet for this, that elegance may more strongly distinguish the appearance of the gentleman.</P>

<P N="9">IX. Simplicity can scarce be carried too far: provided it be not so singular as to excite a degree of ridicule. The same caution may be requisite in regard to the value of your dress: though splendor be not necessary, you must remove all appearance of poverty: the ladies being rarely enough sagacious to acknowledge beauty through
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
the disguise of poverty. Indeed, I believe sometimes they mistake grandeur of dress, for beauty of person.</P>
<P N="10">X. A person's manner is never easy, whilst he feels a con∣sciousness that he is fine. The country-fellow, consider∣ed in some lights, appears genteel; but it is not when be is dressed on Sundays, with a large nose-gay in his bosom. It is when he is reaping, making hay, or when he is hedging in his hurden frock. It is then he acts with ease, and thinks himself equal to his apparel.</P>
<P N="11">XI. When a man has run all lengths himself with regard to dress, there is but one means remaining, which can add to his appearance. And this consists in having re∣course to the utmost plainness of his own apparel, and at the same time richly garnishing his footman or his horse. Let the servant appear as fine as ever you please, the world must always consider the master as his supe∣rior. And this is that peculiar excellence so much ad∣mired in the best painters as well as poets; Raphael as well as Virgil: where somewhat is left to be sup∣plied by the spectator's and reader's imagination.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Methinks, apparel should be rich in the same propor∣tion as it is gay: it otherwise carries the appearance of somewhat unsubstantial: in other words, of a greater desire than ability to make a figure.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Persons are oftentimes misled in regard to their choice of dress, by attending to the beauty of colours, rather than selecting such colours as may encrease their own beauty.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. I cannot see why a person should be esteemed haughty, on account of his taste for fiue cloaths; any more than
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
one who discovers a fondness for birds, flowers, moths, or butterflies. Imagination influences both to seek amusement in glowing colours; only the former endeav∣ours to give them a nearer relation to himself. It ap∣pears to me, that a person may love splendor without any degree of pride; which is never connected with this taste but when a person demands homage on account of the finery he exhibits. Then it ceases to be taste, and commences mere ambition. Yet the world is not enough candid to make this essential distinction.</P>
<P N="15">XV. The first instance an officer gives you of his courage, consists in waring cloaths infinitely superior to his rank.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Men of quality never appear more amiable than when their dress is plain. Their birth, rank, title, and its appendages, are at best invidious; and as they do not need the assistance of dress, so, by their disclaiming the advantage of it, they make their superiority sit more easy. It is otherwise with such as depend alone on personal merit; and it was from-hence, I presume, that Quin asserted he could not afford to go plain.</P>

<P N="27">XXVII. A preface very frequently contains such a piece of criticism, as tends to countenance and establish the pecu∣liarities of the piece.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. I hate a style, as I do a garden, that is wholly flat and regular; that slides along like an eel, and never rises to what one can call an inequality.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It is obvious to discover that imperfections of one kind have a visible tendency to produce perfections of another. Mr. Pope's bodily disadvantages must incline him to a more laborious cultivation of his talent, with∣out which he foresaw that he must have languished in obscurity. The advantages of person are a good deal essential to popularity in the grave world as well as the gay. Mr. Pope, by an unwearied application to poetry, became not only the favourite of the learned, but also of the ladies.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Pope, I think, never once mentions Prior; though Prior speaks so handsomely of Pope in his Alma. One might imagine that the latter, indebted as he was to the former for such numberless beauties, should have readily repaid this poetical obligation. This can only
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
be imputed to pride or party-cunning. In other words, to some modification of selfishness.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Virgil never mentions Horace, though indebted to him for two very well-natured compliments.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. Pope feems to me the most correct writer since Virgil; the greatest genius only, since Dryden.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. No one was ever more fortunate than Mr. Pope in a judicious choice of his poetical subjects.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. Pope's talent lay remarkably in what one may natu∣rally enough term the condensation of thoughts. I think, no other English poet ever brought so much sense into the same number of lines with equal smoothness, ease, and poetical beauty. Let him who doubts of this peruse his Essay on Man with attention. Perhaps, this was a talent from which he could not easily have swerv∣ed: perhaps, he could not have sufficiently rarefied his thoughts to produce that flimziness which is required in a ballad or love-song. His monster of Ragusa and his translations from Chaucer have some little tendency to invalidate this observation.</P>
<P N="35">XXXV. I durst not have censured Mr. Pope's writings in his life-time, you say. True. A writer surrounded with all his fame, engaging with another that is hardly known, is a man in armour attacking another in his night-gown and slippers.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI. Pope's religion is often found very advantageous to his descriptive talents, as it is no doubt embellished with
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
the most pompous scenes and ostentatious imagery: for instance,</P>
<Q>"When from the censer clouds of, &amp;c."</Q>
<P N="37">XXXVII. Pope has made the utmost advantage of alliteration, re∣gulating it by the pause with the utmost success:</P>
<Q>"Die and endow a college or a cat," &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q>
<P>It is an easy kind of beaty. Dryden seems to have borrowed it from Spenser.</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. Pope has published fewer foibles than any other poet that is equally voluminous.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. It is no doubt extremely possible to form an English prosody; but to a good ear it were almost superfluous, and to a bad one useless; this last being, I believe, never joined with a poetic genius. It may be joined with wit; it may be connected with sound judgement: but is surely never united with taste, which is the life and foul of poetry.</P>
<P N="40">XL. Rhymes, in elegant poetry, should consist of syllables that are long in pronunciation: <Q>such as “are, ear, ire, ore, your;”</Q> in which a nice ear will find more agree∣ableness than in these "gnat, net, knit, knot, nut."</P>
<P N="41">XLI, There is a vast beauty (to me) in using a word of a particular nature in the eighth and ninth syllables of an English verse. I mean, what is virtually a dactyl. For instance,</P>
<Q>"And pikes, the tyrants of the watry plains."</Q>
<P>Let any person of an ear substitute "liquid" instead of "watry," and he will find the disadvantage. Mr.
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
Pope (who has improved our versification through a ju∣dicious disposition of the pause) seems not enough aware of this beauty.</P>
<P N="42">XLII. As to the srequent use of alliteration, it has probably had its day.</P>
<P N="43">XLIII. It has ever a good effect when the stress of the thought is laid upon that word which the voice most na∣turally pronounces with an emphasis.</P>
<Q><L>"I nunc &amp; versus tecum meditare," &amp;c.</L>
<P>HOR.</P></Q>
<Q><L>"Quam vellent aethere in alto</L>
<L>"Nunc &amp; pauperiem," &amp;c.</L>
<P>VIRG.</P></Q>
<Q><L>"O fortunati, quorum jam moenia, &amp;c.</L>
<P>VIRG.</P></Q>
<Q><L>"At regina gravi jamdudum," &amp;c.</L>
<P>VIRG.</P></Q>
<P>Virgil, whose very metre appears to affect one's passions, was a master of this secret.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. There are numbers in the world, who do not want sense, to make a figure; so much as an opinion of their own abilities, to put them upon recording their observ∣ations, and allowing them the same importance which they do to those which others print.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. A good writer cannot with the utmost study produce some thoughts, which will flow from a bad one with ease and precipitation. The reverse is also true. A bad writer, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. "Great wits have short memories" is a proverb; and as such has undoubtedly some foundation in nature. The case seems to be, that men of genius forget things of common concern, unimportant facts and circumstances,
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
which make no slight impression in every day minds. But sure it will be found that all wit depends on memory; i. e. on the recollection of passages, either to illustrate or contrast with any present occasion. It is probably the fate of a common understanding to forget the very things which the man of wit remembers. But an oblivion of those things which almost every one remembers renders his case the more remarkable, and this explains the mystery.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. Prudes allow no quarter to such ladies as have fallen a sacrifice to the gentle passions; either because them∣selves, being born away by the malignant ones, perhaps never felt the other so powerful as to occasion them any difficulty; or because no one has tempted them to trans∣gress that way themselves. It is the same case with some critics, with regard to the errors of ingenious writers.</P>
<P N="48">XLVIII. <Q>It seems with wit and good-nature, “Utrum horum mavis accipe.”</Q> Taste and good-nature are universally connected.</P>
<P N="49">XLIX. Voiture's compliments to ladies are honest on account of their excess.</P>
<P N="50">L. Poetry and consumptions are the most flattering of diseases.</P>
<P N="51">LI. Every person insensibly fixes upon some degree of re∣finement in his discourse, some measure of thought which he thinks worth exhibiting. It is wise to fix this pretty high, although it occasions one to talk the less.</P>
<P N="52"><PB N="97" REF="106"/>
LII. Some men use no other means to acquire respect, than by insisting on it; and it sometimes answers their purpose, as it does an highwayman's in regard to money.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. There is nothing exerts a genius so much as writing plays; the reason is, that the writer puts himself in the place of every person that speaks.</P>
<P N="54">LIV. Perfect characters in a poem make but little better figure than regular hills, perpendicular trees, uniform rocks, and level sheets of water, in the formation of a landscape. The reason is, they are not natural, and moreover want variety.</P>
<P N="55">LV. Trifles discover a character more than actions of im∣portance. In regard to the former, a person is off his guard, and thinks it not material to use disguise. It is, to me, no imperfect hint towards the discovery of a man's character, to say he looks as though you might be certain of finding a pin upon his sleeve.</P>
<P N="56">LVI. A grammarian speaks of first and second person: A poet of Celia and Corydon: A mathematician of A and B: a lawyer of Nokes and Styles. The very quin∣tessence of pedantry!</P>
<P N="57">LVII. Shakespear makes his very bombast answer his pur∣pose, by the persons he chuses to utter it.</P>
<P N="58">LVIII. A poet, till he arrives at thirty, can see no other good than a poetical reputation. About that aera, he begins to discover some other.</P>
<P N="59"><PB N="98" REF="107"/>
LIX. The plan of Spencer's Fairy-queen appears to me very imperfect. His imagination, though very exten∣sive, yet somewhat less so, perhaps, than is generally allowed; if one considers the facility of realizing and equipping forth the virtues and vices. His metre has some advantages, though, in many respects, exception∣able. His good-nature is visible through every part of his poem. His conjunction of the pagan and christian scheme (as he introduces the deities of both acting simultaneously) wholly inexcusable. Much art and judgement are discovered in parts, and but little in the whole. One may entertain some doubt whether the perusal of his monstrous descriptions be not as pre∣judicial to true taste, as it is advantageous to the extent of imagination. Spencer, to be sure, expands the last; but then he expands it beyond its due limits. After all, there are many favourite passages in his Fairy∣queen, which will be instances of a great and cultivated genius misapplied.</P>
<P N="60">LX. A poet, that fails in writing, becomes often a morose critic. The weak and insipid white wine makes at length excellent vinegar.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. People of fortune, perhaps, covet the acquaintance of established writers, not so much upon account of the social pleasure, as the credit of it: The former would induce them to chuse persons of less capacities, and tempers more conformable.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. Language is to the understanding what a genteel motion is to the body; a very great advantage. But a person may be superior to another in understanding, that has not an equal dignity of expression; and a man may boast an handsomer figure, that is inferior to another in regard to motion.</P>
<P N="63"><PB N="99" REF="108"/>
LXIII. The words "no more" have a singular pathos; re∣minding us at once of past pleasure and the future ex∣clusion of it.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. Every single observation that is published by a man of genius, be it ever so trivial, should be esteemed of importance; because he speaks from his own impressions; whereas common men publish common things, which they have, perhaps, gleaned from frivolous writers.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. It is providential that our affection diminishes in pro∣portion as our friends power encreases. Affection is of less importance whenever a person can support himself. It is on this account that younger brothers are often be∣loved more than their elders; and that Benjamin is the favourite. We may trace the same law throughout the animal creation.</P>
<P N="66">LXVI. The time of life when fancy predominates, is youth; the season when judgement decides best, is age. Poets, therefore, are always, in respect of their disposition, younger than other persons: a circumstance that gives the latter part of their lives some inconsistency. The cool phlegmatic tribe discover it in the former.</P>
<P N="67">LXVII. One sometimes meets with instances of genteel abrup∣tion in writers; but I wonder it is not used more fre∣quently, as it has a prodigious effect upon the reader. For instance (after Falstaff's disappointment serving Shallow at Court)</P>
<Q><P>"Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pounds"—</P>
<P>SHAKESPEAR▪</P></Q>
<P>When Pandulph commanded Philip of France to pro∣ceed no farther against England, but to sheath the sword he had drawn at the Pope's own instigation.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="109"/>
<Q>“Now it had already cost Philip eighty thousand pound in preparations.”</Q></P>
<P>After the detail of king John's abject submission to the Pope's legate:</P>
<Q>"Now John was hated and despised before."</Q>
<P>But, perhaps, the strongest of all may be taken from the Scripture (Conclusion of a chapter in St. John)</P>
<Q>"Now Barabbas was a robber."—</Q>
<P N="68">LXVIII. A poet hurts himself by writing prose; as a race-horse hurts his motions by condescending to draw in a team.</P>
<P N="69">LXIX. The superior politeness of the French is in nothing more discernible than in the phrases used by them and us to express an affair being in agitation. The former says, "sur la tapis;" the latter "upon the anvil." Does it not shew also the sincerity and serious face with which we enter upon business, and the negligent and jaunty air with which they perform even the most important?</P>
<P N="70">LXX. There are two qualities adherent to the most inge∣nious authors: I do not mean without exception. A decent pride that will admit of no servility, and a sheep∣ish bashfulness that keeps their worth concealed: the "superbia quaesita meritis" and the "malus pudor" of Horace. The one will not suffer them to make ad∣vances to the great; the other disguises that merit for which the great would seek out them. Add to these the frequent indolence of speculative tempers.</P>
<P N="71">LXXI. A poetical genius seems the most elegant of youthful accomplishments; but it is entirely a youthful one.
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
Flights of fancy, gaiety of behaviour, sprightliness of dress, and a blooming aspect, conspire very amicably to their mutual embellishment; but the poetic talent has no more to do with age, than it would avail his Grace of Canterbury to have a knack at country dances, or a ge∣nius for a catch.</P>
<P N="72">LXXII. The most obsequious muses, like the fondest and most willing courtezans, seldom leave us any reason to boast much of their favours.</P>
<P N="73">LXXIII. If you write an original piece, you wonder no one ever thought of the best of subjects before you; if a translation, of the best authors.</P>
<P N="74">LXXIV. The ancient poets seem to value themselves greatly upon their power of perpetuating the fame of their co∣temporaries. Indeed the circumstance that has fixed their language, has been the only means of verifying some of their vain-glorious prophecies. Otherwise, the historians appear more equal to the task of conferring immortality. An history will live, though written ever so indifferently; and is generally less suspected, than the rhetoric of the muses.</P>
<P N="75">LXXV. I wonder authors do not discover how much more elegant it is to fix their name to the end of their preface, or any introductory address, than to the title-page. It is, perhaps, for the sake of an F. R. S. or an LL. D. at the end of it.</P>
<P>It should seem, the many lies, discernible in books of travels, may be owing to accounts collected from im∣proper people. Were one to give a character of the English, from what the vulgar act and believe, it would convey <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Missionaries clap a tail to every Indian nation that dislikes them.</NOTE> a strange idea of the English understanding;</P>
<P N="77"><PB N="102" REF="111"/>
LXXVII. Might not the poem on the Seasons have been ren∣dered more "uni," by giving out the design of nature in the beginning of winter, and afterwards considering all the varieties of seasons as means aiming at one end?</P>
<P N="78">LXXVIII. Critics must excuse me, if I compare them to certain animals called asses; who, by gnawing vines, originally taught the great advantage of pruning them.</P>
<P N="79">LXXIX. Every good poet includes a critic; the reverse will not hold.</P>
<P N="80">LXXX. We want a word to express the "Hospes" or "Hospita" of the ancients; among them, perhaps, the most respectable of all characters; yet with us trans∣lated "Host," which we apply also to an Innkeeper. Neither have we any word to express "Amica," as if we thought a woman always was somewhat more or less than a friend.</P>
<P N="81">LXXXI. I know not where any Latin author uses "Ignotos" otherwise than as "obscure Persons," as the modern phrase implies, "whom nobody knows." Yet it is used differently on Mrs. L—'s monument.</P>
<P N="82">LXXXII. The philosopher, who considered the world as one vast animal, could esteem himself no other than a louse upon the back of it.</P>
<P N="83">LXXXIII. Orators and stage-coachmen, when the one wants ar∣guments and the other a coat of arms, adorn their cause and their coaches with rhetoric and flower-pots.</P>
<P N="84"><PB N="103" REF="112"/>
LXXXIV. It is idle to be much affiduous in the perusal of infe∣rior poetry. Homer, Virgil, and Horace, give the true taste in composition; and a person's own imagination should be able to supply the rest.</P>
<P>In the same manner, it is superfluous to pursue infe∣rior degrees of fame. One truly splendid action, or one well-finished composition, includes more than all the re∣sults from more trivial performances. I mean this for persons who make fame their only motive.</P>
<P>Very few sentiments are proper to be put in person's mouth, during the first attack of grief.</P>
<P>Every thing disgusts, but simplicity; the scriptural writers describe their heroes using only some such phrase as this: "Alas! my brother!" "O Absalom my son! my son!" &amp;c. The lamentation of Saul over Jonathan is more diffuse, but at the same time entirely simple.</P>
<P>Angling is literally described by Martial:</P>
<Q>"—tremulâ piscem deducere setâ."</Q>
<P>From "Ictum foedus" seems to come the English phrase and custom of striking a bargain.</P>
<P>I like Ovid's Amours better than his Epistles. There seems a greater variety of natural thoughts: whereas, when one has read the subject of one of his epistles, one foresees what it will produce in a writer of his imagina∣tion.</P>
<P>The plan of his Epistles for the most part well de∣signed—The answers of Sabinus, nothing.</P>
<P>Necessity may be the mother of lucrative invention; but is the death of poetical.</P>
<P>If a person suspects his phrase to be somewhat too fa∣miliar and abject, it were proper he should accustom himself to compose in blank verse: but let him be much upon his guard against Ancient Pistol's phraseology.</P>
<P>Providence seems altogether impartial in the dispensation which bestows riches upon one and a contempt of riches upon.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="113"/>
Respect is the general end for which riches, power, place, title, and fame, are implicitly desired. When one is possessed of the end through any one of these means, is it not wholly unphilosophical to covet the re∣mainder?</P>
<P>Lord Shaftesbury, in the genteel management of some familiar ideas, seems to have no equal. He discovers an eloignment from vulgar phrases much becoming a person of quality. His sketches should be studied, like those of Raphael. His Enquiry is one of the shortest and clearest systems of morality.</P>
<P>The question is, whether you distinguish me, because you have better sense than other people; or whether you seem to have better sense than other people, because you distinguish me.</P>
<P>One feels the same kind of disgust in reading Roman history, which one does in novels, or even epic poetry. We too easily foresee to whom the victory will fall. The hero, the knight-errant, and the Roman, are too seldom overcome.</P>
<P>The elegance and dignity of the Romans is in nothing more conspicuous than in their answers to ambassadors.</P>
<P>There is an important omïssion in most of our gram∣mar-schools, through which what we read, either of fa∣bulous or real history, leaves either faint or confused impressions. I mean the neglect of old geographical maps. Were maps of ancient Greece, Sicily, Italy, &amp;c. in use there, the knowledge we there acquire would not want to be renewed afterwards, as is now generally the case.</P>
<P>A person of a pedantic turn will spend five years in translating, and contending for the beauties of, a worse poem than he might write in five weeks himself. There seem to be authors who wish to sacrifice their whole character of genius to that of learning.</P>
<P>Boileau has endeavoured to prove, in one of his ad∣mirable satires, that man has no manner of pretence to prefer his faculties before those of the brute creation. Oldham has translated him: my Lord Rochester has imi∣tated him: and even Mr. Pope declares,</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="114"/>
"That, reason raise o'er instinct how you can,</P>
<P>"In this 'tis God directs; in that 'tis man."</P>
<P>Indeed, the Essay on Man abounds with illustrations of this maxim; and it is amazing to find how many plausible reasons may be urged to support it. It seems evident that our itch of reasoning, and spirit of cu∣riosity, precludes more happiness than it can possibly ad∣vance. What numbers of diseases are entirely artificial things, far from the ability of a brute to contrive! We disrelish and deny ourselves cheap and natural gratifica∣tions, through speculative presciences and doubts about the future. We cannot discover the designs of our Creator. We should learn then of brutes to be easy under our ignorance, and happy in those objects that seem intended, obviously, for our happiness: not over∣look the flowers of the garden, and foolishly perplex ourselves with the intricacies of the labyrinth.</P>
<P>I wish but two editions of all books whatsoever. One of the simple text, published by a society of able hands: another with the various readings and remarks of the ablest commentators.</P>
<P>To endeavour, all one's days, to fortify our minds with learning and philosophy, is to spend so much in armour that one has nothing left to defend.</P>
<P>If one would think with philosophers, one must con∣verse but little with the vulgar. These, by their very number, will force a person into a fondness for appear∣ance, a love of money, a desire of power; and other plebeian passions: objects which they admire, because they have no share in, and have not learning to supply the place of experience.</P>
<P>Livy, the most elegant and principal of the Roman historians, was, perhaps, as superstitious as the most unlearned plebeian. We see, he never is destitute of appearances, accurately described and solemnly asserted, to support particular events by the interposition of ex∣ploded deities. The puerile attention to chicken-feed∣ing in a morning—And then a piece of gravity: "Parva sunt haec, sed parva ista non contemnenda; majores nostri maximam hanc rem fecerunt."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="115"/>
It appears from the Roman historians, that the Ro∣mans had a particular veneration for the fortunate. Their epithet "Felix" seems ever to imply a favourite of the gods. I am mistaken, or modern Rome has ge∣nerally acted in an opposite manner. Numbers amongst them have been canonized upon the single merit of mis∣fortunes.</P>
<P>How different appears ancient and modern dialogue, on account of superficial subjects upon which we now generally converse! add to this, the ceremonial of mo∣dern times, and the number of titles with which some kings clog and encumber conversation.</P>
<P>The celebrated boldness of an eastern metaphor is, I believe, sometimes allowed it for the inconsiderable simi∣litude it bears to its subject.</P>
<P>The style of letters, perhaps, should not rise higher, than the style of refined conversation.</P>
<P>Love-verses written without real passion, are often the most nauseous of all conceits. Those written from the heart will ever bring to mind that delightful season of youth, and poetry, and love.</P>
<P>Virgil gives one such excessive pleasure in his writings, beyond any other writer, by uniting the most perfect harmony of metre, with the most pleasing ideas or images:</P>
<Q>"Qualem virgineo demessum pollice florem;"</Q>
<P>And</P>
<Q>"Argentum Pariusve lapis"—</Q>
<P>With a thousand better instances.</P>
<P>Nothing tends so much to produce drunkenness, or even madness, as the frequent use of parenthesis in con∣versation.</P>
<P>Few greater images of impatience, than a general seeing his brave army over-matched and cut to pieces, and looking out continually to see his ally approach with forces to his assistance. See Shakespear.</P>

<P>SIMILES, drawn from odd circumstances and effects strangely accidental, bear a near relation to false wit. The best instance of the kind is that celebrated line of Waller:</P>
<Q>"He grasp'd at love, and fill'd his hand with bays."</Q>
<P>Virgil discovers less wit, and more taste, than any writer in the world—Some instances:</P>
<Q>"—longumque bibebat amorem."</Q>
<P><Q>What Lucretius says of the “edita doctrinae sapien∣tum templa”</Q>—"the temples of philosophers"—ap∣pears in no sense more applicable than to a snug and easy chariot:
<Q><L>"Dispicere unde queas alios, passimque videre</L>
<L>"Errare, atque viam palantes quaerere vitae."</L></Q>
i. e. From whence you may look down upon foot-passengers, see them wandering on each side you, and pick their way through the dirt:</P>
<Q><L>—"seriously</L>
<L>"From learn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng's tow'ring height to gaze around,</L>
<L>"And see plebeian spirits range below."</L></Q>
<P>There is a sort of r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asonry in poetry, wherein the pause represents the joints of building; which ought in every line and course to have their disposition varied.</P>
<P>The difference betwixt a witty writer and a writer of taste is chiefly this. The former is negligent what ideas he introduces, so he joins them surprisingly—The latter is principally careful what images he introduces, and studies simplicity rather than surprize in his manner of introduction.</P>
<P>It may in some measure account for the difference of taste in the reading of books, to consider the difference of our ears for music. One is not pleased without a perfect melody of style, be the sense what it will: an∣other,
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
of no ear for music, gives to sense its full weight without any deduction on account of harshness.</P>
<P>Harmony of period and melody of style have greater weight than is generally imagined in the judgement we pass upon writing and writers. As a proof of this, let us reflect, what texts of scripture, what lines in poetry, or what periods we most remember and quote, either in verse or prose, and we shall find them to be only musical ones.</P>
<P>I wonder the ancient mythology never shews Apollo enamoured of Venus; considering the remarkable de∣ference that wit has paid to beauty in all ages. The Orientals act more consonantly, when they suppose the nightingale enamoured of the rose; the most harmonious bird of the fairest and most delightful flower.</P>
<P>Hope is a flatterer; but the most upright of all para∣sites; for she frequents the poor man's hut, as well as the palace of his superior.</P>
<P>What is termed humour in prose, I conceive, would be considered as burlesque in poetry: of which in∣stances may be given.</P>
<P>Perhaps, burlesque may be divided into such as turns chiefly upon the thought, and such as depends more upon the expression: or we may add a third kind, consisting in thoughts ridiculously dressed in language much above or below their dignity.</P>
<P>The Splendid Shilling of Mr. Philips, and the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣dibras of Butler, are the most obvious instances. But∣ler, however, depended much upon the ludicrous effect of his double rhymes. In other respects, to declare my own sentiments, he is rather a witty writer than a hu∣mourous one.</P>
<P>Scenes below verse, merely versisied, lay claim to a degree of humour.</P>
<P>Swift in poetry deserves a place somewhere betwixt Butler and Horace. He has the wit of the former, and the graceful negligence which we find in the latter's epistles and satires. I believe, few people discover less humour in Don Quixote than myself. For beside the general sameness of adventure, whereby it is easy to
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
foresee what he will do on most occasions, it is not so easy to raise a laugh from the wild atchievements of a madman. The natural passion in that case is pity, with some small portion of mirth at most. Sancho's charac∣ter is indeed comic; and, were it removed from the ro∣mance, would discover how little there was of humour in the character of Don Quixote.</P>
<P>It is a fine stroke of Cervantes, when Sancho, sick of his government, makes no answer to his comforters, but aims directly at his shoes and stockings.</P>

It was observed of a most accomplished lady, that she was withal so very modest, that one sometimes thought she neglected the praises of her wit, because she could depend on those of her beauty; at other times, that she slighted those of her beauty, knowing she might rely on those of her wit.</P>

<P N="38">XXXVIII. There is nothing more universally prevalent than stattery.

<P>Your plain domestic people, who talk of their humili∣ty and home felt satisfactions, will in the same breath discover how much they envy a shining character. How is this consistent?</P>
<P>You are prejudiced, says Pedanticus; I will not take your word, or your character of that man.—But the grounds of my prejudice are the source of my accusation.</P>
<P>A proud man's intimates are generally more attached to him, than the man of merit and humility can pretend his to be. The reason is, the former pays a greater compliment in his condescension.</P>
<P>The situation of a king, is so far from being misera∣ble, as pedants term it; that, if a person have mag∣nanimity,

<P>A man, a gentleman, evidently appears more consider∣able by seeming to despise his fortune, than a citizen and mechanic by his endeavours to magnify it.</P>

<P N="43">XLIII. Third thoughts often coincide with the first, and are generally the best grounded. We first relish nature and the country; then artificial amusements and the city; then become impatient to retire to the country again.</P>
<P N="44">XLIV. While we labour to subdue our passions, we should take care not to extinguish them. Subduing our pas∣sions, is disengaging ourselves from the world; to which however, whilst we reside in it, we must always bear relation; and we may detach ourselves to such a degree as to pass an useless and insipid life, which we were not meant to do. Our existence here is at least one part of a system.</P>
<P>A man has generally the good or ill qualities which he attributes to mankind.</P>
<P N="45">XLV. Anger and the thirst of revenge are a kind of fever. Fighting, and law-suits, bleeding; at least, an evacua∣tion.

The latter occasions a dissipation of money; the former of those fiery spirits which cause a preternatural fermentation.</P>
<P N="46">XLVI. Were a man of pleasure to arrive at the full extent of his several wishes, he must immediately feel himself mi∣serable. It is one species of despair to have no room to hope for any addition to one's happiness.</P>
<P>His following wish must then be to wish he had some fresh object for his wishes. A strong argument that our minds and bodies were both meant to be for ever active.</P>
<P N="47">XLVII. I have seen one evil underneath the sun, which gives me particular mortification.</P>
<P>The r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serve or shyness of men of sense generally con∣fines them to a small acquaintance; and they find num∣bers their avowed enemies, the similarity of whose tastes, had fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brought them once acquainted, would have rendered them their fondest friends.</P>

<P N="49">XLIX. If a man be of sup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rior dignity to a woman, a woman is surely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s much superior to a man that is effeminated. Lily's rule in the grammar has well enough adjusted this subordination. <Q>“The masculine is more worthy than the feminine, and the feminine more worthy than the neuter.”</Q></P>
<P N="50">L. A gentleman of fortune will be osten complaining of taxes▪ that his estate is inconsiderable; that he can never make so much of it as the world is ready to imagine. A mere citizen, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the other hand, is always aiming to shew his riches; says that he employs so many hands; he keeps his wife a chaise and one; and talks much of his Chinese ornaments at his pal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry cake-house in the coun∣try.
<PB N="117" REF="130"/>
They both aim at praise, but of a very distinct kind. Now, supposing the cit worth as much in money as the other is in land, the gentleman surely chuses the better method of ostentation, who considers himself as somewhat superior to his fortune, than he who seems to look up at his fortune, and consequently sets himself beneath it.</P>
<P N="51">LI. The only kind of revenge which a man of sense need take upon a scoundrel, is by a series of worthy behavi∣our, to force him to admire and esteem his enemy, and yet irritate his animosity, by declining a reconciliation. <Q>As Sir John Falstaff might say, “turning even quarrels to commodity.”</Q></P>
<P N="52">LII. It is possible, by means of glue, to connect two pieces of wood together; by a powerful cement, to join mar∣ble; by the meditation of a priest, to unite a man and woman; but of all associations the most effectual is be∣twixt an idiot and a knave. They become in a man∣ner incorporate. The former seems so framed to admire and idolize the latter, that the latter may seize and de∣vour him as his proper prey.</P>
<P N="53">LIII. The same degree of penetration that shews you ano∣ther in the wrong, shews him also, in respect to that in∣stance, your inferior: hence the observation, and the real fact, that people of clear heads are what the world calls opinionated.</P>

<P N="60">LX. A man of wit, genius, learning, is apt to think it something hard, that men of no wit, no genius, no learning, should have a greater share of wealth and honours; not considering that their own accomplishment ought to be reckoned to them as their equivalent. It is no reason that a person worth five thousand pounds, should on that account have a claim to twenty.</P>
<P N="61">LXI. A wise ought in reality to love her husband above all the world; but this preference I think should, in point of politeness, be concealed. The reason is, that it is disgusting to see an amiable woman monopolized; and it is easy by proper management to wave (all I contend for) the appearance.</P>
<P N="62">LXII. There are some wounds given to reputation that are like the wounds of an envenomed arrow; where we irri∣tate

and enlarge the orifice while we extract the bearded weapon; yet cannot the cure be completed otherwise.</P>
<P N="63">LXIII. Amongst all the vain glorious professors of humility, you find none that will not discover how much they envy a shining character: and this either by censuring it them∣selves, or shewing a satisfaction in such as do. Now there is this advantage at least arising from ambition, that it disposes one to disregard a thousand instances of middling grandeur; and reduces one's emulation to the narrow circle of a few that blaze. It is hence a con∣venient disposition in a country place, where one is en∣compassed with such as are merely richer, keep fine horses, a table, footmen; make a decent figure as rural esquires; yet, after all, discover no more than an every∣day pleb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian character. These a person of little ambi∣tion might envy; but another of a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e extensive one may, in any kind of circumstances, disregard.</P>
<P N="64">LXIV. It is with some men as with some horses: what is esteemed spirit in them, proceeds from fear. This was undoubtedly the source of that seeming spirit discovered by Tully in regard to his an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agonist M. Antony. He knew he must destroy him, or be destroyed himself.</P>
<P N="65">LXV. The same qualities, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oined with virtue, often furnish out a great man, which, united with a different prin∣ciple, furnish out an highwayman; I mean courage and strong passions. And they may both join in the same expression, though with a meaning somewhat varied—

<P N="69">LXIX. It is favourable enough on the side of learning, that if an historian mentions a good author, it does not seem absurd to style him a great man: whereas the same phrase would not be allowed to a mere illiterate nobleman.</P>
<P N="70">LXX. It is less wonderful to see a wretched man commence an hero, than an happy one.</P>
<P N="71">LXXI. An high-spirit has often very different and even con∣trary effects. It sometimes operates no otherwise than like the "vis inertiae;" at others it induces men to bustle and make their part good among their superiors. As Mr. Pope says,</P>
<Q>"Some plunge in business, others shave their crowns."</Q>
<P>It is by no means less forcible, when it withdraws a man from the company of those with whom he cannot converse on equal terms; it leads him into solitude, that, if he cannot appear their equal, he may at least conceal his inferiority. It is sullen, obstinate, disdainful, haughty, in no less a degree than the other; but is, perhaps, more genteel, and less citizen-like. Sometimes the other succeeds, and then it is esteemed preferable; but in case it fail, it not only exposes a person's meanness, but his impatience under it; both of which the reserved spirit is able to disguise—but then it stands no chance of re∣moving. "Pudor malus ulcera celat."</P>

LXXII. Every single instance of a friend's insincerity encreases our dependence on the efficacy of the money.

<P N="73">LXXIII. When physicians write of diseases, the prognostics and the diagnostics, the symptoms and the paroxysms, they give one fatal apprehensions for every ache about us.

<P N="75">LXXV. I believe there was never so reserved a solitary, but felt some degree of pleasure at the first glimpse of an hu∣man figure. The soul, however, unconscious of its social bias in a crowd, will in solitude feel some attrac∣tion towards the first person that we meet.</P>
<P N="76">LXXVI. In courts, the motion of the body is easy, and those of the soul constrained: in the country, the gestures of the body are constrained, and those of the soul supine and careless.</P>

<P N="84">LXXXIV. Persons of great delicacy should know the certainty of the following truth.

LXXXV. High-spirit in a man, is like a sword; which, though worn to annoy his enemies, yet is often troublesome in a less degree to his friends. He can hardly wear it so inoffensively, but it is apt to incommode one or other of the company. It is more properly a loaded pistol, which accident alone may fire, and kill one.</P>
<P N="86">LXXXVI. A miser, if honest, can be only honest bare weight.</P>
<P>Avarice is the most opposite of all characters to that of God Almighty; whose alone it is, to give and not receive.</P>
<P>A miser grows rich by seeming poor; an extravagant man grows poor by seeming rich.</P>
<P>A grashopper is, perhaps, the best device for coat-armour of those who would be thought aborigines; agreeable to the Athenian use of them.</P>
<P>Immoderate assurance is perfect licentiousness.</P>
<P>When a person is so far engaged in a dispute as to wish to get the victory, he ought ever to desist. The idea of conquest will so dazzle him, that it is hardly possible he should discern the truth.</P>
<P>I have sometimes thought the mind so calculated, that a small degree of force may impel it to a certain pitch of pleasure or of pain; beyond which it will not pass, by any impetus whatsoever.</P>
<P>I doubt whether it be not true, that we hate those faults most in others which we are guilty of ourselves.</P>
<P>A man of thorough sense scarce admires even any one; but he must be an ideot, that is the admirer of a fool.</P>
<P>It may be prudent to give up the more trivial parts of character for the amusement of the invidious: as a man willin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly relinquishes his silver to save his gold from an highwayman.

Virtue seems to be nothing more than a motion con∣sonant to the system of things. Were a planet to fly from its orbit, it would represent a vicious man.</P>
<P>It is difficult not to be angry at beings we know in∣capable of acting otherwise than they do. One ought no more, if one reflects, to be angry at the stupidity of a man than of a horse, except it be vincible and volun∣tary; and yet the practice is otherwise.</P>
<P><Q>People say, “Do not regard what he says, now he is in liquor.”</Q> Perhaps it is the only time he ought to he regarded: "Aperit praecordia Liber."</P>
<P>Patience is the Panacea; but where does it grow, or who can swallow it.</P>
<P>Wits uniformly exclaim against fools, yet fools are their proper foil; and it is from them alone they can learn what figure themselves make. Their behaviour naturally falls in with the generality, and furnishes a better mirror than that of artful people, who are sure enough to deceive you either on the favourable or the ill-natured side.</P>
<P>We say, he is a man of sense who acknowledges the same truths that we do; that he is a man of taste who allows the same beauties. We consider him as a person of better sense and finer taste, who discerns more truths and more beauties in conjunction with ourselves: but we allow neither appellation to the man who differs from us.</P>
<P>We deal out our genuine esteem to our equals; our affection for those beneath us; and a reluctant sort of respect to those that are above us.</P>
<P>Glory relaxes often and debilitates the mind; censure stimulates and contracts—both to an exteme. Simple fame is, perhaps, the proper medium.</P>
<P>Persons of new families do well to make magnificent funerals, sumptuous weddings, remarkable entertain∣ments; to exhibit a number of servants in rich and oftentatious liveries; and to take every public occasion of imprinting on the mob an habitual notion of their superiority. For so is deference obtained from that quarter:</P>
<Q>"Stupet in titulis &amp; imaginibus."</Q>
<P><PB N="125" REF="138"/>
One scarce sees how it is possible for a country girl or a country fellow to preserve their chastity. They have neither the philosophical pleasure of books, nor the luxurious pleasure of a table, nor the refined amuse∣ment of building, planting, drawing, or designing, to divert their imagination from an object to which they seem continually to stimulate it by provocative illusions, Add to this the health and vigour that are almost pecu∣liar to them.</P>
<P>I am afraid, there are many ladies who only exchange the pleasures of incontinence for the pleasure they de∣rive from censure. At least it is no injustice to con∣clude so, where a person is extravagantly censorious.</P>
<P>Persons of judgement and understanding may be divid∣ed into two sorts. Those whose judgement is so extensive as to comprehend a great deal; existences, systems, uni∣versais: but as there are some eyes so constituted as to take in distant objects, yet be excelled by others in re∣gard to objects minute or near, so there are other under∣standings better calculated for the examination of par∣ticular objects.</P>
<P>The mind is at first an open field without partitions or enclosures. To make it turn to most account, it is very proper to divide and enclose. In other words, to sort our observations.</P>
<P>Some men are called sagacious, merely on account of their avarice: whereas a child can clench its fist the mement it is born.</P>
<P>It is a point of prudence, when you converse with your inferior, to consider yourself as conversing with his inferior, with whom no doubt he may have the same connexion that you have with him: and to be upon your guard accordingly.</P>
<P>How deplorable then is a person's condition, when his mind can only be supported by flattery, and his con∣stitution but by cordials! when the relief of his present complaint undermines its own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficacy, yet encreases the occasion for which it is used! Short is then the dura∣tion of our tranquillity, or of our lives.</P>
<P>A man is not esteemed ili-natured for any excess of
<PB N="126" REF="139"/>
social affection; or an indiscreet profusion of his fortune upon his neighbours, companions, or friends; although the true measure of his affections is as much impaired by this, as by selfishness.</P>
<P>If any one's curse can effect damnation, it is not that of the pope, but that of the poor.</P>
<P>People of the finest and most lively genius have the greatest sensibility, of consequence the most lively pas∣sions; the violence of which puts their conduct upon a footing with that of fools. Fools discern the weak∣nesses which they have in common with themselves; but are not sensible of their excellencies, to which they have no pretensions; of course, always inclined to dis∣pute the superiority.</P>
<P>Wit is the refractory pupil of judgement.</P>
<P>Virtue should be considered as a part of taste (and perhaps it is so more in this age, than in any preceding one) and should as much avoid deceit or sinister mean∣ings in discourse, as they would do puns, bad language, or false grammar.</P>

<P>The man of a towering ambition, or a well-regulated taste has fewer objects to envy or to covet than the grovellers.</P>

<P>If envious people were universally to ask themselves, whether they would exchange their entire situations with the persons envied (I mean their minds, passions, notions, as well as their persons, fortunes, dignities, &amp;c. &amp;c.)

<P>A person, elevated one degree above the populace, assumes more airs of superiority than one that is raised ten. The reason is somewhat obvious. His superiority is more contestible.</P>
<P>The character of a decent, well-behaved gentleman-like man seems more easily attainable by a person of no great parts or passions, than by one of greater genius and more volatility. It is there no mismanagement, for the former to be chiefly ambitious of it. When a man's capacity does not enable him to entertain or animate the company, it is the best he can do to render himself inof∣fensive, and to keep his teeth clean. But the person who has talents for discourse, and a passionate desire to enliven conversation, ought to have many improprieties excused, which in the other were unpardonable. A lady of good-nature would forgive the blunder of a country esquire, who, through zeal to serve her with a glass of claret, should involve his spurs in her Brussels apron.

I have known a sensible man of opinion that one should not be solicitous about a wife's understanding. A woman's sense was with him a phrase to express a de∣gree of knowledge, which was likely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o contribute mighty little to a husband's happiness. I cannot be of his opinion. I am convinced, that as judgement is the portion of our sex, so fancy and imagination are more eminently the lot of theirs. If so, after honesty of heart, what is there we should so much require? A wife's beauty will soon decay, it is doubtful whether in reality first, or in our own opinion. Either of these is sufficient to pall the raptures of enjoyment. We are then to seek for somethin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that will retain its novelty; or, what is equivalent, will change its shape when her per∣son palls by its identity. Fancy and genius bid fairest for this, which have as many shapes, as there can hap∣pen occasions to exert them. Good-nature, I always suppose. The former will be expedient to exhilarate and divert us; the latter to preserve our minds in a temper to be diverted.</P>
<P>I have known some attornies of reputable families, and whose original dispositions seemed to have been open and humane.

<P>Reconciliation is the tenderest part either of friendship or of love; the latter more especially, in which the soul is more remarkably softened. Were a person to make use of art in procuring the affection of his mistress, it were, perhaps, his most effectual method to contrive a slight estrangement, and then, as it were impercepti∣bly, bring on a reconciliation. The soul here discovers a kind of elasticity; and, being forced back, returns with an additional violence.</P>
<P>Virtue may be considered as the only means of dis∣pensing happiness in proper portions to every moment of our time.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="142"/>
To judge whether one has sufficient pleasure to render the continuation of life agreeable, it is not enough to say, Would you die? Take away first, the hope of bet∣ter scenes in this life, the fears of worse in another, and the bodily pain of dying.</P>
<P>The fear of death seems as natural, as the sensation of lust or of hunger: the first and last, for the preservation of the individual; the other, for the continuation of the species.</P>
<P>It seems obvious that God, who created the world, intends the happiness and perfection of the system he created. To effect the happiness of the whole, self-love, in its degree, is as requisite as social; for I am myself a part of that whole, as well as another. The difficulty of ascertaining what is virtue, lies in proportioning the degrees of self-love and social. "Proximus sum egomet mihi."—"Tunica pallio pro∣prior."—"Charity begins at home." It is so. It ought to be so; nor is there any inconvenience arises to the public, because it is general. Were this away, the individual must soon perish, and consequently the whole body. A man has every moment occasion to exert his self-love for the sake of self-preservation; consequently this ought to be stronger, in order to keep him upon his guard. A centinel's attention should be greater than that of a soldier on a review.</P>
<P>The social, though alike constant, is not equally in∣tense; because the selfish, being universal, renders the social less essential to the well-being of one's neighbour. In short, the self-love and the social ought to bear such proportion as we find they generally do. If the selfish passion of the rest preponderate, it would be self-de∣structive in a few individuals to be over-socially dis∣posed. If the social one prevails generally, to be of remarkable selfishness must obstruct the good of society.</P>

We find the scheme, which we have chosen, answer our expectations but indifferently—Most worldly pro∣jects will. We, therefore, repent of our choice, and immediately fancy happiness in the paths which we de∣cline; and this heightens our uneasiness. We might at least escape the aggravation of it. It is not improbable, we had been more unhappy, but extremely probable, we had not been less so, had we made a different de∣cision.

The profound ignorance of the former, together with the canine impudence and ra∣pacity of the latter, will but rarely be found wanting to vindicate the comparison.

Two friends of mine upon a journey had so contrived as to reduce their finances to a single sixpence each.

<P>Deference, before company, is the genteelest kind of flattery. The flattery of epistles affects one less, as they cannot be shewn without an appearance of vanity.

<P>Though punctilios are trifling, they may be as im∣portant as the friendship of some persons that regard

them—Indeed it is almost an universal practice to rail at punctilio; and it seems in some measure a consequence of our attachment to French fashions. However, it is extremely obvious, that punctilio never caused half the quarrels, that have risen from the freedom of behaviour, which is its opposite extreme. Were all men rational and civilized, the use of ceremony would be superfluous: but as the case is, it at least fixes some bounds to the encroachments of eccentric people, who, under the de∣nomination of freedom, might demand the privilege of breaking your head.</P>
<P>There seem near as many people that want passion as want reason.</P>
<P>The world would be more happy, if persons gave up more time to an intercourse of friendship. But money engrosses all our deference; and we scarce enjoy a social hour, because we think it unjustly stolen from the main business of our lives.</P>
<P>The state of man is not unlike that of a fish hooked by an angler. Death allows us a little line.

<P>It is possible to discover in some faces the features nature intended, had she not been some-how thwarted in her operations. Is it not easy to remark the same dis∣tortion in some minds? There is a phrase pretty fre∣quent amongst the vulgar, and which they apply to ab∣solute fools—That they have had a rock too much in their cradles.—With me, it is a most expressive idiom to describe a dislocated understanding: an understanding, for instance, which, like a watch, discovers a multitude of such parts, as appear obviously intended to belong to a system of the greatest perfection; yet which, by some unlucky jumble, falls infinitely short of it.</P>
<P>Is it not the wound our pride sustains by being deceived, that makes us more averse to hypocrites, than to the most audacious and barefaced villain? Yet it seems as much a piece of justice to commend a man for talking more honestly than he acts, as it is to 'blame a man for acting more dishonestly than he talks. The sum of the whole, however, is that the one adds to other crimes by his deceit, and the other by his impu∣dence.</P>

<P>IT is often asserted, by pretenders to singular pene∣tration, that the assistance fancy is supposed to draw from wine, is merely imaginary and chimerical: that all which the poets have urged on this head, is absolute rant and enthusiasm; and has no foundation in truth or nature. I am inclined to think otherwise. Judge∣ment, I readily allow, derives no benefit from the noblest cordial. But persons of a phlegmatic constitu∣tion have those excellencies often suppressed, of which their imagination is truly capable, by reason of a lentor, which wine may naturally remove. It raises low spirits to a pitch necessary for the exertion of sancy. It con∣futes the "Non est tanti," so frequently a maxim with speculative persons. It quickens that ambition, or that social bias, which makes a person wish to shine, or to please. Ask what tradition says of Mr. Addison's con∣versation.

<P>I think, I can observe a peculiar beauty in the addi∣tion of a short syllable, at the end of a blank verse: I mean, however, in blank dialogue.

It seems to me, that what are called notes at the bottom of pages (as well as parenthesis in writing) might be generally avoided, without injuring the thread of a discourse.

<P>THERE are many persons acquire to themselves a character of insincerity, from what is in truth mere inconstancy. And there are persons of warm, but change∣able passions; perhaps the sincerest of any in the very instant they make profession, but the very least to be depended on through the short duration of all extremes. It has often puzzled me, on this account, to ascertain the character of Lady Luxborough <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sister to Lord Bolingbroke: with her the author had en∣joyed a literary correspondence.</NOTE>; yet whatever were her principles, I esteem Lord Bolingbroke's to have been the same. She seemed in all respects the female Lord Bolingbroke.</P>

<P>Lady Luxborough's hand-writing was, at the same time, delicate and masculine. Her features, her air, her understanding, her motions, and her sentiments, were the same. Mr. W—, in the same respects, delicate, but not masculine. Mr. G—rather more delicate than masculine. Mr. J—rather more masculine than delicate. And this, in regard to the three last, extends to their drawing, versification, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

Neither does it seem any way consistent with a sensibility of pleasure, notwithstanding all external appearances. It is a mere greyhound puppy in a warren, that runs at all truths, and at all sorts of pleasure; but does not allow itself time to be successful in securing any.

<P>People of real genius have strong passions; people of strong passions have great partialities; such as Mr. Pope for Lord Bolingbroke, &amp;c. Persons of slow parts have languid passions, and persons of languid passions have little partiality. They neither love, nor hate, nor

look, nor move, with the energy of a man of sense. The faults of the former should be balanced with their excellencies: and the blamelessness of the latter should be weighed with their insignificancy. Happiness and virtue are, perhaps, generally dispensed with more equality than we are aware.</P>
<P>Extreme volatile and sprightly tempers seem incon∣sistent with any great enjoyment. There is too much time wasted in the mere transition from one object to another. No room for those deep impressions, which are made alone by the duration of an idea; and are quite re∣quisite to any strong sensation, either of pleasure or of pain. The bee to collect honey, or the spider to gather poison, must abide some time upon the weed or flower. They whose fluids are mere sal volatile, seem rather cheerful than happy men.

<P>The sacrificing of our anger to our interest is often∣times no more, than the exchange of a painful passion for a pleasurable.</P>
<P>There are not five in five hundred that pity, but, at the same time, also despise; a reason that you should be cautious to whom and where you complain. The farthest a prudent man should proc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in general, is to laugh at some of his own foibles: when this may be a means of removing envy from the more important parts of his character.</P>
<P>E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eminacy of appearance, and an excessive attention to the minuter parts of dress, is, I believe, properly, in the general run, esteemed a symptom of irresolution. But, yet, instances are seen to abound in the French na∣tion to the contrary. And in our own, that of Lord Mark Kerr was an instance equal to a thousand. A snuff-box hinge, rendered invisible, was an object on which his happiness appeared to turn; which, however, might be clouded by a speck of dirt, or wounded by a hole in the heel of his stocking. Yet this man's intre∣pidity was shewn beyond all contradiction. What shall we say then of Mr. Gray, of manners very delicate, yet possessed of a poetical vein fraught with the noblest and sublimest images, and of a mind remarkably well stored with the more masculine parts of learning?—Here, per∣haps, we must remain in suspence—For though taste does not imply manners, so neither does it preclude them: or what hinders, that a man should feel that same delicacy in regard to real honour, which he does in regard to dress?</P>
<P>If beneficence be not in a person's will, what imports it to mankind, that it is ever so much in his power? And yet we see how much more regard is generally paid to a worthless man of fortune, than to the most benevo∣lent beggar that ever uttered an ineffectual blessing. It is all agreeable to Mr. Burke's thesis, that the formid∣able idea of power affects more deeply than the most beautiful image we can conceive of moral virtue.</P>
<P>A person that is not merely stupid, is naturally under
<PB N="149" REF="166"/>
the influence of the acute passions, or the slow—The principle of revenge is meant for the security of the in∣dividual; and supposing a person has not courage to put it immediately into practice, he commonly strives to make himself remarkable for the perseverance of his resentment. Both these have the same motive to im∣press a dread upon our enemies of injuring us for the the future: and though the world be more inclined to favour the rash than the phlegmatic enemy, it is hard to say which of the two has given rise to more dismal con∣sequences—The reason of this partiality may be deduced from the same original, as the preference that is given to down-right impudence before hypocrisy. To be cheat∣ed into an ill-placed esteem, or to be undermined by concealed malignity, discovers a contempt for our un∣derstanding, and lessens the idea we entertain of it our∣selves. They hurt our pride more than open violence, or undisguised impudence.</P>
<P><Q>King James the First, willing to involve the regal power in mystery, that, like natural objects, it might appear greater through the fog, declared it presumption for a subject to say, “what a king might do in the fullness of his power.”</Q>—This was absurd; but it seems presumption in a man of the world, to say what means a man of genius may think instrumental to his happiness. W—used to say, it was presumption for him to make conjectures on the occasion. A person of refinement seems to have his pleasures distinct from the common run of men: what the world calls import∣ant, is to him wholly frivolous; and what the world esteems frivolous, seems essential to his tranquillity.</P>
<P>The apparatus of a funeral among the middle rank of people, and sometimes among the great, has one ef∣fect that is not frivolous. It in some measure dissipates and draws off the attention from the main object of concern.

There are some people whom you cannot regard, though they seem desirous to oblige you; nay, even though they do you actual services. This is the case wherever their sentiments are too widely different from your own. Thus a person truly avaricious can never make himself truly agreeable to one enamoured with the arts and sciences. A person of exquisite sensi∣bility and tenderness can never be truly pleased with another of no feelings; who can see the most intimate of his friends or kindred expire without any greater pain than if he beheld a pitcher broken. These, pro∣perly speaking, can be said to feel nothing but the point of a sword; and one could more easily pardon them, if this apathy were the effect of philosophy, and not want of thought. But what I would inculcate is, with tem∣pers thus different one should never attempt any close connexion:</P>

<P>There are some people who find a gloomy kind of pleasure in glouting, which could hardly be encreased by the satisfaction of having their wishes granted.

I wish, for my pocket, an elegant etui; and gold to remove the pain of wishing, and partake the pleasure of enjoyment. I would part with the purchase-money, for which I have less regard; but the gratification of this wish would generate fifty others, that would be ruinous. See Epictetus; who, therefore, advises to resist the first.</P>
<P>Virtue and agreeableness are, I fear, too often sepa∣rated; that is, externals affect and captivate the fancy, where internal worth is wanting, to engage and attach one's reason—A most perplexing circumstance; and no where more remarkable, than when we see a wise man totally enslaved by the beauty of a person he despises.</P>

One should be cautious against the advances of this kind of propensity, which loses us friends, in a matter generally of no consequence.</P>

it is attended with good consequences; as it leaves a good impression upon the mind, favourable to virtue and a religious life.</P>

<P>It is a common argument amongst divines, in the be∣half of a religious life, that a contrary behaviour has such consequences when we come to die. It is indeed true, but seems an argument of a subordinate kind: the article of death is more frequently of short duration.

<P>The word "R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ligio" amongst the Romans, and the word "Church" among the Christians, seem to have more interpretations than almost any other. <Q>“Malus procidit, eâ religione moti.”</Q>—Livy, p. 1150 vol. II. <Q>Here religion seems to mean prodigy—“Si quis tale sacrum solenne duceret, ne se sine religione &amp; piaculo id omittere posse.”</Q> Livy 1157. Here it seemingly means impiety: "Piaculum" being such an offence as required expiatory sacrifices,</P>
<Q>"Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum."</Q>
<P>Here it means superstition, as it does often in Lucretius.</P>
<P>The pope's wanton excommunications; his capricious pardon of sins; his enormous indulgences, and other particulars of like nature, shew that whatever religions may practise cruelty) it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>culiarly the church that makes a jest of God Almighty.</P>

<P>How ready have all nations been, after having allowed a proper portion of land and praise to their own abili∣ties, to attribute their success in war to the peculiar fa∣vour of a just Providence! Perhaps, this construction, as it is often applied, argues more of presumption than gratitude. In the first place, such is the partiality of the human heart, that, perhaps, two hostile nations may alike rely upon the justice of their cause; and which of the two has the better claim to it, none but Providence can itself discover. In the next, it should be observed, that success by no means demonstrates justice. Again, we must not wholly forget to consider, that success may be no more than a means of destruction. And lastly, supposing success to be really and absolutely good, do we find that individuals are always favoured with it in proportion to their desert; and if not individuals, why must we then suppose it to be the uniform recompence of society?</P>
<P>It is often given as a reason why it is incumbent on God Almighty's justice, to punish or reward societies in this world, because, hereafter, they cannot be punished or rewarded, on account of their desolation. It is, in∣deed, true that human vengeance must act frequently in the gross; and whenever a government declares war against a foreign society, or finds it needful to chastise any part of its own, must of necessity involve some inno∣cent individuals, with the guilty. But it does not ap∣pear so evident, that an omniscient and omnipotent Being, who knows the secrets of all hearts, and is able to make a distinction in his punishments, will judge his unhappy creatures by these indiscriminate and imperfect laws.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="173"/>
Societies then are to be considered as the casual or ar∣bitrary assortments of human institution. To suppose that God Almighty will, by means of punishments, often called judgements, destroy them promiscuously, is to suppose that he will regulate his government accord∣ing to the cabals of human wisdom. I mean to be un∣derstood here, with regard to what are called judgements, or, in other words, praeternatural interpositions of Pro∣vidence. In a natural way, the constitution of the uni∣verse requires, that the good must often suffer with the bad part of society. But in regard to judgements upon whole bodies (which we have days appointed to depre∣cate) let us introduce a case, which may serve to il∣lustrate the improbability.</P>
<P>Societies, I suppose then, are not divine, but human bundles.</P>
<P>Imagine a man to mix a large quantity of sand and gunpowder; then parcel out the composition into dif∣ferent heaps, and apply fire to them separately. The fire, it is very obvious, would take no notice of the bundles; would by no means consume, here and there, a bundle in the gross, but would affect that part of every portion that was combustible.</P>
<P>It may speciously enough be said, what greater in∣justice is it to punish a society promiscously, than to in∣volve an innocent son in the punishment due to a sinful father? to this I answer, the natural system (which ye need not doubt, upon the whole, is right) occasions both the good and bad to suffer many times indisc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣minately. But they go much farther—They say God, as it were, interferes, in opposition to the settled course of things, to punish and include societies in one pro∣miscuous vengeance. Were he to inflict extraordinary punishments distinct from those which sin entails upon us, he surely would not regulate them by mere human assortments, but would make the juster distinction of good and evil individuals.</P>
<P>Neither do I see why it is so necessary, that societes, either here or hereafter, should be punished as societies. "The soul that sinneth, it shall die."</P>

What then remains, but that we revive the memory of such relations now, in order to quicken our benevolence? that we are all countrymen, is a consideration that is more commonly inculcated, and limits our benevolence to a smaller number also. That we are cotemporaries, and persons whom future history shall unite, who, great part of us, however imperceptibly, receive and confer reciprocal benefits; this, with every other circumstance that tends to heighten our philanthropy, should be brought to mind as much as possible, during our abode upon earth. Hereafter it may be just, and requisite, to comprehend all ages of mankind.</P>
<P>The best notion we can conceive of God, may be, that he is to the creation what the soul is to the body:</P>
<Q>—"Deus est quodcunque vides, ubicunque moveris."</Q>
<P>What is man, while we reflect upon a Deity, whose very words are works; and all whose works are wonders!</P>
<P>Prayer is not used to inform, for God is omniscient: not to move compassion, for God is without passions: not to shew our gratitude, for God knows our hearts.—May not a man, that has true notions, be a pious man though he be silent?</P>
<P>To honour God, is to conceive right notions of him, says some ancient that I have forgot.</P>
<P>I know not how Mr. Pope's assertion is consistent with the scheme of a particular Providence:</P>
<Q><L>—"The Almighty cause</L>
<L>"Acts not by partial, but by general laws."</L></Q>
<P>What one understands by a general Providence, is that attention of the Almighty to the works of his creation, by which they pursue their original course, without deviating into such eccentric motions as must
<PB N="159" REF="176"/>
immediately tend to the destruction of it. Thus a phi∣losopher is enabled to foretel eclipses with precision; and a stone thrown upward drops uniformly to the ground. Thus an injury awakes resentment; and good office endears to us our benefactor. And it seems no unworthy idea of Omnipotence, perhaps, to suppose he at first constituted a system, that stood in no need either of his counteracting or suspending the first laws of mo∣tion.</P>
<P>But, after all, the mind remains; and we can shew it to be either impossible, or improbable, that God di∣rects the will? Now whether the divine Being occasions a ruin to fall miraculously, or in direct opposition to the ordinary laws of nature, upon the head of Chartres—or whether he inclines Chartres to go near a wall whose centre of gravity is unsupported, makes no material dif∣ference.</P>

<HEAD>On Taste.</HEAD>
<P>I BELIEVE that, generally speaking, persons emi∣nent in one branch of taste, have the principles of the rest; and to try this, I have often solicited a stranger to hum a tune, and have seldom failed of success. This, however, does not extend to talents beyond the sphere of taste; and Handel was evidently wrong, when he fan∣cied himself born to command a troop of horse.</P>
<P>Mankind, in general, may be divided into persons of understanding and persons of genius; each of which all admit of many subordinate degrees. By persons of un∣derstanding, I mean persons of sound judgement; formed for mathematical deductions and clear argu∣mentation. By persons of genius, I would characterize those in whom true and genuine fancy predominates; and this whether assisted or not by cultivation.</P>
<P>I have thought that genius and judgement may, in some respects, be represented by a liquid and a solid. The former is, generally speaking, remarkable for its
<PB N="160" REF="177"/>
sensibility, but then loses its impression soon: the latter is less susceptible of impression but retains it longer.</P>
<P>Dividing the world into an hundred parts, I am apt to believe the calculation might be thus adjusted:</P>

<CELL>Persons of original taste, improved by art</CELL>
<CELL>5</CELL>
</ROW>
</TABLE></P>
<P>There is hardly any thing so uncommon, as a true native taste improved by education.</P>
<P>The object of taste is corporeal beauty; for though there is manifestly a <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; a "pulchrum," an "honestum," and "decorum," in moral actions; and although a man of taste that is not virtuous commits a greater violence upon his sentiments than any other per∣son; yet, in the ordinary course of speaking, a person is not termed a man of taste, merely because he is a man of virtue.</P>
<P>All beauty may be divided into absolute and relative, and what is compounded of both.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to hear a modern Quixote insist upon the superiority of his idol or Dulcinea; and, not con∣tent to pay his own tribute of adoration, demand that of others in favour of her accomplishments. Those of grave and sober sense cannot avoid wondering at a dif∣ference of opinions, which are in truth supported by no criterion.</P>
<P>Every one, therefore, ought to fix some measure of beauty, before he grows eloquent upon the subject.</P>
<P>Every thing seems to derive its pretensions to beauty, on account of its colour, smoothness, variety, uniformi∣ty, partial resemblance to something else, proportion, or suitableness to the end proposed, some connection of ideas, or a mixture of all these.</P>
<P>As to the beauty of colours, their present effect seems in proportion to their impulse; and scarlet, were it not
<PB N="161" REF="178"/>
for habit, would affect an Indian before all other co∣lours.</P>
<P>Resemblances wrought by art; pictures, bustos, sta∣tues, please.</P>
<P>Columns, proportioned to their incumbent weight; but herein we suppose homogeneous materials; it is other∣wise, in case we know that a column is made of iron.</P>
<P>Habit, herein, seems to have an influence to which we can assix no bounds. Suppose the generality of man∣kind formed with a mouth from ear to ear, and that it were requisite in point of respiration, would not the present make of mouths have subjected a man to the name of Bocha Chica?</P>
<P>It is probable, that a clown would require more co∣lour in his Chloe's face, than a courtier.</P>
<P>We may see daily the strange effects of habit, in re∣spect of fashion. To what colours, or proportions, does it not reconcile us!</P>
<P>Conceit is false taste; and very widely different from no taste at all.</P>
<P>Beauty of person should, perhaps, be estimated ac∣cording to the proportion it bears to such a make and features as are most likely to produce the love of the op∣posite sex. The look of dignity, the look of wisdom, the look of delicacy and refinement, seem in some mea∣sure foreign. Perhaps, the appearance of sensibility may be one ingredient; and that of health, another. At least, a cadaverous countenance is the most disgusting in the world.</P>
<P>I know not, if one reason of the different opinions concerning beauty be not owing to self-love. People are apt to form some criterion, from their own persons, or possessions. A tall person approves the look of a fo∣lio or octavo: a square thick-set man is more delighted with a quarto. This instance, at least, may serve to explain what I intend.</P>
<P>I believe, it sometimes happens that a person may have what the artists call an ear and an eye, without taste: for instance, a man may sometimes have a quick∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in distinguishing the similitude or difference of lines
<PB N="162" REF="179"/>
and sounds, without any skill to give the proper pre∣ference betwixt the combinations of them.</P>
<P>Taste produces different effects upon different com∣plexions. It consists, as I have often observed, in the appetite and the discernment; then most properly so called, when they are united in equal proportions.</P>
<P>Where the discernment is predominant, a person is pleased with fewer objects, and requires perfection in what he sees. Where the appetite prevails, he is so much attached to beauty, that he feels a gratification in every degree in which it is manifested. I frankly own myself to be of this latter class: I love painting and sta∣tuary so well, as to be not undelighted with moderate performances.</P>
<P>The reason people vary in their opinions of a portrait, I mean with regard to the resemblance it bears to the original, seems no other than that they lay stress on dif∣ferent features in the original; and this different stress is owing to different complexions of mind.</P>
<P>People of little or no taste commend a person for its corpulency. I cannot see, why an excrescence of belly, cheek, or chin, should be deemed more beautiful th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a wen on any other part of the body. Through a con∣nexion of ideas, it may form the beauty of a pig or an ox.</P>
<P>There seems a pretty exact analogy between the ob∣jects and the senses. Some tunes, some tastes, some vi∣sible objects, please at first, and that only; others only, by degrees, and then long—(Raspberry-jelly—Green∣tea—Alley-Croaker—Air in Ariadne—a Baron's Robe—and a Bishop's Lawn.) Perhaps, some of these in∣stances may be ill enough chosen; but the thing is true.</P>
<P>Tunes, with words, please me the more in proportion as they approach nearer to the natural accent of the words to which they are assigned. Scotch tunes often end high: their language does the same.</P>
<P>To how very great a degree the appearance of health alone is beauty, I am not able to determine. I presume the most regular and well-proportioned form of limbs and features is at the same time the most healthful one:
<PB N="163" REF="180"/>
the sittest to perform the functions and operations of the body. If so, a perfectly healthful form is a perfectly beautiful form—Health is beauty, and the most perfect health is the most perfect beauty. To have recourse to experience: the most sickly and cadaverous countenance is the least provocative to love; or rather the most in∣consistent with it. A florid look, to appear beautiful, must be the bloom of health, and not the glow of a fever.</P>
<P>An obvious connection may be traced betwixt moral and physical beauty; the love of symmetry and the love of virtue; an elegant taste and perfect honesty. We may, we must, rise from the love of natural to that of moral beauty: such is the conclusion of Plato, and of my Lord Shaftesbury.</P>
<P>Wherever there is a want of taste, we generally ob∣serve a love of money, and cunning: and whenever taste prevails, a want of prudence, and an utter dis∣regard to money.</P>
<P>Taste (or a just relish of beauty) seems to distinguish us from the brute creation, as much as intellect, or rea∣son. We do not find that brutes have any sensation of this sort. A bull is goaded by the love of sex in gene∣ral, without the least appearance of any distinction in favour of the more beautiful individual. Accordingly men devoid of taste are in a great measure indifferent as to make, complexion, feature; and find a difference of sex sufficient to excite their passion in all its fervor. It is not thus where there is a taste for beauty, either ac∣curate or erroneous. The person of a good taste requires real beauty in the object of his passion; and the person of bad taste requires something which he substitutes in the place of beauty.</P>
<P>Persons of taste, it has been asserted, are also the best qualified to distinguish, and the most prone to admire, moral virtue: nor does it invalidate this maxim, that their practice does not correspond. The power of acting virtuously depends in a great measure upon with∣standing a present, and perhaps sensual, gratification, or the sake of a more distant and intellectual satisfaction.
<PB N="164" REF="181"/>
Now, as persons of fine taste are men of the strongest sensual appetites, it happens that in balancing present and future, they are apt enough to allow an unreasonable advantage to the former. On the other hand, a more phlegmatic character may, with no grater self-denial, allow the future fairer play. But let us wave the merely sensual indulgences; and let us consider the man of taste in regard to points of meum and tuum; in regard to the virtues of forgiveness; in regard to charity, com∣passion, munificence, and magnanimity; and we cannot fail to vote his taste the glorious triumph which it de∣serves.</P>
<P>There is a kind of counter-taste, founded on sur∣prize and curiosity, which maintains a sort of vivalship with the true; and may be expressed by the name Con∣cetto. Such is the fondness of some persons for a knife-haft made from the royal oak, or a tobacco stopper from a mulberry-tree of Shakespear's own planting. It gra∣tifies an empty curiosity. Such is the casual resemblance of Apollo and the nine muses in a piece of agate; a dog expressed in feathers, or a woodcock in mohair. They serve to give surprize. But a just fancy will no more esteem a picture because it proves to be produced by shells, than a writer would prefer a pen because a person made it with his toes. In all such cases, difficulty should not be al∣lowed to give a casting weight; nor a needle be con∣sidered as a painter's instrument, when he is so much better furnished with a pencil <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cornelius Ketel, born at Gonda in 1548; landed in England 1573; settled at Amsterdam 1581; took it into his head to grow famous by painting with his fingers instead of pencils.—The whim took—His success increased—His fin∣gers appearing too easy tools, he then undertook to paint with his feet—See H. Walpole's Book of Pain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Perhaps no print, or even painting, is capable of producing a figure answerable to the idea which poetry or history has given us of great men: a Cicero, for in∣stance, an Homer, a Cato, or an Alexander. The same, perhaps, is true of the grandeur of some ancient build∣ings—And the reason is, that the effects of a pencil are
<PB N="165" REF="182"/>
distinct and limited, whereas the descriptions of the pen leave the imagination room to expatiate; and Burke has made it extremely obvious, that indistinctness of out∣line is one source of the sublime.</P>
<P>What an absurdity is it, in framing even prints, to suffer a margin of white paper to appear beyond the ground; destroying half the relievo the lights are in∣tended to produce! Frames ought to contrast with paint∣ings; or to appear as distinct as possible: for which rea∣son, frames of wood inlaid, or otherwise variegated with colours, are less suitable than gilt ones, which, ex∣hibiting an appearance of metal, afford the best contrast with colour.</P>
<P>The peculiar expression in some portraits is owing to the greater or less manifestation of the soul in some of the features.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, a sublime, and a beautiful, in the very make of a face, exclusive of any particular expres∣sion of the soul; or, at least, not expressive of any other than a tame dispassionate one. We see often what the world calls regular features, and a good complexion, almost totally unanimated by any discovery of the tem∣per or understanding. Whenever the regularity of fea∣ture, beauty of complexion, the strong expression of sa∣gaci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and generosity, concur in one face, the features are irresistible.</P>
<P>But even here it is to be observed, that a sort of sym∣pathy has a prodigious bias—Thus a pensive beauty, with regular features and complexion, will have the preference with a spectator of the pensive cast: and so of the rest.</P>
<P>The soul appears to me to discover herself most in the mouth and eyes; with this difference, that the mouth seems the more expressive of the temper, and the eye of the understanding.</P>
<P>Is a portrait, supposing it as like as can be to the per∣son for whom it is drawn, a more or less beautiful ob∣ject than the original face? I should think, a perfect face must be much more pleasing than any representation of it; and a set of ugly features much more ugly than
<PB N="166" REF="183"/>
the most exact resemblance that can be drawn of them. Painting can do much by means of shades; but not equal the force of real relievo: on which account, it may be the advantage of bad features to have their effect diminished; but surely, never can be the interest of good ones.</P>
<P>Softness of manner seems to be in painting, what smoothness of syllables is in language, affecting the sense of sight or hearing, previous to any correspondent passion.</P>
<P>The "theory of agreeable sensations" founds them up<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the greatest activity or exercise an object occasions to the senses, without proceeding to fatigue. Violent contrasts are upon the footing of roughness or inequal∣ity.—Harmony or similitude, on the other hand, are somewhat congenial to smootheness. In other words, these two recommend themselves; the one to our love of action, the other to our love of rest. A medium, therefore, may be most agreeable to the generality.</P>
<P>An harmony in colours seems as requisite, as a variety of lines seems necessary to the pleasure we expect from outward forms. The lines, indeed, should be well va∣ried; but yet the opposite sides of any thing should shew a balance, or an appearance of equal quantity, if we would strive to please a well-constituted taste.</P>
<P>It is evident enough to me, that persons often occur, who may be said to have an ear to music, and an eye for proportions in visible objects, who nevertheless can hardly be said to have a relish or taste for either. I mean, that a person may distinguish notes and tones to a nicety, and yet not give a discerning choice to what is preferable in music. The same in objects of sight.</P>
<P>On the other hand, they cannot have a proper feeling of beauty or harmony, without a power of discriminat∣ing those notes and proportions on which harmony and beauty so fully depend.</P>
<P>What is said, in a treatise lately published, for beauty's being more common than deformity (and seemingly with excellent reason,) may be also said for virtue's being more common than vice.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="184"/>
Quere, Whether beauty do not require as much an opposition of lines, as it does an harmony of colours?</P>
<P>The passion for antiquity, as such, seems in some measure opposite to the taste for beauty or perfection. It is rather the foible of a lazy and pusillanimous dis∣position, looking back and resting with pleasure on the steps by which we have arrived thus far, than the bold and enterprising spirit of a genius, whose ambition fires him only to reach the goal. Such as is described (on another occasion) in the zealous and active charioteer of Horace:</P>
<Q><L>"—hunc atque hunc superare laboret.</L>
<L>"Instat equis auriga suos vincentibus; illum</L>
<L>"Praeteritum temnens extremos inter euntem."</L></Q>
<P>Again, the</P>
<P>"Nil actum reputans, si quid restaret agendum" is the least applicable, of any character, to a mere anti∣quarian; who, instead of endeavouring to improve or to excel, contents himself, perhaps, with discovering the very name of a first inventor; or with tracing back an art that is flourishing, to the very first source of its original deformity.</P>
<P>I have heard it claimed by adepts in music, that the pleasure it imparts to a natural ear, which owes little or nothing to cultivation, is by no means to be compar∣ed to what they feel themselves from the most perfect composition—The state of question may be best explained by a recourse to objects that are analagous—Is a coun∣try fellow less struck with beauty than a philosopher or an anatomist, who knows how that beauty is produced? Surely no. On the other hand, an attention to the ef∣fect—They may, indeed, feel a pleasure of another sort.—The faculty of reason may obtain some kind of balance, for what the more sensible faculty of the ima∣gination loses.</P>
<P>I am much inclined to suppose our ideas of beauty de∣pend greatly upon habit—what I mean is, upon the fa∣miliarity with objects which we happen to have seen since we came into the world.—Our taste for uniformity,
<PB N="168" REF="185"/>
from what we have observed in the individual parts of nature, a man, a tree, a beast, a bird, or infect, &amp;c.—our taste for regularity from what is within our power to observe in the several perfections of the whole system.</P>
<P>A landscape, for instance, is always irregular, and to use regularity in painting, or gardening, would make our work unnatural and disagreeable. Thus we allow beauty to the different, and almost opposite, proportions of all animals.</P>
<P>There is, I think, a beauty in some forms, inde∣pendent of any use to which they can be applied. I know not whether this may not be resolved into smoothness of surface; with variety to a certain degree, that is com∣prehensible without much difficulty.</P>
<P>As to the dignity of colours, quere, whether those that affect the eye most forcibly, for instance, scarlet, may not claim the first place; allowing their beauty to cloy soonest; and other colours, the next, according to their impulse; allowing them to produce a more durable pleasure?</P>
<P>It may be convenient to divide beauty into the abso∣lute and relative. Absolute is that abovementioned. Relative is that by which an object pleases, through the relation it bears to some other.</P>
<P>Our taste of beauty is, perhaps, compounded of all the ideas that have entered the imagination from our birth. This seems to occasion the difrerent opinions that prevail concerning it. For instance, a foreign eye esteems those features and dresses handsome, which we think deformed.</P>
<P>Is it not then likely that those who have seen most objects, throughout the universe, "caeteris paribus," will be the most impartial judges: because they will judge truest of the general proportion which was intend∣ed by the Creator; and is best.</P>
<P>The beauty of most objects is partly of the absolute and partly of the relative kind. A Corinthian pillar has some beauty dependent on its variety and smooth∣ness: which I would call absolute; it has also a relative beauty, dependent on its taperness and f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liage; which,
<PB N="169" REF="186"/>
authors say, was first copied from the leaves of plants, and the shape of a tree.</P>
<P>Uniformity should, perhaps, be added as another source of absolute beauty (when it appears in one single object.) I do not know any other reason, but that it renders the whole more easily comprehended. It seems that nature herself considers it as beauty, as the external parts of the human frame are made uniform to please the sight; which is rarely the case of the internal, that are not seen.</P>
<P>Hutchinson determines absolute beauty to depend on this and on variety; and says it is in a compound ratio of both. Thus an octagon excels a square; and a square, a figure of unequal sides: but carry variety to an extreme, and it loses its effect. For instance, multi∣ply the number of angles till the mind loses the uniform∣ity of parts, and the figure is less pleasing; or, as it approaches nearer to a round, it may be said to be rob∣bed of its variety.</P>
<P>But, amidst all these eulogiums of variety, it is pro∣per to observe, that novelty sometimes requires a little abatement. I mean, that some degree of familiarity in∣troduces a discovery of relative beauty, more than ade∣quate to the bloom of novelty.—This is, now and then, obvious in the features of a face, the air of some tunes, and the flavour of some dishes. In short, it requires some familiarity to become acquainted with the rela∣tion that parts bear unto the whole, or one object to another.</P>
<P>Variety, in the same object, where the beauty does not depend on imitation (which is the case in foliage, bustos, basso-relievos, painting,) requires uniformity. For instance, an octagon is much more beautiful than a figure of unequal sides; which is at once various and disagreeable.</P>
