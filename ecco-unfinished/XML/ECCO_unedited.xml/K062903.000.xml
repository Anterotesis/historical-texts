<HEAD>The ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The subject propos'd. Address to Mr. <HI>ONSLOW.</HI> A pros∣pect
of the fields ready for harvest. Reaping. A tale.
A harvest sterm. Shooting and hunting, their barbari∣ty.
A ludicrous account of fox-hunting. A view of an
orchard. Wall-fruit. A vineyard. A description of
Fogs, frequent in the latter part of <HI>AUTUMN:</HI> whence a
digression, enquiring into the rise of fountains and rivers.
Birds of season considered, that now shift their habitation.
The prodigious number of them that cover the northern
and western Isles of <HI>SCOTLAND.</HI> Hence a view of the
country. A prospect of the discoloured, fading woods.
After a gentle dusky day, moon-light. Autumnal Me∣teors.
Morning: to which succeeds a calm, pure, sun∣shine
day, such as usually shuts up the season. The har∣vest
being gathered in, the country dissolv'd in joy. The
whole concludes with a panegyrick on a philosophical coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry
life.</P>

<L>These are thy blessings <HI>Industry!</HI> rough Power!</L>

<L>And all the soft civility of life:</L>

<L>With various powers of deep efficiency<MILESTONE N="50"/></L>
<L>Implanted, and profusely pour'd around</L>
<L>Materials infinite; but idle all.</L>
<L>Still unexerted, in th' unconscious breast,</L>

<L>And still the sad barbarian, roving, mix'd</L>

<L>Fought the fierce tusky boar: a shivering wretch!</L>
<L>Aghast, and comfortless, when the red north,<MILESTONE N="60"/></L>
<L>With winter charged, let the mixt tempest fly,</L>
<L>Hail, rain, and snow, and bitter-breathing frost.</L>
<L>Then to the shelter of the hut he fled;</L>
<L>And the wild season, sordid, pin'd away.</L>
<L>For home he had not; home is the resort<MILESTONE N="65"/></L>
<L>Of love, of joy, of peace, and plenty, where,</L>

<L>But this the rugged savage never felt,</L>

<L>His feeble force by the mechanic powers,</L>

<L>The life-refining Soul of decent wit:</L>

<L>To pomp, to pleasure, elegance, and grace;</L>

<L>Set science, wisdom, glory in his view,<MILESTONE N="100"/></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hence every form of cultivated life<MILESTONE N="115"/></L>
<L>In order set, protected, and inspir'd,</L>
<L>Into perfection wrought. Uniting all,</L>
<L>Society grew numerous, high, polite,</L>

<L>And stretching street on street by thousands led,<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>From twining woody haunts, and the tough yew</L>
<L>To bows strong-straining, her aspiring sons.</L>
<L>'Twas nought but labour, the whole dusky groupe</L>
<L>Of clustering houses, and of mingling men,</L>
<L>Restless design, and execution strong.<MILESTONE N="125"/></L>
<L>In every street the sounding hammer ply'd</L>
<L>His massy task; while the corrosive file,</L>

<L>Row'd, regular, to harmony; around,<MILESTONE N="140"/></L>
<L>The boat, light-skimming, stretch'd its oary wings;</L>
<L>While deep the various voice of fervent toil</L>
<L>From bank to bank increas'd; whence ribb'd with oak,</L>
<L>To bear the <HI>British</HI> thunder, black and bold,</L>
<L>The roaring vessel rush'd into the main.<MILESTONE N="145"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then too the pillar'd dome, magnific, heav'd</L>
<L>His ample roof; and <HI>Luxury</HI> within</L>
<L>Pour'd out her glittering stores. The canvas smooth,</L>
<L>With glowing life protuberant to the view</L>
<L>Embodied rose. The statue seem'd to breathe,<MILESTONE N="150"/></L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
And soften into flesh beneath the touch</L>
<L>Of forming art, imagination-flush'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All is the gift of <HI>Industry;</HI> whate'er</L>
<L>Exalts, embellishes, and renders life</L>
<L>Delightful. Pensive <HI>Winter</HI> chear'd by him<MILESTONE N="155"/></L>
<L>Sits at the social fire, and happy hears</L>
<L>Th' excluded tempest idly rave along.</L>
<L>His harden'd fingers deck the gaudy <HI>Spring.</HI></L>
<L>Without him <HI>Summer</HI> were an arid waste;</L>
<L>Nor to th' <HI>autumnal</HI> months could thus transmit<MILESTONE N="160"/></L>
<L>These full, mature, immeasurable stores,</L>
<L>That, waving round, recal my wandering song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as the morning trembles o'er the sky,</L>
<L>And, unperceiv'd, unfolds the spreading day;</L>
<L>Before the ripen'd field the reapers stand,<MILESTONE N="165"/></L>
<L>In fair array; each by the lass he loves,</L>
<L>To bear the rougher part and mitigate</L>
<L>By nameless gentle offices her toil.</L>
<L>At once they stoop, and swell the lusty sheaves;</L>
<L>While, bandied round and round, the rural talk,<MILESTONE N="170"/></L>
<L>The rural scandal, and the rural jest</L>
<L>Fly hearty to deceive the tedious time,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
And chearly steal the sultry hours away.</L>
<L>Behind the master walks, builds up the shocks;</L>
<L>And, conscious, glancing oft this way and that<MILESTONE N="175"/></L>
<L>His sated eye, feels his heart heave with joy.</L>
<L>The gleaners spread around, and here and there,</L>
<L>Spike after spike their sparing harvest pick.</L>
<L>Be not too narow, husband-men! but fling</L>
<L>From the full sheaf, with charitable stealth,<MILESTONE N="180"/></L>
<L>The liberal handful. Think, oh grateful think!</L>
<L>How good the <HI>God</HI> of harvest is to you;</L>
<L>Who pours abundance o'er your flowing fields;</L>
<L>While these unhappy partners of your kind</L>
<L>Wide-hover round you like the fouls of heaven,<MILESTONE N="185"/></L>
<L>And ask their humble dole. The various turns</L>
<L>Of fortune ponder; that your sons may want</L>
<L>What now, with hard reluctance, faint, ye give.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The lovely young <HI>Lavinia</HI> once had friends;</L>
<L>And fortune smil'd, deceitful, on her birth.<MILESTONE N="190"/></L>
<L>For in her helpless years depriv'd of all,</L>
<L>Of every stay, save innocence and <HI>Heaven,</HI></L>
<L>She with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,</L>
<L>And poor, liv'd in a cottage lost far up</L>
<L>Amid the windings of a woody vale;<MILESTONE N="195"/></L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Safe from the cruel blasting arts of man;</L>
<L>Almost on <HI>Nature</HI>'s common bounty fed,</L>
<L>Like the gay birds that sung them to repose,</L>
<L>Content, and careless of to-morrow's fare.</L>
<L>Her form was fresher than the morning-rose,<MILESTONE N="200"/></L>
<L>When the dew wets its leaves; unstain'd, and pure,</L>
<L>As is the lilly, or the mountain snow.</L>
<L>The modest virtues mingled in her eyes,</L>
<L>Still on the ground deject, and darting all</L>
<L>Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:<MILESTONE N="205"/></L>
<L>Or when the stories that her mother told,</L>
<L>Of what her faithless fortune flatter'd once,</L>
<L>Thrill'd in her thought, they like the dewy star</L>
<L>Of evening, shone in tears. A native grace</L>
<L>Sat fair-proportion'd on her polish'd limbs,<MILESTONE N="210"/></L>
<L>Veil'd in a simple robe; for loveliness</L>
<L>Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,</L>
<L>But is when unadorn'd adorn'd the most.</L>
<L>Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,</L>
<L>Recluse among the Woods; if city-dames<MILESTONE N="215"/></L>
<L>Will deign their faith. And thus she went compell'd</L>
<L>By strong necessity, with as serene,</L>
<L>And pleas'd a look as patience can put on,</L>
<L>To glean <HI>Palaemon</HI>'s fields. The pride of swains</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<HI>Palaemon</HI> was, the generous, and the rich,<MILESTONE N="220"/></L>
<L>Who led the rural life in all its joy,</L>
<L>And elegance, such as <HI>Arcadian</HI> song</L>
<L>Transmits from ancient, incorrupted times;</L>
<L>When tyrant custom had not shackled man,</L>
<L>And free to follow nature was the mode.<MILESTONE N="225"/></L>
<L>He then, his fancy with autumnal scenes</L>
<L>Amusing, chanc'd beside his reaper-train</L>
<L>To walk, when poor <HI>Lavinia</HI> drew his eye;</L>
<L>Unconscious of her power, and turning quick</L>
<L>With unaffected blushes from his gaze.<MILESTONE N="230"/></L>
<L>He saw her charming, but he saw not half</L>
<L>The charms her down-cast modesty conceal'd.</L>
<L>That very moment love and chast desire</L>
<L>Sprung in his bosom, to himself unknown;</L>
<L>For still the world prevail'd, and its dread laugh<MILESTONE N="235"/></L>
<L>Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn,</L>
<L>Should his heart own a gleaner in the field:</L>
<L>And thus in secret to his soul he sigh'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What pity! that so delicate a form,</L>
<L>By beauty kindled, and harmonious shap'd,<MILESTONE N="240"/></L>
<L>Where sense sincere, and goodness seem'd to dwell,</L>
<L>Should be devoted to the rude embrace</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="15"/>
Of some indecent clown? She looks, methinks,</L>
<L>Of old <HI>Acasto</HI>'s line; and to my mind</L>
<L>Recals that patron of my happy life,<MILESTONE N="245"/></L>
<L>From whom my liberal fortune took its rise;</L>
<L>Now to the dust gone down; his houses, lands,</L>
<L>And once fair-spreading family dissolv'd.</L>
<L>I've heard that, in some waste obscure retreat,</L>
<L>Urg'd by remembrance sad, and decent pride,<MILESTONE N="250"/></L>
<L>Far from those scenes which knew their better days,</L>
<L>His aged widow and his daughter live;</L>
<L>Whom yet my fruitless search could never find.</L>
<L>Romantick wish, would this the daughter were!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When, strict enquiring, from herself he found<MILESTONE N="255"/></L>
<L>She was the same, the daughter of his friend,</L>
<L>The bountiful <HI>Acasto;</HI> who can speak</L>
<L>The mingling passion that surpriz'd his heart,</L>
<L>And thro' his nerves in shivering transport ran?</L>
<L>Then blaz'd his smother'd flame, avow'd, and bold;<MILESTONE N="260"/></L>
<L>And as he run her, ardent, o'er and o'er,</L>
<L>Love, gratitude, and pity wept at once.</L>
<L>Confus'd, and frighten'd at his sudden tears,</L>
<L>Her rising beauties flush'd a higher bloom,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
As thus <HI>Palaemon,</HI> passionate, and just,<MILESTONE N="265"/></L>
<L>Pour'd out the pious rapture of his soul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And art thou then <HI>Acasto</HI>'s dear remains?</L>
<L>She, whom my restless gratitude has sought</L>
<L>So long in vain? Oh yes! the very same,</L>
<L>The soften'd image of my noble friend,<MILESTONE N="270"/></L>
<L>Alive, his every feature, every look,</L>
<L>More elegantly touch'd. Fairer than spring!</L>
<L>Thou sole surviving blossom from the root,</L>
<L>That nourish'd up my fortune, say, ah where,</L>
<L>In what unsmiling desart, hast thou drawn<MILESTONE N="275"/></L>
<L>The kindest aspect of delighted heaven?</L>
<L>Into such beauty spread? and blown so white?</L>
<L>Tho' poverty's cold wind, and crushing rain,</L>
<L>Beat keen, and heavy, on thy tender years.</L>
<L>O let me now, into a richer soil,<MILESTONE N="280"/></L>
<L>Transplant thee safe! where vernal suns, and showers,</L>
<L>Diffuse their warmest, largest influence;</L>
<L>And of my garden be the pride, and joy!</L>
<L>It ill befits thee, oh it ill befits</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Acasto</HI>'s daughter, his, whose open stores,<MILESTONE N="285"/></L>
<L>Tho' vast, were little to his ampler heart,</L>
<L>The Father of a country, thus to pick</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="17"/>
The very refuse of those harvest-fields,</L>
<L>His bounty taught to gain, and right enjoy.</L>
<L>Then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand,<MILESTONE N="290"/></L>
<L>But ill apply'd to such a rugged task;</L>
<L>With harvest shining all these fields are thine;</L>
<L>And, if my wishes may presume so far,</L>
<L>Their master too, who then indeed were blest,</L>
<L>To make the daughter of <HI>Acasto</HI> so.<MILESTONE N="295"/></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here ceas'd the youth: yet still his speaking eye</L>
<L>Express'd the sacred triumph of his soul,</L>
<L>With conscious virtue, gratitude, and love,</L>
<L>Above the vulgar joy divinely rais'd.</L>
<L>Nor waited he reply. Won by the charm<MILESTONE N="300"/></L>
<L>Of goodness irresistible, and all</L>
<L>In sweet disorder lost, she blush'd content.</L>
<L>The news immediate to her mother brought,</L>
<L>While, pierc'd with anxious thought, she pin'd away</L>
<L>The lonely Moments for <HI>Lavinia</HI>'s fate;<MILESTONE N="305"/></L>
<L>Amaz'd, and scarce believing what she heard,</L>
<L>Joy seiz'd her wither'd veins, and one bright gleam</L>
<L>Of setting life shone on her evening-hours:</L>
<L>Not less enraptur'd than the happy pair;</L>
<L>Who flourish'd long in mutual bliss, and rear'd<MILESTONE N="310"/></L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="18"/>
A numerous offspring, lovely like themselves,</L>
<L>And good, the grace of all the country round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Defeating oft the labours of the year,</L>
<L>The sultry south collects a potent blast.</L>
<L>At first, the groves are scarcely seen to stir<MILESTONE N="315"/></L>
<L>Their trembling tops; and a still murmur runs</L>
<L>Along the soft-inclining fields of corn.</L>
<L>But as th' aereal tempest fuller swells;</L>
<L>And in one mighty stream, invisible,</L>
<L>Immense, the whole excited atmosphere,<MILESTONE N="320"/></L>
<L>Impetuous rushes o'er the sounding world;</L>
<L>Strain'd to the root, the stooping forest pours</L>
<L>A rustling shower of yet untimely leaves.</L>
<L>High-beat, the circling mountains eddy in,</L>
<L>From the bare wild, the dissipated storm,<MILESTONE N="325"/></L>
<L>And send it in a torrent down the vale.</L>
<L>Expos'd, and naked, to its utmost rage,</L>
<L>Thro' all the sea of harvest rolling round,</L>

<L>Tho' plyant to the blast, its seizing force;<MILESTONE N="330"/></L>
<L>Or whirl'd in air, or into vacant chaff</L>
<L>Shook waste. And sometimes too a burst of rain,</L>
<L>Swept from the black horizon, broad, descends</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
In one continuous flood. Still over head</L>
<L>The glomerating tempest glows, and still<MILESTONE N="335"/></L>
<L>The deluge deepens; till the fields around</L>
<L>Lie sunk, and flatted, in the sordid wave.</L>
<L>Sudden the ditches swell; the meadows swim.</L>
<L>Red, from the hills, innumerable streams</L>
<L>Tumultuous roar; and high above its banks<MILESTONE N="340"/></L>
<L>The river lift; before whose weighty rush,</L>
<L>Herds, flocks, and harvests, cottages, and swains,</L>
<L>Roll mingled down; all that the winds had spar'd,</L>

<L>And well-earn'd treasures of the painful year.<MILESTONE N="345"/></L>
<L>Fled to some eminence, the husbandman,</L>
