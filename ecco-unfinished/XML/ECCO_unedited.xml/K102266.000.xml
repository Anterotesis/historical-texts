<P>To You, MY DEAR FRIENDS, I beg
leave to inscribe this little Miscellany. To
You its Author was well known: Ye were
pleased, even from his childhood, to inter∣est
yourselves in his welfare: and towards
You, on account of your eminent virtues
and abilities, and of that unreserved and
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
uninterrupted friendship with which he
knew Ye had, for more than Thirty years,
honoured his father, his Gratitude and Ve∣neration
were peculiarly strong. These are
the reasons which induce me to take the
liberty of addressing You on the present
occasion.</P>
<P>OF my conduct in making this collec∣tion
there is one circumstance which may
seem to need an apology; and that is, my
putting together in the same volume pieces
so different in style and character. I might
say, that many writers and editors have
done the same thing without incurring
blame. But I have another and perhaps
a better reason. I wished to give such
proofs as could be had, and might be pub∣lished,
of the various talents of the Au∣thor;
and, for the sake of the example, to
show, that, though studious and learned,
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
he was neither austere nor formal; and
that in him the strictest piety and modes∣ty
were united with the utmost chearful∣ness,
and even playfulness, of disposition.</P>
<CLOSER>I have the honour to be,

<HEAD>OF THE
AUTHOR's LIFE &amp; CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATE>28. November 1790.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I INTEND to write a short account of the life, e∣ducation,
and character, of my Son now deceased.
It will innocently, and perhaps not unprofitably,
amuse some hours of this melancholy season, when
my mind can settle on nothing else; and, whether
it be published or not, a circumstance on which
I have as yet formed no resolution, it will be an
acceptable present to those to whom I may send it.
The account, though drawn up by the hand of a
friend, will not in any particular be erroneous. In
order to convey a favourable notion of the per∣son
of whom I speak, I have nothing to do, but to
tell the simple truth.</P>
<P>JAMES HAY BEATTIE was born in Aberdeen
the sixth of November, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and sixty eight. He was baptized
by the name of <HI>James Hay,</HI> by permission of JAMES
HAY EARL OF ERROLL, who had patronized me at
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
an early period of my life, and ever after honour∣ed
me with his friendship: a nobleman, who, to
a competent knowledge of classical learning, and
other accomplishments becoming his rank, joined
uncommon elegance, dignity, and affability of
manners; with benevolence unbounded; an ex∣emplary
regard to the institutions of religion; and
a spirit of true patriotism, whereof those parts of
his country, with which he was connected, do still
feel, and it is hoped will long feel, the salutary in∣fluence.</P>
<P>To parents, and other near relations, infancy is
very interesting; but can hardly supply any thing
of narrative. My son's was in no respect remark∣able,
unless, perhaps, for a mildness and docility
of nature, which adhered to him through life. I
do not remember that I ever had occasion to re∣prove
him above three or four times: bodily chas∣tisement
he never experienced at all. It would in∣deed
have been most unreasonable to apply this
mode of discipline to one, whose supreme concern
it ever was to know his duty, and to do it.</P>
<P>THE first rules of morality I taught him were,
to speak truth, and keep a secret; and I never
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
found that in a single instance he transgressed ei∣ther.</P>
<P>THE doctrines of religion I wished to impress on
his mind, as soon as it might be prepared to receive
them; but I did not see the propriety of making
him commit to memory theological sentences, or
any sentences, which it was not possible for him
to understand. And I was desirous to make a trial
how far his own reason could go in tracing out,
with a little direction, the great and first principle
of all religion, the being of GOD. The follow∣ing
fact is mentioned, not as a proof of superior
sagacity in him (for I have no doubt that most
children would in like circumstances think as he
did), but merely as a moral or logical experiment.</P>
<P>HE had reached his fifth [or sixth] year, knew
the alphabet, and could read a little; but had
received no particular information with respect
to the Author of his being: because I thought he
could not yet understand such information; and
because I had learned from my own experience,
that to be made to repeat words not understood is
extremely detrimental to the faculties of a young
mind. In a corner of a little garden, without in∣forming
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
any person of the circumstance, I wrote
in the mould, with my finger, the three initial let∣ters
of his name; and, sowing garden cresses in
the furrows, covered up the seed, and smoothed
the ground. Ten days after, he came running to
me, and with astonishment in his countenance told
me, that his name was growing in the garden. I
laughed at the report, and seemed inclined to dis∣regard
it; but he insisted on my going to see what
had happened. Yes, said I carelessly, on coming
to the place, I see it is so; but there is nothing in
this worth notice; it is mere chance: and I went
away. He followed me, and, taking hold of my
coat, said with some earnestness, it could not be
mere chance; for that some body must have con∣trived
matters so as to produce it.—I pretend not
to give his words, or my own, for I have forgot∣ten
both; but I give the substance of what passed
between us in such language as we both under∣stood.—So
you think, I said, that what appears so
regular as the letters of your name cannot be by
chance. Yes, said he, with firmness, I think so.
Look at yourself, I replied, and consider your
hands and fingers, your legs and feet, and other
limbs; are they not regular in their appearance,
and useful to you? He said, they were. Came you
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
then hither, said I, by chance? No, he answered,
that cannot be; something must have made me.
And who is that something, I asked. He said, he
did not know. (I took particular notice, that he
did not say, as Rousseau fancies a child in like cir∣cumstances
would say, that his parents made him.)
I had now gained the point I aimed at: and saw,
that his reason taught him, (though he could not
so express it) that what begins to be must have a
cause, and that what is formed with regularity
must have an intelligent cause. I therefore told
him the name of the Great Being who made him
and all the world; concerning whose adorable na∣ture
I gave him such information as I thought he
could in some measure comprehend. The lesson
affected him greatly, and he never forgot either it,
or the circumstance that introduced it.</P>
<P>AT home, from his Mother and me, he learned
to read and write. His pronunciation was not
correct, as may well be supposed: but it was de∣liberate
and significant, free from provincial pecu∣liarities,
and such as an Englishman would have
understood; and afterwards, when he had passed
a few summers in England, it became more ele∣gant
than what is commonly heard in North Bri∣tain.
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
He was early warned against the use of
Scotch words and other similar improprieties;
and his dislike to them was such, that he soon
learned to avoid them; and, after he grew up,
could never endure to read what was written in
any of the vulgar dialects of Scotland. He look∣ed
at Mr Allan Ramsay's poems, but did not re∣lish
them. Whether the more original strains of
Mr Burns ever came in his way, I do not certain∣ly
know.</P>
<P>WHEN he had compleated his seventh year, be∣ing
now a good reader, a ready writer, and well
acquainted with the catechism published by the
pious and learned Dr Watts, I made him attend
the grammar school of Aberdeen; where, under
the inspection of his grandfather Dr Dun and other
able masters, he acquired, with facility and exact∣ness,
the elements of the Latin tongue, and read
those parts of the classick authors which are usual∣ly
taught in our schools. About the same time he
studied at home with me some of the best tales in
Ovid's Metamorphosis, and several books of Vir∣gil.
I was at particular pains to instruct him in
certain niceties of the grammatical and critical
art, which are not found in the most common
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
grammars, and by little and little to initiate him
in the principles of universal or philosophical gram∣mar.
This, he told me afterwards, was of great
use to him. Ovid did not much engage his atten∣tion,
though he was well enough pleased with
Deucalion's deluge, Phaethon, Cadmus, Acteon and
his dogs; but it was easy to see, from the interest
he took in Virgil's narrative, and the emphasis
with which, of his own accord, he pronounced his
verses, that he was wonderfully affected with the
harmony and other excellencies of that poet. He
has told me since, that he then got by heart, se∣veral
entire books of the Eneid, and took great
delight in repeating them when at leisure and a∣lone:
and he often, about this time, spoke with
peculiar complacency, of that description of night,
in the fourth book (v. 522) which he said he fre∣quently
recollected, in order to sooth his mind,
when any troublesome thought occurred in the
night to discompose him.</P>
<P>DRAWING he was early accustomed to, and at∣tained
considerable proficiency in: but his other
avocations, and his being subject to headachs, pre∣vented
his applying to it so much as to become a
very great proficient. The theory of perspective
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
was familiar to him. In ludicrous <HI>caricatura</HI> he
had boundless invention.</P>
<P>KNOWING that his constitution was very deli∣cate,
and finding him inclined to study rather too
much than too little, I was careful, in the first
part, and indeed through the whole, of his life, not
only to caution him against immoderate study,
by informing him of its dreadful consequences;
but also to contrive for him such amusement as
would decoy him from his books, strengthen his
body, and engage his mind. With this view, as
soon as he could handle a small musquet, I put
him under the tuition of a sergeant, who taught
him the military exercise. Not long after, I made
him attend an expert fencing master, till he became
very skilful in the management of the small sword.
Archery, likewise, or shooting with the long bow,
he practised for years, and with good success,
reading Roger Ascham on the subject; and ac∣quiring
at the same time great dexterity in the use
of the sling: and to these antient exercises he ad∣ded
those of fishing and fowling. With fire-arms
I did not trust him rashly; but he was to such a
degree attentive and considerate, that before his
fifteenth year I found him as worthy of that trust
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
as any person could be. He laboured for several
weeks in endeavouring to learn to swim, and had
at that time a companion who was completely
master of the art: but it appeared at last that the
chilness of the sea-water did him more harm than
good.</P>
<P>THE exercise to which he seemed to have the
strongest disinclination was dancing. By my ad∣vice
he attended a master of it for many months,
and I believe made the usual progress; but, on
leaving that school, begged I would never desire
him to dance: a favour which I readily granted.
I know not whether he had adopted Cicero's
opinion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro Muraena.</NOTE>, that no man dances who is not either
drunk or mad: but he told me, that to his habits
of thinking and feeling it was extremely incon∣gruous,
being in most particulars too finical, and
in every particular too ostentatious.</P>
<P>HE left off fowling, when about the age of se∣venteen;
in his papers of that time I find hints of
his being not quite satisfied of its lawfulness.
Fishing, however, he did not discontinue; he made
indeed a study of it, or at least of Isaak Walton's
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
very ingenious and entertaining book on that sub∣ject:
for he thought there could be no sin in do∣ing
what was practised, or countenanced, by the
first teachers of Christianity. Those sorts of it he
never engaged in, which give great pain, or pro∣tract
the sufferings of the poor animal. In all the
little manufactures of the angler he was complete∣ly
skilled; as well as in all the arts of the fowler,
even to the training of a setting dog. This, with ma∣ny
other trifling particulars (as some would think
them) I mention, that the reader may see, it was
not my purpose to force him, by too rapid a pro∣gress,
from childhood into premature manhood;
which I have seen attempted by well-meaning pa∣rents,
but never with desirable success: I wished
him to prepare himself, in early youth, by little
and little, for acting the part of a man; but, in the
meantime, not to forget that he was a boy.</P>
<P>AT the age of thirteen, having passed through
the forms of the grammar school, giving the ut∣most
satisfaction to all his masters, he was entered
a student in Marischal college. The first, or <HI>Greek,</HI>
class, as it is called, he attended two years; as I
was anxious that he should be a proficient in that
noble language, which is every where too much
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
neglected: so that, as a student of languages,
mathematicks, and philosophy, he attended col∣lege
five years: a year more than is usually
thought necessary in Scotland, or at least in the
university of Marischal college, to qualify one for
the first Academical degree, of Master of Arts.
He studied Greek under Mr Professor Stuart;
Natural and Civil history under Dr Skene; Na∣tural
Philosophy under Mr Professor Copland;
Mathematicks, under Dr Hamilton; Chemistry
under Dr French; and Moral Philosophy, Logick,
and Rhetorick, under my care. In all the scien∣ces,
his proficiency was so great, that the fondest
and most ambitious parent could not have wish∣ed
it greater: and his whole behaviour, at school
and college, was not only irreproachable, but ex∣emplary.
He was admitted to the degree of mas∣ter
of arts in April 1786.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time, the Botanical and other writ∣ings
of Linneus caught his attention, and he stu∣died
them with great assiduity and delight; being
much assisted in that study by his and my learn∣ed
friends Dr Campbell Principal of Marischall
college, and Dr Laing minister of the church-of-England
congregation at Peterhead. Theology al∣so
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
he studied under the care of Dr Campbell and
Dr Gerard. But this was not the commencement
of his theological pursuits; for from his early
youth he had studied the Holy Scriptures, which
he justly thought to contain the only infallible
system of Christian faith. When he went from
home, if he meant to be absent a few weeks or
days, he took with him a pocket Bible and the
Greek New Testament: and among his papers I
find a little book of Remarks on the Hebrew gram∣mar;
from which it appears he had made progress
in that language.</P>
<P>ON the fourth of June one thousand seven hun∣dred
and eighty seven, His Majesty, upon the re∣commendation
of the university of Marischal col∣lege,
was pleased to appoint him Assistant Pro∣fessor
of Moral Philosophy and Logick. His age
was then not quite nineteen; but to the gentle∣men
of the university his character was so well
known, that they most readily, as well as unani∣mously,
concurred in the recommendation. It
may be thought, that I chose for him this way of
life; and indeed I did so: but not till after he
had given me the most explicit assurance, that he
preferred it to every other. When I told him,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
that in this station he might be very useful, but
could never be rich; his answer was, that he had
never wished to be rich, and that to be useful was his
highest ambition. His fondness for an academi∣cal
life I had long observed: and, although I knew
him sufficiently qualified to be a professor of any
of the sciences usually taught in universities, ex∣cept
Law and Physick, (in both which, however,
he had made considerable progress) I saw, with no
little satisfaction, that moral philosophy, and the
sciences allied to it, were the most congenial to his
talents and character.</P>
<P>ON being inducted into his office he thought it
his duty to lay for some time other studies aside,
and apply himself, solely or chiefly, to what he
thought might be the business of his life. This,
considering what he had already acquired of the
moral sciences, I knew to be unnecessary, and told
him so; desiring him to amuse himself with light∣er
studies, till his bodily constitution should be
more firmly established. He followed my advice;
but at spare hours read the best writers on the
abstract philosophy, particularly Dr Reid, Dr
Campbell, Bishop Butler, Dr Clarke, and Mr Bax∣ter
author of an excellent treatise on the incorpo∣real
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
nature of the human soul. When I asked
whether he understood Baxter, and Butler, and
Clarke's demonstration <HI>a priori</HI> of the Divine Ex∣istence,
telling him that I had formerly thought
them not a little abstruse, he said he was not sen∣sible
of their abstruseness; for that to the same
modes of thinking he had been accustomed for se∣veral
years: and I found by his conversation, and
have since found more particularly by the papers
he has left, that he understood them perfectly.</P>
<P>HE had before this time acquired the elements
of musical performance: I advised him now to
apply to it with assiduity; knowing, by my own
experience, that after the fatigue of study it might
be an innocent and useful recreation. He did
so; and learned to perform with good expression
upon the organ and violin; studying at the same
time the theory of the art, in the works of Pas∣quali
and Holden; and, that he might see the the∣ory
exemplified, perusing, with his wonted accu∣racy,
some of the more elegant and affecting com∣positions
of Handel, Corelli, Geminiani, Avison,
and Jackson. These were the musical authors
who stood highest in his esteem. The musick just
now in vogue had no charms for him: he said
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
it wanted simplicity, pathos, and harmony; and
in the execution depended so much on rapidity of
finger, or what may be called slight of hand, that
practitioners must throw away more time than he
could spare, before they could acquire any dexte∣rity
in it. He was delighted with the sweet and
classical correctness of Corelli; and with the af∣fecting
melodies of Jackson, so well adapted to the
words that accompany them: but the variety and
sublimity of Handel's invention filled him with
rapture and astonishment. He thought him the
Shakspeare of musick, or rather the Shakspeare and
Milton united; and many of his simpler songs he
could sing very agreeably, enforcing their expres∣sion
with a thorough base on the organ. He was
pleased too with some of the antient Scotch and
Welch airs; but made no account of the quick
jigging Scotch tunes, though he did not think
them all equally bad. He seemed to consider the
frequent performance of these as having the same
tendency to debase a musical ear, which the ha∣bitual
use of a barbarous or provincial dialect has
in corrupting one's taste in language and stile.
He had studied <HI>counterpoint</HI> and was profoundly
skilled in it; I find among his papers a great deal
written on that subject; and I have seen fugues
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
of his contrivance which would not have discre∣dited
a more experienced musician. When I ask∣ed
what made him think of studying the theory
as well as practice of musick, he said, that, as it
was impossible, without knowing prosody, and the
laws of versification, to have a just sense of the
harmony of Homer and Virgil, so he thought he
could not be suitably affected with musical har∣mony,
if he did not understand the principles on
which it is constructed.—I shall only add, with
respect to musick, that, though I recommended it
to him, I would by no means do so to all indis∣criminately.
To such young persons as are in a∣ny
degree ostentatious, or inclined, more than they
ought to be, to amusement and company, I think
it a dangerous study. I have known several young
men, of those characters, led by their love of mu∣sick
into bad company, and thence into idleness,
intemperance, and ruin. Catch-clubs, as they are
called, I believe to be particularly dangerous.</P>
<P>THOUGH my Son was now my assistant and col∣league,
it was not my intention to devolve upon
him any of the duties of my office; those except∣ed
for which I might be disqualified by bad health.
For I had long taken pleasure in the employment;
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
and I wished him to be a little further advanced in
life, before he should be engaged in the more la∣borious
parts of it. My health, however, during
the winter 1787-88 was in such a state, that re∣covery
seemed doubtful; and he was obliged,
sooner than I wished, to give proof of ability in
his profession. In this respect he acquitted him∣self,
as in all others. His steadiness, good-nature,
and command of temper, secured his authority as
a teacher; and by his presence of mind, and ready
recollection, he satisfied his audience, that, though
young, he was abundantly qualified to instruct
them. The talents that form a publick speaker he
possessed in an eminent degree. As he could not
allow himself to study any thing superficially, all
his knowledge was accurate, and in his memory
so well arranged, that he was never at a loss; his
language perspicuous and correct, flowing easily,
without hesitation, hurry, or apparent effort; his
voice distinct and manly; his manner never de∣clamatory,
or ostentatious, but simple, concise, and
to the purpose: and he was at all times singular∣ly
happy in recollecting familiar examples to il∣lustrate
his subject. In this last respect; I mean
in passing instantaneously from one thought or i∣mage
to another that was <HI>like it;</HI> he possessed such
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
exuberance and correctness of fancy, especially in
familiar conversation, that I have often thought,
if he had been ambitious to appear in the world
as a <HI>man of wit,</HI> that he would not have met with
many superiors. But he had no such ambition:
he would amuse himself in this way, to divert me,
or any other intimate friend; but could not bear
to draw upon himself publick notice.</P>
<P>IN general company, indeed, he was (though
not awkward) modest to a degree that bordered
on bashfulness; and so silent, that some people
would have thought him inattentive. But noth∣ing
escaped his observation; though what he had
observed he never applied to any improper pur∣pose.
And I have known, not any other person
of his, and very few persons of any, age, who with
so penetrating an eye discerned the characters of
men. I, who knew his opinions on all subjects,
do not remember any instance of his being in this
respect mistaken. Yet so careful was he to avoid
giving offence, that none, but a few of his most
intimate friends, knew that he had such a talent.—I
know not whether I ought to mention, that
in what is called Mimickry he exceeded almost
every other person I have known. But my advice
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
was not necessary to prevent his cultivating that
art. On the stage it may have its use; but in pri∣vate
life he knew how improper it is, and how
dangerous; and of his own accord left it off en∣tirely,
with my hearty approbation.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH with a few minutes of preparation
and a few written notes, (as he wrote short hand
with the utmost readiness) he could qualify himself
sufficiently for giving an hour's lecture on most to∣picks
that occur in Moral Philosophy and Logick,
yet he wished to comprehend the whole course in
a series of written prelections. The composing of
these would, he rightly thought, make him mas∣ter
of his business; and to these, when they were
composed, he could trust as a provision, if bad
health should at any time render him unequal to
the effort of lecturing extempore. But of this plan
he did not live to execute the tenth part. Some of
the prelections he has left in writing may perhaps
at one time or other be laid before the publick.</P>
<P>To make the young scholar perform exercises
in Latin verse, is not now customary, so far as I
know, in any of the schools of North Britain:
which I have long thought a deficiency in our
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
discipline. I wished him to attempt this mode of
composition, resolving however not to urge it, if
he should find it difficult. Accordingly, as soon
as I knew him to be sufficiently master of antient
prosody, I advised him to write Latin verses. He
said, he did not think he could do it, but that,
since I desired it, he would make a trial, provided
I gave him a subject. A lobster happening to be on
the table, I proposed that as the argument of his
first essay: and next day he brought me four hex∣ameters,
which, considering his age and inexpe∣rience
(for he was then only fourteen), I thought
tolerable; and I encouraged him to make further
trials, when he should find himself in the humour
and at leisure. He continued from time to time
to amuse himself in this way, and soon acquired
a facility in it. He found it, he said, of the great∣est
advantage in giving him a ready command of
Latin phraseology; by obliging him to think in
that language, and to revolve in his mind a vari∣ety
of synonymous expressions, while in quest of
that which would suit the measure and sound of
his verse. It must not be imagined that he lost
much time in this study. He applied to it very
seldom, and when he had nothing else to do, and
never, for so I advised, above half an hour in one
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
day. Being urged by me to declare how much
he might do in that half hour, he owned, with a
modest reluctance natural to him on such occa∣sions,
that in half an hour he would sometimes
compose from ten to fifteen or twenty lines. Were
all the half hours he ever employed in this exer∣cise
to be thrown into one sum, they would not a∣mount
to fourteen days.</P>
<P>AMONG his Latin compositions, I find one or
two original odes, and some epistles in imitation
of Horace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The most humourous, and one of the longest, of his poetical essays, is a Latin epistle, (in imitation of Horace) giving a description of a publick entertainment: but to private characters, though it is not satirical, it has so many allusions, that I suppress it, as I know he himself would have done.</NOTE>; and translations of several favourite
English songs, of some detached stanzas from the
<HI>Castle of Indolence,</HI> and of some parts of the <HI>Minstrel.</HI>
Whether he purposed to make a complete version
of this last poem, I know not: his partiality to it
was no doubt excessive; which the good-natured
reader will pardon.</P>
<P>IN November 1786 he translated into Latin verse
Pope's <HI>Elegy</HI> on an unfortunate lady, and the
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
<HI>Messiah</HI> of the same poet. The former was print∣ed,
but without a name; the latter never received
his last emendations. In both these pieces, as
well as in the version of <HI>Sir Balaam,</HI> the translation
has the same number of lines with the original.
His notions of translation were as strict as those
of Horace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is strange that the passage of Horace here alluded to (Epist. ad Pison. v. 133) should have been so generally understood to mean just the contrary of what the poet intended; as if he had been there lay∣ing down rules for <HI>translation,</HI> and disapproving of literal or close translations. The meaning of those words, <HI>Nec verbum verbo cu∣rabis reddere fidus Interpres,</HI> viewed in their connection with what immediately goes before and follows, is this: “It is difficult and hazardous to invent new fables and characters; and a drama∣tick poet may do better to take the subject of his piece from Ho∣mer, than to make the whole of it new. But, in doing this, that he may not incur the blame of exhibiting as his own what be∣longs to another, he must be careful, first, not to make his fable exactly the same with that of the original author; secondly, not translate his words <HI>literally, as a faithful interpreter would do;</HI> and lastly, to conduct his play according to the genius not of e∣pick but of tragick composition.”—Terence was not ashamed of having translated literally: (See Prolog. ad Adelph.) and they who are acquainted with that author will not suppose, either that his translations were inelegant; or that they would have been more elegant if they had been less literal.</NOTE>; he thought it should be as literal as
the genius of the language into which it is made
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
will permit; and that, as closely as possible, it
should imitate the spirit, especially the simplicity
and conciseness, and (if poetical) the harmony, of
the original. Of paraphrastical, or, as they have
been called, <HI>free</HI> translations, he did not approve.
He thought the <HI>freedom</HI> of such interpreters might
be occasioned rather by want of critical skill in
their own or their author's language, than by cor∣rectness
of taste or luxuriancy of genius: at any
rate, whether meant to conceal ignorance, or im∣prove
the original author, he thought that such
versions were misrepresentations, and therefore
unjustifiable. On this principle he must have con∣demned
some juvenile attempts of mine: but I
have reason to think he never saw them; and I
was too much ashamed of them to direct his at∣tention
that way.</P>
<P>THE poetical translation he admired most was
Dobson's <HI>Paradisus Amissus;</HI> which is indeed more
exact, more spirited, more elegant, and more like
its original, than any other I have seen: I cannot
account for its being so much neglected; a judi∣cious
selection of passages from it would be a most
useful school book. He also esteemed very highly
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
Mr Potter's translations of the Greek tragedies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following remark, which I find in one of his letters to me, may deserve attention. “I have read nothing since you left us, but Mr Potter's Translation of Sophocles. The work dis∣plays learning, industry, and genius; and yet it may be doubt∣ed whether it will be popular. In some places, from <HI>too close</HI> an adherence to the original, it almost provokes a smile. When we read the ancient tragedies in their original language, great allow∣ance is made for the simple manners, and for the customs, super∣stitions, and ignorance of those who wrote them. Such too is the harmony of the Greek tongue, and such the dignity it acquires in our estimation, by never appearing in common use, that its very sound will sometimes divert our attention from the feeble∣ness of the sentiment it expresses. But, when we read an Eng∣lish translation, we lose the last advantage totally, and the former circumstances we are apt to overlook. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> might pass very well in a poet of Ionia: yet one is tempted to smile at this solemn prayer of the chorus, near the end of the <HI>Edipus at Co∣lonus,</HI>
<Q><L>Gently meet him in those glades,</L>
<L>When he joins the silent shades;</L>
<L>Ever wakeful, cease t' appal,</L>
<L><HI>Dog of Hell!</HI> on thee I call.”</L></Q>
It would have been better to have retained the proper name <HI>Cer∣berus,</HI> which has nothing ludicrous in the sound.</NOTE>.
In the Virgil of Dryden he owned there were good
lines; but was disgusted with that translator's in∣attention,
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
in too many places, to the sense, and still
more conspicuous inattention, to the spirit, of his
original. Of Pope's Homer he may have read
parts, but never I think went through the whole.
He thought it a pleasing English Poem, but by no
means a faithful exhibition of the genius of Ho∣mer.
On his own attempts in translation he set
no value. He engaged in them as exercises mere∣ly,
for improving himself, or amusing me; and
when he had put them in my hand, and heard
what I thought of them, which I own was always
favourable, he commonly left them with me, and
made no further inquiry about them. The ver∣sion
of Pope's Unfortunate Lady was printed by
my desire, and almost against his will: it was ne∣ver
published; but I sent copies of it to some of
our Friends.</P>
<P>THE reader has seen my motive for recommend∣ing
as an exercise the composition of Latin verses.
I had not the same reason for wishing him to en∣gage
in English poetry. And I had known in∣stances
of young men mistaking the talent of writ∣ing
smooth verses (a talent which may be easily
acquired) for poetical genius; and thence follow∣ing
that idle trade to their own great disadvan∣tage.
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
I had therefore determined, in case of his
attempting it, to dissuade the attempt, if I did not
see in his first essays undoubted indications of po∣etical
invention, with numbers animated, and va∣ried
according to the subject: and such dissuasion
from me I knew <HI>he</HI> would receive with thankful∣ness,
and without being either disheartened or of∣fended.</P>
<P>AMONG his Latin Poems, there is an Alcaick or
Horatian ode on Peterhead, which at my desire
he translated into English verse. It contains an
elegant though brief account of the scenery and
society which he met with in that town and neigh∣bourhood.
He had an attachment to Peterhead,
and wished to pass part of every summer there;
in which I was always willing to indulge him.
The causes of this attachment were neither few
nor trivial. The air of the place had several times
restored his health, when it was declining: the
kind attentions shown him by the better sort of the
people, and their modest and simple manners, had
won his heart: and the situation of the town, al∣most
surrounded by the sea, and in the neighbour∣hood
of a pleasant river and of some of the finest
downs in Great Britain, was very favourable to
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
fishing, rowing, archery, shooting, walking, and
other exercises in which he delighted. Here, too,
he had the company and conversation of our learn∣ed
and pious Friend the reverend Doctor William
Laing; who loved him with great affection; taught
him many things relating to physick, botany, me∣chanicks,
musick, &amp;c.; and took a particular plea∣sure
in devising expedients to amuse him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As an evidence of this gentleman's attachment, I take the li∣berty to quote the following passage from a letter which he sent me a few weeks after my son's death. “As to any memorials of my dear Friend, I have no need of them for keeping up the re∣membrance of him. There is not a corner in my house, where I do not find his handwriting intermixed with mine: there is not an article of any study or science that I can think on, where I do not find his sentiments and mine embodied together, and in regard to which I do not immediately think what he would have said upon the subject. And not only do I find him every where within the house; but also, when I go into the fields, there is not a spot of ground that does not remind me of him: nay, I no sooner fix my attention upon any plant, than it brings into my mind when and where we first settled its <HI>genus</HI> and <HI>species.</HI> How I shall be able to bear the view of our sum∣mer haunts and walks without his company, if it shall please God to spare me to see them, I do not yet know; but the thought of it is at present very painful to me.”</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="35"/>
ONE of the greatest attempts he ever made in
poetry was a didactick poem in English, on the ex∣cellency
of the Christian religion, and its peculiar
efficacy in improving and perfecting the human
soul. He meant, if I mistake not, to extend it to
three books; the first of which, consisting of about
six hundred lines, had been sketched out before I
heard of it. This was, I believe, his first <HI>serious</HI>
effort in English verse. I was much pleased with
the sentiments, and, I own, not a little surprised
(considering the author's age) at the energy of ex∣pression,
vivacity of description, and apposite va∣riety
of numbers, that appeared in several passages.
On the whole I was satisfied, that he had a poeti∣cal
genius; which, when matured by years, and
improved by practice, might, I fondly thought,
produce something considerable. But diffident of
my own opinion, which in a case of this kind
might naturally enough be liable to undue influ∣ence,
I showed it to some Friends; who I thought
would be more impartial, as they were more com∣petent,
judges. They were pleased to think of it
even more highly than I did, and gave him eve∣ry
encouragement to persevere. His absence, how∣ever,
from home, and various avocations, caused
a long intermission of the work: and, when those
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
difficulties were removed, his anxiety to prepare
himself for a right discharge of his duty as a pro∣fessor,
determined him to lay aside for some time this
favourite project; and I heard nothing of it for a
great while. About a year before his death, I ask∣ed
him what was become of it. He said, that, as
soon as he had disengaged himself from his pre∣sent
course of study, he intended to resume, and,
if possible, to finish it, and that he had it much at
heart to do so: “but,” continued he, “I shall
make material alterations in the plan, and I be∣lieve
there is hardly a line that will not under∣go
correction.” When, after his death, I called
to mind this circumstance, and found, on inspect∣ing
his papers, that no alteration had been made,
(the reason of which will presently appear) I was
at first inclined, in justice to his memory, to sup∣press
the whole. It was, however, suggested, that
this would be rather injurious to his memory:
that it was right it should be known that he had
such a design, and had formed such a plan: that
extracts from the poem would throw light on his
character, and do honour both to his heart and to
his understanding: and that there was no reason
to fear, that the severity of criticism would ever
be exerted against a performance, written (hastily,
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
I believe, though with a benevolent purpose) at
the age of seventeen, and of which the author's
subsequent studies and early death had prevented
even the revisal.</P>
<P>OF his ludicrous verses (the greater part of which
will never appear) I have little to say, but that
most of them were written for my amusement,
though few by my desire, and all with surprising
facility. I shall give one example. While he and
I were talking one evening of the humourous
English ballad that begins with these words “Di∣ogenes
surly and proud” &amp;c.; in which, from
peculiarities in the lives and doctrines of the an∣tient
philosophers, it is proved, by ironical argu∣ments,
that they must all have been addicted to
drinking; I happened to say, it was pity our mo∣dern
sages were not in the same way celebrated
in a second part. Two days after he brought me
the stanzas that have the name of <HI>The modern tip∣pling
Philosophers;</HI> in which the spirit of the old
ballad seems to be supported with equal humour,
and certainly not inferiour learning.</P>
<P>WHEN a scheme was in agitation, in the year
1786, for uniting into one the two universities of
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
Aberdeen, his playful muse was not idle; but pro∣duced
many humourous papers in Latin and Eng∣lish,
in prose and verse; which, however, no per∣son
but he and I ever saw. All these I have sup∣pressed;
because it was his opinion, as well as
mine, that what passed on that occasion, between
the two societies, should as soon as possible be for∣gotten.
We both approved of the plan of union,
as thinking it would be highly beneficial to learn∣ing;
but neither ever put himself in a passion up∣on
the subject.</P>
<P>OBSERVING, early in the year 1788, that his
health had suffered from the fatigues of the win∣ter,
and much more, I believe, from anxiety on
account of my illness; and knowing, that he had
a genius in mechanicks, and was master of the
theory of organ-building; I proposed, that he
should pass the ensuing summer at Peterhead, and
there, with Dr Laing's assistance, superinted the
building of an organ for himself. This was in
due time executed. The work employed him a∣bout
five months; and the amusement he derived
from it, and the musick with which it afterwards
supplied him, had the happiest effects on his con∣stitution.
And, to compleat his satisfaction, my
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
health, in consequence of a change of regimen pro∣posed
by my very learned friend Dr James Gre∣gory
of Edinburgh, had become better: and the
organ, when he had set it up, and tuned it, was
found to be singularly good in its kind. We had
now little musical entertainments twice or thrice
a week; which, though to a modish audience they
might have appeared unfashionable, were highly
pleasing to us, and to those friends who were some∣times
present at them. Three of our small band
could sing pretty well; and to the instrumental
part of the concert a violin, violoncello, and organ,
gave tolerable variety.</P>
<P>SOME weeks before the commencement of his
last illness, he asked whether I had any objection
to his studying physick. I was a little alarmed at
the question, and asked in my turn, whether upon
trial he had found his office in the college less a∣greeable
than he thought it would be. “Quite
the contrary,” he replied, “I have found it even
more to my mind than I expected.” He pro∣ceeded
to explain himself, to the best of my re∣membrance,
in the following words. “I foresee
that when I shall have prepared a few lectures,
our long summer vacation will afford me abun∣dance
<PB N="41" REF="40"/>
of leisure. It is true that, in the study of
nature and art, a man can never be without the
means of improvement and liberal recreation.
But there is a duty more indispensable, which I
am anxious to have it in my power to discharge;
I mean, that of relieving the sufferings of my
fellow creatures. To appear in the world as a
physician, or to accept of money for what I may
do in a medical character, is not my plan: Pro∣vidence
has so ordered matters, that I can live,
as well as I wish to live, without that: but I would
fain be useful, occasionally to my friends, and
to the poor especially; for whom however I
will not take it upon me to prescribe, till I shall
have gone through a complete course of medical
study.” I told him, it was impossible for me to
object to a scheme undertaken from motives so lau∣dable:
“all the restraint I would impose, added I,
is, what to you I am continually recommending,
moderate application. Anatomy, botany, che∣mistry,
you already know, and are not ignorant
of pharmacy. Study physick, therefore, since
you desire it; but let it be now and them only,
when you are at leisure; and you will soon be
as great a proficient as many others are, who
acquit themselves in that profession both credi∣tably
<PB N="42" REF="41"/>
and usefully.” It appears from his papers,
that he had been very eager to prepare himself
for doing good in this new employment. But
the time was now at hand, when all his plans of
benevolence were to cease, and all his pursuits in
literature.</P>
<P>IN the night of the thirtieth of November 1789
he was suddenly seized with a violent fit of fever,
attended with excessive trembling and shivering,
such as seemed to threaten his immediate dissolu∣tion.
Medical assistance was instantly procured,
and before morning a perspiration ensued, which
freed him from fever, but left him weak and lan∣guid.
This night must be considered as the end
of his literary career; for, though he lived almost
a year longer, he was never after able to engage
in study that required any energy of mind. From
this time to his death the night sweats continued
to molest him, though they were not often vio∣lent:
and now a decline came on, wonderfully
gradual, though it seemed in general to gain a lit∣tle
ground every week. He made, however, his
daily excursions; and in February was still able
to walk a few miles without fatigue. Attempts
were made to prepare him for a journey in a post
<PB N="43" REF="42"/>
chaise; but without success: every experiment of
this kind, however cautiously conducted, being
followed by a fit of fever unusually severe. Ri∣ding
on horseback he had never found beneficial,
and at this time could not bear at all. Still how∣ever
it was supposed, by the physicians, as well as
by himself, and by me, as he had no cough, nor
difficulty in breathing, nor indeed any positive
pain, that nothing worse was the matter, than
what is called a relaxation of the nervous system;
and that, when the season would permit, a few
weeks of Peterhead would set him up again, as had
happened to him several times in cases apparently
similar. To get thither he was more anxious than
I ever saw him about any other thing that con∣cerned
himself. Thither accordingly we went the
nineteenth of April, and he bore the journey bet∣ter
than I expected. But next day a dreadful
storm set in of rain and wind, which continued a
week, during which it was impossible for him to
leave his room. This confinement broke down
his strength so much, that he could no longer
walk without leaning on somebody's arm; nor
bear the motion of a carriage, unless it went very
slowly. His case was now called by the physicians
a <HI>nervous atrophy;</HI> and Dr Gregory candidly in∣formed
<PB N="44" REF="43"/>
me that, though not desperate, it was dan∣gerous
in the extreme. I need not give a detail
of the transactions of this summer. Let it suffice
to say, that he had every advantage that could
be derived from the most skilful and affectionate
physicians, particularly Dr Skene, Dr Gregory,
Dr Laing, Dr Bannerman, and Mr Wilson sur∣geon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In consideration of Mr Wilson's affectionate and judicious at∣tention, the University of Marischal college, who were no stran∣gers to his medical and literary character, conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Physick. He did not long survive his friend; but lost his life in a storm at sea in December 1792. He was a young man of great goodness of heart, extensive learning, indefa∣tigable industry, and the strictest rectitude of principle.</NOTE>,
who was his intimate friend, and who not
only attended, but almost constantly sat by him
the four last months of his life. By the goodness
of Providence, every thing was procured for him
that the physicians recommended. Twice I went
with him to sea; and the first attempt (an excur∣sion
of ten leagues from Peterhead to Aberdeen)
succeeded so well, that he was anxious to make a
second; which, however, had, as I feared it would
have, disagreeable consequences, though nothing
materially pernicious followed it. In the end of
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
June, a cough made its appearance; and it was
then I began to lose hopes of his recovery, as I
have reason to think he also did: he saw death
approaching, and met it with his usual calmness
and resignation. “How pleasant a medicine is
Christianity!” he said one evening, while he
was expecting the physician, whom he had sent
for, in the belief that he was just going to expire.
Sometimes he would endeavour to reconcile my
mind to the thought of parting with him; but,
for fear of giving me pain, spoke seldom and spar∣ingly
on that subject. His composure he retain∣ed,
as well as the full use of his rational faculties,
to the last; nor did his wit and humour forsake
him, till he was no longer able to smile, or even
to speak except in a whisper. His last allusion to
literature, and probably the last time his favour∣ite
Virgil occurred to his mind, was on occasion of
some difference of opinion happening when he was
present, between Mr Wilson and me, about the
meaning of a Greek word. To give him a little
amusement, I referred the matter to him. AH!
said he with a smile, (finding himself unable to say
more) FUIMUS TROES.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="45"/>
ONE day, long before the little incident last
mentioned, when I was sitting by him, soon after
our second return from sea, he began to speak in
very affectionate terms, as he often did, of what
he called my goodness to him. I begged him to
drop that subject; and was proceeding to tell him
that I had never done any thing for him but what
duty required and inclination prompted; and that
for the little I had done his filial piety and other
virtues were to me more than a sufficient recom∣pence,—when
he interrupted me (which he was
not apt to do) and, starting up, with inexpressible
fervour and solemnity, implored the blessing of
God upon me. His look at that moment, though
I shall never forget it, I can describe in no other
way than by saying, that it seemed to have in it
something more than human, and what I may,
not very improperly perhaps, call angelic. Seeing
me agitated, he expressed concern for what he had
done, and said that, whatever might be in his
mind, he would not any more put my feelings to
so severe a trial. Sometimes, however, warm sen∣timents
of gratitude would break from him: and
those were the only occasions on which, during the
whole course of his illness, he was observed to shed
tears;—till the day before his death; when he de∣sired
<PB N="47" REF="46"/>
to see his brother, gave him his blessing, wept
over him, and bid him farewell.</P>
<P>As his life drew towards a close, his pains aba∣ted
considerably, and he passed a good deal of time
in sleep. When I asked him, whether his dreams
were distressing, he said, “No; for that he some∣times
dreamed of walking with me; which was
an idea peculiarly soothing to his mind.”</P>
<P>AT seven in the morning of the nineteenth of
November 1790, he said his throat was dry, and
desired a draught to be given him. Mr Wilson
stept to the table to fetch it; but, before he got
back to the bedside, the last breath was emitted,
without a groan or even a sigh.</P>
<P>OVER his grave, in the churchyard of St. Nico∣las
in Aberdeen, is erected a piece of marble, for
which I composed the following inscription:</P>

<P>OF his character and opinions I shall subjoin
some further particulars, which could not be con∣veniently
introduced in the preceding narrative.
<PB N="94" REF="48"/>
I set them down as they occur, without attempt∣ing
arrangement.</P>
<P>PIETY and meekness were striking features in
his character, habitual to him in infancy, and
through life. I find among his papers forms of
devotion, composed for his own use; of which I
may perhaps give a specimen. The Christian Re∣ligion
and its evidences he had studied with in∣defatigable
application; and the consequence was
such, as may be always expected in like cases,
where the inquirer has candour and sense: no per∣son
could love his religion more than he did, or
believe in it with fuller assurance of faith. But
in his behaviour there was no austerity or singu∣larity.
Even when he came to be a man, he had,
when in health, and in the company of his inti∣mate
friends, all the playfulness of a boy. The
effect of religion upon his mind was, to make him
chearful, considerate, benevolent, intrepid, hum∣ble,
and happy. Of the contracted principles and
unamiable prejudices of sectaries he had no con∣ception.
He loved all the human race; he bore
a particular love to all Christians; and he wished
all parties to exercise Christian charity towards
each other. The church of England he held in
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
high veneration, and was also attached to the
church of Scotland in which he had been educat∣ed;
he knew that, in respect of doctrine, the prin∣ciples
of both are the same; and, as to the differ∣ent
forms of ecclesiastical discipline and worship,
he did not think he had any right to affect singu∣larity,
or to molest the peace of either church by
clamouring about matters of no essential import∣ance.
He wished to be, and to be considered as,
a CHRISTIAN: a title, which he thought infinite∣ly
more honourable than any other. The words
Lutheran and Calvinist he well understood, but
set no value on them; though he was ever ready
to own his obligations to those learned men who
had been instrumental in bringing about the re∣formation
from popery.</P>
<P>OF modern divines his greatest favourite was
Dr Clarke. He studied all that author's works
with his usual accuracy, and with much delight.
Even the controversy with Dodwell he studied;
for he thought it strictly connected with what
Baxter and others had taught concerning the in∣corporeal
nature of the soul: a doctrine, of which
he was a zealous defender; which he had examin∣ed
as far, I believe, as human ingenuity can ex∣amine
<PB N="51" REF="50"/>
it; and on which he has left a great deal
in writing, though nothing finished. I need not
add, for after what has been said it will be natu∣rally
supposed, that he was a warm admirer of
Dr Campbell's excellent writings, and very judi∣cious
Translation of the Gospels.</P>
<P>I SPOKE of his playfulness. In conversation
with his particular friends he would display an a∣mazing
exuberance of pleasantry and humour.
His knowledge of nature and extensive learning,
supplied him with innumerable images; and his
lively fancy, aided by simplicity of diction and a
ready eloquence, enabled him to combine them in∣to
the most diverting forms that could be imagined.
He had, what perhaps all people of observation
have, a slight tendency to satire; but it was of the
gentlest kind; he had too much candour and good∣nature
to be either a general satirist or a severe one.
That taunting, gibing, raillery, which some people,
who mistake ill-nature for wit, are so fond of, he
despised and hated: he often, as his duty required,
spoke in order to improve and amend others;
but never uttered a word with a view to give pain.
Characters, however, there were, of which he was
at no pains to conceal what he thought. If per∣sons,
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
notoriously profligate; or who in publick
office seemed to him to have betrayed their trust;
or who, rendered impudent by immorality and
ignorance, ventured to retail the wretched impie∣ties
of infidelity;—if such persons happened to be
spoken of in his hearing, it was easy to perceive,
that his abstaining from general satire was ow∣ing
to the want, not of talents, but of inclina∣tion.</P>
<P>I MENTIONED that acuteness of intellect, which
enabled him to enter with facility into the abstru∣sest
doctrines of the abstract philosophy. He
possessed a talent still more useful, in which men
of acute minds are sometimes deficient; and that
was Good Sense. He could instantly, and almost
intuitively, discern what in human conduct was
right or wrong, prudent or imprudent; not only
in matters of morality and science, but in the ge∣neral
intercourse of the world. Of his superiori∣ty
in this talent I was so sensible, that, during the
last four or five years of his life, I seldom resolved
on any thing that had difficulty in it; without
consulting him; and I never went wrong by fol∣lowing
his advice.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="52"/>
THE delicacy (I may even call it the purity) of
his mind was greater than I have known in any
other man, at least in any other young man; and,
in one so young, was truly admirable, and wor∣thy
of imitation. He was aware of the danger of
admitting indelicate or improper thoughts into
his mind; for he knew that associations of ideas,
disapproved both by reason as incongruous, and
by conscience as immoral, might in a moment be
formed, in consequence of inattention, even when
there was no settled propensity to evil. To give
an example or two of this delicacy, that my mean∣ing
may be understood, (one cannot be very ex∣plicit
on this subject); such a book as that most
contemptible one called <HI>Scotch Presbyterian eloquence
displayed</HI> he would not have looked into on any
account whatever; because he had heard, that pas∣sages
of Scripture are introduced in it, for the pur∣pose
of raising laughter. Silly tales and jokes of
the same nature he would sometimes hear in com∣pany
(they are too often heard from those of whom
better things might be expected); but he always
showed displeasure at hearing, and never repeated
them. And, notwithstanding his love of the ta∣lent
called <HI>Humour,</HI> he would never read <HI>The Tale
of a Tub:</HI> because he had heard me say, that there
<PB N="54" REF="53"/>
are in it gross indecencies; and that, by forming
ludicrous associations of the meanest ideas with
the most awful truths of religion, it could hardly
fail in some degree to disorder and debase the
mind. I did not tell him this, or any thing else,
in a dictatorial manner; nor did I ever forbid
him to read that book. But his attention was con∣tinually
awake, to learn, although from the slight∣est
hint or most trivial circumstance, what might
be useful in purifying his mind, regulating his
conduct, or improving his understanding.</P>
<P>THUS formed, thus enlightened, and thus inured
to consideration, a mind possessed of sensibility can
never be deficient in Taste or Critical Sagacity.
In this respect he was highly accomplished; of
which however it is no proof to say, that at the
age of eighteen he was a better judge of com∣position
than I had been at thirty. It may be
thought, that I would not neglect to explain to
him the principles of good writing, as far as I
knew them; and this part of my duty I did not
neglect: but my diligence in it bore no proportion
to his proficiency; which I impute to his natural
rectitude of understanding, aided by constantly
reading the best authors, and abstaining, as he
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
scrupulously did, from such as fall below, or do not
rise above, mediocrity. They, who may be pleas∣ed
to say, that at this rate he must have kept at a
distance from what I have attempted in writing,
are at liberty to think so. To me, and to every
thing connected with me, he was partial; as I have
acknowledged already: and they who understand
human nature will not think the worse of him,
either as a man, or as a critick, for having had
this infirmity. A dislike of <HI>ambitious ornaments,</HI>
and, what I might almost call, an <HI>abhorrence</HI> of
ostentation, appeared in him very early in life;
and were heightened and confirmed by studying
those antient writers, particularly Homer, Xen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣phon,
Herodotus, Cesar, and others, who are dis∣tinguished
by a severe and majestick simplicity of
style.</P>
<P>WHEN he began to learn the French language,
of which, under an experienced teacher, he acquir∣ed
very exactly the elements and pronunciation,
I, remembering with what delight I had in my
youth read <HI>Telemaque,</HI> recommended that work to
his perusal, and told him he would be highly en∣tertained
with it. In this, however, I was mistak∣en.
After going through one half, he begged I
<PB N="56" REF="55"/>
would not insist on his reading the other, at least
at present. “I acknowledge, said he, the author's
merit as a politician and moralist, and I believe
he writes the French tongue in its utmost puri∣ty;
but I have been studying Homer's Odys∣sey,
the simplicity of which delights me; and
with this impression on my mind I cannot just
now relish the flowery descriptions of Fenelon.”
He mentioned other objections, which I need not
repeat. I said, he might lay Telemaque aside,
till he found himself disposed to resume it, and in
the mean time return to his Homer; for whose
simplicity and grandeur I was much pleased to
find that he had a true taste. He was about fif∣teen
when this little conference passed. It may
give modish readers a mean opinion of his judge∣ment:
on those who have conversed, as he had,
with ancient authors, it may perhaps have a con∣trary
effect.</P>
<P>TIME was not allowed him for going deep into
the literature of France: his favourite authors of
that nation were Moliere and Boileau. Of Rous∣seau
he knew little; and such was his opinion of
Voltaire's principles and character, that he had no
curiosity to inquire after his books. Of the French
<PB N="57" REF="56"/>
tongue he seemed to think, that its want of har∣mony,
and being almost entirely made up of idi∣omatick
phrases, rendered it unfit for the higher
poetry, and for elevated composition in general;
but he did not think himself sufficiently skilled in
it to pretend to judge of its merit. Italian, which
he would probably have found more to his mind,
he meant to study, but did not live to do it.</P>
<P>HE was a master in Greek and Latin: and in
getting those languages was much aided by his
skill in the Grammatical art; without which it is
indeed impossible (though projectors have thought
otherwise) to learn them with accuracy; and, if
they are not accurately learned, the acquisition is
not of great value. I find, by his papers, that he
had exercised himself a little in Greek composi∣tion;
which I believe is not often done in Scot∣land.
Latin he spoke correctly and readily. In
that language he and I sometimes conversed when
we were by ourselves; and he soon became my
superiour in this as in every other talent. Most
of the things I have published of late years were
submitted in manuscript to his revisal, and receiv∣ed
from him valuable emendations. What he
proposed in this way I never saw reason to reject.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="57"/>
IN a pocket-book of his, I find hints and me∣morandums,
some in Latin, some in English,
which do honour to his character:—pious purpo∣ses,
—resolutions respecting his behaviour in so∣ciety;
—and titles, and plans, of intended disser∣tations
on various subjects. Among these is “A
discourse on the Lord's prayer, considered as an
evidence of the truth of Christianity.” It could
not, he said, be contrived either by an impostor,
or by the disciples of an impostor. I have heard
him talk on the subject, and was so well pleased
with his reasoning, that though, in consideration
of his health, I wished him to write little and sel∣dom,
I even advised him to prosecute that argu∣ment;
which, however, his last illness prevented.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, which the pocket-book in∣forms
me he had resolved to <HI>think of,</HI> was “An
essay on the writings and genius of Aristotle.”
Of this great ancient he was a warm but a ration∣al
admirer. He had studied his best works, par∣ticularly
his Ethicks, Poeticks and Politicks: and,
while he regretted his entangling himself so much
in the trammels of a technical and unprofitable
logick, owned that he found in him remarks and
suggestions so uncommon and so judicious, as to
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
merit the attention of every philosopher and
scholar.</P>
<P>OF some others of his projected dissertations I
shall just mention the titles, as I find them in the
pocket-book: which will show at least, that he
had an active mind, and was anxious to do good.
The words marked with inverted commas are his
own words.</P>
<P>“ESSAYS on various parts of the evidence of
Christianity.”</P>
<P>“A history of infidelity; with an examination
of the lives and characters of infidel writers,
and extracts from their works.”</P>
<P>“Essay on the unreasonableness of infidelity:
considering, 1. the doctrine which an infidel
rejects and disobeys; 2. the arguments he re∣sists,
and his reasons for resisting them; 3. the
hopes which he abandons, and what he receives
in their stead:—with an exhortation to the stu∣dy
and open profession, obedience, and defence
of Christianity.”</P>
<P>“Think of an account of the most celebrated
English poets, either in a set of imitations of
their style, or otherwise.”</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="59"/>
“Essay on antient prodiges and miracles.”</P>
<P>“Nature of the Jewish Theocracy—its reasons
—effects—continuance.”</P>
<P>“Remarks on the causes and cure of a disor∣dered
imagination. Advice to persons troub∣led
with melancholy.”</P>
<P>“On the pernicious effects of novel-reading,
even where the novel is not profligate.”</P>
<P>“Think of a Latin <HI>dialogue of the dead</HI> between
Cicero and Livy, on the character and actions
of Julius Cesar.”—Of this I find a fragment,
in which the different styles of the two authors
are wonderfully well imitated; but the fragment
is short, not quite two quarto pages.</P>
<P>Yarico's complaint on being abandoned by In∣kle.
—Four pages of this poem (which is in the
epistolary form) have been found; but both the
beginning and the end are lost; and the hand∣writing
shows the manuscript to be a first draught
and uncorrected. The fragment, however, con∣tains
some animated strictures on the policy that
has for its foundation the <HI>slavery of the negroes;</HI>
a subject which filled him with the utmost indig∣nation
and horror.</P>
<P>“Essay on the nature, criterion, and number
of Philosophical first principles.—Resolution of
<PB N="61" REF="60"/>
mathematical axioms into identical proposi∣tions.”</P>
<P>“Thoughts on the irrationality occasioned by
sleep and delirium; with an attempt to ac∣count
for it.”</P>
<P>“Essay on <HI>receiving the kingdom of heaven as a
little child.</HI> Dispositions requisite to the recep∣tion
of the gospel. Why we must not expect
its evidence to appear in its full force at first.”</P>
<P>“Essay to prove, that the weak judgement of
some primitive christians neither could be the
effect of their religion, nor could render them
partial or incompetent judges of its evidence.”
He had read the writings of some of the primi∣tive
fathers.</P>
<P>“Essay on persons who walk in their sleep.”
He had formed a curious and plausible theory on
this subject: but I cannot implicitly trust my
memory in a case of this kind; and I do not find
materials sufficient to enable me to give his senti∣ments
on his own authority.</P>
<P>“Essay on the use of the Latin subjunctive
mood.” I find a very copious collection of ex∣amples
on which he meant to establish a theory:
of the theory itself there are no traces in his pa∣pers
<PB N="62" REF="61"/>
Several years ago I have heard him talk
very ingeniously on this point; but cannot now
pretend to do justice to his opinion. I only re∣member,
that I thought his general principle more
simple, and more comprehensive, than that of any
other grammarian I had heard of.</P>
<P>“Essay on the reason, why philosophy is said
rather to show our ignorance, than to augment
our knowledge. This accusation is occasioned
by not attending to the nature of philosophy;
and by supposing, that it should open the se∣cret
causes of things, when it can only compare
and generalize facts.”</P>
<P>“Essay on disputatiousness in conversation;
—conducted by misunderstanding or misapply∣ing
the arguments of one's antagonist; by per∣verse
analogies; by converting particular af∣firmations
into general principles; by attack∣ing
a general principle from a particular ex∣ception.
—Danger of maintaining false princi∣ples,
though apparently trifling; from the con∣sequences
they may imply; from the mode of
reasoning they may authorise; from the obsti∣nate
habit of disputation, vanity, and bad temper,
which they promote. Extensive knowledge of
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
the subject in hand, of logick, and of philoso∣phy
in general, often necessary to qualify one
for deciding a question which all pretend to
dispute about.”—Among his Latin memoran∣dums,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Of these I subjoin a specimen.</P>
<P>ECCLESIA bis Die Dominico adeunda semper, nisi valetudinis

<PB N="64" REF="63"/>
a disputatious humour in conversation. I know
no person, to whom it was less necessary to form
such a resolution. Dispute he hated and care∣fully
avoided. He knew how it tends to con∣tract
and pervert the understanding, deprave the
taste, sour the temper, extinguish the love of truth
and of delicacy, waste precious time, and render
the heart insensible to the pleasures of rational
converse.</P>
<P>IN the memorandum book are many other
hints of inquiry, on various topicks of history,
<PB N="65" REF="64"/>
mathematicks, botany, chemistry, magnetism,
musick, electricity, medicine, &amp;c: with remarks
on passages of Scripture, and of Cicero, Livy, Ari∣stotle,
Quintilian, and other authors. Of these
I may perhaps be better qualified, than at pre∣sent,
to give an account, when I shall have found
leisure to arrange his prose writings.</P>
<P>FROM the Greek drama he expected much en∣tertainment,
but was disappointed. In Sophocles
he found beautiful passages, a pleasing simplicity,
and moral sentences well expressed; but little in∣cident,
not much contrivance, and no very nice
discrimination of characters. He agreed with
me in opinion, that antient tragedy must have de∣rived
its charm rather from the magnificence of
the scene, than from the genius of the poet; or,
at least, that there must have been, in the exhibi∣tion,
some attractive circumstances, whereof we
know little or nothing, and are therefore not qua∣lified
to judge. He thought, that in any one of
Shakespear's best plays, in Othello, for example, or
Lear, there was more strength and variety of in∣vention,
and more knowledge of human nature,
than in any Dramatick author of antiquity. Of
our wonderful dramatist he was a great admirer:
<PB N="66" REF="65"/>
the favourite plays were, I think, Lear, Othello,
Macbeth, Henry IV, and the Merry Wives of
Windsor.</P>
<P>BY some people, more prompt to speak and
prone to censure, than acute to observe, his cha∣racter
was mistaken. They imputed his modesty
to timourousness; and thought, or said at least,
that I kept him secluded from society, obliged
him to apply too much to books, and gave him
no opportunities of knowing the world. In jus∣tice
both to him and to myself, I must enter into
some particulars on this subject.</P>
<P>WHEN at home, indeed, he was not frequently
seen in the street; a laudable regard to health,
and a passionate love of rural scenery, leading him
to daily excursions in the fields: it is also true,
that of tea-tables he was no regular frequenter;
and that at card-tables and in ball-rooms, (things
of no small importance in a country town) he
never appeared at all. By the intelligent reader,
after what he has heard of him, it will not be
supposed, that this was the effect of restraint on
my part: on the contrary, it would have been
unreasonable and cruel restraint, if in these things
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
I had not readily complied, as I constantly did,
with his inclination.</P>
<P>BUT I doubt, whether any other young man
in North Britain, of his years and station, had
better opportunities than he, of seeing what is
called the world; and a more accurate, or more
sagacious, observer of it, I have not known. He
never was in a foreign country; but in England
and Scotland his acquaintance was nearly as ex∣tensive
as mine; and to many persons, in both
countries, of great distinction in rank and litera∣ture,
he had the honour to be known, and to be
indebted for particular civilities. To give a list
of names might be thought to savour of vanity
rather than gratitude; yet it is not improba∣ble
that gratitude may one day induce me to give
such a list.—Of the principles on which I con∣ducted
his education, and of his own opinion of
those principles, I leave the candid reader to judge
from the preceding narrative.</P>
<P>IN infancy, his health was very delicate, and
he was somewhat timourous; not more so, how∣ever,
than well-natured children, who fear to of∣fend,
commonly are. But his piety and good.
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
sense, the manly exercises in which he delighted,
and his being so early accustomed to the use of
arms, got the better of that timidity; so that, be∣fore
he grew up to manhood, he was as fearless
as a man ought to be. I know not any one, in
whose fortitude I could have confided more, on
any perilous emergency. Several times I have
seen him in danger; once particularly in Yar∣mouth
roads, when every person on board our
vessel, every person at least who was on the up∣per
deck, imagined it was on the point of found∣ering.
I took him by the hand, made him swal∣low
a glass of wine; and, on looking at him, saw
his countenance perfectly undismayed, and I be∣lieve
more composed than any other in the ship.
He was then in his sixteenth year.</P>
<P>IT was also supposed by some, as he was often
seen walking alone, or with me, and seldom or
never with more than one companion, that he
must be of an unsocial disposition. The reverse
was his character; he was social, chearful, and
affectionate, and by those friends who thorough∣ly
knew him beloved even to enthusiasm. In his
choice of friends, indeed, he was not hasty. For
in discerning characters he was, as already obser∣ved,
<PB N="69" REF="68"/>
singularly perspicacious; and the slightest
appearance of immorality, vanity, pedantry, coarse
manners, or blameable levity, disgusted him;
though he showed his disgust by silence only, or
withdrawing from the company.</P>
<P>HE had a passion for visiting places that had
been remarkable as the abodes of eminent men,
or that retained any memorials of them; and, as
in this I resembled him, we often walked together
on what he called classick ground. Westminster
abbey, in the neighbourhood of which we lived
several months, was a favourite haunt of his, and
suggested many images and meditations. He had
wandered in the bowers of Twickenham, and a∣midst
the more majestick scenes of Blenheim and
Windsor. At Oxford, where we passed some time,
he met with many interesting objects and atten∣tive
friends. He kissed (literally he did so) the
grave-stone which covers the dust of Shaekspear
at Stratford; and sat in the same chimney-cor∣ner,
and in the same chair, in which tradition tells
that the immortal bard was wont to sit. He once
or twice visited the village, the house, and even
the chamber (near Coltsworth in Lincolnshire) in
which Sir Isaac Newton is said to have been born.
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
The last time he and I were in Cambridge, I gra∣tified
him with a sight of those apartments in
Pembroke hall, which were once honoured with
the residence of my memorable and long-lament∣ed
friend Mr Gray; of whom he was a warm ad∣mirer,
thinking him the greatest poetical genius
that Britain had produced since Milton. He com∣posed
an ode inscribed “To the genius of Gray,”
of which I find among his papers a few stanzas;
but far the greater part is irrecoverably lost. This
ode I think he wrote, or planned, while we were
passing some time in 1787 at Windsor; where,
from the terrace, he had a view of Stoke church,
in which Gray is buried, and towards which I
often found him directing his eyes.</P>
<P>WHEN his curiosity was raised with respect to
any work of art, he always wished to make him∣self
master of at least the theory of it. In his ear∣ly
days he was skilled in various sorts of legerde∣main;
but left it off entirely, as trifling in itself,
and ostentatious in the performance. One even∣ing
of his thirteenth year, he and I arrived in
Newark on Trent, just as an exhibition of fire∣works
was beginning in the market place. It
was indeed a magnificent spectacle, and the first
<PB N="71" REF="70"/>
of the kind he had seen. He immediately resolv∣ed
to study fireworks; and, finding in London a
systematick book on the subject, applied to it so
successfully, that, for several years after, he would
now and then exhibit in that way, for the amuse∣ment
of his friends.</P>
<P>AMONG his Latin memorandums, there is a re∣solution
“never to engage in games of chance.”
Cards he detested; as destructive of time at least,
if not of money: which in him I thought the
more remarkable, as he had, when a boy, learned
(I know not how) to play at what is called <HI>quadrille,</HI>
and some other games. In those days he often
urged me to play at cards, saying, he was sure it
would amuse me. I told him, I had several times
attempted quadrille; but that, of the directions gi∣ven me,
some I could never understand, and some I
could never remember. He begged leave to write
a few directions: and I gave him leave; being
curious to know, how a lad of eleven years of age
would acquit himself in respect of style, and the
arrangement of his matter. He brought me two
treatises, (still extant) one of quadrille, the other
of back-gammon, written with a propriety, perspi∣cuity,
and correctness, that very agreeably sur∣prised
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
me. I could not help telling him, as was
true, that I understood them much better than
any oral information I had ever received on those
subjects.</P>
<P>THERE is another fashionable recreation, to which
he could not reconcile his mind, the reading of
romances. The time employed in that way he
held to be lost. Don Quixote, however, Robinson
Crusoe, and Cecilia, he read with pleasure, and be∣gan,
but could not get through, Gil Blas. Hear∣ing
that an acquaintance of his had almost had
his brain turned with <HI>The Adventures of Roderick
Random,</HI> he had the curiosity to ask for that book,
but quickly laid it aside, and would never after∣wards
resume it. To amuse some hours of lan∣gour,
in the commencement of his last illness, I
advised him to look into Fielding; and he read
Tom Jones, and, I think, Amelia. He gave that
author no little praise for his humour, for the ve∣ry
skilful management of his fable, the variety
and contrast of his characters, and, with a few ex∣ceptions,
for the beautiful simplicity of his style:
but still—the time spent in reading it was lost;
and there was more danger from the indelicacy
of particular passages, than hope of its doing good
<PB N="73" REF="72"/>
by the satire, the moral sentiments, or the distri∣butive
justice dispensed in winding up the catas∣trophe.</P>
<P>I wish I could have given specimens of his ta∣lent
in writing letters: but it happens, that most
of those I have of his contain circumstances of
private business,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The two following are not of this sort, and may therefore be sub∣joined.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO DR B. AT G. CASTLE.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Peterhead, <DATE>11th October 1787.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR letter, which I received this morning, gives me great joy,
as it informs me, that you have good health, agreeable company,
and pleasant weather. If I except one or two tolerable days, we have
had, ever since you left this place, almost continual easterly winds,
with a due proportion of rain, and <HI>quant. suff.</HI> of Peterhead fog:
and I have been troubled with a slight degree of sore throat, which,
though not otherwise very inconvenient, made me abstain for some
time from drinking the mineral water. The pain in my throat,
however, is now gone, and in other respects I am as well as usual.
You wish to know what I have been doing.—I have, then, con∣versed
with Dr L—about natural philosophy, and his patients,
and his organ; with Mr W—about Greenland, and navigation,
and whales &amp;c.; with Mrs A—about Mrs M—and Bishop
Butler: I have played at back-gammon with Father S—, and
have deplored with his Son the present state of partridges, and the
useless severity of the game-act. Moreover, I have amused my∣self
with walking and shooting, as far as the weather and the laws
would permit; and have rode on horseback to <HI>Bullers Buchan,</HI>
which, though indeed terribly magnificent, hardly came up to the
expectations I had formed of it. My steed is not descended from
Pyroeis or Ethon, but is a very good fort of animal, and one of
the best possible for my purpose, not having sense enough to start,
or strength enough to run away: and it would be very wicked if
I were to find fault with him, as his master let the cart lie idle in
order to accommodate me.—Thus I have given you a full and true
account of all my proceedings; speaking nonsense, for the usual
reason, because I have nothing else to say.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for the verses, which I have read again
and again with great satisfaction. I admire the versification and
turn of the language; especially in that line “Beaming with
the benignity of heaven.” The poem has (what very few com∣plimental
poems have) truth, and a good moral, with beautiful
and pertinent description. I am, &amp;c. Your J. H. B.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To DR B—EDINBURGH.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Peterhead, <DATE>27th April 1789.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>I WRITE this letter, because I promised it; although I doubt
whether it will arrive in Edinburgh before you set out on your re∣turn
homeward. I have little news to send you, except what
you may have heard already, that *; and what you will not
care much whether you hear or no, that *. I may tell
you further, that Dr L's thanksgiving sermon, for His Majesty's
happy recovery, has been much applauded;—it was apposite, ani∣mated,
and loyal.</P>
<P>I HAVE not yet begun to drink the water, but I believe I ought
to have begun; and I think I shall in a day or two. I walk out
frequently; and have been twice at the river, which is in tolera∣bly
good condition for angling. And I have read the <HI>Trial of the
witnesses of the resurrection,</HI> &amp;c. (my chief objection to which is,
that I wish there had been a little more of it;) and some of
Clarke's Sermons, whose character and doctrines I admire the
more the better I grow acquainted with them. So much for news
of my noble self.</P>
<P>I THINK we were talking lately about that sentence—“all ac∣tion
implies motion: but there may be motion where there
is no action;” and you intended, I believe, to change the last
clause to—“there may be motion in that which is no agent.”
—I have still some difficulties about the former clause. That all
action implies motion is indeed indisputable, if <HI>motion</HI> be used for
<HI>change of state;</HI> but I doubt whether it be indisputable if <HI>motion</HI>
be understood to signify <HI>change of place.</HI></P>
<P>THAT every action of spirit upon matter implies motion, one
may venture to affirm. But my doubt regards the reflex opera∣tions
of spirit; as our recollection, for example, or invention;
concerning which, if we have no proof that the mind in order to
their performance must change the place of any corporeal organs;
and no proof that the mind itself could not be as able to perform
them in one place as in another; I think it is not clear that they
imply change of place, although they certainly are actions.—Not
to speak of the agency of Him, who being every where perpetual∣ly
present, cannot be supposed to move from one point of space to
another.</P>
<P>IF you think this of any consequence, a short note, or slight
change of expression, will remove the difficulty; if otherwise, you
must impute my remarks to the present want of news; and
consider them as stuffed into my letter, like saw-dust or brown
paper into a travelling trunk, merely to fill up an empty corner,
and not for any value of their own.</P>
<P>I HOPE to see you soon, and to hear from you as often as you
can conveniently write. Compliments to—and Montagu,
whom I congratulate on his great journey, and all his new ex∣perience
of the world. I hope he will not leave his declensions
and conjugations behind him at Edinburgh.—Ever Your J. H. B.</P>
</LETTER></NOTE> which ought not to be made

publick. His epistolary style was correct, easy,
and simple, and, like his conversation, seasoned
with that unaffected and playful humour in
which he so greately excelled.</P>

<BIBL>VIRG. V. 487.</BIBL>
<P>But some may think, enough has been said;
though there are a few, who know that the sub∣ject
is by no means exhausted.</P>
<P>ABOUT the disposal of his papers he gave no
directions: being, I suppose, prevented, either by
<PB N="76" REF="75"/>
his thinking them unworthy of notice, or by his
unwillingness to pain me by speaking of his dis∣solution.
Nothing else could have prevented him:
<PB N="77" REF="76"/>
for he and I always lived on terms of the most
unreserved and familiar intimacy.</P>
<P>ONE day, after all hope of recovery was gone,
he called for a particular parcel of his papers,
and, putting them in the hand of a Friend who
was sitting by him, desired that they might be
burned. His Friend dissuaded it; but he repeat∣ed
the request, and said they contained nothing
of any value. There is reason to think, that he
did not then distinctly remember what papers
were in that parcel (which he had made up be∣fore
he had any apprehension of danger, and had
not seen for many months); and that on this oc∣casion
some things might have been destroyed,
which perhaps he wished to be preserved. I can∣not
<PB N="78" REF="77"/>
otherwise account for the mutilated state in
which I find some of his best pieces.</P>
<P>I HAVE lost the pleasantest, and, for the last four
or five years of his short life, one of the most in∣structive,
companions, that ever man was delight∣ed
with. But—THE LORD GAVE; THE LORD
HATH TAKEN AWAY: BLESSED BE THE NAME
OF THE LORD.—I adore the Author of all good,
who gave him grace to lead such a life, and die
such a death, as makes it impossible for a Chris∣tain
to doubt of his having entered upon the in∣heritance
of a happy immortality.</P>

<HEAD>FRAGMENTS
OF A
POEM
ON THE
EXCELLENCE OF CHRISTIANITY.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>VIRTUE does not consist in the repression of hope and desire, or in surly abstinence from pleasure and insensibility to pain: it does, on the contrary, afford the only suitable gratification to de∣sire, and confidence to hope; and produces the only pure and la∣sting enjoyment.—These happy ends will be attained, if our hopes and desires are fixed upon the improvement of the soul, and ex∣tended to the interests of eternity.</P>
<P>THE Christian Religion alone affords the means of this hap∣piness: for it alone teaches how we may improve the best facul∣ties of the soul; and it can alone compose and gratify our hopes and desires, by assuring us of future felicity, and by removing that uncertainty and fear which the thought of eternal duration must raise in every mind unsupported by the comforts of the Gospel, and sensible of its own guilt and infirmity.</P>
<P>THOUGH no future life were to be expected, happiness, even upon earth, could not be obtained, except from the mind. So that even a desire of present happiness should make us obey the precepts of Christianity; as directly tending to improve and harmonize the soul, and to procure for us in this life all the feli∣city whereof in this life our nature is capable.</P>
<P>THESE particulars I would attempt to explain, partly by argu∣ment, and partly by examples. I do not wish to follow that strict arrangement, which might be necessary in a philosophical dis∣course; but rather to dispose the subject in such a manner as may be most suitable to the natural course of human thought, may relieve the mind by variety in the style, and may afford the best opportunities for poetical illustration.</P></NOTE>.</HEAD>

<HEAD>VULTEIUS EQUES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope's Sir Balaam and Horace's Vulteius Mena are different characters. The Translator put Vulteius for Balaam for no o∣ther reason (I believe) but because he thought the former might be more manageable in hexameter verse. The dactyls of the first line, followed by a Spondaick, give to the first couplet of the trans∣lation a peculiar contrast and vivacity. The Translator humour∣ously supposes the monument of London to threaten, both heaven with invasion, and the city by seeming ready to fall on it. It was ac∣tually said to be in some danger of falling at the time when he first saw it.</NOTE>.</HEAD>

<STAGE>ADDISON, JOHNSON.</STAGE>
<P>I AM happy in this opportunity of expressing
my thankfulness for a work, which makes every
friend of learning greatly indebted to you; as it
gives additional strength and perspicuity to the
best language now spoken upon earth.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir: if any thanks are to be bestowed on
this occasion, it is my business to bestow them
Additional strength that cannot receive, which is
not already strong; and more perspicuous that
cannot be rendered, which is not already clear.
The student may inquire, and the dictionary may
retain: but, without the previous efforts of the
author, in smoothing the rugged paths of gram∣matical
<PB N="234" REF="226"/>
matical literature, vain were the researches of the
studious, and vain the industry of the lexicogra∣pher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT mankind have another cause of gratitude
to you. You have endeavoured, and with success,
to instruct them in morality, as well as in criti∣cism.
Your <HI>Rambler</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND how do you like the <HI>Rambler?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM sorry to say the style of it is not such as I
can highly approve: it is more exceptionable than
that of your latter works, your <HI>Lives of the Poets</HI>
in particular. Yet even these have too many of
the <HI>dulcia vitia,</HI> which some old criticks objected
to in Seneca, whom I think you resemble in more
respects than one. But the matter of the <HI>Ram∣bler</HI>
is in general excellent; if it be not in some
places rather too misanthropical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AYE, aye, misanthropical! So of me says every
one who has viewed the tumults of the human
<PB N="235" REF="227"/>
soul only from a distance; who has perceived the
more violent effects of prejudice and passion, with∣out
seeing from what causes they might have ori∣ginated.
You, Sir, passed your time in affluence,
prosperity, and ease; supported by the applause of
literature, and the patronage of greatness; you
were kind to others, for others were kind to you.
My genius bloomed in a desert; and from that
desert it was not drawn, till the winter of life
had repressed its vigour, and tarnished its beauty.
My days were spent in sickness and in sorrow; agi∣tated
by fruitless hope, and chilled by unforeseen
disappointment. That from this severity of ex∣ternal
circumstances I might acquire a severity of
external behaviour, why is it to be wondered? All
men have their infirmities, and I had mine. Yet
these consequences of adversity did not contami∣nate
my heart; which was ever a friend to the
best interests of mankind, and ever true to the
cause of religion and virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM not ignorant, that the manners of every
man are affected by his condition, even as the
fruit of a tree receives a tincture from the soil that
produces it. Nor am I ignorant of your many
<PB N="236" REF="228"/>
virtues, which have secured my esteem and reve∣rence,
and will preserve to you the esteem and re∣verence
of all good men, let petty criticks nibble
at your character as they please. I know too, that,
if there was a little peevishness in your writings
and conversation, it must be attributed to bad for∣tune,
and to no badness of heart: which made me
speak slightly of those passages in the <HI>Rambler</HI>
with which I am dissatisfied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT you threatened to object to my style: did
you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I DID: I think it has too unwieldy and too uni∣form
a dignity. In composition even excellence
itself will tire, if continued without variety. And
your very best performances, from too free an use
of uncommon words, and from a constant endea∣vour
at quaintness, antithesis, and wit, are desti∣tute
of that simplicity, without which there can
be no true elegance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>A VERY delicate observation indeed! and
from one at whose hands I had a right to expect
<PB N="237" REF="229"/>
it! On whom have I lavished the honours of lite∣rary
applause more liberally than on you? Have
I not said, that “whoever wishes to attain an En∣glish
style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant
but not ostentatious, must give his days and his
nights to the volumes of Addison?”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU have indeed bestowed on me greater praise
than I deserve. But I can hardly think your
praises of my style come from the heart, when I
see you so unwilling to practise yourself what you
recommend to others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I am not accustomed to speak but from the
heart; nor will I ever recommend to others what
I myself would not practise. I have laboured my
style with the greatest attention: I have endea∣voured
to make it, as I wish it to be, close with∣out
obtenebration, perspicuous without languor,
and strong without impetuosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND my greatest objection to it is, that you
have laboured it too much; or, at least, that its
<PB N="238" REF="230"/>
elaborateness is too apparent. It savours more of
art than of nature, more of the midnight lamp
than of the pure radiance of noon; and in your
readers either produces inattention to the sense,
while they are occupied in considering the words
by which it is expressed; or makes them doubt
the sincerity of one, who seems less concerned
what he shall say than how he shall say it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOUR remarks are specious, Sir; they are spe∣cious;
but they are specious only. They are the
remarks of a man adapting rectitude to his own
practice, not forming his practice by the rule of
rectitude. And I will now declare, since you have
driven me to it, that though I think your compo∣sition
light and lively, and therefore recommend
it as a model to ordinary writers, I cannot help
observing in it a colloquial imbecillity, to the
standard of which a man of energetick thought
could not, without danger of enervation, subject
himself. A man of genius, Sir, will display the
coruscations, or rather the steady lustre, of that
genius, equally by the manner and by the matter,
equally in his sentiments and in his diction</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="239" REF="231"/>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>TO this I object not: but at the same time
I beg leave to say, that genius may be as much
shown in simple as in pompous writing. Artis est
celare artem. And, if you would hear me with
patience and impartiality I might perhaps con∣vince
you, that it would not have been hurtful
to your compositions, if you had softened their
oratorical rigour with a little of that <HI>colloquial im∣becillity</HI>
which you censure in mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL, well; you shall be heard with patience.
I must allow that you possess a facility of expres∣sion
which is not unpleasant. You have a mind
well furnished with the stores subservient to ele∣gance
and utility; but your thoughts are in en∣ergy
deficient, because you are too little ambi∣tious
of adding ornament to elucidation. You
have in you, Sir, too much of the playful and
pliant companion, and too little of the dignity of
an author.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT I take to be a great compliment. And
perhaps our present contrariety of opinion might
<PB N="240" REF="232"/>
make us mutually desire the conversation of each
other; since you are as willing to object, as I am
to be praised; and since I receive as commenda∣tion
what you speak as censure.—However, you
have allowed me to examine your notions of style,
and I will not defer that topick any longer. You
will doubtless agree with me, that speech was in∣tended
to convey the sentiments of men from one
to another; and that, therefore, its first and most
essential quality is, to be understood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES: I admit that language must be intelligi∣ble;
and that it was fabricated as a vehicle for
human cogitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SINCE, then, we agree in this, you will also al∣low
that of two words having the same signifi∣cation
an author ought to prefer the more intel∣ligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might perhaps agree with you in general up∣on
that point. But are there not words, sullied
<PB N="241" REF="233"/>
by the mouth of the multitude, which from
meanness, or vulgarity, become unsuitable to the
majesty of composition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF a word, conveying an idea with meanness
either inherent in itself or acquired by association,
be compared with another word which conveys
the same idea without meanness, the significations
of those words are in some degree different, and
therefore they are not included in my proposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>PERHAPS you may be right. But are there
not words, whose venerable magnitude gives them
an elegance and a dignity superior to that of the
more diminutive parts of speech? Cant words,
and vulgar words in general, are short. Your
friend Swift will tell you so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES: but he will not tell me, that short words
are always either cant, or vulgar.—I allow, that,
in certain circumstances, even in prose, one word
may be preferable to another for the sound only.
<PB N="242" REF="234"/>
But I can never admit, that sound is more valu∣able
than sense; or believe, that a reader, when
he meets with a word he does not understand,
will think his ignorance compensated by his dis∣covering
that the word in question consists of six
or seven syllables, and ends with—<HI>ation</HI> or—<HI>osi∣ty.</HI>
If it were to be established as a rule, that one
expression should be preferred to another for the
sound merely, without its being considered whe∣ther
common readers could understand it or not;
we might soon expect to see the words <HI>answering</HI>
and <HI>noisy</HI> banished from our language, that their
place might be supplied by the Greek <HI>Poluphlois∣bio</HI>
and <HI>Apameibomenos.</HI> I must therefore maintain,
that one word is to be chosen in preference to
another for the sake of the <HI>sound,</HI> only when the
sense is in both exactly the same, and in both e∣qually
perspicuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND I must, I think, give my assent to your for∣mer
proposition thus limited and explained. But
surely you do not mean to insinuate, that an au∣thor
must use no word which cannot by the vul∣gar
be understood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="243" REF="235"/>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY no means. I know that an author may
have occasion to mention many things that the
common people do not understand, and therefore
have not language to express. But I still think,
that he ought to prefer a word which the vulgar
can understand to one which they cannot, if it
convey the same meaning with equal elegance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see that you adhere to your rule, and will ob∣lige
me to agree with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>DO you then renounce <HI>fragility, stentorophonick,
detruncation,</HI> and other unwieldy favourites, whose
sense may be expressed in plain English with e∣qual
elegance and much greater perspicuity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, Sir, you have a puerile mode of argumen∣tation,
which you must have learned by conver∣sing
with the <HI>rabble</HI> of London in your diurnal
papers: my periodical lucubrations had a loftier
aim. Make me a speech to confirm your doctrine,
<PB N="244" REF="236"/>
and I will confute it; write me a system, and it
shall be overturned; but do not harass me with the
assiduous importunity of question and inference,
as if you were putting interrogatories to a school-boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF my arguments are just, do not reject them
as childish; and remember your promise, that
you would hear me with impartiality and pa∣tience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL: perhaps I may be inclined to allow,
that my diction might have been improved in
intelligibility, by the removal of such words as
those you object to. But where then would have
been the cadence of my periods, the pomp of my
sonorous phraseology, the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU agreed with me, that in style perspicuity
is the first thing to be considered; and that it is
to be embellished by attention to the sound, only
when that can be done without injury to the sense.
But, even with regard to sound,—do you think,
that Virgil would have been accounted an har∣monious
<PB N="245" REF="237"/>
poet, if he had continued through the
whole Eneid that strain of versification, however
elegant and sublime, in which he describes the
storm in his first book; or that Homer would have
been, in your opinion, to be commended, if he
had related the meeting of Penelope and Ulysses,
or the parting of Hector and Andromache, with
the same thundering impetuosity of numbers,
which he employs upon the stone of Sisyphus, or
the horses and chariot of Neptune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO: I allow, that harmony of style is merely
relative, and deserves praise only when it suits the
subject; and that the same strain of eloquence, if
too long continued, induces languor from its want
of diversification, as well as displacency from the
appearance of excessive art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS it your opinion, then, that the pompous uni∣formity
of diction, which we find in the <HI>Rambler,</HI>
can please by its variety; or that it can be adapt∣ed
to each different subject, when it is equally ap∣plied
to all:—to the trifling as well as the mag∣nificent,
to praise and to censure, to argument and
<PB N="246" REF="238"/>
to narrative? Do you not think, that the same ob∣jections
may be made to the structure of your
style, as to the sound; if both ought to possess,
what you have given to neither, variety suited to
the subject? And would not one be apt to ima∣gine,
that an author, who, by the sound and com∣position
of his language, elevates equally sublime
and familiar ideas, might run some risque of fal∣ling
under the imputation of bombast?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, you grow intolerable:—but when were whigs
otherwise! You still forget that you are not now
engaged in disquisition with one of the populace
of London. Yet I would not have you imagine,
that such arguments can affect or change my
mind. No, Sir, if I cease to answer, it is more
from lassitude than from conviction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though Johnson appears to some disadvantage in this Dia∣logue, it is but just to remark, that the Author held in high ve∣neration the genius, virtues, and learning of that great man; with whom he had the honour to be acquainted.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ADDISON.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND yet my arguments are not, in my judge∣ment,
either tedious or inconclusive. But you
<PB N="247" REF="239"/>
promised not to be angry or partial; and I know
you too well to entertain any <HI>serious</HI> doubt of
your sincerity. A little irony now and then is a
good seasoning to conversation. Tell me now,
my good Sir, your real opinion; and let us then
amuse ourselves with some topick more suitable
to the tranquillity of elysium.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHY, Sir, if you will have it, I may possibly
allow, that you are partly in the right. If I had
my style to form anew, I should perhaps make it,
in a greater degree, elegant without constraint,
dignified without ambitious ornament, strong
without rigidity, and harmonious without ela∣boration.</P>

<P>MY friend, let me advise you to be a little more
cautious in forming your opinions, and more
guarded in your expression; at any rate, be not
so eager to deserve the reproach you are bestow∣ing
upon another:—do not, offended by a little
superstition, or disgusted with a little unpoliteness,
attack indiscriminately, a man adorned with so
many excellencies both moral and intellectual.
I am somewhat apprehensive, that you might, on
this occasion, be convicted of misrepresentation,
as well as partiality. Have not many writers, in∣stead
of despising or resenting the chastisements
of Johnson, been at pains even to collect every
fragment of his lash (if I may refer to your own
allusion) and to twist them, interwoven with
flowers, into an ornament for the head of their
master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="250" REF="242"/>
<SPEAKER>F. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>INTO a scourge for his back, I suppose you
mean, good Socrates. Johnson has been compar∣ed
to Acteon, who was worried by his own dogs:
or, if you will have my allegory in the form of
a garland, I must declare myself of opinion, that
those blundering biographers have girt their wreathe
about the neck of their favourite character, in∣stead
of the brows, and so strangled what they
were impatient to adorn.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This was written several years before the publication of M<SUP>r</SUP> Boswell's Life of Johnson, which the Author never saw.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, if I were still relaxed by the imbecillity,
or agitated with the passions, of mortal life, I
might answer your folly with the severity it de∣serves.
Had those biographers been able to in∣jure
my character, they durst not; had they dared,
they were not able. My infirmities I have ever
acknowledged, and with humility and regret I
still acknowledge. My abilities, surely, did not
make me the object of contempt, or my virtues
of abhorrence; either, I hope, I did not over∣rate:
I have endeavoured fairly to estimate, and
<PB N="251" REF="243"/>
candidly to declare my excellencies (if any thing
human may be so called) and my defects. Of
both these, to him who would distinguish him∣self,
or improve others, the knowledge is neces∣sary:
of his defects, that confidence may not
swell into pride; of his excellencies, that the mo∣desty
of distrust may not shrink into the torpor
of timidity. If I was subject to the frailties of
humanity, what does it prove, but that I was a
man? If I recommended, by the subtlety of ar∣gument,
if I supported, by the impudence of ex∣ample,
if I decorated with the splendour of wit,
or enforced by vehemence of declamation, doc∣trines
hostile to religion and to goodness, brand
me with all the infamy that language can express
or malevolence contrive: but if my ability,
such as it was, I exerted in the defence of virtue
and the discomsiture of vice, I apprehend no dan∣ger
from the assiduity and eloquence, either of
you, Sir, or of my biographers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND yet, before I left the upper world, no few∣er
than three volumes had been published con∣cerning
your sentiments and behaviour; which
volumes, as several people of fashion have assured
<PB N="252" REF="244"/>
me, can do little credit to your principles and
candour, in the opinion of the present age or of
posterity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Sir, I have been told, I shall not say by
people of fashion, but I will say by persons of ve∣racity,
that some writers have been very indus∣trious
to record Anecdotes of Johnson; and to
represent as serious and solemn philosophy what
I might have retorted hastily, in the moment of
fretfulness, perhaps under the pressure of disease,
or ironically hinted in the confidence of playful
conversation. This is an age, Sir, of ignorance
and loquacity; all are very willing to talk, and
almost all are very unable to think; and they
who have nothing to say of their own, are glad
to say something that has been said by others.
Thus my sayings have been inquired after with
curiosity, and collected with avidity. The pre∣ference
usually given of obloquy to praise may be
unpleasant, but is not unaccountable: what was
most agreeable to the biographer himself, and
what he knew would be most agreeable to his
readers, he readily observed, was careful to re∣member,
and willingly told; and the harsh fea∣tures
<PB N="253" REF="245"/>
of my character became most remarkable;
not because they were the most numerous; but
because, being somewhat prominent, they were
by the firebrand of malicious inquiry most strong∣ly
illuminated. No man of sense needs be told,
that of the little railleries, which give flavour and
poignancy to familiar conversation, more must be
judged from the manner in which they are deli∣vered,
than from the words: the latter my bio∣graphers
have been studious to record; the for∣mer
they have been no less studious to conceal,
or perhaps they had not skill to exhibit.—But,
let the rabble, both small and great, affix to the
words Samuel Johnson any idea they please; of
such I scorn alike the applause and the disappro∣bation.
I seek the praise of the good, the judi∣cious,
and the learned; and he who has prudence,
crudition, or charity, must be willing to gather
my principles rather from what I have written,
than from the prattle of a gossip; who is more
anxious that a story be entertaining, than that it
be true; whose observation may be erroneous, and
whose narrative may of course be imperfect.
From the sentiments of posterity I have little ap∣phrehension.
I trust my writings will be read and
<PB N="254" REF="246"/>
esteemed, when those of <HI>some</HI> of my biographers
(I do not say <HI>all</HI>) shall no where be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. G.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT man must have very little confidence in
his own character, who is unwilling that it should
be examined and recorded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JOHNSON.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I hope I have no reason to be diffident of
of my character; although I may have good rea∣son
to distrust some of those who have under∣taken
to describe and analyse it: a person of inte∣grity
and innocence submits reluctantly his cause
to the care of an ignorant pettifogger, and the
verdict of a temerarious jury. That man will
not write paltry tales, who can write any thing
better; and he who can write nothing better will
write nothing good. Anecdote is but a small
part of the materials from which the careful his∣torian
collects a character: he who is able to rear
the edifice will not employ himself in compound∣ing
the mortar. * * * * *</P>

<P>COME hither, Socrates; I wish to introduce
you to a modern British Philosopher.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>ALTHOUGH I never made great pretensions to
philosophy myself, I have always reckoned the
acquaintance of true philosophers a most valuable
acquisition; and left the world without regret,
<PB N="256" REF="248"/>
in the hope of enjoying in these regions the com∣pany
and conversation of the wise men of anti∣quity.
Where is the person, pray, with whom
you mean to make me acquainted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>LOOK towards the Styx. Do you see a tall fat
man, very splendidly drest, coming this way,
with a little hat under his arm? He is the philo∣sopher.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT from his dress I should hardly have
concluded. But I do not blame him for comply∣ing
with the fashion of his age and country, as
far as might be requisite to prevent the appear∣ance
of singularity. No: I shall love and esteem
him as a philosopher, that is, as a friend to truth
and virtue: the shape of his coat, or the twist of
his periwig, do not affect my opinion. And of
what science has he extended the boundaries?
With what new discovery has he enriched man∣kind?
Or has he been successful in illustrating
the doctrines of morality established by others?
His countrymen, I am told, have of late made
considerable advances in the knowledge of, what
<PB N="257" REF="249"/>
was little known in my time, the properties of
matter, and the laws of astronomy: has he em∣ployed
himself in that way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not that he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>HE may, no doubt, have enquired into the na∣ture
of the human mind; strengthened by new
arguments the cause of virtue; or established on
a firmer foundation the liberties of his country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid he has not enlarged the philosophy
of the human mind by new observations, or by
the advancement of truth; nay I doubt whether
he believed that there is such a thing as mind in
the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>A geometrician perhaps?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE not heard him spoken of as such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="258" REF="250"/>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>MANY sciences may have been brought to per∣fection
since I left my native planet, and much
wonderful discovery has actually been made.
Pray tell me, good Mercury, in what respect he
has extended knowledge, or confirmed belief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>TRULY, I am at a loss to say, in what he has
confirmed belief;—unless you call a confirma∣tion
of belief his endeavours to make man∣kind
doubt of every thing; of the existence of
Cod, of spirit, of matter, and even of them∣selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO—I find the gentleman is only a sceptick.
That is a character, with which the world was not
unacquainted in my days. But I wonder that the
Britons, who have rid their country of a far less
pernicious animal the wolf, would suffer a scep∣tick
to burrow among them. And do you call
such a person a philosopher, Mercury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="259" REF="251"/>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ONLY call him what he has been called by
others. You have had occasion to prescribe, be∣fore
now, for scepticism: and I should think it a
favour, if you would purge this poor soul of a
part at least of the corruption he has brought up∣on
himself. He might perhaps think it a favour
too; for if he be not purified in that way, he
must in another less agreeable.—But he is almost
come up to us. Now, my good old Grecian, arm
yourself with all your philosophy, set in order
your arguments, prepare your illustrations, sharp∣en
your logical weapons; call forth the pleasant∣ry
of your wit, the fire of your imagination, the
impetuosity of your eloquence, the keenness of
your—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOFTLY, softly, my friend. You know I was
never distinguished as a declaimer: I have al∣ways
thought it sufficient to convince a man,
without either deafening or frightening him. I
would rather allure than compel; for there is in
human nature a strong propensity to resist vio∣lence,
<PB N="260" REF="252"/>
and not a less strong one to yield to gentle
persuasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>SHALL I then introduce him to you as the re∣nowned
Socrates, the champion of virtue, come,
not to force, but to sooth him into the truth?
Do you think that an obstinate mind, which will
not yield to a greater power, may be subdued by
a less?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>MENTION neither my name nor my character.
I would rather on this, as on former occasions,
appear a plain man than a philosopher, and seem
more to favour scepticism than to oppose it: for
so he will hear me without apprehension or uneasi∣ness;
and I may give my opinion of some of his
tenets, without being suspected of any design ei∣ther
to confute or to ridicule them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL: you shall be obeyed. But he is here.
—Great and learned Sir, I beg leave to introduce
to you this friend of mine, a plain man, who pre∣tends
not to philosophy or literature, but has
with some attention read your Essays.—Friend
<PB N="261" REF="253"/>
<STAGE>[turning to Socrates]</STAGE> this is the extraordinary per∣son,
whom you have so often expressed a desire to
see: this is the philosopher, whose writings are
so much admired in Europe, Asia, Africa and A∣merica;
whom many read, few understand, and
all are convinced by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM happy in being presented to so great a
person. That many read his writings, and that
few understand them, I can readily suppose: but
give me leave to doubt, whether by them any one
was ever convinced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MODERN PHILOSOPHER.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath, Sir;—nobody convinced by my philo∣sophical
writings!—What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>FAR be it from me, Sir, to say that. God for∣bid—no,
I am wrong, I ask <HI>your</HI> pardon, Sir.—Chance
forbid—pshaw! I am wrong again. Ne∣cessity
forbid—or Nothing forbid, that I should
affirm any thing, or nothing, so positively. I on∣ly
said, that I <HI>doubted</HI> whether any body was ever
convinced by them. And let me tell you, Sir,
<PB N="262" REF="254"/>
that you are a particular sort of a gentleman, and
that your principles agree very ill with your prac∣tice,
if you do not very much doubt the same
thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>O SIR, I thought you wished me to talk in the
language of common life. Why, philosophically
speaking, you are right; I doubt whether my
writings ever did convince; I doubt, whether
they were ever published or printed:—O yes,
without doubt, Sir, I doubt very much—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT surely, now, that theory of yours cannot
be well founded. Is it possible, that you should,
with serious confidence, doubt whether your wri∣tings
ever gave conviction, or ever appeared in
print?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT I tell you, Sir, that I doubt of it, with as
great certainty, as I believe,—no, I mean as I
doubt, my own existence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRAES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU firmly believe that you doubt it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="263" REF="255"/>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES, Sir; and any one who has read my Essays
will firmly, if he is a real philosopher, believe
that he doubts the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND pray, do you think it more favours the
principle of universal scepticism to believe that
you doubt, than to believe that you do not doubt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, that you know nothing of the mat∣ter—And,
to be sure I do doubts, whether my be∣lief
in my doubts be real or not. This I must do
according to my principles: for I have said, <HI>ipse
dixi,</HI> that a true philosopher is doubtful of his
doubts, as well as of his convictions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU do not, by your principles, believe any
thing, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY no means: as a philosopher I believe noth∣ing
certainly; and have said, that he who believes
<PB N="264" REF="256"/>
any thing certainly is a fool. The phrase, you
may think, has not the highest polish of Parisian
civility; but of my <HI>friends</HI> not one ever objected
to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU seemed to think, that confirmed doubt
implies belief; implies your believing that you
are doubtful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES; I allow that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>THEN you can neither believe any thing, nor
doubt any thing; as the former supposes belief
directly, and the latter by implication. So that
your mind can never be employed on any thought
at all; for, if it were, that would imply some∣thing
either of belief or of doubt with respect to
the thought, or with respect to the manner of
your thinking of it. But you allow, that doubt
implies believing that you are doubtful. There∣fore
you cannot think without believing: and as,
according to your principles, you cannot believe,
so neither, according to your principles, can you
think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="265" REF="257"/>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I TELL you, old gentleman, you know nothing
of the matter; and that you are—no, that I doubt
whether you are not, one of the most pertina∣cious,
impertinent, ill-bred—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>PARDON my interrupting you, good Sir. But,
I must now take the liberty to inform you, that
you are speaking to one nearly equal, perhaps, in
philosophy, even to yourself. I must also tell you,
as you are a stranger to our customs, that it will
not be for your interest to maintain any doctrine
<HI>here</HI> which you do not believe: for if such no∣tions
cannot be driven out by the conversation of
Socrates, it may be tried whether they will re∣sist—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOCRATES, Sir, is a person for whom I must be
underdood to have a very great respect: it is
fashionable in the best company to speak of him
respectfully. When I was in Paris, they called
me (and my friends in—politely re-echoed
the words) <HI>Le Socrate moderne.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="266" REF="258"/>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>VERY likely: but that is not to the present pur∣pose.
Proceed, if you please, in the argument
with Socrates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I DENY not, that, from what he has said, it ap∣pears
plain enough, that if mind did exist, adn
could employ itself in thinking, the first princi∣ples
of investigation must be founded in belief.
But as I deny the existence of mind, and conse∣quently
of thought, it is not necessary for me to
allow, that his reasoning affects my theory. The
mind, although it must believe if it think, yet, if
it do not think, may as well doubt. Such is my
doctrine: and I am proud to declare, that, while
I was on earth, there were some who studied, and
many who embraced it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT I am willing to believe. Even in your own
house I doubt not that you must have had many
disciples. Every chair in your parlour would
have a smattering at least of knowledge in human
nature: and the table on which you wrote your
<PB N="267" REF="259"/>
Essays might discuss a point of scepticism not
much less accurately than yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>FIE, Socrates; it is beneath the dignity of a
philosopher to talk so absurdly. What a jumble
of inconsistencies have you thrown together! Did
I ever hint, or could I ever believe, that a table
or chair could reason like myself; or suppose a
piece of insensible matter to be endowed with hu∣man
faculties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>BEFORE I give you an answer, allow me to ask
you a plain question with regard to <HI>nothing;</HI> that
idea, or rather word, which you seem to be so fond
of. Is not <HI>nothing,</HI> with respect to matter, for ex∣ample,
destitute of the qualities of magnitude and
solidity, which are essential to matter? And, with
regard to mind, is it not destitute of all the quali∣ties
of mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I DO not well understand these questions; but
I admit at once, that a non-entity cannot possess
qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="268" REF="260"/>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND what is your idea of <HI>difference?</HI> Would
you call two things different, which both possess
the same qualities?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>BY no means. When two things are spoken of
as different, it must be meant, that one of them
possesses some quality which the other does not
possess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>WELL: if you and your table be different, must
not one of the two have some quality or qualities
that the other has not? And since <HI>nothing</HI> cannot
possess any quality; and since both you and your
table are (by your theory) nothing; neither of
the two can possess any quality. So that when
you deny the existence of matter and spirit, you
in fact allow, that the same thing at the same time
does possess qualities, and does not possess quali∣ties.
And you will find, that this is not the only
instance of such absurdity in sceptical reasoning:
you will find, that in almost all the principles of
<PB N="269" REF="261"/>
your system, as far as it is sceptical, similar con∣tradictions
are implied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>THERE does appear to be a little absurdity in
supposing that spirit and matter do not exist; as
they are evidently different, and therefore must
possess qualities. But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND you seemed to allow, that, if the soul
exist, universal scepticism is impossible, because
this implies a necessary want of all thought; which
is inconsistent with the nature of the soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>PERHAPS from what has been said, the existence
of the soul, and the impossibility of universal scepti∣cism,
might appear sufficiently certain to the com∣mon
herd of mankind. But you are not aware,
my good Sir, that I hold one tenet, which totally
destroys the force of every argument. I hold,
that the senses and the memory are fallacious; and
that, by consequence, one cannot be sure of the
reality of what one perceives or remembers. So
that we ought not by any reasoning to be con∣vinced,
<PB N="270" REF="262"/>
as we are apt both to misunderstand and
to forget it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is strange if you do not see that, in this res∣pect,
your own arguments are liable to the same
objection with those of your opponents.—But, pas∣sing
this; what reason have you to think that the
senses are deceitful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>LET me answer you by another question. Have
not mankind in general agreed to call the faculty
perceiving, the object perceived, and the act of
perception, by one and the same name?—thereby
indicating, that those three are, according to po∣pular
opinion, really the same thing. Now the
<HI>faculty perceiving</HI> is in what we call the soul or
mind; as when one says, my <HI>sight</HI> is weak: so
likewise must the <HI>thing perceived</HI> be; as when one
says, I see a strange <HI>sight:</HI> and therefore the senses
give knowledge of no things external to the mind
but of such things only as are contained by it,
or within it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND can you really think, that men in general,
when they see a river or a mountain, believe it to
<PB N="271" REF="263"/>
exist only in their own mind? Bring me one man
of common sense who thinks so, and I submit to
your opinion. But you will not find, that man∣kind
never employ the same word to denote things
which they believe to be totally different.—When
you look at London from Highgate hill, have
you not a <HI>view</HI> of London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YES.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND when you look at a perspective represen∣tation
of London, have you not a <HI>view</HI> of Lon∣don?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>DOES it follow, that London and the perspec∣tive
representation of it are the same thing; or
that, while you have the drawing in your pocket,
you have the city in your pocket too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>NO: I own there is some reason in what you
say.—But though I were to admit that the senses
are not deceitful, which no sceptical philosopher
ever did or can admit, I must still adhere to the
<PB N="272" REF="264"/>
fallacious nature of memory; which is alone suf∣ficient
to overturn every argument: for if we are
not certain that the premises are as our memory
represents them, how can we be sure of our con∣clusion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>PLEASE to answer me a question or two. If a
thousand men were to observe the same thing at
the same time, and every one of the thousand, se∣parately
examined, to give the same account of
it; would it be a proof of the accuracy of their
observation, or of its inaccuracy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>OF its accuracy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>IF a thousand men were to remember the same
thing with the same circumstances; would it be
a proof of the exactness, or of the deceitfulness,
of memory?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>OF its exactness.</P>

<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND among the many thousands who have
read and attended to history, is there, do you
think, any person of a sound mind, who would
<PB N="273" REF="265"/>
differ from the rest in his remembrance of the
most material and undisputed events that histo∣rians
record? Would any one, for example, af∣firm
that Julius Cesar was not stabbed by con∣spirators,
but hanged for sheep-stealing; that Wil∣liam
the first conquered, not England but New
Zealand; that the Romans bombarded Carthage
with two-and-forty-pounders; and that Scipio
shot Hannibal with a rifle-barreled gun, as he
was getting into an air-balloon? And if the me∣mories
of men were fallacious, and of course con∣stantly
changing, could their remembrances of
the events of history so exactly coincide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>SOCRATES, I will hear you no longer: your ar∣guments
become troublesome; and if you persist
in this unphilosophical way of reasoning, we must
part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>PERHAPS you will not find it so easy as you
may imagine to get out of the reach of Socrates
and common sense. Remember where you are:
Paris and Versailles are a great way off. Believe me,
it will be for your interest here, whatever it might
have been in the world you have left, to listen to
<PB N="274" REF="266"/>
the truth, and to yield when you are convinced
by it. Obstinacy and scepticism are of no account
in these regions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS matter I find begins to grow somewhat
serious. If you oblige me to say what I think, I
fear I must give up the deceitfulness of memory
as well as of sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>TAKE the trouble to recollect what has been
said in this conversation, and has received your
assent. We have seen that neither the senses nor
the memory can with any propriety be called fal∣lacious;
and that therefore every argument which
reason approved, and continued to approve, may
be reckoned a just one. You allowed, that spirit
and matter are possessed of qualities, and conse∣quently
of existence; and that, the existence of
mind being admitted, universal scepticism is im∣possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOUR arguments seem to have something in
them. And I own I was sorry to see your doc∣trine
advanced, to the detriment both of my fame
and of my bookseller, even before I left the other
world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="275" REF="267"/>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU left the other world! I will undertake to
prove, according to your own mode of reasoning,
that you are there still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HEARTILY wish you could. How would you
prove that, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I COULD prove it from the consideration that
you are at present in the shades below.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU have certainly not only forgotten your
philosophy, old gentleman, but lost your wits.
Why, that would be proving a proposition from
a principle directly contradictory to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>AND is this contradiction more glaring than to
deduce <HI>universal scepticism</HI> from any principle of
<HI>belief</HI> whatever. Let the principle be what it will,
either that Spirit and Matter do, or do not, exist;
still belief is implied: and to prove, from a prin∣ciple
believed, that we can believe nothing, is not
in my opinion less ridiculous, than to prove that
you are in the other world, because you are in
this. You allowed that spirit and matter have
<PB N="276" REF="268"/>
existence, and that consequently universal scepti∣cism
is impossible: you now see, that this must
be thought an impossibility, even by one who
could be mad enough to believe that spirit and
matter do not exist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M. P.</SPEAKER>
<P>I FEAR my system must fall to pieces. But is
it not pity to overturn a scheme so friendly to the
elegancies of fashionable life, and which renders
the mind of man so light and easy, by relieving
it from all apprehensions of future existence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOCRATES.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU still forget where you are: you cannot, it
seems, even in this world, keep clear of the licen∣tious
jargon to which you were so long accustom∣ed
in the other. As to the tendency of your doc∣trines,
and of the inferences that may be fairly
drawn from them,—no person capable of serious
thought can for a moment believe them to be be∣neficial
to mankind: you yourself will be of this
opinion soon, if you are not so already. All love
to God, to our neighbour, and even to ourselves,
they would extinguish; for who can love that
which he does not believe to exist! From no sort
of wickedness, that man may wish to commit,
<PB N="277" REF="269"/>
would they deter: for they teach, that reason
ought to be the servant, or rather the slave, of
passion; and that the impulses of passion, being
the necessary effects of necessary causes, are irre∣sistable,
and therefore need not be resisted: that
there is no good reason for distinguishing moral
virtue from intellectual ability; in other words,
that men are under no stronger obligations to be
just than to be eloquent, and that to have a weak
memory is as bad a thing as to pick a pocket.
But I scorn to enter into the detail of your para∣doxes.
I shall only say, that they are not adapted
to the head or heart of any one who is not both
a profligate and a fool: and that you, by endea∣vouring
to subvert every thing that has been be∣lieved
concerning <HI>mind,</HI> have done such a service
to philosophy, as a prince would do to his people
in attempting to destroy all the restraints of go∣vernment,
and consequently all the protection.</P>

<P>TO enjoy <HI>in future</HI> the company of a gentleman,

which I <HI>set great store by,</HI> though obtained by the

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY, friend, where did you learn your English?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was born and bred in London, and of such
<HI>marked</HI> regularity in my <HI>line of conduct,</HI> that no
man could charge me with a single act of <HI>incivism,</HI>
or any thing that <HI>went</HI> to the <HI>disorganization</HI> of the
society of which I was a member. I served an
apprenticeship to a <HI>tip-top</HI> bookseller; and have
<PB N="279" REF="271"/>
often heard the most learned authors discuss points
of literature: I have seen them, Sir, for hours <HI>on
their legs,</HI> and <HI>going into a variety of matter.</HI> The
deuce is in it, if I do not speak English of the
very newest and best pattern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>IN what part of the town did your learned au∣thors
find kennels and dunghills to wade into in
the way you mention? Fleet-ditch, I am told, is
now decent; and has not half that variety of fil∣thy
matter, dead cats and dogs, drowned puppies,
and stinking sprats,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Swift's description of a city shower.</NOTE> which it formerly had. But
first of all, friend, what was your last employ∣ment
in the other world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>In place</HI> of <HI>negativing</HI> your questions as <HI>inimical,</HI>
though I own that <HI>at this first blush of the business</HI>
they appear so, I shall be happy <HI>on the instant</HI> to
<HI>meet your ideas,</HI> and <HI>narrate</HI> what you <HI>desiderate,</HI>
not doubting of being <HI>well heard.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>SIR, I am not deaf now, as I was in the other

world: I shall hear you well enough if you speak
distinctly. I ask, what trade you followed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU mean, I suppose, in what <HI>professional line</HI> I
was bred. I hinted already, that my employment
was to <HI>bring forward</HI> to the view of the publick <HI>at
large</HI> the <HI>ideas</HI> of the learned: in other words, I
was in the typographical and <HI>bookselling lines;</HI> and
am <HI>free to say,</HI> that in both <HI>lines</HI> my <HI>line of conduct</HI>
was <HI>indicative</HI> of <HI>exactitude</HI> to a <HI>degree.</HI> I <HI>netted,</HI>
Sir, although my <HI>expenditures</HI> were not small, so
considerable a sum, that, on the <HI>demise</HI> of my wife,
who <HI>resigned her existence</HI> about a year ago, I <HI>sported
sables</HI> in my own <HI>gig and pair.</HI> I <HI>had in contempla∣tion</HI>
a seat <HI>in the Commons;</HI> but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>SO; you were a bookseller. In my time, how∣ever,
the idea of a learned man could have been
comprehended by the <HI>large publick,</HI> or the <HI>publick at
large</HI> (how did you call it, pray?) without the
help of an interpreter. But perhaps I did not take
your meaning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="281" REF="273"/>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>DEAR Sir, what <HI>unfounded ideas</HI> you <HI>bring for∣ward!</HI>
You take me up <HI>on a ground</HI> entirely dif∣ferent
from that on which I intended to <HI>meet you.</HI>
I have formerly <HI>set store by you;</HI> having heard you
<HI>held forth</HI> as one who had secured the <HI>marked</HI> ap∣probation
of many. You seem inclined to <HI>mal∣treat</HI>
me, but have said nothing that <HI>militates</HI> a∣gainst
me as a <HI>professional</HI> man, or <HI>goes</HI> to <HI>substan∣tiate</HI>
any charge <HI>inimical</HI> to my character. And
since you are pleased to be <HI>provocative,</HI> I am <HI>bold
to say</HI> that some of our best criticks <HI>scout</HI> and <HI>re∣probate</HI>
your yahoos with the most <HI>marked</HI> energy;
complain, that they <HI>feel</HI> squeamish when they think
of them; and <HI>have the idea</HI> that descriptions of
that <HI>description</HI> can be agreeable to readers of no
<HI>description.</HI> I have heard one author, whose name
has long been <HI>inregistrated</HI> in the annals of litera∣ture,
affirm that they are <HI>disgusting to civilization.</HI>
A justice of the peace of my acquaintance <HI>commit∣ed
himself</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>THE deuce he did! the laws as well as lan∣guage
of England must be greatly changed of
<PB N="282" REF="274"/>
late years. Go on, Sir, perhaps I may at last un∣derstand
you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I SAY, the justice <HI>committed himself,</HI> that he would
prove your diction as well as imagery to be low
and vulgar; that it has nothing of the <HI>ton</HI> in it,
no long sonorous phraseologies, no appearance of
your being <HI>conversative</HI> in antient or foreign lan∣gauge;
nothing, in a word, but what the com∣mon
people may understand, as well as the most
learned men in the kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>WAS there ever such a fellow! Hark you, Sir,
do you know whom you speak to, or what you
are speaking?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>MOST <HI>decidedly,</HI> Sir; but <HI>fellow me no fellows</HI> if
you please. Your writings, however great their
<HI>publicity</HI> may once have been, <HI>have had their day;</HI>
they are now a <HI>boar,</HI> Sir, a mere <HI>boar.</HI> I <HI>took more
money</HI> last winter by the <HI>Passions of Werter,</HI> than I
have <HI>taken</HI> by a seven years sale of the lucubra∣tions
of Swift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>WERTER! what is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="283" REF="275"/>
<SPEAKER>BOOKSELLER.</SPEAKER>
<P>HAVE you never heard of Werter? what an
illiterate, out-of-the-way world is this! You can have
no <HI>fashion</HI> among you; nothing <HI>clever</HI> or <HI>sentimen∣tal,</HI>
nothing that <HI>implicates reciprocity</HI> of the finer
feelings. Why, Sir, Werter is one of the most
<HI>eventual</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eventual</HI> and <HI>Eventful</HI> are confounded in the new-fashioned jargon.</NOTE> and <HI>impressive</HI> of all our <HI>novel</HI> novels:
the demand there is for it <HI>out-bounds</HI> your com∣prehension.
You smile; but what I say is <HI>a truism.</HI>
If you would <HI>be agreeable</HI> to hear, I would give
you a <HI>statement</HI> of some particulars. Werter is a
true hero, and in his <HI>line of conduct,</HI> as a person of
the highest honour and fashion, most <HI>correct;</HI>
though a German by birth, he must have kept the
best company in France; and so extraordinary a
scholar, that he actually carried a Homer, a Greek
Homer, Sir, in his pocket. But misfortune <HI>ingur∣gitated</HI>
him in the very lowest <HI>ebb</HI> of distress. His
affections were <HI>captured</HI> by a neighbouring gen∣tleman's
lady, with whom he wished to have a <HI>sen∣timental
arrangement,</HI> a little <HI>flirtation</HI>—(you under∣stand
me)—an <HI>affair of gallantry,</HI> I mean; and
whose cruelty <HI>fractured</HI> the good young man's
<PB N="284" REF="276"/>
heart, and made him <HI>temerariously</HI> put a termina∣tion
to his <HI>existence.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT. (to MERCURY entering.)</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU come in good time, Mercury. Our friend
Horace says, you were famous in your day for
eloquence; perhaps you may be able to interpret
some of this learned person's gibberish. He was
speaking of one Werter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I overheard all that passed, so you need not re∣capitulate.
Those same Passions of Werter I have
seen. Werter tried to corrupt his neighbour's
wife, and not wholly without success; but, find∣ing
the lady not quite so forward as he wished,
he left her in a rage, blew his brains out with a
pistol, and (if we believe some men of rhime who
have been whimpering on the occasion) went in∣continently
to heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>IS it possible that so silly a tale can be popular?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT is possible, for it is true, or, as this gentle∣man
would perhaps say, is a <HI>truism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="285" REF="277"/>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM glad I have got out of that vile world,
It was in my time so bad, that I foolishly thought
it could not be worse; but now it must have re∣nounced
both common honesty and common sense.
But whence comes it, that I understand so little
of this man's English?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WOULD you have Englishmen of the present
age speaks the language of Queen Anne's reign?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>CERTAINLY. Why did Addison and I and
some others take so much pains to improve and
fix the English tongue? Should we have done
that, think you, if we had imagined that, in so
short a time, it would be so miserably altered and
debased? But who are they who thus take it up∣on
them to disfigure the language, and by so do∣ing
to discredit the literature, of England? Not
surely the most respectable part of the communi∣ty.
Men of true learning and good judgement
are anxious to preserve the purity of language.
Those barbarous idioms I take to be the manufac∣ture
of illiterate and affected persons, who mistake
<PB N="286" REF="278"/>
grimace for elegance, and assume the appearance
of learning because they know nothing of its re∣ality.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU are a pretty good guesser, my old friend.
But you must know there is now, in the world
you left, a most vehement rage of innovation in
language, government, religion, and every thing
else. That a thing is new, is now a sufficient re∣commendation,
however inconvenient it may be,
however unnatural and unseemly: nay the more
unnatural it is, the better chance it has of coming
into fashion. On the British stage, with infinite ap∣plause,
young and beautiful actresses perform some∣times
the parts of highwaymen; and some singing
actors squall in an affected voice resembling, and
intended to imitate, that of women: the most
humourous dramatick pieces are frittered away
into songs: and I should not be surprised to hear,
that henceforth Miranda and Juliet are to be per∣sonated
by grim-visaged grenadiers seven feet high,
and Falstaff by a slender miss just entered in her
teens; that Hotspur and Henry of Monmouth
are to fight to the tune of Lillibullero; and that
Hamlet and Cato will sing their respective solilo∣quies
in a dance accompanied with a Scotch bag∣pipe.
<PB N="287" REF="279"/>
Similar remarks I could make on other
publick exhibitions. The pulp—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE will, if you please, defer those to another
opportunity. In the mean time I wish to hear
more particulars of the degeneracy of the English
tongue, and of the principles on which it seems to
have been conducted. It is a subject, you know,
which engaged my attention not a little, while I
was on the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>WOULD you have me give you the arrangement
and natural history of chaos!—However, though
I cannot pretend to enter minutely into so com∣plex
a business, I shall offer a few directions, which
would enable you, if you were so disposed, to
make English <HI>of the newest and best pattern</HI> as well
nearly as this learned bookseller.—My first rule is
a very comrehensive one: “Avoid short words
as much as possible, however significant and
well-sounding, especially if they be of English
or Saxon original, and universally understood;
and, in order to raise admiration of your learn∣ing,
use, in their stead, longer words derived
from the Greek, Latin, or French.” Instead of
<PB N="288" REF="280"/>
life, new, wish for, take, plunge, &amp;c, you must say
<HI>existence, novel, desiderate, capture, ingurgitate, &amp;c:</HI>
as—a sever put an end to his <HI>existence</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>BUT that would mean—annihilated him both
body and soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>TRUE; but language is not now thought the
worse for being ambiguous; and ambiguity of
manner is not in less request than ambiguity of
phrase: it is considered as a proof of consummate
urbanity, when a writer, even a writer of history,
and of antient history too, so disguises himself,
that his reader cannot find out whether he be in
jest or earnest. Besides, I need not tell you, that
by many genteel people death and annihilation
are supposed to be the same thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>PROCEED, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>INSTEAD of a new fashion, you will do well to
say—A <HI>novel</HI> fashion; for this looks like French,
and this by the common people will not be un∣derstood.
For the same reason, and to show your
<PB N="289" REF="281"/>
skill in the Latin tongue, say, not—I wish to be
quiet, but,—I <HI>desiderate</HI> quietness, or rather <HI>quie∣tude:</HI>
and you must on no account speak of tak∣ing
the enemy's ships, towns, guns, or baggage;
it must be <HI>capturing.</HI> About twenty years ago,
when this word was imported, I heard a surly
English ghost remark, that, since his countrymen
had learned to talk of <HI>capturing</HI> ships, they seemed
to have lost the art of taking them; but Rodney
and Hood have since proved that he was mista∣ken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>YOU mentioned <HI>plunge</HI> as an unfashionable verb.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ingurgitate</HI> is more genteel; because it is long,
uncommon, and sonorous, and to those who have
no Latin utterly unintelligible. He was <HI>ingurgi∣tated
in the lowest ebb of distress</HI> is fine language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ebb,</HI> that must mean <HI>abatement</HI> of distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>FORMERLY it might have been so; but you
may now see <HI>lowest ebb</HI> used for <HI>greatest depth,</HI>
<PB N="290" REF="282"/>
and it is thought elegant, because new. I know
not whether I mentioned <HI>sort</HI> and <HI>kind</HI> as unfa∣shionable
nouns; they are quite vulgar: <HI>descrip∣tion</HI>
being longer, and of Latin original, is thought
much better than either, whatever harshness or
confusion it may occasion. Our friend the book∣seller
gave a good example, when he said, of your
description of the yahoos, that descriptions of that
<HI>description</HI> can be agreeable to readers of no <HI>des∣cription.</HI>
—But of this part of the subject we have
had enough. Proceed we now, therefore, to rule
the second, which is this: “Always, when you
can, prefer figurative to proper expression, and
be not nice in the choice of your figures, nor
give yourself much trouble about their consist∣ency.”</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SWIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>THAT is just the contrary of what I used to re∣commend.
A few examples, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MERCURY.</SPEAKER>
<P>INSTEAD of—He spoke an hour on various
topicks, you must say—<HI>He was an hour upon his
legs, and went into a variety of matter:</HI> an idiom,
which is now very common, and much admired;
because it is <HI>figurative, verbose,</HI> and <HI>ambiguous:</HI>
<PB N="291" REF="283"/>
three qualities of style, which are now, among
fashionable writers and speakers, indispensable.—Instead
of—He undervalues his enemies,—say,
<HI>He sets no store by his enemies,</HI> or rather, <HI>He sets no
store by those who are inimical to him. Inimical</HI> is a
great favourite, though they who use it are not
yet agreed about the pronunciation of it. It
came in at the same time with the verb <HI>capture,</HI>
and from the same quarter. Unfriendly and hos∣tile
must both give place to <HI>inimical;</HI> the former,
because it is mere English; the latter, because,
though of Latin original, it is universally under∣stood.
—Instead of—At first view, you must say—<HI>At
the first blush of the business. Hold out</HI> is a figu∣rative
phrase of very general use: every imagin∣able
conception of the human mind is now sup∣posed
to have hands and arms for holding out
something.—Letters from Spain <HI>hold out</HI> an <HI>inimi∣cal</HI>
appearance: This plan or idea <HI>holds out</HI> great
advantages: Distress of mind is <HI>held out</HI> by phy∣sicians
as the cause of his bad health.—But I see
you grow impatient, and shall go on to my third
rule, of which I gave a hint already. “Avoid con∣ciseness,
and use as many words as possible.”
When you speak of a man's conduct, you must
always call it, his <HI>line of conduct;</HI> and instead of
<PB N="292" REF="284"/>
an authentick narrative,—you must say, a narra∣tive
<HI>marked with authenticity.</HI> Indeed, the words
<HI>line, meet, marked, feel, go,</HI> and some others, may
be used on all occasions, whether they have mean∣ing
or not? as—He was received with <HI>marked</HI> ap∣plause,
<HI>marked</HI> insult, <HI>marked</HI> contempt, <HI>marked</HI> ad∣miration;
<HI>meet</HI> your wishes, <HI>meet</HI> your arguments,
<HI>meet</HI> your support, <HI>meet</HI> your ideas, <HI>meet</HI> your feel∣ings,
<HI>meet</HI> you on any ground, &amp;c. Then as to
<HI>line</HI>—every thing is now a <HI>line.</HI> You must not
say, He is in the army, but, He is in the <HI>military
line,</HI> or in the <HI>army line;</HI> nor, He is bred to busi∣ness,
but, He is bred <HI>in a professional line.</HI> So, in∣stead
of, He is a hair-dresser, clergyman, printer,
perfumer, merchant, fisherman, &amp;c, you will be
laughed at if you do not say, He is <HI>in the hair∣dressing
line, in the clerical line, in the printing line,
in the perfumery line, in the mercantile line, in the
fishing line,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Feel</HI> has become so very fashion∣able,

<P>IT is not. In the British senate, and in some

<P>BOLINGBROKE was a shallow fellow, though I
own he imposed on Pope and me; but on a bet∣ter,
wiser, and more learned man than either of us,
I mean Arbuthnot, he did not impose: the doctor
understood him well. Bolingbroke's ostentation
kept his ignorance out of sight, and because he
<PB N="294" REF="286"/>
was positive we thought him penetrating. He
could turn a sentence so as to make it sound well;
but it was all <HI>words, words,</HI> as Hamlet says. For
my part, you know I never valued those modula∣ted
periods, as I think your criticks call them;
brevity, simplicity, and proper words in proper
places, form, in my opinion, the perfection of elo∣quence.

<P>I MENTIONED the necessity which an English

using long words: I ought to have added, that it
is also thought genteel sometimes to shorten
ordinary expressions. For <HI>reformation</HI> every body
now says <HI>reform;</HI> this being French, and the o∣ther
vile old English: instead of—for the future,
it is fashionable to say <HI>in future;</HI> and beautiful
(or ugly) <HI>to a degree,</HI> instead of—to a great degree.
The last example has also the advantage of being
elegant on account of its ambiguity: as the fol∣lowing
very fashionable phrases have, of being
not merely ambiguous, but unintelligible: he
<HI>sported sables, scouted the idea, netted a cool thousand,</HI>

<P>BOXING is a blackguard art: who made it <HI>fine,</HI>

<P>THERE are many fine arts now: Dancing, Tum∣bling,

art.—But, as I was saying, Since Boxing became
a fine art, it is quite vulgar to call a professor of
it a <HI>Boxer.</HI> Some learned innovator, having heard
of the Latin <HI>Pugil,</HI> thought of introducing it;
but <HI>pugil</HI> was too diminutive a name for a thing of
such magnitude; and therefore, clapping to it
part of a Greek termination, he made it <HI>pugilist;</HI>
which being instantly adopted by the <HI>dilettanti</HI>

rise to the adjectives <HI>Pugilistick,</HI> and <HI>Pugilistical,</HI> as

<P>AS a friend to the dignity of man; and sur∣veying
innovations in philosophy and politicks
with equal distrust; I cannot observe, without a∣larm
and astonishment, the late increase of Natur∣al
Philosophers; as they call themselves;—not
improperly, I own, if we are to understand the
<PB N="299" REF="291"/>
word <HI>natural</HI> as a substantive. I consider them
as the missionaries of a hostile power, encouraging
us to mutiny, and bribing us to migration; se∣ducing
our attention from WORDS to THINGS: from
WORDS, the characteristick of rationality, the repo∣sitory
of science, the vehicle of truth, to THINGS,
whereof men and brutes participate equally, and
which jumble and confound all that is lovely and
true with all that is false and abominable.</P>
<P>CAMILLUS, a brave and patriotick warrior, of∣ten
merited the thanks of his countrymen; but
never perhaps so highly, as when, by proposing
new prospects of advantage and new causes of en∣dearment,
he persuaded the Roman youth, just
setting out for Veii, to rebuild and inhabit the ci∣ty
of their fathers. A similar service will that man
do to philosophy, who shall restrain it from chac∣ing
the novelties of modern experiment, and keep
it in those antient and venerable seats, which Py∣thagoras,
Zeno, Aristotle, Plato, Chrysippus, and
Philetas, have fortified and adorned.—“Signifer,
statue signum; hic manebimus optime.”<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Liv. V. 55.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="292"/>
I congratulate my country and the age I live
in, that literary patriotism is not extinguished;
and that some noble efforts have of late been made,
discovering to the curious philologist unbounded
regions of comparison and conjecture. The con∣junction
<HI>if</HI> is at last referred to <HI>giving;</HI> and its equi∣valant
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (<HI>ei</HI>) derived from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (<HI>cimi</HI>) and <HI>si</HI> from <HI>sum.</HI>
The preposition <HI>ad,</HI> and <HI>at</HI> the disjunctive, are no
longer different words, but the same word; <HI>to</HI> and
<HI>too</HI> coalesce in like manner: not to mention other
conjunctions, which are now found to signify a
chest, perhaps, or passage, or pantry door. A great
part of the reasoning, which led to such valuable
discoveries, is indeed so brief and simple, that, as
happens with regard to most discoveries truly va∣luable,
I often wonder that I did not hit upon it
myself. But, in this subject, I am resolved to de∣serve
the praise of doing well, though I cannot
pretend to be the first who has done so. Uncul∣tivated
science is like an uncultivated country;
where to walk first may be most honourable, but
where to follow is often as profitable, and always
more safe.</P>
<P>OF the journey, however, there is one part, in
which I no more condescend to be a follower; but
<PB N="301" REF="293"/>
with that noble ambition, which I flatter myself
is no ambiguous characteristick of a great mind,
have dared even to outstrip my guides. It has
been proved by learned men, that <HI>ad</HI> and <HI>at</HI> of
the Latins, and the English <HI>to</HI> and <HI>too,</HI> are several∣ly
equivalent. I go further. I not only compare
those particles among themselves, but apply them
to the invariable standard of nature; and hope to
prove that the English <HI>to</HI> is synonymous not only
with <HI>too,</HI> but with <HI>toe</HI> in like manner; from which
I shall show that its origin is derived, and to
which all its significations refer. The correspon∣dent
Greek and Latin particles I shall allude to
as far only as they may serve to illustrate this
main point. For of my discoveries though I am
not selfish enough to desire that the advantage
should be with-held from other languages and na∣tions,
yet I think it highly reasonable, that <HI>my</HI>
language and <HI>my</HI> nation should enjoy the first be∣nefit
and honour.</P>
<P>PERSONS unaccustomed to the more recondite
sorts of grammatical disquisition will perhaps think
my reasoning in some particulars far-fetched and
minute. To such I shall only suggest the exam∣ple
of the good old gentleman in the play, who,
<PB N="302" REF="294"/>
when admonished to mind his own business, and
not concern himself about that of other people,
nobly replied, “<HI>homo</HI> sum, <HI>humani</HI> nihil a me alie∣num
puto.” I likewise, who am a man of let∣ters,
think nothing foreign from my speculations
which regards even a letter.</P>
<P>IN the first part of my subject, in which the
dignity of the foot and toe, and their consequent
fitness for giving rise to a preposition, come na∣turally
to be considered, I shall not insist on that
superstitious, or political, attention, wherewith the
women of China (a country which in several dis∣coveries
has got the start of Europe) contract and
fashion the feet of their daughters. Nor need I
expatiate on the wisdom of the ancient Romans,
who distinguished their great men from the vul∣gar,
not by stars, garters, or ribbons, but by
boots:<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Hor. Sat. VI. 27.</NOTE> far less will I pollute my page with the
modern foppery of buckles and rose-knots; or of
shoes, which now can hardly contain the feet, but
which were formerly in this nation so unwieldy,
that it was necessary to support their points by a
string from the knee. Nor shall I examine the
<PB N="303" REF="295"/>
theory of dancing; an art with which the honour
of the feet is intimately connected, and which the
senate and people of Rome held in such reverence,
that except in religious service they did not suffer
it to appear: an art, however, much practised by
the Greeks; who enjoined it by law, displayed it
in their most solemn exhibitions, and adorned it
with their noblest poetry: an art every where re∣commended
by the powerful voice of nature; but,
alas! whose martial and majestick dignity died
with that prince of Grammarians Scaliger, who
was the last man that capered in the true <HI>pyrrick</HI>
of the antients.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, I beseech you, what distinguished
reverence, according to the laws of antient hospi∣tality,
which were not cramped with feudal ser∣vitude
or finical affectation, was invariably paid
to the feet. Fair ladies and princes assisted at
washing the feet of the pilgrim; an honour sel∣dom
or never offered to the hands or face. Even
we, in these days of degeneracy, while we kiss the
cheek of our friend, or the hand of our sovereign,
salute, in testimony of more profound veneration,
the great toe of the pope. Even we <HI>tread,</HI> or talk
at least of <HI>treading,</HI> the paths of virtue: and while
<PB N="304" REF="296"/>
by <HI>unhandiness</HI> we denote but a trifling and cura∣ble
inadvertency, bestow the appellation of a <HI>false
step</HI> on crimes irreparable and unpardonable.</P>
<P>I MUST not omit to mention a well-known fact;
that men, who in punishing an equal would strike
with the fist, avenge themselves of an inferiour by
a kick with the toe: a proof, that with this organ
are associated ideas of authority and independence
which to the fist do not belong. The heroes of
Homer, too, while insulting a vanquished enemy,
press him, as the poet says, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, with the foot or
heel: and Virgil positively affirms, that Turnus,
having slain the gallant youth Pallas, pressed him
with the left foot. <HI>Laevo pressit pede</HI> are the words:
and I would recommend it to those, who reject in
this particular the authority of Virgil, to consider
their own stength; or, as another great author
has it,—Quid ferre recusent, quid valeant humeri;
lest they should be as unequally matched with the
illustrious poet of Mantua, as Evander's son was
with the valiant though unsuccessful lover of
Lavinia.—Tu ne divinam Aeneida tenta, sed longe
sequere et vestigia semper adora. <HI>Vestigia!</HI> To
what quarter shall we turn, where testimonies will
not present themselves of the dignity of the foot!</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="297"/>
BY the foot is denoted the zeal of friendship, as
well as the majesty of power. To give consent by
nodding the <HI>head</HI> may have been agreeable to the
fashion of Olympus, as it was Jupiter's constant
practice; but among mortals would be considered
as a mark of frigid approbation: and a show of
<HI>hands</HI> may determine the issue of an election, but
does not manifest uncommon regard or anxiety.
But <HI>Pedibus</HI> in sententiam ire signified, among the
wise Romans, affectionate confidence, and eager
approbation. Need I further urge the opinion of
a certain philosopher,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Prior's Alma.</NOTE> who asserts that the soul
enters its body at the feet (even as the grand sei∣gnior
does his bed): a doctrine which, if not de∣monstrably
certain, must have been in some re∣pute
among those who drank of that deep foun∣tain
of philosophy, the Peripatetick school; the
principles whereof were, as the name implies, con∣nected
with walking, and by consequence with
feet.</P>
<P>THE honourable appellation of <HI>foot</HI> is not con∣fined
to animals, but is applied to every thing use∣ful
or great in the works of art and nature. We
do not say the <HI>leg</HI> of a table, a chair, a column,
<PB N="306" REF="298"/>
but the <HI>foot;</HI> we speak in like manner of the <HI>foot;</HI>
of a pyramid or mountain, never the <HI>leg.</HI> Italy,
formerly the mistress of nations, appears in the
map as a boot; which I own supposes a leg, but
in which a foot is also comprehended; and the sole
of that boot faces the south, a very respectable quar∣ter
of the sky; and the toe points at Sicily, intimat∣ting
its authority to kick even the granary of
the world (for so that island was sometimes cal∣led)
without being in the least intimidated by
Scylla and Charybdis: the <HI>ingurgitations</HI> of the one,
the <HI>evomitions</HI> of the other, or even the thundering
<HI>eructations</HI> of Etna itself. We characterise the con∣fidence
of friendship by saying that people are on
a good <HI>footing:</HI> and though Cesar had a <HI>hand</HI> in
the invasion of Britain, it would have required a
power greater than Cesar's to get <HI>footing</HI> there.</P>
<P>I need not remind the intelligent reader, that
<HI>feet</HI> are the foundation of measure, and the apprai∣sers
of quantity: a sufficient proof of the trust re∣posed
in them by the wisdom of our forefathers.
Nay Horace extends their influence to the men∣suration
of quality as well as quantity, when he
says <HI>Metiri</HI> se quemque suo <HI>pede</HI> verum est. Nor
<PB N="307" REF="299"/>
can we fail to observe, in many names denoting
quality, and in many abstract terms of science,
an allusion to the support of the feet. Thus, in
Latin <HI>gradus</HI> (step) degree; <HI>casus</HI> (falling) case;
and in our own tongue <HI>supposition, subject, supplant,
understanding, inculcate,</HI> and many others. Trage∣dy
too, and comedy, derived from the foot one of
their antient designations; being distinguished
and named by the <HI>sock</HI> and <HI>buskin</HI> worn on the
feet of the actors. Hunc <HI>socci</HI> cepere pedem gran∣desque
<HI>cothurni.</HI></P>
<P>AND this leads me to remark, in more general
terms, that Poetry, the noblest effort of genius, is
formed and divided, as every schoolboy knows,
by feet. Even humbler sorts of writing claim a
connection with the same honourable member, de∣nominating
themselves <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>sermo pedestris.</HI>
Nor must I overlook a very notable coincidence
between the English noun <HI>prose</HI> or pedestris sermo,
and the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (pros) which actually signifies
the same thing with our preposition <HI>to,</HI> whose af∣finity
with <HI>toe</HI> I am endeavouring to establish. I
may add, that Horace, whose skill in criticism can
hardly be disputed, seems to be of opinion, that
a person standing on one foot will not be so cap∣able
<PB N="308" REF="300"/>
of poetick composition as if he were standing
on both feet:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hor. Sat. 1. 4.</NOTE> a certain evidence, if the fact be
acknowledged, that human as well as grammatical
feet are subservient to poetry. For of a member
whose absence is detrimental, the presence must
be beneficial.</P>
<P>PULCHRUM est, says a Roman poet, digito
monstrari et dicier hic est.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Persius, Sat. 1.</NOTE> Now it being <HI>unpo∣lite,</HI>
which is the reverse of <HI>pulchrum,</HI> to point with
the finger at individuals in the street, I am sure
every learned reader will agree with me, that <HI>digi∣to</HI>
in this passage must mean, not the finger, but
the <HI>toe,</HI> a sense in which it is used by Virgil<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Aeneid, V. 426.</NOTE> and
other authors: “it is a fine thing to be pointed at
with the toe.” Every body must have observed,
that it is natural for us to turn our toes towards
the person whom we look at. Dancing masters,
indeed, and Frenchmen, turn theirs aside; which
is called <HI>turning out</HI> their toes, that is, degrading
them, as a prime minister is degraded when he is
<HI>turned out;</HI> but that attitude is wholly artificial,
and so inconvenient that the late dauphin of France,
if we may believe newspapers, lost his life by it.
<PB N="309" REF="301"/>
To which I may add, that the article in Greek,
corresponding to our English <HI>the,</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that the
word <HI>article</HI> signifies a <HI>joint;</HI> and that, by some
Latin writers, <HI>articuli pedis,</HI> the joints of the foot,
are used for <HI>the toes.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE now given abundant evidence of that
respectful attention which has been paid to the
foot, and especially to its toes; by which, as a
plant by its flower, it is both characterized and
adorned. Permit me, however, to add, that the
feet and toes, which have thus in the most enlight∣tened
nations been the seat of authority, the em∣blem
of rectitude, the spring of science, and the
object of affection and reverence, are also the dis∣tinguishing
characteristick of the human race. For
ingenious anatomists, after a most accurate dissec∣tion
of the Ouran Outan's body—(anatomists
never think of souls)—find no criterion so decisive
as the toes and the feet, whereby his species may
be distinguished from the human. And although
the godlike Pythagoras, or the divine Plato, who
had a glimpse of the pre-eminence of humanity,
defined man to be <HI>implume bipes,</HI> a featherless two
footed thing, and though Sallust and Ovid distin∣guished
<PB N="310" REF="302"/>
him by the <HI>Os sublime;</HI> yet both these cha∣racters
apply to the Outang: whose feet, never∣theless,
are prominent at the heel, and whose great
toes and thumbs very nearly resemble. Accord∣ingly,
the sagacious Greeks, though content in
common language to denominate the human spe∣cies,
from its erect stature, <HI>Anthrópos,</HI> (a term, by
the by, of no great pre-eminence, for at Athens,
when the article was prefixed, it belonged pecu∣liarly
to the hangman); yet, when they wished
to speak with accuracy in mentioning an indivi∣dual,
they honoured him with the appellation of
TWO TOES <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>): a word, which has long
been obsolete; but whose former existence and
signification appear sufficiently from its neuter
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be reasonably inferred, that
our prudent ancestors, who, in forming their pre∣positions,
often employed the name of a passage, a
seat, or a door, would not overlook a member so
important and honourable as the <HI>toe.</HI> This infer∣ence
would seem to be justly drawn, according to
the mode of argument usually employed in such
cases; wherein demonstration is seldom sought,
because it is not often to be found: and this in∣ference
<PB N="311" REF="303"/>
will, I trust, force conviction in those who
reflect, that the preposition <HI>to</HI> really exists, and is
found to be from experience what from reasoning
we should have expected. But as in the breast of
the candid reader I wish not to leave even the sha∣dow
of a doubt, I will in few words explain, why
the preposition <HI>to,</HI> from its connection with the
noun <HI>toe,</HI> came to acquire that signification, and
that only, which it now possesses.</P>
<P>IT cannot be doubted, that, in describing the
motions of the body, regard will naturally be
had to the parts of the body moved, and to their
relative positions. Thus we speak of turning to
the <HI>right hand</HI> and to the <HI>left:</HI> and in like manner
some antient nations, among whom perhaps the
refinements of <HI>right</HI> and <HI>left</HI> were not thoroughly
understood, spoke of turning to the <HI>shield</HI> and to
the <HI>spear;</HI> phrases, which a learned grammarian
of our own, Mr John Milton, has adopted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Paradise Lost, IV. 785.</NOTE>
We say in Latin, adversis opponere <HI>pectora</HI> rebus;
dare <HI>terga</HI> hosti; flectere in <HI>latus;</HI> in <HI>genua</HI> pro∣cumbere:
and, in the modern tongues, to talk <HI>tete
<PB N="312" REF="304"/>
a tete,</HI> to <HI>confront,</HI> to meet <HI>face to face,</HI> to drink <HI>hand
to fist,</HI> to walk <HI>side by side,</HI> to sit <HI>cheek by jowl,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>NOW the locomotive powers of man exert them∣selves
by his legs and feet; and by man, therefore,
motion will most naturally be expressed with some
allusion to these members. Accordingly, <HI>pedem</HI> vel
<HI>gradum</HI> promovere, inferre, referre, flectere, sistere,
premere, and many like expressions, are frequent∣ly
met with. We read too of the swift-<HI>footed</HI> A∣chilles;
of pilgrims requesting the stranger to di∣rect
their <HI>feet</HI> in peace; and of fairies, who “<HI>foot
it</HI> featly, ranged in ringlets gay.” Now to any
common observer it must be obvious, that <HI>crus</HI> in∣ferre,
promovere, sistere, would be uncouth Latin;
as the swift-<HI>legged</HI> Achilles would seem vulgar in
English; or a pilgrim requesting that his <HI>legs</HI> might
be directed in peace; or fairies, who should be
said to <HI>leg it</HI> featly. It is true, that in some as∣semblies
famous for eloquence, the members are
often said to be on their <HI>legs,</HI> but never on their
<HI>feet:</HI> but that phrase I take to be figurative; though
I own, that to express the act of speaking by an
allusion to the legs is not less incongruous, than
to signify that of walking, dancing, or hopping,
<PB N="313" REF="305"/>
by an allusion to the tongue. But to return from
this digression.</P>
<P>IT seems to follow, from what has been said,
that motions of the body are commonly and na∣turally
characterised by motions of the feet. Now
motions of the feet are in like manner characteriz∣ed
by the toes and the heel. For, to advance the
foot, to turn away the foot, pedem inferre, amo∣vere,
are motions merely relative, and connected
with the position of some external object: when
the foot is advanced towards one quarter, it is re∣moved
from the quarter opposite. To distinguish
motion accurately and absolutely, we must there∣fore
observe the position of the foot itself; as that
is indicated by the direction of its two extremities,
the heel and toes.</P>
<P>IF all this be granted, and granted all this must
be; if in speaking of the flight of an enemy we
scruple not to affirm that he showed a clean pair
of <HI>heels;</HI> if a sidelong motion is so denominated,
because it is a motion towards the <HI>side;</HI> if a man
is said to move backwards, because he moves in
the direction of the <HI>back;</HI> surely, it must be ra∣tional
and analogical to infer, that he is said to ad∣vance
<PB N="314" REF="306"/>
<HI>towards,</HI> or (as it should be written) <HI>toewards,</HI>
an object, who advances in the direction of the
<HI>toe.</HI> And, as our prepositions <HI>to</HI> and <HI>towards</HI> are
undoubtedly of the same original, can it be doubt∣ed,
that from the substantive <HI>toe</HI> the preposition <HI>to</HI>
is derived? I will not insult the good sense and
erudition of my reader, by supposing that this can
seem any longer uncertain; nor need I give addi∣tional
evidence of a point which is already esta∣blished
incontestably.</P>
<P>PERMIT me however to remark, before I leave
this delightful subject, that the Latin <HI>versus,</HI> signi∣fying
<HI>towards,</HI> is the same word with <HI>versus</HI> the
noun, which denotes an assemblage of poetical
feet. This proves, that the motion signified by
<HI>versus</HI> is connected with <HI>feet:</HI> nor is this at all in∣consistent
with what I formerly remarked concern∣ing
the connection of feet, or sermo pedestris, or
prose, with the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (pros) whose meaning
corresponds so nearly with that of the Latin <HI>ver∣sus.</HI></P>
<P>IF these reflections, by opening new sources of
grammatical discovery, shall reclaim the studious
from experiment to science, my midnight oil has
<PB N="315" REF="307"/>
not burned in vain, and my gray hairs will go
down to the grave with honour. Horace affec∣tionately
compares the words of a language to ci∣tizens
in a state; likening to the censor who dis∣graces
a citizen the critick who degrades a word.
How shall we answer to our conscience and coun∣try,
if we suffer not one word only, but the whole
grammatical commonwealth, to incur the danger
of degradation, while we are establishing (risum
teneatis amici?) the specifick differences of weeds
and vermin, or anatomising the viscera of a cater∣pillar!
We have received from our forefathers a
government stored with the treasures of legislative
wisdom, and a language rich in the wealth of ge∣nuine
science: both it behoves us to watch with
vigilance, and to protect with vigour. Man, who
is a being active and protect with vigour. Man, who
is a being active and intelligent, requires freedom,
that he may act, and opportunity, that he may
learn: and they who despise etymology the repo∣sitory
of science, and they who contemn law the
guardian of liberty, deserve alike the punishment
of traitors.</P>

<HEAD>A FAREWELL LECTURE.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Delivered in Marischal College, at the commencement of the Vacation, 1 April 1789; when the students of Moral Philosophy, assembled for the last time, were about to leave the University. This is given, rather as an indication of the Author's piety, than as a specimen of his style. The composition of this address is so∣lemn, and apparently, in several parts, elaborate. That of his or∣dinary prelections had more vivacity, and was more simple; and, where the subject would permit, abounded in that pleasantry, which was natural to him, and well calculated for amusing his young heares, and securing their attention.—The lectures, which he had resolved to <HI>write</HI> on Moral Philosophy and Logick, would, if he had lived to execute his plan, have amounted to about one hundred and twenty; six of which he meant to have delivered e∣very week during the term, or session, of College. Ten or twelve only have been found in his hand writing; and some of these are unfinished. See the Preface, page 27.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>TIME, who, in concluding the successive pe∣riods
and pursuits of our lives, is perpetually re∣minding
us, that life and all its pursuits must
<PB N="317" REF="309"/>
yield to him at last, has now brought you to that
boundary, where study must give place to action,
and the nature and importance of the doctrines ye
have received in theory be recollected, and esti∣mated
in their application to practice. The man
must be either very wise or very foolish, to whom,
on such an occasion, a little serious thought can
be either useless or unwelcome. At a station so
important in the journey of life, a prudent man
pauses; to contemplate the wide prospect before
and behind him, and to provide for the future
from his experience of the past. They, who find
room for apprehension or regret, must be willing
to learn, how they may escape the expected evil,
or repair the negligence they repent of; while he,
whose pursuits have been successful, and whose
hopes are flattering, will consider with pleasure
how that success may be continued, and those hopes
realized. Suffer me then to give you, with regard
to your future happiness in life, (I do not say my
<HI>advice,</HI> lest that word should sound harshly from
one, who is perhaps not older than several of
yourselves;)—but suffer me to give you, what
from a person of any age may be heard with pa∣tience,
my opinion, and my reasons for it.</P>
<P><PB N="318" REF="310"/>
In regard to your past conduct and attainments
I need only observe, that, as far as I am connec∣ted
with them, it would be highly unreasonable
to be dissatisfied. You have not all, indeed, equal
learning; but neither can you all have had equal
opportunity to learn: and there is not one among
you, who, if he shall continue the prosecution of
literature, may not with moderate application
make a good appearance. If some of you have less
regularly than others attended the business of the
<HI>class,</HI> it ought to be remembered, that you are not
all equally disengaged from other business. If ever,
during the time of our meeting in this place, there
might have been discovered, by whispers or inat∣tention,
some levity not desirable in a society of
philosophers; my duty must have required me
not to let it pass unnoticed. Such momentary
inadvertence, however, I willingly consider as the ob∣ject
rather of admonition than of reproof. For in the
steadiest minds there is a tendency to ease and relaxa∣tion;
a sort of elastick force which no weight of stu∣dy
can overcome; which impels one from abstract
speculation to natural amusement, seducing often in∣to
thoughtlessness the most willing attention, and
obtruding upon the most guarded seriousness a lu∣dicrous
idea. Such unintentional absence of mind
<PB N="319" REF="311"/>
we cannot call a fault: it is an infirmity indeed,
which we do well to guard against, and discour∣age;
but it is what most men are subject to, and
therefore ought readily to forgive. Scimus, et
hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim.</P>
<P>WE all wish for happiness; and must, conse∣quently,
esteem those pursuits most desirable, in
which we expect to be most happy. This proposition
it is unnecessary to demonstrate; for none is more
agreeable to the reason or to the wishes of man∣kind;
and none is more frequently repeated, or
more zealously descanted upon. And yet no pro∣position
(which may seem strange perhaps, but is
nevertheless true) has been more grosly misapplied.</P>
<P>MEN who seek food and exercise, as the means of
health, have sense enough neither to swallow hem∣lock,
nor to labour in the mines: nor in abstain∣ing
from these are they supposed to manifest any
extraordinary sagacity. Hemlock may indeed be
eaten; yet every person would acknowledge that
man to act absurdly who should use it for food;
since food is sought for the nourishment of the
body, which hemlock would destroy: and al∣though
<PB N="320" REF="312"/>
labour in the mines be undoubtedly exer∣cise,
it is an exercise which, instead of reparing,
wastes the constitution; and which therefore it
would be madness in him to choose, who seeks ex∣ercise
for health's sake only. With such prudence
do men determine, where the senses are concerned,
and the interests of the body.</P>
<P>NOTHING more is requisite to our true felicity,
than that we should, with prudence not inferiour,
determine in cases in which reason directs, and in
which are concerned the eternal interests of the
soul. Nothing more is requisite, than that, in pur∣suing
the means of happiness as of health, we at∣tend
not only to their general appearance, but to
their latent qualities and experienced effects; lest
instead of nourishment we swallow a poison, which
may perhaps increase present pleasure by tempo∣rary
gratification, but which will certainly dimi∣nish
our happiness upon the whole, by disqualify∣ing
us for better enjoyments.</P>
<P>SOME of the more ignorant and sensual Turks,
enamoured of those lethargick reveries which they
<PB N="321" REF="313"/>
derive from opium, are said to acquire in time the
habit of swallowing it in great quantities. This
they accomplish by the constant discipline, or ra∣ther
constant disease, of many weeks; for which
they are rewarded with two or three years of
sleepy delirium, early dotage, and a miserable
death. Now, that they enjoy some momentary
corporeal gratifications more exquisite than those
of men in health, seems very probable: yet who
is so frantick as to believe their condition so good
as that of men in health, even with regard to mere
bodily pleasure?</P>
<P>“BUT does not the person (one might ask)
who has it in his power to derive habitual plea∣sure
from an habitual use of opium, and yet
neglects to use it, omit an opportunity of gra∣tification,
and consequently make his sum of
happiness smaller than it might have been?” It
might be answered, if such a question were thought
worthy of an answer, that the habitual use of this
drug, in exchange for that short and present en∣joyment
which it supplies, prevents greater and
future enjoyments; and therefore diminishes, in∣stead
of increasing, the general sum of happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="314"/>
NEVER, probably, was the question proposed:
yet similar questions, of greater absurdity and
more dangerous consequence, are, tacitly at least,
and in practice if not in words, assented to every
day. “Does not the person, who has it in his
power to derive enjoyment from the present
gratification of covetousness, revenge, or sensu∣ality,
and neglects to do so, omit an opportuni∣ty
of pleasure, and consequently make the sum
of his happiness smaller than it might have
been?” To this question few men perhaps would
give an affirmative answer; yet men surely act as
if they thought it deserved one, who follow cour∣ses,
which, if its doctrine is ill-founded, are hurt∣ful,
not to the happiness of others only, but to
their own. The gratifications proposed in this
question, like those in the former, diminish, in∣stead
of increasing, the general sum of happiness,
by excluding other enjoyments more excellent,
and of longer continuance.</P>
<P>TO us, in short, this is the language of both
reason and revelation:—Ye desire happiness, and
ye do well, since for happiness ye were intended:
be as happy as ye can. Only, for your own sakes,
have prudence enough to believe, that your hap∣piness
<PB N="323" REF="315"/>
will not be consulted in sacrificing a great∣er
to a less enjoyment.</P>
<P>COMPLIANCE with this reasonable admonition
will sometimes indeed require us to abstain from
things apparently desirable: but such abstinence is
unavoidable in this world of probation, where in∣consistent
pleasures are proposed to our choice, for
an exercise to the virtuous, and opportunity to the
wicked. The question is, not whether we shall
give up <HI>any</HI> of the gratifications we are capable
of; for some of them must be given up whatever
course we follow, since it is impossible to enjoy at
the same time things inconsistent with each other:
but the question is, <HI>which</HI> of them shall be given
up; the virtuous, or the vitious, the greater good,
or the less. Shall we lament the hardship of this
sacrifice? As well might a hungry man, who had
either poisoned or wholesome eatables in his choice,
complain, because he could not have the whole∣some,
without abstaining from the poisoned.</P>
<P>BUT a life of virtue, it may be said, demands
painful and perpetual abstinence.—Now if a man's
experience of the matter he decides on, may be
<PB N="324" REF="316"/>
allowed to give weight to his decision, this cavil
can have little authority; having been proposed,
never by a virtuous man, but by those only who,
instead of having experienced a life of virtue, are
devising reasons to excuse themselves from ever
experiencing it. The objection, however, may be
confuted on surer ground than the character of
the objectors. For they, according to the com∣mon
practice of sophistical reasoners, who conceal
one part of a subject in order to give an appear∣ance
of deformity or disproportion to the rest, do
not consider, that, not virtuous action only, but
every sort of human action, requires perpetual ab∣stinence.
Even his daily bread man must procure
in the sweat of his brow; abstaining often from
rest, when weary; from drink, when thirsty;
when warm, from refreshment; from merriment,
when chearful; and, when serious, from contem∣plation.
If the more complex duties, and more
oppressive sorrows, of human life were to be con∣sidered,
we should find ourselves obliged, every
day and every hour, to self-restraint and voluntary
hardship. In this respect, the pleasures of vice re∣quire
as much more hardship as they are less de∣serving
of it. For, not to mention the various
<PB N="325" REF="317"/>
bodily disorders, and consequent serverities of me∣dical
regimen, which from intemperance men of∣ten
suffer, and always have reason to apprehend;
and not to insist on that dreadful expectation of
futurity, from which no vitious man, however he
may dissemble, is entirely free, which haunts him
in solitude, intrudes on him in society, stings his
soul in the midst of pleasure, harasses him in sick∣ness,
and makes death, which Christians approach
as the gate of heaven, appear to him the jaws of
darkness and horror;—not to mention these, vice
suffers, with keenness infinitely superiour to what
virtue does or can do, the pain of abstinence in
regard to those very pleasures which alone it pro∣poses
to enjoy. The desires of the vitious man,
exasperated by gratification and untamed by prin∣ciple;
while yet the terrors of human law, and
some natural sense of decorum, permit him but at
times to comply with them; being far more vio∣lent
than those of the virtuous, are with much
greater difficulty suppressed, while it is also neces∣sary
to suppress them much more frequently; and
each successive gratification, instead of allaying
sensuality, serves only to confirm the habit of it.
Virtue, too, appears with such fearless dignity, as
<PB N="326" REF="318"/>
to command not only the respect of her enemies,
but even their imitation. Men of prosligate cha∣racter
in private life must wear in publick some
externals of decorum; and, if they could be im∣partial,
would feel with how much greater ease
they might avoid their vices than dissemble them,
and acquire the reality of virtue than mimick the
appearance. And if they could experience the
hardships of virtue as well as of vice, they would
be sensible, that to execute one scheme of vitious
pleasure may have cost them, not greater uneasi∣ness
of mind only, but even greater anxiety and
restraint with regard to their darling pursuits, than
might have been necessary in a whole life of rec∣titude.</P>
<P>AND what, after all, are those tremendous hard∣ships
that discourage the commencement or the
continuation of a virtuous life? Are they bodily
pain or ftigue? No: they are, a body strength∣ened
by temperance, and unruffled by passion. Are
they vexation for the past, or dread of the future?
No: they are the remembrance of having acted
well, and the anticipation of heaven. Are they
present sorrow, obscurity, or want? No: they are
a mind possessed of treasures incorruptible; a
<PB N="327" REF="319"/>
mind, which, rejoicing in the good providence of
its Creators, can contemn greatness, and triumph
in affliction. In truth, virtue is not now a thing
which either creates the misfortunes and hardships
of life or annihilates them: it is the way of living
with as little hardship as possible, and as little misfortune.
Virtue, in these lands of religious liber∣ty,
is no system of cumbersome ceremonies, or
austere self-denial: it is but obedience to the will
of God; in other words, it is but the doing of that
which will bring to ourselves and our fellow men
the greatest possible proportion of happiness. Per∣haps
it is a true assertion, though it may appear a
whimsical one, that with less fatigue or restraint,
either of mind or body, than is requisite before
we can learn to read Virgil, we might secure our∣selves
honour in this world and eternal felicity in
the next.</P>
<P>MOST gratefully ought we to acknowledge the
goodness of God, in offeing us slavation on terms
so easy, that, in order to attain our greatest happ∣ness
in heaven, we have only to prefer and pursue
what is in reality our greatest happiness on earth.
Yet, were Christian virtue attended in this life by
hardships infinitely exceeding those that now at∣tend
<PB N="328" REF="320"/>
it, nay, were it one unceasing hardship of both
mind and body, no rational being who sought his
own interest could hesitate a moment in determin∣ing
to practise it, considering the authority by
which it is enjoined, and the everlasting import∣ance
of the sanctions awaiting it hereafter. For
the New Testament not only contains a system of
moral doctrine so pure and perfect, as would de∣serve
the acquiescence of every true philosopher,
even if it had been proposed by no divine autho∣rity,
or connected with no eternal retribution;
but is, moreover, attested by proofs so strong and
so various, that the conversion of those who reject
it could hardly be hoped for, though a messenger
from the dead were commissioned on purpose.
This may seem paradoxical: yet any candid man,
who is acquainted with the history of the Christian
church, may easily convince himself, that it is not
the want of reasonable evidence in our religion
which makes the infidel dislike it, but the want of
licentious doctrine; a want which no messenger
from the dead could be expected to supply. Look
on the conduct and morality of unbelievers.
Where is the man among them, whose virtue has
suggested an improvement to that system which
<PB N="329" REF="321"/>
he renounces as imperfect? Alas! he renounces
it, in order, not to improve his virtue, but to hide
from himself his sins of which it would perpetu∣ally
remind him. Where is the man among them,
who retains in other inquiries that scrupulosity of
logick, which he tortures to perplex the evidence
of the gospel? Alas! the blasphemy of Voltaire
is tried by gentler scrutiny than the doctrine of
Jesus: and at last we learn, that, in opposition to
the cruelty of some interested Jews, the obstinacy
of a few antient believers in magick, the palpable
mistakes and misrepresentations of insidious or ig∣norant
men, the apostacy of a profligate emperor,
the sneer of a petulant Frenchman—the opinions
of the learned avail nothing, nor the practice of
the virtuous, nor the certainty of the inference of
the cause from the effect, nor the faith of nations,
nor the accomplishment of prophecy, nor the de∣monstration
of miracles, nor the blood and testi∣mony
of ten thousand martyrs.</P>
<P>THIS subject needs no further prosecution. If
I were arguing with men prejudiced against vir∣tue
and Christianity, there would now be no time
for confutation; there is now no occasion for it,
<PB N="330" REF="322"/>
while I address myself to those who, having seen
the evidence of the gospel to be stronger than that
of any other antient narrative; having seen, how
much, even in this life, the joys overballance the
difficulties of virtue; and having considered the
value of that everlasting inheritance which God
has prepared for them who love him; will not
hastily give up the conviction of their understand∣ing,
the approbation of their conscience, the esteem
of mankind, the favour of Omnipotence, and the
society of angels and just men made perfect, for
the honour of attending an atheistical sophister in∣to
either that punishment, which he has too much
reason to apprehend, or that annihilation, which
is the last and dearest object of his wishes.</P>
<P>GOD, whose adorable providence supplies each
individual man, nay and even the most diminu∣tive
insect, with some advantages, to make up for
the disadvantages of its condition, afforded to those
primitive Christians, whose faith was to be tried
in persecution and torment, the clear and infalli∣ble
evidence of miracles, wrought often before
their eyes, and often at their command. To us
who, by his goodness, live in days of peace and
<PB N="331" REF="323"/>
liberty, he offers a system of evidence, not, if we
will honestly consider it, less convincing; but
more extensive, and consequently more liable to
be overlooked by the negligent, or misrepresented
by the malicious. The rays of demonstration,
which enlightened those first proselytes to Chris∣tianity,
are, at this interval of time, dispersed,
though not diminished: what shone clear upon
them, from miracles performed in their presence,
we have now to trace and collect through all the
range of history. And although, of a light so
durable and so widely diffused, and in its progress,
through many ages and nations, so often height∣ened
by contrast and multiplied by reflection, the
reality be not now less discernible to candid ob∣servers,
than it was when the beams were more
closely concentered; the splendour is less alluring,
and the quantity will seem less considerable, to
those, who are too indolent to examine all the ex∣panse
which it enlightens, and more willing to be
dazzled by inevitable conviction, than to bear the
fatigue of patient enquiry.</P>
<P>THIS present state of the evidence of our reli∣gion
infidels would fain represent as unsuitable to
the conduct of Divine providence; converting in∣to
<PB N="332" REF="324"/>
an argument against Christianity facts that fur∣nish
no small evidence in its favour. Those infi∣dels,
however, will find it rather difficult to prove,
that God would most effectually have supported
the dignity, by abandoning the justice, of his ad∣ministration;
by giving those primitive Christians
who had so much greater temptation than we have
to do wrong, no more striking encouragement to
do right; or by appointing that inattentive and
worldly-minded men, in these times of religious
tranquillity, should have much encouragement
and an eternal recompence, for believing what it
was impossible for them to doubt. Yet has he,
who makes all things work together for good to
such as diligently seek him, perpetuated to us in
some measure, by means of the very suffering those
first Christians endured, that evidence of miracles
which convinced and supported them: and al∣though,
from the circumstances of the time, we
cannot share with them in the blessing bestowed
on such as forsake house or friends or life for
the gospel; we may partake, in a blessing which
they enjoy not,—the blessing “of those who have
not seen, and yet have believed.”</P>
<P>AFTER these remarks on the practice of virtue
as indispensable to happiness, allow me to mention
<PB N="333" REF="325"/>
a study indispensable to the knowledge of virtue;
I mean the study of the Scripture. This I seek
not to enforce by argument: for on those it needs
not be enforced who propose to dedicate their time
to theology; and men of other professions are be∣yond
the reach of argument, if they think it un∣reasonable
that, after a day spent in advancing
their temporal interest, and studying the inclina∣tions
of man, some minutes should be given to the
law of God, and the interests of eternity.</P>
<P>“BUT is not the study of Scripture a dry occu∣pation,
requiring much toil of criticism, and fre∣quent
search of commentators?” If dryness in
composition be the opposite of what is brief, ele∣gant,
interesting, and momentous, the study of
Scripture will be acknowledged, by all who are in
any degree conversant in it, to deserve as little to
be called dry, as any science whatever. With re∣gard
to the authority of criticisms and comments;
as far as they serve to make us better acquainted
with the gospel, either by remarks on the language
in which it is written, or by gathering into one
view all the passages connected with each particu∣lar
doctrine, so far they are useful in directing, or
<PB N="334" REF="326"/>
abridging at least, the labours of the student.
But further than this it may be dangerous to trust
them; and even without trusting them thus far
we may learn with certainty all the doctrines es∣sential
to salvation. So little is labour of criticism,
or frequent search of commentators, necessary for
the serious Christian, or even expedient. Let the
interpreter assist, but never command our con∣sciences.
It would be hard indeed if Protestants,
who have broken the fetters of a whole infallible
church, should submit in voluntary bondage to
any one infallible churchman.</P>
<P>THE study of the Scriptures is useful, not merely
as the safest means of learning their doctrine; it
will furnish also no inconsiderable evidence of their
truth. I do not allude solely to the purity of their
precepts as supplying a proof of their divine ori∣ginal;
or to the simplicity and candour of the nar∣rative
so remote from the caution and subterfuges
of imposture. But I mean that, supposing a sys∣tem
of doctrine to be contrived by impostors ever
so skilful; (and that the first christians were un∣skilled
in imposition no infidel would require us
to grant); such a system not only <HI>would probably</HI>
contain some things <HI>dissimilar</HI> to what we find in
<PB N="335" REF="327"/>
the New Testament, but <HI>must necessarily</HI> contain
many things altogether incompatible with it. For
impostors, not having (as every infidel supposes
that the first christians had not) any view of ad∣vantage
from a future life, must have had some
hope from the present: all which hope, in the first
preachers of the Gospel, their writings, instead of
tending by any means to countenance, tend di∣rectly
to counteract and overthrow; as every can∣did
reader of the New Testament will see with
evidence incontrovertible. Did St. Paul, for ex∣ample,
wish to acquire, among those of Corinth
whom he converted, reverence and authority suit∣ed
to advance his own temporal power and plea∣sure?
That person will hardly think he did, who
reads, in the epistles to the Corinthians, the fol∣lowing
and many similar passages: “While one
among you saith, I am of Paul, or I of Apollos,
are ye not carnal? I have planted, Apollos wa∣tered,
but God gave the increase. So then nei∣ther
is he that planteth any thing, nor he that
watereth, but God.” I. 3. “The Lord hath or∣dained,
that they which preach the gospel should
live by the gospel. But I have used none of those
things. Neither have I written these things, that it
<PB N="336" REF="328"/>
should be so done unto me. For, though I preach
the gospel, I have nothing to glory of; yea, woe is
unto me, if I preach not the gospel. But I keep
under my body, and bring it into subjection,
lest that by any means, when I have preached
to others, I myself should be a cast-away.” I. 9.
“I am the least of all the apostles, that am not
worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecu∣ted
the church of God.” I. 15. “We preach not
ourselves but Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your
servants for Jesus's sake: for God, who com∣manded
the light to shine out of darkness, hath
shined in our hearts.” II. 4. Even when com∣pelled,
by the misrepresentations of enemies, he
reminds the Corinthian church of the miracles he
had performed, and claims their respect to the dig∣nity
of the commission he bore, he immediately
subjoins, “I speak as a fool; I am become a fool
in glorying. If I must needs glory, I will ra∣ther
glory in my infirmities, that the power of
Christ may rest upon me.” II. 11. 12. These
passages are mentioned, merely as a specimen of
that evidence for the truth of Scripture, which
may be found in the bare language of Scripture
itself. I am far from wishing to represent them
<PB N="337" REF="329"/>
as the most striking that might be chosen, or as
containing any considerable part of the evidence
alluded to; which indeed cannot with justice be
either attacked or supported from the quotation
of a few apserate sentences; and whose full force
is only to be estimated from an attentive perusal
of the whole New Testament.</P>
<P>THUS far, as it is impossible even to conjecture,
in what circumstances we may hereafter be placed,
and, consequently, what particulars of conduct,
under those circumstances, may most effectually
promote our interest, I have mentioned some few
of the many motives inclining us to that, which
in all possible circumstances will direct and sup∣port
us—VIRTUE. Of virtue the rewards are in∣valuable
and eternal; the hardships have been
dreaded by those who had never experienced them,
but by no virtuous man were ever complained of.
From heaven and futurity Virtue has much to
hope, and can fear nothing. From our fellow men,
even from the most profligate, it will gain us re∣spect
and confidence. And as to the restraints it
imposes in regard to self-government, their ad∣vantage,
when compared with those unavoidable
<PB N="338" REF="330"/>
in the pursuits of the wicked, is too manifest to be
disputed by any, except by men who wish, not to
know how they may do right; but to contrive
excuses for what they will do wrong.</P>
<P>THOUGH our religion fails not to remind us,
that we have a soul to save, as well as a body to
provide for; in warning us to regard the interests
of our future state, it is far from encouraging us
to neglect those of the present, On the contrary,
no other system has represented the present life as
a state of such real and serious importance. No
other has pronounced more explicitly, that unless
a man will work, neither should he eat. And,
though it declares, without flattery or reserve, the
danger of those temptations that attend the rich
and the powerful; no other system has pointed
out more rational means of enjoying wealth, or
nobler objects even of worldly ambition. True
indeed, since every state in which the Christian
can live has its advantages, and is also permitted
by the providence of God, contentment in every
state is recommended by religion, as well as by
prudence. Let our condition be ever so bad, it
has still the less need of discontent to make it
<PB N="339" REF="331"/>
worse. But we must not imagine, that content∣ment
ought to hinder us from endeavouring to
make it better. If we disdain to profit by one fair
opportunity of benefiting ourselves or others, such
conduct is not religion, but superstition or indo∣lence.
Heaven is to be won, not by whining
theology, but by practising virtue: nor shall we,
by secresy and sloth but by active opposition, es∣cape
that adversary, who must be resisted before
he will flee from us, and who has visited not more
frequently the lazy ingnorance of savage life, than
the devout lethargy of the cloister. As the body
without the soul is dead, faith without works is
dead also. For the amendment of past errors, and
the regulation of future practice, our times of se∣rious
meditation ought to be frequent; but let us
not think it necessary to make them perpetual or
laborious. While with honest industry we con∣duct
our business in life, grateful to God and hum∣bly
trusting in his mercy, we worship with the
most acceptable service that Gracious Being, who
gave us knowledge but as an instrument of action;
who is well pleased to see his creatures promote
the comfort of that nature he has given them, by
a rational use of those benefits he has provided;
<PB N="340" REF="332"/>
and who has promised the joys of his eternal king∣dom,
not to men of ostentatious sancitity, but to
such as walk in truth and righteousness, fearing
God, and loving one another.</P>
