<HEAD>The PREFACE To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS</HI> the <HI>Faults on Both Sides</HI> have given a gene∣ral Satisfaction to Impartial Men, and such as wish well to their Native Country; so I doubt not but the Method which is taken in this Treatise, will be as Acceptable: The <HI>Author</HI> has no Design but to lay the Faults where they ought to be, and Honestly to shew which of the Contending Parties are the best Friends to our <HI>Constitution</HI>, and are <HI>like to prove the best Subjects</HI> to Her Majesty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reader</HI> will here find a True and Compleat HI∣STORY of the Proceedings of <HI>a Party</HI> ever-since the <HI>Revolution;</HI> and may see how far the late <HI>House of Commons</HI> were in the Right, in their Proceedings a∣gainst Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>. I shall not pay much time in Prefacing, but rather refer the <HI>Reader</HI> to the Book it self; which, I doubt not, if he be an Impartial One, will give him satisfaction, by shewing him what Methods have been taken <HI>by a Party of Men</HI> amongst Us, to <HI>Ruin our Constitution:</HI> And how far it may be Con∣venient to Trust Them again.</P>

<HEAD>THE States-Man out of Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE World has been told, That the <HI>Whiggs</HI> are very much Baulk'd, hand∣somely Banter'd, and wittily Expos'd, in a late Book, Entituled, <HI>Sir Thomas Double at Court</HI>, &amp;c. The first Jest in the Account is, <HI>That Nobody ever told them so but the</HI> Author; and most Men that have Charity for the Author, say, <HI>When he told us so, he did not believe it himself</HI>.</P>
<P>Two Gentlemen meeting over a Bottle, and reading this Book, found the Ma∣lice run so high, and the Wit run so low, that it mov'd them to enter a little into Discourse upon the same Subjects. The Amusement and Suggestions, which, tho' unprov'd in the least, the Author would have call'd Satyr, were so gross, that at first they began to be surfei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with the Thoughts of running through the whole Rapsody; but recollecting themselves, they concluded that they would enter by way of Conference upon the subject of the late management and turns in the State, and perhaps, by Discoursing these things freely, in which they were both through∣ly verst by their long experience, they might better clear up to one another the true state of our Case in this Nation, and expose the Malicious Suggestions of the pretended Dialogues, than by entring into a party, or by taking any of the Redi∣culous Schemes, mention'd therein, to pieces by themselves.</P>
<P>We shall bring our Two Gentlemen to speak directly to Things, without spen∣ding Eleven or Twelve Pages about Introductions to Discourse, and saying some∣thing or other which signifies nothing, of their Grand-Fathers, their Great Estates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cousin <HI>Turn-Round</HI>, How do you do? I am very glad to see you▪ I find you are a Brother of Affliction, I hear you are out too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It's very true, I had my dismiss this Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It's the more surprizing to the Town, because we all kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w you were come into the New Court Measures: Indeed it is not strange to me; for I always believed you had Turn'd against your sedatest Thoughts, and that, when your Judg∣ment return'd upon you, it would bring you round again to your old Honest Par∣ty, who you were at first so Zealous for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I did at first go in with them they made their Pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nces so spe∣cious, and talk'd so se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mingly sincerely, that I really thought they would Act like Men of Temper and Moderation, and that they only sought to rectify some exhor∣bitances, which, indeed, I was as uneasie at as other People: But now, I think I find what they drive at; that the old Game is to be Reviv'd; that the Q——n is but to Change her Rulers, as they call 'em, not at all to be more at Liberty, and I doubt in the end, she will be either Abandon'd or given Up: And th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things have opened my Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad your Eyes are open; and I doubt not but in time, the Eyes of all the People in <HI>England</HI>, a few who are wilfully blind only excepted, will be open'd, and when this Illumination happens, these People will have reason to look about them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I hope you will use me gently, I have been a <HI>Tory</HI> but a little while, I may live to attone for the Excursion, by exposing the Villainous part I see they are acting, for a fair Warning to others, that they be not deluded or seduced, Penitents are always an Advantage to the Church, and should be receiv'd kindly, you know <HI>there is more Joy in Heaven</HI>, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are to be the more valued, because you come off from them upon meer Conviction, when you might have made your Fortune with them; you can have no motives to come Round to us, just now; we have no Places to give, no Honours to confer, no Encouragements for a False Brother among them to betray them to us; yours must be the meer strength of Reason and Conviction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly I am not studdying my Interests in it, that's Confest; but to tell you the truth, I see so much Mischief in their Design, so much Tricking, Sharping and Cheating in their Methods, and such sharing the Spoil before they have gotten the Victory; that it fill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d me with an Aversion to the baseness of the whole.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt you might have had your Share among them too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They have not been wanting to make me very good Offers, besides what I enjoy'd among them before; but it would not do: I must own I look'd upon my self as a Traytor to my Country, all that little while I was among them, that was selling Her to the Enemy, only to get a little share in the Purchase Money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I make no question they have made you good Offers, and are doubtless at a great loss for want of you: I know they valued themselves mightily upon you when they began to make their new appearance; They knew the Interest you have in your Country was great, and however, perhaps, they might let you into as few of their Secrets as they cou'd, being willing not to shock that Principle they knew well e∣nough you acted from, yet they knew how fatal it wou'd one time or other be to have you against them; therefore I do not wonder, that they endeavour'd all they could to engage you to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Truely they took some low steps that way, and such as I thought they would hardly have stoop'd to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot conceive what they could offer you; for as you possest already one of the best Posts in the Kingdom, it was not in their Power to do much more for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are greatly Mistaken, there are new Methods of making a Man's Fortun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> besides Places; but I am not about to turn Evidence against them, let them alone they will entangle themselves when they get a little further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I ask your Pardon, I was not sifting, nor am I curio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to look into the Se∣cret part of this new Management; I have seen so much of the Introduction, that I need not look into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of the Book: But one thing you may give me leave to ask of you, Pray, How did you come to shew your Alienation to them? tho' if there be any secret in it, pray pardon the Question, and leave me without an An∣swer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No Secret in it at all, I'll be as plain in my Answer to you, as <HI>I</HI> was in the Thing it self to them; When first they propos'd to me the changing Hands; I confess the Pretences were plausible, and I readily enough came in to them; I had seen some People Uneasie, the Ministry, we thought, engross'd the Management too much; treated all that attempted to act upon the least differing point from them, with too much severity; shar'd with too much eagerness and app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite, the Profits of Pla∣ces,
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
and the Preferments of the Nation. I had been formerly concern'd, when those we call'd the Juncto or <HI>Whig</HI> Lords, were of the same Opinion, and found the Mini∣stry were satisfy'd the Pretence was so Just, that they opened to them and took them in; but I found still this Opening took in but a few; who being as it were, satis∣fy'd for themselves, abandoned the Popular Part of their Pretensions, and left their Friends to shift: These and some other Considerations, which I shall hint at by and by, made me think a Change was not in the least Inconvenient, and far from being Dangerous; and this enclin'd me to Joyn: <HI>But then</HI>, you are to take it with you as we go, this Inclination was always encourag'd and supported by their constant Declarations of setting up a Moderate Management, a middle way, by which the fears and apprehensions of the Nation should be Removed; That they would single out the Men of Temper and Judgment, without Distinction of Parties; That the best Men of every Party should be employ'd; That the hot ungovern'd Spirits that had so near ruin'd us before should not appear again, or meet with the least coun∣tenance; That the Queen being left Perfectly free, and unbesieg'd by Parties, would extend Her Favours were Merit recommended, without Respect to the Byass of this or that Interest; That none should be brought in but what would give Assurances of acting with a perfect indifferency to all Parties, and Pursue the Publick Service with all possible Moderation.</P>
<P>These were the Amusements by which I was drawn in to joyn with the Party, and particularly in the first Removes that were made; and I cannot deny but my ac∣quiescing might encourage them to think their Game sure, and from that Confidence to thro' off the Mask sooner than they otherwise would have done: for the Integri∣ty of Mens Designs is always discover'd when they fancy themselves past Danger of a Disaster in the making them Publick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your Account of these things is surprizing, and the more so, when you accknowledge you believ'd them: Did ever One Man but you believe they could act Moderately in any thing? It may be in their Politicks to contrive a Moderate Ma∣nagement, and I believe — who governs them in the Schemes of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things might propose it; for he knows no other Method can draw in the Nation: But it is no more in their Power than it is to pull the Stars out of Heaven! A <HI>Tory</HI> can no more be a Moderate Manager, than the Elements can cease to put forth their com∣pleat Vigour when left to Nature and freed from Constraint. Every thing in Na∣ture acts its utmost Power: Fire cannot Burn moderately, or Water Flow mode∣rately, neither can a <HI>Tory</HI> Govern moderately; he may pretend to what he will, but it is not in his Nature: His Blood Boyls too Hot; his Circulations are too Rapi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ in Religion he must Persecute, in Government he must Oppress, in Office he must Insult; in Power he must Plunder and Destroy; 'tis the Nature of a High <HI>Tory</HI>, and it cannot be otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I was formerly of that Opinion, and begin to be so again; but the Protestations of this Party were such as would have Deceived <HI>the very Elect</HI>, and I was the easier brought to be Credulous in this Case, because some of them were the very Men, that to my Knowlege, were formerly the Instruments to De∣pose the Rash Party we now call <HI>High Men</HI>, when they had the publick Affairs in their Hands, and turn'd them out with all imaginable Contempt, as Men that were pushing us upon Rocks and Precipices, and that by the Fire of their Party would Destroy us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and when did you come to eclairicisment in this Affair? for I find you discover'd them very early, considering you as one that did not suspect them▪ for me, indeed, I always believ'd them what we all find them to be, and therefore it is no wonder to find me, and such as I am, before you in our Measures: But for
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>
you that were perswaded of their Sincerity, it is very strange, and no less happy, that you should see into them so soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, they had no sooner struck the Blow, but like <HI>Caesar</HI> when he past the <HI>Rubican</HI>, they threw off the Mask, and as he discover'd plainly that he aim'd at the Empire, so I thought they discover'd themselves to be inclining for a High Ma∣nagement, AS SUCH, that they were already link'd in with the whole Party, that <HI>One</HI> and <HI>All</HI> was the Word among them, and they had resolv'd to borrow an Old Party Motto in their Dealings with the <HI>Whiggs, (viz.) Root</HI> and <HI>Branch</HI>: In pur∣suance of this their Genuine Design, the void Places were immediately fill'd, as fast as they could clear the way, with the very Men they had protested against by Name, such as <HI>B. S.</HI> and <HI>R. S. S. J.</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>Then it was I took the freedom to expostulate with them in plain Terms, and told them, This was not agreeable to the Schemes proposed; That they were not going the way to a Moderate Management; That this was putting all things into the Hands of the High Party. That this Party were the declared Enemies of the Settle∣ment, and had openly <HI>wash'd their Hands of the Revolution</HI>: I told them plainly I must leave them, and every Man that wish'd well to the Nation must leave them; That this was to bring the profess'd Enemies of the Revolution upon us, and on pre∣tence of delivering us from the Influence of one Party, this was delivering us up to a∣nother Party, of whose Temper and Prudence the Nation had already had too much Experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This was very Plain and Honest; Pray, How did they bear it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They bore it calmly; for I express'd my self with Respect: But they told me for Answer, That these Men had born their share in the Opposition of the Ministry, and had stood fast to them in bringing the New Change to pass; that they could not Abandon them entirely, but would bring as few of them in as possible; and those that were brought in had given their Words to act with a differing Spirit, and to put on all the Temper and Calmness imaginable, especially while the other Party carry'd it with any Common Respect. I told them, I was sorry to see they should go from their most solemn▪ and early Engagements, and that for the Paroll those People had given, I had a very mean Opinion of it, from experience I had of their antient Conduct; and that I expected nothing could Succeed in their Hands after such a step as this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In this you acted with a great deal of Candour and Honesty, and I make no doubt, but this plainness rendred you uneasie to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I never spar'd them upon all Occasions, and being so constant in these Expostulations, <HI>I</HI> found they quickly grew uneasie; I shewed always as much Un∣easiness as they, and told them often, I should be thankful to them, if they would please to give me the <HI>Coup de Grace</HI> and let me go; which at last they have done, and now I come among my Friends again. The little time <HI>I</HI> have been absent, has let me into the Secrets of the Society, and <HI>I</HI> regret the Time <HI>I</HI> have lost among them very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You are very well come to your self again <HI>I</HI> doubt not, and <HI>I</HI> am sure you are so to your Friends; for <HI>I</HI> know no Man among them, we regretted the loss of to much as of your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But methinks <HI>I</HI> look like a Turn-Coat, like a Renega<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, my Cloaths smells of the Sulphur, and the Language sounds still in my Ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> confess <HI>I</HI> have an Aversion to Turning of all kinds; but of all those that Turn, they only are happy who turn <HI>Quite Round</HI>; for, tho' at first they may be a little deluded, when they come to be illuminated, and to see the Mistake, they Turn on, and come about where they began. Such always embrace the Truth with more Constancy and Steddyness than other People, and <HI>I</HI> doubt not you will do so too, and therefore <HI>I</HI> Congratulate our Interest upon your Return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There are many more will take the same Measures, or <HI>I</HI> am very much mistaken; for <HI>I</HI> am very well satisfy'd, they are at this time made up of such a Mix∣ture, that they cannot go on far together: Nay, <HI>I</HI> am verily persuaded, that even Mr. — himself, cannot go the Length, that these People expect from him, but that in a little while you will see, that either they will break off from Him, or He from Them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> find you have a good Opinion of Mr. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> have not a good Opinion in the least of the Measures he is now taking, but <HI>I</HI> own I have not such Thoughts of him in the main as others have; <HI>I</HI> am very desirous to believe, that however he may act in the Dark at present, he has not the Pretender in his View, he cannot have the Subversion of the Constitution in his De∣sign: <HI>I</HI> think so, you will excuse my Charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For my part <HI>I</HI> differ from you extremely; <HI>I</HI> neither like the Measures <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is now taking, or the Measures he ever took: <HI>He is no Kin to me: I</HI> thank God, <HI>I</HI> am of the Family of the <HI>Steddy's</HI>, and <HI>I</HI> think he is not the least Related to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn-Round.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I know not whether be may be of your Branch▪ but I think he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Steddy <HI>too, and that in particular to his own Interest; I am perswaded this is what he is chiefly pursuing: He would have pursu'd his Interest and our Cause together but you threw him off, and he went away to those People; and I am perswaded he is only serving his Interest of them, and they understand him so, for they are serving their Interest of him: You will see this in the Consequence; as soon as ever these Interests are served either on one Hand or other, you will find the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'ll break, and then we shall have him again</HI>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not I! never have him again! N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, we have done with him; we took a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r leave of him, he may even stay where he is with his new Friends, <HI>Steddy</HI> is the Word, we'll never have more to do with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn-Round.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay, there you must pardon me for saying you are in the Wrong; I wish he were as heartily with us again, as he was once, I should think it a good step to throw out all this</HI> Tory <HI>Management again, and restore us all to our Primitive State</HI>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> never believed he was hearty with us, or that he ever will; and should he come over with never so much Sincerity, <HI>I</HI> doubt <HI>I</HI> should never believe him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn-Round.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>In this you shook my Opinion of your own Sincerity to me, for by the same Rule you may not believe me Honest, who am return'd to you, since I have confest to you that I have been in the Interest of the same Party.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have not given so many Proofs of Unsteddiness, as I think he has done, nor can you have the same Prospects: Do you remember when he was with us, how near he was to have supplanted the Ministry, and delivered us to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Party he has now brought in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn-Round.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why truly, as to the Design then, I have heard a great deal of it, tho, I never was convinc'd that he had design'd half that was suggested. But suppose it all true I cannot but think they treat him impolitickly; for had they used him Tenderly, removed him Decently, and acted calmly, he might ha'been fix'd in Circumstances▪ which would have been his interest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have sat down with; but they cast him off with all the Ignominy and Contempt possible, as you dash a piece of Chiney against a Hearth, never to be see together a∣gain. This was declaring War with him, and setting him at open Defiance; and</HI> I <HI>could not blame him so much for attempting to restore himself at the Expence of those that had ruin'd him; all</HI> I <HI>reflect upon him for, is, in going over to a Party which</HI>, I <HI>believe, he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not very well satisfied with: This, however politick it may seem, is like</HI> Acher<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nta Move∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>that he resolved to carry on his Resentment, tho' he call'd in such Auxilliaries as he did not approve of</HI>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think they could do no otherwise than they did, and that he had treated them in a manner which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them to the utmost Resentment; but we will not

Dispute that Part. You see the Measures taken now, and what a Party is brought in upon us, What can we expect from them? It cannot but fill you with Indigna∣tion and Regret, to see a Party let in, who have more than once told us what we are to expect from them. <HI>I</HI> cannot but wonder what, the Gentlemen who are now shaking Hands with <HI>High-Flyers</HI>, and <HI>Jacobites</HI>, who they have so many years ap∣peared against; can think of themselves. O <HI>Steddy! Steddy</HI>! If my Grandfather Sir <HI>Anthony Steddy</HI>, and his Hundred Sons were alive now, these People durst not act so; but our Family is very much declined, and a great many of my Great Relations are dead, King <HI>James</HI> cut off some of them, as WILLIAM LORD RUSSEL-STEDDY, ARTHUR EARL OF ESSEX-STEDDY, ALGERNON SIDNEY-STEDDY, and the like; these were Relations of mine, which if they had been alive now, these People could never have come in thus upon us; but they are gone, and there are few of the Name now in being.</P>

<P>I <HI>know yours has been a flourishing Family, and I am of Opinion, you will rise again, for there are several of your Relations that are at present deluded and de∣ceiv'd, and are turn'd to these People; but when they come to see what they are all going to do, they'll turn quite round, come over again to the</HI> Steddy's, <HI>and offer themselves to match into your Family, and you will presently grow formidable again; for they will be all</HI> Sted∣dys <HI>when they come again</HI>.</P>

<P>If you had been Master of the Mystery of iniquity, which has been car∣ried on by a Wicked Party of Men for these Twenty Years last past, you would be as positive as I; and I think it might not be amiss, in order to understand this Party perfectly, to go back into the secret History of the Parties which have struggled so long, and with such Animosity in these Kingdoms, and which have brought Mat∣ters between them to such a height, that the Breach seems impracticable to be heal∣ed and made up.</P>

<P>I <HI>should be very glad to enter into the whole Story with you</HI>; I <HI>believe it is the only way to come to true Notions of these things, and may serve as the best Answer to all the Cavils and Objections that are made against us; for the Judgment is nothing so much impos'd upon as in these State Matters, when they are set in a wrong Light</HI>.</P>

<P>We must go back for this purpose to the Revolution; but need make but light touches at things in the Beginning of King <HI>William</HI>'s Reign.</P>
<P>It was a natural Consequence, that a Revolution of such a Magnitude, so wonderful in its Beginning, so surprizing in its Success, and so effectual in all its Parts, should leave a Party that would stand out and oppose the Settlement of things on the new Foot.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> was not so ill beloved but he left some behind that adhered to his in∣terest; to these, as to <HI>David</HI> at <HI>Hackelah</HI>, all that were discontent, or uneasy at any thing joyn'd themselves. The making the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> King disgusted many; the entire suppression of Tyranny disobliged others; and the several Parties applied themselves to their respective Methods to shew their dislike of things.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="9"/>To suppress those growing Parties, several Parliamentary methods were taken, such as double Taxes Oaths, Abjurations, Associations, Recognitions and the like.</P>
<P>Some took the Oaths, others refused them, and paid whatever was assessed upon them for that Deficiency; <HI>but it is observed</HI>, those that took the Oaths, were the most troublesome Enemies the Government had and the fastest Friends to the Pretender.</P>
<P>On all Occasions these people have perplext and haras'd the Government ever since, and that several ways: Nothing has at any time offer'd to the Advantage of the Establish'd Government, whether in Parliament or out, but these have been the opposers of it; no management has ever pleased them, <HI>or ever will</HI>, except such as will please no man else, <HI>I mean their own</HI>; they have appear'd on every occasion against every thing that has tended to our former Establishment, and have esp used every thing that has in the least perplexed us.</P>
<P>The Protestant Succession has been push'd in their very Teeth, and the Union was carry'd over the Belly's of their Mobb; when they were in, they brought things to the utmost Disorder; and now they have been out, they choose rather to hazard the whole Cause than not put us all in Confusion: They have visibly all along push'd on the Interest of the Pretender, tho' they have Abjur'd him, they have discover'd by in∣numerable Circumstances what they aim at, and that they will stick at nothing to bring it to pass.</P>

<P>I do not think they do; but 'tis evident they have all along been joyn'd by the party which are apparently in that Interest; in which they discover, that if they cannot bring about their Designs without it, <HI>as some say</HI>, they would not stick to come into it; tho' I rather believe, that they are as much Enemies to a Restoration, as the party that espouse them are Friends to it.</P>

<P>As soon as King <HI>William</HI> was establish'd on the Throne, this Party set them∣selves with all their might to Counter-Act him in every thing; The Brigues with which they continually embarast his Affairs, made every thing heavy to him, and made his Difficulties double upon him. They had with their utmost skill oppos'd his being placed on the Throne, and their Friends were the first that protested against it on one hand, and voted against it on the other, whenever they had opportunity, but the King's Merit, and the nearness of the Danger, were too n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w to be Resisted; the Torrent of the peoples Inclinations was not to be resisted; and here began our Protestant Settlement.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That was the mildness of his Temper, willing to win and engage them, and was the only inconvenience we found to his not being a Native of <HI>England</HI>: He thought they might have been won by a gentle and obliging Treatment; and above all, he thought that to put himself upon them, was such a Confidence, as must have enga∣ged them in Monour, and have made them his own: But he did not know them.</P>

<P>I never fail'd to do it as opportunity offer'd, but the King could not be brought for a long time to suspect them; and after he did suspect them, He was soth to use them as they Deserved: He thought it was not a time for it.</P>

<P>Having goten into the Management, they put a Face of Zeal on the outside of this Actions, but secretly they kept every thing backward; Disappointed every good Design; Betray'd every Secret; and employ'd Engines about, to Countermine the very projects of their own Contriving.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Dr. Double</HI> known any thing of the History of that time, he would have known, that these were the Men who delay'd the Treaty with <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>, when he had made a kind of proposal to come in; and got a Traytor to be sent over to him, on pretence of making the Treaty, who first encouraged him to go back from his de∣signs, adhere to Arms and begin the War; and then went over to himself. The As∣surance of the Party is very great that in print lays this to the <HI>Whiggs. vide</HI> Sir <HI>Tho. Double</HI>.</P>
<P>Then they prepare an Army to go for <HI>Ireland</HI>, and put on a mighty face of Zeal for the Relief of <HI>London Derry</HI>; but with Industrious Delays, they kept every thing back so long, that if possible, that little handful of Valiant protestants might be devoured, and <HI>Ireland</HI> be wholly restored to King <HI>James</HI>▪ And 'tis known who Curs'd the Cowardly Behaviour of the <HI>Irish</HI> Generals, that could not take that P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltry Town in so long Time. At last they were forc'd to let it be Reliev'd to pacify the King who was so warm upon it. That he said he could not bear to see his Subjects Sacrificed in that Manner; and, <HI>if no Body could be found would do him such a Service, he would go and Relieve them himself</HI>.</P>
<P>The next thing was sending over the Army with Duke <HI>Schomberg:</HI> Were the black Councils of that matter Ravell'd d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into, doubt the <HI>Tory</HI> party would find more Reason to Blush, than would consist with the Zeal they pretend for the general interest of the Nation; the Troops were ordered to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n camp at <HI>Westchester</HI>, whither the Foot came very slowly, the Horse not at all: The Duke earnest to be in Action came thither himself to hasten the Embarkation, but was oblig'd to wait; the <HI>Dutch</HI> Guards, Six <HI>French</HI> Battali∣ons one <HI>Prussian</HI> Battallion, and Two <HI>English</HI>, made, up the Camp; But with long waiting, Four <HI>English</HI> Regiments Arrived, Two more at <HI>Leverpool</HI>; and the
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
Duke, Resolved to Embark, depending upon the Horse and Dragoons following; He Landed at <HI>Carrickfargus</HI>, took the place; March'd on, took the pass of the Newly, and Encamped in the View of the Enemy at <HI>Duudalk</HI>; and during that whole time, but Two Regiments of the Horse and Three of Dragoons, of the Troops promis'd were sent after him; here for want of troops, but especially Horse that Gallant Army was entire∣ly wasted and lost, and the very people that retarded the Supplies were the for∣wardest to Reproach that General for not Fighting; when it's known he had no Troops to justifie his Advancing, and it was rather a Miracle of his Conduct, that his little Army was not entirely cut in pieces.</P>
<P>His Majesty was so sencible of this, and so Incensed at it, That resolving to go in Person the next year, he would not trust any Body with the Preparations, any more than he would with the Expedition; but caused the accounts of every thing to be laid before him, and order'd the quantity of Stores, the Train, and the Necessaries himself; and, as a Man may say, saw them dispatch'd before he went away.</P>
<P>This to the Great Mortification of the Party, put a short end to that work; yet the Tory Party took a great many steps to retrieve Matters there, and to spin out the War to that length, as might prevent the Kings applying himself to the Work in <HI>Flan∣ders</HI>, which his Eye was principally intent upon; in Order to this, the first Siege of <HI>Limeric</HI> was directly delay'd, till it was too late to expect the Reduction of a place so strong; and that Siege effectually broke, by betraying the supply of Cannon and Am∣munition <HI>which was coming to them</HI>, to <HI>Sar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>field</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> General.</P>
<P>At la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Earl of <HI>Athlona</HI> was drawn in to fight the Battle of <HI>Aghrim</HI> at such Disad∣vantages, and with such Superior Forces, that in all probability: our Army had been Defeated, and the War in <HI>Ireland</HI> to do all over again; <HI>But Heaven Interpos'd</HI> the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Troops were put into Confusion by the Death of Monsieur St. <HI>Ruth</HI>, who was giving Orders for pouring in between our Right Wing and Main Battle, by which our Foot had been cut off, and so we gain'd a Victory, which the best Officers we had, thought Impracticable, and the General had Dispair'd of.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="12"/>
<HI>We demanded they should settle the Succession absolutely with us; they said this was a Breach of equality, asserted their Independency, and refused to settle the Succession but up∣on Conditions Our Party industriously enflam'd things. Pamphlets were written here by known hands, all of the Party, to irritate and enflame them, asserting the Debt of Homage due to</HI> England <HI>from</HI> Scotland; <HI>and all possible Methods were used to provoke the</HI> Scots. <HI>They again resolv'd to assert their independency, a Right which</HI> England <HI>does not at all dispute; made their Act of Security; and Voted to put their Kingdom in a posture of Defence: Now the Party thought they had gain'd their point, and had made a War inevitable; upon which, they Voted and carry'd an Act to prevent Dangers arising from the Act if Security: An Act so unjust in its Nature; so Dishonourable to</HI> Scotland; <HI>and so fatal in its Conse∣quences; that the Wiser sort of People discovered the real Design of embroiling us in it; and the next Parliament Repeal'd it</HI>.</P>

<P>Your Account of this is short, but very full; and I crave leave to add, That in this is to be seen the Injustice of those who blame our Ministry, for advi∣sing the Queen to Sign or pass the Act of Security in <HI>Scotland</HI>, as if it were a piece of Treachery to <HI>England</HI>; whereas, first, it was so just an Act to <HI>Scotland</HI>, and at that time so necessary, that as Queen of <HI>Scotland</HI> it could not well be denied; and next, if I am not misinform'd, they had Power by some of their Laws to pass it, without Her Majesty's Assent, if the Council there had consented to it.</P>

The Enemies were always in the Field before us; when we came there, we came Uncloath'd, Unpaid, with empty Magazines, and sometimes without our Train; and thus the King, besides the Enemy, had the insuperable Dif∣ficulties of want of Necessaries to struggle with; which Defeated his Designs, Per∣plext his Mind, and expos'd him to be frequently insulted by the Enemy.</P>

<P>Supposing all they complain of were true, the King is justifiable before God and Man; He that cannot make War, must make Peace; He had been Thir∣teen Years Working in the Fire, fighting without an Army, and his Armies fight∣ing without Pay; and had he made Peace Seven Years before, and let you stay for the Reduction of <HI>France</HI>, till you could find a General that could both Conquer <HI>France</HI> Abroad, and the Obstruction of Parties at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, both together; you could not have blam'd him.</P>

<P>The Objections are trifles, That of Trade only concerns us, in which these People Quarrel that a Tarriff of Trade was not settled in the Treaty, but do not consider that it was our Interest to have no settlement of that Trade made at all; they would have had way made for our Woollen Manufactures into <HI>France</HI>, not considering, for, alas! they know nothing of the Matter, that then we must have opened the Door to the Imports of Wine and Brandy, and Wrought Silks by ta∣king off the high Duties from one, and the Prohibition from the other; which any Man, that knows any thing of Trade, in <HI>England</HI>, must know would be our Ruine. I have heard a Great Man say, when the Question was before the House, Whether the Trade with <HI>France</HI> should be open'd during the War, upon the Petition of the <HI>Virginia</HI> Merchants? That there was Danger, it might be Voted purely for the sake of having Good Claret to Drink. That there are some Men who would not scruple Wounding the General, to save the Particular, is too manifest, but particularly in this Party; their other Objections against the Peace are needless to mention, and are in themselves worth no Notice.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="14"/>It is evident they acted basely, let it be which way it will; for if it was a safe and good Peace, Why do they Reproach the King with it? If, as they say it was, an Un∣settled, Unsafe Peace, and not likely to continue, Why then did they force the King to break the Army and Disband? But this they push'd so fast, and so warmly, as it they were afraid the Necessity of a New War should appear to the Nation, before the Forces were Disbanded.</P>
<P>No sooner was this done, but they fell upon the Treaty of Partition; With what Virulence they fell upon the King, how they call'd it a Fellonious Treaty, and how they push'd at the Person of him who had sign'd it, tho' by his Master's express Com∣mand, need not to be look'd back upon: But this is worth Remark, that after Se∣ven Years War, and a Series of Victory, we were willing enough to make Peace upon the Foot of a Partition, and these Men blame us because we did not do it.</P>

<P>But I remember very well, that Party being then in play, made it ve∣ry doubtful, Whether the War should begin with us, or we begin with it; and the King of <HI>France</HI> play'd his Game so sure Abroad, and so cunningly at Home, that both the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the King too, were driven to the Necessity to Pay their Com∣pliment to the <HI>French</HI>, and in a Feint to acknowledge the New King of <HI>Spain</HI>, tho' at the same time they resolv'd to pull him down.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But to whom was that Necessity owing, was it not to our Party here, who then had the Cards in their Hands, and play'd to one anothers Hand? They amus'd the King so long with Delays and Pretences, that his Majesty knew not, either how to keep the Peace with Honour, or how to begin the War with Safety; mean time the King of <HI>France</HI> press'd the <HI>Dutch</HI>, block'd them up in their Frontier Towns, held their Regiments Prisoners of War, which, by the Treachery of the Duke of <HI>Bava∣ria</HI>, fell into his Hands, in the several Towns of <HI>Flanders</HI>, which that Duke put into the <HI>French</HI> Power all at once. The <HI>Dutch</HI> sent Express after Express, the King represented their Case to the Parliament, yet nothing moved. The stipulated aid of Ten Thousand Men, agreed by the Peace of <HI>Nimuguen</HI> to be lint to the <HI>Dutch</HI> when∣ever the <HI>French</HI> should invade them, was delay'd, till at last an Expostulary Letter from the States being laid by the King before the House, brought on a kind of Ne∣cessity for the sending over that Assistance, and thus we came slowly on.</P>
<P>These things gave the whole Nation so much Uneasiness, that they began to dis∣cover it many ways; but one Intervening Accident alone effected their Illumina∣tion, and effectually unhing'd our Tory Party, and broke all their Schemes, Hea∣ven just at this Juncture Summon'd King <HI>James</HI> out of the World, and the King of <HI>France</HI>, who by the late Treaty at <HI>Reswick</HI>, had been oblig'd to acknowledge King <HI>William</HI>, and thereby reduc'd that unhappy Prince King <HI>James</HI>, to be quite hopeless of Restoration to his former Condition; the King of <HI>France</HI> finding by the additi∣on of <HI>Spain</HI> his Affairs in a new Posture, and his Strength so much to the Allies, that he seem'd out of the reach of their Resentments, he makes no difficulty of ac∣knowledging the Pretender as King of all <HI>England, Scotland</HI>, and <HI>Ireland</HI>, in Breach of his former Concession, and in Direct contravention to the Treaty of <HI>Reswick</HI>.</P>
<P>This, I say, broke all our Tory Measures: They had till now kept the King at <HI>Bay</HI>, and kept off the Reproaches of a War; they had given the <HI>French</HI> Room and Time to act in settling the Possession of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy without any Op∣position, and rock'd the Nation Asleep as to those things; but the whole King∣dom now took the Alarm; the Affront to the King was so gross, the Indignity was so open, so palpable a Violation of his Faith and Honour, and the Contempt of the whole <HI>English</HI> Nation was so Great, and gave so general a Disgust, that no Tory had the face to open their Mouths against it: The Nation seem'd roused out of the Deep Sleep which the Managers had cast them into, and Addresses came from all parts of the Kingdom to his Majesty, expressing their deep Resentment of the Inju∣ry done to his Majesty, and the Affront put upon the Kingdom; Humbly pressing the King to declare War immediately against <HI>France</HI>, and promising with Heart and Hand to Assist him to the Utmost; This brought on the Dissolution of that Parlia∣ment, another being call'd in that happy juncture, the War was Declar'd, and thus the second Scene began.</P>
<P>His Majesty however saw but little of it: He opened the Session with that Honou∣rable speech which Graces our Houses now, as the best Picture an <HI>English</HI> Heart can look on; and as the Parliament fell in heartily into the Work, Troops were Chearfully rais'd, and an Army appear'd sooner than the Enemy expected; the Troops and Stores was at hand; the King hurt with his Fall from his Horse, fell ill, Languish'd a few days, and to the inexpressible Loss of this Nation, Died March the 8th, 1701.</P>

<P>You should have hinted here that the <HI>French</HI>, by the neglect of our Tory Managers, and during their Delays aforesaid, had secured <HI>Portugal</HI> against us, or at least to a profess'd Neutrality, which prevented all possible Attack on the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> on that side, and cost us a great deal of Time and Expence to Retrieve.</P>

<P><PB N="16" REF="16"/>The Death of of the King struck all <HI>Europe</HI> with Astonishment, and this Nation especially: However Her Majesty, at first step, entring into the same Measures, and the War being declar'd, there seem'd no immediate Loss but of a Head to the Ar∣mies, and the King having recommended the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> to the Queen, as the most capable Person for so High a Station; this Recommendation suiting ex∣actly with Her Majesty's Inclination, who had always been a Witness to the Fide∣lity and Concern the Duke had always shown to her Interest, there was no diffi∣culty in his Advancement; and her Majesty forthwith declar'd him General of the Forces, and soon after dispatch'd him over to <HI>Holland</HI>, to Concert with the States the Operations of the War.</P>
<P>However the War came in with the Death of the King, and the <HI>Tories</HI> reviv'd with the coming in of the Queen; only with this Difference, that as before they hung back from the War, to defeat and disappoint the King whose Glory they En∣vy'd, because they Hated his Person, so now they flew with the greatest eagerness imaginable upon the War, presuming they had a Queen, a General, and a Ministry, all their own. And the first thing we heard off, was <HI>retrieving</HI> England's <HI>Honour</HI>; a Word meant for a Reproach to the Management under the late King: How they brought it to pass we shall soon Enquire.</P>

<P>They were no less foolish than that comes to: Nay, they put it upon that Issue, and began to flatter themselves that the Queen was on their side in all this, and that this kind of Behaviour would recommend them to her Majesty, and there∣fore it was that they insulted the <HI>Whiggs</HI> with it, that now the Queen was on their side; now they had got a Queen <HI>entirely English</HI>, a <HI>Nom de Guerre</HI> also, which they used in opposition to a Foreign Birth, and that therefore the <HI>Whiggs</HI> were to expect the worst.</P>

The Queen unhappily, <HI>I mean to them</HI>, in Her Maje<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty's first Speech, promising all her Sub∣jects Her Royal Protection; yet told them to this purpose, That as her Education and Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> had effectually ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d her to the Church of <HI>England</HI>, so those who were most Zealous for that Church, would be the persons she should most regard; and tho' she would give her Protection to all without distinction, yet those should have the greatest share in her Favour.

<P>No man, however, that remembers the Two first years of her Majesty's Reign, but may remember how high they run things, and how fair they bid to pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all in Confu∣sion; how, flattering themselves that they should carry all before them, and presuming up∣on the Wicked Construction they had put upon Her Majesty's Words, <HI>Most Zealous</HI>, they insulted not the Dissenters only, but every man were his Quality <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so great, or his true Zeal for the Church ever so well known, that did but shew the least true Regard to the Publick Peace, or were for observing any measures or Rules of Charity or Moderation to∣wards the Dissenters, as if Her Majesty when she spoke the Words, most Zealous for the Church, could mean nothing less than giving up all Her Dissenting Subjects to Fire and Faggot; That Persecution was the only step to be taken; and that the Queen had abandoned them to Rapine and Plunder</P>
<P>They were going on with such warmth in these Excesses, that the whole Kingdom took the Alarm, and the Enemy, as in all such cases it is observable they do, make great Advan∣tages of it.</P>
<P>But their hast, overthrew them; for Men of Moderate Principles interposing, their Aim <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣pear'd wrong taken, their Mine sprung too soon, and blew up, not the Constitution, as they had designed, but themselves.</P>
<P>The necessary consequence of this was a new Turn in the Ministry; Her Majesty b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d by the goodness of her own inclination, always desiring the Good, the Peace, and the safety of her People, was oblig'd to let th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se people know, that they had mistaken her in supposing that when she prompted their Zeal for the Church, they should think it consi∣sted only in ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irpating the Dissenters; That Her Royal Design was both more Christian, and more becoming a Christian Queen, and a Nursing Mother of her People; that she look'd upon the Peace and Union of all her Subjects with, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nother, the practice of Cha∣rity, Good Neighbourhood, and forbearance in matters of Difference, to be the true way to support and maintain the Church; and that consequently, those that were <HI>most Zealous</HI> for the Church of <HI>England</HI>, would one <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge and prom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to their utmost, a general Charity, and a Spirit of Union among all her People.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="18"/>To undeceive them therefore in this thing, and further to explain the meaning of what had been said, Her Majesty declared upon all Occasions, that she had at heart nothing more, than the Ease and Peace of all her Subjects; That she would protect the Dissenters in their peaceable and quiet behaviour, and would inviolably maintain the Toleration.</P>
<P>This indeed blew them all up, their Rage was equal to the shortness of their Power: Instead of going on with the furious attacks upon the Dissenters as before, all was turn'd on a sudden against the Queen; Lampoons upon the Moderate Bishops; Insolent Invectives against the moderate Councils, that guided Her Majesty's Affairs; calling the Bishops Presbyterians; the Queen a Deserter of the Church, and all the moderate Gentlemen of the Church, betray∣ers of their Mother and givers of her up to be Ravish'd and Butcher'd, by Wolves in Sheeps Cloathing.</P>
<P>This they carry'd to such a height of Extravagancy, that Her Majesty could not but resent it, and adhere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng firmly to the profession she had made of her Concern for the general Peace, and seeing plainly what these people drove at, the necessity of Divesting them of a power to put in practice the mischief they had apparently design'd, appear'd inevitable; Thus they were Turn'd out of the Ministry, and the Weapon of Administration taken out of their Hands, as you take the Sword out of the hand of a mad-man, or knives from your Children, that they may neither do harm to other people, or to themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is a very Distinct recital of the Fact indeed; but you must give me leave to add something also that came within the Verge of my knowledge. As first, that there was always a party among these people, who visible, and indeed without any disguise, aim'd at the pretender viz. That they should pretend to submit to the Queen during her Life, and therefore as before, they came in and took the Oaths; but that after Her Majesty the preten∣der was the undoubted Heir, and this they push'd to that height, That her Majesty was fre∣quently stil'd Tennant for Life, and that she enjoy'd the Crown by way of Annuity. They had not the Face as I could ever hear, to propose it in Council; but it is not unknown to many, that they usually said, That to finish our peace, the pretender should be declar'd pro∣testant, and that he should be acknowledg'd Successor.</P>
<P>This frightned many that had a true Zeal for Her Majesty's person, and Concern for her Safety, to think, that having reduc'd the possession of the Crown to be only a tenant for life, they had then nothing to do, but to make the Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se as short as they could, and the whole Re∣volution, with all its dependencies, such as Liberty, Law, protestant Religion, property of E∣state, Toleration and the like, lay at the mercy of every assassinator; a sort of people that par∣ty hath never wanted, and which no Loyal Subject to Her Majesty, could think of without Horror.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for your assistance in this Article, which I was not so much as let into the secret of as yet, tho' I saw the thing in its Consequences plain enough, and had occasion often to argue it, in the presence of those who were most nearly concern'd in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I remember very well they bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y'd themselves up in the hopes to make it practicable from two things; First The Rupture, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at least the probable failing of the Trea∣ty of UNION with the Scots, which was all this while carry'd on, but without any great prospect of Success, together with the aversion the Scots had declar'd to setling the Successi∣on with no; and Secondly, from the powerful Influence they thought their Friends had at Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is most evident in the Conduct of the Government here, after that Turn was given, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot no sooner was the Administration gotten into Wiser and honester Hands, but they began with them, in their own way, to Defeat their Hopes from <HI>Scotland</HI>, and effe∣ctually settle the Inheritants of the Crown in the protestant Line: Her Majesty recommended <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearty and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffectual Treaty of a Union with <HI>Scotland</HI>, and that not with the Insuperable Dif∣ficulties of Uniting or Subjecting two Different Churches, and the Confusion of Reserved Interests; but a compleat entire Incorporation, and blending the Two Nations in an indissol∣vable Union, leaving their respective Ecclesiastick Constitutions, Entire, Defended, Butted and Bounded, against any possible Invasion of one another; and secured from any Possibility
<PB N="19" REF="19"/>
of either side encroaching upon the other, or of both sides together, tho' by mutual agree∣ment being able to separate.</P>
<P>This set about Heartily, and Happily finished, Naturally took the protestant Succession, and has left it out of the reach of any Legal Power of the United Body to Repeal it.</P>
<P>The next step was to find out some method that the simple taking the Oaths might not be a Screen to those, who went upon the Notion of the Right of Possession and Reversion which you mention'd just now; and this was to Establish a Recognition of the Settlement of the Crown on the House of <HI>Hannover</HI>, by abjuring the pretender.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>These Two things form'd an Essential Security to the Life of the Queen; for now the Union being Settled, the pretender abjured, and the method of Declaring the Successor also settled by the Act, appointing a Certain number of Lords to Administer the publick Affairs, in Case of the Queen's death, till the Successor could come over, which Lords are oblidg'd and enjoyned on pain of High Treason, immediately to proclaim the Suc∣cessor: These things have made the pretender's Cause so exactly the same, whether the Queen Lives or Dies, that Her Majesty's Life is secured by this more effectually, than by Ten Thousand Men to Guard Her person. (viz) That it will not be the least advantage to them to destroy Her, nay, Happy for her Majesty it is; Their Case would appear the worse, since they would immediately have a powerful Martial Active prince, ready to pour in upon them in prossecution of his Just claim, in opposing whom, perhaps they might not find the same Clemency, Tenderness, and Forbearance which they have, till now, presum'd upon,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a good Observation indeed, for I take her Majesty's Security, to lie much more in its not being for their Advantage to Hurt Her, than in all the Tyes of Honour, Unanimity, or Oaths in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Turn-Round.</SPEAKER>
<P>And therefore we find, that since this Union and Ab∣juration, They have left off talking of the Queen's enjoying the Crown for Life, and the pretender's coming after Her; and with more Openness, (I might have said impudence) Assert the Right of the pretender to be Hereditary and indefeazable, and the Queen's possession a meer Rob∣bery and Usurpation. In pursuance of this, we have seen him once at the Head of the French Army attempting to instate Himself, and invading Her Majesty's Dominions to Dispossess Her by Force; and we are here∣by instructed, in what the Queen has to expect from the party, if power should be put into their Hands to effect it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steddy.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but too plain that they would do it by Force rather than by any other Method, if it were in their power; and one Reason is, be∣cause if they come in by force, they have the better pretence to Rule by Arbitrary power, what they gain against our consents and we have the more Reason to be steady in our Opposition.</P>

<P>Upon the Happy Success of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Moderate Councils, Her Majesty having quitted Her Hands of a Tricking Designing Party, their Attempt in Parliament against the Dissenters having Miscarry'd, and the Party exposed to the highest degree to the whole Nation, in their most Weak, and Impollitick Attempt, call'd the TACK, Things began to look with a new Face both at Home and Abroad; Successes one on the Neck of another. Victory Abroad; Rising Credit at Home; the Happy Con∣clusion of the Union; and the continu'd Declining of the <HI>French</HI> Affairs; took up the Time of near Four Successive Years: Every Year ended with Thanksgivings, Triumphs, Processions, <HI>Te Deums</HI> and Rejoycings of every kind: The Duke of MARL∣BOROUGH has fill'd our Great Halls with Trophies, and our Magazines with the Spoils of the Enemies Armies. The World has been Amazed with the Surprizing Ac∣counts; Armies entirely Overthrown, whole Countries Recover'd; Impregnable Cities Taken; He has never attack'd a Town, but he has taken it; never Fought a Battle, but he has Won it; Never undertaken any Negotiation, but he has accomplish'd it: Our Treasurer has produc'd Immense Summs; our Credit risen beyond what the World ever saw, or any other Nation can pretend to; and <HI>France</HI>, Humbled by his many irrecovera∣ble Losses, has been brought these last Years upon Knees to Sollicite for Peace.</P>
<P>In doing this, he has Submitted to take Law from the Confederates in all Cases; He has sent to the <HI>Hague</HI> to ask Peace of the <HI>Dutch</HI> at their own Doors. When he comes to a Second Treaty, He submits to send his Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nipotentiaries to a little Obscure Hole in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Dominions, where they Treat, inviron'd by a Strong Garrison, are not permitted to come a Foot nearer the <HI>Dutch</HI>; but when they have any thing to say, Messengers of a me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Quality are sent to fetch it like a Message, and carry their Answer, and when this proves not Satisfactory, they are sent home, as if they had said, <HI>When you are further Humbled, Come again</HI>.</P>
<P>In these Treaties the Concession of <HI>France</HI> are Prodigious, and Greater than is likely to be obtain'd by Force in many Years War; even to the Demolishing of <HI>Dunkirk</HI>, that costly Work; the Quitting his Grandson; and Constituting Money to assist us to Dethrone him: It were endless to recite all the Countries, Cities, and strong Towns he offers to give up in a Peace.</P>
<P>This is the State of the Case upon the Administration of a New Ministry, <HI>who this New Ministry were</HI> need not be repeated, you know them well enough; and both you and I know, and have spoken it to his Honour, that M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>H</HI>—, for whatever Reasons he has since mov'd in another Sphere, was the Happy Instrument that heed the Nation from the <HI>Machivilian</HI> Projects of that Party; and while he pursued the Measures, so Hap∣pily begun in Conjunction with the Treasurer, the General<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and others, the Affairs of this Nation were under the best Influence, and went on in the most flourishing man∣ner imaginable: And it was during this Conjunction, that most of the great Successes which I mention'd just now were obtain'd</P>

<P><HI>I am Steddy still, and have no Opinion of that kind; however, let me go on: The first Breach which was made in the Ministry, whether it sprung from his Ambition to overthrow others, or any ill Usage which is pretended, is not to the purpose; but this is certain, it has been a very unhappy Blow: From that time to this the Unity of Councils, the Peace of Parties, and the general Tranquility of the Nation have declin'd; we have been fill'd with Complaints of Management without Doors, and many busie endeavours to make the People uneasie; nor has things past without some Reciprocal Resentments and Unkindnesses within, and on both sides: No want of Emissaries and Incendiaries to blow the Coals, to raise Feuds, keep up Animosities; and Influence Parties; things naturally Tending to a Breach, and to Interrupt the Felicity of this Nation, which had so happily been our Lot for the past Years.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This is grown to such a Height, as we see at this Time, when the Ministry that had ma∣naged with so much Success, and had brought us to such happy Circumstances, seem to have lost the Favour of their Mistress; and private Disasters falling in with Party Inte∣rests, have tunn'd the Scales, Her Majesty has been prevail'd with to change Hands in the Administration, and we have a new Court Revolution. There is no doubt but</HI> HER MAJESTY <HI>has an unquestion'd</HI> AUTHORITY <HI>to change Hands as often as seems meet to Her Royal Judgment; that Prince has but little Authority left that cannot bestow Her Personal Esteem▪ as She her self pleases. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Pamphlets, who reproach the Queen with Turning out Ministers of State, without just Reason, or without shewing Cause for her Dislike, are Lampoons upon the Prerogative, Satyrs upon the Consti∣tution, and very Unmannerly upon the Queen. who has so undoubted a Right to employ who She pleases, that no Loyal Subject will offer to say to her in that Case, What dost thou? It would be to divest the Queen of her true</HI> Regalia, <HI>the Scepter; to take from Her the Power of Regulating Her Houshold, and Putting in, or Putting out Her Servants</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Nor is Her Majesty's Power of Dissolving or Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogueing Parliaments any more to be disputed, than that of Placing and Displacing Officers and Servants; and therefore I am to confess as to a Paper call'd</HI> Queries <HI>lately published, I think the first Query a most ab∣surd and ridiculous Thing (viz.)</HI> Whether ever any Parliament had more deserv'd to sit again than this? <HI>Speaking strictly of the Duty of Parliaments, and the Reason and End of their Sitting, no Parliament can deserve of the Queen; they may deserve the Ac∣knowledgment of the People: But to say a Parliament are to deserve of the Sovereign, would be a keen Satyr upon the House, or upon the Crown, and that for many Reasons not so fit to enlarge upon; all the Zeal, the Vigour, the Fidelity and Application they are capable of, in Defence of the Liberties of the People, which they are entrusted with, is their indispensible Duty, all their Care for the Honour and Support of the Monarchy, and Defence of the Person and Authority of their Sovereign, that tis consistent with the Zeal, Vigour and Fidelity aforesaid, is their Duty; in doing this▪ they discharge their Trust like true Patriots and Loyal Subjects: But to talk of their Deserving by this to sit again, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Lan∣guage very Unparliamentary, and many have Constructions very Fatal put upon it; by the same Rule they may deserve to sit for ever and for aye; and the Triennial Act which we justly think a safe Guard to our Liberties, would</HI> ipso facto, <HI>be repeal'd by the Nature of the Thing</HI>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All this we own. But why do you promise this with so much Cau∣tion just now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Because these Things are thrown in our way as Answers to our Objections when we really make no such Objections; and therefore it is necessary to state the thing, as we go along, to anticipate the Cavils we meet with of that kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore I suppose it is, that, as I have observ'd, they make use of the Queen's having a Right to do this to another Purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They do so; and take upon them to spread about among the People, a no∣tion, that there was an absolute Necessity to make this Change. And could they make this out, the Thing were at an End. We own Her Right to do it, and they insist upon the Necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is indeed the Sum of the present Dispute. Indeed I see no ne∣cessity the Queen has been under. I must own, Others may see it, tho' I do not; and therefore I will not say as some do, that there was no Necessity at all. But I have waited long to hear what this Necessity is, and from whence it proceeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All that I can see of Necessity, depends upon Her Majesty's being Con∣vinc'd that these new Men are Faithful to Her, and more Devoted to Her true In∣terest, more Capable to support Her than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that does not prove the Necessity, unle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it were that They were only capable of supporting Her, and not the Other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is another Necessity, which may have something in it (<HI>viz.</HI>) a Nece∣ssity on the High Tory side (<HI>viz.</HI>) that whereas they had so behav'd and justly ex∣pos'd themselves to the Resentment of the Parliament and Ministry, that they must be sure to be ruin'd, if they continu'd, it was absolutely necessary to them to have the one Dissolv'd and the other Chang'd. But will any Man call it a Necessity upon the Sovereign, that She shou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Dissolve a Parliament, Faithful and Dutiful Servants, and change Her whole Ministry to save <HI>Sacheverell</HI> from farther Resentment, or to skreen that Infamous Scribler, <HI>Abel Roper</HI>, from the Pillory, for abusing the House of Commons in Print; a Fellow, Illiterate and Ignorant to a Proverb, and whose Pen, grown scandalous to themselves, is only made use of for his daring to say a∣ny thing without regard to honour the Reputation of persons; or the Truth of Fact. Sure this can be no part of the Necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But they allege, the Heat of Parties was come to that height, and the Animosity was so great, that there was an absolute Necessity to give Things a new Turn, that the Edge might be a little taken off <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n both Sides, that both Sides might be cool'd, the Fury abated and Things brought to a Temper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are to suppose this new M—y are to bring Things to Temper. But will you first examine what Men of Temper are among them? Have they not thrown us all upon the Tories for Moderation, and upon the Men of Fire to cool our Heats? How can this bring us to Temper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is the very thing I complain of, and for which as you know I told you, I am come off from them; and yet I am still of Opinion, they will not pretend to the Measures they took in the beginning of the Queen; and that when they come to act, you will see they will steer quite another course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> find you are of the same Opinion with the <HI>Review</HI>, That <HI>tho' they are</HI> Tories <HI>by Inclination, they must be</HI> Whiggs <HI>by Office</HI>; and <HI>that by the necessity of the Constitution they must act upon Revolution Principles. I</HI> am in part of that mind too; but I cannot but think 'tis dangerous to have a <HI>Whigg</HI> Constitution Administred upon <HI>Tory</HI> Principles. There is a certain Necessity, that either the Constitution must restrain the Principle, or the Principle will destroy the Constitution And is it safe to run the Risque? Had the <HI>Review</HI> prov'd the Necessity of making that dangerous Experiment, he had said more to the purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you, and wish the Experiment had not been made; but since it is made, I am of that mind too, let it be whose it will, that they can act upon no other Foot than that of the Revolution; and therefore I am not so Chagrin <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Change as some people are.

<P>How is it possible they can take good Measures with such Instru∣ments as they have. Now upon their Work to begin where they begun, I mean with Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>. It is below me to give him the Terms he de∣serves: But as General <HI>Stanhope</HI> observ'd upon his Tryal, <HI>A Contemptible Tool, set up by a Party to insult the Constitution, and fly in the Face of the Admi∣nistration</HI>. They could not have pick'd out of the whole Nation, a Man, whose Impudence was fitter to be at the Head of a bad Cause, and whose Character is less able to support him; a Man of little Learning, less Modesty, and no Vertue; Scandalous in his Behaviour in every particular, of a most Infamous Reputation, and of a most unheard of Degree of Pride, qualify'd for any thing that was Affronting either to God or Man; who could call God to witness to a Thing at a Bar of Justice, and make a jest of the same thing in Conversation in the solemnest manner; and with a whining Accent, to move compassion upon his Tryal before the Lords, protest his Loyalty to the Person of the Queen, and Zeal for her Interest, and drink on his Knees to the <HI>Pretender</HI> as his Lawful Sovereign in another Company; a Fellow qualify'd to Bully the Nation, and to make Madmen more Lunatick. Can any Man believe, that a Party, to whom this Creature is a Tool, have any work to do that is fit for an honest Man, or an honest Party to embark in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is very True. But if you will give me leave so far to speak in the Persons of a Set of Men, whose party I have quitted, I shall dis∣charge my self impartially.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I could be glad to have room but to think of them with some charity, and I will be far enough from doing them any Injustice. What can you have to say to this <HI>Bachanalian</HI> Priest, that has thus ruffled the Nati∣on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you first. I say that you cannot speak more con∣temptibly of him than they do themselves; and indeed all his party, that have any Sense, I have been with them in some of their Closets, Councils, they always condemn'd him, and look'd upon him as a Fire-brand. Nor do I believe they had any hand in his late unsufferable Insolence in his country Cavalcade. His Sermon they condemn'd as a piece of pulpit-Raving. And had you Voted him to <HI>Bedlam</HI>, he had been carry'd away, <HI>Nemine Contradi∣cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But have they censur'd any of his Abettors, hang'd any of his Rio∣tors, punish'd or discountenanc'd any of those that have broke the peace, and insulted their Neighbours on his account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you what they say: They▪ say the present humour of the People serves their present Designs; it is not a Time to push Things too far. The Affair of <HI>Sacheverell</HI> broke the Ice for them▪ 'tis become popu∣lar; it has been a mean to run down the other Party; and thus far they have serv'd themselves of it. That the Impeachment was a wrong Step, and brought the Church into the Quarrel; that they were oblig'd to take the Occasion, and bring about what they aim'd at before, when they knew nothing of that Ac∣cident: But that for the Man they abhor him; and whereas he is blown up with Pride, upon the Opinion of their Approbation, they have nothing to
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
ridicule him for more that he has no more Countenance from them, he has done their Business, and they have no more to say to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I make no question, but he will render himself as Contemptible to them in Time, as he is to us; but in the mean time the Nation is full of in∣tollerable Insolency on his Account, and a Spirit of Tumult and Riot runs thro' the Nation, which fits the People for any Violence, the Conniving at which, by these new People, encourages it so much, that it may soon rise to an Height, too great for themselves to quench; and to prompt a People to Tumult and Rebellion, was never, that I know of, thought any part of good Politicks, in a Government calculated as ours is, to support Property, and pro∣tect Justice. These Things give me a general Suspicion of the Party, that their Design cannot be good, when the Means to bring it to pass is so perni∣cious to the Nation's Good. As to the Impeachment, I am clear, the Necessi∣ty of punishing so much Insolence was unavoidable; if it had any evil Effects, it was from the Conduct of that Party, who prevented his being treated more suitable to his Deserts, and who suffer'd our Mobbs unpunish'd, not only to In∣sult Justice in its very Execution, but to ridicule and triumph over that part of it, which <HI>on all other Occasions would have been call'd Moderation</HI>, as an Ef∣fect of Fear, and a Submission to the Clamours of the Street. But I look on this Impeachment as a very small part of this Affair: the Blood was stagnate before, and the Disease must have broken out somewhere, if not there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know, had the Thing been prosecuted, as I think it should have been, and the Criminal been severely punish'd, the Impeaching him was a Step founded on Wisdom, Prudence and Necessity; <HI>and I think no body can deny it</HI>. But as it was run down by a Party, it has been a Handle to ruine the best Interest, and has been the Foundation of all the Confusion that has follow'd; and on that Score, I wish they had taken other Measures with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am never for reproaching the Means if the End was right, tho' perhaps those Means do not succeed; I am satisfy'd the House of Commons could have done no less, except they would fit still and see themselves insulted every Day. But come we next to the Consequences of this Mischief which is the Remove of the Ministry; and this, they say, there was a Necessity for. I cannot see this Necessity. This Caviling Author, who under the Title of <HI>Double</HI> is brought in owning more Crimes than the Age has seen committed, lays the universal Scandal of every thing upon the Ministry, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> if <HI>we

know him right</HI>, he has been kept from Starving by that very Ministry, which Dr. <HI>D</HI>—t can bear witness of. Nay, he goes back and tells you, it was long of them the Old Coin was Clip'd and Defac'd, tho' all the World knows they had no other Concern in it than to rectify that Evil, which they did to a Prodigy. Here he rummages every Action, not for what is well in it, but for somewhat to find <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with; the Victories gain'd have not been enough improv'd to satisfy him: The Cre∣dit has suffer'd, tho' rais'd from nothing to the highest pitch: The Nation has been impos'd upon: The Generals prolong the War; and a Thousand such Things. But where is the Matter of Fact to appear? The March into <HI>Bavaria</HI> was against the Will of the Party; they Insulted and Threatned the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> upon it, and a certain Person of Figure, sw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re by G—d it should cost him his Head. Had he miscarry'd in it, no doubt he would have done his Devoir to have it so. The March itself was the greatest the World ever saw of that kind, and still greate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in its wonderful Consequences; <HI>Suabia</HI> was delivered, <HI>Bavaria</HI> Conquer'd, the <HI>Upper Palatinate</HI> Reduc'd, the Invincible <HI>French</HI> Army Victoriously cut in Pieces; the Confederate Army return'd, pursu'd the flying Army over the <HI>Danub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver the <HI>Rhine</HI>, took all the Enemy were possess'd of for 180 Miles, Besieg'd <HI>Ulm</HI>, and after that <HI>Landau</HI>, and took them both; and all this in one Campaign; and yet thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vi∣ctory was not well pursued.

<P>That makes me say, it is not an ill Aim to take Measures from a View of their Schemes; if they Hope, we have the more reason to be Jealous: if they are Confident, it gives us a proportion'd degree of Fear, and that very justly too. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is not all, we know these High flyers, we have experienc'd their Politicks, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> precipitant Councils they always run into, the visible Aim at our Confusion, and have seen how far they have gone in it, and how near they brought our Raine to pass; We have reason to keep them out, and to oppose all that would bring them in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot but think, and indeed I promise it my self from the New Ministry, that tho' the Door has been set open to some of these People they will go into none of their Measures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is a Mystery to me, and which I believe I shall never be able to fathom, why they should bring them in at all, People never bring Men into Offi∣ces on purpose to turn them out again, and they can never say they brought them in for want of proper Hands to employ, there were a great many Gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Posts of Trust, and are still, who tho' they were not forward for the Changes, yet were not so Prejudic'd in favour of the Old Ministry that they would have failed in their Duty to the New Men of Honour and Principle, serve their Country, and serve
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
their Queen in the Employments they are Trusted with; they do not serve this or that Minister of State, but they serve the Government; and if the New Ministry pur∣sued the just and proper Measures suited to the Foundation on which we stand, there was no need of putting these out, and consequently no Necessity of bringing in <HI>To∣ries</HI> for want of Hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Their great Argument in that Case is, that they bring in no more than they can over-rule in Matters of Council; and if they will not joyn in pur∣suing the moderate Steps they resolve to take, they may be turn'd out again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If they the Ministry, do pursue moderate Measures, the <HI>Tories</HI> will either not joyn with them, or if they do, they must act as never <HI>Tories</HI> acted yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They say the Measures laid are moderate already, and if any other are taken, it is the <HI>Whiggs</HI> that drive them to the Necessity of it, by refusing to joyn in such Measures as are allow'd to be for the publick safety, only because they pretend not to like the Persons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Those People who pursue their personal Piques rather than the Publick Good, may have those narrow Notions; for my part, my Resentment is at no Man's Person, any farther than the Publick Good is concern'd: If these Men would pursue the general Interest of <HI>Britain</HI>, support the Alliance, carry on the War effe∣ctually, suppress the violent and insolent Abettors of the <HI>Pretender</HI>, defend the To∣leration, the Union, the Succession, and carry on the true <HI>English</HI> Interest; it's all one to me, whether I am Out or In; God forbid I should oppose them; I would lend them all the Assistance I could; for it's the Nation's Good I regard; and tho' <HI>I</HI> do not think as they think, tho' I lik'd the Old Ministry, and saw no reason for dismissing them, yet if these Men pursue with an honest Zeal, and by proper Mea∣sures, the Publick Good, I can be very good Friends with them too. But how can this be done by <HI>Tories</HI> and Enemies to the Constitution? Did not the Queen once try these Men? Was She not oblig'd to throw them off? Was not, as you noted just now, this very Gentleman, now at the head of the Management, the very Man that assisted in Turning them oll out, and to his Honour, sav'd the Queen and the whole Nation from their unaccountable Projects? It is the strangest Measure to my Apprehension, that ever a Man could take in the State, to bring in a Party that he had thrown out before, purely upon Principles of Safety. What Credit, what Foun∣dation have they for the Government to rest upon, or by which they can uphold the Nation in this time of Exigence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed the Credit of that Party is low enough, and that is, no doubt the Reason why the Publick Credit has sink so much upon their being brought in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Publick Credit has, till now, surmounted all that ever went before it; and by this Thing, call'd <HI>Credit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>, we have for those many Years past, carry'd on the War at an Expence much superior to our Strength, and this Breach upon the Ministry, as in all such Cases, it will be, must be a Shock to it. I will not say, but this Blow might be warded off, had they gone on at first with moderate Steps; but this bringing <HI>Tories</HI> in, Hot, Mad, Raging <HI>Tories</HI>, this will, in my weak Judgment, quite finish the Tragedy, and destroy that Credit, which was wounded before. No Man will venture his Money in Tory Hands; they have no Honour, no Regard to the Publick Good, or to private Right, otherwise than as it suits with their Party. The Nation expects nothing from them, and therefore will do nothing for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The great Complaint they make runs past the same way, they tell you, that the Managemement of the Exchequer has been preposterous, that the Or∣der of Things has been partially Dispos'd, that a great Debt lies on the Navy, to support other Avocations; and they run a mighty length on the Discount of the Victualling Bills, the Pil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Government is oblig'd to give for Provisions, Stores, &amp;c and they lay this all to the Door of the old Ministry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All this is begging the Question, because there is a Court where this Cause is to be heard, if there has been any thing of that kind done, which there are not good Reasons to justifie, and which the Necessity of the Publick Service did not re∣quire; then indeed the Weight will fall upon Persons; and we do not see that they make the least Preparation to escape you, or to shun coming to a Hearing: 'Tis time enough to raise an Argument upon this, when it has been try'd on the other hand, if the Exigencies of the Government, unexpected Occasions, unforeseen Service, or justifiable Accidents of the War has call'd for greater Sums than was ex∣pected, or has call'd for those Sums faster than they could be gotten in. This is part of the general Calamity of the War, and may be the Fate of the present, as it may have been the Fate of the past Ministry. But leaving these things to their Examination, this is not the State of the Case, with all these Disadvantages; the Credit of the Nation was Great to a Degree not to be equall'd; and the Value of that Credit to us, in our present Circumstances, is too great to be slighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They pretend this Credit was sinking before, and would have fallen lower than it is now by a great deal, if this Change had not been made, and that the Old Ministry could not have supported it or themselves much longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There has been a Party that has all along said so; and have told us, that we could find no more Funds, that we could not stand another Year, that we must make Peace, and that Ways and Means would fail us. Yet when the Time came, we always found my Lord Treasurer had his Schemes ready, and Money was ne∣ver wanting to lend, or Funds on which to borrow. But if <HI>Tories</HI> come into play, we shall see where they will produce either as to the Debt upon the Navy, Victu∣alling Stores, &amp;c. It is true, they run to a great Discount; but this was owing only to the Uncertainty of Payment. My Ld. T—r had no more to do in the next Parlia∣ment, than to bring bring them upon the foot of some certain Fund, which should ascer∣tain when they should be paid, and in the mean time should discharge the Interest, and that Clamour would cease, the Discount would not only fall, but the People would be as eager to lay them up, as they are their Annuities, Exchequer Bills, and other certain Credits on the Government. So that all the Noise rais'd about the great Debt of the Navy, turns upon this Hinge only, not whether a Parliament can, or shall make it good, but whether the Treasurer is blameable in letting it run on, as it has done or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have stated this very clearly. Credit was at a Pitch it cannot be restor'd to. But those People tell us, as I said before, we were going down the Wind before that Credit began to decline, and could not be supported, nor could the Fall of our Credit be prevented.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Had that been true, there was the less need of this Blow to give a Stab in∣to the Vitals upon Presumption of Curing it again. I know what a certain Great man, and now Leader of this Management has been pleas'd to publish to the World in Print, in his <HI>Essay upon Credit</HI> (viz.) <HI>That Credit depends not on the Ministry, nor on this or that Great Manager, but upon the Parliament, and upon a Just, Honorable and Punctual Discharge of every Trust, and a fair Management</HI>. And this is very true. But then it follows, which I suppose the Right Honourable the Author did not forget, but omitted, for good Reasons, <HI>That this Honourable, Punctual Discharge</HI>, &amp;c. must be, and appear to be, <HI>Quia Idem est non esse &amp; non apperere</HI>, before the said Credit, which he says depends upon it, can be produc'd. Every Cause is Prior and Antecedent to its Effect; and can't he tell us what we must do in the mean time? An <HI>Interreg∣num</HI> in the Kingdom of Credit is entirely Destructive of its Constitution; it must require some time of Probation, it seems, for this Punctual Management to appear. I will not say, that Author, who has so much of it in his Power; cannot bring it to
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
pass. Nor will I suggest, that he will not take all possible Measures to do so. But I may be allow'd to say, it will require some Time to do it; as in a Pleurisie, if the Sur∣geon be too far to fetch, the Patient may Die, for want of opening a Vein to give a due Circulation; so Credit once lost, for want of the Experiment, may be past fetch∣ing to Life, when 'tis done.</P>
<P>The just reflection of these things makes them talk of the Landed Men setting up against the Money'd Men, and the Error of borrowing upon Funds, when the Mo∣ney should have been rais'd Yearly for every Years Expence; but these that know these things perfectly, must know that the Annual Sums the War has requir'd, have been too great for this Nation to raise within a Year; and that the borrowing upon Funds has been the happy Expedient, without which the War could not be carried on. That Land is a good Security for the support of the War, and the Landed Men, who, they say, are on their side, may do much; yet I should begin to pity them, tho' they had all the Land in the Nation on their Hands, if the Money'd Men, by any particular Fate, should be prevented lending their Help, and Credit should sink so low, as that their Funds should meet with no Anticipations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They boast mightily of the Power of the Landed Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I</HI> hope for them, and for the sake of the publick; they will not be put to the Necessity of making that Experiment, lest it should first sink all other Methods, and then fall in the Performance, we must expect the Issue of that in Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And what to think you of their carrying on the War?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know what to think of it; if the People that we are speaking of may have their Minds, it is easy to know how they would carry it on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I find you are of my Mind, for you are for distinguishing between those that <HI>are come in</HI>, and those that <HI>may come in</HI>, and so am I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me again, I am for distinguishing closer than that; I am for distinguishing between those that <HI>are come in</HI>, and those that <HI>are to come in</HI>, that is, between those that were first put in, and those they may be, have been said to bring in after them. I own, I was among them that regretted the first Remove; I thought there was not the least Occasion for it, Things went on well abroad, the Enemy began to submit, and with this Campaign we might have seen <HI>France</HI> humbled. If there were any Uneasinesses, any Errors, any Objection, they were not among the In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rables, they would have easily admitted a Remedy; and all our Party Differen∣ces might have been accommodated among us without a Breach that should influ∣ence our Allies, touch our National Peace, and put new Hopes into a Desponding Enemy. These were my Thoughts upon the general Article<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when I saw the first Removes, tho' I confess I was sorry for it, yet I thought there might still be some room for the Re-establishing Things, and that the Men put in, as they had no Views before them, but what were said on a moderate Management, would have brought in Men qualify'd for a Concurrence with such a Principle; but when a second and a third Trust was given, and I saw who follow'd to the Breach, and who enter'd Pell∣mell with the first, <HI>Then I gave up all, and Despair'd</HI>; nor have I any thing left to expect, unless One of Two Things fall out, which I wish may appear practicable</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pray</HI> may I ask you what they are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am a plain-Dealer, and will tell you freely my Thoughts: Supposing the first of these People are really acting upon Moderate Schemes and Revolution Principles, and this you will allow is a great deal to grant: But suppose it, the <HI>Review</HI> says <HI>they must</HI>, that they cannot stir Hand or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o but in that strait Lane, I am not of his Opinion, there may be middle dark and by Ways that neither he or I know of. But I'll suppose for once, <HI>what I should be glad to see, (viz.</HI>) That the New Managers shall proceed by Moderate Measures and Schemes taken from the Re∣volution,
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
that they shall carry an even Hand in their Steering between the Parties and make no Breaches upon our Settlements, either Religious or Civil, these two Things must follow.</P>
<P N="1">I. That they must Over-rule, and Restrain the <HI>Tories</HI> they have taken in, or,</P>
<P N="2">II. Turn them out again.</P>
<P>These are the Two Things of which I say I have nothing left to expect, unless one of them shall happen; and if either of them should fall out, I shall own 'tis more than I look for also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>These are material Things, and I know they pretend to say, that is their Resolution in their publick Management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if they do pretend to it, they would do well to tell us how they are sure they shall not let in too many for them to Master, like Men cutting a Bank in a flowing River to Water the Grounds, near it the force of the Stream makes the Breach so wide, that they that made it cannot stop it, and so the Lands instead of being Watered, are Drowned. A Man makes a Fire to Warm him, but if he does not keep it under, and within the Bounds of the FIRE-PLACE, it takes hold of the House, and he cannot quench it; then he cries out for help, but it's too late, he should have taken Care to have made no more Fire than he could keep under. Now, if they pretend to over-rule and restrain the <HI>Tories</HI> they bring in, they had best take heed they do not let in too many. The like is to be said as to the Second, The <HI>Tories</HI> will not be Over-rul'd or Restrain'd, says the Scheme; they may be turn'd out: But remember the Soldier that took a <HI>Tartar</HI>, he would neither come with him, nor let him come without him: If they can say they will not be Restrain'd, they may say they will not <HI>Turn Out</HI> neither: And from this farther; for if Moderate Men cannot get <HI>Tories</HI> turn'd out, the <HI>Tories</HI> will certainly get the Moderate Men turn'd Out: And thus all the good Designs we pre∣tend to will sink in this, <HI>The Flood is too strong for us</HI>, and we cannot help it. This will all end as Sir <HI>George Jefferyes</HI> his Glory expired, when after all his Elevation, he found himself in a close Prison, all he thought fit to say of it was, <HI>Who would ha' thought it</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I should rather have said, Who would not ha' thought it! How could it be otherwise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think, after all they can say for it, the Hazard of a Miscarriage is too much, the Venture too great, and the Consequences so fatal, that no wise Man would venture it; the <HI>Rubicon</HI> is past, and they have ventur'd it: I should be less concern'd if the Consequences were not to the Nation more than to the Ministry, they may fall, and few would pity them; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill Liberty, Religion and Consti∣tution must fall with them, and that is the Foundation of my Concern in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This brings you back to my Question about the War; I would be glad to have a Word or two about that with you, for I am in no small pain about it, and really the Difficulties state themselves very formidably to me, I am afraid of the War▪ afraid of the Peace; I know not what Point to come to in the Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is a Point no Man can be easy in, that has a just Concern for the E∣vent of Things. I make no doubt carrying on the War will be the Pretence, yet they openly charge the Old Management with having a Design to protract the War: They tell us in the Concessions of the <HI>French</HI> in their last Proposal, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Of con∣tinuing Money to the War in <HI>Spain</HI> to Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>possess the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI>, were sufficient at least it was all you could have Reason to demand of him; that to bid him Sur∣render <HI>Spain</HI> after you had oblig'd him to withdraw all his Auxilary Troops from thence, was Ridiculous, and asking him to give what was not in his Possession, that you might have demanded Cautionary Towns for the Security of the Perfor∣mance:
<PB N="32" REF="34" MS="y"/>
And there was no doubt it would have been granted; and that you had brought the <HI>French</HI> to such low Terms, that if you had been at the Gates of <HI>Paris</HI> you could have asked no more. These are the Arguments they bring to prove that we had no Design to make Peace at all; that carrying on the War is rather the View and that other Ends are reserved by it and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Turn-Round.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For my part whatever they may say of managing <HI>the Treaty, I</HI> think 'tis clear <HI>the War</HI> has not been carried on as if that were the View; the Duke of <HI>Marle∣borough</HI> has not Fought as if he design'd to carry on the War, unless it be <HI>to the Gates of Paris</HI>, no Prince has ever push'd a War on with more Ardour, and with better Success, and 'tis to this Pushing the <HI>French</HI>, that we owe the Concessions for a Peace which they have made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Steddy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is very clear to me, that the War has been carry'd well on; it is also clear to us all, that the Offers of the King of <HI>France</HI> were far from a Security to us for the Surrender of <HI>Spain</HI>; the Insincerity of the <HI>French</HI> in all their Treaties suffi∣ciently Justifies the Allies using the utmost Concern in the point of Security; and by the consequences it seems clear to me, that the <HI>French</HI> had no Design to act with <HI>Candour</HI> in this Treaty, since it is apparent to all the World, that at the same time they were Negotiating a Treaty with <HI>Spain</HI> Offensive and Defensive, and the King of <HI>France</HI> had given Assurances to his Grandson that he would never Abandon him. If these Things are true, then from an unanswerable Proof, that all that caution and backwardness of the Allies in the Treaty were necessary, and justifiable to Reason and the Protestant Interest: And if these Gentlemen think fit to put an end to the War, by making a Peace less safe and upon less severe Conditions than the other, it will not be long I believe before the Nation will be convinc'd who has pursu'd the right Interest of <HI>Europe</HI>, the Old Ministry or the New.</P>
