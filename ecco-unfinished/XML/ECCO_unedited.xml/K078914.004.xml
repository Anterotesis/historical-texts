<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, at Bellfield, Rutland.
<DATELINE>Rose-hill, <DATE>Sept. 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>CAN you in earnest ask such a ques∣tion?
can you suppose I ever felt
the least degree of love for Sir
George? No, my Rivers, never did your
Emily feel tenderness till she saw the
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
loveliest, the most amiable of his sex, till
those eyes spoke the sentiments of a soul
every idea of which was similar to her
own.</P>
<P>Yes, my Rivers, our souls have the
most perfect resemblance: I never heard
you speak without finding the feel∣ings
of my own heart developed; your
conversation conveyed your Emily's
ideas, but cloathed in the language of
angels.</P>
<P>I thought well of Sir George; I
saw him as the man destined to be my
husband; I fancied he loved me, and
that gratitude obliged me to a re∣turn;
carried away by the ardor of
my friends for this marriage, I rather
suffered than approved his addresses;
I had not courage to resist the torrent,
I therefore gave way to it; I loved
no other, I fancied my want of affec∣tion
a native coldness of temper. I felt
a languid esteem, which I endeavored to
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
flatter myself was love; but the moment
I saw you, the delusion vanished.</P>
<P>Your eyes, my Rivers, in one mo∣ment
convinced me I had a heart; you
staid some weeks with us in the coun∣try:
with what transport do I recollect
those pleasing moments! how did my
heart beat whenever you approached
me! what charms did I find in your
conversation! I heard you talk with a
delight of which I was not mistress. I
fancied every woman who saw you, felt
the same emotions: my tenderness in∣creased
imperceptibly without my per∣ceiving
the consequences of my indulg∣ing
the dear pleasure of seeing you.</P>
<P>I found I loved, yet was doubtful of
your sentiments; my heart, however, flat∣tered
me yours was equally affected;
my situation prevented an explanation;
but love has a thousand ways of making
himself understood.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
How dear to me were those soft, those
delicate attentions, which told me all you
felt for me, without communicating it to
others!</P>
<P>Do you remember that day, my Ri∣vers,
when, sitting in the little hawthorn
grove, near the borders of the river,
the rest of the company, of which Sir
George was one, ran to look at a ship
that was passing: I would have follow∣ed;
you asked me to stay, by a look
which it was impossible to mistake;
nothing could be more imprudent than
my stay, yet I had not resolution to
refuse what I saw gave you pleasure:
I stayed; you pressed my hand, you
regarded me with a look of unutter∣able
love.</P>
<P>My Rivers, from that dear moment your
Emily vowed never to be another's: she
vowed not to sacrifice all the happiness of
her life to a romantic parade of fidelity
<PB N="5" REF="7"/>
to a man whom she had been betrayed
into receiving as a lover; she resolved,
if necessary, to own to him the tender∣ness
with which you had inspired her, to
entreat from his esteem, from his compas∣sion,
a release from engagements which
made her wretched.</P>
<P>My heart burns with the love of virtue,
I am tremblingly alive to fame: what bit∣terness
then must have been my portion
had I first seen you when the wife of ano∣ther!</P>
<P>Such is the powerful sympathy that
unites us, that I fear, that virtue, that
strong sense of honor and fame, so power∣ful
in minds most turned to tenderness,
would only have served to make more
poignant the pangs of hopeless, despairing
love.</P>
<P>How blest am I, that we met before my
situation made it a crime to love you! I
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
shudder at the idea how wretched I might
have been, had I seen you a few months
later.</P>
<P>I am just returned from a visit at a few
miles distance. I find a letter from my
dear Bell, that she will be here to-mor∣row;
how do I long to see her, to talk
to her of my Rivers!</P>
<CLOSER>I am interrupted.
Adieu! Yours,

<OPENER>To Mrs. TEMPLE.
<DATELINE>Rose-hill, <DATE>Sept. 18,</DATE> Morning.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment, my dear Mrs.
Temple's letter: she will imagine my
transport at the happy event she men∣tions;
my dear Rivers has, in some de∣gree,
sacrificed even filial affection to
his tenderness for me; the consciousness
of this has ever cast a darnp on the plea∣sure
I should otherwise have selt, at
the prospect of spending my life with
the most excellent of mankind: I shall
now be his, without the painful re∣flection
of having lessened the enjoy∣ments
of the best parent that ever ex∣isted.</P>
<P>I should be blest indeed, my amiable
friend, if I did not suffer from my too
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
anxious tenderness; I dread the possibi∣lity
of my becoming in time less dear to
your brother; I love him to such excess
that I could not survive the loss of his
affection.</P>
<P>There is no distress, no want, I could
not bear with delight for him; but if I
lose his heart, I lose all for which life is
worth keeping.</P>
<P>Could I bear to see those looks of ar∣dent
love converted into the cold glances
of indifference!</P>
<P>You will, my dearest friend, pity a
heart, whose too great sensibility wounds
itself: why should I fear? was ever ten∣derness
equal to that of my Rivers? can
a heart like his change from caprice? It
shall be the business of my life to merit
his tenderness.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="11"/>
I will not give way to fears which in∣jure
him, and, indulged, would destroy all
my happiness.</P>
<P>I expect Mr. and Mrs. Fitzgerald every
moment, Adieu!</P>

<SIGNED>EMILY MONTAGUE.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER CLXXXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Sept. 17.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU say true, my dear Fitzgerald:
friendship, like love, is more the
child of sympathy than of reason; though
inspired by qualities very opposite to those
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
which give love, it strikes like that in
a moment: like that, it is free as air,
and, when constrained, loses all its
spirit.</P>
<P>In both, from some nameless cause,
at least some cause to us incomprehen∣sible,
the affections take fire the instant
two persons, whose minds are in unison,
observe each other, which, however, they
may often meet without doing.</P>
<P>It is therefore as impossible for others
to point out objects of our friendship as
love; our choice must be uninfluenced, if
we wish to find happiness in either.</P>
<P>Cold, lifeless esteem may grow from
a long tasteless acquaintance; but real
affection makes a sudden and lively im∣pression.</P>
<P>This impression is improved, is strength∣ened
by time, and a more intimate know∣ledge
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
of the merit of the person who
makes it; but it is, it must be, sponta∣neous,
or be nothing.</P>
<P>I felt this sympathy powerfully in re∣gard
to yourself; I had the strongest par∣tiality
for you before I knew how very
worthy you were of my esteem.</P>
<P>Your countenance and manner made an
impression on me, which inclined me to
take your virtues upon trust.</P>
<P>It is not always safe to depend on these
preventive feelings; but in general the
face is a pretty faithful index of the
mind.</P>
<P>I propose being in town in four or five
days.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>My mother has this moment a second
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from her relation, who is coming
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
home, and proposes a 'marriage between
me and his daughter, to whom he will
give twenty thousand pounds now, and
the rest of his fortune at his death.</P>
<P>As Emily's fault, if love can allow
her one, is an excess of romantic ge∣nerosity,
the fault of most uncorrupt∣ed
female minds, I am very anxious
to marry her before she knows of this
proposal, left she should think it a
proof of tenderness to aim at making
me wretched, in order to make me
rich.</P>
<P>I therefore entreat you and Mrs. Fitz∣gerald
to stay at Rose-hill, and prevent
her coming to town, till she is mine past
the power of retreat.</P>
<P>Our relation may have mentioned his
design to persons less prudent than our
little party; and she may hear of it, if she
is in London.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
But, independently of my fear of her
spirit of romance, I feel that it would be
an indelicacy to let her know of this pro∣posal
at present, and look like attempting
to make a merit of my refusal.</P>
<P>It is not to you, my dear friend, I need
say the gifts of fortune are nothing to me
without her for whose sake alone I wish
to possess them: you know my heart, and
you also know this is the sentiment of
every man who loves.</P>
<P>But I can with truth say much more;
I do not even wish an increase of for∣tune,
considering it abstractedly from
its being incompatible with my mar∣riage
with the loveliest of women; I
am indifferent to all but independence;
wealth would not make me happier;
on the contrary, it might break in on
my present little plan of enjoyment, by
forcing me to give to common ac∣quaintance,
of whom wealth will al∣ways
attract a crowd, those precious
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
hours devoted to friendship and domestic
pleasure.</P>
<P>I think my present income just what a
wise man would wish, and very sincerely
join in the philosophical prayer of the
royal prophet, “Give me neither poverty
nor riches.”</P>
<P>I love the vale, and had always an
aversion to very extensive prospects.</P>
<P>I will hasten my coming as much as
possible, and hope to be at Rose-hill on
Monday next: I shall be a prey to anxiety
till Emily is irrevocably mine.</P>
<P>Tell Mrs. Fitzgerald, I am all impa∣tience
to kiss her hand.</P>

<OPENER>To Captain FERMOR.
<DATELINE>Richmond, <DATE>Sept. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM this moment returned to Rich∣mond
from a journey: I am rejoiced
at your arrival, and impatient to see you;
for I am so happy as not to have out-lived
my impatience.</P>
<P>How is my little Bell? I am as much
in love with her as ever; this you will con∣ceal
from Captain Fitzgerald, lest he
should be alarmed, for I am as formidable
a rival as a man of fourscore can be sup∣posed
to be.</P>
<P>I am extremely obliged to you, my dear
Fermor, for having introduced me to a
very amiable man, in your friend Colonel
Rivers.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
I begin to be so sensible I am an old
fellow, that I feel a very lively degree of
gratitude to the young ones who visit me;
and look on every agreeable new acquain∣tance
under thirty as an acquisition I had
no right to expect.</P>
<P>You know I have always thought per∣sonal
advantages of much more real value
than accidental ones; and that those who
possessed the former had much the greatest
right to be proud.</P>
<P>Youth, health, beauty, understanding,
are substantial goods; wealth and title
comparatively ideal ones; I therefore
think a young man who condescends to vi∣sit
an old one, the healthy who visit the
sick, the man of sense who spends his time
with a fool, and even a handsome fellow
with an ugly one, are the persons who con∣fer
the favor, whatever difference there
may be in rank or fortune.</P>
<P>Colonel Rivers did me the honor to
spend a day with me here, and I have not
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
often lately passed a pleasanter one: the
desire I had not to discredit your partial
recommendation, and my very strong in∣clinations
to seduce him to come again,
made me intirely discard the old man; and
I believe your friend will tell you the hours
did not pass on leaden wings.</P>
<P>I expect you, with Mr. and Mrs. Fitz∣gerald,
to pass some time with me at Rich∣mond.</P>
<P>I have the best claret in the universe,
and as lively a relish for it as at five and
twenty.</P>

<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS, at Bellfield, Rutland.
<DATELINE>Rose-hill, <DATE>Sept. 18.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE I sent away my letter, I have
your last.</P>
<P>You tell me, my dear Rivers, the strong
emotion I betrayed at seeing Sir George,
when you came together to Montreal,
made you fear I loved him; that you were
jealous of the blush which glowed on my
cheek, when he entered the room: that
you still remember it with regret; that
you still fancy I had once some degree of
tenderness for him, and beg me to account
for the apparent confusion I betrayed at
his sight.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
I own that emotion; my confusion was
indeed too great to be concealed: but
was he alone, my Rivers? can you forget
that he had with him the most lovely of
mankind?</P>
<P>Sir George was handsome; I have often
regarded his person with admiration, but
it was the admiration we give to a statue.</P>
<P>I listened coldly to his love, I felt no
emotion at his sight; but when you ap∣peared,
my heart beat, I blushed, I turned
pale by turns, my eyes assumed a new soft∣ness,
I trembled, and every pulse confessed
the master of my soul.</P>
<P>My friends are come: I am called
down. Adieu! Be assured your Emily
never breathed a sigh but for her Rivers!</P>

<P>I HAVE this moment your letter; we
are setting out in ten minutes for Rose∣hill,
where I will finish this, and hope to
give you a pleasing account of your Emily.</P>
<P>You are certainly right in keeping this
proposal secret at present; depend on our
silence; I could, however, wish you the
fortune, were it possible to have it with∣out
the lady.</P>
<P>Were I to praise your delicacy on this
occasion, I should injure you; it was not
in your power to act differently; you are
only consistent with yourself.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
I am pleased with your idea of a situa∣tion:
a house embosomed in the grove,
where all the view is what the eye can
take in, speaks a happy master, content
at home; a wide-extended prospect, one
who is looking abroad for happiness.</P>
<P>I love the country: the taste for rural
scenes is the taste born with us. After
seeking pleasure in vain amongst the works
of art, we are forced to come back
to the point from whence we set out, and
find our enjoyment in the lovely simpli∣city
of nature.</P>
<P>Rose-hill, Evening.</P>
<P>I am afraid Emily knows your secret;
she has been in tears almost ever since we
came; the servant is going to the post∣office,

<P>It is to suspend our marriage for some

Be assured of my tenderness; be assured
my whole soul is yours, that you are

never woman loved; that I live, I breathe
but for you; that I would die to make
you happy.</P>
<P>In what words shall I convey to the
most beloved of his sex, the ardent ten∣derness
of my soul? how convince him of
what I suffer from being forced to make
a request so contrary to the dictates of
my heart?</P>
<P>He cannot, will not doubt his Emily's
affection: I cannot support the idea that it
is possible he should for one instant. What
I suffer at this moment is inexpressible.</P>
<P>My heart is too much agitated to say
more.</P>
<P>I will write again in a few days.</P>

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Sept. 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NO, Emily, you never loved; I have
been long hurt by your tranquillity
in regard to our marriage; your too scru∣pulous
attention to decorum in leaving
my sister's house might have alarmed me,
if love had not placed a bandage before
my eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27"/>
Cruel girl! I repeat it; you never
loved; I have your friendship, but you
know nothing of that ardent passion,
that dear enthusiasm, which makes us
indifferent to all but itself: your love
is from the imagination, not the heart.</P>
<P>The very professions of tenderness
in your last, are a proof of your
consciousness of indifference; you re∣peat
too often that you love me; you
say too much; that anxiety to per∣suade
me of your affection, shews too
plainly you are sensible I have reason to
doubt it.</P>
<P>You have placed me on the rack;
a thousand fears, a thousand doubts, suc∣ceed
each other in my soul. Has some
happier man—</P>
<P>No, my Emily, distracted as I am, I
will not be unjust: I do not suspect you
of inconstancy; 'tis of your coldness only
I complain: you never felt the lively im∣patience
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
of love; or you would not con∣demn
a man, whom you at least esteem, to
suffer longer its unutterable tortures.</P>
<P>If there is a real cause for this delay,
why conceal it from me? have I not a
right to know what so nearly interests me?
but what cause? are you not mistress of
yourself?</P>
<P>My Emily, you blush to own to me
the insensibility of your heart: you once
fancied you loved; you are ashamed to
say you were mistaken.</P>
<P>You cannot surely have been influenced
by any motive relative to our fortune; no
idle tale can have made you retract a pro∣mise,
which rendered me the happiest of
mankind: if I have your heart, I am
richer than an oriental monarch.</P>
<P>Short as life is, my dearest girl, is it of
consequence what part we play in it? is
wealth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all essential to happiness?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="29"/>
The tender affections are the only
sources of true pleasure; the highest, the
most respectable titles, in the eye of rea∣son,
are the tender ones of friend, of hus∣band,
and of father: it is from the dear
soft ties of social love your Rivers expects
his felicity.</P>
<P>You have but one way, my dear Emily,
to convince me of your tenderness: I
shall set off for Rose-hill in twelve hours;
you must give me your hand the moment
I arrive, or confess your Rivers was never
dear to you.</P>
<P>Write, and send a servant instantly to
meet me at my mother's house in town:
I cannot support the torment of sus∣pense.</P>
<P>There is not on earth so wretched a
being as I am at this moment; I never

must be mine, my Emily, or I must cease

<P>ALL I feared has certainly hap∣pened;
Emily has undoubtedly
heard of this proposal, and, from a
parade of generosity, a generosity how∣ever
inconsistent with love, wishes to
postpone our marriage till my relation
arrives.</P>
<P>I am hurt beyond words, at the

on this subject; I have, in regard to
Sir George, experienced that these are
not the sentiments of a heart truly
enamoured.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
I therefore fear this romantic step is the
effect of a coldness of which I thought
her incapable; and that her affection is
only a more lively degree of friendship,
with which, I will own to you, my heart
will not be satisfied.</P>
<P>I would engross, I would employ, I

<P>IS it then possible? can my Rivers
doubt his Emily's tenderness!</P>
<P>Do I only esteem you, my Rivers?
can my eyes have so ill explained the feel∣ings
of my heart?</P>
<P>You accuse me of not sharing your
impatience: do you then allow nothing
to the modesty, the blushing delicacy of
my sex?</P>
<P>Could you see into my soul, you would
cease to call me cold and insensible.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33"/>
Can you forget, my Rivers, those mo∣ments,
when, doubtful of the sentiments
of your heart, mine every instant betrayed
its weakness? when every look spoke the
resistless fondness of my soul! when, lost
in the delight of seeing you, I forgot I
was almost the wife of another?</P>
<P>But I will say no more; my Rivers tells
me I have already said too much: he is
displeased with his Emily's tenderness; he
complains, that I tell him too often I love
him.</P>
<P>You say I can give but one certain proof
of my affection.</P>
<P>I will give you that proof: I will be
yours whenever you please, though ruin
should be the consequence to both; I
despise every other consideration, when my
Rivers's happiness is at stake: is there
any request he is capable of making,
which his Emily will refuse?</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="34"/>
You are the arbiter of my fate: I
have no will but yours; yet I entreat
you to believe no common cause could
have made me hazard giving a mo∣ment's
pain to that dear bosom: you will
one time know to what excess I have
loved you.</P>
<P>Were the empire of the world or
your affection offered me, I should not
hesitate one moment on the choice,
even were I certain never to see you
more.</P>
<P>I cannot form an idea of happiness
equal to that of being beloved by the most
amiable of mankind.</P>
<P>Judge then, if I would lightly wish
to defer an event, which is to give
me the transport of passing my life in

<P>WHAT delight is there in obliging

<P>My heart dilated with joy at seeing
Emily pleased with the little embellish∣ments
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
of her apartment, which I had
made as gay and smiling as the mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
it looked, indeed, as if the hand of love
had adorned it: she has a dressing-room
and closet of books, into which I shall
never intrude; there is a pleasure in
having some place which we can say is
peculiarly our own, some <HI>sanctum sancto∣rum,</HI>
whither we can retire even from
those most dear to us.</P>
<P>This is a pleasure in which I have been
indulged almost from infancy, and there∣fore
one of the first I thought of procuring
for my sweet Emily.</P>
<P>I told her I should, however, sometimes
expect to be amongst her guests in this
little retirement.</P>
<P>Her look, her tender smile, the speak∣ing
glance of grateful love, gave me a
transport, which only minds turned to
affection can conceive. I never, my dear
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
Fitzgerald, was happy before: the attach∣ment
I once mentioned was pleasing; but
I felt a regret, at knowing the object of
my tenderness had forfeited the good
opinion of the world, which embittered
all my happiness.</P>
<P>She possessed my esteem, because I
knew her heart; but I wanted to see her
esteemed by others.</P>
<P>With Emily I enjoy this pleasure in its
utmost extent: she is the adoration of all
who see her; she is equally admired,
esteemed, respected.</P>
<P>She seems to value the admiration she
excites, only as it appears to gratify the
pride of her lover; what transport, when
all eyes are fixed on her, to see her search∣ing
around for mine, and attentive to no
other object, as if insensible to all other
approbation!</P>

I enjoy the pleasures of friendship as

<P>If I was not more a lover than a hus∣band,

To make me happy, you must place

<P>I AM very conscious, my dear Bell, of
not meriting the praises my Rivers la∣vishes
on me, yet the pleasure I receive
from them is not the less lively for that
consideration; on the contrary, the less I
deserve these praises, the more flattering
they are to me, as the stronger proofs of
his love; of that love which gives ideal
charms, which adorns, which embellishes
its object.</P>
<P>I had rather be lovely in his eyes, than
in those of all mankind; or, to speak more
exactly, if I continue to please him, the
admiration of all the world is indifferent
to me: it is for his sake alone I wish for
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
beauty, to justify the dear preference he
has given me.</P>
<P>How pleasing are these sweet shades!
were they less so, my Rivers's presence
would give them every charm: every ob∣ject
has appeared to me more lovely since
the dear moment when I first saw him; I
seem to have acquired a new existence
from his tenderness.</P>
<P>You say true, my dear Bell: Heaven
doubtless formed us to be happy even in
this world; and we obey its dictates in
being so, when we can without encroach∣ing
on the happiness of others.</P>
<P>This lesson is, I think, plain from the
book Providence has spread before us:
the whole universe smiles, the earth is
clothed in lively colors, the animals are
playful, the birds sing: in being chearful
with innocence, we seem to conform to the
order of nature, and the will of that bene∣ficent
Power to whom we owe our being.</P>

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Oct. 14.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU flatter me most agreeably, my
dear Fitzgerald, by praising Emily;
I want you to see her again; she is
every hour more charming: I am asto∣nished
any man can behold her with∣out
love.</P>
<P>Yet, lovely as she is, her beauty is her
least merit; the finest understanding, the
most pleasing kind of knowledge, tender∣ness,
sensibility, modesty, and truth, adorn
her almost with rays of divinity.</P>
<P>She has, beyond all I ever saw in either
sex, the polish of the world, without hav∣ing
lost that sweet simplicity of manner,
that unaffected innocence, and integrity of
<PB N="52" REF="54"/>
heart, which are so very apt to evaporate
in a crowd.</P>
<P>I ride out often alone, in order to
have the pleasure of returning to her:
these little absences give new spirit to
our tenderness. Every care forsakes me
at the sight of this temple of real love;
my sweet Emily meets me with smiles;
her eyes brighten when I approach;
she receives my friends with the most
lively pleasure, because they are my
friends; I almost envy them her atten∣tion,
though given for my sake.</P>
<P>Elegant in her dress and house, she
is all transport when any little orna∣ment
of either pleases me; but what
charms me most, is her tenderness for
my mother, in whose heart she rivals
both me and Lucy.</P>
<P>My happiness, my friend, is beyond
every idea I had formed; were I a little
richer, I should not have a wish remaining.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="55"/>
Do not, however, imagine this wish
takes from my felicity.</P>
<P>I have enough for myself, I have even
enough for Emily; love makes us in∣different
to the parade of life.</P>
<P>But I have not enough to entertain my
friends as I wish, nor to enjoy the god∣like
pleasure of beneficence.</P>
<P>We shall be obliged, in order to sup∣port
the little appearance necessary to our
connexions, to give an attention rather
too strict to our affairs; even this, how∣ever,
our affection for each other will
make easy to us.</P>
<P>My whole soul is so taken up with
this charming woman, I am afraid I
shall become tedious even to you; I
must learn to restrain my tenderness,
and write on common subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="56"/>
I am more and more pleased with the
way of life I have chose; and, were my
fortune ever so large, would pass the
greatest part of the year in the country:
I would only enlarge my house, and fill it
with friends.</P>
<P>My situation is a very fine one, though
not like the magnificent scenes to which
we have been accustomed in Canada:
the house stands on the sunny side of
a hill, at the foot of which, the garden
intervening, runs a little trout stream,
which to the right seems to be lost in an
island of oziers, and over which is a rustic
bridge into a very beautiful meadow,
where at present graze a numerous flock
of sheep.</P>
<P>Emily is planning a thousand em∣bellishments
for the garden, and will
next year make it a wilderness of sweets,
a paradise worthy its lovely inhabitant:
she is already forming walks and flowery
arbors in the wood, and giving the whole
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
scene every charm which taste, at little
expence, can bestow.</P>
<P>I, on my side, am selecting spots for
plantations of trees; and mean, like a
good citizen, to serve at once myself
and the public, by raising oaks, which
may hereafter bear the British thunder to
distant lands.</P>
<P>I believe we country gentlemen, whilst
we have spirit to keep ourselves indepen∣dent,
are the best citizens, as well as sub∣jects,
in the world.</P>
<P>Happy ourselves, we wish not to de∣stroy
the tranquillity of others; intent on
cares equally useful and pleasing, with no
views but to improve our fortunes by
means equally profitable to ourselves
and to our country, we form no schemes
of dishonest ambition; and therefore dis∣turb
no government to serve our private
designs.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="58"/>
It is the profuse, the vicious, the profli∣gate,
the needy, who are the Clodios and
Catilines of this world.</P>
<P>That love of order, of moral harmony,
so natural to virtuous minds, to minds at
ease, is the strongest tie of rational obe∣dience.</P>
<P>The man who feels himself prospe∣rous
and happy, will not easily be per∣swaded
by factious declamation that he
is undone.</P>
<P>Convinced of the excellency of our
constitution, in which liberty and prero∣gative
are balanced with the steadiest
hand, he will not endeavor to remove
the boundaries which secure both: he will
not endeavor to root it up, whilst he is
pretending to give it nourishment: he
will not strive to cut down the lovely and
venerable tree under whose shade he en∣joys
security and peace.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="59"/>
In short, and I am sure you will here be
of my opinion, the man who has compe∣tence,
virtue, true liberty, and the woman
he loves, will chearfully obey the laws
which secure him these blessings, and the
prince under whose mild sway he enjoys
them.</P>

<P>I EVERY hour see more strongly, my
dear Fitzgerald, the wisdom, as to our
own happiness, of not letting our hearts
be worn out by a multitude of intrigues
before marriage.</P>
<P>Temple loves my sister, he is happy
with her; but his happiness is by no means
of the same kind with yours and mine;
she is beautiful, and he thinks her so;
she is amiable, and he esteems her; he
prefers her to all other women, but he
feels nothing of that trembling delicacy
of sentiment, that quick sensibility, which
gives to love its most exquisite pleasures,
and which I would not give up for the
wealth of worlds.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61"/>
His affection is meer passion, and there∣fore
subject to change; ours is that heart∣felt
tenderness, which time renders every
moment more pleasing.</P>
<P>The tumult of desire is the fever of
the soul; its health, that delicious tran∣quillity
where the heart is gently moved,
not violently agitated; that tranquillity
which is only to be found where friend∣ship
is the basis of love, and where we
are happy without injuring the object be∣loved:
in other words, in a marriage of
choice.</P>
<P>In the voyage of life, passion is the
tempest, love the gentle gale.</P>
<P>Dissipation, and a continual round of
amusements at home, will probably se∣cure
my sister all of Temple's heart which
remains; but his love would grow lan∣guid
in that state of retirement, which
would have a thousand charms for minds

<DATE>Oct. 19.</DATE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING, my dear Rivers, shews
the value of friendship more than
the envy it excites.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="63"/>
The world will sooner pardon us any
advantage, even wealth, genius, or beauty,
than that of having a faithful friend;
every selfish bosom swells with envy at the
sight of those social connexions, which are
the cordials of life, and of which our
narrow prejudices alone prevent our en∣joyment.</P>
<P>Those who have neither hearts to feel
this generous affection, nor merit to de∣serve
it, hate all who are in this respect
happier than themselves; they look on a
friend as an invaluable blessing, and a
blessing out of their reach; and abhor all
who possess the treasure for which they
sigh in vain.</P>
<P>For my own part, I had rather be the
dupe of a thousand false professions of
friendship, than, for fear of being de∣ceived,
give up the pursuit.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="64"/>
Dupes are happy at least for a time;
but the cold, narrow, suspicious heart ne∣ver
knows the glow of social pleasure.</P>
<P>In the same proportion as we lose our
confidence in the virtues of others, we lose
our proper happiness.</P>
<P>The observation of this mean jealousy,
so humiliating to human nature, has in∣fluenced
Lord Halifax, in his Advice to
a Daughter, the school of art, prudery,
and selfish morals, to caution her against
all friendships, or, as he calls them, <HI>dear∣nesses,</HI>
as what will make the world envy
and hate her.</P>
<P>After my sweet Bell's tenderness, I
know no pleasure equal to your friend∣ship;
nor would I give it up for the reve∣nue
of an eastern monarch.</P>
<P>I esteem Temple, I love his conversa∣tion;
he is gay and amusing; but I shall
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
never have for him the affection I feel for
you.</P>
<P>I think you are too apprehensive in re∣gard
to your sister's happiness: he loves
her, and there is a certain variety in
her manner, a kind of agreeable ca∣price,
that I think will secure the heart
of a man of his turn, much more than
her merit, or even the loveliness of her
person.</P>
<P>She is handsome, exquisitely so; hand∣somer
than Bell, and, if you will allow
me to say so, than Emily.</P>
<P>I mean, that she is so in the eye of
a painter; for in that of a lover his
mistress is the only beautiful object on
earth.</P>
<P>I allow your sister to be very lovely,
but I think Bell more desireable a thou∣sand
times; and, rationally speaking, she
who has, <HI>as to me,</HI> the art of inspiring
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
the most tenderness is, <HI>as to me,</HI> to all
intents and purposes the most beautiful
woman.</P>
<P>In which faith I choose to live and die.</P>
<P>I have an idea, Rivers, that you and I
shall continue to be happy: a real sym∣pathy,
a lively taste, mixed with esteem,
led us to marry; the delicacy, tenderness,
and virtue, of the two most charming of
women, promise to keep our love alive.</P>
<P>We have both strong affections: both
love the conversation of women; and nei∣ther
of our hearts are depraved by ill∣chosen

<P>I DIE to come to Bellfield again, my
dear Rivers; I have a passion for
your little wood; it is a mighty pretty
wood for an English wood, but nothing
to your Montmorencis; the dear little
Silleri too—</P>
<P>But to return to the shades of Bellfield:
your little wood is charming indeed; not
to particularize detached pieces of your
scenery, the <HI>tout ensemble</HI> is very in∣viting;
observe, however, I have to
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
notion of paradise without an Adam, and
therefore shall bring Fitzgerald with me
next time.</P>
<P>What could induce you, with this sweet
little retreat, to cross that vile ocean to
Canada? I am astonished at the madness
of mankind, who can expose themselves
to pain, misery, and danger; and range
the world from motives of avarice and
ambition, when the rural cot, the fan∣ning
gale, the clear stream, and flowery
bank, offer such delicious enjoyments at
home.</P>
<P>You men are horrid, rapacious animals,
with your spirit of enterprize, and your
nonsense: ever wanting more land than
you can cultivate, and more money than
you can spend.</P>
<P>That eternal pursuit of gain, that rage
of accumulation, in which you are edu∣cated,
corrupts your hearts, and robs you
of half the pleasures of life.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="69"/>
I should not, however, make so free
with the sex, if you and my <HI>caro sposo</HI> were
not exceptions.</P>
<P>You two have really something of the
sensibility and generosity of women.</P>
<P>Do you know, Rivers, I have a fancy
you and Fitzgerald will always be happy
husbands? this is something owing to
yourselves, and something to us; you
have both that manly tenderness, and
true generosity, which inclines you to
love creatures who have paid you the
compliment of making their happiness or
misery depend entirely on you, and partly
to the little circumstance of your being
married to two of the most agreeable wo∣men
breathing.</P>
<P>To speak <HI>en philosophe,</HI> my dear Rivers,
you are not to be told, that the fire of
love, like any other fire, is equally put
out by too much or too little fuel.</P>

sensible, to say nothing of our pleasing
kind of sensibility, have a certain just idea
of causes and effects, with a natural blush∣ing
reserve, and bridal delicacy, which I
am apt to flatter myself—</P>
<P>Do you understand me, Rivers? I
am not quite clear I understand my∣self.</P>
<P>All that I would insinuate is, that Emily
and I are, take us for all in all, the two
most charming women in the world, and
that, whoever leaves us, must change im∣mensely
for the worse.</P>
<P>I believe Lucy equally pleasing, but I
think her charms have not so good a sub∣ject
to work upon.</P>
<P>Temple is a handsome fellow, and loves
her; but he has not the tenderness of
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
heart that I so much admire in two certain
youths of my acquaintance.</P>
<P>He is rich indeed; but who cares?</P>
<P>Certainly, my dear Rivers, nothing can
be more absurd, or more destructive to
happiness, than the very wrong turn we
give our childrens imaginations about
marriage.</P>
<P>If miss and master are good, she is pro∣mised
a rich husband, and a coach and six,
and he a wise with a monstrous great for∣tune.</P>
<P>Most of these fine promises must fail;
and where they do not, the poor things
have only the consolation of finding, when
too late to retreat, that the objects to
which all their wishes were pointed have
really nothing to do with happiness.</P>
<P>Is there a nabobess on earth half as
happy as the two foolish little girls about
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
whom I have been writing, though mar∣ried
to such poor devils as you and Fitz∣gerald?
<HI>Certainement</HI> no.</P>
<CLOSER>And so ends my sermon.

<HEAD>LETTER CCI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To JOHN TEMPLE, Es{que} Temple-house,
Rutland.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Oct. 21.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU ridicule my enthusiasm, my dear
Temple, without considering there
is no exertion of the human mind, no effort
of the understanding, imagination, or
heart, without a spark of this divine fire.</P>
<P>Without enthusiasm, genius, virtue,
pleasure, even love itself, languishes; all
that refines, adorns, softens, exalts, enno∣bles
life, has its source in this animating
principle.</P>
<P>I glory in being an enthusiast in every
thing; but in nothing so much as in my
tenderness for this charming woman.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="74"/>
I am a perfect Quixote in love, and
would storm enchanted castles, and fight
giants, for my Emily.</P>
<P>Coldness of temper damps every spring
that moves the human heart; it is equally
an enemy to pleasure, riches, fame, to all
which is worth living for.</P>
<P>I thank you for your wishes that I was
rich, but am by no means anxious myself
on the subject.</P>
<P>You sons of fortune, who possess
your thousands a year, and find them
too little for your desires, desires
which grow from that very abundance,
imagine every man miserable who
wants them; in which you are greatly
mistaken.</P>
<P>Every real pleasure is within the reach
of my little fortune, and I am very indif∣ferent
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
about those which borrow their
charms, not from nature, but from fashion
and caprice.</P>
<P>My house is indeed less than yours;
but it is finely situated, and large enough
for my fortune: that part of it which
belongs peculiarly to my Emily is ele∣gant.</P>
<P>I have an equipage, not for parade
but use; and the loveliest of women
prefers it with me to all that luxury
and magnificence could bestow with
another.</P>
<P>The flowers in my garden bloom
as fair, the peach glows as deep, as
in yours: does a flower blush more
lovely, or smell more sweet; a peach
look more tempting than its fellows, I
select it for my Emily, who receives
it with delight, as the tender tribute
of love.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>
In some respects, we are the more
happy for being less rich: the little
avocations, which our mediocrity of for∣tune
makes necessary to both, are the
best preventives of that languor, from
being too constantly together, which is
all that love founded on taste and friend∣ship
has to fear.</P>
<P>Had I my choice, I should wish for
a very small addition only to my in∣come,
and that for the sake of others,
not myself.</P>
<P>I love pleasure, and think it our
duty to make life as agreeable as is con∣sistent
with what we owe to others;
but a true pleasurable philosopher seeks
his enjoyments where they are really
to be found; not in the gratifications
of a childish pride, but of those affec∣tions
which are born with us, and which
are the only rational sources of enjoy∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
When I am walking in these deli∣cious
shades with Emily; when I see
those lovely eyes, softened with art∣less
fondness, and hear the music of
that voice; when a thousand trifles, un∣observed
but by the prying sight of
love, betray all the dear sensations of
that bosom, where truth and delicate
tenderness have fixed their seat, I know
not the Epicurean of whom I do not de∣serve
to be the envy.</P>
<P>Does your fortune, my dear Temple,
make you more than happy? if not
why so very earnestly wish an addition
to mine? believe me, there is nothing
about which I am more indifferent. I
am ten times more anxious to get the
finest collection of flowers in the world
for my Emily.</P>
<P>You observe justly, that there is no∣thing
so insipid as women who have con∣versed
with women only; let me add,
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
nor so brutal as men who have lived
only amongst men.</P>
<P>The desire of pleasing on each side, in
an intercourse enlivened by taste, and go∣verned
by delicacy and honor, calls forth
all the graces of the person and under∣standing,
all the amiable sentiments of
the heart: it also gives good-breeding,
ease, and a certain awakened manner,
which is not to be acquired but in mixed
conversation.</P>
<P>Remember, you and my dear Lucy dine
with us to-morrow; it is to be a little
family party, to indulge my mother in
the delight of seeing her children about
her, without interruption: I have saved
all my best fruit for this day; we are
to drink tea and sup in Emily's apart∣ment.</P>

<P>I will to-morrow shew you better grapes
than any you have at Temple-house: you
rich men fancy nobody has any thing good
but yourselves; but I hope next year
to shew you that you are mistaken in a
thousand instances. I will have such
roses and jessamines, such bowers of in∣ter
mingled sweets—you shall see what
astonishing things Emily's taste and my
industry can do.</P>

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Oct. 22.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>FINISH your business, my dear girl,
and let us see you again at Bellfield.
I need not tell you the pleasure Mr.
Fitzgerald's accompanying you will give
us.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="80"/>
I die to see you, my dear Bell; it is
not enough to be happy, unless I have
somebody to tell every moment that I
am so: I want a confidante of my ten∣derness,
a friend like my Bell, indul∣gent
to all my follies, to talk to of
the loveliest and most beloved of man∣kind.
I want to tell you a thousand
little instances of that ardent, that re∣fined
affection, which makes all the
happiness of my life! I want to paint
the flattering attention, the delicate fond∣ness
of that dear lover, who is only the
more so for being a husband.</P>
<P>You are the only woman on earth to
whom I can, without the appearance of
insult, talk of my Rivers, because you are
the only one I ever knew as happy as
myself.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald, in the tenderness and deli∣cacy
of his mind, resembles strongly—
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
I am interrupted: Adieu! for a moment.</P>
<P>It was my Rivers, he brought me a bou∣quet;
I opened the door, supposing it was
my mother; conscious of what I had been
writing, I was confused at seeing him; he
smiled, and guessing the reason of my em∣barrassment,
“I must leave you, Emily;
you are writing, and, by your blushes,
I know you have been talking of your
lover.”</P>
<P>I should have told you, he insists on
never seeing the letters I write, and gives
this reason for it, That he should be a
great loser by seeing them, as it would
restrain my pen when I talk of him.</P>
<P>I believe, I am very foolish in my ten∣derness;
but you will forgive me.</P>
<P>Rivers yesterday was throwing flowers
at me and Lucy, in play, as we were
walking in the garden; I catched a wall-flower,
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
and, by an involuntary impulse,
kissed it, and placed it in my bosom.</P>
<P>He observed me, and his look of plea∣sure
and affection is impossible to be de∣scribed.
What exquisite pleasure there is
in these agreeable follies!</P>
<P>He is the sweetest trifler in the world,
my dear Bell: but in what does he not
excel all mankind!</P>
<P>As the season of autumnal flowers is
almost over, he is sending for all those
which blow early in the spring: he pre∣vents
every wish his Emily can form.</P>
<P>Did you ever, my dear, see so fine an
autumn as this? you will, perhaps, smile
when I say, I never saw one so pleasing;
such a season is more lovely than even the
spring: I want you down before this
agreeable weather is all over.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="83"/>
I am going to air with my mother; my
Rivers attends us on horseback; you can∣not
think how amiable his attention is to
both.</P>

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Oct. 24.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SOME author has said, “The happi∣ness
of the next world, to the vir∣tuous,
will consist in enjoying the society
of minds like their own.”</P>
<P>Why then should we not do our best to
possess as much as possible of this happi∣ness
here?</P>
<P>You will see this is a preface to a very
earnest request to see Captain Fermor and
the lovely Bell immediately at our farm:
take notice, I will not admit even business
as an excuse much longer.</P>
<P>I am just come from a walk in the
wood behind the house, with my mother
<PB N="83" REF="85"/>
and Emily; I want you to see it before
it loses all its charms; in another fort∣night,
its present variegated foliage will
be literally <HI>humbled in the dust.</HI></P>
<P>There is something very pleasing in
this season, if it did not give us the
idea of the winter, which is approaching
too fast.</P>
<P>The dryness of the air, the soft western
breeze, the tremulous motion of the fall∣ing
leaves, the rustling of those already
fallen under our feet, their variety of
lively colors, give a certain spirit and agree∣able
fluctuation to the scene, which is un∣speakably pleasing.</P>
<P>By the way, we people of warm ima∣ginations
have vast advantages over
others; we scorn to be confined to pre∣sent
scenes, or to give attention to such
trifling objects as times and seasons.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="86"/>
I already anticipate the spring; see the
woodbines and wild roses bloom in my
grove, and almost catch the gale of per∣fume.</P>
<P>Twelve o'clock.</P>
<P>I have this moment received your letter.</P>
<P>I am sorry for what you tell me of Miss
H—; whose want of art has led her
into indiscretions.</P>
<P>'Tis too common to see the most inno∣cent,
nay, even the most laudable actions
censured by the world; as we cannot,
however, eradicate the prejudices of
others, it is wisdom to yield to them in
things which are indifferent.</P>
<P>One ought to conform to, and respect
the customs, as well as the laws and reli∣gion
of our country, where they are not
contrary to virtue, and to that moral sense
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
which Heaven has imprinted on our souls;
where they are contrary, every generous
mind will despise them.</P>
<P>I agree with you, my dear friend, that
two persons who love, not only <HI>seem,</HI> but
really are, handsomer to each other than
to the rest of the world.</P>
<P>When we look at those we ardently
love, a new softness steals unperceived
into the eyes, the countenance is more
animated, and the whole form has that air
of tender languor which has such charms
for sensible minds.</P>
<P>To prove the truth of this, my Emily
approaches, fair as the rising morn, led by
the hand of the Graces; she fees her lover,
and every charm is redoubled; an invo∣luntary
smile, a blush of pleasure, speak
a passion, which is the pride of my soul.</P>
<P>Even her voice, melodious as it is by
nature, is softened when she addresses her
happy Rivers.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="88"/>
She comes to ask my attendance on her
and my mother; they are going to pay a
morning visit a few miles off.</P>

hand.

<HEAD>LETTER CCIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
Three o'clock.</OPENER>
<P>WE are returned, and have met
with an adventure, which I must
tell you.</P>
<P>About six miles from home, at the en∣trance
of a small village, as I was riding
very fast, a little before the chaise, a boy
about four years old, beautiful as a Cupid,
came out of a cottage on the right-hand,
and, running cross the road, fell almost
under my horse's feet.</P>
<P>I threw myself off in a moment; and
snatching up the child, who was, however,
unhurt, carried him to the house.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
I was met at the door by a young wo∣man,
plainly drest; but of a form un∣commonly
elegant: she had seen the
child fall, and her terror for him was
plainly marked in her countenance; she
received him from me, pressed him to her
bosom, and, without speaking, melted
into tears.</P>
<P>My mother and Emily had by this time
reached the cottage; the humanity of both
was too much interested to let them pass:
they alighted, came into the house, and
enquired about the child, with an air of
tenderness which was not lost on the
young person, whom we supposed his
mother.</P>
<P>She appeared about two and twenty,
was handsome, with an air of the world,
which the plainness of her dress could
not hide; her countenance was pensive,
with a mixture of sensibility which in∣stantly
prejudiced us all in her favor;
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
her look seemed to say, she was un∣happy,
and that she deserved to be
otherwise.</P>
<P>Her manner was respectful, but easy
and unconstrained; polite, without being
servile; and she acknowledged the interest
we all seemed to take in what related to
her, in a manner that convinced us she
deserved it.</P>
<P>Though every thing about us, the
extreme neatness, the elegant simpli∣city
of her house and little garden, her
own person, that of the child, both per∣fectly
genteel, her politeness, her air
of the world, in a cottage like that of
the meanest laborer, tended to excite
the most lively curiosity; neither good-breeding,
humanity, nor the respect
due to those who appear unfortunate,
would allow us to make any enquiries:
we left the place full of this adventure,
convinced of the merit, as well as un∣happiness,
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
of its fair inhabitant, and re∣solved
to find out, if possible, whether
her misfortunes were of a kind to be alle∣viated,
and within our little power to al∣leviate.</P>
<P>I will own to you, my dear Fitzgerald,
I at that moment felt the smallness of my
fortune: and I believe Emily had the
same sensations, though her delicacy pre∣vented
her naming them to me, who have
made her poor.</P>
<P>We can talk of nothing but the
stranger; and Emily is determined to
call on her again to-morrow, on pretence
of enquiring after the health of the
child.</P>
<P>I tremble lest her story, for she cer∣tainly
has one, should be such as, how∣ever
it may entitle her to compassion, may
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
make it impossible for Emily to shew it in
the manner she seems to wish.</P>

<P>WE have been again at the cottage;
and are more convinced than ever,
that this amiable girl is not in the station
in which she was born; we staid two hours,
and varied the conversation in a manner
which, in spite of her extreme modesty,
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
made it impossible for her to avoid shew∣ing
she had been educated with uncom∣mon
care: her style is correct and ele∣gant;
her sentiments noble, yet unaf∣fected;
we talked of books, she said
little on the subject; but that little shew∣ed
a taste which astonished us.</P>
<P>Anxious as we are to know her true
situation, in order, if she merits it, to
endeavor to serve her, yet delicacy
made it impossible for us to give the
least hint of a curiosity which might
make her suppose we entertained ideas to
her prejudice.</P>
<P>She seemed greatly affected with the
humane concern Emily expressed for
the child's danger yesterday, as well as
with the polite and even affectionate
manner in which she appeared to interest
herself in all which related to her;
Emily made her general offers of ser∣vice
with a timid kind of softness in
her air, which seemed to speak rather
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
a person asking a favor than wishing to
confer an obligation.</P>
<P>She thanked my sweet Emily with a
look of surprize and gratitude to which it
is not easy to do justice; there was, how∣ever,
an embarrassment in her countenance
at those offers, which a little alarms me;
she absolutely declined coming to Bell∣field:
I know not what to think.</P>
<P>Emily, who has taken a strong preju∣dice
in her favor, will answer for her con∣duct
with her life; but I will own to you,
I am not without my doubts.</P>
<P>When I consider the inhuman arts of
the abandoned part of one sex, and the
romantic generosity and too unguarded
confidence, of the most amiable of the
other; when I reflect that where women
love, they love without reserve; that
they fondly imagine the man who is dear
to them possessed of every virtue; that
their very integrity of mind prevents
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
their suspicions; when I think of her
present retirement, so apparently ill suited
to her education; when I see her beau∣ty,
her elegance of person, with that
tender and melancholy air, so strongly
expressive of the most exquisite sensi∣bility;
when, in short, I see the child,
and observe her fondness for him, I
have fears for her, which I cannot con∣quer.</P>
<P>I am as firmly convinced as Emily of
the goodness of her heart; but I am
not so certain that even that very good∣ness
may not have been, from an unhappy
concurrence of circumstances, her misfor∣tune.</P>
<P>We have company to dine.</P>
<P>Adieu! till the evening.</P>

<OPENER>“To Mrs. RIVERS.
<SALUTE>“Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>“Though I have every reason to
wish the melancholy event which
brought me here, might continue un∣known;
yet your generous concern
for a stranger, who had no recom∣mendation
to your notice but her ap∣pearing
unhappy, and whose suspi∣cious
situation would have injured her
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
in a mind less noble than yours, has
determined me to lay before you a
story, which it was my resolution to
conceal for ever.”</P>
<P>“I saw, Madam, in your counte∣nance,
when you honored me by
calling at my house this morning, and
I saw with an admiration no words
can speak, the amiable struggle be∣tween
the desire of knowing the na∣ture
of my distress in order to soften
it, and the delicacy which forbad your
enquiries, lest they should wound my
sensibility and self-love.”</P>
<P>“To such a heart I run no hazard in
relating what in the world would, per∣haps,
draw on me a thousand reproaches;
reproaches, however, I slatter myself,
undeserved.”</P>
<P>“You have had the politeness to say,
there is something in my appearance
which speaks my birth above my pre∣sent
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
situation: in this, Madam, I am
so happy as not to deceive your gene∣rous
partiality.”</P>
<P>“My father, who was an officer of
family and merit, had the misfortune
to lose my mother whilst I was an in∣fant.”</P>
<P>“He had the goodness to take on
himself the care of directing my edu∣cation,
and to have me taught what∣ever
he thought becoming my sex,
though at an expence much too great
for his income.”</P>
<P>“As he had little more than his com∣mission,
his parental tenderness got so
far the better of his love for his pro∣fession,
that, when I was about fifteen,
he determined on quitting the army, in
order to provide better for me; but,
whilst he was in treaty for this purpose,
a fever carried him off in a few days,
and left me to the world, with little
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
more than five hundred pounds, which,
however, was, by his will, immediately
in my power.”</P>
<P>“I felt too strongly the loss of this
excellent parent to attend to any
other consideration; and, before I was
enough myself to think what I was
to do for a subsistence, a friend of
my own age, whom I tenderly loved,
who was just returning from school
to her father's, in the north of Eng∣land,
insisted on my accompanying her,
and spending some time with her in the
country.”</P>
<P>“I found in my dear Sophia, all the
consolation my grief could receive;
and, at her pressing solicitation, and
that of her father, who saw his daugh∣ter's
happiness depended on having me
with her, I continued there three
years, blest in the calm delights of
friendship, and those blameless plea∣sures,
with which we should be too
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
happy, if the heart could content itself,
when a young baronet, whose form
was as lovely as his soul was dark, came
to interrupt our felicity.”</P>
<P>“My Sophia, at a ball, had the mis∣fortune
to attract his notice; she was
rather handsome, though without re∣gular
features; her form was elegant
and feminine, and she had an air of
youth, of softness, of sensibility, of
blushing innocence, which seemed in∣tended
to inspire delicate passions alone,
and which would have disarmed any
mind less depraved than that of the
man, who only admired to destroy.”</P>
<P>“She was the rose-bud yet impervious
to the sun.”</P>
<P>“Her heart was tender, but had never
met an object which seemed worthy of
it; her sentiments were disinterested,
and romantic to excess.”</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102"/>
“Her father was, at that time, in
Holland, whither the death of a re∣lation,
who had left him a small
estate, had called him: we were alone,
unprotected, delivered up to the un∣happy
inexperience of youth, mistresses
of our own conduct; myself, the
eldest of the two, but just eighteen,
when my Sophia's ill fate conducted
Sir Charles Verville to the ball where
she first saw him.”</P>
<P>“He danced with her, and endeavored
to recommend himself by all those
little unmeaning, but flattering atten∣tions,
by which our credulous sex are
so often misled; his manner was ten∣der,
yet timid, modest, respectful; his
eyes were continually fixed on her, but
when he met hers, artfully cast down,
as if afraid of offending.”</P>
<P>“He asked permission to enquire after
her health the next day; he came, he
was enchanting, polite, lively, soft,
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
insinuating, adorned with every out∣ward
grace which could embellish
virtue, or hide vice from view; to
see and to love him was almost the
same thing.”</P>
<P>“He entreated leave to continue his
visits, which he found no difficulty in
obtaining: during two months, not a
day passed without our seeing him; his
behaviour was such as would scarce
have alarmed the most suspicious heart;
what then could be expected of us,
young, sincere, totally ignorant of the
world, and strongly prejudiced in fa∣vor
of a man, whose conversation spoke
his soul the abode of every virtue?”</P>
<P>“Blushing I must own, nothing but
the apparent preference he gave to my
lovely friend, could have saved my
heart from being a prey to the same
tenderness which ruined her.”</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="104"/>
“He addressed her with all the spe∣cious
arts which vice could invent to
seduce innocence; his respect, his
esteem, seemed equal to his passion;
he talked of honor, of the delight of
an union where the tender affections
alone were consulted; wished for her
father's return, to ask her of him in
marriage; pretended to count impa∣tiently
the hours of his absence, which
delayed his happiness: he even pre∣vailed
on her to write her father an ac∣count
of his addresses.”</P>
<P>“New to love, my Sophia's young
heart too easily gave way to the soft im∣pression;
she loved, she idolized this
most base of mankind; she would have
thought it a kind of sacrilege to have
had any will in opposition to his.”</P>
<P>“After some months of unremitted
assiduity, her father being expected in
a few days, he dropped a hint, as if by
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
accident, that he wished his fortune less,
that he might be the more certain he was
loved for himself alone; he blamed him∣self
for this delicacy, but charged it on
excess of love; vowed he would rather
die than injure her, yet wished to be
convinced her fondness was without re∣serve.”</P>
<P>“Generous, disinterested, eager to
prove the excess and sincerity of her
passion, she fell into the snare; she
agreed to go off with him, and
live some time in a retirement where
she was to see only himself, after
which he engaged to marry her pub∣licly.”</P>
<P>“He pretended ecstasies at this proof
of affection, yet hesitated to accept
it; and, by piquing the generosity
of her soul, which knew no guile,
and therefore suspected none, led her
to insist on devoting herself to wretch
edness.”</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="106"/>
“In order, however, that this step
might be as little known as possible,
as he pretended the utmost concern
for that honor he was contriving
to destroy, it was agreed between
them, that he should go immediately
to London, and that she should fol∣low
him, under pretence of a visit to
a relation at some distance; the great∣est
difficulty was, how to hide this
design from me.”</P>
<P>“She had never before concealed
a thought from her beloved Fanny;
nor could he now have prevailed
on her to deceive me, had he not
artfully perswaded her I was myself
in love with him; and that, there∣fore,
it would be cruel, as well as
imprudent, to trust me with the
secret.”</P>
<P>“Nothing shews so strongly the power
of love, in absorbing every faculty of
the soul, as my dear Sophia's being
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
prevailed on to use art with the friend
most dear to her on earth.”</P>
<P>“By an unworthy piece of deceit,
I was sent to a relation for some
weeks; and the next day Sophia
followed her infamous lover, leaving
letters for me and her father, calcu∣lated
to perswade us, they were pri∣vately
married.”</P>
<P>“My distress, and that of the un∣happy
parent, may more easily be
conceived than described; severe by
nature, he cast her from his heart
and fortune for ever, and settled his
estate on a nephew, then at the uni∣versity.”</P>
<P>“As to me, grief and tenderness
were the only sensations I felt: I
went to town, and took every pri∣vate
method to discover her retreat,
but in vain; till near a year after,
when, being in London, with a friend
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
of my mother's, a servant, who had
lived with my Sophia, saw me in the
street, and knew me: by her means,
I discovered that she was in distress,
abandoned by her lover, in that mo∣ment
when his tenderness was most
necessary.”</P>
<P>“I flew to her, and found her in
a miserable apartment, in which no∣thing
but an extreme neatness would
have made me suppose she had ever
seen happier days: the servant who
brought me to her attended her.”</P>
<P>“She was in bed, pale, emaciated;
the lovely babe you saw with me in
her arms.”</P>
<P>“Though prepared for my visit, she
was unable to bear the shock of
seeing me; I ran to her, she raised
herself in the bed, and, throw∣ing
her seeble arms round my
neck, could only say,” “My Fanny!
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
is this possible!” “and fainted a∣way.”</P>
<P>“Our cares having recovered her,
she endeavored to compose herself;
her eyes were fixed tenderly on me,
she pressed my hand between hers,
the tears stole silently down her cheeks;
she looked at her child, then at me;
she would have spoke, but the feel∣ings
of her heart were too strong for
expression.”</P>
<P>“I begged her to be calm, and promis∣ed
to spend the day with her; I did
not yet dare, lest the emotion should
be too much for her weak state, to tell
her we would part no more.”</P>
<P>“I took a room in the house, and de∣termined
to give all my attention to
the restoration of her health; after
which, I hoped to contrive to make
my little fortune, with industry, sup∣port
us both.”</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110"/>
“I sat up with her that night;
she got a little rest, she seemed bet∣ter
in the morning; she told me
the particulars I have already relat∣ed;
she, however, endeavored to sof∣ten
the cruel behaviour of the wretch,
whose name I could not hear with∣out
horror.”</P>
<P>“She had in the afternoon a little
fever; I sent for a physician, he
thought her in danger; what did not
my heart feel from this information?
she grew worse, I never left her one
moment.”</P>
<P>“The next morning she called me
to her; she took my hand, and look∣ing
at me with a tenderness no lan∣guage
can describe,”</P>
<P>““My dear, my only friend, said she,
I am dying; you are come to receive the
last breath of your unhappy Sophia: I
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
wish with ardor for my father's bles∣sing
and forgiveness, but dare not ask
them.”</P>
<P>“The weakness of my heart has un∣done
me; I am lost, abandoned by
him on whom my soul doated; by
him, for whom I would have sacrificed
a thousand lives; he has left me with
my babe to perish, yet I still love
him with unabated fondness: the
pang of losing him sinks me to the
grave!””</P>
<P>“Her speech here failed her for a time;
but recovering, she proceeded,”</P>
<P>““Hard as this request may seem, and
to whatever miseries it may expose my
angel friend, I adjure you not to desert
my child; save him from the wretch∣edness
that threatens him; let him find
in you a mother not less tender, but
more virtuous, than his own.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="112"/>
“I know, my Fanny, I undo you by
this cruel confidence; but who else
will have mercy on this innocent?””</P>
<P>“Unable to answer, my heart torn
with unutterable anguish, I snatched
the lovely babe to my bosom, I
kissed him, I bathed him with my
tears.”</P>
<P>“She understood me, a gleam of
pleasure brightened her dying eyes,
the child was still pressed to my heart,
she gazed on us both with a look of
wild affection; then, clasping her
hands together, and breathing a fer∣vent
prayer to Heaven, sunk down,
and expired without a groan—”</P>
<P>“To you, Madam, I need not say
the rest.”</P>
<P>“The eloquence of angels could not
paint my distress; I saw the friend of
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
my soul, the best and most gentle of
her sex, a breathless corse before me;
her heart broke by the ingratitude of
the man she loved, her honor the sport
of fools, her guiltless child a sharer in
her shame.”</P>
<P>“And all this ruin brought on by a
sensibility of which the best minds alone
are susceptible, by that noble integrity
of soul which made it impossible for her
to suspect another.”</P>
<P>“Distracted with grief, I kissed my
Sophia's pale lips, talked to her lifeless
form; I promised to protect the sweet
babe, who smiled on me, and with his
little hand pressed mine, as if sensible of
what I said.”</P>
<P>“As soon as my grief was enough
calmed to render me capable of any
thing, I wrote an account of So∣phia's
death to her father, who had
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
the inhumanity to refuse to see her
child.”</P>
<P>“I disdained an application to her
murderer; and retiring to this place,
where I was, and resolved to conti∣nue,
unknown, determined to devote
my life to the sweet infant, and to
support him by an industry which
I did not doubt Heaven would
prosper.”</P>
<P>“The faithful girl who had attended
Sophia, begged to continue with me;
we work for the milleners in the neigh∣bouring
towns, and, with the little pit∣tance
I have, keep above want.”</P>
<P>“I know the consequence of what I
have undertaken; I know I give up
the world and all hopes of happiness
to myself: yet will I not desert this
friendless little innocent, nor betray
the confidence of my expiring friend,
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
whose last moments were soothed with
the hope of his finding a parent's care
in me.”</P>
<P>“You have had the goodness to
wish to serve me. Sir Charles Ver∣ville
is dead: a fever, the consequence
of his ungoverned intemperance, car∣ried
him off suddenly: his brother Sir
William has a worthy character; if
Colonel Rivers, by his general acquaint∣ance
with the great world, can repre∣sent
this story to him, it possibly may
procure my little Charles happier pros∣pects
than my poverty can give him.”</P>
<P>“Your goodness, Madam, makes it un∣necessary
to be more explicit: to be un∣happy,
and not to have merited it, is a
sufficient claim to your protection.”</P>
<P>“You are above the low prejudices of
common minds; you will pity the
wretched victim of her own unsuspect∣ing
heart, you will abhor the memory
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
of her savage undoer, you will ap∣prove
my complying with her dying
request, though in contradiction to the
selfish maxims of the world: you will,
if in your power, endeavor to serve my

<P>“'Till I had explained my situation, I

<P>THE story you have told me has
equally shocked and astonished me:
my sweet Bell has dropped a pitying tear
on poor Sophia's grave.</P>
<P>Thank Heaven! we meet with few
minds like that of Sir Charles Verville;
such a degree of savage insensibility is
unnatural.</P>
<P>The human heart is created weak, not
wicked: avid of pleasure and of gain;
but with a mixture of benevolence, which
prevents our seeking either to the destruction
of others.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="121"/>
Nothing can be more false than that we
are naturally inclined to evil: we are in∣deed
naturally inclined to gratify the
selfish passions of every kind; but those
passions are not evil in themselves, they
only become so from excess.</P>
<P>The malevolent passions are not inhe∣rent
in our nature. They are only to be
acquired by degrees, and generally are
born from chagrin and disappointment; a
wicked character is a depraved one.</P>
<P>What must this unhappy girl have suf∣fered!
no misery can equal the struggles of
a virtuous mind wishing to act in a manner
becoming its own dignity, yet carried by
passions to do otherwise.</P>

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Oct. 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM very impatient, my dear friend,
till you hear from Sir William, though
I have no doubt of his acting as he ought:
our cottagers shall not leave us till their
fate is determined; I have not told Miss
Williams the step I have taken.</P>
<P>Emily is more and more pleased with
this amiable girl: I wish extremely to be
able to keep her here; as an agreeable
companion of her own age and sex, whose
ideas are similar, and who, from being in
the same season of life, sees things in the
same point of view, is all that is wanting
to Emily's happiness.</P>
<P>'Tis impossible to mention similarity of
ideas, without observing how exactly ours
coincide; in all my acquaintance with
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
mankind, I never yet met a mind so near∣ly
resembling my own; a tie of affection
much stronger than all your merit would
be without that similarity.</P>
<P>I agree with you, that mankind are
born virtuous, and that it is education and
example which make them otherwise.</P>
<P>The believing other men knaves is not
only the way to make them so, but is also
an infallible method of becoming such
ourselves.</P>
<P>A false and ill-judged method of instruc∣tion,
by which we imbibe prejudices instead
of truths, makes us regard the human race
as beasts of prey; not as brothers, united
by one common bond, and promoting the
general interest by pursuing our own par∣ticular
one.</P>
<P>There is nothing of which I am more
convinced than that,</P>
<Q><PB N="123" REF="125"/>
“True self-love and social are the
same:”</Q>
<P>That those passions which make the
happiness of individuals, tend directly to
the general good of the species.</P>
<P>The beneficent Author of nature has
made public and private happiness the
same; man has in vain endeavored to di∣vide
them; but in the endeavor he has
almost destroyed both.</P>
<P>'Tis with pain I say, that the business of
legislation in most countries seems to have
been to counter-work this wise order of
Providence, which has ordained, that we
shall make others happy in being so our∣selves.</P>
<P>This is in nothing so glaring as in the
point on which not only the happiness,
but the virtue of almost the whole human
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
race is concerned: I mean marriage;
the restraints on which, in almost every
country, not only tend to encourage
celibacy, and a destructive libertinism
the consequence of it, to give fresh
strength to domestic tyranny, and sub∣ject
the generous affections of uncor∣rupted
youth to the guidance of those
in whom every motive to action but
avarice is dead; to condemn the blame∣less
victims of duty to a life of indif∣ference,
of disgust, and possibly of guilt;
but, by opposing the very spirit of our
constitution, throwing property into a
few hands, and favoring that excessive
inequality, which renders one part of
the species wretched, without adding to
the happiness of the other; to destroy
at once the domestic felicity of indivi∣duals,
contradict the will of the Su∣preme
Being, as clearly wrote in the
book of nature, and sap the very foun∣dations
of the most perfect form of
government on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="127"/>
A pretty long-winded period this: Bell
would call it true Ciceronian, and quote</P>
<LG>
<L>“—Rivers for a period of a mile.”</L>
</LG>
<P>But to proceed. The only equality to
which parents in general attend, is that of
fortune; whereas a resemblance in age, in
temper, in personal attractions, in birth,
in education, understanding, and senti∣ment,
are the only foundations of that
lively taste, that tender friendship, with∣out
which no union deserves the sacred
name of marriage.</P>
<P>Timid, compliant youth may be forced
into the arms of age and disease; a lord
may invite a citizen's daughter he despises
to his bed, to repair a shattered fortune;
and she may accept him, allured by the
rays of a coronet: but such conjunctions
are only a more shameful species of prosti∣tution.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="128"/>
Men who marry from interested motives
are inexcusable; but the very modesty of
women makes against their happiness in
this point, by giving them a kind of bash∣ful
fear of objecting to such persons as
their parents recommend as proper ob∣jects
of their tenderness.</P>

<DATELINE>Temple-house, <DATE>Nov. 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU wrong me excessively, my dear
Rivers, in accusing me of a natural
levity in love and friendship.</P>
<P>As to the latter, my frequent changes,
which I freely acknowledge, have not
been owing to any inconstancy, but to
precipitation and want of caution in con∣tracting
them.</P>
<P>My general fault has been the folly of
choosing my friends for some striking and
agreeable accomplishment, instead of giv∣ing
to solid merit the preference which
most certainly is its due.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="130"/>
My inconstancy in love has been meerly
from vanity.</P>
<P>There is something so flattering in the
general favor of women, that it requires
great firmness of mind to resist that kind
of gallantry which indulges it, though ab∣solutely
destructive to real happiness.</P>
<P>I blush to say, that when I first mar∣ried
I have more than once been in dan∣ger,
from the mere boyish desire of con∣quest,
notwithstanding my adoration for
your lovely sister: such is the force of
habit, for I must have been infinitely a
loser by changing.</P>
<P>I am now perfectly safe; my vanity has
taken another turn: I pique myself on
keeping the heart of the loveliest woman
that ever existed, as a nobler conquest
than attracting the notice of a hundred
coquets, who would be equally flattered
by the attention of any other man, at least
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
any other man who had the good fortune
to be as fashionable.</P>
<P>Every thing conspires to keep me in the
road of domestic happiness: the manner
of life I am engaged in, your friendship,
your example, and society; and the very
fear I am in of losing your esteem.</P>
<P>That I have the seeds of constancy in
my nature, I call on you and your lovely
sister to witness; I have been <HI>your</HI> friend
from almost infancy, and am every hour
more <HI>her</HI> lover.</P>
<P>She is my friend, my companion, as
well as mistress; her wit, her sprightli∣ness,
her pleasing kind of knowledge, fill
with delight those hours which are so
tedious with a fool, however lovely.</P>
<P>With my Lucy, possession can never
cure the wounded heart.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="132"/>
Her modesty, her angel purity of mind
and person, render her literally,</P>
<LG>
<L>“My ever-new delight.”</L>
</LG>
<P>She has convinced me, that if beauty
is the mother, delicacy is the nurse of
love.</P>
<P>Venus has lent her her cestus, and
shares with her the attendance of the
Graces.</P>
<P>My vagrant passions, like the rays of
the sun collected in a burning glass, are
now united in one point.</P>
<P>Lucy is here. Adieu! I must not let
her know her power.</P>
<P>You spend to-morrow with us; we

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Nov. 1.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE this moment a letter from
Temple which has set my heart at rest:
he writes like a lover, yet owns his past
danger, with a frankness which speaks
more strongly than any professions could
do, the real present state of his heart.</P>
<P>My anxiety for my sister has a little
broke in on my own happiness; in Eng∣land,
where the married women are in
general the most virtuous in the world, it
is of infinite consequence they should love
their husbands, and be beloved by them;
in countries where gallantry is more per∣mitted,
it is less necessary.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="135"/>
Temple will make her happy whilst she
preserves his heart; but, if she loses it,
every thing is to be feared from the viva∣city
of his nature, which can never support
one moment a life of indifference.</P>
<P>He has that warmth of temper which
is the natural soil of the virtues; but
which is unhappily, at the same time,
most apt to produce indiscretions.</P>
<P>Tame, cold, dispassionate minds re∣semble
barren lands; warm, animated
ones, rich ground, which, if properly
cultivated, yields the noblest fruit; but,
if neglected, from its luxuriance is most
productive of weeds.</P>
<P>His misfortune has been losing both
his parents when almost an infant; and
having been master of himself and a noble
fortune, at an age when the passions hurry
us beyond the bounds of reason.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="136"/>
I am the only person on earth by whom
he would ever bear to be controlled in
any thing; happily for Lucy, I preserve
the influence over him which friendship
first gave me.</P>
<P>That influence, and her extreme atten∣tion
to study his taste in every thing;
with those uncommon graces both of mind
and person she has received from nature,
will, I hope, effectually fix this wander∣ing
star.</P>
<P>She tells me, she has asked you to a
masquerade at Temple-house, to which you
will extremely oblige us all by coming.</P>

he desires to see the child; he tells me, his

this story in all the agony of remorse, and

at the crisis: Bell expects a particular ac∣count
of it from Mrs. Rivers, and desires

begs you will send your fair cottager and

introduce them properly to Sir William.</P>

<P>YES, my dear Bell, politeness is un∣doubtedly
a moral virtue.</P>
<P>As we are beings formed for, and not
capable of being happy without, society,
it is the duty of every one to endeavor to
make it as easy and agreeable as they can;
which is only to be done by such an
attention to others as is consistent with
what we owe to ourselves; all we give
them in civility will be re-paid us in
respect: insolence and ill-breeding are
detestable to all mankind.</P>
<P>I long to see you, my dear Bell; the
delight I have had in your society has
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
spoiled my relish for that of meer acquain∣tance,
however agreeable.</P>
<P>'Tis dangerous to indulge in the
pleasures of friendship; they weaken
one's taste too much for common con∣versation.</P>
<P>Yet what other pleasures are worth
the name? what others have spirit and
delicacy too?</P>
<P>I am preparing for the masquerade,
which is to be the 18th; I am ex∣tremely
disappointed you will not be
with us.</P>
<P>My dress is simple and unornament∣ed,
but I think becoming and prettily
fancied; it is that of a French <HI>paisanne:</HI>
Lucy is to be a sultana, blazing with
diamonds: my mother a Roman ma∣tron.</P>
<P>I choose this dress because I have heard
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
my dear Rivers admire it; to be one mo∣ment
more pleasing in his eyes, is an ob∣ject
worthy all my attention.</P>

<P>CERTAINLY, my dear, friendship
is a mighty pretty invention, and,
next to love, gives of all things the
greatest spirit to society.</P>
<P>And yet the prudery of the age will
hardly allow us poor women even this
pleasure, innocent as it is.</P>
<P>I remember my aunt Cecily, who died
at sixty-six, without ever having felt the
least spark of affection for any human be∣ing,
used to tell me, a prudent modest wo∣man
never loved any thing but herself.</P>
<P>For my part, I think all the kind pro∣pensities
of the heart ought rather to be
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
cherished than checked; that one is al∣lowed
to esteem merit even in the naughty
creature, man.</P>
<P>I love you very sincerely, Emily: but
I like friendships for the men best; and
think prudery, by forbidding them, robs
us of some of the most lively as well as
innocent pleasures of the heart.</P>
<P>That desire of pleasing, which one feels
much the most strongly for a <HI>male</HI> friend,
is in itself a very agreeable emotion.</P>
<P>You will say, I am a coquet even in
friendship; and I am not quite sure you
are not in the right.</P>
<P>I am extremely in love with my hus∣band;
yet choose other men should re∣gard
me with complacency, am as fond
of attracting the attention of the dear
creatures as ever, and, though I do jus∣tice
to your wit, understanding, senti∣ment,
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
and all that, prefer Rivers's conver∣sation
infinitely to yours.</P>
<P>Women cannot say civil things to each
other; and if they could, they would
be something insipid; whereas a male
friend—</P>
<P>'Tis absolutely another thing, my
dear; and the first system of ethics I
write, I will have a hundred pages on the
subject.</P>
<P>Observe, my dear, I have not the least
objection to your having a friendship for
Fitzgerald. I am the best-natured crea∣ture
in the world, and the fondest of in∣creasing
the circle of my husband's inno∣cent
amusements.</P>
<P><HI>A propos</HI> to innocent amusements, I think
your fair sister-in-law an exquisite politi∣cian;
calling the pleasures to Temple at
home, is the best method in the world to
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
prevent his going abroad in pursuit of
them.</P>
<P>I am mortified I cannot be at your
masquerade; it is my passion, and I have
the prettiest dress in the world by me.
I am half inclined to elope for a day or
two.</P>

<P>PLEASE to inform the little Bell, I
won't allow her to spoil my Emily.</P>
<P>I enter a caveat against male friend∣ships,
which are only fit for ladies of the
<HI>salamandrine</HI> order.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="146"/>
I desire to engross all Emily's <HI>kind
propensities</HI> to myself; and should grudge
the least share in her heart, or, if
you please in her <HI>friendship,</HI> to an arch-angel.</P>
<P>However, not to be too severe, since
prudery expects women to have no pro∣pensities
at all, I allow single ladies, of all
ranks, sizes, ages, and complexions, to
spread the veil of friendship between their
hearts and the world.</P>
<P>'Tis the finest day I ever saw, though
the middle of November; a dry soft west
wind, the air as mild as in April, and an
almost Canadian sunshine.</P>
<P>I have been bathing in the clear stream,
at the end of my garden; the same stream
in which I laved my careless bosom at thir∣teen;
an idea which gave me inconceivable
delight; and the more, as my bosom is as
<PB N="145" REF="147"/>
gay and tranquil at this moment as in
those dear hours of chearfulness and in∣nocence.</P>
<P>Of all local prejudices, that is the
strongest as well as most pleasing, which
attaches us to the place of our birth.</P>
<P>Sweet home! only seat of true and ge∣nuine
happiness.</P>
<P>I am extremely in the humor to write
a poem to the houshold gods.</P>
<P>We neglect these amiable deities, but
they are revenged; true pleasure is only
to be found under their auspices.</P>
<P>I know not how it is, my dear Fitzge∣rald;
but I don't find my passion for the
country abate.</P>
<P>I still find the scenes around me lovely;
though, from the change of season, less
smiling than when I first fixed at Bell∣field;
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
we have rural business enough to
amuse, not embarrass us; we have a
small but excellent library of books, given
us by my mother; she and Emily are two
of the most pleasing companions on earth;
the neighbourhood is full of agreeable
people, and, what should always be at∣tended
to in fixing in the country, of for∣tunes
not superior to our own.</P>
<P>The evenings grow long, but they are
only the more jovial; I love the plea∣sures
of the table, not for their own
sakes, for no man is more indifferent on
this subject; but because they promote
social, convivial joy, and bring people
together in good humor with themselves
and each other.</P>
<P>My Emily's suppers are enchanting;
but our little income obliges us to have
few: if I was rich, this would be my
principal extravagance.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149"/>
To fill up my measure of content,
Emily is pleased with my retirement,
and finds all her happiness in my af∣fection.</P>
<P>We are so little alone, that I find
our moments of unreserved conversa∣tion
too short; whenever I leave her,
I recollect a thousand things I had to
say, a thousand new ideas to commu∣nicate,
and am impatient for the hour
of seeing again, without restraint, the
most amiable and pleasing of woman∣kind.</P>
<P>My happiness would be complete, if I
did not sometimes see a cloud of anxiety
on that dear countenance, which, how∣ever,
is dissipated the moment my eyes
meet hers.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="150"/>
I am going to Temple's, and the

<DIV2 N="214" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>LETTER CCXIV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Colonel RIVERS.
<DATE>Nov. 14:</DATE></OPENER>
<P>SO you disapprove male friendships, my
sweet Colonel! I thought you had
better ideas of things in general.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald and I have been disputing
on French and English manners, in regard
to gallantry.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="151"/>
The great question is, Whether a man
is more hurt by the imprudent conduct of
his daughter or his wife?</P>
<P>Much may be said on both sides.</P>
<P>There is some hazard in suffering co∣quetry
in either; both contribute to give
charms to conversation, and introduce
ease and politeness into society; but both
are dangerous to manners.</P>
<P>Our customs, however, are most likely
to produce good effects, as they give
opportunity for love marriages, the
only ones which can make worthy minds
happy.</P>
<P>The coquetry of single women has a
point of view consistent with honor; that
of married women has generally no point
of view at all; it is, however, of use <HI>pour
passer le tems.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="152"/>
As to real gallantry, the French style
depraves the minds of men least, ours is
most favorable to the peace of families.</P>
<P>I think I preserve the balance of argu∣ment
admirably.</P>
<P>My opinion, however, is, that if people
married from affection, there would be no
such thing as gallantry at all.</P>
<P>Pride, and the parade of life, destroy
all happiness: our whole felicity depends
on our choice in marriage, yet we choose
from motives more trifling than would
determine us in the common affairs of life.</P>
<P>I knew a gentleman who fancied himself
in love, yet delayed marrying his mistress
till he could afford a set of plate.</P>
<P>Modern manners are very unfavorable
to the tender affections.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="153"/>
Ancient lovers had only dragons to
combat; ours have the worse monsters of
avarice and ambition.</P>
<P>All I shall say further on the sub∣ject
is, that the two happiest people
I ever knew were a country clergy∣man
and his wife, whose whole in∣come
did not exceed one hundred pounds
a year.</P>
<P>A pretty philosophical, sentimental,
dull kind of an epistle this!</P>
<P>But you deserve it, for not answering
my last, which was divine.</P>
<P>I am pleased with Emily's ideas about
her dress at the masquerade; it is a proof
you are still lovers.</P>
<P>I remember, the first symptoms I disco∣vered
of my <HI>tendresse</HI> for Fitzgerald was
my excessive attention to this article: I
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
have tried on twenty different caps when
I expected him at Silleri.</P>
<P>Before we drop the subject of gallan∣tries,
I must tell you I am charmed with
you and my <HI>sposo,</HI> for never giving the
least hint before Emily and me that you
have had any; it is a piece of delicacy
which convinces me of your tenderness
more than all the vows that ever lovers
broke would do.</P>
<P>I have been hurt at the contrary beha∣viour
in Temple; and have observed
Lucy to be so too, though her excessive
attention not to give him pain prevented
her shewing it: I have on such an occa∣sion
seen a smile on her countenance,
and a tear of tender regret starting into
her eyes.</P>
<P>A woman who has vanity without affec∣tion
will be pleased to hear of your past
conquests, and regard them as victims im∣molated
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
to her superior charms: to her,
therefore, it is right to talk of them;
but to flatter the <HI>heart,</HI> and give delight
to a woman who truly loves, you should
appear too much taken up with the pre∣sent
passion to look back to the past: you
should not even present to her imagination
the thought that you have had other en∣gagements:
we know such things are,
but had rather the idea should not be
awakened: I may be wrong, but I speak
from my own feelings.</P>
<P>I am excessively pleased with a thought
I met with in a little French novel:</P>
<P>“Un homme qui ne peut plus compter
ses bonnes fortunes, est de tous, celui
qui connoît le moins les <HI>faveurs.</HI> C'est
le coeur qui les accorde, &amp; ce n'est pas
le coeur qu'un homme à la mode inte∣resse.
Plus on est <HI>prôné</HI> par les femmes,
plus il est facile de les avoir, mais moins
il est possible de les enflammer.”</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="156"/>
To which truth I most heartily set my
hand.</P>
<Q>Twelve o'clock.</Q>
<P>I have just heard from your sister, who
tells me, Emily is turned a little natural
philosopher, reads Ray, Derham, and
fifty other strange old fellows that one
never heard of, and is eternally poring
through a microscope to discover the won∣ders
of creation.</P>
<P>How amazingly learned matrimony
makes young ladies! I suppose we shall
have a volume of her discoveries bye
and bye.</P>
<P>She says too, you have little pets like
sweethearts, quarrel and make it up again
in the most engaging manner in the
world.</P>
<P>This is just what I want to bring Fitz∣gerald
to; but the perverse monkey won't
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
quarrel with me, do all I can: I am sure
this is not my fault, for I give him reason
every day of his life.</P>
<P>Shenstone says admirably, “That re∣conciliation
is the tenderest part of love
and friendship: the soul here discovers
a kind of elasticity, and, being forced
back, returns with an additional vio∣lence.”</P>
<P>Who would not quarrel for the plea∣sure
of reconciliation! I shall be very
angry with Fitzgerald if he goes on in
this mild way.</P>
<P>Tell your sister, she cannot be more
mortified than I am, that it is impossible
for me to be at her masquerade.</P>

<SIGNED>A. FITZGERALD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
<P>Don't you think, my dear Rivers,
that marriage, on prudent principles,
is a horrid sort of an affair? It is really
cruel of papas and mammas to shut up
two poor innocent creatures in a house
together, to plague and torment one ano∣ther,
who might have been very happy
separate.</P>
<P>Where people take their own time, and
choose for themselves, it is another affair,
and I begin to think it possible affection
may last through life.</P>
<P>I sometimes fancy to myself Fitz∣gerald
and I loving on, from the impas∣sioned
hour when I first honored him with
my hand, to that tranquil one, when we
shall take our afternoon's nap <HI>vis-à-vis</HI> in
two arm chairs, by the fire-side, he a
grave country justice, and I his worship's
good sort of a wife, the Lady Bountiful of
the Parish.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="159"/>
I have a notion there is nothing so very
shocking in being an oldish gentlewoman;
what one loses in charms, is made up in
the happy liberty of doing and saying
whatever one pleases. Adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Captain FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Nov. 16.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY relation, Colonel Willmott, is
just arrived from the East Indies,
rich, and full of the project of marrying
his daughter to me.</P>
<P>My mother has this morning received a
letter from him, pressing the affair with
an earnestness which rather makes me feel
for his disappointment, and wish to break
it to him as gently as possible.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="160"/>
He talks of being at Bellfield on Wed∣nesday
evening, which is Temple's mas∣querade;
I shall stay behind at Bellfield,
to receive him, have a domino ready, and
take him to Temple-house.</P>
<P>He seems to know nothing of my mar∣riage
or my sister's, and I wish him not
to know of the former till he has seen
Emily.</P>
<P>The best apology I can make for de∣clining
his offer, is to shew him the lovely
cause.</P>
<P>I will contrive they shall converse toge∣ther
at the masquerade, and that he shall
sit next her at supper, without their know∣ing
any thing of each other.</P>
<P>If he sees her, if he talks with her,
without that prejudice which the know∣ledge
of her being the cause of his disap∣pointment
might give, he cannot fail of
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
having for her that admiration which I
never yet met with a mind savage enough
to refuse her.</P>
<P>His daughter has been educated abroad,
which is a circumstance I am pleased with,
as it gives me the power of refusing her
without wounding either her vanity, or
her father's, which, had we been acquaint∣ed,
might have been piqued at my giving
the preference to another.</P>
<P>She is not in England, but is hourly
expected: the moment she arrives, Lucy
and I will fetch her to Temple-house: I
shall be anxious to see her married to a
man who deserves her. Colonel Willmott
tells me, she is very amiable; at least as
he is told, for he has never seen her.</P>
<P>I could wish it were possible to conceal
this offer for ever from Emily; my deli∣cacy
is hurt at the idea of her knowing it,
at least from me or my family.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="162"/>
My mother behaves like an angel on
this occasion; expresses herself perfectly
happy in my having consulted my heart
alone in marrying, and speaks of Emi∣ly's
tenderness as a treasure above all
price.</P>
<P>She does not even hint a wish to see me
richer than I am.</P>
<P>Had I never seen Emily, I would not
have married this lady unless love had
united us.</P>
<P>Do not, however, suppose I have that
romantic contempt for fortune, which is so
pardonable, I had almost said so becoming,
at nineteen.</P>
<P>I have seen more of the world than
most men of my age, and I have seen the
advantages of affluence in their strongest
light.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="163"/>
I think a worthy man not only
may have, but ought to have, an at∣tention
to making his way in the world,
and improving his situation in it, by
every means consistent with probity and
honor, and with his own real happi∣ness.</P>
<P>I have ever had this attention, and ever
will, but not by base means: and, in my
opinion, the very basest is that of selling
one's hand in marriage.</P>
<P>With what horror do we regard a man
who is kept! and a man who marries from
interested views alone, is kept in the
strongest sense of the word.</P>
<P>He is equally a purchased slave, with
no distinction but that his bondage is of
longer continuance.</P>

Adonis.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="165"/>
Heaven send he may be an honester man
than his father, or I foresee terrible de∣vastations
amongst the sex.</P>
<P>We have this moment your letter; I
am angry with you for blaspheming the
sweet season of nineteen:</P>
<LG>
<L>“O lovely source</L>
<L>Of generous foibles, youth! when open∣ing

<L>Are honest as the light, lucid as air,</L>
<L>As fostering breezes kind, as linnets
gay,</L>
<L>Tender as buds, and lavish as the spring.”</L>
</LG>
<P>You will find out I am in a course of
Shenstone, which I prescribe to all minds
tinctured with the uncomfortable selfish∣ness
of the present age.</P>
<P>The only way to be good, is to retain
the generous mistakes, if they are such,
of nineteen through life.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>
As to you, my dear Rivers, with all
your airs of prudence and knowing the
world, you are, in this respect, as much a
boy as ever.</P>
<P>Witness your extreme joy at having
married a woman with two thousand
pounds, when you might have had one
with twenty times the sum.</P>
<P>You are a boy, Rivers, I am a girl; and
I hope we shall remain so as long as we
live.</P>
<P>Do you know, my dear friend, that
I am a daughter of the Muses, and that I
wrote pastorals at seven years old?</P>
<P>I am charmed with this, because an old
physician once told me it was a symptom,
not only of long life, but of long youth,
which is much better.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="167"/>
He explained this, by saying some∣thing
about animal spirits, which I do
not at all understand, but which perhaps
you may.</P>
<P>I should have been a pretty enough kind
of a poetess, if papa had not attempted
to teach me how to be one, and insisted on
seeing my scribbles as I went on: these
same Muses are such bashful misses, they
won't bear to be looked at.</P>
<P>Genius is like the sensitive plant; it
shrinks from the touch.</P>
<P>So your nabob cousin is arrived: I hope
he will fall in love with Emily; and re∣member,
if he had obligations to Mrs.
Rivers's father, he had exactly the same to
your grandfather.</P>
<P>He might spare ten thousand pounds
very well, which would improve your <HI>petits

<DATELINE>Bellfield, <DATE>Nov. 17,</DATE> Morning.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE had a letter from Colonel
Willmott myself to-day; he is still
quite unacquainted with the state of our
domestic affairs; supposes me a batchelor,
and talks of my being his son-in-law as a
certainty, not attending to the probability
of my having other engagements.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="169"/>
His history, which he tells me in this
letter, is a very romantic one. He was a
younger brother, and provided for ac∣cordingly:
he loved, when about twenty,
a lady who was as little a favorite of for∣tune
as himself: their families, who on
both sides had other views, joined their
interest to get him sent to the East In∣dies;
and the young lady was removed
to the house of a friend in London, where
she was to continue till he had left Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Before he went, however, they con∣trived
to meet, and were privately mar∣ried;
the marriage was known only to
her brother, who was Willmott's friend.</P>
<P>He left her in the care of her brother,
who, under pretence of diverting her me∣lancholy,
and endeavoring to cure her
passion, obtained leave of his father to take
her with him to France.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="170"/>
She was there delivered of this child,
and expired a few days after.</P>
<P>Her brother, without letting her fami∣ly
know the secret, educated the infant,
as the daughter of a younger brother
who had been just before killed in a
duel in France; her parents, who died
in a few years, were, almost in their
last moments, informed of these circum∣stances,
and made a small provision for
the child.</P>
<P>In the mean time, Colonel Willmott,
after experiencing a great variety of mis∣fortunes
for many years, during which he
maintained a constant correspondence with
his brother-in-law, and with no other per∣son
in Europe, by a train of lucky acci∣dents,
acquired very rapidly a consider∣able
fortune, with which he resolved to re∣turn
to England, and marry his daughter to
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
me, as the only method to discharge
fully his obligations to my grandfather,
who alone, of all his family, had given
him the least assistance when he left Eng∣land.
He wrote to his daughter, letting
her know his design, and directing her to
meet him in London; but she is not yet
arrived.</P>
<P>Six in the Evening.</P>
<P>My mother and Emily went to Temple's
to dinner; they are to dress there, and I
am to be surprized.</P>
<P>Seven.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott is come: he is an ex∣treme
handsome man; tall, well-made,
with an air of dignity which one seldom
sees; he is very brown, and, what will
please Bell, has an aquiline nose: he
looks about fifty, but is not so much;

<P>WHO should I dine and sup
with to-day, at a merchant's
in the city, but your old love, Sir
George Clayton, as gay and amusing
as ever!</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173"/>
What an entertaining companion have
you lost, my dear Emily!</P>
<P>He was a little disconcerted at seeing
me, and blushed extremely: but soon re∣covered
his amiable, uniform insipidity of
countenance, and smiled and simpered as
usual.</P>
<P>He never enquired after you, nor
even mentioned your name: being ask∣ed
for a toast, I had the malice to give
Rivers; he drank him, without seem∣ing
ever to have heard of him be∣fore.</P>
<P>The city misses admire him pro∣digiously,
and he them; they are charm∣ed
with his beauty, and he with their
wit.</P>
<P>His mother, poor woman! could not
bring the match she wrote about to bear:
the family approved him; but the fair one
<PB N="172" REF="174"/>
made a better choice, and gave herself last
week, at St. George's, Hanover-square, to
a very agreeable fellow of our acquaintance,
Mr. Palmer; a man of sense and honor,
who deserves her had she been ten times
richer: he has a small estate in Lincoln∣shire,
and his house is not above twenty
miles from you: I must bring you and
Mrs. Palmer acquainted.</P>
<P>I suppose you are now the happiest of
beings; Rivers finding a thousand new
beauties in his <HI>belle paisanne,</HI> and you ex∣ulting
in your charms, or, in other words,
glorying in your strength.</P>
<P>So the maiden aunts in your neighbour∣hood
think Miss Williams no better than
she should be?</P>
<P>Either somebody has said, or the idea
is my own; after all, I believe it Shen∣stone's,
That those are generally the best
people whose characters have been most
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
injured by slanderers, as we usually find
that the best fruit which the birds have
been pecking at.</P>
<P>I will, however, allow appearances were
a little against your cottager; and I would
forgive the good old virgins, if they had
always as suspicious circumstances to de∣termine
from.</P>
<P>But they generally condemn from
trifling indiscretions, and settle the cha∣racters
of their own sex from their con∣duct
at a time of life when they are
themselves no judges of its propriety;
they pass sentence on them for small
errors, when it is an amazing proof
of prudence not to commit great ones.</P>
<P>For my own part, I think those who
never have been guilty of any indiscre∣tion,
are generally people who have very
little active virtue.</P>

<P>All I can say is, that if imprudence is a

<P>YOU are right, my little Rivers: I
like your friend, Colonel Willmott
vastly better for his aquiline nose; I ne∣ver
yet saw one on the face of a fool.</P>
<P>He is a fortunate man to be intro∣duced
to such a party of fine women at
his arrival; it is literally <HI>to feed among the
lilies.</HI></P>
<P>Fitzgerald says, he should be jealous
of him in your esteem, if he was fifteen
years younger; but that the strongest
friendships are, where there is an equality
in age; because people of the same age
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
have the same train of thinking, and see
things in the same light.</P>
<P>Every season of life has its peculiar
set of ideas; and we are greatly inclined
to think nobody in the right, but those
who are of the same opinion with our∣selves.</P>
<P>Don't you think it a strong proof of
my passion for my <HI>sposo,</HI> that I repeat his
sentiments?</P>
<P>But to business: Sir William is charmed
with his little nephew; has promised to
settle on him what he before mentioned,
to allow Miss Williams an hundred pounds
a year, which is to go to the child after
her death, and to be at the expence of his
education himself.</P>

<P>OUR masquerade last night was really
charming; I never saw any thing
equal to it out of London.</P>
<P>Temple has taste, and had spared no ex∣pence
to make it agreeable; the decora∣tions
of the grand saloon were magni∣ficent.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="180"/>
Emily was the loveliest <HI>paisanne</HI> that
ever was beheld; her dress, without losing
sight of the character, was infinitely be∣coming:
her beauty never appeared to
such advantage.</P>
<P>There was a noble simplicity in her air,
which it is impossible to describe.</P>
<P>The easy turn of her shape, the lovely
roundness of her arm, the natural ele∣gance
of her whole form, the waving
ringlets of her beautiful dark hair, care∣lessly
fastened with a ribbon, the unaf∣fected
grace of her every motion, all to∣gether
conveyed more strongly than ima∣gination
can paint, the pleasing idea of a
wood-nymph, deigning to visit some fa∣vored
mortal.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott gazed on her with
rapture; and asked me, if the rural deities
had left their verdant abodes to visit
Temple-house.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="181"/>
I introduced him to her, and left her
to improve the impression: 'tis well I was
married in time; a nabob is a dangerous
rival.</P>
<P>Lucy looked lovely, but in another
style; she was a sultana in all the
pride of imperial beauty; her charms
awed, but Emily's invited; her look
spoke resistless command, Emily's soft
persuasion.</P>
<P>There were many fine women; but I
will own to you, I had, as to beauty, no
eyes but for Emily.</P>
<P>We are going this morning to see Bur∣leigh:
when we return, I shall announce
Colonel Willmott to Emily, and intro∣duce
them properly to each other; they
are to go in the same chaise; she at pre∣sent
only knows him as a friend of mine,
and he her as his <HI>belle paisanne.</HI></P>

<P>I should have told you, I acquainted
Colonel Willmott with my sister's mar∣riage
before I took him to Temple-house,

is a stranger: I will caution him not to

<OPENER>To Mrs. FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Temple-house, Thursday Morning.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Emily was happy beyond
words last night: amongst a crowd
of beauties, her Rivers's eyes continually
followed her; he seemed to see no other
object: he would scarce let me wait till
supper to unmask.</P>
<P>But you will call me a foolish romantic
girl; therefore I will only say, I had the
delight to see him pleased with my dress,
and charmed with the complaisance which
was shewed me by others.</P>
<P>There was a gentleman who came
with Rivers, who was particularly at∣tentive
to me; he is not young, but
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
extremely amiable: has a very fine per∣son,
with a commanding air; great polite∣ness,
and, as far as one can judge by a
few hours conversation, an excellent un∣derstanding.</P>
<P>I never in my life met with a man for
whom I felt such a partiality at first sight,
except Rivers, who tells me, I have made
a conquest of his friend.</P>
<P>He is to be my cavalier this morning to
Burleigh.</P>
<P>It has this moment struck me, that Ri∣vers
never introduced his friend and me
to each other, but as masks; I never
thought of this before: I suppose he
forgot it in the hurry of the masque∣rade.</P>
<P>I do not even know this agreeable
stranger's name; I only found out by his
conversation he had served in the army.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="185"/>
There is no saying how beautiful
Lucy looked last night; her dress was
rich, elegantly fancied, and particu∣larly
becoming to her graceful form,
which I never saw look so graceful
before.</P>
<P>All who attempted to be fine figures,
shrunk into nothing before her.</P>
<P>Lucy carries her head, you know,
remarkably well; which, with the ad∣vantage
of her height, the perfect stand∣ard
of women, her fine proportion, the
native dignity of her air, the majestic
flow of her robe, and the blaze of her
diamonds, gave her a look of infinite
superiority; a superiority which some
of the company seemed to feel in a
manner, which rather, I will own, gave
me pain.</P>
<P>In a place consecrated to joy, I hate
to see any thing like an uneasy sen∣sation;
yet, whilst human passions are
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
what they are, it is difficult to avoid
them.</P>
<P>There were four or five other sultanas,
who seemed only the slaves of her train.</P>
<P>In short,</P>
<LG>
<L>“She look'd a goddess, and she mov'd a
queen.”</L>
</LG>
<P>I was happy the unassuming simplicity
of the character in which I appeared, pre∣vented
comparisons which must have been
extremely to my disadvantage.</P>
<P>I was safe in my littleness, like a mo∣dest
shrub by the side of a cedar; and,
being in so different a style, had the better
chance to be taken notice of, even where
Lucy was.</P>
<P>She was radiant as the morning star,
and even dazzlingly lovely.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="187"/>
Her complexion, for Temple would
not suffer her to wear a mask at all, had
the vivid glow of youth and health,
heightened by pleasure, and the consci∣ousness
of universal admiration.</P>
<P>Her eyes had a fire which one could
scarce look at.</P>
<P>Temple's vanity and tenderness were
gratified to the utmost: he drank eagerly
the praises which envy itself could not
have refused her.</P>
<P>My mother extremely became her cha∣racter;
and, when talking to Rivers, gave
me the idea of the Roman Aurelia, whose
virtues she has equalled.</P>
<P>He looked at her with a delight which
rendered him a thousand times more dear
to me: she is really one of the most plea∣sing
women that ever existed.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188"/>
I am called: we are just setting out for
Burleigh, which I have not yet seen.</P>

<P>He is gone to his apartment, whither I

I could wish.</P>
<P>He will, I am sure, pardon any offence
of which his <HI>belle paisanne</HI> is the cause.</P>
<P>I am returned.</P>
<P>He is disappointed, but not surprised;
owns no human heart could have resisted
Emily; begs she will allow his daughter a
place in her friendship.</P>
<P>He insists on making her a present of
diamonds; the only condition, he tells me,
on which he will forgive my marriage.</P>
<P>I am going to introduce him to her in

<P>Adieu! for a moment.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="190"/>
Fitzgerald!—I scarce respire—the tu∣mult
of my joy—this daughter whom I
have refused—my Emily—could you have
believed—my Emily is the daughter of
Colonel Willmott.</P>
<P>When I announced him to her by that
name, her color changed; but when I ad∣ded
that he was just returned from the
East Indies, she trembled, her cheeks had
a dying paleness, her voice faltered, she
pronounced faintly, “My father!” and
sunk breathless on a sofa.</P>
<P>He ran to her, he pressed her wildly to
his bosom, he kissed her pale cheek, he
demanded if she was indeed his child?
his Emily? the dear pledge of his Emily
Montague's tenderness?</P>
<P>Her senses returned, she fixed her eyes
eagerly on him, she kissed his hand, she
would have spoke, but tears stopped her
voice.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="191"/>
The scene that followed is beyond my
powers of description.</P>

<P>YOUR friend is the happiest of man∣kind.</P>
<P>Every anxiety is removed from my
Emily's dear bosom: a father's sanction
leaves her nothing to desire.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
You may remember, she wished to delay
our marriage: her motive was, to wait
Colonel Willmott's return.</P>
<P>Though promised by him to another,
she hoped to bring him to leave her heart
free; little did she think the man destined
for her by her father, was the happy Riv∣ers
her heart had chosen.</P>
<P>Bound by a solemn vow, she concealed
the circumstances of her birth even from
me.</P>
<P>She resolved never to marry another,
yet thought duty obliged her to wait her
father's arrival.</P>
<P>She kindly supposed he would see me
with her eyes, and, when he knew me,
change his design in my favor: she fan∣cied
he would crown her love as the re∣ward
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
of her obedience in delaying her
marriage.</P>
<P>My importunity, and the fear of giving
me room to doubt her tenderness, as her
vow prevented such an explanation as
would have satisfied me, bore down her
duty to a father whom she had never seen,
and whom she had supposed dead, till the
arrival of Mrs. Melmoth's letters; having
been two years without hearing any thing
of him.</P>
<P>She married me, determined to give up
her right to half his fortune in favor of
the person for whom he designed her;
and hoped, by that means, to discharge
her father's obligations, which she could
not pay at the expence of sacrificing her
heart.</P>

<DATELINE>Temple-house, Friday.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY Rivers has told you—my sweet
friend, in what words shall I con∣vey
to you an adequate idea of your Emi∣ly's
transport, at a discovery which has
reconciled all her duties!</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="195"/>
Those anxieties, that sense of hav∣ing
failed in filial obedience, which cast
a damp on the joy of being wife to
the most beloved of mankind, are at
an end.</P>
<P>This husband whom I so dreaded,
whom I determined never to accept, was
my Rivers.</P>
<P>My father forgives me; he pardons
the crime of love: he blesses that kind
providence which conducted us to hap∣piness.</P>
<P>How many has this event made happy!</P>
<P>The most amiable of mothers shares
my joy; she bends in grateful thanks to
that indulgent power who has rewarded
her son for all his goodness to her.</P>
<P>Rivers hears her, and turns away to
hide his tears: her tenderness melts him
to the softness of a woman.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196"/>
What gratitude do we not owe to hea∣ven!
may the sense of it be for ever en∣graven
on our hearts!</P>
<P>My Lucy too; all, all are happy.</P>
<P>But I will tell you. Rivers has al∣ready
acquainted you with part of my
story.</P>
<P>My uncle placed me, with a servant
in whom he could confide, in a convent
in France, till I was seven years old; he
then sent for me to England, and left
me at school eight years longer; after
which, he took me with him to his regi∣ment
in Kent, where, you know, our
friendship began, and continued till he
changed into another, then in America,
whither I attended him.</P>
<P>My father's affairs were, at that time,
in a situation which determined my uncle
to take the first opportunity of marrying
me to advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="197"/>
I regarded him as a father; he had al∣ways
been more than a parent to me; I
had the most implicit deference to his
will.</P>
<P>He engaged me to Sir George Clay∣ton;
and, when dying, told me the story
of my birth, to which I had till then
been a stranger, exacting from me, how∣ever,
an oath of secresy till I saw my
father.</P>
<P>He died, leaving me, with a trifle left
in trust to him for my use from my grand∣father,
about two thousand pounds, which
was all I, at that time, ever expected to
possess.</P>
<P>My father was then thought ruined;
there was even a report of his death, and
I imagined myself absolute mistress of my
own actions.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="198"/>
I was near two years without hear∣ing
any thing of him; nor did I
know I had still a father, till the let∣ters
you brought me from Mrs. Mel∣moth.</P>
<P>A variety of accidents, and our be∣ing
both abroad, and in such distant
parts of the world, prevented his letters
arriving.</P>
<P>In this situation, the kind hand of
Heaven conducted my Rivers to Mont∣real.</P>
<P>I saw him; and, from that moment,
my whole soul was his.</P>
<P>Formed for each other, our love was
sudden and resistless as the bolt of hea∣ven:
the first glance of those dear speak∣ing
eyes gave me a new being, and
awaked in me ideas never known be∣fore.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="199"/>
The strongest sympathy attached me
to him in spite of myself: I thought
it friendship, but felt that friend∣ship
more lively than what I called
my <HI>love</HI> for Sir George; all conver∣sation
but his became insupportable
to me; every moment that he passed
from me, I counted as lost in my ex∣istence.</P>
<P>I loved him; that tenderness hourly
increased: I hated Sir George, I fan∣cied
him changed; I studied to find
errors in a man who had, a few weeks
before, appeared to me amiable, and
whom I had consented to marry; I broke
with him, and felt a weight removed
from my soul.</P>
<P>I trembled when Rivers appeared;
I died to tell him my whole soul was
his; I watched his looks, to find there
the same sentiments with which he had
inspired me: that transporting moment
<PB N="198" REF="200"/>
at length arrived; I had the delight to
find our tenderness was mutual, and to
devote my life to making happy the
lord of my desires.</P>
<P>Mrs. Melmoth's letter brought me my
father's commands, if unmarried, to con∣tinue
so till his return.</P>
<P>He added, that he intended me for a re∣lation,
to whose family he had obligations;
that, his affairs having suffered such a
happy revolution, he had it in his power
and, therefore, thought it his duty, to pay
this debt of gratitude; and, at the same
time hoped to make me happy by con∣necting
me with an amiable family, allied
to him by blood and friendship; and unit∣ing
me to a man whom report spoke wor∣thy
of all my tenderness.</P>
<P>You may remember, my dearest Bell,
how strongly I was affected on reading
those letters: I wrote to Rivers, to beg
<PB N="199" REF="201"/>
him to defer our marriage; but the man∣ner
in which he took that request, and the
fear of appearing indifferent to him, con∣quered
all sense of what I owed to my fa∣ther,
and I married him; making it,
however, a condition that he should ask
no explanation of my conduct till I chose
to give it.</P>
<P>I knew not the character of my fa∣ther;
he might be a tyrant, and divide
us from each other: Rivers doubted
my tenderness; would not my waiting,
if my father had afterwards refused his
consent to our union, have added to
those cruel suspicions? might he not
have supposed I had ceased to love
him, and waited for the excuse of pater∣nal
authority to justify a change of senti∣ment?</P>
<P>In short, love bore down every other
consideration; if I persisted in this delay,
I might hazard losing all my soul held
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
dear, the only object for which life was
worth my care.</P>
<P>I determined, if I married, to give
up all claim to my father's fortune,
which I should justly forfeit by my
disobedience to his commands: I hoped,
however, Rivers's merit, and my fa∣ther's
paternal affection, when he knew
us both, would influence him to make
some provision for me as his daughter.</P>
<P>Half his fortune was all I ever hoped
for, or even would have chose to accept:
the rest I determined to give up to the
man whom I refused to marry.</P>
<P>I gave my hand to Rivers, and
was happy; yet the idea of my fa∣ther's
return, and the consciousness of
having disobeyed him, cast sometimes
a damp on my felicity, and threw a
gloom over my soul, which all my en∣deavors
could scarce hide from Rivers,
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
though his delicacy prevented his asking
the cause.</P>
<P>I now know, what was then a secret to
me, that my father had offered his daugh∣ter
to Rivers, with a fortune which could,
however, have been no temptation to a
mind like his, had he not been attached
to me: he declined the offer, and, lest I
should hear of it, and, from a romantic
disinterestedness, want him to accept it,
pressed our marriage with more importu∣nity
than ever; yet had the generosity to
conceal this sacrifice from me, and to wish
it should be concealed for ever.</P>
<P>These sentiments, so noble, so peculiar
to my Rivers, prevented an explanation,
and hid from us, for some time, the cir∣cumstances
which now make our happi∣ness
so perfect.</P>
<P>How infinitely worthy is Rivers of all
my tenderness!</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="204"/>

I this morning went to Bellfield, and

<P>NO words, my dear Emily, can speak

<P>You are then as happy as you deserve
to be; we hope, in a few days, to be
witnesses of your felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="205"/>
We knew from the first of your fa∣ther's
proposal to Rivers; but he ex∣torted
a promise from us, never on any
account to communicate it to you: he
also desired us to detain you in Berkshire,
by lengthening our visit, till your mar∣riage,
lest any friend of your father's in
London should know his design, and
chance acquaint you with it.</P>
<P>Fitzgerald is <HI>Monsieur le Majeur,</HI> at your
ladyship's service: he received his com∣mission
this morning.</P>
<P>I once again congratulate you, my dear,
on this triumph of tenderness: you see
love, like virtue, is not only its own re∣ward,
but sometimes intitles us to other
rewards too.</P>
<P>It should always be considered, that
those who marry from love, <HI>may</HI> grow
rich; but those who marry to be rich,
will <HI>never</HI> love.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206"/>
The very idea that love will come after
marriage, is shocking to minds which
have the least spark of delicacy: to such
minds, a marriage which begins with in∣difference
will certainly end in disgust and
aversion.</P>
<P>I bespeak your papa for my <HI>cecisbeo;</HI>
mine is extremely at your service in return.</P>
<P>But I am piqued, my dear. “Senti∣ments
so noble, so peculiar to your
Rivers—”</P>
<P>I am apt to believe there are men in the
world—that nobleness of mind is not so
very <HI>peculiar</HI>—and that some people's sen∣timents
may be as noble as other people's.</P>
<P>In short, I am inclined to fancy Fitzge∣rald
would have acted just the same part in
the same situation.</P>
<P>But it is your great fault, my dear Emi∣ly,
to suppose your love a phoenix, where∣as
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
he is only an agreeable, worthy, hand∣some
fellow, <HI>comme un autre.</HI></P>
<P>I suppose you will be very angry; but
who cares? I will be angry too.</P>
<P>Surely, my Fitzgerald—I allow Rivers
all his merit; but comparisons, my dear—</P>
<P>Both our fellows, to be sure, are charm∣ing
creatures; and I would not change
them for a couple of Adonis's: yet I don't
insist upon it, that there is nothing agree∣able
in the world but them.</P>
<P>You should remember, my dear, that
beauty is in the lover's eye; and that,
however highly you may think of Rivers,
every woman breathing has the same idea
of <HI>the dear man.</HI></P>
<P>O heaven! I must tell you, because it
will flatter your vanity about your charmer.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="208"/>
I have had a letter from an old lover
of mine at Quebec, who tells me, Ma∣dame
Des Roches has just refused one of
the best matches in the country, and vows
she will live and die a batchelor.</P>
<P>'Tis a mighty foolish resolution, and yet
I cannot help liking her the better for
making it.</P>
<P>My dear papa talks of taking a house
near you, and of having a garden to
rival yours: we shall spend a good deal of
time with him, and I shall make love to
Rivers, which you know will be vastly
pretty.</P>
<P>One must do something to give a little
variety to life; and nothing is so amusing,
or keeps the mind so pleasingly awake, es∣pecially
in the country, as the flattery of
an agreeable fellow.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="209"/>
I am not, however, quite sure I shall
not look abroad for a flirt, for one's
friend's husband is almost as insipid as
one's own.</P>
<P>Our romantic adventures being at an
end, my dear; and we being all degene∣rated
into sober people, who marry and
<HI>settle;</HI> we seem in great danger of sinking
into vegetation: on which subject I desire
Rivers's opinion, being, I know, a most
exquisite enquirer into the laws of nature.</P>
<P>Love is a pretty invention, but, I am
told, is apt to <HI>mellow</HI> into friendship; a
degree of perfection at which I by no
means desire Fitzgerald's attachment for
me to arrive on this side seventy.</P>
<P>What must we do, my dear, to vary our
days?</P>
<P>Cards, you will own, are an agreeable
relief, and the least subject to pall of any
pleasures under the sun: and really, phi∣losophically
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
speaking, what is life but an
intermitted pool at quadrille?</P>
<P>I am interrupted by a divine colonel in
the guards.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CCXXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Mrs. FITZGERALD.
<DATELINE>Bellfield, Tuesday.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ACCEPT your challenge, Bell; and
am greatly mistaken if you find me so
very insipid as you are pleased to suppose.</P>
<P>Have no fear of falling into vegetation;
not one amongst us has the least vegeta∣tive
quality.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="211"/>
I have a thousand ideas of little amuse∣ments,
to keep the mind awake.</P>
<P>None of our party are of that sleepy
order of beings, who want perpetual
events to make them feel their existence:
this is the defect of the cold and inani∣mate,
who have not spirit and vivacity
enough to taste the natural pleasures of
life.</P>
<P>Our adventures of one kind are at an
end; but we shall see others, as enter∣taining,
springing up every moment.</P>
<P>I dare say, our whole lives will be Pin∣daric:
my only plan of life is to have
none at all, which, I think, my little Bell
will approve.</P>
<P>Please to observe, my sweet Bell, to
make life pleasant, we must not only
have great pleasures but little ones, like
the smaller auxiliary parts of a building;
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
we must have our trifling amusements, as
well as our sublime transports.</P>
<P>My first <HI>second</HI> pleasure (if you will al∣low
the expression) is gardening; and for
this reason, that it is my divine Emily's:
I must teach you to love rural pleasures.</P>
<P>Colonel Willmott has made me just as
rich as I wish to be.</P>
<P>You must know, my fair friend, that
whilst I thought a fortune and Emily in∣compatible,
I had infinite contempt for
the former, and fancied that it would ra∣ther
take from, than add to, my happi∣ness;
but, now I can possess it with her,
I allow it all its value.</P>
<P>My father (with what delight do I call
the father of Emily by that name!) hinted
at my taking a larger house; but I would
not leave my native Dryads for an impe∣rial
palace: I have, however, agreed to
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
let him build a wing to Bellfield, which
it wants, to compleat the original plan,
and to furnish it in whatever manner he
thinks fit.</P>
<P>He is to have a house in London; and
we are to ramble from one to the other as
fancy leads us.</P>
<P>He insists on our having no rule but in∣clination:
do you think we are in any
danger of vegetating, my dear Bell?</P>
<P>The great science of life is, to keep in
constant employment that restless active
principle within us, which, if not directed
right, will be eternally drawing us from
real to imaginary happiness.</P>
<P>Love, all charming as it is, requires to
be kept alive by such a variety of amuse∣ments,
or avocations, as may prevent the
languor to which all human pleasures are
subject.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214"/>
Emily's tenderness and delicacy make
me ever an expecting lover: she contrives
little parties of pleasure, and by surprize,
of which she is always the ornament and
the soul: her whole attention is given to
make her Rivers happy.</P>
<P>I envy the man who attends her on these
little excursions.</P>
<P>Love with us is ever led by the Sports
and the Smiles.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, people who have the
spirit to act as we have done, to dare to
choose their own companions for life, will
generally be happy.</P>
<P>The affections are the true sources of
enjoyment: love, friendship, and, if you
will allow me to anticipate, paternal ten∣derness,
all the domestic attachments, are
sweet beyond words.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="215"/>
The beneficent Author of nature, who
gave us these affections for the wisest pur∣poses—</P>
<P>“Cela est bien dit, mon cher Rivers;
mais il faut cultiver notre jardin.”</P>
<P>You are right, my dear Bell, and I am
a prating coxcomb.</P>
<P>Lucy's post-coach is just setting off, to
wait your commands.</P>
<P>I send this by Temple's servant. On
Thursday I hope to see our dear groupe of
friends re-united, and to have nothing to
wish, but a continuance of our present
happiness.</P>
<CLOSER>Adieu! Your faithful
<SIGNED>ED. RIVERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
