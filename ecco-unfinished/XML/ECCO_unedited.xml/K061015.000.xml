<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AVING taken more than ordinary Pains in collecting the Materials which compose the following History, we could not be satisfied with our selves, if any Thing were wanting to it, which might render it intirely satisfactory to the Publick: It is for this Reason we have subjoined to the Work, a short Abstract of the Laws now in Force against Pyrates, and made choice of some particular Cases, (the most curious we could meet with) which have been hereto∣fore tried, by which it will appear what Actions have, and what have not been adjudged Pyracy.</P>
<P>It is possible this Book may fall into the Hands of some Masters of Ships, and other honest Mariners, who frequent∣ly, by contrary Winds or Tempests, or other Accidents inci∣dent to long Voyages, find themselves reduced to great Di∣stresses, either through Scarcity of Provisions, or Want of Stores. I say, it may be a Direction to such as those, what Lengths they may venture to go, without violating the Law of Nations, in Case they should meet other Ships at Sea, or be cast on some inhospitable Shore, which should refuse to trade with them for such Things as are absolutely necessary for the Preservation of their Lives, or the Safety of the Ship and Cargoe.</P>
<P>We have given a few Instances in the Course of this History of the Inducements Men have to engage themselves
<PB REF="3"/>
headlong in a Life of so much Peril to themselves, and so destructive to the Navigation of the trading World; to re∣medy which Evil there seems to be but two Ways, either to find Employment for the great Numbers of Seamen turn'd adrift at the Conclusion of a War, and thereby prevent their running into such Ʋndertakings, or to guard suf∣ficiently the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and other Places whereto Pyrates resort.</P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice in this Place, that during this long Peace, I have not so much as heard of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pyrate: It is not that I take them to be honester than their Neigh∣bours; but when we account for it, it will, perhaps, be a Reproach to our selves for our want of Industry: The Rea∣son I take to be, that after a War, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships are laid up, they have a Fishery, where their Seamen find immediate Business, and as comfortable Bread as they had before. Had ours the same Recourse in their Necessities, I▪m certain we should find the same Effect from it; for a Fishery is a Trade that cannot be overstock'd; the Sea is wide enough for us all, we need not quarrel for Elbow-room: Its Stores are infinite, and will ever Reward the Labourer. Besides, our own Coast, for the most Part, supply the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who emtl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y several hundred Sail constantly in the Trade, and so sell to us our own Fish. I call it our own, for the Sove∣reignty of the <HI>British</HI> Seas, are to this Day acknowledged us by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and all the neighbouring Nations; where∣fore, if there was a publick Spirit amongst us, it would be well worth our while to establish a National Fishery, which would be the best Means in the World to prevent Pyracy, employ a Number of the Poor, and ease the Nation of a great Burthen, by lowering the Price of Provision in gene∣ral, as well as if several other Commodities.</P>
<P>I need not being any Proofs of what I advance, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are Maltitudes of Seamen at this Day unemploy'd; it is but t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o evident by their straggling, and begging all over the Kingdom. N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r is it so much their Inclination to Idleness, as their own hard Fate, in being cast off after their Work is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or feal. I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave not known a Man of
<PB REF="4"/>
War commission'd for several Years past, but three times her Compliment of Men have offer'd themselves in twenty four Hours; the Merchants take their Advantage of this, lessen their Wages, and those few who are in Business are poorly paid, and but poorly fed; such Ʋsage breeds Discon∣tents amongst them, and makes them eager for any Change.</P>
<P>I shall not repeat what I have said in the History con∣cerning the Privateers of the <HI>West Indies,</HI> where I have taken Notice they live upon Spoil; and as Custom is a second Nature, it is no Wonder that, when an honest Livlyhood is not easily had, they run into one so like their own; so that it may be said, that Privateers in time of War are a Nur∣sery for Pyrates against a Peace.</P>
<P>Now we have accounted for their Rise and Beginning, it will be natural to enquire why they are not taken and de∣stroy'd, before they come to any Head, seeing that they are seldom less than twelve Men of War station'd in our <HI>Ame∣rican</HI> Plantations, even in Time of Peace; a Force suffi∣cient to contend with a powerful Enemy. This Enquiry, perhaps, will not turn much to the Honour of those concern'd in that Service; however, I hope I may be excus'd, if what I hint is with a Design of serving the Publick.</P>
<P>I say, 'tis strange that a few Pyrates should ravage the Seas for Years, without ever being light upon, by any of our Ships of War; when in the mean Time, they (the Py∣rates) shall take Fleets of Ships; it looks as if one was much more dilligent in their Affairs, than the other. <HI>Roberts</HI> and his Crew, alone, took <HI>400</HI> Sail, before he was destroy'd.</P>
<P>This Matter, I may probably set right another Time, and only observe for the present, that the Pyrates at Sea, have the same Sagacity with Robbers at Land; as the latter understand what Roads are most frequented, and where it is most likely to meet with Booty, so the former know what Latitude to lie in, in order to intercept Ships; and as the Pyrates happen to be in want of Provisions, Stores, or any particular Lading, they cruise accordingly for such Ships, and are moraly certain of meeting with them; and by the same Reason, if the Man of War cruise in those Latitudes,
<PB REF="5"/>
they are as sure of finding the Pyrates, as the Pyrates are to find the Merchant Ships; and if the Pyrates are not to be met with by the Men of War in such a Latitude, then surely down the same Latitude may the Merchant Ships arrive safely to their Port.</P>
<P>To make this a little plainer to my Country Readers, I must observe that all our outward bound Ships, sometime after they leave the Land, steer into the Latitude of the Place they are bound to; if to the <HI>West-India</HI> Islands, or any Part of the Main of <HI>America,</HI> as <HI>New-York, New-England, Virginia, &amp;c.</HI> because the Latitude is the only Certainty in those Voyages to be found, and then they sail due West, till they come to their Port, without altering their Course. In this West Way lie the Pyrates, whether it be to <HI>Virginia, &amp;c.</HI> or <HI>Nevis,</HI> St. <HI>Christo∣phers, Montserat, Jamaica, &amp;c.</HI> so that if the Mer∣chant Ships bound thither, do not fall a Prey to them one Day, they must another: Therefore I say, if the Men of War take the same Track, the Pyrates must unavoidably fall into their Mouths, or be frighted away, for where the Game is, their will the Vermine be; if the latter should be the Case, the trading Ships, as I said before, will pass unmolested and safe, and the Pyrates be reduced to take Refuge in some of their lurking Holes about the uninhabited Islands, where their Fate would be like that of the Fox in his Den, if they should venture out, they would be hunted and taken, and if they stay within they must starve.</P>
<P>I must observe another Thing, that the Pyrates general∣ly shift their Rovings, according to the Season of the Year; in the Summer they cruise mostly along the Coast of the Con∣tinent of <HI>America,</HI> but the Winters there, being a little too cold for them, they follow the Sun, and go towards the Islands, at the approach of cold Weather. Every Man who has used the <HI>West-India</HI> Trade, knows this to be true; therefore, since we are so well acquainted with all their M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens, I cannot see why our Men of War under a proper Regulation, may not go to the Southward, instead of lying up all the Winter useless: But I shall proceed too far
<PB REF="6"/>
in this Enquiry, I shall therefore quit it, and say some thing of the following Sheets, which the Author may venture to assure the Reader that they have one Thing to recommend them, which is Truth; those Facts which he himself was not an Eye-Witness of, he had from the authentick Relati∣ons of the Persons concerned in taking the Pyrates, as well as from the Mouths of the Pyrates themselves, after they were taken, and he conceives no Man can produce better Testimonies to support the Credit of any History.</P>
<P>It will be observed, that the Account of the Actions of <HI>Roberts</HI> runs into a greater Length, than that of any other Pyrate, for which we can assign two Reasons, first, because he ravaged the Seas longer than the rest, and of Consequence there must be a greater Scene of Business in his Life: Second∣ly, being resolved not to weary the Reader, with tiresome Repetitions: When we found the Circumstances in <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Life, and other Pyrates, either as to pyratical Articles, or any Thing else, to be the same, we thought it best to give them but once, and chose <HI>Robert</HI>'s Life for that Purpose, he ha∣ving made more Noise in the World, than some others.</P>
<P>As to the Lives of our two female Pyrates, we must con∣fess they may appear a little Extravagant, yet they are never the less true for seeming so, but as they were pub∣lickly tried for their Pyracies, there are living Witnesses enough to justify what we have laid down concerning them; It is certain, we have produced some Particulars which were not so publickly known, the Reason is, we were more inquisi∣tive into the Circumstances of their past Lives, than other People, who had no other Design, than that of gratifying their own private Curiosity: If there are some Incidents and Turns in their Stories, which may give them a little the Air of a <HI>Novel,</HI> they are not invented or contrived for that Purpose, it is a Kind of Reading this Author is but little acquainted with, but as he himself was exceedingly diverted with them, when they were related to him, he thought they might have the same Effect upon the Reader.</P>
<P>I presume we need make no Apology for giving the Name of a History to the following Sheets, though they contain no∣thing
<PB REF="7"/>
but the Actions of a Parcel of Robbers. It is Bra∣very and Stratagem in War which make Actions worthy of Record; in which Sense the Adventures here related will be thought deserving that Name. <HI>Plutarch</HI> is very cir∣cumstantial in relating the Actions of <HI>Spartacus,</HI> the Slave, and makes the Conquest of him, one of the greatest Glories of <HI>Marcus Crassus;</HI> and it is probable, if this Slave had liv'd a little longer, <HI>Plutarch</HI> would have given us his Life at large. <HI>Rome,</HI> the Mistress of the World, was no more at first than a Refuge for Thieves and Outlaws; and if the Progress of our Pyrates had been equal to their Be∣ginning; had they all united, and settled in some of those Islands, they might, by this Time, have been honoured with the Name of a Commonwealth, and no Power in those Parts of the World could have been able to dispute it with them.</P>
<P>If we have seem'd to glance, with some Freedom, at the Behaviour of some Governors of Provinces abroad, it has been with Caution; and, perhaps, we have not declar'd as much as we knew: However, we hope those Gentlemen in the same Station, who have never given Occasion for the like Censure, will take no Offence, tho' the Word Governor is sometimes made use of.</P>

<P>It has been the Case heretofore, that when a sin∣gle Pyrate has been suffered to range the Seas, as not being worth the Notice of a Government, he has by Degrees grown so powerful, as to put them to the Expence of a great deal of Blood and Treasure, before he was suppress'd; we shall not exa∣mine how it came to pass, that our Pyrates in the <HI>West-Indies</HI> have continually increased till of late; this is an Enquiry which belongs to the Legislature, or Representatives of the People in Parliament, and to them we shall leave it.</P>
<P>Our Business shall be briefly to shew, what from Beginnings, as inconsiderable as these, other Nations have suffered.</P>
<P>In the Times of <HI>Marius</HI> and <HI>Sylla, Rome</HI> was in her greatest Strength, yet she was so torn to Pieces by the Factions of those two great Men, that every Thing which concerned the publick Good was altogether neglected, when certain Pyrates broke out from <HI>Cicilia,</HI> a Country of <HI>Asia Minor,</HI> situate on the Coast of the <HI>Mediteranean,</HI> betwixt <HI>Syria</HI> on the East, from whence it is divided by Mount <HI>Tau∣ris,</HI> and <HI>Armenia Minor</HI> on the West. This Begin∣ning was mean and inconsiderable, having but two or three Ships, and a few Men, with which they cruised about the <HI>Greek</HI> Islands, taking such Ships as were very ill arm'd or weakly defended; however, by the taking of many Prizes, they soon increased in Wealth and Power: The first Action of their's which made a Noise, was the taking of <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> who was as yet a Youth, and who being obliged to fly from the Cruelties of <HI>Sylla,</HI> who sought his Life, went into <HI>Bithinia,</HI> and so journed a while with <HI>Ni∣comedes,</HI> King of that Country; in his Return back
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
by Sea, he was met with, and taken, by some of these Pyrates, near the Island of <HI>Pharmacusa:</HI> These Pyrates had a barbarous Custom of tying their Pri∣soners back to back and throwing them into the Sea; but, supposing <HI>Caesar</HI> to be some Person of a high Rank, because of his purple Robes, and the Num∣ber of his Attendants, they thought it would be more for their Profit to preserve him, in hopes of receiving a great Sum for his Ransom; therefore they told him he should have his Liberty, provided he would pay them twenty Talents, which they judg'd to be a very high Demand, in our Money, about three thousand six hundred Pounds Sterling; he smiled, and of his own Accord promised them fifty Talents; they were both pleased, and surprized at his Answer, and consented that several of his Attendants should go by his Direction and raise the Money; and he was left among these Ruffians with no more than three Attendants. He pass'd eight and thirty Days, and seem'd so little concern'd or afraid, that often when he went to sleep, he used to charge them not to make a Noise, threatning, if they disturbed him, to hang them all; he also play'd at Dice with them, and sometimes wrote Verses and Dialogues, which he used to repeat, and also cause them to repeat, and if they did not praise and admire them, he would call them Beasts and Barbarians, telling them he would crucifie them. They took all these as the Sallies of a juvenile Hu∣mour, and were rather diverted, than displeased at them.</P>
<P>At length his Attendants return'd with his Ran∣som, which he paid, and was discharg'd; he sail'd for the Port of <HI>Miletum,</HI> where, as soon as he was arriv'd, he used all his Art and Industry in fitting out a Squadron of Ships, which he equipp'd and arm'd at his own Charges; and sailing in Quest of the Pyrates, he surpriz'd them as they lay at An∣chor
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
among the Islands, and took those who had taken him before, with some others; the Money he found upon them he made Prize of, to reimburse his Charges, and he carried the Men to <HI>Pergamus</HI> or <HI>Troy,</HI> and there secured them in Prison: In the mean Time, he applied himself to <HI>Junius,</HI> then Governor of <HI>Asia,</HI> to whom it belong'd to judge and deter∣mine of the Punishment of these Men; but <HI>Junius</HI> finding there was no Money to be had, answered <HI>Caesar,</HI> that he would think, at his leisure, what was to be done with those Prisoners; <HI>Caesar</HI> took his leave of him, returned back to <HI>Pergamus,</HI> and com∣manded that the Prisoners should be brought out and executed, according to Law in that Case provi∣ded; which is taken Notice of, in a Chapter at the End of this Book, concerning the Laws in Cases of Pyracy: And thus he gave them that Punishment in Earnest, which he had often threatned them with in Jest.</P>
<P><HI>Caesar</HI> went strait to <HI>Rome,</HI> where, being ingaged in the Designs of his own private Ambition, as were almost all the leading Men in <HI>Rome,</HI> the Py∣rates who were left, had Time to increase to a pro∣digious Strength; for while the civil Wars lasted, the Seas were left unguarded, so that <HI>Plutarch</HI> tells us, that they erected diverse Arsenals full of all manner of warlike Stores, made commodious Har∣bours, set up Watch-Towers and Beacons all along the Coasts of <HI>Celicia;</HI> that they had a mighty Fleet, well equiped and furnished, with Galliots of Oars, man'd, not only with Men of desperate Courage, but also with expert Pilots and Mariners; they had their Ships of Force, and light Pinnaces for cruising and making Discoveries, in all no less than a thousand Sail; so gloriously set out, that they were as much to be envied for their gallant Shew, as fear'd for their Force; having the Stern and Quarters all guilded with Gold, and their Oars plated
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
with Silver, as well as purple Sails; as if their greatest Delight had been to glory in their Iniquity. Nor were they content with committing Pyracies and Insolences by Sea, they committed as great Depredations by Land; or rather made Conquests, for they took and sack'd no less than four hundred Cities, laid several others under Contributions, plundered the Temples of the Gods, and inriched themselves with the offerings deposited in them; they often landed Bodies of Men, who not only plundered the Villages along the Sea Coast, but ransack'd the fine Houses of the Noblemen along the <HI>Tiber.</HI> A Body of them once took <HI>Sextillius</HI> and <HI>Bellinus</HI> two <HI>Roman</HI> Praetors, in their purple Robes, going from <HI>Rome</HI> to their Governments, and carried them away with all their Sergeants, Officers, and Vergers; they also took the Daughter of <HI>Antonius</HI> a consular Person, and one who had obtain'd the Honour of a Triumph, as she was going to the Country House of her Father.</P>
<P>But what was most barbarous, was a Custom they had when they took any Ship, of enquiring of the Persons on Board, concerning their Names and Country; if any of them said he was a <HI>Roman,</HI> they fell down upon their Knees, as if in a Fright at the Greatness of that Name, and begged Pardon for what they had done; and imploring his Mercy, they used to perform the Offices of Servants about his Person, and when they found they had deceived him into a Belief of their being sincere, they hung out the Ladder of the Ship, and coming with a shew of Curtesy, told him he had his Liberty, desiring him to walk out of the Ship; and this in the Middle of the Sea; and when they observed him in Sur∣prize, as was natural, they used to throw him over∣board with mighty shouts of Laughter; so wanton they were in their Cruelty.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="27"/>
Thus, while <HI>Rome</HI> was Mistress of the World, she suffered Insults and Affronts, almost at her Gates, from these Powerful Robbers; but what for a while made Faction cease, and rowsed the Genius of that People, never used to suffer Wrongs from a fair Enemy, was an excessive Scarcity of Provisions in <HI>Rome,</HI> occasioned by all the Ships loaden with Corn and Provisions from <HI>Siclly, C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsica,</HI> and other Places, being intercepted and taken by these Pyrates, inso∣much that they were almost reduced to a Famine: Upon this, <HI>Pompey</HI> the <HI>Great</HI> was immediately ap∣pointed General to manage this War; five hundred Ships were immediately fitted out, he had fourteen Senators, Men of Experience in the War, for his Vice-Admirals; and so considerable an Enemy, were these Ruffians become, that no less than an Army of a hundred thousand Foot, and five thou∣sand Horse was appointed to invade them by Land; but it happened very luckily for <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Pompey</HI> sail'd out before the Pyrates had Intelligence of a Design against them, so that their Ships were scat∣tered all over the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> like Bees gone out from a Hive, some one Way, some another, to bring Home their lading; <HI>Pompey</HI> divided his Fleet into thirteen Squadrons, to whom he appointed their several Stations, so that great Numbers of the Pyrates ell into their Hands, Ship by Ship, with∣out any Loss; forty Days he pass'd in scouring the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> some of the Fleet cruizing along the Coast of <HI>Africk,</HI> some about the Islands, and some upon the <HI>Italian</HI> Coasts, so that often those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who were flying from one Squadron, fell in with another; however, some of them escaped, and these making directly to <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and acquaint∣ing their Confederates on Shore with what had happened, they appointed a Reudezvous of all the Ships that had escaped at the <HI>Port of Coracesium</HI> in the same Country. <HI>Pompey</HI> finding the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
quite clear, appointed a meeting of all his Fleet at the Haven of <HI>Brundusium,</HI> and from thence sailing round into the <HI>Adriatick,</HI> he went directly to attack these Pyrates in their Hives; as soon as he came near <HI>Corecesium</HI> in <HI>Cilicia,</HI> where the Remainder of the Pyrates now lay, they had the Hardiness to come and give him Battle, but the Genius of old <HI>Rome</HI> prevailed, and the Pyrates received an entire Overthrow, being all either taken or destroy'd; but as they made many strong Fortresses upon the Sea Coast, and built Castles, and strong Holds up the Country, about the Foot of Mount <HI>Taurus,</HI> he was obliged to besiege them with his Army; some Pla∣ces he took by Storm, others surrendered to his Mercy, to whom he gave their Lives, and at length he made an entire Conquest.</P>
<P>But it is probable, that had these Pyrates receiv'd sufficient Notice of the <HI>Roman</HI> Preparation against them, so as they might have had Time to draw their scattered Strength into a Body, to have met <HI>Pompey</HI> by Sea, the Advantage appear'd greatly on their Side, in Numbers of Shipping, and of Men; nor did they want Courage, as may be seen by their coming out of the Port of <HI>Coracesium,</HI> to give the <HI>Romans</HI> Battle, with a Force much inferior to their's; I say, had they overthrown <HI>Pompey,</HI> it is likely they would have made greater Attempts, and <HI>Rome,</HI> which had conquer'd the whole World might have been subdued by a parcel of Pyrates.</P>
<P>This is a Proof, how dangerous it is to Govern∣ments to be negligent, and not take an early Care in suppressing these Sea Banditti, before they gather Strength.</P>
<P>The Truth of this Maxim may be better exem∣plefied in the History of <HI>Barbarouse,</HI> a Native of the Citty of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> in the Island of <HI>Lesbos,</HI> in the <HI>Fgean</HI> Sea; a Fellow of ordinary Birth, who being bred to the Sea, first set out from thence upon

<HEAD>CHAP. I. OF Captain <HI>AVERY,</HI> And Others of his <HI>Crew.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NONE of these bold Adventurers were ever so much talked of, for a while, as <HI>Avery;</HI> he made as great a Noise in the World as <HI>Meriveis</HI> does now, and was looked upon to be a Person of as great Consequence; he was re∣presented in <HI>Europe,</HI> as one that had raised himself to the Dignity of a King, and was likely to be the Founder of a new Monarchy; having, as it was said, taken immense Riches, and married the <HI>Great Mo∣guls</HI> Daughter, who was taken in an <HI>Indian</HI> Ship, which fell into his Hands; and that he had by her many Children, living in great Royalty and State; that he had built Forts, erected Magazines, and was Master of a stout Squadron of Ships, man'd with able and desperate Fellows of all Nations; that he gave Commissions out in his own Name, to the Captains of his Ships, and to the Commanders of his Forts, and was acknowledg'd by them, as their Prince. A Play was writ upon him, call'd, the <HI>Suc∣cessful Pyrate;</HI> and, these Accounts obtain'd such Belief, that several Schemes were offer'd to the Council, for fitting out a Squadron to take him; while others were for offering him, and his Compa∣nions, an Act of Grace, and inviting them to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> with all their Treasure, least his growing
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
Greatness might hinder the Trade of <HI>Europe,</HI> to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Yet, all these were no more than false Rumours, improved by the Credulity of some, and the Hu∣mour of others who love to tell strange Things; for, while it was said, he was aspiring at a Crown, he wanted a Shilling; and at the same Time it was given out he was in Possession of such prodigious Wealth in <HI>Madagascar,</HI> he was starving in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, but the Reader will have a Curiosity of knowing what became of this Man, and what, were the true Grounds of so many false Reports, concerning him; therefore, I shall in as brief a Man∣ner, as I can, give his History.</P>
<P>He was born in the West of <HI>England,</HI> near <HI>Ply∣mouth,</HI> in <HI>Devonshire,</HI> being bred to the Sea, he served as a Mate of a Merchant-Man, in several trading Voyages: It happen'd before the Peace of <HI>Ryswick,</HI> when there was an Alliance, betwixt <HI>Spain, England, Holland, &amp;c.</HI> against <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Martinico,</HI> carried on a smugling Trade, with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the Continent of <HI>Peru,</HI> which, by the Laws of <HI>Spain,</HI> is not allowed to Friends in Time of Peace, for none but native <HI>Spaniards</HI> are permit∣ted to Traffick in those Parts, or set their Feet on shore, unless they are brought as Prisoners of War; wherefore they constantly keep certain Ships cruis∣ing along the Coast, whom they call <HI>Guarda del Costa,</HI> who have the Orders to make Prizes of all Ships they can light of within five Leagues of Shore. Now the <HI>French</HI> growing very bold in Trade, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being poorly provided with Ships, and those they had being of no Force, it often fell out that when they light of the <HI>French</HI> Smuglers, they were not strong enough to attack them, there∣fore is was resolved in <HI>Spain,</HI> to hire two or three stout foreign Ships for their Service, which being known at <HI>Bristol,</HI> some Merchants of that City,
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
fitted out two Ships of thirty odd Guns, and 120 Hands each, well furnished with Provision and Am∣munition, and all other Stores; and the Hire being agreed for, by some Agents for <HI>Spain,</HI> they were commanded to sail for <HI>Corruna</HI> or the <HI>Groine,</HI> there to receive their Orders, and to take on board some <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentlemen, who were to go Passengers to <HI>New-Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Of one of these Ships, which I take her to be called the <HI>Duke, Avery</HI> was first Mate, and being a Fellow of more Cunning than Courage, he insinua∣ted himself into the good Will of several of the boldest Fellows on board the other Ship, as well as that which he was on board of; having sound∣ed their Inclinations before he opened himself, and finding them ripe for his Design, he at length proposed to them, to run away with the Ship, telling them what great Wealth was to be had up∣on the Coasts of <HI>India:</HI> It was no sooner said than agreed to, and they agreed to execute their Plot at ten a Clock the Night following.</P>
<P>It must be observ'd, the Captain was one of those who are mightily addicted to Punch, so that he passed most of his Time a shore, in some little drinking Ordinary; but this Day, he did not go on shore as usual; however, this did not spoil the De∣sign, for he took his usual Dose on board, and so got to Bed before the Hour appointed for the Busi∣ness: The Men also who were not privy to the De∣sign, turned into their Hammocks, leaving none upon Deck but the Conspirators, who indeed were the greatest Part of the Ships Crew. At the Time agreed on, the <HI>Dutchess</HI>'s Long-Boat appear'd, which <HI>Avery</HI> hailing in the usual Manner, was answered by the Men in her, <HI>Is your drunken Boatswain on board?</HI> Which was the Watch Word agreed between them, and <HI>Avery</HI> replying in the Affirmative, the Boat
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
came aboard with sixteen stout Fellows, and joined the Company.</P>
<P>When our Gentry saw that all was clear, they secured the Hatches, so went to Work; they did not slip the Anchor, but weigh'd it leisurely, and so put to Sea without any Disorder or Confusion, tho' there were several Ships then lying in the Bay, and among them a <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigate of forty Guns, the Captain of which was offered a great Reward to go out after her; but <HI>Minheer,</HI> who perhaps would not have been willing to have been served so himself, could not be prevail'd upon to give such Usage to another, and so let Mr. <HI>Avery</HI> pursue his Voyage, whether he had a Mind to.</P>
<P>The Captain, who by this Time was waked, either by the Motion of the Ship, or the Noise of work∣ing the Tackles, rung the Bell; <HI>Avery</HI> and two others went into the Cabin; the Captain, half a sleep, and in a kind of Fright, ask'd, <HI>What was the Matter? Avery</HI> answered cooly, <HI>Nothing;</HI> the Captain replied, <HI>something's the Matter with the Ship, Does she drive? What Weather is it?</HI> Thinking nothing less than that it had been a Storm, and that the Ship was driven from her Anchors: <HI>No no</HI> answered <HI>Avery, we're at Sea, with a fair Wind and good Weather. At Sea!</HI> says the Captain, <HI>How can that be? Come,</HI> says <HI>Avery, don't be in a Fright, but put on your Cloaths, and I'll let you into a Secret:—</HI><HI>You must know, that I am Captain of this Ship now, and this is my Cabin, therefore you must walk out; I am bound to</HI> Madagascar, <HI>with a Design of making my own Fortune, and that of all the brave Fellows joined with me.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain having a little recover'd his Senses, began to apprehend the meaning; however, his Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght was as great as before, which <HI>Avery</HI> per∣ceiving, bad him fear nothing, for, says he, if you
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
have a Mind to make one of us, we'll receive you, and if you'll turn Sober, and mind your Business, perhaps in Time I may make you one of my Lieu∣tenants, if not, here's a Boat a Long-side, and you shall be set on Shore.</P>
<P>The Captain was glad to hear this, and therefore accepted of his Offer, and the whole Crew being called up, to know who was willing to go on Shore with the Captain, and who to seek their Fortunes with the rest; there were not above five or six who were willing to quit this Enterprize; wherefore they were put into the Boat with the Captain that Minute, and made their Way to the Shore, as well as they could.</P>
<P>They proceeded on their Voyage to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> but I do not find they took any Ships in their Way; when they arriv'd at the N. E. Part of that Island, they found two Sloops at Anchor, who upon seeing them, slipt their Cables and run themselves a shore, the Men all landing, and running into the Woods; these were two Sloops which the Men had run away with from the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and seeing <HI>Avery,</HI> they supposed him to be some Frigate sent to take them, and therefore not being of Force to engage him, they did what they could to save themselves.</P>
<P>He guess'd what they were, and sent some of his Men on shore to let them know they were Friends, and to offer they might join together for their com∣mon Safety; the Sloop's Men were well arm'd and had posted themselves in a Wood, with Sentinels just on the out side, to observe whether the Ship landed her Men to persue them, and, they observ∣ing only two or three Men to come towards them without Arms, did not oppose them, but having challeng'd them, and they answering they were Friends, they lead them to their Body, where they delivered their Message; at first, they apprehend∣ed it was a Stratagem to decoy them on Board,
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
but when the Ambassadors offered that the Captain himself, and as many of the Crew as they should name, would meet them on shore without Arms, they believed them to be in Earnest, and they soon entered into a Confidence with one another; those on Board coming on Shore, and some of those on Shore going on Board.</P>
<P>The Sloops Men were rejoiced at the new Ally, for their Vessels were so small, that they could not attack a Ship of any Force, so that hitherto they had not taken any considerable Prize, but now they hop'd to fly at high Game; and <HI>Avery</HI> was as well pleased at this Reinforcement, to strengthen them for any brave Enterprize, and tho' the Booty must be lessen'd to each, by being divided into so many Shares, yet he found out an Expedient not to suffer by it himself, as shall be shewn in it's Place.</P>
<P>Having consulted what was to be done, they re∣solved to sail out together upon a Cruize, the Gal∣ley and two Sloops; they therefore fell to work to get the Sloops off, which they soon effected, and steering towards the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coast, near the River <HI>Indus,</HI> the Man at the Mast-Head spied a Sail, upon which they gave Chace, and as they came nearer to her, they perceiv'd her to be a tall Ship, and fancied she might be a <HI>Dutch East-India</HI> Man, homeward bound; but she proved a better Prize; when they fired at her to bring too, she hoisted <HI>Moguls</HI> Colours, and seemed to stand upon her defence, <HI>Avery</HI> only canonaded at a Distance, and some of his Men began to suspect that he was not the Hero they took him for: However, the Sloops made Use of their Time, and coming one on the Bow, and the other on the Quarter of the Ship, clapt her on Board, and enter'd her; upon which she immediately struck her Colours and yielded; she was one of the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s own Ships, and there were in her several of the greatest Persons of his Court; among whom
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
it was said, one of his Daughters, who were going on a Pligrimage to <HI>Mecca;</HI> the <HI>Mahometans</HI> think∣ing themselves obliged once in their Lives to visit that Place; and they were carrying with them rich Offerings to Present at the Shrine of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> It is known, that the Eastern People travel with the utmost Magnificence, so that they had with them all their Slaves and Attendants, their rich Habits and Jewels, with Vessels of Gold and Silver, and great Sums of Money, to defray the Charges of their Journey by Land; wherefore the Plunder got by this Prize, is not easily computed.</P>
<P>Having taken all the Treasure on board their own Ships, and plunder'd their Prize of every Thing else, they either wanted or liked, they let her go; she not being able to continue her Voyage returned back: As soon as the News came to the <HI>Mogul,</HI> and he knew that they were <HI>English</HI> who had robbed them, he threatened loud, and talk'd of sending a mighty Army, with Fire and Sword, to extirpate the <HI>English</HI> from all their Settlements on the <HI>Indian</HI> Coast. The <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>England,</HI> were very much alarm'd at it, however, by Degrees they found Means to pacify him, by promising to do their Endeavours to take the Rob∣bers, and deliver them into his Hands; however, the great Noise this Thing made in <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as <HI>India,</HI> was the Occasion of all those Roman∣tick Stories which were form'd of <HI>Avery</HI>'s Greatness.</P>
<P>In the mean Time our succesful Plunderers agreed to make the best of their Way back to <HI>Ma∣dagascar,</HI> intending to make that Place their Maga∣zine, or Repository for all their Treasure, and to build a small Fortification there, and leave a few Hands always on Shore to look after it, and de∣fend it from any Attempts of the Natives; but <HI>Avery</HI> put an end to this Project, and made it alto∣gether unnecessary.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="37"/>
As they were Steering their Course, as has been said, he sends a Boat on board of each of the Sloops, desiring the Chief of them to come on Board of him, in Order to hold a Council; they did so, and he told them he had something to propose to them for the common Good, which was to provide against Accidents; he bad them consider the Trea∣sure they were possess'd of, would be sufficient for them all if they could secure it in some Place on Shore; therefore all they had to fear, was some Misfortune in the Voyage; he bad them consider the Consequences of being seperated by bad Wea∣ther, in which Case, the Sloops, if either of them should fall in with any Ships of Force, must be either taken or sunk, and the Treasure on board her lost to the rest, besides the common Accidents of the Sea; as for his Part he was so strong, he was able to make his Party good with any Ship they were like to meet in those Seas; that if he met with any Ship of such Strength, that he could not take her, he was safe from being taken, being so well Man'd; besides his Ship was a quick Sailor, and could carry Sail, when the Sloop could not, wherefore, he proposed to them, to put the Trea∣sure on board his Ship, to seal up each Chest with three Seals, whereof each was to keep one, and to appoint a Rendezvous, in Case of Seperation.</P>
<P>Upon considering this Proposal, it appeared so reasonable to them, that they readily came into it, for they argued to themselves, that an Accident might happen to one of the Sloops and the other escape, wherefore it was for the common Good. The Thing was done as agreed to, the Treasure put on Board of <HI>Avery,</HI> and the Chests seal'd; they kept Company that Day and the next, the Wea∣ther being fair, in which Time <HI>Avery</HI> tamper'd with his Men, telling them they now had sufficient to make them all easy, and what should hinder
<PB N="33" REF="38"/>
them from going to some Country, where, they were not known, and living on Shore all the rest of their Days in Plenty; they understood what he meant: And in short, they all agreed to bilk their new Allies, the Sloop's Men, nor do I find that any of them felt any Qualms of Honour rising in his Stomach, to hinder them from consenting to this Piece of Treachery. In fine, they took Advantage of the Darkness that Night, steer'd another Course, and by Morning lost Sight of them.</P>
<P>I leave the Reader to judge, what Swearing and Confusion there was among the Sloop's Men, in the Morning when they saw that <HI>Avery</HI> had given them the Slip; for they knew by the Fairness of the Weather, and the Course they had agreed to steer, that it must have been done on purpose: But we leave them at present to follow Mr. <HI>Avery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Avery,</HI> and his Men, having consulted what to do with themselves, came to a Resolution, to make the best of their Way towards <HI>America;</HI> and none of them being known in those Parts, they intended to divide the Treasure, to change their Names, to go ashore, some in one Place, some in other, to purchase some Settlements, and live at Ease. The first Land they made, was the Island of <HI>Providence,</HI> then newly settled; here they staid some Time, and having considered that when they should go to <HI>New-Eng∣land,</HI> the Greatness of their Ship, would cause much Enquiry about them; and possibly some People from <HI>England,</HI> who had heard the Story of a Ship's being run away with from the <HI>Groine,</HI> might sus∣pect them to be the People; They therefore took a Resolution of disposing of their Ship at <HI>Providence:</HI> upon which, <HI>Avery</HI> pretending that the Ship being fitted out upon the privateering Account, and ha∣ving had no Success, he had received Orders from the Owners, to dispose of her to the best Advan∣tage:

He soon met with a Purchaser, and immedi∣ately bought a Sloop.</P>
<P>In this Sloop, he and his Companions embarq'd, they touch'd at several Parts of <HI>America,</HI> where no Person suspected them; and some of them went on Shore, and dispersed themselves about the Country, having received such Dividends as <HI>Avery</HI> would give them; for he concealed the greatest Part of the Diamonds from them, which in the first Hurry of plundering the Ship, they did not much regard, as not knowing their Value.</P>
<P>At length he came to <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> and seem'd to have a desire of settling in those Parts, and some of his Companions went on shore there also, but he changed his Resolution, and proposed to the few of his Companions who were left, to sail for <HI>Ireland,</HI> which they consented to: He found out that <HI>New-England</HI> was not a proper Place for him, because a great deal of his Wealth lay in Diamonds; and should he have produced them there, he would have certainly been seiz'd on Suspicion of Pyracy.</P>
<P>In their Voyage to <HI>Ireland,</HI> they avoided St. <HI>Gearge</HI>'s Channel, and sailing North about, they put into one of the Northern Ports of that Kingdom; there they disposed of their Sloop, and coming on Shore they seperated themselves, some going to <HI>Cork,</HI> and some to <HI>Dublin,</HI> and <HI>Avery</HI> never saw any of them after. When he had remain'd some Time in this Kingdom, he was afraid to offer his Dia∣monds to sale, least an Enquiry into his Manner of coming by them should occasion a Discovery; therefore considering with himself what was best to be done, he fancied there were some Persons at <HI>Bristol,</HI> whom he might venture to trust; upon which, he resolved to pass over into <HI>England;</HI> he did so, and going into <HI>Devonshire,</HI> he sent to one of these Friends to meet him, at a Town called <HI>Biddi∣ford;</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="40"/>
when he had communicated himself to his Friend, and consulted with him about the Means of his Effects, they agreed, that the safest Method would be, to put them in the Hands of some Mer∣chants, who being Men of Wealth and Credit in the World, no Enquiry would be made how they came by them; this Friend telling him he was very intimate with some who were very fit for the Pur∣pose, and if he would but allow them a good Com∣mission, would do the Business very faithfully. <HI>Avery</HI> liked the Proposal, for he found no other Way of managing his Affairs, since he could not Appear in them himself; therefore his Friend go∣ing back to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and opening the Matter to the Mer∣chants, they made <HI>Avery</HI> a Visit at <HI>Biddiford,</HI> where after some Protestations of Honour and Integrity, he delivered them his Effects, consisting of Dia∣monds, and some Vessels of Gold; they gave him a little Money for his present Subsistance, and so they parted.</P>
<P>He changed his Name, and lived at <HI>Biddiford,</HI> without making any Figure, and therefore there was no great Notice taken of him; yet he let one or two of his Relations know where he was, who came to see him. In some Time his little Money was spent, yet he heard nothing from his Mer∣chants; he writ to them often, and after much Im∣portunity they sent him a small Supply, but scarce sufficient to pay his Debts: In fine the Supplies they sent him from Time to Time, were so small, that they were not sufficient to give him Bread, nor could he get that little, without a great deal of Trouble and Importunity, wherefore being weary of his Life, he went privately to <HI>Bristol,</HI> to speak to the Merchants himself, where instead of Money he met a most shocking Repulse, for when he desired them to come to an Account with him they silenced him by threatning to discover him,
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
so that our Merchants, were as good Pyrates at Land as he was at Sea.</P>
<P>Whether he was frighten'd by these Menaces, or had seen some Body else he thought knew him, is not known; but he went immediately over to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from thence sollicited his Merchants, very hard for a Supply, but to no Purpose, for he was even reduced to Beggary: In this Extremity he was resolv'd to return and cast himself upon them, let the Consequence be what it would. He put himself on Board a trading Vessel, and work'd his Passage over to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> from whence he tra∣velled on Foot to <HI>Biddiford,</HI> where he had been but a few Days before he fell sick and died; not being worth as much as would buy him a Coffin.</P>
<P>Thus have I given, all that could be collected of any Certainty concerning this Man; rejecting the idle Stories, which were made of his fantastick Greatness, by which it appears, that his Actions were more inconsiderable, than those of other Py∣rates, since him, though he made more Noise in the World.</P>
<P>Now, we shall turn back and give our Readers some Account of what became of the too Sloops.</P>
<P>We took Notice, of the Rage and Confusion, which must have seized them, upon their missing of <HI>Avery;</HI> however, they continued their Course, some of them still flattering themselves, that he had only outfail'd them in the Night, and that they should find him at the Place of Rendezvous: But when they came there, and could hear no Ty∣dings of him, there was an end of Hope. It was Time to consider, what they should do with them∣selves, their stock of Sea Provision was almost spent, and tho' there was Rice, and Fish, and Fowl, to be had ashore, yet these would not keep for Sea, without being properly cured with Salt, which they had no Conveniency of doing; therefore,
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
since they could not go a Cruizing any more, it was Time to think of establishing themselves at Land; to which Purpose, they took all Things out of the Sloops, made Tents of the Sails, and encamp∣ed themselves, having a large Quantity of Ammu∣nition, and abundance of small Arms.</P>
<P>It must be observed, that the Natives of <HI>Madagas∣car,</HI> are a kind of Negroes, they differ from those of <HI>Guiney,</HI> in their Hair, which is long, and their Complexion is not so good a Jet; they have innu∣merable little Princes, among them, who are con∣tinually making War, upon one another; their Pri∣soners are their Slaves, and they either sell them, or put them to Death, as they please: When our Pyrates first settled amongst them, their Alliance was much courted by these Princes, so they some∣times joined one, sometimes another, but whereso∣ever they sided, they were sure to be Victorious; for the Negroes here, had no Fire Arms, nor did they understand their Use; so that at length, these Pyrates became so terrible to the Negroes, that if two or three of them, were only seen on one Side, when they were going to engage, the opposite Side would fly, without striking a Blow.</P>
<P>By these Means, they not only became feared, but powerful; all the Prisoners of War, they took to be their Slaves, they married the most beautiful of the Negroe Women, not one or two, but as many as they liked; so that every one of them had as great a Seraglio as the Grand Seignior at <HI>Constanti∣nople:</HI> Their Slaves they employed in planting Rice, in Fishing, Hunting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> besides which, they had abundance of others, who lived as it were, under their Protection, and to be secure from the Distur∣bances or Attacks, from their powerful Neighbours; these seemed to pay them a willing Homage. Now they began to divide from one another, each living with his own Wives, Slaves, and Dependants, like
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
a separate Prince; and as Power and Plenty natu∣rally beget Contention, they sometimes quarrelled with one another, and attack'd each other at the Head of their several Armies; and in these civil Wars, many of them were kill'd, but an Accident happened, which obliged them to Unite again, for their common Safety.</P>
<P>It must be observ'd, that these sudden great Men, had used their Power like Tyrants, for they grew wanton in Cruelty, and nothing was more com∣mon, than upon the slightest Displeasure, to cause one of their Dependants to be tied to a Tree, and shot thro' the Heart, let the Crime be what it would, whether little or great, this was always the Punishment; wherefore, the Negroes conspi∣red together, to rid themselves of these Destroyers, all in one Night; and as they now liv'd separate, the Thing might easily have been done, had not a Woman, who had been Wife or Concubine to one of them, run near twenty Miles in three Hours, to discover the Matter to them: Immediately upon the Alarm they ran together as fast as they could, so that when the Negroes approached them, they found them all up in Arms; wherefore they retired without making any Attempt.</P>
<P>This Escape, made them very cautious from that Time, and it will be worth while, to describe the Policy of these Brutish Fellows, and to shew what Measures they took to secure themselves.</P>
<P>They found that the Fear of their Power could not secure them against a Surprize, and the bravest Man may be kill'd when he is asleep, by one much his infe∣rior in Courage and Strength; therefore, as their first Security, they did all they could to foment War betwixt the Neighbouring Negroes, remaining Neuter themselves; by which means, those who were overcome, constantly fled to them for Protection, otherwise they must be either killed,
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
or made Slaves. They strengthen'd their Party, and tied some to them by Interest; when there was no War, they contrived to spirit up private Quar∣rels amongst them; and upon every little Dispute or Misunderstanding, push on one Side, or other, to Revenge; instruct them how to Attack or Surprize their Adversaries, and lend them loaded Pistols, or Firelocks to dispatch them with; the Conse∣quence of which was, that the Murderer was forc'd to fly to them, for the safety of his Life, with his Wives, Children, and Kindred.</P>
<P>Such as these were fast Friends, as their Lives de∣pended upon the safety of his Protectors; for as we observed before, our Pyrates were grown so terri∣ble, that none of their Neighbours had Resolution enough to Attack them in an open War.</P>
<P>By such Arts as these, in the Space of a few Years, their Body was greatly increased, they then began to separate themselves, and remove at a greater Distance from one another, for the Conve∣nience of more Ground, and were divided like Jews, into Tribes, each carrying with him, his Wives and Children, (of which, by this Time they had a large Family,) as also their Quota of Dependants and Followers; and if Power and Command, be the Thing which distinguish a Prince, these Russians had all the Marks of Royalty about them, nay more, they had the very Fears which commonly disturb Tyrants, as may be seen by the extream Caution they took in fortifying the Places where they dwelt.</P>
<P>In this Plan of Fortification they imitated one another, their Dwellings were rather Citadels than Houses; they made Choice of a Place overgrown with Wood, and scituate near a Water; they raised a Rampart, or high Ditch round it, so strait and high, that it was impossible to climb it; and especially by those who had not the Use of scaleing Ladders:
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
Over this Ditch there was one Passage into this Wood; the Dwelling which was a Hut, was built in that Part of the Wood which the Prince, who inhabited it, thought fit, but so covered, that it could not be seen till you came at it; but the greatest Cunning lay in the Passage which lead to the Hut, which was so narrow, that no more than one Person could go a Breast, and contrived in so intri∣cate a Manner, that it was a perfect Maze or Laby∣rinth, it being round, and round, with several lit∣tle cross Ways, so that a Person that was not well acquainted with the Way, might walk several Hours round, and cross these Ways without be∣ing able to find the Hut; moreover all along the Sides of these narrow Paths, certain large Thorns, which grew upon a Tree, in that Country, were struck into the Ground with their Points upper∣most, and the Path it self, being made Crooked and Serpentine, if a Man should Attempt to come near the Hut at Night, he would certainly have struck upon these Thorns, tho' he had been provided with that Clue, which <HI>Ariadne,</HI> gave to <HI>Theseus,</HI> when he entered the Cave of the <HI>Minataur.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Tyrant like they lived, fearing and fear'd by all; and in this Scituation they were found by Captain <HI>Woods R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gers,</HI> when he went to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> in the <HI>Delicia,</HI> a Ship of 40 Guns; with a Design of buying Slaves, in order to sell to the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Batavia,</HI> or <HI>New-Holland:</HI> He happened to touch up∣on a Part of the Island, where no Ship had been seen for seven or eight Years before, where he met with some of these Pyrates, at which Time, they had been upon the Island above 25 Years, having a large motly Generation of Children, and Grand Children descended from them, there being about that Time, eleven of them remaining alive.</P>
<P>Upon their first seeing a Ship of this Force and Burthen, they suspected it to be a Man of War,
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
sent to take them; they therefore lurked within their Fastnesses, but when some from the Ship came on Shore, without any shew of Hostility, and offer∣ing to Trade with the Negroes, they ventured to come out of their Holes, attended like Princes; and since they actually are Kings <HI>De Facto,</HI> which is a Kind of a Right, we ought to speak of them as such.</P>
<P>Having been so many Years upon this Island, it may be imagined, their Cloaths had long been worn out, so that their Majesties were extreamly out at the Elbows; I cannot say they were ragged, since they had no Cloaths, they had nothing to cover them, but the Skins of Beasts, without any tanning, but with all the Hair on, nor a Shoe nor Stocking, so that they looked like the Pictures of <HI>Hercules,</HI> in the Lion's Skin; and being overgrown with Beard, and Hair upon their Bodies, they ap∣peared the most Savage Figures that a Man's Ima∣gination can frame.</P>
<P>However, they soon got rigg'd, for they sold great Numbers of those poor People under them, for Cloaths, Knives, Saws, Powder and Ball, and many other Things, and became so familiar that they went on Board the <HI>Delicia,</HI> and were observed to be very curious, examining the inside of the Ship, and very familiar with the Men, inviting them ashore. Their Design in doing this, as they after∣wards confessed, was to try, if it was not practi∣cable to surprize the Ship in the Night, which they judged very easy, in Case there was but a slender Watch kept on Board, they having Boats, and Men enough at Command, but it seems the Captain was aware of them, and kept so strong a Watch upon Deck, that they found it was in vain to make any Attempt; wherefore, when some of the Men went ashore, they were for inveigling them, and drawing them into a Plot, for seizing the Cap∣tain,
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
and securing the rest of the Men under Hatches, when they should have the Night-Watch, promising a Signal to come on Board to join them; proposing, if they succeeded, to go a Pyrating to∣gether, not doubting, but with that Ship, they should be able to take any Thing they met in the Sea: But the Captain observing an Intimacy grow∣ing betwixt them, and some of his Men, thought it could be for no good; he therefore broke it off in Time, not suffering them so much as to talk to∣gether, and when he sent a Boat on Shore with an Officer to treat with them, about the Sale of Slaves, the Crew remain'd on Board the Boat, and no Man was suffered to talk with them, but the Person de∣puted by him, for that Purpose.</P>
<P>Before he sailed away, and they found that no∣thing was to be done, they confessed all the Designs, they had formed against him. Thus he left them, as he found them, in a great deal of dirty State, and Royalty, but with fewer Subjects than they had, having as we observed, sold many of them; and if Ambition be the darling Passion of Men, no doubt they were happy. One of these great Prin∣ces had formerly been a Waterman upon the <HI>Thames,</HI> where having committed a Murder, he fled to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> and was of the Number of those who run away with the Sloops, the rest had been all soremast Men, nor was there a Man amongst them, who could either read or write, and yet their Secretaries of State had no more Learning than themselves. This is all the Account we can give of these Kings of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> some of whom it is probable are reigning to this Day.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the Growth of the Pyrates in the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>their Settlement in</HI> Providence, <HI>and the Arrival of Governor</HI> Rogers, <HI>at that Island.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Rise of the Pyrates since the late War with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or at least the En∣crease of them has been principally owing to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> who on Pretence of securing their Trade, and preventing Interlo∣pers, carry on a Kind of a War against the <HI>English</HI> Merchants Ships, by their <HI>Guarda del Costa,</HI> or Guard Ships; and Complaint being made thereof, to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Governors, the Merchants were never able to procure Satisfaction, for the Losses at any Time sustained by these <HI>Spanish</HI> Pyrates; which was Pro∣vocation enough to them to Attempt something against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by way of Reprisal; and a fair Opportunity offering it self in the Year 1716, the Traders of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> took Care not to slip it over, but made the best Use of it their Circum∣stances would permit them.</P>
<P>It was about two Years before, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Galleons or Plate Fleet, had been Cast away, in the Gulf of <HI>Florida;</HI> and several Vessels from the <HI>Havana,</HI> were at Work, with diving Engines, to Fish up the Silver that was on board the Galleons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had recovered some Millions of Peices of Eight, and had carried it all to the <HI>Ha∣vana;</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
but they had at present about 350000 Peices of Eight in Silver, then upon the Spot, and were daily taking up more. In the mean time, two Ships, and three Sloops, fitted out from <HI>Jamaica, Barbad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, &amp;c.</HI> and go away to the Gulph, and find the <HI>Spaniards</HI> there upon the Wreck; the Money be∣fore spoken of, was left on Shore, deposited in a Store-House, under the Government of two Com∣missaries, and a Guard of about 60 Soldiers.</P>
<P>The Rovers came directly upon the Place, bring their little Fleet to an Anchor, and in a Word, landing 300 Men, they attack'd the Guard, who immediately run away; and thus they seized the Treasure, which they carried off, making the best of their Way to <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>In their Way, they unhappily met with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ship, bound from <HI>Proto Bello</HI> to the <HI>Havana,</HI> with a great many rich Goods, <HI>viz.</HI> Bales of Cochineal, Casks of Indico, and 60000 Peices of Eight more, which, their Hands being in, they took, and having rifled the Vessel let her go.</P>
<P>They went away to <HI>Jamaica</HI> with their Booty, and were followed thither, that is in View of the Port, by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who having seen them thi∣ther, went back to the Governour of the <HI>Havana,</HI> with the Account of it, who immediately sent a Vessel to the Governour of <HI>Jamaica</HI> to complain of this Robberry, and to reclaim the Goods.</P>
<P>As it was in full Peace, and contrary to all Justice and Right, that this Fact was committed, they were soon made sensible, that the Government at <HI>Jamaica</HI> would not suffer them to go unpunished, much less protect them. Therefore they saw a Necessity of shifting for themselves; so to make bad worse, they went to Sea again, tho' not without disposing their Cargo to good Advantage, and fur∣nishing themselves with Ammunition, Provisions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and being thus made desperate, they turn'd
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
Pyrates, robbing not the <HI>Spaniards</HI> only, but their own Countrymen, and any Nation, they could lay their Hands on.</P>
<P>It happened about this Time, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> with three or four small Men of War, fell upon our Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> and after they had made Prizes of the following Ships and Vessels, they gave the Men belonging to them, three Sloops to carry them home, but these Men being made desperate by their Misfortunes, and meeting with the Pyrates, they took on with them, and so encreas'd their Number.</P>

Tho these Pyrates consorted together, they were not under the Government of one particular Head, as Admiral, but each Captain and Company were regulated by their own Laws, independently of the rest; nor were the Captains themselves always obey'd, every thing of Moment being carried by the Vote of the Company, the Captain having only a double Vote in all Elections; and all Prizes that were taken, were divided equally between the Men who took them, whether they were in one Ship or Vessel, or two, or three; the Captains receiving two Shares, and the Officers a Share and a half, and others a share and quarter, and a single share to each private Man; but, upon any notable Piece of Service, the principal Pyrates would take upon them, to give away a quarter, or a half Share of one Man's, whom they found remiss in their Duty, to another whom they esteem'd of more Worth and Merit.</P>
<P>The Rovers being now pretty strong, they con∣sulted together, about getting some Place of Re∣treat, where they might lodge their Wealth, clean and repair their Ships, and make themselves a kind of Abode. They were not long in resolving, but fixed upon the Island of <HI>Providence,</HI> the most consi∣derable of the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, lying in the Latti∣tude of about 24 Degrees North, and to the East∣ward of the <HI>Spanish Florida.</HI></P>
<P>This Island, is about 28 Miles long, and eleven where broadest, and has a Harbour big enough to hold 500 Sail of Ships; before which lyes a small Island, which makes two Inlets to the Harbour, at either Way there is a Bar, over which no Ship of 500 Tun can pass. The <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands were pos∣sess'd by the <HI>English</HI> till the Year 1700, when the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> from <HI>Petit-Guavus,</HI> invaded them, took the Fort and Governour in the Island of <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and destroyed the Settlements, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
carried off half the Blacks, and the rest of the People who fled to the Woods, retired afterwards to <HI>Carolina,</HI> since which time they have been neglected, notwithstanding the great Advantage they are of in time of War; for the <HI>Spanish</HI> Plate Fleet are oblig∣ed to pass very near them in their Voyages home∣ward to the <HI>Havana,</HI> and consequently lay fair to be disturbed in their Passage by Ships belong∣ing to these Settlements.</P>
<P><Q>In <HI>March,</HI> 1705-6, the House of Lords did in an Address to her late Majesty set forth, “That the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> had twice, during the Time of the War, over run and plundered the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, that there was no Form of Government there: That the Harbour of the Isle of Providence, might be easily put in a Posture of Defence, and that it would be of dangerous Consequence, should those Islands fall into the Hands of the Enemy; wherefore the Lords humbly besought her Ma∣jesty, to use such Methods, as she should think proper for taking the said Island into her Hands, in Order to secure the same to the Crown of this Kingdom, and to the Security, and Advantage” of the Trade thereof.</Q></P>
<P>But, however it happened, no means were used in Compliance to that Address, for securing the <HI>Baha∣ma</HI> Islands, till the <HI>English</HI> Pyrates had made <HI>Pro∣vidence</HI> their Retreat, and general Receptacle; then 'twas found absolutely necessary, in order to dis∣lodge that troublesome Colony; and Information being made by the Merchants to the Government, of the Mischief they did, and were likely to do, his Majesty was pleased to grant the following Order in Council.</P>

<P>Besides these Frigots, two Men of War were or∣dered to attend Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> late Commander of the two <HI>Bristol</HI> Ships, called the <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Dutchess,</HI> that took the rich <HI>Acapulco</HI> Ship, and made a Tour round the Globe.

<P><HI>WHereas we have received Information, that several Persons, Subjects of</HI> Great Brittain, <HI>have since the 24th Day of</HI> June, <HI>in the Year of our Lord,</HI> 1715, <HI>committed divers Pyracies and Robberies, upon the High-Seas, in the</HI> West-Indies, <HI>or adjoyning to our Plantations, which hath and may Occasion great Damage to the Mer∣chants of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>and others trading into those Parts; and tho' we have appointed such a Force, as we judge sufficient for suppressing the said Pyracies, yet the more effectually to put an End to the same, we have thought fit, by and with the Advice of our Privy Council, to Issue this our Royal Proclamation; and we do hereby promise, and declare, that in Case any of the said Pyrates, shall</HI>

<HI>on, or before, the 5th of</HI> September, <HI>in the Year of our Lord,</HI> 1718, <HI>surrender him, or themselves, to one of our Principal Secretaries of State in</HI> Great Britain, <HI>or</HI> Ireland, <HI>or to any Governor, or Deputy Governor, of any of our Plantations beyond the Seas; every such Pyrate, and Pyrates so surrendering him, or themselves, as aforesaid, shall have our gracious Pardon, of, and for such, his, or their Pyracy, or Pyracies, by him, or them committed before the fifth of</HI> January <HI>next ensuing.

<P>Given at our Court, at <HI>Hampton Court,</HI> the fifth Day of <HI>September,</HI> 1717, in the fourth Year of our Reign.</P>
<P>God save the KING.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>May or June,</HI> 1718, Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> arrived at the Place of his Government, in his Majesty's Ship <HI>Melford,</HI> in the Company of ano∣ther of his Majesty's Ships, I think the <HI>Mermaid,</HI> and found in <HI>Providence</HI> Harbour, about 25 Sail of Ships and Vessels, being several of the Pyrates, with their Prizes, the principal of which, were <HI>Vane, Hornigold,</HI> and <HI>Burgess;</HI> Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> Major <HI>Penner,</HI> Captain <HI>Jennings,</HI> Captain <HI>Williams,</HI> and others were cruizing for Prey; the particular Histories of whom we shall give in their Order, after we have given some little Account of the Affairs of this Place.</P>
<P>In the entering of <HI>Providence,</HI> there happened to be some small Mismanagement, by which the most notorious Rover escaped, which was in this Manner. I have before described the Harbour to have two Inlets, by means of a small Island lying at the Mouth; at each of which, one of the Men of War should have sailed in; or it they had thought there had not been Water enough one Way, for the Ship's Draught, a Man of War might have block'd up one Passage, while the other had entered, and brought all the Pyrates to the Terms they required, which was only to have accepted of his Majesty's Mercy, pursuant to the Proclamation; but both the Men of War going in at the same Channel, <HI>Vane,</HI> as soon as he perceived them, Slips his Cable, sets Fire to his Prize, and resolutely Sails out at the other; and notwithstanding Governor <HI>Rogers</HI> sent a Boat with the Proclamation on Board of <HI>Vane,</HI> he
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
obstinately refused to accept of Grace, but fired several Guns at the Man of War, and got clear off, tho' he reign'd not long afterwards, as I shall shew in its Place. All the rest surrendred to his Majesty's Pardon, and had Certificates given them by the Governor, to the Number of between four and five hundred.</P>
<P>As soon as Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> had settled himself in his Government, he built a Fort for his Defence, and Garrisoned it with the People he found upon the Island, and the quondam Pyrates he formed into Companies, appointing Officers of those whom he most confided in, and then set about to settle a Trade with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Mexico;</HI> in one of which Voyages, Captain <HI>Burgess</HI> above mentioned, died, and Captain <HI>Hornigold,</HI> another of the famous Pyrates, was Cast away upon Rocks, a great Way from Land, and perished, but five of his Men got into a Canoe, and were sav'd.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> sent out a Sloop to get Provi∣sions, and gave the Command to one <HI>John Augur,</HI> one of the Pyrates, who had accepted of the Act of Grace; in their Voyage they met with two Sloops, and <HI>John,</HI> and his Comrades, not yet for∣geting their old Business, made Use of their former Freedom, and took out of them in Money and Goods, to the Value of about 500 l. after this they steer'd away for <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> not being satisfy'd whe∣ther the Governor would admit them to carry on two Trades at once, and so thought to have bidden Farewel to the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands; but as ill Luck would have it, they met with a violent Turnado, wherein they lost their Mast, and were drove back to one of the uninhabited <HI>Bahama</HI>'s, and lost their Sloop; the Men got all ashore, and lived up and down in the Woods, for a little Time, till Governor <HI>Rogers</HI> happening to hear of their Expedition, and where
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
they had got to, sent out an armed Sloop to the aforesaid Island; the Master of which, with good Words, and fair Promises, got them on Board, and brought them all to <HI>Providence,</HI> being eleven Persons, ten of which were try'd at a Court of Ad∣miralty, convicted and hanged, by the other's Evi∣dence, in the Sight of all their former Compa∣nions, and fellow Thieves. The Criminals, would fain have spirited up the pardon'd Pyrates, to rescue them out of the Hands of the Officers of Justice, telling them, from the Gallows, that, <HI>They never thought to have seen the Time, when ten such Men as they, should be ty'd up, and hanged like Dogs, and four hundred of their sworn Friends and Companions, quietly standing by to behold the Spectacle.</HI> One <HI>Humphrey Mor∣rice</HI> urged the Matter farther than the rest, taxing them with Pusilanimity and Cowardice, as if it were a Breach of Duty in them not to Rise, and save them from the ignominious Death they were going to suffer. But, 'twas all in vain, they were not told, it was their Business to turn their Minds to another World, and sincerely to Repent of what Wickedness they had done in this. <HI>Yes,</HI> an∣swered one of them, <HI>I do heartily Repent; I Repent I had not done more Mischief, and that we did not cut the Throats of them that took us, and I am extremely sorry that you an't all hang'd, as well as we. So do I,</HI> says another. <HI>And I,</HI> says a third; and then they were all turned off, without making any other dying Speeches, except one <HI>Dennis Macarty,</HI> who told the People, <HI>That some Friends of his had often said he should die in his Shoes, but that he would make them Lyars,</HI> and so kicked them off. And thus ended the Lives, with their Adventures, of those miserable Wretches, who may serve as sad Examples of the little Effect Mercy has upon Men once abandon'd to an evil Course of Life. I proceed now to the particular Hi∣story of the rest, and others that took up the Trade
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
afterwards, and I doubt, shall be obliged to pur∣sue their Histories, as far as I have done these just mentioned, <HI>viz,</HI> to the Gallows, and there to take my leave of them.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. OF Captain <HI>MARTEL,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Pyrate was one of the first who took up the Trade since the Peace of <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI> It is to be observed, that in War-Time, there are none at all, because so many arm'd Vessels being continually in Commission, and going out against their Enemies, it would render the Business too preca∣rious, as well as hazardous; and since in Time of War, any Veslel may obtain Commission from the Governors of Islands, and Provinces, to whom Application is made, to attack, plunder, and de∣stroy, all Ships and Vessels, belonging to the Prince or Country they are in War with, none will be so foolish, as to prey at large on the Seas, especi∣ally in Time of Danger, and run the Hazard of their Necks, when they may have a lawful Au∣thority for doing the same Thing, only with some Restrictions.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="60"/>
The Multitude of Men and Vessels, employ'd this, Way in Time of War, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> is ano∣ther Reason, for the Number of Pyrates in a Time of Peace: This cannot be supposed to be a Re∣flection on any of our <HI>American</HI> Governments, much less on the King himself, by whose Authority such Commissions are granted, because of the Reasona∣bleness, and absolute Necessity, there is for the doing of it; yet the Observation is just, for so many idle People employing themselves in Privateers, for the sake of Plunder and Riches, which they al∣ways spend as fast as they get, that when the War is over, and they can have no farther Business in the Way of Life they have been used to, they too readily engage in Acts of Pyracy, which being but the same Practice without Commission, they make very little Distinction betwixt the Law∣fulness of one, and the Unlawfulness of the other.</P>
<P>I have not enquired so far back, as to know the Original of this Rover, but I believe he and his Gang, were some Privateer's Men belonging to the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in the preceeding War; his Story is but short, for his Reign was so; an End ha∣ving been put to his Adventures in good Time, when he was growing strong and formidable. We find him Commander of a Pyrate Sloop of eight Guns, and 80 Men, in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> 1716 cruising off <HI>Jamaica, Cuba, &amp;c.</HI> about which Time he took the <HI>Berkley</HI> Galley, Captain <HI>Saunders,</HI> and plundered him of 1000 l. in Money, and after∣wards met with a Ship called the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> from whom he took some Money, and Provisions, be∣sides Goods, to a good Value.</P>
<P>They proceeded to the Port of <HI>Cavena,</HI> at the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and in their Way took two Sloops, which they plundered, and let go; and off the Port fell in with a fine Galley, with 20 Guns,
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
called the <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Martha,</HI> Captain <HI>Wilson,</HI> which they attack'd under their pyratical Black-Flag, and made themselves Masters of her. They put some of the Men ashore, and others they detain'd, as they had done several others, to encrease their Company, but Captain <HI>Martel,</HI> charged Captain <HI>Wilson,</HI> to advise his Owners, that their Ship would answer his Purpose exactly, by taking one Deck down, and as for the Cargo, which consisted chiefly of Logwood and Sugar, he would take Care it should be carry'd to a good Market.</P>
<P>Having fitted up the aforesaid Ship, as they de∣signed, they mounted her with 22 Guns, 100 Men, and left 25 Hands in the Sloop, and so proceeded to Cruize off the Leeward Islands, where they met with but too much Success. After the taking of a Sloop and a Brigantine, they gave Chase to a stout Ship, which they came up with, and at Sight of the Pyrate's Flag, she struck to the Robbers, being a Ship of 20 Guns, called the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> bound for <HI>Newfoundland;</HI> Captain <HI>Martel</HI> made the Men Prisoners, and carry'd the Ship with him.</P>
<P>The middle of <HI>December</HI> the Pyrates took ano∣ther Galley in her Voyage home from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> called the <HI>Kent,</HI> Captain <HI>Lawton,</HI> and shifted her Provi∣sions aboard their own Ship, and let her go, which obliged her to Sail back to <HI>Jamaica</HI> for a Supply for her Voyage. After this they met with a small Ship and a Sloop, belonging to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> out of both they took Provisions, and then parted with them, having first taken out some of their Hands, who were willing to be forced to go along with them. The <HI>Greyhound</HI> Galley of <HI>London,</HI> Captain <HI>Evans,</HI> from <HI>Guiney,</HI> to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> was the next that had the Mis∣fortune to fall in their Way, which they did not detain long, for as soon as they could get out all her Gold Dust, Elephant's Teeth, and 40 Slaves, they sent her onwards upon her Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="62"/>
They concluded now, that 'twas high Time to get into Harbour and refit, as well as to get Re∣freshments themselves, and wait an Opportunity to dispose of their Cargo; therefore 'twas resol∣ved to make the best of their Way to <HI>Santa Crux,</HI> a small Island in the Lattitude of 18, 30, N. ten Mile long, and two broad, lying South East of <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French</HI> Settlements. Here they thought they might lye privately enough for some Time, and fit themselves for further Mis∣chief. They met with a Sloop by the Way, which they took along with them, and in the Beginning of the Year 1716-17, they arrived at their Port, having a Ship of 20 Guns, a Sloop of eight, and three Prizes <HI>viz.</HI> another Ship of 20 Guns, a Sloop of four Guns, and another Sloop last taken; with this little Fleet, they got into a small Harbour or Road, the N. W. Part of the Island, and warp'd up two Creeks, which were made by a little Island lying within the Bay; (I am the more particular now, because I shall take leave of the Gentlemen, at this Place.) They had here bare 16 Foot Water, at the deepest, and but 13 or 14, at the shallow∣est, and nothing but Rocks and Sands without, which secured them from Wind and Sea, and likewise from any considerable Force coming against them.</P>
<P>When they had all got in, the first Thing they had to do, was to Guard themselves in the best Manner they could; they made a Battery of four Guns upon the Island, and another Battery of two Guns on the North Point of the Road, and warp'd one of the Sloops with eight Guns, at the Mouth of the Channel, to hinder any Vessels from coming in; when this was done they went to Work on their Ship, unrigging, and unloading, in order to Clean, where I shall leave them a while, till I bring other Company to 'em.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="63"/>
In the Month of <HI>November,</HI> 1716, General <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI> Commander in chief of all the <HI>Leeward Car∣ribee Islands,</HI> sent a Sloop Express to Captain <HI>Hume,</HI> at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> Commander of his Majesty's Ship, <HI>Scarborough,</HI> of 30 Guns, and 140 Men, to acquaint him, that two Pyrate Sloops of 12 Guns each, molested the Colonies, having plundered several Vessels. The <HI>Scarborough</HI> had buryed twenty Men, and had near forty Sick, and therefore was but in ill State to go to Sea: However, Captain <HI>Hume</HI> left his Sick Men behind, and sailed to the other Islands, for a supply of Men, taking 20 Soldiers from <HI>Antegoa;</HI> at <HI>Nevis,</HI> he took 10, and 10 at St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> and then sailed to the Island of <HI>An∣guilla,</HI> where he learned, that sometime before, two such Sloops had been at <HI>Spanish-Town,</HI> otherwise, called, one of the <HI>Virgin</HI> Islands: Accordingly, the next Day, the <HI>Scarborough</HI> came to <HI>Spanish</HI> Town, but could hear no News of the Sloops, only, that they had been there about <HI>Christmas,</HI> (it being then the 15th of <HI>January.)</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Hume,</HI> finding no Account could be had of these Pyrates, designed to go back, the next Day, to <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> but, it happened, that Night, that a Boat anchor'd there from <HI>Santa Crux,</HI> and infor∣med him, that he saw a Pyrate Ship of 22 or 24 Guns, with other Vessels, going in to the North West Part of the Island aforesaid. The <HI>Scarborough</HI> weigh'd immediately, and the next Morning came in Sight of the Rovers, and their Prizes, and stood to them, but the Pilot refused to venture in with the Ship; all the while the Pyrates fir'd red hot Bullets from the Shore. At length, the Ship came to an Anchor, along Side the Reef, near the Chan∣nel, and cannonaded for several Hours, both the Vessels and Batteries: About four in the Af∣ternoon, the Sloop, that guarded the Channel was sunk, by the Shot of the Man of War; then she
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
cannonaded the Pyrate Ship of 22 Guns, that lay behind the Island. The next Night, viz. the 18th, it falling Calm, Captain <HI>Hume</HI> weigh'd, fearing he might fall on the Reef, and so stood off and on for a Day or two, to block them up. On the 20th, in the Evening, they observed the Man of War to stand off to Sea, and took the Opportunity to warp out, in order to slip away from the Island; but at Twelve o'Clock they run a Ground, and then seeing the <HI>Scarborough</HI> about, standing in again, as their Case was desperate, so they were put into the utmost Confusion; they quitted their Ship, and set her on Fire, with 20 Negroes in her, who were all burnt; 19 of the Pyrates made their Escape in a small Sloop, but the Captain and the rest, with 20 Negroes, betook to the Woods, where 'twas probable they might starve, for 'twas never heard what became of 'em afterwards: Cap∣tain <HI>Hume</HI> released the Prisoners, with the Ship and Sloop that remained, and then went after the two Pyrate Sloops first mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. OF Major <HI>STEDE BONNET,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>THE Major was a Gentleman of good Re∣putation in the Island of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> was Master of a plentiful Fortune, and had the Advantage of a liberal Education. He had the least Temptation of any Man to follow such a Course of Life, for his Condition was superior to any Thing that could have been expected from the most fortunate Adventures in the pyratical Way: It was surprizing to every one, to hear of the Major's Enterprize, in the Island where he lived: and as he was generally esteem'd and honour∣ed, before he broke out into open Acts of Pyracy, so he was afterwards rather pitty'd than condem∣ned, by those that had been acquainted with him, believing that his Humour of going a pyrating, proceeded from a Disorder in his Mind, which had been but too visible in him, some Time before this wicked Undertaking. Nor was the Major at all qualified for this Business, he not being ac∣quainted with Sea Affairs, but had always lived at Land, in a peaceable and creditable manner, with a seeming Sense of Virtue and Religion; insomuch, that any one would have thought him Proof against
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
such an abominable Practice; if the Danger and Hazard attending it, had not been sufficient to have created in him an Abhorrence of that Way of Living.</P>
<P>However, Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> fitted out a Sloop with ten Guns, and 70 Men, entirely at his own Ex∣pence, and in the Night-Time sailed from <HI>Barba∣does.</HI> He called his Sloop the <HI>Revenge;</HI> his first Cruize was off the Capes of <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he took several Ships, and plundered them of Provisions, Cloaths, Money, Ammunition, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in particular the <HI>Ann,</HI> Capt <HI>Montgomery,</HI> from <HI>Glascow;</HI> the <HI>Turbet,</HI> from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which for Country sake, after they had taken out the principal Part of the La∣ding, the Pyrate Crew set her on Fire; the <HI>Endea∣vour,</HI> Captain <HI>Scot,</HI> from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and the <HI>Young,</HI> from <HI>Leith.</HI> From thence they went to <HI>New-York,</HI> and off the <HI>East</HI> End of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> took a Sloop bound for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> after which they stood in with the Sloop, and landed at <HI>Gardner</HI>'s <HI>Island,</HI> but in a peaceable Manner, and bought Provisions for the Campany's Use, which they paid for, and so went off again without Molestation.</P>
<P>Some Time after, which was in <HI>August</HI> 1717, <HI>Bon∣net</HI> and his Crew, came off the Bar of <HI>South-Car∣rolina,</HI> and took a Sloop, and a Brigantine bound in; the Sloop belonged to <HI>Barbadoes, Joseph Palmer</HI> Master, laden with Rum, Sugar, and Negroes; and the Brigantine came from <HI>New-England, Thomas Porter</HI> Master, whom they plundered, and then dismiss'd; but they sailed away with the Sloop, and at an Inlet in <HI>North-Carolina</HI> careen'd by her, and then set her on Fire.</P>
<P>After the Sloop had cleaned, they put to Sea, but came to no Resolution what Course to take; the Crew were divided in their Opinions, some be∣ing for one Thing, and some another, so that no∣thing
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
but Confusion seem'd to attend all their Schemes. The Captain found his Authority too weak to bring them to Order, nor could he prevail in any single Instance, for tho' the Sloop was all his own, they began to shew a Disrepect, even to a Con∣tempt of all he said or did. The Major was no Sailor, as was said before, and therefore had been obliged to yield to many Things that were impo∣posed on him, during their Undertaking, for want of a competent Knowledge in maritime Affairs; till at length they thought fit to turn him out of the Command, which, by the by, was committing a sort of Pyracy upon him, and so for this Time the civil Dissention was put an End to, by ap∣pointing one <HI>Edward Thatch</HI> Commander, (who for his remarkable black ugly Beard, was more common∣ly called <HI>Black-Beard:)</HI> This Fellow was a good Sai∣lor, but a most cruel hardned Villain, bold and da∣ring to the last Degree, and would not stick at the perpetrating the most abominable Wickedness ima∣ginable; and as he was made Chief of that exe∣crable Gang, so it might be said that his Post was not unduly filled, for <HI>Black-Beard</HI> was truly the Su∣perior in Roguery, of all that Company, as will be found in it's proper Place.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bonnet</HI> continued still with them, but in no Office aboard, neither did he concern himself much with their Affairs, not being well pleased, one must think, at the unkind Usage he had re∣ceived, much less could he submit to a mean Ras∣kal, which he had ship'd as a Fore-Mast-Man at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI> The Major now saw his Folly, but could not help himself, which made him Melan∣choly; he reflected upon his past Course of Life, and was confounded with Shame, when he thought upon what he had done: His Behaviour was taken Notice of by the other Pyrates, who liked him
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
never the better for it; and he often declared to some of them, that he would gladly leave off that Way of Living, being fully tired of it; but he should be a shamed to see the Face of any <HI>English-man</HI> again; therefore if he could get to <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Portugal,</HI> where he might be undiscovered, he would spend the Remainder of his Days in either of those Countries, otherwise he must continue in the same Course, as long as he lived.</P>
<P>I must drop the Major a-while, and pursue the Pyracies of this Crew as under <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Command, whose Name we shall now mention instead of <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s; for indeed he had not only the chief Rule, but the greatest Sway of any Pyrate Captain, yet known, over his Men; and was so very Insolent, Barbarous, and Tyrannical, as gave a shock to Na∣ture; as will be shewn, when I come to treat par∣ticularly of the History of his Actions, indepen∣dantly of that of Major <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Thatch</HI> was pleased to take a Cruize off the Leeward Islands, in the Sloop he was Captain of, and presently took a Sloop with Provisions, which came very seasonable to his Hands; in this Sloop they put on board 30 Men, having en∣creased their Company, by taking 'em out of every Ship they made Prize of; and one <HI>Richards</HI> having a Mind to be a Captain too, was appointed to Command her. So beating up to Windward some Days afterwards, they met with a stout Ship, with upwards of 20 Guns, which they attack'd very boldly under their proper Colours, <HI>(viz.)</HI> a black Flag with a Death's Head in the Middle, and, after a small dispute, carry'd her; she was a <HI>French Guiney-Man,</HI> bound to <HI>Martineco.</HI> This Ship was soon made fit for Pyrate Service, aboard of which <HI>Thatch</HI> mounted forty Guns, taking every Thing he thought Necessary out of the Sloop <HI>Richards</HI> com∣manded, and gave it the <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> to carry them

to the aforesaid Island, so <HI>Thatch</HI> went into the great Ship, which was christned, <HI>The Queen Ann's Revenge.</HI></P>
<P>Some Days after this Change, the latter End of <HI>December,</HI> as <HI>Thatch</HI> was cruising off the Island, St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> they descry'd at Mast-Head a Sail, and gave Chase to it; they found her a large Ship, and expected some warm Work, but she had the Misfor∣tune, with little or no Resistance, to fall a Prize into the Hands of these Robbers; who set all the Men ashore on the Island aforesaid, plundered her of what they thought fit, and then set Fire to her: This Ship was called the <HI>Great Allen, Christopher Tay∣lor</HI> Commander.</P>
<P>In this Cruize, they took another Ship and a Sloop, which they plundered and let go, and after∣wards fell in with the <HI>Scarborough</HI> of 30 Guns. The Man of War engaged <HI>The Queen Ann's Revenge</HI> for three or four Hours, but not being strong enough to do any notable Service against the Pyrates, returned to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the Place of her Station, and <HI>Thatch</HI> steered for the Coast of the <HI>Spanish-America,</HI> and cleaned.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> continued still in the Ship but in no Command; and after cleaning they proceeded to the Bay of <HI>Honduras;</HI> at <HI>Turniff,</HI> ten Leagues short of the Bay, they came to an Anchor on the fourth of <HI>April,</HI> 1718, and took in fresh Water; the next Morning they saw a Sloop coming in, where∣upon <HI>Richards</HI> slip'd his Cable in the <HI>Revenge,</HI> and went to meet her, who seeing his black Flag, im∣mediately struck, and was brought to an Anchor, under the Stern of <HI>the Queen Ann's Revenge;</HI> she was called the <HI>Adventure, David Harriot</HI> Master, from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> they took the Master out, and sent Pyrate Hands on Board the Prize, and put in one <HI>Hands</HI> to Command her.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="70"/>
On the ninth Ditto, the Ship and Sloops weigh'd, and came to <HI>Honduras</HI> Bay, where lay four Sloops, and a Ship, three of the Sloops belonged to <HI>Jona∣than Bernard,</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the other to Captain <HI>James;</HI> the Ship was of <HI>Boston,</HI> called the <HI>Protestant Caesar,</HI> Captain <HI>Wyar</HI> Commander. <HI>Thatch</HI> hoisted his black Colours, and fired a Gun, upon which Captain <HI>Wyar,</HI> and all his Men left their Ship, and got ashore in their Boat: <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Quarter-Master, and eight of his Crew, took Possession of <HI>Wyar</HI>'s Ship, and <HI>Richards</HI> secured all the Sloops, one of which they burnt out of spight to the Owner; and the <HI>Protestant Caesar</HI> they also burnt, after they had Plunder'd her, because she belong∣ed to <HI>Boston,</HI> where some Men had been hanged for Pyracy; and the three Sloops belonging to <HI>Bernard</HI> they let go.</P>
<P>From hence the Rovers sail'd to <HI>Turkill,</HI> and then to the <HI>Grand Camania,</HI> an Island belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> lying about sixty Leagues to the Westward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they took a small Turtler, and so to the <HI>Havana,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Bahama</HI> Wrecks, and from the <HI>Bahama</HI> Wrecks, they sailed to <HI>Carolina,</HI> taking a Brigantine and two Sloops in their Way, where they lay off the Bar of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> for five or six Days. They took here a Ship as she was coming out, bound for <HI>London,</HI> commanded by one <HI>Robert Clark,</HI> with some Passengers on Board going for <HI>England;</HI> the next Day they took another Vessel coming out of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and also two Pinks coming into <HI>Charles-Town;</HI> likewise a Brigantine with 14 Negroes aboard; all which being done in the Face of the Town, struck a great Terror to the whole Province of <HI>Carolina,</HI> having just before been visited by <HI>Vane,</HI> another notorious Pyrate; that they abandoned themselves to Dispair, being in no Condition to resist their Force. There were eight Sail in the Harbour,
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
ready for the Sea, but none dar'd to venture out, it being almost impossible to escape their Hands. The inward bound Vessels were under the same un∣happy Dilemma, so that the Trade of this Place was totally interrupted: What made these Misfor∣tunes heavier to them, was a long expensive War, the Colony had had with the Natives, which was but just ended when these Robbers infested them.</P>
<P><HI>Thatch,</HI> or (as they more commonly call'd him) <HI>Black-beard,</HI> detained all the Ships and Prisoners, and, being in want of Medicines, resolved to de∣mand a Chest from the Government of the Pro∣vince; accordingly <HI>Richards,</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Re∣venge</HI> Sloop, with two or three more Pyrates were sent up along with Mr. <HI>Marks,</HI> one of the Prisoners, whom they had taken in <HI>Clark</HI>'s Ship, and very in∣solently made their Demands, threatning, that if they did not send immediately the Chest of Medi∣cines, and let the Pyrate's Ambassadors return, without offering any Violence to their Persons, they would murder all their Prisoners, and send up their Heads to the Governor, and also set the Ships they had taken on Fire.</P>
<P>Whilst Mr. <HI>Marks</HI> was making Application to the Council, <HI>Richards</HI> and the rest of the Pyrates, walk'd the Streets, publickly, in the Sight of all People; and tho' they were fired with the utmost Indignation against them, looking upon them as Robbers and Murtherers, and particularly the Authors of their Wrongs and Oppressions, yet they durst not so much as think of executing their Re∣venge, for Fear of bringing more Calamities upon themselves, and so they were forced to let the Villains pass with Impunity. The Government were not long in deliberating upon the Message, tho' 'twas the greatest Affront that could have been put upon them; yet for the saving so many Mens Lives, (among them, Mr. <HI>Samuel Wragg,</HI> one of
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
the Council;) they comply'd with the Necessity, and sent aboard a Chest, valued at between 3 and 400 l. and the Pyrates went back safe to their Ships.</P>
<P><HI>Blackbeard,</HI> as soon as he had received the Medi∣cines, and his Brother Rogues, let go the Ships and the Prisoners; having first taken out of them in Gold and Silver, about 1500 l. Sterling, besides Provisions and other Matters.</P>
<P>From the Bar of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> they sail'd to <HI>North-Carolina;</HI> Captain <HI>Thatch,</HI> in the Ship, which they call'd the Man of War, Captain <HI>Richards</HI> and Cap∣tain <HI>Hands</HI> in the Sloops, which they termed Pri∣vateers, and another Sloop serving them as a Tender. <HI>Thatch</HI> began now to think of breaking up the Company, and securing the Money, and the best of the Effects for himself, and some other of his Companions he had most Affection for, and to cheat the rest: Accordingly, on Pretence of run∣ning into <HI>Topsail</HI> Inlet to clean, he grounded his Ship, and then, as if it had been done unde∣fignedly, and by Accident; he Orders <HI>Hands</HI>'s Sloop to come to his Assistance, and get him off again, which he endeavouring to do, ran the Sloop on Shore near the other, and so were both lost. This done, <HI>Thatch</HI> goes into the Tender Sloop, with forty Hands, and leaves the <HI>Revenge</HI> there, which <HI>Bonnet</HI> reassumed the Command of, and goes away to <HI>Bath-Town</HI> in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> surren∣ders to the King's Pardon, and receives a Certifi∣cate. The War was now broke out between the <HI>Tripple</HI> Allies and <HI>Spain;</HI> so Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> gets a Clearance for his Sloop at <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> to go to the Island of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> with a Design (at least it was pretended so) to get the Emperor's Commission, to go a Privateering upon the <HI>Spa∣ards.</HI> When <HI>Bonnet</HI> came back to <HI>Topsail</HI> Inlet, he found that <HI>Thatch</HI> and his Gang were gone, and that they
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
had taken all the Money, small Arms, and Effects of Value out of the great Ship, and set ashore on a small Sandy Island above a League from the Main, 17 Men, no doubt with a Design they should perish, there being no Inhabitant, or Provisions to subsist withal, nor any Boat or Mate∣rials, to build, or make any kind of Launch or Vessel, to Escape from that desolate Place: They remained there two Nights, and one Day, without Subsistance, or the least Prospect of any, expecting nothing else but a lingering Death; when to their inexpressible Comfort, they saw Redemption at Hand, for Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> happening to get Intelli∣gence of their being there, by two of the Py∣rates who had escap'd <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Cruelty and had got to a poor little Village at the upper End of the Harbour, sent his Boat to make Discovery of the Truth of the Matter, which the poor Wretches seeing, made a signal to them, and so they were all brought on Board <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s Sloop.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> told all his Company, that he would take a Commission to go against the <HI>Spani∣ards,</HI> and to that End, was going to St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, therefore if they would go with him, they should be welcome; whereupon they all consented, but as the Sloop was preparing to Sail, a Bom-Boat, that brought Apples and Sider to sell to the Sloop's Men, inform'd them, that Captain <HI>Thatch</HI> lay at <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ricock</HI> Inlet, with only 18 or 20 Hands. <HI>Bonnet,</HI> who bore him a mortal Hatred for all the Insults he suffered from him, went immediately in pursuit of him, but it happened too late, for he missed of him there, and after four Days Cruize, hearing no farther News of him, they steer'd their Course to∣wards <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>July,</HI> these Adventurers came off the Capes, and meeting with a Pink with a Stock of Provisions on Board, which they happened to
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
be in Want of, they took out of her ten or twelve Barrels of Pork, and about 400 Weight of Bread; but because they would not have this set down to the Account of Pyracy, they gave them eight or ten Casks of Rice, and an old Cable in lieu thereof.</P>
<P>Two Days afterwards, they chased a Sloop of sixty Tun, and took her two Leagues off of Cape <HI>Henry;</HI> they were so Happy here, as to get a Supply of Liquor to their Victuals, for they brought from her two Hogsheads of Rum, and as many of Mo∣losses, which it seems they had need of, tho' they had not ready Money to purchase them: What Se∣curity they intended to give, I can't tell, but <HI>Bonnet</HI> sent eight Men to take Care of the Prize Sloop, who perhaps, not liking to make Use of those ac∣custom'd Freedoms, took the first Opportunity to go off with her, and <HI>Bonnet,</HI> (who was pleased to have himself called Captain <HI>Thomas,)</HI> saw them no more.</P>
<P>After this, the Major threw off all Restraint, and tho' he had just before received his Majesty's Mercy, in the Name of <HI>Stede Bonnet,</HI> he relaps'd in good Earnest into his old Vocation, by the Name of Captain <HI>Thomas,</HI> and recommenced a down right Pyrate, by taking and plundering all the Vessels he met with: He also took off Cape <HI>Henry,</HI> two Ships from <HI>Virginia</HI> bound to <HI>Glascow,</HI> out of which they took very little besides 100 Weight of Tobacco, and let them proceed on their Voyage. The next Day they took a small Sloop bound from <HI>Virginia,</HI> to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> and took away from her 20 Barrels of Pork, some Bacon, and gave him again two Bar∣rels of Rice, and a Hogshead of Molossus; out of this Sloop two Men enter'd Voluntarily. The next they took was another <HI>Virginia</HI> Man, bound to <HI>Glas∣cow,</HI> out of which they had nothing of Value, save only a few Combs, Pins, and Needles, and
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
gave her instead thereof, a Barrel of Pork, and two Barrels of Bread.</P>
<P>From <HI>Virginia,</HI> they sailed to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and in the Latitude of 38 North, they took a Scooner, coming from <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> bound to <HI>Boston,</HI> they had out of her only two Dozen of Calf-Skins, to make Covers for Guns, and two of their Hands, and detain'd her some Days. All this was but small Game, and seem'd as if they design'd only to make Provision for their Sloop against they arrived at St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s; for they hitherto had dealt fa∣vourably with all that were so unhappy as to fall into their Hands; but those that came after, far'd not so well, for in the Latitude of 39, off of <HI>De∣laware</HI> River, near <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> they took two Snows bound to <HI>Bristel,</HI> out to whom they got some Mo∣ney, besides Goods, perhaps to the Value of 150 Pounds; at the same Time they took a Sloop of sixty Tuns bound from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which, after taking some goods out of her, they dis∣miss'd along with the Snows.</P>
<P>The 29th Day of <HI>July,</HI> Captain <HI>Thomas</HI> took a Sloop of 50 Tuns, six or seven Leagues off <HI>Dela∣ware</HI> Bay, bound from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Barbadoes, Tho∣mas Read</HI> Master, loaden with Provisions, which they kept, and put four or five of their Hands on Board her. The last Day of <HI>July,</HI> they took ano∣ther Sloop of 60 Tuns, commanded by <HI>Peter Man∣waring,</HI> bound from <HI>Antegoa,</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> which they likewise kept with all the Cargo, consisting chiefly of Rum, Molosses, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, and about 25 Pound in Money, valued in all to 500 Pound.</P>
<P>The last Day of <HI>July,</HI> our Rovers with the Vessels last taken, left <HI>Delaware</HI> Bay, and sail'd to Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, where they staid too long for their Safety, for the Pyrate Sloop which they now new nam'd the <HI>Royal James,</HI> proved very leaky, so that
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
they were obliged to remain here almost two Months, to refit and repair their Vessel: They took in this River a small Shallop, which they rip∣ped up to mend the Sloop, and retarded the fur∣ther Prosecution of their Voyage, as before menti∣on'd, till the News came to <HI>Carolina,</HI> of a Pyrate Sloop's being there to Carreen with her Prizes.</P>
<P>Upon this Information, the Council of <HI>South-Caro∣lina</HI> was alarmed, and apprehended they should receive another Visit from them speedily; to pre∣vent which Colonel <HI>William Rhet,</HI> of the same Pro∣vince, waited on the Governor, and generously of∣fered himself to go with two Sloops to Attack this Pyrate; which the Governor readily accepted of, and accordingly gave the Colonel a Commis∣sion, and full Power, to fit Vessels as he thought proper for the Design.</P>
<P>In a few Days two Sloops were equipp'd and mann'd: The <HI>Henry</HI> with 8 Guns, and 70 Men, com∣manded by Captain <HI>John Masters,</HI> and the <HI>Sea Nymph,</HI> with eight Guns, and 60 Men, commanded by Captain <HI>Fayrer Hall,</HI> both under the entire Di∣rection and Command of the aforesaid Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> who, on the 14th of <HI>September,</HI> went on Board the <HI>Henry,</HI> and, with the other Sloop, sail'd from <HI>Charles-Town</HI> to <HI>Swillivant</HI>'s Island, to put them∣selves in order for the Cruize. Just then arri∣ved a small Ship from <HI>Antigoa,</HI> one <HI>Cock,</HI> Master, with an Account, that in Sight of the Bar, he was taken and Plundered, by one <HI>Charles Vane,</HI> a Pyrate, in a Brigantine of 12 Guns and 90 Men; and who had also taken two other Vessels bound in there, one a small Sloop, Captain <HI>Dill</HI> Master, from <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> the other a Brigantine, Captain <HI>Thomp∣son</HI> Master, from <HI>Guinea,</HI> with ninety odd Negroes, which they took out of the Vessel, and put on Board another Sloop then under the Command of one <HI>Yeats</HI> his Consort, with 15 Men. This prov'd
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
fortunate to the Owners of the <HI>Guiney-Man,</HI> for <HI>Years</HI> having often attempted to quiet this Course of Life, took an Opportunity in the Night, to leave <HI>Vane,</HI> and to run into <HI>North-Edisto</HI> River, to the Southward of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and surrendered to his Majesty's Pardon. The Owners got their Ne∣groes, and <HI>Yeats</HI> and his Men had Certificates given them from the Government.</P>
<P><HI>Vane</HI> cruised some Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch <HI>Yeats,</HI> and unfortunately for them, took two Ships coming out, bound to <HI>London,</HI> and while the Prisoners were aboard, some of the Pyrates gave out, that they designed to go into one of the Rivers, to the Southward. Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> upon hearing this, sail'd over the Bar the 15th of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> with the two Sloops before mentioned; and having the Wind Northerly, went after the Py∣rate <HI>Vane,</HI> and scoured the Rivers and Inlets to the Southward; but not meeting with him, tack'd, and stood for Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, in Prosecution of his first Design. On the 26th following, in the Evening, the Colonel with his small Squadron, entered the River, and saw, over a Point of Land, three Sloops at Anchor, which were Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> and his Prizes; but it happened that in going up the River, the Pilot run both the Sloops a ground, and it was dark before they were on Float, which hinder'd their getting up that Night. The Pyrates soon discovered the Sloops, but not knowing who they were, or upon what Design they came into that River, they manned three Canoes, and sent them down to take them, but they quickly found their Mistake, and return'd to the Sloop, with the unwelcome News. Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> made Preparations that Night for engaging, and took all the Men out of the Prizes. He shewed Captain <HI>Manwaring,</HI> one of his Prisoners, a Letter, he had just wrote, which he declared he would send to the Governor
<PB N="73" REF="78"/>
of <HI>Carolina;</HI> the Letter was to this effect, <HI>viz. That if the Sloops, which then appeared, were sent out against him, by the said Governor, and he should get clear off; that he would burn and destroy all Ships or Vessels, going in, or coming out, of</HI> South-Carolina. The next Morn∣ing they got under Sail, and came down the River, designing only a running Fight. Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI>'s Sloops got likewise under Sail, and stood for him, getting upon each Quarter of the Pyrate, with In∣tent to board him; which he perceiving, edg'd in towards the Shore, and being warmly engaged, their Sloop ran a-ground: The <HI>Carolina</HI> Sloops being in the same shoal Water, were in the same Circumstances; the <HI>Henry</HI> in which Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI> was, grounded within Pistol shot of the Pyrate, and on his Bow; the other Sloop grounded right a-head of him, and almost out of Gun-Shot, which made her of little Service to the Colonel, while they lay aground.</P>
<P>At this Time the Pyrate had a considerable Ad∣vantage; for their Sloop, after she was a-ground, list∣ed from Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI>'s, by which Means they were all cover'd, and the Colonel's Sloop listing the same Way, his Men were much exposed; not∣withstanding which, they kept a brisk Fire the whole Time they lay thus aground, which was near five Hours. The Pyrates made a Wiff in their bloody Flag, and beckon'd several Times with their Hats, in Derision to the Colonel's Men, to come on board, which they answered with chearful Huz∣za's, and said, <HI>that they would speak with them, by and by;</HI> which accordingly happened, for the Colonel's Sloop being first a-Float, he got into deeper Water, and after mending the Sloop's Rigging, which was much shatter'd in the Engagement, they stood for the Pyrate, to give the finishing Stroke, and designed to go directly on Board him; which he prevented, by sending a Flag of Truce,
<PB N="74" REF="79"/>
and after some Time capitulating, they surrendred themselves Prisoners. The Colonel took Possession of the Sloop, and was extreamly pleased to find that Captain <HI>Thomas,</HI> who commanded her, was the individual Person of Major <HI>Stede Bonnet,</HI> who had done them the Honour several Times to visit their own Coast of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>There were kill'd in this Action, on Board the <HI>Henry,</HI> ten Men, and fourteen wounded; on Board the <HI>Sea Nymph,</HI> two killed, and four wounded. The Officers and Sailors in both Sloops, behaved them∣selves with the greatest Bravery; and had not the Sloops so unluckily run a-ground, they had taken the Pyrate with much less loss of Men; but as he design'd to get by them, and so make a run∣ning Fight, the <HI>Carolina</HI> Sloops were obliged to to keep near him, to prevent his getting away. Of the Pyrates there were seven kill'd, and five wounded, two of which died soon after of their Wounds. Colonel <HI>Rhet</HI> weigh'd the 30th of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> from Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, and arrived at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> the 3d of <HI>October,</HI> to the great Joy of the whole Province of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bonnet,</HI> and his Crew, two Days after, were put a∣shore, and there not being a publick Prison, the Pyrates were kept at the Watch-House, under a Guard of Militia; but Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> was com∣mitted into the Custody of the Marshal, at his House; and in a few Days after, <HI>David Hariot</HI> the Master, and <HI>Ignatius Pell,</HI> the Boatswain, who were design'd for Evidences against the other Pyrates, were removed from the rest of the Crew, to the said Marshal's House, and every Night two Cen∣tine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s set about the said House; but whether thro' any Corruption, or want of Care in guarding the Prisoners, I can't say; but on the 24th of <HI>October,</HI> the Major and <HI>Harist</HI> made their escape, the Boat∣swain refusing to go along with them. This made
<PB N="75" REF="80"/>
a great Noise in the Province, and People were open in their Resentments, often reflecting on the Governor, and others in the Magistracy, as tho' they had been brib'd, for conniving at their Escape. These Invectives arose from their Fears, that <HI>Bonnet</HI> would be capable of raising another Company, and prosecute his Revenge against this Country, for what he had lately, tho justly, suf∣fered: But they were in a short Time made easy in those Respects, for as soon as the Governor had the Account of <HI>Bonnet</HI>'s Escape, he immedia∣tely issued out a Proclamation, and promised a Reward of 700 Pounds to any that would take him, and sent several Boats with armed Men, both to the Northward and Southward, in pursuit of him.</P>
<P><HI>Bonnet</HI> stood to the Northward, in a small Vessel, but wanting Necessaries, and the Weather being bad, he was forced back, and so return'd with his Ca∣noe, to <HI>Swillivants</HI> Island, near <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> to fetch Supplies; but there being some Information sent to the Governor, he sent for Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> and desired him to go in pursuit of <HI>Bonnet;</HI> and ac∣cordingly gave him a Commission for that Pur∣pose: Wherefore the Colonel, with proper Craft, and some Men went away that Night for <HI>Swil∣livant</HI>'s Island, and after a very diligent Search discovered <HI>Bonnet</HI> and <HI>Hariot</HI> together; the Colonel's Men fired upon them, and killed <HI>Hariot</HI> upon the Spot, and wounded one <HI>Negro,</HI> and an <HI>Indian. Bonnet</HI> submitted, and surren∣dred himself; and the next Morning, being <HI>No∣vember</HI> the 6th, was brought, by Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> to <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and by the Governor's Warrant was committed into safe Custody, in order for his be∣ing brought to his Tryal.</P>
<P>On the 28th of <HI>October,</HI> 1718, a Court of Vice-Admiralty was held at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> in <HI>South-Caro∣lina,</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
and by several Adjournments, continued to <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the 12th of <HI>November</HI> following, for the Tryal of the Pyrates, taken in a Sloop former∣ly called <HI>the Revenge,</HI> but afterwards, <HI>the Royal James;</HI> before <HI>Nicholas Trot</HI> Esquire, Judge of the Vice-Admiralty, and Cheif Justice of the said Province, of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and other Assistant Judges.</P>
<P>The King's Commission to Judge <HI>Trot,</HI> was read, and a Grand Jury sworn, for the finding of the several Bills, and a learned Charge given to them by the said Judge, wherein he 1st shewed, <HI>That the Sea was given by God, for the Ʋse of Men, and is Subject to Dominion and Property as well as the Land.</HI></P>
<P>2dly He particularly remark'd to them, <HI>the So∣vereignity of the King of</HI> England <HI>over the</HI> British <HI>Seas.</HI></P>
<P>3dly. He observed, <HI>that as Commerce and Navi∣gation could not be carried on without Laws; so there have been always particular Laws, for the better ordering and regulating marine Affairs;</HI> with an historical Account of those Laws, and Origine.</P>
<P>4thly. He proceedeth to shew, <HI>that there have been particular Courts and Judges appointed; to whose Juridi∣ction maritime Causes do belong, and that in Matters both Civil and Criminal.</HI></P>
<P>And then 5thly. He particularly shewed them, <HI>the Constitution and Juridiction of that Court of Admi∣ralty Sessions.</HI></P>
<P>And lastly, <HI>the Crimes cognizable therein;</HI> and par∣ticularly enlarged <HI>upon the Crime of Pyracy,</HI> which was then brought before them.</P>

<P>They were most of them try'd upon two In∣dictments, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>THE Jurors for our Sovereign Lord the King, do up∣on their Oath present, that</HI> Stede Bonnet, <HI>late of</HI> Barbadoes, <HI>Mariner,</HI> Robert Tucker, &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>The 2d Day of</HI> August, <HI>in the fifth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord</HI> George, &amp;c. <HI>By Force of Arms upon the High-Sea, in a certain Place called Cape</HI> James, &amp;c. <HI>did pyratically, and felloniously set upon, break, board, and enter, a certain Merchant Sloop, call'd the</HI> Frances, Peter Manwaring <HI>Commander, by Force,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>upon the High-Sea, in a certain Place, called Cape</HI> James, alias <HI>Cape</HI> Inlopen, <HI>about two Miles distant from the Shore, in the Lattitude of</HI> 39, <HI>or thereabouts; and within the Juridiction of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of</HI> South-Carolina, <HI>being a Sloop of certain Persons, (to the Ju∣rors, unknown) and then, and there, pyratically, and fello∣niously did make an Assault, in, and upon the said</HI> Peter Manwaring, <HI>and others his Mariners, (whose Names to the Jurors aforesaid, are unknown,) in the same Sloop, against the Peace of God, and of our said now Sovereign Lord the King, then, and there being, pyratically and fel∣loniously, did put the aforesaid</HI> Peter Manwaring, <HI>and others, his Mariners, of the same Sloop, in the Sloop aforesaid, then being, in corporal Fear of their Lives, then and there, in the Sloop aforesaid, upon the</HI> High-Sea, <HI>in the Place aforesaid, called Cape</HI> James, alias <HI>Cape</HI> In∣lopen, <HI>about two Miles from the Shore, in the Lattitude of</HI> 39, <HI>or thereabouts, as aforesaid, and within the Juris∣diction aforesaid; pyratically, and felloniously, did steal,</HI>

<HI>take, and carry away the said Merchant Sloop, called the</HI> Frances, <HI>and also twenty six Hogsheads,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. <HI>being found in the aforesaid Sloop, in the Custody and Posses∣sion of the said</HI> Peter Manwaring, <HI>and others, his Mari∣ners of the said Sloop, and from their Custody and Posses∣sion, then and there, upon the High-Sea aforesaid, called Cape</HI> James, alias <HI>Cape</HI> Inlopen, <HI>as aforesaid, and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid, against the Peace of our now Sovereign Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Form of the Indictments, they were arraigned upon, and tho' they might have prov'd several more Facts upon the major Part of the Crew, the Court thought fit to prosecute but two; the other was for seizing in a Pyratical and felo∣nious Manner, the Sloop <HI>Fortune, Thomas Read</HI> Commander; which Indictment running in the same Form with the above mentioned, it will be unnecessary to say more of it.</P>
<P>All the Prisoners arraigned, pleaded Not Guilty, and put themselves upon their Tryals, except <HI>James Wilson,</HI> and <HI>John Levit,</HI> who pleaded Guilty to both Indictments, and <HI>Daniel Perry,</HI> to one only. The Major would have gone through both the In∣dictments at once, which the Court not admitting, he pleaded Not guilty to both Indictments, but be∣ing convicted of one, he retracted his former Plea, to the second Indictment, and pleaded Guilty to it.</P>
<P>The Prisoners made little or no Defence, every one pretending only that they were taken off a Maroon Shore, and were shipped with Major <HI>Bonnet</HI> to go to St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s; but being out at Sea, and wanting Provisions, they were obliged to do what they did by others; and so did Major <HI>Bon∣net</HI> himself, pretend that 'twas Force, not Incli∣nation, that occasioned what had happen'd. How∣ever,
<PB N="80" REF="85"/>
the Facts being plainly proved, and that they had all shared ten or eleven Pounds a Man, excepting the three last, and <HI>Thomas Nichols,</HI> they were all but they, found Guilty. The Judge made a very grave Speech to them, setting forth <HI>the En∣ormity of their Crimes, the Condition they were now in, and the Nature and Necessity of an unfeigned Repentance;</HI> and then recommended them to the Ministers of the Province, for more ample Directions, to fit them for Eternity, <HI>for</HI> (concluded he) <HI>the Priest's Lips shall keep knowledge, and you shall seek the Law at their Mouths; for they are the Messengers of the Lord.</HI> Mal. II. 57. <HI>And the Ambassadors of Christ, and unto them is committed the Word</HI> [or Doctrine] <HI>of Reconci∣liation,</HI> 2 Cor. V 19, 20. And then pronounced Sen∣tence of Death upon them.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday November</HI> the 8th, 1711. <HI>Robert Tucker, Edward Robinson, Neal Paterson, William Scot, Job Bayley, John-William Smith, John Thomas, William Morrison, Samuel Booth, William Hewit, William Eddy,</HI> alias <HI>Neddy, Alexander Annand, George Ross, George Dunkin, Mathew King, Daniel Perry, Henry Virgin, James Robbins, James Mullet,</HI> alias <HI>Millet, Thomas Price, John Lopez,</HI> and <HI>Zachariah Long,</HI> were execu∣ted at the <HI>White-Point</HI> near <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> pursuant to their Sentence.</P>
<P>As for the Captain, his Escape protracted his Fate, and spun out his Life a few Days longer, for he was try'd the 10th, and being found Guilty, receiv'd Sentence in like Manner as the former; before which Judge <HI>Trot,</HI> made a most excellent Speech to him, rather somewhat too long to be taken into our History, yet I could not tell how to pass by so good and useful a Piece of Instruction, not knowing whose Hands this Book may happen to fall into.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Lord Chief Justices's</HI> SPEECH, <HI>on his pronouncing Sentence on Major</HI> STEDE BONNET.</HEAD>
<P>MAjor <HI>Stede Bonnet,</HI> you stand here convicted upon two Indictments of Pyracy; one by the Verdict of the Jury, and the other by your own Confession.</P>
<P>Altho' you were indicted but for <HI>two</HI> Facts, yet you know that at your Tryal it was fully proved, even by an unwilling Witness, that you <HI>pyratically</HI> took and rifled no less than <HI>thirteen</HI> Vessels, since you sailed from <HI>North-Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>So that you might have been indicted, and con∣victed of <HI>eleven</HI> more Acts of <HI>Pyracy,</HI> since you took the Benefit of the King's <HI>Act of Grace,</HI> and pre∣tended to leave that wicked Course of Life.</P>
<P>Not to mention the many <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Pyracy</HI> you committed before; for which if your Pardon from <HI>Man</HI> was never so authentick, yet you must expect to answer for them before God.</P>
<P>You know that the Crimes you have committed are <HI>evil</HI> in themselves, and contrary to the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> as well as the <HI>Law</HI> of God, by which you are commanded that <HI>you shall not steal,</HI> Exod. 20. 15. And the Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> expresly affirms, That <HI>Thieves shall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</HI> 1. Cor. 6. 10.</P>
<P>But to <HI>Theft</HI> you have added a greater Sin, which is <HI>Murder.</HI> How many you may have <HI>killed</HI> of those that resisted you in the committing your former <HI>Pyracies,</HI> I know not: But this we all know, That besides the Wounded, you killed no less than <HI>eighteen</HI> Persons out of those that were sent by lawful Au∣thority
<PB N="82" REF="87"/>
to suppress you, and to put a stop to those Rapines that you daily acted.</P>
<P>And however you may fancy that that was killing Men fairly in open <HI>Fight,</HI> yet this know, That the Power of the <HI>Sword</HI> not being committed into your Hands by any lawful Authority, you were not im∣powered to use any <HI>Force,</HI> or to <HI>fight</HI> any one; and therefore those Persons that fell in that Action, in doing their Duty to their King and Country, were <HI>murdered,</HI> and their <HI>Blood</HI> now cries out for <HI>Ven∣geance</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> against you: For it is the <HI>Voice of Nature,</HI> confirmed by the <HI>Law</HI> of God, That <HI>Whoso sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed,</HI> Gen. 9. 6.</P>
<P>And consider that Death is not the only Punish∣ment due to <HI>Murderers;</HI> for they are threatned to have <HI>their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimstone, which is the second Death,</HI> Rev. 21. 8. See <HI>Chap.</HI> 22. 15. Words which carry that Terror with them, that considering your Circumstances and your Guilt, surely the Sound of them must make you tremble; <HI>For who can dwell with everlast∣ing Burnings?</HI> Chap. 33. 14.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Testimony</HI> of your <HI>Conscience</HI> must convince you of the great and many Evils you have com∣mitted, by which you have highly offended God, and provoked most justly his Wrath and Indigna∣tion against you, so I suppose I need not tell you that the only Way of obtaining Pardon and Remis∣sion of your Sins from God, is by a true and un∣feigned <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, by whose meritorious Death and Passion, you can only hope for Salvation.</P>
<P>You being a Gentleman that have had the Ad∣vantage or a <HI>liberal Education,</HI> and being generally esteemed a Man of <HI>Letters,</HI> I believe it will be need∣less for me to explain to you the Nature of <HI>Repen∣tance</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>
and <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, they being so fully and so often mentioned in the Scriptures, that you can∣not but know them. And therefore, perhaps, for that Reason it might be thought by some impro∣per for me to have said so much to you, as I have already upon this Occasion; neither should I have done it, but that considering the Course of your Life and Actions, I have just Reason to fear that the Principles of Religion that had been instiled into you by your <HI>Education,</HI> have been at least corrupted, if not entirely defaced, by the <HI>Scepti∣cism</HI> and <HI>Infidelity</HI> of this wicked Age; and that what Time you allowed for Study was rather ap∣plied to the <HI>Polite Literature,</HI> and the vain <HI>Philosophy</HI> of the Times, than a serious Search of the <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Will</HI> of God, as revealed to us in the Holy <HI>Scrip∣tures:</HI> For <HI>had your Delight been in the Law of the Lord, and that you had meditated therein Day and Night,</HI> Psal. 1. 2. you would then have found that God's <HI>Word was a Lamp unto your Feet, and a Light to your Path,</HI> Psal. 119. 105. and that you would account all other Knowledge but <HI>Loss,</HI> in comparison of <HI>the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus,</HI> Phil. 3. 8. <HI>who to them that are called is the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God,</HI> 1 Cor 1. 24. <HI>even the hidden Wis∣dom which God ordained before the World,</HI> Chap. 2. 7.</P>
<P>You would then have esteemed the <HI>Scriptures</HI> as the <HI>Great Charter</HI> of Heaven, and which delivered to us not only the most perfect <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> of Life, but also discovered to us those Acts of <HI>Pardon</HI> from God, wherein we have offended those righte∣ous Laws: For in them only is to be found the great <HI>Mystery</HI> of fallen Man's <HI>Redemption, which the An∣gels desire to look into,</HI> 1 Pet. 1. 12.</P>
<P>And they would have taught you that <HI>Sin</HI> is the debasing of <HI>Human Nature,</HI> as being a <HI>Deviation</HI> from that <HI>Purity, Rectitude,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> in which God created us; and that <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> and walk∣ing
<PB N="84" REF="89"/>
by the Laws of God, were altogether prefe∣rable to the Ways of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan;</HI> for that the <HI>Ways</HI> of Virtue are <HI>Ways of Pleasantness, and all their Paths are Peace,</HI> Prov. 3. 17.</P>
<P>But what you could not learn from God's Word, by reason of your <HI>carelesly,</HI> or but <HI>superficially</HI> con∣sidering the same, I hope the Course of his <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> and the present <HI>Afflictions</HI> that he hath laid upon you, hath now convinced you of the same: For however in your seeming Prosperity you might make a <HI>Mock at your Sins,</HI> Prov. 3. 17. yet now that you see that God's Hand hath reached you, and brought you to publick Justice, I hope your present unhappy Circumstances hath made you seriously reflect upon your past Actions and Course of Life; and that you are now sensible of the Great∣ness of your Sins, and that you find the Burden of them in intolerable.</P>
<P>And that therefore being thus <HI>labouring, and heavy laden with Sin,</HI> Matt 11. 28. you will esteem that as the most valueable <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that can shew you how you can be reconciled to that Supreme God, that you have so highly offended; and that can reveal to you Him who is not only the power∣ful <HI>Advocate with the Father for you,</HI> 1 John 2. 1. but also who hath paid that Debt that is due for your Sins by his own Death upon the Cross for you; and thereby made full Satisfaction to the Ju∣stice of God. And this is to be found no where but in God's Word, which discovers to us that <HI>Lamb of God which takes away the Sins of the World,</HI> John 1. 29. which is <HI>Christ</HI> the Son of God: For this know, and be assured, that <HI>there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved,</HI> Acts, 4. 12. but only by the Name of the Lord <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="90"/>
But then consider how he invites all Sinners to come unto him, and, <HI>that he will give them rest,</HI> Matt. 11. 28. for he assures us, <HI>that he came to seek and to save that which was lost;</HI> Luke 19. 10. Matt. 18. 11. and hath promised, that <HI>he that cometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out,</HI> John 6. 37.</P>
<P>So that if now you will sincerely turn to him, tho' late, even at the <HI>eleventh Hour,</HI> Matt. 20. 6, 9. he will receive you.</P>
<P>But surely I need not tell you that the <HI>Terms</HI> of his <HI>Mercy</HI> is <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>And do not mistake the <HI>Nature</HI> of Repentance to be only a bare Sorrow for your Sins, arising from the Consideration of the <HI>Evil</HI> and <HI>Punishment</HI> they have now brought upon you; but your Sorrow must arise from the Consideration of your having offended a gracious and merciful God.</P>
<P>But I shall not pretend to give you any particu∣lar Directions as to the Nature of Repentance: I consider that I speak to a Person, whose Offences have proceeded not so much from his not <HI>knowing,</HI> as his <HI>slighting</HI> and <HI>neglecting</HI> his <HI>Duty:</HI> Neither is it proper for me to give Advice out of the way of my own Profession.</P>
<P>You may have that better delivered to you by those who have made Divinity their particular Study; and who by their Knowledge, as well as their Office, as being the <HI>Ambassadors of Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. 20. are best qualified to give you Instru∣ctions therein.</P>
<P>I only heartily wish that what, in compassion to your Soul, I have now said to you upon this sad and solemn Occasion, by exhorting you in ge∣neral to <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> may have that due Effect upon you, that thereby you may become a true <HI>Penitent.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore having now discharged my Duty to you as a <HI>Christian,</HI> by giving you the best Coun∣sel
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>
I can with respect to the Salvation of your Soul I must now do my Office as a <HI>Judge.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sentence</HI> that the Law hath appointed to pass upon you for your Offences, and which this Court doth therefore award, is,</P>
<P><HI>That you, the said</HI> Stede Bonnet, <HI>shall go from hence to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, where you shall be hanged by the Neck till you are Dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And the God of infinite Mercy be merciful to your Soul.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. OF Captain <HI>THATCH,</HI> alias BLACK BEARD.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EEward Thatch,</HI> (commonly called <HI>Black-beard,)</HI> was born in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and was from a Boy bred up to the Sea; in the late War he sail'd for the most Part in Privateers, yet, tho' he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon Boldness, and personal Courage, he was never raised to any Command. The first of his going upon the pyrating Account, was with Major <HI>Bon∣net,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> worth 500 l. a Year, real Estate, who being, as 'tis supposed, a little distracted, fitted out a Sloop from that Island, to become a Pyrate, as has been taken Notice of in his Life. With him <HI>Thatch</HI> ship'd himself as a Fore∣mast Man; The Pyrates soon found Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI>
<PB REF="92" MS="y"/>
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
to be a Person unfit for this Condition of Life; and tho' the Sloop was his own, yet they deposed him from the Command, and by common Consent, placed this <HI>Thatch</HI> in his Room.</P>
<P>We have already given an Account of the Pyra∣cies of <HI>Thatch,</HI> to the Time of his parting with Major <HI>Bonnet,</HI> which was, when he lost his Ship in <HI>Topsail</HI> Inlet, in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where some of his Men were drowned, and others dispersed about the Country; after which, he, and twenty or thirty more of the Crew, went up to <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> and surrendred to his Majesty's Mercy, as offered by Proclamation, and they all received Certificates from his Excellency <HI>Charles Eden</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Governor of that Province. It did not appear that their submitting to this Proclamation, was from any Re∣formation of Manners, but only to wait a more favourable Opportunity to play the same Game over again; which he soon after effected, with greater Security to himself, and with much bet∣ter Prospect of Success, having in this Time culti∣vated a very good Understanding with the Gover∣nor above mentioned.</P>
<P>The first Piece of Service this kind Governor did to <HI>Black-beard,</HI> was, to give him a Right to the Vessel which he had taken, when he was a pyrating in the great Ship, call'd the <HI>Queen Ann's Revenge,</HI> for which purpose, a Court of Vice-Admi∣ralty was held at <HI>Bath-Town;</HI> and, tho' <HI>Thatch</HI> had never any Commission in his Life, and the Sloop belonging to the <HI>English</HI> Merchants, and taken in Time of Peace; yet was she condemned as a Prize taken from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by the said <HI>Thatch.</HI> These Proceedings shew that Governors are but Men.</P>
<P>Before he sail'd upon his Adventures, he mar∣ry'd a young Creature, of about sixteen Years of Age, the Governor performing the Ceremony. As it is a Custom to marry here by a Priest, so it is
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
there by a Magistrate; and this, as I have been in∣form'd, made <HI>Thatch</HI>'s fourteenth Wife, whereof, about a dozen might be still living. His Beha∣viour in this State, was something extraordinary; for, while his Sloop lay in <HI>Okerecock</HI> Inlet, and he ashore at a Plantation, where his Wife lived, with whom, after he had lain all Night, it was his Custom to invite five or six of his brutal Com∣panions to come ashore, and he would force her to prostitute her self to them all, one after ano∣ther, before his Face.</P>
<P>In <HI>June,</HI> 1718, he went to Sea, upon his second Expedition, and steered his Course towards <HI>Bermu∣das;</HI> he met with two or three <HI>English</HI> Vessels in his Way, but robbed them only of Provisions, Stores, and other Necessaries, for his Present Ex∣pence; but, near the Island aforementioned, he fell in with two <HI>French</HI> Ships, one of them was loaden with Sugar, and Cocoa, and the other light, both bound to <HI>Martinico;</HI> the Ship that had no Lading, he let go, and putting all the Men of the loaded Ship aboard her, <HI>Thatch</HI> brought home the other with her Cargoe, to <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where the Governor and the Pyrates, shar'd the Plunder.</P>
<P>When <HI>Thatch</HI> and his Prize arrived, he and four of his Crew, went to his Excellency, and made Af∣fidavit, that they found the <HI>French</HI> Ship at Sea, without a Soul on Board her; and then a Court was call'd, and the Ship condemned: The Governor had sixty Hogsheads of Sugar for his Dividend, and one Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> who was his Secretary, and Collector of the Province, twenty, and the rest was shared among the other Pyrates.</P>
<P>The Business was not yet done, the Ship re∣main'd, and it was possible, one or other might come into the River, that might be acquainted with her, and so discover the Roguery; but <HI>Thatch,</HI> thought of a Contrivance to prevent this,
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
for, upon a Pretence that she was leaky, and that she might sink, and so stop up the Mouth of the Inlet, or Cove, where she lay, he obtained an Order from the Governor, to bring her out into the River, and set her on Fire, which was ac∣cordingly executed, and she was burnt down to the Water's Edge, and her Bottom sunk, and with it, their Fears of her ever rising in Judgment against them.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Thatch,</HI> alias <HI>Black-beard,</HI> pass'd three or four Months in the River, sometimes lying at An∣chor in the Coves, at other Times, sailing from one Inlet to another, trading with such Sloops as he met, for all Things he wanted, whether Provisions, or Stores, and giving them something else in Ex∣change,—that is, when he happened to be in a giving Humour; at other Times he made bold with them, and took what he liked, without say∣ing, <HI>by your Leave,</HI> knowing well, they dare not send him in a Bill for the Payment. He often di∣verted himself with going ashore among the Plan∣ters, where he revell'd Night and Day: By these he was well received, but whether out of Love or Fear, I cannot say; sometimes he used them cour∣teously enough, and made them Presents of Rum, and Sugar, in Recompence of what he took from them; but, as for Liberties, (which 'tis said,) he and his Companions often took with the Wives and Daughters of the Planters, I can not take upon me to say, whether he paid them <HI>ad Valorem,</HI> or no. At other Times he carried it in a lordly Manner towards them, and would lay some of them under Contribution; nay, he often proceeded to bully the Governor, not, that I can discover the least Cause of Quarrel betwixt them, but it seem'd only to be done, to shew he dare do it.</P>
<P>The Sloops trading up and down this River, being so frequently pillaged by <HI>Black-beard,</HI> con∣sulted
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
with the Traders, and some of the best of the Planters, what Course to take; they saw plainly it would be in vain to make any Application to the Governor of <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> to whom it pro∣perly belonged, to find some Redress; so that if they could not be relieved from some other Quar∣ter, <HI>Black-beard</HI> would be like to Reign with Impu∣nity; therefore, with as much Secrecy as possible, they sent a Deputation to <HI>Virginia,</HI> to lay the Affair before the Governor of that Colony, and to solicit an armed Force, from the Men of War lying there, to take this Pyrate.</P>
<P>This Governor consulted with the Captains of the two Men of War, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Pearl,</HI> and <HI>Lime,</HI> who had lain in St. <HI>James</HI>'s River, about ten Months. It was agreed, that the Governor should hire a couple of small Sloops, and the Men of War should Man them; this was accordingly done, and the Command of them given to Mr. <HI>Robert Maynard,</HI> first Lieutenant of the <HI>Pearl,</HI> an expe∣rienced Officer, and a Gentleman of great Bravery and Resolution, as will appear by his gallant Be∣haviour in this Expedition. The Sloops were well mann'd, and furnish'd with Ammunition and small Arms, but had no Guns mounted.</P>
<P>About the Time of their going out, the Gover∣nor call'd an Assembly in which it was resolved to publish a Proclamation, offering certain Rewards to any Person, or Persons, who within a Year after that Time, should take or destroy any Pyrate: The original Proclamation being in our Hands, is as follows.</P>
<DIV3>
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>

<P><HI>WHereas, by an Act of Assembly, made at a Session of Assembly, begun at the Capital in</HI> Wil∣liamsburgh, <HI>the eleventh Day of</HI> November, <HI>in the fifth Year of his Majesty's Reign, entitled an Act to En∣courage the apprehending and destroying of Pyrates: It is, amongst other Things enacted, that all and every Person, or Persons, who from, and after the fourteenth Day of</HI> November, <HI>in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighteen, and before the fourteenth Day of</HI> November, <HI>which shall be in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and nineteen, shall take any Pyrate, or Pyrates, on the Sea or Land, or in Case of Resistance, shall kill any such Pyrate, or Pyrates, between the Degrees of thirty four, and thirty nine, of Northern Latitude, and within one hundred Leagues of the Continent of</HI> Virgi∣nia, <HI>or within the Provinces of</HI> Virginia, <HI>or</HI> North-Carolina, <HI>upon the Conviction, or making due Proof of the killing of all and every such Pyrate, and Pyrates, before the Governor and Council, shall be intitled to have, and receive out of the publick Money, in the Hands of the Treasurer of this Colony, the several Rewards follow∣ing; that is to say, for</HI> Edward Thatch, <HI>commonly call'd, Captain</HI> Thatch, <HI>or</HI> Black-beard, <HI>one hundred Pounds, for every other Commander of a Pyrate Ship, Sloop, or Vessel, forty Pounds; for every Lieutenant, Ma∣ster, or Quarter-Master, Boatswain, or Carpenter, twen∣ty Pounds; for every other inferiour Officer, fifteen Pounds, and for every private Man taken on Board such Ship,</HI>

<P>The 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of <HI>November,</HI> 1718, the Lieutenant sail'd from <HI>Kicquetan,</HI> in <HI>James</HI> River in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the 21st in the Evening, came to the Mouth of <HI>Okerecock</HI> Inlet, where he got sight of the Pyrate. This Expedition was made with all imaginable Secrecy, and the Officer manag'd with all the Pru∣dence that was necessary, stoping all Boats and Vessels he met with, in the River, from going up, and thereby preventing any Intelligence from reach∣ing <HI>Black-beard,</HI> and receiving at the same an Ac∣count from them all, of the Place where the Pyrate was lurking; but notwithstanding this Caution,
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
<HI>Black-beard</HI> had Information of the Design, from his Excellency of the Province; and his Secretary, Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> wrote him a Letter, particularly con∣cerning it, intimating, <HI>that he had sent him four of his Men, which were all he could meet with, in or about Town, and so bid him be upon his Guard.</HI> These Men belonged to <HI>Black-beard,</HI> and were sent from <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> to <HI>Okerecock,</HI> where the Sloop lay, which is about 20 Leagues.</P>
<P><HI>Black-beard</HI> had heard several Reports, which happened not to be true, and so gave the less Cre∣dit to this, nor was he convinced till he saw the Sloops: Thereupon he put his Vessel in a Posture of Defence; he had no more than Twenty five Men on Board, tho' he gave out to all the Vessels he spoke with, that he had 40. When he had pre∣pared for Battle, he set down and spent the Night in drinking with the Master of a trading Sloop, who, 'twas thought, had more Business with <HI>Thatch,</HI> than he should have had.</P>
<P>Lieutenant <HI>Maynard</HI> came to an Anchor, for the Place being shoal, and the Channel intricate, so that there was no getting in, where <HI>Thatch</HI> lay, that Night; but in the Morning he weigh'd, and sent his Boat a Head of the Sloops, to sound, and coming within Gun-Shot of the Pyrate, re∣ceived his Fire; whereupon <HI>Maynard</HI> hoisted the King's Colours, and stood directly towards him, with the best Way that his Sails and Oars could make. <HI>Black-beard</HI> cut his Cable, and endeavoured to make a running Fight, keeping a continual Fire at his Enemies, with his Guns, Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> not ha∣ving any, kept a constant Fire with small Arms, while some of his Men laboured at their Oars; <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop ran aground, and Mr. <HI>Mayn∣ard</HI>'s drawing more Water than that of the Pyrate, he could not come near him, so he anchored within half Gun-Shot of the Enemy; and, in order to
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
lighten his Vessel, that he might run him aboard; the Lieutenant ordered all his Ballast to be thrown over-Board, and all the Water to be staved, and then weigh'd and stood for him; upon which <HI>Black-beard,</HI> hail'd him in this rude Manner: <HI>Damn you for Villains, who are you? And, from whence came you?</HI> The Lieutenant made him Answer, <HI>You may see by our Colours, we are no Pyrates. Black-beard</HI> bid him send his Boat on Board, that he might see who he was; but Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> reply'd thus; <HI>I cannot spare my Boat, but I will come aboard of you, as soon as I can, with my Sloop.</HI> Upon this, <HI>Black-beard</HI> took a Glass of Liquor, and drank to him with these Words: <HI>Damnation seize my Soul if I give you Quarters, or take any from you.</HI> In Answer to which, Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> told him, that <HI>he expected no Quarters from him, nor should he give him any.</HI></P>
<P>By this Time <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop fleeted, as Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI>'s Sloops were rowing towards him, which being not above a Foot high in the Wast, and con∣sequently the Men all exposed, as they came near together, (there being hitherto, little or no Exe∣cution done, on either Side,) the Pyrate fired a Broadside, charged with all manner of small Shot,—A fatal Stroke to them! The Sloop the Lieutenant was in, having twenty Men kill'd and wounded, and the other Sloop nine: This could not be help'd, for their being no Wind, they were oblig'd to keep to their Oars, otherwise, the Pyrate would have got away from him, which, it seems, the Lieutenant was resolute to pre∣vent.</P>
<P>After this unlucky Blow, <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop fell Broadside to the Shore; Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI>'s other Sloop, which was call'd the <HI>Ranger,</HI> fell a-stern, being for the present disabled, so the Lieutenant finding his own Sloop had Way, and would soon be on Board of <HI>Thatch,</HI> he ordered all his Men
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
down, for fear of another Broadside, which must have been their Destruction, and the loss of their Expedition. Mr. <HI>Maynard</HI> was the only Person that kept the Deck, except the Man at the Helm, whom he directed to lye down snug, and the Men in the Hold were ordered to get their Pistols and their Swords ready for close fighting, and to come up at his Command; in order to which, two Ladders were placed in the Hatch-Way for the more Expedition. When the Lieutenant's Sloop boarded the other, Captain <HI>Thatch's</HI> Men threw in several new fashion'd sort of Grenadoes, <HI>viz.</HI> Case-Bottles filled with Powder, and small Shot, Slugs, and Pieces of Lead or Iron, with a quick Match in the Mouth of it, which being lighted without side, presently runs into the Bot∣tle to the Powder, and as it is instantly thrown on Board, generally does great Execution, besides putting all the Crew into a Confusion; but by good Providence, they had not that Effect here; the Men being in the Hold, and <HI>Black-beard</HI> seeing few or no Hands aboard, told his Men, that <HI>they were all knock'd on the Head, except three or four, and therefore,</HI> says he, <HI>let's jump on Board and cut them to Pieces.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, under the Smoak of one of the Bottles just mentioned, <HI>Black-beard</HI> enters with fourteen Men, over the Bows of <HI>Maynard</HI>'s Sloop, and were not seen by him, till the Air clear'd; however, he just then gave a Signal to his Men, who all rose in an Instant, and attack'd the Pyrates with as much Bravery as ever was done upon such an Occasion: <HI>Black-beard</HI> and the Lieutenant fired the first Pistol at each other, by which the Pyrate received a Wound, and then engaged with Swords, till the Lieutenant's unluckily broke, and steping back to cock a Pistol, <HI>Black-beard,</HI> with his Cut∣lash, was striking at that Instant, that one of <HI>May∣nard</HI>'s
<PB N="96" REF="102"/>
Men gave him a terrible Wound in the Neck and Throat, by which the Lieutenant came off with a small Cut over his Fingers.</P>
<P>They were now closely and warmly engaged, the Lieutenant and twelve Men, against <HI>Black-beard</HI> and fourteen, till the Blood run out of the Scuppers in Streams; <HI>Black-beard</HI> received a Shot into his Body, from the Pistol that Lieutenant <HI>Maynard</HI> cock'd, yet still stood his Ground and fought with great Fury, till he received sixteen Wounds, and five of them by Shot. At length, as he was cocking another Pistol, having fir'd se∣veral before, he fell down dead; by which Time, eight more out of the fourteen dropt, and all the rest much wounded, jump'd over-board, and call'd out for Quarters; which was granted, tho' it was only prolonging their Lives for a few Days. The Sloop <HI>Ranger</HI> came up, and attack'd the Men that remain'd in <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop with equal Bra∣very, till they likewise cry'd for Quarters.</P>
<P>Here was an End of that couragious Brute, who might have pass'd in the World for a Heroe, had he been employ'd in a good Cause; his Destruction which was of such Consequence to the Plantations, was entirely owing to the Conduct and Bravery of Lieutenant <HI>Maynard,</HI> and his Men, who might have destroyed him with much less loss, had they had a Vessel with great Guns; but they were obliged to use small Vessels, because the Holes and Places he lurk'd in, would not admit of others, of greater Draught; for it was no small Difficulty for this Gentleman to get to him, having ground∣ed his Vessel at least a hundred Times in getting up the River, besides other Discouragements, enough to have turn'd back any Gentleman with∣out Dishonour, who was less resolute and bold than this Lieutenant. The Broadside that did so much Mischief before they boarded, in all probability, sa∣ved
<PB N="97" REF="103"/>
the rest from Destruction; for before that, <HI>Thatch</HI> had little or no Hopes of escaping, and therefore had posted a resolute Fellow a Negroe, whom he had bred up, with a lighted Match, in the Powder-Room, with Commands to blow up, when he should give him Orders, which was as soon as the Lieutenant and his Men should have en∣tered, that so he might have destroy'd his Conque∣rors: And when the Negro found how it went with <HI>Black-beard,</HI> he could hardly be perswaded from that rash Action, by two Prisoners that were then in the Hold of the Sloop.</P>
<P>What seems a little odd, is, that some of these Men, who behaved so bravely against <HI>Black-beard,</HI> went afterwards a pyrating themselves, and one of them was taken along with <HI>Roberts;</HI> but I do not find that any of them were provided for, except one that was hang'd; but this is a Di∣gression.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant caused <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Head, to be severed from his Body, and hung up at the Bolt∣sprit End, and sail'd to <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> to get Relief for his wounded Men.</P>
<P>It must be observed, that in rummaging the Py∣rate's Sloop, they found several Letters and writ∣ten Papers, which discovered the Correspondence betwixt Governor <HI>Eden,</HI> the Secretary and Col∣lector, and also some Traders at <HI>New-York,</HI> and <HI>Black-beard.</HI> It is likely he had Regard enough for his Friends, to have destroy'd these Papers before the Action, in order to hinder them from falling into such Hands, where the Discovery would be of no Use, either to the Interest or Reputation of these fine Gentlemen, if it had not been his fix'd Resolution, to have blown up altogether, when he found no possibility of escaping.</P>
<P>When the Lieutenant came to <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> he made bold to seize in the Governor's Store-House, the
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
sixty Hogsheads of Sugar, and from honest Mr. <HI>Knight,</HI> twenty; which it seems was their Dividend of the Plunder taken in the <HI>French</HI> Ship; the latter did not long survive this shameful Discovery, for being apprehensive that he should be call'd to an Account for these Trifles, fell sick with the Fright, and dy'd in a few Days.</P>
<P>After the wounded Men were pretty well reco∣vered, the Lieutenant sail'd back to the Men of War, in <HI>James</HI> River, in <HI>Virginia,</HI> with <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Head still hanging at the Bolt-sprit End, and five∣teen Prisoners, thirteen of whom were hang'd. It appearing upon Tryal, that one of them, <HI>viz. Samuel Odell,</HI> was taken out of the trading Sloop, but the Night before the Engagement. This poor Fellow was a little unlucky at his first entering up∣on his new Trade, there appearing no less than 70 Wounds upon him after the Action, notwithstand∣ing which, he liv'd, and was cur'd of them all. The other Person that escap'd the Gallows, was one <HI>Israel Hands,</HI> the Master of <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Sloop, and formerly Captain of the same, before the <HI>Queen Ann's Revenge</HI> was lost in <HI>Topsail</HI> Inlet.</P>
<P>The aforesaid <HI>Hands</HI> happened not to be in the Fight, but was taken afterwards ashore at <HI>Bath-Town,</HI> having been sometime before disabled by <HI>Black-beard,</HI> in one of his savage Humours, after the following Manner.—One Night drinking in his Cabin with <HI>Hands,</HI> the Pilot, and another Man; <HI>Black-beard</HI> without any Provocation privately draws out a small Pair of Pistols, and cocks them under the Table, which being perceiv'd by the Man, he withdrew, and went upon Deck, leaving <HI>Hands,</HI> the Pilot, and the Captain together. When the Pistols were ready, he blew out the Candle, and crossing his Hands, discharged them at his Com∣pany; <HI>Hands,</HI> the Master, was shot thro' the Knee, and lam'd for Life; the other Pistol did no Execu∣tion.—Being
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
ask'd the meaning of this, he only answered, by damning them, that <HI>if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hands</HI> being taken, was try'd and condemned, but just as he was about to be executed, a Ship arrives at <HI>Virginia</HI> with a Proclamation for prolonging the Time of his Majesty's Pardon, to such of the Pyrates as should surrender by a limi∣ted Time therein expressed: Notwithstanding the Sentence, <HI>Hands</HI> pleaded the Pardon, and was al∣lowed the Benefit of it, and is alive at this Time in <HI>London,</HI> begging his Bread.</P>
<P>Now that we have given some Account of <HI>Thatch</HI>'s Life and Actions, it will not be amiss, that we speak of his Beard, since it did not a little contri∣bute towards making his Name so terrible in those Parts.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch,</HI> and other grave Historians, have taken Notice, that several great Men amongst the <HI>Ro∣mans,</HI> took their Sir-Names from certain odd Marks in their Countenances; as <HI>Cicero,</HI> from a Mark or Vetch on his Nose; so our Heroe, Captain <HI>Thatch,</HI> assumed the Cognomen of <HI>Black-beard,</HI> from that large Quantity of Hair, which like a frightful Me∣teor, covered his whole Face, and frightn'd <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> more than any Comet that has appear'd there a long Time.</P>
<P>This Beard was black, which he suffered to grow of an extravagant Length; as to Breadth, it came up to his Eyes; he was accustomed to twist it with Ribbons, in small Tails, after the Manner of our Ramellies Wigs, and turn them about his Ears: In Time of Action, he wore a Sling over his Shoulders, with three brace of Pistols, hanging in Holsters like Bandaliers; he wore a Fur-Cap, and stuck a lighted Match on each Side, under it, which ap∣pearing
<PB N="100" REF="106"/>
on each side his Face, his Eyes naturally looking Fierce and Wild, made him altogether such a Figure, that Imagination cannot form an Idea of a Fury, from Hell, to look more frightful.</P>
<P>If he had the look of a Fury, his Humours and Passions, were suitable to it; we shall relate two or three more of his Extravagancies, which we omitted in the Body of his History, by which it will appear, to what a pitch of Wickedness, hu∣man Nature may arrive, if it's Passions are not check'd.</P>
<P>In the Commonwealth of Pyrates, he who goes the greatest length of Wickedness, is looked upon with a kind of Envy amongst them, as a Person of a more extraordinary Gallantry, and is thereby entitled to be distinguished by some Post, and if such a one has but Courage, he must certainly be a great Man. The Hero of whom we are writing was thoroughly accomplished this Way, and some of his Frolicks of Wickedness, were so extrava∣gant, as if he aim'd at making his Men believe he was a Devil incarnate; for being one Day at Sea, and a little flushed with drink:<HI>—Come,</HI> says he, <HI>let us make a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it;</HI> accordingly he, with two or three others, went down into the Hold, and closing up all the Hatches, fill'd several Pots full of Brimstone, and other combustible Matter, and set it on Fire, and so continued till they were almost suffocated, when some of the Men cried out for Air; at length he open'd the Hatches, not a little pleased that he held out the longest.</P>
<P>The Night before he was kill'd, he set up and drank the whole Night, with some of his own Men, and the Master of a Merchant-Man, and ha∣ving had Intelligence of the two Sloops coming to
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
attack him, as has been before observed; one of his Men ask'd him, in Case any thing should hap∣pen to him in the Engagement, with the Sloops, whether his Wife knew where he had buried his Money? He answered, <HI>That no Body but himself, and the Devil, knew where it was, and the longest Liver should take all.</HI></P>
<P>Those of his Crew who were taken alive, told a Story which may appear a little incredible; however, we think it will not be fair to omit it, since we had it from their own Mouths. That once upon a Cruise, they found out, that they had a Man on Board more than their Crew; such a one was seen several Days amongst them, sometimes below, and sometimes upon Deck, yet no Man in the Ship could give an Account who he was, or from whence he came; but that he disappeard a little before they were cast away in their great Ship, as has been related in the History of <HI>Bonnet;</HI> but, it seems, they all verily believed it was the Devil.</P>
<P>One would think, these Things should induce them to reform their Lives, but so many Repro∣bates together, encouraged and spirited one ano∣ther up in their Wickedness, to which a conti∣nual Course of drinking did not a little contribute; for in <HI>Black-beard</HI>'s Journal, which was taken, there were several Memorandums of the follow∣ing Nature, found writ with his own Hand.<HI>—Such a Day, Rum all out:—Our Company somewhat sober:—A damn'd Confusion amongst us!—Rogues a plotting;—great Talk of Separation.—So I lock'd sharp for a Prize;—such a Day, took one, with a great deal of Liquor on Board, so kept the Company hot, damn'd hot, then all Things went well again.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was these Wretches pass'd their Lives, with very little Pleasure or Satisfaction, in the Possession of what they violently take away from
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
others, and sure to pay for it at last, by an ignomi∣nious Death.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. OF Captain <HI>Charles Vane,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHarles Vane</HI> was one of those, who stole away the Silver which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had fished up from the Wrecks of the Galleons, in the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and was at <HI>Providence</HI> (as has been before hinted) when Governor <HI>Rogers</HI> arrived there, with two Men of War.</P>
<P>All the Pyrates who were found at this Colony of Rogues, submitted, and received Certificates of their Pardon, except Captain <HI>Vane</HI> and his Crew; who, as soon as they saw the Men of War enter, slipped their Cable, set Fire to a Prize they had in the Harbour, and sailed out with their Pyratical Colours flying, firing at one of the Men of War, as they went off.</P>
<P>Two Days after they were out, they met with a Sloop belonging to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which they made Prize of, and kept the Vessel for their own Use, putting aboard five and twenty Hands, with one <HI>Yeats</HI> to Command them. A Day or two after∣wards they fell in with a small interloping Trader, with a Quantity of <HI>Spanish</HI> Pieces of Eight aboard, bound into <HI>Providence,</HI> call'd the <HI>John and Elizabeth,</HI>
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
which they also took along with them. With these two Sloops, <HI>Vane</HI> went to a small Island and cleaned, where they shared their Booty, and spent some Time in a riotous manner of Living, as is the Custom of the Pyrates.</P>
<P>The latter End of <HI>May</HI> 1718, they sail'd; and being in want of Provisions, they beat up for the Windward Islands, and met with a <HI>Spanish</HI> Sloop bound from <HI>Porto Rico</HI> to the <HI>Havana,</HI> which they burnt, and stowed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in a Boat, and left them to get to the Island, by the light of their Ves∣sel. But steering between St. <HI>Christophers</HI> and <HI>An∣guilla,</HI> they fell in with a Brigantine and a Sloop, with the Cargo they wanted; from whom they got Provisions for Sea-Store.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, standing to the Northward, in the Track the <HI>Old-England</HI> Ships take in their Voyage to the <HI>American</HI> Colonies, they took se∣veral Ships and Vessels, which they plundered of what they thought fit, and let them pass.</P>
<P>The latter End of <HI>August, Vane,</HI> with his Consort <HI>Yeats,</HI> came off <HI>South Carolina,</HI> and took a Ship be∣longing to <HI>Ipswich,</HI> one <HI>Coggershall</HI> Commander, laden with Logwood, which was thought convenient enough for their own Business, and therefore order∣ed their Prisoners to work, and throw all the La∣ding over-beard; but when they had more than half cleared the Ship, the Whim changed, and then they would not have her; so <HI>Coggershall</HI> had his Ship again, and he was suffered to pursue his Voyage home. In this Cruize, the Rover took several other Ships and Vessels, particularly a Sloop from <HI>Barbadoes, Dill</HI> Master; a small Ship from <HI>Antegoa, Cock</HI> Master; a Sloop belonging to <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>racca, Richards</HI> Master; and a large Brigantine, Captain <HI>Thompson,</HI> from <HI>Guiney,</HI> with ninety odd Negroes aboard. The Pyrates plundered them all and let them go, putting the Negroes out of the
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
Brigantine aboard of <HI>Yeats</HI>'s Vessel, by which Means they came back again to the right Owners.</P>
<P>For Captain <HI>Vane,</HI> having always treated his Consort with very little Respect, assuming a Supe∣riority over <HI>Yeats</HI> and his small Crew, and regard∣ing the Vessel but as a Tender to his own; gave them a Disgust, who thought themselves as good Pyrates and as great Rogues as the best of them; so they caball'd together, and resolved to take the first Opportunity to leave the Company; and accept of his Majesty's Pardon, or set up for themselves, either of which they thought more honourable than to be Servants to the former; but the putting aboard so many <HI>Negroes,</HI> where there were so few Hands to take Care of them, very much enraged them, though they thought fit to conceal or stifle their Resentments at that Time.</P>
<P>A Day or two afterwards, the Pyrates lying off at Anchor, <HI>Yeats</HI> in the Evening slip'd his Cable, and put his Vessel under Sail, standing into the Shore; which when <HI>Vane</HI> saw, he was highly pro∣voked, and got his Sloop under Sail to chase his Consort, who he plainly perceived, had a Mind to have no further Affairs with him: <HI>Vane</HI>'s Brigan∣tine sailed best, he gained ground of <HI>Yeats,</HI> and would certainly have come up with him, had he had a little longer Run for it; but he just got over the Bar, when <HI>Vane</HI> come within Gun-Shot of him, who fired a Broadside at his old Friend, (which did no Damage,) and so took Leave of him.</P>
<P><HI>Yeats</HI> came into <HI>North Edisto</HI> River, about ten Leagues Southward of <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> and sent an Express to the Governor, to know if he and his Comrades might have the Benefit of his Majesty's Pardon, and they would Surrender themselves to his Mercy, with the Sloop and Negroes; which being granted, they all came up and received Cer∣tificates; and Captain <HI>Thompson,</HI> from whom the
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
Negroes were taken, had them restored to him, for the Use of his Owners.</P>
<P><HI>Vane</HI> cruised some Time off the Bar, in Hopes to catch <HI>Yeats,</HI> at his coming out again, but there∣in he was disappointed; however, he unfortunately for them, took two Ships from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> bound home to <HI>England;</HI> one of them was call'd the <HI>Em∣peror,</HI> of 360 Tuns, which was forced to return back for such Necessaries as <HI>Vane</HI> had plunder'd her of. It happened that just at this Time, two Sloops, well mann'd and arm'd, were equipp'd to go after a Pyrate, which the Governor of <HI>South-Carolina</HI> was informed, lay then in Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, a clean∣ing: But Colonel <HI>Rhet,</HI> who commanded the Sloops, meeting with the <HI>Emperor,</HI> going over the Bar, and She giving the Colonel an Account of her being taken by the Pyrate <HI>Vane,</HI> and also, that some of her Men, while they were Prisoners on Board of him, had heard the Pyrates say, they should clean in one of the Rivers to the South∣ward, he altered his first Design, and instead of standing to the Northward, in pursuit of the Pyrate in Cape <HI>Fear</HI> River, he turns to the Southward after <HI>Vane;</HI> who had ordered such Reports to be given out, on purpose to send any Force that should come after him, upon a wrong Scent; for in rea∣lity, he stood away to the Northward; so that the Pursuit proved to be the contrary Way.</P>
<P>Colonel <HI>Rhet's</HI> speaking with this Ship, was the most unlucky Thing that could have happened, be∣cause it turned him out of the Road, which, in all Probability, would have brought him into the Com∣pany of <HI>Vane,</HI> as well as of the Pyrate he went after; and so they might have been both destroy'd; whereas by the Colonel's going a different Way, he not only lost the Opportunity of meeting with one, but if the other had not been infatuated, to lye six Weeks together at Cape <HI>Fear,</HI> he would
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
have missed of him likewise: However, the Colo∣nel having searched the Rivers and Inlets, as directed, for several Days, without Success, at length sailed in Prosecution of his first Design, and met with the Pyrate accordingly, whom he fought and took, as has been before spoken of, in the Hi∣story of Major <HI>Bonnet.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Vane</HI> went into an Inlet to the North∣ward, where he met with Captain <HI>Thatch,</HI> or <HI>Teatch,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Black-beard,</HI> whom he saluted (when he found who he was) with his great Guns, loaded with Shot, (as is the Custom among Pyrates when they meet,) which are fired wide, or up into the Air: <HI>Black-beard</HI> answered the Salute in the same Manner, and mutual Civilities passed for some Days; when about the Begining of <HI>October, Vane</HI> took leave, and sailed further to the Northward.</P>
<P>On the 23d of <HI>October,</HI> off of <HI>Long Island, Vane</HI> took a small Brigantine, bound from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-England, John Shattock</HI> Master, and a little Sloop; they rifled the Brigantine and sent her away. From hence they resolved on a Cruize be∣tween Cape <HI>Meise</HI> and Cape <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where they spent some Time, without seeing or speaking with any Vessel, till the latter End of <HI>November,</HI> they fell upon a Ship, which 'twas expected would have struck as soon as their black Colours were hoisted; but instead of that, she delivered a Broadside upon the Pyrate, and hoisted Colours, which shewed her to be a <HI>French</HI> Man of War. <HI>Vane</HI> desired to have nothing further to say to her, but trim'd his Sails, and stood away from the <HI>French-Man;</HI> but <HI>Monsieur</HI> having a Mind to be better informed, who he was, set all his Sails, and crowded after him. During this Chace, the Pyrates were divided in their Resolutions what to do: <HI>Vane,</HI> the Captain, was for making off as fast as they could, alledging
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
the Man of War was too strong to cope with; but one <HI>John Rackam,</HI> who was an Officer, that had a kind of a Check upon the Captain, rose up in De∣fence of a contrary Opinion, saying, <HI>That tho' she had more Guns and a greater Weight of Mettal, they might board her, and then the best Boys would carry the Day. Rackam</HI> was well seconded, and the Majority was for boarding; but <HI>Vane</HI> urged, <HI>that it was too rash and desperate an Enterprize, the Man of War ap∣pearing to be twice their Force; and that their Brigan∣tine might be sunk by her, before they could reach aboard.</HI> The Mate, one <HI>Robert Deal</HI> was of <HI>Vane's</HI> Opinion, as were about fifteen more, and all the rest joined with <HI>Rackam</HI> the Quarter-Master. At length the Captain made Use of his Power, to determine this Dispute, which in these Cases, is absolute and un∣controulable, by their own Laws, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>fighting, chacing, or being chased;</HI> in all other Matters what∣soever, he is governed by the Majority; so the Brigantine having the Heels, as they term it, of the <HI>French</HI> Man, she came clear off.</P>
<P>But the next Day, the Captain's Behaviour was obliged to stand the Test of a Vote, and a Reso∣lution was passed against his Honour and Dignity, branding him with the Name of Coward, depo∣sing him from the Command, and turning him out of the Company, with Marks of Infamy; and with him, went all those who did not Vote for boarding the <HI>French</HI> Man of War. They had with them a small Sloop, that had been taken by them some Time before, which they gave to <HI>Vane,</HI> and the discarded Members; and that they might be in a Condition to provide for themselves, by their own honest Endeavours, they let them have a sufficient Quantity of Provisions and Ammuni∣tion along with them.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="115"/>
<HI>John Rackam</HI> was voted Captain of the Brigantine, in <HI>Vane</HI>'s Room, and proceeded towards the <HI>Caribee Islands,</HI> where we must leave him, till we have finished our Story of <HI>Charles Vane.</HI></P>
<P>The Sloop sailed for the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> and <HI>Vane</HI> and his Crew, put her into as good a Condi∣tion as they could, by the Way, to follow the old Trade. They cruised two or three Days off the North West Part of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and took a Sloop and two Pettiaga's, and all the Men entered with them; the Sloop they kept, and <HI>Robert Deal</HI> went Captain of her.</P>
<P>The 16th of <HI>December,</HI> the two Sloops came in∣to the Bay, where they found only one Sloop at an Anchor, call'd the <HI>Pearl</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Captain <HI>Charles Rowling</HI> Master, who got under Sail at the Sight of them; but the Pyrate Sloops coming near <HI>Rowling</HI>'s Sloop, and shewing no Colours, he fired at them; whereupon, they hoisted the black Flag, and fired three Guns each, at the <HI>Pearl;</HI> upon which she struck, and the Pyrates took Possession of her, and carried her away with them to a small Island called <HI>Barnacko,</HI> and there cleaned, meeting in the Way with a Sloop from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Captain <HI>Wallden</HI> Commander, going down to the Bay, which they made Prize of.</P>
<P>In <HI>February, Vane</HI> sail'd from <HI>Barnacko,</HI> in order for a Cruize; but some Days after he was out, a violent Turnado overtook him, which separated him from his Consort, and after two Days Distress, threw his Sloop upon a small uninhabited Island, near the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> where she was staved to Pieces, and most of her Men drowned: <HI>Vane</HI> him∣self was saved, but reduced to great Streights, for want of Necessaries, having no Opportunity to get any Thing from the Wreck. He lived here some Weeks, and was subsisted chiefly by Fishermen,
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
who frequented the Island, with small Craft, from the Main, to catch Turtles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>While <HI>Vane</HI> was upon this Island, a Ship put in from <HI>Jamaica</HI> for Water, the Captain of which, one <HI>Holford,</HI> an old Buccaneer, happened to be <HI>Vane</HI>'s Acquaintance; he thought this a good Opportu∣nity to get off, and accordingly apply'd to his old Friend; but he absolutely refused him, saying to him, Charles, <HI>I shan't trust you aboard my Ship, un∣less I carry you a Prisoner, for I shall have you caballing with my Men, knock me in the Head, and run away with my Ship a-pyrating. Vane</HI> made all the Protestations of Honour in the World to him; but it seems Captain <HI>Holford</HI> was too intimately acquainted with him, to repose any Confidence at all in his Words or Oaths. He told him, <HI>he might easily find a Way to get off, if he had a Mind to it: I am now go∣ing down the Bay,</HI> says he, <HI>and shall return hither, in about a Month; and if I find you upon the Island when I come back, I'll carry you to</HI> Jamaica <HI>and hang you. Which Way can I get away?</HI> Answers <HI>Vane. Are there not Fishermen's Dories upon the Beach? can't you take one of them?</HI> Replies <HI>Holford. What,</HI> says <HI>Vane, would you have me steal a Dory then? Do you make it a Matter of Conscience?</HI> Said <HI>Holford</HI> again, <HI>to steal a Dory, when you have been a common Robber and Pyrate, stealing Ships and Cargoes, and plundering all Mankind that fell in your Way? Stay there and be d—n'd, if you are so Squeamish:</HI> And so left him.</P>
<P>After Captain <HI>Holford</HI>'s Departure, another Ship put in to the same Island in her Way home, for Water; none of whose Company knowing <HI>Vane,</HI> he easily passed upon them for another Man, and so was shipped for the Voyage. One would be apt to think that <HI>Vane</HI> was now pretty safe, and likely to escape the Fate which his Crimes had merited; but here a cross Accident happened, that was <HI>Vane</HI>'s
<PB N="111" REF="117"/>
Ruin. <HI>Holford</HI> returning from the Bay, was met with by this Ship; the Captains being very well acquainted together, <HI>Holford</HI> was invited to dine aboard of him, which he did; and as he passed a long to the Cabin, he chanced to cast his Eye down the Hold, and there saw <HI>Charles Vane</HI> at Work; he immediately spoke to the Captain, saying, <HI>Do you know who you have got aboard here? Why,</HI> says he, <HI>I have shipped a Man at such an Island, who was cast away in a trading Sloop, he seems to be a brisk Hand. I tell you,</HI> says Captain <HI>Holford, it is</HI> Vane <HI>the notorious Pyrate. If it be him,</HI> replies the other, <HI>I won't keep him: Why then,</HI> says <HI>Holford, I'll send and take him aboard, and Surrender him at</HI> Jamaica. Which being agreed to, Captain <HI>Holford,</HI> as soon as he returned to his Ship, sent his Boat with his Mate armed, who coming to <HI>Vane,</HI> shewed him a Pistol, and told him, <HI>he was his Prisoner;</HI> which none opposing, he was brought aboard and put in Irons; and when Captain <HI>Holford</HI> arrived at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> he delivered his old Accquaintance into the Hands of Justice; at which Place he was tryed, convicted and exe∣cuted, as was some Time before <HI>Vane</HI>'s Consort, <HI>Robert Deal,</HI> brought thither by one of the Men of War.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. OF Captain <HI>John Rackam,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>John Rackan</HI> as has been mentioned in the last Chapter, was Quarter-Master to <HI>Vane</HI>'s Company, till they were divided, and <HI>Vane</HI> turned out for refusing to board and fight the <HI>French</HI> Man of War; then <HI>Rackam</HI> was voted Captain of that Division that remained in the Bri∣gantine. The 24th of <HI>November</HI> 1718, was the first Day of his Command, and his first Cruize was among the <HI>Carribee Islands,</HI> where he took and plun∣der'd several Vessels.</P>
<P>We have already taken Notice, that when Cap∣tain <HI>Woodes Rogers</HI> went to the Island of <HI>Providence,</HI> with the King's Pardon to such as should Surren∣der; this Brigantine which <HI>Rackam</HI> now command∣ed, made its Escape, through another Passage, bid∣ding Defiance to Mercy.</P>
<P>To Windward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> a <HI>Madera</HI> Man fell into the Pyrates Way, which they detained two or three Days, till they had made their Market out of her, and then gave her back to the Master, and permitted one <HI>Hosea Tisdell,</HI> a Tavern-Keeper at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who had been picked up in one of their
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
Prizes, to depart in her, she being then bound for that Island.</P>
<P>After this Cruize, they went into a small Island and cleaned, and spent their <HI>Christmas</HI> ashore, drink∣ing and carousing as long as they had any Liquor left, and then went to Sea again for more, where they succeeded but too well, tho' they took no extraordinary Prize, for above two Months, ex∣cept a Ship laden with Thieves from <HI>Newgate,</HI> bound for the Plantations, which in few Days, was retaken with all her Cargo, by an <HI>English</HI> Man of War.</P>
<P>What became of <HI>Rackam</HI> after this, for above a twelve Month, I have not been able to discover; it is my Opinion, he was either chased ashore, by some superiour Force, or cast by Distress upon one of the small uninhabited Islands, where he re∣mained till he found an Opportunity to get off; for I find him in <HI>August</HI> 1720, upon the Coast of <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> in a small Sloop, with a few Hands, scour∣ing the Harbours and Inlets, on the North and West Part of it, among the Fishermen and small Craft, which was but low Game for him to run at.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> they took seven or eight Fishing-Boots in <HI>Harbour Island,</HI> stole their Nets and other Tackle, and then went off the <HI>French</HI> Part of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and landed, and took Cattle away, with two or three <HI>French</HI> Men they found near the Water-Side, hunting of wild Hogs in the Evening: The <HI>French</HI> Men came on Board, whether by Consent or Compulsion, I can't say. They afterwards plundered two Sloops, and re∣turned to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> on the North Coast of which Island, near <HI>Porto Maria</HI> Bay, they took a Scooner, <HI>Thomas Spenlow</HI> Master; it was then the 19th of <HI>October.</HI> The next Day, <HI>Rackam</HI> seeing a Sloop in <HI>Dry Harbour</HI> Bay, he stood in, and fired a Gun;
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
the Men all run ashore, and he took the Sloop and Lading, but when those ashore found them to be Pyrates, they hailed the Sloop, and let them know they were all willing to come aboard of them.</P>
<P><HI>Rackam</HI>'s coasting the Island in this Manner, pro∣ved fatal to him, for Intelligence came to the Go∣vernor, of his Expedition, by a Canoa which he had surprized ashore, in <HI>Ocho</HI> Bay; upon which a Sloop was immediately fitted out, and sent round the Island, in quest of him, commanded by Cap∣tain <HI>Barnet,</HI> with a good Number of Hands. <HI>Ra∣ckam</HI> rounding the Island, and drawing near the Westermost Point, called Point <HI>Negril,</HI> saw a small Pettiauger, which at sight of the Sloop, went ashore and landed her Men; when one of them hailed her, Answer was made, <HI>They were</HI> English <HI>Men,</HI> and desired the Pettiauger's Men to come on Board, and drink a Bowl of Punch, which they were prevailed upon to do; accordingly the Com∣pany came all aboard of the Pyrate, consisting of nine Persons, in an ill Hour; they were arm'd with Muskets and Cutlashes, but, what was their real Design by so doing, I shall not take upon me to say; but they had no sooner laid down their Arms, and taken up their Pipes, but <HI>Barnet</HI>'s Sloop, which was in Pursuit of <HI>Rackam</HI>'s, came in Sight.</P>
<P>The Pyrates finding she stood directly towards her, fear'd the Event, and weighed their Anchor, which they but lately let go, and stood off: Cap∣tain <HI>Barnet</HI> gave them Chace, and having the Ad∣vantage of little Breezes of Wind, which blew off the Land, came up with her, and, after a very small Dispute, took her, and brought her into <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>In about a Fortnight after the Prisoners were brought ashore, <HI>viz. November</HI> 16, 1720, a Court of Admiralty was held at St. <HI>Jago de la Vega,</HI> be∣fore which the following Persons were convicted,
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
and Sentence of Death passed upon them, by the President, Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws, viz. John Rackam</HI> Cap∣tain, <HI>George Fetherston</HI> Master, <HI>Richard Corner</HI> Quarter-Master, <HI>John Davis, John Howell, Patrick Carty, Tho∣mas Earl, James Dobbin</HI> and <HI>Noah Harwood.</HI> The first five were executed the next Day at <HI>Gallows Point,</HI> at the Town of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and the rest, the Day after, at <HI>Kingston; Rackam, Fetherston</HI> and <HI>Corner,</HI> were afterwards taken down and hang'd up in Chains, one at <HI>Plumb Point,</HI> one at <HI>Bush Key,</HI> and the other at <HI>Gun Key.</HI></P>
<P>But what was very surprizing, was, the Con∣viction of the nine Men that came aboard the Sloop the same Day she was taken. They were try'd at an Adjournment of the Court, on the 24th <HI>January,</HI> waiting all that Time, it is supposed, for Evidence, to prove the pyratical Intention of go∣ing aboard the said Sloop; for it seems there was no Act of Pyracy committed by them, after their coming on Board, as appeared by the Witnesses against them, who were two <HI>French</HI> Men taken by <HI>Rackam,</HI> off from the Island of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> and de∣posed in the following Manner.</P>
<P><Q>“That the Prisoners at the Bar, <HI>viz. John Eaton, Edward Warner, Thomas Baker, Thomas Quick, John Cole, Benjamin Palmer, Walter Rouse, John Hanson,</HI> and <HI>John Howard</HI> came aboard the Pyrate's Sloop at <HI>Negril Point, Rackam</HI> sending his Canoe ashore for that Purpose: That they brought Guns and Cutlashes on Board with them: That when Cap∣tain <HI>Barnet</HI> chased them, some were drinking, and others walking the Deck: That there was a great Gun and a small Arm fired by the Pyrate Sloop, at Captain <HI>Barnet</HI>'s Sloop, when he chased her; and that when Captain <HI>Barnet</HI>'s Sloop fired at <HI>Rackam</HI>'s Sloop, the Prisoners at the Bar went down under Deck. That during the Time Cap∣tain <HI>Barnet</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, some of the Prisoners
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
at the Bar (but which of them he could not tell) helped to row the Sloop, in order to escape from <HI>Barnet:</HI> That they all seemed to be consorted to∣gether.”</Q></P>
<P>This was the Substance of all that was evidenced against them, the Prisoners answered in their De∣fence, <Q>“That they had no Witnesses: That they had bought a Pettiauger in order to go a Turtle∣ing; and being at <HI>Negril Point,</HI> and just got ashore, they saw a Sloop with a white Pendant coming towards them, upon which they took their Arms, and hid themselves in the Bushes; That one of them hail'd the Sloop, who answer'd, <HI>They were</HI> English <HI>Men,</HI> and desired them all to come aboard and drink a Bowl of Punch; which they at first refused, but afterwards with much Perswasion, they went on Board, in the Sloop's Canoe, and left their own Pettiauger at Anchor: That they had been but a short Time on Board, when Cap∣tain <HI>Barnet's</HI> Sloop heaved in Sight: That <HI>Rackam</HI> ordered them to help to weigh the Sloop's An∣chor immediately, which they all refused: That <HI>Rackam</HI> used violent Means to oblige them; and that when Captain <HI>Barnet</HI> came up with them,” they all readily and willingly submitted.</Q></P>
<P>When the Prisoners were taken from the Bar, and the Persons present being withdrawn, the Court considered the Prisoners Case, and the Ma∣jority of the Commissioners being of Opinion, that they were all Guilty of the Pyracy and Fe∣lony they were charged with, which was, <HI>the go∣ing over with a pyratical and felonious Intent to</HI> John Ra∣ckam, &amp;c. <HI>then notorious Pyrates, and by them known to be so,</HI> they all received Sentence of Death; which every Body must allow proved somewhat unlucky to the poor Fellows.</P>
<P>On the 17th of <HI>February, John Eaton, Thomas Quick</HI> and <HI>Thomas Baker,</HI> were executed at <HI>Gallows Point,</HI>

<PB N="117" REF="124"/>
at <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and the next Day <HI>John Cole, John How∣ward</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Palmer,</HI> were executed at <HI>Kingston;</HI> whether the other three were executed afterwards, or not, I never heard.</P>
<P>Two other Pyrates were try'd that belonged to <HI>Rackam</HI>'s Crew, and being convicted, were brought up, and asked if either of them had any Thing to say, why Sentence of Death should not pass upon them, in like Manner as had been done to all the rest; and both of them pleaded their Bellies, be∣ing quick with Child, and pray'd that Execution might be stay'd, whereupon the Court passed Sen∣tence, as in Cases of Pyracy, but ordered them back, till a proper Jury should be appointed to en∣quire into the Matter.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> MARY READ.</HEAD>
<P>NOW we are to begin a History, full of sur∣prizing Turns and Adventures; I mean, that of <HI>Mary Read,</HI> and <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> alias <HI>Bonn,</HI> which were the true Names of these two Pyrates; the odd Incidents of their rambling Lives, are such, that some may be tempted to think the whole Story no better than a Novel or Romance; but since it is supported by many thousand Witnesses, I mean the People of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who were present at their Tryals, and heard the Story of their Lives, upon the first discovery of their Sex; the Truth of it, can be no more contested, than that there were such Men in the World, as <HI>Roberts</HI> and <HI>Black-beard,</HI> who were Pyrates.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="125"/>
<HI>Mary Read</HI> was born in <HI>England,</HI> her Mother was married young, to a Man who used the Sea, who going a Voyage soon after their Marriage, left her with Child, which Child prov'd to be a Boy. As to the Husband, whether he was cast away, or died in his Voyage, <HI>Mary Read</HI> could not tell; but however, he never returned more; nevertheless, the Mother, who was young and airy, met with an Accident, which has often happen'd to Women who are young, and do not take a great deal of Care; which was, she soon proved with Child again, without a Husband to Father it, but how, or by whom, none but herself could tell, for she carried a pretty good Reputation among her Neigh∣bours. Finding her Burthen grew, in order to conceal her Shame, she takes a formal Leave of her Husbands Relations, giving out, that she went to live with some Friends of her own, in the Country: Accordingly she went way, and carried with her, her young Son, at this Time, not a Year old: Soon after her Departure her Son died, but Providence in Return, was pleased to give her a Girl in his Room, of which she was safely delivered, in her Retreat, and this was our <HI>Mary Read.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Mother liv'd three or four Years, till what Money she had was almost gone; then she thought of returning to <HI>London,</HI> and considering that her Husband's Mother was in some Circum∣stances, she did not doubt but to prevail upon her, to provide for the Child, if she could but pass it upon her for the same, but the changing a Girl into a Boy, seem'd a difficult Piece of Work, and how to deceive an experienced old Woman, in such a Point, was altogether as impossible; however, she ventured to dress it up, as a Boy, brought it to Town, and presented it to her Mother in Law, as her Husband's Son; the old Woman would have taken it, to have bred it up, but the Mother pre∣tended
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
it would break her Heart, to part with it; so it was agreed betwixt them, that the Child should live with the Mother, and the supposed Grand∣mother should allow a Crown a Week for it's Maintainance.</P>
<P>Thus the Mother gain'd her Point, she bred up her Daughter as a Boy, and when she grew up to some Sense, she thought proper to let her into the Secret of her Birth, to induce her to conceal her Sex. It happen'd that the Grandmother died, by which Means the Subsistance that came from that Quarter, ceas'd, and they were more and more reduced in their Circumstances; wherefore she was obliged to put her Daughter out, to wait on a <HI>French</HI> Lady, as a Foot-boy, being now thirteen Years of Age: Here she did not live long, for growing bold and strong, and having also a roving Mind, she entered her self on Board a Man of War, where she served some Time, then quitted it, went over to <HI>Flanders,</HI> and carried Arms in a Re∣giment of Foot, as a <HI>Cadet;</HI> and tho' upon all Actions, she behaved herself with a great deal of Bravery, yet she could not get a Commission, they being gene∣rally bought and sold; therefore she quitted the Service, and took on, in a Regiment of Horse; she behaved so well, in several Engagements, that she got the Esteem of all her Officers; but her Com∣rade, who was a <HI>Fleming,</HI> happening to be a handsome young Fellow, she falls in Love with him, and, from that Time, grew a little more negligent in her Duty, so that, it seems, <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI> could not be served at the same Time; her Arms and Accoutrements which were always kept in the best Order, were quite neglected; 'tis true, when her Comrade was ordered out upon a Party, she used to go without being commanded, and fre∣quently run herself into Danger, where she had no Business, only to be near him; the rest of the
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
Troopers little suspecting the secret Cause which moved her to this Behaviour, fancied her to be mad, and her Comrade himself could not account for this strange Alteration in her, but Love is In∣genious, and as they lay in the same Tent, and were constantly together, she found a Way of let∣ting him discover her Sex, without appearing that it was done with Design.</P>
<P>He was much surprized at what he found out, and not a little pleased, taking it for granted, that he should have a Mistress solely to himself, which is an unusual Thing in a Camp, since there is scarce one of those Campaign Ladies, that is ever True to a Troop or Company; so that he thought of nothing but gratifying his Passions with very lit∣tle Ceremony; but he found himself strangely mi∣staken, for she prov'd very reserved and modest, and resisted all his Temptations, and at the same Time was so obliging and insinuating in her Car∣riage, that she quite changed his Purpose, so far from thinking of making her his Mistress, he now courted her for a Wife.</P>
<P>This was the utmost Wish of her Heart, in short, they exchanged Promises, and when the Campaign was over, and the Regiment march'd into Winter Quarters, they bought Womens Apparel for her, with such Money as they could make up betwixt them, and were publickly married.</P>
<P>The Story of two Troopers marrying each other, made a great Noise, so that several Officers were drawn by Curiosity to assist at the Ceremony, and they agreed among themselves, that every one of them should make a small Present to the Bride, towards House-keeping, in consideration of her having been their fellow Soldier. Thus being set up, they seemed to have a Desire of quitting the Service, and settling in the World; the Adventure of their Love and Marriage, had gain'd them so
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
much Favour, that they easily obtain'd their Dis∣charge, and they immediately set up an Eating House, or Ordinary, which was the Sign of the <HI>Three Horse-Shoes,</HI> near the Castle in <HI>Breda,</HI> where they soon run into a good Trade, a great many Officers eating with them constantly.</P>
<P>But this Happiness lasted not long, for the Hus∣band soon died, and the Peace of <HI>Reswick</HI> being concluded, there was no Resort of Officers to <HI>Breda,</HI> as usual; so that the Widow having little or no Trade, was forced to give up House-keeping, and her Substance being by Degrees quite spent, she again assumes her Man's Apparel, and going into <HI>Holland,</HI> there takes on in a Regiment of Foot, quarter'd in one of the Frontier Towns: Here she did not remain long, there was no likelihood of Preferment in Time of Peace, therefore she took a Resolution of seeking her Fortune another Way, and withdrawing from the Regiment, ships her∣self on Board of a Vessel bound for the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>It happen'd this Ship was taken by <HI>English</HI> Py∣rates, and <HI>Mary Read</HI> being the only <HI>English</HI> Per∣son on Board, they kept her amongst them, and having plundered the Ship, let it go again; after following this Trade for some Time, the King's Proclamation came out, and was publish'd in all Parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> for pardoning such Py∣rates, who should voluntarily surrender themselves by a certain Day, therein mentioned. The Crew of <HI>Mary Read,</HI> took the Benefit of this Proclama∣tion, and having surrender'd, liv'd quietly on Shore; but Money beginning to grow short, and hearing that Captain <HI>Woods Rogers,</HI> Governor of the Island of <HI>Providence,</HI> was fitting out some Privateers, to cruise against the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> she, with several others, embark'd for that Island, in order to go upon the privateering Account, being resolved to make her Fortune one Way or other.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="129"/>
These Privateers were no sooner sail'd out, but the Crews of some of them, who had been pardo∣ned, rose against their Commanders, and turn'd themselves to their old Trade: In this Number was <HI>Mary Read.</HI> It is true, she often declared, that the Life of a Pyrate was what she always abhor'd, and went into it only upon Compulsion, both this Time, and before, intending to quit it, whenever a fair Opportunity should offer it self; yet some of the Evidence against her, upon her Tryal, who were forced Men, and had sail'd with her, deposed upon Oath, that in Times of Action, no Person amongst them was more resolute, or ready to Board, or undertake any Thing that was hazardous, as she and <HI>Ann Bonny;</HI> and particularly at the Time they were attack'd and taken, when they came to close Quarters, none kept the Deck except <HI>Mary Read,</HI> and <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> and one more; up∣on which, she, <HI>Mary Read,</HI> called to those under Deck, to come up and fight like Men, and finding they did not stir, fired her Arms down the Hold amongst them, killing one, and wounding others.</P>
<P>This was part of the Evidence against her, which she denied; which, whether true or no, thus much is certain, that she did not want Bravery, nor in∣deed, was she less remarkable for her Modesty, according to her Notions of Virtue: Her Sex was not so much as suspected by any Person on Board, till <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> who was not altogether so reserv'd in point of Chastity, took a particular liking to her; in short, <HI>Ann Bonny</HI> took her for a handsome young Fellow, and for some Reasons best known to herself, first discovered her Sex to <HI>Mary Read; Mary Read</HI> knowing what she would be at, and being very sensible of her own Incapacity that Way, was forced to come to a right Understanding with her, and so to the great Disappointment of <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> she let her know she was a Woman also; but this
<PB N="123" REF="130"/>
Intimacy so disturb'd Captain <HI>Rackam,</HI> who was the Lover and Gallant of <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> that he grew furiously jealous, so that he told <HI>Ann Bonny,</HI> he would cut her new Lover's Throat, therefore, to quiet him, she let him into the Secret also.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Rackan,</HI> (as he was enjoin'd,) kept the Thing a Secret from all the Ships Company, yet, notwithstanding all her Cunning and Reserve, Love found her out in this Disguise, and hinder'd her from forgetting her Sex. In their Cruize they took a great Number of Ships belonging to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Parts of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> bound to, and from <HI>England;</HI> and when ever they met a good Artist, or other Person, who might be of any great Use to their Company, if he was not willing to enter, it was their Custom to keep him by Force. Among these was a young Fellow, of a most ingage∣ing Behaviour, or, at least, he was so in the Eyes of <HI>Mary Read,</HI> who became so smitten with his Person and Address, that she could neither rest, Night or Day; but as there is nothing more inge∣nious than Love, it was no hard Matter for her, who had before been practiced in these Wiles, to find a Way to let him discover her Sex: She first insinuated her self into his liking, by talking against the Life of a Pyrate, which he was altogether averse to, so they became Mess-Mates, and strict Companions: When she found he had a Friendship for her, as a Man, she suffered the Discovery to be made, by carelesly shewing her Breasts, which were very White.</P>
<P>The young Fellow, who was made of Flesh and Blood, had his Curiosity and Desire so rais'd by this Sight, that he never ceas'd importuning her, till she confess'd what she was. Now begins the Scene of Love; as he had a Liking and Esteem for her, under her supposed Character, it was now turn'd into Fondness and Desire; her Passion was
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
no less violent than his, and perhaps she express'd it, by one of the most generous Actions that ever Love inspired. It happened this young Fellow had a Quarrel with one of the Pyrates, and their Ship then lying at Anchor, near one of the Islands, they had appointed to go ashore and fight, accor∣ding to the Custom of the Pyrates: <HI>Mary Read,</HI> was to the last Degree uneasy and anxious, for the Fate of her Lover; she would not have had him refuse the Challenge, because, she could not bear the Thoughts of his being branded with Cowardise; on the other Side, she dreaded the Event, and ap∣prehended the Fellow might be too hard for him: When Love once enters into the Breasts of one who has any Sparks of Generosity, it stirs the Heart up to the most noble Actions; in this Dilem∣ma she shew'd, that she fear'd more for his Life than she did for her own; for she took a Resolution of quarreling with this Fellow her self, and ha∣ving challenged him ashore, she appointed the Time two Hours sooner than that when he was to meet her Lover, where she fought him at Sword and Pistol, and killed him upon the Spot.</P>
<P>It is true, she had fought before, when she had been insulted by some of those Fellows, but now it was altogether in her Lover's Cause, she stood as it were betwixt him and Death, as if she could not live without him. If he had no regard for her before, this Action would have bound him to her for ever; but there was no Occasion for Ties or Obligations, his Inclination towards her was suffici∣ent; in fine, they applied their Troth to each other, which <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Read</HI> said, she look'd upon to be as good a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in Conscience, as if it had been done by a Minister in Church; and to this was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> great Belly, which she pleaded to save her Life.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="132"/>
She declared she had never committed Adultery or Fornication with any Man, she commended the Justice of the Court, before which she was tried, for distinguishing the Nature of their Crimes; her Hus∣band, as she call'd him, with several others, being acquitted; and being ask'd, who he was? she would not tell, but, said he was an honest Man, and had no Inclinations to such Practices, and that they had both resolved to leave the Pyrates, the first Opportunity, and apply themselves to some ho∣nest Livelihood.</P>
<P>It is no doubt, but many had Compassion for her, yet the Court could not avoid finding her Guilty; for among other Things, one of the Evidences against her, deposed, that being taken by <HI>Rackam,</HI> and detain'd some Time on Board, he fell accident∣ally into Discourse with <HI>Mary Read,</HI> whom he ta∣king for a young Man, ask'd her, what Pleasure she could have in being concerned in such Enterprizes, where her Life was continually in Danger, by Fire or Sword; and not only so, but she must be sure of dying an ignominious Death, if she should be taken alive?—She answer'd, that as to hang∣ing, she thought it no great Hardship, for, were it not for that, every cowardly Fellow would turn Pyrate, and so infest the Seas, that Men of Courage must starve:—That if it were put to the Choice of the Pyrates, they would not have the Punish∣ment less than Death, the Fear of which, kept some dastardy Rogues honest; that many of those who are now cheating the Widows and Orphans, and oppressing their poor Neighbours, who have no Money to obtain Justice, would then rob at Sea, and the Ocean would be crowded with Rogues, like the Land, and no Merchant would venture out; so that the Trade, in a little Time, would not be worth following.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="133"/>
Being found quick with Child, as has been ob∣served, her Execution was respited, and it is pos∣sible she would have found Favour, but she was seiz'd with a violent Feaver, soon after her Tryal, of which she died in Prison.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> LIFE <HI>of</HI> ANNE BONNY.</HEAD>
<P>AS we have been more particular in the Lives of these two Women, than those of other Pyrates, it is incumbant on us, as a faithful Historian, to begin with their Birth. <HI>Anne Bonny</HI> was born at a Town near <HI>Cork,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> her Father being an Attorney at Law, but <HI>Anne</HI> was not one of his legitimate Issue, which seems to cross an old Proverb, which says, <HI>that Ba∣stards have the best Luck.</HI> Her Father was a married Man, and his Wife having been brought to Bed, contracted an Illness in her lying in, and in order to recover her Health, she was advised to remove for Change of Air; the Place she chose, was a few Miles distance from her Dwelling, where her Hus∣band's Mother liv'd. Here she sojourn'd some Time, her Husband staying at Home, to follow his Af∣fairs. The Servant-maid, whom she left to look after the House, and attend the Family, being a handsome young Woman, was courted by a young Man of the same Town, who was a <HI>Tanner;</HI> this <HI>Tanner</HI> used to take his Opportunities, when the Family was out of the Way, of coming to pursue his Courtship; and being with the Maid one Day, as she was employ'd in the Houshold Business, not
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
having the Fear of God before his Eyes, he takes his Opportunity, when her Back was turn'd, of whiping three Silver Spoons into his Pocket. The Maid soon miss'd the Spoons, and knowing that no Body had been in the Room, but her self and the young Man, since she saw them last, she charg∣ed him with taking them; he very stifly denied it, upon which she grew outragious, and threatned to go to a Constable, in order to carry him before a Justice of Peace: These Manaces frighten'd him out of his Wits, well knowing he could not stand Search; wherefore he endeavoured to pacify her, by desiring her to examine the Drawers and other Places, and perhaps she might find them; in this Time he slips into another Room, where the Maid usually lay, and puts the Spoons betwixt the Sheets, and then makes his Escape by a back Door, concluding she must find them, when she went to Bed, and so next Day he might pretend he did it only to frighten her, and the Thing might be laugh'd off, for a Jest.</P>
<P>As soon as she miss'd him, she gave over her Search, concluding he had carried them off, and went directly to the Constable, in order to have him apprehended: The young Man was inform'd, that a Constable had been in Search of him, but he regarded it but little, not doubting but all would be well next Day. Three or four Days pass'd, and still he was told, the Constable was upon the Hunt for him; this made him lye conceal'd, he could not comprehend the Meaning of it, he imagined no less, than that the Maid had a Mind to convert the Spoons to her own Use, and put the Robbery upon him.</P>
<P>It happen'd, at this Time, that the Mistress be∣ing perfectly recover'd of her late Indisposition, was return'd Home, in Company with her Mother in Law; the first News she heard, was of the Loss
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
of the Spoons, with the Manner how; the Maid telling her, at the same Time, that the young Man was run away. The young Fellow had Intelligence of the Mistress's Arrival, and considering with himself, that he could never appear again in his Business, unless this Matter was got over, and she being a good natured Woman, he took a Resolution of going directly to her, and of telling her the whole Story, only with this difference, that he did it for a Jest.</P>
<P>The Mistress could scarce believe it, however, she went directly to the Maid's Room, and turn∣ing down the Bed Cloaths, there, to her great Surprize, found the three Spoons; upon this she desired the young Man to go Home and mind his Business, for he should have no Trouble about it.</P>
<P>The Mistress could not imagine the Meaning of this, she never had found the Maid guilty of any pilfering, and therefore it could not enter her Head, that she designed to steal the Spoons her∣self; upon the whole, she concluded the Maid had not been in her Bed, from the Time the Spoons were miss'd, she grew immediately jealous upon it, and suspected, that the Maid supplied her Place with her Husband, during her Absence, and this was the Reason why the Spoons were no sooner found.</P>
<P>She call'd to Mind several Actions of Kindness, her Husband had shew'd the Maid, Things that pass'd unheeded by, when they happen'd, but now she had got that Tormenter, Jealousy, in her Head, amounted to Proofs of their Intimacy; another Cir∣cumstance which strengthen'd the whole, was, that tho' her Husband knew she was to come Home that Day, and had had no Communication with her in four Months, which was before her last Lying i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, yet he took an Opportunity of going out
<PB N="129" REF="136"/>
of Town that Morning, upon some slight Pretence:—All these Things put together, confirm'd her in her Jealously.</P>
<P>As Women seldom forgive Injuries of this Kind, she thought of discharging her Revenge upon the Maid: In order to this, she leaves the Spoons where she found them, and orders the Maid to put clean Sheets upon the Bed, telling her, she intended to lye there her self that Night, because her Mother in Law was to lye in her Bed, and that she (the Maid) must lye in another Part of the House; the Maid in making the Bed, was surprized with the Sight of the Spoons, but there were very good Reasons, why it was not proper for her to tell where she found them, therefore she takes them up, puts them in her Trunk, intending to leave them in some Place, where they might be found by Chance.</P>
<P>The Mistress, that every Thing might look to be done without Design, lyes that Night in the Maid's Bed, little dreaming of what an Adventure it would produce: After she had been a Bed some Time, thinking on what had pass'd, for Jealousey kept her awake, she heard some Body enter the Room; at first she apprehended it to be Thieves, and was so frightned, she had not Courage enough to call out; but when she heard these Words, Mary, <HI>are you awake?</HI> She knew it to be her Husband's Voice; then her Fright was over, yet she made no Answer, least he should find her out, if she spoke, therefore she resolv'd to counterfeit Sleep, and take what follow'd.</P>
<P>The Husband came to Bed, and that Night play'd the vigorous Lover; but one Thing spoil'd the Diversion on the Wife's Side, which was, the Reflection that it was not design'd for her; however she was very passive, and bore it like a Christian. Early before Day, she stole out of
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
Bed, leaving him asleep, and went to her Mother in Law, telling her what had pass'd, not forgeting how he had used her, as taking her for the Maid; the Husband also stole out, not thinking it convenient to be catch'd in that Room; in the mean Time, the Revenge of the Mistress was strongly against the Maid, and without considering, that to her she ow'd the Diversion of the Night before, and that one good <HI>Turn</HI> should deserve another; she sent for a Constable, and charged her with stealing the Spoons: The Maid's Trunk was broke open, and the Spoons found, upon which she was carried be∣fore a Justice of Peace, and by him committed to Goal.</P>
<P>The Husband loiter'd about till twelve a Clock at Noon, then comes Home, pretending he was just come to Town; as soon as he heard what had passed, in Relation to the Maid, he fell into a great Passion against the Wife; this set the Thing into a greater Flame, the Mother takes the Wife's Part against her own Son, insomuch that the Quarrel increasing, the Mother and Wife took Horse im∣mediately, and went back to the Mother's House, and the Husband and Wife never bedded toge∣ther after.</P>
<P>The Maid lay along Time in the Prison, it being near half a Year to the Assizes; but before it hap∣pened, it was discovered she was with Child; when she was arraign'd at the Bar, she was discharged for want of Evidence; the Wife's Conscience touch'd her, and as she did not believe the Maid Guilty of any Theft, except that of Love, she did not appear against her; soon after her Acquittal, she was delivered of a Girl.</P>
<P>But what alarm'd the Husband most, was, that it was discovered the Wife was with Child also, he taking it for granted, he had had no Intimacy with her, since her last lying in, grew jealous of
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
her, in his Turn, and made this a Handle to justi∣fie himself, for his Usage of her, pretending now he had suspected her long, but that here was Proof; she was delivered of Twins, a Boy and a Girl.</P>
<P>The Mother falling ill, sent to her Son to recon∣cile him to his Wife, but he would not hearken to it; wherefore she made a Will, leaving all she had in the Hands of certain Trustees, for the Use of the Wife and two Children lately born, and died a few Days after.</P>
<P>This was an ugly Turn upon him, his greatest Dependance being upon his Mother; however, his Wife was kinder to him than he deserved, for she made him a yearly Allowance out of what was left, tho' they continued to live separate: It lasted near five Years; at this Time having a great Affection for the Girl he had by his Maid, he had a Mind to take it Home, to live with him; but as all the Town knew it to be a Girl, the better to disguise the Matter from them, as well as from his Wife, he had it put in Breeches, as a Boy, pre∣tending it was a Relation's Child he was to breed up to be his Clerk.</P>
<P>The Wife heard he had a little Boy at Home he was very fond of, but as she did not know any Relation of his that had such a Child, she em∣ploy'd a Friend to enquire further into it; this Person by talking with the Child, found it to be a Girl, discovered that the Servant-Maid was its Mother, and that the Husband still kept up his Correspondence with her.</P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence, the Wife being unwil∣ling that her Children's Money should go towards the Maintenance of Bastards, stop'd the Allowance: The Husband inraged, in a kind of Revenge, takes the Maid home, and lives with her publickly, to the great Scandal of his Neighbours; but he soon
<PB N="132" REF="139"/>
found the bad Effect of it, for by Degrees he lost his Practice, so that he saw plainly he could not live there, therefore he thought of removing, and turning what Effects he had into ready Money; he goes to <HI>Cork,</HI> and there with his Maid and Daughter, embarques for <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>At first he followed the Practice of the Law in that Province, but afterwards fell into Merchan∣dize, which proved more succesful to him, for he gained by it sufficient to purchase a considerable Plantation: His Maid, who passed for his Wife, happened to dye, after which his Daughter, our <HI>Anne Bonny,</HI> now grown up kept his House.</P>
<P>She was of a fierce and couragious Temper, wherefore, when she lay under Condemnation, several Stories were reported of her, much to her Disadvantage, as that she had kill'd an <HI>English</HI> Ser∣vant-Maid, once in her Passion with a Case-Knife, while she look'd after her Father's House; but upon further Enquiry, I found this Story to be groundless: It was certain she was so Robust, that once, when a young Fellow would have lain with her, against her Will, she beat him so, that he lay ill of it a considerable Time.</P>
<P>While she lived with her Father, she was look'd upon as one that would be a good Fortune, where∣fore it was thought her Father expected a good Match for her; but she spoilt all, for without his Consent, she Marries a young Fellow, who be∣longed to the Sea, and was not worth a Groat; which provoked her Father to such a Degree, that he turned her out of Doors, upon which the young Fellow who married her, finding himself disappointed in his Expectation, shipped himself and Wife, for the Island of <HI>Providence,</HI> expecting Employment there.</P>
<P>Here she became acquainted with <HI>Rackam</HI> the Pyrate, who making Courtship to her, soon found
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
Means of withdrawing her Affections from her Husband, so that she consented to elope from him, and go to Sea with <HI>Rackam</HI> in Mens Cloaths: She was as good as her Word, and after she had been at Sea some Time, she proved with Child, and beginning to grow big, <HI>Rackam</HI> landed her on the Island of <HI>Cuba;</HI> and recommending her there, to some Friends of his, they took Care of her, till she was brought to Bed: When she was up and well again, he sent for her, to bear him Company.</P>
<P>The King's Proclamation being out, for pardon∣ing of Pyrates, he took the Benefit of it, and sur∣rendered; afterwards being sent upon the priva∣teering Account, he returned to his old Trade, as has been already hinted, in the Story of <HI>Mary Read.</HI> In all these Expeditions, <HI>Anne Bonny</HI> bore him Com∣pany, and when any Business was to be done in their Way, no Body was more forward or coura∣gious than she, and particularly when they were taken; she and <HI>Mary Read,</HI> with one more, were all the Persons that durst keep the Deck, as has been before hinted.</P>
<P>Her Father was known to a great many Gentle∣men, Planters of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> who had dealt with him, and among whom he had a good Reputation; and some of them, who had been in <HI>Carolina,</HI> remem∣ber'd to have seen her in his House; wherefore they were inclined to shew her Favour, but the Action of leaving her Husband was an ugly Cir∣cumstance against her. The Day that <HI>Rackam</HI> was executed, by special Favour, he was admitted to see her; but all the Comfort she gave him, was, <HI>that she was sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a Man, he need not have been hang'd like a Dog.</HI></P>
<P>She was continued in Prison, to the Time of her lying in, and afterwards reprieved from Time to Time; but what is become of her since, we can∣not
<PB N="134" REF="141"/>
tell; only this we know, that she was not executed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. OF Captain <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDward England</HI> was a Pyrate of considerable Rank, he had the Command of a Sloop in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> in the Year 1717, when the Money was stole that had been fished up out of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Wrecks. He was some Time at <HI>Pro∣vidence,</HI> but left it before the Arrival of Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> and sailed to the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> where he took several Ships and Vessels, particularly the <HI>Cadogan</HI> Snow from <HI>Bristol,</HI> at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> Captain <HI>Skinner;</HI> who was in a barbarous and inhumane Manner murdered by Part of the Pyrate Crew, who the Voyage before had belonged to the said <HI>Skinner,</HI> and served on Board his Vessel; but some Difference happening, the Captain thought fit to put them on Board of a Man of War, and at the same Time refused to pay them their Wages that was due. These Men found Means to desert that Service in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and shipping themselves in a Merchant Sloop, which was afterwards taken by Captain <HI>England,</HI> they entered with him. When the Pyrates made Prize of the <HI>Cadogan</HI> Snow, they
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
ordered the Master of her to come aboard in his Boat, which he did, and the Person that he first cast his Eye upon, proved to be his former Boat∣swain, who stared him in the Face like his evil Genius, and accosted him in the following Manner: <HI>Ah Captain</HI> Skinner! <HI>Is it you? The only Man I wish'd to see; I am deeply in your Debt, and now I shall pay you all in your own Coin.</HI> The poor Man trembled every Joint, when he found into what Company he had got, and dreaded the Event, which he had Reason enough to do; for the Boatswain immediately called to his Consorts, laid hold of the Captain, and made him fast to the Windless, and there pelted him with empty Glass Bottles, which broke upon his Body and cut him in a sad Manner; after∣wards they whipp'd him about the Deck, till they were weary, then told him, because he was a good Master to his Men, he should have an easy Death, and so shot him thro' the Head, and tumb∣led him overboard into the Sea. The chief Mate of this Snow, was <HI>Howel Davis,</HI> who is the Sub∣ject of the following Chapter.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>England</HI> took a Ship, called the Pearl, Captain <HI>Tyzard,</HI> which he fitted up for his own Service, mounted her with 30 Guns, and called her the <HI>Royal James,</HI> and with her took a great Number of Ships of all Nations, on the Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> the Isle of <HI>May,</HI> and the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands; from whence he went to the <HI>West-Indies</HI> again, but returned to the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> in <HI>March</HI> following, 1719, and in, and off the River <HI>Gambia,</HI> took the following Ships and Vessels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Eagle</HI> Pink, Captain <HI>Rickets</HI> Commander, belonging to <HI>Cork,</HI> taken the 25th of <HI>March,</HI> ha∣ving 6 Guns and 17 Men on Board, seven of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="143"/>
The <HI>Charlotte,</HI> Captain <HI>Oldson,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken <HI>May</HI> the 26th, having 8 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 13 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sarah,</HI> Captain <HI>Stunt,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 27th of <HI>May,</HI> having 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 3 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bentworth,</HI> Captain <HI>Garner,</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> taken the 27th of of <HI>May,</HI> having 12 Guns and 30 Men on Board, 12 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Buck</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Sylvester,</HI> of <HI>Gambia,</HI> taken the 27 of <HI>May,</HI> having 2 Guns and 2 Men on Board, and both turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carteret,</HI> Captain <HI>Snow,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> having 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 5 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mercury,</HI> Captain <HI>Maggott,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 29th of <HI>May,</HI> having 4 Guns and 18 Men on Board, 5 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coward</HI> Galley, Captain <HI>Creed,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> taken the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> having 2 Guns and 13 Men on Board, 4 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elizabeth and Katherine,</HI> Captain <HI>Bridge,</HI> of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> taken <HI>June</HI> the 27th, having 6 Guns and 14 Men on Board, 4 of which turned Pyrates.</P>
<P>The three first were sent away to <HI>Jamaica, Vir∣ginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> the two last they detained, and all the rest they burnt.</P>
<P>After the taking of these Prizes, they cleaned and staid six or eight Weeks, pursuing their Di∣versions, which were not the most commendable, and put to Sea again; when they came out (as is the usual Way with the Pyrates) they put it to a Vote which Way they should Sail, and the Majo∣rity of the Company being for the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> they shap'd their Course for the Island of <HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>They staid here only till they had cleaned and refitted their Ship and Vessels, and got aboard a
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
Stock of Provisions from the Natives, which they exchanged Goods for, and then proceeded to the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> where they cruised for several Months.</P>
<P><HI>Malabar</HI> is a fine fruitful Country in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> in the Empire of the <HI>Mogul,</HI> but immedia∣tely Subject to its own Princes; it reaches from the Coast of <HI>Canara,</HI> to Cape <HI>Comorin,</HI> which is between 7°, 30, and 12° North Latitude; and in about 75 Degrees East Longitude, counting from the Meridian of <HI>London.</HI> The old Natives are Pagans, but there are a great Number of Mahometans in∣habiting among them, who are either Merchants or Pyrates, and all very Rich. These Pyrates pay Allegiance and Taxes to those <HI>Indian</HI> Kings, whose Harbours they frequent, and they find Pro∣tection as other People do; and when any Prize is taken, the Merchants make no Scruple of buy∣ing their goods, and carrying on a Trade openly with them. On the same Coast, but in another Province to the Northward, lies <HI>Goa, Surat, Bombay,</HI> and several other Settlements belonging to the <HI>English, Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>Hither our Pyrates made their Voyage, which somewhat impoverish'd the Company, not having taken any Thing in a Run of about 3300 Leagues, almost the Distance of half the Globe; but were here rewarded for all their Labour, for they plunder'd the Country Ships, and traded with their own Merchants, and sometimes perhaps for their own Goods: They turned the best Part of their Cargo into Diamonds and precious Stones, of which they had got a considerable Quantity, and went back towards <HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>Between the Northern Part of the above Island, and the Coast of <HI>Zanquebar,</HI> lies a little Island called <HI>Johanna,</HI> which our outward-bound <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, at least, those who are bound for
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
<HI>Surat,</HI> and that Way, put in for Water and Re∣freshments; hither <HI>England</HI> directed his Course, in order to look into the Harbour, and chanced to fall in with two <HI>East-India</HI> Ships of near 500 Tun Burthen, each, and thirty odd Guns; a Force su∣perior to them; however they hoisted their black Colours, and gave them Chase. The <HI>India</HI> Ships had no Business to speak with them, if they could help it, and therefore stood from the Pyrates with all the Sail they could make; but one of them (call the <HI>Cassandra,</HI> in Honour of the Dutchess of <HI>Chandois,</HI> Captain <HI>Mackray</HI> Commander) sailing heavy, the Pyrate Ship with 24 Guns came soon up with her, and engaged her; whilst the other, which <HI>England</HI> the Commadore was on Board of, made after the <HI>Greenwich,</HI> Captain <HI>Kirby</HI> Commander. <HI>Mackray</HI> behaved himself very gallantly, and killed the Pyrate a great many Men, and would certain∣ly have destroyed him, had not <HI>England</HI> left the <HI>Greenwich,</HI> to succour his Consort; and had <HI>Kirby</HI> done the same, and brought his Ship into the Engagement, the <HI>East-India</HI> Men would have been a Match sufficient for them; but Captain <HI>Kirby</HI> determined to take Care of one, and so run away in a cowardly Manner.</P>
<P>Both the Pyrate Ships fell upon the <HI>Cassandra,</HI> whom she fought for some Time, till finding her self over-powered, and being near the Shore, she run in and grounded, and the Captain and all the Men escaped to the Island, and fled up into the Woods, not caring to trust themselves in the Hands of those, who are restrained by no Laws, either hu∣mane or divine.</P>
<P>The Pyrates took Possession of the Ship, and soon after received a Message from Captain <HI>Mack∣ray,</HI> the Purport of which, was, to desire them to return his Ship to him, after they had plundered her of what they thought fit; which <HI>England</HI> was

willing to do, but puting the Question to a Vote, it passed in the Negative among them; however, they gave him their smallest Pyrate Ship, and 50 Bales of Cloath, and the Captain and his Men came safe in her to <HI>Bombay.</HI></P>
<P>The Pyrates went into <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and refited the <HI>Cassandra,</HI> which was pretty much torn in the Engagement, mounted 46 Guns aboard her, the <HI>Royal James</HI> having then 34; they stayed here till the Beginning of the new Year 1721, and then put to Sea, steering their Course back to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> for the Gulph of <HI>Bengal.</HI> They came off our Company's principal Settlement, at the Time that three stout Ships were ready for their Voyage to <HI>Europe;</HI> and cruising there some Time, block'd up the Harbour; till at length the <HI>India</HI> Men came to a Resolution to fight the Pyrates, and accordingly sailed out: The Pyrates received them, and a small Skirmish ensued, but the <HI>India</HI> Ships, as soon as they found they had got the Heels of the others, made those as use∣ful as they could to them, and very gallantly ran away from the Rovers.</P>
<P>From Fort St. <HI>George, England</HI> stood along the Coast of <HI>Coromondel,</HI> and took two or three small Ships that were Trading from Port to Port, to make up the Lading for the <HI>European</HI> Ships. They ranged from Coast to Coast, from the <HI>Ganges</HI> to the Straits of <HI>Malaca,</HI> and met with several Vessels with Muslins, Silks, and such like Wares, which they plundered to a vast Quantity, then visited the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> in their Way back, and re∣turned to their Rendezvous at <HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be observed, that when the Captain and the Crew of the <HI>Cassandra,</HI> arrived at <HI>Bombay,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boone,</HI> the Governor there for the <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany, dispatched an Express home of the Pro∣ceedings of these Pyrates, which procured four Men
<PB N="140" REF="147"/>
of War to be sent after them, <HI>viz.</HI> two 60 Gun Ships, a 50 Gun Ship, and a 24 Gun Ship, which <HI>England</HI> had timely Notice of, by a small Ship that accidently put into <HI>Madagascar</HI> whilst he was there.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> he left the Island, but would not venture to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> again, but cruised up and down among the Islands to the Eastward of <HI>Madagascar,</HI> many hundred Leagues, and visited several of them. At <HI>Mascarenas,</HI> or, (as the <HI>French</HI> call it) <HI>Bourbon,</HI> he saw a large Ship at Anchor in the Bay, upon which they stood off all Day, and kept out of Sight. In the Evening, being well prepared for the Enterprize, they stood into the Bay with a gentle Breeze of Wind, clapt the Ship aboard at once, and entered a hundred stout Fellows, with a Cutlash, and a brace of Pi∣stoles each; and after a short Dispute, wherein twenty or thirty Men were killed, she became their Prize: They turned the Prisoners down into the Hold, cut the Prizes Cables, and brought her out that Night to Sea. This proved to be an ex∣traordinary Purchase to the Rovers, she being a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Man of War of 60 Guns, and had on Board, Seamen, Passengers and Negroes, in all, to the Number of 1000 Men. She came from <HI>Goa</HI> with the <HI>Conde Ericeira,</HI> the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vice-Roy of the <HI>Indies,</HI> removed from his Government, for some Male Administration, and was then going to <HI>Brasil,</HI> with all his Wealth, Servants and Attendants; as also the Archbishop of <HI>Goa,</HI> but happen'd to be both ashore when they surpriz'd the Ship.</P>
<P>They did not judge it convenient to return to their old Rendezvous with the Prize, because it was likely that the Men of War might call in there in their Way, which would not prove so agreeable to them, therefore having Provisions and Water sufficient, they steered away for the
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
Main of <HI>Africa,</HI> and arrived at a little Place, call'd <HI>Delagoa,</HI> near the River <HI>de Spiritu Sancto,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> in about 26° South Latitude. They came too in the Evening, and was saluted from the Shore with a few Shot, which surprized the Pyrates, not imagining any Fortification to be there; they anchored farther off for that Night, and perceiving in the Morning a small Fort of six Guns, they run up to it and battered it down.</P>
<P>This was a Settlement the <HI>Dutch</HI> had planted not many Months before, but never troubled themselves about them afterwards, nor sent them any Relief; there were 150 Men there at first, but dwindled away by Sickness and Casualties, so that I judge that there's hardly any of them left at this Time: Sixteen of them petitioned to be taken a∣board the Pyrates, which, with some Difficulty, was granted.</P>
<P>There was found in this Ship so great a Trea∣sure, that it put the old Pyrates beside all Thoughts of pursuing any more such like Adven∣tures; which, added to their former Plunder, made a very great Sum together, and consisted chiefly in rough Diamonds, hard Dollars, Gold Crosses, and other Trinkets; fine Muslins, Chintses, and such Things, they esteemed no more than Rags, or useless Lumber, bestowing a great Quantity upon the poor half-starved <HI>Dutch</HI> Men at this Place, who traffick'd with other Ships that put in there afterwards, for Provisions and Necessaries, at the Rate of about three Farthings a Yard <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>They could not all come to a Resolution of quitting that Course of Life, wherein they had met with so much Success, and therefore they came to an Agreement, that all those who were for going home and making their Peace, should have the Liber∣ty of doing it, and one of the Ships for that Pur∣pose; and those that had a Mind to stay behind,
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
might remain in the other. Accordingly they put to Sea about <HI>Christmas,</HI> 1722, parted the Com∣pany, and about 150, or more, came in the <HI>Cassandra,</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> they fell in Company with one of our Men of War, and anchored by her three Weeks, till they sent a Message to the Governor of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to whom they offered to surrender if they might have a Pardon for their Lives. The Governor sent back an obliging Answer, but told them, <HI>it was not in his Power to make Terms with them; that they should be very well received, and have their Li∣berty in the Island, till he had an Answer from the Govern∣ment of</HI> England. But this did not satisfy them, they thought his Grace's Civility was no Security against the Letter of the Law; and therefore they weighed in a peaceable Manner, and sailed directly to <HI>Porto Bello.</HI></P>
<P>There was then (as I was told) an Indemnity offer'd on the Part of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> to such Py∣rates as should surrender by a limited Time, where∣of five Weeks, and no more, was yet to come, when they arrived at that Government; and, upon their Application, they were all receiv'd to Mercy.</P>
<P>Here they sat down to spend the Fruits of their dishonest Industry, dividing the Spoil and Plunder of their Fellow-Creatures among themselves, with∣out the least Compunction or Remorse for what they had done; satisfying their Consciences with this Salvo, that other People would have done the same Things, if they had had equal Courage, and the like Opportunities. And, I can't say, but that if they had known what was doing in <HI>England,</HI> at the same Time, by the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Directors, and other Persons, they would certainly have had this Reflection for their Consolation, <HI>viz. That what∣ever Murthers and Robberies they had committed, they were not the greatest Villains that were then living in the World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="150"/>
The Value that was put upon the Spoil at <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> was (if I am rightly inform'd) about three hundred thousand Pound; a considerable Share of which (some say, a fourth Part) the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gover∣nor was complimented with; but, no doubt, had the Cargo been brought to a good Market, it would have produced a far greater Sum, there be∣ing a vast Quantity of Diamonds that came into their Hands in a Way of Dealing, by which they could make no tolerable Judgment of their Value. It is to be consider'd, that the other Part of the Crew which went off from them after they came out of <HI>Delago,</HI> divided with them, and carried away half the Wealth, which, if it had been brought all together into <HI>England,</HI> could not have amounted to less, at a moderate Computation, than a Mil∣lion and half Sterling. But what was squander'd away in the six Years of Action of this Crew, is incredible; also the Ravages and Destruction they constantly made of Merchandizes, which, tho' it stood them in no Stead, was yet of Loss to the Owners, proportionable to their Price; all which we may very well set down at a Million more. A great Sum indeed! and yet the Sum total will shew, that these have been but puny Thieves, when com∣pared to an equal Number within the Bills of Mor∣tality.</P>
<P>What Courses these Fellows may take next, is uncertain, for they do not seem resolved to take up their Habitation there long; and several of them have already left the Country. I know of eight of them, that, upon Pretence of being cast away, ob∣tain'd a Passage in a trading Sloop to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> be∣longing to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; and one of them shipp'd himself at that Island for <HI>London,</HI> and arri∣ved here not many Weeks ago; and others, no doubt, will trip home hereafter in the like Manner.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. OF Captain <HI>Howel Davis,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>CAptain <HI>Howel Davis</HI> was born at <HI>Milford,</HI> in <HI>Monmouthshire,</HI> and was, from a Boy, brought up to the Sea. The last Voyage he made from <HI>England,</HI> was in the <HI>Cadogan</HI> Snow, of <HI>Bristol,</HI> Captain <HI>Skinner</HI> Commander, bound for the Goast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> of which Snow <HI>Davis</HI> was chief Mate: They were no sooner arrived at <HI>Sierraleon</HI> on the aforesaid Coast, but they were taken by the Py∣rate <HI>England,</HI> who plunder'd them, and <HI>Skinner</HI> was barbarously murder'd, as has been related before in the Story of Captain <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>After the Death of Captain <HI>Skinner, Davis</HI> pre∣tended that he was mightily sollicited by <HI>England</HI> to engage with him; but that he resolutely an∣swer'd, he would sooner be shot to Death than sign the Pyrates Articles. Upon which, <HI>England,</HI> plea∣sed with his Bravery, sent him and the rest of the Men again on Board the Snow, appointing him Captain of her, in the Room of <HI>Skinner,</HI> comman∣ding him to pursue his Voyage. He also gave him a written Paper sealed up, with Orders to open it when he should come into a certain Latitude,
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
and at the Peril of his Life follow the Orders there∣in set down. This was an Air of Grandeur like what Princes Practice to their Admirals and Gene∣rals.—It was punctually complied with by <HI>Davis,</HI> who read it to the Ship's Company; it contained no less than a generous Deed of Gift of the Ship and Cargoe, to <HI>Davis</HI> and the Crew, ordering him to go to <HI>Brazil</HI> and dispose of the I ading to the best Advantage, and to make a fair and equal Dividend with the rest.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> proposed to the Crew, whether they were willing to follow their Directions, but to his great Surprize, found the Majority of them altogether averse to it, wherefore in a Rage, he bad them <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> damn'd, and go where they would. They kno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Part of their Cargoe was consigned to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Merchants at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> wherefore there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for that Island. When they arrived, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reated to these Merchants the unfortunate Death of <HI>Skin∣ner,</HI> and the Proposal which had been made to them by <HI>Davis;</HI> upon which, <HI>Davis</HI> was seized and com∣mitted to Prison, where he was kept three Months; however, as he had been in no Act of Pyracy, he was discharged without being brought to any Tryal, yet he could not expect any Employment there; wherefore knowing that the Island of <HI>Providence</HI> was a kind of Rendevouz of Pyrates, he was resolved to make one amongst them, if possible, and to that Purpose, found Means of shipping himself for that Island; but he was again disappointed, for when he arrived there, the Pyrates had newly surren∣dered to Captain <HI>Woods Rogers,</HI> and accepted of the Act of Grace, which he had just brought from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>However, <HI>Davis</HI> was not long out of Business, for Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> having fitted out two Sloops for Trade, one called the <HI>Buck,</HI> the other the <HI>Mum∣vil Trader; Davis</HI> found an Employment on Board
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
of one of them; the Lading of these Sloops was of considerable Value, consisting of <HI>European</HI> Goods, in order to be exchanged with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and many of the Hands on Board of them, were the Pyrates lately come in upon the late Act of Grace. The first Place they touched at, was the Island of <HI>Martinico,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> where <HI>Davis</HI> having conspired with some others, rise in the Night, secured the Master and seized the Sloop; as soon as this was done, they called to the other Sloop, which lay a little Way from them, among whom they knew there were a great many Hands ripe for Rebellion, and ordered them to come on Board of them; they did so, and the greatest Part of them agreed to join with <HI>Davis;</HI> those who were otherwise inclined, were sent back on Board the <HI>Mumvil</HI> Sloop, to go where they pleased, <HI>Davis</HI> having first taken out of her, every Thing which he thought might be of Use.</P>
<P>After this, a Counsel of War was called, over a large Bowl of Punch, at which it was proposed to chuse a Commander; the Election was soon over, for it fell upon <HI>Davis</HI> by a great Majority of <HI>legal Pollers,</HI> there was no Scrutiny demanded, for all acquiesced in the Choice: As soon as he was possess'd of his Command, he drew up Articles, which were signed and sworn to by himself and the rest, then he made a short Speech, the Sum of which, was, a Declaration of War against the whole World.</P>
<P>After this they consulted about a proper Place where they might clean their Sloop, a light Pair of Heels being of great Use either to take, or es∣cape being taken; for this Purpose they made Choice of <HI>Coxon</HI>'s <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,</HI> at the East End of the Island of <HI>Cuba,</HI> a Place where they might secure themselves from Surprize, the Entrance being so narrow, that one Ship might keep out a hundred.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="154"/>
Here they cleaned with much Difficulty, for they had no Carpenter in their Company, a Person of great Use upon such Exigencies; from hence they put to Sea, making to the North-Side of the Island of <HI>Hispaniola.</HI> The first Sail which fell in their Way, was a <HI>French</HI> Ship of twelve Guns; It must be observed, that <HI>Davis</HI> had but thirty five Hands, yet Provisions began to grow short with him; wherefore he attacked this Ship, she soon struck, and he sent twelve of his Hands on Board of her, in order to plunder: This was no sooner done, but a Sail was spied a great Way to Windward of them; they enquired of the <HI>French-</HI>Man what she might be, he answered, that he had spoke with a Ship, the Day before, of twenty four Guns and sixty Men, and he took this to be the same.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> then proposed to his Men to attack her, telling them, she would be a rare Ship for their Use, but they looked upon it to be an extravagant Attempt, and discovered no Fondness for it, but he assured them he had a Stratagem in his Head would make all safe; wherefore he gave Chace, and ordered his Prize to do the same. The Prize being a slow Sailor, <HI>Davis</HI> first came up with the Enemy, and standing along Side of them, shew'd his pyratical Colours: They, much surprized, call'd to <HI>Davis,</HI> telling him, they wondered at his Im∣pudence in venturing to come so near them, and ordered him to strike; but he answered, that he in∣tended to keep them in play, till his Consort came up, who was able to deal with them, and that if they did not strike to him, they should have but bad Quarters; whereupon he gave them a Broad-Side, which they returned.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Prize drew near, who obliged all the Prisoners to come upon Deck in white Shirts, to make a Shew of Force, as they had been directed by <HI>Davis;</HI> they also hoisted a dirty
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
Tarpawlin, by Way of black Flag, they having no other, and fired a Gun: The <HI>French</HI> Men were so intimidated by this Appearance of Force, that they struck. <HI>Davis</HI> called out to the Captain to come on Board of him, with twenty of his Hands; he did so, and they were all for the greater Security clapt into Irons, the Captain excepted: Then he sent four of his own Men on Board the first Prize, and in order still to carry on the Cheat, spoke aloud, that they should give his Service to the Captain, and desire him to send some Hands on Board the Prize, to see what they had got; but at the same Time gave them a written Paper, with Instructions what to do. Here he ordered them to nail up the Guns in the little Prize, to take out all the small Arms and Powder, and to go every Man of them on Board the second Prize; when this was done, he ordered that more of the Prisoners should be removed out of the great Prize, into the little one, by which he secured himself from any At∣tempt which might be feared from their Numbers; for those on Board of him were fast in Irons, and those in the little Prize had neither Arms nor Am∣munition.</P>
<P>Thus the three Ships kept Company for two Days, when finding the great Prize to be a very dull Sai∣lor, he thought she would not be fit for his Pur∣pose, wherefore he resolved to restore her to the Captain, with all his Hands; but first, he took Care to take out all her Ammunition, and every Thing else which he might possibly want. The <HI>French</HI> Captain was in such a Rage, at being so out∣witted, that when he got on Board his own Ship, he was going to throw himself over-board, but was prevented by his Men.</P>
<P>Having let go both his Prizes, he steered North∣ward, in which Course he took a small <HI>Spanish</HI> Sloop; after this, he made towards the <HI>Western</HI> Islands,
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
but met with no Booty thereabouts; then he steered for the <HI>Cape de Verde</HI> Islands, they cast An∣chor at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> hoisting <HI>English</HI> Colours; the <HI>Portuguese</HI> inhabiting there, took him for an <HI>English</HI> Privateer, and <HI>Davis</HI> going ashore, they both treat∣ed him very civilly, and also traded with him. Here he remained five Weeks, in which Time, he and half his Crew, for their Pleasure, took a Jour∣ney to the chief Town of the Island, which was nineteen Miles up the Country: <HI>Davis</HI> making a good Appearance, was caressed by the Governor and the Inhabitants, and no Diversion was wanting which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> could Shew, or Money could Purchase; after about a Weeks Stay, he came back to the Ship, and the rest of the Crew went to take their Pleasure up to the Town, in their Turn.</P>
<P>At their Return they clean'd their Ship, and put to Sea, but not with their whole Company; for five of them, like <HI>Hannibal</HI>'s Men, were so charm'd with the Luxuries of the Place, and the free Con∣versation of some Women, that they staid behind; and one of them, whose Name was <HI>Charles Franklin,</HI> a <HI>Monmouthshire</HI> Man, married and settled himself, and lives there to this Day.</P>
<P>From hence they sailed to <HI>Bonevista,</HI> and looked into that Harbour, but finding nothing, they steer'd for the Isle of <HI>May:</HI> When they arrived here, they met with a great many Ships and Vessels in the Road, all which they plunder'd, taking out of them whatever they wanted; and also strengthen'd them∣selves with a great many fresh Hands, who most of them enter'd voluntarily. One of the Ships they took to their own Use, mounted her with twenty six Guns, and call'd her the <HI>King James.</HI> There be∣ing no fresh Water hereabouts, they made towards St. <HI>Jago,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> in order to lay in a Store; <HI>Davis,</HI> with a few Hands, going ashore to find the most commodious Place to water at, the
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
Governor, with some Attendants, came himself and examined who they were, and whence they came? and not liking <HI>Davis</HI>'s Account of himself, the Gover∣nor was so plain to tell them, he suspected them to be Pyrates. <HI>Davis</HI> seem'd mightily affronted, stan∣ding much upon his Honour, replying to the Gover∣nor he scorn'd his Words; however, as soon as his Back was turn'd, for fear of Accidents, he got on Board again as fast as he could. <HI>Davis</HI> related what had happen'd, and his Men seem'd to resent the Af∣front which had been offer'd him. <HI>Davis,</HI> upon this, told them, he was confident he could surprize the Fort in the Night; they agreed with him to attempt it, and accordingly, when it grew late, they went ashore well arm'd; and the Guard which was kept, was so negligent, that they got within the Fort before any Alarm was given: When it was too late there was some little Resistance made, and three Men kill'd on <HI>Davis</HI>'s Side. Those in the Fort, in their Hur∣ry, run into the Governor's House to save them∣selves, which they barricaded so strongly, that <HI>Da∣vis</HI>'s Party could not enter it; however, they threw in Granadoe-Shells, which not only ruin'd all the Furniture, but kill'd several Men within.</P>
<P>When it was Day the whole Country was alarm'd, and came to attack the Pyrates; wherefore it not being their Business to stand a Siege, they made the best of their Way on Board their Ship again, after having dismounted the Guns of the Fort. By this Enterprize they did a great Deal of Mischief to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and but very little Good to them∣selves.</P>
<P>Having put to Sea they muster'd their Hands, and found themselves near seventy strong; then it was proposed what Course they should steer, and differing in their Opinions, they divided, and by a Majority it was carried for <HI>Gambia</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney;</HI> of this Opinion was <HI>Davis,</HI> he having been
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
employ'd in that Trade, was acquainted with the Coast: He told them, that there was a great Deal of Money always kept in <HI>Gambia</HI> Castle, and that it would be worth their while to make an Attempt upon it. They ask'd him how it was possible, since it was garrison'd? He desir'd they would leave the Management of it to him, and he would undertake to make them Masters of it. They began now to conceive so high an Opinion of his Conduct, as well as Courage, that they thought nothing impossible to him, therefore they agreed to obey him, without enquiring further into his Design.</P>
<P>Having come within Sight of the Place, he or∣der'd all his Men under Deck, except as many as were absolutely necessary for working the Ship, that those from the Fort seeing a Ship with so few Hands, might have no Suspicion of her being any other than a trading Vessel; then he ran close un∣der the Fort, and there cast Anchor, and having ordered out the Boat, he commanded six Men in her, in old ordinary Jackets, while he himself, with the Master and Doctor, dressed themselves like Gentlemen; his Design being, that the Men should look like common Sailors, and they like Merchants. In rowing ashore he gave his Men Instructions what to say in Case any Questions should be ask∣ed them.</P>
<P>Being come to the landing Place, he was recei∣ved by a File of Musqueteers, and conducted into the Fort, where the Governor accosting them civil∣ly, ask'd them who they were, and whence they came? They answered they were of <HI>Liverpool,</HI> bound for the River of <HI>Sinnegal,</HI> to trade for Gum and Elephant's Teeth, but that they were chaced on that Coast by two <HI>French</HI> Men of War, and nar∣rowly escaped being taken, having a little the Heels of them; but now they were resolved to make the best of a bad Market, and would Trade
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
here for Slaves; then the Governor ask'd them, what was the Chief of their Cargoe? They answer∣ed, Iron and Plate, which were good Things there; The Governor told them he would Slave them to the full Value of their Cargoe, and ask'd them, if they had any <HI>European</HI> Liquor on Board? they answered, a little for their own Use; how∣ever, a Hamper should be at his Service. The Go∣vernor then very civilly invited them all to stay and dine with him; <HI>Davis</HI> told him, that being Commander of the Ship, he must go on Board to see her well moored, and give some other Orders, but those two Gentlemen might stay, and that he himself would also return before Dinner, and bring the Hamper of Liquor with him.</P>
<P>While he was in the Fort, his Eyes were very busy in observing how Things lay; he took Notice there was a Sentry at the Entrance, and a Guard-House just by it, where the Soldiers upon Duty commonly waited, their Arms standing in a Cor∣ner, in a Heap; he saw also a great many small Arms in the Governor's Hall; now when he came on Board, he assured his Men of Success, desiring them not to get drunk, and that as soon as they saw the Flag upon the Castle struck, they might conclude he was Master, and send twenty Hands immediately ashore; in the mean Time, there being a Sloop at Anchor near them, he sent some Hands in a Boat, to secure the Master and all the Men, and bring them on Board of him, least they observing any Bustle, or arming in his Ship, might send ashore and give Intelligence.</P>
<P>These Precautions being taken, he ordered his Men, who were to go in the Boat with him, to put two Pair of Pistols each under their Cloaths, he doing the like himself, and gave them Directions to go into the Guard-Room, and to enter into Conversation with the Soldiers, and observe when
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
he should fire a Pistol thro' the Governor's Win∣dow, to start up at once and secure the Arms in the Guard-Room.</P>
<P>When <HI>Davis</HI> arrived, Dinner not being ready, the Governor proposed that they should pass their Time in making a Bowl of Punch till Dinner-Time: It must be observed, that <HI>Davis</HI>'s Coxon waited upon them, who had an Opportunity of going about all Parts of the House, to see what Strength they had, he whispered <HI>Davis,</HI> there being no Person then in the Room, but he <HI>(Davis)</HI> the Ma∣ster, the Doctor, the Coxon, and Governor; <HI>Davis</HI> on a sudden drew out a Pistol, clapt it to the Go∣vernor's Breast, telling him he must Surrender the Fort and all the Riches in it, or he was a dead Man. The Governor being no Ways prepared for such an Attack, promised to be very Passive, and do all they desired, wherefore they shut the Door, took down all the Arms that hung in the Hall, and loaded them. <HI>Davis</HI> fires his Pistol thro' the Window, upon which his Men without, executed their Part of the Scheme, like Heroes, in an instant; getting betwixt the Soldiers and their Arms, all with their Pistols cock'd in their Hands, while one of them carried the Arms out. When this was done, they locked the Soldiers into the Guard-Room, and kept Guard without.</P>
<P>In the mean Time one of them struck the Union Flag on the Top of the Castle, at which Signal those on Board sent on Shore a Reinforcement of Hands, and they got Possession of the Fort with∣out the least Hurry or Confusion, or so much as a Man lost of either Side.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> harangued the Soldiers, upon which a great many of them took on with him, those who refused, he sent on Board the little Sloop, and because he would not be at the trouble of a Guard for them, he ordered all the Sails and Cables
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
out of her, which might hinder them from attempt∣ing to get away.</P>
<P>This Day was spent in a kind of Rejoycing, the Castle firing her Guns to salute the Ship, and the Ship the Castle; but the next Day they minded their Business, that is, they fell to plundering, but they found Things fall vastly short of their Ex∣pectation; for they discover'd, that a great deal of Money had been lately sent away; however, they met with the Value of about two thousand Pounds Sterling in Bar Gold, and a great many other rich Effects: Every Thing they liked, which was por∣table, they brought aboard their Ship; some Things which they had no Use for, they were so generous to make a Present of, to the Master and Crew of the little Sloop, to whom they also returned his Vessel again, and then they fell to work in dismounting the Guns, and demolishing the Fortifications.</P>
<P>After they had done as much Mischief as they could, and were weighing Anchor to be gone, they spy'd a Ship bearing down upon them in full Sail; they soon got their Anchors up, and were in a Readiness to receive her. This Ship prov'd to be a <HI>French</HI> Pyrate of fourteen Guns, and sixty four Hands, half <HI>French,</HI> half Negroes; the Captain's Name was <HI>La Bouse;</HI> he expected no less than a rich Prize, which made him so eager in the Chace; but when he came near enough to see their Guns, and the Number of their Hands upon Deck, he began to think he should catch a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and supposed her to be a small <HI>English</HI> Man of War; however, since there was no escaping, he resolv'd to do a bold and desperate Action, which was to board <HI>Davis.</HI> As he was making towards her for this Purpose, he fir'd a Gun, and hoisted his black Colours; <HI>Davis</HI> re∣turn'd the Salute, and hoisted his black Colours also. The <HI>Frenchman</HI> was not a little pleas'd at this happy Mistake; they both hoisted out their Boats,
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
and the Captains went to meet and congratulate one another with a Flag of Truce in their Sterns; a great many Civilities passed between them, and <HI>La Bouse</HI> desired <HI>Davis,</HI> that they might sail down the Coast together, that he <HI>(La Bouse)</HI> might get a better Ship: <HI>Davis</HI> agreed to it, and very cour∣teously promised him the first Ship he took, fit for their Use, he would give him, as being willing to encourage a younger Brother.</P>
<P>The first Place they touch'd at, was <HI>Sierraleone,</HI> where at first going in, they spied a tall Ship at Anchor; <HI>Davis</HI> being the best Sailor first came up with her, and wondering that she did not try to make off, suspected her to be a Ship of Force. As soon as he came along Side of her, she brought a Spring upon her Cable, and fired a whole Broad-side upon <HI>Davis,</HI> at the same Time hoisting a black Flag; <HI>Davis</HI> hoisted his black Flag in like Manner, and fired one Gun to Leeward.</P>
<P>In fine, she proved to be a Pyrate Ship of twenty four Guns, commanded by one <HI>Cocklyn,</HI> who expect∣ing these two would prove Prizes, let them come in, least his getting under Sail might frighten them away.</P>
<P>The Satisfaction was great on all Sides, at this Junction of Confederates and Brethren in Iniquity; two Days they spent in improving their Acquain-and Friendship, the third Day <HI>Davis</HI> and <HI>Cocklin,</HI> agreed to go in <HI>La Bouse</HI>'s Brigantine, and attack the Fort, they contrived it so, as to get up thither by high Water; those in the Fort suspected them to be what they really were, and therefore stood upon their Defence; when the Brigantine came within Musket-Shot, the Fort fired all their Guns upon her, the Brigantine did the like upon the Fort, and so held each other in Play, for several Hours, when the two confederate Ships were come up to the Assistance of the Brigantine; those who
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
defended the Fort, seeing such a Number of Hands on Board these Ships, had not the Courage to stand it any longer, but abandoning the Fort, left it to the Mercy of the Pyrates.</P>
<P>They took Possession of it, and continued there near seven Weeks, in which Time they all cleaned their Ships; we should have observed that a Galley came into the Road while they were there, which <HI>Davis</HI> insisted should be yeilded to <HI>La Bouse,</HI> accor∣ding to his Word of Honour before given; <HI>Cock∣lin</HI> did not oppose it, so <HI>La Bouse</HI> went into her, with his Crew, and cutting away her half Deck, mounted her with twenty four Guns.</P>
<P>Having called a Counsel of War, they agreed to sail down the Coast together, and for the greater Grandeur, appointed a Commadore, which was <HI>Davis;</HI> but they had not kept Company long, when drinking together on Board of <HI>Davis,</HI> they had like to have fallen together by the Ears, the strong Liquor stired up a Spirit of Discord among them, and they quarrelled, but <HI>Davis</HI> put an End to it by this short Speech:<HI>—Hearkee you</HI> Cock∣lin, <HI>and</HI> La Bouse, <HI>I find by strength'ning you, I have put a Red into your Hands to whip my self, but I'm still able to deal with you both; but since we met in Love, let us part in Love, for I find that three of a Trade can never agree.—</HI>Upon which the other two went on Board their respective Ships, and immediately parted, each steering a different Course.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> held on his Way down the Coast, and making Cape <HI>Appollonia,</HI> he met with two <HI>Scotch</HI> and one <HI>English</HI> Vessel, which he plundered, and then let go. About five Days after he fell in with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Interloper of thirty Guns and ninety Men, (half being <HI>English,)</HI> off Cape <HI>Three Points</HI> Bay; <HI>Davis</HI> com∣ing up along Side of her, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man gave the first Fire, and pouring in a Broad-Side upon <HI>Davis,</HI> Liked nine of his Men, <HI>Davis</HI> returned it, and a
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
very hot Engagement followed, which lasted from one a Clock at Noon, till nine next Morning, when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man struck, and yeilded her self their Prize.</P>
<P><HI>Davis</HI> fitted up the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship for his own Use, and called her the <HI>Rover,</HI> aboard of which he mounted thirty two Guns, and twenty seven Swi∣vels, and proceeded with her and the <HI>King James,</HI> to <HI>Anamboe;</HI> he enter'd the Bay betwixt the Hours of twelve and one at Noon, and found there three Ships lying at Anchor, who were trading for Ne∣groes, Gold and Teeth: The Names of these Ships were the <HI>Hind</HI> Pink, Captain <HI>Hall</HI> Commander, the <HI>Princess,</HI> Captain <HI>Plumb,</HI> of which <HI>Roberts,</HI> who will make a considerable Figure in the sequel of this History, was second Mate, and the <HI>Morrice</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Fin;</HI> he takes these Ships without any Re∣sistance, and having plundered them, he makes a Present of one of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Morrice</HI> Sloop, to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Men, on Board of which alone were found a hundred and forty Negroes, besides dry Goods, and a considerable Quantity of Gold-Dust.</P>
<P>It happened there were several Canoes along Side of this last, when <HI>Davis</HI> came in, who saved them∣selves and got ashore; these gave Notice at the Fort, that these Ships were Pyrates, upon which, the Fort fired upon them, but without any Exe∣cution, for their Mettle was not of Weight enough to reach them; <HI>Davis</HI> therefore, by Way of Defiance, hoisted his black Flag, and returned their Com∣pliment.</P>
<P>The same Day he sailed with his three Ships, making his Way down the Coast; at Night he lay by, with his Head to the Offin, and early in the Morn∣ing the Man at the Mast-Head spied a Sail. It must be observed they keep a good Look-out; for, according to their Articles, he who first spies a Sail, if she proves a Prize, is intitled to the best
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
Pair of Pistols on Board, over and above his Divi∣dend, in which they take singular Pride; and a Pair of Pistols has sometimes been sold for thirty Pounds, from one to another.</P>
<P>Immediately they gave Chace, and soon came up with her; the Ship proved to be a <HI>Hollander,</HI> and being betwixt <HI>Davis</HI> and the Shore, she made all the Sail she could, intending to run aground; <HI>Davis</HI> guessed her Design, and putting out all his small Sails, came up with her before she could effect it, and fired a Broad-side upon her, upon which she immediately struck, and called for Quarter. It was granted, for according to <HI>Davis</HI>'s Articles it was a∣greed that Quarter should be given, when ever it was called for, upon Pain of Death.</P>
<P>This Ship proved a very rich Prize, having the Governor of <HI>Acra</HI> on Board, with all his Effects, go∣ing to <HI>Holland;</HI> there was in Money to the Value of 15000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, besides other valuable Merchan∣dizes, all which they brought on Board of themselves.</P>
<P>Upon this new Success, they restored Captain <HI>Hall</HI> and Captain <HI>Plumb</HI> before mentioned, their Ships again, but strengthened their Company with thirty five Hands, all white Men, taken out of these two and the <HI>Morrice</HI> Sloop; they also restored the <HI>Dutch</HI> their Ship, after having plunder'd her as is mention'd.</P>
<P>The next Course they steered, was towards the Island of <HI>Princes;</HI> before they got thither, one of their Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> that call'd the <HI>King James,</HI> sprung a Leak; <HI>Davis</HI> ordered all Hands out of her, on Board his own Ship, with every Thing else of Use, and left her at an Anchor at high <HI>Cameroon.</HI> As soon as he came in Sight of the Island of <HI>Princes,</HI> he hoisted <HI>English</HI> Colours; the <HI>Portuguese</HI> observing a large Ship sail∣ing towards them, sent out a little Sloop to examine what she might be; this Sloop hailing of <HI>Davis,</HI> he told them he was an <HI>English</HI> Man of War, in quest of Pyrates, and that he had received Intelligence
<PB N="159" REF="166"/>
there were some upon that Coast; upon this they received him as a welcome Guest, and piloted him into the Harbour. He saluted the Fort, which they answered, and he came to an Anchor just under their Guns, and hoisted out the Pinnace Man of War Fashion, ordering nine Hands and a Coxon in it, to row him ashore.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> to do him the greater Honour, sent down a File of Musqueteers to receive him, and conduct him to the Governor. The Governor not in the least suspecting what he was, received him very civilly, promising to supply him with whatever the Island afforded; <HI>Davis</HI> thanked him, telling him, the King of <HI>England</HI> would pay for what∣ever he should take; so after several Civilities pass'd between him and the Governor, he returned again on Board.</P>
<P>It happened a <HI>French</HI> Ship came in there to supply it self with some Necessaries, which <HI>Davis</HI> took in∣to his Head to plunder, but to give the Thing a Colour of Right, he persuaded the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> that she had been trading with the Pyrates, and that he found several Pyrate's Goods on Board, which he seized for the King's Use: This Story passed so well upon the Governor, that he commended <HI>Davis</HI>'s Diligence.</P>
<P>A few Days after, <HI>Davis</HI> with about fourteen more, went privately ashore, and walk'd up the Country towards a Village, where the Governor and the other chief Men of the Island kept their Wives, in∣tending, as we may suppose, to supply their Hus∣band's Places with them; but being discovered, the Women fled to a neighbouring Wood, and <HI>Davis</HI> and the rest retreated to their Ship, without effecting their Design: The Thing made some Noise, but as No-body knew them, it passed over.</P>
<P>Having cleaned his Ship, and put all Things in Order, his Thoughts now were turned upon the
<PB N="160" REF="167"/>
main Business, <HI>viz.</HI> the Plunder of the Island, and not knowing where the Treasure lay, a Stratagem came into his Head, to get it (as he thought) with little Trouble; he consulted his Men upon it, and they liked the Design: His Scheme was, to make a Present to the Governor, of a dozen Negroes, by Way of Return for the Civilities received from him, and afterwards to invite him, with the chief Men, and some of the Friers, on Board his Ship to an En∣tertainment; the Minute they came on Board, they were to be secured in Irons, and there kept till they should pay a Ransom of 40000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling.</P>
<P>But this Stratagem proved fatal to him, for a <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Negroe swam ashore in the Night, and disco∣vered the whole Plot to the Governor, and also let him know, that it was <HI>Davis</HI> who had made the At∣tempt upon their Wives. However, the Governor dissembled, received the Pyrate's Invitation civily, and promised that he and the rest would go.</P>
<P>The next Day <HI>Davis</HI> went on Shore himself, as if it were out of greater Respect to bring the Gover∣nor on Board: He was received with the usual Ci∣vility, and he and his Officers desired to walk up to the Governor's House, to take some Refreshment before they went on Board; they accepted it with∣out the least Suspicion, but never returned again; for an Ambuscade was laid for them, a Signal being given, a whole Volley was fired upon them; they every Man drop'd, except one, this one fled back and escaped into the Boat, and got on Board the Ship: <HI>Davis</HI> was shot through the Bowels, yet he rise again, and made a weak Effort to get away, but his Strength soon for sook him, and he drop'd down dead; just as he fell, he perceived he was followed, and drawing out his Pistols, fired them at his Pursuers: Thus like a game Cock, giving a dy∣ing Blow, that he might not fall unrevenged.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. OF Captain <HI>Bartho. Roberts.</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DAvis</HI> being cut off, in the manner before mentioned, the Company was under a Ne∣cessity of filling up his Post, and <HI>Roberts</HI> had behaved so well before this Accident, (tho' he had not been above six Weeks among them,) that he was by a great Majority elected Captain; and he would often after this, say in excuse of it, <HI>That since he had dipped his Hands in muddy Water, and must be a Pyrate, it was better being a Commander than a common Man.</HI></P>
<P>His first Indignation shew'd it self against those Islanders, in Revenge for Captain <HI>Davis</HI>'s Death, who being well beloved by the Company, he thought he could do nothing more grateful to them, than to punish the Authors of it, and which would at the same Time possess them with an Opinion of his own Courage: Whereupon he im∣mediately landed a Party of about thirty Men, to make an Attack upon the Fort. This had been a dangerous Enterprize, had it been garrisoned by any other People than <HI>Portuguese;</HI> for the Fort stood upon a Rock, close to the Water-Side,
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
which must be ascended to by a steep Hill, against the Mouth of the Cannon. <HI>Roberts</HI> and his Men were no wit daunted, having conceived the utmost Contempt of the Courage of that Nation, and therefore march'd boldly up to the Fort, and found himself not mistaken; for as soon as the <HI>Portuguese</HI> had discerned their Enemy, they dis∣charged the Guns that were loaded, and forsook their Post, and the Pyrates marched in without further Opposition. The Fort being abandoned, there was nothing more to do, but to Nail up the Cannon, and throw them over the Wall into the Sea, which after they had done, they retrea∣ted to their Ship, without any Loss.</P>
<P>But this was not look'd upon as a sufficient Sa∣tisfaction for the Injury they received, therefore most of the Company were for burning the Town, which <HI>Roberts</HI> said he would yield to, if any means could be proposed of doing it without their own Destruction, for the Town had a securer Scituation than the Fort, a thick Wood coming almost close to it, affording Cover to the Defendants, who under such an Advantage, he told them, it was to be fear'd, would fire and stand better to their Arms; besides, that bare Houses would be but a slender Reward for their Trouble and Loss. This prudent Advice prevailed, and they contented themselves with bringing a Spring on their Cable, and ta∣king leave with a few Balls, which did no great Damage.</P>
<P>The next Day they weighed, and went to Sea, and then put it to the Vote, what Voyage they should take, which they unanimously concurr'd in, should be to try their Fortunes on the Coast of <HI>Brasil.</HI> They made the best of their Way thither, and nothing remarkable happening in the Voyage, I shall take no Notice of them till their Arrival off of <HI>Bahia,</HI> the richest
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
and most populous Place of all the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Co∣lonies, and where the greatest Trade is carried on.</P>
<P>The Rovers came off the Bay betimes in the Morning, and fell in with a Fleet of 40 Sail of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships, with all their Lading for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> who lay too, waiting for their Convoy; which were two Men of War of 70 Guns each, besides several of the Merchant Ships were of good Force. However, <HI>Roberts</HI> thought it should go hard with him, but he would make up his Market among them, and thereupon mix'd with the Fleet, and kept his Men hid till proper Resolutions could be formed; that done, they came close up to one of them, and ordered her to send the Master on Board quietly, threatning to give them no Quarters, if any Resistance, or Signal of Distress, was made. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> being surprized at these Threats, and the sudden Flourish of Cut∣lashes from the Pyrates, submitted without a Word, and the Captain came on Board; <HI>Roberts</HI> saluted him after a friendly manner, telling him, that they were Gentlemen of Fortune, but that their Business with him, was only to be informed which was the richest Ship in that Fleet; and if he directed them right, he should be restored to his Ship without Molestation, otherwise, he must expect nothing but immediate Death.</P>
<P>Whereupon this <HI>Portuguese</HI> Master pointed to one of 40 Guns, and 150 Men, wearing a Vice-Admiral's Flag, which was of far greater Force than <HI>Robert</HI>'s Ship, but this no Ways dismayed them, <HI>they were</HI> Portuguese, they said, and so imme∣diately steered away for him. When they came within Hail, the Master whom they had Prisoner, was ordered to ask, <HI>how Seignior Capitain did?</HI> And to invite him on Board, for that he had a Matter of Consequence to impart to him, which being done, he returned for Answer, <HI>That he would wait upon him</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="171"/>
<HI>Presently:</HI> But the Bustle that immediately followed, and which the Pyrates perceived, gave them Suspi∣cion, that they were discovered, and this only a deceitful Answer to gain Time to put their Ship in a Posture of Defence; so without further Delay, they poured in a Broad-Side, boarded and grapled her; the Dispute was short and warm, wherein many of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> fell, and two only of the Pyrates. By this Time the Fleet was a∣larmed, Signals of Top-gallant Sheets flying, and Guns fired, to give Notice to the Men of War, who rid still at an Anchor, but now hastened out to their Assistance; and if what the Pyrates themselves related, be true, the Commanders of those Ships were blamable to the highest Degree, and unworthy the Name of Men: For <HI>Roberts</HI> finding the Prize to sail heavy, and was yet resolved not to loose her, lay by for the head∣most of them (which much out sail'd the other) and prepared for Battle, which was ignominiously declined, tho' of such superior Force; for not da∣ring to venture on the Pyrate alone, he tarried so long for his Consor as gave them time leisurely to make off with the Prize.</P>
<P>They found this Ship exceeding rich, being la∣den chiefly with Sugar, Skins, and Tobacco, and in Gold 90000 Moidors, besides Chains and Trin∣ckets, of considerable Value; particularly a Cross set with Diamonds, designed for the King of <HI>Por∣tugal;</HI> which they afterwards presented to the Governor of <HI>Caiana,</HI> by whom they were obliged.</P>
<P>Elated with this Booty, they had nothing now to think of but some safe Retreat, where they might give themselves up to all the Pleasures that Luxury and Wantonness could bestow, and for the present pitch'd upon a Place call'd the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>Islands,</HI> in the River of <HI>Surinam,</HI> on the Coast of
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
<HI>Caiana,</HI> where they arrived, and found the civilest Reception imaginable, not only from the Gover∣nor and Factory, but their Wives, who exchang∣ed Wares and drove a considerable Trade with them.</P>
<P>They seized in this River a Sloop, and by her gained Intelligence, that a Brigantine had also sailed in Company with her, from <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> laden with Provisions for the Coast. A Welcome Cargo! They growing short in the Sea Store, and as <HI>Sancho</HI> says, <HI>No Adventures to be made without Belly-Timber.</HI> One Evening as they were rumaging (their Mine of Treasure,) the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Prize, this expect∣ed Vessel was descry'd at Mast-Head, and <HI>Roberts,</HI> ima∣gining no Body could do Business so well as himself, takes 40 Men into the Sloop, and goes in pursuit of her; but a fatal Accident followed this rash, tho' inconsiderable Adventure, for <HI>Roberts</HI> thinking of nothing less than bringing in the Brigantine that Afternoon, never troubled his Head about the Sloop's Provision, nor inquired what there was on Board to subsist such a Number of Men; but out he sails after his expected Prize, which he not only lost further Sight of, but after eight Days contending with contrary Winds and Currents, found themselves thirty Leagues to Leeward, and almost famished. The Current still opposing their Endeavours, and perceiving no Hopes of beating up to their Ship, they inconsiderately sent away the Boat to give the rest of the Company Notice of their Condition, and to order the Ship down to them; in the mean while they brought the Sloop to an Anchor, but now their Wants too soon made them sensible of their Infatuation, for their Water was all gone, and they had no thought how they should be supply'd, till either the Ship came to 'em, or the Boat returned, which was not likely to be under five or six Days. Here like
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
<HI>Tantalus,</HI> they almost famished in Sight of the fresh Streams and Lakes, being drove to such Ex∣tremity at last, that they were forc'd to tare up the Floor of the Cabin, and patch up a sort of a Tub or Tray with Rope Yarns, to paddle ashore, and fetch off immediate Supplies of Water to pre∣serve Life.</P>
<P>After some Days, the long-wish'd-for Boat came back, but with the most unwellcome News in the World to them, for one <HI>Kennedy,</HI> who was Lieute∣nant, and left in Absence of <HI>Roberts,</HI> to Command the Privateer and Prize, was gone off with both. This was Mortification with a Vengance, and you may imagine, they did not depart without some hard Speeches from those that were left, and had suf∣fered by their Treachery. And that there need be no further mention of this <HI>Kennedy,</HI> I shall leave Captain <HI>Roberts,</HI> for a Page or two, with the Re∣mains of his Crew, to vent their Wrath in a few Oaths and Execrations, and follow the other, whom we may reckon was steering his Course to∣wards <HI>Execution Deck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kennedy</HI> and those with him went into the Latitude of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and took three or four small Vessels, and as they did not design to pursue <HI>the Account,</HI> (as they called it) any longer, they shared the Booty, which came to a good round Sum to each Man, and parted, in order to shift for themselves, in the several Vessels they had taken: Nine of them met with a Ship of 150 Tun, that shall be nameless, and came home to <HI>England</HI> in her; the Master was paid well for their Passage, and the rest of the Crew liv'd ne'er the worse in the Voy∣age; in short, they landed safely in the West of <HI>England,</HI> and two or three of them live at this Time within a hundred Miles of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>Another Vessel, belonging to this Gang, fell in with a peaceable Ship belonging to <HI>Virginia</HI> Cap∣tain
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
<HI>Knot</HI> Commander, a Quaker, who had neither Pistol, Sword, nor Cutlash on Board; and the Cap∣tain himself, appearing so very Passive at all they said to him, that they thought none so pro∣per to go off with, as this Man. Accordingly they went aboard, and he carried them to <HI>Virginia:</HI> They made the Quaker a Present of 10 Chests of Sugar, 10 Rolls of <HI>Brasil</HI> Tobaco, 30 Moidors, and some Gold-Dust, in all to the Value of about 250 l. They also made Presents to the Sailors, some more, some less, and liv'd a jovial Life all the while they were upon their Voy∣age; and Captain <HI>Knot</HI> gave them their Way, letting them do as they pleased, nor indeed could he help himself, unless he had taken an Opportu∣nity to surprize them, when they were drunk or a sleep; for they wore Arms aboard the Ship, which put him in a continual Terror. It not being his Principle to fight, or use Weapons, he was obliged to manage them with Art and Address, till he could rid himself of such troublesome Guests. When the Ship came to the Capes, four of the Py∣rates went off in a Boat, which they had taken with them, for their more easily making their Escapes, and made up the Bay towards <HI>Maryland,</HI> but were forced back by a Storm into an obscure Place of the Country, where meeting with good Entertainment among the Planters, they continued several Days without being discovered to be Py∣rates. In the mean Time Captain <HI>Knot</HI> leaving four others on Board his Ship, (who intended to go off to <HI>North-Carolina,)</HI> made what hast he could to discover to Mr. <HI>Spotswood</HI> the Governor, what sort of Passengers he had been forced to bring with him, who by good Fortune got them seized; and Search being made after the others, who were revelling about the Country, they were also taken; and being try'd, they were all convicted
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
and hanged. The latter had found Means to lodge Part of their Wealth with the Planters, who never brought it to Account: But Captain <HI>Knot,</HI> surrender'd up every Thing that belonged to them, that were taken aboard, even what had been pre∣sented to him, in lieu of what they had from him, in their Passage, and obliged his Men to do the like.</P>
<P><HI>Kennedy</HI> himself, with five or six more, came safe to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and from thence to <HI>England,</HI> and liv'd here undiscovered some Time, and perhaps had done so still, had not his Sister, out of mere Malice, (provoked thereto by a Quarrel,) given an Information against him. Two or three others were inform'd against, at the same Time, and, for ought I know, by the same Person; and they were committed to <HI>Newgate:</HI> One was made an Evidence, and two, <HI>viz. Walter Kennedy</HI> and <HI>James Bradshaw,</HI> were try'd and convicted at the <HI>Old Bay∣ly,</HI> by a High Court of Admiralty, <HI>July</HI> 3d, 1721. <HI>Bradshaw</HI> was transported, but <HI>Kennedy,</HI> received the full Punishment due to his Crimes, the 19th of the said Month, at <HI>Execution-Dock.</HI> One <HI>Estwell</HI> was try'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> but had the good Fortune to evade the Law, for want of Proof: And four others were found Guilty, and executed near St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s<HI>-Green,</HI> in <HI>Dublin,</HI> about the same Time.</P>
<P>Thus we see what a disastrious Fate, ever at∣tends the Wicked, and how rarely they escape the Punishment due to their Crimes, who abandon themselves to such a profligate Life, as to rob, spoil, and prey upon Mankind, contrary to the Light and Law of Nature, as well as the Law of God. 'Tis to be hoped that the Examples of these Deaths, may stand like Marks, or fatal Rocks and Sands, to warn others from the same Shipwreck and Ruin for the Future. And that the few of
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
this Gang, who are yet preserved from that Punish∣ment, which the Law hath equally subjected them to, with the rest, will make so good Use of their Time, as not only sincerely to resolve never to commit the like Facts again, but to actually re∣pent of what they have already done, to have a hearty Sorrow, arising from the Consideration of having, by those Crimes, so much offended God.</P>
<P>But, to go back to <HI>Roberts,</HI> whom we left on the Coast of <HI>Caiana,</HI> in a grievous Passion at what <HI>Kennedy</HI> and the Crew had done; and who was now projecting new Adventures with his small Compa∣ny, in the Sloop; but finding hitherto they had been but as a Rope of Sand, they formed a Set of Articles, to be sign'd and sworn to, for the better Conser∣vation of their Society, and doing Justice to one another; excluding all <HI>Irish-men</HI> from the Benefit of it, to whom they had an implacable Aversion for the sake of <HI>Kennedy,</HI> who had so little Honour as to play at <HI>Rob Thief</HI> with the Company. How indeed <HI>Roberts</HI> could think that an Oath would be obligatory, where Defiance had been given to the Laws of God and Man, I can't tell, but their greatest Security lay in this, <HI>That it was their In∣terest to observe them while they kept in that abominable Combination.</HI></P>

<DIV3>
<P>These we are assured were some of <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Articles, but as they had taken Care to throw over-board the Original they had sign'd and Sworn to, there is a great deal of Room to sus∣pect, the remainder contained something too hor∣rid to be disclosed to any, except such as were wil∣ling to be Sharers in the Iniquity of them; let them be what they will, they were together the Test of all new Comers, who were initiated by an Oath, and who subscribed to them, in Presence of the wor∣shipful Mr. <HI>Roberts.</HI> And in Case any Doubt should arise concerning the Construction of these Laws, and it should remain a Dispute whether the Party had infring'd them or no, a Jury is appointed to ex∣plain them, and bring in a Verdict upon the Case in doubt.</P>
<P>Since we are now speaking of the Laws of this Company, we shall go on, and, in as brief a man∣ner as we can, relate the principal Customs, and Government, of this roguish Common-Wealth; which are pretty near the same with all Pyrates, there not being any material Difference between, them in these Cases.</P>
<P>For the Punishment of small Offences, which are not provided for by the Articles, and which are not of Consequence enough to be left to a Jury, there is a principal Officer among the Pyrates, called the Quarter-Master, of the Mens own chu∣sing, who claims all Authority this Way, (except∣ing
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
in Time of Battle:) If they disobey his Com∣mand, are quarrelsome and mutinous with one ano∣ther, misuse Prisoners, plunder beyond his Order, and in particular, if they be negligent of their Arms, which he musters at Discretion, he pu∣nishes at his own Discretion, with drubbing or whipping, which no one else dare do without in∣curring the Lash from all the Ships Company. In short, this Officer is Trustee for the whole, is the first on Board any Prize, separating, for the Company's Use, what he pleases, and returning what he thinks sit to the Owners, excepting Gold and Silver, which they have voted not returnable.</P>
<P>After a Description of the Quarter-Master, and his Duty, who acts as a sort of a civil Magistrate on Board a Pyrate Ship; I shall consider their mi∣litary Officer, the Captain; what Privileges he ex∣erts in such anarchy and unrulyness of the Mem∣bers: Why truly very little, they only permit him to be Captain on Condition that they may be Captain over him; they separate to his Use the great Cabbin, and sometimes Vote him small parcels of Plate and China; but then every Man as the Hu∣mour takes him, will use the Plate and China, intrude into his Apartment, swear at him, seize a Part of his Victuals and Drink, if they like it, without his offering to find Fault or Contest it: Yet <HI>Roberts</HI> by a better Management than usual, became the cheif Director in every Thing of Moment, and it hap∣pened thus:—The rank of Captain being ob∣tained by the Suffrage of the Majority, it falls on one Superior for Knowledge and Boldness, <HI>Pi∣stol Proof</HI> (as they call it,) and can make those fear, who do not love him; <HI>Roberts</HI> is said to have exceeded his Fellows in these Respects, and when advanced, enlarged the Respect that follow∣ed it, by making a sort of Privy-Council of half a Dozen of the greatest Bullies; such were his
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
Conpetitors, and had Interest enough to make his Government easy; yet even those, in the latter Part of his Reign, he had ran counter to in every Project that opposed his own Opinion; for which, and because he grew reserved, and would not drink and roar at their Rate, a Cabal was formed to take away his Captainship, which Death did more effectually.</P>
<P>The Captain's Power is uncontroulable in Chase, or in Battle; drubing, cutting, or even shooting any one who dares deny his Command. The same Privi∣ledge he takes over Prisoners, who receive good or ill Usage, mostly as he approves of their Behaviour, for tho' the meanest would take upon them to misuse a Master of a Ship, yet he would controul herein, when he see it, and merrily over a Bottle, give his Prisoners this double Reason for it. First, That it preserved his Precedency; and secondly, That it took the Punishment out of the Hands of a much more rash and mad Set of Fellows than himself. When he found that Ri∣gour was not expected from his People, (for he often practised it to appease them,) then he would give Strangers to understand, that it was pure Inclination that induced him to a good Treatment of them, and not any Love or Partiality to their Persons; <HI>for,</HI> says he, <HI>there is none of you but will hang me, I know, whenever you can clinch me with∣in your Power.</HI></P>
<P>And now seeing the Disadvantages they were under for persuing the Account, <HI>viz.</HI> a small Ves∣sel ill repaired, and without Provisions, or Stores; they resolved one and all, with the little Supplies they could get, to proceed for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> not doubting to find a Remedy for all these Evils, and to retrieve their Loss.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="182"/>
In the Latitude of <HI>Deseada,</HI> one of the Islands, they took two Sloops, which supply'd them with Provisions and other Necessaries; and a few Days afterwards, took a Brigantine belonging to <HI>Rhode</HI> Island, which being fit for their Purpose, they converted to their own Use.</P>
<P>With these two Vessels they proceeded to <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI> off of which Island, they fell in with a <HI>Bristol</HI> Ship of 10 Guns, in her Voyage out, from whom they took abundance of Cloaths, some Money, twenty five Bails of Goods, five Barrels of Powder, a Cable and Hawser, ten Casks of Oatmeal, six Casks of Beef, and several other Goods, besides five of their Men; and after they had detained her three Days, let her go; who being bound for the above said Island, she acquainted the Governor with what had happened, as soon as she arrived.</P>
<P>Whereupon a <HI>Bristol</HI> Galley that lay in the Har∣bour, was ordered to be fitted out with all imagi∣nable Expedition, with 20 Guns, and 80 Men, there being then no Man of War upon that Station, and also a Sloop with 10 Guns, and 40 Men: The Galley was commanded by one Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and the Sloop by Captain <HI>Graves,</HI> of that Island, and Captain <HI>Rogers</HI> by a Commission from the Governour, was appointed Commadore.</P>
<P>The second Day after <HI>Rogers</HI> sailed out of the Harbour, he was discovered by <HI>Roberts</HI> and his Consort, who knowing nothing of their Design, gave them Chase. The <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Ships, kept an easy Sail till the Pyrates came up with them, and then <HI>Roberts</HI> gave them a Gun, expecting they would have immediately struck to his pyratical Flag, but instead thereof, he was forced to re∣ceive the Fire of a Broadside, with three Huzza's at the same Time; so an Engagement ensued be∣twixt the Galley and <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Sloop, and likewise between the Brigantine, and the Sloop which Cap∣tain
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
<HI>Graves</HI> commanded, for about two Hours; in which several Men were kill'd on both Sides, when <HI>Rogers</HI> grew weary of the Dispute, and left off on Pretence of splicing and knotting his Rigging. The Pyrate Brigantine was but ill Mann'd, and might easily have been taken by <HI>Graves</HI>'s Sloop, which would have been the Destruction of them both, had <HI>Rogers</HI> been as Zealous for the Service, after he had engaged, as he was before he sailed out of <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P>When the Heroes returned into Harbour, they made the most of this Adventure, and the Story was magnified to a Degree much beyond the Truth, as that they had kill'd 30 or 40 Men, cut and tore all their Rigging, and shattered their Hull to Pieces; but the Reason alledged for their not taking them, was, that the Pyrates out sail'd them, and so run away.</P>
<P><HI>Roberts</HI> lost five Men, and had as many wounded, and might very well have rally'd again, had there been any Thing to have been got by the Bargain; but as the Pyrates were not so much in search of Fame, as Plunder, they did not think the ta∣king of a hungry Privateer or two would recom∣pence the Labour, and so troubled themselves no further.</P>
<P>The Night after this Engagement, the Brigan∣tine went away, and left <HI>Roberts</HI> by himself, in as ill a Condition as <HI>Kennedy</HI> had done.</P>
<P>After the loss of the Brigantine, Captain <HI>Roberts</HI> sail'd in the Sloop to the Island of <HI>Dominico,</HI> where he watered, and got Provisions of the Inhabitants, to whom he gave Goods in Exchange. At this Place he met with 13 <HI>English</HI> Men, who had been set ashore by a <HI>French Guard de la Coste,</HI> belonging to <HI>Martinico,</HI> and taken out of two <HI>New-England</HI> Ships, that had been seized, as Prize, by the said <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
Sloop. The Men willingly entered with the Py∣rates, and it proved a seasonable Recruit to <HI>Roberts.</HI></P>
<P>They staid not long here, tho they had imme∣diate Occasion for cleaning their Sloop, but did not think this a proper Place, and herein they judg'd right; for the touching at this Island, had like to have been their Destruction, for they ha∣ving resolved to go away to the <HI>Granada</HI> Islands, for the aforesaid Purpose, by some Accident it came to be known to the <HI>French</HI> Colony, who send∣ing Word to the Govornor of <HI>Martinico,</HI> he equip∣ped and manned two Sloops to go in quest of them. The Pyrates sailed directly for the <HI>Grana∣dilloes,</HI> and hall'd into a Lagoon, at <HI>Corvocoo,</HI> where they cleaned with unusual Dispatch, staying but a little above a Week, by which Expedition they missed of the <HI>Martinico</HI> Sloops, only a few Hours; <HI>Roberts</HI> sailed over Night, that the <HI>French</HI> Men ar∣rived the next Morning. This was a fortunate Escape, especially considering, that it was not from any Fears of their being discovered, that they made so much hast from the Island; but, as they had the Impudence themselves to own, for the want of Wine and Women.</P>
<P>Thus narrowly escaped, they sailed for <HI>Newfound∣land,</HI> and arrived upon the Banks the latter end of <HI>June,</HI> 1720. They entered the Harbour of <HI>Tre∣passi,</HI> with their black Colours flying, Drums bea∣ting, and Trumpets sounding. There were two and twenty Vessels in the Harbour, which the Men all quitted upon the Sight of the Pyrate, and fled ashore. It is impossible particularly to recount the Destruction and Havock they made here, burn∣ing and sinking all the shipping, except a <HI>Bristol</HI> Galley, destroying the Fisheries, and Stages of the Planters, which might cause the Sufferers to make this Reflection: That nothing is so deplo∣rable
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
as Power in mean and ignorant Hands, it makes them wanton and giddy, unconcern'd at the Misfortunes they are imposing on their fellow Crea∣tures, and will make them smile at the Mischiefs, that bring themselves no Advantage. <HI>They are like mad Men that cast Fire-Brands, Arrows, and Death, and say, are not we in Sport?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Roberts</HI> mann'd the <HI>Bristol</HI> Galley, he took in the Harbour, and mounted 16 Guns on Board her, and cruising out upon the Banks, where he met with nine or ten Sail of <HI>French</HI> Ships, all which he destroyed except one of 26 Guns, which they seized, and carried off for their own Use. This Ship they christned <HI>the Fortune,</HI> and leaving the <HI>Bristol</HI> Galley to the <HI>French</HI> Men; they sail'd away in Company with the Sloop, for a Cruise, and took several Prizes, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Richard,</HI> of <HI>Biddiford, Jona∣than Whitfield</HI> Master; the <HI>Willing Mind</HI> of <HI>Pool;</HI> the <HI>Expectation,</HI> of <HI>Topsham;</HI> and the <HI>Samuel,</HI> Captain <HI>Cary,</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> out of these Ships they encreased their Company, by entring all the Men they could well spare, in their own Service. The <HI>Samuel</HI> was a rich Ship, and had several Passengers on Board, who were used very roughly, in order to make them discover their Money, threatning them every Moment with Death, if they did not resign every Thing up to them. They tore up the Hatches and entered the Hold like a parcel of Furies, and with Axes and Cutlashes, cut and broke open all the Bales, Cases, and Boxes, they could lay their Hands on; and when any Goods came upon Deck, that they did not like to carry aboard, instead of tossing them into the Hold again, threw them over-board into the Sea; all this was done with incessant cursing and swearing, more like Fiends than Men. They carried with them, Sails, Guns, Powder, and Cordage, and 8 or <HI>9000l.</HI> worth of the choicest Goods; and told Captain
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
<HI>Cary, That they should accept of no Act of Grace; that the K—and P—t might be damned with their Acts of G—for them, neither would they go to</HI> Hope-Point, <HI>to be hang'd up a Sun drying, as</HI> Kidd<HI>'s, and</HI> Braddish<HI>'s Company were; but that if they should ever be overpower'd, they would set Fire to the Powder, with a Pistol, and go all merrily to Hell together.</HI></P>
<P>After they had brought all the Booty aboard, a Consultation was held whether they should sink or burn the Ship, but whilst they were debating the Matter, they spy'd a Sail, and so left the <HI>Sa∣muel,</HI> to give her Chace; at Midnight they came up with the same, which proved to be a Snow from <HI>Bristol,</HI> bound for <HI>Boston,</HI> Captain <HI>Bowles</HI> Master: They us'd him barbarously, because of his Coun∣try, for the sake of Captain <HI>Rogers,</HI> who attacked them off <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he being of the City of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 16th, which was two Days afterwards, they took a <HI>Virginia</HI> Man call'd the <HI>Little York, James Philips</HI> Master, and the <HI>Love,</HI> of <HI>Leverpool,</HI> which they plundered and let go; and the next Day a Snow from <HI>Bristol,</HI> called the <HI>Phaenix, John Richards</HI> Master, met with the same Fate; as also a Brigantine, Cap∣tain <HI>Thomas,</HI> and a Sloop called the <HI>Sadbury;</HI> they took all the Men out of the Brigantine, and sunk the Vessel.</P>
<P>When they left the Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> they sailed for the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and the Provisions grow∣ing short, they went for the Latitude of the Island <HI>Desedea,</HI> to cruise, it being esteemed the likeliest Place to meet with such Ships as (they used in their Mirth to say) were configned to them, with Sup∣plies. And it has been very much suspected that Ships have loaded with Provisions at the <HI>English</HI> Colonies, on pretence of Trading to the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> when they have in reality been con∣signed to them; and tho' a shew of Violence is offered to them when they meet, yet they are
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
pretty sure of bringing their Cargo to a good Market.</P>
<P>However, at this Time they missed of their usual Luck, and Provisions and Necessaries be∣coming more scarce every Day, they retired to∣wards St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> where being deny'd all Suc∣cour or Assistance from the Government, they fir'd in Revenge on the Town, and burnt two Ships in the Road, one of them commanded by Captain <HI>Cox,</HI> of <HI>Bristol;</HI> and then retreated farther to the Island of St. <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> where they met with much handsomer Treatment. The Governor not only supplying them with Refreshments, but carress∣ed them in the most friendly Manner: And the Wo∣men, from so good an Example set them by the Men, endeavoured to outvie each other in Dress, and Behaviour, to attract the good Graces of such generous Lovers, that paid so well for their Favours.</P>
<P>Sated at length with these Pleasures, and ha∣ving taken on Board a good supply of fresh Provi∣sions, they voted unanimously for the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and in the Latitude of 22 N. in their Voy∣age thither, met with a <HI>French</HI> Ship from <HI>Martinico,</HI> richly laden, and, which was unlucky for the Master, had a property of being fitter for their Purpose, than the Banker. <HI>Exchange was no Robbery</HI> they said, and so after a little mock Complai∣sance to <HI>Monsieur,</HI> for the Favour he had done them, they shifted their Men, and took leave: This was their first <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>In this Ship <HI>Roberts</HI> proceeded on his design'd Voyage; but before they reached <HI>Guinea,</HI> he pro∣posed to touch at <HI>Brava,</HI> the Southermost of <HI>Cape Verd</HI> Islands, and clean. But here again by an intolerable Stupidity, and want of Judgment, they got so far to Leeward of their Port, that des¦pairing to regain it, or any of the Windware
<PB N="181" REF="188"/>
Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> they were obliged to go back again with the Trade-Wind, for the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> which had very near been the Destruction of them all. <HI>Surinam</HI> was the Place now designed for, which was at no less than 700 Leagues Distance, and they had but one Hogshead of Water left to supply 124 Souls for that Passage. A sad Circumstance that eminently exposes the Folly and Madness among the Pyrates, and he must be an inconside∣rate Wretch indeed, who, if he could separate the Wickedness and Punishment from the Fact, would yet hazard his Life amidst such Dangers, as their want of Skill and Forecast, made them liable to.</P>
<P>Their Sins, we may presume, were never so trou∣blesome to their Memories, as now, when there was not the least Glympse of Comfort alive; an inevitable Destruction seem'd to threaten them, and without the miraculous Intervention of Pro∣vidence, there appeared only this miserable Choice, <HI>viz.</HI> a present Death by their own Hands, or a lingring one by Famine; for none could have the Face to look upwards for Relief, when they had to that Moment defy'd the Power which alone could preserve them. How dreadful the Thoughts of their past mispent Life must be, under their pre∣sent deplorable Circumstances, let the Reader judge!</P>
<P>They continued their Course, and came to an Allowance of one single Mouthful of Water for 24 Hours; many of them drank their Urine, or Sea Water, which instead of allaying, gave them an inextinguishable Thirst, that kill'd them: Others pined and wasted a little more Time in Fluxes and Apyrexies, so that they dropped away daily: Those that sustain'd the Misery best, were such as almost starved themselves, forbearing all sorts of Food, unless a Mouthful or two of Bread the whole
<PB N="182" REF="189"/>
Day, so that those who survived were as weak as it was possible for Men to be, and alive.</P>
<P>But if the dismal Prospect they set out with, gave them Anxiety, Trouble, or Pain, what must their Fears and Apprehensions be, when they had not one Drop of Water left, or any Thing else, that could support Life. This was their Case, when (by the working of Divine Providence, no doubt,) they were brought into Soundings, and at Night anchor'd in seven Fathom Water: This was an inexpressible Joy to them, and as it were, fed the expiring Lamp of Life with fresh Spirits; but this could not hold long. When the Morning came, they saw Land from the Mast-Head, but it was at so a great Distance, that it afforded but an indifferent Prospect to Men who had drank nothing for the last two Days; however, they dispatch'd their Boat away, and late the same Night it return'd, to their no small Comfort, with a Load of Water, inform∣ing them, that they had got off the Mouth of <HI>Me∣riwinga</HI> River, on the Coast of <HI>Surinam.</HI></P>
<P>One would have thought so miraculous an Escape should have wrought some Reformation, but alass, they had no sooner quenched their Thirst, but they had forgot their Drowth, till scarcity of Provisions awakened their Senses, and bid them guard against starving; their Allowance was very small, and yet they would profanely say, <HI>That Providence which had gave them Drink, would no doubt, bring them Meat also, if they would use but an honest Endeavour.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuance of these honest Endeavours, they were steering for the Latitude of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> with what little they had left, to look out for more, or Starve; and in their Way met a Ship that an∣swered their Necessities, and after that, a Brigantine; the former was call'd the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> belonging to St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> and bound to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Mate
<PB N="183" REF="190"/>
of which signed the Pyrate's Articles, and was afterwards Captain of the <HI>Ranger,</HI> Consort to the <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>Out of the Ship and Brigantine, the Pyrates got a good supply of Provisions and Liquor, so that they gave over the design'd Cruise, and watered at <HI>Tobago,</HI> and then came to the Island of <HI>Marti∣nico,</HI> to make the Governor some sort of an Equivalent, for the Care and Expedition he had shewn, in fitting out two Sloops, to intercept them at <HI>Corvocoo.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Custom it seems at <HI>Martinico,</HI> for <HI>Dutch</HI> In∣terlopers that have a mind to Trade with the People of the Island, to hoist their Jacks when they come before the Town: <HI>Roberts</HI> knew the Signal, and being an utter Enemy to them, he bent his Thoughts upon Mischief; and accordingly came in with his Jack flying, which, as he expected, they mistook for a good Market, and thought them∣selves happiest that could soonest dipatch off their Sloops and Vessels, for Trade: When <HI>Roberts</HI> had got them within his Power, (one after another,) he told them, he would not have it said that they came off for nothing, and therefore ordered them to leave their Money behind, for that they were a Parcel of Rogues, and hoped they would always meet with such a <HI>Dutch</HI> Trade as this was; he reserved one Vessel to set the Passengers on Shore again, and fired the rest, to the Number of twenty.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dominico,</HI> the next Island he touched at, they took a <HI>Dutch</HI> Interloper, of 22 Guns, and 75 Men; and a Brigantine belonging to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> one <HI>Nor∣ton</HI> Master. The former made some Defence, till some of his Men being killed, the rest were dis∣couraged, and struck the Colours. With these two Prizes they went down to <HI>Guadalupe,</HI> and brought
<PB N="184" REF="191"/>
out a Sloop, and a great <HI>French</HI> Fly-Boat, laden with Sugar; the Sloop they burnt, and went on to <HI>Moonay,</HI> another Island, thinking to Clean, but finding the Sea ran too high there, to undertake it with Safety, they bent their Course for the North Part of <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> where at <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Key, in the Gulf of <HI>Saminah,</HI> they cleaned both the Ship and the Brigantine. For tho' <HI>Hispaniola</HI> be settled by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and is the Resi∣dence of a President from <HI>Spain,</HI> who receives, and finally determines Appeals from all the other <HI>Spanish West-India</HI> Islands; yet is its People by no Means proportioned to its Magnitude, so that there are many Harbours in it, to which Pyrates may securely resort, without Fear of Discovery from the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Whilst they were here, two Sloops came in, as they pretended, to pay <HI>Roberts</HI> a Visit, the Masters, whose Names were <HI>Porter,</HI> and <HI>Tuckerman,</HI> addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> did <HI>Solomon,</HI> to wit, <HI>That having heard of his Fame,</HI> and Atcheivments, they had put in their to learn his Art and Wis∣dom, in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of Necessaries for such Adventures. <HI>Roberts</HI> was won upon by the Peculiarity and Bluntness of these two Men, and gave them Powder, Arms, and what∣ever else they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and at parting said, he hoped the L—would Prosper their handy Works.</P>
<P>They passed some Time here, after they had got their Vessel ready, in their usual Debaucheries; they had taken a considerable Quantity of Rum and Sugar, so that Liquor was as plenty as
<PB N="185" REF="192"/>
Water, and few there were, who deny'd them∣selves the immoderate Use of it; nay, Sobriety brought a Man under a Suspicion of being in a Plot against the Common-Wealth, and in their Sense, he was looked upon to be a Villain that would not be drunk. This was evident in the Affair of <HI>Harry Glasby,</HI> chosen Master of the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> who, with two others, laid hold of an Opportunity at this Place, to move off with∣out bidding Farewel to his Friends. <HI>Glasby,</HI> was a reserved sober Man, and therefore gave Occa∣sion to be suspected, so that he was soon missed af∣ter he went away; and a Detachment being sent in quest of the Diserters, they were all three brought back again the next Day. This was a capital Offence, and for which they were ordered to be brought to an immediate Tryal.</P>
<P>Here was the Form of Justice kept up, which is as much as can be said of several other Courts, who have more lawful Commissions for what they do.—Here was no feeing of Council, and bri∣bing of Witnesses was a Custom not known among them; no packing of Juries, no torturing and wresting the Sense of the Law, for bye Ends and Purposes, no puzzling or perplexing the Cause, with untelligi∣ble canting Terms, and useless Destinctions; nor was their Sessions burthen'd with numberless Officers, the Ministers of Rapine, and Extortion, with ill boding Aspects, enough to fright <HI>Astrea</HI> from the Court.</P>
<P>The Place appointed for their Tryals, was the Steerage of the Ship; in order to which, a large Bowl of Rum Punch was made, and placed upon the Table, the Pipes and Tobacco being ready, the judicial Proceedings began; the Prisoners were brought forth, and Articles of Indictment against them read; they were arraigned upon a Statute of their own making, and the Letter of the Law
<PB N="186" REF="193"/>
being strong against them, and the Fact plainly proved, they were about to pronounce Sentence, when one of the Judges mov'd, that they should first Smoak t'other Pipe; which was according∣ly done.</P>
<P>All the Prisoners pleaded for Arrest of Judge∣ment very movingly, but, the Court had such an Abhorrence of their Crime, that they could not be prevailed upon to shew Mercy; till one of the Judges, whose Name was <HI>Valentine Ashplant,</HI> stood up, and taking his Pipe out of his Mouth, said, he had something to offer to the Court, in be∣half of one of the Prisoners; and spoke to this Effect.<HI>—By G—,</HI> Glasby <HI>should not dye; d—n him if he should.</HI> After this learned Speech, he sat down in his Place, and resumed his Pipe. This Motion was loudly opposed by all the rest of the Judges, in equivalent Terms; but <HI>Ashplant,</HI> who was resolute in his Opinion, made another pathe∣tical Speech, in the following Manner. <HI>G—d—n you Gentlemen, I am as good a Man as the best of you; d—n my</HI> S—l <HI>if ever I turn'd my Back to any Man in my Life, nor ever will, by G—;</HI> Glasby <HI>is an honest Fellow, notwithstanding this Misfortune, and I love him; D—l d—n me, if I don't: I hope he'll live and repent of what he has down; but d—n me if he must dye, I will dye along with him.</HI> And thereupon, he pulled out a pair of Pistols, and presented them to some of the other learned Judges upon the Bench; who, perceiving his Argument so well supported, thought it reasonable that <HI>Glasby</HI> should be par∣doned; and so they all came over to his Opinion, and allow'd it to be Law.</P>
<P>But all the mitigation that could be obtained for the other Convicts, was, that they should have the Liberty of choosing any four of the whole Company to be their Executioners. The poor Wretches were ty'd immediately to the Mast, and
<PB N="187" REF="194"/>
there shot dead, pursuant to their villanious Sen∣tence.</P>
<P>When they put to Sea again, the Prizes which had been detained only for fear of spreading any Rumour, concerning them, which had like to have been so fatal at <HI>Corvocoo,</HI> were thus disposed of: They burnt their own Sloop, and mann'd <HI>Norton</HI>'s Brigantine, sending the Master away in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Interloper, not dissatisfied.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> and the Brigantine, they pushed towards the Latitude of <HI>Desedea,</HI> to look out for Provisions, being very short again, and just to their Wish, Captain <HI>Hingstone</HI>'s ill Fortune brought him in their Way, richly laden for <HI>Jamai∣ca;</HI> him they carried to <HI>Berbudas,</HI> and plundered; and stretching back again to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> they continually met with some Consignment or other, (chiefly <HI>French,)</HI> which stored them with Plenty of Provisions, and recruited their starving Con∣dition; so that stocked with this sort of Am∣munition, they began to think of something wor∣thier their Aim, for these Robberies that only supplyed what was in constant Expenditure, by no Means answered their Intentions; and accor∣dingly they proceeded again for the Coast of <HI>Guinea,</HI> where they thought to buy Gold-Dust very Cheap. In the Passage thither, they took Numbers of Ships of all Nations, some of which they burnt or sunk, as the Carriage or Characters of the Ma∣sters displeased them.</P>
<P>About 400 Leagues from the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> the Brigantine who had hitherto lived with them, in all amicable Correspondence, and of whom they had no Mistrust, thought fit to take the Opportu∣nity of a dark Night, and leave the Commadore, to return to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> under Captain <HI>Bradley;</HI> this was a sensible Shock to them, (70 Hands being gone away in her,) occasioned it's thought, from
<PB N="188" REF="195"/>
the Haughty and Magisterial Behaviour of <HI>Roberts</HI> towards them, who regarded the Brigantine only as a Tender, and as such left them no more than the Refuse of their Plunder; however, he put on a Face of Unconcern, at this his ill Conduct and Mis∣management, and resolved not to alter his Purposes for it.</P>
<P>That we may have no more Occasion to talk of <HI>George Bradley</HI> hereafter, I shall leave Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> to pursue his Voyage to <HI>Guinea,</HI> while we follow the Adventures of our new Captain, in which I shall be as brief as possible.</P>

<HEAD>Of Capt. <HI>George Bradley.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 1721, <HI>George Bradley</HI> went off from <HI>Boberts,</HI> in the Brigantine call'd the <HI>Good Fortune,</HI> and returned to the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> but, tho' the Crew of this Vessel, was unanimous as to their Separation, yet they were not so in their Resolutions, relating to their future Undertakings; some of them, being for prosecuting their former villanious Schemes; and others, to submit to his Majesty's Mercy, which could they have had any Assurance of, 'tis believed the latter would have prevailed. But there was no Act of Grace then in Force, by which they might be entituled to the Be∣nefit of a Pardon, and so there was no Encourage∣ment for them to turn Honest.</P>
<P>The first Prize they took, (as far as I can learn,) was a Ship belonging to <HI>New-York,</HI> Captain <HI>Marston</HI> Commander, betwixt the Island of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> they did not meddle with the Cargo, but took away his Cloaths, Liquors, and Provi∣sions, and five of his Men, and then let him go. In this Cruise they took two or three small Vessels, and afterwards spent sometime at one of the Islands, where they clean'd, and refited their Brigantine.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="196"/>
Captain <HI>Bradley,</HI> in another Cruise, made him∣self Master of a stout Ship, aboard of which he mounted 32 Guns, and was called the <HI>Morning Star;</HI> upon his taking the Command of her, one <HI>John Fenn</HI> was appointed Captain of the Brigan∣tine. With this Force they took several Prizes, but not so many as they might have done, had they been more resolute, the Fears and Qualms of some, interrupted the Designs of the rest; and those they took, they plundered of little more than Necessaries. At length they concluded upon a Petition to his Majesty, which was drawn up without Names, and Copies sent of it by several Ships, which for the Curiosity of the Reader, is here inserted.</P>

<P><HI>THAT we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, have at sundry Times, been taken by</HI> Bartholomew Roberts, <HI>the then Captain of the abovesaid Vessels, and Company, together with another Ship, in which we left him; and have been forced by him, and his wicked Ac∣complices, to enter into, and serve in the said Company, as Pyrates, much contrary to our Wills and Inclinations: And we your loyal Subjects utterly abhoring, and detesting that impious way of Living, did, with an unanimous</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="197"/>
<HI>Consent, and contrary to the Knowledge of the said</HI> Ro∣berts, <HI>or his Accomplices, on, or about the 18th Day of</HI> April, 1721, <HI>leave, and ran away from the aforesaid Ship</HI> Morning Star, <HI>and Brigantine</HI> Good Fortune, <HI>with no other Intent and Meaning, than the Hopes of obtain∣ing your Majesty's most gracious Pardon. And, that we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, may with more Safety, return to our native Country, and serve the Nation, unto which we belong, in our respective Capacities, with∣out Fear of being prosecuted, by the injured, whose Estates have suffered by the said</HI> Roberts, <HI>and his Accomplices, during our forcible Detainment, by the said Company: We most humbly implore your Majesty's most royal Assent, to this our humble Petition.</HI></P>
<P>And your Petitioners shall ever pray.</P>
<P>The above is a true Copy of our humble Peti∣tion to your Majesty, which we have dis∣patch'd by two several Opportunities, be∣fore this, <HI>(viz.</HI> one dated the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> 1722, the other of the 24th of <HI>June</HI> follow∣ing.) We have nothing more to add, but to testify our most earnest Desire, to embrace all Occasions, to assure your Majesty, that we have nothing so much at Heart, as the want of an Opportunity, to return to our Duty. We have been the bolder in repre∣senting those repeated Petitions, being very sensible of your Majesty's great Cle∣mency and Mercy, makes us hope your Majesty will extend your unbounded Good∣ness to us; who unhappily, and contrary to our Inclinations, have fallen into a Course of Life, which is very disagreeable to us.</P>

<DIV3>
<P>It was not not long after this last Petition was sent, before a Period was put to <HI>Bradley</HI>'s Adven∣tures,
<PB N="191" REF="198"/>
in another Manner; for the dreadful Hurri∣cane that did so great Damages at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and other Islands, the Beginning of <HI>September,</HI> 1722, proved fatal to him, for he was cast upon the <HI>Grand Cammanos,</HI> to the Leeward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where their Ship was lost, but <HI>Bradley,</HI> and all the Crew, got safe ashore.</P>
<P>After the Storm was over, the Governor of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> receiving Information of <HI>Bradley</HI>'s Disaster, ordered his Majesty's Ship <HI>Launceston,</HI> to Sea, in order to secure as many of the Men as he could take, that they might be brought to Justice; but upon landing the Man of War's Men, <HI>Bradley,</HI> and the old Standers, retreated to the Woods, and about forty of the new ones, who pretended they had been forced into their Service, surrendered, and were brought away to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and then to <HI>England. Bradley</HI> himself, and three others, surrendred to a Vessel belonging to <HI>Bermudas,</HI> who were carried to that Island, and there imprisoned, and what after∣wards became of them, I know not.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of Captain <HI>FENN.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>FENN,</HI> in the Brigantine, weather'd out the Storm, and sail'd towards the Bay of <HI>Hondu∣ras,</HI> near which he carreened; he had two or three Prisoners on Board at that Time, particularly one Captain <HI>Durfey,</HI> of <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> who consulted with some of the Men, of Means for seizing the most hardned of the Crew, and going away with the Brigantine; and a Scheme was accordingly laid, but before it was ripe for Execution, <HI>Fenn,</HI> some Way or other, came to the Knowledge of it, by which the Design was frustrated; However, Captain <HI>Durfey,</HI> and four or five more, got on Shore with Arms and Ammunition; and the Pyrates Ca∣noe with three Men coming afterwards to Water,
<PB N="192" REF="199"/>
Captain <HI>Durfey</HI> secured both Canoe, and Men; up∣on which, the Pyrates mann'd their Boat, and sent her ashore, but with the same ill Success, for that was also secured, and the Men too. After which being enraged, they sent another Boat, with up∣wards of 30 Hands; but Captain <HI>Durfey,</HI> and the Company he had by that Time got together, gave them such a warm Reception, that they were glad to be take themselves to their Vessel again.</P>
<P>Tho' Captain <HI>Fenn</HI> escaped the Snare laid for him at the Bay, yet he came off with the Loss of seve∣ral of his Men, as has been said, which he thought he could have trusted: This Defection made him uneasy; however, there was no looking back, the only Security for him, was, to push on and accu∣mulate all the Power and Strength that he could make himself Master of. He sailed for the <HI>West-In∣dies</HI> again, in the beginning of <HI>December;</HI> in his Way took a stout Ship, commanded by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> aboard of which he mounted 24 Guns, and went himself Captain; and this produced a new Commander for the Brigantine, who was in an im∣mediate Succession from <HI>Roberts,</HI> for <HI>Roberts</HI> made <HI>Brad∣ley</HI> Captain of the same Brigantine; and <HI>Fenn</HI> was, as <HI>Bradley</HI>'s Strength encreased, made by him; and now <HI>Fenn</HI> deputed another, who reigned but a short Time.</P>
<P>In <HI>January, Fenn</HI> cruised among the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, and took two or three Vessels; one of them was the <HI>Antelope</HI> Sloop, of <HI>Dublin,</HI> loaded with Pro∣visions, which they kept with all her Cargo. With this Sloop, the Brigantine and Ship, about the be∣ginning of <HI>April</HI> last, <HI>Fen</HI> came to the Island of <HI>To∣bago,</HI> with a Design to clean: At that Time his Ma∣jesty's Ship <HI>Winchelsea,</HI> happening to touch at <HI>Ante∣goa,</HI> received Intelligence of these Vessels going in there, which were then only supposed to be Py∣rates. The <HI>Winchelsea</HI> weigh'd and sail'd for the
<PB N="193" REF="200"/>
Island, where he supprized the Rogues: <HI>Fenn</HI> and his Crew, set Fire to the Ship and Sloop, and fled ashore to the Woods, but the Brigantine escaped. However, the new Comers, and those who had been tired with the Trade, took the Advantage of this Confusion, and rose upon the rest! The Captain and some others were killed in the Scuffle, and his Head cut off, which they brought to <HI>Ca∣racco,</HI> and there surrender'd themselves and Vessel.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Fenn,</HI> his Gunner, and three others, were taken a Day or two afterwards, and carried to <HI>Antegoa,</HI> and executed, without further Cere∣mony, and the former hang'd in Chains. Those who were left behind, were afterwards brought away by the <HI>Hector</HI> Man of War.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Continuation of Captain</HI> Roberts<HI>'s Adventures.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE go back now, to where we left <HI>Roberts, viz.</HI> about 400 Leagues from the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> pursuing his Voyage thither, in the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> after the Separation of <HI>Bradley.</HI></P>
<P>He fell in to Windward nigh the <HI>Senegal,</HI> a River of great Trade for Gum, on this Part of the Coast, monopolized by the <HI>French,</HI> who constantly keep Cruisers, to hinder the interloping Trade: At this Time they had two small Ships on that Ser∣vice, one of 10 Guns and 65 Men, and the other of 16 Guns and 75 Men; who having got a Sight of Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> and supposing him to be one of these prohibited Traders, chased with all the Sail they could make, to come up with him; but their Hopes which had brought them very nigh, too late deceived them, for on the hoisting of <HI>Jolly Roger,</HI> (the Name they give their black Flag,) their <HI>French</HI> Hearts failed, and they both surrendred without
<PB N="194" REF="201"/>
any, or at least very little Resistance. With these Prizes they went into <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> and made one of them their Consort, by the Name of the <HI>Ranger,</HI> and the other a Store-Ship, to clean by.</P>
<P><HI>Sierraleon</HI> River disgorges with a large Mouth, the Starboard-Side of which, draughts into little Bays, safe and convenient for cleaning and water∣ing; what still made it preferable to the Pyrates, is, that the Traders settled here, are naturally their Friends. There are about 30 <HI>English</HI> Men in all, Men who in some Part of their Lives, have been either privateering, buccaneering, or pyrating, and still retain and love the Riots, and Humours, common to that sort of Life. They live very friendly with the Natives, and have many of them, of both Sexes, to be their <HI>Grometta</HI>'s, or Servants: The Men are faithful, and the Women so obedient, that they are very ready to prostitute themselves to whomsoever their Masters shall command them. The Royal <HI>African</HI> Company has a Fort on a small Island call'd <HI>Bence</HI> Island, but 'tis of little Use, besides keeping their Slaves; the Distance making it in∣capable of giving any Molestation to their Star∣board Shore. Here lives at this Place an old Fel∣low, who goes by the Name of <HI>Crackers,</HI> (his true Name he thinks sit to conceal,) who was formerly a noted Buccaneer, and has robb'd and murdered many a Man; he keeps the best House in the Place, has two or three Guns before his Door, with which he Salutes his Friends, the Pyrates, when they put in, and lives a jovial Life with them, all the while they are there.</P>
<P>Here follows a List, of the rest of those lawless Merchants, and their Servants, who carry on a private Trade with the Interlopers, to the great Prejudice of the Roval <HI>African</HI> Company, who with extraordinary Industry and Expence, have made Settlements sufficient to carry on a Trade, which
<PB N="195" REF="202"/>
brings more real Advantage to the Kingdom, than all other Companies, put together. Where∣fore, 'tis to be hop'd, proper Means will be taken, to root out a pernicious set of People, who have all their Lives, supported themselves by the La∣bours of other Men.</P>

<P>The Harbour is so convenient for Wooding and Watering, that it occasions many of our trading Ships, especially those of <HI>Bristol,</HI> to call in there, with large Cargoes of Beer, Syder, and strong Ly∣quors, which they Exchange with these private Traders, for Slaves and Teeth, purchased by them at the <HI>Rio Nune</HI>'s, and other Places to the North∣ward, so that here was what they call good Living.</P>
<P>Hither <HI>Roberts</HI> came the End of <HI>June,</HI> and had In∣telligence that the <HI>Swallow,</HI> and <HI>Weymouth,</HI> two Men of War, of 50 Guns, had left that River about a Month before, and designed to return about <HI>Christ∣mas;</HI> so that the Pyrates could indulge themselves with all the Satisfaction in the World, in that they knew that they were not only secure whilst there, but that in going down the Coast, after the Men of War, they should always be able to get such Intelligence of their Rendezvous, as would serve to make their Expedition safe. So after six Weeks stay, the Ships being cleaned and fitted, and the Men weary of whoring and drinking, they bethought themselves of Business, and went to
<PB N="197" REF="204"/>
Sea the Beginning of <HI>August,</HI> taking their Progress down the whole Coast, as low as <HI>Jaquin,</HI> plunder∣ing every Ship they met, of what was valuable in her, and sometimes to be more mischieviously wicked, would throw what they did not want over-board, accumulating Cruelty to Theft.</P>
<P>In this Range, they exchanged their old <HI>French</HI> Ship, for a fine Frigot built Ship, call'd the <HI>Onslow,</HI> belonging to the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company, Captain <HI>Gee</HI> Commander, which happened to lye at <HI>Sestos,</HI> to get Water and Necessaries for the Company. A great many of Captain <HI>Gee</HI>'s Men were ashore, when <HI>Roberts</HI> bore down upon her, and so the Ship was the more easily surprized into his Hands, tho' had they been all on Board, it was not likely the Case would have been otherwise; for the most Part of them voluntarily join'd with the Pyrates, and there seem'd to be a general Dispo∣sition in the Sailors, towards them; and whenever they talk'd of them, it was with a great deal of Pleasure, commending their brave Actions, as if Robberies on the Sea, had been no more than Feats of Knight-Errantry; so that it was easy to per∣ceive they wish'd them Success; and even some Soldiers, who were on Board the Ship, and were going as Recruits, to <HI>Cape-Coast-Castle,</HI> in the Company's Service, were so Possess'd with the gal∣lantry of this Life, that they must needs offer themselves Voluntiers; but our Pyrates entertain'd so contemptible a Notion of Land-Men, that they absolutely refused to receive them; at last, upon their earnest Prayers and Intreaties, they admit∣ted some of them out of <HI>Charity,</HI> as they were pleased to term it, allowing them no more than a Quarter-Share; so they were taken on Board.</P>
<P>There was a Clergyman on Board the <HI>Onslow,</HI> sent from <HI>England,</HI> to be Chaplain of <HI>Cape-Coast-Castle,</HI> some of the Pyrates were for keeping him,
<PB N="198" REF="205"/>
alledging merrily, that their Ship wanted a Cha∣plain; accordingly they offered him a Share, to take on with them, promising, he should do no∣thing for his Money, but make Punch, and say Prayers; yet, however brutish they might be in other Things, they bore so great a Respect to his Order, that they resolved not to force him against his Inclinations; so the Parson having no relish for this sort of Life, excused himself from accept∣ing the Honour they designed him; they were sa∣tisfied with his Excuse, and were so generous to deliver him back every Thing which he owned to be his: The Parson laid hold of this favourable Disposition of the Pyrates, and laid Claim to several Things which belonged to others, which were also given up to his great Satisfaction; in fine, they kept nothing which belonged to the Church, except three Prayer-Books, and a Bottle-Screw, which as I was inform'd by one of the Pyrates himself, they said they had Occasion for, for their own Use.</P>
<P>The Pyrates kept the <HI>Onflow</HI> for their own Use, and gave Captain <HI>Gee</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ship, and then fell to making such Alterations as might fit her for a Sea-Rover, pulling down her Bulk-Heads, and making her flush, so that she became, in all Respects, as compleat a Ship for their Purpose, as any they could have found; they continued to her the Name of the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> and mounted her with 40 Guns.</P>
<P>She and the <HI>Ranger</HI> proceeded (as I said before,) to <HI>Jaquin,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Old Calabar,</HI> where they arrived about <HI>October,</HI> in order to clean their Ships, a Place the most suitable along the whole Coast, for there is a Bar with not above 15 Foot Water upon it, and the Channel intricate, so that had the Men of War met with them here, they might have bid Defiance to their Strength,
<PB N="199" REF="206"/>
for the Depth of Water at the Bar, as well as the want of a Pilot, was a sufficient Security to the Rovers, and invincible Impediments to them. Here therefore they sat easy, and divided the Fruits of their dishonest Industry, <HI>and drank and drove Care away.</HI> The Pilot who brought them into this Harbour, was Captain <HI>L—e,</HI> who for this, and other Services, was extreamly well paid, according to the Journal of their own Accounts, which do not run in the ordinary and common Way, of <HI>Debtor, contra Creditor,</HI> but much more concise, lumping it together, and so carrying the Debt in their Heads, against the next honest Trader they meet.</P>
<P>They took at <HI>Calabar,</HI> Captain <HI>Loane,</HI> and two or three <HI>Bristol</HI> Ships, the particulars of all which would be unnecessary Prolixity to enter upon, therefore I come now to give an Account of the Usage they received from the Natives of this Place. The <HI>Calabar</HI> Negroes, did not prove so civil, as they expected, for they refused to have any Com∣merce or Trade with them, when they under∣stood they were Pyrates: An Indication that these poor Creatures, in the narrow Circum∣stances they were in, and without the Light of the Gospel, or the Advantage of an Edu∣cation, have, notwithstanding, such a moral in∣nate Honesty, as would upbraid, and shame the most knowing Christian: But this did but ex∣asperate these lawless Fellows, and so a Party of 40 Men were detach'd to force a Correspondence, or drive the Negroes to Extremities; and they accordingly landed under the Fire of their Cannon. The Negroes drew up in a Body of 2000 Men, as if they intended to dispute the Matter with them, and staid till the Pyrates advanced within Pistol∣shot, but finding the Loss of two or three, made no Impression on the rest, the Negroes thought fit to Retreat, which they did with some Loss: The
<PB N="200" REF="207"/>
Pyrates set Fire to the Town, and then return'd to their Ships. This terrified the Negroes, and put an entire stop to all the Intercourse between them; so that they could get no Supplies of fresh Provisions, or any Thing else, which obliged them, as soon as they had finished the cleaning and trim∣ing of their Ships, to lose no Time; so they went for Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> and watered, and at <HI>Anna Bona,</HI> took aboard a Stock of fresh Provisions, and then sail'd for the Coast again.</P>
<P>This was their last and fatal Expedition, which we shall be more particular in, because, it cannot be imagined that they could have had Assurance to have undertaken it, but upon a Presumption, that the Men of War, (who they knew were upon the Coast,) were unable to attack them.</P>
<P>They fell in with the Coast as low as Cape <HI>La∣h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u,</HI> and even that was higher than they designed, in the Beginning of <HI>January,</HI> and took the Ship, call'd the <HI>King S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lomon,</HI> with 20 Men in their Boat, and a trading Vessel, both belonging to the Company. The Pyrate Ship happened to fall about a League to Leeward of the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> at Cape <HI>Appollonia,</HI> and the Current and Wind opposing their work∣ing up with the Ship; they agreed to send the Long-Boat, with a sufficient Number of Men, to take her. The Pyrates are all Voluntiers on these Occasions, the Word being always given, <HI>who will go?</HI> And presently the stanch and firm Men offer themselves; because, by such Readiness, they re∣commend their Courage, and have an Allowance also of a Shirt of Cloaths, from Head to Foot, out of the Prize.</P>
<P>They r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wed towards the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> with a great deal of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acrity, and being hail'd by the Commander of her, answered, <HI>Defiance;</HI> Captain <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> before this, observing a great Number of Men in the Boat, began not to like his Vi∣sitors,
<PB N="201" REF="208"/>
and prepar'd to receive them, firing a Musket as they came under his Stern, which they return'd with a Volley, and made grea∣ter Speed to get on Board: Upon this, he ap∣plied to his Men, and ask'd them, whether they would stand by him, to Defend the Ship, it being a Shame they should be taken by half their Num∣ber, without any Repulse? But his Boatswain, <HI>Phi∣lips,</HI> took upon him to be the Mouth of the Peo∣ple, and put an End to the Dispute; he said plain∣ly, he would not; laid down his Arms in the King's Name, as he was pleased to Term it, and call'd out to the Boat for Quarters, so that the rest, by his Example, were mislead to the losing of the Ship.</P>
<P>When they came on Board, they brought her under Sail, by an expeditious Method, of cutting the Cable, <HI>Walden</HI> one of the Pyrates, telling the Master, this <HI>yo hope</HI> of heaving up the Anchor, was a needless trouble, when they design'd to burn the Ship. They brought her under Commadore <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Stern, and not only rifled her of what Sails, Cordage, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they wanted for themselves, but wantonly throw'd the Goods of the Company over-board, like Spend∣thrifts, that neither expected or design'd any account.</P>
<P>On the same Day also, they took the <HI>Flushing,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, robbed her of Masts, Yards, and Stores, and then cut down her Fore-Mast; but what sat most heavily with the <HI>Skipper,</HI> was, their taking some very fine Sausages he had on Board, of his Wife's making, and stringing them, in ludicrous Manner, round their Necks, till they had sufficiently shew'd their Contempt of them, and then threw them into the Sea. Others chopp'd the Heads of his Powls ost, to be dressed for their Supper, and cour∣teously invited the Landlord, provided he would find Liquor. It was a melancholly Request to the Man, but it must be comply'd with, and he was
<PB N="202" REF="209"/>
oblig'd, as they grew drunk, to sit quietly, and hear them sing <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Songs, out of his <HI>Dutch</HI> Prayer-Books, with other Prophaness, that he, (tho' a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man,) stood amaz'd at.</P>
<P>In chasing too near in, they alarm'd the Coast, and Expresses were sent to the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories, giving an Account of it: They were sensible of this Error immediately, and, because they would make the best of a bad Market, resol∣ved to keep out of sight of Land, and lose the Prizes they might expect, between that and <HI>Why∣dah,</HI> to make the more sure of that Port, where commonly is the best Booty; all Nations trading thither, especially <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who Purchase chiefly with Gold, the Idol their Hearts were bent upon; and notwithstanding this unlikely Course, they met, and took, several Ships, between <HI>Axim</HI> and that Place; the circumstantial Stories of which, and the panick Terrors they struck into his Ma∣jesty's Subjects, being tedious and unnecessary to relate, I shall pass by, and come to their Arrival in that Road.</P>
<P>They came to <HI>Whydah</HI> with a St. <HI>George</HI>'s Ensign, a black Silk Flag flying at their Mizen-Peek, and a Jack and a Pendant of the same, and found a eleven Sail in the Road, <HI>English, French,</HI> and <HI>Portuguese;</HI> the <HI>French</HI> were three stout Ships of 30 Guns, and upwards of 100 Men each, yet when <HI>Roberts</HI> came to Fire, they, with the other Ships, immediately struck their Colours and surrendred to his Mercy. One Rea∣son, it must be confess'd, of this easy Victory, was, the Commanders, and a good part of the Men being ashore, according to the Custom of the Place, to receive the Cargoes, and return the Slaves, they being obliged to Watch the Seasons for it, which otherwise, in so dangerous a Sea as here, would be impracticable. These all, except the <HI>Porc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pine,</HI> ransom'd with him for eight Pound
<PB N="203" REF="210"/>
of Gold-Dust, a Ship, not without the trouble of some Letters passing, and repassing from the Shore, before they could settle it; and notwithstanding the Agreement and Payment, they took away one of the <HI>French</HI> Ships, tho' with a Promise to return her, taking with them several of her Men for that End.</P>
<P>Some of the Foreigners, who never had Dealing this Way before, desired for Satisfaction to their Owners, that they might have a Receipt for their Money, which were accordingly given, a Copy of one of them, I have here subjoined, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THIS is to certify whom it may, or doth Concern, that we</HI> GENTLEMEN OF FORTUNE, <HI>have receiv'd eight Pounds of Gold-Dust, for the Ransom of the</HI> Hardey, <HI>Captain</HI> Dittwitt <HI>Commander, so that we Dis∣charge the said Ship,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Witness our Hands, this 13th of</HI> Jan. 1721-2.</P>
<P>Batt. Roberts, Harry Glasby.</P>
<P>Others were given to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Captains, which were in the same Form, but being sign'd by two waggish Fellows, <HI>viz. Sutton,</HI> and <HI>Simpson,</HI> they subscrib'd by the Names of,</P>
<P>Aaron Whiffingpin,</P>
<P>Sim. Tugmutton.</P>
<P>But there was something so singularly Cruel and Barbarous done here to the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> Captain <HI>Hetcher,</HI> as must not be passed over without spe∣cial Remark.</P>
<P>This Ship lay in the Road almost Slaved, when the Pyrates came in, and the Commander being on Shore, settling his Accounts, was sent to for the Ransom, but he excused it, as having no Orders from the Owners; tho' the true Reason might be, that he thought it dishonourable to treat with Robbers; and that the Ship separate from the Slaves, towards whom he could mistrust no Cruel∣ty, was not worth the Sum demanded; hereupon,
<PB N="204" REF="211"/>
<HI>Roberts</HI> sends the Boat to Transport the Negroes, in Order to set her on Fire, but being in hast, and finding that unshackling them, cost much Time and Labour, they actually set her on Fire, with eighty of these poor Wretches on Board, chained two and two together, under the miserable Choice of perish∣ing by Fire or Water: Those who jumped over∣board from the Flames, were seized by Sharks, a voracious Fish, in Plenty in this Road, and, in their Sight, tore Limb from Limb alive. A Cruelty unparalell'd! And for which had every Individual been hanged, few I imagine would think that Justice had been rigorous.</P>
<P>The Pyrates indeed were obliged to dispatch their Business here, in hast, because they had in∣tercepted a Letter from General <HI>Phips,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Bald∣win,</HI> the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company's Agent at <HI>Whydah,</HI> (giving an Account, that <HI>Roberts</HI> had been seen to Windward of Cape <HI>Three Points,)</HI> that he might the better guard against the Damages to the Com∣pany's Ships, if he should arrive at that Road before the <HI>Swallow</HI> Man of War, which he assured him, at the Time of that Letter, was pursuing them to that Place. <HI>Roberts</HI> call'd up his Company, and desired they would hear <HI>Phips</HI>'s Speech, (for so he was pleased to call the Letter,) and notwith∣standing their vapouring, perswaded them of the Necessity of moving, for, says he, <Q>“such brave Fellows cannot be supposed to be frightned at this News, yet that it were better to avoid dry Blows, which is the best that can be expected, if over∣taken.”</Q></P>
<P>This Advice weigh'd with them, and they got under Sail, having stay'd only from <HI>Thursday</HI> to <HI>Saturday</HI> Night, and at Sea voted for the Island of <HI>Anna Bona,</HI> but the Winds hanging out of the Way, crossed their Purpose, and brought them to Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> where I shall leave them for their approach∣ing

Fate, and relate some further Particulars of his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Swallow, viz.</HI> where it was she had spent her Time, during this Mischief that was done, and by what Means unable to prevent it; what also was the Intelligence she received, and the Measures thereon formed, that at last brought two such Strangers as Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> and Captain <HI>Ogle,</HI> to meet in so remote a Corner of the World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> and <HI>Weymouth</HI> left <HI>Sierraleon, May</HI> 28, where, I have already taken Notice, <HI>Roberts</HI> arrived about a Month after, and doubtless learn'd the Intent of their Voyage, and cleaning on the Coast; which made him set down with more Security to his Diversion, and furnish him with such Intima∣tions, as made his first Range down the Coast in <HI>August</HI> following, more prosperous; the <HI>Swallow</HI> and <HI>Weymouth,</HI> being then at the Port of <HI>Princess</HI> a cleaning.</P>
<P>Their stay at <HI>Princess,</HI> was from <HI>July</HI> 28, to <HI>Sept.</HI> 20 1721. Where, by a Fatality, common to the Ir∣regularities of Seamen, (who cannot in such Cases be kept under due Restraints,) they buried 100 Men in three Weeks Time, and reduced the Re∣mainder of the Ships Companies into so sickly a State, that it was with Difficulty they brought them to Sail; and this Misfortune was the Ruine of <HI>Roberts,</HI> for it prevented the Men of War's going back to <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> as it was intended, for he being acquainted with their Design of returning, took his Measures accordingly; and this Alteration in the Affairs, which obliged them to change their Resolution, not coming to his Knowledge, by that Means he fell into the Mouth of Danger, when he thought himself the farthest from it. The <HI>Wey∣mouth</HI> being obliged, for want of Hands, to be left at Cape <HI>Corso,</HI> the two Men of War fell in with the Continent at Cape <HI>Appollonia, October</HI> 20, and there receiv'd the first Notice, from one Captain
<PB N="06" REF="213"/>
<HI>Bird,</HI> who had taken three of the Pyrate's Men at Cape <HI>Mount,</HI> of those mischievous Exploits of <HI>Roberts,</HI> his taking the <HI>Onslow, &amp;c.</HI> This awaken'd, and put the Men of War on their Guard, tho' it was little expected <HI>Roberts</HI> would have had the Bold∣ness to make a second such-like Attempt, because it was impossible to think he could then have known their weak Condition.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> having seen the <HI>Weymouth</HI> into Cape <HI>Corso</HI> Road, <HI>November</HI> the 10th, plied to Windward as far as <HI>Bassam,</HI> for what further Intelligence she could gain of these Pyrates, and to protect the Trade, but every where found it undisturbed, and were, for that Reason, returning to her Consort, when accidently meeting a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship, he told her, that the Day before, she saw two Ships Chace into <HI>Junk,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, which she believed must have fallen into their Hands. On this Story, the <HI>Swallow</HI> clung her Wind, and endeavoured to gain that Place, but receiving soon after <HI>(Octo.</HI> the 14th,) a contrary Report, from Captain <HI>Plum∣mer,</HI> an intelligent Man, in the <HI>Jason</HI> of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who had come further to Windward, and neither saw, or heard any Thing of this; she turned her Head downward the second Time, anchoring at Cape <HI>Appollonia,</HI> the 23d. at Cape <HI>Tres Puntas,</HI> the 27th, and in <HI>Corso</HI> Road, <HI>January</HI> the 7th, 1721-2.</P>
<P>They learned that their Consort was, by the Assistance of some Soldiers from the Castle, gone to Windward to demand Restitution of some Goods, or Men, belonging to the Royal <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany, that were illegally detained by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> at <HI>Des Minas;</HI> and while they were regretting so long a Separation, an Express came to General <HI>Phips,</HI> from <HI>Axim,</HI> the 9th, and followed by another from <HI>Dixcove,</HI> (an <HI>English</HI> Factory,) with Information that three Ships had chased and taken, a Galley nigh <HI>Axim</HI> Castle, and a trading Boat belonging
<PB N="207" REF="214"/>
to the Company: No doubt was made, concerning what they were, it being taken for granted, they were Pyrates; and supposed to be the same that had so lately infested the Coast. The natural Re∣sult therefore, from these two Advices, was to hasten for <HI>Whydah,</HI> for it was concluded the Prizes he had taken, had informed them how nigh the <HI>Swallow</HI> was, and withal how much better in Health than she had been for some Months past; so that unless they were very mad indeed, they would (after being discovered) make the best of their Way for <HI>Whydah,</HI> and secure the Booty there, without which, their Time and Industry had been entirely lost; most of the Gold lying in that Corner.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> weighed from Cape <HI>Corso, January</HI> the 10th, but was retarded by waiting some Hours on the <HI>Margaret,</HI> the Company's Ship, at <HI>Accra,</HI> on the <HI>Portugal,</HI> and a whole Day at <HI>Apong,</HI> on a Person whom they generaly used to stile <HI>Miss Betty,</HI> (one of 'Squire <HI>Morrice</HI>'s Ships:) A Conduct that Mr. <HI>Phips</HI> afterwards blamed, altho he had given it as his Opinion, the Pyrates could not be passed by, and intimated, their Stay a few Hours would prove no Prejudice.</P>
<P>This, however, hinder'd the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s catching them at <HI>Whydah,</HI> for the Pyrates came in to that Road, with a fresh Gale of Wind, the same Day the <HI>Swallow</HI> was at Anchor at <HI>Apong,</HI> and sail'd the 13th of <HI>January,</HI> from thence, that she arrived the 17th. She gained Notice of them, by a <HI>French</HI> Shallop from <HI>Grand Papa,</HI> the 14th at Night, and from <HI>Little Papa,</HI> next Morning, by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, so that the Man of War, was on all Sides, as they thought, sure of their Purchase, particularly when they made the Ships, and discovered three of them to get under Sail immediately, at Sight of her, making Signals to one another, as tho' they design'd
<PB N="208" REF="215"/>
a Defence, but they were found to be three <HI>French</HI> Ships; and those at Anchor, <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>English,</HI> all honest Traders, who had been ransack'd, and ransom'd.</P>
<P>This Disappointment chagreen'd the Ship's Com∣pany, who were very intent upon their Market; tho' in all liklyhood, had they met with them in that open Road, one or both would have made their Escapes; or if they had thought fit to have fought, their Defence would have been more des∣perate together, and they would have been more difficult to have been overcome.</P>
<P>While they were contemplating on the Matter, a Letter was received from Mr. <HI>Baldwin,</HI> (Gover∣nor here for the Company,) signifying, that the Pyrates were at <HI>Jaquin,</HI> seven Leagues lower. The <HI>Swallow</HI> weighed at two next Morning, <HI>January</HI> the 16th, and got to <HI>Jaquin</HI> by Day-Light, but to no other End, than frightening the Crews of two <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships on Shore, who took her for the Pyrate, that had struck such Terror at <HI>Whydah:</HI> She returned therefore that Night, and having been strengthen'd with thirty Voluntiers, <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> the discarded Crews of the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Ship they had carried from hence. She put to Sea again <HI>January</HI> the 19th, conjecturing, that either <HI>Calabar, Princess,</HI> the River <HI>Gabone,</HI> Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> or <HI>Annabona,</HI> must be touched at for Water, and Refreshment, tho' they should resolve to leave the Coast. As to the former of those Places, I have before observed, it was hazardous to think of, or rather impracticable; <HI>Princess</HI> had been a sower Grape to them, but being the first in the Way, she came before the Harbour the 29th, where learning no News, the <HI>Swallow,</HI> without losing Time, steered for the River <HI>Gabone,</HI> and anchored at the Mouth of it, <HI>February</HI> the 1st.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="216"/>
This River is navigable by two Channels, and has an Island about five Leagues up, call'd <HI>Popaguays,</HI> or <HI>Parrots,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch</HI> Cruisers, for this Coast, generally Clean, and where sometimes Pyrates come in to look for Prey, or to Resit, it being very convenient, by Reason of a soft Mud about it, that admits a Ship's lying on Shore, with all her Guns and Stores in, without Damage. Hither Captain <HI>Ogle</HI> sent his Boat and a Lieutenant, who spoke with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, above the Island, from whom he had this short Account, <HI>viz.</HI> That he had been four Days from Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> and had left no Ship there. However, they beat up for the Cape, with∣out regard to this Story, and on the 5th, at Dawn∣ing, was surprized with the Noise of a Gun, which as the Day brightened, they found was from Cape <HI>Lopez</HI> Bay; where they discovered three Ships at Anchor, the largest with the King's Colours, and Pendant flying; which was soon concluded to be Mr. <HI>Roberts,</HI> and his Consorts; but the <HI>Swallow</HI> be∣ing to windward, and unexpectedly deep in the Bay, were obliged to Steer off, for avoiding a Sand, called, the <HI>French Man's Bank,</HI> which they ob∣serving for some Time, and rashly interpreting it to be Fear in her, righted the <HI>French Ranger,</HI> which was then on the Heel, and ordered her to Chase out in all hast after her, bending several of their Sails in the Pursuit. The Man of War finding they had foolishly mistaken her Design, humour'd the Deceit, and kept off to Sea, as if she had been really afraid, and managed her Steerage so, as to let the <HI>Ranger</HI> come up with her, when they thought they had got so far as not to have their Guns heard by her Consort at the Cape. The Pyrates had such an Opinion of their own Courage, that they could never dream, that any Body would use a Stratagem to speak with them, and so was the more easily drawn into the Snare.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="217"/>
The Pyrates now drew nigh enough to fire their Chase Guns; they hoisted the black Flag that was worn in <HI>Whydah</HI> Road, and got their Spritsail Yard along-ships, with Intent to board; no one having ever asked, all this while, what Country Ship they took the Chase to be; but they would have her to be a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> because they wanted Sugar for their Punch, and they thought of nothing else. It was with the utmost Consternation, they saw her bring too, and hawl up their lower Ports, now within Pistol-Shot, and struck their black Flag up∣on it directly; tho' after the first Surprize was over, they kept firing at a Distance, hoisted it again, and vapoured with their Cutlashes on the Poop, tho' they endeavoured to run away. Being now at their Wits end, boarding was proposed by the Heads of them, and so to make one desperate Push; but the Motion not being well seconded, and their Main-Top-Mast coming down by a Shot, after two Hours firing, it was declined; they grew Sick, struck their Colours, and called out for Quarters; having had 10 Men killed out right, and 20 wound∣ed, without the loss or hurt of one of the King's Men. She had 32 Guns, mann'd with 16 <HI>French</HI> Men, 20 Negroes, and 77 <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>While the <HI>Swallow</HI> was sending their Boat to fetch the Prisoners, a Blast and Smoak, was seen to pour out of the great Cabin, and they thought they were blowing up; but upon enquiry afterwards found, that half a dozen of the most Desperate, when they saw all hopes fled, had drawn them∣selves round what Powder they had left, in the Steerage, and fired a Pistol into it, but it was too small a Quantity to effect any Thing more, than burning them in a frightful Manner.</P>
<P>This Ship was commanded by one <HI>Skyrme,</HI> a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, who, tho' he had lost his Leg in the Action, would not suffer himself to be dressed, or
<PB N="211" REF="218"/>
carried off the Deck, but like <HI>Widrington,</HI> fought upon his Stump. The rest appeared gay and brisk, most of them with white Shirts, Watches, and a deal of Silk Vests, but the Gold-Dust belonging to them, was most of it in the little <HI>Ranger,</HI> left in the Bay with the <HI>Royal Fortune;</HI> so that not above 300 l. come out of her. They then enquired for the Colours, but found they were thrown over∣board, I suppose, from a Fancy they would be dis∣play'd, in a of kind Triumph, over them.</P>
<P>They secured the Prisoners with Pinions, and Shackles, but the Ship was so much disabled in the Engagement, that they had once Thoughts to set her on Fire; but as this would have given them the trouble of taking the Pyrates wounded Men on Board themselves, and that they were certain the <HI>Royal Fortune</HI> would wait for their Return, they lay by her two Days, repaired her Rigging and other Damages, and sent her into <HI>Princess,</HI> with the <HI>French</HI> Men, and four of their own Hands.</P>
<P>On the 9th in the Evening, the <HI>Swallow</HI> gained the Cape again, and saw the <HI>Royal Fortune</HI> standing into the Bay with the <HI>Neptune,</HI> Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> of <HI>London:</HI> A good Presage of the next Days Success, for they did not doubt but the Temptation of Liquor, and Plunder, they might find in this their new Prize, would make the Pyrates very confused; and so it hap∣pened.</P>
<P>On the 10th, in the Morning, the Man of War bore away to round the Cape. <HI>Robert</HI>'s Crew dis∣cerning their Masts over the Land, went down into the Cabin; to acquaint him of it, he being then at Breakfast with his new Guest, Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> on a savory Dish of Solomongundy, and some of his own Beer. He took no Notice of it, and his Men almost as little, some saying she was a <HI>Por∣tuguese</HI> Ship, others a <HI>French</HI> Slave Ship, but the major Part swore it was the <HI>French Ranger</HI> return∣ing,
<PB N="212" REF="219"/>
and were merrily debating for some Time, on the Manner of Reception, whether they should salute, or not; but as the <HI>Swallow</HI> approach'd nigher, Things appeared plainer, and tho' they were stigmatiz'd with the Name of Cowards, who shewed any apprehension of Danger; yet some of them now undeceived, declared it to <HI>Roberts,</HI> e∣pecially one <HI>Armstrong,</HI> who had deserted from that Ship, and knew her well: Those <HI>Roberts</HI> swore at as Cowards, who meant to dishearten the Men, asking them if it were so, whether they were afraid to fight, or no? And hardly refrained from Blows. What his own Apprehensions were, till she hawl∣ed up her Ports, and hoisted their proper Colours, is uncertain; but then being perfectly convinced, he slipped his Cable, got under Sail, and ordered his Men to Arms, without any shew of Timidity, dropping a first Rath Oath, <HI>that it was a Bite, but, at the same Time, resolved, like a gallant Rogue, to get clear, or die.</HI></P>
<P>There was one <HI>Armstrong,</HI> as I just mention'd, a Deserter from the <HI>Swallow,</HI> whom they enquired of concerning the Trim and sailing of that Ship; he told them she sail'd best upon a Wind, and therefore, if they designed to leave her, they should go before it.</P>
<P>The Danger was imminent, and Time very short, to consult of Means to extricate himself; his Reso∣lution in this Streight, was as follows: To Pass close to the <HI>Swallow,</HI> with all their Sails, and receive her Broadside, before they returned a Shot; if disabled by this, or that they could not depend on sailing, then to run on Shore at the Point, (which is steep to,) and every one to shift for himself among the Negroes; or failing in these, to board, and blow up together, for he saw the greatest part of his Men drunk, passively Couragious, unfit for Service.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="220"/>
<HI>Roberts</HI> himself made a gallant Figure, at the Time of the Engagement, being dressed in a rich crimson Damask Wastcoat, and Breeches, a red Feather in his Hat, and a Gold Chain ten Times round his Neck, a Sword in his Hand, and two pair of Pistols hanging at the End of a Silk Sling, which was flung over his Shoulders (according to the Fashion of the Pyrates;) and is said to have given his Orders with Boldness, and Spirit; com∣ing, according to what he had purposed, close to the Man of War, received her Fire, and then hoisted his Black Flag, and returned it, shoot∣ing away from her, with all the Sail he could pack; and had he took <HI>Armstrong</HI>'s Advice, to have gone before the Wind, he had probably escaped; but keeping his Tacks down, either by the Winds shifting, or ill Steerage, or both, he was taken a-back with his Sails, and the <HI>Swallow</HI> came a second Time very nigh to him: He had now perhaps finished the Fight very desperatly, if Death who took a swift Passage, in a Grape-Shot, had not inter∣posed, and struck him directly on the Throat. He settled himself on the Tackles of a Gun, which one <HI>Stephenson,</HI> from the Helm, observing, ran to his Assistance, and not perceiving him wounded, swore at him, and bid him stand up, and fight like a Man; but when he found his Mistake, and that his Captain was certainly dead, he gushed into Tears, and wished the next Shot might be his Lot. They presently threw him over-board, with his Arms, and Ornaments on, according to the repeat∣ed Request, he had made in his Life-time.</P>
<P><HI>Roberts</HI> was a tall black Man, near forty Years of Age, born at <HI>Newey-bagh,</HI> nigh <HI>Haverford-West,</HI> in <HI>Pembrokshire,</HI> of good natural Parts, and personal Bravery, tho' he applied them to such wicked Purposes, as made them of no Commendation, fre∣quently drinking <HI>D—n to him who ever lived to</HI>
<PB N="214" REF="221"/>
<HI>wear a Halter.</HI> Yet among all the vile and ignomi∣nious Acts he had perpetrated, he is said to have had an Aversion towards forcing of Men into that Service, and had procured some their Discharge, notwithstanding so many made it their Plea.</P>
<P>When <HI>Roberts</HI> was gone, as tho' he had been the Life and Soul of the Gang, their Spirits sunk; many deserted their Quarters, and all stupidly neg∣lected any Means for Defence, or Escape; and their Main-Mast soon after being shot away, they had nothing left, but to Surrender and call for Quar∣ters. The <HI>Swallow</HI> kept aloof, while her Boat passed, and repassed for the Prisoners; because they understood they were under an Oath to blow up; and some of the Desperadoes shewed a Willingness that Way, Matches being lighted, and Scuffles hap∣pening between those who would, and those who opposed it: But I cannot easily Account for this Humour, which can be term'd no more than a false Courage, since any of them had Power to destroy his own Life, either by Pistol, or Drown∣ing, without involving others in the same Fate, who are in no Temper of Mind for it: And at best, it had been only dying, for fear of Death.</P>
<P>She had 40 Guns, and 157 Men, 45 whereof were Negroes; three only were killed in the Action, without any loss to the <HI>Swallow.</HI> There was found upwards of 4000 l. in Gold-Dust in her.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> returned back into Cape <HI>Lopez</HI> Bay, and found the little <HI>Ranger,</HI> whom the Pyrates had deserted in hast, for the better Defence of the Ship: She had been plundered, according to what I could learn, of 2000 l. in Gold-Dust, (the Shares of those who belonged to her;) and Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> in the <HI>Neptune,</HI> taken the Day before the Action, by <HI>Roberts,</HI> was so just as to return (unasked) to the Value of 50 Ounces, at <HI>Barbadoes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="222"/>
To Sum up the whole, if it be considered, first, that the Sickly State of the Men of War, when they sail'd from <HI>Princess,</HI> was the Misfortune that hin∣dered their being as far as <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> and conse∣quently out of the Track they then took. That those Pyrates, directly contrary to their Design, in the second Expedition, should get above Cape <HI>Corso,</HI> and that nigh <HI>Axim,</HI> a Chace should offer, that inevitably must discover them, and be soon communicated to the Men of War. That the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ati∣ating their evil and malicious Tempers at <HI>Whydah,</HI> in burning the <HI>Porcupine,</HI> and running off with the <HI>French</HI> Ship, had strengthened the <HI>Swallow</HI> with 30 Men. That the <HI>Swallow</HI> should miss them in that Road, where probably she had not, or at least so effectual∣ly obtained her End. That they should be so far infatuated at Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> as to divide their Strength, which when collected, might have been so formidable. And lastly, that the Conquest should be without Bloodshed: I say, considering all these Circumstances, it shews that the Hand of Provi∣dence was concerned in their Destruction.</P>
<P>As to their Behaviour after they were taken, it was found that they had great Inclinations to rebel, if they could have laid hold of any Opportunity. First, That they were very uneasy under a Restraint, they having been lately all Commanders themselves; nor could they brook their Diet, or Quarters, without cursing or swearing, and upbraiding each other, with the Folly that had brought them to it.</P>
<P>So that to secure themselves against any mad desperate Undertaking of their's, they strongly barricado'd the Gun-Room, and made another Pri∣son before it; an Officer, with Pistols and Cut∣lashes, doing Duty, Night and Day, and the Pri∣soners within, manacled and shackled.</P>
<P>They would yet in these Circumstances be im∣pudently merry, saying, when they viewed their

Nakedness, <HI>that they had not left them a half penny, to give old</HI> Charon, <HI>to ferry them over</HI> Stix: And at their thin Commons, they would observe, that they fell away so fast, that they should not have Weight left to hand them. <HI>Sutton</HI> used to be very pro∣phane, he happening to be in the same Irons with another Prisoner, who was more serious than ordi∣nary, and read and pray'd often, as became his Condition; this Man <HI>Sutton</HI> used to swear at, and ask him, <HI>what he proposed by so much Noise and De∣votion? Heaven,</HI> says the other, <HI>I hope. Heaven, you Fool,</HI> says Sutton, <HI>did you ever hear of any Pyrates going thither? Give me H—ll, it's a merrier Place: I'll give</HI> Ro∣berts <HI>a Salute of</HI> 13 <HI>Guns at Entrance.</HI> And when he found such ludicrous Expressions had no Effect on him, he made a formal Complaint, and requested that the Officer would either remove this Man, or take his Prayer-Book away, as a common Disturber.</P>
<P>A Combination, and Conspiracy was formed, be∣twixt <HI>Moody, Ashplant, Magnes, Mare,</HI> and others, to rise, and kill the Officers, and run away with the Ship. This they had carried on by Means of a Mulatto Boy, who was allowed to attend them, and prov'd very trusty in his Messages, between the Principals; but the Evening of that Night they were to have made this Struggle, two of the Prisoners that sat next to <HI>Ashplant,</HI> heard the Boy whisper him upon the Project, and naming to him the Hour they should be ready, presently gave Notice of it to the Captain, which put the Ship in an Alarm, for a little Time; and, on Examina∣tion, several of them had made shift to break off, or lose their Shackles, (no doubt for such purpose;) but it tended only to procure to themselves worse Usage and Confinement.</P>
<P>In the same Passage to Cape <HI>Corso,</HI> the Prize, <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> was in the same Danger. She was
<PB N="217" REF="224"/>
left at the Island of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, in the Possession of an Officer, and a few Men, to take in some fresh Provisions,) which were scarce at Cape <HI>Corso,)</HI> with Orders to follow the Ship. There were only some of the Pyrate's Negroes, three or four wound∣ed Prisoners, and <HI>Scudamore,</HI> their Surgeon; from whom their seemed to be under no Apprehension, es∣pecially from the last, who might have hoped for Favour, on Account of his Employ; and had stood so much indebted for his Liberty, eating and drinking constantly with the Officer; yet this Fellow, regardless of the Favour, and lost to all Sense of Reformation, endeavoured to bring over the Negroes to his Design of murdering the Peo∣ple, and running away with the Ship. He easily prevailed with the Negroes to come into the De∣sign; but when he came to communicate it to his Fellow Prisoners, and would have drawn them into the same Measures, by telling them, he understood Navigation, that the Negroes were stout Fellows, and by a smattering he had in the <HI>Angolan</HI> Lan∣guage, he had found willing to undertake such an Enterprize; and that it was better venturing to do this, run down the Coast, and raise a new Company, than to proceed to Cape <HI>Corso,</HI> and be hang'd like a Dog, and Sun dry'd. One of them abhoring the Cruelty, or fearing the Success, discovered it to the Officer, who made him immediately a Pri∣soner, and brought the Ship safe.</P>
<P>When they came to be lodg'd in Cape <HI>Corso-Castle,</HI> their Hopes of this kind all cut off, and that they were assured they must there soon receive a final Sentence; the Note was changed among most of them, and from vain insolent jesting, they became serious and devout, begging for good Books, and joining in publick Prayers, and singing of Psalms, twice at least every Day.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="225"/>
We think it unnecessary to burthen the Readers with the particular Tryals, which we are sensible in their Nature, must grow tiresome and flat, like Sessions Papers, the Repetition of the same sort of Evidence and Defence, over, and over again; I shall therefore give a few of the most re∣markable, with Observations on the dying Beha∣viour of such of them, as came to my Knowledge.</P>
<P>And first, it may be observed from the List, that a great Part of these Pyrate Ships Crews, were Men entered on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> not many Months before they were taken; from whence, it may be concluded, that the pretended Constraint of <HI>Roberts,</HI> on them, was very often a Complotment between Parties equally willing: And this <HI>Roberts</HI> several Times openly declared, particularly to the <HI>Onslow</HI>'s People, whom he call∣ed aft, and ask'd of them, <HI>who was willing to go, for he would force no Body?</HI> As was deposed, by some of his best Hands, after Aquittal; nor is it reasonable to think, he should reject <HI>Irish</HI> Voluntiers, only from a pique against <HI>Kennedy,</HI> and force others that might hazard, and, in Time, destroy his Go∣vernment: But their Behaviour soon put him out of this Fear, and convinc'd him, that the Plea of Force was only the best Artifice they had to shelter themselves under; in Case they should be taken, and that they were less Rogues than others, only in Point of Time.</P>
<P>It may likewise be taken Notice of, that the Country, wherein they happened to be tried, is among other Happinesses, exempted from Law∣vers, and Law-Books, so that the Office of Regi∣ster, of necessity fell on one, not versed in those Affairs, which might plead for want of Form, and justify the Court, who nevertheless voted with Integrity and Impartiality.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="226"/>
But, perhaps, if there was less Law, their might be more Justice, than in some other Courts; for, if the civil Law be that Law of universal Reason, judging of the Rectitude, or Iniquity, of Men's Actions, every Man of common Sense is endued with a Portion of it, at least sufficient to make him distinguish Right from Wrong, or what the Civilians call, <HI>Malum in se.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, here, if two Persons were equally Guilty of the same Fact, there was no convicting one, and bringing the other off, by any Quirk, or turn of Law; for they form'd their Judgments upon the Constraint, or Willingness, the Aim, and Intention, of the Parties, and all other Circum∣stances, which make a material Difference. Besides, in Crimes of this Nature, Men bred up to the Sea, must be more knowing, and much abler, than others more learned in the Law; for, before a Man can have a right Idea of a Thing, he must, know the Terms standing for that Thing: The Sea-Terms being a Language by it self, which no Law∣yer can be supposed to understand; he must of Consequence, want that discriminating Faculty, which should direct him to judge right of the Facts meant by those Terms.</P>
<P>The Court well knew, it was not possible to get the Evidence of every Sufferer by this Crew, and therefore, first of all, considered how that Deficien∣cy should be supplied; whether, or no, they could pardon one <HI>Jo. Dennis,</HI> who had early offered him∣self, as King's Evidence, and was the best read in their Lives and Conversations: Here indeed, they were at a loss for Law, and concluded in the Negative, losing by it, those great Helps he could have afforded.</P>
<P>Another great Difficulty in their Proceedings, was how to understand those Words in the Act of Parliament, of, <HI>particularly specifying in the Charge, the</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="227"/>
<HI>Circumstances of Time, Place,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> so to under∣stand them, as to be able to hold a Court; for if they had been indicted on particular Robberies, the Evidence had happened mostly from the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company's Ships, on which these Gentle∣men of Cape <HI>Corso-Castle,</HI> were not qualify'd to sit, their Oath running, <HI>That they have no Interest directly, or indirectly, in the Ship, or Goods, for the Robbery of which, the Party stands accused:</HI> And this they thought they had, Commissions being paid them, on such Goods: And on the other Side, if they were in∣capacitated, no Court could be formed, the Commi∣ssion absolutely requiring three of them by Name.</P>
<P>To reconcile all Things, therefore, the Court resolved, to bottom the whole of their Proceedings on the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s Depositions, which were clear and plain, and had the Circumstance of Time when, Place where, Manner how, and the like, particu∣larly specified according to the Statute in that Case made, and provided. But this admitted only a general Intimation of Robbery, in the Indictment, therefore <HI>to approve their Clemency,</HI> it looking Arbitrary on the Lives of Men, to lump them to the Gallows, in such a summary Way as must have been done, had they solely adhered to the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s Charge, they resolved to come to particular Tryals.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That the Prisoners might not be Ignorant whereon to Answer,</HI> and so have all fair Advantages, to excuse and defend themselves; which must re∣commend the Justice, and Integrity, of the Court, who heard, with all Patience, any Evidence that could be brought, to weaken or coroborate the three Circumstances that compleat a Pyrate; first, being a Voluntier amongst them at first; secondly, being a Voluntier at the taking or robbing of any Ship, or lastly; voluntarily accepting a Share in the Booty of those that did; for by a Parity of Reason, where these Actions were of their own
<PB N="221" REF="228"/>
disposing, and yet committed by them, it must be believed their Hearts and Hands joined together, in what they acted against his Majesty's Ship, the <HI>Swallow.</HI></P>

<HEAD>You, <HI>James Skyrm, Michael Lemmon, Robert Hart∣ley, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>YE, and every one of you, are in the Name, and by the the Authority, of our dread Sovereign Lord,</HI> George, <HI>King of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>indicted as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Forasmuch as in open Contempt of the Laws of your Country, ye have all of you been wickedly united, and arti∣cled together, for the Annoyance and Disturbance of his Majesty's trading Subjects by Sea. And have in Confor∣mity to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st evil and mischievous Intentions, been twice down the Coast of</HI> Africa, <HI>with two Ships; once in the beginning of</HI> August, <HI>and a second Time, in</HI> January <HI>last, sinking, burning, or robbing such Ships, and Vessels, as then happened in your Way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Particularly, ye stand charged at the Instance, and In∣formation of Captain</HI> Chaloner Ogle, <HI>as Traytors, and Pyrates, for the unlawful Opposition ye made to his Ma∣jesty's Ship, the</HI> Swallow, <HI>under his Command.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For that, on the 5th of</HI> February, <HI>last past, upon sight of the aforesaid King's Ship, ye did immediately weigh Anchor from under Cape</HI> Lopez, <HI>on the Southern Coast of</HI> Africa, <HI>in a</HI> French <HI>built Ship of</HI> 32 <HI>Guns, called the</HI> Ranger, <HI>and did Pursue, and Chase the aforesaid King's Ship, with such Dispatch and Precipitancy, as declared ye common Robbers, and Pyrates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That about ten of the Clock the same Morning, drawing within Gun-shot of his Majesty's aforesaid Ship, the</HI> Swal∣low, <HI>ye hoisted a pyratical black Flag, and fired several</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="232"/>
<HI>Chace Guns, to deter as much as ye were able, his Majesty's Servants from their Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That an Hour after this, being very nigh to the afore∣said King's Ship, ye did audaciously continue in a ho∣stile Defence and Assault, for about two Hours more, in open Violation of all Laws, and in Defiance of the King's Colours, and Commission.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And lastly, that in the acting, and compassing of all this, ye were all and every one of you, in a wicked Combina∣tion, voluntarily to exert, and actually did, in your several Stations, use your utmost Endeavours, to distress the said King's Ship, and murder his Majesty's good Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>To which they severally pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court called for the Officers of the <HI>Swallow,</HI> Mr. <HI>Isaac Sun,</HI> Lieutenant, <HI>Ralph Baldrick,</HI> Boatswain, <HI>Daniel Maclaughlin,</HI> Mate, desiring them to view the Prisoners, whether they knew them? And to give an Account in what Manner they had attack'd, and fought the King's Ship; and they agreed as follows.</P>
<P>That they had viewed all the Prisoners, as they stood now before the Court, and were assured they were the same taken out of one, or other, of the Pyrate Ships, <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Ranger;</HI> but verily believe them to be those taken out of the <HI>Ranger.</HI></P>
<P>That they did in the King's Ship, at break of Day, on <HI>Monday,</HI> the 5th of <HI>February,</HI> 1721-2, dis∣cover three Ships at Anchor, under Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> on the Southern Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI> the Cape bear∣ing then, W. S. W. about three Leagues, and perceiving one of them to have a Pendant flying, and having heard their Morning-Gun before, they immediately suspected them to be, <HI>Roberts</HI> the Py∣rate, his Consort, and a <HI>French</HI> Ship, they knew had been lately carried out of <HI>Whydah</HI> Road.</P>
<P>The King's Ship was obliged to hawl off N. W. and W. N. W. to avoid a Sand called, the
<PB N="226" REF="233"/>
<HI>French Man's Bank,</HI> the Wind then at S. S. E. and found in half an Hours-Time, one of the three had got under Sail from the Careen, and was bend∣ing her Sails, in a Chace towards them. To encou∣rage this Rashness and Precipitancy, they kept away before the Wind, (as tho' afraid,) but with their Tacks on Board, their Main-Yard braced, and making, at the same Time, very bad Steerage.</P>
<P>About half an Hour after ten, in the Morning, the Pyrate Ship came within Gun-shot, and fired four Chace Guns, hoisted a black Flag at the Mizen-Peek, and got their Sprit-sail Yard under their Bow-sprit, for boarding. In half an Hour more, approaching still nigher, they Starboarded their Helm, and gave her a Broadside, the Pyrate bringing too, and returning the same.</P>
<P>After this, the Deponents say, their Fire grew slack for some Time, because the Pyrate was shot so far a Head on the Weather-Bow, that few of their Guns could Point to her; yet in this In∣terval their black Flag was either Shot away, or hawled down, a little Space, and hoisted again.</P>
<P>At length, by their ill Steerage, and favour of the Wind, they came near, a second Time; and about two in the Afternoon, shot away their Main∣topmast.</P>
<P>The Colours they sought under, besides a black Flag,) were a red <HI>English</HI> Ensign, a King's Jack, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pendant, which they struck at, or about, three in the Afternoon, and called for Quarters; it proving to be a <HI>French</HI> built Ship of 32 Guns, called the <HI>Ranger.</HI></P>
<P>Isaac Sun,</P>
<P>Ralph Baldrick,</P>
<P>Daniel Maclauglin.</P>
<P>When the Evidence had been heard, the Priso∣ners were called upon to answer, how they came
<PB N="227" REF="234"/>
on Board this Pyrate Ship; and their Reason for so audacious a Resistance, as hath been made against the King's Ship.</P>
<P>To this, each, in his Reply, owned himself to be one of those taken out of the <HI>Ranger;</HI> that he had signed their pyratical Articles, and shared in their Plunder, some few only excepted, who had been there too short a Time. But that neither in this signing, or sharing, nor in the Resistance had been made against his Majesty's Ship, had they been Voluntiers, but had acted in these several Parts, from a Terror of Death; which by a Law amongst them, was to be the Portion of those who refused. The Court then ask'd, who made those Laws? How those Guns came to be fired? Or why they had not deserted their Stations, and mutinied, when so fair a Prospect of Redemption offered? They replied still, with the same Answers, and could extenuate their Crimes, with no other Plea, than being forced Men. Wherefore the Court were of Opinion, that the Indictment, as it charg∣ed them with an unlawful Attack and Resistance, of the King's Ship, was sufficiently proved; but then it being undeniably evident, that many of these Prisoners had been forced, and some of them of very short standing, they did, on mature De∣liberation, come to this merciful Resolution.</P>
<P>That they would hear further Evidence for, or against, each Person singly, in relation to those Parts of the Indictment, which declared them Voluntiers, or charged them with aiding and assisting, at the burning, sinking, or robbing of other Ships; for if they acted, or assisted, in any Robberies, or Devastations, it would be a Conviction they were Voluntiers; here such Evidence, tho it might want the Form, still carried the Reason of the Law with it.</P>

The Charge was exhibited, also against the follow∣ing Pyrates taken out of the <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>

<HEAD>You, <HI>Harry Glasby, William Davison, William Champ∣nies, Samuel Morwell, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>YE, and every one of you, are, in the Name, and by the Authority of our most dread Sovereign Lord</HI> George, <HI>King of</HI> Great Britain, <HI>indicated as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Forasmuch as in open Contempt, and Violation of the Laws of your Country, (to which ye ought to have been Sub∣ject,) ye have all of you, been wickedly united and arti∣ced together, for the Annoyance and Destruction of his Majesty's trading Subjects by Sea, and in Conformity to so wicked an Agreement, and Association: Ye have twice lately been down this Coast of</HI> Africa, <HI>once in</HI> August, <HI>and a second Time in</HI> January <HI>last, spoiling and destroy∣ing many Goods and Vessels, of his Majesty's Subjects, and other trading Nations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Particularly ye stand indicted at the Information and Instance of Captain</HI> Chal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner Ogle, <HI>as Traytors, Rob∣bers, Pyrates, and common Enemies to Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For that on the 10th of</HI> February <HI>last, in a Ship ye were possess'd of, called the</HI> Royal Fortune, <HI>of</HI> 40 <HI>Guns, ye did maintain a hostile Defence and Resistance, for some Hours, against his Majesty's Ship the</HI> Swallow, <HI>nigh Cape</HI> Lopez <HI>Bay, on the Southern Coast of</HI> Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="238"/>
<HI>That this Fight, and insolent Resistance, against the King's Ship, was made, not only without any Pretence of Authority, more than that of your own private depraved Wills, but was done also under a black Flag, flagrantly by that, denoting your selves common Robbers, and Traitors, Opposers, and Violators of the Laws.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And lastly, that in this Resistance, ye were all of you Voluntiers, and did, as such, contribute your utmost Ef∣forts, for disabling and distressing the aforesaid King's Ship, and deterring his Majesty's Servants therein, from their Duty.</HI></P>
<P>To which they severally pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon, the Officers of his Majesty's Ship, the <HI>Swallow,</HI> were called again, and testify'd as follows.</P>
<P>That they had seen all the Prisoners now before the Court, and knew them to be the same which were taken out of one or other of the Pyrate Ships, <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> or <HI>Ranger,</HI> but verily believe them, to be those taken out of the <HI>Royal Fortune.</HI></P>
<P>That the Prisoners were possess'd of a Ship of 40 Guns, call'd the <HI>Royal Fortune,</HI> and were at an Anchor under Cape <HI>Lopez,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> with two others: When his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Swallow,</HI> (to which the Deponents belong'd, and were Officers,) stood in for the Place on <HI>Saturday,</HI> the 10th of <HI>February,</HI> 1721-2. the largest had a Jack, Ensign, and Pendant flying, (being this <HI>Royal For∣tune,)</HI> who on Sight of them, had their Boats passing, and repassing, from the other two, which they supposed to be with Men; the Wind not favouring the aforesaid King's Ship, she was oblig∣ed to make two Trips, to gain nigh enough the Wind, to fetch in with the Pyrate; and being at length little more than random Shot from them, they found she slipped her Cable, and got under Sail.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="239"/>
At eleven, the Pyrate was within Pistol-Shot, a breast of them, with a black Flag, and Pendant hoisted at their Main-topmast Head. The Depo∣nents say, they then struck the <HI>French</HI> Ensign, that had continued hoisted at their Staff all the Morn∣ing till then; and display'd the King's Colours, giving her, at the same Time, their Broadside, which was immediately returned.</P>
<P>The Pyrate's Mizen-topmast fell, and some of her Rigging was torn, yet she still out sail'd the Man of War, and slid half Gun-Shot from them, while they continued to Fire, without Intermission, and the other to return such Guns, as could be brought to bear, till by favour of the Winds, they were advanced very nigh again; and after exchanging a few more Shot, about half an Hour past one, his Main-Mast came down, having received a Shot a little below the Parrel.</P>
<P>At two, she struck her Colours, and call'd for Quarters, proving to be a Ship, formerly called the <HI>Onslow,</HI> but by them, the <HI>Royal Fortune;</HI> and the Prisoners from her, assured them, that the smallest Ship of the two, then remaining in the Road, belonged to them, by the Name of the <HI>little Ran∣ger,</HI> which they had deserted on this Occasion.</P>
<P>Isaac Sun,</P>
<P>Ralph Baldrick,</P>
<P>Daniel Maclauglin.</P>
<P>The Prisoners were ask'd by the Court, to the same Purpose the others had been in the Morn∣ing; what Exception they had to make against what had been Sworn? And what they had to say in their Defence? And their Reply were much the same with the other Prisoners; that they were forc'd Men, had not fired a Gun in this Re∣sistance against the <HI>Swallow,</HI> and that what little Assistance they did give on this Occasion, was to
<PB N="233" REF="240"/>
the Sails and Rigging, to comply with the arbitra∣ry Commands of <HI>Roberts,</HI> who had threatned, and they were perswaded, would have Shot them on Refusal.</P>
<P>The Court to dispense equal Justice, mercifully re∣solved for these, as they had done for the other Pyrate Crew; that further Evidence should be heard against each Man singly, to the two Points, of being a Voluntier at first, and to their particular Acts of Pyracy and Robbery since: That so Men, who had been lately received amongst them, and as yet, had not been at the taking, or plundering, of any Ship, might have the Opportunity, and Benefit, of clearing their Innocence, and not fall promiscuously with the Guilty.</P>
<P><HI>By Order of the Court,</HI></P>
<P>John Atkins, <HI>Register.</HI></P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>William Philips.</HEAD>
<P>IT appeared by the Evidence of Captain <HI>Jo. Tra∣hern,</HI> and <HI>George Fenn,</HI> Mate, of the King <HI>Solomon,</HI> that this Prisoner was Boatswain of the same Ship, when she was attacked, and taken, off Cape <HI>Appo∣lonia,</HI> the 6th of <HI>January</HI> last, by the Pyrate's Boat.</P>
<P>When the Boat drew nigh, (they say) it was judged from the Number of Men in her, that they were Pyrates, and being hailed, answer'd, <HI>Defiance;</HI> at which the Commander snatch'd a Musquet from one of his Men, and fired, asking them at the same Time, whether they would stand by him, to defend the Ship? But the Pyrates returning a Vol∣ley, and crying out, they would give no Quarters if any Resistance was made, this Prisoner took upon him to call out for Quarters, without the Master's Consent, and mislead the rest, to laying down their Arms, and giving up the Ship, to half the Number of Men, and in an open Boat. It was
<PB N="234" REF="241"/>
further evident he became, after this, a Voluntier amongst them. First, because he was presently very forward and brisk, in robbing the Ship, <HI>King Solomon,</HI> of her Provisions and Stores. Secondly, because he endeavoured to have his Captain ill used; and lastly, because he had confess'd to <HI>Fenn,</HI> that he had been obliged to sign their Articles that Night, (a Pistol being laid on the Table, to signi∣fy, he must do it, or be Shot,) when the whole appeared to be an Untruth from other Evidence, who also asserted, his being armed, in the Action against the <HI>Swallow.</HI></P>
<P>In answer to this, he first observed upon the Un∣happiness of being friendless in this Part of the World, which, elsewhere, by witnessing to the Ho∣nesty of his former Life, would, he believed, in a great Measure, have invalidated the wrong Evi∣dence had been given, of his being a Voluntier with the Pyrates. He owns indeed, he made no Applica∣tion to his Captain, to intercede for a Discharge, but excuses it with saying, he had a dislike to him, and therefore was sure that such Application would have avail'd him nothing.</P>
<P>The Court observed the Pretences of this, and other of the Pyrates, of a Pistol, and their Arti∣cles, being served up in a Dish together, or of their being misused and forced from an honest Service, was often a Complotment of the Parties, to ren∣der them less suspected of those they came from, and was to answer the End of being put in a News-Paper, or Affidavit: And the Pyrates were so ge∣nerous as not to refuse a Compliment to a Brother that cost them nothing, and, at the same Time, secured them the best Hands; the best, I call them, because such a Dependance made them act more boldly. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="235" REF="242"/>
<HEAD><HI>Harry Glasby,</HI> Master.</HEAD>
<P>THere appearing several Persons in Court, who had been taken by <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Ship, whereof the Prisoner was Master, their Evidence was accepted as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Jo. Trahern,</HI> Commander of the <HI>King Soloman,</HI> de∣posed, the Prisoner, indeed, to act as Master of the Pyrate Ship (while he was under Restraint there) but was observed like no Master, every one obey∣ing at Discretion, of which he had taken Notice, and complained to him, how hard a Condition it was, to be a Chief among Brutes; that he was weary of his Life, and such other Expressions, (now out of his Memory,) as shew'd in him a great Disin∣clination to that Course of Living.</P>
<P><HI>Jo. Wingfield,</HI> a Prisoner with them at <HI>Calabar,</HI> says the same, as to the Quality he acted in, but that he was Civil beyond any of them, and verily believes, that when the Brigantine he served on Board of, as a Factor for the <HI>African</HI> Company, was voted to be burnt, this Man was the Instrument of pre∣venting it, expressing himself with a great deal of Sorrow, for this, and the like malicious Rogueries of the Company he was in; that to him shewed, he had acted with Reluctancy, as one who could not avoid what he did. He adds further, that when one <HI>Hamilton,</HI> a Surgeon, was taken by them, and the Articles about to be imposed on him, he op∣posed, and prevented it. And that <HI>Hunter,</HI> another Surgeon, among them, was cleared at the Prisoners Instance and Perswasion; from which last, this Deponent had it assured to him, that <HI>Glasby</HI> had once been under Sentence of Death, on Board of them, with two more, for endeavouring an Escape in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and that the other two were really Shot for it.</P>
<P><HI>Elizabeth Trengrove,</HI> who was taken a Passenger in the <HI>African</HI> Company's Ship <HI>Onslow,</HI> strengthen'd the
<PB N="236" REF="243"/>
Evidence of the last Witness, for having heard a good Character of this <HI>Glasby,</HI> she enquired of the Quarter-Master, who was then on Board a robbing, whether or no she could see him? And he told her, <HI>No;</HI> they never ventured him from the Ship, for he had once endeavoured his Escape, and they had ever since continued jealous of him.</P>
<P><HI>Edward Crisp,</HI> Captain <HI>Trengrove,</HI> and Captain <HI>Sharp,</HI> who had all been taken in their Turns, acknow∣ledge for themselves and others, who had unluckily fallen into those Pyrates Hands, that the good Usage they had met with, was cheifly thro' the Prisoners Means, who often interposed, for leaving sufficient Stores and Instruments on Board the Ships they had robbed, alledging, they were superfluous and unnecessary there.</P>
<P><HI>James White,</HI> whose Business was Musick, and was on the Poop of the Pyrate Ship in Time of Action with the <HI>Swallow,</HI> deposed, that during the Engage∣ment, and Defence she made, he never saw the Pri∣soner busied about the Guns, or giving Orders either to the loading, or firing of them; but that he wholly attended to the setting, or triming, of the Sails, as <HI>Roberts</HI> commanded; and that in the Conclusion, he verily believed him to be the Man who prevented the Ships being blown up, by setting trusty Centinels below, and opposing himself against such hot headed Fellows, as had procured lighted Matches, and were going down for that Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Isaac Sun,</HI> Lieutenant of the Man of War, deposed, that when he came to take Possession of the Prize, in the King's Boat, he found the Pyrates in a very distracted and divided Condition; some being for blowing up, and others (who perhaps supposed themselves least culpable) opposing it: That in this Confusion he enquired for the Prisoner, of whom he had before heard a good Character; and

thinks he rendered all the Service in his Power, for preventing it; in particular, he understood by all Hands, that he had-seized, and taken, from one <HI>James Philips,</HI> a lighted Match, at the Instant he was going down to the Magazine, swearing, that that should send them all to H—l together. He had heard also, that after <HI>Roberts</HI> was killed, the Prisoner ordered the Colours to be struck; and had since shown, how opposite his Practice and Prin∣ciples had been, by discovering who were the greatest Rogues among them.</P>
<P>The Prisoner in his own Defence, says, when he had the Misfortune of falling into the Pyrates Hands, he was chief Mate of the <HI>Samuel,</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> Captain <HI>Cary,</HI> and when he had hid himself, to prevent the Design of carrying him away, they found him, and beat and threw him over-board. Seven Days afterwards, upon his objecting against, and refusing to sign their Articles, he was cut and abu∣sed again: That tho' after this, he ingratiated him∣self, by a more humble Carriage, it was only to make Life easy; the Shares they had given him, having been from Time to Time returned again, to such Pri∣soners as fell in his Way; till of late indeed, he had made a small Reservation, and had desired Captain <HI>Loan,</HI> to take two or three Moidores from him, to car∣ry to his Wife. He was once taken, he says, at ma∣king his Escape, in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and with two more sentenced to be Shot for it, by a drunken Jury; the latter actually suffered, and he was pre∣served only by one of the chief Pyrates taking a sudden liking to him, and bullying the others. A second Time he ran away at <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> carrying a Pocket Compass, for conducting him through the Woods, but that being a most desolate, and wild Part of the Island he fell upon, and he igno∣rant how to direct his Course, was obliged after two or three Days wandering, to return towards the
<PB N="238" REF="245"/>
Ship again, denying with egregious Oaths, the De∣sign he was charged with, for Fear they should shoot him. From this Time he hopes it will be some Extenuation of his Fault, that most of the acquitted Prisoners can Witness, they entertained Jealousies of him, and <HI>Roberts</HI> would not admit him into his Secrets; and withal, that Captain <HI>Cary,</HI> (and four other Passengers with him) had made Affidavit, of his having been forced from his Em∣ploy, which tho' he could not produce, yet he humbly hoped, the Court would think highly pro∣bable from the Circumstances offered.</P>
<P>On the whole, the Court was of Opinion, Ar∣tists had the best Pretension to the Plea of Force, from the Necessity Pyrates are sometimes under of engaging such, and that many Parts of his own Defence had been confirmed by the Evidence, who had asserted he acted with Reluctance, and had expressed a Concern and Trouble for the little Hopes remain'd to him, of extricating himself. That he had used all Prisoners (as they were called) well, at the hazard of ill Usage to himself. That he had not in any military Capacity assisted their Robberies. That he had twice endeavoured his Escape, with the utmost Danger. <HI>Acquitted him.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Captain <HI>James Skyrm.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT appeared from the Evidence of several Pri∣soners acquitted, that this <HI>Skyrm</HI> commanded the <HI>Ranger,</HI> in that Defence she made against the King's Ship; that he ordered the Men to their Quarters, and the Guns to be loaded, and fired, having a Sword in his Hand, to enforce those Com∣mands; and beat such to their Duty, whom he espied any way negligent, or backward. That altho' he had lost a Leg in the Action, his Temper was so warm, as to refuse going off the Deck, till he found all was lost.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="246"/>
In his Defence he says, he was forced from a Mates Employ on Board a Sloop, called the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> of St. <HI>Christophers, Oct.</HI> 1720. The Pyrate having drub∣bed him, and broke his Head, only for offering to go away when that Sloop was dismissed. Custom and Success had since indeed blunted, and, in some Measure, worn out the Sense of Shame; but that he had really for several Months past been Sick, and disqualified for any Duty, and tho' <HI>Roberts</HI> had forced him on this Expedition much against his Will, yet the Evidence must be sensible, the Title of Captain gave him no Preheminence, for he could not be obeyed, tho' he had often called to them, to leave off their Fire, when he perceived it to be the King's Ship.</P>
<P>The Sickness he alledged, but more especially the Circumstance of losing his Leg, were Aggravations of his Fault, shewing him more alert on such Occasions, than he was now willing to be thought: As to the Name of Captain, if it were allowed to give him no Precedence out of Battle, yet here it was prov'd a Title of Authority; such an Au∣thority as could direct an Engagement against the King's Colours, and therefore he was in the high∣est Degree, <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HI>Rogue, and has endeavoured to do me all the ill Offices he could among these Gentlemen, (i. e.</HI> Pyrates.)</P>
<P>And secondly, That he had signed the Pyrate's Articles with a great deal of Alacrity, and gloried in having been the first Surgeon that had done so, (for before this, it was their Custom to change their Surgeons, when they desired it, after ha∣ving served a Time, and never obliged them to sign, but he was resolved to break thro this, for the good of those who were to follow,) swearing immediately upon it, he was now, he hoped, as great a Rogue as any of them.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Jo. Trahern,</HI> and <HI>Geroge Fenn,</HI> his Mate, deposed the Prisoner to have taken out of the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> their Surgeon's capital Instruments, some Medicines, and a Back-Gammon Table; which latter became the Means of a Quarrel between one <HI>Wincon,</HI> and he, whose Property they should be, and were yielded to the Prisoner.</P>
<P><HI>Jo. Sharp,</HI> Master of the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> heard the Prisoner ask <HI>Roberts</HI> leave to force <HI>Comry,</HI> his Sur∣geon, from him, which was accordingly done, and with him, carried also some of the Ships Medi∣cines: But what gave a fuller Proof of the disho∣nesty of his Principles, was, the treacherous De∣sign he had formed of running away with the Prize, in her Passage to Cape <HI>Corso,</HI> tho' he had been treated with all Humanity, and very un∣like a Prisoner, on Account of his Employ and better Education, which had rendred him less to be suspected.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Child,</HI> (acquitted) depos'd, that in their Pas∣sage from the Island of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in the <HI>Fortune</HI> Prize, this Prisoner was several Times tempting him, into Measures of rising with the Negroes, and killing the <HI>Swallow</HI>'s People, shewing him, how easily the white Men might be demolished, and a new Company raised at <HI>Angola,</HI> and that Part of
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
the Coast, for says he, I understand how to Na∣vigate a Ship, and can soon teach you to Steer; and is it not better to do this, than to go back to Cape <HI>Corso,</HI> and be hanged and Sun-dry'd? To which the Deponent replying, he was not afraid of being hanged, <HI>Scudamore</HI> bid him be still, and no harm should come to him; but before the next Day-Evening, which was the designed Time of executing this Project, the Deponent discovered it to the Officer, and assured him, <HI>Scudamore</HI> had been talk∣ing all the preceeding Night to the Negroes, in <HI>Angolan</HI> Language.</P>
<P><HI>Isaac Barnet</HI> heard the Prisoner ask <HI>James Harris,</HI> a Pyrate, (left with the wounded in the Prize,) whether he was willing to come into the Project of running away with the Ship, and endeavour the raising of a new Company, but turned the Dis∣course to Horse Racing, as the Deponent crept nigher; he acquainted the Officer with what he had heard, who kept the People under Arms all Night, their Apprehensions of the Negroes not being groundless, for many of them having lived along Time in this pyratical Way, were by the thin Commons they were now reduced to, as ripe for Mischief as any.</P>
<P>The Prisoner in his Defence, said, he was a forced Man from Captain <HI>Rolls,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> last, and if he had not shewn such a Concern as became him, at the Alteration, he must remark the Occasion to be, the Disagreement and Enmity between them; but that both <HI>Roberts,</HI> and <HI>Val. Ashplant,</HI> threatned him into signing their Articles, and that he did it in Terror.</P>
<P>The <HI>King Solomon,</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> Medicine-Chest, he owns he plundered, by Order of <HI>Hunter,</HI> the then chief Surgeon, who, by the Pyrates Laws, always Directs in this <HI>Province,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Child,</HI> (tho' acquitted) had by the same Orders taken
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
out a whole <HI>French</HI> Medicine-Chest, which he must be sensible for me, as well as for himself, we nei∣ther of us dared to have denied; it was their being the proper Judges, made so ungrateful an Office imposed. If after this he was elected chief Surgeon himself, both <HI>Comry,</HI> and <HI>Wilson</HI> were set up also, and it might have been their Chance to have carried it, and as much out of their Power to have refused.</P>
<P>As to the Attempt of rising, and running away with the Prize, he denies it altogether as untrue; a few foolish Words, put only by way of Suppo∣sition, that if the Negroes should take it in their Heads, (considering the Weakness, and ill look-out that was kept;) it would have been an easy Matter, in his Opinion, for them to have done it; but that he encouraged such a Thing, was false, his talking to them in the <HI>Angolan</HI> Language, was only a Way of spending his Time, and trying his Skill, to tell twenty, he being incapable of fur∣ther Talk. As to his understanding Navigation, he had frequently acknowledg'd it to the Deponent Child, and wonders he should now so circumstan∣tiate this Skill against him. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<P>IT appeared to the Court, that the Prisoner was one of the twenty Men, in that Boat of the Pyrates, which afterwards robb'd the <HI>King Solomon,</HI> at an Anchor, near Cape <HI>Appollonia:</HI> That all Py∣rates on this, and the like Service, were Volun∣tiers, and he, in particular, had contested his going on Board a second Time, tho' out of his Turn.</P>
<P>The Prisoner, in his Defence, called for <HI>Harry Glasby,</HI> who witness'd to his being so very drunk, when he first came among their Crew, that they were forced to hoist him out of one Ship into the other, with a Tackle, and therefore without
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
his Consent; but had since been a trusty Man, and was placed to the Helm, in that running Battle they made with the <HI>Swallow.</HI></P>
<P>He insisted, for himself likewise, on Captain <HI>Tur∣ner</HI>'s Affidavit of his being forced, on which others (his Ship-mates) had been cleared.</P>
<P>The Court considering the Partiality that might be objected in acquitting one, and condemning another of the same standing, thought fit to re∣mark it, as a clear Testimony of their Integrity, that their Care and Indulgence to each Man, in allowing his particular Defence, was to exempt from the Rigour of the Law, such who, it must be allowed, would have stood too promiscuously con∣demned, if they had not been heard upon any other Fact than of the <HI>Swallow;</HI> and herein what could better direct them, than a Character and Behaviour from their own Associates; for tho' a voluntary Entry with the Pyrates may be doubt∣ful, yet his consequent Actions are not, and it is not so material how a Man comes among Pyrates, as how he Acts when he is there. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>George Wilson.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN Sharp,</HI> Master of the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in which Ship the Prisoner was Passenger, and fell a second Time into the Pyrates Hands, deposes, that he took the said <HI>Wilson</HI> off from <HI>Sestos,</HI> on this Coast, paying to the Negroes, for his Ransom, the Value of three Pound five Shillings in Goods, for which he had taken a Note, that he thought he had done a charitable Act in this, till meeting with one Captain <HI>Canning,</HI> he was ask'd, why he would re∣lease such a Rogue as <HI>Wilson</HI> was? For that he had been a Voluntier with the Pyrates, out of <HI>John Tarlton.</HI> And when the Deponent came to be a Pri∣soner himself, he found <HI>Thomas,</HI> the Brother of this <HI>John Tarlton,</HI> a Prisoner with the Pyrates also,
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
who was immediately on <HI>Wilson's</HI> Instigation, in a most sad manner misused and beat, and had been Shot, through the Fury and Rage of some of those Fellows, if the Town-side, <HI>(i. e. Liverpool)</HI> Men, had not hid him in a Stay-Sail, under the Bowsprit; for <HI>Moody</HI> and <HI>Harper,</HI> with their Pistols cock'd, searched every Corner of the Ship, to find him, and came to this Deponent's Hammock, whom they had like fatally to have mistaken for <HI>Tarlton,</HI> but on his calling out, they found their Error, and left him with this comfortable Anodyne, That he was the honest Fellow who brought the Doctor. At coming away, the Prisoner asked about his Note, whether the Pyrate had it or no? Who not being able readily to tell, he reply'd, it's no Matter, Mr. <HI>Sharp,</HI> I believe I shall hardly ever come to <HI>England</HI> to pay it.</P>
<P><HI>Adam Comry,</HI> Surgeon of this <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> says, that altho' the Prisoner had, on Account of his Indispo∣sition and Want, received many Civilities from him, before meeting with the Pyrates, he yet un∣derstood it was thro' his, and <HI>Scudamore's,</HI> Means, that he had been compelled among them: The Pri∣soner was very alert and chearful, he says, at meet∣ing with <HI>Roberts,</HI> hailed him, told him he was glad to see him, and would come on Board pre∣sently, borrowing of the Deponent a clean Shirt and Drawers, for his better Appearance and Re∣ception, he signed their Articles willingly, and used Arguments with him to do the same, saying, they should make their Voyage in eight Months, to <HI>Brasil,</HI> Share 6 or 700 l. a Man, and then break up. Again, when the Crew came to Election of a chief Surgeon, and this Deponent was set up with the others, <HI>Wilson</HI> told him, he hoped he would carry it from <HI>Scudamore,</HI> for that a quarter Share, (which they had more than others,) would be worth looking after; but the Deponent, missed
<PB N="245" REF="254"/>
the Preferment, by the good Will of the <HI>Ranger</HI>'s People, who in general voted for <HI>Scudamore,</HI> to get rid of him, (the chief Surgeon being always to remain with the Commadore.)</P>
<P>It appeared likewise by the Evidence of Captain <HI>Jo. Trahern, Tho. Cartel,</HI> and others, who had been taken by the Pyrates, and thence had Opportu∣nities of observing the Prisoner's Conduct, that he seem'd thoroughly satisfy'd with that Way of Life, and was particularly intimate with <HI>Roberts;</HI> they often scoffing at the Mention of a Man of War, and saying, if they should meet with any of the Turnip-Man's Ships they would blow up, and go to H—ll together. Yet setting aside these silly Freaks to recommend himself, his Laziness had got him many Enemies, even <HI>Roberts</HI> told him, (on the Complaint of a wounded Man, whom he had refused to Dress,) that he was a double Rogue, to be there a second Time, and threatned to cut his Ears off.</P>
<P>The Evidence further assured the Court, from Captain <HI>Thomas Tarlton,</HI> that the Prisoner was taken out of his Brother's Ship, some Months be∣fore, a first Time, and being forward to oblige his new Company, had presently ask'd for the Py∣rates Boat, to fetch the Medicine Chest away; when the Wind and Current proving too hard to contend with, they were drove on Shore at Cape <HI>Montzerado.</HI></P>
<P>The Prisoner called for <HI>William Darling,</HI> and <HI>Samu∣el Morwel,</HI> (acquitted,) and <HI>Nicholas Butler.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Darling</HI> deposed, the first Time the Pri∣soner fell into their Hands, <HI>Roberts</HI> mistook him for <HI>Jo. Tarlton</HI> the Master, and being informed it was the Surgeon who came to represent him, (then indis∣posed,) he presently swore he should be his Mess∣mate, to which <HI>Wilson</HI> reply'd, he hoped not, he had a Wife and Child, which the other laugh'd at;
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
and that he had been two Days on Board, before he went in that Boat, which was drove on Shore at Cape <HI>Montzerado.</HI> And at his second coming, in the <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> he heard <HI>Roberts</HI> order he should be brought on Board in the first Boat.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Morwel</HI> says, that he has heard him be∣wail his Condition, while on Board the Pyrate, and desired one <HI>Thomas,</HI> to use his Interest with <HI>Roberts,</HI> for a Discharge, saying, his Employ, and the little Fortune he had left at home, would, he hope'd, exempt him the further trouble of seeking his Bread at Sea.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Butler,</HI> who had remained with the Py∣rates about 48 Hours, when they took the <HI>French</HI> Ships at <HI>Whydah,</HI> deposes, that in this Space the Prisoner addressed him in the <HI>French</HI> Language, seve∣ral times, deploring the Wretchedness and ill For∣tune of being confined in such Company.</P>
<P>The Prisoner desiring Liberty of two or three Questions, ask'd, whether or no he had not expo∣stulated with <HI>Roberts,</HI> for a Reason of his obliging Surgeons to sign their Articles, when heretofore they did not? Whether he had not expressed him∣self glad of having formerly escaped from them? Whether he had not said, at taking the Ships in <HI>Whydah</HI> Road, that he could like the Sport were it lawful? And whether if he had not told him, should the Company discharge any Sur∣geon, that he would insist on it as his Turn? The Deponent answered, Yes, to every Question sepa∣rately; and farther, that he believes <HI>Scudamore</HI> had not seen <HI>Wilson</HI> when he first came and found him out of the <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>He added, in his own Defence, that being Surgeon with one <HI>John Tarlton,</HI> of <HI>Leverpool,</HI> he was met a first time on this Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> by <HI>Roberts</HI> the Pyrate; who, after a Day or two, told him, to his Sorrow, that he was to stay there, and ordered him to fetch
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
his Chest (not Medicines, as asserted,) which Op∣portunity he took to make his Escape; for the Boat's Crew happening to consist of five <HI>French</HI> and one <HI>English</HI> Man, all as willing as himself, they agreed to push the Boat on Shore, and trust them∣selves with the Negroes of Cape <HI>Montzerado:</HI> Hazar∣dous, not only in Respect of the dangerous Seas that run there, but the Inhumanity of the Natives, who sometimes take a liking to humane Carcasses. Here he remained five Months, till <HI>Thomas Tarlton,</HI> Brother to his Captain, chanc'd to put in the Road for Trade, to whom he represented his Hardships and starving Condition; but was, in an unchristian Manner, both refused a Release of this Captivity, or so much as a small Supply of Biscuit and salt Meat, because, as he said, he had been among the Pyrates. A little time after this, the Master of a <HI>French</HI> Ship paid a Ransom for him, and took him off; but, by Reason of a nasty leperous Indisposi∣tion he had contracted by hard and bad living, was, to his great Misfortune, set on Shore at <HI>Sestos</HI> again, when Captain <HI>Sharp</HI> met him, and generously procured his Release in the Manner himself has related, and for which he stands infinitely obli∣ged.—That ill Luck threw him a second time into the Pyrate's Hands, in this Ship <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> where he met <HI>Thomas Tarlton,</HI> and thoughtlesly used some Re∣proaches of him, for his severe Treatment at <HI>Mont∣zerado;</HI> but protests without Design his Words should have had so bad a Consequence; for <HI>Ro∣berts</HI> took upon him, as a Dispenser of Justice, the Correction of Mr. <HI>Tarlton,</HI> beating him unmercifully; and he hopes it will be believed, contrary to any Intention of his it should so happen, because as a Stranger he might be supposed to have no Influ∣ence, and believes there were some other Motives for it.—He cannot remember he expressed him∣self glad to see <HI>Roberts</HI> this second time, or that
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
he dropped those Expressions about <HI>Comry,</HI> as are sworn; but if Immaturity of Judgment had oc∣casioned him to slip rash and inadvertent Words, or that he had paid any undue Compliments to <HI>Roberts,</HI> it was to ingratiate himself, as every Pri∣soner did, for a more civil Treatment, and in par∣ticular to procure his Discharge, which he had been promised, and was afraid would have been revo∣ked, if such a Person as <HI>Comry</HI> did not remain there to supply his Room; and of this, he said, all the Gentlemen (meaning the Pyrates) could witness for him.</P>
<P>He urged also his Youth in Excuse for his Rash∣ness.—The first time he had been with them (on∣ly a Month in all) and that in no military Employ; but in particular, the Service he had done in disco∣vering the Design the Pyrates had to Rise in their Passage on board the <HI>Swallow. Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>But Execution respited till the King's Pleasure be known, because the Commander of the <HI>Swallow</HI> had declared, the first Notice he received of this Design of the Pyrates to Rise, was from him.</P>

<HEAD>Benjamin Jeffrys.</HEAD>
<P>BY the Depositions of <HI>Glasby</HI> and <HI>Lillburn</HI> (acquit∣ted) against this Prisoner, it appeared, that his Drunkenness was what at first detained him from going away in his proper Ship, the <HI>Norman</HI> Galley; and next Morning, for having been abusive in his Drink, saying to the Pyrates, there was not a Man amongst them, he received, for a Welcome, six Lashes from every Person in the Ship which dis∣order'd him for some Weeks, but on Recovery, was made Boatswain's Mate; the serving of which, or any Office on board a Pyrate, is at their own Option (tho' elected) because others are glad to ac∣cept what brings an additional Share in Prize.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="258"/>
The Deponents further say, that at <HI>Sierraleon</HI> eve∣ry Man had more especially the Means of escaping; and that this Prisoner, in particular, neglected it, and came off from that Place after their Ship was under Sail, and going out of the River.</P>
<P>The Prisoner, in his Defence, protests, he was at first forc'd; and that the Office of Boatswain's Mate was imposed on him, and what he would have been glad to have relinquish'd. That the barbarous whipping he had received from the Pyrates at first, was for telling them, that none who could get their Bread in an honest Way, would be on such an Account. And he had certainly taken the Oppor∣tunity which presented at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> of ridding him∣self from so distastful a Life, if there had not been three or four of the old Pyrates on Shore at the same Time, who, he imagined, must know of him, and would doubtless have served him the same, if not worse, than they since had done <HI>Wil∣liam Williams;</HI> who, for such a Design, being de∣livered up by the treacherous Natives, had re∣ceived two Lashes thro' the whole Ship's Company.</P>
<P>The Court observed, the Excuses of these Py∣rates, about want of Means to escape, was often∣times as poor and evasive as their Pleas of being forced at first; for here, at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> every Man had his Liberty on Shore, and it was evident, might have kept it, if he, or they, had so pleased. And such are further culpable, who having been introduced into the Society, by such uncivil Me∣thods, as whipping, or beating, neglect less likely Means of regaining Liberty; it shews strong In∣clinations to Dishonesty, and they stand inexcu∣sably, <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Jo. Mansfield.</HEAD>
<P>IT was proved against this Prisoner, by Captain <HI>Trahern</HI> and <HI>George Fenn,</HI> that he was one of those Voluntiers who was at the Attack and Rob∣bery
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
of the Company's Ship, called the <HI>King Solo∣mon:</HI> That he bully'd well among them who dar'd not make any Reply, but was very easy with his Friends, who knew him; for <HI>Moody,</HI> on this Occa∣sion, took a large Glass from him, and threatned to blow his Brains out, (a favourite Phrase with these Pyrates,) if he muttered at it.</P>
<P>From others acquitted, it likewise appeared, that he was at first a Voluntier among them, from an Island call'd <HI>Dominico,</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and had, to recommend himself, told them he was a De∣serter from the <HI>Rose</HI> Man of War, and before that, had been on the High-Way; he was always drunk they said, and so bad at the Time they met with the <HI>Swallow,</HI> that he knew nothing of the Action, but came up vaporing with his Cutlash, after the <HI>Fortune</HI> had struck her Colours, to know who would go on Board the Prize; and it was some Time before they could perswade him into the Truth of their Condition.</P>
<P>He could say little in Defence of himself, ac∣knowledg'd this latter Part, of Drunkenness; a Vice, he says, that had too great a Share in insnaring him into this course of Life, and had been a greater Motive, with him, than Gold. <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>William Davis.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WIlliam Allen</HI> deposed, he knew this Prisoner at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Ann</HI> Galley; that he had a Quarrel with, and beat, the Mate of that Ship, for which, (as he said) being afraid to return to his Duty, he consorted to the idle Cu∣stoms and Ways of living among the Negroes, from whom he received a Wife, and ungratefully sold her, one Evening, for some Punch, to quench his Thirst. After this, having put himself under the Protection of Mr. <HI>Plunket,</HI> Governor there for the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company: The Relations and
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
Friends of the Woman, apply'd to him for Re∣dress, who immediately surrendred the Prisoner, and told them, he did not care if they took his Head off; but the Negroes wisely judging it would not fetch so good a Price, they sold him in his Turn again, to <HI>Seignior Jossee,</HI> a Christian Black, and Native of that Place; who expected and agreed for two Years Service from him, on Consideration of what he had disbursed, for the Redemption of the Woman: But long before the Expiration of this Time, <HI>Roberts</HI> came into <HI>Sierraleon</HI> River, where the Prisoner, (as <HI>Seignior Jossee</HI> assured the Deponent,) entered a Voluntier with them.</P>
<P>The Deponent further coroborates this Part of the Evidence; in that he being obliged to call at Cape <HI>Mount,</HI> in his Passage down hither, met there with two Deserters from <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Ship, who assured him of the same; and that the Pyrates did design to turn <HI>Davis</HI> away the next Opportuni∣ty, as an idle good-for-nothing Fellow.</P>
<P>From <HI>Glasby</HI> and <HI>Lilburn,</HI> it was evident, that every Pyrate, while they stay'd at <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> went on Shore at Discretion. That <HI>Roberts</HI> had often assured Mr. <HI>Glyn</HI> and other Traders, at that Place, that he would force no Body; and in short, there was no Occasion for it; in particular, the Priso∣ner's Row-Mate went away, and thinks, he might have done the same, if he had been pleased.</P>
<P>The Prisoner alledged, his having been detained against his Will, and says, that returning with Elephants Teeth, for <HI>Sierraleon,</HI> the Pyrate's Boat pursued and brought him on Board, where he was kept on Account of his understanding the Pilotage and Navigation of that River.</P>
<P>It was obvious to the Court, not only how fri∣volous Excuses of Constraint and Force, were among these People, at their first commencing Py∣rates, but also, it was plain to them, from these

<P>I am not ignorant, how acceptable the Behaviour and dying Words of Malefactors are to the gene∣rallity of our Countrymen, and therefore shall deliver, what occur'd worthy of Notice, in the Behaviour of these Criminals.</P>
<P>The first six that were call'd to Execution, were <HI>Magnes, Moody, Simpson, Sutton, Ashplant,</HI> and <HI>Hardy;</HI> all of them old Standers and notorious Offenders: When they were brought out of the Hold, on the Parade, in order to break off their Fet∣ters, and fit the Halters; none of them, it was observed, appeared the least dejected, unless <HI>Sut∣ton,</HI> who spoke faint, but it was rather imputed to a Flux that had seiz'd him two or three Days be∣fore, than Fear. A Gentleman, who was Surgeon of the Ship, was so charitable at this Time, to offer himself in the room of an Ordinary, and repre∣sented to them as well as he was able, the Heinousness of their Sin, and Necessity which lay on them of Re∣pentance;
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
one particular Part of which ought to be, acknowledging the Justice they had met with. They seem'd heedless for the present, some calling for Water to drink, and others applying to the Soldiers for Caps; but when this Gentleman press'd them for an Answer, they all exclaim'd against the Severity of the Court, and were so harden'd, as to curse, and wish the same Justice might overtake all the Members of it, as had been dealt to them. <HI>They were poor Rogues,</HI> they said, <HI>and so hang'd, while others, no less Guilty in another Way, escaped.</HI></P>
<P>When he endeavoured to compose their Minds, exhorting them to dye in Charity with all the World, and would have diverted them from such vain Discourse, by asking them their Country, Age, and the like; some of them answered, <Q>“What was that to him, they suffered the Law, and should give no Account but to God;”</Q> walking to the Gal∣lows without a Tear, in token of Sorrow for their past Offences, or shewing as much Concern as a Man would express at travelling a bad Road; nay, <HI>Simpson,</HI> at seeing a Woman that he knew, said, <Q>“he had lain with that B—h three times, and now she was come to see him hanged.”</Q> And <HI>Hardy,</HI> when his Hands were ty'd behind him, (which happened from their not being acquainted with the Way of bringing Malefactors to Execution,) ob∣served <Q>“that he had seen many a Man hang'd, but this way of the Hands being ty'd behind them, he was a Stranger to, and never saw before in his Life.”</Q> I mention these two little Instances, to shew how stupid and thoughtless they were of their End, and that the same abandoned and re∣probate Temper, that had carried them thro' their Rogu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ries, abided with them to the last.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Fletcher,</HI> another of the Pyrates ordered for Execution, but reprieved, seem'd to have a
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
quicker Sense of his Condition; <Q>for when he saw those he was allotted with, gone to Execution, he sent a Message by the Provost Marshal to the Court, to be “in∣form'd of the Meaning of it, and humbly desired to know, whether they design'd him Mercy, or not? If they did, he stood infinitely oblig'd to them, and thought the whole Service of his Life, an incompe∣tent Return for so great a Favour; but that if he was to Suffer, the sooner the better, <HI>he said,</HI> that he might be out of his Pain.”</Q></P>
<P>There were others of these Pyrates the reverse of this, and tho' destitute of Ministers, or fit Per∣sons to represent their Sins, and assist them with Spiritual Advice, were yet always imploying their Time to good Purposes, and behav'd with a great deal of seeming Devotion and Penitence; among these may be reckoned <HI>Scudamore, Williams, Philips, Stephenson, Jefferys, Lesly, Harper, Armstrong, Bunce,</HI> and others.</P>
<P><HI>Scudamore</HI> too lately discern'd the Folly and Wickedness of the Enterprize, that had chiefly brought him under Sentence of Death, from which, seeing there was no Hopes of escaping, he petiti∣oned for two or three Days Reprieve, which was granted; and for that Time apply'd him self in∣cessantly to Prayer and reading the Scriptures, seem'd to have a deep Sense of his Sins, of this in particular, and desired, at the Gallows, they would have Patience with him, to sing the first Part of the thirty first Psalm; which he did by himself throughout.</P>
<P><HI>Armstrong,</HI> having been a Deserter from his Ma∣jesty's Service, was executed on Board the <HI>Wey∣mouth,</HI> (and the only one that was;) there was no Body to press him to an acknowledgement of the Crime he died for, nor of sorrowing in particular for it, which would have been exemplary, and made suitable Impressions on Seamen; so that his
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
last Hour was spent in lamenting and bewail∣ing his Sins in general, exhorting the Specta∣tors to an honest and good Life, in which alone they could find Satisfaction. In the End, he de∣sired they would join with him, in singing two or three latter Verses of the 140 Psalm, and that being concluded, he was, at firing of a Gun, triced up at the Fore-Yard-Arm.</P>
<P><HI>Bunce</HI> was a young Man, not above 26 Years old, but made the most pathetical Speech of any, at the Gallows. He first declaimed against the guilded Bates of Power, Liberty, and Wealth, that had ensnared him among the Pyrates, his unexperienced Years not being able to withstand the Temptation; but that the Briskness he had shewn, which so fatally had procured him Favour amongst them, was not so much a Fault in Principle, as the Liveliness and Vivacity of his Nature. He was now ex∣treamly afflicted for the Injuries he had done to all Men, and begg'd their's, and God's Forgiveness, very earnestly exhorting the Spectators to remem∣ber their Creator in their Youth, and guard be∣times, that their Minds took not a wrong Byass, concluding with this apt Similitude, <HI>That he stood there as a Beacon upon a Rock,</HI> (the Gallows standing on one) <HI>to warn erring Mariners of Danger.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. OF Captain <HI>WORLEY,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Reign was but short, but his Beginning somewhat particular, setting out in a small open Boat, with eight others, from <HI>New-York.</HI> This was as resolute a Crew as ever went upon the Account: They took with them a few Biscuits and a dry'd Tongue or two, a little Cag of Water, half a dozen old Muskets and Ammuni∣tion accordingly. Thus provided, they left <HI>New-York</HI> the latter End of <HI>September</HI> 1718, but it can∣not be supposed that such a Man of War as this, could undertake any considerable Voyage, or at∣tempt any extraordinary Enterprize; so they stood down the Coast, till they came to <HI>Delaware</HI> River, which is about 150 Miles distant, and not meeting with any Thing in their Way, they turn'd up the same River as high as <HI>Newcastle,</HI> near which Place, they fell upon a Shallop belonging to <HI>George Grant,</HI> who was bringing Household Goods, Plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Oppoquenimi</HI> to <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> they made Prize of the most valuable Part of them, and let the Shal∣lop go. This Fact could not come under the Ar∣ticle of Pyracy, it not being committed <HI>super altum Mare,</HI> upon the High-Sea, therefore was a simple
<PB N="262" REF="271"/>
Robbery only; but they did not stand for a Point of Law in the Case, but easing the Shallop Man of his Lading, the bold Adventurers went down the River again.</P>
<P>The Shallop came strait to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and brought the ill News thither, which so alarm'd the Government, as if War had been declared against them; Expresses were sent to <HI>New-York,</HI> and other Places, and several Vessels fitted out against this powerful Rover, but to no manner of Purpose; for after several Days Cruize, they all return'd, without so much as hearing what became of the Robbers.</P>
<P><HI>Worley</HI> and his Crew, in going down the River, met with a Sloop of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> belonging to a Mulatto, whom they call'd <HI>Black Robin;</HI> they quit∣ted their Boat for this Sloop, taking one of <HI>Black Robin</HI>'s Men along with them, as they had also done from <HI>George Grant,</HI> besides two Negroes, which encreased the Company one Third. A Day or two after, they took another Sloop belonging to <HI>Hull,</HI> homeward bound, which was somewhat fitter for their Purpose; they found aboard her, Provisions and Necessaries, which they stood in need of, and enabled them to prosecute their Design, in a manner more suitable to their Wishes.</P>
<P>Upon the Success of these Pyrates, the Gover∣nor issued out a Proclamation, for the apprehend∣ing and taking all Pyrates, who had refused or neg∣lected to surrender themselves, by the Time limi∣ted in his Majesty's Proclamation of Pardon; and thereupon, ordered his Majesty's Ship <HI>Phaenix,</HI> of 20 Guns, which lay at <HI>Sandy Hook,</HI> to Sea, to Cruize upon this Pyrate, and secure the Trade to that, and the adjoining Colonies.</P>
<P>In all probality, the taking this Sloop sav'd their Bacons, for this Time, tho' they fell into the Trap presently afterwards; for they finding themselves
<PB N="263" REF="272"/>
in tolerable good Condition, having a Vessel newly cleaned, with Provisions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they stood off to Sea, and so missed the <HI>Phaenix,</HI> who expected them to be still on the Coast.</P>
<P>About six Weeks afterwards they return'd, ha∣ving taking both a Sloop and a Brigantine, among the <HI>Buhama Islands;</HI> the former they sunk, and the other they let go: The Sloop belonged to <HI>New-York,</HI> and they thought the sinking of her good Poli∣cy, to prevent her returning to tell Tales at Home.</P>
<P><HI>Worley</HI> had by this Time, encreased his Company to about five and twenty Men, had six Guns mounted, and small Arms as many as was neces∣sary for them, and seem'd to be in a good thriving sort of a Way. He made a black Ensign, with a white Death's Head in the middle of it, and other Colours suitable to it. They all sign'd Articles, and bound themselves under a solemn Oath, to take no Quarters, but to stand by one another to the last Man, which was rashly fulfill'd a little afterwards.</P>
<P>For going into an Inlet in <HI>North Carolina,</HI> to clean, the Governor receiv'd Information of it, and fitted out two Sloops, one with eight Guns, and the other with six, and about seventy Men between them. <HI>Worley</HI> had clean'd his Sloop, and sail'd be∣fore the <HI>Carolina</HI> Sloops reach'd the Place, and steer'd to the Northward; but the Sloops, just mention'd, pursuing the same Course, came in sight of <HI>Worley,</HI> as he was cruising off the Capes of <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> and being in the Offin, he stood in as soon as he saw the Sloops, intending thereby to have cut them off from <HI>James</HI> River; for he verily believed they had been bound thither, not imagining, in the least, they were in Pursuit of him.</P>
<P>The two Sloops standing towards the Capes at the same Time, and <HI>Worley</HI> hoisting of his black Flag, the Inhabitants of <HI>James</HI> Town, were in
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
the utmost Consternation, thinking that all three had been Pyrates, and that their Design had been upon them; so that all the Ships and Vessels, that were in the Road, or in the Rivers up the Bay, had Orders immediately to hale into the Shore, for their Security, or else to prepare for their De∣fence, if they thought themselves in a Condition to fight. Soon after, two Boats, who were sent out to get Intelligence, came crowding in, and brought an Account, that one of the Pyrates was in the Bay, being a small Sloop of six Guns. The Gover∣nor expecting the rest would have followed, and thought they would make some Attempt to land, for the sake of Plunder, beat to Arms, and collect∣ed all the Force that could be got together, to make an Opposition; he order'd all the Guns out of the Ships, to made a Platform, and, in short, put the whole Colony in a Warlike Posture; but was very much surpriz'd at last, to see all the suppo∣sed Pyrates, fighting with one another.</P>
<P>The Truth of the Matter is, <HI>Worley</HI> gain'd the Bay, and therefore made sure of his two Prizes, by keeping them from coming in; but by the hoist∣ing of the King's Colours, and firing a Gun, he quickly was sensible of his Mistake, and too soon perceiv'd that the Tables were turn'd upon him; that instead of keeping them out, he found himself, by a superiour Force, kept in. When the Pyrates saw how things went, they resolutely prepared themselves for a desperate Defence; and tho' three to one odds, <HI>Worley,</HI> and his small Crew, determined to fight to the last Gasp, and receive no Quarters, agreeably to what they had before sworn; so that they must either Dye, or Conquer, upon the Spot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carrlina</HI> Men, gave the Pyrate a Broadside, and then boarded him, one Sloop getting upon his Quarter, and the other on his Bow; <HI>Worley</HI> and the Crew, drew up, upon the Deck, and fought
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
very obstinately, Hand to Hand, so that in a few Minutes, abundance of Men lay weltring in their Gore; the Pyrates proved as good as their Words, not a Man of them cry'd out for Quarter, nor would they accept of such, when offer'd, but were all killed, except the Captain and another Man, and those very much wounded, whom they reserv'd for the Gallows. They were brought ashore in Irons, and the next Day, which was the 17th of <HI>February,</HI> 1718-9, they were both hang'd up, for fear they should dye, and evade the Punish∣ment, as was thought due to their Crimes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. OF Captain <HI>George Lowther,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GEorge Lowther</HI> sail'd out of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> in one of the Royal <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany's Ships, call'd the <HI>Gambia Castle,</HI> of 16 Guns and 30 Men, <HI>Charles Russel</HI> Commader; of which Ship, the said <HI>Lowther</HI> was second Mate. Aboard of the same Ship, was a certain Number of Soldiers, commanded by one <HI>John Massey,</HI> who were to be carried to one of the Company's Set∣tlements, on the River of <HI>Gambia,</HI> to Garrison a
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
Fort, which was sometime ago taken and destroy'd by Captain <HI>Davis</HI> the Pyrate.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> 1721, the <HI>Gambia Castle</HI> came safe to her Port, in <HI>Africa,</HI> and landed Captain <HI>Massey</HI> and his Men on <HI>James</HI>'s Island, where he was to Com∣mand under the Governor, Collonel <HI>Whitney,</HI> who arrived there but a little while before: And here, by a fatal Misunderstanding, between the military Folks and the trading People, the Fort, and Gar∣rison, not only came to be lost again to the Com∣pany, but a fine Galley well provided, and worth 10000 l. turn'd against her Masters.</P>
<P>The Names of Governor and Captain sounded great, but when the Gentlemen found that the Pow∣er that generally goes along with those Titles, was oversway'd and born down by the Merchants and Factors, (mechanick Fellows as they thought them) they grew very impatient and disatisfy'd, especially <HI>Massey,</HI> who was very loud in his Com∣plaints against them, particularly at the small Al∣lowance of Provisions to him and his Men; for the Garrison and Governor too, were victualled by the Merchants, which was no small Grievance and Mortification to them. And as the want of eating was the only Thing that made the great <HI>Sancho</HI> quit his Government, so did it here rend and tare their's to Pieces: For <HI>Massey</HI> told them, <HI>That he did not come there to be a Guiney Slave, and that he had promised his Men good Treatment, and Provisions fitting for Soldiers: That as he had the Care of so many of his Majesty's Sub∣jects, if they would not provide for them in a handsome Manner, he should take suitable Measures for the Preser∣vation of so many of his Countrymen and Companions.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor at this Time, was very ill of a Fever, and, for the better Accommodation in his Sickness, was carried aboard the Ship <HI>Gambia Castle,</HI> where he continued for above three Weeks,
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
and therefore could have little to say in this Dis∣pute, tho' he resolved not to stay in a Place, where there was so little Occasion for him, and where his Power was so confin'd. The Merchants had cer∣tainly Orders from the Company, to issue the Pro∣visions out to the Garrison, and the same is done along the whole Coast; but whether they had cut them short of the Allowance that was made for them, I can't say, but if they did, then is the Loss of the Ship and Garrison owing principally to their ill Conduct.</P>
<P>However, an Accident that happened on Board the Ship, did not a little contribute to this Mis∣fortune, which was a Pique that the Captain of her took against his second Mate, <HI>George Lowther,</HI> the Man who is the Subject of this short History; and who losing his Favour, found Means to ingra∣tiate himself into the good liking of the common Sailors, insomuch that when Captain <HI>Russel</HI> order's him to be punish'd, the Men took up Handspikes, and threatned to knock that Man down, that offer∣ed to lay hold of the Mate. This serv'd but to widen the Difference between him and the Cap∣tain, and more firmly attach'd <HI>Lowther</HI> to the Ship's Company, the greatest Part of which, he found ripe for any Mischief in the World.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Massey</HI> was no wit the better reconciled, to the Place, by a longer Continuance, nor to the Usage he met with there, and having often Oppor∣tunities of conversing with <HI>Lowther,</HI> with whom he had contracted an Intimacy in the Voyage; they aggravated one another's Grievances to such a height, that they resolved upon Measures to curb the Power that controul'd them, and provide for themselves after another Manner.</P>
<P>When the Governor recover'd of his Fever, he went ashore to the Island, but took no Notice of <HI>Massey</HI>'s Behaviour, tho' it was such as might give
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
Suspicion of what he designed; and <HI>Lowther,</HI> and the common Sailors, who were in the Secret of Affairs, grew insolent and bold, even refusing to obey when commanded to their Duty by Captain <HI>Russel</HI> and the chief Mate. The Captain seeing how Things were carried, goes ashore early one Morning, to the Gover∣nor and Factory, in order to hold a Council, which, <HI>Lowther</HI> apprehending, was in order to prevent his Design, sent a Letter in the same Boat to <HI>Massey,</HI> intimating it to him, and <HI>that he should repair on Board, for it was high Time to put their Project in Exe∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as <HI>Massey</HI> received this Letter he went to the Soldiers at the <HI>Barracks,</HI> and said to them, and others, <HI>You that have a Mind to go to England, now is your Time;</HI> and they generally consenting, <HI>Massey</HI> went to the Store-Room, burst open the Door, set two Centinels upon it, and ordered that no Body should come near it; then he went to the Governor's Apartment, and took his Bed, Bag∣gage, Plate, and Furniture, (in Expectation that the Governor himself, as he had promised <HI>Massey,</HI> would have gone on Board, which he afterwards refus'd, by Reason, as he said, he believed they were going a-pyrating; which at first, whatever <HI>Lowther</HI> designed, <HI>Massey</HI> certainly proposed only the going to <HI>England;)</HI> when this was done, he sent the Boat off to the chief Mate, with this Mes∣sage, <HI>That he should get the Guns ready, for that the King of</HI> Barro [a Negro Kingdom near the Royal <HI>African</HI> Settlement] <HI>would come aboard to Dinner.</HI> But <HI>Lowther</HI> understanding best, the meaning of those Orders, he confined the chief Mate, shotted the Guns, and put the Ship in a Condition for sailing. In the Afternoon <HI>Massey</HI> came on Board with the Governor's Son, having sent off all the Provisions of the Island, and eleven Pipes of Wine, leaving
<PB N="269" REF="278"/>
only two half Pipes behind in the Store-House, and dismounted all the Guns of the Fort.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they weigh'd one Anchor, but fearing to be too late to get out of the River, they slipp'd the other, and so fell down; in doing of which, they run the Ship a-ground. <HI>Massey</HI> shew'd himself a Soldier upon this Accident, for as soon as the Misfortune happen'd, he left the Ship with about sixteen Hands, and rows directly to the Fort, remounts the Guns, and keeps Garrison there all the Night, while the Ship was ashore; and obliged some of the Factory to assist in get∣ting her clear. In the mean while, <HI>Russel</HI> came off, but not being suffered to come on Board, he call'd to <HI>Lowther,</HI> and offer'd him and the Company, what-ever Terms they would be pleased to accept of, upon Condition of surrendering up the Ship, which had no Effect upon any of them. In the Morning they got her afloat, and <HI>Massey</HI> and his Men came aboard, after having nail'd up and dis∣mounted all the Cannon of the Fort. They put the Governor's Son, and two or three others, ashore, who were not willing to go without the Governor, and sail'd out of the River, having exchang'd se∣veral Shot with the <HI>Martha, Otter, &amp;c.</HI> that lay there, without doing Execution on either Side.</P>
<P>When the Ship came out to Sea, <HI>Lowther</HI> called up all the Company, and told them, <HI>it was the greatest Folly imaginable, to think of returning to</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>for what they had already done, could not be justify∣ed upon any Pretence whatsoever, but would be look'd up∣on, in the Eye of the Law, a capital Offence, and that none of them were in a Condition to withstand the Attacks of such powerful Adversaries, as they would meet with at Home; for his Part he was determined not to run such a Hazard, and therefore if his Proposal was not agreed to, he desired to be set a Shore in some Place of Safety: That they had a</HI>
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
<HI>good Ship under them, a parcel of brave Fellows in her, that it was not their Business to starve, or be made Slaves; and therefore, if they were all of his Mind, they should seek their Fortunes upon the Seas, as other Adventurers had done before them.</HI> They one and all came into the Measures, and the following short Articles were drawn up, signed, and sworn to upon the Bible; they knocked down the Cabins, made the Ship flush fore and aft, made black Colours, and put the Ship into a Condition for pyrating: They new nam'd her, <HI>the Delivery,</HI> had about 50 Hands and 16 Guns aboard, and voted for the <HI>West-Indies</HI> directly.</P>

<P>It was the 13th of <HI>June,</HI> that <HI>Lowther</HI> left the Settlement, and on the 20th, being then within twenty Leagues of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> he came up with a Brigantine, belonging to <HI>Boston,</HI> called the <HI>Charles, James Douglass</HI> Master, which they plundered in a pyratical Manner, and let the Vessel go; but least she should meet with any of the Station Ships, and so give Information of the Robbery, <HI>in Terrorem,</HI> to pre∣vent a Pursuit, <HI>Lowther</HI> contrived a sort of a Certifi∣cate, which he directed the Master to shew to their Consort, if they should meet with her; and upon Sight of it, the Brigantine would pass unmolested: This Consort he pretended was a 40 Gun Ship, and cruising thereabouts.</P>
<P>After this, the <HI>Delivery</HI> proceeded to <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> near the West End of the Island, she met with a <HI>French</HI> Sloop loaden with Wine and Brandy; aboard of this Vessel went Captain <HI>Massey,</HI> as a Merchant, and ask'd the Price of one Thing, and then ano∣ther, bidding Money for the most Part of the Cargo; but after he had trifled a while, he whispered a Secret in the <HI>French</HI> Man's Ear, <HI>viz. That they must have it all without Money. Monsieur</HI> presently under∣stood his meaning, and unwillingly agreed to the Bargain. They took out of her thirty Casks of Brandy, five Hogsheads of Wine, several Pieces of Chintzes, and other valuable Goods, and about seventy Pounds <HI>English,</HI> in Money; of which <HI>Lowther</HI> generously return'd five Pound back to the <HI>French</HI> Master, for his Civilities.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="281"/>
But as all Constitutions grow old, and thereby shake and totter, so did our Commonwealth in about a Month of it's Age, feel Commotions and intestine Disturbances by the Divisions of its Mem∣bers, which had near hand terminated in it's De∣struction; these civil Discords were owing to the following Occasion. Captain <HI>Massey</HI> had been a Soldier almost from his Infancy, but was but very indifferently acquainted with Maritime Affairs, and having an enterprizing Soul, nothing would satisfy him, but he must be doing Business in his own Way, therefore he required <HI>Lowther</HI> to let him have thirty Hands to land with, and he would At∣tack the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, and bring aboard the Devil and all of Plunder.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> did all that he could do, and said all that he could say, to disswade <HI>Massey</HI> from so rash and dangerous an Attempt; pointing out to him the Hazard the Company would run, and the Con∣sequences to them all, if he should not succeed, and the little likelyhood there was to expect Success from the Undertaking: But 'twas all one for that, <HI>Massey</HI> would go and attack the <HI>French</HI> Settlements, for any thing <HI>Lowther</HI> could say against it; so that he was obliged to propose the Matter to the Com∣pany, among whom <HI>Massey</HI> found a few Fellows, as resolute as himself; however a great Majority being against it, the Affair was over-ruled in Opposition to Captain <HI>Massey,</HI> notwithstanding which, <HI>Massey</HI> grew fractious, quarrel'd with <HI>Lowther,</HI> and the Men divided into Parties, some siding with the Land Pyrate, and some with the Sea Rover, and were all ready to fall together by the Ears, when the Man at the Mast-Head, cry'd out, a Sail! a Sail! Then they gave over the Dis∣pute, set all their Sails, and steered after the Chace. In a few Hours they came up with her, she being a small Ship from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bound to <HI>England;</HI> they
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
took what they thought fit out of her, and a Hand or two, and then <HI>Lowther</HI> was for sinking the Ship, with several Passengers that were in her, for what Reason I know not, but <HI>Massey</HI> interpo∣sed and prevented their cruel Fate, and the Ship safely arrived afterwards in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Day they took a small Sloop, an interloping Trader, which they detain'd with her Cargo. All this while <HI>Massey</HI> was uneasy, and de∣clared his Resolution to leave them, and <HI>Lowther</HI> finding him a very troublesome Man to deal with, consented that he should take the Sloop, last made Prize of, with what Hands had a Mind to go with him, and Shift for himself. Whereupon <HI>Massey,</HI> and about ten more Malecontents, goes aboard the Sloop, and comes away in her directly for <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding what had passed, Captain <HI>Massey</HI> puts a bold Face upon the Matter, and goes to Sir <HI>Nicholas Laws</HI> the Governor, informs him of his leaving <HI>Lowther</HI> the Pyrate, owns <HI>that he assisted in going off with the Ship, at the River</HI> Gambia, but said, <HI>'twas to save so many of his Majesty's Subjects from perish∣ing, and that his Design was to return to</HI> England; <HI>but</HI> Lowther <HI>conspiring with the greater Part of the Company, went a pyrating with the Ship, and that he had taken this Opportunity to leave him, and Surrender himself and Ves∣sel with the Cargo, and every Thing else, to his Excellency.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Massey</HI> was very well received by the Governor, and had his Liberty given him, with Promise of Service, and so forth; and at his own Request, he went on Board the <HI>Happy</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Laws,</HI> which was immediately ordered out to cruise off <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> for <HI>Lowther;</HI> but not being so fortunate as to meet with him, Captain <HI>Massey</HI> returned back to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> in the Sloop, and getting a Cir∣tificate, and a Supply of Money from the Gover∣nor, he came home Passenger to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="283"/>
When <HI>Massey</HI> came to Town, he writes a long Letter to the Deputy Governor and Directors of the <HI>African</HI> Company, wherein he imprudently re∣lates the whole Transactions of his Voyage, the going off with the Ship, and the Acts of Pyracy he had committed with <HI>Lowther,</HI> but excuses it as Rashness and Inadvertency in himself, occasioned by his be∣ing ill used, contrary to the Promises he had recei∣ved, and the Expectations he had entertained; but own'd, that he deserved to dye for what he had done; yet, if they had Generosity enough to for∣give him, as he is still capable to do them Service, as a Soldier, so he should be very ready to do it; but if they resolved to prosecute him, he begg'd only this Favour, that he might not be hanged like a Dog, but dye like a Soldier, as he had been bred from his Childhood, that is, by being Shot.</P>
<P>This was the Substance of the Letter, which, however, did not produce so favourable an Answer as he hoped for, Word being brought back to him, <HI>that he should be fairly hang'd.</HI> Whereupon, <HI>Massey</HI> resolved not to be out of the Way, when he found what important Occasion there was likely to be for him, so takes a Lodging in <HI>Aldersgate-Street,</HI> and the next Day went to the Lord Chief Justice's Chambers, and enquired if my Lord had granted a Warrant against Captain <HI>John Massey,</HI> for Pyracy; but being told by the Clerks, that they knew of no such Thing; he informed them he was the Man, that my Lord would soon be apply'd to for that Purpose, and, the Officer might come to him at such a Place, where he lodged: They took the Directions in Writing, and in a few Days, a War∣rant being issued, the Tipstaff went directly by his own Information, and apprehended him, with∣out any other trouble, than walking to his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odging.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284"/>
There was then no Person in Town, to charge him with any Fact, whereby he could be com∣mitted; nor could the Letter be proved to be of his Hand-Writting, so that they had been obliged to let him go again, if he had not helped his Ac∣cusers out at a Pinch: The Magistrate was reduced to the putting of this Question to him, <HI>did you write this Letter?</HI> He answered, <HI>He did:</HI> And not only that, but owned all the Contents of it, to be true; upon which, he was committed to <HI>Newgate,</HI> but was afterwards admitted to a hundred Pound Bail, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>On the 5th of <HI>July</HI> 1723, he was brought to his Tryal, at a Court of Admiralty held at the <HI>Old-Baily,</HI> when Captain <HI>Russel,</HI> Governor <HI>Whitney</HI>'s Son and others, appear'd as Evidences, by whom the Indictment was plainly proved against him; which, if it had not been done, the Captain was of such an heroick Spirit, that he would have deny'd nothing; for instead of making a Defence, he on∣ly entertained the Court with a long Narrative of his Expedition, from the first setting out, to his re∣turn to <HI>England,</HI> mentioning two Acts of Pyracy committed by him, which he was not charged with, often challenging the Evidences against him, if in any Thing he related the least Syllable of an Un∣truth, that they would contradict him; and in∣stead of denying any of them, set forth in the Indictments, he charged himself with, various Cir∣cumstances, which fixed the Facts more home upon him; upon the whole, the Captain was found Guilty, received Sentence of Death, and was exe∣cuted three Weeks after, at <HI>Execution-Dock.</HI></P>
<P>We return now to <HI>Lowther,</HI> whom we left cru∣sing off <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> from whence he ply'd to Wind∣ward, and near <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> chased two Sail and spoke with them; they proving to be a small <HI>Bristol</HI> Ship,
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
commanded by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> and a <HI>Spanish</HI> Pyrate, who had made Prize of her. <HI>Lowther</HI> examined into the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Authority for taking an <HI>English</HI> Ship, and threat'ned to put every Man of them to death for so doing; so that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fancied themselves to be in a very pityful Condition, till Matters cleared up, and they found their Masters as great Rogues as themselves, from whom some Mercy might be expected, in regard to the near Relation they stood with them, as to their Profes∣sion; in short, <HI>Lowther</HI> first rifled, and then burnt both the Ships, sending the <HI>Spaniards</HI> away in their Launch, and turning all the <HI>English</HI> Sailors into Pyrates.</P>
<P>After a few Days Cruize, <HI>Lowther</HI> took a small Sloop belonging to St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> which they mann'd and carried along with them to a small Island, where they cleaned, and stay'd some Time to take their Diversions, which consisted in un∣heard of Debaucheries, with drinking, swearing and rioting, in which there seemed to be a kind of Emulation among them, resembling rather Devils than Men, striving who should out doe one another in new invented Oaths and Execrations.</P>
<P>They all got aboard about <HI>Christmas,</HI> observing neither Times nor Seasons, for perpetrating their villainous Actions, and sail'd towards the Bay of <HI>Henduras.</HI> In their Way thither they met with a small Vessel with 13 Hands, in the same honourable Employment with themselves; the Captain of this Gang was one <HI>Edward Low,</HI> whom we shall particularly discourse of in a Chapter by it self: <HI>Lowther</HI> received them as Friends, and treated them with all imaginable Respect, inviting them as they were few in Number, and in no extraor∣dinary Condition to pursue the Account, (as they called it) to join their Strength together, which on the Consideration aforesaid, was accepted of, <HI>Low∣ther</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="286"/>
still continuing Commander, and <HI>Low</HI> was made Lieutenant; the Vessel the new Pyrates came out of, they sunk, and the Confederates proceed the Voyage as <HI>Lowther</HI> before intended.</P>
<P>The 10th of <HI>January,</HI> the Pyrates came into the Bay, and fell upon a Ship of 200 Tun, called the <HI>Greyhound, Benjamin Edwards</HI> Commander, belong∣ing to <HI>Boston. Lowther</HI> hoisted his pyratical Co∣lours, and fir'd a Gun for the <HI>Greyhound</HI> to bring to, which she refusing, the <HI>Happy Delivery</HI> (the Name of the Pyrate) edg'd down, and gave her a Broad∣side, which was returned by Captain <HI>Edwards</HI> very bravely, and the Engagement held for an Hour; but Captain <HI>Edwards</HI> finding the Pyrate too Strong for him, and fearing the Consequence of too ob∣stinate a Resistance against those Lawless Fellows, he ordered his Ensign to be Struck. The Pyrates Boat came aboard, and not only rifled the Ship, but whipp'd, beat and cut the Men in a cruel Manner, turned them aboard their own Ship, and then set Fire to their's.</P>
<P>In cruising about the Bay, they met and took se∣veral other Vessels without any Resistance, <HI>viz.</HI> two Brigantines of <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> one of which they burnt, and sunk the other; a Sloop belonging to <HI>Connecticut,</HI> Captain <HI>Airs,</HI> which they also burnt; a Sloop of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> Captain <HI>Hamilton,</HI> they took for their own Use; a Sloop of <HI>Virginia</HI> they unladed, and was so generous as to give her back to the Master that own'd her. They took a a Sloop of 100 Tun, belonging to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> which they were pleased to keep, and mounted her with eight Carriage, and ten Swivel Guns.</P>
<P>With this little Fleet, <HI>viz.</HI> Admiral <HI>Lowther,</HI> in the <HI>Happy Delivery,</HI> Captain <HI>Low,</HI> in the <HI>Rhode Island</HI> Sloop, Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> (who was second Mate in the <HI>Greyhound</HI> when taken,) in <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Sloop, and the little Sloop formerly mentioned, serving as a
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
Tender; I say, with this Fleet the Pyrates left the Bay, and came to <HI>Port Mayo,</HI> in the Gulph of <HI>Montick,</HI> and there made Preparations to carreen; they carried ashore their Sails, and made Tents by the Water-Side, wherein they laid their Plunder, Stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and fell to Work; and at the Time that the Ship was upon the Heel, and the good Folks employ'd in heaving down, scrubing, tallow∣ing and so forth; of a sudden came down a consi∣derable Body of the Natives, a 1000 or more, and Attacks the Pyrates unprepared. As they were in no Condition to defend themselves, or repulse their Enemies, they fled to their Sloops, leaving them Masters of the Field and the Spoil thereof, which was of great Value. They set Fire to the <HI>Happy Delivery,</HI> their capital Ship, and made off directly in two of the Sloops.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> made the best Provision he could in the largest Sloop, which he called the <HI>Ranger,</HI> having ten Guns, and eight Swivels, and she sailing best, the Company went all aboard of her, and left the other at Sea. Provisions was now very short, which, with the late Loss, put them in a confounded ill Humour, insomuch that they were every now and then going together by the Ears, laying the blame of their ill Conduct sometimes upon one, then up∣on another.</P>
<P>The Beginning of <HI>May</HI> 1722, they got to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and near the Island of <HI>Diseada,</HI> took a Brigantine, one <HI>Payne</HI> Master, that afforded them what they stood in need of, which put them in better Temper, and Business seem'd to go on well again; after they had pretty well plun∣dered the Brigantine, they sent her to the Bottom. They went into the Island and watered, and then stood to the Northward, intending to visit the Main-Coast of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="288"/>
In the Latitude of 38, <HI>May</HI> the 28th, they fell in with a Brigantine, called the <HI>Rebecca,</HI> of <HI>Charles-Town</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> bound to <HI>Boston</HI> from St. <HI>Christophers, James Flecker</HI> Master; they made Prize of her, at which time old Differences reviv'd, and were much inflam'd by a bold hardy Fellow, <HI>viz. Low,</HI> who had the Ambition to be a Captain too; in short the Company was equally divided, 45 Hands went into the Brigantine last taken, where <HI>Low</HI> was made Commander, and <HI>Lowther</HI> pursued the Game, with the like Number of Hands in the Sloop. <HI>Lowther</HI> proceeding on his Way to the Main-Coast, took three or four fishing Vessels off <HI>New-York,</HI> which was no great Booty to the Captors. The 3d of <HI>June,</HI> they met with a small <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> Ship, bound home from <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> which stood an Attack for a small Time, but finding it to no Purpose, yielded a Prey to the Booters: The Py∣rates took out of her fourteen Hogsheads of Rum, six Barrels of Sugar, a large Box of <HI>English</HI> Goods, several Casks of Loaf Sugar, a considerable Quan∣tity of Pepper, six Negroes, besides a Sum of Money, and Plate, and then let her go on her Voyage.</P>
<P>The next Adventure was not so Fortunate for them, for coming pretty near the Coast of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> they met with a Ship just come out, on her Voyage to <HI>England; Lowther</HI> gave her a Gun, and hoisted his pyratical Colours; but this Ship, which was called the <HI>Amy,</HI> happening to have a brave gallant Man to command her, who was not any ways daunted with that terrible Ensign, the black Flag; instead of striking immediately, as 'twas expected, let fly a Broadside at the Pyrate. <HI>Low∣ther</HI> (not at all pleased with the Compliment, tho' he put up with it for the present,) was for taking Leave; but the <HI>Amy</HI> getting the Pyrate between her and the Shore, stood after him to clap him aboard; to prevent which, <HI>Lowther</HI> run the Sloop a
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
ground, and landed all the Men with their Arms. Captain <HI>Gwatkins,</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Amy,</HI> was obliged to stand off, for fear of running his own Ship ashore; but at the same Time, thought fit for the publick Good, to destroy the Enemy; and thereupon went into the Boat, and rowed towards the Sloop, in order to set her on Fire; but before he reached the Vessel, a fatal Shot from <HI>Lowther</HI>'s Company ashore, put an End to their Design and Captain <HI>Gwatkin</HI>'s Life. After this unfortunate Blow, the Mate returned aboard with the Boat, and not being inclined to pursue them any farther, took Charge of the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> got off the Sloop after the Departure of the <HI>Amy,</HI> and brought all his Men aboard again, but was in a poor shattered Condition, having suffered much in the Engagement, and had a great many Men kill'd and wounded: He made Shift to get into an Inlet somewhere in <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> where he staid a long while before he was able to put to Sea again.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> and his Crew laid up all the Winter, and shifted as well as they could among the Woods, divided themselves into small Parties, and hunted generally in the Day-Times, killing of black Cat∣tle, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their Subsistance, and in the Night retired to their Tents and Huts which they made for Lodging; and sometimes when the Wea∣ther grew very cold, they would stay aboard of their Sloop.</P>
<P>In the Spring of the Year 1723, they made Shift to get to Sea, and steer'd their Course for <HI>Newsound∣land,</HI> and upon the Banks took a Scooner, called the <HI>Swist, John Hood</HI> Master; they found a good Quantity of Provisions aboard her, which they very much wanted at that Time, and, after taking three of their Hands, and plundering her of what they thought fit, they let her depart. They took se∣veral
<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
other Vessels upon the Banks, and then went off to the <HI>Azores</HI> Islands. In their Passage thither, about 100 Leagues Eastward of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> they met with a Brigantine called the <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth, Richard Stanny</HI> Master, bound to <HI>Boston:</HI> The Pyrates plundered her of several sorts of Goods and Mer∣chandizes, and took away two of her Men, and then discharged her.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Azores, Lowther</HI> and his old Companion <HI>Low</HI> met together, who saluted one another with great Shot, fired high in the Air; they visited the Islands together, particularly <HI>Fyal</HI> and St. <HI>Michael,</HI> and took several Ships and Vessels belonging to the <HI>Portuguese, French</HI> and <HI>English;</HI> they barbarously used several of the Masters, cutting off their Ears and Noses, whipping and cutting them <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From the <HI>Azores Lowther</HI> sail'd towards the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, but missing of them, and not being able to fetch any Windward Part of <HI>Africa,</HI> he was obliged to put away to the <HI>West-Indies;</HI> In which Voyage Provisions grew short, and the Company was forced to a very small Allowance. In <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> the Pyrate came near <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and took a Ship called the <HI>Princess,</HI> Captain <HI>Wicksted,</HI> from <HI>Gui∣ney,</HI> which, after they had plunder'd her, they let go; but sometime after that, in his Progress among the Leeward Islands, he happened to chase a Sloop pretty near into St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> and being foul could not come up with her. The Pyrates thought it now high Time to go in and clean; and accor∣dingly the small Island of <HI>Blanco</HI> was pitched upon, and there they arrived in the Beginning of <HI>Novem∣ber</HI> last.</P>
<P>The Governor of St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> who was always a vigilent Man, receiving Information of the Py∣rate, by the Sloop that was chased into the Har∣bour of that Island, straitway fitted out a large Sloop, well mann'd and arm'd, called the <HI>Eagle,</HI> and
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
gave a Commission to one Colonel <HI>Otley,</HI> of the said Island, to go in quest of her; and after a Cruise of ten or twelve Days, came to the Island where <HI>Lowther</HI> was carreening: The Pyrates were in no Condition to make any Resistance, and so upon Sight of the Colonel's Sloop, every Man shifted for himself, and for the most Part fled up into the Woods, so that few of them were taken. The Colonel brought the Sloop away, and left <HI>Lowther</HI> and the Crew, behind upon the Island, where we also for the present must leave them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. OF Captain <HI>Edward Low,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>EDward Low</HI> was born in <HI>Westminster,</HI> and had his Education there, such as it was, for he could neither write or read. Nature seem'd to have designed him for a Pyrate from his Child∣hood, for very early he began the Trade of plun∣dering, and was wont to raise Contributions among all the Boys of <HI>Westminster;</HI> and if any were bold enough to refuse it, a Battle was the Consequence; but <HI>Low</HI> was so hardy, as well as bold, there was no getting the better of him, so that he robbed the Youths of their Farthings with Impunity;
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
when he grew bigger he took to Gaming in a low Way, for it was commonly among the Footmen in the <HI>Lobby</HI> of the House of Commons, where he used to play the whole Game, (as they term it,) that is, cheat all he could, and those who pretend∣ed to dispute it with him, must fight him.</P>
<P>The Virtues of some of his Family were equal to his; one of his Brothers was a Youth of Genius, when he was but seven Years old, he used to be carried in a Basket, upon a Porter's Back, into a Crowd, and snatch Hats and Wigs; according to the exact Chronology of <HI>Newgate,</HI> he was the first who practiced this ingenious Trick. After this, he applied himself to picking of Pockets; when he increased in Strength, he attempted greater Things, such as House-breaking, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But after he had run a short Race, he had the Misfortune of ending his Days at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> in Company with <HI>Stephen Bunce,</HI> and the celebrated <HI>Jack Hall</HI> the Chimney-Sweeper.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Ned,</HI> when he came to Man's Estate, at his eldest Brother's Desire, he went to Sea with him, and so continued for three or four Years, and then parted; and <HI>Ned</HI> work'd in a Rig∣ging-House in <HI>Boston,</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> for a while. About six Years ago, he took a Trip home to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> to see his Mother, who is yet Living. His stay was not long here, but taking Leave of his Friends and Acquaintance, for the last Time he should see them, for so he was pleased to say, he returned to <HI>Boston,</HI> and worked a Year or two lon∣ger at the Rigging Business, but being too apt to disagree with his Masters, he left them, and shipp'd himself in a Sloop that was bound to the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P>When the Sloop arrived in the Bay, <HI>Ned Low</HI> was appointed Patron of the Boat, which was em∣ploy'd in the cutting of Logwood, and bringing
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
it aboard to lade the Ship, for that is the Commo∣dity they make the Voyage for: In the Boat were twelve Men besides <HI>Low,</HI> who all go arm'd, be∣cause of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> from whom this Logwood is but little better than stole. It happened that the Boat one Day came aboard just before Dinner was ready, and <HI>Low</HI> desired that they might stay and Dine; but the Captain being in a hurry for his Lading, ordered them a Bottle of Rum, and to take 'tother Trip, because no Time should be lost: This provoked the Boat's Crew, but particularly <HI>Low,</HI> who takes up a loaded Musquet and fires at the Captain, but missed him, and shot another poor Fellow thro' the Head, then put of the Boat, and with his twelve Companions goes to Sea: The next Day they took a small Vessel, and go in her, make a black Flag, and declared War against all the World.</P>
<P>In a few Days, <HI>Lowther</HI> the Pyrate standing in towards the Bay of <HI>Honduras, Low</HI> falls in Company with him, and after a Compliment, they join to∣gether, and go all aboard the same Vessel, which is already taken Notice of in the History of <HI>George Lowther,</HI> also what happen'd under <HI>Lowther</HI>'s Com∣mand, to the Time of their Separation, to which we refer the Reader.</P>
<P>The latter End of <HI>May</HI> 1722, the Crew under the said <HI>Lowther</HI> took a Brigantine of <HI>Boston,</HI> bound thither from St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> at which Time they parted, and <HI>Edward Low</HI> was one that went into the Brigantine, with 44 others, and chose their Captain: They took with them two Guns, four Swivels, six Quarter-Casks of Powder, Provisions and some Stores, and so left <HI>Lowther</HI> to prosecute his Adventures, with the Men he had left.</P>
<P>The first Adventure that happened to our new Captain in the Brigantine, was on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 3d Day of <HI>June,</HI> when they took a Vessel belonging
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
to <HI>Amboy, John Hance</HI> Master, whom he rifled of his Provisions and let go; the same Day he met with a Sloop, <HI>James Calquhoon</HI> Master, off of <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> bound into that Port, whom he first plun∣dred, and then cut away his Boltsprit, and all his Rigging, also his Sails from the Yards, and wound∣ed the Master, to prevent his getting in to give In∣telligence, and then stood away to the South-East∣ward, with all the Sail he could make, there being then but little Wind.</P>
<P><HI>Low</HI> judged right in making sail from the Coast, for a longer stay had proved fatal to him, for notwithstanding the disabled Condition he had rendered the Sloop in, she made shift to get into <HI>Block Island,</HI> at 12 o'Clock that Night, and imme∣diately dispatch'd a Whale-Boat to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> which got thither by seven the next Morning, with an Account of the Pyrate, his Force, and what had happened to him: As soon as the Governor had received this Information, he ordered a Drum to beat up for Volunteers, and two of the best Sloops then in the Harbour, to be fitted out, and gave Commissions to one Captain <HI>John Headland,</HI> and Captain <HI>John Brown</HI> jun. for ten Days; the former had eight Guns and two Swivels, and the latter six Guns, well fitted with small Arms, and in both Sloops 140 stout Fellows; all this was performed with so much Expedition, that before Sun-set, they were under Sail turning out of the Harbour, at the same Time the Pyrate was seen from <HI>Block Island,</HI> which gave great Hopes that the Sloops would be Masters of her the next Day, which however did not happen, for the Sloops re∣turned into Harbour some Days afterwards with∣out so much as seeing their Enemy.</P>
<P>After this Escape, Captain <HI>Low,</HI> went into Port, upon the Coast, for he had not fresh Water enough to run to the Islands, where he staid some Time,
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
getting Provisions and what Necessaries the Crew wanted, and then sail'd for Purchase, (as they call it,) steering their Course towards <HI>Marble-head.</HI></P>
<P>About the 12th of <HI>July,</HI> the Brigantine sail'd into the Harbour of Port <HI>Rosemary,</HI> and found thir∣teen Ships and Vessels, but none of Force, at Anchor, so they immediately spread their black Flag, and ran in among them; <HI>Low</HI> called to them from the Brigantine, and told them, they should have no Quarters if they resisted; in the mean Time they mann'd and arm'd their Boat, and took Possession of every one of them, plundered them of what they thought fit, and converted one to their own Use, <HI>viz.</HI> a Scooner of 80 Tuns, aboard of which they put 10 Carriage Guns, and 50 Men, and <HI>Low</HI> himself went Captain, and nam'd her the <HI>Fancy,</HI> making one <HI>Charles Harris,</HI> (who was at first forced into their Service out of the <HI>Greyhound</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> Captain <HI>Edwards,</HI> by <HI>Lowther,</HI> of which Ship <HI>Harris</HI> was second Mate) Captain of the Bri∣gantine. Out of these Vessels they took several Hands, and encreased the Company to 80 Men, who all signed the Articles, some willingly, and a few perhaps by Force, and so sailed away from <HI>Marblehead.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this, they met with two Sloops bound for <HI>Boston,</HI> with Provisions for the Garrison, and the Scooner coming up first, attack'd them, but there happening to be an Officer and some Sol∣diers on Board, who gave them such a Reception, that <HI>Low</HI> did not think it prudent to concern him∣self any farther with them, till he was joyn'd by the Brigantine; in the mean while the Sloops made the best of their Way, and the Pyrates gave them Chace two Days, and at last lost sight of them in a Fog.</P>
<P>They now steered away for the Leeward Islands, but in their Voyage met with such a Hurricane of
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
Wind, that the like had not been known; the Sea ran Mountains high, and seem'd to threaten them every Moment with Destruction; it was no Time now to look out for Plunder, but to save themselves, if possible, from perishing. All Hands were continually employed Night and Day on Board the Brigantine, and all little enough, for the Waves went over her, so that the Pump was forced to be kept constantly going, besides baling with Buckets; but finding themselves not able to keep her free, and seeing the utmost Danger before them, they turned to the Takle and hoisted out their Provisions and other heavy Goods, and threw them over-board, with six of their Guns, so that by lightening the Vessel, she might rise to the Top of the Sea with the Waves; they were also going to cut away their Mast, but considering how dan∣gerous it would be, to be left in such a Condition, they resolved to delay it to the last, which was prudent in them so to do; for a Ship without Masts or Sails, lies like a Log upon the Water, and if at∣tack'd, must fight with Disadvantage, for in such a Case, the working of a Ship is the most artful Part of the Engagement, because she may sometimes bring all her great Guns on one Side, to bear upon her Enemy, when the disabled Ship can do little or nothing.</P>
<P>But to proceed; by their throwing over-board the heavy Goods, the Vessel made considerable less Water, and they could keep it under with the Pump only, which gave them Hopes and new Life; so that instead of cutting all away, they took ne∣cessary Measures to secure the Mast, by making Preventor-Shrowds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then Wore and lay too upon the other Tack, till the Storm was over. The Scooner made somewhat better Weather of it, of the two, but was pretty roughly handled notwith∣standing, having split her Mainsail, sprung her Boltsprit, and was forced to cut her Anchors from
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
her Bows. The Brigantine by running away to Lee∣ward, when she wore upon the Larboard Tack, had lost Sight of the Scooner; but not knowing whe∣ther she might be safe or not, as soon as the Wind abated, she set her Main-Sail and Top-Sail, and made short Trips to Windward; and the next Day had the good Fortune to come in Sight of their Consort, who upon a Signal, which the other knew, bore down to her, and the Crew were over∣joy'd to meet again, after such an ill Treatment from the Winds and Seas.</P>
<P>After the Storm, <HI>Low</HI> got safe to a small Island, one of the Weathermost of the <HI>Carribees,</HI> and there fitted their Vessels, as well as the Place could af∣ford; they got Provisions of the Natives, in ex∣change for Goods of their own; and as soon as the Brigantine was ready, 'twas judg'd necessary to take a short Cruize, and leave the Scooner in the Harbour, till her Return. The Brigantine sail'd out accordingly, and had not been out many Days before they met a Ship at Sea, that had lost all her Masts; on Board of whom they went, and took from her in Money and Goods, to the Value of 2000 l. and so left her in the Condition they found her: This Ship was bound home from <HI>Bar∣badoes,</HI> but losing her Masts in the late Storm, was making for <HI>Antegoa,</HI> to refit, where she after∣wards arriv'd.</P>
<P>The Storm just spoken of, was found to have done incredible Damage in those Parts of the World; but, however it appeared to have been more violent at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> both to the Island and Shipping, there was such a prodigious Swell of the Sea, that several hundred Tuns of Stones and Rocks, were throw nover the Wall of the Town of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> and the Town it self was over-flowed, and above half destroy'd, there being the next Morning five Foot Water from one End to the other; the Cannon of
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
Fort <HI>Charles</HI> were dismounted, and some washed into the Sea, and near 400 People lost their Lives; a more melancholly Prospect was scarce ever seen when the Water ebb'd away, all the Streets being covered with Ruins of Houses, Wrecks of Vessels, and a great Number of dead Bodies, for most of the Ships in the Harbour were cast away.</P>
<P>The Brigantine returning to the Island, where she had left the Scooner, who being ready to sail, it was put to the Vote of the Company, what Voyage to take next; and herein they followed the Advice of the Captain, who thought it not advise∣able to go any farther to Leeward, because of the Men of War, who were cruising in their several Stations, which they were not at all fond of meet∣ing, and therefore it was agreed to go to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and afterwards visit the Logwood Cutters, in the Bay of <HI>Honduras.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time in <HI>November</HI> 1722, they got in with the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, and cruising to the Eastward of them, they took two Ships coming from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> one <HI>English,</HI> and the other <HI>French,</HI> bound to St. <HI>Mi∣chaels,</HI> the Commanders Names were <HI>Chandler</HI> and <HI>Roach:</HI> They plundered them of several Sorts of Goods, Provisions and Stores, and let them go; but meeting with an <HI>English</HI> Pink bound to the same Place, with several Passengers on Board, who were willing to fight for what they had, they in∣humanly murthered three or four of them, when they came on Board, tho' they let the Ship pro∣ceed on her Voyage.</P>
<P>After the taking of these Ships, they went into one of the Islands, and took in fresh Water; when they came out again, they seized at <HI>Bonavista,</HI> a Ship call'd the <HI>Liverpool Merchant,</HI> Captain <HI>Goulding;</HI> they took from her a great Quantity of Provisions and dry Goods, 300 Gallons of Brandy, two Guns and Carriages, a Mast, Yard, and Hawsers, and six of
<PB N="290" REF="299"/>
their Men; after which they would not suffer them to trade there, or at St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> with what they had left, but forced Captain <HI>Goulding</HI> to go to the Isle of <HI>May</HI> with his Ship.</P>
<P>Some Days afterwards, they took another Ship belonging to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> the Master's Name <HI>Scot,</HI> whom they plunder'd of what Things they thought fit, and then suffered her to pursue her Voyage. They also took among the said Islands two <HI>Portu∣guese</HI> Sloops, bound for <HI>Brazil,</HI> a small <HI>English</HI> Sloop trading there, <HI>James Pease</HI> Master, a Sloop bound to <HI>Sancta Cruz,</HI> and three Sloops from St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> bound to <HI>Curaso,</HI> whereof <HI>Lilly, Staples</HI> and <HI>Simpkins</HI> were Masters, all which they plundered, and then sail'd from that Station, towards the Coast of <HI>New-York, New England, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They had hardly lost Sight of the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, before they gave Chace to a Sail, and came up with her, which proved to be a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and a rich Prize; she was call'd the <HI>Nostra Signiora de Victoria,</HI> the Commander, Captain <HI>Rodrigues,</HI> bound to <HI>Bahia</HI> from <HI>Viana;</HI> they dispatch'd her with all convenient Speed, and stood away as before. When they came in the Latitude of 33 Degrees, which is in the trade Way of the Vessels, between <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> they cruiz'd off and on for some Time, and intercepted several in their Voyage, <HI>viz.</HI> a Snow from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Curacoa, Robert Leonard</HI> Ma∣ster; a Sloop from the Bay, bound to <HI>New-York, Craig</HI> Master; a Snow from <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bound to <HI>New-York;</HI> and the <HI>Stanhope</HI> Pink, <HI>Andrew Delbridge</HI> Master, from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Boston;</HI> which last they burnt, because of <HI>Low</HI>'s irreconcileable Aversion to <HI>New-England</HI> Men; among whom he had lived for some Time, as has been before taken Notice of, and who being of a vindictive Temper, could never forgive a Person from whom he ima∣gined to have received Injuries; and as his Be∣haviour
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
had merited no extraordinary Treatment at <HI>Boston,</HI> so he met with Usage accordingly, and now he prosecuted his Revenge against all of that Coun∣try, where ever he met them.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>March</HI> 1722-3, Captain <HI>Low,</HI> with the Scooner, Brigantine, and a Sloop lately ta∣ken, entered the Bay of <HI>Honduras,</HI> where he met a Sloop turning out of the said Bay. The Pyrates had hoisted up <HI>Spanish</HI> Colours, and so continued them 'till they drew near the Sloop, when they hall'd them down, hoisted their black Flag, fired a Broad∣side, and boarded her. This Sloop was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of six Guns, and seventy Men, that came into the Bay that Morning, and meeting there with five <HI>English</HI> Sloops, and a Pink, made Prizes of them all, plundered them, and brought the Masters of the Vessels away Prisoners, in order to ransom for the Logwood, and confin'd them in the Hold; their Names were <HI>Tuthill, Norton, Newbury, Sprafort, Clark</HI> and <HI>Parrot.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made no Resistance, so that the <HI>English</HI> Pyrates soon became their Ma∣sters, and fell to rifling; but finding several <HI>English</HI> Goods on Board, they consulted <HI>Low</HI> the Captain thereupon, and without examining any further, the Resolution pass'd to kill all the Company; and the Pyrates, without any Ceremony, fell Pell-Mell to Exe∣cution with their Swords, Cutlashes, Poll-Axes and Pistols, cutting, slashing and shooting the poor <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> at a sad Rate. Some of the miserable Creatures jump'd down into the Hold, but could not avoid the Massacre; they met Death every where, for if they escaped it from one Hand, they were sure to perish by another; the only Prospect they had of Life, was to fly from the Rage of those merciless Men, and to trust to the more merciful Sea; and accordingly a great many leap'd over-board, and swam for the Shore; which <HI>Low</HI> perceiving, ordered the Canoa to be mann'd, and
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
sent in pursuit of them, and so murdered several in the Water, as they were endeavouring to get to the Land; however about twelve of them did reach the Shore, but in a miserable Condition, be∣ing very much wounded, and what became of them afterwards was not known, except one, who fell into the Pyrate's Hands, as they were rioting and making themselves merry at the Watering-Place. This poor Man had received several despe∣rate Wounds, and finding himself weak, without Subsistence or Remedies, he came down to 'em, and beg'd for Jesus sake for Quarters; upon which, one of the Villains took hold of him, and said, <HI>G—d d—n him, he would give him good Quarters presently,</HI> and made the poor <HI>Spaniard</HI> kneel down on his Knees, then taking his Fusil, put the Muzzle of it into his Mouth, and fired down his Throat, which put an End to his unhappy Life. 'Twas thought the rest did not long survive their misera∣ble Condition, and could only prolong their Lives, to add to the Misery of them.</P>
<P>When this bloody Piece of Work was over, they rumaged the <HI>Spanish</HI> Pyrate, and brought all the Booty aboard their own Vessels: The six Masters aforementioned, found in the Hold, they restored to their respective Vessels, but murder'd one <HI>Wickam</HI> a <HI>New-Englard</HI> Master, for Country sake: They forced away the Carpenter from the Pink, and then set Fire to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Sloop, and burnt her; which last Scene concluded the Destruction of their Enemy, Ship and Crew.</P>
<P>The Masters of the Vessels, and <HI>Low,</HI> with the rest of the Pyrates, corresponded freely together, and mutual Civilities passed between them for some Days, till they sail'd; but the Rovers would not suffer them to steer for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they were then bound, for fear the Men of War should get
<PB N="293" REF="302"/>
Intelligence of them, but forced them all to go to <HI>New-York,</HI> threat'ning them with Death, when they met them again, if they refused to comply with their Demands.</P>
<P>In the next Cruize, which was between the Lee∣ward Islands and the Main, they took two Snows, bound from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and a Snow from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>London, Bridds</HI> Master; as also a Ship from <HI>Biddiford</HI> to <HI>Jamaica, John Pinkham</HI> Comman∣der; and two Sloops from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>On the 27th of <HI>May, Low,</HI> and his Consort <HI>Har∣ris,</HI> came off <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and met with three good Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> The Crown, Captain <HI>Lovereigne,</HI> the <HI>King William,</HI> the <HI>Carteret,</HI> and a Brigantine, who all came out of <HI>Carolina</HI> together two Days before. The Pyrates were at the trouble of chacing them, and Captain <HI>Lovereigne</HI> being the sternmost, she fell first a Prey into their Hands; and they spent all the Day in coming up with the rest.</P>
<P>Within few Days, <HI>Low</HI> took a Ship, called, the <HI>Amsterdam Merchant,</HI> Captain <HI>Willard,</HI> from <HI>Jamai∣ca,</HI> but belonging to <HI>New-England,</HI> as <HI>Low</HI> let none of those depart without some Marks of his Rage, he cut off this Gentleman's Ears, slit up his Nose, and cut him in several other Places of his Body, and, after plundering his Ship, let him pursue his Voyage.</P>
<P>Many other vile Actions were done about this Time by <HI>Low,</HI> upon the Coast, where he daily met with Spoil, which did not alone satisfy his inhu∣mane Temper, but, as it were, grew wanton in his Cruelties, putting Men to the most exquisite Tor∣tures, if their Behaviour, or even Looks displeased him. He ty'd lighted Matches between Men's Fingers belonging to a Sloop bound in to <HI>Am∣boy,</HI> whereof <HI>William Frazier</HI> was Master, till the Flesh was all burnt off: He cut some with Knives and Cutlashes, and took all their Provisions away;
<PB N="294" REF="303"/>
and others he set ashore in an uninhabited Part o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kingston,</HI> Captain <HI>Eastwick,</HI> another Ship, on <HI>Burrington</HI> Master, two Brigantines from <HI>Carolina</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>London;</HI> a Sloop from <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>Bermudas;</HI> a Ship from <HI>Glasgow</HI> to <HI>Virginia;</HI> a Scooner from <HI>New-York</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>South-Carolina;</HI> a Pink from <HI>Virginia</HI> to <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Sloop from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to <HI>Surinam,</HI> fell a Prey to these Villains, upon this Cruize, besides those above mentioned.</P>
<P>It happened that at this Time, one of his Majesty's Ships was upon a Cruize, on this Station, and got Intelligence of some of the mischievous Actions of this Miscreant, by one of the Vessels that had been plundered by him, who steering as directed, came in Sight of the Pyrates by break of Day, on the 10th of <HI>June,</HI> of all Days in the Year. The Rovers looking out for Prey, soon saw, and gave Chace to the Man of War, which was called the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> a Ship of 20 Guns and 120 Men, rather inferiour in Force to the two Pyrate Sloops: The <HI>Greyhound</HI> finding them so eager, was in no doubt what they should be, and therefore tack'd and stood from them, giving the Pyrates an Opportu∣nity to chace her for two Hours, till all Things were in Readiness for an Engagement, and the Pyrates about Gun-Shot off; then the <HI>Greyhound</HI> tack'd again and stood towards the two Sloops, one of them called the <HI>Fancy,</HI> commanded by <HI>Low</HI> him∣self, and the other the <HI>Ranger,</HI> commanded by one <HI>Harris,</HI> both which hoisted their pyratical Co∣lours, and fired each a Gun. When the <HI>Grey∣hound</HI> came within Musquet-Shot, she halled up her Main-Sail, and clapp'd close upon a Wind, to keep the Pyrates from running to Leeward, and then engaged; but when the Rogues found who they had to deal with, they edg'd away under the Man of War's Stern, and the <HI>Greyhound</HI> standing after
<PB N="295" REF="304"/>
them, they made a running Fight for about two Hours; but little Wind happening, the Sloops gain∣ed from her, by the help of their Oars; upon which the <HI>Greyhound</HI> left off firing, and turned all Hands to her own Oars, and at three in the Afternoon came up with them. The Pyrates halled upon a Wind to receive the Man of War, and the Fight was immediately renewed, with a brisk Fire on both Sides, till the <HI>Ranger</HI>'s Main-Yard was shot down, and the <HI>Greyhound</HI> pressing close upon the disabled Sloop, <HI>Low,</HI> in the other, thought fit to bear away and leave his Consort a Sacrifice to his Enemy, who (seeing the Cowardice and Trea∣chery of his Commadore and Leader, having ten or twelve Men kill'd and wounded, and that there was no possibility of escaping,) called out for <HI>Quar∣ters,</HI> and surrendered themselves to Justice, which proved severe enough to them a-while after∣wards.</P>
<P>The Conduct of <HI>Low</HI> was surprizing in this Ad∣venture, because his reputed Courage and Bold∣ness, had, hitherto, so possess'd the Minds of all People, that he became a Terror, even to his own Men; but his Behaviour through this whole Action, shewed him to be a base cowardly Villain; for had <HI>Low</HI>'s Sloop fought half so briskly as <HI>Harris</HI>'s did, and had stood as close to the Business, (as they were under a solemn Oath to do,) the Man of War could never have hurted them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greyhound</HI> carried in their Prize to <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> to the great Joy of the whole Province, tho' it had been more compleat, if the great <HI>LOW</HI> him∣self had grac'd the Triumph. The Prisoners were strongly secured in a Goal, till a Court of Vice-Admiralty could be held for their Tryals, which begun on the 10th of <HI>July,</HI> at <HI>Newport,</HI> and continu∣ed three Days. The Court was made up of the following Gentlemen.</P>

<P><Q>“THIS Court having taken into their Consi∣deration the great Service lately done to this Province in particular, as well as to all other his Majesty's good Subjects in general, by Cap∣tain <HI>Peter Solgard,</HI> Commander of his Majesty's Ship the <HI>Greyhound,</HI> the Station Ship of the Pro∣vince, who lately in a Cruize upon this Coast, in due Execution and Discharge of his Duty, up∣on Intelligence given him, sought for, pursued and engaged two Pyrate Sloops, commanded by one <HI>Low,</HI> (a notorious and inhumane Pyrate,) one of which Sloops he took after a resolute Re∣sistance, and very much shattered the other, who by the Favour of the Night escaped. Twenty six of which Pyrates so taken, being lately exe∣cuted at <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> not only eased this City and Province of a very great Trouble, but of a very considerable Expence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is therefore re∣solved <HI>(Nemine Contradicente)</HI> that this Corpora∣tion do present the said Captain <HI>Solgard,</HI> with the Freedom of this Corporation, as a Mark of the great Esteem they have for his Person, as well as for the aforesaid great and good Services; and that the Seal of the said Freedom be enclosed in a Gold Box; that Mr. <HI>Recorder,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bick∣ley,</HI> do draw the Draught of the said Freedom, signifying therein the grateful Sense of this

The Safety and Freedom of our own Trade and Commerce, and of all the neighbouring Provinces on this
<PB N="300" REF="309"/>
Continent, such signal Service done against the Enemies of Mankind, merits the Applause of all good Men, but more immediately from those of this Province, who are appointed his particular Care and Charge.

<P>But to return to <HI>Low,</HI> who run from the <HI>Grey∣hound</HI> with as much Fury and Passion, as if he had suffered the greatest Indignity and Affront that could be put upon a Man of his nice Honour; he vowed to sacrifice all he should meet with to
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
his Resentments; and the bloody Monster had near Hand been as good as his Word, if his own Companions had not put some Constraint upon his Actions. In this Flight he met with a Sloop be∣longing to <HI>Nantucket,</HI> a Whale-Fishing, about 80 Miles from Land; the Master of which, one <HI>Na∣than Skiff,</HI> a brisk young Fellow, the Pyrates cruel∣ly whipp'd naked about the Deck, making his Torture their Sport; after which they cut off his Ears, and last of all, Shot him thro' the Head, and then sunk his Vessel; putting the rest of the Hands into their Whale-Boat, with a Compass, a little Water, and a few Biskets; and it being good Weather, they providentialy got safe to <HI>Nantucket,</HI> beyond all Expectation.</P>
<P>There was another Whale-Boat belonging to the Sloop last mentioned, which happened to be at some Distance from her, and perceiving what was doing, rowed with all speed to another Sloop not far off, to acquaint her with the Misfortune, that the Men might take Care of themselves; and she happily got away in Time. Some Days after, <HI>Low</HI> took a Fishing-Boat off of <HI>Block Island,</HI> but did not perpetrate so much Cruelty to her, contenting himself with only cutting off the Master's Head; but after taking two Whale Boats near <HI>Rhode Island,</HI> he caused one of the Master's Body to be rip'd up, and his Intrails to be taken out; and cut off the Ears of the other, and made him eat them him∣self with Pepper and Salt; which hard Injun∣ction he complyed with, without making a Word-Several other Persons he would have murthered, but Humanity prevailing in the tender Hearts of his Companions, they refused to put his savage Orders in Execution.</P>
<P>From the Coast of <HI>New-England, Low</HI> sailed di∣rectly for <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and, near Cape <HI>Briton,</HI> took two, or three and twenty <HI>French</HI> Vessels; and one
<PB N="302" REF="311"/>
of them of 22 Guns he mann'd with Pyrates, making a sort of a Man of War of her, and scour∣ing the Harbours and Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> took sixteen or eighteen other Ships and Vessels, all which they plundered, and some destroyed.</P>
<P>In this Cruiz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Low</HI> fell sick and dy'd, as I am in∣formed, tho' I am apt to believe he was cut off by some of his Crew, who lately grew weary of his insolent and tyrannical Government. He was thirty eight Years of Age, a strong well set Man, not tall, but big boned: His Cruelty and Inhuma∣nity to Prisoners that fell into his Hands, was not so generally approved of by therest of the Pyrates, how∣ever criminal they might be in other Respects; nor indeed could all his Barbarities be related, much less beheld without giving Nature a Shock. Among all the lawless Rulers of the Sea, never any came up to him in Cruelty, nor did the dying Groans of those he butchered give him Compunction, or move any Passion in the Brute, but Anger, Rage and Scorn: Even in his good Humours a Man could not assure himself of Safety from him, for Danger lurked in his very Smiles; as for Instance, at the taking of a <HI>Virginia</HI> Man, Captain <HI>Graves,</HI> the Master of her, came on Board his Sloop, and at the first Salutation, <HI>Low</HI> takes a small Bowl of Punch in his Hand, and drinks to him, saying, <HI>Captain</HI> Graves, <HI>here is half this to you.</HI> But the poor Gentleman being grieved at the Misfortune of fall∣ing into his Hands, modestly desired to be excu∣sed; whereupon <HI>Low</HI> draws out a Pistol, and cocks it, and taking the Bowl in 'tother Hand, swore he should either take one or the other; so <HI>Graves</HI> with∣out any Hesitation, made choice of the Vehicle that contained the Punch, and guttled down about a Quart, when he had the least Inclination in the World to be merry.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="312"/>
Another Time when <HI>Low</HI> met with a Vessel be∣longing to the Royal <HI>African</HI> Company, he asked several frivolous Questions concerning the Gover∣nor and Directors of that Company, and made the Men kneel down, and drink Confusion and Dam—n to them all, and to the Duke of <HI>Chandois,</HI> in parti∣cular; and afterwards told the Men, as they were employ'd in that Service, (meaning the Compa∣ny's,) and who consequently were their Masters, they ought to behave themselves with all the Respect and Duty that was necessary towards them; and then made them drink the Duke's and all the rest of their Healths, and to the Company's Pros∣perity, in the same Posture as when they were obliged to curse them. Several other idle and foolish Frolicks were frequently play'd by <HI>Low</HI> and his Companions, but we shall wave them, and hasten to the Conclusion of our Story.</P>
<P>In the Room of <HI>Low,</HI> another Captain was made, not so morose in his Temper, nor cruel in the Execution of their Villanies, but what his Name is, I have not learned. The Pyrates sailed from <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> to the Islands of <HI>Azores,</HI> in <HI>September</HI> last, and there came in Company with <HI>Lowther,</HI> with whom they scower'd all the little Islands, and took a Number of Ships and Vessels. They sailed into <HI>Fyal,</HI> where six or seven Ships and Ves∣sels lay at Anchor, three of them <HI>Portuguese,</HI> of Force, but no sooner their black Flag appear'd, but they struck and yeilded to the Pyrates Mercy. At other Harbours they sent in their Boats, and brought the Vessels out, while the Ship and Sloop were cruising off the Island. These Transactions of the Rovers greatly enraged the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and made them suspect every <HI>English</HI> Vessel to be a Pyrate, which had like to have proved fatal to one Captain <HI>Tillinghast,</HI> who happened to come into <HI>Fyal,</HI> a few Days after the Pyrates had visited that Harbour,
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
and knowing nothing of the Matter, was surpri∣zed with several Shot from the Town, insomuch, that he was obliged to lower his Sails and come to, and go ashore with a few Hands: He was sent to Goal, and Orders given to search his Vessel; his Chest of Papers were brought on Shore and peru∣sed by some <HI>English</HI> Merchants and others; but not finding any Thing whereby they might ac∣cuse him of Pyracy, he was at length set at Liberty.</P>
<P><HI>Lowther</HI> sailed from the <HI>Azores,</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and the Crew lately under <HI>Low,</HI> steered to the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, where we do not find any great Matters were done, but sailing thence, they arrived upon the Coast of <HI>Guiney,</HI> where, about <HI>Christmas</HI> last, they took the <HI>Delight,</HI> Captain <HI>Hunt,</HI> and <HI>Squirrel,</HI> Captain <HI>Stephenson,</HI> which is the last News we have heard concerning them.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. OF Capt. <HI>JOHN EVANS,</HI> And his CREW.</HEAD>
<P><HI>JOhn Evans</HI> was a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, had been formerly Master of a Sloop belonging to <HI>Nevis,</HI> but losing his Employ there, he sailed for some Time out of <HI>Jamaica</HI> as Mate, till happening in Company of three or four of his Comrades, and Wages not being so good as formerly, and Birth's scarce, be∣cause of the great Number of Seamen; they agreed to go abroad in search of Adventures. They sailed, or rather row'd out of <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> the latter End of <HI>September</HI> 1722, in a Canoa; and com∣ing on the North-Side of the Island, went ashore in the Night, broke open a House or two, and rob'd them of some Money, and every Thing else they could find that was portable, and brought the Booty on Board the Canoa.</P>
<P>This was very well for the first Time, but this kind of Robbery did not please so well, they wan∣ted to get out to Sea, but having no Vessel but their Canoa, they were prevented in their lauda∣ble Design; however, they kept a good look out, and traversed the Island, in Expectation that Pro∣vidence would send some unfortunate Vessel for a
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
Sacrifice, and in a few Days their Wishes were ac∣complished; for at <HI>Duns Hole,</HI> they found a small Sloop at an Anchor, belonging to <HI>Bermudas:</HI> They made bold and went aboard, and <HI>Evans</HI> informed the Folks that belonged to her, that he was Cap∣tain of the Vessel, which was a Piece of News they knew not before. After they had put their Affairs in a proper Disposition aboard, they went ashore to a little Village for Refreshments, and lived jovialy the remaining Part of the Day, at a Tavern, spending three Pistoles, and then departed. The People of the House admired at the merry Guests they had got, were mightily pleased, and wished for their Company at another Time; which happened too soon for their Profit; for in the middle of the Night, they came ashore all Hands, rifled the House, and carried what they could aboard their Sloop.</P>
<P>The next Day they weighed in the Sloop, aboard of which they mounted four Guns, and called her the <HI>Scowerer,</HI> and sailed to <HI>Hispaniola;</HI> on the North Part of the Island they took a <HI>Spanish</HI> Sloop, which proved an extraordinary rich Prize, as it fell among so few Persons as this Company consisted of, for they shared upwards of 150 <HI>l.</HI> a Man.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of the Game, and beating up for the Windward Islands, the <HI>Scowerer</HI> met with a Ship from <HI>New-England,</HI> bound to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> 120 Tuns, called the <HI>Dove,</HI> Captain <HI>Diamond,</HI> Master, off <HI>Porto Rico:</HI> They plundered her, and strengthened their own Company, by taking out the Mate, and two or three other Men; they discharged the Prize, and run into one of the Islands, for fresh Water and Ne∣cessaries, and staid there some Time.</P>
<P>The next Prize they made, was the <HI>Lucretia</HI> and <HI>Catherine,</HI> Captain <HI>Mills,</HI> of 200 Tun Burthen; they came up with her near the Island <HI>Disscada, January</HI> 11th. Upon seizing of this Ship, the Pyrates be∣gan
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
to take upon themselves the Distribution of Justice, examining the Men concerning their Ma∣ster's Usage of them, according to the Custom of other Pyrates; but the Captain over-hearing the Matter, put an End to the Judicial Proceedings, and fell to rumaging the Ship, saying to them, <HI>What have we to do to turn Reformers, 'tis Money we want?</HI> And speaking to the Prisoners, he asked them, <HI>Does your Captain give you Victuals enough?</HI> and they answer∣ing in the Affirmitive: <HI>Why then,</HI> said he, <HI>he ought to give you Work enough.</HI></P>
<P>After the taking of this Prize, they went to the little Island of <HI>Avis,</HI> with a Design to clean, and carryed the <HI>Lucretia</HI> along with them, in order to heave down the <HI>Scowerer</HI> by her; but meeting there with a Sloop, the Pyrate gave Chace till the Eve∣ning, when she was within Gun-Shot of her; but fearing to lose Company with the <HI>Lucretia,</HI> who was a heavy Sailor, they left off, and saw her no more. This Chace brought them to Leeward of their Port, so that they were obliged to look out for another Place of Retreat, and the Island of <HI>Ruby</HI> not being far distant, they steered for that, and anchored there accordingly; but the next Day a <HI>Dutch</HI> Sloop coming as it were, into their Mouths, they could not forbear dealing, and so making her their Prize, they plundered her of what came, when shared, to fifty Pounds a Man.</P>
<P>They found this Sloop more for their Purpose than the <HI>Lucretia,</HI> to clean their own Sloop by, as being much lower in the Wast, and therefore capa∣ble of heaving her bottom farther out of the Wa∣ter, so she was discharged, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Man kept in her Room; but not thinking it convenient to lay up here, for fear a Discovery should be made, they turned their Thoughts another Way, and steered to the Coast of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where they took a Sugar Drover, and then run to the <HI>Grand Camanoes,</HI>
<PB N="308" REF="317"/>
about 30 Leagues to Leeward of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> with In∣tention to clean there; but an unhappy Accident put an End to their Pyracies, which hitherto had proved very successful to them.</P>
<P>The Boatswain of the Pyrate being a noisy surly Fellow, the Captain had several times Words with him, relating to his Behaviour, who thinking himself ill treated, not only returned ill Language, but also challenged the Captain to fight him on the next Shore they came to, with Pistols and Sword, as is the Custom among these Outlaws. When the Sloop arrived, as above mentioned, the Captain proposed the Duel; but the cowardly Boatswain re∣fused to fight, or go ashore, tho' it was his own Challenge. When Captain <HI>Evans</HI> saw there was no∣thing to be done with him, he took his Cane, and gave him a hearty drubbing; but the Boatswain not being able to bear such an Indignity, drew out a Pistol, and shot <HI>Evans</HI> thro' the Head, so that he fell down dead; and the Boatswain immediately jumped over-board, and swam towards the Shore; but the Boat was quickly mann'd and sent after him, which took him up, and brought him aboard.</P>
<P>The Death of the Captain in that Manner, pro∣voked all the Crew, and they resolved the Crimi∣nal should dye by the most exquisite Tortures; but while they were considering of the Punishment, the Gunner, with most opprobrius Terms, fired with the utmost Indignation, and shot him thro' the Body with a Pistol; but not killing him, the De∣linquent, in very moving Words, desired a Week for Repentance only; but another stepping up to him, told him, <HI>that he should repent and be damned to him,</HI> and without more ado shot him dead.</P>
<P>I should have observed, that when the <HI>Lucretia</HI> and <HI>Katherine</HI> was suffered to go away, the Pyrates detained their Mate, who was now the only Man aboard, who understood Navigation, and him they
<PB N="309" REF="318"/>
desired to take upon him the Command of the Sloop, in the Room of Captain <HI>Evans</HI> deceased; but he desired to be excused that Honour, and at length positively refused it; so they agreed to break up the Company, and leave the Mate in Possession of the Vessel: Accordingly they went ashore at the <HI>Cam∣manoes,</HI> carrying with them about nine thousand Pounds, among thirty Persons; and it being fair Weather, the Mate and a Boy brought the Vessel into <HI>Port Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica.</HI></P>
<DIV3>
<P>I am come now to the End of my Account of the <HI>English</HI> Pyrates, having brought it home to the pre∣sent Time; for, to this Day, <HI>May</HI> the 9th, there has not been any Account come to <HI>England,</HI> of Pyracies committed, since these I have mentioned. If I find that what I have done proves acceptable to the Publick, I may be more particular hereafter. I will only add two Relations more, which I think are extraordinary in their Nature; the one of them is so well known, as not perhaps to be needful here, but that I shall leave to the Reader's Judgment, and with them I conclude the History.</P>
<P>A Brigantine belonging to <HI>Bristol,</HI> one <HI>Mr. Row∣ry</HI> Master, had been trading at <HI>Gambia,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and falling as low as Cape <HI>Mount,</HI> to finish the slaving of the Vessel, he had, by a Misfortune usual at that Part of the Coast, his Mate, Surgeon, and two more of his Men, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Term for stealing of Men used all over the Coast.</NOTE> <HI>Panyarr'd</HI> by the Ne∣groes. The Remainder of his Company, which was not above five or six in Number, took this Op∣portunity, and seized the Vessel in the Road, ma∣king the Master Prisoner.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="319"/>
You will think it prodigious impudent that so small a Number should undertake to proceed a pyrating, especially when neither of them had suf∣ficient Skill in Navigation: Yet this they did, lea∣ving those People, their Ship-mates abovemention'd, to the Mercy of the barbarous Natives, and sail'd away down the Coast, making them a black Flag, which they merrily said, would be as good as 50 Men more, <HI>i. e.</HI> would carry as much Terror; and that they did not doubt of soon increasing their Crew, to put them in an enterprising Capacity; but their vain Projection was soon happily frustra∣ted, and after this Manner.</P>
<P>The Master whose Life they had preserved, (per∣haps only for supplying their own Unskillfulness in Navigation,) advised them, that since contrary to their Expectations, they had met with no Ship between <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Mount,</HI> and the <HI>Bite</HI> of <HI>Calabar,</HI> to pro∣ceed to the Island of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s, where they might recruit with Provisions and Water, and sell off the Slaves (about 70 of them) which they perceived would be a useless Lumber, and incommodious to their Design. They arrived there in <HI>August</HI> 1721, and one Evening, while Part of them were on Shore, applying for this Purpose to the Governor, and the other Part carelesly from the Deck, Mr. <HI>Rowry</HI> stepped into the Beat belonging to the Vessel, and pushed off, very suddenly: They heard the Noise it made, and soon were upon Deck again, but ha∣ving no other Boat to pursue, nor a Musket ready to fire, he got safe on Shore, and ran to the Gover∣nor with his Complaint, who immediately impri∣soned those already there, and sent a Launch off to take the rest out of the Ship.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swallow</HI> arrived at St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s the beginning of <HI>October</HI> following, where, on Mr. <HI>Rowry</HI>'s Remon∣strance, Application was made to the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Go∣vernor of that Island, for a Surrendery of these five
<PB N="311" REF="320"/>
<HI>English</HI> Prisoners then in the Castle; but he not on∣ly peremptorily excused himself from it, as a Mat∣ter out of his Power, without particular Direction from the Court of <HI>Portugal;</HI> but withal insinuated, that they had only taken Refuge there from the Hardships and Severity they had met with from their Master. The manner of Denial, and the ava∣ritious Temper of the Gentleman, which I had Oc∣casion to be acquainted with, makes it very suspi∣cious, that he proposed considerable Gains to him∣self; for if Mr. <HI>Rowry</HI> had not made such an Escape to him, the Slaves had been his for little or nothing, as a Bribe to silence his Suspicions, which any Man, less acute than he, must have had from the awkward and unskilful Carriage of such Merchants. But enough of this; perhaps he is not the only Governor a∣broad that finds an Interest in countenancing these Fellows.</P>

<HEAD>An Account of the Pyracies and Mur∣ders committed by <HI>Philip Roche, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>PHilip Roch</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and from his Youth had been bred up to the Sea; he was a brisk genteel Fellow, of 30 Years of Age at the time of his Death; one whose black and savage Nature did no ways answer the Comliness of his Person, his Life being almost one continu'd Scene of Villany, be∣fore he was discover'd to have committed the hor∣rid Murthers we are now speaking of.</P>
<P>This inhumane Monster had been concern'd with others, in insuring Ships to a great Value, and then destroying them; by which Means, and other Rogueries, he had got a little Money; and being Mate of a Ship, was dilligent enough in trading for
<PB N="312" REF="321"/>
himself between <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> so that he was in a Way of getting himself a comfortable Liveli∣hood: But, as he resolved to be rich, and finding fair Dealing brought in Wealth but slowly, he con∣triv'd to put other Things in Execution, and cer∣tainly had murthered several innocent Persons' in the Prosecution of his abominable Schemes; but as I have now forgot the particular Circumstances of those Relations, I shall confine my self at present to the Fact for which he suffer'd.</P>
<P><HI>Roch</HI> getting acquainted with one <HI>Neal,</HI> a Fisher∣man at <HI>Cork,</HI> whom he found ready for any villainous Attempt, he imparted his Design to him, who be∣ing pleased with the Project, brings one <HI>Pierce Cullen</HI> and his Brother into the Confederacy, together with one <HI>Wise,</HI> who at first was very unwilling to come into their Measures, and, indeed, had the least Hand in the Perpetration of what follows.</P>
<P>They pitch'd upon a Vessel in the Harbour, be∣longing to <HI>Peter Tartoue,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Man, to execute their cruel Intentions upon, because it was a small one, and had not a great Number of Hands on Board, and 'twas easy afterwards to exchange it for one more fit for Pyracy; and therefore they ap∣ply'd themselves to the Master of her, for a Passage to <HI>Nantz,</HI> whereto the Ship was bound; and accor∣dingly, the beginning of <HI>November</HI> 1721, they went aboard; and when at Sea, <HI>Philip Roche,</HI> being an expe∣rienced Sailor, the Master of the Vessel readily trusted him with the Care of her, at times, while he and the Mate went to rest.</P>
<P>The 15th of <HI>November,</HI> at Night, was the Time designed for the Tragedy; but <HI>Francis Wise</HI> relented, and appear'd desirous to divert them from their bloody Purposes. <HI>Roche</HI> (sometimes called Cap∣tain) told him, <HI>That as</HI> Cullen <HI>and he had sustained great Losses at Sea, unless every</HI> Irishman <HI>present would assist in repairing their Losses, by murthering all the</HI> French
<PB N="313" REF="322"/>
<HI>Rogues, and running away with the Ship, he should suffer the same Fate with the</HI> Frenchmen; <HI>but if all would as∣sist, all should have a Share in the Booty.</HI> Upon this they all resolved alike, and Captain <HI>Roch</HI> ordered three <HI>Frenchmen</HI> and a Boy up to Hand the Topsails, the Master and Mate being then asleep in their Ca∣bins. The two first that came down, they beat out their Brains, and threw them over-board: The other two seeing what was done, ran up to the Top-mast Head, but <HI>Cullen</HI> follow'd them, and taking the Boy by the Arm, tost him into the Sea; then dri∣ving down the Man, those below knock'd him on the Head, and threw him over-board.</P>
<P>Those who were asleep being awakened by the dismal Shrieks and Groans of dying Men, ran upon Deck in Confusion, to enquire into the Cause of such unusual Noises; but the same Cruelty was immediately acted towards them, e'er they could be sensible of the Danger that threat'ned them.</P>
<P>They were now (as <HI>Roche</HI> himself afterwards con∣fess'd) <HI>all over as wet with the Blood that had been spilt, as if they had been dip'd in Water, or stood in a Shower of Rain; nor did they regard it any more. Roche</HI> said, Captain <HI>Tartoue</HI> used many Words for Mercy, and ask'd them, if he had not used them with Civility and Kindness? If they were not of the same Chri∣stian Religion, and own'd the same blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> and the like? But they, not regarding what he said, took Cords, and bound the poor Master and his Mate, Back to Back, and while that was doing, both of them begged with the utmost Earnestness, and used the most solemn Intreaties, that they would at least allow them a few Minutes to say their Prayers, and beg Mercy of God for the various Sins and Of∣fences of their Lives: But it did not move them, (though all the rest were dead, and no Danger could be apprehended from them two alone) for the bound Persons were hurry'd up and thrown into the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="323"/>
The Massacre being finish'd, they wash'd them∣selves a little from the Blood, and searched the Chests and Lockers, and all Places about the Ship, and then set down in the Captain's Cabin, and refreshed themselves with some Rum they found there, and (as <HI>Roche</HI> confessed) were never merrier in their Lives. They invested <HI>Roche</HI> with the Command of the Ship, and calling him Captain, talked over their Liquor, what rare Actions they would perform about Cape <HI>Briton, Sable Isle,</HI> and the <HI>Banks</HI> of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> whither they design∣ed to go as soon as they had recruited their Company, and got a better Ship, which they pro∣posed speedily to do.</P>
<P><HI>Roche</HI> taking upon himself the Command of the Vessel, <HI>Andrew Callen</HI> was to pass for a Merchant, or Super-cargo; but then they bethought themselves, that they were in Danger of being discovered by the Papers in the Ship, relating to the Cargo, as Bills of Lading, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> therefore they erase and take out the Name of the <HI>French</HI> Master, and instead thereof, inserted the Name of <HI>Roche,</HI> so that it stood in the Ship's Papers, <HI>Peter Roche,</HI> Master; that then having so few Hands on Board, they contri∣ved if they met any Ships, to give out, that they had lost some Hands by their being wash'd over∣board in a Storm, and by that means screen them∣selves from being suspected of having committed some such wicked Act, by reason of the fewness of their Hands on board; and also might prevail with some Ship to spare them some, on Consideration of their pretended Disaster.</P>
<P>In going to <HI>Cales</HI> they were in Distress by the Weather, and being near <HI>Lisbon,</HI> they made Com∣plaint to a Ship, but obtain'd no Assistance. They were then obliged to sail back for <HI>England,</HI> and put into the Port of <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> but then they were in Fear lest they might be discovered, therefore to pre∣vent
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
that, they resolve to alter the Ship, and getting Workmen, they take down the Mizen-mast, and build a Spar Deck, and made Rails, (on pretence that the Sailors had been wash'd overboard) to se∣cure the Men. Then they took down the Image of St <HI>Peter</HI> at the Head of the Ship, and put up a Lion in its Place, and painted over the Stern of the Ship with Red, and new nam'd her, the <HI>May</HI> Snow. The Ship being thus alter'd that they thought it could not be known, they fancy'd themselves pretty se∣cure; but wanting Money to defray the Charge of these Alterations, <HI>Roche,</HI> as Master of the Vessel, and <HI>Andrew Cullen,</HI> as Merchant, apply themselves to the Officers of the Customs for Liberty to dispose of some of the Cargo, in order to pay the Work∣men; which they having obtained, they sold fifty eight Barrels of Beef, and having hired three more Hands, they set Sail for <HI>Ostend,</HI> and there having sold more Barrels of Beef, they steer their Course to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> dispose of the rest of the Cargoe, and took in one Mr. <HI>Annesley,</HI> who freighted the Ship for <HI>England;</HI> but in their Passage, in a stormy Night, it being very dark, they took up Mr. <HI>Annesly</HI> their Passenger, and threw him into the Sea, who swam about the Ship a pretty while, calling out for Life, and telling them, they should have all his Goods, if they would receive him again into the Vessel: But in vain were his Cries!</P>
<P>After this, they were obliged to put into seve∣ral Ports, and by contrary Winds, came to the Coast of <HI>France,</HI> and hearing there was an Enqui∣ry made after the Ship, <HI>Roche</HI> quits her at <HI>Havre de Grace,</HI> and leaves the Management to <HI>Cullen</HI> and the rest; who having shipp'd other Men, saill'd away to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and there quitted the Vessel, which was afterwards seized and brought into the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325"/>
Some Time after this, <HI>Philip Roche</HI> came to <HI>London,</HI> and making some Claim for Money, he had made Insurance of, in the Name of <HI>John Eustace;</HI> the Office was appriz'd of the Fraud, and he arrested and flung into the Counter; from whence directing a Letter to his Wife, she shewed it to a Friend, who discovered by it, that he was the principal Villain concerned in the Destruction of <HI>Peter Tartoue,</HI> and the Crew. Upon this, an Information was given to my Lord <HI>Carteret,</HI> that the Person who went by the Name of <HI>John Eustace,</HI> was <HI>Philip Roche,</HI> as aforesaid; and being brought down by his Lordships Warrant, he stifly deny'd it for some Time, notwithstanding a Letter was found in his Pocket, directed to him by the Name of <HI>Roche;</HI> but being confronted by a Captain of a Ship, who knew him well, he con∣fessed it, but prevaricated in several Particulars; whereupon he was committed to <HI>Newgate</HI> upon violent Suspicion, and the next Day was brought down again at his own request, confessed the whole, desired to be made an Evidence, and promised to convict three Men worse than himself. Two were discovered by him, who died miserably in the <HI>Mar∣shalsea,</HI> and <HI>Roche</HI> himself was afterwards try'd, (no more being taken,) found Guilty of the Pyracy, and executed</P>

<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Pyrate is</HI> Hostis humanis generis, <HI>a common Enemy, with whom neither Faith nor Oath is to be kept, according to</HI> Tully. <HI>And by the Laws of Nature, Princes and States are re∣sponsible for their Neglect, if they do not provide Reme∣dies for restraining these sort of Robberies. Though Py∣rates are called common Enemies, yet they are properly not to be term'd so. He is only to be honoured with that Name, says</HI> Cicero, <HI>who hath a Commonwealth, a Court, a Trea∣sury, Consent and Concord of Citizens, and some Way, if Occasion be, of Peace and League: But when they have reduced themselves into a Government or State, as those of</HI> Algier, Sally, Tripoli, Tunis, <HI>and the like, they then are allowed the Solemnities of War, and the Rights of Le∣gation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Letters of</HI> Marque <HI>be granted to a Merchant, and he furnishes out a Ship, with a Captain and Mariners, and they, instead of taking the Goods, or Ships, of that Nation against whom their Commission is awarded, take the Ship and Goods of a Friend, this is Pyracy; and if the Ship arrive in any Part of his Majesty's Dominions, it will be seized, and for ever lost to the Owners; but they are no way liable to make Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a Ship is assaulted and taken by the Pyrates, for Re∣demption of which, the Master becomes a Slave to the Cap∣tors, by the Law</HI> Marine, <HI>the Ship and Lading are tacitly obliged for his Redemption, by a general Contribution; but if</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
<HI>it happen through his own Folly, then no Contribution is to be made.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Subjects in Enmity with the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>are aboard an</HI> English <HI>Pyrate, in Company with</HI> English, <HI>and a Robbery is committed, and they are taken; it is Felony in the</HI> English, <HI>but not in the Stranger; for it was no Py∣racy in them, but the Depredation of an Enemy, and they will be tried by a Martial Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If Pyracy is committed by Subjects in Enmity with</HI> Eng∣land, <HI>upon the</HI> British <HI>Seas, it is properly, only punishable by the Crown of</HI> England, <HI>who have</HI> istud regimen &amp; Dominium <HI>exclusive of all other Power.</HI></P>

<P><HI>If Merchandize be delivered to a Master, to carry to one Port, and he carries it to another, and sells and disposes of it, this is not Felony; but if, after unlading it at the first Port, he retakes it, it is Pyracy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a Pyrate attack a Ship, and the Master for Redemption, gives his Oath to pay a Sum of Money, tho' there be nothing taken, yet it is Pyracy by the Law</HI> Marine.</P>
<P><HI>If a Ship is riding at Anchor, and the Mariners all ashore, and a Pyrate attack her, and rob her, this is Pyracy.</HI></P>

<P><HI>If a Pyrate enters a Port of this Kingdom, and robs a Ship at Anchor there, it is not Pyracy, because not done,</HI> super altum Mare; <HI>but is Robbery at common Law, be∣cause</HI> infra Corpus Comitatus. <HI>A Pardon of all Felonies does not extend to Pyracy, but the same ought to be especially named.</HI></P>
