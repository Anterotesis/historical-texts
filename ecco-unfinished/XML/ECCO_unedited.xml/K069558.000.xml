<P>It has been further advised that every select Parcel of the said <HI>Pamphlets</HI>, amounting to the Quan∣tity of one Sheet, shall be, in this <HI>Catalogue, chronologically</HI> digested; not only the better to display the Picture and Posture of the <HI>Times in general</HI>, as far as every Number will permit, in their most natural and regular Symmetry; but to shorten every curious Reader's Researches after any <HI>particular Pamphlet</HI>; who remembring only about what Time it was printed, is saved the Trouble of Hunting through every <HI>Column</HI>, by turning to that <HI>One</HI>, in which the Date should appear; and if he finds it not in <HI>one</HI> Number, a little Patience may bring him to it in <HI>another</HI>.</P>

<Q><HI>Camden</HI>, and other Writers on Queen <HI>Eli∣sabeth</HI>'s Reign, have borrowed Light from this Pamphlet; and, if some Ecclesiastical Historians also of those Times had more copiously extracted it, they might have given more Satisfaction to their Readers.</Q>

<Q>This Tract is dedicated to <HI>Phillip</HI>, Earl of <HI>Arundell</HI>. The Author was a noted Town-writer of his Time; and published many Pamphlets of Entertainment in Prose and Verse. He was reputed Master of a clear and elegant Style, and numbered among the Improvers of our Language in those Days. He could shew a Variety of Reading upon any Subject, by his <HI>Allusions, Comparisons</HI>, &amp;c. which he had ready upon all Occasions; but at last fell into irregular Courses of Life, which brought him to Want, Misery, and Repentance. He died of a Surfeit upon pickled Herrings and <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine, on the Third of <HI>Septemb.</HI> in the Year 1592. Many of his Pamphlets were reprinted after his Death, to the good Profit of their Publishers.</Q>
<P N="11">11. A Pack of <HI>Spanish</HI> Lyes sent abroad in the World; first printed in <HI>Spain</HI>, in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Tongue, and translated out of the Original; now ripped up, unfolded, and, by just Exami∣nation, <HI>condemned</HI>; as conteyning false, corrupt, and detestable Wares, worthy to be damned and burned. Imprinted at <HI>London</HI>, by the Depu∣ties of <HI>Chr. Barker</HI>, Printer to the Queen's most excellent Majestie, (in thirteen Pages) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1588</P>
<Q>This Work is printed in two Columns— The <HI>Pack of</HI> Spanish <HI>Lyes</HI> in the old <HI>English</HI> Character (or <HI>black Letter</HI>, as it is commonly called) and the <HI>Condemnation</HI>, collaterally, in the <HI>Roman</HI> Character; and rectifies, in every Particular, the said <HI>Spanish</HI> Misrepresentation
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>
of the renowned Defeat of their <HI>Invincible Armado</HI>.</Q>
<P N="12">12. A <HI>Discovery</HI> of <HI>discontented Minds</HI>; wherein their several Sortes and Purposes are described; especially such as <HI>go beyond the Seas</HI>. At <HI>Oxford</HI>, printed by <HI>Joseph Barnes</HI>, Printer to the University, (in thirty-four Pages) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1596</P>
<Q>The Author, <HI>James Perrott</HI>, as he signs himself at the End of his Dedication to <HI>Robert</HI>, Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>, was the natural Son of Sir <HI>John Perrot</HI>, Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI>. He was afterwards knighted, and a frequent Member of Parliament. This was the Au∣thor's first Publication (unknown to <HI>A. Wood.</HI>) It is discreetly and learnedly handled, for a young Man of twenty-five Years of Age; and founded upon a solid and loyal View of restraining those dangerous Malecontents, whether Scholars, or Soldiers, who did, ma∣ny of them, in his Time, turn Fugitives, and Renegades; settling themselves in Foreign Countries, especially under the Umbrage of <HI>Spain</HI>, to negotiate Conspiracies, Invasions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with their traiterous Correspondents in <HI>England</HI>. The Author died in 1636, hav∣ing printed some other Pieces; but his <HI>Life of Sir Philip Sidney</HI> (never published) is most desireable; and would in all Probability set forth that gallant and accomplished Gentle∣man's Virtues and Actions, in a more con∣spicuous Light than does appear in the faint and inexpressive Draught that has been left us by his great Friend, Sir <HI>Fulk Grevill</HI>.</Q>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Saint GEORGE for ENGLAND</HI>, al∣legorically described. By <HI>Gerard de Malynes</HI>, Merchant. <HI>Veritas Temporis Filia</HI>. Imprinted at <HI>London</HI>, by <HI>Richard Field</HI>, (in eighty Pages) <HI>Octavo</HI>, 1601</P>
<Q>This Author dedicates his Work to the Lord Keeper <HI>Egerton</HI>; "from an affectio∣nate Desire to his Honour's Service; where|"unto, before all Men, he acknowledges him∣self, bounden." And, in his said Epistle to him, has also these Words:
<Q>“Whereas un∣der the Person of the noble Champion, St. <HI>George</HI>, our Saviour <HI>Christ</HI> was prefigured, delivering the <HI>Virgin</HI> (which did signify the sinfull <HI>Souls</HI> of <HI>Christians</HI>) from the <HI>Dragon</HI> or <HI>Divels</HI> Power; so her most excellent <HI>Majesty</HI>, by advancing the pure Doctrine of <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> in all Truth and Sincerity, hath beeen used to perform th Part of a valiant Champion, delivering an infinite Number out of the Devil's Power, wherunto they were tied by the forcible Chains of Darkness. In which Sense, re∣taining St. <HI>George</HI> for <HI>England</HI>, not only as the Patron for the noble <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Gar∣ter</HI>, but as the Head and Patron of our eternal Glory, both those that be <HI>Knights</HI> of that noble <HI>Order</HI>, and all other, of what Degree or Calling soever, have just Cause ”to rejoyce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
See more of St. <HI>George</HI>, under this Consideration, in Sir <HI>T. Brown</HI>'s <HI>Vulgar Errors</HI>. As for the Author <HI>Malynes</HI>, he was a Commissioner of Trade, fourteen Years before his Publishing of this Tract, and was alive twenty-two Years after it; as may be seen, with a farther Account of him, and more of his Publications, in the <HI>British Librarian</HI>, p. 96.</Q>
<P N="14">14. <HI>Epicedium:</HI> A Funeral <HI>Oration</HI> upon the Death of the late deceased Princesse of fa∣mous Memorye, <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, by the Grace of God, Queen of <HI>England, France</HI>, and <HI>Ireland</HI>. Writen by <HI>Infelice Academico Ignoto:</HI> Where∣unto is added the <HI>True Order</HI> of her Highness Imperial <HI>Funeral</HI>. (In eleuen Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1603</P>
<Q>After the Oration, in three Leaves, fol∣lows a Poem, entituled <HI>A Subjects Sorrow</HI>, &amp;c. In both which there are some elegant Thoughts and Expressions. And then comes the Time, Order, and formal Proceeding at the Funeral, from <HI>Whitehall</HI> to <HI>Westminster</HI>, the Twenty-eighth Day of <HI>April</HI>, 1603; introduced and interspersed with some Verses.</Q>
<P N="15">15. <HI>England</HI>'s Mourning Garment, worne here by plain Shepheardes, in Memorie of their sacred Mistress <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, Queen of <HI>Vertue</HI>, while she lived, and Theame of <HI>Sorrow</HI>, being dead. To which is added, The true Manner of her Emperiall Funerall. With the Shepheard's Spring-Song, for Entertainment of King <HI>James</HI>, &amp;c. (In twenty-five Leaves) <HI>Quarto, no Date</HI>.</P>
<Q>This Piece is a Kind of Pastoral Dialogue, between some Shepherds, in Verse and Prose, containing a Character of that renowned Queen, which has several Particulars in it, worthy of being preserved; and, about the Middle, two Pages and an half of Poetry, in Reprehension of those able Poets, who did, or could praise her, when alive, for being
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
silent at her Death; among whom, though none are named, a Reader, well versed in their Works, may discern, he points at <HI>Da∣niel, Warner, Chapman, Marston, Shakespeare, Drayton</HI>, and three or four more. As to the <HI>Or∣der of the Funeral</HI>, there are in this some Va∣riations from that in the former Pamphlet; and some curious Herald may, perhaps, one Time or other, take the Pains to rectify that which is erroneous. At the End of this Part is an Advertisement, signed <HI>Hen Chetle</HI>, who appears to have been the Author of the Whole.</Q>
<P N="16">16. An <HI>Oration</HI> Congratulatory to the high and mighty <HI>James</HI> of <HI>England, Scotland, France</HI>, and <HI>Ireland</HI>, King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on the 12th Day of <HI>Febr.</HI> last presented; when his Majesty entered the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI>, to perform the Residue of the Solemnities of his <HI>Coronation</HI>, through the Citie of <HI>London</HI>, deferred by rea∣son of the <HI>Plague</HI>; and published by his High∣nesse speciall Allowance: Wherein, both the <HI>Description</HI> of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI>, and the <HI>Union</HI> of the Kingdoms, are compendiously touched. By <HI>William Hubbocke</HI>. At <HI>Oxford:</HI> Printed by <HI>Joseph Barnes</HI>, &amp;c. (in two Sheets) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1604</P>
<Q>This Oration is here printed both in <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English</HI>.</Q>
<P N="17">17. A <HI>Relation</HI> of such Things as were ob∣served to happen in the <HI>Journey</HI> of the Right Honourable <HI>Charles</HI>, Earl of <HI>Nottingham</HI>, Lord High Admiral of <HI>England</HI>, his Highnesse Am∣bassador to the King of <HI>Spain</HI>. Being sent thither, to take the Oath of the said King, for the Maintenance of <HI>Peace</HI>, betweene the two famous Kings of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI>; ac∣cording to the several Articles formerly con∣cluded on by the Constable of <HI>Castilla</HI> in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>, in the Month of <HI>August</HI>, 1604, set forth by Authoritie. Printed by <HI>Melchisedeck Brad∣wood</HI>, &amp;c. (in forty-two Pages) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1605</P>
<Q>It appears in the <HI>Preface</HI>, that the Author's Motives for publishing this <HI>Relation</HI> were, <HI>First</HI>, The Knowledge his Friends had of his being specially appointed an Attendant upon his Lordship in this Expedition; and his hav∣ing made some Observation of the Particulars in the same. <HI>Secondly</HI>, Because some false Re∣ports had been made of their Entertainment in <HI>Spain</HI>, and of their Proceedings there. But, <HI>Lastly</HI>, and more especially, because, since their Return, a Pamphlet had been published, with many erroneous Observations thereon. And, at the End of the Preface, the Author appears to be <HI>Robert Treswell</HI>, alias, <HI>Somerset</HI> Herald. It is a scarce Piece, and has not, perhaps, been sufficiently made Use of, to set forth the History of this Part of King <HI>James</HI> his Reign, in its due Colours. That Lord Admiral <HI>Howard</HI> had certainly, under his late glorious Queen, beaten the <HI>Spaniards</HI> notably in <HI>War</HI>; but whether <HI>They</HI> were not victorious over <HI>Him</HI>, at least over his <HI>Country</HI>, in the Conclusion of this <HI>Peace</HI>, the Registers of following Times will de∣clare.</Q>
<P N="18">18. Trayterous <HI>Percye</HI>'s and <HI>Catcsbye</HI>'s <HI>Pro∣sopopeia</HI>. Written by <HI>Edward Hawes</HI>, Schol∣ler at <HI>Westminster</HI>, a Youth of sixteen Years old, (in twelve Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1606</P>
<Q>This is a Poem in Stanza's of six Lines; addressed to <HI>Toby Matthews</HI>, Bishop of <HI>Dur∣ham</HI>, in a <HI>Latin</HI> Dedication; and has a wooden Print in the Frontispiece, of one of those Malefactors lying on a Hurdle, and the Executioner standing by him.</Q>
<P N="19">19. God's Warning to his People of <HI>Eng∣land:</HI> By the great <HI>Overflowing</HI> of the <HI>Waters</HI>, or <HI>Floudes</HI>, lately hapned in <HI>Scuth Wales</HI>, and many other Places. Wherein is described the great Losses and wonderfull Damages that happened thereby: By the Drowning of many Towns and Villages, to the utter Undoing of many Thousands of People. (In eight Leaves, <HI>black Letter) Quarto</HI>, 1607</P>
<Q>This was a most extraordinary, extensive, and destructive Deluge or Inundation of the Sea, as well in <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> and <HI>Somerset∣shire</HI>, as sundry Parts of <HI>South Wales</HI>; which began on the Twentieth of <HI>January</HI> before. It is described in a very lively and affecting Manner, in many of the disastrous Parti∣culars. Dr. <HI>Fuller</HI>, in his <HI>Worthies of</HI> Eng∣land, at the End of his Account of <HI>Somerset∣shire</HI>, has made Use of one Circumstance, shewing how Fear will banish Fierceness, in the Example of the <HI>wild</HI> Animals, which were now driven together with the <HI>tame</HI> Ones; and, though Enemies by Nature, ne∣ver offered to satisfy Nature upon them; so∣much greater Regard they had to avoid the present Danger, and seek for Self-preserva∣tion.</Q>
<P N="20"><PB N="5" REF="5"/>20. A lamentable Discourse upon the Par∣ricide and bloody Assassination, committed on the Person of <HI>Henry the Fourth</HI> (of famous Me∣morie) King of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Navarre</HI>.

(In seven Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1610</P>
<Q>It is subscribed at the End, <HI>Pelletier</HI>. This horrid Story is too well known to need any Remarks here; besides there were other Pamphlets then published upon the same Sub∣ject, which may stand more in Need of them.</Q>
<P N="21">21. The <HI>Lieutenant</HI> of the <HI>Tower</HI> his <HI>Speech</HI> and Repentance at the Time of his Death; who was executed upon <HI>Tower-hill</HI>, on the Twentieth Day of <HI>November</HI>, 1615. Print∣ed by <HI>G. Eld.</HI> (In four Sheets and an Half) <HI>Quarto, No Date</HI>.</P>
<Q>From the Time above-mentioned, when this <HI>Lieutenant</HI> of the <HI>Tower</HI>, Sir <HI>Gervis Ell∣wes</HI>, suffered, for knowing, consenting to, and concealing the Poysoning of Sir <HI>Thomas Overbury</HI>, in the <HI>Tower</HI> (which, if he had re∣vealed, would have saved many Lives) it may be concluded, the said Speech was pub∣lished soon after, and in the same Year.</Q>
<P N="22">22. Essayes of certaine <HI>Paradoxes:</HI> At <HI>Lon∣don</HI>, printed for <HI>Th. Thorp.</HI> (In twenty-eight Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1616</P>
<Q>These <HI>Paradoxes</HI> are written upon The <HI>Prayse</HI> of King <HI>Richard the Third</HI>; which takes up about half the Tract. The <HI>Prayse of the</HI> French <HI>Pockes</HI>. The <HI>Praise of Nothing</HI>; in Verse; from <HI>Johannes Passeratius</HI>, in <HI>Theodore Beza</HI>'s Epigrams; and, Lastly, <HI>That it is good to be in Debt</HI>.

A wonderful Story, and the like never heard of in our Modern Times; and yet all to manifest the Glory and Providence of God in the Preservation of <HI>Christendome</HI>, in these troublesome Times. Printed this Fifteenth of <HI>July</HI>, by <HI>J. D.</HI> &amp;c. (In eleven Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1622</P>
<Q>This is the famous Story of the young Emperor <HI>Osmin</HI>, clearly and compendiously related; which has furnished such Matter for Tragic Writers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Account has, on the Back of the Title-page, a Quo∣tation of eight Verses, out of <HI>Boetius</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI>, then Ambassador in <HI>Turky</HI>, wrote a Narrative upon the same Subject, but it was printed with a different Title; as, when it comes to Hand, will appear in some succeeding Number.</Q>

(In fourteen Leaves) <HI>Folio</HI>, 1625</P>
<Q>This forward Adventurer upon the Cha∣racters and Writings of our noble and learn∣ed Men, <HI>Abraham Darcie</HI>, was a <HI>Frenchman</HI>; and has most glaringly bedecked this Work with Dedications, and Marginal Notes, and Poetry, and Prose, and <HI>French</HI>, and <HI>English</HI>, &amp;c.

<Q>This Letter is addressed to the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI>; intreating, in a pathetic Man∣ner, that they would preserve that famous Library intire, and not suffer it to be dis∣persed, having been gathered with so much Industry and Expence, besides the Bounty of so many Princely Benefactors, and the con∣siderable Additions made to it, for ten Years together, by the learned Author himself, of the said Letter. And yet all to no Effect; as appears in the Title of it. It was com∣posed, it seems, of more than <HI>Forty-thou∣sand Volumes</HI>, the <HI>Manuscripts</HI> included; and contained in <HI>seven Chambers</HI>, whereof one was a <HI>Gallery</HI>, twelve Fathom high. And yet seems <HI>that Library</HI> not to have been more extraordinary for Number, Variety, Scarcity, Magnificence, and Expence, than <HI>this Libra∣ry</HI>, a Part whereof we are here now describ∣ing. It is well known to have filled <HI>thirteen</HI> handsome <HI>Chambers</HI>, besides two <HI>large Gal∣leries</HI>, both long and high; and had so many <HI>printed</HI> Books alone in it (the <HI>Manuscripts</HI> excluded, which would fill such another Gal∣lery) that even setting Forty-thousand aside, the Remainder alone would make a Library sufficient for any <HI>Cardinal</HI> in <HI>Europe</HI>.

Had the <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>England</HI> been addressed to preserve the <HI>Harleian</HI> Li∣brary, What Emulation would This have shewn?

<Q>This Discourse was spoken three Days af∣ter Q. <HI>Mary</HI> was proclaimed, in 1553, and printed the same Year.

He seems to have been deprived of that Vicaridge (in <HI>Bed∣fordshire</HI>) in the preceding Reign; and was now returned to his Church, upon the Return of <HI>Popery</HI>.

<Q>At the End of this <HI>Letter</HI>, is published the <HI>Scottish</HI> Act of Parliament, for the Re∣straint of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>, while she was in <HI>Scotland</HI>; from the Copy of that Act, printed at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> by <HI>R.

<Q>This is an authentick Piece, gravely and discreetly written, probably by one of the Ministers of State; declaring, against some late Libellers, how mildly the <HI>Rack</HI> was used upon <HI>Campion</HI>; and how falsely it was pretended, that <HI>Alexander Briant</HI> was com∣pelled to eat Clay out of the Walls, and drink the Droppings of Water from the Houses; when the great Hardship was, that, being required only to give a Specimen of his <HI>Writing</HI>, upon what Subject he would, (to compare his Hand) he disloyally refused it; and rather chose wilfully to <HI>fast</HI>, than <HI>ask</HI>, by <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Ink</HI>, as he was thereupon conditioned to do, for any <HI>Meat</HI> and <HI>Drink</HI> he might have had: But, not stomaching his own Obstinacy two Days, he was plentiful∣ly supplied with all Necessaries, as soon as he could prevail upon himself to <HI>write</HI> for them. It is here further attested, the <HI>Rack</HI> was never used, in this Reign, to extort Answers relating to the Doctrine or Faith of supposed Catholicks; but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly for their At∣tempts on her Majesty's Person, or State; by Treason or Force.

<Q>This is a strong and vehement Declaration; protesting his Lordship's Resolution, if pos∣sible, to treat all the late King's <HI>Enemies</HI>, as Vagabonds, Rogues, and Regicides; and to extirpate their Wives, Children, and Fa∣milies; and invites all his Majesty's <HI>Friends</HI> to meet him at <HI>Enderness</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI>, for that Purpose.

<Q>It seems, <HI>Fussel</HI> was a litigious Man; and the <HI>Major</HI> a subtile, high-spirited, re∣vengeful, and covetous Man.

<Q>There is a Date to this <HI>Letter</HI>, at the End, but a very erroneous one, 1610; for it may be gathered, from the Argument it∣self, that it should be 1681.

The Sum of the Whole is, to desire a fair Hearing: Whether the Duke of <HI>York</HI> on that Account, should not submit to an Exclusion, and <HI>Monmouth</HI> had not the true Right of <HI>Succession?</HI> And that the Duke of <HI>York</HI>, should be brought to a legal <HI>Tryal</HI>, for his manifold <HI>Treasons</HI> and <HI>Conspiracies</HI> (here enumerated) against the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI>.</Q>

<Q>Had this <HI>Pamphlet</HI> been seen by some of the Writers on the <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> of our <HI>Poets</HI>, it might have prevented several Mis∣takes. Some have insinuated as if,
<Q>“Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>, envying so growing a Rival in Poetry, put Mr. <HI>Creech</HI> upon translating <HI>Horace</HI>, to lessen him by so impracticable ”an Attempt.</Q>
See Dr. <HI>Coward</HI>'s <HI>Licentia Poetica</HI>, &amp;c. 8<HI>vo.</HI> 1708. <HI>p.</HI> 16. Which ap∣pears to be an unjust Suggestion; from the good Understanding there always was be∣tween them; the amicable <HI>Dedication</HI> Mr. <HI>Creech</HI> himself made of that very <HI>Transla∣tion</HI> to Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI>; and the laudable Cha∣racters Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> himself has published of him; testifying how <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> a Man he thought him to be. Yet others have carried that Notion so far, as to inti∣mate, that innocent <HI>Horace</HI>, truly, was guil∣ty of Mr. <HI>Creech</HI>'s Death: For, losing that Reputation, by translating <HI>him</HI>, which he had gained, by his Translation of <HI>Lucre∣tius</HI>, he hanged himself: Whereas there was sixteen Years between his Translation of <HI>Horace</HI>, and his <HI>Death</HI>; in which Inter∣val, he sufficiently retrieved his Reputation, by many other learned and well-received Publications. Mr. <HI>Giles Jacob</HI> has of∣fered another erroneous <HI>Cause</HI> of his Death; as if, his <HI>Heats</HI> and <HI>Disputes proved in the End fatal to him:</HI> Yet adds, the <HI>Cause</HI> of his Death was <HI>unknown</HI>. He also is mistaken in the <HI>Time</HI>; and sets it down, a Year later than it was. Monsieur <HI>Bernard</HI>, a Foreign∣er, who knew more of the Matter, in his <HI>Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres</HI>, for <HI>Sept.</HI> 1701. says, Mr. <HI>Creech</HI> brought him∣self to this unfortunate Period, about the End of <HI>June</HI>, 1700. But it appears in the <HI>Post-Boy</HI> for <HI>June</HI> the 18th of this Year, that it must have been in the Middle of this Month at latest, that Mr. <HI>Creech</HI> committed that rash and presumptuous Violence upon him∣self: And in this Pamphlet, as well as in the <HI>Pastoral</HI>, published upon the same Occasion, it does appear that, being of an <HI>amorous Consti∣tution</HI>, he fell in Love with a beautiful but dis∣dainful <HI>Coquet</HI>; which drove him into a Kind of <HI>amorous Frenzy</HI>, and <HI>Fury</HI> at last, to pay her this undeserved Compliment. For he was observed to be <HI>melancholy</HI> some Days before he did it: Accordingly the <HI>Jury</HI> brought him in, <HI>Distracted</HI>. He was found hanging at a Beam, in a Garret of the <HI>Apothecary</HI>'s House where he lodged at <HI>Oxford</HI>, by the <HI>Servant-Maid</HI>; after he had been five Days missing: And, as it has been further affirmed, with a Bible, or other pious Book, before him; also, his Hands fixed in a praying Posture: And he was then, as near as may be computed, in the forty-first Year of his Age.</Q>

To which he adds the Consequences, which he thinks have been thereby foreshown. There were indeed above twice as many more Authors who al∣so wrote of this Comet; and it is besides mentioned in most of the Histories of these Times.

This Merchant, and the Priests he employed, deluded that raw young Fel∣low <HI>Jauregui</HI>, a Copying Clerk in his Compting House, to undertake the Deed; and they persuaded him into an Enthusiasti∣cal Believe, that he might effect the same, in the Face of Day, unmolestedly. He was so ignorant, that he knew not how to dis∣charge a Pistol; but, having learnt the Art, he went into the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Drawing Room, in the <HI>Castle</HI> at <HI>Antwerp</HI>; and, as with some Noblemen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Prince was look∣ing on a Piece of Tapestry, he shot his Highness under the right Ear, through the left Cheek, on <HI>Sunday</HI> the 18th of <HI>March</HI> 1582.

<Q>This Archbishop having obtained a Par∣don of the <HI>Pope</HI>, for his Offences against <HI>Holy Church</HI>; left <HI>England</HI>, went to <HI>Rome</HI> and also pretended to return to the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion: But at length, his <HI>Conversion</HI> ap∣pearing insincere, he was put into the <HI>In∣quisition</HI>, and charged, in a <HI>Process</HI>, with many <HI>Heretical</HI> Tenets; which ended in a <HI>Sentence</HI>, depriving him of Honour, Digni∣ty, and Goods; and giving him up to the <HI>Secular</HI> Powers; by whom, after his Death, his <HI>Corps, Picture</HI>, and the <HI>Books</HI> he had printed, were burnt in <HI>Campo di Fiori</HI>.

<Q>This Man passed for a mighty <HI>Conjurer</HI> or <HI>Magician</HI> in those Days, with the Popu∣lace; but with Men of Understanding, for an ignorant and impudent <HI>Impostor</HI>. He practised <HI>Jugling, Fortune-telling, Recovering lost Goods</HI>, and shewing young People and some of Quality the <HI>Faces</HI> of those who were to be their <HI>Husbands</HI> and <HI>Wives</HI> in his <HI>Chris∣tal-Glass</HI>. But as for his Indictment at <HI>Worcester</HI>, 5. <HI>Jac.</HI> 1. for his Diabolical <HI>Witchcrafts, Enchantments</HI> upon <HI>Th.</HI> Lord <HI>W.</HI> (q. <HI>Windsor.</HI>) And that other, at the Assizes in the same County, next Year, for his Invocation and Entertainment of <HI>Evil Spirits</HI>; it appears very proper, that <HI>Judg∣ment</HI> was suspended. For the Rape he was convicted of the 21 of <HI>Jac.</HI> upon the Body of <HI>Joan Seager</HI>, in <HI>Southwark</HI>, a Girl of 11 Years old, he had Interest to get the King's Pardon. But as for the inhuman Pelting and Beating of him to Death, with Stones and Staves, by the licentious Mob, all the Way from the <HI>Fortune Play House</HI> to the <HI>Old Jury</HI>, on the 13 of <HI>June</HI> 1628; where∣by one of his Eyes was beaten out, and his Skull so fractured, that he died in the <HI>Poultry-Compter</HI> next Morning; there was no Law for That; and yet there was No∣body punished for it. It seems the Rabble were possessed that the Doctor dealt with the Devil, and that he employed his Skill to serve the dark Deeds of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and his Mother; against which Duke for his Misleading the King, and o∣ther Mismanagement of Affairs, the <HI>Parli∣ament</HI> were at that Instant making <HI>Remon∣strance</HI>.

<Q>The Author dedicates this Tract to the King. It is printed in double Columns, and it is rare to see one printed, intirely, upon so small a Letter.

In Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood</HI>'s <HI>Memoirs, Tom.</HI> 3. fol. 422, there is one Mr. <HI>John Chamberlain</HI>, who writes to Sir <HI>Ralph</HI>, very disparagingly of Sir <HI>T. Bodley</HI>; takes Notice of his Sickness, and other Infirmities of aged and dying Men; which would appear very uncharita∣ble, but that he seems not to have expected his Letters would have been made publick. In Page 429, he says, That Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> was so carried away with the Vanity and Vain-glory of his <HI>Library</HI>, that he forgot all other Respects and Duties, almost of Conscience, Friendship, or Good-nature. But, a little lower, plainly shews all this Indignation to proceed from being disappointed, an old Ac∣quaintance as he was, of having any Thing left him by Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> in his <HI>Will</HI>. Hence may we account for the hard <HI>Character</HI> he gives, in the next Leaf, of <HI>this Life</HI>; where he says,
<Q>“One Argument of his Vanity I will venture to communicate to you, tho' it were in a Manner committed to me, <HI>sub sigillo Confessionis</HI>; and so pray let it remain, till you hear more. He hath <HI>written</HI> his <HI>own Life</HI> in <HI>seven Sheets</HI> of <HI>Pa∣per</HI>; not leaving out the least <HI>Minutezze</HI>, nor omitting any Thing that may tend to his own Glory or Commendation.

This was looked upon as one of the most considerable <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Witch∣craft</HI> in those Days; and the Author has, from it, with a great Deal of Gravity, en∣deavoured to establish the gross Absurdities of that pernicious Opinion. In his Compre∣hension of many other Professions under this of <HI>Witchcraft</HI>, he is very ridiculous; nor is he less so, in the <HI>Authorities</HI> he has chosen to confirm us therein; the chief whereof is King <HI>James's Daemonologi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>!</HI> the <HI>Weakness</HI> of whose <HI>Arguments</HI>, in which Pamphlet, sur∣passes that in this, or any of the others; but the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine</HI>, in having been instrumental to the <HI>Murder</HI> of so many <HI>poor, ignorant, old Women</HI>, is not to be suffi∣ciently conceived, or condemned.

The Author may have been better informed in this Treatise than he was in the former. There are seve∣ral observable Circumstances in it, which he had the Advantage of knowing by having been in some of the <HI>Popish Seminaries</HI> Abroad, where he heard the famous Father <HI>Parsons</HI> make a <HI>Speech</HI>, which is here recorded, and perhaps no where else.

<Q>This was the most violent <HI>Storm</HI> in the Memory of Man, or that ever was, per∣haps, in <HI>England</HI>. It began on <HI>Friday</HI> Night, about Eleven o' Clock (not on <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, as this Pamphlet says) <HI>November</HI> 26, 1703, and continued till Seven o' Clock next Morning. This Tract is as full of Particulars as its Compass will admit; but it is probable, the greatest Part of the Da∣mages were never registered. This Author thinks the <HI>Fire of London</HI> was not so consi∣derable a Misfortune. Indeed that was li∣mited to a narrow Space, in Comparison of this; which extended over the <HI>Sea</HI>, as well as all the <HI>Land</HI>. Among the Accidents; it was an odd one that befell Mr. <HI>Hempson</HI>; who was blown out of an upper Room in the <HI>Bell-savage</HI> Inn upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI> a∣sleep; and knew nothing of the <HI>Storm</HI>, till he found himself lying on his <HI>Bed</HI> in the o∣pen <HI>Street</HI>. Among the eminent Persons killed, were the learned Bishop <HI>Kedder</HI> and his Lady, in Bed at <HI>Wells:</HI> Admiral <HI>Beau∣mont</HI> with almost all his Men drowned: And the ingenious Mr. <HI>Henry Winstanly</HI>, not less lamented than the best; in his own useful <HI>Lighthouse</HI>, on the <HI>Eddestone</HI>, near <HI>Plymouth</HI>, blown down, and swallowed up in the Sea. He was then upon a Project of employing <HI>Two-hundred Thousand Men in the Fishery</HI>; and was so famous for his benefi∣cial Inventions, not to mention his <HI>Water-works</HI>, &amp;c. that when taken Prisoner by the <HI>French</HI>, and carried into their Country; the King of <HI>France</HI> offered him 2000 <HI>Loui∣d'ores per Annum</HI> to serve him; which he generously refused.</Q>

<Q>It is no Wonder if it appears not, where, when, or by whom, this shrewd <HI>Dialogue</HI> against the <HI>Pride, Ambition</HI>, and <HI>Monopolies</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> was set forth. It is written in <HI>Verse</HI>; and very expressively declares how pros∣perous the People were, when they knew no <HI>Spiritual Jurisdiction</HI>; and to what Bondage and Impoverishment they were reduced, when they became <HI>Priest-ridden</HI>; and the <HI>Laity</HI>, overcome, by their deluding and su∣perstitious Infusions, suffered them to usurp <HI>Civil</HI>, as well as <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Government; to thrust their <HI>Sickle</HI> into every Man's <HI>Corn</HI>; and to <HI>clerk</HI> them out of their Goods and Lands, as well as their Reason and Under∣standing. Many of the Author's <HI>Arguments</HI> are confirmed by some choice and rare <HI>Ex∣amples</HI>, or <HI>Historical</HI> Instances. And it ap∣pears, at the End, by those Incidents of the Clergy's <HI>Burning the Translation of the New Testament</HI>, lest it should discover their <HI>Impos∣tures</HI>; and their late <HI>Destroying of some Chro∣nicles</HI>, under Pretence of their reflecting on the King's Ancestors, but indeed for exposing the exorbitant <HI>Revenues</HI> which those Holy Hypo∣crites had engrossed, to support their own lux∣urious Laziness and abominable Excesses; that it was written about the Middle of King <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI>'s Reign: And as much al∣so may be computed from other Parts of the Tract. Towards the Middle, there is in∣serted a <HI>Fragment</HI> of an old <HI>MS. Treatise</HI>, in <HI>Prose</HI>; written, as the Author says, <HI>above an Hundred Years since</HI>; and, <HI>about the Time of King Richard the Second</HI>. This he re∣commends to our

<L>For though <HI>old Wrytynges</HI> apere to be <HI>rude</HI>;</L>
<L>Yet notwithstandynge, they do include</L>
<L>The <HI>Pythe</HI> of a Matter most fructuously.</L></Q>
And so in Truth does this old Writing: Laying the <HI>Axe</HI> to the <HI>Root</HI> of those Eccle∣siastical <HI>Enormities</HI> and <HI>Usurpations</HI>, as vigo∣rously, then, so long before, as most other Treatises did at, or since the <HI>Reformation</HI>. Shewing more especially, besides their <HI>Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, Offerings</HI>, and infinite other Mercenary Practices of fleecing the foolish Flock, how unreasonably they were suffered to gripe in large <HI>Mannors</HI>, or <HI>Estates</HI> by <HI>Wholesale</HI>; and, through their specious Promises of <HI>Heaven</HI>, persuaded the Laity to <HI>amortize</HI> or <HI>alienate</HI> their Possessions on <HI>Earth</HI>, to the <HI>Church</HI>; and thereby to the Ruin of their Posterity. Urging further, that if <HI>Bishops</HI>, or <HI>Spiritual Pastors</HI>, may not alienate their <HI>Temporalities</HI>, nor restore to their very <HI>Founders</HI> any Thing given them; and must labour even to Death, till they recover what any of their <HI>Predecessors</HI> might have carelessly or lavish∣ly parted with thereof:

<PB N="44" REF="44"/>
the other <HI>Seminaries</HI> in <HI>England</HI>, conceived their Credit to be weakened, and themselves to be the more rigorously treated, for the traiterous Practices of the <HI>Jesuits</HI>; especially the treasonable <HI>Counsels</HI> of Father <HI>Parsons</HI>, in <HI>France, Spain</HI>, and <HI>Italy</HI>; and his libel∣lous <HI>Publications</HI> against his own Country. This great Contention between those two <HI>Popish</HI> Factions produced many Literary Rencounters; among which, none did more notably disclose the Tyranny and Treache∣ry of the <HI>English Jesuits</HI> than this now pub∣lished, the Author being in Prison; and another Treatise by the same Hand, the Year following, intitled his <HI>Quodlibets concerning Religion</HI> and <HI>State</HI>. The <HI>Jesuits</HI>, in Reward for these Works (the Life and Actions of Father <HI>Parsons</HI> especially, being no where set forth in livelier Colours than in the Tract above) <HI>cunningly</HI> and <HI>covertly</HI>, as he con∣fessed himself, <HI>drew</HI> poor <HI>Watson</HI> into a <HI>Plot</HI> for Dethroning the new King <HI>James</HI>, the Year after that; as may be seen in <HI>J.

<Q>There is <HI>John Lane</HI> written upon this Pamphlet, against the initial Letters of the Author's Name; who seems to be that fine old Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Gentleman, reported by <HI>Edward Phillips</HI>, in his <HI>Theatrum Poe∣tarum</HI>, to have been living within his Re∣membrance. He is for ranking him in the Class of Poets next to <HI>Spenser</HI>; and thinks he would have acquired a Name not infe∣rior to that Degree, had not his Poems re∣mained unpublished: But says they were still to be produced in <HI>MSS</HI>.

<Q>This dutiful Protestation to the King, made by those <HI>Nonconformists</HI>, seems to have been seen by few, if any of our <HI>Ecclesiastical Historians</HI> of those Times. They conclude it by attesting, that they envy not the <HI>Prelacy</HI> their State and Digni∣ty; and can live as Brethren, among those Ministers who shall acknowledge spiritual Homage unto their spiritual Lordships; pay∣ing unto them, all temporal Duties, of <HI>Tenths</HI>, &amp;c. Yea and joining with them in the Service and Worship of God, so far as they may do it without communicating with them in those human <HI>Traditions</HI> and <HI>Rites</HI>, which in their Consciences they judge unlawful. But craving, as they are most malicious <HI>Enemies</HI> to <HI>them</HI>; and thirst, either after their <HI>Blood</HI>, or the Shipwreck of their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Consciences</HI>, that they may not be <HI>their Judges in these Causes</HI>; but both stand as Parties at the Bar of the <HI>Civil</HI> Magistrate: And that, when they shall publickly slander <HI>Them</HI>, or their <HI>Cause</HI>, it may be lawful, in a publick Manner, to justify <HI>Themselves</HI>.

<Q>The Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>, in one of his <HI>Letters</HI>, takes Notice of the sharp <HI>Muscovite</HI> Wea∣ther, which occasioned the <HI>Great Frost</HI> in <HI>England</HI> at this Time. In the Front of this Tract is a wooden Print, representing the Citizens at their Sports, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon the frozen <HI>Thames</HI>. And in the Narrative, the <HI>De∣scription</HI> thereof, the <HI>Dangers</HI>, and <HI>Damages</HI> it had occasioned to several Persons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>London</HI>, as well as the Miseries endured in the Country thereby, are well set forth. It had now lasted about six Weeks, to the End of <HI>January</HI>, and was still freezing. Here is also an Account of the <HI>preceding Frosts</HI>, which had happened in <HI>England</HI> from the Time of King <HI>Rufus</HI>: And, after a brief Representa∣tion also of the <HI>Lotteries</HI> which had been drawn in the late Queen's Reign, he describes, more particularly, <HI>That</HI> which was carrying on by some <HI>Foreigners</HI> in <HI>London</HI> at this Time. And describes, in a very lively Manner, how greedily the poor Adventurers strove to make themselves Beggars in it. The Prizes in that <HI>Lottery</HI> were all of <HI>Plate</HI>; and the High∣est, worth a hundred and fifty or threescore Pounds; and though the Tickets were but one Shilling a-piece; yet, we are afraid it will shame <HI>those</HI> Times, or countenance such disad∣vantageous Kind of Gaming even in <HI>these</HI>, too much to let it appear, that to <HI>one Prize</HI> there were no less than <HI>forty Blanks</HI>.

<Q>That Author of this most learned and elaborate Tract upon the said Subject, that ever had been written, appears, in the 43d Page, to have been composing of it in 1606. The <HI>first</HI> Edition, we have met with, was in <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1610. And <HI>this</HI> Edition here has several Additions, and Improvements made to it. <HI>Langbain</HI> says,

<P N="195">195. Two <HI>Speeches</HI>, spoken by Sir <HI>Simonds D'ewes:</HI> The First touching the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of <HI>Cambridge</HI>; lately published by <HI>John Thomas</HI>, with many ignorant and foolish Mistakes, which are here rectified: The Other, concern∣ing the <HI>Privilege</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI>, in Causes Ci∣vil and Criminal. (In one Sheet) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1642</P>
<Q>The first of these <HI>Speeches</HI>, which only we can have Room here to take Notice of, was occasioned by a Bill, brought into the House, in which <HI>Cambridge</HI> was mentioned <HI>before Oxford</HI>; which raised some Debates in <HI>January</HI> 1640, about placing one Word before the other. Whereupon Sir <HI>Simonds D'ewes</HI> undertook to prove, in this Speech, that <HI>Cambridge</HI> was a renowned City, 500 Years before there was an House standing in <HI>Oxford</HI>; and that (without regarding <HI>Twine</HI>'s Allegations, for the Antiquity of <HI>Oxford</HI>; or those of <HI>Caius</HI>, for that of <HI>Cam∣bridge</HI>; most Part of which he accounts but <HI>Deliria Senum</HI>) from <HI>Gildas Albanius</HI>'s <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Story, who died about the Year 520. And from a <HI>Saxon</HI> anonymous Story in <HI>La∣tin</HI>, whose Author lived in the Reign of <HI>Penda</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI>, about the Year 620. And from <HI>Nennius</HI>'s <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>, wrote in the Year 880. Who all call <HI>Cambridge, Cair-grant</HI>: Which Word <HI>Cair</HI>, in the old <HI>Celtique</HI> Tongue, signifies a City. And <HI>Cair grant</HI> is not only expounded by <HI>Alfred</HI> of <HI>Beverly</HI> to signify <HI>Cambridge</HI>, but by <HI>William de Ramsey, Abbot</HI> of <HI>Croyland</HI>, in his Life of <HI>Guthlac</HI>; who says further, it was so called a <HI>Granta flumine</HI>. And though it suffered great Devastations by the <HI>Danish</HI> Incursions, it is, in <HI>Domesdei</HI> Book, descri∣bed as a Place of considerable Moment; ha∣ving in it <HI>Decem Custodias</HI>, and a <HI>Castle</HI> of great Strength and Extent. Thus much for the Antiquity of the Place; this Author next lays it down, that <HI>Cambridge</HI> was a <HI>Nur∣sery</HI> for <HI>Learning</HI>, before <HI>Oxford</HI> was known to have a <HI>Grammar School</HI> in it. But to prove it, begins no higher than King <HI>Alfred</HI>'s Time, for the Gathering of Persons to study Arts and Sciences there: He further observes it was so famous a Seminary of Instruction in <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI>'s Reign, that he sent his Son <HI>Henry</HI> thither, afterwards the first of that Name, King of <HI>England</HI>; who, for the uncommon Knowledge he acquired, was sirnamed <HI>Beauclerk</HI>. He adds that the most ancient and first endowed College of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>, was <HI>Valence College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI>; which after the Foundation, as appears by a <HI>Par∣liament</HI> Roll in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 38 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI. Num. 31; received the new Appellation of <HI>Pembroke-Hall</HI>. So concludes <HI>Cambridge</HI> to be the <HI>Elder Sister</HI>; and advi∣ses, to avoid further Division, that the present Bill pass unaltered, as it was penned; lea∣ving us to infer, It will be of more Moment for the <HI>Universities</HI> to exert their Emulation in <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI>, and exceed one ano∣ther in <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI>, than in the <HI>An∣tiquity</HI> or <HI>Seniority</HI> of their <HI>Foundation</HI>.</Q>

<Q>The Writer of this Pamphlet, Mr. <HI>James Harrington</HI>, the well-known Author of <HI>O∣ceana</HI>, &amp;c. and one of the Members of that ingenious <HI>Convention</HI>, has borne very hard up∣on <HI>Milton</HI>; sharply censuring not only the <HI>Subject</HI>, but the <HI>Manner</HI> of his Compositions; nay falls a-board of his Inaccuracy and Impro∣prieties in their very <HI>Titles</HI>. Where he tells him, that a Gentleman of his own Acquain∣tance in that Society, wished,
<Q>“You had given your Book no <HI>Name</HI>, like an <HI>Ana∣baptist</HI>'s Child, until it had come to Years of Discretion: Or else, that you had got some Friend to be Gossip, that has a luckier Hand at giving Titles to Books than you have: For it is observed you
<PB N="51" REF="51"/>
have always been very unfortunate that Way; as if it were fatal to you to prefix Bulls and Nonsense to the very Front of your learned Works. As when you call <HI>Salmasius, Claudius Anonymus</HI>, in the ve∣ry Title of that admired Piece, which you writ to confute his Wife and his Maid. As also in that other learned Labour of yours, which you stile <HI>Tetrachordon</HI>, that is to say, <HI>a Fiddle with four Strings</HI>; but as you render it, a <HI>Four-fold Cord</HI>; with which you undertake, worse than Captain <HI>Otter</HI>, and <HI>Cuthbert</HI> the Barber, not to <HI>bind</HI>, but most ridiculously, to <HI>untie</HI> Ma∣trimony. But in this Book, he said, you were more insufferable; for you do not only stile your Declamation, <HI>The ready and easy Way</HI>, as if it were the best, or only Way; to the Disparagement of this most ingenious <HI>Assembly</HI>; who are confident, they have proposed others much more considerable; but do very indiscreet∣ly prosess in the same Place, to compare the <HI>Excellencies</HI> of a <HI>Commonwealth</HI>, with the <HI>Inconveniences</HI> and <HI>Dangers</HI> of <HI>Kingship</HI>. This, he said, was foul Play, and worse Logick: For, as all Conveniencies in this World carry their Inconveniencies with them; to compare the <HI>Best</HI> of one Thing, with the <HI>Worst</HI> of another, is a very une∣qual Way of Comparison. To th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, ano¦ther added, He wondered you did not give over Writing; since you have always done it to little or no Purpose; for, though you have scribled your Eyes out, your Works have never been printed, but for the Company of Chandlers and Tobacco. Man, who are your Stationers, and the only Men that vend your Labours. He said, that he himself reprieved the whole <HI>Defence of the People of England</HI> for a Groat, that was sentenced to vile <HI>Mundungus</HI>, and had s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered inevitably, but for him; tho' it cost you much O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and Labour, and the <HI>Rump, Three-hundred Pounds a Year</HI>; to whose Service it was more properly in∣tended; although, in the Close, you pro∣nounce them to be as very Rascals, as <HI>Salmasius</HI>, and all the Christian World calls them, if ever they suffered any of their Fellow-Members to invade the Go∣vernment; at <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>, and others have since done; and confess yourself fooled and mistaken, and all you have written to be false; howsoever you give yourself the second Lye, in Writing for ”Them again.</Q>
&amp;c. Thus far, <HI>Page</HI> 4, 5. A little further he says:—
<Q>“You have done your feeble Endeavour to rob the Church of the little, which the Rapine of the most sacrilegious Persons hath lest, in your learned Work against <HI>Tithes</HI>. You have slandered the <HI>Dead</HI>, worse than <HI>Envy</HI> itself; and thrown your dirty Outrage on the Memory of a murthered Prince, as if the Hangman were but your Usher. These have been the Attempts of your <HI>stiff, for∣mal Eloquence</HI>; which you arm according∣ly, with any Thing that lies in the Way, ”right, or wrong.</Q>
&amp;c. So <HI>Page</HI> 8, 9. Again —
<Q>“A worthy Knight of this Assembly stood up, and said, that, if we meant to examine all the particular Falla∣cies and Flawes in your Writing, we should never have done; he would there∣fore, with Leave, deliver his Judgment, upon the Whole; which in Brief was thus: That it is all windy Foppery, from the Beginning to the End; written to the Elevation of the Rabble, and meant to cheat the Ignorant. That you sight al∣ways with the Flat of your Hand, like <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Rhetorician</HI>, and never contract the <HI>Lo∣gical</HI> Fist. That you trade altogether in <HI>Universals</HI>, the Region of Deceits and Fal∣lacy; but never come so near <HI>Particulars</HI>, as to let us know, which among divers Things of the same Kind you would be at. For you admire Commonwealths in general, and cry down Kingship as much at large, without any Regard to the par∣ticular Constitutions which only make either the one or the other good or bad; vainly supposing all <HI>Slavery</HI> to be in the Government of a <HI>single</HI> Person, and No∣thing but <HI>Liberty</HI> in that of <HI>Many</HI>; which is so false, that some <HI>Kingdoms</HI> have had the most perfect Form of <HI>Commonwealths</HI>, as ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s had; and some <HI>Republick</HI> have proved the greatest <HI>Tyrannie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>, as all have done at one Time or other: For many, if they combine, have m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Latitude to abuse Power than a single Person, and less Sense of Shame, C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>science, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Honour

to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estrain them; for what is wickedly done by many, is owned by none, where to Man knows, upon whom in particular ”to fix it.</Q>
So gives an Instance in <HI>Mil∣ton</HI>'s own Patriots, &amp;c. Page 13. Lastly, the Author gives his own Judgment of this Work; especially that Part where <HI>Milton</HI> would have no <HI>Change</HI> of <HI>Ministry</HI>, in these Words:
<Q>“That which I disliked most in your Treatise was; that there is not one Word of the <HI>Balance</HI> of <HI>Property</HI>, nor the <HI>Agrarian</HI>, nor <HI>Rotation</HI> in it, from the Beginning to the End; without which, together with a Lord <HI>Archon</HI>, I thought I had sufficiently demonstrated, not only in my Writings, but publick Exercises in the Coffee-house, that there is no possible Foundation of a <HI>Free-Commonwealth</HI>. To the first and second of these, that is, the <HI>Ballance</HI>, and <HI>Agrarian</HI>, you made no Objection; and therefore I should not need to make an Answer: But for the Third, I mean <HI>Rotation</HI>, which you im∣plicitly reject, in your Design to perpe∣tuate the present Members, I shall only add this, to what I have already said and written on that Subject: That a <HI>Common-wealth</HI> is like a great <HI>Top</HI>, that must be kept up by being whipped round, and held in perpetual <HI>Circulation</HI>; for, if you dis∣continue the <HI>Rotation</HI>, and suffer the Se∣nate to settle, and stand still, down it falls immediately. And, if you had studied this Point, as carefully as I have done, you could not but know, there is no such Way under Heaven of disposing the Vicissitudes of Command and Obedience, and of dis∣tributing <HI>equal</HI> Right and Liberty among all Men, as this of <HI>Wheeling</HI>; by which, as <HI>Chaucer</HI> writes, a single Fart hath been divided among a whole Covent of Friars, and every one hath had his just Share of ”the Savour.</Q>

<Q>By this <HI>English Heroe</HI>, is meant General <HI>Monk</HI>, Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI>, who died the foregoing Year. And had the <HI>Cloud</HI> been <HI>opened</HI>, as is here promised, by which some might think to be intended the Mystery of the <HI>Restoration</HI>; wherein that General ap∣peared the leading Figure, we might have had a very satisfactory Sight: But that Ex∣pression is more confined to the <HI>Person</HI> him∣self; who was of a close and <HI>cloudy</HI> Disposi∣tion, much inclined to <HI>Secrecy</HI>, and wrapped in <HI>Reservation</HI>. And, indeed, in the Man∣ner of Setting him forth, the <HI>Author</HI> is much correspondent to his <HI>Subject</HI>; is so much in∣volved in Allusions and Digressions, that the greatest Part of the Work is a dark, de∣tached Rhapsody of Reflections. Yet are there some curious <HI>Anecdotes</HI>, in <HI>Charac∣ters</HI> of <HI>Persons</HI>, and <HI>Remarks</HI> on the <HI>late Times</HI>, sprinkled up and down, especially concerning General <HI>Monk</HI>, no where else to be met with; and in which the Au∣thor does maintain his Title of <HI>a Loyal and Impartial Pen</HI>. As where he mentions that Tradition of the <HI>General</HI>'s Promise, <HI>Ne∣ver to bear Arms in England against his Prince</HI>.
<Q>“This, says our Author, not a few will have most exactly to be perform∣ed; and hence by no Action of his Loy∣alty to be impeached. What he acted in the first <HI>Dutch</HI> Engagement, and what was performed in the <HI>Caledoman</HI> War, must, by a milder Gloss, be interpreted a Zeal for his Country, and no Disaffection to his King; but the more rigid Censors will not allow him, who wounds in <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet</HI>, no Enemy, though not equally mortal with him who transpierces ”the <HI>Heart</HI>.</Q>
He says further: The <HI>Low Country</HI> Religion obliged him to a <HI>Party</HI>; by whom he was disobliged: That he honour∣ably deserted his Deserters; and intimates, that the <HI>Juncto</HI>, who made him a Cypher in Commission, contributed thereby to vote to their own Ruin; and when he broke down the <HI>City</HI> Gates, he said, he then thought himself even with them. His dreadless Re∣gard of <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>War</HI>, is imputed to a <HI>Predestinarian</HI> Principle. He violently pro∣secuted the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, in which he ex∣ceeded his Commission; brought the Nati∣on many Millions in Debt, and, had he been a <HI>Dutchman</HI>, might have lost him his Head: Whereas,
<Q>“by the Method he seem∣ed to <HI>restore</HI>, he might have <HI>secured</HI> his Country: Here, a <HI>Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us</HI>, he might have effected by <HI>Delays</HI>, what he could not by <HI>Fighting</HI>; and have seemed a double <HI>Re∣storer</HI> of his Nation, whose Rashness might ”have intitled him the <HI>Demolisher</HI>.</Q>

But, upon the Account of his <HI>Credulity</HI> in the Cures of of <HI>Greatrakes</HI> the <HI>Stroaker</HI>, and Patronage of him, the Ignorance of that illiterate Quack and Impostor, as he is now plainly called, and seems discovered to be, is more expatia∣ted upon, than any other Circumstance in the whole Tract. As our Author, before, had not contradicted the Assertion, That his Heroe's <HI>Head-piece</HI> was the worst Part of his <HI>Armour:</HI> So now, his strong Faith in this gracious Babe of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Refor∣mation, is represented as a great Weak∣ness; especially in that Instance, of his send∣ing this <HI>Stroaker</HI> to a superannuated Wo∣man of <HI>Ninety</HI>, who had lost her <HI>Hearing</HI> twelve Years, in Expectation, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Hand, to recover it. This Patronage of that Pre∣tender was so notorious, that <HI>Dr. Thomas Gumble</HI>, in his <HI>Life of General Monk</HI>, print∣ed the next Year, thought fit, not to pass it over in Silence, without endeavouring to make some <HI>Apology</HI> for it; as it the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> did not credit him upon the Score of his Abi∣lities, so much as from the Testimonies and Certificates of so many other People.

When Sir <HI>William</HI>, tell∣ing the Company, he had heard, That di∣vers Scholars of <HI>Eaton</HI> had run away that Morning from the School, for Fear of Beating, it produced their different Senti∣ments, Whether <HI>Mildness</HI> or <HI>Severity</HI> had the best Effect in the <HI>Scholastick</HI> Education of Youth? Mr. <HI>Ascham</HI> inclined, as Sir <HI>William</HI> had done, to the milder Course; and used such Arguments, that Sir <HI>Richard Sackville</HI>, Treasurer of the <HI>Exchequer</HI>, then present, afterwards prevailed upon him to draw his Thoughts out, upon the Teaching and Training of Youth, into a regular Trea∣tise, for the Use, among others, of his Grandson, Master <HI>Robert Sackville:</HI> And that was the Occasion of writing this Work.</Q>

<Q>This <HI>Poem</HI>, which was printed in the Year 1593, is written in Lines of ten Syllables, without Rhime; or what we call <HI>blank Verse</HI>. In his <HI>Prologue</HI>, after his Addresses to, and Praises of that Nobleman, for his Know∣ledge in Mathematicks and Philosophy; and his Lamentation of the Loss of those Pa∣trons of the Muses, <HI>Sidney</HI> and <HI>Walsing∣ham</HI>; the Author gives a Character of those Contemporary Poets, <HI>Spenser, Harrington, Daniel, Campion</HI>, and <HI>Fraunce</HI>; and asks why they do not follow those Patrons, and also these departed Poets, <HI>Phaer, Watson</HI>, and <HI>Marlow?</HI> Advising them to exchange this Spot, so barren of Repast, for the <HI>Elisian</HI> Fields; unless <HI>Augusta</HI> will restore Learning from the Wrongs it bears of Covetousness and Court Disdain.

Here∣upon,
<PB N="59" REF="59"/>
he remembers the <HI>Origin</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI>, according to the common Tradition of a <HI>Lady's Garter drop'd in a Dance</HI>, and taken up by that King; but conceived to be the <HI>Queen</HI>'s by our Author. Then he discerns all that glorious Company to be the <HI>First Founders</HI>, who came down thither to grace this <HI>Installation</HI>; among them the <HI>Black Prince</HI>, on a Coal-black Courser, his Corslet varnished as black as Jet, his Bases black, with a Battle-Ax in his Hand; and all, from Head to Foot, as black as Night. (And in such sable Armour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he is to be seen in some ancient Illuminations on Vellum, re∣presenting him in the Wars of <HI>France</HI>.) Yet makes our Poet this Distinction:
<Q><L>Though <HI>Black</HI> of Hue, that <HI>Surname</HI> yet in <HI>Fraunce</HI></L>
<L>He <HI>wan:</HI> For Terror to the <HI>Frenchmen</HI>'s Hearts</L>
<L>His <HI>Count'nance</HI> was; his <HI>Sword,</HI> an iron Scourge.</L></Q>
At last, our Author attaining a View, in this airy Procession, of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and his warlike Band of this Order; he es∣pied, written in the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Fame</HI>, the Name of <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> (some few Years before deceased) of whom, after some high Encomiums, he tells this Story: That, once walking out alone, this aged Earl was overtaken with Sleep, and laid himself down to Rest near a Farmer's Lodge. He was wrapped in a plain russet Cloak; but it covered not the Badge of Honour which was buckled round his Leg, so that it tempted a young thievish Vagrant, who passed by, to en∣deavour at Taking it off. The Earl was not so fast asleep, but he soon perceived the De∣sign, and offered him a better Prize; for his <HI>Garter</HI> would not fit every Leg, and he esteemed it better than his <HI>Purse</HI>. The Thief, affrighted, ran away; and the Earl would pleasantly tell his Friends, The Rogue would not have dared to steal the <HI>Garter</HI>, if he had understood the <HI>French</HI> about it. Next comes on Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, and her stately Train of gartered Knights, in great Pomp and Glory; and King <HI>Edward</HI> con∣gratulates those <HI>Five</HI> especially, who had this Day the Honour to be created by the said Queen; that is to say, the Earls of <HI>Northum∣berland</HI>, and <HI>Worcester</HI>; the Lords <HI>Boroughe</HI>, and <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lde</HI>; and Sir <HI>Francis Knolles</HI>. And, after that King has given Characters of their Virtues, and Exhortations to proceed in them, <HI>Renown</HI> founded a Retreat: The <HI>Train</HI>, as swift as shooting Stars, retired, <HI>Fame</HI>'s double Doors fell to, and the gay <HI>Morn</HI> wak'd from her golden Sleep. The Author, in his <HI>Epilogue</HI>, tells that Earl, to whom he addresses the <HI>Prologue</HI>, that he offers this Dream as the Firstling of his Scholar's Crop, consecrated to his Noble Name. O∣ther <HI>Poetical Pieces</HI> of his were printed the same Year; especially in the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Way; and some <HI>Pastoral</HI> Pieces of his were printed in <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Helicon</HI>. But the Tragedy of <HI>Alphonsus</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI>, was <HI>Chap∣man</HI>'s. Tis true, as <HI>A. Wood</HI> observes, that, most Poets dying obscurely, it is hard to trace them to their Graves; and he was misled in setting down this Poet, to be flou∣rishing after his Death, from the Dates of some of his Writings which were then print∣ed: For we are assured by one of his Con∣temporaries, that he fell a Victim in the <HI>Wars of Venus</HI>, in, or before the Year 1598. And might then be about Forty, or a Middle-aged Man.</Q>

<Q>The Author of this curious and useful Tract, dedicates it to Sir <HI>Edmond Anderson</HI>, Knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas; conceiving his Lordship might take some Delight in <HI>Observations</HI> of this Kind; as having lately permitted Mr. <HI>George Chur∣chey</HI> to dedicate to him, his Translation from the <HI>Latin</HI>, of <HI>Jacobus Dubravius</HI>, his <HI>New Book of Husbandry, treating of Fishponds</HI>, &amp;c. But more especially, for the publick Ac∣knowledgment that is due to his Lordship's Virtues; so deserving of the whole Realm, for his great Care and Labour in the Ad∣ministration of Justice. And doubts not, but he shall, in this little Treatise, find something that he knew not before. In his <HI>Preface</HI>, he observes, concerning <HI>Fish</HI>, that none have written thereof, in our Tongue, to any Purpose, whom he ever saw; and that the said Translation, compiled by a Stranger, and rendered into <HI>English</HI> by a
<PB N="60" REF="60"/>
Person of no great Experience, will not sa∣tisfy the Desires of those who would prac∣tise this Way to Improvement. That, for himself, he means not to express all that might be said in these Matters, but only what he has observed and practised; for, if he should set down, by Way of Preface, the great Benefits that might grow to this Realm, by practising to have Abundance of the two foresaid Commodities, the Preface would grow a greater Volume than the Book. Concerning <HI>Fruit</HI>, he says, though many Authors have more learnedly written, yet, many of them being Strangers, inhabiting Climates far differing from ours, they most∣ly teach how such Fruits, as their Countries bring forth, are to be used; of which Kinds we have little or no Use. That, if the Be∣nefit arising to the Commonwealth through Abundance of Fruit were well weighed, there would be Laws established for the In∣crease and Maintenance of it. That <HI>Glou∣cestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire</HI>, great Part of <HI>Kent</HI>, and <HI>Sussex</HI>, are so stored, as to yield the Poor Meat and Drink, great Part of the Year. That he has known, in those Counties, many Men, who had twelve or twenty Persons in Family, not use, most Years, two Quarters of Malt in Drink, but o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <HI>Cider</HI> and <HI>Perry</HI>; and sell yearly, be∣sides, great Quantities. So might we have it in most other Parts of <HI>England</HI>; yet reap, in Effect, as great Profit, by pasturing and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring the Ground, as we do. That the short Term of Years for which many hold their Lands, and the Hazard of being rob∣bed of their Fruit, are trifling Discourage∣ments to Plantations of such Benefit, and what might be easily redressed.</Q>

It is, perhaps, with some Impropriety en∣titled, Sir <HI>T.

There is a wooden <HI>Print</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> his Ghost; and he concludes his Tale with a Request, that our Author would transmit to Posterity his true <HI>Trage∣dy</HI>. Then, as they are looking towards <HI>Traytor's Bridge</HI>, they see under the Arch, the Ghost of <HI>Weston</HI> arise out of the <HI>Thames</HI>; and he tells the Story of his Guilt in a penitential Manner: And here we have his <HI>Picture</HI>, with a Halter about his Neck.

<Q>This Work is copiously stretched out, with Parade of Style, Circumstances and Surmises, and decked with Allusions and Applica∣tions, out of the ancient Heathen <HI>Poets</HI>; even so closely, and <HI>poetically</HI>, as to the Bringing them out of some of his Person's Mouths. Yet it is very deficient in some Particulars, which are ever required to satisfy a curious Reader: Those are, <HI>Chronology</HI>, and <HI>Autho∣rity</HI>; by the Omission whereof, he has depri∣ved his Work of one of the <HI>Eyes</HI>, and one of the <HI>Legs</HI> of <HI>History</HI>. He quotes but one Historian, and that but in one Place, through∣out his Narrative. He has but two Dates of the Year of our Lord; neither of those rela∣ting to <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI>, and one of them er∣roneous, no less than seventy Years. <HI>George Buck</HI>, who pretends, in his History of King <HI>Richard</HI> III, that this <HI>Perkin Warbeck</HI> was no <HI>Pretender</HI>, is out of Humour with our Author <HI>Gainsford</HI>, for representing him one, and not allowing him to be the true Duke of <HI>York</HI>. He says,
<Q>“His Learning may be as much mistaken in this, as other Things; though he laid a great Pretence to Know∣ledge, especially in the History of <HI>England</HI> and other Countries: That, his Judgment and Reading are much expressed alike in this Pamphlet, wherein he forfeits all his Skill to make him a Parallel in adverse Fortune, and supposed base Quality, to the unhappy Don <HI>Sebastian</HI>, late King of <HI>Por∣tugal</HI>, who he also protests an Impostor, ”&amp;c.</Q>
So the said <HI>Geo.

<Q>There is a wooden Print in the Title Page, both of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Cathedral</HI>, and St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Cross</HI>, with a Preacher in the Pulpit thereof, and his Auditory about him, in the open Air. That Author <HI>Henry Farley</HI>, la∣boured for the Good of this Cathedral both late and early; as it is here expressed, in the Epitaph designed for him. He dedicates his Pamphlet to the High Court of <HI>Parliament</HI>; and it is a strange Collection in <HI>Prose</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI>, of Flowers from Scripture, concern∣ing the Building of the <HI>Lord's House</HI>; Prayers, Petitions, Dialogues with, and Dreams and Visions about that <HI>Cathedral</HI>; which it seems was then kept in a sad dirty Condition; inso∣much that, upon the King's being to visit it, on the <HI>Sunday</HI> aforesaid, there was more Sweeping, Brushing, and Cleansing bestow∣ed upon it, than had been in forty Years before; and the Workmen looked like him they called <HI>Muld Sack</HI>, after Sweeping a Chimney. The Author often made his Way to the King, with his <HI>Petitions</HI> and his <HI>Carrols</HI>, before, and upon his Going to <HI>Scotland</HI>, and after his Return; always pray∣ing him to <HI>remember St. Paul</HI>'s. In the Year 1615, he presented St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Complaint</HI> to the Lord Mayor, Sir <HI>John Jolles</HI>, with a Petition to him, for his Favour; and a <HI>Let∣ter</HI> to the <HI>Preachers</HI>, to promote such Repair as was necessary; and he was the Means, through that Complaint, &amp;c. Of Gaining Benefactions to the said Cathedral, by the Time the King came to visit it, which was the Twenty-sixth of <HI>March</HI>, 1619, amounting to five, and as he adds, almost <HI>Eight-hundred Pounds</HI>. And yet, how the Court thought of him, he betrays; where he says, that when he presented one of his Petitions aforesaid to the King,
<Q>“the <HI>Ma∣ster of the Rolls</HI> took it away from his Highness, before he could read it; as ma∣ny Things had been so taken before; to the great Hinderance and Grief of the ”poor Author.</Q>
In short, after having been a Sollicitor for this Church, eight Years; his own Charges towards it, and his Credulity in the Honour of his <HI>Patrons</HI>, brought him, through <HI>Suretiship</HI>, into <HI>Ludgate</HI>; where, still, he had his <HI>Dreams</HI> and <HI>Visions</HI> of the Church; but he grew cooler towards the <HI>Church</HI>, when he got out of the <HI>Prison</HI>, and would have gone to <HI>Virginia</HI>; had he not been retained, by the joyful Tidings of the King's <HI>Visitation</HI> aforesaid; so he attended, with Hopes of Success in the said <HI>Reparations</HI>, &amp;c. Which did fall out to the Full of his Expectations for that Time. There was another <HI>Dreamer</HI> and <HI>Visionary</HI> of this <HI>Name</HI>, in <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI>'s Time, whose <HI>Bloody Visions</HI> may be taken some Notice of, when they shall turn up to Hand.</Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet does well set forth, in many Points, the Merits of this common, but useful Commodity. To say, to a Friend, <HI>You would lay your Hands under his Feet to serve him:</HI> Is it not a Profession of profound Humility? A most zealous and li∣beral Declaration of Love and Affection? If <HI>Leather</HI> was to do no more than <HI>This</HI>,
<PB N="64" REF="64"/>
and suffered itself only to be cut into Boots and Shoes for our Use, were this not suffici∣ent? An universal Benefit to one and all; down from the King to the Peasant, and up from the common Subject to the greatest Prince? But <HI>Leather</HI> serves us in many o∣ther Respects; and supports many other Handicrafts besides the Shoemaker. Here are <HI>Twenty Trades</HI>, mentioned in the first Article of this Discourse, above-mentioned, which are wholly maintained by <HI>Leather</HI>, or would want Work without it. And yet they had their <HI>Abuses</HI> of it; among which are reckoned impolitick <HI>Transportation</HI>, even to the Ma∣king it dear among ourselves; also the pro∣fuse <HI>Consumption</HI> of it by ourselves; espe∣cially, now it was grown such a Fashion for every private Gentleman to turn <HI>Phaeton</HI>, and hurry in his rumbling Vehicle about the Streets, as that ambitious Boy did in the Air; that it was thought, at least, <HI>Five∣thousand Coaches and Caroches</HI> were, then, maintained in and about <HI>London</HI>. And, as so much Spoil was made in that Compass, it is not attempted to make a Computation of what was consumed through the whole <HI>King∣dom</HI>; since <HI>Pride</HI> also wheeled about in these her Leather Thrones, through every Shire, City, Town and Village thereof. (And to this Increase they grew, as we learn else∣where, in the Space of twenty-four Years; before which Time, they were very scarce.) But a more wanton Wastefulness of <HI>Leather</HI> than this, at that Time, also prevailed, and is here mentioned as another <HI>Abuse</HI> of it; in that slovenly Fashion every Body, from the Courtier to the Clown, affected, of Co∣vering their Legs with it, and stalking about in Houses or Streets, with <HI>Boots</HI> on, which had huge, ungainly, and immoderate <HI>Tops</HI> to them. These Excesses, together with the <HI>French</HI> Superfluities of <HI>Galloshes</HI>, occasion such a Consumption of <HI>Leather</HI>, as raised it to an excessive Price, to the great Detriment of the Poor. Here are also laid forth the <HI>Abuses</HI> which were practised in the <HI>Leather-Markets:</HI> With the Benefits which would arise from the Correction of them; the Whole end∣ing with a S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmary of the <HI>Statutes</HI> that have been made for that Purpose, in Order to their further Improvement.</Q>

<Q>This Tract is dedicated by the Author, To his worthy, honest Friend, Mr. <HI>Bene∣dict Webbe</HI>, that true Patriot; who had taken great Pains to benefit the Publick, in those two important Necessaries of Life, our <HI>Rai∣ment</HI> and <HI>Food</HI>; by adding to our old <HI>Dra∣peries</HI>, the making of <HI>Perpetuanas, Spanish Cloaths</HI>, &amp;c. and by bringing <HI>Rape Oil</HI> to the Use of <HI>Cloathing:</HI> Also, by being the <HI>first Author</HI> of this <HI>new Invention</HI> for <HI>Fertiling</HI> and <HI>Inriching</HI> of <HI>Arable Grounds</HI>; from whose tried, and approved <HI>Experiments</HI>, these <HI>Directions</HI> are published.

Printed for <HI>Henry Gosson</HI>. (In sixteen Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1635</P>
<Q>There is a wooden Print of Old <HI>Parr</HI>, in a black Cap, and sitting in a Chair, fa∣cing this Title-page, The <HI>Life</HI> is written in <HI>Verse</HI>; and it is dedicated to King <HI>Charles</HI> in Verse, by the said <HI>John Taylor</HI>; who, be∣ing one of his Majesty's Watermen, is usu∣ally stiled the <HI>Water-Poet</HI>. He informs the King, that as he had had the <HI>Greatest</HI>, the <HI>Least</HI>, and the <HI>Oldest</HI> of his Subjects, at his Court, meaning <HI>William Evans</HI>, his Gi∣gantick Porter; little <HI>Jeffrey</HI>, the Queen's Dwarf; and this <HI>Thomas Parr</HI>; he chose the latter, for the Subject of his Muse; and begs his Majesty's Acceptance of this Description of his Life, as he had received and read others of his Poems. If we were to draw the chief Circumstances expressed in the said <HI>Poem</HI>, and the preliminary Discourse in <HI>Prose</HI>, into a regular Order, and join the <HI>Chronology</HI>, it might render the Story more compleat: And so it would appear, That, living with his Father <HI>John Parr</HI>, a Hus∣bandman at <HI>Winnington</HI> aforesaid, till he was seventeen Years old, he was, in 1500, sent to Service, under a Master of the same Cal∣ling, with whom he dwelt, till the Death of his Father, about 1518; then, returning Home, resided upon the Farm, or Lands, he left him in Possession of, till the Lease expired in 1522. He then renewed the Lease for Twenty-one Years, of Mr. <HI>Lewis Porter</HI>; and when this ended, in 1543, he renewed it, a second Time, for the same Term, of Mr. <HI>John Porter</HI>. In 1563, old <HI>Parr</HI>, being then <HI>Fourscore Years of Age</HI>, married <HI>Jane</HI>, Daughter of <HI>John Taylor</HI>, a Maid; by whom he had a Son, and a Daugh∣ter, named <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI>, who both died very young. The next Year, 1564, his second Lease ending, he renewed, for the like Term, of Mr. <HI>Hugh Porter</HI>. In 1585, ended his <HI>third</HI> Lease; and he took a <HI>Lease</HI>, for <HI>Life</HI>, of <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Hugh Porter</HI>. In 1588, being then aged <HI>One-hundred and five Years</HI>, and having a Colt's Tooth in his Head, he did Penance in a <HI>White Sheet</HI>, in <HI>Alberbury</HI> Church, for Lying with a hand∣some Woman, named <HI>Katherine Milton</HI>, and, as it is here suggested, getting her with Child. Upon which Penance, says our Poet,
<Q><L>Should all, that so offend, such Penance do,</L>
<L>O! What a Price would <HI>Linnen</HI> rise unto!</L></Q>
In 1595, he buried his Wife <HI>Jane</HI>; after they had lived together Thirty-two Years. Having continued a Widower ten Years, and, being now <HI>One-hundred Twenty-two Years of Age</HI>, he married, in the Year 1605, <HI>Jane</HI> the Widow of <HI>Anthony Adda</HI>, Daugh∣ter of <HI>John Loyde</HI>, of the Parish of <HI>Gillsels</HI>, in <HI>Montgomery Shire</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI>; and they li∣ved thirty Years together. But now, think∣ing that Time might diminish the Strength of his <HI>Tenement</HI>, as it had increased the Va∣lue of his <HI>Tenure</HI>, he was, for his Wife's Sake, desirous to renew his <HI>Lease</HI> for Years; which was not complied with, though he politickly counterfeited the Renewal of his <HI>Age</HI>, by pretending to see, who had been long blind, a Pin on the Floor, which ha∣ving directed his Wife to lay there, he bid her, take up, in Presence of his Landlord's Son, Mr. <HI>Edward Porter</HI>, with whom it passed as a pleasant Conceit, but it had no Effect. Soon after, <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI>, a great Lover of Antiquities, visiting an Estate of his, in those Parts, was led by the Fame of this great Curiosity, this <HI>Thomas de Temporibus</HI>, to visit him. He took him into his Protection, and, having prevailed on him to see <HI>London</HI>, ordered a Litter with two Horses for his Carriage; and being attended by his Daughter-in-Law, named <HI>Lucy, John the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>, and a Servant of his Lordship's,
<PB N="66" REF="66"/>
named <HI>Brian Kelley</HI>, who defrayed their Ex∣pences on the Road, they set out from <HI>Win∣nington:</HI> But, when they arrived at <HI>Coventry</HI>, the Multitude of People grew so great and pressing, to behold this breathing Monument, that <HI>Kelley</HI> was afraid he should be able to carry his Charge no further. At last, with slow Marches, they arrived safe at <HI>London</HI>, about the End of <HI>September</HI>, 1635. King <HI>Charles</HI> having had Certificates from the Gentry of <HI>Shropshire</HI> of the Leases aforesaid, and other Particulars, proving <HI>Thomas Parr</HI>, to be the <HI>Eldest Son</HI> of <HI>Time</HI>, alive; he was admitted to Court, admired with great Ve∣neration, and had the Honour to kiss his Majesty's Hand, Care was taken to accom∣modate him with all Conveniences, in a Lodging provided for him at <HI>Westminster</HI>: But the Change agreed not; he had breath∣ed in a freer Air, fed on simpler Diet, nor had been used to such Throngs of Visitors. All which, though now grown very decri∣pid, so as not to walk, without two Persons to support him, and having only one Tooth left in his Head, not his <HI>Colt's Tooth</HI> before∣mentioned, might hasten his natural Decay; and he at last paid the Debt of Nature like other Men, though it was longer delayed, in the Middle of <HI>November</HI> following; after he had been, little more than six Weeks, re∣moved to the City aforesaid, as appears in the Title-page above; and he was decently buried in the <HI>Abbey</HI>. But that <HI>Postscript</HI> is not sufficiently explained in the said <HI>Title</HI>; for it contains only such remarkable Acci∣dents as happened not in, or concerning his own <HI>Life</HI>, but only in the Times, when he <HI>lived</HI>.</Q>

<Q>These <HI>Soap-boilers</HI> appear to have under∣gone a tedious, expensive, and cruel Persecu∣tion, by those Courtiers, who had procured a Patent to supplant them, and engross their Business. After twenty or thirty Freemen of the Trade had, for many Years, carried it on quietly, two Patents were granted to <HI>And. Palmer</HI>, and <HI>Rog. Jenes</HI>, for Twenty-one Years, to make <HI>Hard-scap</HI> with <HI>Berdla</HI>, and <HI>Soft-scap</HI>, without Fire, by sundry Mo∣tions, and not boiling it; and to make <HI>Pot∣ashes</HI> of <HI>English</HI> Materials; but they, not a∣ble to do much Damage, imparted their In∣vention to Sir <HI>W. Russel</HI>, Sir <HI>Basil Brook</HI>, Sir <HI>Rich. Weston</HI>, Sir <HI>Edw. Stradling</HI>, and others; who, in <HI>December</HI>, 1631, procured a Grant to make <HI>Hard</HI>, and <HI>Soft-soap</HI>, for fourteen Years. Soon after, Sir <HI>H. Comp∣ton</HI>, Sir <HI>H. Guilford</HI>, Sir <HI>N. Fortescue</HI>, Sir <HI>Bas. Brook</HI>, Sir <HI>Rich. Weston, Geo. Gage</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and others, mostly <HI>Popish Recusants</HI>, upon Pretence of a new Invention of making <HI>White-soap</HI>, better, and cheaper, than what the <HI>Soap-makers</HI> of <HI>London</HI> could produce, for which they would pay his Majesty <HI>four Pounds per</HI> Tun, procured to be incorporated as a <HI>Society</HI> of <HI>Soap-makers</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI>, with Power to make all Manner of <HI>Soap</HI>; to search all <HI>Soap</HI> made by others; and mark it before they sold it, or else destroy it: Al∣so to use the Trade, take Apprentices, &amp;c. In <HI>April</HI>, 1632, Sir <HI>William Russel</HI>, and his Partners, assigned over their Privilege of making <HI>Soft-soap</HI>, &amp;c. to this <HI>Westminster Corporation</HI>, who indentured with the King, To make <HI>Five-thousand Tuns of White-Soap yearly</HI>, or more, if required: And, after the first Year, to pay him <HI>four Pounds the Tun</HI>; and not to sell it for above <HI>three Pence</HI> the Pound. From these specious Overtures of those <HI>Monopolists</HI>, through that Grant, arose much Loss to the Crown, and great Grie∣vance to the regular Tradesmen aforesaid. For first the King allowed <HI>Five-thousand Pounds</HI> to Sir <HI>John Bourchier</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI>, for their Expences in the Project; and the Cor∣poration, finding the new <HI>White-Soap</HI>, after all their Artifices, would not vend, to dis∣able the <HI>London Soap-makers</HI>, from affording to sell <HI>theirs</HI> at the Price by <HI>these</HI> proposed, procured a Proclamation that no Soap should be sold, made with <HI>Fish Oyl</HI>, but only that of <HI>Olives</HI> or <HI>Rape</HI>; so that all the old <HI>Soap-makers</HI> Stock lay upon their Hands. Then came, in <HI>November</HI> following, <HI>Informations</HI> in the <HI>Star-Chamber</HI> against <HI>Sixteen</HI> of the <HI>London Soap-makers</HI>, for proceeding in their established Way: To this the Defendants pleaded and demurred. But it were a Pe∣nance, to mention the <HI>Proclamations, Decrees</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="67"/>
and <HI>Attachments</HI> made in this Business; or to recite, how they were harrassed, delayed, over-ruled; in short, pillaged, and every other Way distressed by that Court, under the Notion of <HI>Law</HI>. In the End, they were all <HI>fined</HI>, from Five-hundred, to Fif∣teen-hundred Pounds a Man; and <HI>imprison∣ed</HI>; most, for ten, one for near twelve Months; that is, from the 10th of <HI>May</HI>, 1633, to the 6th of <HI>April</HI>, 1634, and two of them <HI>died</HI> in that <HI>Restraint</HI>. Then came Orders to <HI>estreat</HI> the <HI>Fines</HI>; and <HI>Extents</HI> were issued upon their <HI>Goods</HI>; they were dis∣abled to use their Trade, and others made Soap with their Materials. The <HI>Westmin∣ster</HI> Soapers had <HI>Licence</HI>, upon the Badness of their <HI>White-Soap</HI>, to make old Soap, with Fish Oyl, for which those of <HI>London</HI> had been sentenced; and, against their own De∣cree, to sell it at a Penny in the Pound dear∣er, than Soap of the like Goodness was usu∣ally sold for before, by the <HI>London</HI> Soap-ma∣kers; and warranted one of the <HI>Sixteen</HI> afore∣said, to make that Soap for them, against his own Covenant to the Contrary; and or∣dered that none should buy any, but of this Corporation. Officers were impowered to enter all Houses, and carry off all Soap un∣marked; break down Pans, Fatts, Cisterns, &amp;c. Drove many to Flight in the Country, beyond Sea, &amp;c. At length, after this Cor∣poration had spent <HI>One-hundred and Fifteen-thousand Pounds</HI> in Soap-making, Salaries, Law, &amp;c. and vexed the whole Kingdom, for <HI>three Years</HI>, and usurped the Soap-makers Trade, <HI>one Year</HI> and a <HI>Quarter</HI>, they ob∣tained a Grant from the King, of <HI>Forty-thousand Pounds</HI>, for Surrendering their Pa∣tent, and <HI>Three-thousand Pounds</HI> for Charges of their Houses, paid them by the <HI>London</HI> Soap makers; who were also obliged to take off their Materials, at their own Rates, a∣mounting to above <HI>Twenty-thousand Pounds</HI> more; besides <HI>Five-hundred Pounds</HI>, for not meddling with the <HI>Soap-makers</HI> Houses: And all this, only to have the Use of their Trade again. Then the King incorporated the <HI>London Soap makers</HI>; and though those of <HI>Westminster</HI> had paid him but <HI>four Pounds per</HI> Tun, and, for a short Time, <HI>six Pounds</HI>; these of <HI>London</HI>, without any Liberty of rai∣sing the Price, were obliged to pay <HI>eight Pounds</HI> the Tun; which, in about three Years, amounted to above <HI>Ninety-thousand Pounds</HI>. Thus suffered they, by <HI>Fines, Im∣prisonments, Ejectments, Spoil</HI> and <HI>Plunder</HI>, from <HI>June</HI> 1632, to <HI>May</HI> 1637, near five Years, to the Ruin of many, for their In∣compliance with the intolerable Usurpations of those <HI>Knights, Esquires</HI>, and <HI>Gentlemen</HI>. Wherefore, it is here, as reasonably, as it is humbly desired, That the said Patentees may be punished, and make the Sufferers full Recompence: That the Commodity may be reduced to its accustomed Price; and none suffered to use the Trade, but such as have been brought up, and are skilled in it.</Q>
<P N="238">238. A <HI>Discourse</HI> concerning the <HI>Successe</HI> of former <HI>Parliaments</HI> (In seven Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1642</P>
<Q>This Pamphlet was written with a very good Design; to shew the Esteem that <HI>Eng∣lish Parliaments</HI> were anciently held in, with∣out, as the Author professes, any Reflection upon the Proceedings of the present Parlia∣ment; and yet thereby to induce his Maje∣sty to pay such Regard thereto, as might still keep this grand <HI>Convention</HI> in its due Esteem and Efficacy. Alledging,
<Q>“They have been as much loved by sound and healthly Prin∣ces, as loathed by them who were out of Temper; the latter having thought them a Depression of their Dignity, as the for∣mer have esteemed them an Advantage ”to their Strength.</Q>
Concluding that,
<Q>“Their greatest Excellency is seen, when they have been used as a Diet by honourable and just Princes; such as this Nation hath often been blessed with; and such, who have thought it no more Disparagement, or Depression of their Dignity, to be ruled by the Sway of that great <HI>Council</HI>, than a wise Guider of a Ship would think it, to follow his Compass; or any Mathematician to be directed by his necessary Rules and ”and Instruments.</Q>

<Q>The Author of this <HI>Letter</HI>, which is prefixed, signs himself <HI>D. T.</HI> and says there∣in,
<Q>“That those <HI>Curtains</HI> of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Cha∣rity</HI>, which did so speciously <HI>cover</HI> this <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Darkness</HI>, are <HI>drawn</HI> from off it.

I believe your Lord∣ship, with more Boldness, will concur in this Sentence; when you shall hear, that the <HI>Venetian Ambassador</HI> was the <HI>Author</HI> of this little Story; a Man whose Religion would not permit him to favour the Re∣formed Churches, or to blast his own with any Falshood; especially in an <HI>Account</HI> to a wise State, which had employed him; a Man of dear Acquaintance with <HI>Panzani</HI>; and although no <HI>Master-Builder</HI>, yet a pious <HI>Servant</HI> and <HI>Spectator</HI> of the Work: When you shall also hear that the <HI>Italian Copy</HI> was first translated into <HI>French</HI>, for the great <HI>Cardinal</HI>'s Satisfaction; and I do not doubt it hath good Acquaintance in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Court, and could speak that ”Language long ago, &amp;c.</Q>
That this Ne∣gotiation of those <HI>Nuncio's</HI> was written by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambassador, may be read also in Dr. <HI>Heylyn's Life</HI> of Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI>, Page 388. That Dr. <HI>Gregorio Panzani</HI>, a <HI>Romish</HI> Priest, arrived in <HI>London</HI>, the Twenty-fifth of <HI>December</HI>, 1634, to move that a <HI>Catholick Bishop</HI> might reside in <HI>England</HI>, under cer∣tain Limitations, to moderate the Differences between the Secular and Regular Clergy and the Jesuits. But hearing what Disturbance Dr. <HI>Smith</HI>, Bishop of <HI>Chalcedon</HI>, had made among them, by Contesting for the Power of <HI>Ordinary</HI> over all <HI>England</HI>, to the Driving him into <HI>France</HI>; and as the Oath of Allegi∣ance could not be allowed of by the Pope, Seignior <HI>Panzani</HI> was advised to drop that Scheme, and procure the Allowance of a <HI>Nuncio</HI> to come to the <HI>Queen</HI>, by whom the Courts, that is, the Religions might be reconciled. Accordingly, here arrived, in <HI>July</HI>, 1636, as the Pope's Resident, Seignior <HI>George Con</HI>, a <HI>Scotchman</HI>, Secretary for the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue to Cardinal <HI>Barbarini</HI>, who was splendidly received, but it was believed by our Author, he would not effectually succeed, because he ingratiated too much with the Jesuits;
<Q>“which if the Court perceive says he, may diminish the good Opinion, which is now conceived of him. For both the <HI>Archbishop</HI>, and Bishop of <HI>Chichester</HI>, have said often, that there are but <HI>two Sorts of Persons</HI> likely to impeach and hinder <HI>Re∣conciliation</HI>: To wit, <HI>Puritans</HI> amongst the <HI>Protestants</HI>, and <HI>Jesuits</HI> among the ”<HI>Catholicks</HI>.</Q></Q>

<Q>That <HI>History</HI> of Q. <HI>Mary</HI>, and her Son King <HI>James</HI>, which this <HI>Pamphlet</HI> has here, in many Particulars, notably corrected, was written dy <HI>William Sanderson</HI>; but it would require a Volume to correct all the Mistakes and Misrepresentations, which that incom∣petent and prejudiced Historian has made therein. The Character, here given of that <HI>History</HI>, has been intirely concurred in, by many able Writers, who have had Occasion to trace it. The ingenious Author says,
<Q>“That <HI>Sanderson</HI> has therein compiled, not an <HI>History</HI>, but a <HI>Libel</HI>, against all the good Men, and good Actions of those Times; and, with most servile <HI>Flattery</HI>, praised and exalted the bad, both Men and Matters. His whole Book is a <HI>Rap∣sody</HI> of Notes, and scattered Papers, from other Men, collected without either <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Method</HI>; being exceedingly defective, both in <HI>Time, Place</HI>, and <HI>Nomination</HI>; and written in so unseemly and disjointed a <HI>Stile</HI>, that you may easily perceive he hath taken up other Men's <HI>Words</HI>, without understanding their <HI>Matter</HI>; and, unless it be where he rails on Persons of Honour, which he doth <HI>plainly</HI>, and <HI>often</HI>, though sometimes very falsly, his Language is ”dark, harsh, and unintelligible.</Q>
Further this intelligent Author, being acquainted with most of the eminent Personages which are by <HI>Sanderson</HI> so much disfigured and tra∣duced, had great Advantages as well as In∣clination to rectify their Stories and do Jus∣tice to Truth: In doing which, he has ac∣quainted us with some curious Pieces of se∣cret History, whereof all other Writers have been silent. Particularly, it was here first made known, why Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> is so partially treated by <HI>Sanderson</HI>, because his Father pretending <HI>Ralegh</HI> owed him much Money, and it being brought to Trial, he was found <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Debtor in very great Sums, for which he died in Prison. Here are also some Aspersions wiped off from the Memory of Queen <HI>Elisabeth</HI>; others cast on the Noble House of <HI>Pembroke</HI>, upon Sir <HI>T. Overbury, Hen. Rich</HI>, Earl of <HI>Holland</HI>, &amp;c, &amp;c. The Author's Name is not printed before this Pamphlet, but we learn elsewhere that it was written by <HI>Carew Ralegh</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Son of Sir <HI>Walter</HI> aforesaid, who was sometime Gentleman of the Privy-Chamber to King <HI>Charles the First</HI>, a Colonel in the Army, Member in the House of Com∣mons, and Governor of the Isle of <HI>Jer∣sey</HI>.</Q>

<Q>“It being his daily Practice, as it was his Father's and Grand∣father's, before him, and most of his Fa∣mily, to <HI>save Lives</HI>, of all Ages, Sexes, and in all Cases; which had made him as necessary in Courts, and noble Families, as Cottages; and gave him the Honour, to be <HI>first Physician</HI> to his Majesty in Or∣dinary, and to the Royal Progeny: Ha∣ving now outlived all his Senior Doctors, ”in Court, College and both Universities.</Q>

<Q>The Author, who was a Practitioner in Physick, and a Native of <HI>Bristol</HI>, dedicates this his ingenious Treatise to K. <HI>Charles</HI>. There are many entertaining Remarks, ma∣ny Philosophical and Historical Illustrations, as well as good Medicinal Prescriptions in it, relating to the Causes and Cures of all destructive <HI>Contagions</HI>; especially that which then raged in this Nation: And there may also be some few Instances of his being led a little into <HI>Credulity</HI> by the Authorities of some Writers, otherwise, or for the Gene∣rality of good Credit; as where he treats of <HI>Amulets</HI> and especially <HI>Witches</HI>. We have surely been mischievously enough credulous, in the mischievous Power of <HI>Witches</HI>; but when they shall be asserted, upon the Testi∣monies of <HI>Hercules Saxonia</HI>, and the candid <HI>Sennertus</HI>, and the ocular Observation of the learned Dr. <HI>Ursinus</HI>, or any other learned Doctor, to have more Power in their Graves than ever was allowed them above Ground, even to the Spreading this <HI>Epidemical</HI> Mis∣chief of <HI>Plagues</HI> among Mankind: When it shall be affirmed that, in Death, they for∣bear not the Habits of Life, but are disco∣vered <HI>gnawing</HI> and <HI>devouring</HI> their very
<PB N="74" REF="74"/>
Shrowds, or whatever lies next them; and, that such <HI>Plagues</HI> shall not cease, till their Heads are divided from their Carcases; these strange Reports may raise <HI>Consternation</HI> in some, but will certainly administer Matter of <HI>Consolation</HI> to others; in Finding that, as great Stupidity and Absurdity of Opinion, prevails in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI>, as does in <HI>England</HI>. Among his <HI>Prognosticks</HI>, the Re∣mark he makes, from <HI>Simon Kelway</HI> and others, that <HI>Children</HI>, Mimicking Funerals, Armies, and Battles, predict <HI>Mortalities</HI> and <HI>Civil Wars</HI>; will be accounted, by some, but a <HI>Childish</HI> Remark: But others will look upon that King's Chaplain as a Conju∣rer, who, twenty Years before this Plague, preaching at <HI>Bristol</HI>, against black Patches, or Beauty-spots, said they were Fore-runners of other <HI>Spots</HI>, and Marks of the <HI>Plague</HI>; which soon after broke out there, and drove all the patched Women out of the City. In his Section of <HI>Preservation</HI>, he instances how durably the <HI>Infection</HI> will lurk among Cloths, in that fatal <HI>furred Gown</HI>, which <HI>Fracastorius</HI> affirms to have killed five and twenty Men in <HI>Verona</HI>, one after another, with the <HI>Plague. Lastly</HI>, In his Section <HI>of the Cure of the Pestilence</HI>, he makes great Use of <HI>Vinegar</HI>, in all his Ingredients, and gives us a particular <HI>Panegyrick</HI> upon its extraor∣dinary Efficacy, not only in this, but many other Distempers, from Page 79, to 86; where he says, <HI>it is for the Virtue of</HI> Vinegar <HI>that I wrote this Book</HI>; and, <HI>I had rather take</HI> Vinegar <HI>by itself, than many other, nay, than any other single Medicine without it</HI>. He also speaks highly in Praise of the <HI>Oils</HI> of <HI>Vitriol</HI>, and of <HI>Brimstone</HI>.</Q>

<Q>This was a searching <HI>Proclamation</HI>, and did very much alarm the <HI>English</HI> Priests, both at Home and Abroad: Insomuch that they hereupon published several virulent Li∣bels against some of the Queen's Council, particularly the Lord <HI>Burleigh</HI>, who had a special Hand, and others of the Ministry, who were consulted, in the Composition thereof. More especially it produced that pretended <HI>Answer</HI>, in <HI>Latin</HI>, under the fic∣titious Name of <HI>Andreas Philopater</HI>, printed in several Countries abroad, the following Year, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And it was soon after, in that Year also, published in <HI>English</HI>, under the Title of <HI>An Advertisement, written to a Secretary of my Lord Treasurer's of Ingland, by an English Intelligencer, as he passed through</HI> Germany <HI>towards</HI> Italy, <HI>concerning another Book newlie written in Latin</HI>, &amp;c. <HI>against her Majesties late Proclamation</HI>, &amp;c.

<Q>This Tract may be reckoned among those Monuments, in Memory of the Meritorious, which are too scarcely met with, and suffered too much to run to Ruin. It is founded up∣on a pretty Platform, in Prose and Verse; with a very commendable Design, by re∣viving the honourable Actions of our re∣nowned <HI>Predecessors</HI>, to inspire an Emula∣tion in their hopeful <HI>Posterity</HI>. It is dedi∣cated to Sir <HI>William Webbe</HI>, Lord-Mayor of <HI>London</HI>, by the Author, who calls himself a poor <HI>Apprentice</HI>; but he had no barren Brain, however it might not be perfectly cultivated with Learning; as he appears more exalted in his Genius, than exact, perhaps, every where, in his Language; which yet, is of∣ten very polite, elegant, and poetical, for the Time he wrote in. The <HI>Introduction</HI>, in Prose, discovers <HI>Fame</HI> taking her Flight to <HI>Parnassus</HI>; and there, having found her Secretaries the <HI>Muses</HI>, at their Exercises, in their fragrant Bower, expressed her Will and Pleasure, to have the <HI>Renown</HI> of her <HI>nine London Worthies revived</HI>. Then she beckoned out <HI>Clio</HI> for this Service; who clasping up her <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Histories</HI>, and taking her <HI>golden Pen</HI>, they mounted <HI>Fame</HI>'s Silver Chariot, drawn by <HI>Pegasus</HI>; who transport∣ed them through the Air, like <HI>Jove</HI>'s blazing Darts, and never stopped his downward Course, till his steely Hoofs beat against the Gates of <HI>Tartarus</HI>; were leaving the crook∣ed thorny Way, smoking with Sulphur, and keeping on the opposite Side, they arrived at the delightful <HI>Elesian</HI> Shades, there find∣ing, among the several Habitations, that of <HI>Amber</HI>, more sweetly scented still, with the burning Boughs of <HI>Balm</HI>, used to cure brave Warriors Wounds; <HI>Fame</HI> shook her im∣mortal Wings, and straight the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lodious <HI>Noise</HI>, with the <HI>Breath</HI> fanned from their Feathers, awakened <HI>nine comely Knights</HI>, who Arm in Arm, upon a green Bank, strewed with Rose Buds, had laid their con∣quering Heads to rest in Peace. Then <HI>Fame</HI> admonishing <HI>Clio</HI> to be attentive, and re∣cord what she heard, advances to the first, a tall, aged Man, with white Hair, in a Scarlet Robe, his Head bound with Balm, and a Sword in his Hand, touches his Lips with her Finger; and He, who was Sir <HI>William Wallworth</HI>, Fishmonger and Lord-Mayor of <HI>London</HI>, in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> II, re∣counts his Story in <HI>Verse</HI>: It is a Poem of about five Pages in Stanzas of six Lines. Then comes a short Discourse in <HI>Prose</HI>, con∣taining some Reflexions by the <HI>Author</HI>, some Resolutions by <HI>Fame</HI>, and some Remarks by <HI>Clio</HI>; when rose another of those venerable Knights, and framed his Tale, in near three Pages of <HI>Verse</HI> after the like Manner; by which it appears, that he was Sir <HI>Henry Pi∣chard</HI>, Vintner, and Lord-Mayor of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. That he led 5000 Men in his Return from the Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of <HI>France</HI>; and that he then enter∣tained <HI>four Kings</HI>, one <HI>Prince</HI>, and all their <HI>Train</HI> at a Banquet. Next after a short Conference, again in <HI>Prose</HI>, between <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Clio</HI>, arose Sir <HI>William Sevenoake</HI>, Gro∣cer, and Lord-Mayor of <HI>London</HI>, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V. And he recounts in <HI>Verse</HI>, for about two Pages, his strange For∣tunes and worthy Acts, being found under seven Oaks, from whence he had his Name, which grew where a Town is known to have been raised from his Bounty and Foun∣dations in <HI>Kent</HI>. In the <HI>French</HI> Wars, he is here said to have been surprized by the <HI>Dau∣phin</HI> of <HI>France</HI>, as he lay asleep, who re∣proached him for his Laziness; but to con∣vince him of his Activity, he fought him; and, when they parted, the <HI>Dauphin</HI> bid him be proud he had had such an Adversary, and gave him a Bag of Crowns for his Bra∣very. After some further Representation of him in <HI>Prose</HI>, as to his Entertainment, and Meditations in those Regions; he re∣turns to his Rest; and another lists up his aged Limbs, Sir <HI>Thomas White</HI>, Merchant-Taylor, and Lord-Mayor of <HI>London</HI>, in the Time of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; and he unfolds his Merits in <HI>Verse</HI>, for near two Pages; and though not as a Warrior, yet as a singular Benefactor to the Learned and the Poor. When he had laid himself down, <HI>Clio</HI> then
<PB N="80" REF="80"/>
converses again in <HI>Prose</HI>, and asking <HI>Fame</HI>, who she designed should next relate his Life, is answered, Sir <HI>John Bonham</HI>, Mer∣cer in the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> I. <HI>Clio</HI> then modestly excepts against the Misplacing him here, who lived so long before the former. But <HI>Fame</HI> justifies her present Method, by preferring their <HI>Age</HI>, and the Honour of their <HI>Calling</HI>, before the Observation of <HI>Time</HI>. And as our Poets have placed the Worthiest formost, in Respect to them, and the Ex∣ample of others: So it would not be un∣seemly, that younger Knights should here speak after those who had borne the Honour of the Mayoralty. After the personal Figure of this Knight is described, and he is sum∣moned to display his Story, he rehearses it, for near four Pages in <HI>Verse</HI>, like the rest; wherein he appears to have been a <HI>Devonshire</HI> Man, the Son of a Knight; but being bound to the Trade aforesaid, was sent by his Master with Goods to <HI>Denmark</HI>; where, by some fortunate Dispute, he was made favourably known to the King; soon after, he shewed his supe∣rior Valour at a Turnament, and had a Fa∣vour given him by the King's Daughter. Was sent General of the King's Army a∣gainst <HI>Soliman</HI> the Great <HI>Turk</HI>, overcame him, and was knighted by him in the Field; returned Home with rich Gifts and great Glory, and died in Honour and Peace. Next, after an Expostulation in <HI>Prose</HI>, be∣tween the Goddess of <HI>Renown</HI>, and her <HI>Muse</HI>, upon that surprising Grace shewn by a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Tyrant, to a <HI>Christian</HI> Con∣queror of him, another young gay Knight arises, named Sir <HI>Christopher Croker</HI>, Vint∣ner in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and he chants out his Feats in like Manner, for the Space of two Pages, in <HI>Verse</HI>; wherein it is recorded, that he served his Time un∣der his Master, who was named <HI>Stodie</HI>, in <HI>Gracious Street</HI>, and gained the Affections of his Daughter. But, being pressed to the Wars of <HI>France</HI>, was soon made Chief o∣ver a Band of Soldiers, and was the First who entered the Gates at the Siege of <HI>Bur∣deaux</HI>. Then went with the Army that re∣stored Don <HI>Peter</HI> to the Throne of <HI>Spain</HI>, which had been usurped by his Bastard Brother. Received the Honour of Knight∣hood for his Services. Returned Home, finished his Triumphs in Matrimony, and made <HI>Doll. Stodie</HI> a Lady. After a short Interval of <HI>Prose</HI>, as before, another valiant Knight, Sir <HI>John Hawkwood</HI>, in the Reign aforesaid, arose, and sung his strange Ad∣ventures and Fortunes in foreign Countries, in about two Pages also of <HI>Verse</HI>; which inform us, That, while he was Apprentice to a Taylor in <HI>Lombard Street</HI>, he was pressed to serve the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in the Wars of <HI>France</HI>, where he behaved in so distinguished a Manner on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that the Prince mounted him gallantly, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for his brave Behaviour afterwards, in Company with three others, knighted him, and call∣ed them his own Knights. When the Prince returned Home, he gave him a Gold Chain, and Liberty to try his Fortune in fo∣reign Service; so he went, with fifteen-hun∣dred Men under him, to the Assistance of the Duke of <HI>Milan</HI> against his Enemies, and, for the Sharpness of his Wit and his Sword, was called by the <HI>Italians, John Acute</HI>. Here he had Honour and Riches, in Plenty, heaped upon him; had Castles and Towns given him for his Reward. But <HI>Millan</HI> having, by his Valour and Policy, won a Peace, the <HI>Pope</HI> oppressed <HI>Spain</HI>, and he marched thither with an Army to quell his Pride, which having done, he Returned; and having worn out the remainder of his Days in great Honour and State, died in the Palace at <HI>Padua</HI>, and had a magnificent Monument and Statue raised over his Grave. Here, after some Interlocution again between <HI>Fame</HI> and her <HI>Historian</HI> in <HI>Prose</HI>, the next, Sir <HI>Hugh Calverley</HI>, the Honour of Silkweavers in the Reign afore∣said, arose, and delivered his Tale in the like <HI>Verse</HI>, for near two Pages: How, after the Service of his Prince, in the Wars of <HI>France</HI>, he was invited into that of the King of <HI>Poland</HI>, where his Valour gained him high Renown. There he killed a huge wild Boar, which had caused much Destruc∣tion. For this, and many other gallant Feats, he was crowned with Laurel and Gold, clad in Purple, shod with golden Buskins, and had a Casket of Pearls bestow∣ed upon him, by Ladies, Nobles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and, so adorned, rode with the King to Court. And when engaged in their triumphal Justs, it was with such superiour Valour, and sur∣prizing
<PB N="81" REF="81"/>
Vehemence, that the Blood would burst forth at his Beaver. After he was laden with Honours there, he returned a∣gain to <HI>France:</HI> And here his Tale con∣cludes, with Mention of his Death. Next follows the Imparlance, as aforesaid, in <HI>Prose</HI>; then arises the last of these <HI>Nine Worthies</HI>, Sir <HI>Henry Maleverer</HI>, sirnamed <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Cornhill</HI>, Grocer, in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and relates his Acts in above two Pages of <HI>Verse</HI>. How he went a Vo∣luntier to the Holy Wars; was chosen, by the Ambassadors, to fight in single Combat there; and left not the Field, till he saw <HI>Jerusalem</HI> taken. But was unjustly brought into Disgrace with the Ruler of the <HI>Jews</HI>, and took Sanctuary, or Concealment, in <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well; where he suffered none to drink who did not first fight with him, till his Valour and his Innocence became so well known, that the King vowed him great Friendship, and his false Accusers were put to Death; and so with Honour and Fame he returned to his native Country. Then <HI>Fame</HI> concludes the Whole in <HI>Prose</HI>, commanding <HI>Clio</HI> to clasp up the <HI>Book</HI>, wherein she had written the <HI>Deeds</HI> of the <HI>Nine Worthies</HI>, and, at her Leisure, publish it, for their Honour, and the Example of others; which she accordingly did.</Q>

<Q>There is a wooden Print in the Frontis∣piece, giving a Prospect of the dreadful Dan∣ger and Destruction, occasioned by Houses set on Fire: One Woman letting her Child out at Window by a Cord, another prepair∣ing to jump out, Men below plucking down the Buildings with long Hooks; others a∣bove pouring in Buckets of Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Book is a Kind of <HI>Chronicle</HI> of those many Conflagrations which happened over almost Half the Counties of the Kingdom, within the Compass of the four last Years; that is, from the Beginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign; mentioning the <HI>Places</HI> where such <HI>Fires</HI> happened; the <HI>Times</HI> when, and the <HI>Persons</HI> who perished, or were ruined there∣by; with the Particulars of their <HI>Losses</HI>; much increasing the Dearth and Poverty of the Nation; occasioned through their Suf∣ferings, also in this Period, from all the o∣ther <HI>Elements:</HI> From the <HI>Air</HI> by Pestilence; the <HI>Water</HI> by Inundations; and the <HI>Earth</HI>, by the Barrenness that was consequent thereto. It is computed that the <HI>Losses</HI> of particular Men, and the several <HI>Towns</HI> here mentioned, by Fire, only within those Years, besides the Damage done to Churches by <HI>Lightning</HI>, particularly that of <HI>Bleachingly</HI> in <HI>Surrey</HI>, amounted to 29690 Pounds; and that the Number of those who were undone, and lost their Lives, was 267 Persons; yet this Computation may not have included the De∣struction afterwards mentioned of the Town of <HI>Ipswich</HI> by Fire, in the same Year the Author published this Tract; nor that oc∣casioned by other Fires in <HI>London</HI>; particu∣larly one in 1604, which burnt down a whole Row of Chambers in <HI>Gray</HI>'s-<HI>Inn</HI>.

<Q>This is a sharp and free Representation of that <HI>Assembly</HI>, here called a <HI>Dissembly</HI>, and others, convened in <HI>Scotland</HI> before, to sus∣pend or discharge the Form of Discipline by <HI>Synods</HI> and <HI>Presbyteries</HI>, and establish a <HI>Pre∣latical</HI> Jurisdiction. The inconstant Princi∣ples of King <HI>James</HI>, in these Concerns of the <HI>Scotch Kirk</HI>, are here, in the Author's Epistle to the reverend Brethren in <HI>Scotland</HI>, expressly set forth; shewing that, in 1584, he set up Papal Bishops there; yet, in 1592, restored the <HI>Discipline</HI>, and swore by Sub∣scription, to defend it in <HI>Scotland</HI> all his Life. Consented to a Constitution of the General Assembly in <HI>Halirood House</HI>; and, in 1602,
<PB N="84" REF="84"/>
suffered it to be ordained that the <HI>Lord Bi∣shops</HI> should no longer have that Title, but be called <HI>Commissioners for the Kirk, to vote in Parliament:</HI> And that he promised, the Day before he went from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for <HI>England</HI>, to remove those <HI>Reliques</HI> of <HI>Antichrist</HI> from them; and yet, as well in 1606, as again now, he authorised, through the In∣stigations of the Archbishop of <HI>Canterbury (Bancroft</HI>) the <HI>Overthrow</HI>, by his Commissi∣oner, that Earl of <HI>Dunbar</HI>, and his Party, of that Government in those new <HI>Assemblies</HI>; which had been <HI>established</HI> in former ones, as well as by <HI>Parliament</HI>, and the <HI>Oaths</HI> of his <HI>Majesty, Nobles</HI>, and <HI>Ministers</HI>. The Earl aforesaid, by his Majority of Voices, having prevailed for the Authority of Bishops, produced the King's Instrument for the Dis∣charge of all Presbyteries, and at the Outcry of the Assembly against it, by promising to persuade the King to recall that Discharge, got the <HI>Hands</HI>, as well as the <HI>Votes</HI> of many sworn <HI>Balaamites</HI>. Those <HI>Episcopal Accidents</HI> spoken of in the Title, and here considered, as Judgments of God, are. 1. Concerning the late titular <HI>Bishop</HI> (as he is called) Maister <HI>James Nicholson</HI>, who, at his Death, was so troubled in Conscience, for accepting that Title, that he would not be called a Bishop in his Will, and therein rejected whatever was due to him out of his Bishoprick. 2. That the Archbishop of St. <HI>Androis</HI> was waked out of his Sleep, with the Cry of Blood and Murder; his Nephew having thrown his Dagger at the Cook, and killed him, as he was dressing his Lord's Supper. 3. That the said Archbishop coming out of <HI>Haddington</HI> Kirk, the Earth broke in with him, and he might have been swallowed up, had he not been pulled out by those, who were beside him.</Q>

<Q>This is a diligent <HI>Extract</HI> from all the Ancient Authors who mention the Story of that powerful <HI>Favourite</HI> of the Emperor <HI>Tiberius</HI>, enlivened and adorned with many political <HI>Reflexions</HI>, which may be appli∣cable to the Proceedings of favourite Mi∣nisters in most other Reigns. It has been by several of our Authors thought to have been drawn up, in Allusion to the great <HI>English</HI> Favourite at that Time, <HI>George Villiers</HI>, the foresaid Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI>, who was murdered in <HI>August</HI>, that same Year of its being printed. The Author of the <HI>Craftsman</HI>, has bestowed an whole Paper upon it, under that Consideration. And <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> has enlisted it among the Works of <HI>Philip Massinger</HI>, the Poet, as if he was the Author of it. But <HI>Quere</HI> if it is not a Translation from the <HI>French</HI>; for there was a noted <HI>French</HI> Writer at that Time, named <HI>P. Matthieu</HI>, who published some Account of <HI>Aelius Sejanus</HI> in his own Tongue, which was translated into <HI>Dutch</HI>, and printed at <HI>Amsterdam</HI> in 12<HI>mo</HI>, 1661.</Q>

<Q>The said Work, in the Original, seems to be that entitled, <HI>Della Peripetia di Fortuna, Overo sopra la Caduta di Seiano</HI>. There was before published, in <HI>French, Aelius Sejanus; Histoire Romaine: Recuillie de divers Autheurs. Second Edition. A Lyon, par Ant. Soubron</HI>, 8<SUP>0</SUP>. 1622. Whether this be <HI>P.

But there were afterwards published, <HI>Remarks upon the Life and Services of Monsieur de</HI> Villeroy: <HI>And concerning the Fall of</HI> Sejanus; <HI>Translated from the French of</HI> P. Matthieu, by Sir <HI>T. H. Quarto</HI>, 1638. And, the Year fol∣lowing, came forth a Translation by the same Hand, entitled, <HI>Unhappy Prosperity, expressed in the History of</HI> Ael.

<Q>That <HI>Samuel Chidley</HI> was the Author of this scarce Pamphlet; and to render it the more remarkable, as well as more suitable to his Subject, he has printed it all in <HI>Red Letters</HI>.

On the Eleventh of <HI>December</HI> following, he sent a <HI>Letter</HI> to the <HI>Commis∣sioners</HI> of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI>, and Goal De∣livery of <HI>Newgate</HI>, against the Cruelty of <HI>Pressing</HI> a Prisoner, who will not Plead <HI>Guilty</HI>, or <HI>Not Guilty:</HI> For that, he will not plead the <HI>Former</HI>, being not bound to <HI>accuse Himself</HI>; and, by pleading the <HI>Latter</HI>, is only forced into <HI>Lies</HI>. And shews, that he was not only himself turned out of Court,
<PB N="90" REF="90"/>
but that a Malefactor, then upon Trial for stealing, refusing to Plead, till that <HI>Letter</HI> was read publickly, was denied those Condi∣tions, and sentenced to the <HI>Press</HI> by the Recorder <HI>Steele</HI>. Hereupon follows his <HI>Pe∣tition</HI> to the <HI>Council of State</HI>, That the then Condemned Prisoners might be reprieved, till the Parliament had heard the Matter. And after this, we have his <HI>Proposals</HI> to the <HI>General Council</HI> for the <HI>Army:</HI> In which he offers several Arguments for reforming the Laws relating to the Trial and Punishment of Thieves and Robbers: Concluding, that, upon Conviction, they should be obliged to make double Satisfaction, if not out of their <HI>Effects</HI>, by their <HI>Labour</HI>. We have also, following this, His <HI>Letters</HI> to the <HI>Regulators of the Law</HI> appointed by the Parliament; wherein he tells them, that the best of their Actions, in that Character, had hitherto been, at most, but a <HI>Tything of Mint, Annis, and Cummin: And you have neglected Mercy, one of the weighty Matters of the Law:</HI> And was verily persuaded, They could not have put a Stop to the Murdering of those Men who were hanged at <HI>Tyburn</HI> the last Sessions, for stealing Five Shillings and Six∣pence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the End, there is an odd <HI>Advertisement</HI>, informing us, That Mr. <HI>Chidley</HI> appointed one of these <HI>Pamphlets</HI> to be nailed upon <HI>Tyburn Gallows</HI>, before the Execution, with this Motto over it:
<Q><L>Cursed be that bloody Hand,</L>

But it could not be nailed on the Gallows, for the Crowd of People; therefore it was nailed to the Tree which grew upon the Bank by the Gallows; and there it remain∣ed, and was read by many, both before and after Execution; and 'twas thought it would stand there till it dropped away.</Q>

<Q>It is not improbable but this Pamphlet was written by Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Antagonist, <HI>Henry Hickman</HI>, whether in Conjunction with any other Person, is not certain.

Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI>, in the <HI>Preface</HI> to the First Volume of his <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Reformation</HI>, has also given a true Character of Dr. <HI>Hey∣lin</HI>'s <HI>History</HI>; against which <HI>George Vernon</HI>'s Apology, in his <HI>Life</HI> of the <HI>Doctor</HI>, has had little Influence with the Publick.

And indeed, could he have <HI>answered</HI> all these <HI>Questions</HI>, as directly as they are propounded, we must have had a very clear and satisfac∣tory <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>London</HI>. How∣ever, the Answers he does make to those Questions may be thus briefly represented. 1. That it was <HI>done by</HI> the Permission of God through the Carelesness of Man; the <HI>Baker</HI>, or his Servants, in whose House it began. 2. As to <HI>what</HI> Damage it <HI>did</HI>, ha∣ving computed that the City of <HI>London</HI>,
<PB N="92" REF="92"/>
within the Walls, was seated upon about 460 Acres, which had about 15000 Houses thereon, besides Churches, Chapels, Halls, and other publick Buildings, he concludes about 12000 were burnt, which is four Parts in five, which, together with all other Build∣ings, Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he values at <HI>Seven Mil∣lions Three-hundred Thirty five-thousand Pounds</HI>. Then proceeds, in the same Section, to his <HI>Parallel</HI> of the Disasters at <HI>Mosco</HI>, as men∣tioned in the Title: But in this there was a wonderful Disparity, that not above <HI>half a Do∣zen Londoners</HI> were lost in our Conflagration, but above <HI>Two-hundred-thousand M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovites</HI> mi∣serably consumed in theirs. 3. As to the Place <HI>Where</HI>; he answers, with a short, but shining Encomium upon our <HI>Metropolis</HI>; the Suffer∣ings of which, might employ, he says, a better Pen, and be the Subject of a full Volume. 4. By <HI>What Means</HI>; This he answers by enlarg∣ing upon his first Paragraph, where he speaks of the <HI>Negligence</HI> of the <HI>Master</HI> or his <HI>Ser∣vant</HI>; the <HI>Darkness</HI> and <HI>Deadness</HI> of the Night; <HI>Narrowness</HI> of the <HI>Streets; Closeness</HI> and <HI>Rotten∣ness</HI> of the old Wooden <HI>Buildings</HI>; the <HI>Com∣bustible Goods</HI> and <HI>Merchandise</HI> stored all a∣bout; the great Heat and Drought of the preceding Summer; the violent <HI>Eastern</HI> Wind, which blew all the While, the most destruc∣tive of all others; they approaching over the Ocean, this, over the Continent; so as to burn our Flowers and Leaves of Trees, more than the hottest Sun: Lastly, the great Want of <HI>Water</HI>, particularly at that Time, the <HI>Thames</HI> Water-house being out of Order; and the great Want of <HI>Room</HI> in those Streets so contracted and so crouded with People, to play the Engines. 5. The Question <HI>Why</HI>, he leaves questionable, Whether for the Pu∣nishment of our <HI>Sins</HI>, the Trial of our <HI>Faith</HI>, or the Exercise of our <HI>Patience</HI>. 6. The Que∣stion <HI>How</HI> it was done, he refers, for an An∣swer, to the fourth Section. 7. And, lastly, <HI>When</HI>; he answers <HI>When</HI> we were newly come out of a <HI>Civil War</HI> of twenty Years Standing; wherein about 100,000 People perished: <HI>When</HI> the <HI>Plague</HI> had, the Year be∣fore swept away above 100,000 more; and was still raging: <HI>When</HI> the Kingdom was ex∣hausted of <HI>Money</HI>, and <HI>Trade</HI> lost: And <HI>When</HI> we had <HI>Wars</HI> with <HI>France, Denmark</HI>, and <HI>Holland</HI>, and not without Fear of Divisions among ourselves. Yet concludes he, by our Heavenly Father's paternal <HI>Corrections</HI>, and by his <HI>Mercies</HI>, we are rescued from cur <HI>Fears</HI> by <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Quietness</HI>, both at Home and A∣broad, restored to the <HI>Hopes</HI> of a flourishing Nation, and the most glorious City in the World. <HI>Crescit sub pondere Virtus.</HI></Q>
<P N="298">298. A <HI>Letter</HI> to a <HI>Person</HI> of <HI>Quality</HI>, Con∣cerning <HI>Fines Received</HI> by the <HI>Church</HI> at its <HI>Re∣storation</HI>. Wherein, by the Instance of One of the Richest <HI>Cathedrals</HI>, a very fair Guess may be made at the <HI>Receipts</HI> and <HI>Disbursements</HI> of All the Rest. By a Prebend of the Church of <HI>Can∣terbury</HI>. Printed (In One Sheet.) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1668</P>
<Q>This Author has only subscribed the Ini∣tial Letters of his Name at the End of his <HI>Letter</HI>, P. D. M. by which <HI>Anthony Wood</HI> might not recollect who was the Writer of it, if ever he did see it, or he would not have omitted it in the Catalogue of his Works. Though it is apparent enough, that the Author was Dr. <HI>Peter Du Moulin</HI>, then Chaplain in Ordinary to the King, and a Prebendary of <HI>Canterbury</HI>. His Motives, to this Performance, appear in the first Page to have risen from what had been said in a <HI>Pamphlet</HI> not long before published, entitled, <HI>A Proposition for the Safety and Peace of tho King and Kingdom</HI>, &amp;c. pag. 47. where the Writer is charged to have cast a groundless and undeserved <HI>Odium</HI> upon <HI>Cathedral</HI> Men, in depressing their <HI>Persons</HI>, and heightening their <HI>Emoluments</HI>; Characterizing them as; <HI>Low in their Condition, and in their Interests; Covetous, and Undeservedly Rewarded</HI>.
<Q>“And as to their <HI>Emoluments, of Twenty Years in One</HI>, if they were reasonable at <HI>Canter∣bury</HI> (says the Doctor) they could not be very <HI>Vast</HI> in other <HI>Cathedrals</HI>. Our <HI>Fines</HI>, adds he, are divided equally, but that the <HI>Dean</HI> hath double the Share of a Prebend, and the Total of that great Income of our first <HI>Fines</HI> (deducting the <HI>Reparation</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>, and our <HI>Present</HI> to our <HI>Royal</HI> Benefactor) the Share of each of the Twelve Canons was about <HI>Eleven Hundred Pounds</HI>. Such a Sum was no excessive Reward for long Suf∣ferers, and constant Actors in the King's Cause, of which the most Part of our Society consisteth. I am none of the
<PB N="93" REF="93"/>
greatest Losers of the Clergy: Yet, I may truly say, that this Proportion did hardly amount to the third Part of my Losses, by Sequestration and other Vio∣lences of the War. Such moderate Showers, falling upon Lands parched with a long Drought, could not drench them to an Exuberancy, to leave Pools above Ground. The Condition of my Brethren could not ”be much different from mine.</Q>
—And a little further;
<Q>“What had become of Ours, and all the <HI>Cathedral</HI> Churches, if all the <HI>Fines</HI> had been taken from them before the Admission of the <HI>Canons?</HI> That of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, though much de∣faced by <HI>Culmer</HI>, and the Fanatick Sol∣diers, and decayed by a Neglect of well nigh twenty Years, was more entire than most <HI>Cathedrals</HI> in <HI>England</HI> when we came to it; yet, in the Year 1664, we found that the <HI>Reparations</HI> of it stood us in <HI>Twelve-thousand Pounds</HI>; all that Ex∣pence arising out of <HI>Fines</HI>. But for the <HI>Fines</HI>, all the <HI>Cathedrals</HI> in the Kingdom, by this Time, had been Heaps of Ruins: Without the <HI>Fines</HI>, these <HI>Great Fabricks</HI>, the <HI>Greatest</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI>, cannot yet be ”preserved from Ruin, &amp;c.</Q>
We have been long learning, with St. <HI>Paul</HI>, how to Want; but have had no Occasion, as yet, to learn how to abound. But the popular Rumour, that we have all the Money of the Land, hath taught us another Doctrine, <HI>Est. inter Causas Paupertatis, Opinio Divitiarum:</HI> Certainly, one of the great Causes of <HI>Po∣verty</HI> is to be esteemed <HI>Rich</HI>; another, to think ourselves obliged to justify that Opi∣nion.</Q>

<Q>This noted Author, having diligently per∣used, extracted, and digested whatever he could meet with upon this Subject, finds his Discourse will fall under these Propositions. 1. That it is of great and certain Advan∣tage. 2. That it lies fairer for the Subjects of <HI>Great Britain</HI>, than for the <HI>Hollanders</HI>. 3.

<P N="302">302. An <HI>Essay</HI> to the <HI>Restoring</HI> of our <HI>De∣cayed Trade</HI>. Wherein is described, the <HI>Smug∣glers, Lawyers</HI>, and <HI>Officers Frauds</HI>, &amp;c. By <HI>Joseph Trevers</HI>. Printed for <HI>Giles Widdowes</HI>, &amp;c. (In Thirty-three Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1677</P>
<Q>The Author dedicates this Tract to the Right Hon. <HI>Edward Seymour</HI>, Speaker of the House of Commons, Treasurer of the Navy, and one of the Privy-Council; part∣ly because he had been so conversant in and about the Counties of <HI>Devon, Somerset</HI>, and <HI>Wilts</HI>; where the Trade of <HI>Clothing</HI> is so much used. There are two or three Copies of Verses printed with this Work, in Praise of the Author, and our <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI>; before one of which he is called Capt. <HI>Joseph Trevers</HI>. And he says of himself, That, by reason of his Employment in the Trade of a <HI>Clothier</HI>, and afterwards in the Office of <HI>Surveyor</HI> of one of the <HI>Ports</HI> of this King∣dom, at the <HI>Custom-House</HI>, he is experimen∣tally enabled to speak of these Things. And indeed, he does well set forth the great Ad∣vantages of our <HI>Woollen Trade</HI>, and the much greater it might produce, but for the many Abuses of it. He shews ingenuously, how every Two Pounds of <HI>Wooll</HI>, worth about Twenty-pence, will make a Yard of <HI>Kersey</HI>, worth five or six Shillings; and every four Pounds of <HI>Wooll</HI>, worth about Three-shillings and Four-pence, will make a Yard of <HI>Broad-Cloth</HI>, worth Eleven or Twelve Shillings: So that Two-thirds is the least Profit, that arises by put∣ting our Wooll into Manufactures; which amounts to above <HI>Two-hundred-thirty Pounds</HI> Sterling Profit in every <HI>Tun</HI> of <HI>Wooll</HI> so wrought up, accounting Twenty-hundred <HI>English</HI> Weight to the <HI>Tun</HI>. So that, if we should suppose, but an Hundred Tuns of Wooll Transported out of the Kingdom in a Year to <HI>France</HI>, unwrought, it will a∣mount to <HI>Twenty two-thousand four-hundred Pounds</HI> Sterling, which is so much clear Loss to the Kingdom, and treble so much Profit to <HI>France</HI>, by their working up three Times as much of their own with ours; besides the depriving thereby so many of our <HI>Poor</HI> from <HI>Work</HI>, and the <HI>Rich</HI> of their <HI>Rents</HI>. But, not∣withstanding those great Advantages in this Trade, it is here affirmed, that <HI>Millions</HI> of Money are lost to the King and Kingdom, by private Exportation of our <HI>Wooll</HI>, and <HI>Fuller</HI>'s <HI>Earth</HI>; the losing our Trade, and being undermined by the <HI>Dutch</HI>; the Impor∣tation of Foreign prohibited Goods, to the Detriment of the <HI>Silk-Weavers</HI>, &amp;c. and be∣sides the Loss by <HI>Smugglers</HI>; the Frauds of unfaithful <HI>Officers</HI>, and others concerned in the <HI>Law</HI>, are here complained of, and fur∣ther offered to be laid open, to prevent the

<Q>This <HI>Address</HI> was now published by its ingenious Author, upon the Occasion of a late <HI>Act</HI>, which, having laid a severe <HI>Restraint</HI> upon <HI>Printing</HI>, was now near expiring; in∣treating the said Parliament, before they think of continuing any such Act, to con∣sider these Arguments against such <HI>Inquisi∣tion</HI>, or <HI>Embargo upon Science</HI>. It is true, the Author has been beholden to some fine Sen∣timents of the Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>, upon the Topic of <HI>Studies</HI>, and publishing the Fruits thereof without <HI>Restraint</HI>; but he has so well chosen, and joined them so or∣derly together, that they look like Plants, which had been long slumbering, as Dead in their <HI>Winter</HI> Beds, when called forth by the general Warmth of the <HI>Spring</HI>, and decked with new Youth and Beauty. The Author was <HI>Charles Blount</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the younger Son of Sir <HI>Henry Blount</HI>; and, because he published this Tract under the Name of <HI>Phi∣lopatris</HI>, it is thought his Father had an Hand in the Composition.

whereof a spacious <HI>Sculpture</HI> was also en∣graved, and published in two large Sheets, by <HI>John Payne</HI>, if we mistake not his Name.

At the End of this Pamphlet, as well as the other, he has a Panegyrick upon Maister <HI>Gerard Christmas</HI>, for bringing the Pageants, and Figures in them, to such great Perfection, both in Symmetry and Substance; being before but mishapen Monsters, and only made of slight Wicker and Paper.

<Q><PB N="103" REF="103"/>Although this Pamphlet be <HI>Anonymous</HI>, there is a MS.

His Writing this Tract, was occasioned by the Execution of some Persons for <HI>Witches</HI>, at the Summer Assizes before, in <HI>Kent</HI>, the County in which this Author was born. His chief Purpose is to Examine and Confute an old Treatise upon the Subject written by Mr. <HI>William Perkins</HI>; who therein, though he produces Eighteen Signs for the Discovery of a Witch, he rejects Fourteen or Fifteen himself; the Sixteenth, which is the <HI>Party's own Confes∣sion</HI>, that Author also confesses insufficient; the Seventeenth, two <HI>credible Witnesses</HI>, he grants, can hardly be produced; because of the Secrecy of Diabolical Compacts; and the last, <HI>Satan's own Discovery</HI>; which, how it can be done, says our Author, except the Devil be bound over to give in Evidence a∣gainst the Witch, cannot be understood. And as Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> discredited his own Proofs; so does he likewise those of King <HI>James</HI>; which are, The <HI>Marks</HI> of a <HI>Witch</HI>; The <HI>Discovery</HI> of a <HI>Fellow-Witch</HI>, and the <HI>Swimming</HI> of a <HI>Witch</HI>, with her <HI>Inability</HI> to shed <HI>Tears</HI>; all which, with other like wise and weighty Arguments upon this Topic, his Majesty so handles, as would make some think he was himself bewitched. In short, our Author judiciously Distinguishes of this Doctrine of <HI>Witchcraft:</HI> That <HI>Ignorance</HI> in the Times of Darkness brought it forth; and <HI>Credulity</HI> in these Days of Light hath continued it.</Q>

Concerning the <HI>Legality</HI> of the <HI>Second Meeting</HI> of some of the <HI>Long Parliament</HI> Members: Also, A Fool's Bolt shot into <HI>Wal∣lingford</HI> House, by as good a Friend to <HI>England</HI> as any is there, concerning a <HI>Free State</HI>. (In eight Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1659</P>
<Q>More expresly, this Pamphlet discusses the Point, I. Whether the <HI>Men</HI> met together in the House at <HI>Westminster</HI>, where usually the <HI>Commons</HI> sat, were at that Day a Lawful <HI>Parliament</HI>, according to the Fundamental Laws of the Nation, to bind the People to obey their Commands? 2. Whether, as Things then stood, it was likely they should Compass the Design of setting up a <HI>Free State</HI>; as well in respect to Those who were to do it by greatest Pretence, as Those who would do it without any Pretence, and in respect of the Thing itself to be done. To∣wards the latter End, speaking of a <HI>Demo∣cracy</HI>, he says,
<Q>“It squares not with the <HI>Ge∣nius</HI> of this People; and while Mr. <HI>Har∣rington</HI> (speaking well of a Common∣wealth in general) would fit and calculate it for our Horizon, because it suits with other Nations, he talks like an Ass; for the Laws of every Nation are suited to the Constitution of the People. Were it pos∣sible now to alter the Fundamental Posi∣tive ancient Common Law of this Nation concerning Men and Times? It is im∣possible; however eager Wolves may bark at the Moon: And it is as impossible to subdue the Hearts of the People to an∣other Frame of Government, to have it

continue long. Alas! after the King's Death, the People, poor, beaten, tyred Parliament-ridden Wretches, were content to have any Thing to be quiet; but, as soon as <HI>Oliver</HI> stepped up into the Chair, see how willingly they conspired with Him. How chearfully they embraced him! Which was only because of the Government, and the Reduction of the ancient known Laws and Supremacy into the ancient Channel; for, as to his Person, they deemed him a Trai∣”tor.</Q>
And a little further—
<Q>“Let them, that wish for <HI>Charles Stuart</HI>'s Coming in again, make all they can for in <HI>Oligarchy</HI>; however, a <HI>Democracy</HI> will do it: And let the <HI>Soldiers</HI> alone and be quiet. For let them have a Common Enemy, or any Power to oppose; they'll join, and be Una∣nimous in such a Business: But let them rest, and have nothing to do, and they'll make something to do: Let them be Idle, and they'll be Busy; and, if they can find no Business, they'll make some; give them no Occasion of fighting with <HI>Others</HI>, and, my Life for it, they will fight with <HI>Them∣selves:</HI> And, <HI>when Thieves fall out, Honest ”Men will come by their own</HI>.</Q></Q>

<Q>The Author's Name is not printed to this Pamphlet, but there is a Manuscript Note in the Title-page, that it was written by <HI>Wil∣liam Penn</HI>, the Quaker.

<Q><HI>England</HI> being now engaged in a War with the <HI>Dutch</HI>, the Author thinks he could not more seasonably than now transmit these Papers to the said Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>. And in the 4th Page thus characterises the Writer of the foregoing Pamphlet and his Work:
<Q>“This Author treats of our Domestick Af∣fairs not only more Rationally, but more like a Man concerned for the Good of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> than he does of our Interests <HI>Abroad</HI>. For then, instead of examining calmly, how far the Friendship of other Countries would at this present be useful to us, he falls into passionate Expressions of Kindness for the <HI>Hollanders</HI>; as if our principal Design, in seeking <HI>Foreign Alliances</HI>, ought not to be the Encrease of our Wealth and Power, but the Finding out Humours in another Nation that please us, and the being civil to those with whom we have been longest ”acquainted.</Q>
And, Page 6, he observes upon the Author's Argument, <HI>That we ought to keep Friends with the</HI> Dutch, <HI>because they are Traders</HI>, that it is in plain <HI>English</HI> no more than
<Q>“Because we love Trade therefore we love Those that take it from ”us.</Q>
And goes on thus:
<Q>“Had the Author been a <HI>Lover</HI> instead of a <HI>Politician</HI>, he would have known that Rivals are the Things in this World which Men do and ”ought most to hate.</Q>
And that,
<Q>“It were certainly better for us if no People in the ”World traded by Sea but Ourselves.</Q>

Page 15, He ob∣serves how careful <HI>France</HI> was, that no Na∣tion should <HI>thrive</HI> by <HI>them</HI>, out of a Book published in 1663, by Mr. <HI>Samuel Fortrey</HI>, one of the Gentlemen of his Majesty's Privy Chamber, and dedicated to the King.

Nay, were they not to act more rigorously than the Law would authorise, the Law itself is thought too rigorous, and unreasonable, in that it often occasions the deplorable Ruin of an whole Family, by burying one insolvent Man alive, for a meer Trifle of a Debt, which is yet thereby further from being sa∣tisfied to the Creditor than before.</Q>
<P N="347">347. A <HI>Narrative</HI> of the <HI>Process</HI> against Madam <HI>Brinvilliers</HI>, and of her Condemna∣tion and Execution, for having Poisoned her Father and Two Brothers. Translated out of <HI>French</HI>. Printed for <HI>Jonathan Edwyn</HI>, &amp;c. (In 24 Pages) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1676</P>
<Q>This <HI>French</HI> Lady had been married a∣bout twenty-five Years to the Marquis of <HI>Brinvilliers</HI>; with whom, one <HI>St. Croix</HI> had got acquainted in the Army, for his In∣terest; being a Man more considerable for his Parts and his Person than his Birth or Fortune. This Acquaintance extended to the Lady, till it became criminal in them, and scandalous to the Family: Insomuch that her Father, the Sieur <HI>D'Aubray</HI>, had him ar∣rested, and sent to the <HI>Bastile</HI>, where he learnt, of an <HI>Italian</HI>, those strange Lessons, soon after put in Practice. For, upon his Release, this Gallant, and the Lady, re∣solving to revenge themselves for the Ob∣struction of their Pleasure, past, and prevent the like for the future, procured a Prepara∣tion,
<PB N="107" REF="107"/>
which she gave her Father in a Mess of Broth; whereof, after much Torment, he died in 1666. Then they got one <HI>La Chaussee</HI>, who had been Servant to St. <HI>Croix</HI>, into the Family of one of her Brothers, a Counsel∣lor; and when both the Brothers were at Dinner, with other Company, they all tasted of a fatal Pie, which, after about two or three Months painful Sufferings, carried them both off in 1670; and five others narrowly escaped the like untimely End at the same Meal. <HI>La'Chaussee</HI> had so cunningly avoided all <HI>Sus∣picion</HI> before the Deed, that his Master left him a Legacy of an Hundred Crowns. But now mark a Punishment, Extraordinary! of one of these Principals, by no human Hand! and which, at the same Time, makes a Discovery of the other Two, and brings them also to Punishment! <HI>St. Croix</HI> was so suffocated or infected with the Steam and Vapours of the Poysons he had so much dealt in, that, after he had bequeathed a Cabinet he had to that Lady in 1672, he died so suddenly, that all his Goods were sealed up by the Of∣ficers. Then <HI>La Chaussee</HI> and Madam <HI>Brin∣villiers</HI> are so <HI>infatuated</HI>, and make such <HI>sus∣picious Importunities</HI> for this Cabinet as were alone sufficient to make them thought Cri∣minal. But when this Infernal Cabinet, this <HI>Pandora</HI>'s Box was opened; there lay the Engagements to, and the Ingredients of this Destruction: There was her Promissory <HI>Note</HI>, to <HI>St. Croix</HI>, of <HI>Thirty Thousand</HI> Livres for his Reward; with her <HI>Letters</HI> to him: And there lay the Packets, Boxes, and Viols of those murdering Powders, Drugs, and Wa∣ters, which were employed upon this wicked Occasion. <HI>La Chaussee</HI> was seized, con∣demned, and, having made Confession, was racked to Death. The Lady, spurred by Fear and Guilt, fled to Foreign Countries; was a While at <HI>London</HI>, then in <HI>Germany</HI>; and was at last arrested at <HI>Liege</HI>. She would confess nothing at first, but, being threatened with the Torture, she made an open Confes∣sion and Repentance, and on the 17th of <HI>July</HI> walked bare-footed from the Prison in a Linnen Robe, with a Wax Taper in her Hand, to the Church Gate of <HI>Nostre Dame</HI>, where kneeling, she made her Confession; then, in a Cart, was carried to the <HI>Greve</HI>, the Place of Execution; where she at large recounted the remarkable Incidents of her Life, yet with a great Sense of the Wicked∣ness which brought her to this End; and, concluding with the usual Acts of Devotion, submitted her Neck to the Axe. Her Head, with her Body, was burnt, and their Ashes thrown in the Air.</Q>

<Q>The <HI>pleasant Author</HI> of this Pamphlet, though he approves, in his own Person, the late Act for <HI>Burying in Woollen</HI>; whereby that Manufacture would be encouraged, and vast Quantities of <HI>Linnen</HI>, heretofore idly wasted in the Earth, would be preserved for making of <HI>Paper:</HI> Yet he very naturally ex∣poses the obstinate Simplicity of the <HI>People</HI>, and the Tyranny of <HI>Custom</HI>, in the Conver∣sation of some glib-lip'd <HI>Gossips</HI>, over a Cordial Bowl of <HI>Burnt-Claret</HI>, against this Innovation. One grieves that ever she should think of <HI>living</HI> to see herself <HI>buried</HI> in such coarse and incommodious Stuff, and tenderly wishes, her <HI>Husband</HI>, who could not endure it neither, had <HI>died</HI> before the <HI>Act</HI>. Another is resolved to forfeit the Five Pound <HI>Penalty</HI>, rather than her's, who had always loved <HI>clean Linnen</HI>, should travel so far as into the other World, like a <HI>Beggar</HI>, without a <HI>Shirt</HI> to his <HI>Back:</HI> That the <HI>Worms</HI> themselves, who have not such <HI>sweet</HI> and <HI>cleanly</HI> Fare of us, will expect <HI>Table Linnen</HI> at their Meals; to which they had been so constantly used. Another has such a delicate Hide, that, if she don't wear <HI>Holland Smocks</HI> of twenty Shil∣lings an Ell, she fears <HI>Blistering</HI>; she can't <HI>sleep</HI> without fine <HI>Sheets</HI>, and should never lie <HI>quiet</HI> in her <HI>Grave</HI>; nay, rather than she'll be Tussed up in a frowzy stifling <HI>Flan∣nel</HI> Shift, she'll <HI>never Die at all, if she can help it</HI>. Another elderly Gentlewoman, for the Refreshment of her <HI>Memory</HI>, against <HI>Me∣lancholy</HI>, is resolved to be buried in her <HI>Wed∣ding Smocks</HI>; and she has seven of them, that shall ride <HI>one</HI> upon <HI>t'other</HI>. The last ex∣claims against it as downright <HI>Idolatry:</HI> That she'll as soon sacrifice her Children to <HI>Moloch</HI>, as suffer them to be swaddled up in such <HI>Welsh Abominations:</HI> That it is all a

<HI>Popish Device</HI>; a <HI>Jesuitical</HI> Trick, only to make us do <HI>Pennance</HI> after we are Dead. These affecting <HI>Arguments</HI>, and the <HI>Zeal</HI> they inspired, together with the aggravating Insi∣nuations of the <HI>Burnt Wine</HI>, so over∣powered their Spirits, and threw them into such a <HI>Maudlin</HI> Condition, that, between <HI>Weeping</HI> and <HI>Sleeping</HI>, they were forced to be led, <HI>reeling</HI> and <HI>staggering</HI>, under the Weight of their Oppressions, home to their respective Dwellings.</Q>

<Q>This Collection of more cruel and inhu∣man <HI>Murders</HI>, in that grand <HI>Massacre</HI> of the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>, than the most savage Brutes could have been guilty of, seems to be authentickly Extracted,

A Pleasant <HI>Battle</HI> between Two <HI>Lap-Dogs</HI> of the <HI>Utopian</HI> Court: Or, A <HI>Dialogue</HI> between Sleep and Awake, Jest and Earnest, Reality and Fancy: Being sought upon the new-erected <HI>Dog-Pit</HI>, lately contrived pur∣posely upon this Occasion, as aforesaid, in the Antichamber of the said Court; where it was sought with great Applause, Satisfaction, and Content of the Company there present: But by Reason of the Author's drowsy Disposition, being late at Night, and he inclined to Sleep; he would crave your favourable Censures of this his Pains, and judge of them as you find Oc∣casion. Printed for <HI>R. B.</HI> (In One Sheet) <HI>Folio</HI> 1681</P>
<Q>This <HI>Dialogue</HI> is between <HI>Nell Gwyn</HI>'s Lap-Dog <HI>Tutty</HI>; and <HI>Snapshort</HI>, the Dutchess of <HI>Portsmouth</HI>'s: And does probably allude to some real Fray between two of their Ser∣vants, or Gallants. <HI>Tutty</HI> upbraids t'other with her <HI>French</HI> Lady's Looking like one of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s lean Kine, and with such a sharp Countenance as if she would devour him, as she had almost devoured the Nation; and of her sending <HI>Guinea-Pies</HI> to her Country∣men. <HI>Snapshort</HI> says of the <HI>English</HI> Madam, That she hopes to see her Tail set up once more on a Dunghill; that she lately came from selling of Oranges and Lemons about the Streets; and now, being advanced to a Royal Bed, forgets her Mechanic Condition: That <HI>French</HI> Dogs, Ladies and Catholicks, will put the <HI>English</HI> Court all to a <HI>Nonplus:</HI> That it is not <HI>Ten-thousand</HI> Pounds a Year will protect her for ever; and that his Lady has taken a wiser Course, who has trans∣ported Forty times the Sum; and intends to follow it soon after herself. Good Riddance, says <HI>Tutty:</HI> When the Salt Bitches leave the Kingdom, it is more than probable the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI> Wolf Dogs will follow them; but he rather believes, the <HI>French</HI> Mistress is making Provision for the Reception of the <HI>French</HI> Monarch, than for her Departure to <HI>France</HI>; where he thinks she will be pelted like an Owl in an Ivy-bush. But <HI>Snapshort</HI> an∣swers, He mistakes the Case; for his Lady has Absolution and Dispensation from the Pope; and did not come into <HI>England</HI> barely to be a Whore, she came as a Spy, to betray the Kingdom's Interest. That <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> had a Brace of notorious
<PB N="109" REF="109"/>
Whores sent him for the same Purpose; but he had Sense to perceive their Intrigues, and prevent them. This so inrages <HI>Tutty</HI>, that he vows to seize his Antagonist by the Throat <HI>Snapshort</HI> strips off his Crucifix, and to it they go; snarling, barking, biting, and tearing one another; till the <HI>French</HI> Whore speaks, and calls out for fair Play: The <HI>English</HI> one answers, She knows <HI>Dog-fighting</HI> as well as her Ladyship, and <HI>Halloo's</HI> them both very fairly; offering to lay two to one, on <HI>Tutty</HI>'s Head: A <HI>Monsieur</HI> crys <HI>Done</HI>; but when it appeared that little <HI>Tutty</HI> got the Victory; he cried out, <HI>Pox take te Begar, me have lost near Tousand Pound</HI>.</Q>

<Q>Though some of these <HI>Speeches</HI> were printed before, yet, being in separate Sheets, they were here collected together, as the Author of the <HI>Preface</HI> says, for their better Preser∣vation, and that the then <HI>Present</HI>, as well as <HI>Future</HI>, might with Abhorrence behold the Iniquity of the past violent Times; when so many excellent Persons were de∣stroyed by <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Subtilties</HI> of Law; and <HI>Scribere est Agere</HI>, was brought in for Evi∣dence; as in the Case of Col. <HI>Sidney</HI>, when no other could be found. And whereas the Business of the <HI>Rye-House Plot</HI> had been re∣ceived by some, as an Article of Faith, and a smooth <HI>History</HI> of it imposed upon the Na∣tion; therefore the said Author thought good to add Colonel <HI>Rumbald</HI>'s Speech, to unde∣ceive the World; by which it is evident, says he, if we may believe the dying Words of a good Man, that it was a meer sham Contrivance, to bring an Odium upon the Protestants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet is Dedicated to the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, by the Author, <HI>Robert Crosfeild</HI>; who had, for some Time, zealously endeavoured to detect, and root out, some publick Corruptions. But it appears, that his Advertisements to the State, met with more Regard, than Reward: For he observes, that his Tract, entitled, <HI>Eng∣gland</HI>'s <HI>Glory Reviewed</HI>, which he published the preceding Session, had several Regulations proposed in it, which were now put in Practice, though he received not so much as Thanks for them. He had, amongst other Things, observed, that the greatest Part of the Charge and Trouble of <HI>Collecting the Land Tax</HI> might be saved, by laying the <HI>Re∣ceiver-Generals</HI> wholly aside; and had applied to the Council about it; but, the Matter be∣ing put off, he here revives the <HI>Proposal</HI>; shewing how, if he had been regarded, <HI>Fifty Thousand Pounds</HI> might have been saved that Year. He shews, also, the great Danger there was in <HI>Selling of Imployments</HI>; whereby Enemies to the Government, getting into Offices, communicated the Secrets of it to its Enemies. He also lays open the great Re∣missness of the State, in not regarding the <HI>Proposals</HI> of Mr. <HI>George Everett</HI>, an eminent Shipwright (published last Session) wherein he so evidently demonstrated, how he could save an <HI>Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year</HI>, by the Means offered in the said Tract, for <HI>building and repairing the Royal Navy</HI>, that here are produced the Names of above forty Persons of Honour, Quality, and Experi∣ence; Lords of the Admiralty, Aldermen and Merchants of <HI>London</HI>, and several Ship∣wrights; who, by their Certificates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have shewed their absolute Approbation thereof: And yet no Encouragement had He. (See another Proposal of his to the State; to Facilitate the <HI>Manning of our Fleets</HI>, in the 170th <HI>Article</HI> of this <HI>Catalogue</HI>.) Our Author then recounts how he had reflected (in a Book published the last Session) upon the mischievous Indolence of our Fleets, the two preceding Years; though they were of stronger Force than the Enemy. And, to his having laid that Matter open to the View of the World, ascribes the Sending of Ad∣miral <HI>Russel</HI> into the <HI>Streights</HI>, with such a Power, as saved an Ally from Ruin: Then recites his Proposal for laying aside the <HI>Press-Ketches</HI>, and for taking up the Sailors in the several Ports, by the Custom-House Officers. He also recites the Demonstration he had made of the Injuries which the Nation had received from the great <HI>Imbargoes laid upon Shipping</HI>;
<PB N="111" REF="111"/>
the Consequence of which was, that there had been none laid this Year: Insomuch that the Lords of the Admiralty had ordered no Press-Master should presume to meddle with any Sailors on Board of any Outward-bound Shipping. He likewise proposed an <HI>Act of Tunnage</HI>, for laying Sixpence <HI>per</HI> Tun upon all Coasters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is here repeated.</Q>

(In sixteen Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1695</P>
<Q>This Pamphlet is dedicated to both Houses of Parliament, also by <HI>Robert Crosfeild</HI>. And here he more expresly detects several Male-Practices; especially many Embezzlements of the <HI>Naval Stores</HI> in his Majesty's Yard at <HI>Portsmouth</HI>, and it is laid heavily upon Cap∣tain <HI>Wilshaw</HI>, one of the Commissioners of the Navy. And when Sir <HI>Richard Haddock</HI> was sollicited to encourage the Apprehension of some Persons who had, by sinister Means, obtained some of those Stores; he only, after near an Hour's Discourse upon it, an∣swered, <HI>That Kings and Princes were born to be cheated</HI>. But he acknowledges the Lords of the Admiralty gave all imaginable Encou∣ragement to those who made such Discove∣ries, as long as the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>, Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI>, and Sir <HI>Richard Onslow</HI> were in Commission; but, upon their leaving the Board, the Scene changed, and some Persons were turned out of their Employments for their Faithfulness to his Majesty's Interest and their Trusts. He next touches upon Mr. <HI>George Everett</HI>'s Proposal to save One-hundred thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>, in building and repairing the Royal Navy, which having produced a <HI>Report</HI> from the Navy Board to the Lords of the Privy-Council, signed <HI>R. Haddock, E. Dummer, C. Sergison, T. Wilshaw, D. Liddall, J. Hill, S. Pett</HI>, and <HI>G. St. Loe</HI>, their Lordships are here said to have looked upon it to be a scandalous One; and the said Mr. <HI>Everett</HI> delivered them a <HI>Memorial</HI> in Answer to it, which is here printed by our Author, who observes how the said Commissioners of the Navy preva∣ricated with Mr. <HI>Everett</HI>, by asserting, that the Whole Charge of building and repairing of the Navy did not amount annually to One-hundred thousand Pounds, when they knew, says he, that the Estimate given unto the House of Commons for the Wear and Tare of the Royal Navy, for this present Year, was Seven-hundred-eighty thousand Pounds. Then he proceeds to shew, That the <HI>Sailors</HI> being inhumanly and barbarously treated, is the only true Cause why they de∣cline the Publick Service: And, to this Pur∣pose, we have here a Letter written by Mr. <HI>John Trevor</HI> to the Lords of the Admiralty, laying open the Frauds used in the Payment of Seamens <HI>Tickets</HI>; also by <HI>Queries</HI> and <HI>Runs</HI>, and other Grievances; and towards the End there is a <HI>Petition</HI>, which the Author <HI>Robert Crosfeild</HI> had delivered to the House of Lords, complaining of the Commissioners for Sick and Wounded Seamen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their great Miscarriages here mentioned; also against the Lords of the Admiralty and Commissioners of the Navy for conniving at Frauds, supporting of Criminals, persecu∣ting their Discoverers, and turning just Men out of Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Examination thereupon of the said Author and one Mr. <HI>Baston</HI>, who had published a Detection of those Miscarriages, and did hereafter publish more thereof, as will in this Catalogue appear.</Q>

<P N="361">361. <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Calamities Discovered:</HI> With the proper <HI>Remedy</HI> to <HI>Restore</HI> her ancient <HI>Gran∣deur</HI> and <HI>Policy</HI>. Humbly presented by <HI>James Whiston</HI>. Printed for the Author, and Sold by <HI>Joseph Fox</HI>, &amp;c. (In 20 Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1696</P>
<Q>This Author here attempts to be a <HI>Re∣former</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>London</HI>, which is the grand Pattern of other Corporations, and chiefly in their pernicious Practice of <HI>Selling Offices</HI>, or <HI>Employments</HI>; to the great En∣couragement of Injustice, Extortion, and Oppression: Daily Complaints arising, through the excessive straining and advancing the exorbitant Fees of <HI>Counsellors, Attornies, Clerks</HI>, Serjeants, Gaolers, and other Of∣ficers in this City. He argues, that a Man who bestows his Time and Toil on a Busi∣ness, ought in Reason to make double as much <HI>per Annum</HI> of his Money, as in a lazy Annuity; so that a <HI>Serjeant</HI> for his Five-hundred Pounds seems to have a just Preten∣sion to get about One-hundred-fifty Pounds a Year; a round Income for a Man in his Post and Character. And how must he raise it at <HI>Half a Crown</HI> for every Arrest, of which his <HI>Yeoman</HI>, who gives about Two hundred Pounds for his Place, partakes One-third? So that, not arresting six Men every Day, one with another, to raise the Profits of his <HI>Purchase</HI> Money, he extorts <HI>Civility-Money</HI>, &amp;c. instead of Half-Crowns, half Pounds, and whole Pounds, besides several other Demands, too unreasonable for the Rich to suffer, but what throws the Poor often into inextricable Ruin. He in∣forms us a little farther, that the <HI>Keeper</HI>'s Place of <HI>Newgate</HI> was lately sold for Three-thousand five-hundred Pounds, and asks what an annual Income must the Fees a∣mount to, to satisfy that saucy Purchase, and all the subordinate Blood-suckers in that one Gaol? So he tells us also, that One-thousand five-hundred Pounds is paid for a <HI>City-Council</HI> or <HI>Attorney</HI>'s Place; as well as divers other Offices; which must raise near Five-hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>, from their miserable Clients, to ballance the excessive Price they pay for them. Here are many other Intimations of the most detestable Barbarity used by such as have bought themselves a Power over the Poor; inso∣much that the Common <HI>Hangman</HI>, encou∣raged by these Examples, will scarcely give a <HI>Malefactor</HI> a Cast of his <HI>Office</HI>, without a <HI>Bribe</HI>; very formally demanding his Fees, and <HI>Higgling</HI> too, as nicely with him, as if he was going to do him some mighty Fa∣vour. Towards the End, we have a <HI>Recital</HI> of the <HI>Act</HI> which was made <HI>Anno</HI> 5, 6, of <HI>Edward</HI> VI. Cap. xvi. <HI>Against the Sale of Offices</HI>. And in the Conclusion a <HI>Discourse</HI>, drawn from the Common Law, <HI>&amp;c. Upon the Duty of a Gaoler to his Prisoners, with his and other Officers Fees due by Law</HI>.</Q>

<Q>This Author was a Clerk in some Office, and he has very vigorously laid open the Mismanagements of many Persons who were too powerful for him to struggle with, par∣ticularly in a Pamphlet he published the last Year, entitled, <HI>Baston</HI>'s <HI>Case:</HI> Or, <HI>A Brief Account of the evil Practices of the Present</HI> Commissioners <HI>for</HI> Sick <HI>and</HI> Wounded; <HI>as they were proved before the Lords of the Admi∣ralty, Lords of the Council, and the Commissioners for Stating the Publick Accounts</HI>. And now a∣gain he is for further pointing out the Causers of our Misery in this Dialogue: Containing, 1. <HI>Bare Matter of Fact, against the Lords of the Admiralty, Commissioners of the Navy, Commissioners of the Post-Office, and Commis∣sioners of the Sick and Wounded Seamen; with the foul Practices of the Commissioners of the Publick Accounts, for Concealing and Justifying the said Crimes.</HI> 2. Natural <HI>Consequences</HI> and <HI>Arguments</HI> drawn from the said <HI>Matter of Fact</HI>, in Reference to <HI>Religion, Law, Po∣licy</HI>, and the True <HI>Interest</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI>. As soon as the Tract was out, it was seized by Messengers; Mr. <HI>Crosfeild</HI> (beforementioned) was committed to the <HI>Poultry Compter</HI>, and the Author into
<PB N="113" REF="113"/>
the Custody of a Messenger from the 26th of <HI>October</HI>, 1696, to the 29th of <HI>January</HI> following, and then was discharged upon giving a Recognizance of five-hundred Pounds, to appear the first Day of next Term at the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench</HI> Bar, to answer to this <HI>seditious and scandalous Libel</HI>, against his Ma∣jesty and Government, as it was stiled in the Warrant for his Commitment. He avers in his said <HI>Epistle Dedicatory</HI> to the <HI>Lords</HI>, that the Matters of Fact, related in this <HI>Dialogue</HI>, are no more than what are contained in a <HI>Petition</HI> and <HI>Articles</HI> exhibited by Mr. <HI>Cros∣feild</HI> aforesaid, and others; and only intreats their Lordships would prevent his Prosecu∣tion till his Witnesses were heard, and he had proved, by them, the Truth of his As∣sertions.</Q>
<P N="363">363. The <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Navy Considered</HI>, in Relation to the <HI>Victualling</HI>, particularly in the <HI>Straits</HI>, and the <HI>West Indies</HI>. With some Thoughts on the <HI>Mismanagements</HI> of the <HI>Admi∣ralty</HI>, for several Years past; and a <HI>Proposal</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> the like for the <HI>future</HI>.

(In 16 Pages) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1699</P>
<Q>This Tract was certainly written by a Man of Knowledge and Experience in this Subject, and it contains many important <HI>Ob∣servations</HI>, which may be applicable and useful in other Times than those which oc∣casioned them. He censures our Suffering the Escape of the <HI>Thoulon</HI> Fleet in <HI>Brest</HI>, very justly, lays open the miserable Case of the Sailors who are poisoned and starved with bad Provisions or Want of good, in a very lively Manner, and shews why so little Redress was had from the Parliament. What Profits the Victualling Office made in buying of Cattle at <HI>Smithfield</HI>; and how preposterous their Contracts with the Dealers to the Of∣fice were; particularly he informs us, that <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI>, the Hogman, got of them four or five-thousand Pounds by his Contract one Year of them; and the next Year was a Loser by them; and, when he complained of his Loss, the Commissioners procured him two thousand five-hundred Pounds out of the King's Pocket; so that, being burdened with Riches, he took Occa∣sion to hang himself. (<HI>Quere</HI>, Whether this is not the same Hogman that a late no∣ble Duke is said to have trundled about with him in his Chariot, till he had won all his Money of him; and whether this was not the Occasion that he hanged himself?) But our Author is perhaps as sharp upon the <HI>Admiralty</HI>, as any other Topick he touches upon, where he calls it,
<Q>“An Office, ma∣naged we know not how, nor to what Purpose; for I dare engage to pick out as many Old Women in <HI>Wapping</HI>, that should have managed that Affair more for the Honour, Glory, and Advantage of the ”<HI>English</HI> Nation.</Q>
And a little further, speaking of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s and <HI>Hiram</HI>'s Navy, observes,
<Q>“That the Scripture tells us, They were under the Conduct of <HI>Ship-Men that had Knowledge of the Sea</HI>; and, in another Place, that Part of this Lading was Apes and Peacocks; but tells us no where, that <HI>Apes</HI> or <HI>Peacocks</HI> had the So∣vereign Command in Sea Affairs; or that Land-men were proper Persons to com∣”mand Men of War.</Q>

<Q>There are some good Observations in this Pamphlet upon the Corruption, Partiality, and hereditary Monopoly of Seats in <HI>Parlia∣ment</HI>: And this Way of Election, by the <HI>Ballot</HI>, is proposed as the only Expedient to prevent those fatal Mischiefs of having the Rights and Liberties of the People betrayed, by those who are made the Guardians of them. He would propose the Examples of other States, as <HI>Venice</HI>, &amp;c. who are, by the Use of <HI>Ballotting</HI>, as free as possible from <HI>Factions, Animosities, Tumults</HI>, &amp;c. if we were apt to imitate other Nations in any thing but their Follies. But he observes it to have been practised also in Part amongst
<PB N="115" REF="115"/>
ourselves. It has been used in the <HI>House of Lords</HI>; also in several of the <HI>Publick Compa∣nies</HI>, and other <HI>Bodies Corporate</HI>; and shall the whole Body of the People neglect, or be diverted from the same Means; the most <HI>easy, just</HI>, and <HI>necessary</HI>, to get them such a <HI>free elected</HI> Body of <HI>Representatives</HI>, as will act to the Honour and Interest of the Na∣tion; be tender of their <HI>Privileges</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI>; and not burden them with un∣reasonable or unnecessary <HI>Impositions</HI>, to serve only their own private Ends, or particular Persons, rather than the Publick Good? In the latter End of his Pamphlet he gives us an exact <HI>Description</HI> of the <HI>Method of the Ballot</HI>, with a Sculpture representing the Form of the <HI>Balloting Box</HI>; containing two Boxes within it; that on the Right Side, for the <HI>Ayes</HI>; on the Left, for the <HI>Noes</HI>; as di∣rected by Inscriptions on the outward Box; into either of which, the Voter can, by an Hole towards the Top, between both, put his Hand, and drop his Roll or Pellet; and none of the Company be able to perceive into which Box he delivered it.

<Q>This Author undertakes to shew the Fals∣hood of the Assertion, That we were so ex∣hausted by Taxes to maintain our Wars, that Peace must be had upon the best Terms we could, for these Reasons; 1. Because, if that Doctrine were believed by the Enemy Abroad, it must make him still stiffer in his Terms. 2. The Belief of it at Home would make the People more impatient, if the Treaty were broke off. So proceeds to ex∣amine the Grounds of Complaint in the People under this Division of them—The landed Men; the Clergy; Merchants; Ma∣nufacturers; Shopkeepers, and Farmers. He concludes, with the Advantages which have been produced by the War and Taxes; and thinks,
<Q>“The benign Providence, which hath shewn us the Means of carrying on the War nine Years, with so little Grief and Oppression to the People, will not de∣sert us, if it be found necessary to continue it another Year. That our good <HI>Queen</HI> has <HI>no Views</HI>, but the Welfare of her Peo∣ple; nor any Ends to pursue, by continu∣ing the War unnecessarily: And, as God forbid the War should be continued a Month, if a safe and good Peace can be had now; so, on the other Hand, let not not the mistaken Notion, of Taxes be∣ing grievous, cause it to be concluded un∣”timely.</Q></Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet was written to expose the Arts and Practices of a certain petty Re∣tainer to the Court, who had no Employ∣ment himself, but was Partner for Life to one that had; and here called by the Name of <HI>Guzman</HI>, in Imitation of a famous <HI>Spanish</HI> Deceiver of that <HI>Name</HI>. He had, belike, heard of the Pranks played by <HI>Harry Killi∣grew, Fleetwood, Shepherd</HI>, and others be∣fore him, who had sold some Places that were never in Being, and disposed of others, good Pennyworths, before they were vacant: How the Privy-Garden at <HI>Whitehall</HI> was actually sold, and an Artist sent to measure the Ground. How one Man was made Curtain-lifter to King <HI>Charles</HI>; another, his Gold-finder; and his Oyster-cracker ano∣ther: So he, not able to recover some Em∣ployment he had been discarded from, em∣ployed his Wits to serve others; and, where he could not advance them in Reality, would do it in their Imagination; with prudent Regard to his own Interest; though, whoe∣ver he trafficked with, could not but own he sold at reasonable Rates; and was so modest, as to be content the Credit of Receiving the Present, or Purchase Money, should rest on the greatest Men in <HI>England</HI>, rather than himself. So proceeds to give several Exam∣ples of this Place—<HI>Jobber</HI>'s Dexterity among the rest; one of Selling, about two Months before, the Place of <HI>Vice-Chamberlain</HI>, to a Gentleman, who was to have given for it four-thousand Pounds to a Lady, who was Foster-Sister to the Queen. Two-thousand to the then Vice-Chamberlain, in Considera∣tion of his being turned out, and One-thou∣sand to be divided between Don <HI>Guzman</HI>, and his Agents. But, the Matter reaching the <HI>Vice-Chamberlain</HI>'s Ear, the Don and his A∣gents were examined before one of the Secre∣taries of State, where, after much Shuffling and Confusion, he owned the Fact, but, Abroad, reported himself to be Party injur∣ed, and went on with his Trade. For the Vice-Chamberlain, between Generosity and Contempt, seems to have dropped, at least, hitherto, the Prosecution; and the rest of the Court to have contented themselves, some with Laughing, and some with Lift∣ing up their Eyes in Admiration.</Q>

His Hope was, that the Place might easily be defended by Gar∣risons planted in the strait Neck of Land, by which it is joined to the rest of the Island. To every Footman he granted 120 Acres, and to every Horseman 240; which are as much as 500 <HI>English</HI> Acres: For which, they were to pay yearly a Penny an Acre.

<Q>Herein, this Sect set forth their Sufferings under the Severities of the Prelates and Chief Clergy, even to Exile, Imprisonment, Fetters, and violent Death itself; by the heavy Decrees they procured, for them to forswear and forsake their own Coun∣try, or else be slain therein; as that in <HI>April</HI>, 1903. But, that the Causes of their Injustice may appear, they have here pub∣lished this <HI>Confession of their Faith</HI>; and also to set forth the miserable State of their poor Countrymen, under the intolerable Yoke of their Popish Canons and Decrees; subject∣ing them, every Day they rise, to <HI>Thirty-eight</HI> Antichristian <HI>Ecclesiastical Officers</HI>; who are all named in the Margent, from the Archbishop to the Sexton; and stigmatizing them with the Titles of <HI>Donatists, Anabaptists, Brownists, Schismaticks</HI>, &amp;c. which they here doubt not but to clear themselves of; pro∣testing, they always accounted it unlawful to separate from any true Church of Christ, till, by their Iniquities, they cease to be a true visible Church: But for this our re∣nowned Church of <HI>England</HI>, that they have, both by Word and Writing, proved it to be false and counterfeit; so refer to their <HI>Conferences</HI> between certain Preachers and Prisoners, in <HI>March</HI>, 1590.

<Q>This Pamphlet very sensibly sets forth the Causes and Miseries of that destructive <HI>War</HI> then raised in <HI>France</HI> for above three Years past, by the Faction of the <HI>Guizards</HI>, which was called the <HI>Holy League</HI>; who when they saw the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> dead, the King to have no Children, and the King of <HI>Na∣varre</HI> Chief Prince of the Blood, through his Religion, as they thought, estranged from the People's Favour, they imagined the Way to be then open to their extream Ambition, and the Season fit for hatching their Drifts. Then they began afresh to to kindle their Practises and Conventicles, to search out all Malecontents, to treat with the King of <HI>Spain</HI>, and such other Poten∣tates as envied that Realm, whereof, in short Space, sprung forth this War of the <HI>League</HI>, which now had so consumed that State. Then they required the King to name his Heir, and the same to be a Ca∣tholic Prince, namely, the Cardinal of <HI>Bourbon</HI>, so to exclude the King of <HI>Navarre:</HI> Because they knew they could not climb so high but by Degrees, and might rule in <HI>France</HI> under the Cardinal's Wings; though he was very old, and that King in the Flower of his Age. The King of <HI>Na∣varre</HI> stopped their Passage, whereupon they declared him an Heretic, and so do still pre∣tend him to be deprived of all the Rights belonging to the Blood of <HI>France</HI>.

<Q>This Tract is dedicated in Verse, by the Author <HI>Sa. Rid.</HI> to the ingenious Gentle∣man, and his loving Father, Mr. <HI>William Bubb</HI>; which is followed by an Epistle of Mr. <HI>Bubb</HI>'s to his said loving Friend, and adopted Son; promising to cherish him fur∣ther in this his <HI>Discovery</HI>, by giving an <HI>Ad∣dition</HI> to his <HI>Second</HI> Treatise; but whether such second Treatise did come forth, we know not. There are some Tricks in this Tract taken out of <HI>Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft</HI>; and several others, which have been reprinted, and practised to this Day. He begins this Work with an Ac∣count of the <HI>Egyptians</HI>, or <HI>Gypsies</HI>; which, with the common <HI>Cantors</HI>, he had published some Discourse of before. He says, that cer∣tain <HI>Egyptians</HI>, being banished their Coun∣try, arrived in <HI>England</HI>, and began to ga∣ther to an Head about an Hundred Years ago, in the <HI>Southern</HI> Parts; and having many Slights and Devices, besides a Pretence to <HI>Palmistry</HI>, all clouded in their own Lan∣guage; which the <HI>English</HI> Leiterers, who joined them, soon learned, they became much admired and followed; and they couzened the Country People of Money, Silver Spoons, Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> very success∣fully. The first <HI>Englishman</HI> who took up their Trade, was <HI>Giles Hather</HI>; who, with his Trull <HI>Kate Callot</HI>, got a great Train after them in a short Space: He stiling him∣self the King, she the Queen of the <HI>Egyp∣tians</HI>; and they rode about the Countries uncontrolled. About forty or fifty Years after, their Couzenages growing most exor∣bitant, a Statute was made in the first and se∣cond of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI>, That whoever transported any <HI>Egyptians</HI> into this Realm, should forfeit Forty Pounds. And further, that whoever took on them the Name of <HI>Egyptians</HI>, or frequented the Company of those Vagrants, who so called themselves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should be adjudged Felons, without Be∣nefit of Clergy. Many Executions never∣theless ensued, which, at last, dispersed them, for they had been sometimes above Two-hundred in a Regiment. But they still kept up their yearly Meetings at the <HI>Devil's Arse in the Peak of Derbyshire</HI>, at <HI>Ketbrook</HI> by <HI>Black Heath</HI>, and elsewhere. Queen <HI>Elisabeth</HI> revived the Statute afore∣said, in the twentieth Year of her Reign. Still they keep wandering up and down to this Day, says our Author, with disco∣loured Faces, and Fashion of Attire like their Founders, tho' they daily decreased, by turning into other Professions, as Pedlars, Tinkers, Jugglers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>

<Q>“That as a Fool, persuaded by foolish Physicians, I abstained in vain, for the Space of Seven Years, from the Use of Wines; and then, in my frequent Travels and Embassies, when I was constrained to follow my So∣vereign Lord <HI>Caesar Maximilian</HI>, and sometimes through those Countries where the Waters were corrupt and contagious: But, at last, I became more wise, and ”found more Ease.</Q>

<Q>The Learned Author is said to have been, about this Time, one of the Masters of <HI>Chancery</HI>, and Judge of the <HI>Faculties</HI>, and <HI>Prerogative Court</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>; where he was held in great Esteem for his Knowledge of the Laws. He was afterwards, in the next Reign, the King's Advocate, and Knighted by him; was a great Rovalist, and Sufferer in the Cause, even of Wounds in Battle. He was also Author of other Works, in <HI>Latin</HI>; two of them upon <HI>Naval Affairs:</HI> And li∣ved to the latter End of the Year 1651. As for this Treatise, it is dedicated to King <HI>James</HI>; and the Drift of it is to shew how poor and sadly supplied the Churches were in <HI>Ireland</HI>. He imputes the sole Cause of their Misery to the Multitude of Benefices long since taken from the daily Ministers of the Churches, and converted to other Uses, but principally to the Luxury of the Monks. For there was an Age when the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> seemed to consist only in building of <HI>Monasteries</HI>, and bestowing large Revenues upon them, which, as they were at first bur∣densome to the Temporal State, so they grew baneful to the Churches, by reason of the Mul∣titude of Livings they procured to be appro∣priated to their Uses. Insomuch that, as our Author observed, out of an old <HI>Leiger-Book</HI> of the Abbey of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>, in <HI>Bermingham</HI>'s Tower in <HI>Dublin</HI>▪ a House of no very old Foundation, within few Years after it was erected, it had procured <HI>Fifty-nine Church-Livings</HI>, in Part, or in Whole, to be ap∣propriated to its Use. And these <HI>Monaste∣ries</HI> corrupted, by their Example, many <HI>Chantries, Colledges, Hospitals</HI>, and <HI>Nunne∣ries</HI>, to do the like. Whence Barbarism, Ignorance, and Superstition, so much pre∣vailed, and few Churches were to be found, served by other than poor Vicars and stipen∣dary <HI>Curates</HI>, and those chiefly Men of such coarse Qualifications as one can hardly say, Whether They are less worthy of better Maintenance, or such Maintenance of better Men.</Q>

<Q>It may be found that this Pamphlet was printed in the Year 1661, by that Expressi∣on of the Author's, P. 6, where he says,
<Q>“This famous Wind happened on <HI>February</HI> 18; some Days before which, deceased that most noble Royal Lady, the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> his Majesties onely Aunt, who had for so many Years been absent from this Kingdom, and was driven and tossed through a Sea of Troubles; so that it may be thought these Winds gave Notice that ”she was gone to her Rest.</Q>
Several fatal Accidents, occasioned by this Storm, in Town and Country, are here related; parti∣cularly of Mr. <HI>Blith</HI>, a <HI>Licolnshire</HI> Attorney, who, though advised not to pass by a totter∣ing House in <HI>Pickadilly</HI>, could not avoid it; so was buried in its Ruins. And the Lady <HI>Saltenstone</HI>, as her Maid was dressing her in her Lodgings near the <HI>Fleece</HI> Tavern in <HI>Co∣vent-Garden</HI>, was bruised to Death with the Fall of a Chimney. The <HI>Thames</HI> flowed not in sixteen Hours together, nor was there the least Sign of any Alteration in the Tide; so that the River was fordable in many Places; just as it happened before the Death of <HI>Oliver</HI>. In the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> his Park in <HI>Hertfordshire</HI>, no less than 500 Trees were blown down, and it did the like Mischief in many other Places, as <HI>Lincoln</HI>'s-<HI>Inn</HI> Walks, <HI>Moorfields, &amp;c.</HI> At <HI>Weston</HI> in <HI>Cambridge∣shire</HI>, it blew a Man off from a Barn up into the Air, and, after having twirled and spun him about some Time, set him down light∣ly upon the Ground. It blew Sollicitor <HI>Cook</HI>'s Head off from <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI>, and it might have been lost in the <HI>Thames</HI>, but it was carefully recovered, and staked up a∣gain in the same Place. Much Damage it also did by Sea as well as by Land, and in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> as well as in <HI>England</HI>.</Q>

<Q><PB N="130" REF="130"/>This Pamphlet is written against the strange and whimsical Fashion, which pre∣vailed amongst the Ladies at that Time, of adorning, or disguising their Faces with Abundance of black <HI>Patches</HI>, cut into various Forms and Figures. The Author dedicates his Work, To the young La∣dies and Gentlewomen of the Society of <HI>Black spotted Faces</HI>, newly taken into the Fellowship of the Company of <HI>Painter Stainers</HI>, &amp;c. But he has said Nothing, from all his Fathers and Philosophers, that would be more likely to discountenance and deter these phantastical Affectations, than that Story in Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby</HI>; who informs us, that, soon after this <HI>Fashion</HI> of <HI>Patching</HI> appeared at Court, a Lady with Child, was so deeply moved at the Sight of one of those new-spotted Faces, that she was delivered of a Daughter, whose Face was naturally so spotted, or marked over with black Patches. But the Females were now grown to be significant in the Shapes of them, as appears here in one of the Poems before this Pam∣phlet, where the Poet says,
<Q><L>And yet the Figures Emblematick are,</L>

<Q>Here it appears, that one <HI>Rose Cullender</HI> and <HI>Amy Duny</HI>, two poor old Widows of <HI>Leystoff</HI> in the County aforesaid, were in∣dicted for bewitching some Girls and a Youth, named <HI>Elizabeth, Anne</HI>, and <HI>Wil∣liam Durent, Jane Bocking, Susan Chandler, Elizabeth</HI> and <HI>Deborah Pacey</HI>, who were all subject to violent Fits; occasioned, as the Evidence sets forth, by those reputed Witches, who being thereby Convicted, and the Judge having acquainted the Jury, they had only two Things to enquire after, <HI>First</HI>, Whether these Children were bewitched? <HI>Secondly</HI>, Whether the Prisoners were Guilty of it? They, within Half an Hour, brought in their Verdict, <HI>both Guilty</HI>. And this was on <HI>Tuesday</HI> in the Afternoon, <HI>March</HI> 13, 1662, as the Date is printed at the End of the Trial: And the said Women were executed on <HI>Monday</HI> the seventeenth of <HI>March</HI> following; but they confessed Nothing. In short, it is a strange Trial for a Man of Judge <HI>Hales</HI>'s reputed Knowledge and Wis∣dom, to have pronounced Sentence in. Most of the foolish Tales, by Nurses and ignorant Gossips ascribed to Witches, are here used as Evidence against those two poor Women; as the Catching of a Toad in a Blanket, and Burning it in the Fire; and <HI>Amy Duny</HI>'s Appearing next Day all lamentably scorched in her Face, Legs and Thighs: Just like the Cat in one of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Poems, which having had one of its Legs cut off, it proved, next Day, to be an old Woman's Arm, as a <HI>Lancaster</HI> Grand Jury, says he, will re∣port. Then there were some Quantities of crooked Pins produced, and attested to be vomited up by those Girls, in their Fits; and a Two-penny Nail, that was thrust into one of their Mouths, by a Bee! with several other such Absurdities; besides the filthy Search and Discovery of several Teats, or Excrescences like them, upon <HI>Rose Cullender</HI>, at which she was supposed to suckle her Imps. Serjeant <HI>Keeling</HI> seemed very ratio∣nally unsatisfied with all this Stuff; and the Draughtsman of this Trial, did very well not to publish the Opinions herein by him ascribed to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI>, about Witch∣craft, before that learned Man was secure from Contradicting them, he being newly dead, or dying, just as this Pamphlet was published; which was six Years after the Death of Sir <HI>Matthew Hale</HI>. There was an Experiment made, P. 45, upon which the Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI>, Sir <HI>Edmund Bacon</HI>, and Serjeant <HI>Keeling</HI>, openly protested, that they did believe the whole Transaction of this Business was a mere Imposture. This put the Court and all Persons into a Stand; till the Credulity or Prejudice of the Witnesses over-ruled, and the <HI>Condemnation</HI> passed as aforesaid; and then, it was affirmed that the Children were perfectly restored from their Fits, to their Speech and Health.</Q>

In an unhappy Hour he espoused fair <HI>Blanch</HI> of <HI>Bourbon</HI>, whose Life he shortened by Poison in the Prison of <HI>Medina Sidonia</HI>, and her Body was afterwards taken up by the <HI>French</HI>; who, on this Occasion, entered into <HI>Castile</HI> on the Behalf of Don <HI>Henry</HI>, and so was buried at <HI>Tudela</HI> in <HI>Navarre</HI>. &amp;c.</Q>

<Q>This smart Bantering Letter was written upon the Breach between the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Venetians</HI>; who had pulled out of his Hand his Temporal Sword, and so dulled and blunted the other, that henceforth it should not cut but in Measure and Reason; ad∣vising him to suffer them to bear a large Pair of Shears in their Arms, to witness to Posterity, that they were the first amongst his faithful Massmongers, who durst curtail and clip his Garment, which daggled too long on the Ground. After having also shown how the Pope's Power stood with Regard to other Princes of <HI>Europe</HI>, he con∣cludes, with advising him to renounce all Superiority over the King of <HI>England</HI>, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had done to those of <HI>Holland</HI>; for which his Majesty might be induced to make him a great Present, of all the Priests and Jesuites in his Country. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>

<Q>That <HI>Lambert</HI>, whose Head was turned with Enthusiastical Conceits, that the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> would raise him to great Prefer∣ment, pretended to have it suggested to him by a Spirit, that this Mr. <HI>Scott</HI> was an Ob∣structor of the same, and would be, till he was killed: So he laid wait for him, in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church-yard in <HI>Utricht</HI>; and while he was there, coming to preach, it being on <HI>Sunday</HI> in the Afternoon, accompanied by his Brother, Mr. <HI>W.

Scott</HI>, the said <HI>Lambert</HI> stab∣bed him in the Belly with his Sword, where∣of he died in about an Hour after, and was there buried on the <HI>Wednesday</HI> following, very honourably attended to his Grave; the like Train having not been seen in <HI>Utricht</HI>, on such an Occasion, or a more general La∣mentation for the Loss of so worthy a Man. The Malefactor was whipp'd and rack'd; had his Right-hand cut off, and nailed to the Gallows; then he was hanged, and his dead Body was sentenced to be laid upon a Wheel without any Burial. What makes it the more probable that this was the same <HI>T. Scott</HI> who was the Author of so many notable Pamphlets against the <HI>Pope</HI>, and <HI>Spaniards</HI>, and in Behalf of the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI>, is, a Character which is given of him in one of the Elegies here subjoined, as follows:

The Oc∣casion of his writing this Pamphlet, as we gather from his Preface, was, the Sight of a <HI>Copper Print</HI> which had been newly set forth; wherein was engraved, in the Com∣pass of two Sheets of Paper, a spacious Olive Tree, growing out of the Side of <HI>Ignatius Loyola</HI>, the Founder of the Jesuites, as he lies sleeping, with certain Books under his Head, inscribed <HI>Obedientia</HI>; and a Paper in his right Hand containing some <HI>Latin</HI> Words, signifying, <HI>I am like a fruitful Olive Tree in the House of God</HI>. That Tree has as many Branches, as there are Provinces in which the Jesuites have any Religious Houses; and the Name of the Province is at the Foot of the Branch; which bears as many Leaves as there are Colledges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in that Province; on which Leaves are the Names of the Towns, Cities, and Villages inscribed, where those Religious Houses are. And round about the Tree are the Portraits of all the most illustrious Men of their Or∣der, as <HI>Toletus, Bellarmine, Campian</HI>, and his Fellows, the <HI>English</HI> Jesuits who were executed for Treason; and many more, of the like Merit: Which coming into our Author's Hands produced the Tract afore∣said.</Q>

<Q>This Tract is dedicated by the Author to <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Dorset</HI>, Lord Chamberlain to the Queen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Treatise itself, to Sir <HI>Theodore Mayerne</HI>, Chief Physitian to the King; who had desired the Doctor to publish an Account, with a Sculpture, of this strange Discovery. The young Man died at his Lodgings in St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s Parish, on the 6th of <HI>October</HI>, 1637; and the next Day was diffected at the Instance of his Aunt, the Lady <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, Wife of Sir <HI>Francis Herris</HI>, by Mr. <HI>Jacob Heydon</HI> a Sur∣geon, under the Direction of our Author, in Presence of Mrs. <HI>Dorothy Pennant</HI>, the Deceased's Mother, and many other Per∣sons. It was found that the young Man's Liver was grown to the Costall Mem∣branes; which Contraction was ascribed to his writing Profession: And, his Heart ap∣pearing on the left Side very hard and tu∣mid, they opened it, and took out this mon∣strous
<PB N="141" REF="141"/>
Worm or Serpent. The Whole was near Thirteen Inches long: It had an Head like a Snake; its Body strait; about an Inch round, and six Inches long; of a white Co∣lour, and very smooth: Then it divided into two Branches, of a Flesh Colour; the one, about two Inches and an Half long, the other, somewhat shorter: Which two Branches again divided, and terminated in five long, thin Fibers a-piece. It was thought to have been growing three Years; for so long the young Man had complained of a Pain in his Breast: And the Author had often noted an extraordinary Sharpness in his Eye, like the Eye of a Serpent, whence he argues from Friar <HI>Bacon</HI>, in his Book <HI>De Coelo et Mundo</HI>; and <HI>Alkindus</HI>, in his Treatise <HI>De Radiis</HI>, That all Things have their peculiar Emanations, and irradiate their specific <HI>Beams</HI> from their own Centre: And that inward Diseases may be discovered by such Signatures sent forth from their Cen∣tres, analogical to their Circumferences, by which we may find the Causes, if we be diligent and careful. <HI>John Stow</HI>, in his <HI>Chron. Anno</HI> 1586, mentions a strange Ani∣mal found in the Heart of an Horse, belong∣ing to Mr. <HI>Dorington</HI> of <HI>Spaldwick</HI> in <HI>Hun∣tingtonshire</HI>, somewhat parallel to this Case: But, for our Author's faithful Relation of that understanding and sincere Man, Mr. <HI>John Whistler</HI>, one of the Benchers of <HI>Graies Inn</HI>, and <HI>Recorder</HI> of <HI>Oxford</HI>; who, in his younger Days, being a great Cock-Master, and having an old fighting Cock that was worn out, he cut off his Head, which was no sooner done, but there shot out, between the Skins, another Head and Neck, like that of his Cock, with a very fine Skin up∣on it, with a Bill, and a little Comb; but he conceived it to be a Kind of Gelly: As for this Story, I say, if one of the Benchers of <HI>Grays-Inn</HI> did affirm it, we believe scarce another could be found who would believe it; and yet our Author believed it; for he endeavours to account for it, as being per∣haps bred of some Egg in the Body of the Cock; with other Arguments, but how probable, is left to the Consideration of his Brother <HI>Doctors</HI> in <HI>Philosophy</HI>.</Q>

<Q>These Grievances were published upon the new Orders and Stirs that the Arch∣bishop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and Bishop <HI>Wren</HI>, in his Book of <HI>Articles</HI>, had made about the <HI>Service Book</HI>; here charged with many <HI>Po∣pish</HI> and absurd Errors, relating to the Pub∣lick Worship of God; which made many refrain from going to Church, till the said Service was all read; as the Author of this Pamphlet, who signs himself at the End, <HI>Lewis Hughes</HI>, does assert. Towards the Conclusion, he gives us the Particulars of some dreadful Judgments which had fallen upon Churches ever since the said <HI>Service Book</HI> was first Established by <HI>Act of</HI> Parlia∣ment, and especially since the <HI>New Orders</HI> concerning the same were made: More e∣specially the Accident that befell the Parish Church of <HI>Withycomb</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI>, so much torn and defaced by Thunder and Light∣ning, on the 21st of <HI>October</HI>, 1638; as may be seen more at large in the Pamphlets pub∣lished upon that Occasion: And that no less fearful, tho' less hurtful Storm of Thunder and Lightning, which maimed many of the Congregation for a While, in the Parish Church of <HI>Anthony</HI> in <HI>Cornwall</HI>, that pre∣sent Year 1640. Upon which our Author begs for a Reformation of what was amiss in the Publick Worship of God, before his Wrath be kindled, and come forth as a consuming Fire upon the whole Land.</Q>

<Q>This little <HI>Archibald</HI>, the King's <HI>Scotch</HI> Jester, had often provoked Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI>, who being now safe from hurting him, in the <HI>Tower, Archee</HI> published this Pamphlet. There is a Wooden Print in the Front of it, representing the Archbishop in Bed with a cloven Foot at the Bed-side, a great Sword in the Window, and <HI>Archee</HI> standing by. Wherefore he was exiled from Court: He says few Men were ignorant, and the Cause is here said to be this—A Nobleman asking

him what he would do with his handsome Daughters; he replied, <HI>he very well knew what to do with them, but he had Sons, which he knew not well what to do with: He would gladly make Schollars of them; but that he feared the Archbishop would cut off their Ears.</HI> In his Dream, after he had been in Heaven, and seen a Parson present a Petition against Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI>; he descends to Hell, and sees <HI>Bonner</HI> and <HI>Wolsey</HI> dancing a Galliard, with the Furies for their Female Partners, behind whom was an empty Chair, which they said was for <HI>Laud</HI>, against whom ma∣ny Bills were preferred to <HI>Rhadamant</HI>, who pronounced his Doom, and he was bound Hand and Foot and thrown into <HI>Caron</HI>'s Boat, at which <HI>Pluto</HI>'s Followers made such a Noise, that it waked our Dreamer; who, going to a noble Friend, heard that <HI>Canter∣terbury</HI> was carried to the <HI>Tower</HI>.

<Q>This Sir <HI>Sackvile Crow</HI>, Baronet, had been Eight Years Ambassador at <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI>, and so long chosen by the <HI>Turky</HI> Com∣pany of Merchants to negotiate their Affairs there; for which they allowed him Two Thousand Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>.

<Q>In this Pamphlet there is a lively Display of the Pope's Intreagues to increase the Va∣riance between the King, Lords, and Com∣mons of <HI>England</HI>. And here are the Nego∣tiations displayed of some of our <HI>Popish</HI> Cour∣tiers to that Purpose. Particularly it is set forth in Page 13, How much the Entrance of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> into the solemn <HI>League</HI> and <HI>Covenant</HI> alarmed the <HI>Roman</HI> Faction; and, as Mr. <HI>Hinderson</HI> foretold, made the very Pope and Conclave of Car∣dinals amazed and tremble; insomuch that they doubled their Diligence to work the Destruction of the <HI>Covenanteers</HI>. The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> was sollicited, by Sir <HI>Kenelm Digbie</HI>'s Means, who was then the Queen's Agent for the <HI>English</HI> Affairs at <HI>Rome</HI>, to help the King of <HI>England</HI> with an Army, against the <HI>Covenanteers</HI> in <HI>England</HI>. Fur∣ther, that the said Sir <HI>Kenelm</HI> was the Pope's Right-hand to promote and further all De∣signs against that Party in <HI>England</HI>. At the same Time a Nuncio was sent from the Pope's Court into <HI>Ireland</HI>, there to make Cessation with the Protestants, and to fur∣ther, by all Means possible, the King of <HI>England</HI> against the Covenanteers; which was concluded with the Pope's good Liking, as hath been confessed. And Page 28, there are Reasons laid down, why it was much credited by many rational Men, that Sir <HI>Kenelm Digby</HI>, and the Party which came with him from <HI>Rome</HI> into <HI>England</HI>, about the Time of throwing down the Lords, and cutting off the King, framed the <HI>Engagement</HI> against the Protestants, and Covenanteers Party, as also to ruin the Parliament and Army.</Q>

<Q>This Treatise, which does, in many Parts, deserve to be taken good Notice of, is in∣scribed to the supream Authority of the Na∣tion, the Parliament of <HI>England</HI>, by the Author, <HI>Silvanus Taylor</HI>; who had been of the <HI>High Court of Justice</HI>, and a Commis∣sioner for <HI>Herefordshire</HI>, and certain Counties in <HI>Wales</HI>, for ejecting of scandalous, igno∣rant, and insufficient Ministers, and School-masters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is divided into Ten Secti∣ons, and at the End, is an <HI>Appendix</HI>, shew∣ing <HI>The Chief Cause of Wandring Poor in England, and the Remedies thereof</HI>. This Cause he ascribes not only to so much waste Ground as our <HI>Commons</HI>, &amp;c. consist of, but to the immoderate and unnecessary Number of <HI>Alehouses</HI> throughout the Kingdom; which he calls the Two Great <HI>Nurseries</HI> of <HI>Idleness</HI> and <HI>Beggary</HI>. He says, that, even in the Year 1646, it was computed that there were not less than 6000 Alehouses within the Bills of Mortality; and he computes himself, that there were at least an Hundred Thousand in <HI>England</HI>; the Waste, or su∣perfluous
<PB N="144" REF="144"/>
Consumption of Drink in which, and what tends to so much Drunkenness and Poverty, he computes at <HI>Fifty Thousand Pounds a Week</HI>, which is, <HI>Twenty Six Hun∣dred Thousand Pounds a Year</HI>. He lays it down at the Beginning, that this Waste a∣mounts to more yearly, than any Assessment for one Year, within Ten Years past; and yet the moderate Use of the Creature, whe∣ther Respect be had to Necessity or Delight, is not brought into this Accompt. As to the Remedies; he would have many Thou∣sands of <HI>Alehouses suppressed</HI>, and the Re∣mainder to be all Licenced, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A Second Remedy, he proposes, should be the <HI>In∣closing</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI>; that so there may be no Room left for Idleness; and that all <HI>Cot∣tages</HI> may have such a competent Measure of Land laid to their Cottages, as may in∣vite their Children to Labour. His Third Remedy is, the <HI>Erecting</HI> of <HI>Workhouses</HI> and the Setting up such Manufactories as may also invite to Labour, not by Force, unless it be of such as would be resolutely idle; Man's Nature being more easily <HI>drawn</HI>, than <HI>driven</HI>.</Q>

<Q>This Tract contains a <HI>Report</HI> from the <HI>Committee</HI>, to whom the Examination of <HI>James Nayler</HI>, Blasphemer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was re∣ferred.

The like Notes there are upon the Debates and Resolutions of the House of Commons upon that Report, as also upon their Sentence, and the Punishment of him. After these, the said Editor has pub∣lished Copies of several of the <HI>Papers</HI> given into the House of Parliament in the Time of <HI>James Nayler</HI>'s Tryal and Sufferings, which began the 5th of <HI>December</HI>, the Year before that in which this Pamphlet was printed.

<Q>Those two Letters may have been intend∣ed to signify that Lord Mayor who had applied himself to the Law in <HI>Grays-Inn</HI>, before he was a Trader in the City; and the rather, because he is here more particularly spoken of than was in this Case necessary, and much the like Aspersion is returned upon <HI>William Penn</HI>'s Father, as the said <HI>William</HI> had cast upon that Lord Mayor, when he said of him, That <HI>One Renegado is worse than Three Turks</HI>; in Allusion to his Fierceness against Dissenters now in King <HI>Charles</HI> his Reign, after his eager Prosecution of the Royal Party under <HI>Cromwell</HI>. To which it is here answered, That <HI>William Penn</HI> mis∣takes when he charges these Things upon the late Lord Mayor; and that he means his own <HI>Seir</HI> deceased; who, from a Captain, was made <HI>Oliver</HI>'s High Admiral, for his great Service in promoting that new Instru∣ment; who afterwards did eminent Service at <HI>Hispaniola</HI>, when he delivered up the Flower of the <HI>English</HI> Soldiers a Sacrifice to the Cow-Killers. This was a <HI>Renegado worse than Three Turks</HI>; that performed such excellent Service in the late <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars, in plundering the two <HI>East-India Dutch</HI> Ships of the Prize Goods, for which he was turned out of the House of Commons: It is hoped, that he leaving so great an Estate of —just-gotten Goods to so conscientious a Son as this <HI>William Penn</HI> pretends himself to be, that the tender-conscienced Youth will make Satisfaction to his Majesty.—As for the <HI>Verdict</HI> of the <HI>Jury</HI> abovementioned; the Contrariety pretended therein was this, They brought in their Verdict twice, That <HI>William Penn was guilty of Speaking in Graci∣ous Street</HI>; but this not satisfying the Court,

<Q>“One <HI>Mitchell</HI> being put in Prison, upon great Suspicion of his having attempted to murder the late Archbishop of St. <HI>Andrews</HI>, and there being no Evidence against him, Warrant was given by the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>, then your Majesty's Commissioner, and your Council, to promise him his Life, if he would confess: Whereupon he did confess; and yet some Years after, that Person, who indeed deserved many Deaths, if there had been any other Evidence a∣gainst him, was, upon that Confession, convicted of the Crime; and the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> and his Brother, being put to it by him, did swear, That they never gave or knew of any Assurance of Life given him: And when it was objected, That the Promise was upon Record in the Council-Books, the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> did, in open Court, where he was present only as a Witness, and so ought to have been silent, threaten them, if they should proceed to the Examination of that Act of Council; which, as he then said, might infer Perjury on them that swore: And so did cut off the Proof of that Defence, which had been admitted by the Court, as good in Law, and sufficient to save the Prisoner, if proved. Thus was that Man hanged upon that Confession only, though the Promise, that drew it from him, doth appear upon Record, and can be proved by ”good and clear Evidence.</Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet is dedicated to <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>, by <HI>J. Lacy</HI>, who collected it from the scattered Papers which had been long preserved in his Grace's Family. He seems also to have been related thereto, by some of the Marriages he mentions. But had he been a Stranger, and in no Wise de∣pendant, he might have given us, from those Papers, a more accurate Account of that Tryal, by which the Duke suffered Death in 1572, than does here appear. In the Con∣clusion of this Tryal, our Author has these Words:—
<Q>“Thus fell that illustrious Prince, whose Greatness in Estate and Title was his only Crime; for, being of an ancient and splendid Family; the Blood-Royal of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> not being out of his Veins; and being allied to all the conside∣rable Families of <HI>England</HI>; and having an Estate to support that Greatness, of <HI>an hun∣dred Thousand Pounds a Year</HI>; besides the Fortunes he obtained by his Marriages, which were also very large; all his Pater∣nal Estate was disposed of by the Queen, without Regard to the Innocence of his Children, the hard Measure of his Accusa∣tions, and his Obedience, which led him to the Pursuit of her Commands upon all Occurrences: Which Estate, as it is divi∣ded and improved, is valued at <HI>Five-hun∣dred Thousand Pounds a Year</HI>. My Lord of <HI>Leicester</HI>, who was the leading Man at that Time, and sat with watchful Diligence, at the Helm, which he managed, as his In∣terest or Passion inspired him, first propo∣sed the Marriage of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; which he refused, till
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
importuned by the Persuasions of those that appeared to be his Friends; and assured by a Letter under Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s own Hand of her Consent; all which ensnared him, till the Consummation of the Mar∣riage; which was made evident by a Letter kept long in the Family, from the Hands of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>; in which she sub∣scribed herself, <HI>Your most obedient Wife</HI> Mary <HI>of</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> Norfolk. And this great Family, thus eclipsed, remained under the Cloud of a severe Deprivation, till the last King <HI>Charles</HI>, of Blessed Memory, resto∣red them to their former Titles and Dig∣nities: That excellent Prince considered their long and silent Sufferings, with what Forwardness most of them engaged their Lives and Fortunes in the Service of his Royal Father; there being but two of all that great and numerous Family, that drew a Sword against their King: May those two be buried in the dull Ashes of Oblivion for ever, and wiped out of our Way, as ”perhaps they are out of the Book of Life.</Q></Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet was drawn up by no in∣considerable Hand. There are many free and wholsome Observations in it, upon the late Misgovernment of <HI>Scotland</HI>, and Cha∣racters of those Ministers who were employ∣ed in it; which would give some clear Light into that Part of History, were their Names drawn out, as they might be, of the Twilight of their initial Letters, into the open Sun∣shine of Words at Length; as the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s is, whose general Character, here makes a glaring Figure, for the Mis∣chiefs he did, while he was Secretary in that Kingdom. In Page 41, The Author has this Political Reflection:—
<Q>“Having now dispatched all that is either Historical, or Argumentative, about the several Heads in Difference between the Parliament of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>, and a few unadvised, or ill-designing Men about his Majesty: I shall shut up this Discourse with some Political Reflec∣tions upon the Whole. Whereof the first is, That it is not the having barely a <HI>Good King</HI>, that renders a People happy; but much of it must arise from his having <HI>Good Ministers</HI> about him. For no Nation had ever a better Prince than we at present have; and yet we find there is Cause of Complaint, by Reason of the ill Counsel∣lors that possess his Ear. We do not think, that he entertains them out of Choice; yet that will not give his People
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
Ease, though it may for a While suppress their Murmurings. His Majesty being so little acquainted with Men at his first Co∣ming over, might lay him open to be mis∣led in the Choice of his Officers; but to continue to use them, after he hath had sufficient Means, as well as Opportunity of knowing their Characters, will leave an Imputation not only upon his Goodness, but upon his Wisdom. For as the People have no other Way of judging of the Good∣ness of their Prince, but by finding his Officers and chief Ministers to be such: So if these be not, they may possibly acknow∣ledge <HI>William</HI> to be a good Man, but they never will believe the <HI>King</HI> is so. And <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s Observation, That <HI>a wise King will always find wise Ministers</HI>, is no more than what every Man is persuaded of upon the first Principles of Reason and of Com∣mon Sense. I do acknowledge, that ill Men have Ways of Thrusting themselves upon Princes, which they that are vertuous think too unworthy, and below them to use. For whereas the latter are always modest, and seek no Recommendations but from their own Merit; the former are importunate, and can both flatter and bribe Favourites to speak well of them. It was a severe Prediction, as well as Observation; which the late Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> made upon the News of King <HI>Charles the Second</HI>'s Death, and of his <HI>Brother</HI>'s Succeeding him, <HI>That he was like to be well served, through having none about him, but his own Fools, and his Predecessors Knaves</HI>. How may wise Men then imagine his present Majesty is like to be served, who, though he hath not the Fools of the last Reign about him, yet He hath both the Knaves of That, and ”of the Former! <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></Q>

(In 24 Pages) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1699</P>
<Q>This Pamphlet was written against the Dissenters; whose Manner of Worship Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI> had preached against in that Sermon, before the said Lord Mayor, though his Lordship himself was one of them. The last Paragraph in the Piece may give a Taste of it, which is as follows:—
<Q>“I shall con∣clude this extemporary <HI>Answer</HI> to a pre∣meditated <HI>Sermon</HI> against extemporary <HI>Prayer</HI>, with this one Reflexion: That the late Lord Mayor may well be abused in the Street, by Ballad-Singers, Hawkers, and raskally Fellows, when he was first abused to his Face in the Pulpit by a Pe∣dantick Parson. A noble Example, and as bravely followed! But if the City of <HI>London</HI> suffer their chief Magistrate, and the greatest of the Kind in the whole Nation, to be thus abused for Going to <HI>Meetings</HI>, which was neither contrary to the Laws of God nor Man, they do not acquit them∣selves according to their Character. It is utterly intolerable that a Gentlemen, who, his very Enemies must own, has acted the Part of a good Magistrate, should be so scandalously abused. If this be Mr. <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Deference to Dignities, it is a Pity he should ever preach in any other Place but <HI>Bedlam</HI>; where his Namesake <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Porter used to rave. And thus I leave the Huntsmen, who sounded the seven Strokes to the Field, to
<PB N="154" REF="154" MS="y"/>
sound the Stroke of Nine to draw Home the Company; for I believe their — will scarcely recover his Game; so that he may even sit down contented with the Honour of being the Ring-leader of those who sing such goodly Ballads, as <HI>they were gathering Grigs about the Streets one Day</HI>, and cry Lampoons ”against Magistrates another.</Q></Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet is dated from <HI>Berwick</HI>, the same Day and Year above-mentioned, and it was printed the same Year. It is divided into two Parts; the First is entitled, a <HI>True Report</HI>, &amp;c. as above: The Other, <HI>An Admonition to the Christian Reader</HI>. In the Title page, there is a wooden Print of that monstrous Child; and it is said at the End of the <HI>Report</HI>, That the Drawer of this Portrature was <HI>Raphe Cooke</HI> Paynter, dwel∣ling in <HI>Barwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweede</HI>. In the Re∣port, it appears, That Child was the Offspring of <HI>Elinor Urine</HI>, aged twenty-eight Years, by her Husband <HI>John Urine</HI>, Piper, aged Twenty-six. It was of the Male Sex, and shaped like two Children from the Shoulders upwards, only one Ear of each Head was shaped like an Horse's the other like an Hog's. The Body was larger than usual, the Arms reasonably proportionable, and the Legs and Feet as of other Children: It was still-born; but the Cause of its Defor∣mity is not accounted for, unless it were a Judgment on the Father, who having a goodly Daughter born to him two Years before, by the same Woman, and the Mid∣wife telling him, what a fine Child God had sent him; he angrily answered, If it were a Daughter, the Devil might take his Part, for it was none of his; so departed Murmuring, where he ought to have returned Thanks.</Q>

<Q>This Dialogue was composed by the afore∣said <HI>William Blandy</HI>. He dedicates it to the Noble, Vertuous Gentleman, Mr. <HI>Philipp Sidney</HI>. After his Dedication, follows a Letter by the said Author, before his Book was printed, to his Friend, Captain <HI>Edward Morris</HI>, requesting his Judgment of it; in which it appears also, that he was shortly after to go Abroad. This is followed with Captain <HI>Morris</HI>'s Answer to his loving Friend, <HI>William Blandy</HI>; who is described therein, to have been then but a young Man: For the Captain wishes, his Elders in Military Discipline, were disposed as he is, and fur∣nished with his Skill and Faculty: And af∣ter this, there is a Copy of Verses, on the Author, and his Work, by <HI>Lodowick Flood</HI>, (or <HI>Lloyd</HI>.) It appears in Fol. 18, that the Degrees in the Army were, in those Days, thus distinguished — The <HI>General; High Marshall</HI>, with his <HI>Provosts.

He mentions several also who were killed in that Expedi∣tion; as the valiant Captain <HI>Corne</HI>, whom he much applauds, wishing, <HI>The Queen had all the empty Barns and Houses in</HI> England <HI>full of such Corne:</HI> Besides Lieutenant <HI>Carie</HI>, who approved himself every Way descended of a noble Race, and the brave Master <HI>Browne</HI>, who had been a Student of <HI>Lincolns Inn</HI>, and likewise fell in that Engagement.

<Q>This famous Tract of Sir <HI>Thomas Smyth</HI>'s had afterwards several Editions, with some Alterations in the Title, Additions, and Marginal Notes. The Editor informs us, That he thought it a Part of his Duty, as well for Reviving of the Fame of so notable a Man, as for Imparting to the Publick so pithy a Treatise, to present the same to his Reader's Judgment. Wherein, although the Errors and Rashness of Scribes appearing in the Contrariety and Corruption of Copies, happening, both by the Length of Time, since the first Making, as also by the often Transcribing, might justly have been his Excuse, or rather Discouragement; yet weighing the Authority of the Author, to∣gether with the Gravity of the Matter, he made no Doubt, but that the Reverence due to the One, and the Recompence deser∣ved by the Other, would easily countervail all Faults committed by a Clerk or Writer. And whereas some Terms, or other Mat∣ters, may seem to dissent from the usual Phrase of the Common Laws of this Realm: Yet to those who consider the Author's Pro∣fession was principally in the Civil Laws, and therefore not to be expected as one ex∣cellent in both; and also that the Finishing of this Work was in <HI>France</HI>, far from his Library, and in an Embassy, even in the Midst of weighty Affairs; it cannot nor ought not, without great Ingratitude, be displea∣sing in any Sort.</Q>

which were well received. There are some Singularities peculiarly studied in his Style; especially what is called, <HI>The Hunting of the Letter</HI>, and other quaint Conformities of Phrases and Periods; with Comparisons and Applications of the fabulous Properties in Plants, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> very much after the Manner of that new invented Rhetorick with which <HI>John Lilly</HI>, the Court-Poet, had not long before won over a great Party in his <HI>Euphues</HI>, and his Comedies.

<Q>This Tract is dedicated by the said Book∣seller to <HI>Nicholas Sanders</HI> of <HI>Ewell</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to whom he says, It was one of the last Works of a well-known Author, therefore, hopes it will be more acceptable. Adding, that many have published <HI>Repentances</HI> under his Name, but none more unfeigned than this, being every Word of his own; his own Phrases, and his own Method: The Experience of many Vices brought forth this last Vision of Virtue, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereby we may conclude, That as the Author died in 1592, as we have observed, this Pamphlet was probably printed that Year, or the next. The Author, in his Preface, expresses him∣self to be in great Sickness and Sorrow; but desires others, not to shew themselves <HI>vain</HI>, in Reproaching his <HI>Vanity</HI>; says, he had shot at many Abuses, and overshot himself in Describing of some; begs Pardon if he has offended by lascivious Pamphleting, and pro∣mises that, if he lives, he should be heard of, in Divinity; and concludes, with — Yours dying, <HI>Robert Greene</HI>. In his Introduction of the Pamphlet, there is a Copy of Verses, entitled, <HI>Greene</HI>'s <HI>Ode, of the Vanity of wan∣ton Writings</HI>. The Purport of what pro∣ceeds, is an Account of the Vision he had, as he was sitting, in a fair Meadow under an Oak Tree, of <HI>Chaucer</HI> and <HI>Gower</HI>, who came and sat down by him, and they fell into a Colloquy upon a very important Sub∣ject, the most preferable Manner of com∣municating Instruction to the World: <HI>Chau∣cer</HI> maintains the pleasant and humorous Manner; <HI>Gower</HI>, the serious and grave. When they first sat down by him, he sur∣veyed them so earnestly, that he could not forbear Describing their Persons and Attire; which because remarkable, and somewhat in their own Style; and might proceed from something more Authoritative, than bare Invention, we shall, in Respect to those two worthy Bards, repeat.

<Q>This is a Poem, written in Stanzas of seven Lines, to the King upon the Plot, for which the two Priests <HI>Watson</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> were executed. He inveighs most against the Je∣suits, on this Occasion; and also points at some Sectaries, which stood aloof and looked for a Change in the Government. In his Dedication to the King, he has these Words:
<Q>“The first Seeking of your Majesty's Favour in <HI>Scotland</HI>, for a Fault committed heere, in mine own Defence, bound me, by tast∣ing your gracious Goodnesse, ever in Obedi∣ence and Duty; which my Book, of the true Honouring of a King, there testifies, to whom then I was sworn a Servant (be∣fore all the Kings and Queenes of the World) for the which first of the twenty-two Yeres past, I was sore imprisoned and tor∣mented heere at Home: But by the Queen's Clemency, and <HI>Monsieur</HI>'s Means, set at Liberty again, and received to such Favour as, in her good Grace, I was employed about Matters profitable to my Countrey, and to her Commodity great. Which yet I can redouble and unfold to your Majesty, if I be favourably well heard. The good Queen gave me a poor Pension for that Service; and so calling to Mynd, in four Princes Times, I have given a great Push for Preferment, yet I was never advanced, I bethought me of the fifth King, since the other four left me only to a poor Pen∣sion, to whom now, in Hope of some boun∣tifull Consideration, I present a Book cal∣led, <HI>A Balme</HI>; because all precious Balmes search and heale many sore Diseases, which a bad World wants not. Thus in the End of my Pylgrimage, passing towards the Court of Heaven, I pray to the King of Kings, for the long Life and Preservation ”of your Majesty.</Q>
There is joined to the Copy of that Poem before us, another, by the same Author, intitled, <HI>A Paean Trium∣phall</HI>; upon the King's publick Entry from the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI>, to <HI>Westminster</HI>, on <HI>March</HI> the Fifteenth, 1603.

<Q>Here is no Preface, or Editor's Name to this Edition, but he has very industriously given us many Marginal Notes throughout, which in many Places do notably explain the obsolete Words of the Author, who would be more read, and better understood, if his whole Works were so published. For it is, surely, more commodious for the Reader, to turn his Eye to the Side of the Page, than to tumble over the Leaves to a Glossary, at the End of the Book, for every Word he wants.

<Q>This is a Poem upon Father <HI>Garnet</HI>'s <HI>Straw-Miracle</HI>, in Stanzas of six Lines; writ∣ten by one who was a Military Man, and signs himself, <HI>R. P.</HI> In the Title Page, there is a Print, taken from a Copper Plate, representing an Ear of Corn, and in the Middle of it, the Face of a Man, with the Rays of Glory about it, a Kind of pointed Crown upon his Head, a Cross on his Fore∣head, and a little Face of a Child, with Wings like a Cherubim, on the Chin (which concerns another Miracle, too long to repeat) and about the Whole, in an Oval, this In∣scription: <HI>Miraculosa Effigies</HI> R. P. Henrici Garneti, <HI>Societatis Jesu, Martyris</HI> Angliae, 3. Maii 1606. <HI>Garnet</HI> was then hanged, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Churchyard</HI>, for his Share in the <HI>Gunpowder-Treason:</HI> And, at the Quartering of his Limbs, a Straw, with its Ear at the End, sprinkled with the Traytor's Blood, flew off from the Scaffold, or out of the Basket into which his Head was thrown, up∣on a Popish Waiter for some Relique. About five Months after, there appeared upon one of the Grains the Face of a Man <HI>(Garnet</HI>'s no Doubt) specked out in Miniature. And not only all <HI>England</HI>, but all <HI>Europe</HI>, at least as far as <HI>Rome</HI>, was belittered with the News of this miraculous Straw. It was so fruitful, that it multiplied many Hundred Fold, and not without the Improvement of many of∣ficious Engraftments; as may be seen above. Copper-Plates were engraved of it; Volumes, Pamphlets, and Poems have been written of it, in <HI>Latin</HI>, and in <HI>English</HI>. Four Years af∣ter, a Jesuit, who calls himself <HI>Jack Andrew</HI>, published an <HI>Apology</HI> for this Brother of his, under this Title, <HI>Andreae Eudaemon Joannis Cydonii è Societate Jesu, ad Actionem Prodito∣riam Edouardi Coqui Apologia</HI> pro R.

In Answer to this, the learn∣ed Dr. <HI>Robert Abbot</HI>, afterward Bishop of <HI>Sarum</HI>, published his <HI>Antilogia</HI>, in <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1613, in which he has, beyond all Confu∣tation, defended the Justice of his Country, for the Execution of Father <HI>Garnet</HI>, and laid open all the Imposture of this chaffy Miracle.

<Q>One of these Children was a Girl born on the Twenty seventh of <HI>November</HI>, 1608, at <HI>Modbury</HI> in <HI>Devonshire</HI>, without Eyes, Nose, or Ears; and all the Body scored full of red Strokes like bloody Stripes; and the Breast of it joined together, where the Ribs met, with a great Seam of Flesh.

He, being a bad Husband, had left her; and she so grieved at her destitute Condition, that she brought the Child forth dead, well proportioned in all Parts, but the Head, Face, and Neck; having above the Forehead, just to the full half Circle of it, a broad thin Bone growing out of the Skull, covered with Flesh, much like those Caps

<Q>This Tract was written by one who was a Student in the College at <HI>Gratz</HI> in <HI>Stirria</HI>, and has made several Discoveries out of his own Knowledge and Observation, and the Confessions of the Fraternity to him, not of the simple Jesuits, but the Arch-Jesuits themselves; the Regents, Fathers, Provinci∣als, and Generals of their Order, who have such Communication in all Sorts of Wicked∣ness, especially Whoredom, Treason, and Murders, as of one of his Fellow Students, and the Women and Children, they mur∣dered at <HI>Fulda</HI>.

<Q>This Tract is dedicated to the truly Ho∣norable and right Worthy Knight, Sir <HI>Tho∣mas Smith</HI>, Treasurer for the Colonies and Companies of <HI>Virginia</HI>; and Governour of <HI>Muscovia, East-India, North-west Passage</HI>, and <HI>Sommer Islands</HI> Companies. It is pub∣lished by <HI>W. C.</HI> as he signs himself, at the End of the Dedication; whereby is to be un∣derstood, perhaps, <HI>William Crashaw</HI>. There∣in we are informed, That those two brave Commanders, with one-hundred and fifty Persons more, were on the 25th of <HI>July</HI> 1609 in a terrible Tempest driven from their Fleet and cast away, three Days after, upon these Islands; so found a delightful and plentiful Country, when they were far enough from thinking of making any such Discoveries. And though they suffered Shipwreck, upon the Rocks that surround those Islands, yet were they preserved every Man, which ne∣ver before befel any but themselves. There, without any human Creature to molest them, they lived in Health and Safety near a Twelve-month, till, having built two little Ships of the Cedar that grew there, in them they went to <HI>Virginia</HI>, leaving only two Men behind; whom Sir <HI>George Sommers</HI>, return∣ing again the same Year, and the <HI>English</HI> Colony, sent thither in 1612, found in good Plight. From some of that Colony consist∣ing of threescore Men and Women, came over this Narration, who, as they were the first Inhabitants of the <HI>Sommer Islands</HI>, so this is the first Book published to the World concerning them: But a more full and exact Account both of the Country and its Products, with the History of its Discovery, is promi∣sed by this Editor, who says, this short Nar∣ration, in the mean Time, shall rather pre∣pare us for, than prevent us of it. This Tract was reprinted, if we remember right, in one of <HI>Samuel Purchas</HI>'s Volumes of Voyages.</Q>

<Q>The learned and ingenious Author of this Discourse, afterwards Bishop of <HI>Exeter</HI>, &amp;c. dedicates it to the Right Honourable, <HI>Ed∣ward</HI> Lord <HI>Denny</HI>, Baron of <HI>Waltham</HI>. To whom he says,
<Q>“If any Men had Reason to be in Love with the Face of a foreign Entertainment, those are they who were admitted to the Attendance of the truly Generous and Honourable Lord <HI>Hay</HI> your most noble Son, in his late Embassage to <HI>France</HI>, in which Number, my Unwor∣thiness was allowed to make one, who can therefore well witness, that no Man could either receive more Honour from a strange ”Country, or do more Honour to his own.</Q>
But, a little further, he says,
<Q>“Whilst o∣thers were enjoying the noble Courtesies of the Time, my Thoughts entertained themselves with Searching into the Proof of that ordinary Travell, wherewith I saw Men commonly affected; which, I must needs confess, the more I saw, the less ”I liked.</Q>
A little further, That he looked not at earthly Commodities in Travel, but at the Soul;
<Q>“which, I well saw, uses not only to gather no Moss in this Rolling, but suffers the best Graces it hath to mol∣der away insensibly, in such unnecessary Agitation. I have now been twice Abroad; both Times, as thinking myself worthy of Nothing but Neglect, I bent my Eyes upon others, to see what they did, what they got. My Inquiry found our Spiritual Loss so palpable, that, now at last, my Heart could not chuse but break forth at my Hand, and tell my Countrymen of ”the dangerous Issue of their Curiosity.</Q>
A little further acquainting us with his De∣sign in this Treatise, he says,
<Q>“I deal only with those that profess to seek the Glory of a perfect <HI>Breeding</HI>, and the Perfection of that which we call <HI>Civilitie</HI> in <HI>Travell</HI>; of which Sort I have, not without Indig∣nation, seen too many lose their Hopes, and themselves in the Way; returning as empty of Grace and other Virtues, as full of Words, Vanity, and Misdispositions. I dedicate this poor Discourse to your Lord∣ship, as, besides my daily renewed Obli∣gations, congratulating to you the sweet Liberty and happy Use of your Home, who, like a fixed Star, may well overlook these Planets, and, by your constant Set∣tledness, give that Aim to inferiour Eyes, which shall be in vain expected from a ”wandering Light, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
From the Trea∣tise itself, many strong Arguments might be extracted, to demonstrate the greater Like∣lihood of Corrupting our Morals, than Im∣proving our Behaviour, by the ordinary Course of Travel; but no where more than in the twenty-first <HI>Section</HI>, from Page 81, to 85; where he asks, <HI>What Mischief have we among us, that we have not borrowed?</HI> So runs through a long Train of them; begin∣ning at our Skin, and the Variety of our vain Disguises; as if we had not Wit enough to be foolish, unless we were taught it. Our butcherly Duelling; perfumed Diet, to feast the Nose, as well as the Palate; cere∣monious Drinking, to make Gods of others, and Beasts of ourselves; censorious Poli∣ticks, Change of noble Attendance, and ancient Hospitality, for Trundling Coaches, and gaudy Liveries.' Where did we learn,
<Q>“says he, the Art of Dishonesty in practical <HI>Machiavelianism</HI> in false Equivocations? Where the slight Account of that Filthi∣ness, which is but condemned as venial, and tollerated, as not unnecessary? Where the Skill of civil and honourable Hypo∣crisy, in those formal Complements which do neither expect-Belief from others, nor carry any from themselves? Where that unnatural Villany, which though it were burnt with Fire and Brimstone from Hea∣ven, and the Ashes of it drowned in the <HI>Dead Sea</HI>, yet hath made Shift to revive, and calls for new Vengeance upon the Actors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Lo! here, dear Country∣men, the Fruit of your idle Gaddings. Better, perhaps, might be had; but he was never acquainted at Home, that knows not our Nature to be like Fire, which, if there be any Infection in the Room, draws it straight to itself; or like unto Jet, which, omitting all precious Objects,
<PB N="162" REF="162"/>
”gathers up Straws, and Dust, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
So, in the End, he makes a double Suit, first, to our Gentry; that they would learn to be happy at Home: And lastly, to the Su∣preme Authority, for a more strict Restraint of that dangerous Liberty, whereof too many are bold to carve themselves in going Abroad.</Q>

<Q>This Work is divided into Seventeen Chapters, and there are three Stanzas of Verses before it, entitled, <HI>A Prognostication of Blazing Starres, according to the Opinion of the Poet</HI> Pontanus. In the Beginning of the last Chapter, it should seem to be a Translation, from some <HI>German</HI> Author, who there addresses himself to the <HI>Emperour</HI>. And, in the foregoing Page, he mentions the last blazing Star seen, says he, in our Horizon; which blazed from the West, to the North. Moreover, that it continued under <HI>Saturn</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI>, Planets and Signs of unlucky Influence. There was a Bla∣zing Star appeared in our Horizon, that Year this Pamphlet was printed, but not till after the Middle of <HI>November</HI>, so perhaps too late to be that in this Pamphlet described. <HI>Ar∣thur Wilson</HI>, in his <HI>Hist. of Great Britain</HI>, Page 128, says, of the mighty blazing Co∣met, seen in <HI>England</HI> that Year:
<Q>“That it appeared in <HI>Libra</HI>, and that its bearded Beams covered the <HI>Virgin</HI> Sign: It began on <HI>Wednesday</HI> Morning, the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI>, and vanished on <HI>Wednesday</HI>, the Sixteenth of <HI>December</HI> following; ma∣king, in twenty-eight Days Motion, its Circumgiration over most Parts of the known World; extending its radient Looks sometimes forty-five <HI>Degrees</HI> in Length. And, as our Dr. <HI>Bainbridge</HI> ob∣served, towards the Declination of it, about the Eleventh of <HI>December</HI>, it passed over <HI>London</HI> in the Morning, and so hasted more Northwards, even as far as the <HI>Or∣”cades</HI>, &amp;c.</Q>
The Pamphlet, which Dr. <HI>Bainbridge</HI> published on this Occasion, bears this Title:
<Q>“An <HI>Astronomicall Description</HI> of the late <HI>Comet</HI>, from the Eighteenth of <HI>November</HI> 1618, to the Sixteenth of <HI>De∣cember</HI> following.

with a Dedication before it, by the Author, to King <HI>James</HI>.
In which he says,
<Q>“I beganne, not long since, <HI>The Description of Great Britaines Monarchy, in three Columnes; Historicall, Panegyricall</HI>, and <HI>Prophylacticall</HI>; intending thereby to stir up your Leige People to a religious Admiration of Gods wonderfull Provi∣dence, in Uniting these two famous King∣”domes into one Monarchy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>

<Q>“his Astronomicall Description of that Co∣met, deliniated in a Celestiall Planisphere, with some brief Touches in the Prognos∣”ticks and Morall Applications thereof.</Q>
And this is all we are here able to say of the Doctor's Pamphlet, our Copy being all beyond the said Title and Dedication dis∣joined and mislaid, or it might have ap∣peared in a separate and distinct Article.</Q>

He went to <HI>Rome</HI>, to see if Religion flourished better there, than in <HI>Spain</HI>; but was worse pleased there. From thence, he passed over to <HI>Mompelier</HI> in <HI>France</HI>; where, about the Year 1613, he put off his Mookish Cowle, and abjured the Errors of the <HI>Romish</HI> Church, and applied himself to the Study of Physick, and, five Years after, was made Doctor in that Faculty, in the University of <HI>Valence</HI> in <HI>Daulphinee:</HI> Had a publick Pen∣sion, and practised with Repute, in many Places about <HI>Nismes</HI> and <HI>Arles</HI>.

<Q>This Pamphlet has many good Argu∣ments and Remarks in it, in Answer to the Objections usually made to such Under∣takings; however, the Author modestly thinks in his Preface, that they are not filed and smoothned enough for the Press.

(In 9 Leaves) <HI>Quarto</HI>, 1631</P>
<Q><P>This Catalogue was probably compiled by the Printer or Vender of it. It is indeed very imperfect, not only as to that common Defect, in almost all Catalogues, the lazy and blinding Retrenchment of <HI>Titles</HI>, but in the <HI>Number</HI> of Books and Pamphlets pub∣lished in that Space; as also, in omitting the <HI>Names</HI> of many Authors to be found in those which are mentioned, as well as the <HI>Sizes</HI> of many, and often their <HI>Dates</HI>; though in such a circumscribed Period of Years. But as all <HI>Catalogues of Books</HI> are of great Use in Literary Pursuits, so might this have informed some Writers, who have attempted to revive several of the Authors preserved therein, of many Articles, which would have rendered their Account of them more complete. We mean not here to enter into all the other Conveniencies of a more improved <HI>Catalogue</HI>; for it would re∣quire a Volume to display them, and shew all the Reasons, why a Work of such vast Variety, sudden Intelligence, copious In∣struction, and Choice of Entertainment, as a Catalogue might be, has been so much disregarded, and, though so often begun, so soon discontinued. If it be the first <HI>Cata∣logue of English Books</HI>, we have in Print, which was set forth by <HI>Andrew Maunsell</HI>, a Bookseller, in a thin <HI>Folio, Anno</HI> 1595, he seems to have set the Pattern of Imperfection in Works of this Nature, and his Deficien∣cies in the Names of Authors, with the Sizes, and especially Dates of their Books, seem to have been contagious to his Fol∣lowers. His Work is limited to two or three Sciences, whereof History is no Part, but the old Controversial Divinity fills up, as we remember, the greatest Part of the

Book. About the Middle of the next Cen∣tury, came out another Shopman's <HI>Catalogue of the most</HI> vendible <HI>Books in England</HI>. By <HI>William London, Quarto</HI> 1658, in which this Author has been, not negligently, or ignorantly, but studiously more defective in the <HI>Chronology</HI> of his <HI>walking Library</HI>, as he calls it; for you may read from End to End, and not know exactly the Year, in which any one Book throughout the Volume was printed; so being rendered as useless as he could make it in that Point, it is no Wonder, it was so soon turned to waste Pa∣per. As for <HI>Catalogues</HI> of higher Name and Port, we shall not here offer at any Cha∣racter of them, but must, at present, leave their Errors to speak for themselves. But certainly, all Authors, who have published any among us, might go to School to a <HI>Quaker</HI>.

<Q>This extraordinary Invention has brought forth a new <HI>Character</HI>, or <HI>Form</HI> of <HI>Writing</HI>, that may be <HI>common</HI> to all <HI>Languages</HI>; so that one, skilled therein, shall have no Need to learn any other, than his Mother-Tongue, though the Writing were written by one who understood not the Reader's Language, and wrote the said Writing in his own. Whence whatsoever is written in this Cha∣racter, will be legible and intelligible in all Languages, although the Reader, in any, understood but his own, provided he under∣stands this Manner of Writing. A general Consent to the Practise of some such Inven∣tion would certainly produce a vast Ad∣vancement of Knowledge, by Qualifying us for a general or <HI>universal Communication</HI>. And this our Author proposes to bring to pass, by this Scheme. The said Form of <HI>Writing</HI> having no Reference to <HI>Letters</HI>, or their <HI>Conjunctions</HI> in <HI>Words</HI>, according to the several <HI>Languages</HI>; but being rather a Kind of <HI>Hieroglyphical Representation</HI> of <HI>Words</HI>, by so many several <HI>Characters</HI>, for each Word a Character; and that, not at <HI>Random</HI>, but as each Word is either <HI>Radical</HI>, or <HI>De∣rivative</HI>: The Radical have their Radical Characters; the Derivatives bear the Cha∣racter of the <HI>Radix</HI> of their Descent, with some differential Addition, whereby they may be differenced from other Derivatives, proceeding from the said <HI>Radix</HI>; the Feasi∣bility is illustrated by two familiar Instances. The first is, of the <HI>Arithmeticians</HI>, whose
<PB N="168" REF="168"/>
<HI>Numerical Characters</HI> are still the same, although described by those of different Languages; as the Figure of Five (5) is still alike described, whether written by a <HI>Dutch∣man, Englishman, Frenchman</HI>, &amp;c. The second Instance is, of the <HI>Physicians</HI>; whose <HI>Medicinal Weights</HI> are alike characterised, whether in <HI>French, English</HI>, or <HI>Latin</HI> Au∣thors. But our Author seems rather to fol∣low the <HI>Musical Plan</HI>, by the Parallel Lines in which he disposes his Characters. This Discourse is divided into three Parts. The <HI>First</HI> contains the Ground-work of the Fa∣brick, wherein the <HI>Grammatical Distinctions</HI> are treated of, to shew where the <HI>Radix</HI> remains simple, and where it requires dis∣tinctional Additions, in Respect of <HI>Verb</HI>, or <HI>Noun</HI>. The <HI>Second</HI> contains the <HI>Characte∣rical Description</HI> of the <HI>distinctional Additions</HI>, with their Manner of Application; also, a Characterical Description of the <HI>undeclined</HI> Parts of <HI>Grammar</HI>. The <HI>Third</HI> contains a <HI>Practical Application</HI> of the Whole, in an exemplary Demonstration of the Writing itself, with Notes referring to the two first Parts; which are so divided, that they an∣swer one another, in Number of Sections, and in their Order. The Author informs us, that this Work comes not from a Scho∣lar, but a Mechanic; and signs himself, at the End of his Preface, chiefly here ex∣tracted, <HI>F. L. W.</HI> At the End, he gives us to understand that he proposes to publish a <HI>Lexicon</HI>, to compleat his Scheme, and he sets forth his intended Method therein, and by an <HI>Index</HI> to refer each <HI>Word</HI>, by Num∣bers, to the same <HI>Word</HI>, with its <HI>Character</HI>, in the <HI>Lexicon:</HI> With another <HI>Index</HI>, to contain all the <HI>Radical Characters</HI>, with their Significations annexed. For, by finding the <HI>Radix</HI> in your <HI>Index</HI>, you are directed to the <HI>Lexicon</HI>, and, under that <HI>Radix</HI>, you find the Word desired. This Project has been thought so practicable, so considerable, and of such extensive Benefit to Mankind, by many learned Men, that they have, with great Study and Labour, endeavoured to improve upon, and render it still more commodious and prevailing: <HI>Cave Beck</HI>, Master of Arts, published his <HI>Universal-Cha∣racter</HI> in 8<HI>vo</HI>, 1657. <HI>George Dolgarne</HI>, a <HI>Scotsman</HI>, published his <HI>Ars Signorum, vulgo Character Universalis, &amp; Lingua Philosophica, London</HI>, 8<HI>vo.</HI> 1660, which has been enlar∣ged and improved upon, by Bishop <HI>Wil∣kins</HI>, in his <HI>Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language.

Printed by <HI>R. L.</HI> for <HI>R. W.</HI> at the <HI>Star</HI> under St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church in <HI>Cornwall. Quarto</HI>, 1648</P>
<Q>We cannot make such Observations upon this remarkable <HI>Invention</HI>, as we would, all the Copy of our Pamphlet, except this Ti∣tle, and a little Part of the Preface, being, at present, mislaid. I think, I have read it to be the Product of Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>'s fruitful Brain, however it may have escaped <HI>Anthony Wood</HI>, in his Catalogue of that noted Person's Works. This Invention was af∣terwards assumed, or revived, with some Improvements, by Mr. <HI>George Ridpath</HI>, a <HI>Scots</HI> Writer of News, and other Things, in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time. It certainly seems of great Use, that <HI>one Man</HI> can set <HI>two Pens</HI> at Work, or make <HI>two Copies</HI> of a <HI>Writing</HI> at one <HI>Time</HI>; by which, <HI>Tran∣scripts</HI> may be made as soon again, as other∣wise; and many <HI>Errors</HI> prevented. But, whether such <HI>Engines</HI> would be greater Friends or Enemies, if brought into pub∣lick Use, by Depriving Half the Hands in publick Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Employment, should be first considered.</Q>
