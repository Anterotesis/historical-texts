<HEAD><HI>PROLOGUE BY THE AUTHOR.</HI> Spoken by <HI>Mr. J. BANNISTER.</HI></HEAD>
<L>STRANGE there's such magic virtue in a name,</L>
<L>Which deals out censure, or dispenses fame!</L>
<L>And that a <HI>taking</HI> title tends to raise</L>
<L>Dress—Snuff—Quack Med'cines—Pamphlets—Peers and Plays!</L>
<L>Brick-dust call'd—Dentifrice, will current pass;</L>
<L>And mutton-suet for—<HI>Pomade de Grasse!</HI></L>
<L>Some cry, "Corruption undermines a Nation,"</L>
<L>Start at a <HI>bribe,</HI> but touch a—<HI>compensation.</HI></L>
<L>Poor Lady Muzzy can't a dram endure;</L>
<L>Quite faints at <HI>brandy,</HI> but can sip—<HI>Liqueur.</HI></L>
<L>Thus, a mere name can gild a nauseous pill,</L>
<L>Enslave our Reason, and direct our Will!</L>
<L>Since wide extends this empire of caprice,</L>
<L>Our Author, surely, has miscall'd his Piece!</L>
<L>"The FAMILY PARTY!" cries Sir Squander Dash,</L>
<L>"Oh, 'tis some wretched matrimonial hash,</L>
<L>"Where two poor Devils whine and mope together,</L>
<L>"Loll—pick their teeth—look glum—and blame the "weather."</L>
<L>As Lady Listless with her sposo sits,</L>
<L>Stares full at nothing—nods, and starts by fits:</L>
<L>While her <HI>gay</HI> Lord reclin'd on sofa, lies!</L>
<L>Twirls round his watch-key—yawns and rubs his eyes.</L>
<L>Descending from the Great—suppose we pop</L>
<L>Into the snug back-parlour thro' the shop,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>Where a faint twilight o'er the dingy room,</L>
<L>Peeps from the dirty pane's congenial gloom;</L>
<L>Old Grub, with warm plaid gown and velvet cap,</L>
<L>With <HI>Dearee</HI> takes his after-dinner nap:</L>
<L>Who joins in unison the <HI>social</HI> doze,</L>
<L>And snores responsive to his vocal nose!</L>
<L>In bounces Miss from school—slap goes the door—</L>
<L>Shook from the peg and rumpled on the floor,</L>
<L>Down drops Papa's best wig—so spruce, so neat!</L>
<L>Fresh oil'd and powder'd for—churchwarden's seat!</L>
<L>Papa growls, but Mamma attends all glee,</L>
<L>While Miss to crack'd guittar, squalls "Chere amie."</L>
<L>Pleas'd, cries Mamma, "What think ye, if to-day</L>
<L>"We take our Betsy with us to the Play?</L>
<L>"The bill of fare bespeaks a welcome hearty,</L>
<L>"Snug too, and sociable—The FAMILY PARTY."</L>
<L>"The FAMILY PARTY! hold your tongue," says he,</L>
<L>"The very name, egad's, enough for me!</L>
<L>"I'm for what's new—no need abroad to roam</L>
<L>"For that dull Farce we've play'd so long at home."</L>
<L>Thus, all say, Dullness, with her leaden seal,</L>
<L>Marks for her own, each Party <HI>en famille:</HI></L>
<L>But if sage Critics condescend to share</L>
<L>A Poet's treat, none thinks of <HI>sumptuous</HI> fare;</L>
<L>Bring Candour with you, a most welcome guest,</L>
<L>To two slight dishes, by no French cook drest!</L>
<L>With those, our Friends we gratefully invite</L>
<L>To our domestic Party here to-Night.</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>PREFACES have been generally considered as Prologues to the Reader; and various have been the methods made use of in them, to depre∣cate the censure, and conciliate the favour of the Public. These have been long since, as Chaucer says, <HI>"bolted to the bran;"</HI> nor would the Author of this dramatic trifle have adopted the practice on the present occasion, did it not give him an oppor∣tunity of acknowledging, that the very flattering reception it obtained on the Stage, was greatly to be ascribed to the inimitable performance of Mr. J. BANNISTER.</P>

<P>Ha! if I can believe my eyes—my old Eton friend, Jack Spriggins!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Young Spriggins.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Rampart! to see you at Bath is fortunate indeed! But why need you doubt the evidence of your eye-sight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as SOME of my senses have deceived me, I didn't know whether the rest might not be equally fallible; I THOUGHT I saw you alight at the Hotel, but was informed that there was no stranger just arrived but a Mr. Belmont.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O, I can explain this seeming inconsis∣tency!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What, you are just come from Cambridge to stay <HI>out</HI> a thirty-pound quarterage, and have taken Belmont for a travelling name—being more genteel than that of Jack Spriggins?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, I was going to tell—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or is it that your modesty shrinks from too much popularity, and you're afraid of being tapped on the shoulder by a FRIEND, whose acquaintance you mayn't so easily SHAKE OFF?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, 'twas neither pride nor roguery, though, I grant you, they BOTH sometimes assist the creation of new titles.—You recollect my attachment to my cousin Laura?—My father now urges me to marry the old Widow Wheezy, and so sent me to Cam∣bridge to break off my former connection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what brings you to Bath?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The sight of my Laura's name in the news∣papers among the ARRIVALS. So I instantly followed her, called myself Belmont, lest my father (who is snug at his shop in the country) might see my name in the papers too, and, by joining us, make it rather too much of a FAMILY PARTY.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, I suppose, she is sent here to lose the idea of your sweet person—and while you are describing the circles of a ball room, your father thinks you are describing the circles of Euclid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Even so!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is but TRANSFERRING the seat of science—making the calculations of algebra at a whist table—Studying astronomy, through an opera-glass,— and hydrostatics, at the Pump Room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha! You have not forgot the phrase of a soph yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Forgot! Why, I was a whole year at Cam∣bridge, except that part of it that I was RUSTICATED, and so took lodgings in Covent Garden, and attended too, all the philosophical lectures—at Newmarket!— But what is your present plan of operations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>THAT I leave to an abler engineer than myself; no less a man than Pinch, our College hair-dresser, whom I have brought here with me as a tempo∣rary valet. He has been in so many different situations of life, that he can assume any form with the greatest facility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But what made him give up his College business to follow—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why you must know, the only school that Pinch is attached to, is the EPICUREAN; and a late Edict, forbidding good eating, went against both his philosophy and his stomach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he fell a martyr to his principles, and was turned out for smuggling into College a dinner in disguise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A dinner in disguise!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, a pig in a portmanteau; a goose in a gown, and a calf's head under a tutor's wig!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, these are talents that need not be idle in this region of intrigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But you shall judge—I expect him every instant; I have sent him to reconnoitre. He knows the Lady, by having dressed the family at our country races—But I hear him—I'm all impatience. <STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Pinch.</STAGE> Well, have you seen the dear charmer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, I have seen the dear CHARMER.<STAGE><HI>drily.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>This is an unexpected happiness! But will there be no obstacle to our meeting?</P>

<P>Yes, the mail coach, together with your aunt, Mrs. Malmsey, and the shop porter for a foot∣man.</P>

<P>Why, faith, Jack, here's an enemy in your own quarters.</P>

<P>Unfortunate, indeed! But prithee, dear Charles, devise something for me, the finesse of gallan∣try is quite your FORTE.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you do me honour—but were I a lit∣tle more acquainted with Mr. Pinch's talents, I could better think in what channel to employ them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! he'll be sufficiently communicative.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but before you commence hostili∣ties, publish your manifesto. Get a letter written this instant, while we plan the delivery.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit Young</HI> Spriggins.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see—I have been thinking—Suppose I was to endeavour to carry the letter by introducing my∣self in my own trade—a lady's hair-dresser?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo! that's a hit above your profession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir, I have belonged to so many trades, that were I to honour the City with taking my Free∣dom, there would be a contest which Company should present with a gold box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Really!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, yes; my father thought two trades as necessary as two hands; for he himself was a bookseller and a hatter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What connection could there—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A very clear one—for many of his customers had no head for a book, but they all had a head for a hat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That indeed—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So my father would fain have bred me both an apothecary and undertaker, that I might have play'd into my own hands—but my mother thought there was a trick in THOSE trades, and so would have me—an attorney.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Conscientiously circumspect indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but I soon was soon tired of the drud∣gery of the desk, got more creditors than clients, was clapt into jail, and instead of following the law—the law follow'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No uncommon case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I then went into the physical line; for I had got a smattering of farriery, and produc'd a universal medicine; but after having spent all my time in writing letters of gratitude to myself, and my money, in pro∣curing their insertion in the papers—my medicine would not take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Because no one would take my medicine. I then tried ANIMAL MAGNETISM, but that loadstone wou'd draw no money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, because its power was not push'd by French impudence; and we had rather be cheated by any one than by our own countrymen—But you were unlucky indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Pinch.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not much of that—for I then became Ma∣nager of the wooden comedy, and interpreter to the waxwork-court of King Solomon!</P>

<P>But did'nt he say, Laura Stanley? Why faith, if I mistake not, she was one of our cotillion— set last night in the rooms, and, egad, if I am right in the <HI>Lady,</HI> I am equally so in another circumstance—I can inform you of a rival.</P>

<P>A rival!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A most formidable one—a billiard acquain∣taintance, whom I expect to call on me at the Hotel here—No less a man than Sir Toby Twaddle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Spriggins.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I have heard of his name, he was knighted when he was partner with Alderman Giblet, the great poulterer, in Bear-binder Lane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The same, and a most laughable specimen of ridiculous poverty; you'd enjoy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Spriggins.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, heaven forbid I should ever be capable of adding insult to the agony of distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And <HI>I</HI> think it equally unmanly, <Q>“to hang ”misfortune out to public scorn,</Q> 'tis a hackney'd, but true observation, that we are not ridiculous for what we ARE, for but what we AFFECT to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I allow—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This, then, is the exact character of Sir Toby, he has a decent annuity, and sacrifices the com∣forts of life, to ape the superfluities; and will dine on two penn'orth of beef ala-mode, at noon, that he may figure away in the side boxes at night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His dress is the very epitome of his man∣ners, shabbily genteel. He wears point ruffles, and a black stock, to hide dirty linen—his stockings WERE WHITE SILK, till eternal washing gave them the YEL∣LOW JAUNDICE, and by the constant oeconomy of <HI>coaxing,</HI> half of them has gradually sunk beneath the HORIZON of his shoe—His cloaths—<STAGE><HI>Twaddle speaks within.</HI></STAGE> but hark!

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Toby.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Duke you must know has recommen∣ded matrimony to his Lordship, as an alterative, and he wish'd me to forward the prescription, for, says he, Toby (slapping me on the back, at the hazard of dislo∣cating one of his emaciated fingers,) we all know, my dear Knight, what effect your figure has with the Ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, the elegance of your address is not quite so DISINTERESTED. Come, come, I know you are negociating for YOURSELF.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Toby.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, I believe I MUST marry, if it is only to put an end to the rivalship of the Ladies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very considerate, indeed, Sir Toby.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir Toby, I'm told it's no secret, that Laura Stanley is the happy fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Y. Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, positively now, there can nothing be done among us people of fashion, but half an hour carries it from the pump room to the parade.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Rampart.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I know the Lady's aunt, Mrs. Malmsey, is determined she shall marry a man of fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Toby.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, in THAT she is something of a more rational being than the rest of the family, or I should have cut the connection long ago.</P>

<P>Why, that's unlucky then—Jack, you'll get off too cheaply <STAGE><HI>winking to Young</HI> Spriggins.</STAGE> I have just won a wager, of a rump and a dozen, of Belmont, and wanted some friends to dine at his ex∣pence.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Toby.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, my absence would only throw a gloom on the hilarity of the meeting—and, Rampart, do let us have that hunting pudding I met with when I din'd last year at your mess; faith I shall beg the re∣ceipt for it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, well, ha! ha!—I'll go this instant

<P>And then, I tremble for you at the rooms, after last night's fracas—I am glad Sir Toby was not there—reaching across the table, and almost squeezing Mrs. Drybones' fingers to atoms, in shaking hands with her, because you got the odd trick against four by honours; didn't you set Lady Waddle's head on fire, by knocking the candle against it with your elbow.</P>

<P>Why, Pinch sound out that old Mr. Sprig∣gins expects the rider, put has never seen him yet; as this is the first season that Mr. Dennim, the draper, has left off riding for himself.</P>

<P>Well, but why need we be so precipitate.</P>

<P>Nay, Sir, we must lose no time—In this mar∣ket of marriage, a young lady of fortune is snapt up like a John a Dory, before you have time to ask the price.</P>

<P>Egad, I believe you're right—tho' I have taken a pretty effectual precaution to keep off the young sparks, by lodging HERE in the VERY house of that most indefatigable of all duns—old Crossgrain, the taylor.</P>

<P>Right! for when goods are delivered, as we say, they can't be return'd on our hands.</P>

<P>That's true!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Old Sprig.</HI></SPEAKER>
