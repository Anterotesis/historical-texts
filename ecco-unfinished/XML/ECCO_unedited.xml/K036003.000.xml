<HEAD>A Faithful
NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">S</SEG>ORRY am I—yea very
grievous it is unto me, that
the unchristian Treatment I
have lately undergone, com∣pelleth
me to complain of that
Malevolence which meseemeth
hath soured the Milk of human Kindness,
and engendered Rancour and Envy in the
Room of Peace and brotherly Affection.—
An Office of Humanity in which I was late∣ly
concerned, hath been so cruelly, not to
call it heathenishly misrepresented to my
Prejudice, that I were more insensible than
the Beasts that perish, could I sit tamely
under the Spout of Slander, without seeking
to justify the Uprightness of my Intention in
the Face of God and Man. It having been
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
industriously whispered about, that I was
aiding and abetting in a Confederacy against
the Peace and Conscience of my Neighbour
<HI>Habbakkuk Hilding,</HI> Justice, Chapman and
Dealer, whereby the Brain of the said
<HI>Hilding</HI> was miserably distempered, so as to
render him incapable of carrying on his
Trade, or providing for his Wife and nu∣merous
Family; I, in Justice to my own
Character, as well as to the Intent that those
Persons who were guilty of this base and
enormous Crime, may be properly stigma∣tized
and punished, for their Barbarity.—I
say, being moved by these Considerations,
I will now, with the utmost Sincerity and
Regard to Truth, narrate the Particulars of
this heinous Transaction, that the Publick
may see whether I have not acted as became
an honest Man, a good Neighbour, and
zealous Christian.—</P>
<P>First then, it will be necessary to premise
that I have for some Time past, lived on
the Foot of friendly Intercourse with the
above mentioned <HI>Hilding,</HI> being thereunto
moved by the Report of divers substantial
and creditable Housekeepers in the Neigh∣bourhood,
who assured me that he had
quitted all the vicious and abandoned Courses
of his former Life, and now behaved in
every respect, like a sober Subject and vigi∣lant
Magistrate; and although during the
Term of our Acquaintance, I have known
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
him break out into sundry Irregularities both
in Life and Conversation, I cannot help
owning that he was upon the whole, more
calm and moderate than one could well ex∣pect
of a Person so long accustomed to
Riot, Outrage and all manner of Profligacy.
His latter Excesses I charitably imputed to a
small Residue of the old Leaven working
with the Infirmities of old Age; and with
regard to some temporary Paroxisms of De∣lirium
to which he was subject, I was given
to understand that they proceeded from a
disordered Imagination, originally produced
by some unlucky overthrows he had sustain'd
in the Warfare of an Author.</P>
<P>It was to this Cause, I ascribed divers ex∣travagancies
which I of late observed in his
private Deportment: Such as mixing To∣bacco
with his Beer, and insisting upon our
pledging him in that unpalatable Composi∣tion;
swearing with horrid Imprecations,
that if we refused to do him Justice, we
should be forthwith committed to <HI>Bridewell:</HI>
He was also seized with the unaccountable
Whim of smoaking his Pipe at his posterior
Chimney, of leaking in his favourite Con∣stable's
Hat, and one Night at the Club,
where he always used to fabricate our Punch,
instead of Sugar he dissolved a large Quan∣tity
of purging Salts. When we complained
of the Sophistication he swore that what he
had done was for the Preservation of Health,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
on the Authority of one Dr. <HI>Thumpscull,</HI>
whom he represented as the greatest Physi∣cian
upon Earth, who had at length disco∣vered
the universal Catholicon, which was
no other than <HI>Acton</HI>-Water impregnated
with these Salts. Sometimes he would sink
into a State of profound musing, during
which he would neither reply to our Inter∣rogations,
nor drink off his Glass, which
formerly he never used to neglect; but shift
his Chew from one Cheek to another, and
twist his Mouth into various Contorsions
without Intermission; then he would, all of
a sudden, snap his Fingers, pronounce some
incoherent Curse, and tilting himself upon
one Hip, emit a very audible Explosion;
which indeed every Member had the Privi∣lege
of doing; in as much as the Club is
stiled the <HI>Free</HI> and <HI>Easy.</HI></P>
<P>“Assuredly, (said I to myself) these
Symptoms indicate a total Subversion of
Intellect; for, they have continued for
several Days successively, whereas, his for∣mer
Fits seldom lasted longer than a few
Hours. I must observe his Conduct
more narrowly, before I venture to de∣clare
myself, lest I should incur the
Penalty of the Law for Defamation; and
so soon as I shall be convinced that he is
in reality <HI>non compos,</HI> perform the Duties
of my own Conscience, in warning the
rest of his Friends and Relations, so as
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
that he may be properly restrained from
doing Mischief.”—Actuated by these
Christian Considerations, and none other,
I redoubled my Visits to his House, and in
one of these, seeing two Persons enter, with
very important Countenances, I retired to
another Apartment on the Supposition that
they were come upon Business; and when
they withdrew, returned to the Room they
had left, where I found Mr. <HI>Hilding</HI> foam∣ing
at the Mouth with a very particular
Wildness in his Looks, and other Marks of
extreme Agitation, which was the more re∣markable
as he had been perfectly sober and
sedate when I quitted the Room.</P>
<P>I could not help suspecting that this vio∣lent
Emotion was the Effect of what had
happened between him and those Strangers;
and even began to be apprehensive that they
had been tampering with him on the Score
of Religion, according to the Practice of
some <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Priests, who lie in
wait for those Symptoms of a decayed Un∣derstanding,
in order to make Converts to
their damnable Communion; for, my poor
Neighbour raved exceedingly about St. <HI>Paul</HI>
and the <HI>Apocalypse;</HI> and with many Oaths
pronounced the reproachful Terms of Rogue,
Rascal, Hypocrite, Goose, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which I sup∣pose
were bestowed upon the said Visitants.
He who seemed to be the principal Figure,
was a long, lean, lank, mishapen Spectre,
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
with an aukward, shambling, Goose-like
Gait, a Neck of prodigious Extension, and
a most simple Physiognomy, which at that
Time I really took to be the Result of
consummate Dissimulation. In a Word, I
dreaded some Jesuitical Conspiracy, and re∣solved
to watch them more narrowly in their
future Visitations.</P>
<P>I accordingly hinted my Suspicions to
Mrs. <HI>Hilding,</HI> who thanked me for my
kind Concern, and actually gave me Notice
the very next Day, that the same Persons
were returned: I then, for my own Justifi∣cation,
engaged two of my Neighbours to
accompany and assist me in this charitable
Work, and repairing to my Friend <HI>Hab∣bakkuk</HI>'s
House, we were privately intro∣duced
into an Apartment where we could
overhear the Conversation that passed be∣tween
him and his Guests. The first Voice
we heard was that of his Worship, who in
a very vehement Tone spoke to the follow∣ing
Purpose. “Blood and Thunder! Sir
<HI>Gosling,</HI> don't tell me of your Favours;
I am sure I have purchased them at a
damned dear Price. Zounds! I have
been hooted at, beat and battered, lost
my Senses, my Teeth and Reputation in
your Service; and the Devil confound me
if I have the least Inclination to reim∣bark
at these Years, in such a desperate
Quarrel.” The other having solemnly re∣buked
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
him for his profane Swearing, as a
Practice altogether indecent and of evil Ex∣ample
in a Magistrate; desired him to recol∣lect
what he owed, in point of Gratitude,
to the Man who had rescued him from the
Contempt of the World, and the Horrors of
Indigence, from which all his Talents could
not defend him. “Have not I (said the
Remonstrant) relieved you in your Ne∣cessities,
been the Bawd to your Perform∣ances;
and, in Despite of all Decorum,
erected you into a Judge over your Fel∣lows;
and now that I am insulted in
publick, do you refuse to stand forth in
my Behalf?” <HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> irritated by
these Upbraidings, replied in a furious Accent,
“Damme, Sir, you must give me leave to
act the Remembrancer in my Turn. Pray,
am not I the Person who, in Defiance to
his own Conscience, hath been an humble
and assiduous Minister to your Vanity and
Self-conceit? Have I not been your Bully
in private Conversations, representing you
as a mighty Orator, profound Statesman,
immense Scholar, Critick and Wit? Have
I not even prostituted my own Judgment
and Character so far as to celebrate you for
these Talents in the Works I have pub∣lished?
Have not I played the Part of
your Zany or Jack-Pudding in weekly
Lucubrations against the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> until
the most zealous Whig was sick of my
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Buffoonery, and totally discarded me and
mine Ass? I have not only buttered you,
Sir <HI>Gosling,</HI> but by G—d, I have de∣scended
so low as to write Panegyrick
upon the most contemptible of those
who had scribbled in your Praise; and
what is my Recompense for all this Sa∣crifice?
Why truly, you have put me
in a Way of getting Bread when I have
no longer Teeth to eat it. But granting,
as you observe, my Talents could scarce
keep me from starving in my Youth,
when all my Faculties were in Perfection,
what a Figure should I now cut, were I
to declare War against Antagonists who
are allowed to have Health, Strength, and
Dexterity on their Side? Have you for∣got
what a scurvy Champion I proved in
the Character of <HI>Hercules Vinegar,</HI> when
I was detected in playing Booty and hissed
off the Stage? Don't you still perceive in
my Countenance Marks of repeated Dam∣nation?
And will you persist in desiring
me to expose myself to fresh Dangers and
Disgrace by assuming the Title of <HI>Censor</HI>
of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to which I have just as
good a Claim as the under Turn-key of
<HI>Bridewell</HI> has to the Government of <HI>Gib∣raltar?</HI>
'Sdeath! Sir <HI>Gosling,</HI> it but ill
becomes me to attack those who really are
the Inhabitants of <HI>Grubstreet?</HI>—Me, who
at many different Periods of my Life have
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
had no Habitation at all; who was indeed
literally the Inhabitant of the first Street
that presented me with a dry Bulk, or
convenient Penthouse for the Night's
Lodging; who would have rejoiced at
being admitted into any Garret in <HI>Grub∣street,</HI>
or Cellar in <HI>Thieving-Lane,</HI> where
I could have enjoyed the Benefits of a
clean Straw-Couch, and a Cover over
my Head; who have been fain to hire
myself as Author to a Puppet-shew Man;
and even to blow the Trumpet in Quality
of Herald to a Collection of wild Beasts
at <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair, rather than per∣severe
in suffering the incredible Fa∣tigue,
continual Apprehension, and un∣numbered
Drubbings annexed to the
Employment of a Bawdy-house Bully,
which I exercised for the Space of two
whole Years: hath not the Horse-laugh
of the Public been turned against me, by
almost every Person whom I have attemp∣ted
to ridicule? witness that facetious Ras∣cal
who even disputed my Existence, and
actually proved me defunct, while his
Customers were treated with Tea at my
Expence. With what Face then can I
take the Field against Antagonists whom
you in your Conscience know and have
often owned to be Soldiers of Courage and
Proof, and who knew perfectly well
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
how to manage those Batteries of Ridicule
against me? Answer me that Sir <HI>Gosling.</HI>”</P>
<P>I was much pleased and comforted at
hearing this Expostulation, which was not
only sensible and discreet, but moreover
fraught with a becoming Modesty, which I
had never before marked in the Conversa∣tion
of my poor Friend: For, he was al∣ways
observed to have that Failing of low
Minds, which is shewn by Humility and
Fawning in the Day of Trouble; and by
Arrogance and over-weening Conceit in his
better Fortune—But those evil Counsellors
were not thus to be baffled in their perni∣cious
Design—Sir <HI>Gosling</HI> still proceeded in
his Incentives, affirming that <HI>Habbakkuk</HI>
would, in the War which he had projected,
have divers considerable Advantages over his
Adversaries, in as much as he was already ren∣dered
callous and insensible, by the numberless
Disgraces he had undergone; consequently
case-hardened against the Weapons of the
Foe, who might perhaps sustain some acci∣dental
Stroke in the Course of the Cam∣paign;
while he could not possibly suffer
the least Diminution in point of Glory and
Importance; so happily was he placed be∣low
the Level of Ridicule or Censure.
“Let me illustrate this Assertion (said he)
with the Example of your Friend and
quondam Companion <HI>Buckhorse</HI> the Shoe-cleaner
and Bruiser, whose Character and
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
Situation bears a strong Analogy with
your own. Would not that indefatigable
Veteran, who hath been pummelled out
of all the Sensations, and indeed almost out
of the Appearance of human Nature,
have palpably the best of the Match in
engaging with an Hero of superior Sensi∣bility
and Fame? Surely, yes—because
there is something which by the Chance
of Battle he might gain, and nothing
which by being defeated, he could lose—
all that I require of you, is to march
forth in Procession, like a sturdy Prize-fighter,
who with Sword in Hand and a
Number of Patches on his Skull, the
Marks of former Prowess, challenges his
rival Warriors to single Combat—Sound
the Trumpet of Defiance against all those
Champions who are either your Foes or
mine: Whatever Talents they may have,
or whatsoever may have been their Suc∣cess;
treat them all as Cowards, Asses,
Grubs and Vermin; but let loose the
chief Torrent of your Gall against that
Rascal <HI>Peregrine Pickle,</HI> who hath
brought us both to Ridicule and Shame—if
you should chance to see him in your
March, take Post in the next Kennel,
and bespatter him with Dirt; that is
an Exercise in which I am sure he is
not your Equal. Should he decline the
Encounter, pursue him with Abuse—
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
your blind Brother will join the Cry, and
ring the Changes upon the Words <HI>mean,
low, stupid, Scandal</HI> and <HI>Scurrility.</HI>”</P>
<P>Here he was interrupted by the unfortu∣nate
<HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> who exclaimed in a most
outragious Strain. “Death and the Devil
and Damnation! d' ye want to make me
a Laughing-stock to the lowest of the
Rabble—does not all the World know
that <HI>Habbakkuk Hilding</HI> was never heard
of as an Author, until he opened an
Office for the Sale of Scurrility and per∣sonal
Abuse, which was known by the
Name of <HI>Hilding</HI>'s Scandal Shop, and be∣came
as notorious as the Oratory of <HI>Clare-Market?</HI>—have
you forgot what a Stab
the Liberty of the Press received, on ac∣count
of my Presumption, and the Inso∣lence
of certain Persons? Sir <HI>Gosling,</HI> d-mn
my Blood, we know one another.”—In
this Place he suffered another Interruption,
by the Knight, who with some Expressions
of kind Concern, took Notice that <HI>Hab∣bakkuk</HI>'s
Countenance was changed, that
his Eyes seemed hollow, and one Side of his
Mouth convulsed; and begged he would take
a few Drops of a salutary Elixir, which he (Sir
<HI>Gosling</HI>) always carried in his Pocket for
his own Use, because he was subject to the
same Irregularity of Spirits.—I no sooner
heard this Offer made, then I applied one
Eye to a small Hole in the Partition, and
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
saw the said Sir <HI>Gosling</HI> pour a Quantity of
that pernicious Drug into a Glass of Water,
and make a Tender of it to the unhappy Pa∣tient,
who with much Reluctance swal∣lowed
the Dose, in consequence of the re∣peated
Entreaties and Blandishments of the
two Strangers; and they seeing their Train
take Effect, muttered something in a low
Voice, with many strange Gesticulations,
which I was equally astonished and afraid
to behold.</P>
<P>In a few Minutes the Effect of this dia∣bolical
Philtre was but too evident—the
miserable Patient seemed to undergo a mo∣mentary
Slumber, from which he started in
a violent Burst of Laughter: Then he began
to sing with great Vociferation—kissed his
Visitants, swore they had inspired him with
the Spirit of <HI>Alexander;</HI> that he would fight
Sir <HI>Gosling</HI>'s Quarrels, until he should have
put all his Enemies under his Feet. Terri∣fied
at these sudden and amazing Symptoms
of Frenzy and Delusion, I poured forth an
Ejaculation to Heaven that I might be pre∣served
from the Power of such infernal Sor∣cery,
and retired without Loss of Time to
my own House, being followed by my two
Friends, who as yet did not know the true
Source of my Fears—I am not one of
those incredulous People who will not be∣lieve
there are Spells to take the Reason
Prisoner; therefore I kept within Doors,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
praying for my unhappy Friend, and wait∣ing
to see the Issue of those damnable Arts
that were practised upon him—when lo!
next Morning, I had Occasion to observe
the Power of Infatuation in its full Extent.</P>
<P>About eleven o'Clock, <HI>Hilding</HI>'s Door was
beset with a strange Crew of both Sexes,
who I at first imagined, were assembled as
usual in the Characters of Plaintiff and De∣fendant;
but I was soon undeceived, by
venturing to go out, and taking my Station
among the Spectators that stood at some
Distance from the Skirts of this Mob. The
first Person of Consequence that appeared at
the Door was his own Brother, who, as
well as <HI>Habbakkuk,</HI> is Proprietor of a twelve
penny Office, and commonly distinguished
by the Title of the blind Muster-Master
General of the Tag, Rag and Bob-tail.
Sure I am, he acted in that Capacity, on
this Occasion, giving Directions to an Under∣strapper
to range the whole Troop into diffe∣rent
Divisions, and appoint a Leader to each.
These Dispositions being made, every Indivi∣dual
was regaled with a large Glass of Geneva,
and then <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> appearing in Person,
was saluted with three Chears, and the Ac∣clamation
of “Long live the invincible Sir
<HI>Alexander Drawcansir.</HI>”—I was not a
little surprized to hear my unhappy Neigh∣bour
dubbed with a Title prefixed to an In∣version
of my own Name—but this was
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
doubtless the Work of his Instigators, who
regarded me with an evil Eye, because they
probably knew I had cautioned him against
their enormous Practices.</P>
<P>They had by this Time reduced him to
a deplorable Object—his whole Face and
upper Garment were bedaubed with Snuff,
his Mouth was crammed with Tobacco, the
Tincture of which ran down his Beard in
divers yellow Streams: His Eyes seemed to
reel, and he staggered into the Street like
an intoxicated Tinker, exclaiming in a fran∣tic
Strain, “Damn them for Miscreants! I'll
cut and carve and carbonado the whole
Race—bring me my <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> ye
Slaves.”—So totally was the Judgment of
this poor Wretch perverted, that he mount∣ed
a Jack-Ass which they had prepared for
the Purpose, in the full Persuasion, that it
was the identical Steed of <HI>Alexander</HI> the
<HI>Great:</HI> But, in nothing was his Frenzy
more conspicuous than in his Behaviour,
while he rode round the Ranks to review
his Forces, with a curtailed Mopstick, by
way of leading Staff, in his Hand, he made
Obeisance to his blind Brother, as to the
Author of the Iliad; shook Hands with a
Constable, calling him by the Name of
<HI>Aristotle;</HI> imagined he saw <HI>Pindar</HI> in the
Person of a Shoe-Black, and <HI>Horace</HI> repre∣sented
by a Thief-Taker: By the same In∣fatuation
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
he beheld the rest of the Ancients
in his Army, personated by Vagabonds,
Pick-pockets, and Ballad-singers, whom his
Brother had enlisted into the Service; and
riding up to a draggle-tailed Bunter, who had
lost her Nose in the Exercise of her Occupa∣tion,
he addressed himself to her by the Appel∣lation
of the adorable <HI>Amelia,</HI> swore by all the
Gods she was the Pattern of all earthly Beauty
and Perfection; and that he had exhausted
his whole Fancy in celebrating her Name—To
this Compliment she answered in a snuff∣ling
Tone, “Justice, you're a comical Bitch;
I wish you would treat me with a Dram
this cold Morning,” and before he could
reply, he was accosted by a shabby Fellow
dressed in a Soldier's old Coat, who in a
whimpering Accent, seconded the Lady's
Request, giving his Worship to understand
that the divine <HI>Amelia</HI> had for three Days
tasted nothing stronger than some brown
Caudle of his own making. In consequence
of this Remonstrance, <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> presented
him with an old Iron Tobacco-Box, say∣ing,
“Well, Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> here is something
you may pledge in her Behalf at the next
Gin-shop.”—He then put himself at
their Head, and ordered the whole Caval∣cade
to march.</P>
<P>Accordingly they proceeded down <HI>Ca∣therine-street</HI>
to the <HI>Strand,</HI> in a most tu∣multuous
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Manner, bellowing Defiance to all
who should presume to oppose them; their
Commander leading the Van upon Ass∣back,
and his Brother bringing up the Rear,
under the Guidance of one who called him∣self
<HI>Jones,</HI> and pretended to be a Gentle∣man;
though he was in reality no other
than a Player's Bastard, and had been for∣merly
transported under another Name—
His Right-Hand Man was one <HI>Partridge,</HI> a
notorious Felon and Impostor; and on his
Left stalked a strange uncouth Figure with
a long Beard, whom the said <HI>Jones</HI> stiled
the Philosopher of the Hill; but, he after∣wards
proved to be a Sheep-stealer in Dis∣guise—as
for <HI>Amelia</HI> and her beloved <HI>Booth,</HI>
they marched Hand in Hand immediately
behind the General; the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brandishing
a Broomstick, and the Husband weilding a
Distaff, with a Glyster-pipe fixed to his
Button-Holes—He suffered a great many fu∣rious
Looks from a termagant Oyster-Wench
called <HI>Matthews,</HI> who walked at a little Di∣stance
from this fond Couple, and frequently
flourished her Knife at them, with all the
Marks of Jealousy and Despair.</P>
<P>In this Manner they continued their March
without Opposition, to the Terror of his
Majesty's peaceable Subjects; and made an
Halt on the Banks of the Kennel that wa∣ters
the <HI>New Church</HI> in the <HI>Strand</HI>—here
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
they stopped with a View to send off De∣tachments
to different Quarters of the Town,
when all of a sudden the above-mentioned
<HI>Mattkews,</HI> seeing a decent Gentlewoman cros∣sing
the Street, ran up to <HI>Habbakkuk</HI> with vio∣lent
Emotion, crying, “D—n my Eyes!
Justice, now is the Time to stand by me,
for there's the B—ch Miss <HI>Williams,</HI>
Waiting-Maid to Madam <HI>Random,</HI> com∣ing
for a Warrant to have me nabbed for
nimming her Gown and Capuchin.”—
At the same Instant, <HI>Partridge</HI> having de∣scried
a Journeyman Barber, with a remark∣ably
long Chin, passing by <HI>Somerset-House,</HI>
in Conversation with another Man, roared
out with uncommon Symptoms of Affright,
“Blood! We shall all be grabbed, don't
you see the Dog <HI>Strap</HI>—the very Cull who

<P>Vide Dict. of Cant Words and Phrases.</P></NOTE> snab∣bling
his Peeter and Queer <HI>Joseph</HI>—'tis
Time to shabb off, d—n my Liver.” With
these Words he betook himself to his Heels,
and fled with great Expedition, being fol∣lowed
by the <HI>pseudo Jones</HI> and <HI>Man of the
Hill,</HI> who though they did not rightly con∣ceive
his Meaning, knew themselves too
well to hazard any Explanation with the
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Officers of Justice—This Defection pro∣duced
an universal Pannick among the Sol∣diers
and even Officers of the second Line:
insomuch that a general Rout ensued, and
the blind Chieftain was overthrown by
<HI>Aristotle</HI> in his Retreat.</P>
<P><HI>Habbakkuk</HI> seeing this Disorder in his
Troops, clapped Spurs to his Ass and pur∣sued
the Fugitives, cursing them for their
Cowardice, and exhorting them to return;
but they soon vanished notwithstanding his
Remonstrances, and when he wheeled about
to encourage the rest to persevere in their
Duty, the greatest Part of them were al∣ready
dispersed, and his chief Friends and
Favourites in the Custody of a Constable,
who at my Solicitation had been detached
by Justice <HI>Le Gard,</HI> to apprehend the Ring∣leaders
of such a Riot against the Laws of
the Land, and the Peace of his Majesty's
loyal Subjects.—This Event, instead of calm∣ing,
rather inflamed the Delirium of the
unfortunate <HI>Hilding,</HI> who uttered many
frantic Imprecations against the Cowards
who had betrayed him, swore, in Imitation
of his Predecessor and Namesake, that he
would pursue his Conquests in his own Per∣son,
then couching his Mopstick, with a
strange and ludicrous Distortion of Feature,
applied his Heels to the Sides of the sup∣posed
<HI>Bucephalus,</HI> with Intent to charge his
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
Opponents, whom, it seems, he mistook for
one <HI>Peregrine Pickle</HI> and his Associates, in
as much as he addressed himself to Mr. Con∣stable
as to the said <HI>Pickle,</HI> exclaiming,</P>
<P>“I know thee well, a Blood thou art,”</P>
<P>“Lord <HI>Pickle,</HI> So am I,”—With these
Words he would have assaulted the Peace
Officer, had not myself and several of his
Neighbours laid hold on him, and carried him
to his own House, where by the Advice of
an able Physician, he was immediately
blooded, blistered and purged.</P>
<P>But his Frenzy still continues, and the
Doctor seems to despair of his Recovery.
For tho' by dint of the Evacuations he hath
undergone, the Rage of his Frenzy is in
some Measure abated, he still continues de∣prived
of his Senses, and is between whiles
seized with shocking Fits of Horror and De∣spair,
during which he is often heard to cry,
—“Save me from that Ruffian <HI>Pipes!</HI> bind
him over; he shakes his Cudgel at me.—What,
no Evidence for Love or Money!
Ha! <HI>Polypheme</HI> approaches, with his <HI>Cyclo∣pian</HI>
Eye! tie me under the Belly of a Ram.—I
cry you Mercy, a <HI>Misnomer. Trun∣nion</HI>
is the Man.—Spare me, spare me, good
Commodore! I own I have wronged you,
as well as your Nephew <HI>Peregrine,</HI> and his
Cousin <HI>Random.</HI>—I have robb'd them both,
and then raised a false Report against them.
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
—But my poor Conscience suffers for all.—
I have damned myself for the Sake of that
miscreant <HI>Scrag.</HI> O that I could see him
scragged in good Earnest!—Mercy! Mer∣cy!
I will find Bail.—Gentlemen, I plead
guilty.—Do'nt pickle me.—I shan't quit
Cost.—I am poor Carrion.—Don't you
perceive, I stink of Mortality.” Such is the
present Situation of this wretched Man. As
for his Aiders and Abettors, they were forth∣with
committed to the House of Correction;
and what is remarkable, <HI>Amelia</HI> and <HI>Booth,</HI>
at the very first, performed the Operation of
Milldolling, like Persons well skilled and
long experienced in that salubrious Ex∣ercise.</P>
<P>This being a fair and impartial Account
of the whole Transaction, I leave the World
to judge whether I have been to blame in
my Conduct towards the said <HI>Hilding,</HI> which
was purely the Result of Humanity and
Compassion; or whether the Wrath of God
and Man will not, in all probability, pursue
the infamous Authors of his Mishap, who
not contented with the Misery they have al∣ready
entailed upon him, have trumped up
a false and scandalous Account of certain
Victories which they pretend he obtained in
the above narrated Expedition; tho' they
took care to consult their own Safety, by
keeping themselves without the Reach of
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
that Tumult in which they had involv'd their
innocent Friend: But, doubtless, their De∣sign
is to impose upon that vain Lunatick,
with feigned Reports of his own Prowess,
that he may be incited to take the Field
again, and become subservient to their sordid
and unchristian Views of Interest and Re∣venge.</P>
<P>That the Father of Mercy would take
Pity on his deplorable Condition, and deliver
him, and all of us, from their perfidious Arts
and infernal Snares, is the fervent Prayer of
his unfeigned Wellwisher,</P>
