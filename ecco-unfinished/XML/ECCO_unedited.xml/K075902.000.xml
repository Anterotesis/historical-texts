<HEAD>PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY THE EDITOR.</BYLINE>
<P>HAVING, in the year seventeen hundred and seventy-six, put forth A HISTORY OF MUSIC, in five volumes quarto, (which buy) notwithdanding my then avocations, as Justice of the Peace for the county of Middlesex and city and liberty of Westminster, I, Sir John Hawkins, of Queen-square, Westminster, Knight, do now, being still of sound health and understanding, esteem it my bounden duty, to step forward as Editor and Reviser of THE PROBATIONARY ODES. My grand reason for undertaking so arduous a task is this; I do from my
<PB N="viii" REF="5"/>
soul believe that Lyric Poetry is the own, if not twin-sister of Music; wherefore, as I had before gathered together every thing that any way relates to the one, with what consistency could I forbear to collate the best effusions of the other?— I should premise that in volume the first of my quarto history, chap. I. p. 7, I lay it down as a principle never to be departed from, that
<Q>“The Lyric is the ”prototype of the fidicinal species.</Q>
And accordingly I have therein discussed at large both the origin, and various im∣provements of the Lyre; from the tor∣toise-shell scooped and strung by Mer∣cury, on the banks of the Nile, to the testudo exquisitely polished by Terpander, and exhibited to the Aegyptian Priests. I have added also many choice engravings of the various antique Lyres, viz. the Lyre of Goats-horns, the Lyre of Bulls-horns, the Lyre of Shells, and the Lyre of both Shells and Horns compounded; from all which, I flatter myself, I have indubitably proved the Lyre to be very
<PB N="ix" REF="6"/>
far superior to the Shank-bone of a Crane, or any other Pipe, Fistula, or Calamus, either of Orpheus's or Linus's invention; aye, or even the best of those pulsatile instruments commonly known by the denomination of the drum.</P>
<P>Forasmuch, therefore, as all this was finally proved and established by my History of Music, I say I hold it now no alien task to somewhat turn my thoughts to the late divine specimens of Lyric Minstrelsy. For although I may be deemed the legal Guardian of MUSIC alone, and consequently not in strictness bound to any further duty than that of her immediate Wardship; (See Burn's Justice, article Guardian:) yet surely in equity and liberal feeling, I cannot but think myself very forcibly incited to ex∣tend this tutelage to her next of kin; in which degree I hold every individual follower of THE LYRIC MUSIC, but more especially all such part of them as have devoted, or do devote their strains to the celebration of those best of themes,
<PB N="x" REF="7"/>
the Reigning King and the current year —Or in other words, of all Citharistae Regis, Versificatores Coronae, Court Poets, or as we now term them Poets Laureate. —Pausanias tells us, that it pleased the God of Poets himself by an express Oracle, to order the inhabitants of Del∣phi to set a part for Pindar one half of the first-fruit offerings, brought by the religious to his shrine, and to allow him a place in his temple, where in an <HI>iron</HI> chair, he was used to set and sing his <HI>hymns</HI> in honour of that God. Would to heaven that the Bench of Bishops would, in some degree, adopt this ex∣cellent idea—or at least that the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, and the other Managers of the Abbey Music meetings, would in future allot the oc∣casional vacancies of Madam Mara's seat in the Cathedral Orchestra, for the re∣ception of the Reigning Laureat, during the performance of that favourite con∣stitutional ballad, "May the King live for ever." It must be owned, however,
<PB N="xi" REF="8"/>
that the Laureatship is already a very kingly settlement; one hundred a year, together with a tierce of canary, or a butt of sack, are surely most princely endowments, for the honour of litera∣ture, and the advancement of political genius. And hence (thank God and the King for it) there scarcely ever has been wanting some great and good man, both willing and able to supply so im∣portant a charge.—At one time we find that great immortal genius, Mr. Tho∣mas Shadwell, (better known by the name of Og and Mac Flacknoe) chaunt∣ing the prerogative praises of that blessed Aera.—At a nearer period, we observe the whole force of Colley Cibber's ge∣nius, devoted to the labours of the same reputable employment.—And finally, in the example of a Whitehead's Muse, expatiating on the virtues of our gra∣cious Sovereign; have we not beheld the best of Poets, in the best of verses, do∣ing ample justice to the best of Kings? —The fire of Lyric Poesy, the rapid
<PB N="xii" REF="9"/>
lightning of modern Pindarics, were equally required to record the Virtues of the Stuarts, or to immortalize the Ta∣lents of a Brunswick.—On either them there was ample subject for the boldest flights of inventive genius, the full scope for the most daring powers of poetical creation; from the free unfettered strain of liberty, in honour of Charles the First, to the kindred Genius and congenial Talents that immortalize the wisdom and the worth of George the Third.— But on no occasion has the ardour for prerogative panegyrics so conspicuously flamed forth, as on the late Election for succeeding to Mr. Whitehead's honours. To account for this unparalleled struggle, let us recollect that the ridiculous re∣forms of the late Parliament having cut off many gentlemanly offices, it was a necessary consequence that the few which were spared became objects of rather more emulation than usual. Besides, there is a decency and regularity in pro∣ducing, at fixed and certain periods of
<PB N="xiii" REF="10"/>
the year, the same settled quantity of metre on the same unalterable subjects, which cannot fail to give a particular attraction to the Office of the Laureat∣ship, at a crisis like the present.—It is admitted, that we are now in possession of much sounder judgment, and more regulated taste than our ancestors had any idea of; and hence does it not im∣mediately follow, that the occupancy of a political office, which, from its uni∣formity of subject and limitation of du∣ty, precludes all hasty extravagance of style, as well as any plurality of efforts, is sure to be a more pleasing object than ever to gentlemen of regular habits and a becoming degree of literary indolence. Is it not evident too, that in composi∣tions of this kind, all fermentation of thought is certain in a very short time to subside and settle into mild and gentle composition—till at length the possessors of this grave and orderly office, prepare their stipulated return of metre, by as proportionate and gradual exertions, as
<PB N="xiv" REF="11"/>
many other classes of industrious tenants provide for the due payment of their particular rents. Surely it is not too much to say, that the business of Lau∣reat to his Majesty, is, under such pro∣vision, to the full as ingenious, reputable, and as regular a trade, as that of Al∣manack Maker to the Stationers Com∣pany.—The contest therefore for so ex∣cellent an office, having been warmer in the late instance than at any preceding period, is perfectly to be accounted for; especially too at a time, when, from nobler causes, the Soul of Genius may reasonably be supposed to kindle into uncommon enthusiasm, at a train of new and unexampled prodigies. In an age of Reform; beneath the mild sway of a British Augustus; under the Mi∣nistry of a pure immaculated Youth; the Temple of Janus shut; the Trade of Otaheite open; not an angry Ameri∣can to be heard of, except the Lottery Loyalists; the fine Arts in full Glory; Sir William Chambers the Royal Archi∣tect;
<PB N="xv" REF="12"/>
Lord Sydney a Cabinet Minister! What a golden Aera! From this auspi∣cious moment, Peers, Bishops, Baronets, Methodists, Members of Parliament, Chaplains, all genuine Beaux Esprits, all legitimate Heirs of Parnassus, rush forward with unfeigned ardour, to de∣light the world by the united efforts of liberal genius and constitutional loyalty. The illustrious Candidates assemble— the wisest of Earls sits as Judge—the archest of Bussos becomes his assessor— the Odes are read—the Election is deter∣mined—how justly it is not for us to decide. To the great Tribunal of the Public, the whole of this important con∣test is now submitted.—Every document that can illustrate, every testimony that tends to support the respective merit of the Probationers, is impartially commu∣nicated to the World of Letters.—Even the Editor of such a collection, may hope for some reversionary same from the humble, but not inglorious task, of col∣lecting the scattered rays of Genius.—
<PB N="xvi" REF="13"/>
At the eve of a long laborious life, de∣voted to a Sister Muse, (vide my History, printed for T. Payne and Son, at the Mews Gate) possibly it may not wholly appear an irregular vanity, if I some∣times have entertained a hope, that my tomb may not want the sympathetic re∣cord of Poetry.—I avow my motive.—</P>
<P>It is with this expectation I appear as an Editor on the present occasion.—The Authors whose Compositions I collect for public notice are twenty-two. The odds of survivorship, according to Doc∣tor Price are, that thirteen of these will outlive me, myself being in class III. of his ingenious tables.—Surely there∣fore, it is no mark of that sanguine dis∣position which my enemies have been pleased to ascribe to me, that I deem it possible that some one of the same thir∣teen, will requite my protection of their harmonious effusions with a strain of elegiac gratitude, saying, possibly (par∣don me, ye Survivors that may be, for presuming to hint the thought to minds
<PB N="xvii" REF="14"/>
so richly fraught as your's are) saying, I say,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE FOLLOWING excellent observations on the Lyric style, have been kindly communicated to the Editor by the Rev. Thomas Warton—They appear to have been taken almost verbatim from several of the former works of that ingenious author; but chiefly from his late edition of <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>Minora</HI>. We sincerely hope, therefore, that they may serve the double purpose of enriching the present collection, and of attracting the public attention to that very critical work from which they are principally extracted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON ODE WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>ΩΔΗ, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Carmen, Cantus, Can∣tilena, Chanson, Canzone, all signify what Anglicè we denominate ODE— Among the Greeks, <HI>Pindar</HI>; among the Latins, <HI>Horace</HI>; with the Italians, <HI>Pe∣trarch</HI>; with the French, <HI>Boileau</HI>; are the principes hujusce scientiae—Tom Killigrew took the lead in English Lyrics; and indeed, till our own <HI>Mason</HI>, was nearly unrivalled—<HI>Josephus Miller</HI> too hath penned something of the Odaic, <HI>inter</HI>
<PB N="xix" REF="16"/>
his <HI>Opera Minora</HI>. My grandfather had a MS. Ode on a Gillyflower, the which, as our family had it, was an <HI>esquisse</HI> of Gammer Gurton's: and I myself have seen various Cantilenes of <HI>Stephen Duck</HI>'s of a pure relish—Of Shadwell, time hath little impaired the fame—Colley's Bays rust cankereth not—Dr. Casaubon mea∣sures the Strophe by Anapaests—In the Polyglott, the epitrotus primus is the metrimensura.—I venture to recommend, "Waly, waly, up the bank," as no bad model of the pure Trochaics—There is also a little simple strain, commencing "Saw ye my father, saw ye my mother;" which, to my fancy, gives an excellent ratio of hendecassyllables.—Dr. Warton indeed prefers the Adonic, as incomparably the neatest, ay, and the newest <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—A notion too has prevailed, that the Black Joke, as <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, is not the "cosa detta in prosa mai, ne in rima;" whereas the <HI>Deva Cestrensis</HI>, or Chevy Chase, according to Dr. Joseph Warton, is the exemplar of,
<Q><PB N="xx" REF="17"/>
<L>Trip and go</L>
<L>Heave and hoe,</L>
<L>Up and down,</L>
<L>To and fro.</L></Q>
Vide Nashe's Summer's Last Will and Testament, 1600.</P>
<P>I observe, that Ravishment is a fa∣vourite word with Milton, Parad. Lost, B. V. 46. Again, B. IX. 541. Again, Com. V. 245.—Spenser has it also in Astrophel, st. 7.—Wherefore I earnestly recommend early rising to all minor Poets, as far better than sleeping to con∣coct surfeits. Vid. Apology for Smectym∣nuus.—For the listening to Throstles or Thrushes, awaking the <HI>lustless</HI> Sun, is an unreproved or innocent pastime: As also are <HI>cranks</HI>, by which I understand cross purposes. Vid. my Milton, 41.—
<Q>“Fill∣”ing a wife with a daughter fair,</Q>
is not an unclassical notion (Vid. my Milton, 39.) if, according to Sir Richard Brath∣waite,
<Q>“She had a dimpled chin, made ”for love to lodge within, (vid. my
<PB N="xxi" REF="18"/>
Milton, 41.) "While the <HI>cock</HI>," vid. the same, 44.</Q>
—Indeed,
<Q>“My mother said ”I could be no <HI>lad</HI>, till I was twentye,</Q> is a passage I notice in my Milton with a view to this; which see; and therein also of a shepherdess, "<HI>taking the tale</HI>." —'Twere well likewise if Bards learned the Rebeck, or Rebible, being a species of Fiddle; for it solaceth the fatigued spirit much; though, to say the truth, we have it, 'tis present death for Fiddlers to tune their Rebecks, or Rebibles, be∣fore the great Turk's grace. However, <HI>Middleton</HI>'s <HI>Game of Chess</HI> is good for a Poet to peruse, having quaint phrases fitting <HI>to be married to immortal verse</HI>. JOSHUA POOLE, of Clare-hall, I also re∣commend as an apt guide for an alumnus of the Muse—Joshua edited a choice Parnassus 1657, in the which I find many "delicious, mellow hangings" of poesy—He is undoubtedly a
<Q>“sonorous ”dactylist</Q>
—and to him I add Mr. Jenner, Proctor of the Commons, and Commissary of St. Paul's, who is a gen∣tleman
<PB N="xxii" REF="19"/>
of indefatigable politeness, in opening the Archives of a Chapter-house, for the delectation of a sound critic. <HI>Tottell</HI>'s <HI>Songs and Sonnetts of un∣certain Auct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures</HI> is likewise a <HI>butful</HI>, or plenteous work. I conclude with assur∣ing the Public, that my brother remem∣bers to have heard my father tell his (i. e. my brother's) first wife's second cousin, that he once at Magdalene Col∣lege, Oxford, had it explained to him, that the famous passage,
<Q>“His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two ”bushels of chaff,</Q>
has no sort of re∣ference to verbal criticism and stale quo∣tations.</P>

<HEAD>RECOMMENDATORY TESTIMONIES.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>ACCORDING to the old and laudable usage of Editors, we shall now present our Readers with judgments of the learned concerning our Poets.— These Testimonies, if they proceed from critical pens, cannot fail to have due influence on all im∣partial observers.—They <HI>pass</HI> an Author from one end of the kingdom to the other, as rapidly as the pauper Certificates of Magistracy.—Indeed, it were much to be wished, that as we have no State Licenser of Poetry, it might at least be made penal, to put forth rhymes without pre∣viously producing a certain number of sureties for their goodness and utility; which precaution, if assisted with a few other regulations, such as re∣quiring all Practitioners in Verse to take out a License, in the manner of many other Dealers in Spirits, &amp;c. could not fail to introduce good order among this class of Authors, and also to bring in a handsome sum towards the aid of the public revenue.—Happy indeed will be those Bards, who are supplied with as reputable vouchers as those which are here subjoined.</P>

I took the proper measures for this <HI>tête-à-tête</HI> between my two <HI>naturals</HI>, as I call this uneducated couple.—It succeeded beyond my utmost hopes.—For the first ten minutes they exchanged a world of simple observations on the different spe∣cies of the brute creation, to which each had most obligations.—Lactilla praised her Cows—Sir Joseph his Hogs.—An artless eclogue, my dear madam, but warm from the heart.—At last the Muse took her turn on the <HI>tapis</HI> of simple dialogue.—In an instant both kindled into all the fervors, the delightful fer∣vors, that are better imagined than de∣scribed

<P>"I WAS sitting one evening, (as in∣deed I was wont to do, when out of cash,) astride the ballustrade of Westmin∣ster-bridge, with my favourite little dog under my arm. I had that day parted with my diamond wind-mill.—Life was never very dear to me—but a thousand thoughts then rushed into my heart, to jump this world, and spring into eternity.—I de∣termined that my faithful Pompey should bear me company.—I pressed him close, and actually stretched out, fully resolved to plunge into the stream; when luckily (ought I to call it so?) that charming fellow, (for such he then was) <HI>Sir Cecil Wray</HI>, catching hold of <HI>Pompey</HI>'s tail, pulled him back, and with him pulled back me.—In a moment I found myself in a clean hackney-coach, drawn by gray horses, with a remarkable civil
<PB N="xxviii" REF="25"/>
coachman, fainting in my Cecil's arms; and though I then lost a little diamond pin, yet (contrary to what, I hear, has been asserted) I NEVER prosecuted that gallant Baronet; who, in less than a fortnight after, with his usual wit and genius, dispatched me the following extempore poem:
<Q><L>While you prepar'd, dear Anne, on Styx to sail—</L>
<L>Lo! one dog sav'd you by another's tail.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which, in little more than a month, I penned, and sent the following reply:

<HEAD>Testimony of the great Parts of <HI>CON∣STANTINE, LORD MULGRAVE,</HI> and his Brethren. MR. BOSWELL.</HEAD>
<P>AMONG those who will vote for continuing the old established number of our Session Justices, may I not count
<PB N="xxix" REF="26"/>
on the tribe of <HI>Phipps</HI>—they love good places, and I know <HI>Mulgrave</HI> is a bit of a poet as well as myself, for I dined in company once where he dined that very day twelvemonth.—My excellent wife, who is a true Montgomery, and whom I like now as well as I did 20 years ago, adores the man who felt for the maternal pangs of a whelpless bear.—For my own part, however, there is no action I more constantly ridicule, than his Lordship's preposterous pity for those very sufferings which he himself occasioned, by ordering his sailors to shoot the young bear.— But though <HI>I</HI> laugh at <HI>him</HI>, how hand∣some will it be if <HI>he</HI> votes against Dun∣das to oblige <HI>me</HI>.—My disliking him and his family is no reason for his disliking me—on the contrary, if he opposes us, is it not probable that that great young man, whom I sincerely adore, may say, in his own lofty language, "Mulgrave, Mulgrave, don't vex the Scotch—don't provoke 'em, God damn your ugly head —if we don't crouch to Bute, we shall all

<P>My principles are now pretty univer∣sally known; but on this occasion I will repeat them succinctly.—I believe from the bottom of my soul, that all mankind are absolute Ouran Outangs.—That the

feudal tenures are the great cause of our not retaining the perfect appearance of Ourans.—That human beings origi∣nally moved on all fours—That we had better move in the same way again—That there have been Giants ninety feet high —That such Giants ought to have moved on all fours—That we all continue to be Ouran Outangs still—some more so— some less—but that Nathaniel William Wraxall, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> is the truest Ouran Outang in Great-Britain, and therefore ought immediately to take to all fours, and especially to make all his motions in Parliament in that way.</P>

<HEAD>A FULL AND TRUE ACCOUNT OF THE Rev. THOMAS WARTON's Ascension FROM CHRIST-CHURCH MEADOW, OXFORD,</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>(In the Balloon of James Sadler, Pastry-Cook to the said University) on Friday, the 20th of May, 1785, for the Purpose of composing a sublime ODE in Honour of his Majesty's Birth-Day; attested before JOHN WEYLAND, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of his Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of Oxford <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It cannot fail to attract the Reader's particular attention to this very curious piece, to inform him, that Signor Delpini's decision in favour of Mr. Warton, was chiefly grounded on the new and ex∣traordinary style of writing herein attested.</NOTE>.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LETTER>
<P>IT was in obedience to the advice of my brother, Dr. Joseph Warton, that I came to a determination on the 5th of May ult. to compose my first. Birth-day
<PB N="xxxix" REF="36"/>
Ode, at the elevation of one mile above the earth, in the Balloon of my inge∣nious friend Mr. James Sadler of this city. Accordingly, having agreed for the same, at a very moderate rate per hour, (I paying all charge of inflating, and standing to repairs) at nine in the morning, on Friday, the 20th of said month, I repaired to Christ-church Mea∣dow, with my ballast, provisions, cat, Speaking-Trumpet, and other necessaries. —It was my first design to have invited Dr. Joseph to have ascended with me; but apprehending the malicious construc∣tion that might follow on this, as if, forsooth, my intended Ode was to be a joint production, I e'en made up my mind to mount alone.—My provisions principally consisted of a small pot of stewed prunes, and half of a plain diet-bread cake, both prepared and kindly presented to me by the same ingenious hand which had fabricated the Balloon.— I had also a small subsidiary stock, viz. a loaf of Sandwiches, three bottles of
<PB N="xl" REF="37"/>
old ale, a pint of brandy, a sallad ready mixed, a roll of collar'd eel, a cold goose, six damson tartlets, a few China oranges, and a roasted pig of the Chinese breed; together with a small light baro∣meter, and proper store of writing uten∣sils, but no note, memorandum, nor loose hint of any kind. So help me God!—My ascension was majestic, to an uncommon degree of tardiness. I was soon constrained therefore to lighten my Balloon, by throwing out some part of my ballast, which consisted of my own History of Poetry, my late edition of Milton's Minora, my Miscellaneous Verses, Odes, Sonnets, Elegies, Inscrip∣tions, Monodies, and Complaints; my Observations on Spenser, the King's last Speech, and Lord Mountmorres's pam∣phlet on the Irish Resolutions. On throwing out his Lordship's Essay, the Balloon sprung up surprisingly; but the weight of my provisions, still retarding the elevation, I was fain to part with both volumes of my Spenser, and all of
<PB N="xli" REF="38"/>
my last edition of Poems, except those that are marked with an asterisk, as never before printed: which very quickly ac∣celerated my ascension—I now found the barometer had fallen four inches and six lines in eight minutes.—In less than eleven minutes after, I had ascended very considerably indeed, the barometer having then fallen near seventeen inches; and presently after I entered a thick black cloud, which I have since found render∣ed me wholly obscure to all observation. In this situation I lost no time to begin my Ode; and accordingly, in the course of 25 minutes, I produced the very lines which now commence it. The judicious critic will notice, that absence of the plain and trite style which mark the pas∣sage I refer to; nor am I so uncandid to deny the powerful efficacy of mist, dark∣ness, and obscurity, on the sublime and mysterious topics I there touch on: It cannot fail also to strike the intelligent observer, that the expression so much commented on, of "<HI>No echoing car</HI>," was
<PB N="xlii" REF="39"/>
obviously suggested by that very car in which I myself was then seated—Finding however that, together with the increased density of the overshadowing cloud, the coldness also was proportionably in∣creased, so as at one time to freeze my ink completely over, for near 20 minutes, I thought it prudent, by means of open∣ing the valve at the vertex of my Bal∣loon, to emit part of the ascending power. This occasioned a proportionate descent very speedily: but I must not overlook a phaenomenon which had pre∣viously occurred—It was this: On a sudden the nibs of all my pens (and I took up 48, in compliment to the num∣ber of my Sovereign's years) as if at∣tracted by a polar power, pointed up∣wards, each pen erecting itself perpen∣dicularly, and resting on the point of its feather. I found also, to my no small surprize, that, during the whole of this period, every one of my letters were actually cut topsy-turvy wise; which I the rather mention, to account for any
<PB N="xliii" REF="40"/>
appearance of a correspondent inversion in the course of my ideas at that period.</P>
<P>On getting nearer the earth, the ap∣pearances I have described altogether ceased, and I instantly penned the second division of my Ode, I mean that which states his most excellent Majesty to be the patron of the fine arts. But here (for which I am totally at a loss to ac∣count) I found myself descending so very rapidly, that even after I had thrown out not only two volumes of my History of Poetry, but also a considerable portion of my pig, I struck, nevertheless, with such violence on the weather-cock of a church, that unless I had immediately parted with the remainder of my ballast, excepting only his Majesty's Speech, one pen, the paper of my Ode, and a small ink-bottle, I must infallibly have been aground. For∣tunately, by so rapid a discharge, I pro∣cured a quick re-ascension: when im∣mediately, though much pinched with the cold, the Mercury having suddenly fallen 22 inches, I set about my con∣cluding

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="xliv" REF="43"/>
stanza, viz. that which treats of his Majesty's most excellent chastity. And here I lay my claim to the indul∣gence of the critics to that part of my Ode; for what with the shock I had re∣ceived in striking on the weather-cock, and the effect of the prunes which I had now nearly exhausted, on a sudden I found myself very much disordered in∣deed. Candour required my just touch∣ing on this circumstance, but delicacy must veil the particulars in eternal obli∣vion. At length, having completed the great object of my ascent, I now re∣opened the valve, and descended with great rapidity. They only who have travelled in Balloons, can imagine the sincere joy of my heart, at perceiving Dr. Joseph cantering up a turnip-field near Kidlington-common, where I landed ex∣actly at a quarter after two o'clock; having, from my first elevation, com∣pleted the period of five hours and fifteen minutes; four of which, with the fraction of ten seconds, were entirely devoted to
<PB N="xlv" REF="44"/>
my Ode.—Dr. Joseph quite hugged me in his arms, and kindly lent me a second wig, (my own being thrown over at the time of my striking) which, with his usual precaution, he had brought in his pocket, in case of accidents. I take this occasion also to pay my thanks to Thomas Gore, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for some excellent milk∣punch, which he directed his butler to furnish me with most opportunely; and which I then thought the most solacing beverage I ever had regaled withal. Dr. Joseph and myself reached Oxford in the Dilly by five in the evening, the po∣pulace most handsomely taking off the horses for something more than the last half mile, in honour of the first Literary Areonaut of these kingdoms—</P>

<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hail to the lyar.] It was suggested to me, that my friend the Doctor, had here followed the example of Voltaire, in deviating from common orthography.—<HI>Lyar</HI> instead of <HI>Lyre</HI>, he conceives to be a reading of peculiar elegance in the present instance, as it puts the reader in suspence between an inanimate and a living instrument. However, for my own part, I am rather of opinion, that this seeming mis-spelling arose from the Doctor's following the same well-known circumspection which he exercised in the case of Mr. Wedgwood, and declining to give his ode <HI>under his hand</HI>; pre∣ferring to repeat it to Mr. Delpini's Amanuensis, who very probably may have committed that, and similar errors in orthography.</NOTE>Hail to the LYAR, whose all persuasive strain,</L>

Wrinkles are as frequently produced by the motion of the part as by the advance of age. The head of the dis∣tinguished personage here described, though in the prime of its faculties, has had more exercise in every sense than any head in the world. Whether he means any allusion to the worship of the rising sun, and imitates the Persian priests, whose grand act of devotion is to turn round; or whether he merely thinks that the working of the head in circles will give analogous effect to the species of argument in which he excels, we must remain in the dark; but certain it is, that whenever he reasons in public, the <HI>capital</HI> and wonderful part of his frame I am alluding to, is continually revolving upon its axis; and his eyes, as if dazzled with rays that dart on him exclusively, twinkle in their orbs at the rate of sixty twinks to one revolution.

Mr. Banks's testimony was also solicited to the same effect; but he had left off vouching for the present session. Mr. Pepper Arden, indeed, with the most intrepid liberality, engaged to find authority for it in the statutes at large: on which Signor Delpini, with his usual terseness of repartee, instantly exclaimed, Ha! ha! ha! How∣ever, the difficulty was at length obviated by an observation of the noble Lord who presided, that in the case of the King versus At∣kinson, the House of Lords had established the right of judges to amend a record, as Mr. Quarme had informed his Lordship im∣mediately after his having voted for that decision.</P>

All the editors of Horace have hitherto read <HI>adjectis</HI> Britannis. Our author, as sound a critic as a divine, <HI>suo periculo</HI> makes the alteration of a single letter, and thereby gives a new and peculiar force to the application of the passage.—N. B. <HI>Abject</HI>, in the author's understanding of the word, means that precise degree of submission due from a free people to monarchy. It is further wor∣thy remark, that Horace wrote the ode alluded to, before Britain was subjected to absolute sway; and consequently the passage was meant as a prophetic compliment to Augustus. Those who do not think that Britain is yet sufficiently <HI>abject</HI>, will regard the imitation in the same light. We shall close this subject by observing, how much better GRAVIBUS applies in the imitation than in the original; and how well the untruth of Ierne's volunteers joining in the deifica∣tion, exemplifies the dedicatory address of the lie SUBLIME.</P></NOTE><HI>Bishops and Lords of the Bedchamber.</HI></L>

<HEAD>N<SUP>o</SUP> XXII. PROBATIONARY ODES,</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>AGREEABLY to the request of the Right Reve∣rend Author, the following Ode is admitted into this collection; and I think it but justice to de∣clare, that I have diligently scanned it on my fin∣gers; and, after repeated trials, to the best of my knowledge, believe the Metre to be of the Iambic kind, containing three, four, five, and six feet in one line, with the occasional addition of the hy∣percatalectic syllable at stated periods. I am there∣fore of opinion, that the composition is certainly verse; though I would not wish to pronounce too confidently. For further information I shall print his Grace's letter</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR JOHN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I understand you are publishing an authentic Edition of the Probationary Odes, I call upon you to do me the justice of inserting the enclosed. It was rejected on the Scrutiny by Signor Delpini, for
<PB N="105" REF="144"/>
reasons which must have been suggested by the male∣volence of some rival. These reasons were, 1st, That the Ode was nothing but prose written in an odd man∣ner; and, 2dly, that the metre, if there be any, as well as many of the thoughts, are stolen from a little Poem in a Collection, called the UNION. To a man, blest with an ear so delicate as your's, Sir John, I think it unnecessary to say any thing on the first charge; and as to the second, (would you believe it?) the Poem from which I am accused of stealing, is my own. Surely an Author has a right to make free with his own ideas, especially when, if they were ever known, they have long since been forgot∣ten by his readers. You are not to learn, Sir John, that <HI>de non apparentibus &amp; non existentibus cadem est ratio:</HI> and nothing but the active spirit of literary jealousy, could have dragged forth my former Ode from the obscurity, in which it has long slept, to the disgrace of all good taste in the present age. How∣ever, that you and the public may see, how little I have really taken, and how much I have opened the thoughts, and improved the language of that little, I send you <HI>my Imitations of myself</HI>, as well as some few explanatory Notes, necessary to elucidate my classical and historical allusions.</P>

<P>ON Sunday the 17th of the present month, to wit, July, Anno Domini, 1785, just as his Majesty was ascending the stairs of his gallery, to attend divine worship at WINDSOR, he was surprized by the
<PB N="116" REF="155"/>
appearance of a little thick, squat, red-faced man, who in a very odd dress, and kneeling upon one knee, presented a piece of paper for the Royal acceptation. His Majesty amazed at the sight of such a figure in such a place, had already given orders to one of the attendant beef-eaters to dismiss him from his presence, when by a certain hasty spasmodic mumbling, together with two or three prompt quo∣tations from Virgil, the person was dis∣covered to be no other than the Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Warton</HI> himself, dressed in the official vesture of his professorshi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the paper which he held in his hand being nothing else but a fair written pe∣tition, designed for the inspection of his Majesty, our gracious sovereign made up for the seeming rudeness of the first reception, by a hearty embrace on re∣cognition; and the contents of the pe∣tition being forthwith examined, were found to be pretty nearly as follows.— We omit the common place compliments generally introduced in the exordia of
<PB N="117" REF="156"/>
these applications, as "relying upon your Majesty's well known clemency;" "convinced of your Royal regard for the real interest of your subjects," "pe∣netrated with the fullest conviction of your wisdom and justice," &amp;c. &amp;c. which, though undoubtedly very true, when considered as addressed to George the Third, <HI>might</HI> perhaps, as matters of mere form, be applied to a Sovereign, who neither had proved wisdom nor re∣gard for his subjects in one act of his reign, and proceed to the substance and matter of the complaint itself. It sets forth,
<Q>“That the Petitioner, Mr. <HI>Thomas</HI>, had been many years a maker of Poetry, as his friend Mr. <HI>Sadler</HI>, the pastry-cook of Oxford, and some other creditable witnesses could well evince; that many of his works of fancy, and more particularly that one, which is known by the name of his <HI>Criticisms upon Milton</HI>, had been well received by the learned; that thus encouraged, he had entered the list, together with
<PB N="118" REF="157"/>
many other great and respectable can∣didates, for the honour of a succession to the vacant <HI>Laureateship</HI>; that a de∣cided return had been made in his favour by the officers best calculated to judge, namely, the Right Hon. the Earl of S— and the learned <HI>Signor Delpini</HI>, his Lordship's worthy co∣adjutor; that the Signor's delicacy, unhappily for the Petitioner, like that of Mr. <HI>Corbett</HI>, in the instance of the Westminster election, had inclined him to the grant of a SCRUTINY; that in consequence of the vexatious and per∣tinacious perseverance on the part of several gentlemen in this illegal and oppressive measure, the Petitioner had been severely injured in his spirits, his comforts, and his interest: that he had been for many years engaged in a most laborious and expensive under∣taking, in which he had been honoured with the most liberal communications from all the Universities in Europe, to wit, a splendid and most correct edi∣tion
<PB N="119" REF="158"/>
of the <HI>Poemata Minora</HI>, of the immortal Mr. <HI>Stephen Duck</HI>; that he was also under positive articles of lite∣rary partnership with his brother, the learned and well-known Dr. <HI>Joseph</HI>, to supply two pages per day in his new work, now in the press, entitled his Essay <HI>on the life and writings</HI> of Mr. THOMAS HICKATHRIFT; in both of which great undertakings, the pro∣gress had been most essentially inter∣rupted by the great anxiety and distress of mind, under which the Petitioner has for some time laboured, on account of this inequitable scrutiny; that the Petitioner is bound by his honour and his engagement to prepare a new Ode for the birth-day of her most gracious Majesty, which he is very desirous of executing with as much poetry, per∣spicuity, and originality, as are uni∣versally allowed to have characterised his last effusion, in honour of the Natal Anniversary of his Royal Master's sacred self; that there are but six
<PB N="120" REF="159"/>
months to come for such a prepara∣tion, and that the Petitioner has got no farther yet than "Hail Muse!" in the first stanza, which very much inclines him to fear he shall not be able to finish the whole in the short period above-mentioned, unless his Majesty should be graciously pleased to order some of his Lords of the Bed-chamber to assist him, or should com∣mand a termination to the vexatious enquiry now pending.

D. to be our true and only legal Laureate Poet and Poetaster, that is to say, to pen, write, compose, transpose, select, dictate, compile, indite, invent, design, steal, put together, transcribe, frame, fabricate, manufacture, make, join, build, scrape, grub, collect, vamp, find, discover, catch, smuggle, pick up, beg, borrow, or buy in the same manner and with the same privileges as have been usually practised, and heretofore enjoyed by every other Laureate, whether by our Sacred self ap∣pointed, or by our Royal predecessors, who now dwell with their fathers: And for this purpose, to produce, deliver, chaunt, or sing, as in our wisdom afore∣said we shall judge proper, at the least three good and substantial Odes, in the best English or German verse, in every year, that is to say, one due and proper Ode on the Nativity of our blessed Self; one due and proper Ode on the Nativity of our dearest and best beloved Royal
<PB N="125" REF="164"/>
Consort, for the time being; and also one due and proper Ode on the day of the Nativity of every future Year, of which God grant We may see many.—And we do hereby most strictly command and enjoin, that no Scholar, Critic, Wit, Orthographer, or Scribbler, shall, by gibes, sneers, jests, judgments, quibbles, or criticisms, molest, interrupt, incom∣mode, disturb, or confound the said Thomas Warton, or break the peace of his orderly, quiet, pains-taking and in∣offensive Muse, in the said exercise of his said duty.—And We do hereby will and direct, that if any of the person or persons aforesaid, notwithstanding our said absolute and positive command, shall be found offending against this our Royal Proclamation, that he, she, or they be∣ing duly convicted, shall, for every such crime and misdemeanor, be punished in the manner and form following, to wit, —For the first offence he shall be drawn on a sledge to the most conspicuous and notorious part of our ever faithful city
<PB N="126" REF="165"/>
of London, and shall then and there, with an audible voice, pronounce, read, and deliver three several printed speeches of our right trusty and approved MAJOR JOHN SCOTT.—For the second offence, that he be required to translate into good and lawful English one whole unspoken speech of our right trusty and well beloved cousin and counsellor Lord Vis. MOUNT∣MORRES, of the kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI>;— and for the third offence, that he be condemned to read one whole page of the Poems, Essays, or Criticisms of our said Laureate Mr. Thomas Warton.— And whereas the said office of Laureate is a place of the last importance, inas∣much as the person holding it has con∣fided to him the care of making the Royal virtues known to the world; and we being minded and desirous that the said T. Warton should execute and perform the duties of his said office with the utmost dignity and decorum, NOW KNOW YE, That we have thought it meet to draw up a due and proper Table of Instructions,
<PB N="127" REF="166"/>
hereunto annexed, for the use of the said Thomas Warton, in his said poetical exercise and employment, which we do hereby most strictly will and enjoin the said Thomas Warton to abide by and follow, under pain of incurring our most high displeasure.</P>

<DATE><HI>May</HI> 30<HI>th</HI>, 1785.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1st. THAT in fabricating the cata∣logue of Regal Virtues (in which task the Poet may much assist his invention by perusing the Odes of his several pre∣decessors) you be particularly careful not to omit his Chastity, his Skill in Me∣chanics, and his Royal Talent of Child-getting.—</P>
<P N="2">2dly, It is expected that you should be very liberally endowed with the gift of Prophecy; but be very careful not to predict any event but what may be per∣fectly acceptable to your Sovereign, such as the subjugation of America, the de∣struction of the Whigs, long-life, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="129" REF="168"/>3dly, That you be always provided with a due assortment of true, good-looking, and legitimate words, and that you do take all necessary care not to ap∣ply them but on their proper occasions; as for example, not to talk of dove-eyed peace, nor the gentle olive, in time of war; nor of trumpets, drums, fifes, nor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is evident from this expression, that these instructions had not been delivered to Mr. Warton, at the time of his writing his last famous Ode on the Birth-day of his Majesty; a circumstance which makes that amazing Composer still more extraor∣dinary.</NOTE> ECHOING CARS in time of peace—as for the sake of poetical conveniency, several of your predecessors have been known to do.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, That as the Sovereign for the time being must always be the best, the greatest, and the wisest, that ever existed, so the year also for the time being must also be the happiest, the mildest, the fairest, and the most prolific that ever occurred.—What reflections upon the year past you think proper.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="130" REF="169"/>5thly, That Music being a much higher and diviner science than Poetry, your Ode must always be adapted to the Music, and not the Music to your Ode. —The omission of a line or two cannot be supposed to make any material diffe∣rence either in the poetry or in the sense.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, That as these sort of invitations have of late years been considered by the Muses as mere cards of compliment, and of course have been but rarely accepted, you must not waste more than twenty lines in invoking the Nine, nor repeat the word Hail more than fifteen times at farthest.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, and finally, That it may not be amiss to be a little intelligible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an additional proof, that Mr. Warton had not received the Instructions at the time he composed his said Ode.</NOTE>.</P>
