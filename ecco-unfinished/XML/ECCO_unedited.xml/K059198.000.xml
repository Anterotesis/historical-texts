<P>WHEN Heroick Vertue presents it self to our View in such a conspicuous Character as Your <HI>Ladiships,</HI> 'tis impossible to be silent, tho' we can never hope to Express the beautiful Excellence, whilst on a barren Theme Invention might be wanting; Your <HI>Ladiship's</HI> Life speaks it self, and to give a bare Relation of Your Actions is a <HI>Panegyrick.</HI> That unalterable Fidi∣lity to your Lord, and constant Suffering with him; That unshaken Resolution of preserving his Name and Memory entire, and that generous and tender regard of his Rela∣tions, gives an <HI>Idea</HI> of those Noble <HI>Roman Wives,</HI> whose exalted Merit, in every Change of Life, was still the same, Triumphant in Adversity, and Constant in Prosperity; tho' I want▪ Skill to give the Praises due to such <HI>Divine Perfe∣ctions;</HI> Yet I hope at least this may Excite some

<P>I blush to lay so mean a Trifle at the Feet of so Nice a Judge, but 'tis the Prerogative of the Great to protect the most Distress'd: Let its Defects be made up with the profound Respect and Zeal the Author has for Your <HI>Ladyship,</HI> and the endless Wishes made for Your continual Happiness, that you may live to see Your Charming Son long possess his Honour, and increase That <HI>Race</HI> which always Adorn'd our Kingdom, that all Felicities may constantly attend the Series of Your <HI>Noble Life.</HI> This and much more than can be Exprest, is the Prayer of</P>

<P>I would not Marry in Earnest for the Universe; a Married Woman is never trusted with a Secret, and I could not live without know∣ing all the Secrets of the Town, and then perhaps the Fellow I gave the Privilege to call me Wife, would grow Insolent, and be Jealous, tho' he only Married me to Cheat my Children, and that I can do better my self, and therefore am resolv'd to be Absolute.—</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. PORTER.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>LOng have we suffer'd, and the injur'd Stage</L>
<L>Labour'd beneath the Censure of the Age:</L>
<L>We own our Faults, and pardon crave to day,</L>
<L>When we present you with a modest Play.</L>
<L>Here no lewd Lines offend the chaster Ear,</L>
<L>No Jests obscene raise Blushes in the Fair;</L>
<L>This we cou'd wish <HI>Collier</HI> himself wou'd hear.</L>
<L>'Tis purely drawn after the City Fashion,</L>
<L>Here's nothing taught, but thorough Reformation.</L>
<L>Here Vice is sham'd, and Lewdness is supprest:</L>
<L>Virtue's rewarded, and her Friends carest.</L>
<L>If some lewd Characters at first appear'd,</L>
<L>They're reclaim'd, or Punishment they shar'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Widow <HI>Gaylove</HI> led a wanton Life,</L>
<L>Is she not punish'd, to be twice a Wife?</L>
<L>What greater Curse can on our Sex be laid,</L>
<L>Then to repent in earnest, and in jest to Wed?</L>
<L>And <HI>Cocky</HI> now grown fond of Matrimony,</L>
<L>Resolves <HI>no more</HI> to wheedle with her known Sir <HI>Tony.</HI></L>

<L><HI>Bellmont,</HI> who all Variety has try'd,</L>

<L>Finds there's no pleasure like a Virtuous Bride.</L>
<L>How was he struck with more than common awe,</L>
<L>When Virtue's purer Beauties first he saw!</L>
<L>How did he Curse his Stars, and blame his Fate,</L>
<L>That he shou'd live so fast, yet know to live so late?</L>
<L>And you his Brethren, who to day appear</L>
<L>With your full Wiggs, and empty Noddles here;</L>
<L>Resolve like him to leave your wicked Courses,</L>
<L>And save your sweet Persons, and your <HI>Purses;</HI></L>
<L>So Maids may be (by your assistance) Nurses.</L>
<L>Be once Content to take a Virtuous Woman,</L>
<L>You see, 'tis dangerous ranging in the Common.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Since Virtue's then our only Theme to day,</L>
<L>'Tis for your Honour, that you like the Play.</L>
