<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>BE it known unto you, gentle or ungentle reader,
that the author of the following poem is a vo∣lunteer
in the service, or rather a poetical knight
errant, who, according to the oath taken at the late
installation, is <HI>exhorted and admonished</HI> (by <HI>Apollo</HI> to
be sure) <HI>to use his sword in defence of all equity and
justice to the utmost of his power.</HI> His brother <HI>Quixote,</HI>
of immortal memory, try'd his prowess upon Sheep
and Windmills—Our champion does very near the
same; and calls forth to the field an <HI>unknown</HI> knight,
who has the sormidable X, Y, Z, in his train.—And
that he may not be thought to engage with too great
odds on his side, he opposes to them his own <HI>three
trusty squires,</HI> A, B, C, who are resolved to stand by
<PB N="iv" REF="4" MS="y"/>
him, and fight all the weapons through, from Epic
Poetry to Epigram, as long as there is a letter left
standing in the <HI>English</HI> alphabet—and now, Mr.
<HI>Churchill</HI> may know, that there is
<Q><L>—A <HI>Quixote</HI> of the age will dare,</L>
<L>To wage a war with dirt, and fight with air.</L></Q>
When the aforesaid <HI>unknown</HI> knight shall please to ap∣pear
with his <HI>beaver up,</HI> he may expect that our ad∣venturer
will shew <HI>his face</HI> too.—In the mean time,
we will divert him in our turn with a little <HI>bush</HI>-fight∣ing,
which he has been endeavouring to entertain the
town with, for more than a twelvemonth past.</P>
<P>It is therefore proper to inform thee, reader, for as
yet perhaps thou hast not heard of it, that there is a
certain weekly paper, called the <HI>Craftsman</HI> still exist∣ing,
if it may be call'd existence to crawl about from
week to week, and be kept alive by those last resources
of hungry ingenuity, falsehood and defamation. In
this said paper a <HI>certain gentleman</HI> who subscribes himself
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
X, Y, Z, a volunteer too in the service, has thrown
about his dirt in a most extraordinary manner, and
has attacked our stage hero, with unwearied malevo∣lence
both in his public and private character; but
indeed his rancour being too much for his wit, he has
let his heart indulge itself at the expence of his head,
and has most imprudently made assertions in the bit∣terness
of his spirit, which can be contradicted by
ev'ry attender upon the theatre.—It would be endless
and out of place here to point out his want of taste,
and even common truth, in his account of the man∣ner
of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s speaking and acting in his vari∣ous
characters; of his most ungentlemanlike, as well
as unjust abuse of his person, voice, age, &amp;c, &amp;c, &amp;c;
for there is no kind of meanness, as <HI>Montaigne</HI> well
observes, that a true malignant spirit will not descend
to.—To give one instance among a thousand of his
upright intentions—This worthy gentleman, Mr.
X, Y, Z, not content with exposing his impotent
malice weekly to the publick, was at the pains and
expence to collect his papers into one volume, and
ev'n send 'em to some of Mr. <HI>Garrick</HI>'s Friends, least
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
the obscurity and disreputation of the paper, in which
they first made their appearance, should have kept his
malice totally a secret—The <HI>Reviewers</HI> gave their
sentiments of this curious collection, in the following
manner—</P>
<P>“These are the overflowings of spleen, ignorance,
conceit, and disappointment.” <HI>Crit. Rev. Jan.</HI> 1761.</P>
<P>“The design of publishing these <HI>important</HI> pieces
of criticism, is, to prevent the <HI>sad misfortune</HI> of their
sinking into oblivion with a last year's news-paper.
If we believe the author, all the praises that have
hitherto been given to Mr. <HI>Garrick,</HI> as an actor, are
so entirely without foundation, that “he never did,
nor never could, speak ten successive lines of
<HI>Shakespear</HI> with grammatical propriety.” This is
an assertion so contrary to the opinion of many better
critics than this author shews himself to be, and in
reality so opposite to truth, that it is alone sufficient
to invalidate all his reasonings upon the subject.”
<HI>Monthly Rev. Dec.</HI> 1760.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
It would take up too much time at present to
exhibit our hero X, Y, Z, in all his proper colours,
we shall leave that task to a much abler hand, who
will very soon more fully detect and expose him and
his designs.—But to return to our poem—</P>
<P>If may properly be called an <HI>Iliad</HI> in a <HI>nutshell;</HI>
For though it does not consist of many more than 400
lines, it contains all the essential epic properties,—
the plan, sentiments, character, diction, moral, metre,
and even the heroes themselves, all in miniature.—</P>
<P>The following epigram printed in the Ledger, was
the corner-stone of the whole, and furnished us with
ideas of the redoubted <HI>Fizgig,</HI> the <HI>Achilles</HI> of the
<HI>Fribbleriad</HI>—</P>
<Q>To X, Y, Z.</Q>
<L>Indeed most severely poor <HI>Garrick</HI> you handle,</L>
<L>Not bigots damn more with their bell, book and candle;</L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
Tho' you with the town about him disagree,</L>
<L>He joins with the town in their judgment of thee:</L>
<L>So dainty, so dev'lish, is all that you scribble,</L>
<L>Not a soul but can see 'tis the spite of a <HI>Fribble;</HI></L>
<L>And all will expect you, when forth you shall come,</L>
<L>With a <HI>round smirking face,</HI> and a <HI>jut with your bum.</HI></L>
<P>If X, Y, Z, is really such a thing, as here represent∣ed,
he is most welcome to the honour we have done
him; if he is <HI>not,</HI> he may thank his own malignant dis∣position,
that made it natural to suppose, that such
poor spite could proceed from no one, who was not
in his person, manners, mind and heart an arrant
FRIBBLE.</P>

<L>WHO is this Scribbler, X, Y, Z?</L>
<L>Who still writes on, tho' little read?</L>
<L>Whose falshood, malice, envy, spite,</L>
<L>So often grin, yet seldom bite?</L>
<L>Say, <HI>Garrick,</HI> does he write for bread,</L>
<L>This <HI>friend</HI> of yours, this X, Y, Z?</L>
<L>For pleasure sure, not bread—'twere vain</L>
<L>To write for that he ne'er could gain:</L>
<L>No calls of nature to excuse him,</L>
<L>He deals in rancour to amuse him;</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="10"/>
A <HI>Man</HI> it seems—'tis hard to say—</L>
<L>A <HI>Woman</HI> then?—a moment pray—</L>
<L>Unknown as yet by sex or feature,</L>
<L>Suppose we try to guess the creature;</L>
<L>Whether a <HI>wit,</HI> or a <HI>pretender?</HI></L>
<L>Of <HI>masculine</HI> or <HI>female</HI> gender?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some things it does may pass for either,</L>
<L>And some it does belong to neither:</L>
<L>It is so fibbing, slandering, spiteful,</L>
<L>In phrase so dainty, so delightful;</L>
<L>So fond of all it reads and writes,</L>
<L>So waggish when the maggot bites:</L>
<L>Such spleen, such wickedness, and whim,</L>
<L><HI>It</HI> must be <HI>Woman,</HI> and a <HI>Brim.</HI></L>
<L>But then the learning and the Latin!</L>
<L>The ends of <HI>Horace</HI> come so pat in,</L>
<L>And wanting wit, it makes such shift,</L>
<L>To fill up gaps with <HI>Pope,</HI> and <HI>Swift,</HI></L>
<L>As cunning housewives bait their traps,</L>
<L>And take their game with bits and scraps;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="11"/>
For playhouse critics, keen as mice,</L>
<L>Are ever greedy, never nice;</L>
<L>And rank abuse, like toasted cheese,</L>
<L>Will catch as many as you please.</L>
<L>In short 'tis easily discerning,</L>
<L>By here and there a patch of learning,</L>
<L>The creature's <HI>Male</HI>—say all we can,</L>
<L>It must be something <HI>like</HI> a man—</L>
<L>What, like a man, from day to shrink,</L>
<L>And seek revenge with pen and ink?</L>
<L>On mischief bent, his name conceal,</L>
<L>And like a toad in secret steal,</L>
<L>There swell with venom inward pent</L>
<L>Till out he crawls to give it vent.</L>
<L><HI>Hate</HI> join'd with <HI>Fear</HI> will shun the light,</L>
<L>But <HI>Hate</HI> and <HI>Manhood</HI> fairly fight—</L>
<L>'Tis manhood's mark to face the foe,</L>
<L>And not in ambush give the blow;</L>
<L>The Savage thus, less man than beast,</L>
<L>Upon his foe will fall and feast,</L>
<L>From bush, or hole, his arrows send,</L>
<L>To wound his prey, then tear and rend;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="12"/>
For fear and hatred in conjunction,</L>
<L>Make wretches that feel no compunction.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With colours flying, beat of drum,</L>
<L>Unlike to this, see <HI>Churchill</HI> come!</L>
<L>And now like <HI>Hercules</HI> he stands,</L>
<L>Unmask'd his face, but arm'd his hands;</L>
<L>Alike prepar'd to <HI>write</HI> or <HI>drub!</HI></L>
<L>This holds a <HI>Pen,</HI> and that a <HI>Club!</HI></L>
<L>A Club! which nerves like his can wield,</L>
<L>And form'd, a wit, like his, to shield.</L>
<L>Mine is the <HI>Rosciad,</HI> mine, he cries;</L>
<L>Who says 'tis not, I say, he lies.</L>
<L>To falshood and to fear a stranger,</L>
<L>Not one shall share my fame or danger;</L>
<L>Let those who write with fear or shame,</L>
<L>Those <HI>Craftsmen</HI> scribblers hide their name!</L>
<L>My name is <HI>Churchill!</HI>—Thus he spoke,</L>
<L>And thrice he wav'd his knotted oak:</L>
<L>That done, he paus'd—prepar'd the blow,</L>
<L>Impartial bard! for friend and foe.</L>

<L>What! of that wriggling, fribbling race,</L>
<L>The curse of nature, and disgrace?</L>
<L>That mixture base, which fiends sent forth</L>

<L>Whose rancour knows nor bounds, nor measure,</L>
<L>Feels every passion, tastes no pleasure;</L>
<L>The want of power, all peace destroying,</L>

You, when their PANFRIBBLERIUM sat,</L>

<L>Their nodding, frisking, and curvetting;</L>
<L>Each minute saw their rage grow stronger,</L>
<L>Till the dear things could hold no longer;</L>
<L>But out burst forth the dreadful vow,</L>

<L>There is a place, upon a hill,</L>
<L>Where cits of pleasure take their fill,</L>
<L>Where hautboys scream, and fiddles squeak,</L>
<L>To sweat the <HI>ditto</HI> once a week;</L>
<L>Where joy of late, unmix'd with noise,</L>

<L>Where <HI>Decency,</HI> sweet maid, appear'd,</L>

<L>'Twas <HI>Here</HI>—(for public rooms are free,)</L>
<L>They met to plot, and drink their tea.</L>
<L>Each on a sattin stool was seated,</L>
<L>Which nicely quilted, curtain'd, pleated,</L>
<L>Did all their various skill display:</L>
<L>Each work'd his own to grace the day—</L>
<L>Above the rest, and set apart,</L>
<L>A Chair was plac'd; where curious art</L>

The tea was done, the cups revers'd;</L>
<L>Lord TRIP began—“May I be curs'd:</L>

Arose—“Let not this accident</L>

“Sure 'tis the error of the moon!</L>
<L>What, fight a mimic, a buffoon?</L>
<L>In <HI>France</HI> he has the church's curse,</L>
<L>And <HI>England</HI>'s church is ten times worse.</L>
<L>Have you not read the holy writ,</L>
<L>Just publish'd by a Reverend Wit?</L>
<L>That every <HI>Actor</HI> is a <HI>thing,</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>Merry Andrew, paper king,</HI></L>
<L>A <HI>puppet</HI> made of rags and wood,</L>
<L>The <HI>lowest son of earth,</HI> mere mud;</L>
<L>Mere public game, where'er you meet him,</L>
<L>And coblers as they please may treat him?</L>
<L><HI>Slave, coxcomb, venal,</HI> and what not?</L>
<L>Ten thousand names that I've forgot—</L>
<L>Then risque not thus a precious life,</L>
<L>In such a low, <HI>unnat'rel</HI> strife,</L>
<L>And sure, to stab him would be cruel.—</L>
<L>I vote for—arsnick in his gruel.”</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He said and smil'd—then sunk with grace,</L>
<L>Lick'd the patch'd lip, and wip'd his face.</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="25"/>
A buz of rapture fill'd the room,</L>
<L>Like bees about a shrub in bloom:</L>
<L>All whisper'd round—“Was it not fine?</L>
<L>O very—Very—'Twas divine!”</L>
<L>But soon as from the chair was seen</L>
<L>A waving hand, and speaking mein,</L>
<L>A calm came on—The Chairman bow'd—</L>
<L>And smirking spoke—“I'm pleas'd and proud</L>
<L>To mix my sentiments with yours:</L>
<L>'Tis prudence every point secures.</L>
<L>Two friends with rapture I have heard;</L>
<L>One favours <HI>arsnick,</HI> one the <HI>sword</HI>—</L>
<L>In both there's danger—but succeeding,</L>
<L>Short pangs in <HI>poys'ning,</HI> less in <HI>bleeding;</HI></L>
<L>A sudden death's not worth a shilling—</L>
<L>I'd have our foe nine years a killing.”</L>
<L>Then from his bosom forth he drew</L>
<L>A crow-quill pen—“behold for you</L>
<L>And your revenge, this instrument!</L>
<L>From hell it came, to me 'twas sent:</L>
<L>Within is poyson, sword and all;</L>
<L>It's point a dagger, dipt in gall:</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="26"/>
Keen ling'ring pangs the foe shall feel,</L>
<L>While clouds the hand that stabs conceal:</L>
<L>With this, while living, I'll dissect him;</L>
<L>Create his errors, then detect 'em;</L>
<L>Swell tiny faults to mon'strous size!</L>
<L>Then point 'em out to purblind eyes,</L>
<L>Which, like Polonius, gaze in air</L>
<L>For <HI>ouzel, camel, whale,</HI> or <HI>bear.</HI></L>
<L>His very merit I'll pervert,</L>
<L>And swear the oar is sand and dirt—</L>
<L>I know his quick and warm sensations,</L>
<L>And thence will work him more vexations—</L>
<L>Attended with some noisy cit,</L>
<L>Of strong belief, but puny wit;</L>
<L>I'll take my seat, be rude and loud,</L>
<L>That each remark may reach the crowd;</L>
<L>At <HI>Lear</HI> we'll laugh, be hard as rocks,</L>
<L>And sit at <HI>Scrub</HI> like barbers blocks:</L>
<L>When all is still we'll roar like thunder;</L>
<L>When all applause—be mute, and wonder!</L>
<L>In this I boast uncommon merit—</L>
<L>I like, have prais'd, his genius, spirit;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="27"/>
His various powers, I own, divert me—</L>
<L>'Tis his <HI>success</HI> alone has hurt me—</L>
<L>My patriot hand, like <HI>Brutus</HI> strikes,</L>
<L>And stabs and wounds where most it likes:</L>
<L><HI>He,</HI> as a <HI>Roman,</HI> gave the blow;</L>
<L>I, as a FRIBBLE, stab your foe;</L>
<L>He mourn'd the deed, would not prevent it,—</L>
<L>I'll do the deed—and then<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some MSS. read <HI>repent it.</HI></NOTE> lament it.”—</L>
<L>At this all tongues their hearts obey,</L>
<L>A burst of rapture forc'd it's way,—</L>
<L>Bravo!—Bravissimo!—Huzza!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All 'rose at once—then hand in hand,</L>
<L>Each link'd to each, the heroes stand—</L>
<L>Like faries form a magic round,—</L>
<L>Then vow—and tremble at the sound—</L>
<L>By all that's dear to human kind,</L>
<L>By every tye can FRIBBLES bind;</L>
<L>They vow—that with their latest breath</L>
<L>They'll stand by <HI>Fizgig</HI>—Life or death.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="28"/>
The kiss goes round the parting friends—</L>
<L>The chair is left—th' assembly ends.</L>
<L>Then each, his spirit to recruit,</L>
<L>For biscuits call, and candy'd fruit;</L>
<L>And sip, his flutter'd nerves to heal,</L>
<L>Warm water, sack, and orange-peel—</L>
<L>Then made as warm, as warmth could make 'em</L>
<L>All to their several homes betake 'em—</L>
<L>Save one, who, harrass'd with the chair,</L>
<L>Remain'd at <HI>Hampstead</HI> for the air—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, GARRICK, for the future know</L>
<L>Where most you have <HI>deserv'd</HI> a foe.—</L>
<L>Can you their rage with justice blame?</L>
<L>To you they owe their publick shame.—</L>
<L>Tho' long they slept, they were not dead;</L>
<L>Their malice wakes in X, Y, Z.—</L>
<L>And now bursts forth their treasur'd gall,</L>
<L>Through <HI>him,</HI>—COCK FRIBBLE of them all.</L>
