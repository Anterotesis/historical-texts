<L>Our present Culprit is a well-known wight,</L>

<L>We own his faults; but, ere the cause proceed,</L>

<HEAD><HI>SCENE</HI>—The Gate of Mandeville Castle, and View of sur∣rounding Country.</HEAD>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> MANDEVILLE <HI>and</HI> ROBERT.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>JOY! I give you joy, Sir!—Once more welcome to Mandeville Castle!—Look, Sir!—there stands the old pile, just as we left it fourteen years ago! Shall I knock at the gate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lose not a moment. <STAGE><HI>[Rob knocks.]</HI></STAGE> I have travel∣led far to have the mystery unravelled; and till I know why I have been thus treated—why for three tedious years I have received no letter from my father—no tidings of my child—the interval is insupportable!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty treatment, indeed, Sir!—to bring two gen∣tlemen from India—all the way from the shores of Bengal to the coast of Devonshire—only to get an answer to our let∣ters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't I write by every packet?—regularly remit half my pay for the support of my daughter?—And to re∣ceive no answer!—to hear nothing from my father, or Mrs. Rigid, the governess of my child?—What—what can be the motive for this silence?—In India I have been guilty of no vices—no extravagance!—and if, before I
<PB N="6" REF="6"/>went, I involved myself in pecuniary embarrassments, was it not to serve a friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It was, Sir!—You became security for the ungrate∣ful Mr. Howard; and because he took it into his head to die, and leave you responsible for twenty thousand pounds—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We were compelled to fly to India!—Well, well, blame not Howard; if he had lived, he would have pro∣ved himself deserving of my friendship. But now, Robert, I am here once more in the centre of my creditors; and if my father has forgotten me—Knock again—the suspense is dreadful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob. [knocks]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Surely they are all run away, or drowned, or hanged—Hanged!—I beg pardon, Sir!—I only al∣lude to the female part of the family; and I dare say ma∣ny a fair neck has been twisted in consequence of my ab∣sence—Not come yet! Nay: don't fret so, Sir: the worst come to the worst, we can but make the same exit we did this time fourteen years!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Can't you remember our stealing out of those gates in disguise?—our being found out by the bailiffs, and dodging them so artfully from place to place, that by the time they had taken out a writ in one county we were safely perched in another; till at last, after having outwit∣ted half the sheriffs'-officers and attorneys in England, we s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ured our retreat by arriving at Portsmouth late on a Sa∣turday night, and sailing for India early on Sunday morn∣ing!—Ha! ha! ha! I shall never forget the Captain's smoking us, and after dinner giving for a toast, "Success to the Sunday men!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! who comes here?—Old Realize, my fa∣ther's steward!—Now we shall get information.—Observe!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> REALIZE <HI>and</HI> COPSLEY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk to me, you old poacher! Hav'n't you been repeatedly warned off Sir Solomon's manor, and didn't he himself see you kill the hare on his ground? And therefore, at Sir Solomon's request, I dismiss you from being game keeper to the Mandeville manors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cops.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, consider, Mr. Realize!—I am an old servant, and am as innocent of poaching—</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You were caught in the fact; and therefore I dis∣miss you, and appoint in your place—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>[Robert comes up to him.]</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Me, Mr. Steward!—honest Boo Tickwell!—How are you, my old friend?—how are you?—Here we are, you see, hot from Bengal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it can't be!—Yes: it is!—The long look∣ed for come at last!—Huzza!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Realize, I am glad to see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So am I to see you; and so will Sir Solomon; and so will all the neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There!—I said so!—I knew we should have a joy∣ous welcome!—Come! open wide the Castle gates, and prepare the wine—the venison—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Open wide the prison gates, and prepare the bread and water!—Mr. Mandeville <STAGE><HI>[to Mand.],</HI></STAGE> Sir, I'll trouble you for that two hundred pounds you owe me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Psha!—this isn't a proper time—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where is my money, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nonsense! His father will satisfy you.—Come—we'll all pay the old gentleman a visit together.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Laying hold of Realize's arm.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, master Robert.—You may both go to the old gentleman as soon as you like; but, for me, I don't in∣tend to pay him a visit these twenty years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No!—Why, where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where, I can't exactly say—only I fancy you are about as far from him now as when you were hot in Bengal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What, is he gone abroad?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; he's gone home!—he's dead!—defunct!—was buried twelve months ago!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dead!—my father dead!—I didn't expect this.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Putting his handkerchief to his eyes.</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No more did I, Sir—Oh! h! h!</P>
<STAGE><HI>[weeping violently.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what's the milksop crying at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'm crying to think what trouble old Mr. Mande∣ville's death will occasion to my poor master—What a fa∣tigue it will be to collect in all the rent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—to pay his debts—to discharge you, and appoint me steward in your place—Oh! h! h!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—If that's all that afflicts you, dry up your tears, booby—Your master is disinherited.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="8" REF="8"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Disinherited!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Cut off with a shilling!—Mr. Mandeville has left his whole estate to a woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A woman!—Oh! the old profligate!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To your child, Sir <STAGE><HI>[to Mandeville]</HI></STAGE>—to his own grand daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To Albina!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!—Then it comes to the same point! my mas∣ter of course manages the property, and I'm steward still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There you're out again! I rather think Mrs. Rigid will manage the property. I rather imagine the young Heiress will be ruled by the old Governess; and as you've been no friend to her, Mr. Mandeville—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No friend to her!—How?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay: perhaps you may call it friendship to leave her to support your daughter at her own expence; perhaps you may call it friendship, not to write any letters, or re∣mit any money, for three years together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Go on, Sir; let me know all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you may know, that Mrs. Rigid inform∣ed the late Mr. Mandeville of your unfatherlike conduct; that he invited her and his grand daughter to his house, and taking a fancy to Miss Albina, he made her his hei∣ress. There now you've heard the whole story; and I shall call it friendship, if you'll pay me my two hundred pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not write letters!—Not remit money!—Hear me, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not now. The Heiress is expected from Dover every moment, and I must go and prepare the Castle for her reception. Come along, Poacher; come and deliver your keys to your successor—I'll take out a writ direct∣ly, and he sha'n't slip through my fingers a second time— <STAGE><HI>[aside.]</HI></STAGE> No more disguises, Mr. Mandeville—No more Sunday men, Mr. Steward.—"Oh! what trouble will the old gentleman's death occasion to my poor master!"</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icking Robert, and exit with Copsley at the Castle gate.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now all's out, Sir. No wonder at our not receiv∣ing answers, when they say we sent no letters. Oh that diabolical Governess! I always said you were to blame, to place your only child under her care; particularly when
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>you knew she was once in love with you, and you refused her, and married her cousin, Miss Herbert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, name not her! If my Amelia had survived, I should not have been doomed unheard!—What! desert∣ed! disinherited!—Is this my welcome home? Am I to find a father dead, and dying full of resentment against me? a daughter prejudiced! nay, perhaps cursing my ve∣ry name, and this Governess—Speak, Sir; justify your injured master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will with my life, Sir; but don't be satisfied with Realize's story: let us get information elsewhere. Yonder is the house of Sir Solomon Cynic. If the old gentleman hasn't fretted away his life by railing at the follies of wo∣mankind, perhaps he lives to console and befriend you. Shall we go to him, Sir?.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Take me where you will <STAGE><HI>[Going, stops].</HI></STAGE> Robert, how old was Albina when we last saw her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Rob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>About four years, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And I left her in the fond hope, that I might one day find in her a recompense for the loss of her mother! And now if I behold her, she will avoid—upbraid me! That thought is past all bearing. I'll know the worst, and then my fate's decided. They may desert, but they shall not despise me!</P>

<P>Keep off—keep within your magic circle—I hav'n't been within the reach of a woman these twenty years; and you are the very last I'd suffer to come near

<P>A second time, Sir Solomon!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; I was once as much in love as Mark An∣tony, and like him I was deserted by my Cleopatra.

<P>You have forgot me, Mr. Mandeville—I see you have—You don't recollect George Howard, whom, when a boy you used to take such notice of—I'm strangely altered since you went to India—that is, in person only, I hope; for in mind and disposition I am still the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh Mr. Mandeville! I don't know why—whe∣ther it is from the joy at seeing you, or from the grief I feel at the cruel treatment you've received—I don't know which it is—but I'm going to be the same blubbering boy you left me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—'Sdeath! this generosity afflicts me more than all their cruelty!—Let me go!—I heard your uncle's orders—"You must not associate with a man of his cha∣racter."—Let me begone. I will not involve you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not involve me! Didn't my father involve you? And if I've not the fortune to repay the obligation, I'll prove I have the gratitude to remember it. From this hour I am devoted to your service: and if the friendship of the son can atone for the injuries of the parent, I shall be far happier in partaking your distress than in sharing my unfeeling uncle's riches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am most grateful: but I cannot consent—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You must—you shall consent!—Come, come—your case is not so lost as you imagine. The Gover∣ness isn't the only person who has an influence over your daughter—there is another—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who? This Tutor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; his Pupil. I flatter myself Albina has no slight partiality for her father's friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For you! How, and where, did you know her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you. When I and my Tutor arrived from the grand tour, we found Albina and the Governess at Dover. Mr. Veritas and Mrs. Rigid being related, we often paid them visits; and while the schoolmaster and schoolmistress moralised on the miseries of the world, their two scholars as naturally conversed on its pleasures. In sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, we soon laughed ourselves into an attachment;
<PB N="13" REF="13"/>which the Governess perceiving, Albina was locked up, I turned out, and the Tutor destined for her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!—And did she—forgive my weakness, Sir—did she once name her father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Often: but the Governess has instilled into her young mind such notions of your barbarity, and at the same time of her own benevolence that she looks on her as a pa∣rent; you as an enemy. However, don't despair—if we can once gain an interview—And what say you? Shall we go to the Castle directly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Twill be in vain. The gates will be shut against us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never mind: we'll force them open. Come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay: but consider you are dependent on your uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No matter. The hope that the name of How∣ard may still be dear to him, who now has so much cause to curse it, makes me superior to all selfish thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible? You that have had a fashionable education! you that have been schooled in all the arts of modern foppery, and foreign folly! you to be the only one to pity or befriend me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the fact is, they tried hard to spoil me; but I wouldn't let them—they sent me all over the Conti∣nent, before I'd been half over England; taught me fo∣reign languages, before I knew my own; instructed me how to pick my teeth all the morning in Bond street; yawn all night at the Opera. But I was a bad scholar, Mr. Mandeville: and the satisfaction I feel at this moment proves I did right to educate myself.—Now then for Albi∣na! They may have perverted my head; but I assure you they hav'n't corrupted my heart.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>YES, yes: Albina already thinks me the best of women, and shall soon believe that you are the first of men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Granted—But about Howard—Is she as fond of him as ever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; she don't like him half so well as she did. Ever since he left Dover, I have been undermining him, and extolling you; and in proof of my argument, Sir Solomon has just told her of Howard's intimacy with a gamekeeper's daughter. This has roused her jealousy—her indignation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Half?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure.—What other motive could I have for getting Mandeville disinherited? Did not Albi∣na gain the property through my management? Did not I make a dupe of the grandfather?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And why do I give you my interest;?—Why do I select you for her husband?—Why, but because you are to give me a moiety?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Granted. We'll divide the fortune—and thus I seal the bargain—thus with a righteous kiss.</P>

<P>I do.—I beg pardon—You're for the Platonic.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I <HI>am</HI> for the Platonic system, Sir, and hi∣therto

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That's true philanthropy, Mrs. Rigid; and the longer you persevere in your system, the more our sex will be obliged to you—Ha! here comes Albina!—Pray in she also for the Platonic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For shame, Albina!—After what you have just heard from Sir Solomon, how can you condescend to name him? Did not he tell you of his passion for a game∣keeper's daughter?</P>

<P>Look'ye: let me hear no more of Mr. How∣ard! If you mention his name again, I'll resort to my old mode of punishment—I'll shew you I have not forgot the art of looking up, Miss.</P>

<P>Oh, Sir Solomon! You're the very person I wanted to see.—Do you know, there's an old man in the hall, who says he was servant to my grandfather thirty years; and now, because his dogs killed a hare on your grounds, that he is dismissed from his place, and he and his family must starve!—Dear!—If all your game is purchased at so high a price, I wonder you're not choaked!</P>

<P>Go where I ordered you, Miss. Sir Solo∣mon and I have business.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Begone, Miss!—Begone directly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well: I'm going, Governess—I'm going. Come, Mr. Tutor; and if we meet that poor old man by the way. I'll tell him he may kill all the game on my estate; and if that won't keep his family from starving. I'll bid him shoot all Sir Solomon's! I have plenty of money, and I can't dispose of it better than in protecting an old favourite of him who gave it me!—Come—good bye.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I know it. He's a sad profligate; and therefore do you lock up Albina, and I'll lock up Mandeville. We'll keep them apart, till she has got a husband to protect her. I'll go directly, and order Realize to take out a writ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I will.—Odsheart!—it was the wish of my life that Howard should marry Albina; but his attachment to other women shews he is not worthy her affections; and his now associating with her father, proves he would waste every shilling of the property—Therefore, the sooner she marries Mr. Veritas, the better. Adieu!—Go and lock her up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I won't lose a moment.—Ah, Sir Solo∣mon! If Mr. Howard had copied the example of his un∣cle!—If, like you, he had never associated with profligate men, or low bred women!—You would not have fixed your affections on a game keeper's daughter?</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! She's too young—too—too every thing!—No, Mrs. Rigid, if ever I again become a slave to the tender passions, I should select a woman of your time of life—a woman of experience!—Your young things take no pains to please a man; they rely on their youth and beauty: but your middle aged woman—she is so industri∣ours!—she dresses at you, talks at you, glances at you—.—Oh!

<P>And pray, Sir, what made a man of your gaiety become an usher?</P>

<P>You shall hear:—I finished my fortune before I finished my education. At Westminster School I found I could keep a curricle: at Oxford I found I could keep a pack of hounds; and in London I found—I could not keep myself.—So not wishing so much talent should re∣main in obscurity, I set up for Tutor, in order to disperse my knowledge amongst the rising generation.</P>

<P>Upon my word, the rising generation is very much obliged to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay: if I have not done much good, I have done little harm; for with all my follies, of this you may be as∣sured—I never did right without rejoicing at it, or wrong without repenting it. This is my history. And now to apply my talents to the right purpose—to love!—Here's Mrs. Rigid.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You will, will you?</P>

<P>Yes: I act differently from you, Sir—I always obey my tutor, and I won't—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you won't skip a task or go out of bounds, for fear of being whipped! hah!—Oh! the good child! Oh the pretty Miss Albina! she shall have cakes and toys, and—Look'ye—give over this childish nonsense, and go with me to the game-keeper's cottage.</P>

<P>Go, Sir!—I'm satisfied, and I hate you—that's what I do—I hate you more than ever I loved you—Come, Governess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Albina?—Why?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have as much pride as yourself, Sir;—and since you treat me with indifference, I shall treat you with scorn —with scorn. Sir!—Come, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Sdeath!—What have I said?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Quite enough, Sir!—Go to your darling rustic—go to your dear Mr. Mandeville; and, by way of consolation tell him that if ever you possess an estate—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If ever I do, Madam, he shall have it all. And I'll give it him, not so much from motives of benevolence, as of prudence; since I perceive that money can transform the most liberal to the most selfish; and she who, without a fortune, was all innocence, tenderness and affection, is, in affluence, suspicious, credulous, and unfeeling—Fare∣well!—
<PB N="22" REF="22"/>Mandeville has a child still; for, while you are a slave to a Governess, I'll be a son to your Father!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Ah! I wish you would indulge me, Governess— There is a favour—</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! do you still doubt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How can I help it? How can I think so meanly of him, or myself, as to suppose he would prefer a girl that's like—in shore, that I dare say is as unlike me as you are to Doctor Busby?—Come now, as he's gone to the cot∣tage, do let me follow him and be convinced.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Follow him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? Look'ye: you and Sir Solomon say he is guilty. Very well! If I find him so, I'll promise to marry the Steward, the Parson, or the Birch Gentleman— any, or all of them, if you like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There's no doubt of his guilt, and this may complete her aversion; therefore I'll let her go. <STAGE><HI>[Aside.]</HI></STAGE> Well! on these conditions, I've no objection. But how will you contrive?</P>

<P>Yes: I'll disguise myself as the Little Red Riding Hood, Little John, Little Pickle, or any other impudent character—Come!—we'll settle that as we go along: and if I sind him innocent, why, you shall have one half the estate; my father the other; and I and Mr. Howard will live and die in the cottage, or any other retired spot you choose to point out for us.</P>

<P>Well: I am resigned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So am not I. I hate a gaol; and as I must follow you wherever you go, pray let us keep in the open air as long as we can. The fact is, there is no staying here without paying your creditors; therefore let's adjourn to London—There we may do as we like.</P>

<P>Do as we like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye: few people think of paying there. Why, if every man in London were to be arrested for the money he owed!—Mercy on us!—there'd be more prisons than carriages; more bailiffs than horses; and men of fashion and dashing citizens would be the two ratest commodities to be met with! Oh! when a man is in debt, the Capital is the place of lie sou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in! Therefore let's begone directly. Stop though—Have you any cash?</P>
</SP>

<P>Not a guinea. Out of my pay as an officer, I could hardly save money enough to land me in my native country.</P>

<P>And I have not a shilling!—And here we are two hundred miles from Hyde Park Corner, without two hundred pence to take us there! What's to be done? Will Sir Solomon advance? Not a halfpenny!—Will the Tutor? Not a farthing!—Will Realize?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>More to save yours!—From what motive?— From benevolence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No: from self interest. He has an annuity on my life. The day I lose my existence, he loses a hun∣dred a year; and though he wouldn't give a doit to save me from perdition.

<P>That's it. I didn't mention it before, Mr. Re∣alize, for fear of distressing you; but, during my travels —Ough! ou! ou! <STAGE><HI>[Coughing violently]</HI></STAGE> I slept in the Pontine marshes; and the pestiferous dews so inflamed my lungs, that ever since—Hoop! oop! <STAGE><HI>[Coughing.]</HI></STAGE> I shall die, that's certain.</P>

<P>Yes, Sir: and because I can't raise money to take me there—Oop!—because Sir Solomon won't advance a few pounds—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'm to lose a hundred a year. Oh! the hard-hearted savage! Why, I'd better give the money myself. I will. Here, Mr. Howard, <STAGE><HI>[Taking out a purse.]</HI></STAGE> I was always of a humane disposition, and so here's thirty—Hold though: Are you sure the Bristol waters will cure you?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Better—'Gad! no wonder at it. The dose you've taken is more likely to do you good, than detergency, ab∣sorbency, or all the doctors and apothecaries in Europe! However, a hundred per annum is worth thirty pounds, or the devil's in it! So keep it, and good bye to you. Hark'ye, though; if you see Mandeville, don't say I've placed bailiffs on the London road.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I won't.—Good bye. I hope I shall mend, for your sake, Mr. Realize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Real.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will. But if you do not, if you find you grow worse, write me word you are coming home full of health and spirits, and I'll go directly to Sir Solo∣mon, talk of the goodness of your life, and sell him the annuity at a premium! That will be punishing him for his

<P>Nay: no more melancholy, now, Mr. Mande∣ville. How can a man talk of distress, when he sees he can raise thirty pounds the moment he wants it?

<P>My lungs!—Hark'ye, Sir; if you want Mr. Mandeville—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I want you, and only you, Sir!—My name is Herbert—I am first cousin to Albina; and if you don't instantly fall on your knees, and ask pardon for the insults you have put upon her, I'll make you a companion for that wild goose—I'll run you through the body, and pin you against the wall—'Slife! now I look at you, I wonder what she could see in your ugly face to be so fond of you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'm glad it's not a bailiff, however. <STAGE><HI>[Aside.]</HI></STAGE> Sir, if you are that lady's cousin, I must inform you she isn't worth my pity, or your resentment. She is neither
<PB N="32" REF="32"/>faithful to her lover, nor affectionate to her father. In short, Sir, I thought her a child of nature, and I found her a Becky.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A Becky!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: a Becky, Sir!—And till she reforms her conduct, not all the fighting men in Europe shall make me alter mine. This is my determination, and so you may tell her, good Captain Bobadil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bobadil!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His love for you is the cause. Sir Solomon told me of his falshood, and now—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Sir Solomon told you?—Oh! base, slanderous man!—Love never brought Mr. Howard to our cottage. No: He came from a far better motive—to bring mo∣ney to my father—to relieve the distresses of his family: and, with gratitude I speak it, he has already saved us from ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: but for him we should have perished; and, as a proof I wasn't the object of his affections, often and often have I heard him say, that Miss Albina, was the girl of his heart, and that he never would or could love any other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb. [Smiling.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! did you say this, Mr. Howard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard my determination. I will not be teased with interrogatories.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb. [Going up to him.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay: don't be so hasty, Mr. Howard. Consider, if Sir Solomon has deceived me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis now too late, Sir.—Your visit: her partiality for her perfidious governess; and her neglect of a too liberal parent, are all—all so disgraceful, that, if ever I love again, depend on't Albina won't be the object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb. [Sharply.]</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>She won't!—Who will then, Sir?</P>

And, Sir Solomon, the next time a game keeper catches one of your hares, don't snare one of his daughters, and make him starve for it into the bargain!

<P>I have. I perceive this is no longer a place of safety▪ and what's worse, that Albina's marriage is to take place this very night! Is there no way to break it off?

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no influence ever the Tutor? Has he no sense of honour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if it be true, that "wine draws forth the natural disposition of the heart," Veritas has still some

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Ver.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I would, but you know my failing, George: wine makes me so cruelly sentimental; it overflows my heart with sympathy, runs out of my eyes in streams of sensibi∣lity; and when I'm no longer myself, I'm so moral, and so honest.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. <HI>Rigid.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, Sir? If entreaty fail, why shouldn't force be employed? Isn't it as much her interest to marry a man of honour, as it is my duty to prevent her being united to a profligate?</P>

<P>Nay, Sir Solomon, if it will give you any pleasure, I'm sure it will give me no pain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Arch rogue! Now I'll take it by proxy, on pur∣pose to be revenged. There, George, try how you can bear it <STAGE><HI>[Howard kisses Albina].</HI></STAGE> So, does it give you much pain? Well, what say you. Mr. Mandeville?—How shall we punish these two culprits? Shall we inflict matrimony, or separation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! Matrimony, by all means! Don't you think so, Sir?</P>
<STAGE><HI>[To Mandeville.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mand.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do, indeed! The day that gives Albina such a husband, and makes me father of such a son as Howard, must be the proudest and happiest of my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so? Then take her George! And if the marriage state can afford happiness—However, we won't talk of impossibilities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Albina, will you ever talk of Cicely again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Will you ever call me Becky again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Becky!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>If you do, I'll make you a companion to the wild goose in the cottage. "I hope your lungs are better, Sir?"</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Reminding him by her voice and attitude.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What! Were you Bobadil? Were you the little smart, well-made Lieutenant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I was young Herbert, Sir; and I bless the disguise, not only for convincing me of the sincerity of my lover, but also for introducing me to my father. I hope you don't blame me. Sir?—</P>
<STAGE><HI>[To Mandeville.]</HI></STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He blame you! No: Howard has most reason. What will your husband say to your strutting about in boy's clothes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Say! That I wish all women would wear the breeches before marriage, instead of afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cops.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam! How shall I thank you? You have saved me and my family from ruin.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="57" REF="57"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You have, Madam! and we are all gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is your benefactor; you are to thank my fa∣ther, not me. If you wish to do me a favour—why, there is one—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cic.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, name it, Madam! name it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why it rather concerns Sir Solomon than myself. Pray be kind enough to have the old curtain repaired, left he should again wish to take cover behind it. And like∣wise, to send me some of the straw—I mean to be married in a straw hat—and I'll have one manufactured out of Sir Solomon's stubble!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>One! We'll have a dozen! And our children shall wear them, in honour of their great uncle's gallantry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Sol.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Gallantry! Pshal I've something better to think of than women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Howard.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you have not. Come, come, Uncle—Rail at the sex as much as you like, you must confess, that life is a blank without them; and the gaming-table, the bottle, and the sports of the field, are all so many substitutes—shadows!—Woman is the true substance, after all—And, compared to her, all other objects are as the glow worm to the sun! It may dazzle the fight—but it can never warm the heart! Don't you think so, Albina.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Alb.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I do, indeed. Women are certainly most superior creatures; and, if by accident they have any faults, men ought not to see them—At least, I hope that will be my case to night. I have done and talked a great many foo∣lish things: but having their hands, and full pardon <STAGE><HI>[Standing between Mandeville and Howard];</HI></STAGE> let me have yours—and Albina will be the happiest of wives, and the most grateful of daughters.</P>

<LG>
<L>THE World's a Stage—and Man has Seven Ages</L>
<L>So Shakespeare writes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The idea of this parody of the Seven Ages of Shakespeare, was suggested to Mr. Reynolds by his friend Mr. Rogers (Author of The Pleasures to Memory), and the lines printed in Italies were furaished by him.</NOTE>—King of Dramatic Sages;</L>
<L>But he forgot to tell you in his plan,</L>
<L>That Woman plays her part as well as Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>First, how her infant heart with triumph swells,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When the red coral shakes its silver hells!</HI>—</L>
<L>She, like young Stotes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en, as the rattle rings,</L>
<L>Leaps at the sound, and strum in leading-strings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, little Miss, in pin-a-fore so trim,</L>
<L>With nurse so noisy—with mama so prim—</L>
<L>Eager to tell you all she's taught to utter—</L>
<L>Lisps as the grasps the allotted bread and butter;</L>
<L>Type of her sex—who, though no longer young,</L>
<L>Hold every thing with ease—except their tongue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>A School-girl then—She curls her hair in papers,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And mimics Father's gout, and Mother's vapours;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tramples alike on customs, and on toes,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And whispers all she hears, to all she knows:</HI></L>
<L>"Betty!" she cries, "it comes into my head,</L>
<L>"Old maids grow cross because their cats are dead;</L>
<L>"My Governess has been in such a fuss</L>
<L>"About the death of our old tabby puss—</L>
<PB REF="59"/>
<L>"She wears black stockings—Ha! ha!—What a "pother,</L>
<L>"'Cause one old cat's in mourning for another!"</L>
<L>The <HI>Child of Nature</HI>—free from pride and pomp,</L>
<L>And sure to please, though nothing but a <HI>Romp!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next riper Miss, who, Nature more disclosing,</L>
<L>Now finds some traits of art are interposing;</L>
<L><HI>And with blue laughing eyes behind her fan,</HI></L>
<L><HI>First acts her part—with that great actor, Man!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold her now an ogling, vain Coquette,</L>
<L>Catching male gudgeons in her silver'd net:</L>
<L>All things revers'd—the neck, cropt close and bare,</L>
<L>Scarce feels th' incumbrance of a single hair;</L>
<L>Whilst the thick forehead tresses, frizzled full,</L>
<L>Rival the tufted locks that grace the bull.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Then comes that sober character—a Wife,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With all the dear, distracting cares of life;</HI></L>
<L>A thousand cards, a thousand joys extend,</L>
<L>For what may not upon a card depend?</L>
<L>Though Justice in the morn claim fifty pounds,</L>
<L>Five hundre won at night may heal the wounds!—</L>
<L><HI>Now she'll snatch half a glance at Opera, Ball,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A meteor trac'd by none, though seen by all;</HI></L>
<L>Till Spousy finds, while anxious to immure her,</L>
<L>A <HI>Patent Coffin</HI> only can secure her!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>At last the Dowager—in ancient flounces,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With snuff and spectacles, this age denounces</HI>—</L>
<L>And thus she moralizes— <HI>[Speaks like an old woman.]</HI></L>
<L>"How bold and forward each young flirt appears!</L>
<L>"Courtship, in my time, lasted seven years—</L>
<L>"Now seven little months suffice of course,</L>
<L>"For courting, marrying, scolding, and divorce!</L>
<L>"What with their truss'd-up shapes and pantaloons,</L>
<L>"Dress occupies the whole of honey-moons;—</L>
<PB REF="60"/>
<L>"They say we have no souls—but what more odd is,</L>
<L>"Nor men, nor women now have any bodies!—</L>
<L>"When I was young—my heart was always tender,</L>
<L>"And would, to every spouse I had, surrender;</L>
<L>"Their wishes to refuse I never durst—</L>
<L>"And my fourth died as happy as my first."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Truce to such splenetic and rash designs,</L>
<L>And let us mingle candour with our lines.</L>
<L>In all the stages of domestic life,</L>
<L>As child, as sifter, parent friend, and wife,</L>
<L>Woman, the source of every sond employ,</L>
<L>Softens affliction; and enlivens joy.</L>
<L>What is your boast, male rulers of the land?</L>
<L>How cold and cheerless all you can command!</L>
<L>Vain your ambition—vain your wealth and power.</L>
<L>Unless kind woman share your raptur'd hour;</L>
<L>Unless, 'midst all the glare of pageant art,</L>
<L>She adds her smile, and triumphs in your heart.</L>
