<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>August 27, 1714.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHatever studies on the one hand, or amusements on the other, it shall be my fortune to fall into, I shall be equally incapable of forgetting you in any of them. The task I undertook <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Translation of Ho∣mer's Iliad. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, though of weight enough in itself, has had a voluntary increase by the inlarging my design of the <HI>Notes</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The notes on the Iliad were his own: Those on the Odyssey were Dr. Broome's.—But they speak their re∣spective Authors.</NOTE>; and the necessity of consulting a num∣ber
<PB N="4" REF="14"/>
of books has carry'd me to Oxford: but, I fear, thro' my Lord Harcourt's and Dr. Clarke's means, I shall be more conversant with the pleasures and company of the place, than with the books and manuscripts of it.</P>
<P>I find still more reason to complain of the negligence of the Geographers in their Maps of old Greece, since I look'd upon two or three more noted names in the public libraries here. But with all the care I am capable of, I have some cause to fear the engraver will prejudice me in a few situations. I have been forced to write to him in so high a style, that, were my epistle inter∣cepted, it would raise no small admiration in an ordinary man. There is scarce an order in it of less importance, than to remove such and such mountains, alter the course of such and such rivers, place a large city on such a coast, and raze another in another country. I have set bounds to the sea, and said to the land, Thus far shalt thou advance, and no further <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">This relates to the Map of ancient Greece, laid down by our Author in his obser∣vations on the second Iliad. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. In the mean time, I, who talk and command at this rate, am in danger of losing my horse, and stand in some fear of a country Justice <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Some of the Laws were, at this time, put in force a∣gainst the Papists.</NOTE>. To disarm me indeed may be but prudential, con∣sidering
<PB N="5" REF="15"/>
what Armies I have at present on foot, and in my service; a hundred thousand Gre∣cians are no contemptible body; for all that I can tell, they may be as formidable as four thou∣sand Priests; and they seem proper forces to send against those in Barcelona. That siege de∣serves as fine a poem as the Iliad, and the ma∣chining part of poetry would be the juster in it, as, they say, the inhabitants expect Angels from heaven to their assistance. May I venture to say who am a Papist, and say to you who are a Papist, that nothing is more astonishing to me, than that people so greatly warm'd with a sense of Liberty, should be capable of har∣bouring such weak superstition <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Were not the old Ro∣mans as <HI>warm'd</HI> and as <HI>weak?</HI> And could a man, inflamed with the love of civil Liberty, which he sees falling a prey to Tyranny, imagine a cause more worthy the interposi∣tion of Heaven?</NOTE>, and that so much bravery and so much folly can inhabit the same breasts?</P>
<P>I could not but take a trip to London on the death of the Queen, mov'd by the common curiosity of mankind, who leave their own bu∣siness to be looking upon other mens. I thank God, that, as for myself, I am below all the ac∣cidents of state-changes by my circumstances, and above them by my philosophy. Common charity of man to man, and universal good-will
<PB N="6" REF="16"/>
to all, are the points I have most at heart; and, I am sure, those are not to be broken for the sake of any governors, or government. I am willing to hope the best, and what I more wish than my own or any particular man's advance∣ment, is, that this turn may put an end entire∣ly to the divisions of Whig and Tory; that the parties may love each other as well as I love them both, or at least hurt each other as little as I would either: and that our own people may live as quietly as we shall certainly let theirs; that is to say, that want of power itself in us may not be a surer prevention of harm, than want of will in them. I am sure, if all Whigs and all Tories had the spirit of one Ro∣man Catholic that I know, it would be well for all Roman Catholics; and if all Roman Catholics had always had that spirit, it had been well for all others; and we had never been charged with so wicked a spirit as that of Per∣secution.</P>
<P>I agree with you in my sentiments of the state of our nation since this change: I find myself just in the same situation of mind you describe as your own, heartily wishing the good, that is, the quiet of my Country, and hoping a total end of all the unhappy divisions of man∣kind by party-spirit, which at best is but the madness of many for the gain of a few.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From Mr. BLOUNT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with a great deal of pleasure I see your letter, dear Sir, written in a style that shews you full of health, and in the midst of diver∣sions: I think those two things necessary to a man who has such undertakings in hand as Yours. All lovers of Homer are indebted to you for taking so much pains about the situa∣tion of his Heroes' kingdoms; it will not only be of great use with regard to his works, but to all that read any of the Greek historians; who generally are ill understood thro' the dif∣ference of the maps as to the places they treat of, which makes one think one author con∣tradicts another. You are going to set us right; and 'tis an advantage every body will gladly see you engross the glory of.</P>
<P>You can draw rules to be free and easy, from formal pedants; and teach men to be short and pertinent, from tedious commentators. How∣ever, I congratulate your happy deliverance from such authors, as you (with all your hu∣manity) cannot wish alive again to converse with. Critics will quarrel with you, if you dare to please without their leave; and Zealots will shrug up their shoulders at a man, that pre∣tends
<PB N="8" REF="18"/>
to get to Heaven out of their form, dress, and diet. I would no more make a judgment of an author's genius from a damning critic, than I would of a man's religion from an un∣saving zealot.</P>
<P>I could take great delight in affording you the new glory of making a Barceloniad (if I may venture to coin such a word:) I fancy you would find a juster parallel than it seems at first sight; for the Trojans too had a great mixture of folly with their bravery; and I am out of countenance for them when I read the wise re∣sult of their council, where, after a warm de∣bate between Antenor and Paris about restoring Helen, Priam sagely determines that they shall go to supper. And as for the Greeks, what can equal their superstition in sacrificing an in∣nocent lady?</P>
<Q><L>Tantum Relligio potuit, &amp;c.</L></Q>
<P>I have a good opinion of my politics, since they agree with a man who always thinks so justly as you. I wish it were in our power to persuade all the nation into as calm and steddy a disposition of mind.</P>
<P>We have receiv'd the late melancholy news, with the usual ceremony, of condoling in one breath for the loss of a gracious Queen, and in another rejoicing for an illustrious King. My
<PB N="9" REF="19"/>
views carry me no farther, than to wish the peace and welfare of my Country; and my mo∣rals and politics teach me to leave all that to be adjusted by our representatives above, and to divine providence. It is much at one to you and me, who sit at the helm, provided they will permit us to sail quietly in the great ship. Ambition is a vice that is timely morti∣fy'd in us poor Papists; we ought in recom∣pence to cultivate as many virtues in ourselves as we can, that we may be truly great. Among my Ambitions, that of being a sincere friend is one of the chief: yet I will confess that I have a secret pleasure to have some of my descend∣ants know, that their Ancestor was great with Mr. Pope.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 11, 1715.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is an agreement of long date between you and me, that you should do with my letters just as you pleased, and answer them at your leisure; and that is as soon as I shall think you ought. I have so true a taste of the substantial
<PB N="10" REF="20"/>
part of your friendship, that I wave all cere∣monials; and am sure to make you as many visits as I can, and leave you to return them whenever you please, assuring you they shall at all times be heartily welcome to me.</P>
<P>The many alarms we have from your parts, have no effect upon the genius that reigns in our country, which is happily turn'd to preserve peace and quiet, among us. What a dismal scene has there been opened in the North? what ruin have those unfortunate rash gentle∣men drawn upon themselves and their misera∣ble followers, and perchance upon many others too, who upon no account would be their followers? However, it may look ungenerous to reproach people in distress. I don't remem∣ber you and I ever used to trouble ourselves about politics, but when any matter hap∣pened to fall into our discourse, we us'd to condemn all undertakings that tended towards the disturbing the peace and quiet of our Coun∣try, as contrary to the notions we had of mo∣rality and religion, which oblige us on no pre∣tence whatsoever to violate the laws of cha∣rity. How many lives have there been lost in hot blood, and how many more are there like to be taken off in cold? If the broils of the na∣tion affect you, come down to me, and though we are farmers, you know Eumeus made his
<PB N="11" REF="21"/>
friends welcome. You shall here worship the Echo at your ease; indeed we are forced to do so, because we can't hear the first report, and therefore are obliged to listen to the second; which, for security sake, I do not always believe neither.</P>
<P>'Tis a great many years since I fell in love with the character of Pomponius Atticus: I long'd to imitate him a little, and have con∣triv'd hitherto, to be, like him, engaged in no party, but to be a faithful friend to some in both: I find myself very well in this way hi∣therto, and live in a certain peace of mind by it, which, I am persuaded, brings a man more content than all the perquisites of wild ambi∣tion. I with pleasure join with you in wishing, nay I am not ashamed to say, in praying for the welfare temporal and eternal of all mankind. How much more affectionately then shall I do so for you, since I am in a most particular man∣ner, and with all sincerity,</P>

<P>I Know of nothing that will be so interesting to you at present, as some circumstances of the last act of that eminent comic poet, and
<PB N="12" REF="22"/>
our friend, Wycherley. He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his acquaintance, that he would marry as soon as his life was despair'd of: Accordingly a few days before his death he underwent the ceremony; and join'd toge∣ther those two sacraments which, wise men say, should be the last we receive; for, if you ob∣serve, Matrimony is placed after Extreme unc∣tion in our Catechism, as a kind of hint of the order of time in which they are to be taken. The old man then lay down, satisfy'd in the conscience of having by this one act paid his just debts, obliged a woman, who (he was told) had merit, and shewn an heroic resentment of the ill usage of his next heir. Some hundred pounds which he had with the Lady, discharg∣ed those debts; a jointure of four hundred a year made her a recompence; and the nephew he left to comfort himself as well as he could, with the miserable remains of a mortgaged estate. I saw our friend twice after this was done, less peevish in his sickness than he used to be in his health; neither much afraid of dying, nor (which in him had been more like∣ly) much ashamed of marrying. The even∣ing before he expired, he called his young wife to the bedside, and earnestly entreated her not to deny him one request, the last he should make. Upon her assurances of consenting to
<PB N="13" REF="23"/>
it, he told her, <Q>“My dear, it is only this, that you will never marry an old man again.”</Q> I cannot help remarking, that sickness, which of∣ten destroys both wit and wisdom, yet seldom has power to remove that talent which we call humour: Mr. Wycherley shew'd his, even in this last compliment; tho' I think his request a little hard, for why should he bar her from doubling her Jointure on the same easy terms?</P>
<P>So trivial as these circumstances are, I should not be displeas'd myself to know such trifles, when they concern or characterise any eminent person. The wisest and wittiest of men are seldom wiser or wittier than others in these so∣ber moments: At least, our friend ended much in the character he had lived in: and Horace's rule for a play, may as well be apply'd to him as a play-wright,</P>

<P>I Am just return'd from the country, whither Mr. Rowe accompanied me, and pass'd a week in the forest. I need not tell you how
<PB N="14" REF="24"/>
much a man of his turn entertain'd me; but I must acquaint you there is a vivacity and gaie∣ty of disposition almost peculiar to him, which make it impossible to part from him without that uneasiness which generally succeeds all our pleasures. I have been just taking a solitary walk by moon-shine, full of reflections on the transitory nature of all human delights; and giving my thoughts a loose in the contempla∣tion of those satisfactions which probably we may hereafter taste in the company of separate spirits, when we shall range the walks above, and perhaps gaze on this world at as vast a di∣stance as we now do on those worlds. The pleasures we are to enjoy in that conversation must undoubtedly be of a nobler kind, and (not unlikely) may proceed from the discoveries each shall communicate to another, of God and of Nature; for the happiness of minds can surely be nothing but knowledge.</P>
<P>The highest gratification we receive here from company is Mirth, which at the best is but a fluttering unquiet motion, that beats about the breast for a few moments, and after leaves it void and empty. Keeping good company, even the best, is but a less shameful art of los∣ing time. What we here call science and stu∣dy, are little better: the greater number of arts to which we apply ourselves are mere groping
<PB N="15" REF="25"/>
in the dark; and even the search of our most important concerns in a future being, is but a needless, anxious, and uncertain haste to be knowing, sooner than we can, what without all this solicitude we shall know a little later. We are but curious impertinents in the case of futurity. 'Tis not our business to be guessing what the state of souls shall be, but to be doing what may make our own state happy; we can∣not be knowing, but we can be virtuous.</P>
<P>If this be my notion of a great part of that high science, Divinity, you will be so civil as to imagine I lay no mighty stress upon the rest. Even of my darling poetry I really make no o∣ther use, than horses of the bells that gingle about their ears (tho' now and then they toss their heads as if they were proud of them) on∣ly to jog on, a little more merrily.</P>
<P>Your observations on the narrow conceptions of mankind in the point of Friendship, confirm me in what I was so fortunate as at my first knowledge of you to hope, and since so amply to experience. Let me take so much decent pride and dignity upon me, as to tell you, that but for opinions like these which I discover'd in your mind, I had never made the trial I have done; which has succeeded so much to mine, and, I believe, not less to your satisfaction: for, if I know you right, your pleasure is greater
<PB N="16" REF="26"/>
in obliging me, than I can feel on my part, till it falls in my power to oblige you.</P>
<P>Your remark, that the variety of opinions in politics or religion is often rather a gratification, than an objection, to people who have sense enough to consider the beautiful order of nature in her variations; makes me think you have not construed Joannes Secundus wrong, in the verse which precedes that which you quote: <HI>Bene nota Fides,</HI> as I take it, does no way sig∣nify the Roman Catholic Religion, tho' Se∣cundus was of it. I think it was a generous thought, and one that flow'd from an exalted mind, That it was not improbable but God might be delighted with the various methods of worshiping him, which divided the whole world <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was an opinion taken up by the old Philo∣sophers, as the last support of Paganism against Christi∣anity: And the Missionaries, to both the Indies, tell us, it is the first answer modern barbarians give to the offer made them of the Gospel. But Christians might see that the notion is not only <HI>impro∣bable,</HI> but impossible to be true, if the redemption of mankind was purchased by the death of Jesus, which is the gospel idea of his Reli∣gion. Nor is there any need of this opinion to discredit persecution. For the iniquity of that practice does not a∣rise from restraining what God permits or delights in, but from usurping a jurisdic∣tion over conscience, which belongs only to his tribu∣nal.</NOTE>. I am pretty sure you and I should no more make good Inquisitors to the modern ty∣rants in faith, than we could have been quali∣fied

for Lictors to Procrustes, when he con∣verted refractory members with the rack. In a word, I can only repeat to you what, I think, I have formerly said; that I as little fear God will damn a man who has Charity, as I hope that any Priest can save him without it.</P>

<P>I Find that a real concern is not only a hin∣drance to speaking, but to writing too: the more time we give ourselves to think over one's own or a friend's unhappiness, the more un∣able we grow to express the grief that proceeds from it. It is as natural to delay a letter, at such a season as this, as to retard a melancholy visit to a person one cannot relieve. One is ashamed in that circumstance, to pretend to entertain people with trifling, insignificant af∣fectations of sorrow on the one hand, or un∣seasonable and forced gaieties on the other. 'Tis a kind of profanation of things sacred, to treat so solemn a matter as a generous vo∣luntary suffering, with compliments, or he∣roic gallantries. Such a mind as your's has no need of being spirited up into honour, or like
<PB N="18" REF="28"/>
a weak woman, praised into an opinion of its own virtue. 'Tis enough to do and suffer what we ought; and men should know, that the noble power of suffering bravely is as far above that of enterprizing greatly, as an unble∣mish'd conscience and inflexible resolution are above an accidental flow of spirits, or a sudden tide of blood. If the whole religious business of mankind be included in resignation to our Maker, and charity to our fellow creatures, there are now some people who give us as good an opportunity of practising the one, as them∣selves have given an instance of the violation of the other. Whoever is really brave, has al∣ways this comfort when he is oppress'd, that he knows himself to be superior to those who in∣jure him: for the greatest power on earth can no sooner do him that injury, but the brave man can make himself greater by forgiving it.</P>
<P>If it were generous to seek for alleviating con∣solations in a calamity of so much glory, one might say, that to be ruin'd thus in the gross, with a whole people, is but like perishing in the general conflagration, where nothing we can value is left behind us.</P>
<P>Methinks, the most heroic thing we are left capable of doing, is to endeavour to lighten each other's load, and (oppress'd as we are) to succour such as are yet more oppress'd. If there
<PB N="19" REF="29"/>
are too many who cannot be assisted but by what we cannot give, our money; there are yet others who may be relieved by our counsel, by our countenance, and even by our chearfulness. The misfortunes of private families, the misun∣derstandings of people whom distresses make suspicious, the coldnesses of relations whom change of religion may disunite, or the necessi∣ties of half-ruin'd estates render unkind to each other; these at least may be softened in some degree, by a general well-managed humanity among ourselves; if all those who have your principles of belief, had also your sense and conduct. But indeed most of them have given lamentable proofs of the contrary; and 'tis to be apprehended that they who want sense, are only religious through weakness, and good-na∣tured thro' shame. These are narrow-minded creatures that never deal in essentials, their faith never looks beyond ceremonials, nor their cha∣rity beyond relations. As poor as I am, I would gladly relieve any distressed, conscien∣tious French refugee at this instant: what must my concern then be, when I perceive so many anxieties now tearing those hearts, which I have desired a place in, and clouds of melancholy rising on those faces, which I have long look'd upon with affection? I begin already to feel both what some apprehend, and what others
<PB N="20" REF="30"/>
are yet too stupid to apprehend. I grieve with the old, for so many additional inconveniencies and chagrins, more than their small remain of life seemed destined to undergo; and with the young, for so many of those gaieties and plea∣sures (the portion of youth) which they will by this means be deprived of. This brings in∣to my mind one or other of those I love best, and among them the widow and fatherless, late of—. As I am certain no people living had an earlier and truer sense of others misfortunes, or a more generous resignation as to what might be their own, so I earnestly wish that whatever part they must bear, may be render'd as sup∣portable to them, as it is in the power of any friend to make it.</P>
<P>But I know you have prevented me in this thought, as you always will in any thing that is good, or generous: I find by a letter of your lady's (which I have seen) that their ease and tranquillity is part of your care. I believe there's some fatality in it, that you should always, from time to time, be doing those particular things that make me enamour'd of you.</P>
<P>I write this from Windsor-Forest, of which I am come to take my last look. We here bid our neighbours adieu, much as those who go to be hang'd do their fellow-prisoners, who are condemn'd to follow them a few weeks af∣ter.

<P>YOUR letters give me a gleam of satis∣faction, in the midst of a very dark and cloudy situation of thoughts, which it would be more than human to be exempt from at this time, when our homes must either be left, or

Poeti∣cally speaking, I should lament the loss Wind∣sor-forest and you sustain of each other, but that, methinks, one can't say you are parted, be∣cause you will live by and in one another, while verse is verse. This consideration hardens me in my opinion rather to congratulate you, since you have the pleasure of the prospect whenever you take it from your shelf, and at the same time the solid cash you sold it for, of which Virgil in his exile knew nothing in those days, and which will make every place easy to you. I for my part am not so happy; my <HI>parva ru∣ra</HI> are fasten'd to me, so that I can't exchange them, as you have, for more portable means of subsistance; and yet I hope to gather enough to make the <HI>Patriam fugimus</HI> supportable to me: 'tis what I am resolved on, with my <HI>Penate.</HI> If therefore you ask me, to whom you shall complain?

<P>IF a regard both to public and private affairs may plead a lawful excuse in behalf of a negligent correspondent, I have really a very good title to it. I cannot say whether 'tis a fe∣licity or unhappiness, that I am obliged at this time to give my whole application to Homer; when without that employment, my thoughts must turn upon what is less agreeable, the vio∣lence, madness, and resentment of modern War∣makers <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was written in the year of the affair of Preston. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, which are likely to prove (to some

people at least) more fatal, than the same qua∣lities in Achilles did to his unfortunate coun∣try-men.</P>
<P>Tho' the change of my scene of life, from Windsor-forest to the side of the Thames, be one of the grand Aera's of my days, and may be called a notable period in so inconsiderable a history; yet you can scarce imagine any hero passing from one stage of life to another, with so much tranquillity, so easy a transition, and so laudable a behaviour. I am become so tru∣ly a citizen of the world (according to Plato's expression) that I look with equal indifference on what I have left, and on what I have gain∣ed. The times and amusements past are not more like a dream to me, than those which are present: I lie in a refreshing kind of inac∣tion, and have one comfort at least from ob∣scurity, that the darkness helps me to sleep the better. I now and then reflect upon the enjoy∣ment of my friends, whom, I fancy, I remem∣ber much as separate spirits do us, at tender in∣tervals, neither interrupting their own employ∣ments, nor altogether careless of ours, but in general constantly wishing us well, and hoping to have us one day in their company.</P>
<P>To grow indifferent to the world is to grow philosophical, or religious (which soever of those turns we chance to take) and indeed the

world is such a thing, as one that thinks pretty much, must either laugh at, or be angry with: but if we laugh at it, they say we are proud; and if we are angry with it, they say we are ill-natur'd. So the most politic way is to seem always better pleas'd than one can be, greater admirers, greater lovers, and in short greater fools, than we really are: so shall we live comfortably with our families, quietly with our neighbours, favoured by our masters, and happy with our mistresses.

Your endeavours of service and good advice to the poor papists, put me in mind of Noah's preach∣ing forty years to those folks that were to be drowned at last. At the worst I heartily wish your Ark may find an Ararat, and the wife and family (the hopes of the good patriarch) land safely after the deluge, upon the shore of Tot∣ness.</P>
<P>If I durst mix prophane with sacred histo∣ry, I would chear you with the old tale of Bru∣tus the wandering Trojan, who found on that very coast the happy end of his peregrinations and adventures.</P>
<P>I have very lately read Jeffery of Monmouth (to whom your Cornwall is not a little be∣holden) in the translation of a clergyman in my neighbourhood. The poor man is highly con∣cerned to vindicate Jeffery's veracity as an histo∣rian; and told me he was perfectly astonished, we of the Roman communion could doubt of the legends of his Giants, while we believe those of our Saints. I am forced to make a fair composition with him; and, by crediting some of the wonders of Corinaeus and Gogmagog, have brought him so far already, that he speaks respectfully of St. Christopher's carrying Christ,

and the resuscitation of St. Nicholas Tolentine's chicken. Thus we proceed apace in con∣verting each other from all manner of infide∣lity.</P>
<P>Ajax and Hector are no more to be com∣pared to Corinaeus and Arthur, than the Guelphs and Ghibellines are to the Mohocks of ever dreadful memory.

<P>YOUR kind letter has overtaken me here, for I have been in and about this country ever since your departure. I am well pleas'd to date this from a place so well known to Mrs. Blount, where I write as if I were dictated to by her ancestors, whose faces are all upon me. I fear none so much as Sir Christopher Guise, who, being in his shirt, seems as ready to com∣bate me, as her own Sir John was to demolish Duke Lancastere. I dare say your lady will re∣collect his figure. I look'd upon the mansion, walls, and terraces; the plantations, and slopes, which nature has made to command a variety of valleys and rising woods; with a veneration
<PB N="30" REF="42"/>
mix'd with a pleasure, that represented her to me in those puerile amusements, which en∣gaged her so many years ago in this place. I fancied I saw her sober over a sampler, or gay over a jointed baby. I dare say she did one thing more, even in those early times; <Q>“re∣member'd her Creator in the days of her youth.”</Q></P>
<P>You describe so well your hermitical state of life, than none of the ancient anchorites could go beyond you▪ for a cave in a rock, with a fine spring, or any of the accommodations that befit a solitary. Only I don't remember to have read, that any of those venerable and holy per∣sonages took with them a lady, and begat sons and daughters. You must modestly be content to be accounted a patriarch. But were you a little younger, I should rather rank you with Sir Amadis, and his fellows. If Piety be so ro∣mantic, I shall turn hermit in good earnest; for, I see, one may go so far as to be poetical, and hope to save one's soul at the same time. I real∣ly wish myself something more, that is, a pro∣phet; for I wish I were, as Habakkuk, to be taken by the hair of his head, and visit Daniel in his den. You are very obliging in saying, I have now a whole family upon my hands to whom to discharge the part of a friend; I assure you, I like them all so well, that I will never

<P>YOUR very kind and obliging manner of enquiring after me, among the first con∣cerns of life, at your resuscitation, should have been sooner answer'd and acknowledged. I sincerely rejoice at your recovery from an illness which gave me less pain than it did you, only from my ignorance of it. I should have else been seriously and deeply afflicted, in the thought of your danger by a fever. I think it a fine and a natural thought, which I lately read in a letter of Montaigne's publish'd by P. Coste, giving an account of the last words of an intimate friend of his: <Q>“Adieu, my friend!
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
the pain I feel will soon be over; but I grieve for that you are to feel, which is to last you for life.”</Q></P>
<P>I join with your family in giving God thanks for lending us a worthy man somewhat longer. The comforts you receive from their attend∣ance, put me in mind of what old Fletcher of Saltoune said one day to me. <Q>“Alas, I have nothing to do but to die; I am a poor indivi∣dual; no creature to wish, or to fear, for my life or death: 'Tis the only reason I have to repent being a single man; now I grow old, I am like a tree without a prop, and without young trees to grow round me, for company and defence.”</Q></P>
<P>I hope the gout will soon go after the fever, and all evil things remove far from you. But pray tell me, when will you move towards us? If you had an interval to get hither, I care not what fixes you afterwards except the gout. Pray come, and never stir from us again. Do away your dirty acres, cast them to dirty people, such as in the Scripture-phrase possess the land. Shake off your earth like the noble animal in Milton,</P>

<P>YOU shew yourself a just man and a friend in those guesses and suppositions you make at the possible reasons of my silence; every one of which is a true one. As to forgetfulness of you or yours, I assure you, the promiscuous conversations of the town serve only to put me in mind of better, and more quiet, to be had in a corner of the world (undisturb'd, inno∣cent, serene, and sensible) with such as you. Let no access of any distrust make you think of me differently in a cloudy day from what you do in the most sunshiny weather. Let the young ladies be assured I make nothing new in my gardens without wishing to see the print of their fairy steps in every part of them. I have put the last hand to my works of this kind, in hap∣pily finishing the subterraneous way and grotto: I there found a spring of the clearest water, which falls in a perpetual rill, that echoes thro' the cavern day and night. From the river Thames, you see thro' my arch up a walk of the wilderness, to a kind of open Temple, wholly compos'd of shells in the rustic man∣ner; and from that distance under the temple you look down thro' a sloping arcade of trees,
<PB N="37" REF="49"/>

When you shut the doors of this grotto, it be∣comes on the instant, from a luminous room, a <HI>Camera obscura;</HI> on the walls of which all the objects of the river, hills, woods, and boats, are forming a moving picture in their visible radia∣tions: and when you have a mind to light it up, it affords you a very different scene; it is finished with shells interspersed with pieces of looking-glass in angular forms; and in the ciel∣ing is a star of the same material, at which when a lamp (of an orbicular figure of thin ala∣baster) is hung in the middle, a thousand point∣ed rays glitter, and are reflected over the place. There are connected to this grotto by a nar∣rower passage two porches, one towards the ri∣ver of smooth stones full of light, and open; the other toward the Garden shadow'd with trees, rough with shells, flints, and iron-ore. The bottom is paved with simple pebble, as is also the adjoining walk up the wilderness to the temple, in the natural taste, agreeing not ill with the little dripping murmur, and the aqua∣tic idea of the whole place. It wants nothing to complete it but a good statue with an in∣scription, like that beautiful antique one which you know I am so fond of,</P>

<P>I Should be asham'd to own the receipt of a very kind of letter from you, two whole months from the date of this; if I were not
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
more ashamed to tell a lye, or to make an ex∣cuse, which is worse than a lye (for being built upon some probable circumstance, it makes use of a degree of truth to falsify with, and is a lye guarded.) Your letter has been in my pocket in constant wearing, till that, and the pocket, and the suit, are worn out; by which means I have read it forty times, and I find by so doing that I have not enough considered and reflected upon many others you have obliged me with; for true friendship, as they say of good writing, will bear reviewing a thousand times, and still discover new beauties.</P>
<P>I have had a fever, a short one, but a vio∣lent: I am now well; so it shall take up no more of this paper.</P>
<P>I begin now to expect you in town to make the winter to come more tolerable to us both. The summer is a kind of heaven, when we wander in a paradisaical scene among groves and gardens; but at this season, we are, like our poor first parents, turn'd out of that agreeable though solitary life, and forced to look about for more people to help to bear our labours, to get into warmer houses, and live together in cities.</P>
<P>I hope you are long since perfectly restor'd, and risen from your gout, happy in the delights of a contented family, smiling at storms, laugh∣ing
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
at greatness, merry over a christmas-fire, and exercising all the functions of an old Patri∣arch in charity and hospitality. I will not tell Mrs. B* what I think she is doing; for I con∣clude it is her opinion, that he only ought to know it for whom it is done; and she will al∣low herself to be far enough advanced above a fine lady, not to desire to shine before men.</P>
<P>Your daughters perhaps may have some other thoughts, which even their mother must ex∣cuse them for, because she is a mother. I will not however suppose those thoughts get the better of their devotions, but rather excite them and assist the warmth of them; while their prayer may be, that they may raise up and breed as irreproachable a young family as their parents have done. In a word, I fancy you all well, easy, and happy, just as I wish you; and next to that, I wish you all with me.</P>
<P>Next to God, is a good Man: next in dig∣nity, and next in value. <HI>Minuisti eum paullo mi∣nus ab angelis.</HI> If therefore I wish well to the good and the deserving, and desire they only should be my companions and correspondents, I must very soon and very much think of you. I want your company, and your example. Pray make haste to town, so as not again to leave

<P>I Had pleas'd myself sooner in writing to you, but that I have been your successor in a fit of sickness, and am not yet so much recover∣ed, but that I have thoughts of using your<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Asses.</NOTE> phy∣sicians. They are as grave persons as any of the faculty, and (like the ancients) carry their own medicaments about with them. But in∣deed the moderns are such lovers of raillery, that nothing is grave enough to escape them.
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>
Let them laugh, but people will still have their opinions: as they think our Doctors asses to them, we'll think them asses to our Doctors.</P>
<P>I am glad you are so much in a better state of health, as to allow me to jest about it. My concern, when I heard of your danger, was so very serious, that I almost take it ill Dr. Evans should tell you of it, or you mention it. I tell you fairly, if you and a few more such people were to leave the world, I would not give six∣pence to stay in it.</P>
<P>I am not so much concerned as to the point whether you are to live fat or lean: most men of wit or honesty are usually decreed to live very lean, so I am inclined to the opinion that 'tis decreed you shall; however be comforted, and reflect, that you'll make the better Busto for it.</P>
<P>'Tis something particular in you, not to be satisfied with sending me your own books, but to make your acquaintance continue the frolic. Mr. Wharton forced me to take Gorboduc, which has since done me great credit with se∣veral people, as it has done Dryden and Old∣ham some dis-kindness, in shewing there is as much difference between their Gorboduc and this, as between Queen Anne, and King George. It is truly a scandal, that men should write with contempt of a piece which they never once saw, as those two Poets did, who were igno∣rant

<P>Adieu! I am going to forget you: this mi∣nute you took up all my mind; the next I shall think of nothing but the reconciliation with A∣gamemnon, and the recovery of Briseis. I shall be Achilles's humble servant these two months (with the good leave of all my friends.) I have no ambition so strong at present, as that noble one of Sir Salathiel Lovel, recorder of London, to furnish out a decent and plentiful execution, of Greeks and Trojans.

<P>TO convince you how little pain I give myself in corresponding with men of good nature and good understanding, you see I omit to answer your letters till a time, when another

<P>If I knew how to entertain you thro' the rest of this paper, it should be spotted and diversi∣fied with conceits all over; you should be put out of breath with laughter at each sentence, and pause at each period, to look back over how much wit you have pass'd. But I have found by experience that people now-a-days regard writing as little as they do preaching: the most we can hope is to be heard just with decency and patience, once a week, by folks in the country. Here in town we hum over a piece of fine writing, and we whistle at a sermon. The stage is the only place we seem alive at; there indeed we stare, and roar, and clap hands for K. George, and the govern∣ment. As for all other virtues but this loyal∣ty, they are an obsolete train, so ill-dress'd, that men, women, and children hiss them out of all good company.

<P>My Lady Scudamore, from having rusticated in your company too long, really behaves her∣self scandalously among us: she pretends to open her eyes for the sake of seeing the sun, and to sleep because it is night; drinks tea at nine in the morning, and is thought to have said her prayers before; talks, without any man∣ner of shame, of good books, and has not seen Cibber's play of the Non-juror. I rejoiced the other day to see a libel on her toilette, which gives me some hope that you have, at least, a taste of scandal left you, in defect of all other vices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter, I heartily wish you well; but as I cannot entirely desire the ruin of all the joys of this city, so all that remains is to wish you would keep your happiness to yourselves, that the happiest here may not die with envy at a bliss which they cannot at∣tain to.</P>

<P>I Have read your letter over and over with delight. By your description of the town, I imagine it to lie under some great enchant∣ment, and am very much concerned for you and all my friends in it. I am the more afraid, imagining, since you do not fly those horrible monsters, rapine, dissimulation, and luxury, that a magic circle is drawn about you, and you can∣not escape. We are here in the country in quite another world, surrounded with bles∣sings and pleasures, without any occasion of ex∣ercising our irascible faculties; indeed we can∣not boast of good-breeding and the art of life, but yet we don't live unpleasantly in primitive sim∣plicity and good-humour. The fashions of the town affect us but just like a raree-show, we have a curiosity to peep at them, and nothing more. What you call pride, prodigality, and vain-glory, we cannot find in pomp and splen∣dor at this distance; it appears to us a fine glit∣tering scene, which if we don't envy you, we think you happier than we are, in your enjoy∣ing it. Whatever you may think to persuade us of the humility of Virtue, and her appearing
<PB N="48" REF="62"/>
in rags amongst you, we can never believe: our uninform'd minds represent her so noble to us, that we necessarily annex splendor to her: and we could as soon imagine the order of things inverted, and that there is no man in the moon, as believe the contrary. I can't forbear telling you we indeed read the spoils of Rapine as boys do the English rogue, and hug ourselves full as much over it; yet our roses are not without thorns.

<P>YOu'll think me very full of myself, when after long silence (which however, to say truth, has rather been employed to contemplate of you, than to forget you) I begin to talk of my own works. I find it is in the finishing a book, as in concluding a session of Parliament, one always thinks it will be very soon, and finds it very late. There are many unlook'd-for in∣cidents to retard the clearing any public ac∣count, and so I see it is in mine. I have plagued myself, like great ministers, with undertaking too much for one man; and with a desire
<PB N="49" REF="63"/>
of doing more than was expected from me, have done less than I ought.</P>
<P>For having design'd four very laborious and uncommon sort of Indexes to Homer, I'm forc'd, for want of time, to publish two only; the de∣sign of which you will own to be pretty, tho' far from being fully executed. I've also been obliged to leave unfinish'd in my desk the heads of two Essays, one on the Theology and Mora∣lity of Homer, and another on the Oratory of Homer and Virgil. So they must wait for fu∣ture editions, or perish: and (one way or other, no great matter which) <HI>dabit Deus his quoque finem.</HI> I think of you every day, I assure you, even without such good memorials of you as your sisters, with whom I sometimes talk of you, and find it one of the most agreeable of all subjects to them. My Lord Digby must be perpetually remember'd by all who ever knew him, or knew his children. There needs no more than an acquaintance with your fami∣ly, to make all elder sons wish they had fathers to their lives end.</P>
<P>I can't touch upon the subject of filial love, without putting you in mind of an old woman, who has a sincere, hearty, old-fashion'd respect for you, and constantly blames her son for not having writ to you oftener to tell you so.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="64"/>
I very much wish (but what signifies my wishing? my lady Scudamore wishes, your si∣sters wish) that you were with us, to compare the beautiful contraste this season affords us, of the town and the country. No ideas you could form in the winter can make you imagine what Twickenham is (and what your friend Mr. Johnson of Twickenham is) in this warmer sea∣son. Our river glitters beneath an unclouded sun, at the same time that its banks retain the verdure of showers: our gardens are offering their first nosegays; our trees, like new ac∣quaintance brought happily together, are stretch∣ing their arms to meet each other, and grow∣ing nearer and nearer every hour; the birds are paying their thanksgiving songs for the new ha∣bitations I have made them; my building rises high enough to attract the eye and curiosity of the passenger from the river, where, upon be∣holding a mixture of beauty and ruin, he en∣quires what house is falling, or what church is rising? So little taste have our common Tritons of Vitruvius; whatever delight the poetical gods of the river may take, in reflecting on their streams, my Tuscan Porticos, or Ionic Pila∣sters.</P>
<P>But to (descend from all this pomp of style) the best account of what I am building, is, that
<PB N="51" REF="65"/>
it will afford me a few pleasant rooms for such a friend as yourself, or a cool situation for an hour or two for Lady Scudamore, when she will do me the honour (at this public house on the road) to drink her own cyder.</P>
<P>The moment I am writing this, I am sur∣prized with the account of the death of a friend of mine; which makes all I have here been talk∣ing of, a mere jest! Building, gardens, writings, pleasures, works, of whatever stuff man can raise! none of them (God knows) capable of advantaging a creature that is mortal, or of sa∣tisfying a soul that is immortal!

<P>YOUR letter, which I had two posts ago, was very medicinal to me; and I heartily thank you for the relief it gave me. I was sick of the thoughts of my not having in all this time given you any testimony of the affection I owe you, and which I as constantly indeed feel as I think of you. This indeed was a trou∣blesome ill to me, till, after reading your letter,
<PB N="52" REF="66"/>
I found it was a most idle weak imagination to think I could so offend you. Of all the im∣pressions you have made upon me, I never re∣ceiv'd any with greater joy than this of your abundant good-nature, which bids me be assured of some share of your affections.</P>
<P>I had many other pleasures from your letter; that your mother remembers me is a very sin∣cere joy to me; I cannot but reflect how alike you are; from the time you do any one a fa∣vour, you think yourselves obliged as those that have received one. This is indeed an old∣fashioned respect, hardly to be found out of your house. I have great hopes however, to see many old-fashioned virtues revive, since you have made our age in love with Homer; I hear∣tily wish you, who are as good a citizen as a poet, the joy of seeing a reformation from your works. I am in doubt whether I should con∣gratulate your having finished Homer, while the two essays you mention are not completed; but if you expect no great trouble from finish∣ing these, I heartily rejoice with you.</P>
<P>I have some faint notion of the beauties of Twickenham from what I here see round me. The verdure of showers is poured upon every tree and field about us; the gardens unfold va∣riety of colours to the eye every morning, the hedges breath is beyond all persume, and the
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
song of birds we hear as well as you. But tho' I hear and see all this, yet I think they would delight me more if you was here. I found the want of these at Twickenham while I was there with you, by which I guess what an increase of charms it must now have. How kind is it in you to wish me there, and how unfortunate are my circumstances that allow me not to visit you? If I see you, I must leave my Father alone, and this uneasy thought would disap∣point all my proposed pleasures; the same cir∣cumstance will prevent my prospect of many happy hours with you in Lord Bathurst's wood, and I fear of seeing you till winter, unless Lady Scudamore comes to Sherburne, in which case I shall press you to see Dorsetshire, as you pro∣posed.

<P>DOctor Arbuthnot is going to Bath, and will stay there a fortnight or more: perhaps you would be comforted to have a sight of him, whether you need him or not. I think him as good a Doctor as any man for one that is ill, and a better Doctor for one that is well. He would do admirably for Mrs. Mary Digby: she needed only to follow his hints, to be in eternal business and amusement of mind, and even as active as she could desire. But indeed I fear she would out-walk him; for (as Dean Swift observ'd to me the very first time I saw the Doc∣tor) <Q>“He is a man that can do every thing but walk.”</Q> His brother, who is lately come in∣to England, goes also to the Bath; and is a more extraordinary man than he, worth your going thither on purpose to know him. The spirit of Philanthropy, so long dead to our

world, is reviv'd in him: he is a philosopher all of fire; so warmly, nay so wildly in the right, that he forces all others about him to be so too, and draws them into his own Vortex. He is a star that looks as if it were all fire, but is all benignity, all gentle and beneficial influence. If there be other men in the world that would serve a friend, yet he is the only one, I believe, that could make even an enemy serve a friend.</P>
<P>As all human life is chequer'd and mixed with acquisitions and losses (tho' the latter are more certain and irremediable, than the former lasting or satisfactory) so at the time I have gain'd the acquaintance of one worthy man I have lost another, a very easy, humane, and gentlemanly neighbour, Mr. Stonor. 'Tis cer∣tain the loss of one of this character puts us na∣turally upon setting a greater value on the few that are left, tho' the degree of our esteem may be different. Nothing, says Seneca, is so me∣lancholy a circumstance in human life, or so soon reconciles us to the thought of our own death, as the reflection and prospect of one friend after another dropping round us! Who would stand alone, the sole remaining ruin, the last tottering column of all the fabric of friend∣ship; once so large, seemingly so strong, and yet so suddenly sunk and buried?</P>

<P>I Have belief enough in the goodness of your whole family, to think you will all be pleas'd that I am arriv'd in safety at Twickenham; tho' it is a sort of earnest that you will be trou∣bled again with me, at Sherburne, or Coles∣hill; for however I may like one of your places, it may be in that as in liking one of your fa∣mily; when one sees the rest, one likes them all. Pray make my services acceptable to them; I wish them all the happiness they may want, and the continuance of all the happiness they have; and I take the latter to comprize a great deal more than the former. I must separate Lady Scudamore from you, as, I fear, she will do herself before this letter reaches you: so I wish her a good journey, and I hope one day to try if she lives as well as you do: tho' I much question if she can live as quietly: I su∣spect the Bells will be ringing at her arrival, and on her own and Miss Scudamore's birth-days, and that all the Clergy in the country come to pay respects; both the Clergy and their Bells ex∣pecting from her, and from the young Lady, fur∣ther business and further employment. Besides all this, there dwells on the one side of her the Lord Conningsby, and on the other Mr. W *. Yet I shall, when the days and the years come about, adventure upon all this for her sake.</P>

<P>YOUR making a sort of apology for your not writing, is a very genteel reproof to me. I know I was to blame, but I know I did not intend to be so, and (what is the hap∣piest knowledge in the world) I know you will forgive me: for sure nothing is more satisfac∣tory than to be certain of such a friend as will overlook one's failings, since every such in∣stance is a conviction of his kindness.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="77"/>
If I am all my life to dwell in intentions, and never to rise to actions, I have but too much need of that gentle disposition which I experi∣ence in you. But I hope better things of my∣self, and fully purpose to make you a visit this summer at Sherburne. I'm told you are all upon removal very speedily, and that Mrs. Mary Digby talks in a letter to Lady Scudamore, of seeing my Lord Bathurst's wood in her way. How much I wish to be her guide thro' that en∣chanted forest, is not to be exprest: I look up∣on myself as the magician appropriated to the place, without whom no mortal can penetrate into the recesses of those sacred shades. I could pass whole days, in only describing to her the future, and as yet visionary beauties, that are to rise in those scenes: the palace that is to be built, the pavillions that are to glitter, the colo∣nades that are to adorn them: nay more, the meeting of the Thames and the Severn, which (when the noble owner has finer dreams than ordinary) are to be led into each other's em∣braces thro' secret caverns of not above twelve or fifteen miles, till they rise and celebrate their marriage in the midst of an immense amphithe∣atre, which is to be the admiration of posterity, a hundred years hence. But till the destin'd time shall arrive that is to manifest these won∣ders, Mrs. Digby must content herself with see∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
what is at present no more than the finest wood in England.</P>
<P>The objects that attract this part of the world, are of a quite different nature. Wo∣men of quality are all turn'd followers of the camp in Hyde-Park this year, whither all the town resort to magnificent entertainments given by the officers, &amp;c. The Scythian Ladies that dwelt in the waggons of war, were not more closely attached to the luggage. The matrons, like those of Sparta, attend their sons to the field, to be the witnesses of their glorious deeds; and the maidens with all their charms display'd, provoke the spirit of the Soldiers: Tea and Coffee supply the place of Lacedemonian black broth. This Camp seems crown'd with per∣petual victory, for every sun that rises in the thunder of cannon, sets in the musick of vio∣lins. Nothing is yet wanting but the constant presence of the Princess, to represent the <HI>Mater Exercitus.</HI></P>
<P>At Twickenham the world goes otherwise. There are certain old people who take up all my time, and will hardly allow me to keep any other company. They were introduced here by a man of their own sort, who has made me perfectly rude to all contemporaries, and won't so much as suffer me to look upon them. The person I complain of is the Bishop of Rochester.
<PB N="65" REF="79"/>
Yet he allows me (from something he has heard of your character and that of your family, as if you were of the old sect of moralists) to write three or four sides of paper to you, and to tell you (what these sort of people never tell but with truth and religious sincerity) that I am, and ever will be,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE same reason that hinder'd your writ∣ing, hinder'd mine, the pleasing expec∣tation to see you in town. Indeed since the willing confinement I have lain under here with my mother (whom it is natural and reasonable I should rejoice with, as well as grieve) I could the better bear your absence from London, for I could hardly have seen you there; and it would not have been quite reasonable to have drawn you to a sick room hither from the first em∣braces of your friends. My mother is now (I thank God) wonderfully recovered, tho' not so much as yet to venture out of her chamber, but enough to enjoy a few particular friends, when they have the good nature to look upon her. I may recommend to you the room we sit in, upon one (and that a favourite) account,
<PB N="66" REF="80"/>
that it is the very warmest in the house; we and our fires will equally smile upon your face. There is a Persian proverb that says (I think very prettily) <Q>“The conversation of a friend brightens the eyes.”</Q> This I take to be a splendor still more agreeable than the fires you so delightfully describe.</P>
<P>That you may long enjoy your own fire-side in the metaphorical sense, that is, all those of your family who make it pleasing to sit and spend whole wintry months together (a far more rational delight, and better felt by an ho∣nest heart, than all the glaring entertainments, numerous lights, and false splendors, of an As∣sembly of empty heads, aking hearts, and false faces.) This is my sincere wish to you and yours.</P>
<P>You say you propose much pleasure in see∣ing some few faces about town of my acquaint∣ance. I guess you mean Mrs. Howard's and Mrs. Blount's. And I assure you, you ought to take as much pleasure in their hearts, if they are what they sometimes express with regard to you.</P>

<P>I Can't return from so agreeable an entertain∣ment as yours in the country, without ac∣knowledging it. I thank you heartily for the new agreeable idea of life you there gave me; it will remain long with me, for it is very strong∣ly impressed upon my imagination. I repeat the memory of it often, and shall value that faculty of the mind now more than ever, for the power it gives me of being entertained in your villa, when absent from it. As you are possessed of all the pleasures of the country, and, as I think, of a right mind, what can I wish you but health to enjoy them? This I so hear∣tily do, that I should be even glad to hear your good old mother might lose all her present pleasures in her unwearied care of you, by your better health convincing them it is unne∣cessary.</P>
<P>I am troubled and shall be so till I hear you have received this letter: for you gave me the greatest pleasure imaginable in yours, and I am impatient to acknowledge it. If I any ways deserve that friendly warmth and affection with
<PB N="68" REF="82"/>
which you write, it is, that I have a heart full of love and esteem for you: so truly, that I should lose the greatest pleasure of my life if I lost your good opinion. It rejoices me very much to be reckoned by you in the class of ho∣nest men; for tho' I am not troubled over∣much about the opinion most may have of me, yet, I own, it would grieve me not to be thought well of, by you and some few others. I will not doubt my own strength, yet I have this fur∣ther security to maintain my integrity, that I cannot part with that, without forfeiting your esteem with it.</P>
<P>Perpetual disorder and ill health have for some years so disguised me, that, I sometimes fear I do not to my best friends enough appear what I really am. Sickness is a great oppressor; it does great injury to a zealous heart, stifling its warmth, and not suffering it to break out in action. But, I hope, I shall not make this com∣plaint much longer. I have other hopes that please me too, tho' not so well grounded; these are, that you may yet make a journey west∣ward with Lord Bathurst; but of the probabi∣lity of this I do not venture to reason, because I would not part with the pleasure of that be∣lief. It grieves me to think how far I am re∣moved from you, and from that excellent Lord, whom I love! Indeed I remember him, as one
<PB N="69" REF="83"/>
that has made sickness easy to me, by bearing with my infirmities in the same manner that you have always done. I often too consider him in other lights that make him valuable to me. With him, I know not by what connec∣tion, you never fail to come into my mind, as if you were inseparable. I have, as you guess, many philosophical reveries in the shades of Sir Walter Raleigh, of which you are a great part. You generally enter there with me, and like a good Genius, applaud and strengthen all my sen∣timents that have honour in them. This good office which you have often done me unknow∣ingly, I must acknowledge now, that my own breast may not reproach me with ingratitude, and disquiet me when I would muse again in that solemn scene. I have not room now left to ask you many questions I intended about the Odyssey. I beg I may know how far you have carried Ulysses on his journey, and how you have been entertained with him on the way? I desire I may hear of your health, of Mrs. Pope's, and of every thing else that belongs to you.</P>
<P>How thrive your garden plants? how look the trees? how spring the Brocoli and the Fe∣nochio? hard names to spell! how did the pop∣pies bloom? and how is the great room ap∣proved? what parties have you had of plea∣sure?

Why will you ever, of your own accord, end such a millennary year in London? transmigrate (if I may so call it) into other creatures, in that scene of folly mi∣litant, when you may reign for ever at Hom∣lacy in sense and reason triumphant?

<P>I Have been above a month strolling about in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, from garden to garden, but still returning to Lord Cobham's with fresh satisfaction. I should be sorry to see my Lady Scudamore's, till it has had the full advantage of Lord B* improve∣ments; and then I will expect something like the waters of Riskins, and the woods of Oak∣ley together, which (without flattery) would be at least as good as any thing in our world:
<PB N="74" REF="88"/>
For as to the hanging gardens of Babylon, the Paradise of Cyrus, and the Sharawaggi's of China, I have little or no ideas of them, but, I dare say, Lord B* has, because they were cer∣tainly both very great, and very wild. I hope Mrs. Mary Digby is quite tired of his Lord∣ship's <HI>Extravagante Bergerie:</HI> and that she is just now sitting, or rather reclining on a bank, fatigued with over much dancing and singing at his unwearied request and instigation. I know your love of ease so well, that you might be in danger of being too quiet to enjoy quiet, and too philosophical to be a philosopher; were it not for the ferment Lord B. will put you into. One of his Lordship's maxims is, that a total abstinence from intemperance or bu∣siness, is no more philosophy, than a total con∣sopition of the senses is repose; one must feel enough of its contrary to have a relish of either. But, after all, let your temper work, and be as sedate and contemplative as you will, I'll en∣gage you shall be fit for any of us, when you come to town in the winter. Folly will laugh you into all the customs of the company here; nothing will be able to prevent your conver∣sion to her, but indisposition, which, I hope, will be far from you. I am telling the worst that can come of you; for as to vice, you are safe; but folly is many an honest man's, nay
<PB N="75" REF="89"/>
every good-humour'd man's lot: nay, it is the seasoning of life; and fools (in one sense) are the salt of the earth: a little is excellent, tho' indeed a whole mouthful is justly call'd the Devil.</P>
<P>So much for your diversions next winter, and for mine. I envy you much more at present, than I shall then; for if there be on earth an image of paradise, it is in such perfect Union and Society as you all possess. I would have my innocent envies and wishes of your state known to you all; which is far better than making you compliments, for it is inward ap∣probation and esteem.

<P>IT is now the season to wish you a good end of one year, and a happy beginning of an∣other: but both these you know how to make yourself, by only continuing such a life as you have been long accustomed to lead. As for good works, they are things I dare not name, either to those that do them, or to those that do them not; the first are too modest, and the
<PB N="76" REF="90"/>
latter too selfish, to bear the mention of what are become either too old-fashion'd, or too pri∣vate, to constitute any part of the vanity or re∣putation of the present age. However, it were to be wish'd people would now and then look upon good works as they do upon old wardrobes, merely in case any of them should by chance come into fashion again; as ancient fardingales revive in modern hoop'd petticoats, (which may be properly compared to charities, as they cover a multitude of sins.)</P>
<P>They tell me that at Coleshill certain anti∣quated charities, and obsolete devotions are yet subsisting: that a thing called Christian chear∣fulness (not incompatible with Christmas-pyes and plum-broth) whereof frequent is the men∣tion in old sermons and almanacks, is really kept alive and in practice: that feeding the hun∣gry, and giving alms to the poor, do yet make a part of good house-keeping, in a latitude not more remote from London than fourscore miles: and lastly, that prayers and roast-beef actually make some people as happy, as a whore and a bottle. But here in town, I assure you, men, women, and children have done with these things. Charity not only begins, but ends, at home. Instead of the four cardinal virtues, now reign four courtly ones: we have cun∣ning for prudence, rapine for justice, time∣serving
<PB N="77" REF="91" MS="y"/>
for fortitude, and luxury for temperance. Whatever you may fancy where you live in a state of ignorance, and see nothing but quiet, religion, and good-humour, the case is just as I tell you where people understand the world, and know how to live with credit and glory.</P>
<P>I wish that Heaven would open the eyes of men, and make them sensible which of these is right; whether, upon a due conviction, we are to quit faction, and gaming, and high-feeding, and all manner of luxury, and take to your country way? or you to leave prayers, and almsgiving, and reading, and exercise, and come into our measures?

degree equal even to yours, and a tye of friend∣ship approaches near to the tenderness of na∣ture: yet, God knows, no man living is less fit to comfort you, as no man is more deeply sensible than myself of the greatness of the loss. That very virtue, which secures his present state from all the sorrows incident to ours, does but aggran∣dise our sensation of its being remov'd from our sight, from our affection, and from our imita∣tion; for the friendship and society of good Men does not only make us happier, but it makes us better. Their Death does but com∣plete their felicity before our own, who proba∣bly are not yet arrived to that degree of perfec∣tion which merits an immediate reward. That your dear brother and my dear friend was so, I take his very removal to be a proof; Providence would certainly lend virtuous men to a world that so much wants them, as long as in its ju∣stice to them it could spare them to us. May my soul be with those who have meant well, and have acted well to that meaning! and, I doubt not, if this prayer be granted, I shall be with him. Let us preserve his memory in the way he would best like, by recollecting what his behaviour would have been, in every inci∣dent of our lives to come, and doing in each just as we think he would have done; so we shall have him always before our eyes, and in

I will add but one word that re∣lates to what remains of yourself and me, since so valued a part of us is gone; it is to beg you to accept, as yours by inheritance, of the va∣cancy he has left in a heart, which (while he could fill it with such hopes, wishes, and affec∣tions for him as suited a mortal creature) was truly and warmly his; and shall (I assure you in the sincerity of sorrow for my own loss) be faithfully at your service while I continue to love his memory, that is, while I continue to be myself.</P>

<P>I protest to you, this last perusal of him has given me such new degrees, I will not say of pleasure but of admiration and astonishment, that I look upon the sublimity of Homer, and the majesty of Virgil with somewhat less reve∣rence than I used to do. I challenge you, with all your partiality, to shew me in the first of these any thing equal to the Allegory of Sin and Death, either as to the greatness and justness of the invention, or the height and beauty of the colouring.

<DATELINE><DATE>Nov. 20, 1717.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I Am truly obliged by your kind condolence on my Father's death, and the desire you express that I should improve this incident to my advantage. I know your Lordship's friend∣ship to me is so extensive, that you include in that wish both my spiritual and my temporal advantage; and it is what I owe to that friend∣ship, to open my mind unreservedly to you on this head. It is true, I have lost a parent for whom no gains I could make would be any equivalent. But that was not my only tye: I thank God another still remains (and long may it remain) of the same tender nature: <HI>Geni∣trix est mihi</HI>—and excuse me if I say with Eu∣ryalus,
<Q><L>nequeam lacrymas perferre parentis.</L></Q>
A rigid divine may call it a carnal tye, but sure it is a virtuous one: at least I am more certain
<PB N="86" REF="100"/>
that it is a duty of nature to preserve a good parent's life and happiness, than I am of any speculative point whatever.</P>
<P><Q><L>Ignaram hujus quodcunque pericli</L>
<L>Hanc ego, nunc, linquam?</L></Q>
For she, my Lord, would think this separation more grievous than any other, and I, for my part, know as little as poor Euryalus did, of the success of such an adventure, (for an Ad∣venture it is, and no small one, in spite of the most positive divinity.) Whether the change would be to my spiritual advantage, God only knows: this I know, that I mean as well in the religion I now profess, as I can possibly ever do in another. Can a man who thinks so, justify a change, even if he thought both equal∣ly good? To such an one, the part of <HI>Joyning</HI> with any one body of Christians might perhaps be easy, but I think it would not be so, to <HI>Re∣nounce</HI> the other.</P>
<P>Your Lordship has formerly advis'd me to read the best controversies between the Churches, Shall I tell you a secret? I did so at fourteen years old, (for I loved reading, and my father had no other books) there was a collection of all that had been written on both sides in the reign of King James the second: I warm'd my head with them, and the consequence was, that
<PB N="87" REF="101"/>
I found myself a Papist and a Protestant by turns, according to the last book I read <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This is an admirable de∣scription of every Reader la∣bouring in religious contro∣versy, without possessing the <HI>principles</HI> on which a right judgment of the points in question is to be regulated.</NOTE>. I am afraid most Seekers are in the same case, and when they stop, they are not so properly converted, as out-witted. You see how little glory you would gain by my conversion. And after all, I verily believe your Lordship and I are both of the same religion, if we were tho∣roughly understood by one another, and that all honest and reasonable christians would be so, if they did but talk enough together every day; and had nothing to do together, but to serve God, and live in peace with their neighbour.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>temporal</HI> side of the question, I can have no dispute with you; it is certain, all the beneficial circumstances of life, and all the shining ones, lie on the part you would invite me to. But if I could bring myself to fancy, what I think you do but fancy, that I have any talents for active life, I want health for it; and besides it is a real truth, I have less Inclination (if possible) than Ability. Contemplative life is not only my scene, but it is my habit too. I begun my life where most people end theirs, with a dis-relish of all that the world calls Am∣bition:
<PB N="88" REF="102"/>
I don't know why 'tis call'd so, for to me it always seem'd to be rather <HI>stooping</HI> than <HI>climbing.</HI> I'll tell you my politic and reli∣gious sentiments in a few words. In my poli∣tics, I think no further than how to preserve the peace of my life, in any government un∣der which I live; nor in my religion, than to preserve the peace of my conscience, in any church with which I communicate. I hope all churches and all governments are so far of God, as they are rightly understood, and right∣ly administred: and where they are, or may be wrong, I leave it to God alone to mend or re∣form them; which whenever he does, it must be by greater instruments than I am. I am not a Papist, for I renounce the temporal inva∣sions of the Papal power, and detest their ar∣rogated authority over Princes and States. I am a Catholick in the strictest sense of the word. If I was born under an absolute Prince, I would be a quiet subject; but I thank God I was not. I have a due sense of the excellence of the Bri∣tish constitution. In a word, the things I have always wished to see are not a Roman Catho∣lic, or a French Catholic, or a Spanish Ca∣tholic, but a true Catholic: and not a King of Whigs, or a King of Tories, but a King of England. Which God of his mercy grant his present Majesty may be, and all future Ma∣jesties:

<P>I Hope you have some time ago receiv'd the Sulphur, and the two volumes of Mr. Gay, as instances (how small ones soever) that I wish you both health and diversion. What I now send for your perusal, I shall say nothing of; not to forestall by a single word what you pro∣mis'd to say upon that subject. Your Lord∣ship may criticise from Virgil to these Tales; as Solomon wrote of every thing from the cedar to the hyssop. I have some cause, since I last waited on you at Bromley, to look upon you as a prophet in that retreat, from whom oracles are to be had, were mankind wise enough to go thither to consult you: The fate of the South-sea Scheme has, much sooner than I expected, verify'd what you told me. Most people thought the time would come, but no man prepared for it; no man consider'd it would come <HI>like a Thief in the Night,</HI> exactly as it
<PB N="90" REF="104"/>
happens in the case of our death. Methinks God has punish'd the avaritious, as he often punishes sinners, in their own way, in the very sin itself: the thirst of gain was their crime, that thirst continued became their punishment and ruin. As for the few who have the good fortune, to remain with half of what they ima∣gined they had (among whom is your hum∣ble servant) I would have them sensible of their felicity, and convinced of the truth of old He∣siod's maxim, who, after half his estate was swallowed by the <HI>Directors</HI> of those days, re∣solv'd, that <HI>half</HI> to be <HI>more than the whole.</HI></P>
<P>Does not the fate of these people put you in mind of two passages, one in Job, the other from the Psalmist?</P>
<P>Men shall groan out of the <HI>CITY,</HI> and hiss them out of their <HI>PLACE.</HI></P>
<P>They have dreamed out their dream, and awak∣ing have found nothing in their hands.</P>
<P>Indeed the universal poverty, which is the consequence of universal avarice, and which will fall hardest upon the guiltless and indus∣trious part of mankind, is truly lamentable. The universal deluge of the S. Sea, contrary to the old deluge, has drowned all except a few <HI>Unrighteous</HI> men: but it is some comfort to me that I am not one of them, even tho' I were to survive and rule the world by it. I am much

pleas'd with a thought of Dr. Arbuthnot's; he says the Government and South-sea company have only lock'd up the money of the people, upon conviction of their Lunacy (as is usual in the case of Lunaticks) and intend to restore them as much as may be fit for such people, as fast as they shall see them return to their senses.</P>
<P>The latter part of your letter does me so much honour, and shews me so much kind∣ness, that I must both be proud and pleas'd, in a great degree; but I assure you, my Lord, much more the last than the first. For I cer∣certainly know, and feel, from my own heart which truly respects you, that there may be a ground for your partiality, one way; but I find not the least symptoms in my head, of any foundation for the other. In a word, the best reason I know for my being pleas'd, is, that you continue your favour toward me; the best I know for being proud, would be that you might cure me of it; for I have found you to be such a physician as does not only <HI>repair,</HI> but <HI>improve.</HI> I am, with the sincerest esteem, and most grateful acknowledgment,</P>

<P>THE Arabian Tales, and Mr. Gay's books, I receiv'd not till Monday night, together with your letter; for which I thank you. I have had a fit of the gout upon me ever since I returned hither from Westminster on Saturday night last: it has found its way into my hands as well as legs, so that I have been utterly in∣capable of writing. This is the first letter that I have ventured upon; which will be written, I fear, <HI>vacillantibus literis,</HI> as, Tully says, Ty∣ro's letters were, after his Recovery from an illness. What I said to you in mine about the Monument, was intended only to quicken, not to alarm you. It is not worth your while to know what I meant by it: but when I see you, you shall. I hope you may be at the Deanry, towards the end of October, by which time, I think of settling there for the winter. What do you think of some such short inscription as this in latin, which may, in a few words, say all that is to be said of Dryden, and yet nothing more than he deserves?</P>

<P>To shew you that I am as much in earnest in the affair, as you yourself, something I will send you too of this kind in English. If your design holds of fixing Dryden's name only be∣low, and his Busto above—may not lines like these be grav'd just under the name?</P>

<P>Or thus—

This you'll take as a proof of my zeal at least, tho' it be none of my talent in Poetry. When you have read it over, I'll forgive you if you should not once in your life-time again think of it.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, for your <HI>Arabian Tales.</HI> Ill as I have been, almost ever since they came to
<PB N="94" REF="108"/>
hand, I have read as much of them, as ever I shall read while I live. Indeed they do not please my taste: they are writ with so roman∣tick an air, and, allowing for the difference of eastern manners, are yet, upon any supposi∣tion that can be made, of so wild and absurd a contrivance (at least to my northern understand∣ing) that I have not only no pleasure, but no patience, in perusing them. They are to me like the odd paintings on Indian screens, which at first glance may surprize and please a little: but, when you fix your eye intently upon them, they appear so extravagant, disproportion'd, and monstrous, that they give a judicious eye pain, and make him seek for relief from some other object.</P>
<P>They may furnish the mind with some new images: but I think the purchase is made at too great an expence: for to read those two vo∣lumes through, liking them as little as I do, would be a terrible penance, and to read them with pleasure would be dangerous on the other side, because of the infection. I will never believe, that you have any keen relish of them, till I find you write worse than you do, which, I dare say, I never shall. Who that <HI>Petit de la Croise</HI> is, the pretended author of them <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Not the <HI>pretended Au∣thor,</HI> but the real translator, from an Arabic MS of the tales, which is in the French King's library. What was translated in ten small Vo∣lumes, is not more than the tenth part of the Original. The Eastern people have been always famous for this sort of Composition: in which much fine morality is con∣veyed; not indeed in a story always representing life and manners, but such as the ea∣stern superstitions made pass amongst the people for such. Their great genius for this kind of writing appears from these very tales. But the policy of some of the later princes of the East greatly hurt it, by setting all men upon composing them, to furnish matter for their cof∣fee-houses and places of re∣sort; which were enjoined to give this entertainment to the people, with design to divert them from politics, and matters of state. This Collection is so strange a medley of sense and nonsense, that one would be tempted to think the Collector was some Coffee-man, who ga∣thered indifferently from the best and worst. The con∣trivance he has invented of tying them together has led him into such a blunder that one could not be sur∣prized at anything. The tales are supposed to be told to one of the Kings of Persia of the ancient race before Ma∣homet, and yet the scene of some of them is laid in the Court of <HI>Harown Alras∣chid</HI> the 26<SUP>th</SUP> Chalif, and the 5<SUP>th</SUP> of the Race of <HI>Abba∣sides.</HI> These are amongst the best, and, indeed, it is no wonder. He was, of all the Chalifs, the most munifi∣cent, and the greatest en∣courager of Letters; so that it was natural for men of ge∣nius in after times, to do this honour to his memory. But the Bishop talks of <HI>Pe∣tit de la Croise.</HI> M. Gal∣land was the translator of the <HI>Arabian tales.</HI> The name of the other is to the collec∣tion, called the <HI>Persian tales,</HI> of which I have nothing to say.</NOTE>, I
<PB N="95" REF="109" MS="y"/>
cannot tell: but observing how full they are in the descriptions of dress, furniture, &amp;c. I can∣not help thinking them the product of some Woman's imagination: and, believe me, I would do any thing but break with you, ra∣ther
<PB N="96" REF="110"/>
than be bound to read them over with at∣tention.</P>
<P>I am sorry that I was so true a prophet in re∣spect of the S. Sea, sorry, I mean, as far as your loss is concern'd: for in the general I ever was and still am of opinion, that had that project taken root and flourish'd, it would by degrees have overturn'd our constitution. Three or four hun∣dred millions was such a weight, that which∣soever way it had leaned, must have born down all before it—But of the dead we must speak gently; and therefore, as Mr. Dryden says some∣where, <HI>Peace be to its Manes!</HI></P>
<P>Let me add one reflection, to make you easy in your ill luck. Had you got all that you have lost beyond what you ventur'd, consider that your superfluous gains would have sprung from the ruin of several families that now want necessaries! a thought, under which a good and good-natured man that grew rich by such means, could not, I persuade myself, be perfectly easy.

<P>I have sent Dr. Arbuthnot<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Of Huetius, bishop of Avranches, left after his death. He was a mean rea∣soner: he once attempted it in a vast collection of fan∣ciful and extravagant con∣jectures, which he called a <HI>Demonstration;</HI> mixed up with much reading, which his friends called learning, and delivered (by the allowance of all) in good latin. This not being received for what he would give it, he composed a treatise <HI>of the weakness of the human understanding:</HI> a poor system of scepticism; in∣deed little other than an abs∣tract from <HI>Sextus Empiricus.</HI></NOTE> the Latin MS. which I could not find when you left me; and I am so angry at the writer for his design, and his manner of executing it, that I could hard∣ly forbear sending him a line of Virgil along with it. The chief Reasoner of that philoso∣phic farce is a <HI>Gallo-Ligur,</HI> as he is call'd—what that means in English or French, I can't say—but all he says, is in so loose and slippery and

To be serious, I hate to see a book gravely written, and in all the forms of argumentation, which proves nothing, and which says no∣thing; and endeavours only to put us into a way of distrusting our own faculties, and doubt∣ing whether the marks of truth and falshood can in any case be distinguished from each other.

I am surpriz'd to find that my Lord Bathurst and you are parted so soon; he has been sick, I know, of some late transactions but should that sickness continue still in some measure, I prophesy, it will be quite off by the begin∣ning of November: a letter or two from his London-friends, and a surfeit of solitude will soon make him change his resolution and his quarters. I vow to you, I could live here with pleasure all the winter, and be contented with hearing no more news than the London Jour∣nal, or some such trifling paper, affords me, did not the duty of my place require, absolutely require my attendance at Westminster; where, I hope, the Prophet will now and then remem∣ber he has a bed and a candlestic. In short, I long to see you, and hope you will come, if not a day, yet at least an hour sooner to town than you intended, in order to afford me that satisfaction. I am now, I thank God! as well as ever I was in my life, except that I can walk scarce at all without crutches: And I would willingly compound the matter with the gout, to be no better, could I hope to be no worse; but that is a vain thought, I expect a new at∣tack long before Christmas. Let me see you therefore while I am in a condition to relish you, before the days (and the nights) come,
<PB N="106" REF="120"/>
when I shall (and must) say, I have no plea∣sure in them.</P>
<P>I will bring your small volume of Pastorals along with me, that you may not be discou∣raged from lending me books, when you find me so punctual in returning them. Shakespear shall bear it company, and be put into your hands as clear and as fair as it came out of them, tho' you, I think, have been dabbling here and there with the text: I have had more reve∣rence for the writer and the printer, and left every thing standing just as I found it. How∣ever, I thank you for the pleasure you have given me in putting me upon reading him once more before I die.</P>
<P>I believe I shall scarce repeat that pleasure any more, having other work to do, and other things to think of, but none that will interfere with the offices of friendship, in the exchange of which with you, Sir, I hope to live and die</P>

<P>P. S. Addison's works came to my hands yesterday. I cannot but think it a very odd set of incidents, that the book should be dedicated by a<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Mr. Addison.</NOTE> dead man to<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Mr. Craggs.</NOTE> a dead man; and even that the new<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Lord Warwick.</NOTE> patron to whom Tickell chose to in∣scribe

his verses, should be dead also before they were published. Had I been in the Edi∣tor's place I should have been a little appre∣hensive for myself, under a thought that every one who had any hand in that work was to die before the publication of it. You see, when I am conversing with you, I know not how to give over, till the very bottom of the paper ad∣monishes me once more to bid you adieu!</P>

<P>IT is so long since I had the pleasure of an hour with your Lordship, that I should be∣gin to think myself no longer <HI>Amicus omnium horarum,</HI> but for finding myself so in my con∣stant thoughts of you. In those I was with you many hours this very day, and had you (where I wish and hope one day to see you really) in my garden at Twitnam. When I went last to town, and was on wing for the Deanry, I heard your Lordship was gone the day before to Bromley, and there you continued till after my return hither. I sincerely wish you what∣ever you wish yourself, and all you wish your friends or family. All I mean by this word

<P>PErmit me, dear Sir, to break into your re∣tirement, and to desire of you a complete copy of those verses on Mr. Addison <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">An imperfect Copy was got out, very much to the Au∣thor's surprize, who never would give any. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>; send me also your last resolution, which shall punctually be observ'd in relation to my giving out any co∣py of it; for I am again sollicited by another Lord, to whom I have given the same answer as formerly. No small piece of your writing has been ever sought after so much: it has pleas'd every man without exception, to whom it has been read. Since you now therefore know where your real strength lies, I hope you will

For my part, I should be so glad to see you finish something of that kind, that I could be con∣tent to be a little sneer'd at in a line or so, for the sake of the pleasure I should have in read∣ing the rest. I have talk'd my sense of this matter to you once or twice, and now I put it under my hand, that you may see it is my de∣liberate opinion. What weight that may have with you I cannot say: but it pleases me to have an opportunity of shewing you how well I wish you, and how true a friend I am to your fame, which I desire may grow every day, and in every kind of writing, to which you shall please to turn your pen. Not but that I have some little interest in the proposal, as I shall be known to have been acquainted with a man that was capable of excelling in such different manners, and did such honour to his country and language; and yet was not displeas'd some∣times to read what was written by his humble servant.</P>

<P>I Was disappointed (much more than those who commonly use that phrase on such oc∣casions)
<PB N="110" REF="124"/>
in missing you at the Deanry, where I lay solitary two nights. Indeed I truly par∣take in any degree of concern that affects you, and I wish every thing may succeed as you de∣sire in your own family, and in that which, I think, you no less account your own, and is no less your family, the whole world: for I take you to be one of the true Friends of it, and to your power its protector. Tho' the noise and daily bustle for the public be now over, I dare say, a good man is still tendring its welfare; as the Sun in the winter, when seeming to retire from the world, is preparing benedictions and warmth for a better season. No man wishes your Lordship more quiet, more tranquillity, than I, who know you should understand the value of it: but I don't wish you a jot less con∣cern'd or less active than you are, in all sincere, and therefore warm, desires of public good.</P>
<P>I beg the kindness (and 'tis for that chiefly I trouble you with this letter) to favour me with notice as soon as you return to London, that I may come and make you a proper visit of a day or two: for hitherto I have not been your Visiter, but your Lodger, and I accuse my∣self of it. I have now no earthly thing to ob∣lige my being in town (a point of no small sa∣tisfaction to me) but the best reason, the see∣ing a friend. As long, my Lord, as you will

let me call you so (and I dare say you will, till I forfeit what, I think, I never shall, my ve∣racity and integrity) I shall esteem myself for∣tunate, in spite of the South-sea, Poetry, Popery, and Poverty.</P>
<P>I can't tell you how sorry I am, you should be troubled a-new by any sort of people. I heartily wish, <HI>Quod superest, ut tibi vivas</HI>—that you may teach me how to do the same: who, without any real impediment to acting and living rightly, do act and live as foolishly as if I were a Great man.</P>

<P>AS a visitant, a lodger, a friend (or under what other denomination soever) you are always welcome to me; and will be more so, I hope, every day that we live: for, to tell you the truth, I like you as I like myself, best when we have both of us least business. It has been my fate to be engaged in it much and often, by the stations in which I was placed: but God, that knows my heart, knows, I never lov'd it:
<PB N="112" REF="126"/>
and am still less in love with it than ever, as I find less temptation to act with any hope of success. If I am good for any thing, 'tis <HI>in angulo cum libello;</HI> and yet a good part of my time has been spent, and perhaps must be spent, far otherwise. For I will never, while I have health, be wanting to my duty in any post, or in any respect, how little soever I may like my employment, and how hopeless soever I may be in the discharge of it.</P>

I cannot say I do so now, for I am here without any books, and if I had them could not use them to my satisfaction, while my mind is taken up in a more melancholy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In his Lady's last Sickness. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> manner; and how long, or how little a while it may be so taken up God only knows, and to his will I implicitly resign myself in every thing.</P>

<P>I Am extremely sensible of the repeated fa∣vour of your kind letters, and your thoughts of me in absence, even among thoughts of much nearer concern to yourself on the one hand, and of much more importance to the world on the other, which cannot but engage you at this juncture. I am very certain of your good will, and of the warmth which is in you inseparable from it.</P>
<P>Your remembrance of Twitenham is a fresh instance of that partiality. I hope the advance of the fine season will set you upon your legs, enough to enable you to get into my garden, where I will carry you up a Mount, in a point of view to shew you the glory of my little king∣dom. If you approve it, I shall be in danger to boast, like Nebuchadnezzar, of the things I have made, and to be turn'd to converse, not with the beasts of the field, but with the birds of the grove, which I shall take to be no great punishment. For indeed I heartily despise the ways of the world, and most of the great ones of it.</P>
<P><Q><L>Oh keep me innocent, make others great!</L></Q>
<PB N="114" REF="128"/>
And you may judge how comfortably I am strengthen'd in this opinion, when such as your Lordship bear testimony to its vanity and em∣ptiness. <HI>Tinnit, inane est,</HI> with the picture of one ringing on the globe with his finger, is the best thing I have the luck to remember in that great Poet Quarles (not that I forget the Devil at bowls; which I know to be your Lordship's favourite cut, as well as favourite diversion.)</P>
<P>The situation here is pleasant, and the view rural enough, to humour the most retired, and agree with the most contemplative. Good air, solitary groves, and sparing diet, sufficient to make you fancy yourself (what you are in tem∣perance, tho' elevated into a greater figure by your station) one of the Fathers of the Desert. Here you may think (to use an author's words, whom you so justly prefer to all his followers that you'll receive them kindly, tho' taken from his worst work <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Paradise Regain'd.</HI> I suppose this was in compli∣ment to the Bishop.

<P>UNDER all the leisure in the world, I have no leisure, no stomach to write to you: The gradual approaches of death are be∣fore my eyes; I am convinced that it must be so; and yet make a shift to flatter myself some∣times with the thought, that it may possibly be otherwise. And that very thought, tho' it is directly contrary to my reason, does for a few moments make me easy—however not easy enough in good earnest to think of any thing but the melancholy object that employs them. Therefore wonder not that I do not answer your kind letter: I shall answer it too soon, I fear, by accepting your friendly invitation.
<PB N="116" REF="130"/>
When I do so, no conveniencies will be want∣ing: for I'll see no body but you and your mother, and the servants. Visits to statesmen always were to me (and are now more than ever) insipid things; let the men that expect, that wish to thrive by them, pay them that homage; I am free. When I want them, they shall hear of me at their doors: and when they want me, I shall be sure to hear of them at mine. But probably they will despise me so much, and I shall court them so little, that we shall both of us keep our distance.</P>
<P>When I come to you, 'tis in order to be with you only; a president of the council, or a star and garter will make no more impression upon my mind, at such a time, than the hear∣ing of a bag-pipe, or the sight of a puppet-shew. I have said to Greatness sometime ago—<HI>Tuas tibi res habeto, Egomet curabo meas.</HI> The time is not far off when we shall all be upon the level: and I am resolv'd, for my part, to anti∣cipate that time, and be upon the level with them now: for he is so, that neither seeks nor wants them. Let them have more virtue and less pride: and then I'll court them as much as any body: but till they resolve to distinguish themselves some way else than by their outward trappings, I am determined (and, I think, I have a right) to be as proud as they are: tho' I trust
<PB N="117" REF="131"/>
in God, my pride is neither of so odious a nature as theirs, nor of so mischievous a con∣sequence.</P>
<P>I know not how I have fallen into this train of thinking—when I sat down to write I in∣tended only to excuse myself for not writing, and to tell you that the time drew nearer and nearer, when I must dislodge; I am preparing for it: For I am at this moment building a vault in the Abby for me and mine. 'Twas to be in the Abby, because of my relation to the place; but 'tis at the west door of it: as far from Kings and Kaesars as the space will admit of.</P>
<P>I know not but I may step to town to morrow, to see how the work goes forward; but, if I do, I shall return hither in the evening. I would not have given you the trouble of this letter but that they tell me it will cost you no∣thing, and that our privilege of Franking (one of the most valuable we have left) is again allow'd us.</P>

<P>I Had much ado to get hither last night, the water being so rough that the ferry-men

were unwilling to venture. The first thing I saw this morning after my eyes were open, was your letter, for the freedom and kindness of which I thank you. Let all compliments be laid aside between us for the future; and de∣pend upon me as your faithful friend in all things within my power, as one that truly values you, and wishes you all manner of happiness. I thank you and Mrs. Pope for my kind recep∣tion, which has left a pleasing impression upon me that will not soon be effaced.</P>
<P>Lord * has press'd me terribly to see him at * and told me in a manner betwixt kindness and resentment, that it is but a few miles be∣yond Twitenham.</P>
<P>I have but a little time left, and a great deal to do in it; and must expect that ill health will render a good share of it useless; and therefore what is likely to be left at the foot of the ac∣count, ought by me to be cherish'd, and not thrown away in compliments. You know the Motto of my sun-dial, <HI>Vivite, ait, fugio.</HI> I will, as far as I am able, follow its advice, and cut off all unnecessary avocations and amuse∣ments. There are those that intend to employ me this winter in a way I do not like: If they persist in their intentions, I must apply myself to the work they cut out for me, as well as I

can. But withal, that shall not hinder me from employing myself also in a way which they do not like. The givers of trouble one way shall have their share of it another; that at last they may be induced to let me be quiet, and live to myself, with the few (the very few) friends I like; for that is the point, the single point, I now aim at; tho', I know, the gene∣rality of the world who are unacquainted with my intentions and views, think the very reverse of this character belongs to me. I don't know how I have rambled into this account of my∣self; when I fat down to write, I had no thought of making that any part of my letter.</P>
<P>You might have been sure without my tell∣ing you, that my right hand is at ease; else I should not have overflow'd at this rate. And yet I have not done, for there is a kind inti∣mation in the end of yours, which I under∣stood, because it seems to tend towards em∣ploying me in something that is agreeable to you. Pray explain yourself, and believe that you have not an acquaintance in the world that would be more in earnest on such an occasion than I, for I love you, as well as esteem you.</P>
<P>All the while I have been writing, Pain, and a fine Thrush have been severally endea∣vouring to call off my attention; but both in vain, nor should I yet part with you, but that
<PB N="120" REF="134"/>

The Duchess's<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Duchess of Buckingham.</NOTE> letter concerns me nearly, and you know it, who know all my thoughts without disguise: I must keep clear of Flattery; I will: and as this is an honest resolution, I dare hope, your Lordship will not be so uncon∣cern'd for my keeping it, as not to assist me in so doing. I beg therefore you would represent thus much at least to her Grace, that as to the fear she seems touch'd with, [That the Duke's memory should have no advantage but what he must give himself, without being beholden to any one friend] your Lordship may certainly, and agreeably to your character, both of rigid honour and Christian plainness, tell her, that no man can have any other advantage: and that all offerings of friends in such a case pass for nothing. Be but so good as to confirm what I've repre∣sented to her, that an inscription in the antient way, plain, pompous, yet modest, will be the most uncommon, and therefore the most distinguishing manner of doing it. And so, I hope, she will be satisfied, the Duke's honour be preserv'd, and my integrity also: which is too sacred a thing to be forfeited, in consideration of any little (or what people of quality may call great) Honour or distinction whatever, which those of their rank can bestow on one of mine; and which indeed they are apt to over-rate, but

never so much, as when they imagine us under any obligation to say one untrue word in their favour.</P>
<P>I can only thank you, my Lord, for the kind transition you make from common busi∣ness, to that which is the only real business of every reasonable creature. Indeed I think more of it than you imagine, tho' not so much as I ought. I am pleas'd with those Latin verses extremely, which are so very good that I thought them yours, 'till you call'd them an Horatian Cento, and then I recollected the <HI>dis∣jecti membra poetae.</HI> I won't pretend I am so totally in those sentiments which you compli∣ment me with, as I yet hope to be: You tell me I have them, as the civillest method to put me in mind how much it fits me to have them.

Give my faithful services to Dr. Arbuthnot, and thanks for what he sent me, which was much to the purpose, if any thing can be said to be to the purpose, in a case that is already determined.

<P>IT is not possible to express what I think, and what I feel; only this, that I have thought and felt for nothing but you, for some time past: and shall think of nothing so long for the time to come. The greatest comfort I had was an intention (which I would have made practicable) to have attended you in your journey, to which I had brought that person to consent, who only could have hindered me, by a tye which, tho' it may be more tender, I do not think more strong, tha that of friend∣ship. But I fear there will be no way left me to tell you this great truth, that I remember you, that I love you, that I am grateful to you, that I entirely esteem and value you: no way but that one, which needs no open war∣rant to authorize it, or secret conveyance to secure it; which no bills can preclude, and no Kings prevent; a way that can reach to any part of the world where you may be, where the very whisper or even the wish of a friend must not be heard, or even suspected: by this way, I dare tell my esteem and affection of you, to your enemies in the gates, and you, and they, and their sons, may hear of it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="143"/>
You prove yourself, my Lord, to know me for the friend I am; in judging that the man∣ner of your Defence, and your Reputation by it, is a point of the highest concern to me: and assuring me, it shall be such, that none of your friends shall blush for you. Let me further prompt you to do yourself the best and most lasting justice: the instruments of your Fame to posterity will be in your own hands. May it not be, that providence has appointed you to some great and useful work, and calls you to it this severe way? You may more eminently and more effectually serve the Public even now, than in the stations you have so honourably fill'd. Think of Tully, Bacon, and Claren∣don <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon indeed wrote his best works in his banish∣ment: but the best of Ba∣con's were written before his disgrace, and the best of Tully's after his return from exile.</NOTE>: is it not the latter, the disgraced part of their lives, which you most envy, and which you would choose to have liv'd?</P>
<P>I am tenderly sensible of the wish you ex∣press, that no part of your misfortune may pursue me. But, God knows, I am every day less and less fond of my native country (so torn as it is by Party-rage) and begin to consider a friend in exile as a friend in death; one gone before, where I am not unwilling nor unpre∣pared
<PB N="130" REF="144"/>
to follow after; and where (however various or uncertain the roads and voyages of another world may be) I cannot but entertain a pleasing hope that we may meet again.</P>
<P>I faithfully assure you, that in the mean time there is no one, living or dead, of whom I shall think oftener or better than of you. I shall look upon you as in a state between both, in which you will have from me all the passions and warm wishes that can attend the living, and all the respect and tender sense of loss, that we feel for the dead. And I shall ever depend up∣on your constant friendship, kind memory, and good offices, tho' I were never to see or hear the effects of them: like the trust we have in benevolent spirits, who, tho' we never see or hear them, we think, are constantly serving us, and praying for us.</P>
<P>Whenever I am wishing to write to you, I shall conclude you are intentionally doing so to me. And every time that I think of you, I will believe you are thinking of me. I never shall suffer to be forgotten (nay to be but faint∣ly remember'd) the honour, the pleasure, the pride I must ever have, in reflecting how fre∣quently you have delighted me, how kindly you have distinguish'd me, how cordially you have advis'd me! In conversation, in study, I shall always want you, and wish for you: In
<PB N="131" REF="145"/>
my most lively, and in my most thoughtful hours, I shall equally bear about me, the im∣pressions of you: And perhaps it will not be in This life only, that I shall have cause to re∣member and acknowledge the friendship of the Bishop of Rochester.</P>

<P>ONCE more I write to you, as I promis'd, and this once, I fear, will be the last! the Curtain will soon be drawn between my friend and me, and nothing left but to wish you a long good-night. May you enjoy a state of re∣pose in this life, not unlike that sleep of the soul which some have believ'd is to succeed it, where we lye utterly forgetful of that world from which we are gone, and ripening for that to which we are to go. If you retain any me∣mory of the past, let it only image to you what has pleas'd you best; sometimes present a dream of an absent friend, or bring you back an agree∣able conversation. But upon the whole, I hope you will think less of the time past than of the
<PB N="132" REF="146"/>
suture; as the former has been less kind to you than the latter infallibly will be. Do not envy the world your Studies; they will tend to the benefit of men against whom you can have no complaint, I mean of all Posterity; and per∣haps, at your time of life, nothing else is worth your care. What is every year of a wise man's life but a censure or critic on the past? Those whose date is the shortest, live long enough to laugh at one half of it: the boy despises the in∣fant, the man the boy, the philosopher both, and the Christian all. You may now begin to think your manhood was too much a puerility; and you'll never suffer your age to be but a second in∣fancy. The toys and baubles of your child∣hood are hardly now more below you, than those toys of our riper and of our declining years, the drums and rattles of Ambition, and the dirt and bubbles of Avarice. At this time, when you are cut off from a little society and made a citizen of the world at large, you should bend your talents not to serve a Party, or a few, but all mankind. Your Genius should mount above that mist in which its participation and neighbourhood with earth long involv'd it; to shine abroad and to heaven, ought to be the business and the glory of your present situation. Remember it was at such a time, that the great∣est lights of antiquity dazled and blazed the
<PB N="133" REF="147"/>
most, in their retreat, in their exile, or in their death: but why do I talk of dazling or blazing? it was then that they did good, that they gave light, and that they became Guides to mankind.</P>
<P>Those aims alone are worthy of spirits truly great, and such I therefore hope will be yours. Resentment indeed may remain, perhaps can∣not be quite extinguished, in the noblest minds; but Revenge never will harbour there: higher principles than those of the first, and better principles than those of the latter, will infalli∣bly influence men, whose thoughts and whose hearts are enlarged, and cause them to prefer the Whole to any part of mankind, especially to so small a part as one's single self.</P>
<P>Believe me, my Lord, I look upon you as a spirit entered into another life <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Bishop of Roches∣ter went into exile the month following, and continued in it till his death, which hap∣pen'd at Paris on the fifteenth day of February in the year 1732. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>, as one just upon the edge of Immortality; where the pas∣sions and affections must be much more exalt∣ed, and where you ought to despise all little views, and all mean retrospects <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding this, Mr. Pope was convinced, before the Bishop's death, that during his banishment he was in the intrigues of the Pretender. Tho', when he took his last leave of Mr. Pope, he told him, he would allow him to say his sentence was just, if he ever found he had any concerns with that family in his exile.</NOTE>. Nothing is
<PB N="134" REF="148"/>
worth your looking back; and therefore look forward, and make (as you can) the world look after you. But take care that it be not with pity, but with esteem and admiration.</P>

<P>YOU will wonder to see me in print; but how could I avoid it? The dead and the living, my friends and my foes, at home and abroad, call'd upon me to say something; and the reputation of an<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">E. of Clarendon's.</NOTE> History which I and all the world value, must have suffered, had I con∣tinued silent. I have printed it here, in hopes that somebody may venture to reprint it in Eng∣land, notwithstanding those two frightening words at the close of it <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Bishop's Name, set to his Vindication of Bishop Smalridge, Dr. Aldrich, and himself, from the scandalous Reflections of Oldmixon, re∣lating to the Publication of Lord Clarendon's History. Paris, 1731. 4to. since re∣printed in England. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. Whether that hap∣pens or not, it is fit you should have a sight of
<PB N="135" REF="149"/>
it, who, I know, will read it with some degree of satisfaction, as it is mine, tho' it should have (as it really has) nothing else to recommend it. Such as it is, <HI>Extremum hoc munus morientis habeto;</HI> for that may well be the case, con∣sidering that within a few months I am entering into my seventieth year: after which, even the healthy and the happy cannot much depend upon life, and will not, if they are wise, much desire it. Whenever I go, you will lose a friend who loves and values you extremely, if in my circumstances I can be said to be lost to any one, when dead, more than I am already whilst living. I expected to have heard from you by Mr. Morice, and wondered a little that I did not; but he owns himself in a fault, for not giving you due notice of his motions. It was not amiss that you forebore writing, on a head wherein I promis'd more than I was able to perform. Disgraced men fancy sometimes, that they preserve an influence, where when they endeavour to exert it, they soon see their mis∣take. I did so, my good friend, and acknow∣ledge it under my hand. You sounded the coast, and found out my error, it seems, before I was aware of it; but enough on this subject.</P>
<P>What are they doing in England to the ho∣nour of Letters; and particularly what are you doing? <HI>Ipse quid audes? Quae cir cumvolitas agi∣lis</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="150"/>
<HI>Thyma?</HI> Do you pursue the Moral plan you marked out, and seemed sixteen months ago so intent upon? Am I to see it perfected e'er I die, and are you to enjoy the reputation of it while you live? or do you rather chuse to leave the marks of your friendship, like the legacies of a will, to be read and enjoyed only by those who survive you? Were I as near you as I have been, I should hope to peep into the manu∣script before it was finished. But alas! there is, and will ever probably be a great deal of land and sea between us. How many books have come out of late in your parts, which you think I should be glad to peruse? Name them: The catalogue, I believe, will not cost you much trouble. They must be good ones in∣deed to challenge any part of my time, now I have so little of it left. I, who squandered whole days heretofore, now husband hours when the glass begins to run low, and care not to mispend them on trifles. At the end of the Lottery of Life, our last minutes, like tickets left in the wheel, rise in their valuation: They are not of so much worth perhaps in themselves as those which preceded, but we are apt to prize them more, and with reason. I do so, my dear friend, and yet think the most precious minutes of my life are well employ'd, in read∣ing what you write. But this is satisfaction
<PB N="137" REF="151"/>
I cannot much hope for, and therefore must betake myself to others less entertaining. Adieu! dear Sir, and forgive me engaging with one, whom you, I think, have reckoned among the heroes of the Dunciad. It was necessary for me either to accept of his dirty Challenge, or to have suffered in the esteem of the world by declining it.</P>
<P>My respects to your Mother; I send one of these papers for Dean Swift, if you have an op∣portunity, and think it worth while to convey it. My Country at this distance seems to me a strange sight, I know not how it appears to you, who are in the midst of the scene, and yourself a part of it; I wish you would tell me. You may write safely to Mr. Morice, by the honest hand that conveys this, and will return into these parts before Christmas; sketch out a rough draught of it, that I may be able to judge whether a return to it be really eligible, or whe∣ther I should not, like the Chemist in the bot∣tle, upon hearing Don Quevedo's account of Spain, desire to be corked up again.</P>
<P>After all, I do and must love my Country, with all its faults and blemishes; even that part of the constitution which wounded me unjustly, and itself through my side, shall ever be dear to me. My last wish shall be like that of fa∣ther Paul, <HI>Esto perpetua!</HI> and when I die at a
<PB N="138" REF="152"/>
distance from it, it will be in the same man∣ner as Virgil describes the expiring Peloponne∣sian,
<Q><L>Sternitur, et dulces moriens reminiscitur Argos.</L></Q>
Do I still live in the memory of my friends, as they certainly do in mine? I have read a good many of your paper-squabbles about me, and am glad to see such free concessions on that head, tho' made with no view of doing me a pleasure, but merely of loading another.</P>

<P>I Am not yet Master enough of myself, after the late wound I have receiv'd, to open my very heart to you, and am not content with less than that, whenever I converse with you. My thoughts are at present vainly, but pleasingly employ'd, on what I have lost, and can never recover. I know well I ought, for that rea∣son, to call them off to other subjects, but hi∣therto I have not been able to do it. By giv∣ing
<PB N="139" REF="153"/>
them the rein a little, and suffering them to spend their force, I hope in some time to check and subdue them. <HI>Multis fortunae vul∣neribus perculsus, huic uni me imparem sensi, et pene succubui.</HI> This is weakness, not wisdom, I own; and on that account fitter to be trusted to the bosom of a friend, where I may safely lodge all my infirmities. As soon as my mind is in some measure corrected and calm'd, I will endeavour to follow your advice, and turn it to something of use and moment; if I have still life enough left to do any thing that is worth reading and preserving. In the mean time I shall be pleas'd to hear that you proceed in what you intend, without any such melancho∣ly interruption as I have met with. Your mind is as yet unbroken by age and ill accidents, your knowledge and judgment are at the height: use them in writing somewhat that may teach the present and future times, and if not gain equally the applause of both, may yet raise the envy of the one, and secure the admiration of the other. Employ not your precious mo∣ments, and great talents, on little men and lit∣tle things; but chuse a subject every way wor∣thy of you, and handle it as you can, in a man∣ner which no-body else can equal or imitate. As for me, my abilities, if I ever had any,
<PB N="140" REF="154"/>
are not what they were: and yet I will endea∣vour to recollect and employ them.</P>
<Q><L>gelidus tardante senecta</L></Q>
<P><HI>Sanguis hebet, frigentque effoeto in corpore vires.</HI> However, I should be ingrateful to this place, if I did not own that I have gained upon the gout in the south of France, much more than I did at Paris: tho' even there I sensibly improved. I believe my cure had been perfected, but the earnest desire of meeting One I dearly loved, called me abruptly to Montpelier; where after continuing two months, under the cruel tor∣ture of a sad and fruitless expectation, I was forced at last to take a long journey to Tou∣louse; and even there I had miss'd the person I sought, had she not, with great spirit and cou∣rage, ventured all night up the Garonne to see me, which she above all things desired to do before she died. By that means she was brought where I was, between seven and eight in the morning, and liv'd twenty hours afterwards, which time was not lost on either side, but pass'd in such a manner as gave great satisfac∣tion to both, and such as on her part, every way became her circumstances and character. For she had her senses to the very last gasp, and ex∣erted them to give me, in those few hours, greater marks of Duty and Love than she had done in all her life time, tho' she had never
<PB N="141" REF="155"/>
been wanting in either. The last words she said to me were the kindest of all; a reflection on the goodness of God, which had allow'd us in this manner to meet once more, before we parted for ever. Not many minutes after that, she laid herself on her pillow, in a sleeping pos∣ture,
<Q><L>placidaque ibi demum morte quievit.</L></Q>
Judge you, Sir, what I felt, and still feel on this occasion, and spare me the trouble of describing it. At my Age, under my Infirmities, among ut∣ter Strangers, how shall I find out proper re∣liefs and supports? I can have none, but those with which Reason and Religion furnish me, and those I lay hold on, and grasp as fast as I can. I hope that He, who laid the burthen upon me (for wise and good purposes no doubt) will enable me to bear it, in like manner as I have born others, with some degree of fortitude and firmness.</P>
<P>You see how ready I am to relapse into an argument which I had quitted once before in this letter. I shall probably again commit the same fault, if I continue to write; and there∣fore I stop short here, and with all sincerity, affection, and esteem, bid you adieu! till we meet either in this world, if God pleases, or else in another.</P>

<P>YOU writ me a very kind Letter some months ago, and told me you were then upon the point of taking a journey into Devon∣shire. That hindered my answering you, and I have since several times inquired of you, with∣out any satisfaction; for so I call the know∣ledge of your welfare, or of any thing that con∣cerns you. I past two months in Sussex, and since my return have been again very ill. I writ to Lintot in hopes of hearing of you, but had no answer to that point. Our friend Mr. Cromwell too has been silent all this year; I believe he has been displeased at some or other

of my freedoms <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">We see by the letters to Mr. Cromwell, that Mr. Pope was used to railly him on his turn for trifling and pedantic criticism.

<P>IT has been my good fortune within this month past, to hear more things that have pleas'd me than (I think) almost in all my time beside. But nothing upon my word has been so home-felt a satisfaction as the news you tell me of yourself: and you are not in the least mistaken, when you congratulate me upon your own good success: for I have more people out of whom to be happy, than any ill-natur'd man can boast of. I may with honesty affirm to you, that, notwithstanding the many inconveni∣ences and disadvantages they commonly talk of in the <HI>Res angusta domi,</HI> I have never found any other, than the inability of giving people of merit the only certain proof of our value for them, in doing them some real service.

I have been near a week in London, where I am like to remain, till I become, by Mr. Jervas's help, <HI>Elegans Forma∣rum Spectator.</HI> I begin to discover beauties that were till now imperceptible to me. Every corner of an eye, or turn of a nose or ear, the smallest degree of light or shade on a cheek, or in a dimple, have charms to distract me. I no longer look upon Lord Plausible as ridiculous, for admiring a Lady's fine tip of an ear and pretty elbow (as the <HI>Plain-Dealer</HI> has it) but am in some danger even from the ugly and disagree∣able, since they may have their retired beau∣ties, in one trait or other about them. You may guess in how uneasy a state I am, when every day the performances of others appear more beautiful and excellent, and my own more de∣spicable. I have thrown away three Dr. Swifts, each of which was once my vanity, two Lady Bridgwaters, a Duchess of Montague, besides half a dozen Earls, and one knight of the gar∣ter. I have crucified Christ over again in effi∣gie, and made a Madona as old as her mother St. Anne. Nay, what is yet more miraculous, I have rivall'd St. Luke himself in painting, and as, 'tis said, an angel came and finish'd his piece, so, you would swear, a devil put the last hand to mine, 'tis so begrim'd and smutted.

However I comfort myself with a Christian re∣flection, that I have not broken the command∣ment, for my pictures are not the likeness of any thing in heaven above, or in earth below, or in the water under the earth.

<P>WElcome to your native soil <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of this year Mr. Gay went over to Hanover with the Earl of Clarendon, who was sent thi∣ther by Q: Anne. On her death they returned to Eng∣land: and it was on this oc∣casion that Mr. Pope met him with this friendly wel∣come.</NOTE>! welcome to your friends! thrice welcome to me! whether returned in glory, blest with court∣interest, the love and familiarity of the great, and fill'd with agreeable hopes; or melancholy with dejection, contemplative of the changes of fortune, and doubtful for the future: Whether return'd a triumphant Whig, or a desponding Tory, equally all hail! equally beloved and welcome to me! If happy, I am to partake in your elevation; if unhappy, you have still a warm corner in my heart, and a retreat at Bin∣field in the worst of times at your service. If you are a Tory, or thought so by any man, I know it can proceed from nothing but your gratitude to a few people who endeavour'd to serve you, and whose politics were never your concern. If you are a Whig, as I rather hope, and, as I think, your principles and mine (as bro∣ther poets) had ever a bias to the side of Li∣berty, I know you will be an honest man, and
<PB N="149" REF="163"/>
an inoffensive one. Upon the whole, I know, you are incapable of being so much of either party as to be good for nothing. Therefore once more, whatever you are, or in whatever state you are, all hail!</P>
<P>One or two of your old friends complain'd they had heard nothing from you since the Queen's death: I told them no man living lov'd Mr. Gay better than I, yet I had not once writ∣ten to him in all his voyage. This I thought a convincing proof, how truly one may be a friend to another without telling him so every month. But they had reasons too themselves to alledge in your excuse; as men who really value one another, will never want such as make their friends and themselves easy. The late Universal concern in public affairs, threw us all into a hurry of spirits: even I, who am more a Philosopher than to expect any thing from any Reign, was borne away with the cur∣rent, and full of the expectation of the Suc∣cessor: During your journeys I knew not whi∣ther to aim a letter after you; that was a sort of shooting flying: add to this the demand Ho∣mer had upon me, to write fifty verses a day, besides learned notes, all which are at a conclu∣sion for this year. Rejoice with me, O my friend, that my labour is over; come and make merry with me in much feasting: We will
<PB N="150" REF="164"/>
feed among the lilies (by the lilies I mean the Ladies.) Are not the Rosalinda's of Britain as charming as the Blousalinda's of the Hague? or have the two great Pastoral poets of our nation renounced love at the same time? for Philips, immortal Philips hath deserted, yea, and in a rustic manner kicked, his Rosalind. Dr. Par∣nelle and I have been inseparable ever since you went. We are now at the Bath, where (if you are not, as I heartily hope, better engaged) your coming would be the greatest pleasure to us in the world. Talk not of expences: Ho∣mer shall support his children. I beg a line from you directed to the Post-house in Bath. Poor Parnelle is in an ill state of health.</P>
<P>Pardon me if I add a word of advice in the poetical way. Write something on the King, or Prince, or Princess. On whatsoever foot you may be with the court, this can do no harm—I shall never know where to end, and am confounded in the many things I have to say to you, tho' they all amount but to this, that I am entirely, as ever,</P>

<P>I Am extremely glad to find by a Letter of yours to Mr. Fortescue, that you have re∣ceived one from me; and I beg you to keep as the greatest of curiosities, that letter of mine which you received, and I never writ.</P>
<P>But the truth is, that we were made here to expect you in a short time, that I was upon the ramble most part of the Summer, and have concluded the season in grief, for the death of my poor father.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into a detail of my concerns and troubles, for two reasons; because I am really afflicted and need no airs of grief, and be∣cause they are not the concerns and troubles of any but myself. But I think you (without too great a compliment) enough my friend, to be pleas'd to know he died easily, without a groan, or the sickness of two minutes; in a word, as silently and peacefully as he lived.</P>
<Q><L>Sic mihi contingat vivere, sicque mori!</L></Q>
<P>I am not in the humour to say gay things, nor in the affectation of avoiding them. I can't pretend to entertain either Mr. Pulteney or you, as you have done both my Lord Burlington and
<PB N="152" REF="166"/>
me, by your letter to Mr. Lowndes <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>A Poem intituled,</HI> To my ingenious and worthy friend W. Lowndes, Esq. Author of that celebrated treatise in Folio, called the <HI>LAND-TAX BILL.</HI></NOTE>. I am only sorry you have no greater quarrel to Mr. Lowndes, and wish you paid some hundreds a year to the land-tax. That gentleman is lately become an inoffensive person to me too; so that we may join heartily in our addresses to him, and (like true patriots) rejoice in all that good done to the nation and government, to which we contribute nothing ourselves.</P>
<P>I should not forget to acknowledge your let∣ter sent from Aix; you told me then that writ∣ing was not good with the waters, and, I find since, you are of my opinion, that 'tis as bad without the waters. But, I fancy, it is not writing but thinking, that is so bad with the waters; and then you might write without any manner of prejudice, if you writ like our bro∣ther Poets of these days.</P>
<P>The Duchess, Lord Warwick, Lord Stan∣hope, Mrs. Bellenden, Mrs. Lepell, and I can't tell who else, had your letters: Dr. Arbuthnot and I expect to be treated like Friends. I would send my services to Mr. Pulteney, but that he is out of favour at court; and make some compliment to Mrs. Pulteney, if she were not a Whig. My Lord Burlington tells me she
<PB N="153" REF="167"/>
has much out-shin'd all the French ladies, as she did the English before: I am sorry for it, because it will be detrimental to our holy reli∣gion, if heretical women should eclipse those Nuns and orthodox Beauties, in whose eyes alone lie all the hopes we can have, of gaining such fine gentlemen as you to our church.</P>

<P>THE only news that you can expect to have from me here, is news from hea∣ven, for I am quite out of the world, and there is scarce any thing can reach me except the noise of thunder, which undoubtedly you have heard too. We have read in old authors of high towers levell'd by it to the ground, while the humble valleys have escap'd: the only thing that is proof against it is the laurel, which, how∣ever,
<PB N="154" REF="168"/>
I take to be no great security to the brains of modern authors. But to let you see that the contrary to this often happens, I must acquaint you, that the highest and most extravagant heap of towers in the universe, which is in this neigh∣bourhood, stands still undefaced, while a cock of barley in our next field has been consumed to ashes. Would to God that this heap of bar∣ley had been all that had perished! for unhap∣pily beneath this little shelter sate two much more constant Lovers than ever were found in Romance under the shade of a beech-tree. John Hewet was a well-set man of about five and twenty, Sarah Drew might be rather cal∣led comely than beautiful, and was about the same age. They had pass'd thro' the various labours of the year together, with the greatest satisfaction; if she milk'd, 'twas his morning and evening care, to bring the cows to her hand; it was but last fair that he bought her a present of green silk for her straw hat, and the posie on her silver ring was of his chusing. Their love was the talk of the whole neigh∣bourhood; for scandal never affirm'd, that they had any other views than the lawful possession of each other in marriage. It was that very morning that he had obtain'd the consent of her parents, and it was but till the next week that they were to wait to be happy. Perhaps in
<PB N="155" REF="169"/>
the intervals of their work they were now talk∣ing of the wedding cloaths, and John was suit∣ing several sorts of poppies and field flowers to her complexion, to chuse her a knot for the wedding-day. While they were thus busied, (it was on the last of July between two or three in the afternoon) the clouds grew black, and such a storm of lightning and thunder ensued, that all the labourers made the best of their way to what shelter the trees and hedges af∣forded. Sarah was frightned, and fell down in a swoon on a heap of barley. John, who never separated from her, sat down by her side, hav∣ing raked together two or three heaps, the bet∣ter to secure her from the storm. Immediately there was heard so loud a crack, as if heaven had split asunder; every one was now sollici∣tous for the safety of his neighbour, and called to one another throughout the field: No an∣swer being returned to those who called to our Lovers, they stept to the place where they lay; they perceived the barley all in a smoke, and then spied this faithful pair: John with one arm about Sarah's neck, and the other held over her, as to skreen her from the lightning. They were struck dead, and stiffen'd in this tender posture. Sarah's left eye-brow was sing'd, and there appeared a black spot on her breast: her lover was all over black, but not
<PB N="156" REF="170"/>
the least signs of life were found in either. At∣tended by their melancholy companions, they were convey'd to the town, and the next day were interr'd in Stanton-Harcourt Church-yard. My Lord Harcourt, at Mr. Pope's and my re∣quest, has caused a stone to be placed over them, upon condition that we furnish'd the Epitaph, which is as follows;</P>

<P>I Thank you for remembring me; I would do my best to forget myself, but that, I find, your idea is so closely connected to me, that I must forget both together, or neither. I am sorry I could not have a glympse either of you, or of the Sun (your father) before you went for Bath: But now it pleases me to see him, and hear of you. Pray put Mr. Congreve in mind that he has one on this side of the world who loves him; and that there are more men and women in the universe than Mr. Gay and my Lady Duchess. There are ladies in and about Richmond, that pretend to value him and yourself; and one of them at least may be thought to do it without affectation, namely Mrs. Howard.</P>
<P>Pray consult with Dr. Arbuthnot and Dr. Chene, to what exact pitch your belly may be suffer'd to swell, not to outgrow theirs, who are, yet, your betters. Tell Dr. Arbuthnot

that even pigeon-pyes and hogs-puddings are thought dangerous by our governors; for those that have been sent to the Bishop of Rochester are open'd and prophanely pry'd into at the Tower: 'Tis the first time dead pigeons have been suspected of carrying intelligence. To be serious, you and Mr. Congreve and the Doctor will be sensible of my concern and surprize at his commitment, whose welfare is as much my concern as any friend's I have. I think myself a most unfortunate wretch: I no sooner love, and, upon knowledge, fix my esteem to any man; but he either dies, like Mr. Craggs, or is sent to im∣prisonment like the Bishop. God send him as well as I wish him, manifest him to be as inno∣cent as I believe him, and make all his enemies know him as well as I do, that they may think of him as well!</P>

had I not been deceived (a way one often is deceived) by hearkening to women; who told me that both Lady Burlington and your∣self were immediately to return from Tun∣bridge, and that my Lord was gone to bring you back. The world furnishes us with too many examples of what you complain of in yours, and, I assure you, none of them touch and grieve me so much as what re∣lates to you. I think your sentiments upon it are the very same I should entertain: I wish those we call great men had the same notions, but they are really the most little creatures in the world; and the most interested, in all but one point; which is, that they want judgment <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Instead of—<HI>that they want judgment,</HI> propriety of expression requires he should have said—<HI>there where they want judgment</HI>—</NOTE>to know their greatest interest, to encourage and chuse honest men for their friends.</P>

I am always glad to hear of, and from you; always glad to see you, whatever accidents or amusements have interven'd to make me do either less than usual. I not on∣ly frequently think of you, but constantly do my best to make others do it, by mentioning you to all your acquaintance. I desire you to do the same for me to those you are now with: do me what you think justice in regard to those who are my friends, and if there are any, whom I have unwillingly deserved so little of as to be my enemies, I don't desire you to forfeit their opinion, or your own judgment in any case. Let time convince those who know me not, that I am an inoffensive person; tho' (to say truth) I don't care how little I am indebted to Time, for the world is hardly worth living in, at least to one that is never to have health a week together. I have been made to expect Dr. Ar∣buthnot in town this fortnight, or else I had written to him. If he, by never writing to me, seems to forget me, I consider I do the same seemingly to him, and yet I don't believe he has a more sincere friend in the world than I am: therefore I will think him mine.

<P>I Faithfully assure you, in the midst of that melancholy with which I have been so long encompassed, in an hourly expectation almost of my Mother's death; there was no circum∣stance that render'd it more insupportable to me, than that I could not leave her to see you. Your own present escape from so imminent danger, I pray God may prove less precarious than my poor Mother's can be; whose life at best can be but a short reprieve, or a longer dying. But I fear, even that is more than God will please to grant me; for, these two days past, her most dangerous symptoms are returned upon her; and, unless there be a sudden change, I must in a few days, if not in a few hours, be depriv'd of her. In the afflicting prospect before me, I know nothing that can so much alleviate it as the view now given me (Heaven grant it may encrease!) of your recovery. In the sincerity of my Heart, I am excessively concern'd, not to be able to pay you, dear Gay, any part of the debt, I very gratefully remember, I owe you on a like sad occasion, when you was here comfort∣ing me in her last great Illness. May your health augment as fast as, I fear, hers must decline: I believe that would be very fast—may the Life
<PB N="163" REF="177"/>
that is added to you be past in good fortune and tranquillity, rather of your own giving to yourself, than from any expectations or trust in others. May you and I live together, without wishing more felicity or acquisitions than Friendship can give and receive without obli∣gations to Greatness.

I have now past five weeks without once going from home, and without any company but for three or four of the days. Friends rarely stretch their kindness so far as ten miles.

Princes indeed, and Peers (the lackies of Princes) and Ladies (the fools of Peers) will smile on you the less; but men of worth, and real friends will look on you the better. There is a thing, the only thing which Kings and Queens cannot give you (for they have it not to give) Liberty, and which is worth all they have; which, as yet, I thank God, Englishmen need not ask from their hands. You will enjoy that, and your own integrity, and the satisfactory consciousness of having <HI>not</HI> merited such graces from courts as are bestow'd only on the mean, servile, flat∣tering, interested, and undeserving. The only steps to the favour of the Great are such com∣placencies, such compliances, such distant de∣corums, as delude them in their vanities, or engage them in their passions. He is their greatest favourite, who is the falsest: and when a man, by such vile gradations, arrives at the height of grandeur and power, he is then at best but in a circumstance to be hated, and in a condition to be hanged, for serving their ends: So many a Minister has found it!</P>

I have not given up my pretensions to the Dean; if it was to be parted with, I wish one of us had it; I hope you wish so too, and that Mrs. Blount and Mrs. Howard wish the same, and for the very same reason that I wish it. All I could hear of you of late hath been by advertise∣ments in news-papers, by which one would think the race of Curls was multiplied; and, by the indignation such fellows show against you, that you have more merit than any body alive could have. Homer himself hath not been worse us'd by the French. I am to tell you that the Duchess makes you her compliments, and is always inclin'd to like any thing you do; that Mr. Congreve admires, with me, your for∣titude: and loves, not envies your performance, for we are not Dunces.</P>

<P>IF my friendship were as effectual as it is sincere, you would be one of those people who would be vastly advantaged and enrich'd by it. I ever honour'd those Popes who were most famous for Nepotism, 'tis a sign that the old fellows loved Somebody, which is not usual in such advanced years. And I now honour Sir Robert Walpole for his extensive bounty and goodness to his private friends and relations. But it vexes me to the heart when I reflect, that my friendship is so much less effectual than theirs; nay so utterly useless that it cannot give you any thing, not even a dinner at this di∣stance, nor help the General whom I greatly love, to catch one fish. My only consolation is to think you happier than myself, and to be∣gin to envy you, which is next to hating you (an excellent remedy for love.) How comes it that Providence has been so unkind to me (who am a greater object of compassion than any fat man alive) that I am forced to drink wine, while you riot in water, prepar'd with oranges by the hand of the Duchess of Queensberry? that I am condemn'd to live by a high-way side, like an old Patriarch, receiving all guests, where my portico (as Virgil has it)

while you are wrapt into the Idalian Groves, sprinkled with rose-water, and live in burrage, balm, and burnet up to the chin, with the Du∣chess of Queensberry? that I am doom'd to the drudgery of dining at court with the ladies in waiting at Windsor, while you are happily ba∣nish'd with the Duchess of Queensberry? So partial is fortune in her dispensations! for I de∣served ten times more to be banish'd than you, and I know some Ladies who merit it better than even her Grace. After this I must not name any, who dare do so much for you as to send you their services. But one there is, who exhorts me often to write to you, I suppose, to prevent or excuse her not doing it herself; she seems (for that is all I'll say for a courtier) to wish you mighty well. Another, who is no cour∣tier, frequently mentions you, and does certain∣ly wish you well—I fancy, after all, they both do so.</P>
<P>I writ to Mr. Fortescue and told him the pains you took to see him. The Dean is well; I have had many accounts of him from Irish evidence, but only two letters these four months, in both which you are mentioned kindly: he is in the north of Ireland, doing I know not what, with I know not whom. Mr. Cleland

<P>I May with great truth return your speech, that I think of you daily; oftener indeed than is consistent with the character of a rea∣sonable man, who is rather to make himself easy with the things and men that are about him, than uneasy for those which he wants. And you, whose absence is in a manner perpe∣tual to me, ought rather to be remembred as a good man gone, than breathed after as one liv∣ing. You are taken from us here, to be laid up in a more blessed state with spirits of a higher kind: such I reckon his Grace and her

I can't but look upon myself (so unworthy as a man of Twitnam seems, to be rank'd with such rectify'd and sublimated beings as you) as a separated spirit too from Courts and courtly fopperies. But, I own, not altogether so divest∣ed of terrene matter, nor altogether so spiritual∣ized, as to be worthy admission to your depths of retirement and contentment. I am tugg'd back to the world and its regards too often; and no wonder, when my retreat is but ten miles from the capital. I am within ear-shot of re∣ports, within the vortex of lies and censures. I hear sometimes of the lampooners of beauty, the calumniators of virtue, the jokers at reason and religion. I presume these are creatures and things as unknown to you, as we of this dirty orb are to the inhabitants of the planet Jupi∣ter; except a few fervent prayers reach you on the wings of the post, from two or three of your zealous votaries at this distance; as one Mrs. H. who lifts up her heart now and then to you, from the midst of the Colluvies and sink of human greatness at W—r; one Mrs. B. that fancies you may remember her while you liv'd in your mortal and too transitory state

<P>I Am something like the sun at this season, withdrawing from the world, but meaning it mighty well, and resolving to shine whenever I can again. But I fear the clouds of a long winter will overcome me to such a degree, that any body will take a farthing candle for a bet∣ter guide, and more serviceable companion. My friends may remember my brighter days, but will think (like the Irishman) that the
<PB N="179" REF="195"/>
moon is a better thing when once I am gone. I don't say this with any allusion to my poetical capacity as a son of Apollo, but in my compa∣nionable one (if you'll suffer me to use a phrase of the Earl of Clarendon's) for I shall see or be seen of few of you this winter. I am grown too faint to do any good, or to give any plea∣sure. I not only, as Dryden finely says, feel my notes decay as a poet, but feel my spirits flag as a companion, and shall return again to where I first began, my books. I have been putting my library in order, and enlarging the chimney in it, with equal intention to warm my mind and body (if I can) to some life. A friend (a woman-friend, God help me!) with whom I have spent three or four hours a day these fifteen years, advised me to pass more time in my studies: I reflected, she must have found some reason for this admonition, and conclud∣ed she would complete all her kindnesses to me by returning me to the employment I am fit∣test for; conversation with the dead, the old, and the worm-eaten.</P>
<P>Judge therefore if I might not treat you as a beatify'd spirit, comparing your life with my stupid state. For as to my living at Windsor with the ladies, &amp;c. it is all a dream; I was there but two nights, and all the day out of that company. I shall certainly make as little court
<PB N="180" REF="196"/>
to others as they do to me; and that will be none at all. My Fair-weather friends of the summer are going away for London, and I shall see them and the butterflies together, if I live till next year; which I would not desire to do, if it were only for their sakes. But we that are writers, ought to love posterity, that posterity may love us; and I would willingly live to see the children of the present race, merely in hope they may be a little wiser than their Parents.</P>

<P>IT is true that I write to you very seldom, and have no pretence of writing which satis∣fies me, because I have nothing to say that can give you much pleasure: only merely that I am in being, which in truth is of little conse∣quence to one from whose conversation I am cut off by such accidents or engagements as sepa∣rate us. I continue, and ever shall, to wish you all good and happiness: I wish that some lucky event might set you in a state of ease and independency all at once! and that I might live to see you as happy, as this silly world and for∣tune can make any one. Are we never to live together more, as once we did? I find my life
<PB N="181" REF="197"/>
ebbing apace, and my affections strengthening as my age encreases; not that I am worse, but better, in my health than last winter; but my mind finds no amendment nor improvement, nor support to lean upon, from those about me: and so I feel myself leaving the world, as fast as it leaves me. Companions I have enough, friends few, and those too warm in the con∣cerns of the world, for me to bear pace with; or else so divided from me, that they are but like the dead whose remembrance I hold in ho∣nour. Nature, temper, and habit from my youth made me have but one strong desire; all other ambitions, my person, education, consti∣tution, religion, &amp;c. conspired to remove far from me. That desire was, to fix and preserve a few lasting, dependable friendships: and the accidents which have disappointed me in it, have put a period to all my aims. So I am sunk into an idleness, which makes me neither care nor labour to be noticed by the rest of man∣kind; I propose no rewards to myself, and why should I take any sort of pains? here I sit and sleep, and probably here I shall sleep till I sleep for ever, like the old man of Verona. I hear of what passes in the busy world with so little at∣tention, that I forget it the next day: and as to the learned world, there is nothing passes in it. I

<P>YOur letter is a very kind one, but I can't say so pleasing to me as many of yours have been, thro' the account you give of the dejec∣tion of your spirits. I wish the too constant use of water does not contribute to it; I find Dr. Arbuthnot and another very knowing physician of that opinion. I also wish you were not so totally immers'd in the country; I hope your return to Town will be a prevalent remedy against the evil of too much recollection. I wish it partly for my own sake. We have lived little together of late, and we want to be physicians for one another. It is a re∣medy that agreed very well with us both, for many years, and I fancy our constitutions would mend upon the old medicine of <HI>Studiorum simi∣litudo,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>This is all the news talk'd of at court, but it will please you better to hear that Mrs. Howard talks of you, tho' not in the same breath with the Thresher, as they do of me. By the way, have you seen or convers'd with Mr. Chubb, who is a wonderful Phaenomenon of Wiltshire?

<P>SIR Clem. Cottrel tells me you will shortly come to town. We begin to want com∣fort in a few friends about us, while the winds whistle, and the waters roar. The sun gives us a parting look, but 'tis but a cold one; we are ready to change those distant favours of a lofty beauty, for a gross material fire that warms and comforts more. I wish you could be here till your family come to town: you'll live more innocently, and kill fewer harmless creatures, nay none, except by your proper deputy, the butcher. It is fit for conscience sake, that you should come to town, and that the Duchess should stay in the country, where no innocents of another species may suffer by her. I hope she never goes to church: the Duke should lock you both up, and less harm would be done. I advise you to make man your game, hunt and beat about here for coxcombs, and truss up Rogues in Satire: I fancy they'll turn to a good account, if you can produce them fresh, or make them keep: and their relations will come, and buy their bodies of you.</P>

<P>I Am at last return'd from my Somersetshire expedition, but since my return I cannot so much boast of my health as before I went, for I am frequently out of order with my colical complaints, so as to make me uneasy and dispi∣rited, tho' not to any violent degree. The re∣ception we met with, and the little excursions we made were every way agreeable. I think the country abounds with beautiful prospects. Sir William Wyndham is at present amusing himself with some real improvements, and a great many visionary castles. We were often entertain'd with sea views and sea fish, and were at some places in the neighbourhood, among which, I was mightily pleased with Dunster-Castle near Minehead. It stands upon a great eminence, and hath a prospect of that town, with an extensive view of the Bristol Channel, in which are seen two small Islands call'd the Steep Holms and Flat Holms, and on t'other side we could plainly distinguish the di∣visions of fields on the Welsh coast. All this journey I perform'd on horseback, and I am

very much disappointed that at present I feel myself so little the better for it. I have indeed followed riding and exercise for three months successively, and really think I was as well with∣out it; so that I begin to fear the illness I have so long and so often complain'd of, is inherent in my constitution, and that I have nothing for it but patience <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gay died the No∣vember following at the Duke of Queensberry's house in London, aged 46 years. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>

<P>I Am astonish'd at the complaints occasion'd by a late Epistle to the Earl of Burlington; and I should be afflicted were there the least just ground for them. Had the writer attack'd Vice, at a time when it is not only tolerated but triumphant, and so far from being conceal'd as a Defect, that it is proclaimed with ostentation as a Merit; I should have been apprehensive of the consequence: Had he satirized Gamesters of a hundred thousand pounds fortune, acquir'd by such methods as are in daily practice, and almost universally encouraged: had he over∣warmly defended the Religion of his country, against such books as come from every press, are publickly vended in every shop, and greedi∣ly bought by almost every rank of men; or had he called our excellent weekly writers by the same names which they openly bestow on the greatest men in the Ministry, and out of the Ministry, for which they are all unpunished, and most rewarded: In any of these cases, in∣deed,
<PB N="190" REF="206"/>
deed, I might have judged him too presumptu∣ous, and perhaps have trembled for his rash∣ness.</P>
<P>I could not but hope better for this small and modest Epistle, which attacks no one Vice whatsoever; which deals only in Folly, and not Folly in general, but a single species of it; that only branch, for the opposite excellency to which, the Noble Lord to whom it is written must necessarily be celebrated. I fancied it might escape censure, especially seeing how ten∣derly these Follies are treated, and really less ac∣cused than apologized for.
<Q><L>Yet hence the Poor are cloath'd, the Hungry fed,</L>
<L>Health to himself, and to his Infants Bread</L>
<L>The Lab'rer bears.</L></Q>
Is this such a crime, that to impute it to a man must be a grievous offence? 'Tis an innocent Folly, and much more beneficent than the want of it; for ill Taste employs more hands, and diffuses expence more than a good one. Is it a moral defect? No, it is but a natural one; a want of taste. It is what the best good man living may be liable to. The worthiest Peer may live exemplarily in an ill-favour'd house, and the best reputed citizen be pleased with a vile garden. I thought (I say) the author had the common liberty to observe a defect, and to
<PB N="191" REF="207"/>
compliment a friend for a quality that distin∣guishes him: which I know not how any qua∣lity should do, if we were not to remark that it was wanting in others.</P>
<P>But, they say, the satire is personal. I thought it could not be so, because all its reflections are on things. His reflections are not on the man, but his house, garden, &amp;c. Nay, he respects (as one may say) the Persons of the Gladiator, the Nile, and the Triton: he is only sorry to see them (as he might be to see any of his friends) ridiculous by being in the wrong place, and in bad company. Some fancy, that to say, a thing is Personal, is the same as to say, it is Injust, not considering, that nothing can be Just that is not personal. I am afraid that <Q>“all such writings and discourses as touch no man, will mend no man.”</Q> The good-natured, indeed, are apt to be alarmed at any thing like satire; and the guilty readily concur with the weak for a plain reason, because the vicious look upon fol∣ly as their srontier:
<Q><L>Jam proximus ardet</L>
<L>Ucalegon.</L></Q>
No wonder those who know ridicule belongs to them, find an inward consolation in removing it from themselves as far as they can; and it is never so far, as when they can get it fixed on the best cha∣racters.
<PB N="192" REF="208"/>
No wonder those who are Food for Sa∣tirists should rail at them as creatures of prey; every beast born for our use would be ready to call a man so.</P>
<P>I know no remedy, unless people in our age would as little frequent the theatres, as they begin to do the churches; unless comedy were forsaken, satire silent, and every man left to do what seems good in his own eyes, as if there were no King, no Priest, no Poet, in Israel.</P>
<P>But I find myself obliged to touch a point, on which I must be more serious; it well de∣serves I should: I mean the malicious applica∣tion of the character of Timon, which, I will boldly say, they would impute to the person the most different in the world from a Man∣hater, to the person whose taste and encourage∣ment of wit have often been shewn in the rightest place. The author of that epistle must certainly think so, if he has the same opinion of his own merit as authors generally have; for he has been distinguished by this very person.</P>
<P>Why, in God's name, must a Portrait, ap∣parently collected from twenty different men, be applied to one only? Has it his eye? no, it is very unlike. Has it his nose or mouth? no, they are totally differing. What then, I beseech you? Why, it has the mole on his chin. Very
<PB N="193" REF="209"/>
well; but must the picture therefore be his, and has no other man that blemish?</P>
<P>Could there be a more melancholy instance how much the taste of the public is vitiated, and turns the most salutary and seasonable phy∣sic into poison, than if amidst the blaze of a thousand bright qualities in a great man, they should only remark there is a shadow about him; as what eminence is without? I am con∣fident the author was incapable of imputing any such to one, whose whole life (to use his own expression in print of him) is a <HI>continued series</HI> of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>generous actions.</HI></P>
<P>I know no man who would be more con∣cerned, if he gave the least pain or offence to any innocent person; and none who would be less concerned, if the satire were challenged by any one at whom he would really aim it. If ever that happens, I dare engage, he will own it, with all the freedom of one whose censures are just, and who sets his name to them.</P>

<P>THE clamour rais'd about my Epistle to you, could not give me so much pain, as I receiv'd pleasure in seeing the general zeal of the world in the cause of a Great man who is beneficent, and the particular warmth of your Lordship in that of a private man who is inno∣cent.</P>
<P>It was not the Poem that deserv'd this from you; for as I had the honour to be your Friend, I could not treat you quite like a Poet: but sure the writer deserv'd more candor, even from those who knew him not, than to promote a re∣port, which in regard to that noble person, was impertinent; in regard to me, villainous. Yet I had no great cause to wonder, that a charac∣ter belonging to twenty should be applied to one; since, by that means, nineteen would es∣cape the ridicule.</P>
<P>I was too well content with my knowledge of that noble person's opinion in this affair, to trouble the public about it. But since Malice and Mistake are so long a dying, I have taken the opportunity of a third edition to declare his

This way of Satire is dangerous, as long as slander rais'd by fools of the lowest rank, can find any countenance from those of a higher.

<P>IT is a true saying, that misfortunes alone prove one's friendships; they show us not only that of other people for us, but our own for them. We hardly know ourselves any otherwise.

I set out with a heavy heart, wishing I had done this thing the last season; for every day I defer it, the more I am in danger of that ac∣cident which I dread the most, my Mother's death (especially should it happen while I am away.) And another Reflection pains me, that I have never, since I knew you, been so long se∣parated from you, as I now must be. Me∣thinks we live to be more and more strangers, and every year teaches you to live without me:
<PB N="197" REF="213"/>
This absence may, I fear, make my return less welcome and less wanted to you, than once it seem'd, even after but a fortnight. Time ought not in reason to diminish friendship, when it confirms the truth of it by experience.</P>
<P>The journey has a good deal disorder'd me, notwithstanding my resting place at Lord Ba∣thurst's. My Lord is too much for me, he walks, and is in spirits all day long; I rejoice to see him so. It is a right distinction, that I am happier in seeing my friends so many de∣grees above me, be it in fortune, health, or pleasures, than I can be in sharing either with them: for in these sort of enjoyments I cannot keep pace with them, any more than I can walk with a stronger man. I wonder to find I am a companion for none but old men, and forget that I am not a young fellow myself. The worst is, that reading and writing, which I have still the greatest relish for, are growing painful to my eyes. But if I can preserve the good opi∣nion of one or two friends, to such a degree, as to have their indulgence to my weaknesses, I will not complain of life: And if I could live to see you consult your ease and quiet, by becoming independent on those who will never help you to either, I doubt not of finding the latter part of my life pleasanter than the former, or present. My uneasinesses of body I can bear;
<PB N="198" REF="214"/>
my chief uneasiness of mind is in your regard. You have a temper that would make you <HI>easy</HI> and <HI>beloved</HI> (which is all the happiness one needs to wish in this world) and content with moderate things. All your point is not to lose that tem∣per by sacrificing yourself to others, out of a mistaken tenderness, which hurts you, and pro∣fits not them. And this you must do soon, or it will be too late: Habit will make it as hard for you to live independent, as for L—to live out of a Court.</P>
<P>You must excuse me for observing what I think any defect in you: You grow too indo∣lent, and give things up too easily: which would be otherwise, when you found and felt yourself your own: Spirits would come in, as ill-usage went out. While you live under a kind of perpetual dejection and oppression, no∣thing at all belongs to you, not your own <HI>Hu∣mour,</HI> nor your own <HI>Sense.</HI></P>
<P>You can't conceive how much you would find resolution rise, and chearfulness grow upon you, if you'd once try to live independent for two or three months. I never think tenderly of you but this comes across me, and therefore ex∣cuse my repeating it, for whenever I do not, I dissemble half that I think of you: Adieu, pray write, and be particular about your health.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVIII <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">To the same.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter dated at nine a clock on Tuesday (night, as I suppose) has sunk me quite. Yesterday I hoped; and yesterday I sent you a line or two for our poor Friend Gay, inclos'd in a few words to you; about twelve or one a clock you should have had it. I am troubled about that, tho' the present cause of our trouble be so much greater <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gay's death, which happen'd in Nov. 1732, at the Duke of Queensberry's house in London, aged 46. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. Indeed I want a friend, to help me to bear it better. We want each other. I bear a hearty share with Mrs. Howard, who has lost a man of a most honest heart; so honest an one, that I wish her Master had none less honest about him. The world after all is a little pitiful thing; not performing any one promise it makes us, for the future, and every day taking away and annulling the joys of the past. Let us comfort one another, and, if possible, study to add as much more friendship to each other, as death has deprived us of in him: I promise you more and more of mine, which will be the way to deserve more and more of yours.</P>
<P>I purposely avoid saying more. The subject is beyond writing upon, beyond cure or ease by
<PB N="200" REF="216"/>
reason or reflection, beyond all but one thought, that it is the will of God.</P>
<P>So will the death of my Mother be! which now I tremble at, now resign to, now bring close to me, now set farther off: Every day al∣ters, turns me about, and confuses my whole frame of mind. Her dangerous distemper is again return'd, her fever coming onward again, tho' less in pain; for which last however I thank God.</P>
<P>I am unfeignedly tired of the world, and re∣ceive nothing to be call'd a Pleasure in it, equi∣valent to countervail either the death of one I have so long lived with, or of one I have so long lived for. I have nothing left but to turn my thoughts to one comfort; the last we usually think of, tho' the only one we should in wis∣dom depend upon, in such a disappointing place as this. I sit in her room, and she is always present before me, but when I sleep. I won∣der I am so well: I have shed many tears, but now I weep at nothing. I would above all things see you, and think it would comfort you to see me so equal-temper'd and so quiet. But pray dine here; you may, and she know no∣thing of it, for she dozes much, and we tell her of no earthly thing, lest it run in her mind, which often trifles have done. If Mr. Bethel had time, I wish he were your companion
<PB N="201" REF="217"/>
hither. Be as much as you can with each other: Be assur'd I love you both, and be far∣ther assur'd, that friendship will encrease as I live on.</P>

<P>I Assure you unfeignedly any memorial of your good-nature and friendliness is most welcome to me, who know those tenders of affection from you are not like the common traffic of compliments and professions, which most peo∣ple only give that they may receive; and is at best a commerce of Vanity, if not of False∣hood. I am happy in not immediately want∣ing the sort of good offices you offer: but if I did want them, I should not think myself un∣happy in receiving them at your hands: this really is some compliment, for I would rather most men did me small injury, than a kind∣ness. I know your humanity, and, allow me to say, I love and value you for it: 'Tis a much better ground of love and value, than all the qua∣lities I see the world so fond of: They gene∣rally admire in the wrong place, and generally most admire the things they don't comprehend,
<PB N="202" REF="218"/>
or the things they can never be the better for. Very few can receive pleasure or advantage from wit which they seldom taste, or learning which they seldom understand: much less from the quality, high birth, or shining cir∣cumstances of those to whom they profess es∣teem, and who will always remember how much they are their Inferiors. But Humanity and sociable virtues are what every creature wants every day, and still wants more the long∣er he lives, and most the very moment he dies. It is ill travelling either in a ditch or on a terras; we should walk in the common way, where others are continually passing on the same level, to make the journey of life supportable by bear∣ing one another company in the same circum∣stances.—Let me know how I may convey over the Odysses for your amusement in your jour∣ney, that you may compare your own travels with those of Ulysses: I am sure yours are un∣dertaken upon a more disinterested, and therefore a more heroic motive. Far be the omen from you, of returning as he did, alone, without sav∣ing a friend.</P>
<P>There is lately printed a book<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wollaston's book of <HI>the Religion of Nature de∣lineated.</HI> The Queen was fond of it, and that made the reading of it, and the talking of it, fashionable.</NOTE> wherein all human virtue is reduced to one test, that of

Truth, and branch'd out in every instance of our duty to God and man. If you have not seen it, you must, and I will send it together with the Odyssey. The very women read it, and pretend to be charm'd with that beauty which they generally think the least of. They make as much ado about <HI>truth,</HI> since this book appear'd, as they did about <HI>health</HI> when Dr. Cheyne's came out; and will doubtless be as constant in the pursuit of one, as of the other.</P>

<P>I Never am unmindful of those I think so well of as yourself; their number is not so great as to confound one's memory. Nor ought you to decline writing to me, upon an imagination, that I am much employ'd by other people. For tho' my house is like the house of a Patriarch of old, standing by the highway side and re∣ceiving all travellers, nevertheless I seldom go to bed without the reflection, that one's chief business is to be really at home: and I agree with you in your opinion of company, amuse∣ments, and all the silly things which mankind
<PB N="204" REF="220"/>
would fain make pleasures of, when in truth they are labour and sorrow.</P>
<P>I condole with you on the death of your Re∣lation, the E. of C. as on the fate of a mortal man: Esteem I never had for him, but con∣cern and humanity I had: the latter was due to the infirmity of his last period, tho' the for∣mer was not due to the triumphant and vain part of his course. He certainly knew himself best at last, and knew best the little value of others, whose neglect of him, whom they so grosly follow'd and flatter'd in the former scene of his life, shew'd them as worthless as they could imagine him to be, were he all that his worst enemies believ'd of him: For my own part, I am sorry for his death, and wish he had lived long enough to see so much of the faith∣lessness of the world, as to have been above the mad ambition of governing such wretches as he must have found it to be compos'd of.</P>
<P>Tho' you could have no great value for this Great man, yet acquaintance itself, the custom of seeing the face, or entering under the roof, of one that walks along with us in the common way of the world, is enough to create a wish at least for his being above ground, and a degree of uneasiness at his removal. 'Tis the loss of an object familiar to us: I should hardly care to have an old post pull'd up, that I remem∣ber'd
<PB N="205" REF="221"/>
ever since I was a child. And add to this the reflection (in the case of such as were not the best of their Species) what their condition in another life may be, it is yet a more import∣ant motive for our concern and compassion. To say the truth, either in the case of death or life, almost every body and every thing is a cause or object for humanity, even prosperity itself, and health itself; so many weak pitiful incidentals attend on them.</P>
<P>I am sorry any relation of yours is ill, who∣ever it be, for you don't name the person. But I conclude it is one of those to whose houses, you tell me, you are going, for I know no invi∣tation with you is so strong as when any one is in distress, or in want of your assistance: The strongest proof in the world of this, was your attendance on the late Earl.</P>
<P>I have been very melancholy for the loss of Mr. Blount. Whoever has any portion of good nature will suffer on these occasions; but a good mind rewards its own sufferings. I hope to trouble you as little as possible, if it be my fate to go before you. I am of old Ennius's mind, <HI>Nemo me decoret lachrymis</HI>—I am but a <HI>Lodger</HI> here: this is not an abiding city, I am only to stay out my lease: for what has Perpe∣tuity and mortal man to do with each other? But I could be glad you would take up with an
<PB N="206" REF="222"/>
Inn at Twitenham, as long as I am Host of it: if not, I would take up freely with any Inn of yours.—Adieu, dear Sir: Let us while away this life: and (if we can) meet in another.</P>

<P>YOU are too humane and considerate, (things few people can be charged with.) Do not say you will not expect letters from me; upon my word I can no more forbear writing sometimes to you, than thinking of you. I know the world too well, not to value you who are an example of acting, living, and thinking, above it, and contrary to it.</P>
<P>I thank God for my Mother's unexpected recovery, tho' my hope can rise no higher than from reprieve to reprieve, the small addition of a few days to the many she has already seen. Yet so short and transitory as this light is, it is all I have to warm or shine upon me; and when it is out, there is nothing else that will live for me, or consume itself in my service. But I would have you think this is not the chief motive of my concern about her: Gratitude is a
<PB N="207" REF="223"/>
cheap virtue, one may pay it very punctually, for it costs us nothing, but our memory of the good done. And I owe her more good, than ever I can pay, or she at this age re∣ceive, if I could. I do not think the tran∣quillity of the mind ought to be disturbed for many things in this world: but those of∣fices that are necessary duties either to our friends or ourselves, will hardly prove any breach of it; and as much as they take away from our indolence and ease of body, will con∣tribute to our peace and quiet of mind by the content they give. They often afford the high∣est pleasure; and those who do not feel that, will hardly ever find another to match it, let them love themselves ever so dearly. At the same time it must be own'd, one meets with cruel disappointments in seeing so often the best endeavours ineffectual to make others happy, and very often (what is most cruel of all) thro' their own means <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Letter XXVII. from Cirencester.</NOTE>. But still, I affirm, those very disappointments of a virtuous man are greater pleasures, than the utmost gratifications and successes of a mere self-lover.</P>
<P>The great and sudden event which has just now happened <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The death of K. George the First, which happened the 11th of June, 1727.</NOTE>, puts the whole world (I mean
<PB N="208" REF="224"/>
this whole world) into a new state: The only use I have, shall, or wish to make of it, is to ob∣serve the disparity of men from themselves in a week's time: the desultory leaping and catch∣ing of new motions, new modes, new measures: and that strange spirit and life, with which men broken and disappointed resume their hopes, their sollicitations, their ambitions! It would be worth your while as a Philosopher, to be busy in these observations, and to come hither to see the fury and bustle of the Bees this hot season, without coming so near as to be stung by them.</P>

<P>AFter the publishing of my Boyish Letters to Mr. Cromwell, you will not wonder if I should forswear writing a letter again while I live; since I do not correspond with a friend upon the terms of any other free subject of this kingdom. But to you I can never be silent, or reserved; and, I am sure, my opinion of your heart is such, that I could open mine to you in no manner which I could fear the whole world
<PB N="209" REF="225"/>
should know. I could publish my own heart too, I will venture to say, for any mischief or malice there is in it: but a little too much folly or weakness might (I fear) appear, to make such a spectacle either instructive or agreeable to others.</P>
<P>I am reduced to beg of all my acquaintance to secure me from the like usage for the future, by returning me any letters of mine which they may have preserved; that I may not be hurt, after my death, by that which was the happi∣ness of my life, their partiality and affection to me.</P>
<P>I have nothing of myself to tell you, only that I have had but indifferent health. I have not made a visit to London: Curiosity and the love of Dissipation die apace in me. I am not glad nor sorry for it, but I am very sorry for those who have nothing else to live on.</P>
<P>I have read much, but writ no more. I have small hopes of doing good, no vanity in writ∣ing, and little ambition to please a world not very candid or deserving. If I can preserve the good opinion of a few friends, it is all I can expect, considering how little good I can do even to them to merit it. Few people have your candour, or are so willing to think well of another from whom they receive no benefit, and gratify no vanity. But of all the soft sen∣sations,
<PB N="210" REF="226"/>
the greatest pleasure is to give and re∣ceive mutual Trust. It is by Belief and firm Hope, that men are made happy in this life, as well as in the other. My confidence in your good opinion, and dependance upon that of one or two more, is the chief cordial drop I taste, amidst the Insipid, the Disagreeable, the Cloying, or the Dead-sweet, which are the com∣mon draughts of life. Some pleasures are too pert, as well as others too flat, to be relish'd long: and vivacity in some cases is worse than dul∣ness. Therefore indeed for many years I have not chosen my companions for any of the qua∣lities in fashion, but almost intirely for that which is the most out-of-fashion, sincerity. Be∣fore I am aware of it, I am making your pane∣gyric, and perhaps my own too, for next to possessing the best of qualities is the esteeming and distinguishing those who possess it. I truly love and value you, and so I stop short.</P>

<P>I Presume you may before this time be re∣turned, from the contemplation of many Beauties, animal and vegetable, in Gardens;
<PB N="211" REF="227"/>
and possibly some rational, in Ladies; to the better enjoyment of your own at Bevis-Mount. I hope, and believe, all you have seen will on∣ly contribute to it. I am not so fond of mak∣ing compliments to Ladies as I was twenty years ago, or I would say there are some very reasonable, and one in particular there. I think you happy, my Lord, in being at least half the year almost as much your own master as I am mine the whole year: and with all the disad∣vantageous incumbrances of quality, parts, and honour, as meer a gardener, loiterer, and la∣bourer, as he who never had Titles, or from whom they are taken. I have an eye in the last of these glorious appellations to the style of a Lord degraded or attainted: methinks they give him a better title than they deprive him of, in calling him Labourer: <HI>Agricultura,</HI> says Tully, <HI>proxima Sapientiae,</HI> which is more than can be said, by most modern Nobility, of Grace or Right Honourable, which are often <HI>proxima Stultitiae.</HI> The Great Turk, you know, is of∣ten a Gardener, or of a meaner trade: and are there not (my Lord) some circumstances in which you would resemble the Great Turk? The two Paradises are not ill connected, of Gardens and Gallantry; and some there are (not to name my Lord B.) who pretend they
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
are both to be had, even in this life, without turning Musselmen.</P>
<P>We have as little politics here within a few miles of the Court (nay perhaps at the Court) as you at Southampton; and our Ministers, I dare say, have less to do. Our weekly histo∣ries are only full of the feasts given to the Queen and Royal Family by their servants, and the long and laborious walks her majesty takes every morning. Yet if the graver Historians hereafter shall be silent of this year's events, the amorous and anecdotical may make posterity some amends, by being furnished with the gal∣lantries of the Great at home; and 'tis some comfort, that if the Men of the next age do not read of us, the Women may.</P>
<P>From the time you have been absent, I've not been to wait on a certain great man, thro' modesty, thro' idleness, and thro' respect.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From the Earl of PETERBOROW.</HEAD>
<P>I Must confess that in going to Lord Cob∣ham's, I was not led by curiosity. I went thither to see what I had seen, and what I was sure to like.</P>
<P>I had the idea of those gardens so fix'd in my imagination by many descriptions, that no∣thing surprized me; Immensity and Van Brugh appear in the whole, and in every part. Your joining in your letter animal and vegetable beau∣ty, makes me use this expression: I confess the stately Sacharissa at Stow, but am content with my little Amoret.</P>
<P>I thought you indeed more knowing upon the subject, and wonder at your mistake: why will you imagine women insensible to Praise, much less to yours? I have seen them more than once turn from their Lover to their Flat∣terer. I am sure the Farmeress at Bevis in her highest mortifications, in the middle of her Lent <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Countess of Peterborow, a Roman-catholic.</NOTE>, would feel emotions of vanity, if she knew you gave her the character of a reason∣able woman.</P>
<P>You have been guilty again of another mis∣take, which hinder'd me showing your letter to
<PB N="214" REF="230"/>
a friend; when you join two ladies in the same compliment, tho' you gave to both the beauty of Venus and the wit of Minerva, you would please neither.</P>
<P>If you had put me into the Dunciad, I could not have been more disposed to criticise your letter. What, Sir, do you bring it in as a re∣proach, or as a thing uncommon to a Court, to be without Politics? With politics indeed the Richlieu's and such folks have brought about great things in former days; but what are they, Sir, who, without policy, in our times, can make ten Treaties in a year, and secure everlasting Peace?</P>
<P>I can no longer disagree with you, tho' in jest. Oh how heartily I join with you in your contempt for Excellency and Grace, and in your Esteem of that most noble title, Loiterer. If I were a man of many plums, and a good heathen, I would dedicate a Temple to Lazi∣ness: No man sure could blame my choice of such a Deity, who considers, that, when I have been fool enough to take pains, I always met with some wise man able to undo my labours.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>YOU were in a very polemic humour when you did me the honour to answer my last. I always understood, like a true contro∣vertist, that to answer is only to cavil and quar∣rel: however, I forgive you; you did it (as all Polemics do) to shew your parts. Else was it not very vexatious, to deny me to commend two women at a time? It is true, my Lord, you know women as well as men: but since you certainly love them better, why are you so uncharitable in your opinion of them? Surely one Lady may allow another to have the thing she herself least values, Reason, when Beauty is uncontested. Venus herself could allow Mi∣nerva to be Goddess of Wit, when Paris gave her the apple (as the fool herself thought) on a better account. I do say, that Lady P* is a reasonable woman; and, I think, she will not take it amiss, if I should insist upon esteeming her, instead of Toasting her, like a silly thing I could name, who is the Venus of these days. I see you had forgot my letter, or would not let her know how much I thought of her in this reasonable way: but I have been kinder to you, and have shewn your letter to one who will take it candidly.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="232"/>
But, for God's sake, what have you said about Politicians? you made me a great compliment in the trust you reposed in my prudence, or what mischief might not I have done you with some that affect that denomination? Your Lord∣ship might as safely have spoken of Heroes. What a bluster would the God of the winds have made, had one that we know puff'd against Aeolus, or (like Xerxes) whipp'd the seas? They had dialogued it in the language of the Rehearsal,
<Q><L>I'll give him flash for flash—</L>
<L>I'll give him dash for dash—</L></Q>
But all now is safe; the Poets are preparing songs of joy, and Halcyon-days are the word.</P>
<P>I hope, my Lord, it will not be long before your dutiful affection brings you to town. I fear it will a little raise your envy to find all the Muses employed in celebrating a Royal-work <SUP>b</SUP>, which your own partiality will think inferior to Bevis-Mount. But if you have any inclina∣tion to be even with them, you need but put three or four Wits into any hole in your Gar∣den, and they will out-rhyme all Eaton and Westminster. I think, Swift, Gay, and I could undertake it, if you don't think our Heads too expensive: but the same hand that <NOTE PLACE="foot">The Hermitage.</NOTE>
<PB N="217" REF="233"/>
did the others, will do them as cheap. If all else should fail, you are sure at least of the head, hand, and heart of your servant.</P>
<P>Why should you fear any disagreeable news to reach us at Mount Bevis? Do as I do even within ten miles of London, let no news whatever come near you. As to public af∣fairs we never knew a deader season: 'tis all silent, deep tranquillity. Indeed, they say, 'tis sometimes so just before an Earthquake. But whatever happens, cannot we observe the wise neutrality of the Dutch, and let all about us fall by the ears? Or if you, my Lord, should be prick'd on by any old-fashion'd notions of Ho∣nour and Romance, and think it necessary for the General of the Marines to be in action, when our Fleets are in motion; meet them at Spithead, and take me along with you. I de∣cline no danger where the glory of Great Bri∣tain is concern'd; and will contribute to empty the largest bowl of punch that shall be rigg'd out on such an occasion. Adieu, my Lord, and may as many Years attend you, as may be hap∣py and honourable!</P>

<P>YOU must receive my letters with a just impartiality, and give grains of allowance for a gloomy or rainy day; I sink grievously with the weather-glass, and am quite spiritless when oppress'd with the thoughts of a Birth∣day or a Return.</P>
<P>Dutiful affection was bringing me to town, but undutiful laziness, and being much out of order, keep me in the country; however, if alive, I must make my appearance at the Birth∣day. Where you showed one letter you may shew the other; she that never was wanting in any good office in her power, will make a proper excuse, where a sin of Omission, I fear, is not reckoned as a venial sin.</P>
<P>I consent you shall call me polemic, or as∣sociate me to any sect or Corporation, provid∣ed you do not join me to the Charitable Rogues or to the Pacific Politicians of the present age. I have read over<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Barkley's apology for the Quakers. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> Barkley in vain, and find, af∣ter a stroke given on the left, I cannot offer the right cheek for another blow: all I can bring myself to, is to bear mortification from the Fair sex with patience.</P>

You seem to think it vexatious that I shall allow you but one woman at a time, either to praise, or love. If I dispute with you upon this point, I doubt every jury will give a verdict against me. So, Sir, with a Mahometan indul∣gence, I allow you pluralities, the favourite privilege of our church.</P>
<P>I find you do not mend upon correction; again I tell you, you must not think of women in a reasonable way: you know we always make Goddesses of those we adore upon earth; and do not all the good men tell us, we must lay aside Reason in what relates to the Deity?</P>
<P>'Tis well the Poets are preparing songs of joy: 'tis well to lay in antidotes of soft rhyme, against the rough prose they may chance to meet with at Westminster. I should have been glad of any thing of Swift's: pray, when you write to him next, tell him I expect him with impatience, in a place as odd and as much out of the way, as himself.</P>

<P>I Am under the greatest impatience to see Dr. Swift at Bevis-Mount, and must signify my mind to him by another hand, it not being per∣mitted me to hold correspondence with the said Dean, for no letter of mine can come to his hands.</P>
<P>And whereas it is apparent, in this protest∣ant land, most especially under the care of divine providence, that nothing can succeed or come to a happy issue but by Bribery; there∣fore let me know what he expects to comply with my desires, and it shall be remitted unto him.</P>
<P>For tho' I would not corrupt any man for the whole world, yet a benevolence may be given without any offence to conscience; every one must confess, that gratification and corrup∣tion are two distinct terms; nay at worst many good men hold, that for a good end, some very naughty measures may be made use of.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I must give you some good news in relation to myself, because, I know, you wish me well; I am cur'd of some diseases in my old age, which tormented me very much in my youth.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="238"/>

<P>When a Christian Priest preached against the Spirit of the Gospel, when an English Judge determined against Magna Charta, when the Minister acted against Common Sense, I used to fret.</P>
<P>Now, Sir, let what will happen, I keep my∣self in temper: As I have no flattering hopes, so I banish all useless fears; but as to the things of this world, I find myself in a condition be∣yond expectation; it being evident from a late Parliamentary inquiry, that I have as much ready money, as much in the funds, and as great a personal estate, as Sir Robert S-tt-n.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Never knew or heard of any person so vo∣latile, and so fix'd as your Lordship: You, while your imagination is carrying you through every corner of the world, where you have or have not been, can at the same time remember to do offices of favour and kindness to the mean∣est of your friends; and in all the scenes you have passed, have not been able to attain that one quality peculiar to a great man, of forget∣ting every thing but injuries. Of this I am a living witness against you; for being the most insignificant of all your old humble servants, you were so cruel as never to give me time to ask a favour, but prevented me in doing what∣ever you thought I desired, or could be for my credit or advantage.</P>
<P>I have often admired at the capriciousness of Fortune in regard to your Lordship. She hath forced Courts to act against their oldest, and most constant maxims; to make you a Gene∣ral because you had courage and conduct; an Ambassador, because you had wisdom and knowledge in the interests of Europe; and an
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
Admiral on account of your skill in maritime af∣fairs: whereas, according to the usual method of Court proceedings, I should have been at the head of the Army, and you of the Church, or rather a Curate under the Dean of St. Pa∣trick's.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of Dublin laments that he did not see your Lordship till he was just upon the point of leaving the Bath: I pray God you may have found success in that journey, else I shall continue to think there is a fatality in all your Lordship's undertakings, which only ter∣minate in your own honour, and the good of the public, without the least advantage to your health or fortune.</P>
<P>I remember Lord Oxford's Ministry us'd to tell me, that not knowing where to write to you, they were forced to write at you. It is so with me, for you are in one thing an Evan∣gelical man, that you know not where to lay your head, and, I think, you have no house. Pray, my Lord, write to me, that I may have the pleasure in this scoundrel country, of going about, and shewing my depending Parsons a let∣ter from the Earl of Peterborow.</P>

<P>I Believe you are by this time immers'd in your vast Wood; and one may address to you as to a very abstracted person, like Alex∣ander Selkirk, or the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The title of an Arabic Treatise of the Life of Hai Ebn Yocktan.</NOTE> Self-taught Philosopher. I should be very curious to know what sort of contemplations employ you. I remember the latter of those I mention'd, gave himself up to a devout exercise of making his head giddy with various circumrotations, to imitate the motions of the celestial bodies. I don't think it at all impossible that Mr. L* may be far ad∣vanced in that exercise, by frequent turns to∣wards the several aspects of the heavens, to which you may have been pleased to direct him in search of prospects and new avenues. He will be tractable in time, as birds are tamed by being whirl'd about; and doubtless come not to despise the meanest shrubs or coppice-wood, tho' naturally he seems more inclined to admire God, in his greater works, the tall timber: for, as Virgil has it, <HI>Non omnes arbusta juvant, hu∣milesque myricae.</HI> I wish myself with you both,
<PB N="226" REF="242"/>
whether you are in peace or at war, in violent argumentation of smooth consent, over Gazettes in the morning, or over Plans in the evening. In that last article, I am of opinion, your Lord∣ship has a loss of me; for generally after the de∣bate of a whole day, we acquiesced at night in the best conclusion of which human Reason seems capable in all great matters, to fall fast asleep! And so we ended, unless immediate Revelation (which ever must overcome human reason) suggested some new lights to us, by a Vision in bed. But laying aside Theory, I am told, you are going directly to Practice. Alas, what a Fall will that be? A new Building is like a new Church; when once it is set up, you must maintain it in all the forms, and with all the inconveniencies; then cease the pleasant lu∣minous days of inspiration, and there is an end of miracles at once!</P>
<P>That this Letter may be all of a piece, I'll fill the rest with an account of a consultation lately held in my neighbourhood about design∣ing a princely garden. Several Critics were of several opinions: One declar'd he would not have too much Art in it; for my notion (said he) of gardening is, that it is only sweeping Nature <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">An Expression of Sir T. H.</NOTE>: Another told them that Gravel walks were not of a good taste, for all the finest
<PB N="227" REF="243"/>
abroad were of loose sand: A third advis'd per∣emptorily there should not be one Lyme-tree in the whole plantation: A fourth made the same exclusive clause extend to Horse-chesnuts, which he affirmed not to be Trees, but Weeds: Dutch Elms were condemn'd by a fifth; and thus about half the Trees were proscribed, con∣trary to the Paradise of God's own planting, which is expressly said to be planted with <HI>all trees.</HI> There were some who could not bear Ever-greens, and call'd them Never-greens; some, who were angry at them only when cut into shapes, and gave the modern Gardeners the name of Ever-green Taylors; some, who had no dislike to Cones and Cubes, but would have them cut in Forest-trees; and some who were in a passion against any thing in shape, even against clipt-hedges, which they call'd green walls. These (my Lord) are our Men of Taste, who pretend to prove it by tasting little or nothing. Sure such a Taste is like such a stomach, not a good one, but a weak one. We have the same sort of Critics in poetry; one is fond of nothing but Heroics, another cannot relish Tragedies, another hates Pastorals, all lit∣tle Wits delight in Epigrams. Will you give me leave to add, there are the same in Divi∣nity; where many leading Critics are for root∣ing up more than they plant, and would leave
<PB N="228" REF="244"/>
the Lord's Vineyard either very thinly furnish'd, or very oddly trimm'd.</P>
<P>I have lately been with my Lord * who is a zealous, yet a charitable Planter, and has so bad a Taste, as to like all that is good. He has a disposition to wait on you in his way to the Bath, and, if he can go and return to London in eight or ten days, I am not without a hope of seeing your Lordship with the delight I al∣ways see you.

<P>I Assure you I am glad of your letter, and have long wanted nothing but the permission you now give me, to be plain and unreserved upon this head. I wrote to you concerning it long since; but a friend of yours and mine was of opinion, it was taking too much upon me, and more than I could be entitled to by the mere merit of long acquaintance, and good will. I have not a thing in my heart relating to any friend, which I would not, in my own
<PB N="229" REF="245"/>
nature, declare to all mankind. The truth is what you guess; I could not esteem your con∣duct, to an object of misery so near you as Mrs.—, and I have often hinted it to your∣self: The truth is, I cannot yet esteem it for any reason I am able to see. But this I pro∣mise, I acquit you as far as your own mind ac∣quits you. I have now no further cause of complaint, for the unhappy Lady gives me now no farther pain; she is no longer an object ei∣ther of yours or my compassion; the hardships done her, are lodg'd in the hands of God, nor has any man more to do in them, except the persons concern'd in occasioning them.</P>
<P>As for the interruption of our Correspond∣ence, I am sorry you seem to put the Test of my friendship upon that, because it is what I am disqualified from toward my other acquaint∣ance, with whom I cannot hold any frequent commerce. I'll name you the obstacles which I can't surmount: want of health, want of time, want of good eyes; and one yet stronger than them all, I write not upon the terms of other men. For however glad I might be, of express∣ing my respect, opening my mind, or venting my concerns, to my private friends; I hardly dare while there are Curlls in the world. If you please to reflect either on the impertinence of weak admirers, the malice of low enemies, the
<PB N="230" REF="246"/>
avarice of mercenary Booksellers, or the silly curiosity of people in general; you'll confess I have small reason to indulge correspondencies: in which too I want materials, as I live alto∣gether out of town, and have abstracted my mind (I hope) to better things than common news. I wish my friends would send me back those forfeitures of my discretion, commit to my justice what I trusted only to their indul∣gence, and return me at the year's end those trifling letters, which can be to them but a day's amusement, but to me may prove a dis∣credit as lasting and extensive, as the aforesaid weak admirers, mean enemies, mercenary scrib∣lers, or curious simpletons, can make it.</P>
<P>I come now to a particular you complain of, my not answering your question about some Party-papers, and their authors. This indeed I could not tell you, because I never was, or will be privy to such papers: And if by ac∣cident, thro' my acquaintance with any of the writers, I had known a thing they con∣ceal'd; I should certainly never be the Reporter of it.</P>
<P>For my waiting on you at your country∣house, I have often wish'd it; it was my com∣pliance to a superior duty that hinder'd me, and one which you are too good a Christian to
<PB N="231" REF="247"/>
wish I should have broken, having never ven∣tur'd to leave my mother (at her great age) for more than a week, which is too little for such a journey.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I must acquit myself of any act or thought, in prejudice to the regard I owe you, as so long and obliging an acquaint∣ance and correspondent. I am sure I have all the good wishes for yourself and your family, that become a friend: There is no accident that can happen to your advantage, and no action that can redound to your credit, which I should not be ready to extol, or to rejoice in. And there∣fore I beg you to be assured, I am in disposi∣tion and will, tho' not so much as I would be in testimonies or writing,</P>

<P>YOU might well think me negligent or forgetful of you, if true friendship and sin∣cere esteem were to be measured by common forms and compliments. The truth is, I could not write then, without saying something of my own condition, and of my loss of so old and so deserving a parent, which really would have troubled you; or I must have kept a silence upon that head, which would not have suited that freedom and sincere opening of the heart which is due to you from me. I am now pretty well; but my home is uneasy to me still, and I am therefore wandering about all this summer. I was but four days at Twickenham since the

occasion that made it so melancholy. I have been a fortnight in Essex, and am now at Daw∣ley (whose master is your servant) and going to Cirencester to Lord Bathurst.

<P>YOU cannot think how melancholy this place makes me; every part of this wood puts into my mind poor Mr. Gay, with whom I past once a great deal of pleasant time in it, and another friend who is near dead, and quite lost to us, Dr. Swift. I really can find no en∣joyment in the place; the same sort of unea∣siness as I find at Twit'nam, whenever I pass near my Mother's room.</P>
<P>I've not yet writ to Mrs. *. I think I should, but have nothing to say that will answer the character they consider me in, as a Wit; be∣sides, my eyes grow very bad (whatever is the cause of it) I'll put them out for no body but a friend; and, I protest, it brings tears into them almost to write to you, when I think of your state and mine. I long to write to Swift, but cannot. The greatest pain I know, is to say

<P>I feel the going out of life fast enough, to have little appetite left to make compliments, at best useless, and for the most part unfelt, speeches.

<P>As for you, my good friend, I think since our first acquaintance there have not been any of those little suspicions or jealousies that often affect the sincerest friendships; I am sure, not on my side. I must be so sincere as to own, that though I could not help valuing you for those Talents which the world prizes, yet they were not the foundation of my friendships; they were quite of another sort; nor shall I at present offend you by enumerating them: And I make it my Last Request, that you will continue that No∣ble Disdain and Abhorrence of Vice, which you seem naturally endued with; but still with a due regard to your own safety; and study more to reform than chastise, tho' the one can∣not be effected without the other.</P>

<P>I Thank you for your letter, which has all those genuine marks of a good mind by which I have ever distinguish'd yours, and for which I have so long loved you. Our friend∣ship has been constant; because it was ground∣ed on good principles, and therefore not only uninterrupted by any Distrust, but by any Va∣nity, much less any Interest.</P>
<P>What you recommend to me with the so∣lemnity of a Last Request, shall have its due weight with me. That disdain and indigna∣tion against Vice, is (I thank God) the only disdain and indignation I have: It is sincere, and it will be lasting one. But sure it is as impossible to have a just abhorrence of Vice, without hating the Vicious, as to bear a true love for Virtue, without loving the Good. To reform and not to chastise, I am afraid, is im∣possible; and that the best Precepts, as well as the best Laws, would prove of small use, if there were no Examples to inforce them. To
<PB N="242" REF="258"/>
attack Vices in the abstract, without touching Persons, may be safe fighting indeed, but it is fighting with Shadows. General propositions are obscure, misty, and uncertain, compar'd with plain, full, and home examples: Precepts only apply to our Reason, which in most men is but weak: Examples are pictures, and strike the Senses, nay raise the Passions, and call in those (the strongest and most general of all mo∣tives) to the aid of reformation. Every vici∣ous man makes the case his own; and that is the only way by which such men can be af∣fected, much less deterr'd. So that to chas∣tise is to reform. The only sign by which I found my writings ever did any good, or had any weight, has been that they rais'd the anger of bad men. And my greatest comfort, and encouragement to proceed, has been to see, that those who have no shame, and no fear of any thing else, have appear'd touch'd by my Satires.</P>
<P>As to your kind concern for my Safety, I can guess what occasions it at this time. Some Characters<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Character of Sporus in the Epistle to Dr. Ar∣buthnot.</NOTE> I have drawn are such, that if there be any who deserve them, 'tis evidently a ser∣vice to mankind to point those men out; yet such as, if all the world gave them, none, I think, will own they take to themselves. But
<PB N="243" REF="259"/>
if they should, those of whom all the world think in such a manner, must be men I cannot fear. Such in particular as have the meanness to do mischiefs in the dark, have seldom the cou∣rage to justify them in the face of day; the ta∣lents that make a Cheat or a Whisperer, are not the same that qualify a man for an Insulter; and as to private villainy, it is not so safe to join in an Assassination, as in a Libel Libel <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See the following Letter to a noble Lord.</NOTE>. I will consult my safety so far as I think becomes a prudent man: but not so far as to omit any thing which I think becomes an honest one. As to personal attacks beyond the law, every man is liable to them: as for danger within the law, I am not guilty enough to fear any. For the good opinion of all the world, I know, it is not to be had: for that of worthy men, I hope, I shall not forfeit it: for that of the Great, or those in power, I may wish I had it; but if thro' misrepresentations (too common about persons in that station) I have it not, I shall be sorry, but not miserable in the want of it.</P>
<P>It is certain, much freer Satirists than I, have enjoy'd the encouragement and protection of the Princes under whom they lived. Augustus and Maecenas made Horace their companion, though he had been in arms on the side of
<PB N="244" REF="260"/>
Brutus; and, allow me to remark, it was out of the suffering Party too, that they favour'd and distinguish'd Virgil. You will not suspect me of comparing myself with Virgil and Horace, nor even with another Court-favourite, Boi∣leau <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See Letter c111. to Mr. Warburton.</NOTE>. I have always been too modest to ima∣gine my Panegyrics were Incense worthy of a Court; and that, I hope, will be thought the true reason why I have never offer'd any. I would only have observ'd, that it was under the great∣est Princes and best Ministers, that moral Sa∣tirists were most encouraged; and that then Poets exercised the same jurisdiction over the Follies, as Historians did over the Vices of men. It may also be worth considering, whether Au∣gustus himself makes the greater figure, in the writings of the former, or of the latter? and whether Nero and Domitian do not appear as ridiculous for their Taste and Affectation, in Persius and Juvenal, as odious for their bad Government in Tacitus and Suetonius? In the first of these reigns it was, that Horace was pro∣tected and caress'd; and in the latter that Lu∣can was put to death, and Juvenal banish'd.</P>
<P>I would not have said so much, but to shew you my whole heart on this subject; and to con∣vince you, I am deliberately bent to perform that
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
Request which you make your last to me, and to perform it with Temper, Justice, and Reso∣lution. As your Approbation (being the testi∣mony of a sound head and an honest heart) does greatly confirm me herein, I wish you may live to see the effect it may hereafter have upon me, in something more deserving of that approbation. But if it be the Will of God, (which, I know, will also be yours) that we must separate, I hope it will be better for You than it can be for me. You are fitter to live, or to die, than any man I know.

<HEAD>The CHARACTER of KATHARINE, LATE Duchess of <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> and <HI>Normanby.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><BYLINE>By the late Mr. POPE.</BYLINE></OPENER>
<P>SHE was the daughter of James the se∣cond, and of the countess of Dorchester, who inherited the Integrity and Virtue of her father with happier fortune. She was married
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
first to James earl of Anglesey; and secondly, to John Sheffield duke of Buckinghamshire and Normanby; with the former she exercised the virtues of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Suffering,</HI> as long as there was any hopes of doing good by either; with the latter all other <HI>Conjugal virtues.</HI> The man of finest sense and sharpest discernment, she had the happiness to please; and in that, found her only pleasure. When he died, it seemed as if his spirit was only breathed into her, to fulfill what he had begun, to perform what he had concerted, and to preserve and watch over what he had left, <HI>his only son;</HI> in the care of whose Health, the forming of whose Mind, and the improvement of whose Fortune, she acted with the conduct and sense of the Father, soften'd, but not overcome, with the tenderness of the Mother. Her Understanding was such as must have made a figure, had it been in a man; but the Modesty of her sex threw a veil over its lustre, which nevertheless sup∣press'd only the expression, not the exertion of it; for her sense was not superior to her Reso∣lution, which, when once she was in the right, preserv'd her from making it only transition to the wrong, the frequent weakness even of the best women. She often followed wise counsel, but sometimes went before it, always with success. She was possessed of a spirit,
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
which assisted her to get the better of those ac∣cidents which admitted of any redress, and enabled her to support outwardly, with decency and dignity, those which admitted of none; yet melted inwardly, through almost her whole life, at a succession of melancholy and affect∣ing objects, the loss of all her Children, the misfortunes of <HI>Relations and Friends, public and private,</HI> and the death of those who were dearest to her. Her Heart was as compassion∣ate as it was great: her Affections warm even to sollicitude: her Friendship not violent or jealous, but rational and persevering: her Gra∣titude equal and constant to the living; to the dead boundless and heroical. What person so∣ever she found worthy of her esteem, she would not give up for any power on earth; and the greatest on earth whom she could not esteem, obtain'd from her no farther tribute than De∣cency. Her Good-will was wholly directed by merit, not by accident; not measured by the regard they profess'd for her own desert, but by her idea of theirs: And as there was no me∣rit which she was not able to imitate, there was none which she could envy: therefore her Conversation was as free from detraction, as her Opinions from prejudice or prepossession. As her Thoughts were her own, so were her Words; and she was as sincere in uttering her
<PB N="249" REF="265"/>
judgment, as impartial in forming it. She was a safe Companion, many were serv'd, none ever suffered by her acquaintance: inoffensive, when unprovoked; when provoked, not stupid: But the moment her enemy ceased to be hurtful, she could cease to act as an enemy. She was therefore not a bitter but consistent enemy: (tho' indeed, when forced to be so, the more a finish'd one for having been long a making.) And her proceeding with ill people was more in a calm and steddy course, like Justice, than in quick and passionate onsets, like Revenge. As for those of whom she only thought ill, she considered them not so much as once to wish them ill; of such, her Contempt was great enough to put a stop to all other passions that could hurt them. Her Love and Aversion, her Gratitude and Resentment, her Esteem and Neglect were equally open and strong, and alter∣able only from the alteration of the persons who created them. Her Mind was too noble to be insincere, and her Heart too honest to stand in need of it; so that she never found cause to re∣pent her conduct either to a friend or an ene∣my. There remains only to speak of her Per∣son, which was most amiably majestic, the nicest eye could find no fault in the outward li∣neaments of her Face or proportion of her Body; it was such, as pleas'd wherever she
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
had a desire it should; yet she never envied that of any other, which might better please in ge∣neral: In the same manner, as being content that her merits were esteemed where she de∣sired they should, she never depreciated those of any other that were esteemed or preferred elsewhere. For she aimed not at a general love or a general esteem where she was not known; it was enough to be possess'd of both wherever she was. Having lived to the age of Sixty-two years; not courting Regard, but receiving it from all who knew her; not loving Business, but discharging it fully wheresoever duty or friendship engaged her in it; not following Greatness, but not declining to pay respect, as far as was due from independency and disinter∣est; having honourably absolv'd all the parts of life, she forsook this World, where she had left no act of duty or virtue undone, for that where alone such acts are rewarded, on the 13th Day of March, 1742-3 <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><Q>“The above Character was written by Mr. Pope some years before her Grace's Death.”</Q> So the printed Edi∣tion.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>I Am always glad to hear of you, and where I can, I always enquire of you. But why have you omitted to tell me one word of your own health? The account of our Friend's<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Bethel.</NOTE> is truly melancholy, added to the circumstance of his being detained (I fear, without much hope) in a foreign country, from the comfort of see∣ing (what a good man most desires and best deserves to see to the last hour) his Friends about him. The public news<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The Victory at Dettin∣gen.</NOTE> indeed gives every Englishman a reasonable joy, and I truly feel it with you, as a national joy, not a party one; nay as a general joy to all nations where bloodshed and misery must have been intro∣duced, had the ambition and perfidy of—prevail'd.</P>
<P>I come now to answer your friend's ques∣tion. The whole of what he has heard of my writing the Character of the old<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">He says <HI>the old Duke,</HI> because he wrote a very fine Epitaph for the Son.</NOTE> Duke of Buckingham is untrue. I do not remember ever to have seen it in MS. nor have I ever
<PB N="252" REF="268"/>
seen the pedigree he mentions, otherwise than after the Duchess had printed it with the Will, and sent one to me, as, I suppose, she did to all her acquaintance. I do not wonder it should be reported I writ that Character, after a story which I will tell you in your ear, and to yourself only. There was another <HI>Cha∣racter written of her Grace</HI> by herself (with what help, I know not) but she shewed it me in her blots, and pressed me, by all the adju∣rations of Friendship, to give her my sincere opinion of it. I acted honestly and did so. She seemed to take it patiently, and, upon many ex∣ceptions which I made, engaged me to take the whole, and to select out of it just as much as I judged might stand, and return her the Copy. I did so. Immediately she picked a quarrel with me, and we never saw each other in five or six years. In the mean time, she shewed this Character (as much as was ex∣tracted of it in my hand-writing) as a compo∣sition of my own, in her praise. And very probably it is <HI>now in the hands of Lord Harvey.</HI> Dear Sir, I sincerely wish you, and your whole family (whose welfare is so closely connected) the best health and truest happiness; and am (as is also the Master of this place)</P>

<P>YOUR Lordship's<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Entitled,</HI> An Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton-Court, Aug. <HI>28, 1733, and printed the November following for J.

As I want not the humility, to think myself in every way but <HI>one</HI> your inferiour, it seems but reasonable that I should take the on∣ly method either of self-defence or retaliation,

that is left me, against a person of your quality and power. And as by your choice of this weapon, your pen, you generously (and mo∣destly too, no doubt) meant to put yourself up∣on a level with me; I will as soon believe that your Lordship would give a wound to a man unarm'd, as that you would deny me the use of it in my own defence.</P>
<P>I presume you will allow me to take the same liberty, in my answer to so <HI>candid, polite,</HI> and <HI>ingenious</HI> a Nobleman, which your Lord∣ship took in yours, to so <HI>grave, religious,</HI> and <HI>respectable</HI> a Clergyman <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Dr. S.</NOTE>: As you answered his <HI>Latin</HI> in <HI>English,</HI> permit me to answer your <HI>Verse</HI> in <HI>Prose.</HI> And tho' your Lordship's rea∣sons for not writing in <HI>Latin,</HI> might be stronger than mine for not writing in <HI>Verse,</HI> yet I may plead <HI>Two good</HI> ones, for this conduct: the one that I want the Talent of spinning <HI>a thousand lines in a</HI> Day <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>And <HI>Pope</HI> with justice of such lines may say,</L>

But no doubt it was your choice, in writing to a friend, to renounce all the pomp of Poetry, and give us this excellent mo∣del of the familiar.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="271"/>
When I consider the <HI>great difference</HI> betwixt the rank your <HI>Lordship</HI> holds in the <HI>World,</HI> and the rank which your <HI>writings</HI> are like to hold in the <HI>learned world,</HI> I presume that distinction of style is but necessary, which you will see ob∣serv'd thro' this letter. When I speak of <HI>you,</HI> my Lord, it will be with all the deference due to the inequality which Fortune has made be∣tween you and myself: but when I speak of your <HI>writings,</HI> my Lord, I must, I can do no∣thing but trifle.</P>
<P>I should be obliged indeed to lessen this <HI>Re∣spect,</HI> if all the Nobility (and especially the el∣der brothers) are but so many hereditary fools <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>That to good blood by old prescriptive rules</L>

my Lord, what an account is this you give of them? and what would have been said of me, had I immolated, in this manner, the whole body of the Nobility, at the stall of a well-fed Prebendary?</P>
<P>Were it the mere <HI>Excess</HI> of your Lordship's <HI>Wit,</HI> that carried you thus triumphantly over all the bounds of decency, I might consider your Lordship on your <HI>Pegasus,</HI> as a sprightly hunter on a mettled horse; and while you were trampling down all our works, patiently suffer the injury, in pure admiration of the <HI>Noble Sport.</HI> But should the case be quite otherwise, should your Lordship be only like a <HI>Boy</HI> that is <HI>run away with;</HI> and run away with by a <HI>Very Foal;</HI> really common charity, as well as re∣spect for a noble family, would oblige me to stop your carreer, and to <HI>help you down</HI> from <HI>this Pegasus.</HI></P>
<P>Surely the little praise of a <HI>Writer</HI> should be a thing below your ambition: You, who were no sooner born, but in the lap of the Graces; no sooner at school, but in the arms of the Muses; no sooner in the World, but you practis'd all the skill of it; no sooner in the Court, but you possess'd all the art of it! Unrivall'd as you are, in making a figure, and in making a speech, methinks, my Lord, you may well give up the poor talent of turning a Distich. And why this
<PB N="257" REF="273"/>
fondness for Poetry? Prose admits of the two excellencies you most admire, Diction and Fic∣tion: It admits of the talents you chiefly possess, a most fertile invention, and most florid expres∣sion; it is with prose, nay the plainest prose, that you best could teach our nobility to vote, which, you justly observe, is half at least of their business <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">All their bus'ness is to dress, and vote.</NOTE>: And, give me leave to prophesy, it is to your talent in prose, and not in verse, to your speaking, not your writing, to your art at court, not your art of poetry, that your Lord∣ship must owe your future figure in the world.</P>
<P>My Lord, whatever you imagine, this is the advice of a Friend, and one who remembers he formerly had the honour of some profession of Friendship from you: Whatever was his <HI>real share</HI> in it, whether small or great, yet as your Lordship could never have had the least <HI>Loss</HI> by continuing it, or the least <HI>Interest</HI> by withdraw∣ing it; the misfortune of losing it, I fear, must have been owing to his own <HI>deficiency</HI> or <HI>neglect.</HI> But as to any <HI>actual fault</HI> which deserved to forfeit it in such a degree, he protests he is to this day guiltless and ignorant. It could at most be but a fault of <HI>omission;</HI> but indeed by omissions, men of your Lordship's uncommon
<PB N="258" REF="274" MS="y"/>
merit may sometimes think themselves so in∣jur'd, as to be capable of an inclination to in∣jure another; who, tho' very much below their quality, may be above the injury.</P>
<P>I never heard of the least displeasure you had conceived against me, till I was told that an imitation I had made of<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The first Satire of the second Book, printed in 1732.</NOTE> <HI>Horace</HI> had offend∣ed some persons, and among them your Lord∣ship. I could not have apprehended that a few <HI>general strokes</HI> about a <HI>Lord scribling carelesly</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">He should have added, that he called this Nobleman, who scribled so carelesly, <HI>Lord Fanny.</HI></NOTE>, a <HI>Pimp,</HI> or a <HI>Spy</HI> at Court, a <HI>Sharper</HI> in a gild∣ed chariot, &amp;c. that these, I say, should be ever applied as they have been, by <HI>any malice</HI> but that which is the greatest in the world, <HI>the Malice of Ill people to themselves.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship so well knows (and the whole Court and town thro' your means so well know) how far the resentment was carried upon that imagination, not only in the <HI>Nature</HI> of the <HI>Li∣bel</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Verses to the Imitator of Horace,</HI> afterwards print∣ed by J. Roberts 1732. fol.</NOTE> you propagated against me, but in the ex∣traordinary <HI>manner, place,</HI> and <HI>presence</HI> in which it was propagated <NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">It was for this reason that this Letter, as soon as it was printed, was commu∣nicated to the Q.</NOTE>; that I shall only say, it
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
seem'd to me to exceed the bounds of justice, common sense, and decency.</P>
<P>I wonder yet more, how a <HI>Lady,</HI> of great wit, beauty, and fame for her poetry (between whom and your Lordship there is a <HI>natural,</HI> a <HI>just,</HI> and a <HI>well-grounded esteem)</HI> could be pre∣vail'd upon to take a part in that proceeding. Your resentments against me indeed might be equal, as my offence to you both was the same; for neither had I the least misunderstanding with that Lady, till after I was the <HI>Author</HI> of my own misfortune in discontinuing her ac∣quaintance. I may venture to own a truth, which cannot be unpleasing to either of you; I assure you my reason for so doing, was merely that you had both <HI>too much wit</HI> for me <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Once, and but once, his heedless youth was bit,</L>
<L>And lik'd that dang'rous thing a female Wit.</L></Q>
<P>See the Letter to Dr. Arbuthnot amongst the Variations.</P></NOTE>; and that I could not do, with <HI>mine,</HI> many things which you could with <HI>yours.</HI> The injury done you in withdrawing myself could be but small, if the value you had for me was no greater than you have been pleas'd since to profess. But sure∣ly, my Lord, one may say, neither the Revenge, nor the Language you held, bore any <HI>proportion</HI> to the pretended offence: The appellations of<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the aforesaid</HI> Verses to the Imitator of Horace.</NOTE> <HI>Foe</HI> to <HI>humankind,</HI> an <HI>Enemy</HI> like the <HI>Devil</HI> to

Could I be treated in terms more strong or more atrocious, if, during my acquaintance with you, I had been a <HI>Betrayer,</HI> a <HI>Backbiter,</HI> a <HI>Whis∣perer,</HI> an <HI>Eves-dropper,</HI> or an <HI>Informer?</HI> Did I in all that time ever throw <HI>a false Dye,</HI> or palm <HI>a foul Card</HI> upon you? Did I ever <HI>borrow, steal,</HI> or accept, either <HI>Money, Wit,</HI> or <HI>Advice</HI> from you? Had I ever the honour to join with ei∣ther of you in one <HI>Ballad, Satire, Pamphlet,</HI> or <HI>Epigram,</HI> on any person <HI>living</HI> or <HI>dead?</HI> Did I ever do you so great an injury as to put off <HI>my own Verses</HI> for <HI>yours,</HI> especially on <HI>those Per∣sons</HI> whom they might <HI>most offend?</HI> I am con∣fident you cannot answer in the affirmative; and I can truly affirm, that, ever since I lost the happiness of your conversation I have not pub∣lished or written, one syllable of, or to either of you; never hitch'd your <HI>names</HI> in a <HI>Verse,</HI> or trifled with your <HI>good names</HI> in <HI>company.</HI> Can I be honestly charged with any other crime but an <HI>Omission</HI> (for the word <HI>Neglect,</HI> which I us'd before, slip'd my pen unguardedly) to continue

I am persuaded you can reproach me truly with no great <HI>Faults,</HI> except my <HI>natural ones,</HI> which I am as ready to own, as to do all justice to the contrary <HI>Beauties</HI> in you. It is true, my Lord, I am short, not well shap'd, generally ill-dress'd, if not sometimes dirty: Your Lordship and Ladyship are still in bloom; your Figures such, as rival the <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Belve∣dere,</HI> and the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Medicis;</HI> and your faces so finish'd, that neither sickness nor passion can deprive them of <HI>Colour;</HI> I will allow your own in particular to be the finest that ever <HI>Man</HI> was blest with: preserve it, my Lord, and reflect, that to be a Critic, would cost it too many <HI>frowns,</HI> and to be a Statesman, too many <HI>wrinkles!</HI> I further confess, I am now some∣what old; but so your Lordship and this excel∣lent Lady, with all your beauty, will (I hope) one day be. I know your Genius and hers so perfectly <HI>tally,</HI> that you cannot but join in ad∣miring each other, and by consequence in the contempt of all such as myself. You have both, in my regard, been like—(your Lordship, I know, loves a <HI>Simile,</HI> and it will be one suitable to your <HI>Quality)</HI> you have been like <HI>Two Princes,</HI> and I like a <HI>poor Animal</HI> sacrificed be∣tween them to cement a lasting League: I hope

<P>Give me the liberty, my Lord, to tell you, why I never replied to those <HI>Verses</HI> on the <HI>Imi∣tator</HI> of <HI>Horace?</HI> They regarded nothing but my <HI>Figure,</HI> which I set no value upon; and my <HI>Morals,</HI> which, I knew, needed no defence: Any honest man has the pleasure to be consci∣ous, that it is out of the power of the <HI>Wittiest,</HI> nay the <HI>Greatest Person</HI> in the kingdom, to les∣sen him <HI>that way,</HI> but at the expence of his own <HI>Truth, Honour,</HI> or <HI>Justice.</HI></P>

This <HI>Fannius</HI> was, it seems, extremely fond both of his <HI>Poetry</HI> and his <HI>Person,</HI> which ap∣pears by the pictures and <HI>Statues</HI> he caused to be made of himself, and by his great diligence to propagate <HI>bad Verses</HI> at <HI>Court,</HI> and get them admitted into the library of <HI>Augustus.</HI> He was moreover of a delicate or <HI>effeminate complexion,</HI> and constant at the Assemblies and Opera's of those days, where he took it into his head to <HI>slander poor Horace.</HI></P>

So much for <HI>Fanny,</HI> my Lord. The word <HI>spins</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Freind</HI> or even Dr. <HI>Sherwin</HI> could assure you) was the literal translation of <HI>deduci;</HI> a me∣taphor taken from a <HI>Silk-worm,</HI> my Lord, to signify any <HI>slight, silken,</HI> or (as your Lordship and the Ladies call it)<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Weak texture of his <HI>flimzy</HI> brain. <HI>p. 6.</HI></NOTE> <HI>flimzy</HI> piece of work. I presume your Lordship has enough of this, to convince you there was nothing <HI>personal</HI> but to
<PB N="264" REF="280"/>
<HI>that Fannius,</HI> who (with all his fine accom∣plishments) had never been heard of, but for <HI>that Horace</HI> he injur'd.</P>
<P>In regard to the right honourable Lady, your Lordship's friend, I was far from designing a person of her condition by a name so derogatory to her, as that of <HI>Sappho;</HI> a name prostituted to every infamous Creature that ever wrote Verses or Novels. I protest I never <HI>apply'd</HI> that name to her in any verse of mine, <HI>public</HI> or <HI>private;</HI> and (I firmly believe) not in any <HI>Let∣ter</HI> or <HI>Conversation.</HI> Whoever could invent a Falsehood to support an accusation, I pity; and whoever can believe such a Character to be theirs, I pity still more. God forbid the Court or Town should have the complaisance to <HI>join</HI> in that opinion! Certainly I meant it on∣ly of such modern <HI>Sappho's,</HI> as imitate much more the <HI>Lewdness</HI> than the <HI>Genius</HI> of the an∣cient one; and upon whom their wretched bre∣thren frequently bestow both the <HI>Name</HI> and the <HI>Qualification</HI> there mentioned <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>From furious Sappho scarce a milder fate,</L>
<L>Pox'd by her love, or libell'd by her hate.</L>
<BIBL>1 Sat. B. ii. HOR.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>There was another reason why I was silent as to that paper—I took it for a <HI>Lady's</HI> (on the printer's word in the title page) and thought it too presuming, as well as indecent, to con∣tend
<PB N="265" REF="281"/>
with one of that <HI>Sex</HI> in <HI>altercation:</HI> For I never was so mean a creature as to commit my Anger against a <HI>Lady</HI> to <HI>paper,</HI> tho' but in a <HI>private Letter.</HI> But soon after, her denial of it was brought to me by a Noble person of <HI>real Honour</HI> and <HI>Truth.</HI> Your Lordship indeed said you had it from a Lady, and the Lady said it was your Lordship's; some thought the beau∣tiful by-blow had <HI>Two Fathers,</HI> or (if one of them will hardly be allow'd a man) <HI>Two Mo∣thers;</HI> indeed I think <HI>both Sexes</HI> had a share in it, but which was <HI>uppermost,</HI> I know not: I pretend not to determine the exact method of this <HI>Witty Fornication:</HI> and, if I call it <HI>Yours,</HI> my Lord, 'tis only because, whoever <HI>got</HI> it, you <HI>brought it forth.</HI></P>
<P>Here, my Lord, allow me to observe the different proceeding of the <HI>Ignoble poet,</HI> and his <HI>Noble Enemies.</HI> What he has written of <HI>Fanny, Adonis, Sappho,</HI> or who you will, he own'd he publish'd, he set his name to: What they have <HI>publish'd</HI> of him, they have deny'd to have <HI>writ∣ten;</HI> and what they have <HI>written</HI> of him, they have denied to have <HI>publish'd.</HI> One of these was the case in the past Libel, and the other in the present. For tho' the parent has own'd it to a few choice friends, it is such as he has been ob∣liged to deny in the most particular terms, to the great Person whose opinion <HI>concern'd him most.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="282"/>
Yet, my Lord, this Epistle was a piece not written in <HI>haste,</HI> or in a <HI>passion,</HI> but many months after all pretended provocation; when you was at <HI>full leisure</HI> at Hampton-Court, and I the ob∣ject <HI>singled,</HI> like a <HI>Deer out of Season,</HI> for so ill-timed, and ill-placed a diversion. It was a <HI>de∣liberate</HI> work, directed to a <HI>Reverend Person</HI> <NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Dr. S.</NOTE>, of the most <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>sacred</HI> character, with whom you are known to cultivate a <HI>strict correspondence,</HI> and to whom it will not be doubted, but you open your <HI>secret Sentiments,</HI> and deliver your <HI>real judgment</HI> of men and things. This, I say, my Lord, with submission, could not but awaken all my <HI>Reflection</HI> and <HI>At∣tention.</HI> Your Lordship's opinion of me as a <HI>Poet,</HI> I cannot help; it is yours, my Lord, and that were enough to mortify a poor man; but it is not yours <HI>alone,</HI> you must be content to share it with the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> and (it may be) with many <HI>more innocent</HI> and <HI>ingenious men.</HI> If your Lordship destroys my <HI>poetical</HI> character, <HI>they</HI> will claim their part in the glory; but, give me leave to say, if my <HI>mo∣ral</HI> character be ruin'd, it must be <HI>wholly</HI> the work of <HI>your Lordship;</HI> and will be hard even for you to do, unless I <HI>myself co-operate.</HI></P>
<P>How can you talk (my most worthy Lord) of all <HI>Pope's</HI> Works as so many <HI>Libels,</HI> affirm,
<PB N="267" REF="283" MS="y"/>
that <HI>he has no invention</HI> but in <HI>Defamation</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>to his eternal shame,</L>

Fye, my Lord, you forget yourself. He printed not his name before a line of the person's you mention; that person himself has told you and all the world in the book itself, what part he had in it, as may be seen at the conclusion of his notes to the Odyssey. I can only suppose your Lord∣ship (not having at that time <HI>forgot your Greek)</HI> despis'd to look upon the <HI>Translation;</HI> and ever since entertain'd too mean an Opinion of the Translator to cast an eye upon it. Besides, my Lord, when you said he <HI>sold</HI> another man's works, you ought in justice to have added that he <HI>bought</HI> them, which very much <HI>alters the Case.</HI> What he gave him was five hundred pounds: his receipt can be produced to your Lordship. I dare not affirm he was as <HI>well paid</HI> as <HI>some Writers</HI> (much his inferiors) have been since; but your Lordship will reflect that I am no man of Quality, either to <HI>buy</HI> or <HI>sell</HI> scrib∣ling so high: and that I have neither <HI>Place, Pension,</HI> nor Power to reward for <HI>secret Services.</HI> It cannot be, that one of your rank can have
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
the least <HI>Envy</HI> to such an author as I: but were that <HI>possible,</HI> it were much better gratify'd by employing <HI>not your own,</HI> but some of <HI>those low and ignoble pens</HI> to do you this <HI>mean office.</HI> I dare engage you'll have them for less than I gave Mr. Broom, if your friends have not rais'd the market: Let them drive the bargain for you, my Lord; and you may depend on seeing, every day in the week, as many (and now and then as pretty) Verses, as these of your Lordship.</P>
<P>And would it not be full as well, that my poor person should be abus'd by them, as by one of your rank and quality? Cannot <HI>Curl</HI> do the same? nay has he not done it before your Lordship, in the same <HI>kind of Language,</HI> and almost the <HI>same words?</HI> I cannot but think, the worthy and <HI>discreet Clergyman</HI> himself will a∣gree, it is <HI>improper,</HI> nay <HI>unchristian,</HI> to expose the <HI>personal</HI> defects of our brother: that both such perfect forms as yours, and such unfortu∣nate ones as mine, proceed from the hand of the same <HI>Maker;</HI> who <HI>fashioneth his Vessels</HI> as he pleaseth, and that it is not from their <HI>shape</HI> we can tell whether they are made for <HI>ho∣nour</HI> or <HI>dishonour.</HI> In a word, he would teach you Charity to your greatest enemies; of which number, my Lord, I cannot be reckon'd, since, tho' a Poet, I was never your flatterer.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="285"/>
Next, my Lord, as to the <HI>Obscurity</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Hard as thy Heart, and as thy Birth obscure.</NOTE> <HI>of my Birth</HI> (a reflection copy'd also from Mr. <HI>Curl</HI> and his brethren) I am sorry to be obliged to such a presumption as to name my <HI>Family</HI> in the same leaf with your Lordship's: but my Father had the honour in one instance to re∣semble you, for he was a <HI>younger Brother.</HI> He did not indeed think it a Happiness to bury his <HI>elder Brother,</HI> tho' he had one, who wanted some of those good qualities which <HI>yours</HI> possest. How sincerely glad could I be, to pay to that young Nobleman's memory the debt I ow'd to his friendship, whose early death depriv'd your fa∣mily of as much <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> as he left be∣hind him in any branch of it. But as to my Fa∣ther, I could assure you, my Lord, that he was no Mechanic (neither a hatter, nor, which might please your Lordship yet better, a Cobler) but in truth, of a very tolerable family: And my Mother of an ancient one, as well born and educated as that <HI>Lady,</HI> whom your Lord∣ship made choice of to be the <HI>Mother of your own Children;</HI> whose merit, beauty, and viva∣city (if transmitted to your posterity) will be a <HI>better present</HI> than even the noble blood they derive <HI>only</HI> from <HI>you.</HI> A Mother, on whom I was never oblig'd so far to reflect, as to say,
<PB N="270" REF="286"/>
she <HI>spoiled me</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>A noble Father's heir spoil'd by his Mother.</L>
<L>His Lordship's account of himself, p. 7.</L></Q></NOTE>. And a Father, who never found himself oblig'd to say of me, that he <HI>dis∣approv'd my Conduct.</HI> In a word, my Lord, I think it enough, that my Parents, such as they were, never cost me a <HI>Blush;</HI> and that their Son, such as he is, never cost them a <HI>Tear.</HI></P>
<P>I have purposely omitted to consider your Lordship's Criticisms on my <HI>Poetry.</HI> As they are exactly the same with those of the <HI>foremen∣tion'd Authors,</HI> I apprehend they would justly charge me with partiality, if I gave to <HI>you</HI> what belongs to <HI>them;</HI> or paid more distinction to the <HI>same things</HI> when they are in your mouth, than when they were in theirs. It will be shew∣ing both them and you (my Lord) a <HI>more par∣ticular respect,</HI> to observe how much they are honour'd by <HI>your Imitation of them,</HI> which in∣deed is carried thro' your whole Epistle. I have read somewhere at <HI>School</HI> (tho' I make it no <HI>Vanity</HI> to have forgot where) that <HI>Tully</HI> na∣turaliz'd a few phrases at the instance of some of his friends. Your Lordship has done more in honour of these Gentlemen; you have authoriz'd not only their <HI>Assertions,</HI> but their <HI>Style.</HI> For example, <HI>A</HI> Flow <HI>that</HI> wants skill <HI>to restrain its</HI> ardour,—<HI>a</HI> Dictionary
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
<HI>that gives us nothing at</HI> its own expence.—<HI>As luxuriant branches</HI> bear <HI>but little fruit, so Wit unprun'd</HI> is <HI>but raw fruit—While you</HI> rehearse ignorance, <HI>you still</HI> know enough <HI>to do it in Verse—Wits</HI> are <HI>but glittering</HI> igno∣rance.—The <HI>account of</HI> how <HI>we pass our time</HI>—and, <HI>The weight on Sir R.

<P>You are merry, my Lord, when you say, <HI>La∣tin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI>
<Q><L>Have quite deserted your poor <HI>John Trot-head,</HI></L>
<L>And left plain native English in their stead.</L></Q>
for (to do you justice) this is nothing less than <HI>plain English.</HI> And as for your <HI>John Trot-head,</HI> I can't conceive why you should give it that name; for by some<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See some Treatises printed in the Appendix to the Craftsman, about that time.</NOTE> papers I have seen sign'd with that name, it is certainly a head <HI>very different</HI> from your Lordship's.</P>
<P>Your Lordship seems determined to fall out with every thing you have learn'd at school: you complain next of a <HI>dull Dictionary,</HI>
<Q><PB N="272" REF="288"/>
<L>That gives us nothing at its own expence,</L>
<L>But a few modern words for ancient Sense.</L></Q>
Your Lordship is the first man that ever carried the love of Wit so far, as to expect a <HI>witty Dictionary.</HI> A Dictionary that gives us <HI>any thing but words,</HI> must not only be an <HI>expensive</HI> but a very <HI>extravagant Dictionary</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Yet we have seen many of these <HI>extravagant</HI> Dic∣tionaries, and are likely to see many more, in an age so abounding in science.</NOTE>. But what does your Lordship mean by its giving us but <HI>a few modern words</HI> for <HI>ancient Sense?</HI> If by <HI>Sense</HI> (as I suspect) you mean <HI>words (a mistake not unusual)</HI> I must do the Dictionary the jus∣tice to say, that it gives us <HI>just as many modern words as ancient ones.</HI> Indeed, my Lord, you have more need to complain of a bad Gram∣mar, than of a dull Dictionary.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Freind,</HI> I dare answer for him, never taught you to talk
<Q><L>of Sapphic, Lyric, and Iambic Odes.</L></Q>
Your Lordship might as well bid your present Tutor, your Taylor, make you a <HI>Coat, Suit of Cloaths,</HI> and <HI>Breeches;</HI> for you must have for∣got your Logic, as well as Grammar, not to know, that Sapphic and Iambic are both in∣cluded in Lyric; that being the <HI>Genus,</HI> and those the <HI>Species.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="289"/>
<Q><L>For all cannot <HI>invent</HI> who can <HI>translate,</HI></L>
<L>No more than those who <HI>cloath</HI> us, can <HI>create.</HI></L></Q>
Here your Lordship seems in labour for a mean∣ing. Is it that you would have Translations, <HI>Originals?</HI> for 'tis the common opinion, that the <HI>business</HI> of a Translator is to <HI>translate,</HI> and not to <HI>invent,</HI> and of a Taylor to <HI>cloath,</HI> and not to <HI>create.</HI> But why should you, my Lord, of all mankind, abuse a Taylor? not to say <HI>blas∣pheme</HI> him; if he can (as some think) at least go halves with God Almighty in the formation of a <HI>Beau.</HI> Might not Doctor <HI>Sherwin</HI> rebuke you for this, and bid you <HI>Remember your</HI> Crea∣tor <HI>in the days of your Youth?</HI></P>
<P>From a <HI>Taylor,</HI> your Lordship proceeds (by a beautiful gradation) to a <HI>Silkman.</HI></P>
<P><Q><L>Thus <HI>P—pe</HI> we find</L>
<L>The gaudy <HI>Hinchcliff</HI> of a beauteous mind.</L></Q>
Here too is some ambiguity. Does your Lord∣ship use <HI>Hinchcliff</HI> as a <HI>proper name?</HI> or as the Ladies say a <HI>Hinchcliff</HI> or a <HI>Colmar,</HI> for a <HI>Silk</HI> or a <HI>Fan?</HI> I will venture to affirm, no Critic can have a perfect taste of your Lordship's works, who does not understand both your <HI>Male Phrase</HI> and your <HI>Female Phrase.</HI></P>
<P>Your Lordship, to finish your Climax, ad∣vances up to a <HI>Hatter;</HI> a Mechanic, whose Employment, you inform us, is not (as was generally imagined) to <HI>cover people's heads,</HI> but
<PB N="274" REF="290"/>
to <HI>dress their brains</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>For this Mechanic's, like the Hatter's pains,</L>
<L>Are but for dressing other people's brains.</L></Q></NOTE>. A most useful Mechanic indeed! I can't help wishing to have been one, for some people's sake.—But this too may be only another <HI>Lady-Phrase:</HI> Your Lordship and the Ladies may take a <HI>Head-dress</HI> for a <HI>Head,</HI> and understand, that to <HI>adorn the Head</HI> is the same thing as to <HI>dress the Brains.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the whole, I may thank your Lord∣ship for this high Panegyric: For if I have but <HI>dress'd</HI> up <HI>Homer,</HI> as your <HI>Taylor, Silkman,</HI> and <HI>Hatter</HI> have <HI>equip'd your Lordship,</HI> I must be own'd to have dress'd him <HI>marvellously indeed,</HI> and no wonder if he is <HI>admir'd by the La∣dies</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">by Girls admir'd. <HI>p. 6.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>After all, my Lord, I really wish you would learn your <HI>Grammar.</HI> What if you put your∣self awhile under the Tuition of your Friend <HI>W—m?</HI> May not I with all respect say to you, what was said to <HI>another Noble Poet</HI> by Mr. Cowley, <HI>Pray, Mr.</HI> Howard <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Honourable Mr. Edward Howard, celebrated for his poetry.</NOTE>, <HI>if you did read your</HI> Grammar, <HI>what harm would it do you?</HI> You yourself wish all Lords would <HI>learn to write</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>And when you see me sairly write my name,</L>

<P>A strange Picture of a Man, who had the good fortune to enjoy many friends, who will be always remember'd as the first Ornaments of their Age and Country; and no Enemies that ever contriv'd to be heard of, except Mr. <HI>John Den∣nis,</HI> and your Lordship: A Man, who never wrote a Line in which the <HI>Religion</HI> or <HI>Government</HI> of his Country, the <HI>Royal Family,</HI> or their <HI>Ministry</HI> were disrespectfully mentioned; the Animosity of any one Party gratify'd at the expence of an∣other; or any Censure past, but upon <HI>known</HI>

<Q><L>That, while he breathes, no rich or noble knave</L>
<L>Shall walk the world in credit to his grave.</L></Q>
This, he thinks, is rendering the best Service he can to the Publick, and even to the good Government of his Country; and for this, at least, he may deserve some Countenance, even from the GREATEST PERSONS in it.

Their NAMES I should be as sorry, and as much asham'd, to place near <HI>yours,</HI> on such an occa∣sion, as I should be to see <HI>You,</HI> my Lord, placed so near <HI>their</HI> PERSONS, if you could ever make so ill an Use of their Ear<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Close at the ear of Eve. <BIBL>Ep. to Dr. Arbuth.</BIBL></NOTE> as to asperse or misrepresent any one innocent Man.</P>

<HEAD>An EPISTLE from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity in answer to a Latin Letter in Verse.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Suppliant your Pardon first I must im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lore,</L>
<L>(Dear Doctor) that I've never wrote before:</L>
<L>But in the constant Bustle of a Court,</L>
<L>Betwixt our Forms, our Bus'ness, and our Sport;</L>
<L>Tho' you may think whole Days are unenjoy'd,</L>
<L>Yet scarce one Moment passes unemploy'd.</L>
<L>In the next place, when I declare how long</L>
<L>I've taken leave of Greek or Latin Song;</L>
<L>That all I learn'd from Doc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><SUP>r</SUP>▪ freind at School,</L>
<L>By Gradus, Lexicon, or Grammar Rule;</L>
<L>Of Saphic, Lyric, or Jambic Odes,</L>
<L>Or Doct<SUP>r</SUP>▪ King's Machinery of Gods,</L>
<L>Has quite deserted this poor John-Trot Head,</L>
<L>And left plain native English in its stead:</L>
<L>I'm sure your courteous Rev'rence will forgive</L>
<L>The homely Way, in which you now receive</L>
<L><PB N="290" REF="306"/>
These hearty Thanks, from an illitorate Hand,</L>
<L>For Favours which I barely understand.</L>
<L>You know the Proverb says, that of a Cat,</L>
<L>The Creature's Skin is all that you can get;</L>
<L>So from no Head you ever can receive</L>
<L>More Wit than such a Head has got to give:</L>
<L>Let for this Reason then my gracious Friend</L>
<L>Gracious accept the all I have to send;</L>
<L>Nor wonder that my Brain no more affords,</L>
<L>But recollect the Privilege of Lords;</L>
<L>And when you see me fairly write my Name,</L>
<L>For England's Sake wish all could do the same.</L>
<L>Nay, I perhaps could not so much have done,</L>
<L>Had I been bred and born an eldest Son.</L>
<L>A noble Father's Heir, spoil'd by his Mother,</L>
<L>Leaves Learning always to his younger Brother;</L>
<L>Who at the Bar must prale to earn a Groat,</L>
<L>Whilst all our Bus'ness is to dress and vote.</L>
<L>The very moment therefore I grow great,</L>
<L>A lazy, titled Heir to an Estate,</L>
<L>For fear my Education might bely,</L>
<L>By some mean Badge of Sense, my Quality;</L>
<L><PB N="291" REF="307"/>
That to good Blood, by old prescriptive Rules,</L>
<L>Gives Right hereditary to be Fools;</L>
<L>I straight began upon a quite new Score,</L>
<L>Neglected all that I had learn'd before;</L>
<L>And not to seem a Novice in my State</L>
<L>Or ignorant what belong'd to being great,</L>
<L>Wish little Judgment, and good store of Pride</L>
<L>I took upon me always to decide:</L>
<L>In every Company was bold and loud,</L>
<L>Behav'd myself as rudely as I could,</L>
<L>And ne'er discours'd of what I understood.</L>
<L>'Tis thus among the Great: if any one</L>
<L>By chance has Wit, so awkardly 'tis shown</L>
<L>That tis a less Misfortune to have none.</L>
<L>For still he goes on this erroneous Rule,</L>
<L>That no Body with Wit can be a Fool;</L>
<L>Yet by Example, at his own Expence,</L>
<L>Proves one may have it without Common Sense</L>
<L>For, void of Prudence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo vain of Parts,</L>
<L>How oft good Heads have plainer shown bad Hearts?</L>
<L>When in Obscurity perhaps the last</L>
<L>Without the first, had fortunately past.</L>

Thus while to Wit their sole Ambition tends,</L>
<L>(Whilst for one Joke they give up fifty Friends)</L>
<L>Tho ne'er adapted to a manly Use,</L>
<L>But still on Triffles squander'd, or Abuse;</L>
<L>They think the World so blind as to admit,</L>
<L>All Understanding is compris'd in Wit.</L>
<L>That dang'rous Flow of a licentious Brain,</L>
<L>Which wanting Skill its Ardour to restrain,</L>
<L>Converts to ill, like Nourishment to Pain.</L>
<L>Perhaps you'll say, to its Excuse inclin'd,</L>
<L>If'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s an Ill, tis of a pleasing kind.</L>
<L>I grant it such, but still 'tis a Disease,</L>
<L>Are Calentures not Ills, because they please?</L>
<L>Or who can call the Goat, or Stone a Good,</L>
<L>Because engender'd by the richest Blood?</L>
<L>Luxuriant Branches shew a fertile Root,</L>
<L>But unrestrain'd they bear but little Fruit:</L>
<L>So Wit unprun'd, and wanting Judgment's aid,</L>
<L>Is the crude Fruit of a good useless Head.</L>
<L>Such Wits are nought but glitt'ring Ignorance:</L>
<L>What Monkeys are to Men, they are to Sense;</L>

Imperfect Mimicks, ludicrous and mean,</L>
<L>Who often bite that Fool they entertain.</L>
<L>Their Tricks may please, their Quickness may surprize;</L>
<L>At first we wonder, but at last despise.</L>
<L>The Wise avoid▪ such animals with Care,</L>
<L>And he who laughs the loudest laughs in fear.</L>
<L>True Wit is Reason in her gayest strain;</L>
<L>That can at once inform and entertain:</L>
<L>Her li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chy Truths attentive explore,</L>

<L>She <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ning at it, dissolute and loud,</L>
<L>And of the faults, they ought to blush for, proud.</L>
<L>How oft we hear some Witling pert and dull,</L>

<L>But in reality this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingler's claim,</L>
<L>Or to an Author's, or a Poets name,</L>
<L>A Judge of Writing would no more admit,</L>
<L>Than each dull Dictionary's claim to Wit;</L>
<L>That nothing gives you at its own Expence,</L>
<L>But a few modern Words for ancient Sense.</L>
<L>'Tis thus, whene'er Pope writes, he's forc'd to go</L>

<L>"For all cannot invent, who can translate;</L>
<L>No more than those who cloath, us can create.</L>
<L>When we see Celia shining in Brocade,</L>
