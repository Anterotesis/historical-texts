<P>ODES, BY RICHARD CUMBERLAND, Esq;</P>

<HEAD>TO MR. GEORGE ROMNEY.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST you was engaged in contemplating those wonderful productions of ancient art, which ITALY is enriched with, I was tracing the ruder beauties of Nature in a domestic tour thro' the mountainous parts of WESTMORELAND and CUMBERLAND: You carried out with you a disinterested passion for your art, with faculties which this country hath rarely given birth to; and you return from your travels with some specimens of so auspicious a sort, that, when en∣couragement shall provoke your genius to its full display, we are perswad∣ed you will take rank with the first masters of the highest province and best age of painting: I set out on my expedition with no other preten∣sions than a devout respect for Nature in her sublimest shapes, and some small leanings towards the Muse; not enough to make our intercourse the talk of posterity, but barely sufficient to fill up the hour. The fruit of my tour hath been, what I fear is scarce worth laying at your feet, the following Irregular Ode, which was literally struck out on the spot, and is addrest to the Sun; for as the season was far advanced towards winter, we had frequent temptations to invoke that luminary, who was
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
never very gracious to our suit, except whilst we were viewing the lake of KESWICK and its accompaniments.</P>
<P>If I should be asked why I give that to the world and you, which I really think scarce worthy the acceptance of you and the world, I have only to answer, that if the honest pride of the Friend did not draw it into public, the idle vanity of the Poet would be well content to spare the the Press its pains: but the gratification of saying how much I re∣spect your genius and esteem your virtues, finds it an easy task to o∣vercome the remonstrances of Judgement, or the terrors of criticism.</P>
<P>Mr. GRAY, whose faculty of describing can give life to scenes which I should have conceived nothing but the pencil could convey, hath left behind him a Journal, for which we are indebted to his can∣did friend and editor. This Journal refers to all the scenes hinted at in the following Ode; and being a book in every body's hands, makes it unnecessary for me to trouble the Reader with any attempts of my own by way of notes, which with the best poems seldom ac∣cord, and in my instance might have been a hazardous experiment.</P>
<P>How it came to pass, that this enchanting display of sublime and beautiful objects could extort nothing more than a prosaic description from a poetical pen, I am at a loss to guess. I have been favoured with a
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Manuscript of the late ingenious Dr. BROWNE, which I had the privi∣ledge of inserting in this publication, and should so have done, but that I found it had already got forth into the world, and was in print: It is touched with great spirit, and in a glowing stile, which gradually kindles till it breaks forth into the following rhapsody, which I believe hath hitherto escaped publication:</P>
<LG>
<L>Now sunk the Sun, now Twilight sunk, and Night</L>
<L>Rode in her zenith; nor a passing breeze</L>
<L>Sigh'd to the groves, which in the midnight air</L>
<L>Stood motionless, and in the peaceful floods</L>
<L>Inverted hung: For now the billow slept</L>
<L>Along the shore, nor heav'd the deep, but spread</L>
<L>A shining mirror to the Moon's pale orb,</L>
<L>Which, dim and waining, o'er the shadowy clifts,</L>
<L>The solemn woods and spiry mountain-tops</L>
<L>Her glimmering faintness threw: Now every eye,</L>
<L>Oppress'd with toil, was drown'd in deep repose;</L>
<L>Save that the unseen shepherd in his watch,</L>
<L>Propt on his crook, stood list'ning by the fold,</L>
<L>And gaz'd the starry vault and pendant moon;</L>
<L>Nor voice nor sound broke on the deep serene,</L>
<L>But the soft murmur of swift-gushing rills,</L>
<L>Forth-issuing from the mountain's distant steep,</L>
<L>(Unheard till now, and now scarce heard) proclaim'd</L>
<L>All things at rest, and imag'd the still voice</L>
<L>Of quiet whispering to the ear of Night.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
In fine, <HI>says Dr. BROWNE,</HI> this accumulation of beauty and immensity tends not only to excite rapture but reverence; for my part I make an annual voyage to Keswick, not only as an innocent amusement, but a reli∣gious act. I walk forth in this stupendous scene, as into the grandest earth∣ly temple of the Creator; and as I take my progress thro' its several parts, often break forth with the divine Psalmist in that grateful exclamation—<Q>“O LORD, how manifold are thy works; in wisdom hast thou made them all.”</Q></P>
<P>What I have here inserted is taken from a letter to a friend, and is a valuable specimen of the author. As for the minute delineations, which some travellers affect to give of scenes that come under their contem∣plation, they seldom convey to my apprehension any map of the place they describe. To you perhaps, whose pictures are language, language may be a picture; and as I know you can paint our very words, words may in return paint that to you, of which a less intuitive mind takes no conception; the bulk of mankind however collect little from these de∣scriptions but the amusement of reading them; and the most they can effect is to refresh the memories of them, who have been on the spot, or to inspire those, who have not been, with a resolution of going thither. And in truth a more pleasing tour than these lakes hold out to men of leisure and curiosity cannot be devised. We penetrate the <HI>Glacieres,</HI> tra∣verse the <HI>Rhone</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> whilst our own domestic lakes of <HI>Ulswa∣ter,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>Keswick</HI> and <HI>Wyndermere</HI> exhibit scenes in so sublime a stile, with such beautiful colourings of rock, wood and water, backed with so tre∣mendous a disposition of mountains, that if they do not fairly take the lead of all the views in Europe, yet they are indisputably such as no English traveller should leave behind him, provided he be one, who, with my <HI>Atticus,</HI> loves</P>
<LG>
<L>"To follow nature in her simple haunts,</L>
<L>"With early steps to climb the shaggy side</L>
<L>"Of some hoar cliff and meet the dewy breath</L>
<L>"Of morning, issuing from the flowery vale:</L>
<L>"Or soft reclining on the mossy turf</L>
<L>"Careless to lye, and, as the dimpling brook</L>
<L>"Steals gently on, with motionless regard</L>
<L>"To eye the floating mirror; while as fast</L>
<L>"Down Meditation's smooth and silent tide</L>
<L>"In easy lapse his tuneful moments fall,</L>
<L>"Clear and untroubled as the passing stream."</L>
</LG>
<P>But the views of our young travelling gentry, as you must well know, are not thus directed: on the road they are couriers; in the cities they are revellers: Whilst they are journeying there is no respite nor repose; their enquiries extend neither to right hand nor left, and seldom fur∣ther forward than to the next <HI>poste;</HI> the shortest and straightest road to dissipation and pleasure is their's, all the rest is out of the way: but if
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
their course should necessarily carry them up to any thing curious in na∣ture, if their road should compel them to the banks of a torrent, or the brow of a mountain, they are asleep, or it is dark night and they cannot see it, for they are in haste, and want to be at the next great noisy town: And now begins the plan of all their operations; here they lay in their stock of new cloathes, new taste and new opinions; in re∣turn for which they barter away all their little fund of money, modesty and religion: Here they walk thro' palaces of pictures with as much edification as a boarding-school girl would thro' the Museum, or an upholsterer thro' the Vatican. They have been told of the <HI>gusto</HI> of the <HI>antique,</HI> but where to find it, or how to distinguish it, they know no more than their mothers: <HI>Virtù</HI> however is to be purchased, like other superfluities, and in the end their <HI>Cicerone</HI> lays them in for a bargain, perhaps a patch-work head of <HI>Trajan</HI> set upon a modern pair of shoul∣ders, and made up with <HI>Caracalla</HI>'s nose and <HI>Nero</HI>'s ears,
<Q><L>Aut curios jam dimidios, humerove minorem</L>
<L>Corvinum, aut Galbam auriculis nasoque carentem.</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus equipt with these imperial reliques, with an veritable daubing of <HI>Raphaelle,</HI> copied from the very print which is given to prove its ori∣ginality, and a huge <HI>cameo</HI> on the little finger, home they come privi∣ledg'd <HI>Virtuosi,</HI> qualified to condemn every thing that their own coun∣trymen can produce; and thus having contributed all that in them lies
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
to disgrace their native land, they conclude their career by affecting to despise it. It is in vain that a native artist exhibits to their view the models of a <HI>Mars</HI> and a <HI>Venus,</HI> such as I am bold to say would have done credit to <HI>Athens</HI> in its purest age; they may <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is superfluous to say this points at Mr. <HI>Bacon;</HI> the reader of taste will be sor∣ry to know that these beautiful models have brought nothing but reputation to their maker.</NOTE>moulder in his shop for them, unless indeed they had lost a leg or an arm in the ruins of <HI>Hadri∣an</HI>'s villa, and then they would purchase them at twice the cost of the whole figures,
<Q><L>Miranturque nihil nisi quod Libitina sacravit.</L></Q></P>
<P>I should be much misunderstood if this was not thought to be said with all due exceptions; much more, if I was supposed insensible to the ge∣neral uses of travel: this would be only combating one prejudice with anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ let both be cast aside and men and things considered in their true light: There are to be found (and may their numbers multiply!) protectors of living genius, who will admit the <HI>Orpheus</HI> of <HI>Danee</HI> and the <HI>Ugolino</HI> of <HI>Reynolds</HI> into their choicest cabinets; and I trust there will be found, with whom your Graces will find an honourable station; for sure it would be a very antipatriotic prejudice to admit the vulgar drabs of the Flemish, or the theatrical dames of the Italian artist, in
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
preference to a fairer and a chaster progeny, for no better reason than because those were foreigners, and these of English parentage:</P>
<LG>
<L>Indignor quicquam reprehendi, non quia crasse</L>
<L>Compositum inlepideve putetur, sed quia nuper:</L>
<L>Nec veniam antiquis, sed honorem et praemia posci.</L>
</LG>
<P>This is a depravity of taste that does real injury to the genius of the nation, and should for that reason be combated by every <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The readiest weapon for this office is ridicule. Comedy could not be better employ∣ed than in holding up to view a character of the above description; such prejudices mi∣litate as much against antient Art and Science as against modern: I wish some of my brother dramatists, who have more leisure than I have, would accept and improve up∣on the hint.</NOTE>weapon that can serve to root out so noxious an infatuation.</P>

Press not so fast upon my aking sight</L>

<L>The mother aids the draught, and, as she aids it, prays.</L>

<LG>
<L>Soft awhile! let all be still,</L>
<L>And wait high Heav'n's disposing will▪</L>
<L>Now in each other's eyes we stare</L>
<L>With looks, that ask if Hope be there:</L>
<L>Mean while the magic drug, at strife</L>
<L>With the detested foe of life,</L>
<L>Runs to the heart, mounts to the brain,</L>
<L>And visits each corrupted vein;</L>
<L>Where'er it comes bids tumult cease,</L>
<L>And hail the messenger of peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, lengthening on the list'ning ear,</L>
<L>The soft subsiding sigh we hear;</L>
<L>His breath, a wint'ry storm before,</L>
<L>That loudly lash'd the sounding shore,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="26"/>
Now sinks into a summer breeze,</L>
<L>That gently lifts the swelling seas;</L>
<L>O'er his parch'd skin a healthful dew appears,</L>
<L>The stern distemper sheds repentant tears;</L>
<L>He smiles, he turns, he sleeps—Oh joy!-Begone, my sears!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Haste then, my Muse, tear down the oaken bough,</L>
<L>To crown the great Physician's brow;</L>
<L>See that the mystic branch is broke</L>
<L>From sage Apollo's delphic oak;</L>
<L>Then, dripping from Castalia's spring,</L>
<L>Hither the civic garland bring;</L>
<L>And as your tuneful fingers tye</L>
<L>The votive chaplet, raise on high</L>
<L>Your sounding notes; provoke again</L>
<L>A louder yet, and yet a louder strain;</L>
<L>Then to the temple of immortal Fame,</L>
<L>And on the brightest tablet stamp his living name.</L>
