<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>May it please Your</HI> Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>IFE, as SHAKESPEAR says, is like a poor Player, and a poor Play∣er is like to be a poor Life; nay, any Life, unless tolerably acted, is like to be a poor one.</P>
<P>THE World's a Stage, Life an ir∣regular Drama, our Passions are the
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>Players, our Senses the Scenes, and Reason a drowsy Part of the Audi∣ence, that cannot, or will not, mind what's performing around him.</P>
<Q><L>Life is but a Joke—and our Art at the best,</L>
<L>Is solely in making the most of the Jest.</L></Q>
<P>To help the Joke on, you greatly contribute, and I sometimes am al∣low'd to play an under Part to you.</P>
<P>LET me not rake up the Ashes of the Dead; disturb the <HI>Manes</HI> of the Great deceased, or disfurnish the Trophies of ancient Law-Givers, to make a Panegyric on your Lord Chief Justiceship. Come ye Sons of sterling Humour, <HI>Lucian, Rablais, Cervantes,</HI> and THOU, the most
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>witty, most worthy of all, immortal <HI>SWIFT,</HI> inspire me. Teach me to paint THEE and thy Court—It will not be—not one Ray of all their mighty Power will they beam on me—unhappy Rustic.</P>
<P>SUFFER me then, as Your <HI>At∣torney-General,</HI> to address You, and offer a Case to Your Lordship, which comes immediately under Your Ju∣risdiction.</P>
<P>IT is the whole Art and Mystery of HUM-BUGGING. This is a very ancient Science, and, as <HI>Maimonedes</HI> reports in the <HI>Munster</HI> MSS. was first taught by the <HI>Aegyp∣tians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hermes Trismegistus,</HI> and <HI>Zoro∣aster,</HI> were <HI>Hieroglyphical Hummers.</HI></P>
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
<P>THE first found out the <HI>Philosopher's Stone,</HI> the other invented <HI>Oracles.</HI></P>
<P>IT is very difficult to come to a right Account of those dark and fa∣bulous Ages. The first Authors of An∣tiquity to be depended upon for their Veracity, are, <HI>Herodotus, Aelian, Pliny</HI> the <HI>Naturalist,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Man∣devile.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Life of <HI>Thersites, Herodo∣tus</HI> gives us an Account of a very re∣markable <HI>Hum.</HI> It was called, <HI>The Trojan Horse;</HI> though some Authors will tell you it was a <HI>Mare;</HI> others, that it was a <HI>Cow;</HI> and that the Model of it being preserved in the <HI>Cretan Musaeum,</HI> gave <HI>Daedalus</HI> the Hint for carrying on the Intrigue for Madam <HI>Pasiphaae</HI> with <HI>Europa</HI>'s <HI>Gal∣loway.</HI></P>
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
<P><HI>ULYSSES</HI> we may set down as a tolerable <HI>Hummer; vide</HI> the Re∣ports, Cases, and Tryals, of <HI>Rhesus, Achilles, Palamedes, Philoctetes, Ajax, Circe, Calipso,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>LADY <HI>Penelope,</HI> his Spouse, was not a Jot behind Hand with him. She carried on a good Sort of a <HI>Joke</HI> on her Side the Water. Ah, my LORD, that undoing at <HI>Night</HI> what has been done in the <HI>Day,</HI> is too of∣ten the Case at present with most of the Male and Female Descendants from <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>HER Web is a good Emblem of the Morning Resolves of Sobriety, and the Evening Temptations to break them.</P>
<PB N="viii" REF="8"/>
<P>IN vain may we reason dispassi∣onately, declare for Abstinence and good Hours. It is all but a Web. At Night, Claret and good Company unravel all our Resolutions.</P>
<P>AND Faith, <HI>entre nous,</HI> I think we are in the Right of it. Time will not stay for us, why should we stay for Time. The future Moments are scarcely worth reflecting on, the past too painful to remember, and the present only fit for Laughter. Let us then socially sacrifice to <HI>Mirth</HI> and <HI>true Humour:</HI> As in the ancient Days of Pleasantry our Forefathers tasted the Sweets of joyful Society.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Spirit of Hospitality</HI> pre∣sided at their Tables; <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>good Humour</HI> were their Companions; and <HI>Fancy</HI> furnish'd out the Feast.</P>
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
<P>But to return to my History.</P>
<P><HI>ALEXANDER the Great</HI> was a famous <HI>Hummer;</HI> he persuaded the <HI>Macedonians</HI> into a Belief he was the Son of <HI>Jupiter;</HI> but he carried the Joke rather too far, for he be∣lieved it himself at last; so may pro∣perly be said to be <HI>self-hum'd:</HI> Like the Miser who pick'd his own Pocket.</P>
<P><HI>ALCIBIADES</HI> was certainly a very great Master of this Science: But why should I disturb the tawny Mold of these Dust-converted Heroes; not but there were some very pretty Fellows formerly to be sure. For In∣stance;</P>
<P><HI>SCIPIO</HI> was a very modest Fel∣low; yet I take <HI>Laelius</HI> to be but a led <HI>Captain,</HI> and <HI>Socrates</HI> little better than a <HI>Putt: Demosthenes</HI> said a great
<PB N="x" REF="10"/>many good Things, and <HI>Caesar</HI> had certainly something very smart about him: <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> was a very <HI>jemmy Fellow,</HI> and <HI>Cleopatra</HI> quite the Thing to be sure; <HI>Lucretia</HI> was a Fright, and <HI>Virginius</HI> a Beast of a Fellow: <HI>Virgil</HI> had a good deal of the Gentle∣man about him, and <HI>Horace</HI> was a very honest Fellow: <HI>Ovid</HI> was a good Woman's Man, and <HI>Cicero</HI> tolerable Company: But what's all this to the Purpose, if the fine Fellows of for∣mer Ages were alive now, they would be looked on little better than <HI>Tra∣montanes.</HI></P>
<P>FOR pray, what Figure would <HI>Phocion</HI> cut in a <HI>Pump-Room,</HI> or how would <HI>Hannibal</HI> behave in a <HI>Minuet. Ulysses</HI> might do something at <HI>Brough∣ton</HI>'s perhaps, but what would become of <HI>Aristides</HI> at a <HI>Masquerade,</HI> or who
<PB N="xi" REF="11"/>would take <HI>Epaminondas</HI> for a Partner at a <HI>Card-Table?</HI></P>
<P>IT is not by slaying of Monsters, founding of Empires, or being Tem∣pest-toss'd for half a Score Years, we now become great. The System of Life is entirely altered. If we must give Battle, what can we better kill than out Time. And if we would do any Thing for Posterity, we may endeavour to increase the In∣fant Inhabitants of the <HI>Foundling-Hospital;</HI> and as to encountring Fa∣tigues, the rule Jolts of a Hackney-Coach over the rough irregular Streets, and broken Pavement, is enough to dis∣compose the Oeconomy of both Limbs and Linnen of the prettiest Fellow ex∣isting.</P>
<P>I BEG Pardon for this Digression, and shall leave the Ancients to their
<PB N="xii" REF="12"/>Commentators, and look into our own Times, see how far this <HI>Hum∣bugg,</HI> (or <HI>Humbuzz,</HI> as <HI>Ben John∣son</HI> calls it:) I say, see how far it has spread.</P>
<P>ITS Etymology is difficult to ascer∣tain; though <HI>Machaon,</HI> in his <HI>Tuscan</HI> Treatise upon <HI>Muscular Motion,</HI> de∣rives it from the Sounds which issued from the Nostrils of the <HI>Phoenician Fanatics,</HI> when they pretended to un∣dergo the Operation of the Spirit. No bad <HI>Hum</HI> that, nor badly propagated since. It became general in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Time, who must be allowed a <HI>Hero in Humming.</HI></P>
<P>IN the merry Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, all these formal Fashions were banish'd, and a new Branch of this Science was introduced by <HI>Jack
<PB N="xiii" REF="13"/>Bite</HI> and Miss <HI>Quibble,</HI> who lived very handsomely at the Court by selling Bargains.</P>
<P>THEY have continued, Courtiers-like, in Esteem and out, as Caprice and Constitution commanded, till a younger Brother, tired of <HI>Levee</HI> De∣pendance, struck a bold Stroke, and set up for himself.—The Story is thus:</P>
<P>YOUNG HUMM, the Buck I speak of, is a collateral Descendant from the House of <HI>Legend:</HI> A long Time he had been put to his Shifts, rambling about sometimes as a <HI>Gipsy,</HI> a <HI>Mounte∣bank Doctor,</HI> a <HI>Methodist Preacher,</HI> an <HI>Italian Count,</HI> a <HI>Fortune Hunter,</HI> a <HI>decay'd Gentleman,</HI> an <HI>Oculist,</HI> &amp;c. At last he struck at the Stage, and re∣solved to commence <HI>Actor.</HI> He made his first Appearance in the little
<PB N="xiv" REF="14"/>Theatre in the <HI>Haymarket,</HI> in the Character of a <HI>Bottle Conjurer.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT became of him afterwards I could never learn, till by the late Advertisement for <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Benefit, we find that <HI>Actor</HI> has employed him to fill his House for him.</P>
<P>I WISH Your Lordship would lay a Fine on all such Pretenders to Wit, Science, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That no Pedlar in Poetry, no plagiary Humourist, no unclassi∣cal Critic, shall have Liberty to vend his Dregs for true Doctrine.</P>
<P>FOR my own Part, I shall, as Your <HI>Attorney-General,</HI> prefer a Bill against all Pretenders to <HI>Hum,</HI> who dare practise without being able to shew a sensible Diploma; or, at least a De∣putation from the Court of good Hu∣mour.</P>
<PB N="xv" REF="15"/>
<P>THAT is the Court which all Men ought to practise in, especially all those who with natural or acquired Qualifications are capable of taking upon them the Character of fine Com∣panions.</P>
<P>WITH Submission to Your Lord∣ship's Judgment, I cannot help giving it as my Opinion, that however Fame-worthy Wit, Wisdom, and Learning are, Good-nature is much their su∣perior.</P>
<P>MY esteeming Good-nature before Wit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be thought in me to proceed from the common Vice of railing at what I cannot enjoy.</P>
<P>I ALLOW it; yet must beg Leave to observe, that although Wit is very pleasing, it is sometimes as hurtful; it often raises up a Foe, seldom makes a Friend.</P>
<PB N="xvi" REF="16"/>
<P>A MAN of Wit and Humour may justly be compared to a beautiful Girl without a Fortune; they both attract many Admirers, who pay strong Court for Possession; but it is momentary Self-Gratification only they aim at. After, long Enjoyment blunts the Edge of Appetite, and Familiarity renders every wish'd-for Perfection common. Satiety succeeds Desire, and the former Lovers are no longer anxious after Enjoyment. What is then to become of those Victims to Frolic? The Girl languishes out her Disease-shorten'd Days in an Hospi∣tal; and the Man of Wit, broken-hearted, perishes in Goal, under the miserable Reflections of mispent Time and baseless Friendships.</P>
<P>BUT, Mr. SPARKS, give me Leave seriously to address you, and in this
<PB N="xvii" REF="17"/>public Manner declare, That if every one, who likes you as an Actor, was to be a Witness, like me, of your Be∣haviour in private Life, You would, if <HI>possible,</HI> be much more respected than You are at present. You are very pleasing as an Actor, highly di∣verting as a Companion, but more Praise-worthy as <HI>a Man.</HI> I know You to be a sensible Friend, an indul∣gent Father, and an affectionate Hus∣band. These are Qualities none can exceed, few come up to. When the Sallies of Wit and Humour shall de∣cay, when the Grape's enlivening Juice becomes tasteless, and when the best Company ceases to be entertaining, this Character shall remain. Then in Your last, in Your latest Moments, shall You enjoy the secret Satisfaction of an honest well-spent Life.</P>
<PB N="xviii" REF="18"/>
<P>LONG may those Moments be distant.</P>
<P>I HAVE almost thought myself into a Fit of the Vapours, and, I believe, at this present Reading, You are not much better; therefore, if Your Lord∣ship pleases, I'll call a new Cause, and consider of — what — why myself, tho' that is a Topic hardly worth Con∣sideration, and what, indeed, I am very unfit for.</P>
<P>METHINKS some hasty Readers may cry out, What is all this about, this <HI>Humdrum?</HI> What a Plague does this <HI>Stevens</HI> trouble us with himself and such Stuff? Why, that's true, faith, I can plead nothing in Defence of this Paper-wasting Practice, this CACOETHES SCRIBENDI, (there's Learn∣ing, my Lord) I say, I can plead no∣thing
<PB N="xix" REF="19"/>in Defence of myself but Idle∣ness and the Fashion; and if they don't acquit me—why I'm undone, that's all.</P>
<P>YOU say in Your EPILOGUE, that the Town is the Jury: To them therefore I submit; and if any Per∣formance of mine, either as an Author, or Actor, can amuse them, my End is answered, my Labour paid: But if, on the Contrary, I'm condemned, why, Silk-worm like, I'll wrap myself up in my own Labours, and dose out the rest of my Days in Dirt and Despair; a miserable <HI>Momento</HI> to all wou'd-be Wits my Cotemporaries.</P>
<P>IT is very hard to be witty, and a melancholy Thing, very melancholy indeed, when we want to arrive at Wit: And Dulness (fast Friend to us
<PB N="xx" REF="20"/>Rhime-makers) claps an Embargo on our Understandings. But though I can't come at Wit, I may at Sincerity; and, possessed of that, dare say, if a single Page in the following Burlesque meets with Approbation from the Readers of Taste in this Metropolis, I shall from thenceforth begin to have a good Opinion of a certain Son of Indiscretion, called,</P>

<HEAD>THE GENEALOGY OF THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>IOWEN LLWYDDGMACH DUOLLCHYRFDSFITH, Genealogist,</P>
<P>Having well and faithfully examined all the Records relating to the Family of our AUTHOR, find him duly and truly poetically begot, being a Descendant, in a Right Line, from the famous,</P>
<P><HI>Joan la Pucelle,</HI> commonly call'd the Maid of <HI>Orleans.</HI></P>
<P>She falling in Love with Mons. <HI>Rondeau,</HI> Madri∣gall Maker to the Court, bore him one Son, who for the Incontinency of his Mother, was forced to take the Vow of Celibacy upon him and turn Monk.</P>
<P>He invented those Rhymes, afterwards called <HI>Leonine Verses.</HI></P>
<P>But eloping from the Monastery, he hired himself to a <HI>German</HI> Anagrammatist,</P>
<P>Whose Daughter he married, and she bare him a Son called <HI>Johannes Initialis,</HI> Inventor of Acrostics.</P>
<P><HI>Signiora Cramboni,</HI> Rebus-Maker to the <HI>Basso-Re∣lievo</HI> College at <HI>Padua,</HI> married <HI>Johannes,</HI> and they had one Child call'd <HI>DORMIO DRAMMATICO.</HI></P>
<PB N="23" REF="23"/>
<P>He first added Verses to the Ends of Acts of he∣roic Plays, vulgarly called <HI>Tragedy Taggs.</HI></P>
<P>From him came <HI>Tom Travesty, Dubartas,</HI> and <HI>El∣kannah Settle,</HI> Motto-Maker and Professor of Poetry to my Lord-Mayors Pageants. He wrote a Play call'd <HI>Pope Joan,</HI> and taking a Fancy to the Lady who acted the Heroine, he married her, and she bore him a Son, the origi∣nal Composer of <HI>Bellmen</HI>'s <HI>Verses;</HI> his Name was <HI>Dactyle,</HI> he married into the <HI>Spondee</HI> Fa∣mily, a Sister of the House of <HI>Pindarics,</HI></P>
<P>Who put the <HI>London Cries</HI> into <HI>Metre.</HI></P>
<P>These were Great Grand-Father and Mother to our AUTHOR.</P>
<P>His Grand-Father was Prologue-Writer to <HI>Powel</HI>'s Puppet-Show; and his Grand-mother Poesy-Poetess for Wedding-Rings.</P>
<P>His own Father was Distich-maker to Sign Painters, and his Mother made St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s best Ballads.</P>
<P>As to himself, he never before this Attempt ar∣rived at any Thing greater than writing Couplets for Astrologers to decorate Almanacks with, or now-and-then assisting at an <HI>AEnigma</HI> for the Ma∣gazine.</P>
<P>He has met with great Success in composing <HI>Va∣lentines:</HI> And once put up for the Place of Epitaph Maker to the Company of Tombstone-Cutters.</P>
<P>This Publication is therefore made to enable him to stand Candidate for the Employment of HISTORIOGRAPHER to the <HI>HOTTENTOTS.</HI></P>
<P>Which Place now being vacant, he hopes to fill with Reputation, as he happens to be related to the chief Families in that Kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE Second ACT.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Second Part, the Reader, if he will give himself the Trouble of looking over them, will find some Notes, which seem as if design'd to drole on Mr. <HI>War∣burton</HI>'s Observations. They were so. For though Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> is uni∣versal in Learning, he is not quite so perfect in Judgment and Taste; un∣less, like the great Mr. <HI>Addison,</HI> he
<PB N="70" REF="70"/>suffers Prejudice to get the better of both.</P>
<P>EVERY Part of <HI>Grammar</HI> he is Master of, yet there is one Part of Speech he is sometimes deficient in; which is, <HI>Good Manners.</HI> This, I think, is obvious to every Reader, who will peruse his Notes on SHAKE∣SPEAR; for he has, out of the Fulness of his Spleen, been pleas'd to lead the <HI>Players</HI> with several gross, undeserved Epithets, throughout his Annotations.</P>
<P>FOR, whenever any Interpolation, by an ignorant Transcriber, has been foisted into the Text, he is not con∣tent with casting the Odium on the Players, but immediately adds the Epithets, <HI>foolish, infamous, imperti∣nent,</HI> or <HI>prophane.</HI> Certainly he must forget SHAKFSPEAR was a <HI>Player;</HI> if he does not, in regard to so great a
<PB N="71" REF="71"/>Genius, he might treat his Brethren with a little more Lenity.</P>
<P>THE Usage the Actors have re∣ceived from him, urged me,
<Q><L>The meanest in Renown;</L>
<L>The poorest Trifler of the Town,</L></Q>
to twirl a Sling against this <HI>Classical Goliah;</HI> for, I think, every Person belonging to the Theatres, has a Right to treat that Man with Ridicule, who endeavours to throw them into Con∣tempt.</P>
<P>LIKE <HI>Scaliger,</HI> he quits the Gen∣tleman when he takes up the Critic, and thinks a Multitude of Learning will attone for an Abundance of Rudeness; but, with Submission to his Scholarship, Good-nature is as far before great Learning, as the Actions
<PB N="72" REF="72"/>of the Heart to the Intentions of the Head.</P>

<L>Shall I get drunk, or shall I not, my Friends:</L>
<L>Let me consider; 'tis a Point precarious.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To drink, or not to drink, that's the Question:</L>
<L>Whether 'tis nobler in a Man to suffer</L>
<L>From Gout, or Dropsy, by outrageous Drinking,</L>
<L>Or prudent arm our Reason 'gainst Debauch,</L>
<L>By Temperance to cure them. Let me think:</L>
<L>If by a social Glass or two, we cure</L>
<L>The Vapours, and elate the Woe-worn Mind;</L>
<L>'Tis a Prescription which ev'ry Wretch should take.</L>
<L>To thirst —to drink—to drink perhaps too much.</L>
<L>Ah! there's the Rub—the Fear of getting drunk</L>
<L>Adorns Sobriety with all its Charms:</L>
<L>Else, who'd Attendance and Dependance feel?</L>
<L>Who'd gloomy sit, on rainy Days, at Home?</L>
<L>By Weather mop'd: Who'd be by Spleen op∣press'd?</L>
<L>Or, sorrowing, sigh for an ungrateful Fair?</L>
<L>Bad Luck at Hazard, or worse Luck at Law?</L>
<L>When each, at once, might lay Remembrance dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lay Remembrance dead</HI>— Ay, but how—Why, by drink∣ing to be sure, that must be his Meaning.
<P>There is a Line in SHAKESPEAR'S <HI>As you like it,</HI> of striking <HI>dead,</HI> spoke by the Clown, which has been altered, and inter∣preted, I think, very oddly. The Line is,</P>
<P><HI>It strikes a Man more dead than a great Reckoning in a little Room.</HI> The <HI>Oxford</HI> Edition alters it to <HI>a great R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king in a little Room.</HI> Mr. <HI>W.</HI> denies that, keeps to the original Text, but says, <HI>the Line means that the Bill was very extravagant, and every Thing the Guests had, very bad and mean.</HI></P>

Mr. <HI>W.</HI> observes, that Men of Hair signifies Men nimble, and that the Phrase is taken from Tennis-Balls, <HI>because they are stuffed with Hair;</HI> so that the Sense is, <HI>they are stuffed with Hair.</HI></P>
<P>Now when they enter, it happens they were all dressed like Satyrs, all in shaggy Dresses made of <HI>Hair,</HI> which was what the Servant meant; but his Interpretation is like the Fo∣reigner's, who mistook the Words under a Sign, <HI>Money for live Hair,</HI> to signify, <HI>Money for living here.</HI></P></NOTE>,</L>

<P><HI>Sluic'd</HI> is too indelicate a Word for a fine Lady to make use of. I think it is the Business of every Commentator, to be nice in regulating the Ideas of his Characters, or else we may construe Expressions, put into the Mouths of nice Ladies, to very gross Meanings. Well has Mr. <HI>W.</HI> shewed us an Ex∣ample of that, by his Note in <HI>King Lear,</HI> Act I.

<P>By the Square of the Senses, we are here to understand, the <HI>four</HI> nobler Senses, <HI>viz.</HI> Seeing, Hearing, Tasting, and Smell∣ing; for a young Lady could not, with any Decency, insinuate, she knew of any Pleasure which the fifth afforded.</P>

<P>Heaven is immaterial, abstracted from infinite Space; for the World lies in the Clouds, as a Wash-Ball in a Bason of Suds: Therefore, Gra∣vitation's

<L>And crawling Caterpillars trembling fly.</L>
<L>Now purring Cats the nimble Mice pursue,</L>
<L>And boneless Ghosts turn twinkling Candles blue.</L>
