<DIV2>
<HEAD>1. TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>WORTHY PATRONS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WERE I to address you in the accustomed declamatory strain which has long been adopted as the <HI>universal lan∣guage</HI> of dedications, viz. FLATTERY, I should not only merit your contempt, for thus endeavouring to impose upon your un∣derstandings, but also render myself ridicu∣lously conspicuous, by a feeble attempt to perform that, for which, as well by nature as long established habit, I am totally dis∣qualified.</P>
<P>On the other hand, I should esteem myself equally meriting your censure, as being guilty of a flagrant species of ingratitude, were I to omit availing myself of so favourable an op∣portunity
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
as now presents itself of expressing the respect and veneration I entertain for you, resulting from the very extensive and ample encouragement with which you have crowned my indefatigable exertions to ob∣tain your patronage, by largely contributing to the diffusion of science and rational enter∣tainment, on such moderate terms as were heretofore unknown.</P>
<P>Permit me to indulge the pleasing hope, that when I assert my mind is deeply im∣pressed with the most grateful sense of the obligation, I shall be honoured with credit. If this opinion be well founded, to enlarge on the subject were superfluous—if other∣wise, the strongest arguments, the most splendid and forcible language could convey, would not ensure conviction; I therefore desist, fully persuaded that the most satisfac∣tory demonstration I can possibly exhibit of the sincerity of this declaration, will be, an inviolable adherence to that uniform line of
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
conduct which has already secured your ap∣probation to a degree eminent as unprece∣dented, and which indeed is daily rendered more evident, by a progressive increase in the number and extent of your commands, trust∣ing, that so long as you find my practice invariably correspondent to those professions so frequently exhibited to your notice (from which to deviate would render me unworthy your protection) you will in defiance of all malignant opposition, firmly persevere in the liberal support of him whose primary ambi∣tion it is, and during life shall be, to distin∣guish himself as,</P>

<PB REF="8" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>CUSTOM, it has been repeatedly observed by many of my worthy (and some per∣haps <HI>unworthy</HI>) predecessors in authorship, has rendered a preface almost indispensibly necessary; while others again have as fre∣quently remarked, that "<HI>custom is the law of fools</HI>." These considerations induced me to hesitate whether I should usher my perform∣ance into the world with a preface, and thus hazard being classed with the adherents to that law, or by omitting it, escape the op∣probrium, for "<HI>who shall decide when doctors disagree?</HI>" Now though I would not take upon me to decide in every point in which doctors disagree, yet after giving the present subject that mature consideration which so important a concern required, I thought my∣self fully competent to decide, if not to general satisfaction, at least so as fully to sa∣tisfy
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>
one particular person, for whom I pro∣fess to have a very great regard, though per∣haps few are to be found who would be equally condescending to him, who that per∣son is I do not wish publicly to declare, as (being a very modest man) it might offend him, I shall only say, the more you read the memoirs contained in the following pages, the better you will become acquainted with him; I grounded my decision on these argu∣ments; I concluded as most of my brethren of the quill do of their labours, that my performance possessed so much intrinsic me∣rit, as would occasion it to be universally admired by all good judges, as a prodigious effort of human genius, and that this ap∣probation must naturally excite the envy of some authors, who had not met with that high applause <HI>they</HI> deemed themselves entitled to, and incline them to search for imperfections in my work, and though I was persuaded of the impossibility of their finding
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
any, yet being thus foiled, they might catch at the want of a preface, and construe <HI>that</HI> into an omission, so that in order to disarm them, I resolved to have one, espe∣cially as those who deem prefaces unnecessary, may, if they choose, decline reading it, whilst those on the other side of the question, if there was none, might be disappointed, and have cause for complaint; but to be serious (if I can.)</P>
<P>Almost every author on producing the effusions of his pen (and his brain if he has any) thinks it prudent to introduce himself by a kind of <HI>Prologue</HI>, as it may be called, stating his reasons with due precision for intruding himself on his readers (whether true or otherwise, is not always material to enquire) bespeaking their candour towards his weaknesses and imperfections (which by the bye, few authors are so sensible of as their readers) and not unfrequently endeavouring to soothe those GOLIAHS
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>
in literature ycleped <HI>critics</HI> (with whom not many little Davids are found hardy enough to contend) believing thus to coax them into good humour, or perhaps if his vanity preponderates, he throws the gaunlet of defiance, with a view of terrifying them either to hold their peace, or do justice to those mighty abilities <HI>he</HI> is confident he possesses, in a degree eminently superior to most of his brethren.</P>
<P>For my own part, I disclaim adopting either of these modes, convinced, that in the first case, every reader, whatever the author may plead, will (and indeed ought) to judge for himself, and with regard to professed critics, were I so disposed (which I am not) neither my natural or acquired abilities enable me to <HI>bully</HI> those who must be very ill qualified for their task, if they were thus to be intimidated from declaring their real sentiments; and on the other hand to effect a degree of humility, and by flattery
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
to aim at warping their minds, is in my opinion, paying them a very bad com∣pliment.</P>
<P>So much for others—now for myself:</P>
<P>Never should I have ventured to appear in this habit before the public, had not the following motives urged me thereto:</P>
<P>Many friends have frequently expressed a desire of obtaining from myself such par∣ticulars as they could rely on, of my passage through life, and many enemies (for such I have in common with other men, from the monarch down to the poor cobler) have been industrious in propagating what∣ever reports they thought would best tend to impede my farther progress; among the rest, the editors of a periodical publication now on the decline (whether deservedly or not, let others determine) thought proper to exhibit me as they have done many much more eminent and distinguished characters, in a literary portrait, containing a few out∣lines
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>
it is true, but with some features which they must have known to be false.</P>
<P>After having been repeatedly <HI>threatened</HI> by a very particular friend and others, that if I declined drawing up a narrative, they were determined to do it for me, the first mentioned gentleman prevailed on me (as the most likely mode to bring it to a period) to devote now and then a spare hour in mi∣nuting down some of the most material oc∣currences of my life, and to send them to him in an epistolary form, intending to digest the whole into a regular narrative for pub∣lication, that gentleman however, on pe∣rusal was of opinion that it would be additionally acceptable to the curious part of the public, if exhibited to them in the plain and simple manner in which they were written, as thus tending to display such traits and features of a somewhat original character, as would give a more perfect idea of "I, great I, the little hero of each
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>
tale," than any other mode that could have been adopted, especially as many <HI>intelligent</HI> persons were confident I could not write at all, while others <HI>kindly</HI> attributed to me what I never wrote.</P>
<P>If among the multitude of memoirs under which the press has groaned, and with which it still continues to be tortured, the following sheets should afford some degree of entertainment, as a relaxation from more grave and solid studies, to an inquisitive and candid reader (those of an opposite descrip∣tion are not to be pleased with the ablest performance) and he should deem it not the worst, nor the most expensive among the numerous tribe, I shall esteem myself amply rewarded; had I, however, been disposed to be more attentive to entertainment, and less to veracity, I might to many have ren∣dered it much more agreeable, though less satisfactory to myself, as I believe the obser∣vation
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>
long since made to be just, that few books are so ill written, but that something may be gleaned from their perusal.</P>
<P>Should the insignificance of <HI>my</HI> life in∣duce any person better qualified to present the world with <HI>his,</HI> big with interesting events, my disposing of several large edi∣tions of that performance will afford me more <HI>solid</HI> satisfaction as a <HI>bookseller,</HI> than any success or emolument which can possibly arise from this, my first, and most probably last, essay as an <HI>author.</HI></P>
<P>If unfortunately any of my kind readers should find the book so <HI>horrid dull</HI> and <HI>stupid,</HI> that they cannot get through it, or if they do, and wish not to travel the same road again, I here declare my perfect readiness to supply them with abundance of books, much more learned, much more en∣tertaining, much more witty, much more —whatever they please, they never shall
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>
want books while L. is able to assist them; and whether they prefer one of his writing, or that of any other author, he protests he will not be in the smallest degree offended: let every author make the same declaration if he can.</P>
<P>Should my memoirs be attended with no other benefit to society, they will at least tend to shew what may be effected by a persevering habit of industry, and an upright conscientious demeanour in trade towards the public, and probably inspire some one of perhaps superior abilities, with a laudable ambition, to emerge from obscurity, by a proper application of those talents with which Providence has fa∣voured him, to his own credit and emolument, as well as the benefit of the community. To such an one I ever have, and ever shall wish every possible success, as it has uniformly been my opinion, that whatever is thus acquired, is more honourable to the parties than the possession of wealth obtained with∣out any intrinsic merit or exertion, and,
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>
which is too frequently consumed with rapi∣dity in the pursuit of vice and dissipation.</P>
<P>One word to my old <HI>friends</HI> the booksellers under <HI>number three</HI> of my dedication. This publication it is to be expected will tend to excite some degree of mirth in them. Con∣scious that I have often been the cause (however unintentional on my part) of ex∣citing less pleasing sensations in them, I will readily allow them full scope; however, ac∣cording to the well known adage, <Q>“Let ”them laugh who win,</Q> I hope they will indulge me in the same propensity of laugh∣ing if not <HI>at</HI> them, at least <HI>with</HI> them.</P>
<P>As a proof of my friendly disposition, I shall here add a piece of advice, which I do not hesitate to pronounce will, if attended to, entitle them to promotion into my <HI>first</HI> class of booksellers, and eventually prove more beneficial than a constant perseverance in the mode of conduct they have hitherto pursued; and those who have children will
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>
I hope see the propriety of inculcating the same doctrine to them for their future benefit; and as I flatter myself my advice will prove equally productive of benefit to great num∣bers of the community at large as to book∣sellers. It is this,</P>
<P>If they observe any person by industry and application endeavouring to obtain an honest livelihood in that line for which his talents or disposition have qualified him, never to attempt by dark inuendos, sly hints, and false aspersions to injure him, as, if he hap∣pens to be a man of a becoming spirit, such conduct will only tend to increase his exer∣tions, and render him still more cautious to obtain a good character, in so doing their weapons will recoil on themselves, and they will have the mortification to see him flourish, whilst they become objects of contempt in the eyes of the public, and will of course be avoided by them.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="19"/>But I forget myself, from debating whether a preface was really necessary or not, if I proceed thus I shall produce one as long as my book, as indeed some of my seniors in authorship have done before me, though not altogether consistent with pro∣priety.</P>
<P>I will therefore conclude with a wish that my readers may enjoy the feast with the same good humour with which I have prepared it; they will meet with some <HI>solid</HI> though not much <HI>coarse</HI> food, and the major part I hope light and easy of digestion; those with keen appetites will partake of each dish, while others more delicate may select such dishes as are more light and better adapted to their palates; they are all genuine British fare, one dish of French constitution <HI>ragout</HI> ex∣cepted. But lest they should be at a loss to know what the entertainment consists of, I beg leave to inform them that it contains forty-five dishes of various sizes, which (if
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>
they calculate the expence of their <HI>admission tickets)</HI> they will find does not amount to <HI>three halfpence</HI> per dish; and what I hope they will consider as <HI>immensely</HI> valuable, (in compliance with the precedent of a modern author, eminent in the culinary science) a striking likeness of their <HI>Cook</HI> into the bar∣gain.</P>
<P>I have also prepared a bill of fare—here it is, they are heartily welcome, and much good may it do them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have often requested me to devote what few leisure moments I could spare in mi∣nuting down some of the principal occur∣rences of my life, with a view, sooner or later, of exhibiting the account to the public eye; who, as you were pleased to say, could not but be somewhat curious to learn some well-authenticated
<PB N="2" REF="33"/>
particulars of a man, well known to have risen from an obscure origin to a degree of notice, and to a participation of the favor of the Public, in a particular line of business, I may without vanity say, hitherto unprecedented.</P>
<P>Ever willing to pay a becoming deference to the judgment of a person of your acknow∣leged merits, and whom I have the felicity of numbering among my firmest friends, yet being less anxious to appear as an adventurer among the numerous tribe of authors, than to continue a considerable vender of the pro∣duce of their labors, I have continually de∣layed complying with your kind wishes.— By the bye, does the publication of a Cata∣logue of Books entitle the compiler to the name of <HI>Author</HI>? If it does, many Booksellers have long had a claim to that distinction, by the annual publication of their Catalogues, and myself, as <HI>author</HI> of a very voluminous one every six months. The reason for my asking this question, is, I last year observed a
<PB N="3" REF="34"/>
certain bookseller published his first Catalogue with this introduction:—"As this is the first Catalogue ever the AUTHOR made, and is done in great haste, he hopes inaccuracies will be treated with lenity."</P>
<P>But to return from this digression. I should probably have still delayed compiling my narrative, if the editors of a certain periodi∣cal publication, who monthly labor to be wit∣ty, had not deemed me of sufficient conse∣quence to introduce into their work, what they are pleased to call a <HI>Portrait</HI> of me! and though it was by them intended as a caricatura, yet I am persuaded it will appear to those who best know me, as a daubing more characteri∣stic of the heavy brush of a manufacturer of signs, than the delicate pencil of a true por∣trait painter; and on that account I should most certainly have considered it as unworthy notice, had they not daubed me with false features. This at once determined my wavering resolution, and I am now fully resolved to mi∣nute down such particulars of my passage
<PB N="4" REF="35"/>
through life, as, though not adorned with an elegance of stile, will I assure you possess, what, to you, I flatter myself, will be a greater recommendation, viz. a strict adherence to truth. And though no doubt you will meet with some occurrences in which you may find cause for censure, yet I hope others will present themselves, which your candour will induce you to commend. Should you be able to afford the whole a patient perusal, and think the account meriting the public eye, I shall cheerfully submit to your decision, con∣vinced that you will not,
<Q><L>"With mean complacence e'er betray your trust,</L>
<L>"Nor be so civil as to prove unjust."</L></Q></P>
<P>John Dunton, a brother <HI>Bibliopole,</HI> long since exhibited a whole volume of dullness, which he called his "Life and <HI>errors."</HI> The latter term I believe might be a very proper appendage to the title page of the innumera∣ble lives which have been, and which will be published: For what man will dare to say of himself, his life has not been loaded with er∣rors?
<PB N="5" REF="36"/>
That mine has been such, I readily ac∣knowledge: And should this narrative be pub∣lished, many perhaps may deem that act another (possibly the greatest) error. To those I shall only observe, that "to err is human, to forgive divine."</P>
<P>As an additional stimulus, I can assure you as an absolute fact, that several gentlemen have at different periods (one very lately) in∣timated to me their intentions of engaging in the task, if I longer declined it.</P>

<P>IN my last I hinted that I should confine myself to a plain narrative of facts unem∣bellished with the meretricious aid of lofty figures, or representations of things which
<PB N="7" REF="38"/>
never had existence, but in the brain of the author. I shall therefore not trouble you with a history of predictions which foretold the future greatness of your humble servant, nor with a minute account of the aspects of the Planets at the very auspicious and important crisis when first I inhaled the air of this bust∣ling orb; for, extraordinary as it may appear, it has never yet occurred to me that any of the adepts in the astrological science have made a calculation of my nativity; 'tis probable this high honor is by the planets destined to adorn the sublime lucubrations of the very ingenious Mr. SIBLEY, in the next edition of his stup— endous work! And here, for the honor of the craft, let me remark, that this most sublime genius, has with myself, to boast (and who would not boast of their genealogy in having a prince for their ancestor?) in being a Son of the renowned PRINCE CRISPIN.</P>
<P>A Volume has been written with the title of "The Honor of the Taylors; or the His∣tory of Sir JOHN HAWKWOOD." But were
<PB N="8" REF="39"/>
any learned writer to undertake—The Honor of the Shoemakers, or the History of——, how insignificant a figure would the poor Tay∣lors make, when compared with the honora∣ble craft!</P>
<Q><L>"Coblers from Crispin boast their Public Spirit,</L>
<L>"And all are upright downright men of merit."</L></Q>
<P>Should I live to see as many editions of my History published, as there have been of the Pilgrim's Progress, I may be induced to pre∣sent the world with a Folio on that important subject.</P>
<P>But to begin:</P>
<P>Were I inclined to pride myself in genealogical descent, I might here boast that the family were originally settled at White Lackington, in Somersetshire, which obtained its name from one of my famous ancestors, and give you a long detail of their grandeur, &amp;c. but having as little leisure as inclination to boast of what if true would add nothing to my merits, I shall for the present only say, that I was born at Wellington in Somersetshire, on the 31st of
<PB N="9" REF="40"/>
August, (old style) 1746. My father George Lackington, was a Journeyman Shoemaker, who had incurred the displeasure of my grand∣father for marrying my mother, whose maid∣en name was Joan Trott. She was the daughter of a poor weaver in Wellington; a good honest man, whose end was remarkable, though not very fortunate; in the road be∣tween Taunton and Wellington, he was found drowned in a ditch, where the water scarcely covered his face: He was, 'tis conjectured,
<Q>"—Drunk when he died."</Q>
This happened some years before the mar∣riage of my Father and mother.</P>
<P>My Grandfather George Lackington had been a Gentleman Farmer at Langford, a vil∣lage two miles from Wellington, and acquired a pretty considerable property. But my fa∣ther's mother dying when my father was but about thirteen years of age, my Grand∣father, who had two daughters, bound my father an apprentice to a Mr. Hordly, a master shoe-maker, in Wellington, with an intention
<PB N="10" REF="41"/>
of setting him up in that business at the expi∣ration of his time. But my father worked a year or two as a journeyman, and then dis∣pleased his father by marrying a woman with∣out a shilling, of a mean family, and who sup∣ported herself by spinning of wool into yarn, so that my mother was delivered of your friend and humble servant, her first-born, and hope of the family, in my grandmother Trott's poor cottage; and that good old woman car∣ried me privately to church, unknown to my father who was (nominally) a Quaker, that being the religion of his ancestors.</P>
<P>About the year 1750, my father having three or four children, and my mother prov∣ing an excellent wife, my grandfather's re∣sentment had nearly subsided, so that he sup∣plied him with money to open a shop for <HI>himself.</HI> But that which was intended to be of very great service to him and his family eventually proved extremely unfortunate to himself and them. For as soon as he found he was more at ease in his circumstances he
<PB N="11" REF="42"/>
contracted a fatal habit of drinking, and of course his business was neglected; so that after several fruitless attempts of my grandfather to keep him in trade, he was, partly by a very large family, but more by his habitual drunkenness, reduced to his old state of a jour∣neyman shoemaker: Yet so infatuated was he with the love of liquor, that the endearing ties of husband and father could not restrain him: by which baneful habit himself and family were involved in the extremest poverty.
<Q><L>"To mortal men great loads allotted be;</L>
<L>"But of all packs, no pack like poverty."</L>

so that neither myself, my Brothers, or Sis∣ters are indebted to a Father scarcely for any thing that can endear his memory, or cause us to reflect on him with pleasure.
<Q><L>"Children, the blind effects of Love and chance</L>
<L>"Bear from their birth the impression of a Slave."</L>

<L>"How adverse runs ths destiny of some creatures!</L>
<L>"Some only can get riches and no children.</L>
<L>"We only can get children and no riches;</L>
<L>"Then 'tis the prudent part to check our will,</L>
<L>"And, till our state rise, make our blood stand still,</L></Q>
But to our mother we are indebted for every thing. "She was a woman, take her for all in all, I shall not see her like again." Never did I know or hear of a woman who worked and lived so hard as she did to support Eleven chil∣dren: and were I to relate the particulars, it would not gain credit. So I shall only observe, that for many years together, she worked generally nineteen or twenty hours out of every twenty-four; even when very near her time, sometimes at one hour she was seen walking backwards and forwards by her Spinning-wheel, and her midwife sent for the next.</P>
<P>Out of love to her family▪ she totally ab∣stained from every kind of Liquor, water excepted, her food was chiefly broth, (little better than water and oatmeal) turnips, pota∣toes, cabbage, carrots, &amp;c. her children fared
<PB N="13" REF="44"/>
something better, but not much, as you may well suppose. When I reflect on the astonishing hardships and sufferings of so worthy a woman, and her helpless infants, I find myself ready to curse the husband and father that could thus involve them in such a deplorable scene of mi∣sery and distress. Yet heaven forbid that I should imprecate its vengeance on my father, who has been long since laid in his Grave: I had better conclude with the admonition in the old ballad,
<Q><L>"Learn to be wise by others harm"</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I was the eldest, and my father being for the first few years a careful hard∣working man, I fared something better than my brothers and sisters. I was put for two or three years to a day-school kept by an old woman; and I well remember how proud I used to be to see several ancient dames lift up their hands and eyes with astonishment, while I repeated by memory several chapters out of the New Testament, concluding me from this specimen to be a prodigy of sci∣ence. But my career of learning was soon at an end, when my mother got so poor that she could not afford two-pence per week for
<PB N="15" REF="46"/>
my schooling. Besides I was obliged to sup∣ply the place of a nurse to several of my brothers and sisters. The consequence of which was, that what little I had learned was presently forgot; and instead of learning to read, &amp;c. it very early became my chief delight to excel in all kinds of boyish mis∣chiefs: and I soon arrived to be the captain and leader of all the boys in the neighbour∣hood, so that if any old woman's lanthorn was kicked out of her hand, or drawn up a sign-post, or if any thing was fastened to her tail, or if her door was nailed up, I was sure to be accused as the author, whether I really were so or not.</P>
<P>But one of my tricks had nearly proved fatal to me. I had observed that <HI>yawning</HI> was infectious; and with a determination to have some sport, I collected several boys to∣gether one market-day evening, and instruct∣ed them to go amongst the butchers; whi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her I accompanied them. We placed our∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves at proper distances, and at a signal
<PB N="16" REF="47"/>
given, all began to yawn as wide as we could: which immediately had the desired effect; the whole butcher row was set a yawning; on which I and my companions burst out into a hearty laugh, and took to our heels. The trick pleased us so well, that two or three weeks after, we attempted to renew it. But one of the butchers, who was half drunk, perceiving our intention, snatched up his cleaver and threw it at me, which knocked off my hat without doing me any harm.</P>
<P>I was about ten years of age, when a man began to cry <HI>apple-pies</HI> about the streets, I took great notice of his methods of selling his pies, and thought I could do it much better than him. I communicated to a neighbouring baker my thoughts on the subject in such a manner as gave him a very good opinion of my abili∣ties for a pie merchant, and he prevailed on my father to let me live with him. My man∣ner of crying pies, and my activity in selling them, soon made me the favorite of all such as purchased halfpenny apple-pies, and
<PB N="17" REF="48"/>
halfpenny plumb-puddings, so that in a few weeks the old pie-merchant shut up his shop. I lived with this Baker about twelve or fifteen months, in which time I sold such large quantities of pies, puddings, cakes, &amp;c. that he often declared to his friends, in my hearing, that I had been the means of extricating him from the embarrassing circumstances in which he was known to be involved prior to my en∣tering his service.</P>
<P>During the time I continued with this Ba∣ker, many complaints were repeatedly made against me for the childish follies I had been guilty of, such as throwing snow-balls, fright∣ening people by flinging serpents and crackers into their houses, &amp;c. I also happened one day to overturn my master's son, a child about four years old, whom I had been driving in a wheel-barrow. Dreading the consequences, I immediately flew from my master's house, and (it being evening) went to a glazier's, and pro∣cured a parcel of broken glass; I also provided
<PB N="18" REF="49"/>
myself with a pocketful of peas; and thus e∣quipped made fine diversion for myself and my unlucky companions, by going to a number of houses one after another, discharging a handful of pease at the windows, and throw∣ing down another handful of glass in the street at the same instant, which made such a noise as very much frightened many people, who had no doubt of their windows being bro∣ken into a thousand pieces. This adventure, together with throwing the child out of the wheel-barrow, produced such a clamour against me amongst the old women, that I would not return to my master, and not knowing what else to do, I went home to my father, who, you may easily conceive could not afford to keep me idle, so I was soon set down by his side to learn his own Trade; and I con∣tinued with him several years, working when he worked, and while he was keeping <HI>Saint Monday,</HI> I was with boys of my own age fighting, cudgel playing, wrestling, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Must not forget an odd adventure that happened when I was about twelve years of age, as it tends to shew in part my dauntless disposition, which discovered itself on many occasions in the very early part of my life.</P>
<P>I had one day walked with my father to Holy-well lake, a village two miles from Wellington, where meeting with some good ale, he could not find in his heart to part from it until late at night. When we were returning home by the way of Rockwell-Green, (commonly called Rogue-Green,
<PB N="20" REF="51"/>
from a gang of robbers and house breakers which formerly lived there) having just passed the bridge, we were met by several men and women, who appeared to be very much frightened, being in great agitation. They informed us that they were returning back to Rogue-Green, in order to sleep there that night. They having been prevented from going home to Wellington by a dreadful Apparition, which they all had seen in the hollow way, about a quarter of a mile distant; adding, that a person had been murdered there formerly, and that the ghost had walked there ever since; that they had never before paid much attention to the well-known report; but now they were obliged to credit it, having had ocular demonstration. My father had drank too large a quantity of ale to be much afraid of any thing, and I (who could not let slip such an opportunity of shewing my courage) seconded matters for the poor terrified people to return with us;
<PB N="21" REF="52"/>
and as I offered to lead the van, they were pre∣vailed on to make the attempt once more; but said, that it was rather presumptuous, and hoped that no dreadful consequence would ensue, as all the company, they trusted, were honest-hearted, and intended no harm to any person: they moreover added, that "God certainly was above the Devil." I then ad∣vanced, and kept before the company about fifty yards.
<Q>"Whistling aloud to bear my courage up."</Q>
But when we had walked about a quarter of a mile, I saw, at some distance before, in the hedge, the dreadful apparition that had so terrified our company. Here it is! (said I) "Lord have mercy upon us!" replyed some of the company, making a full stop; and would have gone back again, but shame pre∣vented them. I still kept my distance before, and called out to them to follow me,—assur∣ing them that I was determined to see what it was. They then fell one behind another,
<PB N="22" REF="53"/>
and advanced in single files. As I proceeded I too was seized with a timid apprehension, but durst not own it; but still kept on be∣fore, although I perceived my hair to heave my hat from my head, and my teeth to chat∣ter in my mouth. In fact I was greatly agi∣tated at what I saw, the object much resem∣bled the human figure as to shape, but the size was prodigious. However, I had promis∣ed to see what it was, and for that purpose, I obstinately ventured on about thirty yards from the place where I first had sight of it. I then perceived that it was only a very short tree, whose limbs had been newly cut off, the doing of which had made it much resem∣ble a giant. I then called to the company, and informed them, with a hearty laugh, that they had been frightened at the stump of a tree.</P>
<P>This story caused excellent diversion for a long time afterwards in Wellington, and I was mentioned as an hero.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="54"/>The pleasure and satisfaction I received from the discovery, and the honour I acquired for the courage I possessed in making it, has, I believe, had much influence on me ever after; as I cannot recollect that in any one instance I have ever observed the least fear of appari∣tions, spirits, &amp;c. since.

Not that I have always steadily disbelieved what has been related of such appearances, a few accounts of which seem so well authenti∣cated, as at least to make me doubt whether there might not exist in the scale of beings some of a more aerial substance than mankind, who may possess both the inclination and the power of assuming our shape, and may per∣haps take as much delight in teazing the hu∣man species, as too many of our species do in teazing and even tormenting those of the brute creation.</P>

<BIBL>Dryden.</BIBL></Q>
<P>While I am on this subject, I cannot resist the temptation of relating a truly ridicu∣lous affair that happened about this time at Taunton.</P>
<P>In the work-house belonging to the Parish of St. James, there lived a young woman who was an idiot: This poor creature had a great aversion to sleeping in a bed, and at bed-time would often run away to a field in the neigh∣bourhood called the Priory, where she slept in the cow-sheds.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="56"/>In order to break her of this bad custom, two men agreed to try if they could not fright∣en her out of it. And one night, when they knew that she was there, they took a white sheet with them, and coming to the place, one of the men concealed himself to see the event, while the other wrapped himself up in the sheet, and walked forwards and back∣wards close before the cowshed in which she was laid. It was some time before Molly paid any attention to the apparition; but at last up she got." Aha!" (said she) "a white devil!" and by her manner of expressing her∣self she thought it was very strange to see a <HI>white</HI> devil. And soon after she exclaimed, "a black devil, too! a black devil, too!" With that the man who had the sheet on, looked over his shoulder, and saw (or ima∣gined that he saw) a person all over black be∣hind him; the sight of which made him take to his heels. Molly then clapped her hands as fast as she could, crying out at the same time,
<PB N="26" REF="57"/>
"Run, black devil, and catch white devil! Run, black devil, and catch white devil!" and was highly diverted. But this proved a serious adventure to the white devil, as he expired within a few minutes after he had reached his own house; and from that time poor Molly was left alone to sleep in peace.</P>
<P>About ten years after the above affair, at Wilkscome, nine miles from Taunton, a gentleman farmer's house was alarmed every night between twelve and one o'clock. The chamber doors were thrown open, the bed cloaths pulled off the beds, and the kitchen furniture thrown with violence about the kitchen, to the great terror of the family, insomuch that the servants gave their master and mistress warning to leave their places, and some of them actually quitted their service. This dreadful affair had lasted about six weeks, when a young gentleman who was there on a visit, being in bed one night, at the usual hour he heard his chamber door thrown open, and a
<PB N="27" REF="58"/>
very odd noise about his room. He was at first frightened, but the noise continuing a long time, he became calm and laid still, revolving what he had best do. When on a sudden he heard the spirit creep under his bed, which was immediately lifted up, &amp;c. This convinced him that there was some substance in the spirit; on which he leaped out of bed and secured the door, and with his oaken staff belaboured the ghost under the bed as hard as he could, until he heard a female voice imploring for mercy. On that he opened his chamber door, and called aloud for a light. The family all got up as fast as possible, and came to his room. He then informed them that he had got the spirit under the bed; on hearing which, most of them were terribly frightened, and would have run off faster than they came, but he assured them, they had nothing to fear: then out he dragged the half-murdered spirit from under the bed. But how great was their surprise and shame, when
<PB N="28" REF="59"/>
they discovered that this tormenting devil was no other than one of their servant girls, about sixteen years of age, who had been confined to her bed several months by illness.</P>
<P>This ghost was no sooner laid, than two o∣thers alarmed the neighbourhood; one of which for a long time shook a house every night, and terribly distressed the family; at length they all resolved one night to go over the whole house in a body, and see what it was that so agitated the building. They examined every room; but in vain, as no cause could be discovered. So they very seriously as well as unanimously concluded, that it must be <HI>the devil.</HI></P>
<P>But about a fortnight after this, one of the family being out late in the garden, saw a great boy get in at the window of an old house next door, (part of which was in ruins) and soon after the house began to shake as usual, on which the family went out of their own habitation and entered the old house where the boy was seen to get in; yet for a long
<PB N="29" REF="60"/>
time they could not discover any person, and were just turning to come out again, when one of the company observed the boy over their head, striding over the end of a large beam that ran across both houses.</P>
<P>It was then apparent that the violent agi∣tation of the adjoining house was occasioned by nothing more than his leaping up and down on the unsupported end of this beam.</P>
<P>Another apparition had for a long time stole many geese, turkeys, &amp;c. and although it had been seen by many, yet nobody would ven∣ture to go near it: until at length one per∣son a little wiser than the rest of his neigh∣bours, seeing the famous apparition all over white stealing his fowls, was determined to be fully satisfied what kind of spirit it could be that had so great a predilection for poultry. He accordingly went round the yard, and as the apparition was coming over the wall, he knock∣ed it down, and found that this terrible ghost was a neighbouring woman, who had put on her shroud, in order to deter any persons should
<PB N="30" REF="61"/>
they by chance see her, from coming near her. Thus, though she had for a long time success∣fully practised this new way of procuring poul∣try, the old fox was caught at last.</P>
<P>This is so prolific a subject, that I could fill many pages with relations of dreadful spectres, which for a while have reigned with tyrannic sway over weak minds, and at length when calm Reason was suffered to assume its power, they have been discovered to be no more ob∣jects of terror than those I have here noticed. But doubtless many such instances must have occurred to you.</P>
<P>It has indeed often astonished me, that in this enlightened age, there should yet remain numbers, not in the country only, but even in the Metropolis, who suffer themselves to be made miserable by vain fears of preter∣natural occurrences, which generally owe their origin to the knavery of some ill-disposed per∣son, who has a sinister purpose to answer there∣by, or to the foolish desire of alarming the
<PB N="31" REF="62"/>
minds of weak people: a practice sometimes (though intended as <HI>fun</HI>) productive of very serious consequences. Now and then, indeed, these terrors are owing to accident and ridicu∣lous causes. As an instance, I shall give you the account of a terrible alarm which some years since took place in an Hospital of this city, as related to me by a Gentleman then resident in the house, who was compleating his Medical education, and on whose veracity I can confidently rely.</P>
<P>For several nights successively, a noise had been heard in the lower part of the building; like the continual tapping against a window; which led the night nurses <HI>wisely</HI> to conclude it must certainly be occasioned by the Spirit of one of the bodies deposited in the dead-house, wishing to make its escape that way, the sound seeming to proceed from that particular quar∣ter. The dread of these <HI>sagacious ladies</HI> at last became such, as totally to prevent their going from ward to ward to do their duty,
<PB N="32" REF="63"/>
and determined my friend to attempt to lay this perturbed spirit; which however he apprehended would more speedily, as well as effectually be performed by the assistance of a good cudgel, than by any exorcisms; he therefore instead of consulting the Chap∣lain, gave orders the next night as soon as the usual <HI>dreadful sound</HI> was heard, to give him notice. This you may suppose they did not neglect doing, though at the same time they were shocked at his temerity, and appre∣hensive for the consequences. He immediately sallied forth, with a candle in one hand, and a good tough twig in the other, accompanied by two of the men servants of the Hospital, ac∣coutred in the same manner. The dead-house was passed; the noise continued; though it evi∣dently proceeded from a window at some dis∣tance in the area. When the cavalcade came near the scene of action, the window suddenly and violently broke, without any thing being seen. This my friend confessed, for a moment
<PB N="33" REF="64"/>
occasion his making a halt; but as nothing vi∣sible had escaped through the area, it occurred to him something might have made an entrance that way: accordingly he proceeded to the internal part of the building, and on opening the door, the apparition immediately not only appeared, but disappeared, and that so instan∣taneously as not to afford time to apply the remedy intended. And what, think you, was this dreadful spirit? That you may exercise your ingenuity at guessing, I will here con∣clude, with, Dear Friend,</P>

<P>During the time that I lived with the Baker, my name became so celebrated for selling a large number of pies, puddings, &amp;c. that for several years following, application
<PB N="35" REF="66"/>
was made to my father, for him to permit me to sell almanacks a few market days before and after Christmas. In this employ I took great delight, and the country people were highly pleased with me, and bought a great number of my Almanacks, which excited envy in the itinerant venders of Moore, Wing, Poor Robin, &amp;c. to such a degree, that my father often expressed his anxiety lest they should some way or other do me a mischief. But I had not the least concern, for as I had a light pair of heels, I always kept at a proper distance.</P>

<P>I was fourteen years and a half old, when I went with my father to work at Taunton, seven miles from Wellington. We had been there about a fortnight, when my father in∣formed our master, George Bowden, that he would return to Wellington again. Mr. Bowden was then pleased to inform my fa∣ther that he had taken a liking to me, and advised him to bind me an apprentice to him, I seconded Mr. Bowden's motion (as I had a better prospect in continuing with Mr. Bow∣den
<PB N="37" REF="68"/>
than in returning to Wellington with my father) and as he offered to take me without any premium and to find me in every thing, my father accepted his offer, and I was im∣mediately bound an apprentice for seven years to Mr. George and Mrs Mary Bowden, as honest and worthy a couple as ever carried on a trade.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the time that I was bound an Ap∣prentice, my Master had two sons, the eldest about seventeen years old, the youngest fourteen. The eldest had just been baptized, and introduced as a member of the dipping Community where my master and his family attended. The boy was a very sober indus∣trious youth, and gave his father and mother much pleasure. The youngest was also a good lad. Thus every thing continued well for some time after I had been added to the fami∣ly. Both of the boys had very good natural parts, and had learned to read, write, keep ac∣counts,
<PB N="40" REF="71"/>
&amp;c. But they had been at schools where no variety of books had been introduc∣ed; so that all they had read was the Bible: My master's whole library consisted of a school-size Bible, Watts's Psalms and Hymns, Foot's Tract on Baptism, Culpepper's Herbal, The History of Gentle Craft, an old im∣perfect volume of Receipts in Physic, Sur∣gery, &amp;c. and the Ready Reckoner. The ideas of the family were as circumscribed as their Library; my Master called attention to business and working hard, <HI>minding "the main-chance."</HI> On Sundays all went to meet∣ing. My Master, on that day, said a short grace before dinner, and the boys read a few chapters in the Bible, took a walk for an hour or two, then read a chapter or two more, supped, and went early to bed, perfectly sa∣tisfied with having done their duty; and each having a quiet conscience soon fell into the Arms of
<Q>"Tir'd nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep."</Q>
<PB N="41" REF="72"/>
I cannot here omit mentioning a very singular custom of my master's. Every morning, at all seasons of the year, and in all weathers, he rose about three o'clock, took a walk by the river's side round Trenchware fields, stopt at some place or other to drink half a pint of ale, came back before six o'clock and called up his people to work, and went to bed again about seven.</P>
<P>Thus was the good man's family jogging easily and quietly on; no one doubting but he should go to heaven when he died, and every one hoping it would be a good while first.</P>
<P>But alas! the dreadful crisis was at hand, that put an end to the happiness and peace of this little family. I had been an apprentice about twelve or fifteen months, when my master's eldest son George happened to go and hear a sermon preached by one of Mr. Wes∣ley's Preachers, who had left the plow-tail to preach the <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>unadultered</HI> Gospel of Christ. By this sermon the fallow
<PB N="42" REF="73"/>
ground of poor George's heart was harrowed up, he was now persuaded that the innocent and good life he had led would only sink him deeper into hell: in short he found out that he had never been converted, and of course was in a state of damnation, without benefit of Clergy. But he did not long con∣tinue in this damnable state, but soon became one of those
<Q><L>"—Errant Saints, whom all men grant</L>
<L>"To be the true Church militant."</L>
<BIBL>Butler.</BIBL></Q>
He persuaded himself that he had passed through the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and was quite sure that his name was registered in the Book of Life, and (to the great grief of his parents) he was become a <HI>new creature.</HI></P>
<P>George had no sooner made things sure for himself, than he began to extend his concern to his father, mother, brother, and me; and very kindly gave us to understand, that he was sure we were in a very deplorable state,
<PB N="43" REF="74"/>
"without hope, and without God in the world," being under the curse of the Law. In the long winter nights, as we sat at work together, he proved (in his way) that every man had original sin enough to damn a thou∣sand souls; and a deal was said on that sub∣ject: Quotations were made from some <HI>deep</HI> author who had asserted, that there were "infants in hell but a span long;" and that "Hell was paved with infant sculls," &amp;c. As to Morality, George assured us it was of no avail; that as for good works, they were only splendid sins; and that in the best good work that any creature could perform, there was sin enough to sink the doer to the nether∣most hell: That it was <HI>Faith</HI> alone that did every thing, without a grain of morality; but that no man could have one particle of this mysterious Faith, before he was justified; and that <HI>justification</HI> was a sudden opera∣tion on the soul, by which the most execrable wretch that ever lived might instantaneously
<PB N="44" REF="75"/>
be assured of all his sins being pardoned; that his body from that very moment became the living temple of the Holy Ghost, that he had fellowship with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and that Spirit was to be their constant and infallible guide: and that
<Q><L>"Whate'er men speak by this new light,</L>

<L>"As through a trunk, or whispering hole,</L>
<L>"Such language as no mortal ear</L>
<L>"But spiritu'l eaves-droppers can hear."</L></Q></P>
<P>My master very seldom heard any of these conversations, but my good mistress would sit down for hours together, with her bible in her lap, from which she would read such scriptures as proved the necessity of living a
<PB N="45" REF="76"/>
good life, performing good works, &amp;c. she also did her best to confute the tenets of Ori∣ginal sin, Imputed righteousness, doctrine of the Trinity. &amp;c. &amp;c. Unfortunately the good woman had no great talents for controversy; however, George had a very tenacious memo∣mory, and employed all his thoughts on these subjects, so that John his younger brother, and I also (two competent judges no doubt) thought that he had the best of the arguments on these edifying subjects, and about five months after George's conversion John went to hear those only true Ambassadors from Heaven,
<Q><L>"Who stroll and teach from town to town,</L>
<L>"The good old Cause: which some believe</L>
<L>"To be the devil that tempted Eve</L>
<L>"With knowledge, and do still invite</L>
<L>"The world to mischief with new light."</L>
<BIBL>Butler.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>These devil-dodgers happened to be so very <HI>powerful</HI> (that is very noisy,) that they soon
<PB N="46" REF="77"/>
sent John home, crying out, he should be damn'd! he should be damn'd for ever!</P>
<P>But John soon got out of the damnable state, and assured us that all his sins were forgiven, that he had passed from death into life, and had union and communion with God. He now became as merry as before he had been sorrowful, and sung in Mr. Wesley's strain,
<Q><L>"Not a doubt shall arise.</L>
<L>"To darken the skies,</L>
<L>"Nor hide for a moment my God from my Eyes."</L></Q>
John sung to me, and said to me a deal in this wonderful stile, of which I did not compre∣hend one syllable. But these extraordinary accounts and discourses, together with the controversies between the mother and the sons, made me think that they knew many matters of which I was totally ignorant. This creat∣ed in me a desire for knowledge, that I might know who was right, and who was wrong.
<PB N="47" REF="78"/>
But to my great mortification, I could not read. I knew most of the letters, and a few easy words, and I set about learning with all my might. My mistress would sometimes instruct me; and having three-halfpence per week allowed me by my mother, this money I gave to John (my master's youngest son) and for every three-halfpence he taught me to spell one hour. And this was done in the dark, as we were not allowed a candle, after we were sent upstairs to bed.</P>
<P>I soon made a little progress in reading; and in the mean time I also went to the Method∣ist meeting, to hear one Thomas Bryant, known in Taunton by the name of the <HI>dam∣nation preacher</HI>; (he had just left off cobling <HI>soles</HI> of another kind.) His sermon fright∣ened me most terribly. I soon after went to hear an old Scotchman; and he assured his congregation, that they would be damn'd, and double damn'd, and treble damn'd, and damn'd for ever, if they died without what he called
<PB N="48" REF="79"/>
<HI>Faith.</HI> This marvellous doctrine and noisy rant and enthusiasm, soon worked on my pas∣sions, and made me believe myself to be really in the damnable condition that they repre∣sented: and in this miserable state I continued for about a month, being all that time unable to work myself up to the proper key. At last, by singing and repeating enthusiastic amorous hymns, and presumptuously applying particular texts of scripture, I got my imagi∣nation to the proper pitch, was born again in an instant, became a very great favourite of heaven, and was as familiar with the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as any old woman in Mr. Wesley's connection.</P>

<P>THE enthusiastic notions which I had im∣bibed, and the desire I had to be talking about religious mysteries, &amp;c. answered one valuable purpose; as it caused me to embrace every opportunity to learn to read; so that I could soon read the easy parts of the Bible, Mr. Wesley's Hymns, &amp;c. and every leisure minute was so employed.</P>
<P>In the winter I was obliged to attend my work from six in the morning until ten at
<PB N="50" REF="81"/>
night. In the summer half year, I only worked as long as we could see without can∣dle; but notwithstanding the close attention I was obliged to pay to my trade, yet for a long time I read ten chapters in the Bible every day, I also read and learned many hymns, and as soon as I could procure some of Mr. Wesley's Tracts, Sermons, &amp;c. I read them also; many of them I perused in <HI>Cloa∣cina's</HI> Temple, (the place where my Lord Chesterfield advised his son to read the clas∣sics.) But I did not apply them after reading to the farther use that his Lordship hints at.)</P>
<P>I had such good eyes, that I often read by the light of the Moon, as my master would ne∣ver permit me to take a candle into my room, and that prohibition I looked upon as a kind of persecution, but I always comforted myself with the thoughts of my being a child of God; and as such, that it was impossible for me to escape persecution from the children of the devil, which I very piously applied to my
<PB N="51" REF="82"/>
good master and mistress. And so ignorantly and imprudently zealous was I for the good of their <HI>precious</HI> souls, as sometimes to give them broad hints of it, and of the dangerous state they were in. Their pious good old minister, the Reverend Mr. Harrison, I called <HI>"a blind leader of the blind;"</HI> and I once assured my mistress, that both he and his whole flock were in a state of damnation, being "strang∣ers to the hope of Israel, and without God in the world." My good mistress wisely thought that a good stick was the best way of arguing with such an ignorant infatuated boy as I was, and had often recourse to it; but I took care to give her a deal of trouble; for whenever I was ordered in my turn to read in the Bible, I always selected such chapters as I thought militated against Arians, Socinians, &amp;c. and such verses as I deemed favourable to the doc∣trine of Original Sin, Justification by Faith, imputed Righteousness, the doctrine of the Trinity, &amp;c. On such parts I always placed
<PB N="52" REF="83"/>
a particular emphasis, which puzzled and teazed the old lady a good deal.</P>
<P>Among other places I thought that the six∣teenth chapter of Ezekiel very much favoured the doctrines of original sin, imputed righte∣ousness, &amp;c. and that chapter I often selected and read to her, and she as often read the eighteenth chapter of the same prophecy, for the sake of the parable of the Father's eating <HI>sour grapes.</HI></P>
<P>As often as I read in St. Paul's Epistles on justification by faith alone, my good mistress would read in the Epistle of St. James, such passages as say that a man is not justified by faith alone, but by faith and works, which often embarassed me not a little. However I comforted myself with the conceit of having more texts of Scripture on my side of the question than she had on her side. As to St. James, I was almost ready to conclude, that he was not quite orthodox, and so I did not much mind what he said.</P>
<Q><PB N="53" REF="84"/>
<L>"—False opinions rooted in the mind,</L>
<L>"Hoodwink the soul and keep our reason blind.</L>
<L>"In controverted points can reason sway,</L>
<L>"When passion or conceit hurries us away?"</L></Q>
<P>Hitherto I had not frequented the metho∣dist meetings by the consent or knowledge of my master and mistress; nor had my zeal been so great as to make me openly violate their commands. But my zeal increased much faster than my knowledge, and I soon disre∣garded their orders, and without hesitation ran away to hear a methodistical sermon as often as I could find opportunity. One Sun∣day morning at eight o'clock my mistress see∣ing her sons set off, and knowing that they were gone to a methodist meeting, determined to prevent me from doing the same by locking the door, which she accordingly did; on which, in a superstitious mood, I opened the Bible for direction what to do, (ignorant methodists often practise the same presumptuous method) and the first words I read were these. "He has giv∣en his angels charge concerning thee, lest at
<PB N="54" REF="85"/>
any time thou shouldest dash thy foot against a stone." This was enough for me. So without a moment's hesitation, I ran up two pair of stairs to my room, and out of the window I leap∣ed, to the great terror of my poor mistress. I got up immediately, and ran about two or three hundred yards, towards the meeting-house; but alas! I could run no farther; my feet and ancles were most intolerably bruised, so that I was obliged to be carried back and put to bed; and it was more than a month before I recovered the use of my limbs. I was igno∣rant enough to think, (I mention it with horror and remorse!) that the Lord had not used me very well, and resolved not to put so much trust in him for the future.</P>
<P>This rash adventure of mine made a great noise in the town, and was talked of many miles round. Some few admired my amazing strength of faith, but the major part pitied me, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a poor ignorant, deluded and infatuated boy; which did not at all please,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the fourth year of my apprenticeship, my master died, and although he was a good husband, a good father, and a good master, &amp;c. yet as he had not the methodistical faith, and could not pronounce the <HI>Shibboleth</HI> of that sect, I <HI>piously</HI> feared that he was gone to hell.</P>
<P>As I had been bound to my mistress as well as my master, I was of course an apprentice still. But after my master's death I obtained more liberty of conscience, (as I called it) so
<PB N="56" REF="87"/>
that I not only went to hear the methodist sermons, but was also admitted into their So∣ciety: and I believe they never had a more devout enthusiastical member; so that for several years I regularly attended every ser∣mon, as well as all their private meetings.</P>
<P>As you are probably unacquainted with the nature of their private meetings, a short account of them may perhaps afford you some amusement.</P>
<P>The late Mr. Wesley instituted amongst his people, besides the public preachings, several kinds of private meetings; and as the <HI>prayer-meeting</HI> is the least private of any of them, I will first take notice of that.</P>
<P>To the prayer-meetings they often invited people who were not of their society; an hymn was first sung, and then they all knelt, and the first person that felt a motion, made an extemporary prayer, when he had done ano∣ther began, and so on, for about two hours.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="88"/>But it so happened sometimes, that one of the brethren began to pray without having <HI>the gift</HI> of prayer (as they call it), and then he often stuck fast, like some of the young orators at Coach-maker's Hall, &amp;c. Prayer-meetings were held in such high esteem a∣mongst them that they asserted, more were <HI>"born again,"</HI> and more <HI>"made free</HI> from all the remains of sin," or in other words of their own, "made <HI>perfect</HI> as God is perfect," in these kinds of meeting, than at public preaching, &amp;c. Thus, as Pomfret says,
<Q>"The spirits heated will strange things produce."</Q></P>
<P>But 'tis impossible for you, my friend, to form any just idea of these assemblies, except you had been present at them: one wheedles and coaxes the Divine Being, in his addresses; another is amorous and luscious; and a third so rude and commanding, he will even tell the Deity that he must be <HI>a liar</HI> (dreadful!) if he does not grant all they ask. In this manner will they work up one another's imaginations until
<PB N="58" REF="89"/>
they may actually be said to be in a state of intoxication.</P>
<P>They have another kind of private meeting after the publick preaching on Sunday even∣ings, in which the preacher meets all the members of the society, who stay behind after the general congregation is dismissed. To this society Mr. Wesley gave such advice as he deemed better suited to a godly few than to a promiscuous multitude of <HI>"outward court</HI> worshippers."</P>
<P>Their <HI>Love-feast</HI> is also a private meeting of as many members of the community as please to attend; and they generally come from all parts, within several miles of the place where love-feasts are held.</P>
<P>When all are met they alternately sing and pray; and such amongst them as think that their <HI>experience</HI> (as they call it) is remarka∣ble, stand up in their place and relate all the transactions between God, the devil, and their souls. At such seasons as this I have
<PB N="59" REF="90"/>
heard many of them declare they had just received the pardon of all their sins, while Brother such-a-one was in prayer; another would then get up and assert that he was just at that instant made perfectly free from sin; and then the Spirit is supposed to be very powerfully at work amongst them; and such a <HI>unison</HI> of sighing and <HI>groaning</HI> succeeds, that you would think they had all lost their senses.</P>
<P>In the Love-feast they have <HI>buns</HI> to eat, which are mutually broken between each brother and sister, and they have also <HI>water</HI> to drink, which they hand from one to ano∣ther. These meetings begin about seven o'clock and last until nine, or after.</P>
<P>In London, Bristol, and other large places, they have some <HI>private</HI> meetings, unknown to the community at large. These meetings consist of all married men at one time, young and unmarried men at another time: the mar∣ried women by themselves, and the single women by themselves; and to each of these
<PB N="60" REF="91"/>
classes Mr. Wesley went, and gave such advice or exhortations as he thought suitable to their situation in life, seldom failing to speak much in praise of celibacy, to the <HI>Maids</HI> and <HI>Batche∣lors</HI> under his pastoral care, &amp;c. I will in my next give you an account of their watch-nights, class-meetings, bands, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>Watch-night</HI> begins about seven o'clock. They sing hymns, pray, preach, sing, and pray again; then exhort, sing and pray alternately, until twelve o'clock; and then they depart in peace, according to the word.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="93"/>Mr. Wesley, in every place where his peo∣ple were numerous, had divided them into <HI>classes,</HI> consisting of twelve or fourteen bro∣thers or sisters. Sometimes men and women met together in the same <HI>class,</HI> (as they called it) and other classes consisted of all men or all women. Each of these classes had one in it who was called the <HI>leader.</HI> In such classes where men and women meet together, the leader was always a brother: and so of course when the class consisted of men alone. But in the womens classes a Sister was always the leader.</P>
<P>When they met together, the Leader first gave out an hymn, which they all sang: after the hymn they all kneeled down, and their leader made an extemporary prayer; after which they were seated, and when the leader had informed them of the state of his own mind, he enquired of all present, one after another, how they found the state of their souls. Some he found were full of faith
<PB N="63" REF="94"/>
and <HI>assurance,</HI> others had dreadful doubts and fears; some had horrid temptations; others complained of a lukewarm state, &amp;c. To each of these the leader gave a word of com∣fort, or of correction in the best manner he was able. They then sang and prayed again. This lasted about one hour. And every one in Mr. Wesley's connexion did, or was expect∣ed to meet, each in his own class once in a week. In these classes each made a weekly contribution towards the general support of the preachers, &amp;c. Such as were very poor contributed a penny per week, others two-pence, and some who could afford it sixpence. This money was entered in a book kept for that purpose, and one in every class called the Steward, had the care of the cash.</P>
<P>I now come to speak of the <HI>Bands,</HI> which consisted only of <HI>justified</HI> persons; that is such as had received the <HI>assurance</HI> of their sins being pardoned. In the classes, both the <HI>awakened</HI> (as they call them) and the justi∣fied,
<PB N="64" REF="95"/>
and even those that were made <HI>perfect,</HI> met all together, as did the married and the single, and often men and women. But none were admitted into any <HI>band</HI> but such as were at least in a justified state, and the married of each sex met by themselves, and the single by themselves. About Ten was the number generally put in one Band; all these must belong to and meet in some Class, once a week, when not hindered by sickness, &amp;c. and they were also to meet weekly in their Band. When met, they first sung, then made a short prayer: that done, the <HI>Band-leader</HI> informed them of the state of his mind during the last week, &amp;c. He then made inquiry in∣to the state of all present, and each related what had passed since they last met; as what visitations they had received from God, what temptations from the devil, the flesh, &amp;c. And it is a maxim amongst them, that by exposing to one another what the devil has particularly tempted them to commit will
<PB N="65" REF="96"/>
make the old fellow more careful how he tempts, when he knows that all his secrets will be told the next meeting.</P>
<P>The last time I met in band was in Lon∣don; where an old man (near seventy years of age) informed us that he had for several weeks together laboured under a very griev∣ous temptation of the devil, who all this time had been constantly tempting of him to commit adultery; he farther informed us, that having let too much of his house to lodgers, they were obliged to put the maid's bed in the room where he and his wife slept; and that one morning he had seen the maid lying asleep, nearly or quite uncovered, and he again assured us that ever since that time the devil had been every day tempting him to do that which was nought with the maid. I could not help thinking the old gentleman was right in charging it on <HI>the devil,</HI> as there was little reason to think it was any tempta∣tion of <HI>the flesh.</HI> Permit me to add, that this
<PB N="66" REF="97"/>
old Buck had a wife about half his own age. By this time I suppose you have had enough of <HI>band-meetings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Wesley instituted another kind of pri∣vate meeting for the highest order of his peo∣ple, called the <HI>select bands</HI>; to which none were admitted but such as were sanctified, or made perfect in love, and freed from all the remains of sin. But as I never professed <HI>per∣fection,</HI> I was not permitted to enter into this holy of holies.</P>
<P>Four times every year new <HI>Tickets</HI> are dis∣tributed to all Mr. Wesley's people through∣out the three kingdoms. Their ticket is a very small slip of paper, with a text of scrip∣ture on it, which is exchanged every quarter for some other text. Such as are only in a <HI>class,</HI> have a different text from such as are in a <HI>band,</HI> so that no one can be admitted into any general meeting of the bands, appointed by any of the preachers when he intends to give them an exhortation, nor into any
<PB N="67" REF="98"/>
particular band, by a common society ticket. On the common tickets are such texts as these: "Now is the accepted time"— "Awake thou that sleepest," and such like. But those for the <HI>bands</HI> are in a higher strain; as, "Be ye perfect as your heavenly father is perfect"—or, "Go on unto perfection"—Ye are children of the light"—"Your bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost;" and other texts of a similar tendency.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU now see what sort of a Society I was got into. In country places particular∣ly, they consist of farmers, husbandmen, shoemakers, woolcombers, weavers, their wives, &amp;c. I have heard Mr. Wesley remark that more Women are converted than men; and I believe that by far the greatest part of his people are females; and not a few of them sour, disappointed old maids, with some o∣thers of a less prudish disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="100"/>There are thousands in this Society who will never read any thing besides the Bible, and books published by Mr. Wesley. For several years I read very little else, nor would I go (at least very seldom) to any other place of worship; so that instead of hearing the sensi∣ble and learned ministers of Taunton, I would often go four, five, or seven miles, to some country village, to hear an inspired husband∣man, shoemaker, blacksmith, woolcomber, &amp;c. And frequently in frost and snow have I rose a little after midnight (not knowing what time of night it was) and have wan∣dered about the town until five o'clock, when the preaching began; where I have often heard a sermon preached to not more than ten or a dozen people. But such of us as did attend at this early hour, used afterwards to congratulate each other on the great privilege we enjoyed, then off we went to our work, shivering with cold.</P>
<P>I was first converted to methodism when I
<PB N="70" REF="101"/>
was about sixteen years of age, and from that time until I was twenty-one, I was a very sin∣cere enthusiast, and every spare hour I enjoyed I dedicated to the study of the Bible, reading methodistical books, learning hymns, hearing sermons, meeting in Societies, &amp;c. My me∣mory was very tenacious, so that every thing I read I made my own. I could have repeated several volumes of hymns; when I heard a sermon, I could have preached it again, and nearly in the same words; my bible had hun∣dreds of leaves folded down, and thousands of marks against such texts as I thought favour∣ed the doctrines (or whims) which I had im∣bibed. So that I stood forth as the champion of methodism wherever I came.</P>
<P>But alas! my godly strict life soon suffered interruption.</P>
<P>The election for two members of Parlia∣ment was strongly contested at Taunton, just as I attained my twenty-first year; and being now of age, the six or seven months, which
<PB N="71" REF="102"/>
I had to serve of my apprenticeship were pur∣chased of my mistress by some friends of two of the contending candidates; so that I was at once set free in the midst of a scene of riot and dissipation.</P>
<P>As I had a vote, and was also possessed of a few ideas above those of my rank and situation, my company was courted by some who were in a much higher sphere; and (probably what they partly intended) in such company I soon forgot my godly or method∣istical connections, and ran into the opposite extreme: so that for several months most of my spare hours were devoted to the
<Q><L>"Young-eyed God of Wine! Parent of joys!</L>
<L>"Frolic and full of thee, while the cold sons</L>
<L>"Of temperance, the fools of thought and care,</L>
<L>"Lay stretch'd in sober slumbers."</L>
<BIBL>Mallet's Eurydice.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Here I had like to have sunk forever into meanness, obscurity and vice; for when the Election was over, I had no longer open houses to eat and drink in at free cost.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="103"/>However I did not sink quite so low as the commonality of journeymen shoemakers, but in general worked very hard, and spent my money in better company.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding, at times I was very un∣easy, and although I had not been at any methodistical meeting during the time that I had lived this dissipated life, yet my mind was not freed intirely from the superstitious fears I had there imbibed: so that whenever any person asked me, what would become of me (that had lived such an holy life) if I should die in the state of <HI>backsliding</HI> from the good old way?" I always acknowledged that I should be eternally damn'd, were that to be the case. But I must confess that I was not much afraid of dying in such a state, as I was too much prepossessed of the methodistical no∣tions of <HI>free-grace,</HI> that would not let me finally be lost. So that I waited as it were for a <HI>second call</HI> to repentance, justifica∣tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="104"/>I often privately took the bible to bed with me, and in the long summer mornings I read for hours together in bed. But this did not in the least influence my conduct.</P>
<P>I was twenty-one years of age the 11th of September 1767, the election was over the latter end of March 1768. It was in this year that my new master's wife insisted on my purchasing milk of a milk-maid that was a customer at the shop; which I refused to comply with, as I had a smart little milk∣maid of my own. But as my mistress wore the breeches, my master was obliged, by his wife's order, to inform me that I must comply with the commands of my mistress or get ano∣ther master. I left him without hesitation; and the same afternoon went to Wellington, to take leave of my father and mother, and to inform them of my intention to go to Bristol. I did so, and after two or three days I returned back to Taunton, where I stayed a day or two more. In which time I became enamoured
<PB N="74" REF="105"/>
with, or infatuated by the beautiful <HI>Nancy Trott</HI>: and although I saw the impropriety of the measure, yet I could not resist the fair tempter, who prevailed with me to permit her to accompany me in my journey.</P>

<P>We rested a week in Bridgewater, where I worked and got money to convey us to Ex∣bridge, seventeen miles on this side Bristol; and there I saw my conduct in such a point of view as made me resolve to leave her.

My finances amounted to three shillings and one penny, out of which I gave her half-a-crown,
<PB N="75" REF="106"/>
and with the remaining seven-pence, without informing her of my purpose, I set off for Bristol; where I arrived in a few hours, and got work the same evening.</P>
<P>A few days after, I went to the inn where the Taunton carrier put up, to enquire after Miss Trott, as I wanted to know if she had returned safe to Taunton. But I was inform∣ed that she was in Bristol nearly as soon as I was, and as I knew but little of the world, and very little of women of her description, I was quite unhappy on her account, for fear that being in a strange place, she might be in want and distress; which thought induced me to offer to several of my countrymen, five shillings to the first who should bring me an account where I might find her; but I did not see her until several weeks after that.</P>
<P>The Taunton carrier gave me a letter from my good Mistress Bowden, (who by marry∣ing again had changed her name to Dingle.) The contents of this letter very much sur∣prised
<PB N="76" REF="107"/>
me. It informed me that a day or two before I fell out with my last mistress, (which was the trifling cause of my leaving Taunton) Betty Tucker, a common lass, had sworn a child to me; that the parish officers had been to my master's shop, within an hour after I had left it to go to Wellington, and that they had been at Wellington just as I had, lef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that place, and afterwards hearing that I was in Bridgewater they had pursued me there. But the morning on which they arrived there, I had set off for Exbridge; and believing that I had intentionally fled before them, they had given over the chase for the present.</P>
<P>Reflecting on this affair, although my con∣duct was so far from entitling me to any par∣ticular favour from heaven, yet I was then weak enough to imagine that a kind of mira∣cle had been wrought to save me from a pri∣son, or from marrying a woman that I could not bear the idea of living a single week with; and as I had not any knowledge of her being
<PB N="77" REF="108"/>
with child (not having seen her for three months before) I had not taken any measure to avoid the consequence, but put myself in the way of the officers: For, as I have just told you, after I had taken leave of my father and mother, I went back to Taunton, and walked about publickly one whole day, and part of another.</P>
<P>This girl was delivered about two months afterwards of a still-born child, so that I was never troubled for expences. Methinks you are ready to say with Pomfret:
<Q><L>"'Tis easy to descend into the snare,</L>
<L>"By the pernicious conduct of the Fair:</L>
<L>"But safely to return from their abode</L>
<L>"Requires the wit, the prudence of a God."</L></Q>
This recalls to my mind a ridiculous affair, which excited much mirth in that part of the country.</P>
<P>During the Election at Taunton, a Gentle∣man one day came in a post-chaise to the White-hart Inn, kept by Mr. Bowren, and after having refreshed himself, strolled into
<PB N="78" REF="109"/>
the yard, and seeing the hostler, asked him if he could inform him where they took in the <HI>news</HI>? The hostler understanding him in a li∣teral sense, directed him to a Bookseller's shop on the opposite side of the way: this shop was kept by Miss A—d—n, a beautiful young lady of irreproachable character, and one whose fine understanding and polished taste did ho∣nour to the profession.</P>
<P>Our gentleman on entering the shop enquir∣ed of the shopmaid for her mistress: but the maid being used to serve in the shop, and knowing that her mistress had some ladies with her, informed the gentleman that she could help him to any thing that he wanted. But on his saying he had some private busi∣ness with her mistress, he was shewed into a back parlour, and the mistress being in∣formed that a gentleman in the back parlour wanted to speak to her, she went directly to him. The moment she entered the room, he clasped her in his arms, called her a divine
<PB N="79" REF="110"/>
creature, &amp;c. This so alarmed miss A—d—n, that she screamed aloud: on hearing of which the ladies, preceeded by the housemaid and shopmaid repaired to the parlour, where they found miss A—d—n almost in fits. The gen∣tleman thinking that it was only a trick to raise her price, took but little notice: on which one of the maids ran out and called in several of the neighbours, who on coming into the parlour, saw with astonishment our Sir Harry Wildair taking improper liberties with Miss A—d—n, and desired him to desist. But he desired them not to attempt to put tricks on travellers, and ordered them to leave the room. Instead of quitting the room, they in a resolute tone ordered our spark to go instantly about his business. However he still kept his ground, until the mayor of the town, who happened to live just by, was called in. Mr. Mayor demanded to know why he took such freedom with the lady? Our gentle∣man, seeing that the affair began to look very
<PB N="80" REF="111"/>
serious, now became calm, and informed the company that having an inclination for a fro∣lic, he had enquired for a bad house, and had been directed there; and added, that if there had been any mistake, he was very sorry for it, and would beg the lady's pardon. On hearing this, the company was more surprized than before, and demanded of the gentleman, who had informed him that that house was a bawd-house? He replied, The <HI>hostler</HI> at the White Hart. Upon this the hostler was sent for, and on his being asked, if he had directed that gentleman, to miss <HI>A—d—n's</HI> as to a bawd-house? The poor fellow, with marks of terror and surprise answered, "No. The Gentleman never asked me for a <HI>bawd-house,</HI> he only asked me for a house where they <HI>took in</HI> the <HI>news."</HI> So that the hostler's under∣standing him in a literal sense, caused all the confusion. The affair had got so much air that our spark was glad to leave the town immediately.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I TOOK a lodging in a street, called (I think) Castle-ditch, at the house of a Mr. <HI>James</HI>; a much genteeler residence, than com∣only falls to the lot of Journeymen Shoe∣makers.</P>
<P>In this house I found a Mr. John Jones, a genteel young man, just turned of twenty-one years of age: He was also a son of <HI>Crispin,</HI> and made women's stuff shoes; which he sold by the dozen to warehouses. This Mr. Jones and I were soon very intimate; we
<PB N="82" REF="113"/>
kept ourselves decently dressed, and in gene∣ral worked hard, spending our money chiefly in the company of women. As,
<Q><L>"All men have follies, which they blindly trace,</L>

<BIBL>Pomfret.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>We followed this course about four months. During this time Mr. Jones once persuaded me to go with him to the Playhouse, where we saw Shakespear's fine comedy of "As you like it." This was a feast indeed to me, who had never before seen nor read any theatrical production. Words are inadequate to describe my sensations on the occasion. Between the play and the entertainment, (which was the Mayor of Garrat) Mr. Edward Shuter per∣formed a short piece called, "The Drunken Man." This was the only time that I ever saw that extraordinary genius, but he made such an impression on my mind, that 'tis impossi∣ble I should ever forget him.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="114"/>It is singular enough, that about this time, although I could not write, yet I composed several songs, one of which was sold for a guinea, some were given to the Bristol Print∣ers, who printed them, and the ballad-singers sung them about the streets; on which oc∣casions I was as proud as though I had compo∣sed an opera. My friend Mr. Jones was my secretary, who before I came to live with him had not the least relish for books, and I had only read a few enthusiastic authors, and Pomfret's poems; this last I could almost re∣peat by memory; however I made the most of my little stock of literature, and strongly recommended the purchasing of books to Mr. Jones. But so ignorant were we on the sub∣ject, that neither of us knew what books were fit for our perusal, nor what to enquire for, as we had scarce ever heard or seen even any <HI>title-pages,</HI> except a few of the religious sort, which at that time we had no relish for. So that we were at a loss how to increase our
<PB N="84" REF="115"/>
small stock of science. And here I cannot help thinking, that had fortune thrown proper books into our way, we should soon have acquired a just taste for literature, and have made some tolerable progress, but such was our obscurity, that it was next to impossi∣ble for us ever to emerge from it.</P>
<P>As we could not tell what to ask for, we were ashamed to go into the booksellers shops, and I assure you, my friend, that there are thousands now in England in the very same situation; many, very many have come to my shop, who have discovered an enquiring mind, but have been totally at a loss what to ask for, having no friend to direct them.</P>

<P><PB N="85" REF="116"/>One day as my friend Jones and I were strolling about the fair that is annually held in and near St. James's church-yard, we saw a stall of books, and in looking over the title pages, I met with Hobbes's Translation of Homer. I had some how or other heard that Homer was a great Poet, but unfortunately I had never heard of Pope's translation of him, so we very eagerly purchased that by Hobbes. At this stall I also purchased Walker's Poeti∣cal paraphrase of Epictetus's morals; and home we went, perfectly well pleased with our bargains.</P>
<P>We that evening began with Hobbes's Ho∣mer; but found it very difficult for us to read, owing to the obscurity of the translation, which together with the indifferent language, and the want of poetical merit in the translator somewhat disappointed us: however we had from time to time many a hard puzzling hour with him.</P>
<P>But as to Walker's Epictetus, although it
<PB N="86" REF="117"/>
had not much poetical merit, yet it was very easy to be read, and as easily understood; and the principles of the <HI>Stoic</HI> charmed me so much, that I made the book my companion wherever I went, and read it over and over in raptures, thinking that my mind was secured against all the smiles or frowns of fortune.</P>
<P>I now began to think of employing my spare hours in something more satisfactory; and for want of something to do, I went one evening to hear Mr. John Wesley preach in Broad-mead, and as I was compleatly tired of the dissipated way of life I had lived (more or loss) ever since I had been out of my appren∣ticeship, and as I happened to have no other pursuit or hobby horse, there was a kind of va∣cuity in my mind: In this state I was very susceptible of any impressions, so that when I came to hear Mr. Wesley, my old fanatical notions returned full upon me, and I was once more carried away by the ride of enthusiasm.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="118"/>My friend Mr. Jones soon saw with grief and indignation the wonderful alteration in me, who from a gay, volatile, dissipated young fellow, was at once metamorphosed into a dull, moping, praying, psalm-singing fanatic, continually reprehending all about me for their harmless mirth and gaiety.

<P>About this time we left our habitation in Castle-ditch, and took lodgings of Mr. Jones's mother, on St. Philips Plain, where lived a Brother of Mr. Jones, who was about seven∣teen years of age. Soon after we had removed to this place, the Brother, whose name was Richard Jones, was permitted to work in the same room with my friend and me. They had also a sister about twenty years of age,
<PB N="88" REF="119"/>
who frequently joined our company.</P>
<P>Our room overlooked the Church-yard, which contributed to increase my gloomy ideas, and I hid so much of the spiritual quix∣otism in me, that I soon began to think that it was not enough for me to save my own Soul, but I ought in conscience to attempt the con∣version of my companions, who (I really be∣lieved) were in the high road to Hell, and eve∣ry moment liable to eternal damnation. And of this charitable disposition are almost all the methodists, who, as Hudibras says,
<Q><L>"Compound for sins they are inclin'd to</L>
<L>"By damning those they have no mind to."</L></Q>
The frequency of newly-opened graves, which we saw from our windows, furnished me with opportunities for descanting on the uncertain∣ty of life and all sublunary enjoyments, I as∣sured them that nothing deserved our atten∣tion but what related to our everlasting state; and that they might, on their repentance, re∣ceive in one moment the pardon of all their
<PB N="89" REF="120"/>
sins, have a foretaste of the joys of Heaven, and know their names were enrolled in the book of life. I farther protested that they had no time to lose; and they all stood on the very verge of hell, and the breaking-brink of eternal torments; and a great deal more of such edifying stuff.</P>
<P>The youngest brother soon became a con∣vert; and Miss Betsey was <HI>born again</HI> soon after. But I had a tight job to convert my friend John; he held out, and often cursed me heartily, and sung profane songs all day long.</P>
<P>But about four or five weeks after my re∣conversion, John was also converted, and be∣came a favourite of heaven, so that we consi∣dered ourselves as a holy community.</P>

<P>MR. John Jones and myself were now greater friends than ever, so that one would on no account stir out of the house without the other.</P>
<P>Mr. Jones had the advantage of me in tem∣porals, he could get more money than I could.
<PB N="91" REF="122"/>
But as to grace and spiritual gifts, I had much the advantage of all our community; so that I was their spiritual director, and if they thought that any of their acquaintance held any opinions that were not quite sound and orthodox, such were introduced to me, in or∣der that I might convince them of their errors. In fact I looked upon myself as an apostle, so that whatever I asserted was received as pure gospel; nor was any thing undertaken with∣out my advice.</P>
<P>We all worked very hard, particularly Mr. John Jones and me, in order to get money to purchase books; and for some months every shilling we could spare was laid out at old book-shops, stalls, &amp;c. insomuch that in a short time we had what <HI>we</HI> called a very good li∣brary. This choice collection consisted of Polhil on precious Faith; Polhil on the De∣crees; Shepherd's sound Believer; Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress; Bunyan's Good News for the vilest of Sinners; Bunyan's Heavenly
<PB N="92" REF="123"/>

Collings's Divine Cordial for the Soul; Pearse's Soul's Espousal to Christ; Erskine's Gospel Sonnets; The Death of Abel; The Faith of God's Elect; Manton on the epistle of St. James; Pamble's Works; Baxter's Shove for a <HI>heavy-a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed</HI> Christian; his Call to the Unconverted; Mary Magdalen's Funeral Tears; Mrs. Moore's Evidences for Heaven; Mead's Almost a Christian; The Three Steps to Heaven; Brooks on Assurance; God's Revenge against Murder; Heaven up∣on Earth; The Pathway to Heaven; Wil∣cox's Guide to eternal Glory; Derham's Un∣searchable Riches of Christ; his Exposition of

Revelations; Alleine's Sure guide to Heaven; The Sincere Convert; Watson's Heaven tak∣en by Storm; Heaven's Vengeance; Wall's None but Christ; Aristotle's Masterpiece; Coles on God's Sovereignty; Charnock on Providence; Young's Short and sure Guide to Salvation; Wesley's Sermons, Journals, Tracts, &amp;c. and others of the same descrip∣tion.</P>
<P>We had indeed a few of a better sort, as Gay's Fables; Pomfret's Poems; Milton's Paradise Lost; besides Hobbes's Homer, and Walker's Epictetus, mentioned in my former letter.</P>
<P>But what we wanted in judgment in choos∣ing our library, we made up in application; and so anxious were we to read a great deal, that we allowed ourselves but about three hours sleep in twenty-four, and for some months together we never were all in bed at the same time, (Sunday nights excepted). But lest we should oversleep the time allowed, one of
<PB N="94" REF="125"/>
us sat up to work until the time appointed for the others to rise, and when all were up, my friend John, and your humble servant, took it by turns to read aloud to the rest, while they were at their work.</P>
<P>But this mad scheme of ours had like to have been attended with very serious conse∣quences. One night it being my turn to watch; I removed to the fire-side, to read some particular passage, and the candlestick which we worked by not being convenient to move about, and there being no other at that time in the room, I set up the candle against the handle of a pewter pot, and was so extremely heavy (owing to much watch∣fulness) that I fell fast asleep and had liked never to have awaked again; for the candle burned down to the handle of the pot, melted it off, and then fell on the chair on which it stood; so that Mr. Jones found me in the morning, fast asleep, and part of the chair
<PB N="95" REF="126"/>
consumed; which alarmed us all very much, and made us more cautious.</P>
<P>But still we continued our plan of living, so that we made a rapid progress in what we called spiritual and divine knowledge; and were soon masters of the various arguments made use of by most polemical divines, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The better to guard my pupils from what I called <HI>false doctrines,</HI> I used often to engage them in various controversies in which I sometimes took one side of the question, some times the other, in order to make them well versed in controversy, and acquainted with the strength of their adversaries. So that I was by turns, a Calvinist, an Arminian, an Arian, a Socinian, a Deist, and even an Atheist. And after they had said all they could to confute me, I would point out where they had failed, adding such arguments as I was master of, and in general we were all satisfied. But when we happened to have any doubts, we had re∣course
<PB N="96" REF="127"/>
to the Bible and commentators of our own side of the question; and I assure you, my dear friend, this was a very fine hobby-horse, which like Aaron's serpent, swallowed up all the other hobby-horses,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the course of my reading, I learnt that there had been sects of Philosophers amongst the Greeks, Romans, &amp;c. and I well remem∣bered the names of the most eminent of them. At an old Book-shop I purchased Plato on the Immortality of the Soul, Plutarch's Morals, the Morals of Confucius the Chinese Philoso∣pher, and a few others. I now can scarce help thinking that I received more real benefit from reading and studying them and Epictetus than from all other Books that I had read be∣fore, or have read since that time.</P>
<P>I was but about twenty-two years of age, when I first began to read them, and I assure
<PB N="98" REF="129"/>
you, my friend, that they made a very deep and lasting impression on my mind. By reading them I was taught to bear the unavoidable evils attending humanity, and to supply all my wants by contracting or restraining my desires.</P>
<P>It is now twenty-three years since I first read them; during which time I do not recollect that I have ever felt one <HI>anxious</HI> painful wish to get money, estates, or any way to better my condition: and yet I have never since that time let slip any fair opportunity of doing it. So that all I mean is that I have not been <HI>over solicitous</HI> to obtain any thing that I did not possess; but could at all times say, with St. Paul, that I have learned to be contented in all situations, although at times they have been very gloomy indeed. Dryden says,
<Q><L>"We to ourselves may all our wishes grant,</L>

<P><PB N="99" REF="130"/>The pleasures of eating and drinking I en∣tirely despised, and for some time carried this disposition to an extreme. The account of Epicurus living in his garden, at the expence of about a halfpenny per day, and that when he added a little cheese to his bread on particular occasions, he considered it as a luxury, filled me with raptures. From that moment I began to live on bread and tea, and for a con∣siderable time did not partake of any other viand, but in that I indulged myself three or four times a day. My reasons for living in this abstemious manner were in order to save money to purchase Books, to wean myself from the gross pleasures of eating, drink∣ing, &amp;c. and to purge my mind, and make it more susceptible of intellectual pleasures. And here I cannot help remarking, that the term <HI>Epicure</HI> when applied to one that makes the pleasures of the table his chief good, casts an unjust reflection on <HI>Epicurus,</HI> and conveys a wrong idea of that contemplative and very
<PB N="100" REF="131"/>
abstemious philosopher: for although he assert∣ed that pleasure was the chief or supreme good, yet he also as strongly asserted, that it was the the tranquillity of the mind, and intellectual pleasure, that he so extolled and recommended.</P>

<P>I continued the above self-denying life un∣til I left Bristol, which was on Whitsunday in 1769. I had for some time before been pointing out to my friend John Jones some of the pleasures and advantages of travelling, so that I easily prevailed on him to accompa∣ny me towards the west of England; and in the evening we arrived at Bridgewater, where Mr. Jones got work. He was employed by Mr. Cash, with whom he continued near twelve months, and in the end married Mr. Cash's daughter, a very pretty and very amiable little
<PB N="101" REF="132"/>
woman, with some fortune. When my friend was offered work by Mr. Cash I prevailed on him to accept of it, by assuring him that I had no doubt of my being able to get work at Taunton. But in that I was disappointed, nor could I get a constant seat of work until I came to Exeter, and of that place I was soon tired; but being informed that a Mr. John Taylor of Kingsbridge (forty miles below Exeter) wanted such a hand, I went down and was gladly received by Mr. Taylor, whose name inspires me with gratitude, as he never treated me as a servant, but made me his com∣panion: Nor was any part of my time ever spent in a more agreeable pleasing manner than that which I passed in this retired place, or I believe more profitable to a master; I was the first man he ever had that was able to make Stuff and Silk Shoes, and it being also known that I came from Bristol, this had great weight with the country ladies, and procured my master customers, who generally
<PB N="102" REF="133"/>
sent for me to take measure of their feet, and I was looked upon by all to be the best work∣man in the Town, altho' I had not been brought up to Stuff-work, nor had ever en∣tirely made one Stuff of Silk Shoe before. Neither should I have presumed to proclaim myself a Stuff-man, had there been any such workmen in the place; but as there were none, I boldly ventured, and succeeded very well; nor did any one in the town ever know that it was my first attempt in that branch.</P>
<P>During the time that I lived here, I as usual was obliged to employ one or another of my acquaintance to write my letters for me; this procured me much praise among the young men as a good inditer of letters; (I need not inform you that they were not good judges) My master said to me one day, he was surprized that I did not learn to write my own letters, and added, that he was sure that I could learn to do it in a very short time. The thought pleased me much. Without any
<PB N="103" REF="134"/>
delay I set about it, by taking up pieces of paper that had any writing on them, and imi∣tating the letters as well as I could. I employ∣ed my leisure hours in this way for near two months, after which time I wrote my own letters, in a bad hand, you may be sure; but it was plain and easy to read, which was all I cared for: nor to the present moment can I write much better, as I never would have any person to teach me, nor was I ever possessed of patience enough to employ time sufficient to learn to write well; and yet as soon as I was able to scribble, I wrote verses on some trifle or other every day for years together.</P>
<P>But I always wrote as fast as I could, with∣out endeavouring to write well, and that this is my present practice I need not inform you.</P>
<P>I came to this place in but a weak state of body, however the healthy situation of the town, together with bathing in the salt water, soon restored me to perfect health. I passed thirteen months here in a very happy manner;
<PB N="104" REF="135"/>
but the wages for work being very low, and as I had spent much time in writing hymns to every song-tune that I knew, besides a number of love-verses, letters, &amp;c. I was very poor; and to complete all, I began to keep a deal of company, in which I gave a loose to my natural gaiety of disposition, much more than was consistent with the grave, se∣date ideas which I had formed of a religious character, all which made me resolve to leave Kingsbridge, which I did in 1770.</P>
<P>I travelled as far as Exeter the first day, where I worked about a fortnight, and sav∣ed sufficient to carry me to Bridgewater, where I worked two or three weeks more. Before I arrived there Mr. John Jones had gone back to reside at Bristol, but as soon as he heard of my being in Bridgewater, he and his brother Richard sent me an invitation to come to Bristol again and live with them. But finding that I did not immediately comply, they both came to Bridgewater to me, and
<PB N="105" REF="136"/>
declared their intentions of not returning to Bristol without me; so that after a day or two I yielded to their solicitations, and again lived very comfortably with them, their mother and sister.</P>
<P>I think it was about this period, that I went several times to the Tabernacle, and heard Mr. George Whitefield; and of all the preachers that ever I attended, never did I meet with one that had such a perfect command of the passions of his audience. In every sermon that I heard him preach, he would sometimes make them ready to burst with laughter, and the next moment drown them in tears; indeed it was scarce possible for the most guarded to escape the effect.

<P>I MUST now request you to go back with me a few years, as I have not yet made you acquainted with my amours. I was about seventeen years of age when an adventure dis∣covered, that altho' I was so very spiritual, as I before informed you, yet still I was suscep∣tible of another kind of impression. For be∣ing at farmer Gamlin's at Charlton, four miles from Taunton, to hear a methodist sermon,
<PB N="107" REF="138"/>
I fell desperately in love with the farmer's handsome dairy-maid.</P>
<Q><L>"Her home-spun dress in simple neatness lies,</L>
<L>"And for no glaring equipage she sighs</L>
<L>"She gratefully receives what heaven has sent,</L>
<L>"And, rich in poverty, enjoys content.</L>

<L>"No midnight masquerade her beauty wears,</L>
<L>"And health, not paint, the fading bloom repairs.</L>
<L>"If Love's soft passions in her bosom reign,</L>
<L>"An equal passion warms her happy swain."</L>
<BIBL>Gay.</BIBL></Q>
<P>At that time I abounded in spiritual gifts, which induced this honest rustic maid to be very kind to me, and to walk several fields with me in my road back to Taunton, talk∣ing all the way of her spiritual distress and godly concerns; while I poured heavenly comfort into her soul, and talked so long of <HI>divine</HI> Love, until I found that my affection for her was not altogether of that <HI>spiritual</HI> nature. And yet, <Q><PB N="108" REF="139"/>
<L>"We lov'd without transgressing Virtue's bounds;</L>
<L>"We fix'd the limits of our tenderest thoughts,</L>
<L>"Came to the verge of honour, and there stopp'd;</L>
<L>"We warm'd us by the fire, but were not scorch'd.</L>
<L>"If this be sin, Angels might live with more;</L>
<L>"And mingle rays of minds less pure than ours."</L>
<BIBL>Dryden's Love Triumphant.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>After this you may be sure that I did not let slip any opportunity of hearing sermons at farmer Gamlin's; and I generally prevailed with Nancy Smith, my charming spiritual dairy maid, to accompany me part of the way home, and at every gate I ratified my spiri∣tual advice with a kiss.</P>
<Q><L>—"Oh then the longest summer's day</L>
<L>"Seem'd too too much in haste; still the full heart</L>
<L>"Had not imparted half: 'twas happiness</L>
<L>"Too exquisite to last. Of joys departed</L>
<L>"Never to return, how painful the remembrance!</L>
<BIBL>Blair's Grave.</BIBL></Q>
<P>But alas! these comfortable Sunday walks were soon at an end; as my charming Nancy Smith, for some reason or other (I have for∣got what) left her place, and went to live as
<PB N="109" REF="140"/>
dairy-maid with a farmer in the marsh coun∣try, between Bridgewater and Bristol, seven∣teen miles from Taunton. So that I did not see her for near two years afterwards; du∣ring which time I gave advice to another ho∣ly sister, whose name was Hannah Allen.</P>
<P>I prevailed on this lovely maid to attend the methodist preaching at five o'clock on Mon∣day mornings, and we often met at three or four; so that we had an hour or two to spend in walking and conversation on spiritual af∣fairs: and had you seen and heard us on the cold frosty mornings, it would have put you in mind of Milton's <HI>Devils,</HI> whom he repre∣sents as at times starving with cold:</P>
<Q><L>"Others apart, sat on a hill, retir'd,</L>

<L>"Fix'd fate, free-will; foreknowledge absolute;</L>
<L>"And found no end, in wandering mazes lost."</L>
<BIBL>Paradise Lost.</BIBL></Q>
<P>But I assure you, my friend, that we were sometimes like the Galatians of old; we
<PB N="110" REF="141"/>
began in the <HI>spirit,</HI> and ended in the <HI>flesh.</HI></P>
<P>With this dear girl I spent all my leisure time, for two or three years: so that we en∣joyed together hundreds of happy innocent hours.</P>
<Q><L>"My Time, O ye Muses, was happily spent,</L>
<L>"When <HI>Hannah</HI> went with me wherever I went."</L></Q>
<P>But still I never could entirely forget my charming innocent <HI>Dairy-maid.</HI> The truth is, I had Love enough for both, to have taken either <HI>for better for worse</HI>; but my being an apprentice, prevented me from mar∣rying either.</P>
<P>'Tis true I had the greatest love for Nancy Smith. But Hannah Allen had the advantage of Nancy, as I could see Hannah almost every day, and Nancy only once or twice in about three years. However I at last fell out with Hannah, (an what occasion I cannot recollect) and I sent Nancy a letter, which made up matters with her: soon after that she came to live for a little time at her
<PB N="111" REF="142"/>
father's house at Petherton near Bridgewater, seven miles from Taunton. This happened during the election at Taunton, when I was changed from a strict methodist to a rake; so that although we were to have been married in a few days, yet the marriage was put off on account of my dissipated character, and I soon after set off for Bristol, as I before informed you: nor did I see her after that, until my return from Kingsbridge, when I saw her several times prior to my setting off for Bristol, with my friend John Jones, and his brother Richard.</P>

But better work being required there than in Kingsbridge, &amp;c. I was obliged to take so much care to please my master, that at first I could not get more than nine shillings a week, and my wife could get but very little, as she was learning to bind stuff-shoes, and had never been much used to her needle; so that what with the expence of ready-fur∣nished lodging, fire, candles, &amp;c. we had but little left for purchasing provisions.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="147"/>To increase our straits, my old friend being somewhat displeased at our leaving him and his relations, took an early opportunity to tell me that I was indebted to him near forty shillings, of two years standing.

Strong beer we had none, nor any other liquor, (the pure element excepted) and instead of tea, or rather coffee, we toasted a piece of bread; at other times we fried some wheat, which when boiled in water made a tolerable substitute for coffee; and as to ani∣mal food, we made use of but little, and that little we boiled and made broth of.</P>

<P>IN a few days after we had paid the last five shillings of the debt claimed by my friend Mr. Jones, we were both together taken so ill as to be confined to our bed, but the good woman of the house, our Landlady, came to our room and did a few trifles for us. She seemed very much alarmed at our situati∣on, or rather for her own, I suppose, as thinking we might in some measure become burthensome to her. We had in cash two shil∣lings and nine-pence, half a crown of which we had carefully locked up in a box, to be saved for a resource on any extraordinary emer∣gence.
<PB N="119" REF="150"/>
This money supported us two or three days, in which time I recovered without the help of medicine: but my wife continued ill near six months, and was confined to her bed the greatest part of the time; which illness may very easily be accounted for.</P>
<P>Before she came to Bristol, she had ever been used to a very active life, and had al∣ways lived in the country, so that in coming to dwell in a populous city, she had exchanged much exercise and good air for a sedentary life and very bad air; and this I presume was the cause of all her illness from time to time, which at length, as unfortunately as effectu∣ually undermined her constitution. During her first six months illness, I lived many days solely on water-gruel; for as I could not af∣ford to pay a nurse, much of my time was taken up in attendance on her, and most of my money expended in procuring medicines, together with such trifles as she could eat and drink. But what added extremely to my ca∣lamity
<PB N="120" REF="151"/>
was the being within the hearing of her groans, which were caused by the excru∣ciating pains in her head, which for months together defied the power of medicine.</P>
<P>It is impossible for words to describe the keenness of my sensations during this long term; yet as to <HI>myself,</HI> my poverty and being obliged to live upon water-gruel gave me not the least uneasiness.

How I supported this long, dreary scene, I
<PB N="121" REF="152"/>
know not; the bare recollection of which is painful, even at this distance of time. At last, when every thing that seemed to promise relief had been tried in vain, some old woman recom∣mended <HI>Cephalic</HI> snuff. I own I had not much faith in it; however I procured it, and in a short time after she was much relieved from the into¦lerable pain in her head, but yet continued in a very bad state of health; her constitution hav∣ing suffered such a dreadful shock, I thought that no means could be used so likely to restore it, as a removal to her native air. According∣ly I left my seat of work at Bristol, and re∣turned with her to Taunton, which is about seven miles from Petherton, her native place. But in Taunton I could not procure so much work as I could do; so that as soon as I thought she could bear the air of Bristol, we returned thither, where she soon relapsed, and we again went back to Taunton. This re∣moving to Taunton was repeated about five times in little more than three years.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="153"/>But at last, finding that she had long fits of illness at Taunton also, as well as at Bristol, with a view of having a better price for my work I resolved to visit London; and as I had not money sufficient to bear the expences of both to town, I left her all the money I could spare, and took a place on the outside of the stage coach, and the second day arrived in the me∣tropolis, in August 1774, with two shillings and sixpence in my pocket; and recollecting the address of an old townsman, who was also a spiritual brother,

This holy Brother was also a journeyman shoe-maker, who had arrived at the summit of his expectations, being able to keep an house over his head (as he chose to express
<PB N="123" REF="154"/>
himself;) that is, by letting nearly the whole of it out in lodgings, he was enabled to pay the rent. This house was in White-cross-street, which I found out the morning after my arrival, where I procured a lodging, and Mr. Heath, in Fore-street, supplied me with plenty of work.</P>

<P>AT this time I was as visionary and super∣stitious as ever I had been at any preced∣ing period, for although I had read some sen∣sible Books, and had thereby acquired a few rational ideas, yet having had a methodistical wife for near four years, and my keeping methodistical company, together with the gloomy notions which in spite of reason and philosophy I had imbibed during the frequent, long and indeed almost constant illness of my wife, the consequence was, that those few ra∣tional or liberal ideas which I had before trea∣sured
<PB N="125" REF="156"/>
up, were at my coming to London in a dormant state, or borne down by the torrent of enthusiastic whims, and fanatical chimeras.</P>

<P>So that as soon as I procured a lodging and work, my next enquiry was for Mr. Wesley's <HI>Gospel shops:</HI> and on producing my <HI>class</HI> and <HI>band</HI> tickets from Taunton, I was put into a class, and a week or two after admitted into a band.</P>
<P>But it was several weeks before I could firmly resolve to continue in London; as I really was struck with horror for the fate of it; more particularly on Sundays, as I found so few went to church, and so many were walking and riding about for pleasure, and the lower class getting drunk, quarrelling, fighting, working, buying, selling, &amp;c. I had seen so much of the same kind in Bristol, that I often wondered how God permitted it to
<PB N="126" REF="157"/>
stand: But London was so much worse, that I seriously trembled for fear the measure of iniquity was quite full, and that every hour would be its last. However I at length con∣cluded, that if London was a second <HI>Sodom,</HI> I was a second <HI>Lot</HI>; and these comfortable ideas reconciled me to the thought of living in it. Besides, some of Mr. Wesley's people gave me great comfort by assuring me, that "the Lord had much people in this city:" which I soon discovered to be true, as I got acquainted with many
<Q><L>"Errant saints, whom all men grant</L>
<L>"To be the true church militant,"</L></Q></P>
<P>In a month I saved money sufficient to bring up my wife, and she had a pretty tolerable state of health; of my master I obtained some Stuff-shoes for her to bind, and nearly as much as she could do, and as we had plenty of work and higher <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ges, we were tolerably easy in our circumstances, more so than we ever had been, so that we soon procured a few cloaths.
<PB N="127" REF="158"/>
My wife had all her life before done very well with a superfine broad cloth cloak, but now I prevailed on her to have one of silk.</P>
<P>Until this winter I had never found out that I wanted a <HI>great coat,</HI> but now I made that important discovery; and my landlord shewed me one made of a coarse kind of Bath coating, which he purchased new at a shop in Rosemary-lane, for ten shillings; so that the next half guinea I had to spare, away I went to Rosemary-lane, (and to my great suprise) was hauled into a shop by a fellow that was walking up and down before the door of a slopseller, where I was soon fitted with a great coat of the same sort as that of my Landlord. I asked the price; but how great was my astonishment, when the honest slop∣man told me, that he was so taken with my honest industrious looks, that he would let me have it cheaper than he would his own brother, so in one word he would oblige <HI>me</HI> with it for five and twenty shillings, which
<PB N="128" REF="159"/>
was the very money that it cost him. On hearing this, I crossed the shop in a trice, in order to set off home again, but the door had a fastening to it beyond my comprehension, nor would the good man let me out before I had made him an offer. I told him, I had so little money about me that I could not offer any thing, and again desired that he would let me out. But he persisted, and at last I told him that my landlord had informed me that he had purchased such another coat for ten shillings; on which he began to give him∣self airs, and assured me that however some people came by their goods, that for his part, he always paid for his. I heartily wished my∣self out of the shop, but in vain; as he seem∣ed determined not to part with me until I had made some offer. I then told him that I had but ten shillings and sixpence, and of course could not offer him anymore than I had got. I now expected more abuse from him, but instead of that the patient good man told me, that as he
<PB N="129" REF="160"/>
perhaps might get something by me another time, I should have the coat for my half guinea, although it was worth more than double the money.</P>
<P>About the end of November I received an account of the death of my grandfather; and was also informed that he had left a will in favour of my Grandmother-in-law's relati∣ons, who became possessed of all his effects, except a small freehold estate, which he left to my youngest brother, because he happened to be called George, (which was the name of my Grandfather) and ten pounds a piece to each of his grand-children.</P>
<P>So totally unacquainted was I with the modes of transacting business, that I could not point out any method of having my ten pounds sent up to London to me, at least no mode that the executor of the will would approve of; it being such a <HI>prodigious</HI> sum, that the greatest caution was used on both sides, so that it cost me about half the money in going
<PB N="130" REF="161"/>
down for it, and in returning to town again. This was in extremely hard frosty weather (I think some time in December, and being on the outside of a stage-coach, I was so very cold, that when I came to the inn where the passengers dined, I went directly to the fire, which struck the cold inward, so that I had but a very narrow escape from death. This happened in going down. In returning back to town, I had other misfortunes. The cold weather still continuing, I thought the basket warmer than the roof, and about six miles from Salisbury, I went back into the basket. But on getting out of it, in the Inn yard at Salisbury, I heard some money jingle, and on searching my pockets, I discovered that I had lost about sixteen shillings, two or three of which I found in the basket, the rest had fal∣len through on the road; and no doubt the whole of what I had left of my ten pounds would have gone the same way, had I not (for fear of highwaymen) sewed it up in my
<PB N="131" REF="162"/>
cloaths. The loss of my silver I bore with the temper of a stoic, and like Epictetus rea∣soned, that I could not have lost it, if I had not at first had it; and that as I had lost it, why it was all the same as though it had not been given to me at all.</P>
<P>But a more dreadful misfortune befel me the next morning; the extreme severe wea∣ther still continuing, in order to keep me from dying with cold, I drank some purl and gin, which (not being used to drink any thing strong) made me so drunk, that the coach∣man put me inside the carriage for fear I should fall off the roof. I there met with some of the jovial sort, who had also drank to keep out the cold, so that I found them in high glee; being asked to sing them a song, I im∣mediately complied, and forgot that I was one of the holy brethren, so that I sung song for song with the merriest of them; only seve∣ral times between the acts, I turned up the whites of my eyes, and uttered a few ejacula∣tions,
<PB N="132" REF="163"/>
as "Lord forgive me!" "O Christ! What am I doing?" and a few more of the same pious sort. However, after eating a good dinner, and refraining from liquor, I became nearly sober, and by the time I arrived in town quite so; though in a terrible agitation of mind, by reflecting on what I had done, and was so ashamed of the affair, that I concealed it from my wife, that I might not grieve her righteous soul with the knowledge of so dread∣ful a fall: so that she with great pleasure ripped open the places in my cloaths, which contained my treasure, and with an heart full of gratitude, piously thanked Providence for affording us such a supply, and hoped that the Lord would enable us to make a good use of it.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the remainder of the money we purchased houshold goods, but as we then had not sufficient to furnish a room, we worked hard, and lived hard, so that in a short time we had a room furnished with our own goods; and I believe that it is not possi∣ble for you to imagine with what pleasure and satisfaction we looked round the room and surveyed our property: I believe that Alexan∣der the Great never reflected on his immense acquisitions with half the heart-felt enjoyment which we experienced on this capital attainment.</P>
<P>After our room was furnished, as we still enjoyed a better state of health than we did at Bristol and Taunton, and had also more
<PB N="134" REF="165"/>
work and higher wages, we often added some∣thing or other to our stock of wearing apparel. Nor did I forget the old book-shops: but fre∣quently added an old book to my small col∣lection, and I really have often purchased books with the money that should have been expended in purchasing something to eat, an instance of which follows:</P>
<P>At the time we were purchasing houshold goods, we kept ourselves very short of money, and on Christmas-eve we had but half-a-crown left to buy a Christmas dinner. My wife de∣sired that I would go to market, and purchase this festival dinner, and off I set for that pur∣pose▪ but in the way I saw an old book-shop, and I could not resist the temptation of going in; intending only to expend sixpence or nine∣pence out of my half-crown. But I stumbled upon Young's Night Thoughts—down went my half-crown—and I hastened home, vastly delighted with the acquisition. When my wife asked me where was our Christmas
<PB N="135" REF="166"/>
dinner? I told her it was in my pocket.— "In your pocket! (said she) that is a strange place. How could you think of stuffing a joint of meat into your pocket?" I assured her that it would take no harm. But as I was in no haste to take it out, she began to be more particular, and enquired what I had got, &amp;c. On which I began to harangue on the superiority of intellectual pleasures over sen∣sual gratifications, and observed that the brute creation enjoyed the latter in a much higher degree than man —</P>
<P>I was proceeding in this strain: "And so, (said she) instead of buying a dinner, I sup∣pose you have, as you have done before, been buying <HI>books</HI> with the money?" I then con∣fessed I had bought Young's Night Thoughts: "And I think (said I) that I have acted wisely; for had I bought <HI>a dinner,</HI> we should have eaten it to-morrow, and the pleasure would have been soon over, but should we live fifty years longer, we shall have the <HI>Night
<PB N="136" REF="167"/>
Thoughts</HI> to feast upon." My wife was con∣vinced. Down I sat, and began to read with as much enthusiasm as the good doctor possess∣ed when he wrote it: and so much did it ex∣cite my attention as well as approbation, that I retained the greatest part of it in my me∣mory.</P>
<P>Sometime in June 1775, as we sat at work in our room, Mr. Boyd, one of Mr. Wesley's people, called and informed me that a little shop and parlour were to be let in Feather∣stone street, and added, that if I was to take it I might there get some work as a master. I without hesitation told him that I liked the idea, and hinted that I would sell books also. Mr. Boyd then asked me, how I came to think of selling books? I informed him that until that moment it had never once entered into my thoughts; but that when he proposed my taking the shop, it instantaneously oc∣curred to my mind, that for several months past I had observed a great increase in a cer∣tain
<PB N="137" REF="168"/>
old book shop; and that I was persuaded I knew as much of old books as the person who kept it. I farther observed, that I loved books, and that if I could but be a bookseller, I should then have plenty of books to read, which was the greatest motive I could con∣ceive to induce me to make the attempt. My friend on this assured me, that he would get the shop for me, and with a laugh added, "when <HI>you</HI> are Lord mayor, you shall use all your interest to get <HI>me</HI> made an Alderman. Which I engaged not to forget to perform.</P>
<P>My <HI>private library</HI> at this time consisted of Fletcher's Checks to Antinomianism, &amp;c. 5 volumes; Watts's Improvement of the Mind; Young's Night Thoughts; Wake's Translation of the Apostolical Epistles; Fleet∣wood's Life of Christ; the first twenty num∣bers of Hinton's Dictionary of the Arts and Sciences; some of Wesley's Journals, and some of the pious lives, published by him; and about a dozen other volumes of the latter sort,
<PB N="138" REF="169"/>
besides odd magazines, &amp;c. And to set me up in this stile, Mr. Boyd recommended me to the friends of an holy brother lately gone to heaven, and of them I purchased a bagful of old books, chiefly divinity, for a guinea.</P>
<P>With this stock, and some odd scraps of leather, which together with all my books were worth about five pounds, I opened shop on Midsummer day, 1775, in Featherstone-Street, in the Parish of St. Luke; and I was as well pleased in surveying my little shop with my name over it, as was Nebuchadnez∣zar, when he said "Is not this great Baby∣lon that I have built?" and my good wife often perceiving the pleasure that I took in my shop, piously cautioned me against setting my mind on the riches of this world, and assured me that it was all but vanity. "You are very right, my dear, I sometimes replied, and to keep our minds as spiritual as we can, we will always attend our class and band meetings, hear as many sermons, &amp;c. at the
<PB N="139" REF="170"/>
Foundry on week days as possible, and on sabbath days we will mind nothing but the good of our souls: our small beer shall be fetched in on Saturday nights, nor will we dress even a potatoe on the sabbath. We will still attend the preaching at five o'clock in the morning; at eight go to the prayer meeting; at ten to the public worship at the foundry; hear Mr. Perry at Cripplegate, at two; be at the preaching at the Foundry, at five; meet with the general Society at six; meet in the united bands at seven, and again be at the prayer meeting at eight; and then come home and read and pray by ourselves."</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the obscurity of the street, and the mean appearance of my shop, yet I soon found customers for what few books I had, and I as soon laid out the money in other old trash which was daily brought for sale.</P>
<P>At that time Mr. Wesley's people had a sum of money which was kept on purpose to
<PB N="141" REF="172"/>
lend out, for three months, to such of their society whose characters were good, and who wanted a temporary relief. To increase my little stock, I borrowed five pounds out of this fund, which was of great service to me.</P>
<P>In our new situation we lived in a very frugal manner, often dining on potatoes, and quenching our thirst with water, being abso∣lutely determined if possible to make some provision for such dismal times as sickness, shortness of work, &amp;c. which we had been so frequently involved in before, and could scarce help expecting to be our fate again. My wife foreboded it much more than I did, being of a more melancholy turn of mind.</P>
<Q>"A sad prophetic Spirit dwells with woe."</Q>
<P>I lived in this street six months, and in that time increased my stock from five pounds, to twenty-five pounds. This stock I deemed too great to be buried in Featherstone-Street; and a shop and parlour being to let in Chiswell-Street, No. 46, I took them. This was at
<PB N="142" REF="173"/>
that time, and for fourteen years afterwards a very dull and obscure situation; but still it was much better adapted for business than Featherstone-Street.</P>
<P>A few weeks after I came into Chiswell-Street, I bade a final adieu to the <HI>gentle croft,</HI> and converted my little stock of leather, &amp;c. into old books; and a great sale I had, con∣sidering my stock; which was not only very small, but contained very little variety, as it principally consisted of Divinity; for as I had not much knowledge, so I seldom ventured out of my depth. Indeed, there was one class of books, which for the first year or two that I called myself a Bookseller, I would not sell, for such was my ignorance, bigotry, supersti∣tion, (or what you please) that I conscien∣tiously destroyed such books as fell into my hands which were written by free-thinkers: for really supposing them to be dictated by the devil, I would neither read them myself, nor sell them to others.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="174"/>You will perhaps be surprised when I in∣form you, that there are in London, (and I suppose in other populous places) persons who purchase every article which they have occa∣sion for, (and also many articles which they have <HI>no</HI> occasion for) at stalls, beggarly shops, pawnbrokers, &amp;c. under the idea of purchasing <HI>cheaper</HI> than they could at respectable shops, and of men of property. A considerable num∣ber of these kind of customers I had in the beginning, who forsook my shop as soon as I began to appear more respectable, by intro∣ducing better order, possessing more valuable books, and having acquired a better judg∣ment, &amp;c. Notwithstanding which, I declare to you, upon my honour, that these very bar∣gain hunters have given me double the price that I now charge for thousands and tens of thousands of volumes. For as a tradesman increases in respectability and opulence, his opportunities of purchasing increase propor∣tionably, and the more he buys and sells, the
<PB N="144" REF="175"/>
more he becomes a judge of the real value of his goods. It was for want of this experience and judgment, Stock, &amp;c. that for several years I was in the habit of charging more than double the price I now do for many thou∣sand articles. But professed bargain hunters often purchase old <HI>locks</HI> at the stalls in Moor∣sields, when half the wards are rusted off and taken out, and give more for them than they would have paid for new locks to any repu∣table ironmonger. And what numerous in∣stances of this infatuation do we meet with daily at sales by auction, not of books only, but of many other articles! Of which I could here adduce a variety of glaring instan∣ces: but (not to tire you) a few of recent date shall suffice.—At the sale of Mr. Rigby's books at Mr. Christie's, Martyn's Dictionary of Natural History sold for <HI>fifteen guineas,</HI> which then stood in my catalogue at <HI>four pounds fifteen shilling,</HI> Pilkington's Dictionary of Painters, at <HI>seven guineas,</HI> usually sold at
<PB N="145" REF="176"/>
three; Francis's Horace, <HI>two pounds eleven shillings,</HI> and many others in the same manner. At Sir George Colebrook's sale, the octavo edi∣tion of the Tatler sold for <HI>two guineas and a half.</HI> At a sale a few weeks since, Rapin's History, in folio, the two first volumes only (instead of five) sold for upwards of <HI>five pounds!</HI></P>
<P>I went on prosperously until some time in September, 1775, when I was suddenly tak∣en ill of a dreadful fever; and eight or ten days after, my wife was seized with the same disorder.</P>
<P>At that time I only kept a boy to help in my shop, so that I fear, while I lay ill, my wife had too much care and anxiety on her mind. I have been told that before she was confined to her bed she walked about in a delirious state; in which she did not long continue, but contrary to all expectation died, in enthusiastic rant, on the ninth of No∣vember, surrounded with several methodistical preachers.</P>

<P>She was in reality one of the best of wo∣men; and although for about four years she was ill the greatest part of the time, which involved me in the very depth of poverty and distress, yet I never once repented having married her. 'Tis true she was enthusiastical to an extreme, and of course very superstiti∣ous and visionary, but as I was very far gone myself, I did not think that a fault in her.</P>
<P>Indeed she much exceeded me, and most others that ever fell under my observation, as she in reality <HI>totally,</HI> neglected and disre∣garded every kind of pleasure <HI>whatever,</HI> but those of a spiritual (or visionary) nature.

<P>Mr. R—t, a genteel tradesman with whom I am acquainted, having lost his second wife early in 1790, courted and married one of the holy sisters a few months afterwards. They had lived together about six months, when Mr. R—t, one Sunday, being a sober reli∣gious man, took down Doddridge's Lectures, and began to read them to his wife and family. But this holy Sister found fault with her hus∣band for reading such learned rational dis∣courses, which savoured too much of human reason and vain philosophy, and wished he would read something more spiritual and edi∣fying. He attempted to convince her that
<PB N="148" REF="179"/>
Dr. Doddridge was not only a good rational divine, but to the full as spiritual as any di∣vine ought to be; and that to be more spiri∣tual he must be less rational, and of course become fanatical and visionary. But these observations of the husband so displeased his spiritual wife, that she retired to bed, and left her husband to read Doddridge's Lectures as long as he chose to his children by a former wife.</P>
<P>The next morning while Mr. R—t was out on business, this holy sister, without say∣ing one syllable to any person, packed up all her cloaths, crammed them into a hackney coach, and away she went. Mr. R—t, poor soul! on coming home discovered his immense loss, and in an almost frantic state, spent the first fortnight in fruitless attempts to discover her retreat.</P>
<P>"Three weeks after her elopement, I was (says Mr. R—t) <Q>“going down Cheapside one day, and saw a lady something like my
<PB N="149" REF="180"/>
wife, but as she was somewhat disguised, and I could not see her face, I was not sure. At last I ventured to look under her bonnet, and found, that, sure enough, it was she. I then walked three times backwards and forwards in Cheapside, endeavouring to per∣suade her to return with me, or to discover where she lived: but she obstinately refused to return, or to let me see her retreat; and here (says Mr. R—t) I begged that she would grant me a kiss; but she would not willingly. However after some bustle in the street, I took a farewell kiss. Poor dear soul! (sigh'd he) she is rather <HI>too spiritual!</HI> for notwithstanding I laid by her side near six months, she never would be prevailed upon to do any thing carnal; and although I did all in my power to get the better of her spiritual scruples, yet she was always so in love with Christ her heavenly spouse, that when she eloped from me, she
<PB N="150" REF="181"/>
was, I assure you, as good a virgin as when ”I married her.</Q></P>

<P>BECAUSE some of the holy sisters are in their amours altogether spiritual, you are by no means to understand that they are <HI>all</HI> so totally divested of the carnal propensity.</P>
<P>Some of these good creatures are so far from thinking that their husbands are too carnal in their affections, that they really think that they are not enough so; and instances are not wanting, in which, owing to their having husbands too spiritual, they have been obliged to receive assistance from the husbands of other women.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="183"/>It is but about a year since a certain cele∣brated preacher used to administer carnal con∣solation to the wife of his clerk. This holy communication was repeated so often, and so open that at last it came to the clerk's ears, who watching an opportunity, one day sur∣prized the pious pair at their <HI>devotion,</HI> and so <HI>belaboured</HI> the preacher with his walking-staff, that the public were for near a month deprived of the benefits resulting from his remarkable gift of eloquence.</P>
<P>As I am got into the story-telling way, I cannot resist the temptation of telling another.</P>
<P>A certain holy sister who lately kept an house in a country village near London, and <HI>took in</HI> (as they called it) Mr. Wesley's preachers, [by taking <HI>in</HI> is only meant, that when they came in their turn to preach in the village she used to supply each with vic∣tuals and a bed; <HI>no doubt</HI> but they slept <HI>alone.</HI>] This lady was so very remarkable for her spiritual <HI>experience</HI> and divine gifts, that
<PB N="153" REF="184"/>
she attracted many to her house, besides such as came in the regular course of their duty, and among the former a preacher from Lon∣don, from whom I learnt the affair. This preacher happening to want a wife, and being very spiritually-minded, actually married her in December 1790, merely for her great gifts and grace, as her fortune was not above the fiftieth part as much as his own; and as to person, she is scarce one degree above ugliness itself; although her husband is well-propor∣tioned, and upon the whole a handsome man. They had not been married a week, when this simple preacher discovered this gifted gracious saint was an incarnate devil, who had mar∣ried him only to rob, plunder, and cuckold him. For between her and her gallants, they had bullied him out of a settlement to the amount of four times the sum she brought him, and the poor pious preacher thinks that he has cheaply got rid of her.</P>
<P>The reason why I interest myself in his be∣half
<PB N="154" REF="185"/>
is, because I am confident that he really is an honest well-meaning man at the bottom; but withal one that does not possess the great∣est share of understanding, and who being formerly but a mean mechanic, never had any education, so that although he is a great en∣thusiast, yet he is one of the good-natured inoffensive sort, who will do no harm to any person, but will do all the good in his power. I am only sorry, as he lately was an honest useful tradesman, that he should have so much spiritual quixotism in him, as at thirty years of age to shut up his shop and turn preacher, without being able to read his primer; which upon my honour, is the case. But here, my friend, you see I forgot that these heavenly teachers only speak as the spirit giveth utter∣ance, and that of course all human learning is entirely superfluous.</P>

<P>A few years since the methodist-preachers got footing in Wellington, (the famous birth-place of your humble servant) and establish∣ed a society there, soon after which one of their preachers (at Collopton, a neighbouring town) happened to like a young servant girl, who was one of the holy Sisters, she having gone through the new birth, better than his wife, because she was an unenlightened, un∣converted woman. But this servant girl hap∣pening to be with child, the news soon reached Wellington; and a very wealthy gentleman who entertained the preachers there, followed the preacher of Collopton's example, and got his own pious maid with child. After this
<PB N="156" REF="187"/>
some of the Society in Wellington began to have all things in common, and several more of the holy Sisters proved prolific: which so alarmed the parish, that some of the heads of it insisted that the preachers should not be permitted to preach there any longer. "For, if (said they) the methodist-society continues, we shall have the parish full of bastards."</P>
<P>So you see, my dear friend, by the above examples, (were it necessary, I could give you many more) that not all the converted and sanctified females are thereby become so ab∣sorbed in the spiritual delights of the mystical union, as to have lost all relish for carnal con∣nexions; as we find that many among them are blessed with a mind so capacious, as to be able to relish the pleasures of both worlds.</P>

<P>AFTER a long digression, I must now return to my own affairs.</P>
<P>I continued in the above-mentioned dread∣ful fever many weeks, and my life was de∣spaired of by all that came near me. During which time, my wife, whom I affectionate∣ly loved, died and was buried, without my once having a sight of her. And what added much to my misfortunes, several nurses that were hired to take care of me and my wife, proved so abandoned and depraved as to have lost all sense of moral obligation, and every
<PB N="158" REF="189"/>
tender feeling for one who to all appearance was just on the point of death: several of these monsters in female shape robbed my drawers of linnen, &amp;c. and kept themselves drunk with gin, while I lay unable to move in my bed, and was ready to perish, partly owing to want of cleanliness and proper care. In this state I must inevitably have perished, had it not been for my sister Dorothy, wife of Mr. Northoun of Lambeth, and my sister Elizabeth, wife of Mr. Bell in Soho. These kind sisters, as soon as they were informed of the deplorable state in which I lay, notwith∣standing some misunderstanding which sub∣sisted between us, and prevented me from sending for them, hastened to me, and each sat up with me alternately, so that I had one or the other with me every night; and, con∣trary to all expectation, I recovered. But this recovery was in a very slow manner.</P>
<P>As soon as I was able to enquire into the state of my affairs, I found that Mr. Wheeler,
<PB N="159" REF="190"/>
sack and rope-maker in Old-street, and Messrs. Bottomley and Shaw, carpenters and sash-makers in Bunhill-row, had saved me from ruin, by locking up my shop, which contained my little <HI>all.</HI> Had not this been done, the nurses would no doubt have contrived means to have emptied my shop, as they had done my drawers.</P>
<P>The above gentlemen not only took care of my shop, but also advanced money to pay such expences as occurred; and as my wife was dead, they assisted in making my will in favour of my mother.</P>
<P>These worthy gentlemen belong to Mr. Wesley's Society, (and notwithstanding they have imbibed many enthusiastic whims) yet would they be an honour to any society, and are a credit to human nature. I hope that I never shall recollect their kindness without being filled with the warmest sentiments of gratitude towards them.</P>
<Q><PB N="160" REF="191"/>
<L>"He that hath Nature in him must be grateful:</L>

<L>"Joining the greater to the lesser nature,</L>
<L>"Tying the weak and strong, the poor and powerful,</L>
<L>"Subduing men to brutes, and even brutes to men."</L></Q>
<P>On my recovery I also learnt that Miss Dorcas Turton, (the young woman that kept the house, and of whom I then rented the shop, parlour, kitchen and garret) having out of kindness to my wife, occasionally assisted her during her illness, had caught the same dreadful disorder, and was then very danger¦ously ill, and that people shunned the house as much as though the plague was in it. So that when I opened my shop again, I was stared at as though I had come back from the other world; and it was a considerable time before many of my former customers could credit that I really was in existence, it having been repeatedly reported that I was dead.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="192"/>Miss Dorcas Turton, was a charming young woman, and you must now be made farther acquainted with her. She was the daughter of Mr. Samuel Turton of Stafford∣shire, her mother did not by marrying change her name, which was Miss Jemima Turton, of Oxfordshire, Mr. Samuel Turton had a large fortune of his own, and about twenty thou∣sand pounds with his wife Miss Jemima, but by an unhappy turn for gaming he dissipated nearly the whole of it, and was obliged to have recourse to trade to help to support his family.</P>
<Q><L>"'Tis lost at dice, what ancient honour won,</L>
<L>"Hard, when the father plays away the son!</L></Q>
<P>He opened a shop as a Sadler's Ironmonger, but as he was but little acquainted with trade, and as his old propensity to gaming never quitted him, it is no wonder that he did not succeed in his business; and to crown all his other follies, he was bound for a false friend in a large sum; this compleated his ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="193"/>His wife died in Jan. 1773, and his final ruin ensued a few months after; so that from that time to his death he was partly supported by his daughter Miss Dorcas Turton, who cheerfully submitted to keep a school, and worked very hard at plain work, by which means she kept her father from want. The old gentleman died a few months after I came into the shop. Being partly acquainted with this young lady's goodness to her father, I concluded that so good a daughter was very likely to make a good wife; I also knew that she was immoderately fond of books, and would frequently read until morning; this turn of mind in her was the greatest of all recommendations to me, who having acquir∣ed a few ideas, was at that time restless to increase them: so that I was in raptures with the bare thoughts of having a woman to read with, and also to read to me.</P>

<P>I embraced the first opportunity after her recovery to make her acquainted with my mind, and as we were no strangers to each others characters and circumstances, there was no need of a long formal courtship; so I prevailed on her not to defer our union longer than the 30th of January, 1776, when I for the second time entered into the holy state of matrimony.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now in February 1776, arrived at an important period of my life. Being lately recovered from a very painful, dangerous, and hopeless illness, I found myself once more in a confirmed state of health, surrounded by my little stock in trade, which was but just saved from thieves, and which to me was an immense treasure. Add to the above, my having won a second time in a game where the odds were so much against me; or to use ano∣ther simile, my having drawn another prize in the lottery of wedlock, and thus repaired the
<PB N="165" REF="196"/>
loss of one very valuable woman with the acquisition of another still more valuable.</P>
<Q><L>"O Woman! let the libertine decry,</L>

<L>"Beauty the smallest excellence they boast;</L>
<L>"Where all unite substantial bliss to prove,</L>
<L>"And give mankind in them a taste of joys above."</L>
<BIBL>Hayward.</BIBL></Q>
<P>On reflecting on the above united circum∣stances, I found in my mind an unusual sen∣sation, such as until then I was a stranger to: my mind began to expand, intellectual light add pleasure broke in and dispelled the gloom of fanatical melancholy; the sour∣ness of my natural temper (which had been much increased by superstition, which Swift calls, "the spleen of the soul,") in part gave way, and was succeeded by cheerfulness, and some degree of good-nature.</P>
<P>It was in one of these cheerful moods that I one day took up the Life of John Bun∣cle;
<PB N="166" REF="197"/>
and it is impossible for my friend to imagine with what eagerness and pleasure I read through the whole four volumes of this sensible pleasing work; it was wrote by the late Mr. Amory of Wakefield, and I know not of any work more proper to be put into the hands of a poor ignorant bigotted superstitious methodist; but the misfortune is, that scarce any of them will read any thing but what suits with their own narrow notions, so that they shut themselves up in darkness, and ex∣clude every ray of intellectual light; which puts me in mind of the enthusiasts on the banks of the Ganges, who will not look at any thing beyond the tip of their noses. By the time I had gone through the last volume,
<Q>"My soul had took its freedom up." <BIBL>Green.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I now began to enjoy many innocent plea∣sures and recreations in life, without the fear of being eternally damn'd for a laugh, a joke, or for spending a sociable evening with a few friends, going to the play-house, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="198"/>In short I saw that true religion was no way incompatible with or an enemy to ra∣tional pleasures of any kind.</P>
<Q><L>"Fools by excess make varied pleasure pall,</L>
<L>"The wise man's moderate, and enjoys them all."</L>
<BIBL>Voltaire by Franklin.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I now also began to read with great plea∣sure the rational and moderate divines of all denominations: and a year or two after I be∣gan with metaphysics, in the intricate though pleasing labyrinths of which I have occasional∣ly wandered ever since, nor am I ever likely to find my way out.</P>
<Q><L>"Like a guide in a mist have I rambled about,</L>
<L>"And now come at last where at first I set out.</L></Q>
<P>I am not in the least uneasy on that head, as I have no doubt of being in my last mo∣ments able to adopt the prayer of one of the greatest men that ever existed:</P>
<Q><L>"Great God, whose being by thy works is known,</L>
<L>"Hear my last words from thy eternal throne:</L>
<L>"If I mistook, 'twas while thy law I sought,</L>
<L>"I may have err'd, but thou wert in each thought.</L>
<L><PB N="168" REF="199"/>"Fearless I look beyond the opening grave,</L>
<L>"And cannot think the God who being gave,</L>
<L>"The God whose favours made my bliss o'erflow,</L>
<L>"Has doom'd me, after death, to endless woe.</L></Q>
<P>Having begun to think rationally, and rea∣son freely on religious matters, you may be sure I did not long remain in Mr. Wesley's Society; and what is remarkable, I well re∣member that some years before, Mr. Wesley told his Society in Broadmead, Bristol, in my hearing, that he could never keep a bookseller six months in his flock. He was then pointing out the danger that attended close reasoning in matters of religion and spiritual concerns, in reading controversies, &amp;c. at that time I had not the least idea of my ever becoming a Bookseller: but I no sooner began to give scope to my reasoning faculties than the above remarkable assertion occurred to my mind.</P>
<P>But that which rather hastened my de∣parture from methodism was this. The
<PB N="169" REF="200"/>
methodist preachers were continually repro∣bating the practice of masters and mistresses keeping servants at home on sundays, to dress dinners, which prevented them from hearing the Word of God (by the Word of God they mean their own jargon of nonsense), assuring them if the souls of such servants were damn∣ed, they might in a great measure lay their damnation at the doors of such masters and mistresses, who rather than eat a cold dinner, would be guilty of breaking the sabbath, and risking the souls of their servants. But how great was my surprize on discovering that these very men who were continually preaching up fasting, abstinence, &amp;c. to their congrega∣tions, and who wanted others to dine off cold dinners, or eat bread and cheese, &amp;c. would themselves not even <HI>sup,</HI> without roasted fowls, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This I found to be fact, as I several times had occasion after preaching to go into the kitchen behind the <HI>old Foundry</HI> (which at
<PB N="170" REF="201"/>
that time was Mr, Wesley's preaching house;) there I saw women who had been kept from hearing the sermon, &amp;c. by being employed in roasting fowls, and otherwise providing good suppers, for the preachers.</P>
<P>So said I, "you lay burthens on other men's shoulders, but will not so much as touch them yourselves with one of your fin∣gers."

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAD no sooner left Mr. Wesley's society, and begun to talk a little more like a ra∣tional being, but I found that I had incurred the hatred of some, the pity of others, the envy of many, and the displeasure of <HI>all</HI> Mr. Wesley's—<HI>old women</HI>! So that for a long time I was constantly teased with their im∣pertinent nonsense. I believe that never was a poor devil so plagued. Some as they passed by my door in their way to the Foundry would only make a stop and lift up their hands, turn up the whites of their eyes, shake their heads, groan, and pass on. Many would call in and take me aside, and after making rueful faces, would address me with,
<PB N="172" REF="203"/>
"Oh, brother Lackington! I am very sorry to find that you who begun in the Spirit are now like to end in the flesh. Pray Brother, do remember Lot's wife." Another would interrupt me in my business, to tell me, that "he that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is unfit for the kingdom." Another has just called as he was passing by, to caution me against the bewitching snares of prosperity. Others again called to know if I was as happy then as I was when I con∣stantly sought the Lord with my brethren, in prayer meeting, in class, in band, &amp;c. When I assured them that I was more happy, they in a very solem manner assured me, that I was under a very great delusion of the devil; and when I by chance happened to laugh at their enthusiastic rant, some have run out of my shop, declaring that they were afraid to stay under the same roof with me, lest the house should fall on their heads. Sometimes I have been accosted in such an alarming manner as
<PB N="173" REF="204"/>
though the house was on fire, with "Oh! Brother! Brother! you are fast asleep! and the flames of hell are taking hold of you!"</P>
<P>A certain preacher assured me, in the pre∣sence of several gentlemen, that the devil would soon toss me about in the flames of hell with a pitchfork. This same eloquent mild preacher used occasionally to strip to his shirt to dodge the devil.</P>
<P>Mr. E. a gentleman of my acquaintance, going through some alley, one Sunday, hear∣ing a very uncommon noise, was led by curi∣osity to the house from whence it proceeded, and there he saw elevated above an assembly of old women, &amp;c. this taylor, stript in his shirt, with his wig off, sweating, foaming at the mouth, and bellowing like a baited bull. In the above manner it seems he would often amuse himself and his congregation for near two hours,

<BIBL>Butler's posth. Works.</BIBL></Q>
<PB N="174" REF="205"/>
Others again of the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> saints would assure me that I never had one grain of saving grace, and that when I thought myself a child of God, I was only deluded by the de∣vil, who being now quite sure of me, did not think it worth his while to deceive me any longer. Others advised me to take care of sinning against light and knowledge, and piously hoped that it was not quite <HI>too late</HI>; that I had not (they hoped) committed the <HI>unpardonable</HI> sin against the Holy Ghost. Others again, who happened to be in a bet∣ter humour, often assured me that they should see me brought back to the true sheepfold, as they really hoped I had once been in a state of grace, and if so, that I always was in grace, in spite of all I could do: the Lord would never quit his hold of me; that I might fall <HI>foully,</HI> but that it was impossible for me to fall <HI>finally,</HI> as in the end I should be brought back on the shoulders of the everlasting gos∣pel,
<PB N="175" REF="206"/>
for when God came to number his jew∣els, not one would be missing.</P>
<P>One of these righteous men, after passing some encomiums on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for my moral cha∣racter, assured me that I had by no means fallen so low as many of God's children had fallen, but fall as low as they possibly can, said he, they are still God's children, for altho' they may "be black with sin they are fair within." He then read to me the following passage out of a pamphlet written against Mr. Fletcher, by Mr. R. Hill. <Q>“David stood as completely justified in the everlasting right∣eousness of Christ, at the time when he caused Uriah to be murdered, and was com∣mitting adultery with his wife, as he was in any part of his life. For all the sins of the Elect, be they more or be they less, be they past, present, or to come, were for ever done away. So that every one of those ”<HI>elect</HI> stand spotless in the sight of God.</Q></P>
<P>Is not this a very comfortable kind of doc∣trine?
<PB N="176" REF="207"/>
The pernicious consequences of such tenets impressed on the minds of the ignorant followers of these quacks in religion, must be obvious to every person capable of reflec∣tion. They have nothing to do but to enlist themselves in the band of the Elect, and no matter then how criminal their life!</P>
<P>Thus, my dear friend, I was for a long time coaxed by some, threatened with all the tor∣tures of the damned by others, and constant∣ly teased somehow or other by all the me∣thodists who came near me. I at last determ∣ined to laugh at all their ridiculous perversions of the scripture, and their spiritual cant. The consequence (as might be expected) was, they piously and charitably consigned me over to be tormented by the devil, and every where declared that I was turned a downright atheist. But the aspersions of such fanatics gave me no concern, for
<Q><L>"—If there's a power above us,</L>
<L>"(And that there is, all nature cries aloud</L>

<L>"And that which he delights in must be happy.</L>
<BIBL>Addison's Cato.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>And no matter "when or where." After relating such ridiculous stuff as the above, I think that I cannot conclude this better than with Swift's humorous and satirical account of the Day of Judgment.</P>

<P>IT being generally known that I had for many years been a strict methodist, since I have freed myself from their shackles, I have been often asked if I did not believe or rather know, that the methodists were a vile sect of hypocrites altogether? My reply has been uni∣formly in the negative. I am certain that they are not in general so. The major part of them indeed are very ignorant, (as is the case with enthusiasts of every religion.) But I
<PB N="180" REF="211"/>
believe that a great number of the methodists are sincere, honest, friendly people. It may however be necessary to observe, that many artful, sly, designing people, having noticed their character, connections, &amp;c. and know∣ing that a religious person is in general sup∣posed to be honest and conscientious, have been induced to join their societies, and by assum∣ing an appearance of extraordinary sanctity, have the better been enabled to cheat and de∣fraud such as were not guarded against their hypocritical wiles.</P>
<Q><L>"Making religion a disguise,</L>
<L>"Or cloak to all their villanies."</L>
<BIBL>Butler's Posth. Works.</BIBL></Q>
<P>I have also reason to believe that there are not a few, who think that they can as it were afford to cheat and defraud, on the score of having right notions of religion in their <HI>heads,</HI> hearing what they deem orthodox teachers, going to prayer-meetings, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="212"/>There are again, others, who think, that grace is so free and so easy to be had, or in other words, that as they can have pardon for all kinds of sins, and that at any time whenever they please, they under this idea make very little conscience of running up large scores, to which practice I fear such doctrines as I noticed in my last, from the pen of Mr. Hill, have not a little contributed.</P>
<P>I have often thought that great hurt has been done to Society by the methodist preach∣ers, both in town and country, attending condemned Malefactors, as by their fanatical conversation, visionary hymns, bold and impious applications of the scriptures, &amp;c. many dreadful offenders against law and jus∣tice, have had their passions and imaginations so worked upon, that they have been sent to the other world in such raptures, as would better become martyrs innocently suffering in a glorious cause, than criminals of the first magnitude.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="213"/>A great number of narratives of these sud∣den conversions and triumphant exits have been compiled, many of them published, and circulated with the greatest avidity, to the private emolument of the editors, and doubt∣less to the great edification of all sinners, long habituated to a course of villainous depreda∣tions on the lives and properties of the honest part of the community; and many such ac∣counts as have not appeared in print, have been assiduously proclaimed in all the method∣ist chapels and barns, throughout the three kingdoms; by which the good and pious of every denomination have been scandalized, and notorious offenders encouraged to persevere, trusting sooner or later, to be honoured with a similar degree of notice, and thus by a kind of legerdemain be suddenly transformed into saints.</P>
<P>I must observe farther, that the unguarded manner in which the methodist preachers make tenders of pardon and salvation, has in∣duced
<PB N="183" REF="214"/>
many to join their fraternity, whose consciences wanted very large plaisters indeed! many of those had need to be put under courses of mortification and penance; but they generally adopt another method, and make themselves as ridiculous by affecting to possess squeamish consciences, as they had before rendered themselves odious by displaying a very opposite disposition. As a friend, per∣mit me to advise you never to purchase any thing at a shop where the master of it crams any of his pious nonsense into his shop-bill, &amp;c. as you may be assured you will nine times out of ten find them, in the end, errant hypo∣crites; and as such, they make no scruple of cheating in the way of trade, if possible.</P>
<P>This puts me in mind of one of these pious brethren in Petticoat-lane, who wrote in his shop-window, "Rumps and Burs sold here, and Baked Sheep's heads will be continued every night, <HI>if the Lord permit."</HI> The Lord had no objection; so Rumps, Burs, and Baked
<PB N="184" REF="215"/>
<HI>Sheeps-heads</HI> were sold there a long time. And I remember to have seen on a board, near Bedminster-down, "Tripe and Cowheels sold here as usual, except on the Lord's-day, which <HI>the Lord help me to keep."</HI> And on my enquiring about the person who exhibited this remarkable shew-board, at the inn just by, I was informed that the pious Tripe-seller generally got drunk on Sundays, after he re∣turn'd from the barn-preaching; which ac∣counts for his not selling tripe on that day, having full employment (though possibly not so inoffensive) elsewhere.</P>
<P>I also saw in a village near Plymouth in Devonshire, "Roger Tuttel, <HI>by God's grae and mercy,</HI> kills rats, moles, and all sorts of vermin and venomous creatures." But I need not have gone so far, as, no doubt you must remember that a few years since, a certain pious common-council-man of the Metropolis, advertised in the public papers for a porter that could carry <HI>three hundred</HI> weight and
<PB N="185" REF="216"/>
<HI>serve the Lord.</HI> Of the same worthy person∣age I have heard it asserted, that so very con∣scientious is he, that he once staved a barrel of beer in his cellar, because he detected it <HI>working</HI> on the Sabbath day.</P>
<Q><L>"Seeming devotion doth but gild the knave,</L>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is very remarkable, that while I was writing the last five lines of my former letter to you, on Wednesday the 2d of March 1791, I received the news of the death of Mr. John Wesley, who I am informed, died that morning at his own house, in the City-road, Moorfields, in the Eighty-eighth year
<PB N="187" REF="218"/>
of his age. He had no illness, but the wheels of the machine being worn out, it stopt of course. As I am on the subject of Method∣ism, I hope you will not deem it impertinent, if I devote a few lines to this great parent of a numerous sect, whom I well knew, and feel a pleasure in speaking of with some respect.</P>
<P>Several days preceding his interment, being laid in his coffin, in his gown and band, he was exposed to the view of his friends and the public; and I suppose that forty or fifty thou∣sand persons had a sight of him. But the concourse of people was so great, that many were glad to get out of the crowd without seeing him at all; and although many con∣stables were present, yet the pick-pockets contrived to ease numbers of their purses, watches, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To prevent as much as possible the dread∣ful effects of a mob, he was interred on Wed∣nesday March the 9th, between five and six
<PB N="188" REF="219"/>
o'clock in the morning, in the burial-ground behind his own chapel in the City-road. After which Dr. Whitehead (the physician) preach∣ed his funeral sermon; but notwithstanding the early hour, many thousands attended more than the chapel would hold, although it is very large.</P>
<P>As soon as it was known that Mr. Wesley was deceased, a number of needy brethren deemed it a fair opportunity of profiting by it, and each immediately set his ingenuity to work to compose what he chose to call a <HI>Life</HI> of him; and for some weeks since the funeral the Chapel-yard and its vicinity has exhibited a truly ludicrous scene, on every night of preaching, owing to the different writers and venders of these hasty performances exerting themselves to secure a good sale; one bawling out, that <HI>his</HI> is the <HI>right</HI> life, a second with a pious shake of the head, declares <HI>his</HI> the real life, a third protests <HI>he</HI> has got the <HI>only genuine</HI> account; and a fourth calls them all
<PB N="189" REF="220"/>
vile cheats and impostors, &amp;c. so that between all these competitors, the saints are so divided and perplexed in their opinions, that some de∣cline purchasing either, others willing "to try all and keep that which is good," buy of each of these respectable venders of the life and last account of that celebrated character; while the uninterested passenger is apt to form a conclusion that the house of prayer, is again become a den of thieves. Thus we see those holy candidates for heaven are so influenced by self-interest, that it
<Q><L>"Turns meek and secret sneaking ones</L>
<L>"To Raw-heads fierce and bloody bones."</L>
<BIBL>Hudibras.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>I cannot help thinking that Mr. John Wesley, the Father of the Methodists, was one of the most respectable enthusiasts that ever lived; as he unquestionably believed all that he taught others, and lived the same truly pious exemplary life, that he would have his followers practise. The sale of his
<PB N="190" REF="221"/>
numerous writings produced nett profits to the amount of near two THOUSAND POUNDS per annum; and the weekly collection of the classes in London and Westminster amounted to about a THOUSAND POUNDS per annum; be∣sides this, great sums were collected at the sacraments and love-feasts, for quarterly tic∣kets, private and publick subscriptions, &amp;c. &amp;c. The same kind of collections are made in all his Societies throughout the three king∣doms, so that Mr. Wesley might have amassed an immense fortune, had riches been his ob∣ject. But instead of accumulating wealth, he expended all his own private property: and I have been often informed, from good au∣thority, that he never denied relief to a poor person that asked him. To needy tradesmen I have known him to give ten or twenty pounds at once. In going a few yards from his study to the pulpit, he generally gave away an handful of half-crowns to poor old people of his Society. He was indeed charitable to an
<PB N="191" REF="222"/>
extreme, as he often gave to unworthy objects, nor would he keep money sufficient to hold out on his journies. One of his friends in∣forms me that he left but £4. 10s. 0. behind him: and I have heard him declare that he would not die worth twenty pounds, except his Books for sale, &amp;c.</P>
<P>His learning and great abilities are well known. But I cannot help noticing that in one of his publications (stepping out of his line) he betray'd extreme weakness and cre∣dulity, though no doubt his intentions were good. What I allude to is his <HI>"Primitive Physic;"</HI> a work certainly of a dangerous ten∣dency, as the majority of remedies therein prescribed are most assuredly inefficacious, and many of them very dangerous, if administred. The consequence of the first is, that while poor ignorant people are trying these remedies, (besides the very great probability of their mis∣taking the case) the diseases perhaps become so inveterate as to resist the power of more
<PB N="192" REF="223"/>
efficacious remedies properly applied, and with regard to those of a highly dangerous nature, how rash to trust them in the hands of such uninformed people as this book was almost solely intended for, especially when sanctioned by the name of an author whose influence impressed the minds of the unfor∣tunate patients with the most powerful con∣viction. Many fatal effects, I fear, have been produced by a blind adherence to this com∣pilation; which carries with it more the ap∣pearance of being the production of an ignorant opinionated old woman, than of the man of science and education. One melancholy in∣stance is fresh in my memory; a much esteem∣ed friend having fallen an immediate sacrifice to an imprudent application of one of these remedies.</P>
<P>A very worthy Pyhsician, to whom the Community are highly indebted for his inde∣fatigable and successful exertions in the cause of humanity, published some judicious re∣marks
<PB N="193" REF="224"/>
on the <HI>"Primitive Physic,"</HI> which however, for obvious seasons, did not meet with that general attention the subject de∣served; as almost all the admirers of Mr. Wesley's work consisted of his followers, (sufficiently numerous indeed to ensure a very extensive sale) these were too bigoted to con∣descend to peruse any production tending to enlighten their understandings; and the pub∣lic at large, not having paid much attention to it; did not conceive themselves so materi∣ally interested in the Remarks.</P>
<P>Should you, my dear friend, be desirous of perusing a variety of remedies, equally <HI>judici∣ous</HI> as well as <HI>efficacious</HI> with those of Mr. Wesley, you will meet with ample satisfaction by turning to <HI>"Dom Pernetty's Voyage to the Falkland Islands"</HI> page 153 to 162.</P>
<P>It was a circumstance peculiarly happy for the practitioners of Physic, though no doubt a terrible misfortune to the public, that the difference in religious principles of these two
<PB N="194" REF="225"/>
reverend gentlemen proved an effectual bar to the union of their medical abilities, which appear so exactly correspondent; had such an event taken place, that horrid monster <HI>Disease</HI> might by this time have been banished from the earth, and the sons of Aesculapius would be doomed to feed on their own compositions or starve!</P>
<P>But here, though the subject is serious, I think I see you smile at my censuring Mr. Wesley for <HI>stepping out of his line,</HI> when at the very moment I am committing the same error by obtruding my judgment upon the science of Physic.—I shall only reply, Many thought I did the same when I commenced Bookseller; and a friend once taught me the motto, (be not offended, 'tis the only scrap of Latin I shall give you) <HI>"Ne Sutor ultra crepidam."</HI> But the event has proved it otherwise, and I flatter myself every candid and judicious per∣son capable of judging will think with me on the above subject.—But to resume my narra∣tive.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="226"/>What a pity that such a character as Mr. Wesley should be a dupe and a rank enthu∣siast! however we may safely affirm that he was a good sincere and honest one, who deni∣ed himself many things; and thought that he disregarded the praise and blame of the world, when he was more courted, respected, and fol∣lowed than any man living, and he ruled over near an hundred thousand people with an almost absolute sway. I am inclined to believe that his death will be attended with consequences somewhat similar to those which followed the death of Alexander the great. His spiritual ge∣nerals will be putting in their pretensions, and soon divide their master's conquests. His death happened at a time rather critical to the methodists, as the <HI>Swedenborgians,</HI> or <HI>New Jerusalemists,</HI> are gaining ground very fast: Many of the methodists are already gone over to their party, many more will now, undoubt∣edly follow; and the death of that great fe∣male champion of methodism, the Countess
<PB N="196" REF="227"/>
of Huntingdon, which has since happened, will in all probability occasion another consi∣derable defection from <HI>that</HI> branch of metho∣dists, and an additional reinforcement to the Swedenborgians; a proof of the fondness of mankind for novelty, even in religious matters.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH Mr. Wesley was possessed of a very great share both of natural and acquired abilities, yet I suppose it scarcely necessary to inform you, that this is by no means the case with his preachers in general: For although there are amongst them some truly sensible, intelligent men, yet the major part are very ignorant and extremely illiterate: many of these excellent spiritual guides can∣not even read a chapter in the Bible, though containing the deep mysteries which they have the rashness and presumption to pretend
<PB N="198" REF="229"/>
to explain. Many others cannot write then own names. But so great is the ignorance of Mr. Wesley's people in general, that they often neglect the more rational and sensible of their preachers, and are better pleased with such as are even destitute of common sense; really believing that the incoherent nonsense which they from time to time pour forth, is dictated by the Holy Spirit; for which several reasons may be assigned.</P>
<P>It is always observable, that the more igno∣rant people are, the more confidence they pos∣sess. This confidence, or <HI>impudence,</HI> passes with the vulgar, as a mark of their being in the right; and the more the ignorance of the preachers is discovered, the more are they brought down to their own standard. Again, the more ignorant preachers having very con∣tracted ideas of real religion and manly vir∣tue, of course supply the want of it with a ridiculous fuss about trifles, which passes with the ignorant for a more sanctified deportment,
<PB N="199" REF="230"/>
and hence arises much of the mischief which has been so justly charged on the Methodists. For by making the path to Heaven so very narrow, many despairing to be ever able to walk in it, have thrown off all religion and morality, and sunk into the abyss of vice and wickedness. Others have their tempers so soured as to become lost to all the tender connexions of husband, wife, father, child, &amp;c. really believing that they are <HI>literally</HI> to <HI>hate</HI> father, mother, &amp;c. for Christ's sake. Many have in a fit of despondency put a period to their existence, it having become a burthen too intolerable to be borne. Some have been so infatuated with the idea of fast∣ing to mortify the flesh, that their strict per∣severance in it has been productive of the most serious consequences: Two instances of which lately occurred in one family, in the City road—The Mistress was deprived of her senses, and the Maid <HI>literally</HI> fasted herself to death!</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="231"/>A few years since, I saw in a field, not seven miles from town, a man tossing up his Bible in the air. This he often repeated, and raved at a strange rate. Amongst other things, (pointing to a building at some distance) <Q>“<HI>That</HI> (said he) is the <HI>Devil</HI>'s House, and it ”shall not stand three days longer!</Q> On the third day after this I saw with surprize an account in one of the public papers of that very building having been set on fire, and burnt to the ground.</P>
<P>This maniac soon after preached very often in Smithfield and Moorfields; but he did not wholly depend on the operations of the holy spirit, as at last he seldom began to preach until he was nearly drunk, or filled with another kind of spirit, and then he was "a very powerful preacher indeed." But the good man happening several times to exert himself rather too much, had nearly tumbled headlong out of his portable pulpit, these ac∣cidents the mob <HI>uncharitably</HI> ascribed to the
<PB N="201" REF="232"/>
liquor that he had drank, and with mud, stones, dead cats, &amp;c. drove him off every time he came, until at last our preacher took his leave of them with saying "that he per∣ceived it was in vain to attempt their conver∣sion, as he saw that God had given them over to the hardness of their hearts."</P>
<P>But although this holy man deserted them, yet other spiritual knights-errant were not wanting, so that a little time before the heaps of stones which lay for years in Moor∣fields were removed for the purpose of build∣ing on the spot, I have seen five or six in a day preaching their initiation sermons from those elevated situations, until they could col∣lect a sufficient sum of money to purchase pulpits. Some of these excellent preachers re∣ceived the whole of their divine education and took up their degrees in Moorfields, and in due time, after having given ample and satisfactory proofs of being properly qualified, have been admitted to professorships in the noble College
<PB N="202" REF="233"/>
situated on the south side of those fields, gene∣rally known by the name of <HI>Bethlem.</HI> You must know, sir, that many of the lazy sort of the community set up stalls in Moorfields to buy and sell apples, old iron, &amp;c. several of these having heard many such edifying dis∣courses▪ as they sat at their stalls, and observ∣ing the success which those kind of preach∣ers met with, boldly resolved to make trial of their spiritual gifts on the heaps of stones, and have now totally abandoned their stalls, and are gone forth as embassadors of heaven, tho' without being furnished with any diplomas as such. One of these who cannot read, lately in∣formed me that he had quitted all temporal concerns for the good of poor ignorant sinners. However after all, "there is (possibly) a plea∣sure in being mad, which none but madmen know." The subject of methodism is so fer∣tile a one, that were I disposed to enlarge thereon, my correspondence would be extend∣ed to a very considerable length; but instead
<PB N="203" REF="234"/>
of pursuing it, I think it better to apologize for having so long digressed from the main sub∣ject of my narrative. I therefore take a final leave of methodism, with assuring you, that in giving a general idea of the tenets and prac∣tices of a numerous sect who have excited much public attention, I have invariably had in view to "speak of them as they are: no∣thing to extenuate, nor set down ought in malice."

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY new wife's attachment to books was a very fortunate circumstance for us both, as it was not only a perpetual source of ratio∣nal amusement, but also as it tended to pro∣mote my trade; her extreme love for books made her delight to be in the shop, where she soon became perfectly acquainted with every part of it, and (as my stock increased) with other rooms where I kept books; and could readily get any article that was asked for. So that when I was out on business, my shop was well attended; this constant attention and good usage procured me many customers, and I soon perceived that I could sell double and treble the
<PB N="205" REF="236"/>
quantity of books if I had a larger stock. But how to enlarge it, I knew not, except by slow degrees, as my profits should enable me; for as I was almost a stranger in London, I had but few acquaintances, and these few were not of the opulent sort. I also saw that the town abounded with cheats, swindlers, &amp;c. who under false pretences obtained money and other property, of which the credulous were defrauded, which often prevented me from endeavouring to borrow, lest I should be sus∣pected of having the same bad designs.</P>
<P>Soon after I commenced bookseller, I became acquainted with what Pope calls "the noblest work of God," an HONEST man. This was Mr. JOHN DENIS, an oil-man in Cannon-street, (father of the present Mr. John Denis, Book∣seller.) This gentleman had often visited me during my long illness, and having seen me tranquil and serene when on the very point of death, he formed a favourable conclusion that I too must be an honest man, as I had so quiet
<PB N="206" REF="237"/>
a conscience at such an awful period. Having retained these ideas of me after my recovery, and being perfectly well acquainted with my circumstances, he one day offered to become a partner in my business, and to advance mo∣ney in proportion to my stock. This confi∣dential offer I soon accepted, early in 1778 he became partner, and we very soon laid out his money in second hand books, which encreased the stock at once to double.</P>
<P>I soon after this proposed printing a Sale Catalogue, to which, after making a few ob∣jections, Mr. Denis consented. This Cata∣logue of Twelve thousand volumes (such as they were) was published in 1779. My partner's name was not in the title-page, the address was only J. LACKINGTON &amp; Co. No. 46, Chiswell-street. This our first pub∣lication produced very opposite effects on those who perused it; in some it excited much mirth, in others an equal proportion of anger. The major part of it was written by me, but
<PB N="207" REF="238"/>
Mr. Denis wrote many pages of it; and as his own private library consisted of scarce old mystical and alchymical books, printed above a century ago, many of them were in bad condition; this led him to insert <HI>neat</HI> in the Catalogue to many articles, which were only neat when compared with such as were in very bad condition; so that when we produc∣ed such books as were called <HI>neat</HI> in our Cata∣logue, we often got ourselves laughed at, and sometimes our <HI>neat</HI> articles were heartily damn'd. We had also a deal of trouble on another score: Mr. Denis inserted a number of articles without the author's names, and assured me that the books were well known, and to mention the authors was often useless. The fact was, Mr. Denis knew who wrote those articles; but was soon convinced that many others did not, as we were often obliged to produce them merely to let our customers see who were the authors: we however took twenty pounds the first week the books were on sale,
<PB N="208" REF="239"/>
which we thought a large sum. The increase stock augmented our customers in proportion, so that Mr. Denis finding that his money turn'd to a better account in Bookselling than in the Funds, he very soon lent the stock near two hundred pounds, which I still turned to a good account. We went on very friendly and prosperously for a little more than two years, when one night Mr. Denis hinted that he thought I was making purchases too fast, on which I grew warm, and reminded him of an article in our partnership agreement by which I was to be sole purchaser, and was at liberty to make what purchases I should judge proper. I also reminded him of the profits which my purchases produced, and he reminded me of his having more money in the trade than I had. We were indeed both very warm, and on my saying, that if he was displeased with any part of my conduct, he was at liberty to quit the partnership, he in great warmth replied that he would. The above
<PB N="209" REF="240"/>
passed at Mr. Denis's house in Hoxton-square, I then bade him good night; when Mr. De∣nis called at the shop the next day, he asked me if I continued in the same mind I was in the preceding night? I assured him that I did. He then demanded of me whether I in∣sisted on his keeping his word to quit the partnership? I replied, I did not <HI>insist</HI> on it, as I had taken him a partner for three years, nearly one third part of which time was un∣expired; but, I added, that, as I had always found him strictly a man of his word, I sup∣posed he would prove himself so in the present instance, and not assert one thing at night and another in the morning. On which he ob∣served that as he was not provided with a shop, he must take some time to look for one. I told him that he might take as long a time as he thought necessary. This was in March 1780. He appointed the twentieth of May, following. On that day we accordingly dis∣solved the partnership, and as he had more
<PB N="210" REF="241"/>
money in the trade than myself, he took my notes for what I was deficient. We parted it great friendship, which continued to the day of his death; he generally called every morning to see us, and learn our concerns, and we con∣stantly informed him of all that had passed the preceding day; as how much cash we had taken, what were the profits, what purchases we had made, what bills we had to pay, &amp;c. and he sometimes lent me money to help to pay them.</P>
<P>At his death he left behind him in his pri∣vate library the best collection of scarce valua∣ble, mystical, and alchymical books that ever was collected by one person. In his lifetime he prized these kind of books above every thing; in collecting them he never cared what price he paid for them. This led him to think, after he became a bookseller, that other book-collectors should pay their money as freely as he had done his, which was often a subject of debate between him and me, as

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was sometime in the year seventeen hun∣dred and eighty, that I resolved from that period to give no person whatever any credit. I was induced to make this resolution from various motives: I observed that where credit was given, most bills were not paid within six months, many not within a twelvemonth, and some not within two years. Indeed many tradesmen have accounts of seven years
<PB N="213" REF="244"/>
standing; and some bills are never paid. The losses sustained by the interest of money in long credits, and by those bills that were not paid at all; the inconveniences attending not hav∣ing the ready-money to lay out in trade to the best advantage; together with the great loss of time in keeping accounts, and collecting debts, convinced me, that if I could but estab∣lish a ready-money business, <HI>without any ex∣ceptions,</HI> I should be enabled to sell every arti∣cle very cheap. When I communicated my ideas on this subject to some of my acquaint∣ances, I was much laughed at and ridiculed; and it was thought, that I might as well attempt to rebuild the tower of Babel, as to establish a large business without giving credit. But notwithstanding this discouragement, and even <HI>You,</HI> my dear friend, expressing your doubts of the practicability of my scheme, I resolved to make the experiment; and I began it by marking in every book the lowest price that I would take for it; which being much
<PB N="214" REF="245"/>
lower than the common market prices, I no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only retained my former customers, but soo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> increased their numbers. But, my dear sir you can scarce imagine what difficulties I en∣countered for several years together. I even sometimes thought of relinquishing this my favourite scheme altogether, as by it I was obliged to deny credit to my very acquaintance; I was also obliged to refuse it to the most respectable characters, as <HI>no exception</HI> was, or now is made, not even in favour of Nobility; my porters being strictly enjoined, by one general order, to bring back all books not previously paid for, excepting they receive the amount on delivery. Again many in the country found it difficult to remit small sums that are below Bankers notes, and others to whom I was a stranger, did not like to send the money first, as not knowing how I should treat them, and suspecting by the price of the articles, there must certainly be some deception. Many unacquainted with my plan
<PB N="215" REF="246"/>
of business, were much offended, until the advantages accruing to them from it were duly explained, when they very readily ac∣ceded to it. As to the anger of such, who though they were acquainted with it, were still determined to deal on credit only, I con∣sidered that as of little consequence, from an opinion that some of them would have been as much enraged when their bills were sent in, had credit been given them.</P>
<P>I had also difficulties of another nature to en∣counter; when first I began to sell very cheap, many came to my shop prepossessed against my goods, and of course often saw faults where none existed, so that the best editions were merely from prejudice deemed very bad editions, and the best bindings said to be infe∣rior workmanship, for no other reason, but because I sold them so cheap; and I often re∣ceived letters from the country, to know if such and such articles were <HI>really</HI> as I stated them in my catalogues, and <HI>if they</HI> REALLY
<PB N="216" REF="247"/>
<HI>were the best editions, if</HI> REALLY <HI>in calf; and</HI> REALLY <HI>elegantly bound</HI>; and many other <HI>reallys.</HI> Oh my friend! I <HI>really</HI> was afraid for some years that I should be <HI>really</HI> mad with vexation. But these letters of <HI>reallys</HI> have for years happily ceased, and the public are now <HI>really</HI> and thoroughly convinced that I will not assert in my catalogues what is not <HI>really</HI> true. But imagine, if you can, what I must have felt, on hearing the very best of goods depreciated, on no other account whatever, but because they were not charged at a higher price.</P>
<P>It is also worth observing, that there were not wanting among the booksellers, some who were mean enough to assert that all my books were bound in sheep; and many other unmanly artifices were practised, all of which so far from injuring me, as basely intended, turned to my account; for when gentlemen were brought to my shop by their friends, to purchase some trifling article, or were led
<PB N="217" REF="248"/>
into it by curiosity, they were often very much surprised to see many thousand volumes in ele∣gant and superb bindings. The natural con∣clusion was, that if I had not held forth to the Public better terms than others, I should not have been so much envied. So that whe∣ther I am righteous or not, all these afflic∣tions have worked together for my good. But I assure you, that my temporal salvation was not effected without <HI>"conditions."</HI> As every envious transaction was to me an additional spur to exertion, I am therefore not a little indebted to Messrs.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the first three years after I refused to give credit to any person, my business increased much, and as the whole of my profit (after paying all expences) was laid out in books, my stock was continually enlarged, so that my Catalogues in the year Seventeen hundred and eighty-four, were very much augmented in size. The first contained Twelve thousand, and the second thirty thousand volumes: this increase was not merely in numbers, but also in value, as a very great part of these volumes were <HI>better,</HI> that is, books of an higher price. But notwithstanding the great increase of my business, I still met with many difficulties on
<PB N="219" REF="250"/>
account of my selling books cheap; one of these I confess I did not foresee: as the more con∣vinced the public were of my acting strictly conformable to the plan I had adopted, the more this objection gained ground, and even to the present day is not <HI>entirely</HI> done away. This diffi∣culty was, In making private purchases of libra∣ries and parcels of books, many of my customers for several years had no objection to <HI>buying</HI> of me because I sold cheap, but were not equally inclined to <HI>sell</HI> me such books as they had no use for, or libraries that were left them at the death of relations, &amp;c. They reasoned (very plausibly, it must be confessed) thus: <Q>“Lack∣ington sells very cheap; he therefore will not give much for what is offered him for sale. I will go to those who sell very dear; as the more they sell their books for, the ”more they can afford to give for them.</Q></P>
<P>This mode of reasoning, however specious it seems at first, will on due reflection appear nugatory and erroneous, for the following rea∣sons;</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="251"/>I believe no one ever knew or heard of a covetous man that would sell his goods <HI>cheap:</HI> But every one has heard of such characters selling <HI>very dear</HI>; and when a covetous per∣son makes a purchase, is it likely that he should offer a generous price? Does he not when buying possess the same avaritious tem∣per as when selling? And on the other hand, I cannot help thinking (I am aware of the inference) that one who has been con∣stantly selling cheap for a series of years must possess some degree of generosity; and that this disposition has prevailed in me when I have been called to purchase libraries or par∣cels of books, thousands in the three king∣doms can witness. And however paradoxical it may appear, I will add, that I can afford to give more for books now, than I could if I sold them much dearer. For, were I to sell them dear, I should be ten times longer in selling them; and the warehouse-room, in∣surance from fire, and the interest of the
<PB N="221" REF="252"/>
money lying long in a dead stock, would pre∣vent my giving a large price when books were offered for sale.</P>
<P>But it did not appear in this point of view to the public in the more early stages of my business, until being often sent for after other booksellers had made offers for libraries, and finding that I would give more than they had offered, it was communicated from one to ano∣ther until it became publickly known; and the following method which I adopted some years since has put the matter beyond the shadow of a doubt.</P>
<P>When I am called upon to purchase any libra∣ry or parcel of books, either myself or my as∣sistants carefully examine them, and if desired to fix a price, I mention at a word the utmost that I will give for them, which I always take care shall be as much as any bookseller can afford to give: but if the seller entertains any doubt respecting the price offered, and chooses to try other booksellers, he pays me
<PB N="222" REF="253"/>
five per cent. for valuing the books; and as he knows what I have valued them at, he tries among the trade, and when he finds that he cannot get any greater sum offered, on re∣turning to me, he not only receives the price I at first offered, but also a return of the five per cent. which was paid me for the valua∣tion.</P>
<P>But to such as fix a price on their own books I make no charge.</P>
<P>This equitable mode I have the pleasure to find has given the public the utmost satis∣faction.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I was first initiated into the vari∣ous manoeuvres practised by booksellers, I found it customary among them, (which practice still continues) that when any books had not gone off so rapidly as expected, or so fast as to pay for keeping them in store, they would put what remained of such articles into private sales, where only booksellers are ad∣mitted, and of them only such as were in∣vited by having a catalogue sent them. At one of these sales I have frequently seen Seventy or eighty thousand volumes sold after dinner, including books of every description,
<PB N="224" REF="255"/>
bad and indifferent; by this means they were distributed through the trade.</P>
<P>When first invited to these Trade-sales, I was very much surprised to learn, that it was common for such as purchased remainders, to destroy one half or three fourths of such books, and to charge the full publication price, or nearly that, for such as they kept on hand; for a short time I cautiously complied with this custom.</P>
<P>But I soon began to reflect that many of these books so destroyed, possessed much me∣rit, and only wanted to be better known; and that if others were not worth six shillings, they were worth three or two, and so in proportion for high<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r or lower priced books.</P>
<P>From that time I resolved not to destroy any books that were worth saving, but to sell them off at half, or a quarter of the publi∣cation prices. By selling them in this cheap manner, I have disposed of many hundred thousand volumes, many thousands of which
<PB N="225" REF="256"/>
have been intrinsically worth their original prices. This part of my conduct, however, though evidently highly beneficial to the com∣munity, created me many enemies among the trade; some of the meaner part of whom, in∣stead of attending to the increase of their own business, aimed at reducing mine; and by a variety of pitiful insinuations and dark inu∣endoes, straining every nerve to injure the reputation I had already acquired with the Public, determined, (as they <HI>wisely</HI> conclud∣ed) thus to effect my ruin; which indeed they daily prognosticated, with a demon-like spirit, must inevitably very speedily follow. This conduct, however, was far from inti∣midating me, as the effect proved directly op∣posite to what they expected, and I found the respect and confidence of the Public con∣tinually increasing, which added very consi∣derably to the number of my customers: It being an unquestionable fact, that before I adopted this plan, great numbers of persons
<PB N="226" REF="257"/>
were very desirous of possessing some particu∣lar books, for which however (from various motives) they were not inclined to pay the original price; as some availed themselves of the opportunity of borrowing from a friend, or from a circulating library, or having once read them, though they held the works in esteem, might deem them too dear to purchase, or they might have a copy by them, which from their own and family's frequent use, (or lending to friends) might not be in so good a condition as they could wish, though rather than purchase them again at the full price, they would keep those they had; or again, they might be desirous to purchase them to make presents of; or they might have a com∣mission from a correspondent in the country, or abroad, and wish to gain a small profit on the articles for their trouble.</P>
<P>Thousands of others have been effectually prevented from purchasing, (though anxious so to do) whose circumstances in life would
<PB N="227" REF="258"/>
not permit them to pay the full price, and thus were totally excluded from the advantage of improving their understandings, and en∣joying a rational entertainment. And you may be assured, that it affords me the most pleasing satisfaction, independent of the emo∣luments which have accrued to me from this plan, when I reflect what prodigious numbers in inferior or <HI>reduced</HI> situations of life, have been essentially benefited in consequence of being thus enabled to indulge their natural propensity for the acquisition of knowledge, on easy terms: nay I could almost be vain enough to assert, that I have thereby been highly in∣strumental in diffusing that general desire for READING, now so prevalent among the inferior orders of society; which most certainly, if it does not prove equally instructive to all, keeps them from employing their time and money, if not to <HI>bad,</HI> at least to <HI>less rational</HI> purposes.</P>
<P>How happy should I have deemed myself in the earlier stage of my life, if I could have
<PB N="228" REF="259"/>
met with the opportunity which every on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> capable of reading may now enjoy, of obtain¦ing books at so easy a rate!

But after all, quere, Whether if I had enjoyed such an advantage, should I ever have thought of commencing bookseller?

<P>ALTHOUGH the result of the plan which I adopted for reducing the price of books, as mentioned in my last, was a vast increase of purchasers, yet at the same time I found a prodigious accumulation of my expences;
<PB N="230" REF="261"/>
which will not appear strange, when I inform you that I made proportionably large pur∣chases, such as two hundred copies of one book, three hundred of another, five hun∣dred of a third, a thousand of a fourth, two thousand of a fifth, nay sometimes I have purchased six thousand copies of one book, and at one time I had no less than TEN THOU∣SAND COPIES of Watts's Psalms, and the same number of his Hymns in my possession. In ad∣dition to these, I purchased very large numbers of many thousand different articles, at trade∣sales of all sorts, as bankrupt sales, sales of such as had retired from business, others caused by deaths of booksellers, sales to reduce large stocks, annual sales, &amp;c. &amp;c. not to reckon those purchased of authors and town and coun-booksellers, by private contract, &amp;c. to a very considerable amount. My expences were also ex∣ceedingly increased by the necessity I was under of keeping each article in a variety of different kinds of bindings, to suit the various tastes of
<PB N="231" REF="262"/>
my customers: Besides paying my bills for the above, I was always obliged to find ready mo∣ney to pay for libraries and parcels of second∣hand books, which after a while poured in upon me from town and country. So that I often look back with astonishment at my courage (or temerity, if you please) in pur∣chasing, and my wonderful success in taking money sufficient to pay the extensive de∣mands that were perpetually made upon me, as there is not another instance of success so rapid and constant under such circumstances. Some indeed there have been, who for two or three years, purchased away very fast, but could not persevere, as they were unable to sell with equal rapidity: for no one that has not a quick sale can possibly succeed with large numbers. For supposing that a book∣seller expends a thousand pounds in the pur∣chase of four articles (I have often done that in one article) and these are bought at a quar∣ter the usual price, the interest of the money is fifty pounds a year; besides which some al∣lowance
<PB N="232" REF="263"/>
must be made for warehouse-room, insurance from fire, &amp;c. so that granting he might sell a few of each article every year at four times the pricehe first gave for them, yet if he does not sell enough to pay the interest and other expences of those that remain, he is, after all, on the losing side; which has been the case with the major part of such as have purchased a large number of one book.</P>
<P>For several years together I thought I should be obliged to desist from purchasing a large number of any one article; for although by not giving any credit I was enabled to sell very cheap, yet the heavy stock of books in sheets often disheartened me, so that I more than once resolved to leave off purchasing all such articles where the number was very large. But, somehow or other, a torrent of business suddenly poured in upon me on all sides, so that I very soon forgot my resolution of not making large purchases, and now find my ac∣count in firmly adhering to that method; and
<PB N="233" REF="264"/>
being universally known for making large purchases, most of the Trade in town and country, and also authors of every description are continually furnishing me with opportuni∣ties. In this branch of trade it is next to im∣possible for me ever to have any formidable rivals, as it requires an uncommon exertion, as well as very uncommon success, and that for many years together, to rise to any great degree of eminence in that particular line. This success must be attained too, without the aid of <HI>novelty,</HI> which I found to be of very great service to me: And should any person begin on my plan and succeed extremely well, he could never supersede me, as I am still enlarging my business every year, and the more it is ex∣tended the cheaper I can afford to sell; so that though I may be pursued, I cannot be overtak∣en, except I should (as some others have done) be so infatuated and blinded by prosperity, as to think that the Public would continue their favors, even though the plan of business were
<PB N="234" REF="265"/>
reversed. But as the first king of Bohemia kept his country shoes by him, to remind him from whence he was taken, I have put a mot∣to on the doors of my carriage, constantly to remind me to what I am indebted for my prosperity, viz.

or as it has been <HI>kindly</HI> written for me,

<P>IT has been asked, times innumerable, how I acquired a tolerable degree of knowledge, so as to enable me to form any ideas of the merits or demerits of books; or how I became suffi∣ciently acquainted with the prices that books were commonly sold for, so as to be able to buy
<PB N="236" REF="267"/>
and sell; particularly books in the learned and foreign languages. Many have thought that from the beginning I always kept shop∣men to furnish me with instructions necessary to carry on my business; but you and all my old friends and acquaintances well know that not to have been the case; as for the first thir∣teen years after I became a bookseller, I never had one shopman that knew any thing of the worth of books, or how to write a single page of a catalogue properly, much less to compile the whole. I always wrote them myself, so long as my health would permit: Indeed I con∣tinued the practice for years after my health was much impaired by too constant an appli∣cation to that and reading; and when I was at last obliged to give up writing them, I for seve∣ral catalogues stood by and dictated to others; even to the present time I take some little part in their compilation; and as I ever did, I still continue to fix the price to every book, except I am out of town. I have now many assistants
<PB N="237" REF="268"/>
in my shop, who can compile catalogues, buy, sell, and in short transact the major part of my business.</P>
<P>As to the little knowledge of literature I possess, I acquired that by dint of application. In the beginning I attached myself very close∣ly to the study of divinity and moral philoso∣phy; so that I became tolerably acquainted with all the points controverted between the Divines; after having read the great cham∣pions for Christianity, I next read the works of Lord Herbert, Tindal, Chubb, Morgan, Collins, Woolston, Annet, Mandeville, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, Williams, Voltaire, and many other Free-thinkers. I have also read most of our English poets, and the best translations of the Greek, Latin, Italian and French poets; nor did I omit History, Voyages, Travels, Natural History, Biography, &amp;c. At one time it was my intention to learn French, but as soon as I was enabled to make out and abridge title-pages, so as to insert them right
<PB N="238" REF="269"/>
in my catalogues, I left off for what appeared to me more pleasing as well as more necessary pursuits; considering that as I began so late in life, and had probably but a very short period to live, I had no time to bestow on the attainment of languages. I therefore content∣ed myself with reading all the translations of the classics, and inserting the originals in my Catalogues as well as I could; and when sometimes I happened to put the <HI>Genitive</HI> or <HI>Dative</HI> case instead of the <HI>Nominative</HI> or <HI>Accusative,</HI> my customers kindly considered this as a venial fault, which they readily pardoned, and bought the books notwith∣standing.</P>
<P>As I have indefatigably used my best en∣deavours to acquire knowledge, I never thought I had the smallest reason to be ashamed on ac∣count of any deficiency, especially as I never made pretensions to great erudition, or affect∣ed to possess what I knew I was deficient Dr. Young's couplet, you will therefore think
<PB N="239" REF="270"/>
equally applicable to many others as well as myself:</P>
<Q><L>"Unlearned men of books assume the care,</L>

<P>I had like to have forgot to inform you, that I have also read most of our best plays, and am so fond of the Theatre, that in the winter season I have often been at Drury-lane or Covent-garden four or five evenings in a week. Another great source of amusement as well as knowledge, I have met with in reading almost all the best novels; by the <HI>best,</HI> I mean those written by Cervantes, Fielding, Smollet, Richardson, Miss Burney, Voltaire, Sterne, Le Sage, Goldsmith, and others. And I have often thought, with Field∣ing, that some of those publications have given us a more genuine history of Man, in what are called Romances, than is sometimes to be found under the more respectable titles of His∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory, Biography, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="271"/>In order to obtain some ideas in Astronomy, Geography, Electricity, Pneumatics, &amp;c.

manual labour as a shoemaker, were inces∣santly employed in the improvement of his mind in various branches of science; in many of which he attained a proficiency, totally divested of that affectation of superi∣ority which little minds assume. These qualities rendered him respected by all who knew him, as an intelligent man, and a most agreeable companion. Among other acquisitions, ENTOMOLOGY was his pecu∣liar delight. Thus far the prospect is pleas∣ing. It is a painful task to add, that this amiable person fell a victim to an unhappy error in taking a medicine. The evening previous to his decease he spent in a philoso∣phical Society, of which he had many years been a member, and where his attendance had been constant; but finding himself in∣disposed, he in the morning early had re∣course to a phial of antimonial wine, which had long been in his possession, and of which only a small part remained. This,
<PB N="243" REF="274"/>
most unfortunately! he swallowed; and it having by long maceration, acquired an extraordinary degree of strength, and being rendered turbid by mixing with the metal∣lic particles, it produced the effect of a violent poison, occasioning almost instan∣taneous death. May his fate prove a warn∣ing to others to be careful how they ven∣ture to confide in their own judgement in so intricate a science as medicine!—His va∣luable cabinet of insects, both foreign and domestic, supposed to be one of the com∣pletest (of a private collection) in the king∣dom, all scientifically arranged with pecu∣liar neatness, and in the finest preservation, will (if it falls into proper hands,) remain a monument of his knowledge and ap∣plication.”</Q> — But to proceed.</P>
<P>I cannot help regretting the disadvantages I labor under by having been deprived of the benefits of an early education, as it is a loss can scarcely be repaired, in any situation. How
<PB N="244" REF="275"/>
much more difficult then was it for me to attain any degree of proficiency, when in∣volved in the concerns of a large business?

The instructions that I received from men and books were often like the seeds sown among thorns, the cares of the world choked them So that although I understand a little of many branches of literature, yet my knowledge is, af∣ter all, I freely confess, but superficial; which indeed I need not have told you. However, superficial as it is, it not only affords me an endless source of pleasure, but it has been of very great use to me in business, as it enabled me to put a value on thousands of articles, before I knew what such books were com∣monly sold at: 'tis true I was sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mistaken, and have sold a very great number of different articles much lower than I ought even on my own plan of selling very cheap
<PB N="245" REF="276"/>
yet that gave me no concern; But if I found out that I had (as sometimes was the case) sold any articles too dear, it gave me much uneasiness; for whether I had any other motives I will leave to such as are ac∣quainted with me to determine, but I reason∣ed thus; If I fell a book too dear, I perhaps lose that customer and his friends for ever, but if I sell articles considerably under their real value, the purchaser will come again and recommend my shop to his acquaintances, so that from the principles of self-interest I would sell cheap; I always was inclined to reason in this manner, and nine years since a very tri∣fling circumstance operated much upon my mind and fully convinced me my judgment was right on that head. Mrs. Lackington had bought a piece of linen to make me some shirts; when the linen-draper's man brought it into my shop, three ladies were present, and on seeing the cloth opened, asked Mrs. L. what it cost per yard: on being told the price, they
<PB N="246" REF="277"/>
all said it was very cheap, and each lady went and purchased the same quantity, to make shirts for their husbands, those pieces were again display'd to their acquaintances, so that the linen-draper got a deal of custom from that very circumstance; and I resolved to do likewise. However trifling this anecdote may appear, you will pardon me for introducing it, when you reflect that it was productive of very beneficial consequences, and that many great effects have arisen from as trivial causes.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT has been long since remarked, that a per∣son may be well acquainted with books, or in other words, may be a very learned man, and yet remain almost totally ignorant of men and manners. Hence many fine chimerical systems of Law, Government, &amp;c. have been spun out of the prolific brains of the learned, which have only served to amuse others as learned and as unacquainted with mankind as
<PB N="248" REF="279"/>
the authors, and have frequently produced a number of Replies, Observations, severe, (not to say scurrilous) Criticisms, and new Sys∣tems and Hypotheses; these again gave birth to fresh Remarks, &amp;c. <HI>ad—— (infinitum,</HI> I was going to say—but I beg pardon, having promised to give you no more Latin.) These learned men, after tiring themselves and the Public, have too often left them just as wise on the subject as when they began. The reading and studying of History, Voyages, Travels, &amp;c. will no doubt contribute much to that kind of knowledge, but will not alone be sufficient. In order to become a proficient in that useful branch of knowledge, "MAN, KNOW THYSELF!" was a precept of the an∣tient philosophers. But I can scarce think it possible for any man to be well acquainted with himself, without his possessing a tole∣rable degree of knowledge of the rest of mankind. In the former part of my life I saw a deal of what is called <HI>low life,</HI> and be∣came
<PB N="249" REF="280"/>
came acquainted with the customs, manners, dispositions, prejudices, &amp;c. of the labouring part of the community, in various cities, towns and villages; for years past, I have spent some of my leisure hours among that class of people who are called opulent or genteel tradesmen; nor have I been totally excluded from higher circles; but among all the schools where the knowledge of mankind is to be ac∣quired, I know of none equal to that of a <HI>bookseller's shop,</HI> especially if the master is of an inquisitive and communicative turn, and is in a considerable line of business: His shop will then be a place of resort for men, wo∣men, and children, of various nations, and of as various capacities, dispositions, &amp;c.</P>
<P>To adduce a few instances by way of illus∣tration: — Here you may find an old <HI>Bawd</HI> inquiring for "The Countess of Hunting∣don's Hymn-book; an old worn-out <HI>Rake,</HI> for "Harris's List of Covent-garden Ladies;" simple <HI>Simon,</HI> for "the Art of writing Love-letters;

<Q><L>Drinks larger draughts of the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> spring,</L>
<L>And likes a taste of every GOOD THING.</L></Q></P>
<P>But it would be an endless talk to set down the various and opposite articles that are con∣stantly called for in my shop. To talk to these different pursuers after happiness, or amuse∣ment, has given me much pleasure, and afforded me some knowledge of mankind, and also of Books: and to hear the debates that frequently occur between the different purchasers is a fine amusement; so that I have sometimes compared my shop to a stage. And I assure you that a variety of characters, strong∣ly mark'd constantly make their appearance.</P>
<P>Would my health permit my constant at∣tendance, I should prefer it, to every thing in life, and you may recollect that for some years I sought no other amusement whatever.</P>
<P>Having been long habituated to make re∣marks on whatever I saw or heard, is another reason why I have succeeded so well in my
<PB N="253" REF="284"/>
business. I have for the last seven years succes∣sively told my acquaintances before the year began, how much money I should take in the course of it, without once failing of tak∣ing the sum mentioned. I formed my judg∣ment by observing what kind of stock in trade I had in hand, and by considering how that stock was adapted to the different tastes and pursuits of the times; in doing this I was obliged to be pretty well informed of the state of politics in Europe, as I have always found that <HI>Book-selling</HI> is much affected by the political state of affairs. For as mankind are in search of amusement, they often take the first that of∣fers; so that if there is any thing is the news-papers of consequence, that draws many to the coffee-house, where they chat away the evenings, instead of visiting the shops of Booksellers (<HI>as they ought to do, no doubt</HI>) or <HI>reading</HI> at home. The best time for Book-selling, is when there is no kind of news stir∣ring; then many of those who for months
<PB N="254" REF="285"/>
would have done nothing but talk of war or peace, revolutions, and counter-revolutions, &amp;c. &amp;c. for want of other amusement will have recourse to Books; so that I have often experienced that the report of a war, or the tryal of a great man, or indeed any subject that attracts the public attention, has been some hundreds of pounds out of my pocket in a few weeks.</P>
<P>Before I conclude th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s letter, I cannot help observing, that the sale of books in general has increased prodigiously within the last twenty years. According to the best estimation I have been able to make, I suppose that more than four times the number of books are sold now than were sold twenty years since. The poorer sort of farmers, and even the poor coun∣try people in general, who before that period spent their winter evenings in relating stories of witches, ghosts, hobgoblins, &amp;c. now shorten the nights by hearing their sons and daughters read tales, romances, &amp;c. and on
<PB N="255" REF="286"/>
entering their houses, you may see Tom Jones, Roderick Random, and other entertaining books stuck up on their bacon racks, &amp;c. and if <HI>John</HI> goes to town with a load of hay, he is charged to be sure not to forget to bring home "Peregrine Pickle's adventures;" and when <HI>Dolly</HI> is sent to market to sell her eggs she is commissioned to purchase "The history of Pamela Andrews." In short all ranks and degrees now READ. But the most rapid in∣crease of the sale of books has been since the termination of the late war.</P>
<P>A number of book-clubs are also formed in every part of England, where each member subscribes a certain sum quarterly to purchase Books; in some of these clubs the Books after they have been read by all the subscribers, are sold among them to the highest bidders, and the money produced by such sale, is expended in fresh purchases, by which prudent and ju∣dicious mode, each member has it in his pow∣er to become possessed of the work of any par∣ticular
<PB N="256" REF="287"/>
author he may judge deserving a supe∣rior degree of attention; and the members at large enjoy the advantage of a continual suc∣cession of different publications, instead of being restricted to a repeated perusal of the same authors; which must have been the case if so rational a plan had not been adopted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday-Schools</HI> are spreading very fast in most parts of England, which will accelerate the diffussion of knowledge among the lower classes of the community, and in a very few years exceedingly increase the sale of Books. —Here permit me earnestly to call on every honest bookseller, (I trust my call will not be in vain,) as well as on every friend to the ex∣tension of knowledge, to unite (as <HI>You,</HI> I am confident will) in a hearty AMEN, with,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Public at large, booksellers in parti∣cular, have beheld my increasing stock with the utmost astonishment, they being in∣tirely at a loss to conceive by what means I have been enabled to make good all my pay∣ments; and for several years, in the beginning of my business, some of the trade repeatedly asserted, that it was totally impossible that I could continue to pay for the large numbers of books that I continually purchased; and nine years since, being induced to take a jour∣ney
<PB N="258" REF="289"/>
into my own country, with a view to the restoration of my health, which had been materially injured by intense application to catalogue-making, too much reading, &amp;c. during the six weeks that I retired into the west, Mrs Lackington was perpetually inter∣rogated respecting the time that I was expect∣ed to return. This was done in such a manner as evidently shewed that many thought I never intended to return at all. But how great was their surprize, when as a prelude to my re∣turn, I sent home several waggon loads of Books which I had purchased in the country.</P>
<P>As I never had any part of the <HI>miser</HI> in my composition, I always proportioned my ex∣pences according to my profits; that is, I have for many years expended two thirds of the profits of my trade; which proportion of expen∣diture I never exceeded. If you will please to re∣fer to Dr. Johnson's "Idler" for "The progress of Ned Drugget," you will there see much of the progress of your humble servant depicted.
<PB N="259" REF="290"/>
Like Ned, I in the beginning opened and shut my own shop, welcomed a friend by a shake of the hand, at the same time beckoning a∣cross the way for <HI>a pot of good porter.</HI> A few years after, I sometimes invited my friends to dinner, and provided them a roasted <HI>fillet of veal</HI>; in a progressive course the <HI>ham</HI> was introduced, and a <HI>pudding</HI> was the next addition made to the feast. For some time a glass of <HI>brandy and water</HI> was a luxury; a glass of Mr. Beaufoy's <HI>raisin wine</HI> succeeded; and as soon as <HI>two thirds</HI> of my profits enabled me to afford good <HI>red port,</HI> it immediately appeared:

But I assure you, my dear friend, that in every step of my progress, envy and malevolence has pursued me close.</P>

<PB N="261" REF="292"/>
but when Mrs Lackington mounted ano∣ther, "they were very sorry to see people so young in business run on at so great a rate!" The occasional relaxation enjoyed in the coun∣try was censured as an abominable piece of pride; but when the <HI>carriage</HI> and <HI>servants</HI> in <HI>livery</HI> appeared, "they would not be the first to hurt a foolish tradesman's character; but if (as was but too probable) the <HI>docket</HI> was not already struck, the gazette would soon settle that point."

It seems that at last they have discovered the secret springs from whence I drew my wealth; however they do not quite agree in their accounts, for although some can tell you the very <HI>number</HI> of my fortunate lottery ticket, others are as
<PB N="262" REF="293"/>
positive that I found bank-notes in an old book, to the amount of many thousand pounds, and if they please, can even tell you the title of the very fortunate old book that contained this treasure. But you shall receive it from me, which you will deem authority to the full as unexceptionable, I found the whole of what I am possessed of, in—SMALL PRO∣FITS, <HI>bound</HI> by INDUSTRY, and <HI>clasped</HI> by OECONOMY.</P>

Do you think that you can find customers enough so deficient in penetration as not to discover your characters? no such thing. Your exorbitant charges are a general subject of conversation and dislike: you cannot with confidence look
<PB N="263" REF="294"/>
your own customers in the face, as you are conscious of your meanness and imposition, and your sordid disposition is evidently the reason, that some gentlemen are led to look with con∣tempt and disdain on tradesmen.

tradesman, never to deviate from my old plan of giving as much for libraries as it is possible for a tradesman to give, and selling them and <HI>new</HI> publications also, for the same SMALL PROFITS that have been attended with such astonishing success for some years past. And I hope that my Assistants will also persevere in that attentive obliging mode of conduct which has so long distinguished No. 46, &amp; 47, Chiswell-street, Moorfields; conscious that should I ever be weak enough to adopt an op∣posite line of conduct, or permit those who act under my direction so to do, I should no longer meet with the very extraordinary encouragement and support which I have hitherto experienced; neither should I have the smallest claim to a continuance of it under such circumstances.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE open manner of stating my profits will no doubt appear strange to many who are not acquainted with my singular conduct in that and other respects. But you, Sir, know that I have for fourteen years past kept a strict account of my profits. Every book in my possession, before it is offered to sale is marked with a private mark, what it cost me, and with a public mark of what it is to be sold for; and every article, whether the price is six-pence or sixty pounds, is en∣tered in a day-book as they are sold, with the price it cost and the money it sold for: and
<PB N="266" REF="297"/>
each night the profits of the day are cast up by one of my shopmen, as every one of them understands my private marks. Every Satur∣day night the profits of the week are declared before all my shop-men, &amp;c. the week's pro∣fits, and also the expences of the week are then entered one opposite the other, in a book kept for the purpose: the whole sum taken in the week is also set down, and the sum that has been paid for books bought. These accounts are kept publickly in my shop, and ever have been so, as I never saw any reason for concealing them. By keeping an account of my profits, and also of my expences, I have always known how to regulate the latter by the former; and I have done that, without the trifling way of setting down a halfpenny∣worth of matches, or a penny for a turnpike. I have one person in the shop whose constant employment it is to receive all the cash, and discharge all bills that are brought for pay∣ment, and if Mrs. Lackington wants money
<PB N="267" REF="298"/>
for house-keeping, &amp;c. or if I want money for <HI>hobby-horses,</HI> &amp;c. we take five or ten gui∣neas, pocket it, and set down the sum taken out of trade as expended; when that is gone we repeat our application, but never take the trouble of setting down the <HI>items.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be improper here to take a little notice of some very late insinuations of my old envious <HI>friends.</HI> It has been suggested that I am grown <HI>immensely rich,</HI> and that having already more property than I can reasonably expect to live to expend, and no young fami∣ly to provide for, I for these reasons ought to decline my business, and no longer engross trade to myself that ought to be divided into a number of channels, and thus support many families. In answer to which I will observe, that some of these objectors were in trade be∣fore me, and when I first embarked in the profession of a bookseller, despised me for my mean beginning; and when afterwards I adopted my plan of selling cheap, and for
<PB N="268" REF="299"/>
ready money only, made themselves very merry at my expence, for expecting to suc∣ceed by so <HI>ridiculous</HI> a project, (as they in their consummate wisdom were pleased to term it) so that no doubt I ought to comply with any thing they desire, however unreasonable it may appear to me.</P>
<P>To deny that I have a competence, would be unpardonable ingratitude to the Public, to go no higher; but to insinuate that I am getting money for no good purpose, is false. The great apostle St. Paul, who was an hum∣ble follower of CHRIST, thought that he might be permitted to boast of himself a little; after which I suppose it will not be thought very presumptuous in me, if I should state a few facts, merely to justify my conduct in carrying on my trade beyond the time that certain per∣sons would prescribe to me.</P>
<P>It is now about five years since I began to entertain serious thoughts of going out of business on account of the bad state of health
<PB N="269" REF="300"/>
which both Mrs. Lackington and myself have laboured under; but it was then suggested by several of my friends, that as I had many poor relations, a great number of whom are children, others are old and nearly helpless, and that all had justly formed some expecta∣tions from me: therefore to give up such a trade as I was in possession of, before I was absolutely obliged to do it, would be a kind of <HI>injustice</HI> to those whom by the ties of blood I was in some measure bound to relieve and protect. These and other considerations in∣duced me to wave the thoughts of precipi∣tating myself out of so extensive and lucrative a business; and in the mean time I apply a part of the profits of it to maintain my good old Mother, who is alive at Wellington in Somersetshire, her native place. I have two aged men and one aged woman, whom I sup∣port: and I have also four children to main∣tain and educate, three of these children have lost their father, and also their mother, (who
<PB N="270" REF="301"/>
was my sister) the other child has both his parents living, but they are poor; many others of my relations are in the same circum∣stances, and stand in need of my assistance. But——
<Q><L>"Still the world prevails and its dread laughs,</L>
<L>"Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn."</L></Q></P>
<P>It has also been frequently said, that by selling my books very cheap, I have materially injured other booksellers both in town and country. But I still deny the charge: and here I will first observe, that I have as just a reason to complain of them for giving credit, as they can have for my selling cheap and giv∣ing <HI>no</HI> credit; as it is well known that there are many thousands of people every where to be found who will decline purchasing at a shop where credit is denied, when they can find many that will readily give it; and as I frequently lose customers who having always been used to have credit, will not take the trouble to pay for every article as sent home;
<PB N="271" REF="302"/>
these of course deal at those shops who follow the old mode of business; so that in such cases, I might say to the proprietors of these shops, <Q>“You ought not to give any person credit: because by so doing you are taking ”customers from me.</Q> As to my <HI>hurting the trade</HI> by selling <HI>cheap,</HI> they are, upon the whole mistaken; for although no doubt some instances will occur, in which they may ob∣serve that the preference is given to <HI>my</HI> shop, and the books purchased of me on account of their being cheap, they never consider how many books they dispose of on the very same account. As, however, this may ap∣pear rather paradoxical, I will explain my meaning farther:</P>
<P>I now sell more than one hundred thousand volumes annually; many who purchase part of these, do so solely on account of their cheap∣ness; many thousands of these books would have been destroyed, as I have before remark∣ed, but for my selling them on those very

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AMONGST the variety of occurrences with which I have endeavoured to entertain you, perhaps not all equally interesting (and the most material of them, I am duly sensible, not en∣titling me to the claim of being esteemed a writer possessed of the first abilities this age or nation has produced,) I recollect my not yet having given you an account of my TRAVELS. Possibly you might very readily pardon that omission, as from what has already appeared
<PB N="274" REF="305"/>
it must be evident, the engagements which from time to time have fully engrossed my attention, have not furnished me with any opportunity of making the tour of Europe, or tracing the source of the river Nile, much less circumnavigating the globe. And even sup∣posing I had been possessed both of the time and inclination for such extensive undertak∣ings, the disadvantages which I labour un∣der for want of having received a proper edu∣cation, would have disqualified me from ma∣king such remarks and observations as natu∣rally present themselves to those who have been fortunate enough to possess that advan∣tage, and of course are qualified to present the world with a variety of subjects equally curi∣ous and instructive; 'though it is not without reluctance I think it necessary here to observe, that some of these gentlemen, not content with giving a true account of what actually occurred to them, and supposing that plain matter of fact would not be sufficiently inte∣resting
<PB N="275" REF="306"/>
to excite that superior degree of atten∣tion and admiration which they were ambi∣tious as authors to acquire, they have thought proper to intermix so much of the <HI>marvellous</HI> into their narrations, as has been the occasion of many persons reading them with such diffi∣dence, as to doubt the truth of many rela∣tions, which though really strictly consistent with veracity, yet being novel and uncom∣mon, they were unwilling to credit, lest they should incur the censure of being possessed of a superior degree of weakness and credulity. This I am also confident has induced many a modest author to omit passages, which though really true, he was cautious of publishing, from a fear of being subjected to the same se∣vere animadversions, or what is still worse, being suspected of wilfully imposing on his readers. Recent instances of which, were it necessary, I could adduce; but I shall proceed with cautioning you from being alarmed lest I should fall into either of these errors; no∣thing
<PB N="276" REF="307"/>
<HI>very marvellous</HI> will occur in what I mean to present you with; though I shall not be intimidated from relating <HI>real facts,</HI> from the apprehension of not being credited. As an additional recommendation, (no doubt) the history of my travels will be interspersed with such remarks on <HI>men</HI> and <HI>manners</HI> as have presented themselves to me during my peregrinations; and this I previously warn you, will be done in my "accustomed desul∣tory manner," from which as Mr. <HI>Pennant</HI> says in his—<HI>"Of London,"</HI> (there is a concise title-page for you) I am too old to depart," that is, as Dr. <HI>Johnson</HI> might possibly have explained it, "Sir, you are then too old to MEND." But you, my dear friend, are not so fastidious a critic: although you may find the whole very <HI>dull,</HI> it shall not be very <HI>long</HI>; so that if it does not act as a cordial to enliven your spi∣rits, it may (if read in the evening) prove a powerful <HI>narcotic,</HI> and afford you some plea∣sing dreams, when <Q><PB N="277" REF="308"/>
<L>"Tir'd nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep,</L>
<L>"His ready visit pays."</L></Q>
I shall therefore not trouble you with a detail of bad roads, the impositions of innkeepers, what food I partook of, how many bottles of wine were drank, the height of steeples, &amp;c. a sufficiency of this, I trust, has already ap∣peared in different writers. Thus much by way of preparation for my journies. I now set out.</P>
<P>In <HI>September,</HI> Seventeen hundred and eighty-seven, I set off for Edinburgh; and in all the principal towns through which I passed, was led from a motive of curiosity, as well as with a view towards obtaining some valuable purcha∣ses, to examine the Booksellers shops for scarce and curious books; but although I went by the way of York, Newcastle upon Tyne, &amp;c. and returned through Glasgow, Carlisle, Leeds, Lancaster, Preston, Manchester, and other considerable places, I was much surpri∣zed, as well as disappointed, at meeting with
<PB N="278" REF="309"/>
very few of the works of the most esteemed authors; and those few consisted in general of ordinary editions, besides an assemblage of common trifling books, bound in sheep, and that too in a very bad manner. It is true, at York and Leeds there were a few (and but very few) good books; but in all the other towns between London and Edinburgh no∣thing but trash was to be found: in the latter city indeed, a few capital articles are kept, but in no other part of Scotland.</P>
<P>In Seventeen hundred and ninety, I re∣peated my journey, and was much mortified to be under a necessity of confirming my for∣mer observations. This remarkable deficien∣cy in the article of books, is however not pe∣culiar to the northern parts of England; as I have repeatedly travelled into the western parts, and found abundant cause for disatisfac∣tion on the same account, so that I may ven∣ture without fear of contradiction to assert, that London, as in all other articles of com∣merce,
<PB N="279" REF="310"/>
is likewise the grand emporium of Great Britain for books, engrossing nearly the whole of what is valuable in that very exten∣sive, beneficial, and I may add lucrative branch of trade. As to Ireland, I shall only observe, that if the booksellers in that part of the empire do not shine in the possession of va∣luable books, they must certainly be allowed to possess superior industry in reprinting the works of every english author of merit, as soon as published, and very liberally endeavouring to disseminate them, in a surreptitious manner through every part of our Island, though the attempt frequently proves abortive, to the great loss and injury of the projectors.</P>
<P>At Newcastle, I passed a day or two in the year 1787, where I was much delighted with viewing a singular phoenomenon in natural his∣tory, namely the celebrated <HI>crows-nest</HI> affixed above the weather-cock, on the upper extre∣mity of the steeple in the market-place. In the year 1783, as I was well informed, the crows
<PB N="280" REF="311"/>
first built this curious nest, and succeeded in hatching and rearing their young. In the fol∣lowing year they attempted to rebuild it: but a contest ensuing among some of the sable fra∣ternity, after a fierce engagement they were obliged to relinquish it, and the nest was de∣molished by the victorious party before it was finished. This bad success, however, did not deter the original builders and possessors from returning in the year 1785, when they took quiet possession of their freehold, rebuilt the premises, and reared another family. This they repeated the three following years with equal success, and when I was there in the year 1790, much of the nest remained, but the crows had forsaken it. The above occur∣rence, though to many it may appear incredi∣ble, is an undoubted fact. That <HI>crows</HI> should come into the center of a populous town to build their nests, is of itself remarkable; but much more so, that they should prefer a wea∣thercock to any other situation, where the
<PB N="281" REF="312"/>
whole family, and their habitation turned round with every puff of wind, though they were perfectly secured from falling, by the spike of iron which rose above the fane, a∣round which the whole made their revolutions; and as on one side the nest was higher than on the other, that part being always to wind∣ward, by this ingenious contrivance of the feathered architects, the inside of the nest was constantly kept in a proper degree of warmth. I never recollect these various circumstances, without being lost in admiration at the extra∣ordinary sagacity of these birds.</P>
<P>In this town however, I met with a great∣er curiosity, as well as a more amiable subject of it than a crow's nest, to excite my astonish∣ment.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fisher</HI> the bookseller introduced me to his daughter, a charming young lady, who being unfortunately born deaf, was conse∣quently dumb, till a gentleman a few years since taught her to understand what was said
<PB N="282" REF="313"/>
to her by the motion of the lips. I had the pleasure of conversing with her several times▪ and found that she had much of the Scotch dialect, which as Mr. Fisher informed me, she acquired of the gentleman who taught her not only to understand the conversation of others, but to <HI>speak,</HI> he being a native of that country; he remarked also, that she never had spoken the Newcastle dialect. This young lady, I was also informed, dances exceedingly well, keeping exact time with the music, whether it is played slow or quick. When it is considered what an intense application must have been used, both on the part of the teacher and his fair pupil, to produce such a happy effect, it surely reflects great credit on each of the parties.</P>
<P>In the year 1790, when I again visited New∣castle with Mrs. Lackington, she became the first object of inquiry, and we were both in∣troduced to her.</P>
<P>Being on the subject of <HI>Curiosities,</HI> and hav∣ing
<PB N="283" REF="314"/>
just related the pleasure I experienced on account of a lady acquiring the use of speech, permit me now to present you with another <HI>rarity</HI> indeed!—somewhat connected with the former, no doubt, but intended as an effectual remedy (temporary, at least) for an opposite complaint of the same organs, viz. too great a <HI>volubility of speech,</HI> with which, (as it is said) many females are so infected, as some∣times to lead them to exceed the bounds of due moderation and female decorum, and even display itself in the utterance of such harsh (though frequently inarticulate) terms, as tend too much to disgrace the unhappy patient, and violently affect the auditory nerves of all per∣sons within a considerable distance.—To quit metaphor, and speak in plain English:</P>
<P>At the town-hall I was shewn a piece of antiquity called a <HI>Brank.</HI> It consists of a com∣bination of iron fillets, and is fastened to the head by a lock fixed to the back part of it; a thin plate of iron goes into the mouth, suf∣ficiently
<PB N="284" REF="315"/>
strong however, to confine the tongue, and thus prevent the wearer from making any use of that restless member. The use of this piece of machinery is to punish notorious <HI>scolds.</HI> I am pleased to find that it is now considered merely as a matter of curiosity, the ladies of that town happily having not the smallest occasion for the application of so harsh an instrument: whether it is that all ladies, apprehensive of being included in <HI>that</HI> descrip∣tion, have travelled Southward, to avoid the danger of so degrading an exhibition, or what∣ever other reason is assigned, I forgot to in∣quire. It however affords me pleasure to re∣flect, that the ladies of Newcastle are left at liberty to adopt a head-dress of their own choosing, confident that they possess a more refined taste than to six upon one by no means calculated to display their lovely countenances to advantage, as I am persuaded the <HI>Brank</HI> would cast such a gloom on the fairest of them, as would tend much to diminish the influence
<PB N="285" REF="316"/>
of their charms, and give pain to every be∣holder. It may be prudent, notwithstanding, still to preserve it <HI>in terrorem,</HI> as who knows what future times may produce? But as I esteem it a very ingenious contrivance, and as there may be parts of the country still to be found, where the application of such a ma∣chine may be useful in some Christian fami∣lies, (I will not say in <HI>all,</HI> having sufficient grounds for asserting the contrary) I here present you with an accurate sketch of it,

together with the manner of its application:

that if any ingenious artist should be applied to, he may not be at a loss how it is to be made. I would, however, advise such a one to be cautious in offering them to public sale, and by no means to advertise them, (especially if a married man, or having any views to∣wards matrimony).</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my first journey to Scotland I sometimes travelled post, but often entered the diffe∣rent, stage-coaches, &amp;c. for a stage or two, when I happened to see any setting out so as to suit my time and inclination: But at last I had pretty nearly paid dear for it, as the dri∣ver of the Diligence from Darlington to Dur∣ham happened to be much inebriated and be∣fore
<PB N="288" REF="319"/>
his quitting Darlington had almost overset us. Not observing that the man was drunk, we attributed the fault to the horses, but we were very speedily undeceived in that re∣spect by many convincing circumstances, so that we were one minute nearly in the ditch on the right hand, and the next but just escap∣ed that on the left; at other times we experi∣enced <HI>striking proofs</HI> of the inability of our con∣ductor against the numbers of one-horse <HI>coal-carts,</HI> not to mention their frequently running foul of us for being on the wrong side of the road; (for drivers of coaches and carts can be to the full as savage towards each other there, as in London): however notwithstand∣ing all these "hair-breadth escapes," we re∣tained our seats, till we arrived within three quarters of a mile of Durham, when at length the specific gravity of the driver's head prepon∣derating over all the other parts of his frame united, precipitated him with violence from the elevated station he till then possessed,
<PB N="289" REF="320"/>
(though with difficulty) to his parent earth. There were three unfortunate passengers in the carriage, left to the discretion of the horses, viz. a gentleman, an innkeeper's wife, and your humble servant: the lady in strict com∣pliance with the practice of her sex in similar situations, on seeing the rapid descent of our charioteer, immediately honoured us with a loud and shrill shriek; this, the <HI>quadrupeds,</HI> not accustomed to this pretty female note so much as the sonorous voice of a coachman, mistook for a signal to mend their pace, and they, habituated to pay all due obedience to the commands of their superiors of the biped creation, when understood by them, and finding no check, instantly proceeded to a full gallop; and we, however reluctantly, fol∣lowed them down a gentle descent, not at a <HI>gentle</HI> rate, but with prodigious velocity. As I was quite calm and collected, I coolly recon∣noitred the road before us, and observing that it was perfectly clear, as for half a mile not a
<PB N="290" REF="321"/>
coal-cart was to be seen, although we had passed several scores, I began to reason with my companions, and they speedily became calm enough to assist in holding a council what was best to be done in our critical situa∣tion. Our debates were quickly ended, as we were unanimous in opinion that if we once entered the city of Durham, the carriage must inevitably be torn to pieces, owing to the va∣riety of turnings and obstructions we should have to encounter, we therefore entered into an immediate resolution, <HI>nem. con.</HI> that to open the doors, and exhibit our agility by leaping out, was, of "two evils, choosing the least:" this we instantly did, in as careful a manner as possible; we first alighted on our feet, and next complimented the ground with our noses, without receiving much injury. Our female companion indeed, by being ra∣ther too precipitate, alighted in a manner which on any other occasion would not have appeared strictly decent, of which she, poor
<PB N="291" REF="322"/>
lady! was so sensible, that she immediately "hoped <HI>as how</HI> we were both <HI>married</HI> gentle∣men;" which was quickly replied to by both in the affirmative; and thus we saved our fair one the trouble of exerting herself in another scream, and ourselves the punishment of hear∣ing it.</P>
<P>Being no longer parties concerned in the danger, it afforded us some entertainment to observe the progress of our vehicle now consi∣derably lightened by our escape from it, and becoming every moment still lighter by the exclusion of small trunks, boxes, parcels, great coats, &amp;c. they, in imitation of our ex∣ample making leaps, some from the inside of the carriage, and others from the boot; whether occasioned by the <HI>repulsion</HI> of the car∣riage and its appendages, or the <HI>attraction</HI> of the earth, I am not sufficiently versed in phi∣losophy to decide. Posterity when they pe∣ruse my labours, no doubt will determine this <HI>weighty</HI> point, and transmit it to the remotest
<PB N="292" REF="323"/>
period of time, properly dignified by <HI>F. R. S.</HI> in <HI>Phil. Trans.</HI></P>
<P>The horses finding themselves less incum∣bered and urged on by the noise of the doors continually flapping, increased their speed: happily however the carriage was stopped be∣fore it entered the city, and no damage was sustained either by the horses or the carriage. Before we left the inn, our careful <HI>son of the whip</HI> arrived, not in the least injured, but ra∣ther benefited by his disaster, being suddenly transformed into a state of perfect sobriety; after him followed two countrymen laden with the several articles which had been so violently ejected. As I reflected that this un∣guarded man might not always be equally successful, either to himself or his passengers, as in the present instance, I obtained a promise from the innkeeper never to permit him to drive any carriage in future, in the manage∣ment of which he had any concern.</P>
<P>It is astonishing what a number of fatal ac∣cidents
<PB N="293" REF="324"/>
continually happen from carelessness and the want of sobriety in this thoughtless race of beings. I was informed that only two days previous to my arrival at Durham, a coachman quitting his box to step into an adjacent house, in his absence the horses be∣gan to move gently, and a Lady in the car∣riage giving a loud scream, the noise occasion∣ed the horses to set off full gallop, in conse∣quence of which a lady of Durham, happen∣ing unfortunately at that instant to be crossing the way, was thrown down, and the wheels passing over her, she died on the spot.—One of the many melancholy effects resulting from the ridiculous practise of screaming. But I crave pardon of the ladies; when I begin pass∣ing censure on them, 'tis high time to close my epistle, (which if not very long will per∣haps be deemed sufficiently impertinent) with,</P>

<P>IT is reported of a very eminent author, that he never blotted a line of what he had once written: on which it has been remark∣ed, that it was a pity he had not blotted a thousand. Now though my extreme modesty will not permit me to put myself on a level with that great man as an author, whatever
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>
<PB N="295" REF="326"/>
the impartial world may think of our compara∣tive merits, I must confess I do not like to blot what I have once written, fearful lest when I begin, (another proof of my modesty,) I should deface the major part of my manuscripts and thus deprive the public of the great ad∣vantages which may result from them. What I allude to, is an unfortunate slip of the pen in my last; however, as "confession of a fault makes some amends," and I immediate∣ly checked myself, craved pardon, abruptly closed my letter, and threw the offending pen from me with some degree of anger, I hope those lovely fair ones, who might think I meant to affront them, will with their accus∣tomed benignity forgive, and indulge me with a smile on my future labours; and as a convincing proof how sensible I am of their kind condescension, I here engage never more to express my dislike of their <HI>screaming,</HI> except they should omit pur∣chasing books of me, which I am sure every
<PB N="296" REF="327"/>
candid fair (and what <HI>fair</HI> one is not can∣did?) will think sufficiently provoking.</P>
<P>But in order to remind them that every great man does not always conduct himself with equal politeness towards the Ladies, I beg permission to introduce a <HI>very</HI> great man to them: no less a personage than Doctor JOHN∣SON. Of whom indeed so much hath already been sung and said, that the subject may be supposed to be nearly exhausted; which is, however, so far from being the case, that not∣withstanding two quarto volumes of his life by Mr. Boswell are just published, we are taught to expect another life by a different hand. In∣deed until some other great man makes his exit (myself out of the question) we are likely to be entertained with fresh anecdotes of him; but when that period once arrives, then farewell <HI>Johnson</HI>!</P>
<P>The Doctor, whose extreme fondness for that agreeable beverage <HI>Tea,</HI> is well known, was once in company with a number of ladies
<PB N="297" REF="328"/>
assembled to partake with him of the same refreshment. The lady of the house happen∣ed to be one of those particularly attentive to punctilio, and had exhibited her finest set of china for the entertainment of her guests; the Doctor, who drank large quantities, and with considerable expedition, could not always wait with becoming patience ceremoniously to ask for and receive in due form the addition of a lump of sugar when necessary; he there∣fore without permission put his finger and thumb into the sugar-dish, tumbling the con∣tents over, till he met with a piece of the pro∣per size; the lady kept her eye fixed on him the whole time, and deeming his conduct a great breach of decorum, resolved to make him sensible of it, by immediately ordering the servant to change the sugar-dish. The Doctor, tho' apparently attentive only to his tea, noticed it, and as soon as he had emptied the cup, put it together with the saucer under the fire-place, with due care, however, not to
<PB N="298" REF="329"/>
break them. This was too severe a trial for the poor lady, who, apprehensive for the fate of her dear china, after a decent scream, with warmth demanded the reason of his treating her in so rude a manner. <Q>“Why, my dear madam, (replied he) I was alarmed with the idea that whatever I touched was there∣by contaminated, and impressed with anxi∣ous desire to contribute towards your felicity, I removed the object so defiled from your ”presence with all possible expedition.</Q> This reply, though it extorted a smile from all the company present, did not satisfy the lady to whom it was addressed, who notwithstanding she exerted herself to appear in good humour, was too much offended to forget the affront.— This anecdote has been related to me with some <HI>addenda</HI> which heighten the story, though more to the disadvantage of the Doctor; but I believe as here related, it may be depended on as the real fact.</P>
<P>During my continuance in Scotland, which
<PB N="299" REF="330"/>
was about three weeks the first time, and about a month the last, I often reflected with pain on the illiberal, not to say brutal treatment the inhabitants received from the Doctor. At Edinburgh I heard various anecdotes related of him, which were perfectly novel to me, and in all probability will be so to you. I shall therefore give you a specimen:</P>
<P>Being one day at a gentleman's house in Edinburgh, several ladies and gentlemen came in to pay their respects to him; and among others the then Lord Provost went up to the Doctor, bowing repeatedly, and expressing the highest respect for him, to all which the Doc∣tor paid not the least attention. Exceedingly hurt at so flagrant a mark of disrespect, he turned round, putting a shilling into the hand of the gentleman of the house: On being asked what the shilling was intended for, he replied, "Have not I seen your <HI>bear?"</HI></P>
<P>The Doctor being drinking tea at another gentleman's house, the lady asked him if he
<PB N="300" REF="331"/>
did not choose another cup: It seems she had forgot her having before asked him the same question; and on her repeating it he replied, <Q>“Woman, have I not already told you that ”I had done?</Q> On which the lady answer∣ed him in his own gruff manner. During his continuance in her house she always talked to him without ceremony, and it was remark∣ed that she had more influence with him than any other person in Scotland.</P>
<P>I was much pleased with the politeness of the gentleman who related me this story of the Doctor, as he appeared anxious to excuse him for his want of due decorum, and thus to palliate one of the most obvious blemishes in the character of one of the most eminent of my countrymen. I could wish the compilers of the biographical department of that truly great and useful work, the <HI>"Encyclopoedia Britannica"</HI> would observe the same polite∣ness. And I hope that this hint will also in∣duce them in some subsequent edition, when
<PB N="301" REF="332"/>
I am gone to
<Q>"That Bourne from whence no traveller returns,"</Q>
to do justice to my <HI>great and astonishing me∣rits,</HI> by way of compensation for having fal∣len short in speaking of other <HI>great men</HI>; and should I happen to be <HI>out of print</HI> by the time the editors of the <HI>Biographia Britannica</HI> ar∣rive at letter <HI>L.</HI> which seems extremely pro∣bable, according to the very deliberate pro∣gress of that work, I hope they will not slightly pass <HI>me</HI> over. If they should, let them take the consequence: as I here give them fair and timely notice, and they have not to plead as an excuse, the want of ma∣terials.</P>
<P>One word more concerning our great Lexi∣cographer. It must be allowed by every candid and impartial person, that the ex∣treme contempt and prejudice he entertained towards our friends of <HI>North</HI> Britain reflected a very strong shade on his character, which his warmest admirers cannot justify.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="333"/>Were I, as a South Briton, called upon to give my fair and unprejudiced opinion respecting national character of the natives of Scotland and those of England, and I flatter myself I have had ample opportunities of observing the peculiar traits of both countries, I would say, that if we in England excel them in some virtues, they no less shine in others, and if the North-Britons possess some peculiar frail∣ties and prejudices, we of the South are not intirely free from others; so that were the virtues and vices of a certain number of each country placed in an hydrostatical balance (it must however be a pretty large one), I believe it very difficult to prognosticate which of the two would preponderate. It is true, I have met with one very great villain in Scotland, in Mr. S. which only tends to prove there are probably <HI>scound<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els</HI> to be found every where, and that without taking the trouble which Diogenes did, in search of an <HI>honest man</HI>; and I am much afraid, were I to enquire of some
<PB N="303" REF="334"/>
North Britons, they could without any great difficulty point out to me some of my own countrymen as bad.</P>
<P>For my part I detest all national prejudices, as I think it betrays great weakness in the par∣ties who are influenced by them. Each nation of the habitable globe, nay each province of those countries has certainly some peculiar traits belonging to it which distinguishes it from its neighbours. But if we are disposed to view one another with the severity of criticism, how easy, nay how frequent it is to discover su∣perior virtues (as we think) as well as abilities in that particular spot which gave birth to our∣selves, and equally divested of that strictim∣partiality which alone can enable us to judge properly, discover proportionable blemishes in the natives of other countries. In saying thus much, I do not mean to infer, that we ought not to be inspired with a laudable ambition to excel, not hose of other countries only, but even those with whom we are more intimately
<PB N="304" REF="335"/>
connected: but that should be done without drawing invidious comparisons of the merits or demerits of others. In short, let it be the earnest endeavour of each country, and every individual of that country in particular, united under our amiable monarch, to strive which shall have a superior claim to the title of be∣ing GOOD MEN, useful members of Society, Friends to the whole human race, and peace∣able Subjects of a Government, which though not absolutely in a state of <HI>perfection</HI>—(and can that man be really deemed <HI>wise</HI> who ex∣pects to meet with perfection in any human establishment?) is still happily superior to every other in the known world, not forget∣ting our neighbours the French, our <HI>natural enemies,</HI> according to the long adopted language of national prejudice: but I hope that narrow minded disposition will henceforth cease; certainly nature never designed us as enemies, it has placed our stations near to each other, and surely there is not so great a dissimilarity
<PB N="305" REF="336"/>
in our national traits of character, as to occa∣sion us to be in perpetual enmity! The contrast now is less than ever. Like Britons, they have caught the spark of freedom, and nobly eman∣cipated themselves from a state of abject and degrading slavery, to a distinguished and ho∣nourable rank among nations. Long as time shall last, may they, with us, enjoy the bles∣sing so gloriously obtained, with that due mode∣ration which always properly distinguishes be∣tween <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>licentiousness</HI>! The friends of <HI>liberty</HI> merit the full enjoyment of every ad∣vantage attending it; those of <HI>licentiousness</HI> are unworthy the smallest share of it.</P>
<P>But whither am I <HI>travelling</HI>? I am imper∣ceptibly got into the road of politics. Coach∣man! turn off immediately into another road.— 'Tis done, and happy am I to get out of so dangerous a track unhurt, which has broke the necks of numbers of clever fellows, and deprived many a bright genius of that superior part of HIM from whence all his bright effu∣sions
<PB N="306" REF="337"/>
for the good of his country were emit∣ted. For <HI>patriotism</HI> (as you know) is always the motive which impels those worthies to such hazardous expeditions as have so fre∣quently in the event proved fatal to them. For proofs we need not consult history; in∣stances are, alas! fresh in our memories: wit∣ness London, 1780. and Birmingham, 1791!</P>
<P>At all events, it is certainly too rugged a road for a bookseller to travel, it being already crowded with many much abler adventurers. And whilst Mr. Burke, of the "Monarchy" (late of the "Fox") Inn, and Mr. Paine, at the sign of "the RIGHTS of MAN" provide rich and ample entertainment for "men and cat∣tle," let the public take their choice, or if they please (which indeed is the most rational mode), try them both, as some constitutions find one kind of food more easy of <HI>digestion,</HI> some the other; and I remain fully satisfied with the subordinate character of continuing an humble distributor of the viands provided by
<PB N="307" REF="338"/>
those and other very able caterers, and that upon easier terms than the admirers of such food will meet with elsewhere, according to the elegance or plainness of the <HI>dishes</HI> they are <HI>served up</HI> in. Some preferring <HI>rich foreign china, elegantly gilt</HI>; others, good substantial <HI>English porcelain</HI>; others, again being pleased with <HI>Queen's ware</HI>; and many more content with a <HI>Welch dish,</HI> or common <HI>earthen ware.</HI></P>
<P>I am now suddenly conveyed again to Edin∣burgh. The old town, so called, has not much to boast of; but the new town is by far the most compleat and elegant I ever saw. In various towns of England and Scotland, I have indeed seen some good streets, and many good houses, but in this the whole is uni∣formly fine: not one house, much less a whole street that can be termed indifferent in the whole town.</P>
<P>And here let me do justice to North-British hospitality, and their very polite attention to such Englishmen who happen to travel to the
<PB N="308" REF="339"/>
"land of cakes." I can truly say, that the polit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and friendly behaviour of the inhabitants to¦wards Mrs Lackington and myself, claims ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> warmest gratitude and sincerest thanks.

<P>The subject I now mean to enter into being a delicate one, permit me here to close my letter; thus affording you a short respite, and myself a little time for consideration on the propriety of submitting my ideas (as you seem determined all those I send you shall be) to public notice.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my last I expressed some diffidence re∣specting the propriety of committing to paper my thoughts on a particular subject, I have since weighed it with due caution, and the consideration of my having during
<PB N="310" REF="341"/>
the long course of my epistolary correspon∣dence always declared my sentiments freely on every subject, soon determined me not to degrade myself by shrinking back, now it is so near drawing to a conclusion.</P>
<P>The subject then is—that bright lovely part of the creation, WOMAN!—the source of all our joys, the assuagers of all our griefs; deprived of whose powerful and attractive charms, man would be a wretch indeed. But alas! the utmost efforts of my abilities are far inadequate to do justice to their me∣rits: happily that pleasing theme has en∣gaged the attention of the ablest and worthiest of men, from the remotest period down to the present time; and I trust ever will, nay must, so long as a spark of virtue remains to dwell in the human breast. And when I reflect, that
<Q>"They are not only FAIR, but JUST as fair,"</Q>
I have nought to fear.</P>
<P>I therefore proceed with cheerfulness to say,
<PB N="311" REF="342"/>
that in Edinburgh, Glascow, Sterling, &amp;c. there are more really fine women to be found than in any place I ever visited. — I do not mean to infer, we have not as many hand∣some women in England; but the only idea I wish to convey is, we have not so many <HI>in proportion</HI>: that is, Go to any public place where a number of Ladies are assembled, in either of the above towns, and then go to any place in England where an equal number are met, and you will notice a greater number of fine women among the former, than among the latter. It must be obvious that in making this declaration, I allude to the genteeler part; for among the lower classes of women, the majority are very homely, and the want of the advantages of apparel, (which those in a higher sphere can avail themselves of, and know how to apply) together with their slut∣tish and negligent appearance, does not tend in the least to heighten their charms.</P>
<P>Having both read and heard much related of
<PB N="312" REF="343"/>
the manner of washing their linen, which I must confess I would not credit without hav∣ing ocular demonstration; during my conti∣nuance at Glascow, curiosity led me to the mead by the river side. For the poor women here, instead of the water coming to them, as in London, are obliged to travel loaded with their linen to the water; where you may daily see great numbers washing, in <HI>their</HI> way; which if seen by some of our London prudes, would incline them to form very unjust and uncharitable ideas of the modesty of these Scottish Lassies. Many of them give a trifle to be accommodated with the use of a large wash-house near the water, where about a hundred may be furnished with every conve∣nience for their purpose. But by far the great∣est part make fires, and heat the water in the open air, and as they finish their linen, they spread it on the grass to dry; which is the uni∣versal mode of drying throughout Scotland.</P>
<P>I had walked to and fro several times, and
<PB N="313" REF="344"/>
began to conclude that the custom of getting into the tubs and treading on the linen, either never had been practised, or was come into disuse; but I had not waited more than half an hour, when many of them jumped into the tubs, without shoes or stockings, with their shifts and petticoats drawn up far above the knees, and stamped away with great compo∣sure in their countenances, and with all their strength, no Scotchman taking the least no-notice, or even looking towards them.</P>
<P>On conversing with some gentlemen of Glascow on this curious subject, they assured me that these singular laundresses (as they ap∣peared to me) were strictly modest women, who only did what others of unblemished repu∣tation had been accustomed to for a long series of years; and added, that at any other time a purse of gold would not tempt them to draw the curtain so high. By way of contrast, let me observe that many of our London servant-<HI>maids,</HI> though not always so nice in other
<PB N="314" REF="345"/>
respects, would not be seen thus habited <HI>in public</HI> on any terms, lest their precious cha∣racters should be called in question. A strik∣ing instance of the powerful influence of habit!</P>
<P>Most of the female servants in Edinburgh, Glascow, &amp;c do all their work, and run about the town the fore part of the day without stays, shoes or stockings; and on Sundays I saw the country-women going to Ward's Kirk, in the same manner (stays excepted); however they do not go into kirk, till they have dressed their legs and feet; but they seat themselves on the grass, somewhere near, and put on their shoes and stockings, and garter up very deliberately. Most of these poor young country-women go without any caps or hats; they have in ge∣neral fine heads of hair, many plat it, others let it hang loose down their backs; and I assure you, my friend, they look very agree∣able.</P>
<P>I returned each time through Buxton, where
<PB N="315" REF="346"/>
staying a week or two, I visited Castleton, and spent several hours in exploring that stupen∣dous cavern, called The Devil's A— in the Peake. I also surveyed Poole's Hole, near Buxton, and spent some days in that truly romantic village, where we purchased petri∣factions, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I DID not intend to trouble you or the pub∣lic with an account of any more of my <HI>wonderful travels,</HI> but being now at Lyme,
<PB N="317" REF="348"/>
for want of other amusements this rainy morning, I thought that a short account of this journey might afford you some entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>My state of health being but indifferent, and Mrs. Lackington's still worse, I was in∣duced to try what effect a journey would pro∣duce; and it being immaterial what part I tra∣velled to; as I had not for so long a time seen my native place, and perhaps might not be fur∣nished with another opportunity, we resolved to visit it. Accordingly in July last we set out from Merton, which I now make my chief residence, taking Bath, Bristol, &amp;c. in our way to my native place Wellington.</P>
<P>In Bristol, Exbridge, Bridgewater, Taunton, Wellington, and other places, I amused my∣self in calling on some of my masters, with whom I had about twenty years before work∣ed as a journeyman shoe-maker. I addressed each with, <HI>"Pray Sir, have you got any oc∣casion?"</HI> which is the term made use of by
<PB N="318" REF="349"/>
journeymen in that useful occupation, when seeking employment. Most of those honest men had quite forgot my person, as many of them had not seen me since I worked for them: so that it is not easy for you to conceive with what surprize and astonishment they gazed on me. For you must know that I had the vani∣ty (I call it <HI>humour</HI>) to do this in my chariot, attended by my servants; and on telling them who I was, all appeared to be very happy to see me. And I assure you, my friend, it afforded me much real pleasure to see my old acquaintances alive and well.</P>
<P>At Taunton and Wellington it seemed to be the unanimous determination of all the poorer sort, that I should by no means be de∣ficient in <HI>old acquaintance.</HI> Some poor souls declared that they had known me for <HI>fifty</HI> years (that is, years before I was born); others had danced me in their arms a thou∣sand times; nay, better still, some knew my grandmother; but, best of all, one old man
<PB N="319" REF="350"/>
claimed acquaintance with me, for having seen me many times on the top of a six-and-twenty round ladder, balanced on the chin of a merry andrew! The old man was however egregi∣ously mistaken, as I never was so precariously exalted, my ambition, as you well know, tak∣ing a very different turn. But that was of no consequence: all the old fellow wanted was <HI>a shilling</HI>—and I gave it him. No matter (as Sterne says) from what motive. I never ex∣amine into these things. This I observed, that <HI>small matters have made many happy,</HI> and I was supremely so, to be the means of con∣tributing to their comfort. And indeed who would hesitate at being the means of diffusing happiness on such easy terms, and with so little trouble?</P>
<P>The bells rang merrily all the day of my arrival. I was also honoured with the atten∣tion of many of the most respectable people in and near Wellington and other parts: Some of whom were pleased to inform me, that the
<PB N="230" REF="351"/>
reason of their paying a particular attention to me was their having heard, and now having themselves an opportunity of observing, that I did not so far forget myself, as many proud upstarts had done; that the notice I took of my poor relations and old acquaintance merited the respect and approbation of every real gen∣tleman. They were also pleased to express a wish, that as soon as I could dispose of my business, I would come down and spend the remainder of my days among them.</P>
<P>William Jones, Esq. of Foxdowne, near Wellington, informed me of a remarkable <HI>prognostication</HI> in my favour; He told me that when I was a boy, about twelve years of age, Mr. Paul, then a very considerable whole∣sale linen-draper, in Friday-street, London, (I believe still living) passing by my father's house, one day stopped at the door, and asked various questions about some guinea pigs which I had in a box. My answers it seems pleased and surprized him, and turning to∣wards
<PB N="321" REF="352"/>
Mr. Jones, said, <HI>"Depend upon it, sir, that boy will one day rise far above the situation that his present mean circumstances seem to pro∣mise."</HI> So who knows what a great man I may yet be?</P>
<P>Give me leave to introduce another predic∣tion, though not altogether so pleasing as that just related. An Italian gentleman, by birth, was some years since looking at some books of <HI>palmistry</HI> in my shop, and at the same time was endeavouring to convince me of the reali∣ity of that science. In the midst of his dis∣course, he suddenly seized my right hand, and on looking some time with great attention on the various lines, he informed me that I had twice been in danger, once by water and once by a wound in my head; he was very right, but I believe by chance, as I have many other times been in very great danger. He added, that I had much of the goddess <HI>Venus</HI> in me, but much more of <HI>Mars</HI>; and he assured me that I should go to the wars, and arrive at
<PB N="322" REF="353"/>
great honour. He likewise assured me, that I should die by fire-arms pointed over a wall. —How far the former part of this gentle∣man's prediction may be relied on, I will not pretend to decide, but the last part of it was lately very near coming to such a decision as would have proved the fallibility of that part of his prognostication, though even in that case he might have pleaded his being pretty near the matter of fact, only substituting <HI>gun∣powder</HI> instead of <HI>fire-arms,</HI> and I should not have had it in my power to contend the point with him. I will endeavour to render this intelligible: On Tuesday the fifth of July last, I very nearly escaped being blown up with the powder-mills belonging to Mr. Bridges, at Ewell, near Merton in Surrey. A quarter of an hour before that event took place, I was riding out within one mile of the mills, and having enquired of Mr. Ross at Coom-House, for the way that leads round by the mills, I actually rode part of the way, with an in∣tent
<PB N="323" REF="354"/>
of visiting them. But some how or other, I scarce knew why, I turned my horse about, and a few minutes after I had done so, I saw the fatal catastrophe; which happening by day resembled a large cloud of smoke, of a very light colour, and the report reached my ears soon after. I immediately concluded, it could be nothing less than the powder-mills blown up; and on my return to my house at Merton I soon learnt that it was the identical powder-mills that in all probability I should have been in, or very near to, at the time of the explo∣sion. By this accident it seems four men were killed, some of whom had large families. The bodies were so much mangled by the explosion that they could not be distinguished from each other, and the head of one of them was thrown to a great distance.</P>
<P>But to proceed with my journey. I esteem myself peculiarly happy, on one account in particular, that I undertook it; and have only to regret it did not take place sooner, as it
<PB N="324" REF="355"/>
tended to undeceive me in a matter in which I had long been in an error. The case was this: I had for seven years past supposed that the parents of my first wife were both dead; and on enquiring after them of Mr. Cash at Bridgwater, he confirmed the report. How∣ever, as we passed through South Petherton, being but a mile from the place where they formely lived, I could not help stopping to find out the time when they died, and what other particulars I could learn relative to them, but to my very great surprize, I was informed that they were both living at Newton, two miles distant. On this information I gave the coach∣man orders to drive us there, but still could scarcely credit that they really were alive.— But, O my dear Friend, it is utterly impossible for me to describe the sensations of Mrs. Lack∣ington and myself, on entering the cottage which "with ragged wall of mold'ring mud" contained them! There we found—two poor
<PB N="325" REF="356"/>
"human ruins, tottering o'er the grave!"— The dim light on our entrance seemed a little to flash in the socket, and every moment threatened to disappear for ever.</P>
<P>While their "pale wither'd hands were stretched out towards me, trembling at once with eagerness and age." I never before felt the full force of Shakspear's description,
<Q><L>"—Last scene of all</L>
<L>"That ends this strange eventful History,</L>
<L>"Is second childishness; and meer oblivion:</L>
<L>"Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste: sans every thing."</L></Q>
from such a state of poverty and wretchedness, Good God, deliver me!</P>
<P>The old man is ninety years of age, and the good old woman eighty. The old man's in∣tellects are much impaired; he for a moment knew me, and then his recollection forsook him. The old woman retained her senses and knowledge during the whole of the time we were with them. On inquiry I found, that
<PB N="326" REF="357"/>
what little property they had possessed, had been all expended for some years.
<Q><L>"How many, once in Fortune's lap high fed,</L>
<L>"Solicit the cold hand of Charity!</L>
<L>"To shock us more—solicit it in vain!"</L>
<BIBL>Dr. Young.</BIBL></Q>
Amidst this dreary scene, it was some allevia∣tion to learn that their pious son had given them weekly as much as he could afford from his own little family, and I have added enough to render them as comfortable as their great age can possibly admit of. But for your sake and my own, I will drop this gloomy sub∣ject; which to me proved one of the most affecting scenes that ever I experienced during the whole course of my life.</P>
<P>During our continuance at Wellington, I one morning rode over to Black Down, on purpose to inspect an immense heap of stones on the top of the hill, strait before the town. The distance from Wellington is about two miles. Those stones cover about an acre of ground, and rise to a great height. The
<PB N="327" REF="358"/>
country people informed me with great gravity, that "the Devil brought them there in one night in his <HI>leathern apron."</HI> But the name of it, as well as the form, prove what it was. It Is called Symmon's <HI>Borough,</HI> or <HI>Barrow</HI>; which, you know, signifies a burial-place. I should not have taken any notice of it here, had I ever seen any Barrow of stones besides this, and five other smaller Barrows, about half a mile from the large one. The country people informed me that the <HI>devil</HI> brought the five heaps in his <HI>glove.</HI> I also observed the remains of a large camp near the spot. Camden has taken notice of a large camp at Roach Castle, three or four miles from hence; it is strange that he should not take any no∣tice of so singular a Barrow as this certainly is.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>LYME, <DATE>Sep. 4. 1791.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEING now at one of those places usually called <HI>watering-places,</HI> that is, a place where invalids resort in great numbers for the
<PB N="329" REF="360"/>
purpose of drinking the waters for which each particular situation is in repute, and bathing in them with a view to the restoration of their health, I shall trouble you with a few obser∣vations which have occurred to me on the subject. I cannot entertain a doubt but many by such a practice have been highly benefited; but at the same time I must observe, that such relief is only to be reasonably expected where the parties possess a sufficient share of prudence to conform to such rules as are laid down to them by those who are best acquainted with the nature of their several complaints, the strength or weakness of their constitutions, and the different virtues those several waters possess, so as properly to adapt them to each particular case, and to drink the waters at proper stated periods, as well as in proper doses; besides conforming to such a regimen as shall co-operate with them in producing the desired effect. But where invalids neglect all, or in∣deed any of those rules, is it not rather an
<PB N="330" REF="361"/>
absurdity to expect relief?—I will endeavour to explain myself:</P>
<P>Those Waters either possess powerful vir∣tues, or they do not. If they do, is it not ob∣obvious that some judgment and caution is necessary in the use of them? which must either produce good or bad effects, according to the prudence with which they are applied. If on the other hand, they are of so insignifi∣cant a nature, that they may be used at any time, and in any proportion without injury; and that too in disorders and constitutions very much varying from each other, then surely the inference must be, that no depend∣ance is to be placed on them, and consequent∣ly it matters not if they are ever used at all. For what purpose then do such numbers put themselves to the inconvenience, expence, and trouble of travelling (frequently from distant parts of the kingdom), and that too, when many of them are in so debilitated a state, that their very removal is attended with extreme
<PB N="331" REF="362"/>
danger, and sometimes proves fatal? But that those waters are not inactive, I am well con∣vinced, having seen the bad effects arising from the imprudent use of them, in many in∣stances, as well as the happy consequences attending their being used with due caution.</P>
<P>I was first led into these reflections by having been highly diverted, when I visited Buxton several summers, with the preposterous and absurd conduct of some of the company who resorted thither for the purpose of restor∣ing their health. I remember six or seven gentlemen informing me, that they were vio∣lently afflicted with the gout and rheumatism, and had undertaken this journey in hopes of receiving benefit by the waters. These gentle∣men often rode or walked about the cold dreary hills, in very damp wet mornings, and after∣wards drank claret from three o'clock in the afternoon to three the next morning: But I did not continue there long enough to be a witness of the happy effects which must inevi∣tably
<PB N="332" REF="363"/>
be produced by a perseverance in such a judicious regimen.</P>
<P>I also visited Freestone, near Boston in Lin∣colnshire: to which place a number of trades∣men and farmers resorted with their wives, in hopes of receiving benefit from the use of the salt water, in a variety of complaints; which they had been advised to do by the fa∣culty, for a month, with particular directions to bathe every other day, and on the interme∣diate days to drink half a pint of the water in the course of that day. But these wise people on duly considering the matter, were fully convinced that this would detain them from their families and business longer than was al∣together convenient; and also (which they supposed their medical friends never thought of) that they could bathe the full number of time<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd drink the prescribed quantity of the water, in a week or a fortnight at farthest, and thus not only expedite the cure, but likewise enable them to return to their families and
<PB N="333" REF="364"/>
business so much earlier, as well as save the necessary expences attending their continuing for such a length of time at the watering place. These united considerations appeared to them so consistent with prudence and oeco∣nomy, that they resolved to put them into immediate practice. I remonstrated with se∣veral of these good people on the impropriety of their conduct; but whether they concluded I was a party interested in detaining them on the spot, or whether they deemed my judge∣ment inferior to their own, I know not; but I observed that some of them bathed several times in a day, and drank salt water by the quart, the consequence of which was, that they left the place when the time expired which they had prescribed to themselves, much worse than they came. Some indeed were so very weak, that I am persuaded they could with difficulty reach their homes alive▪ And in these cases the want of success, instead of being attributed to the <HI>folly</HI> of the patients,
<PB N="334" REF="365"/>
is generally transferred to the <HI>waters,</HI> and to the want of judgment in those who advised the use of them.</P>
<P>I assure you, my dear friend, this is pretty much the case at Lyme. My rooms com∣manding a view of the sea, I have this and several other days noticed many decent looking men going down the beach three or four times in as many hours, and drinking a pint of wa∣ter each time. I have made the same observa∣tion at <HI>Seaton, Charmouth</HI> and other places, so that the observation of Crabshaw's nurse in "the adventures of Sir Lancelot Greaves" have frequently occurred to me: "Blessed be G— (said she) my patient is in a fair way! his apozem has had a blessed effect! five and twen∣ty stools since three o'clock in the morning!"</P>
<P>Relating these particulars to a medical friend, he informed me that such specimens of ignorance and obstinacy were by no means confined to the watering places; as he had in the course of his practice met with repeated
<PB N="335" REF="366"/>
instances, where patients with a view of hast∣ening the cure, and <HI>getting out of the doctor's hands</HI> (whom the vulgar <HI>charitably</HI> suppose wish to retain them there as long as possible) have swallowed a half pint mixture intended for several doses at once, and a whole box of pills in the same manner. The consequences of which have been, that they have remain∣ed <HI>in his hands</HI> a considerable time, some so long as life (thus foolishly trifled with) lasted.</P>
<P>But here are many of another class; some of whom, though not <HI>all,</HI> came on purpose to bathe, but during the whole of their con∣tinuance here, never found time to bathe once. These hasten to the billiard-room as soon as they are out of their beds in the morn∣ing, and there they continue until bed-time again. Some of these are indeed much bene∣fited, being cured of <HI>consumptions,</HI> while o∣thers become proportionably much emaciated —<HI>in their pockets.</HI> And a great number, both of ladies and gentlemen devote the whole of
<PB N="336" REF="367"/>
their time to dressing, eating, and playing at whist. Charming <HI>exercise</HI> it must be! as they frequently sit still in their chairs, for eight or ten hours together.</P>
<P>Here are others again, who, like the gen∣tlemen at Buxton, sit drinking until three or four in the morning; making a delightful noise, to <HI>compose</HI> those in the same house who are real <HI>invalids,</HI> and who desirous of obtaining rest, retire early, though frequently to very little purpose.</P>
<P>I have also observed, that all the above places are as healthy for <HI>horses,</HI> as they are for their masters. For as the innkeepers depend almost entirely on the season, they take great care, and do all they can to make these places comfortable. So that if gentlemen who have fat, lazy, prancing horses, and want to reduce them in size and temper, he may be sure to have it done in some of the inns and stables at the various watering places: Where such <HI>hay</HI> is procured as must infallibly answer the
<PB N="337" REF="368"/>
purpose even though they be allowed a double portion of Corn.</P>
<P>There is yet another very great advantage (which I had like to have forgot) resulting from attending the watering places. Such gen∣tlemen who happen to have servants too honest, too industrious, too attentive, too cleanly, too humble, too sober, &amp;c. by taking them to any of these places where they have so much leisure time, and where these party-coloured gentry meet together so often, and in such numbers, no one can go away unimprov∣ed, except he is a very dull fellow indeed. —This is not merely my own observation: for several gentlemen of my acquaintance as∣sured me that they had always found their servants improved prodigiously after all these excursions.</P>
<P>We purpose setting out for Weymouth in a day or two: but as I intend that this shall be my last epistle, I will not conclude it until I arrive at Merton.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="369"/><HI>Merton,</HI> Sep. 11th. We arrived here safe last night, being my birth-day. At Weymouth we had the honour of walking several even∣ings on the Esplanade, with their majesties and the four princesses. His majesty seems in per∣fect health and spirits, and diffuses life and spirits to all around him. Long, very long may he continue to enjoy the same degree of health and happiness! But I could not help pitying Mr. Hughes, the manager of the The∣atre there; as the company in general seem to pay but very little attention to plays, while they can partake of the pleasure of walking and breathing the sea air with so many of the royal family. But his majesty, whose, huma∣nity is by no means the least of his many vir∣tues, will no doubt consider Mr. Hughes, who is industrious to an extreme, as he is scarce a moment idle. For besides managing his company, performing himself six, sometimes eight characters in a week, he paints all his own scenes, and attends to many other sub∣jects;
<PB N="339" REF="370"/>
and although he has had a large expen∣sive family (nine children), the theatre there, and that also at Exeter is his own. Weymouth theatre he rebuilt about four years since; eve∣ry thing is very neat; his scenes are fine, and his company a very good one. I saw them perform four pieces with a deal of pleasure.</P>
<P>In our road home, within half a mile of Dorchester, we stopt and spent half an hour in looking round the famous Roman Amphi∣theatre. It is close to the road, on the right hand side, and covers about an acre of ground. It is judged that ten thousand people might without interruption have beheld such exer∣cises as were exhibited in this school of the ancients; it is called Mambury, and is sup∣posed to be the compleatest antiquity of the kind in England.</P>
<P>I also amused myself, as I travelled through Dorsetshire and Wiltshire, in surveying many of the numerous camps, fortifications, and barrows; which lasting monuments of anti∣quity
<PB N="340" REF="371"/>
are to be seen in abundance in these counties, a great number of them remain in a perfect state.</P>
<P>Nor could I any longer omit the opportu∣nity of seeing that stupendous piece of anti∣quity on Salisbury plain, the famous <HI>Stone∣henge,</HI> two miles from Amesbury. We spent near two hours there in astonishment; and had not night came on, we should not have been able to have parted from it so soon. We found a very good inn at Amesbury, which proves very convenient to such as curiosity may detain on this wonderful spot until it is late. It is remarkable, that although so many able antiquaries have devoted their time and attention to the investigation of Stonehenge, it remains still a matter undecided when and for what purpose this amazing pile was formed; nor is there less cause of admiration, how stones of such magnitude were brought hither! I shall not presume, either to decide on this curious point, or offer any conjectures of my own.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="372"/>I have now, Sir, not only given you some of the most material circumstances of my life, but have also super-added a short sketch of some of my <HI>travels.</HI> And should the fine air of Merton preserve the stock of health and spirits which I have acquired in this last excursion, I intend to spend a few hours in the middle of three or four days in every week in Chiswell-street, during the remainder of the summer; and during the winter I pur∣pose spending most of my time there: where I hope again to enjoy the company of you, Sir, and some others of our old philosophical friends. In the mean time, I am,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>dear friend, yours, &amp;c.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> I should deem myself deficient in point of justice to the ingenious artist who painted the portrait from whence the engrav∣ing affixed as a frontispiece to this volume is taken, if I did not embrace this opportunity of acknowledging the approbation it has been
<PB N="342" REF="373"/>
honoured with by all who have seen it, as a striking likeness.</P>
<P>The following circumstance, though to many it may appear in a ludicrous point of view, yet as it is a fact which does not depend solely on my assertion, I shall not hesitate to mention it.</P>
<P>Before the portrait was finished, Mrs. L. called on the painter to view it. Being intro∣duced into a room filled with portraits, her little dog, (the faithful <HI>Argus</HI>) being with her, immediately ran to that particular por∣trait, paying it the same attention as he is always accustomed to do to the original; which made it necessary to remove him from it, lest he should damage it: though this was not accomplished without expressions of dissatis∣faction on the part of poor Argus.</P>
<P>Those who have read history will not doubt the fact; several similar instances being re∣corded of the sagacity and nice discrimination
<PB N="343" REF="374"/>
of these animals. Such as choose to be scep∣tics on this <HI>most important subject,</HI> are heartily welcome—I rest satisfied.</P>
