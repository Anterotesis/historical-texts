OF
The <HI>WARS</HI> in GERMANY,
AND
The <HI>WARS</HI> in ENGLAND;
From the Year 1632, to the Year 1648.</P>
<P>Written Threescore Years ago by an <HI>English</HI>
Gentleman, who served first in the Army of
<HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> the glorious King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
till his Death; and after that, in the Royal Ar∣my

<HEAD>THE
PREFEACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S an Evidence that 'tis very probable
these Memorials were written many Years
ago, the Persons now concerned in the
Publication, assure the Reader, that they
have had them in their Possession finished,
as they now appear, above twenty Years: That they were
so long ago found by great Accident, among other valu∣able
Papers in the Closet of an eminent publick Minister,
of no less Figure than one of King <HI>William</HI>'s Secretaries
of State.</P>
<P>As it is not proper to trace them any farther, so nei∣ther
is there any need to trace them at all, to give Re∣putation
to the Story related, seeing the Actions here
mentioned have a sufficient Sanction from all the Hi∣stories
of the Times to which they relate, with this Ad∣dition,
that the admirable Manner of relating them, and
the wonderful Variety of Incidents, with which they are
beautified in the Course of a private Gentleman's Story,
add such Delight in the reading, and give such a Lustre,
as well to the Accounts themselves, as to the Person who
<PB REF="3"/>
was the Actor; and no Story, we believe, extant in the
World, ever came abroad with such Advantages.</P>
<P>It must naturally give some Concern in the reading,
that the Name of a Person of so much Gallantry and
Honour, and so many Ways valuable to the World,
should be lost to the Readers: We assure them no small
Labour has been thrown away upon the Enquiry, and
all we have been able to arrive to of Discovery in this
Affair is, that a <HI>Memorandum</HI> was found with this
Manuscript, in these Words, but not signed by any Name,
only the two Letters of a Name, which gives us no Light
into the Matter, which Memoir was as follows.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<OPENER>Memorandum,</OPENER>
<P>I found this Manuscript among my
Father's Writings, and I understand
that he got them as Plunder, at, or af∣ter,
the Fight at <HI>Worcester,</HI> where he
served as Major of—'s Regiment
of Horse on the Side of the Parlia∣ment.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I. K.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>As this has been of no Ʋse but to terminate the Enqui∣ry
after the Person; so, however, it seems most naturally to
give an Authority to the Original of the Work, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
that it was born of a Soldier, and indeed it is thro' every
Part, related with so Soldierly a Stile, and in the very
Language of the Field, that it seems impossible any
Thing, but the very Person who was present in every
Action here related, could be the Relator of them.</P>
<P>The Accounts of Battles, the Sieges, and the several
Actions of which this Work is so full, are all recorded in
the Histories of those Times; such as the great Battle
of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> the Sacking of <HI>Magdeburgh,</HI> the Siege of
<HI>Nurembergh,</HI> the passing the River <HI>Leck</HI> in <HI>Bavaria;</HI>
such also as the Battles of <HI>Keynton,</HI> or <HI>Edge-Hill;</HI>
<PB REF="4"/>
the Battles of <HI>Newberry, Marston-Moor,</HI> and <HI>Nase∣by,</HI>
and the like: They are all, we say, recorded in
other Histories, and written by those who lived in
those Times, and perhaps had good Authority
for what they wrote. But do those Relations give
any of the beautiful Ideas of things formed in this
Account? Have they one half of the Circumstances and
Incidents of the Actions themselves, that this Man's
Eyes were Witness to, and which his Memory has thus
preserved? He that has read the best Accounts of those
Battles, will be surprized to see the Particulars of the
Story so preserved, so nicely, and so agreeably describ'd;
and will confess what we alledge, that the Story is in∣imitably
told; and even the great Actions of the glori∣ous
King <HI>GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS,</HI> receive a
Lustre from this Man's Relations, which the World
was never made sensible of before, and which the pre∣sent
Age has much wanted of late, in Order to give
their Affections a Turn in Favour of his late glorious
Successor.</P>
<P>In the Story of our own Country's unnatural Wars,
he carries on the same Spirit. How effectually does he
record the Virtues and glorious Actions of King
<HI>Charles</HI> the First, at the same Time that he frequently
enters upon the Mistakes of his Majesty's Conduct, and
of his Friends, which gave his Enemies all those fatal
Advantages against him, which ended in the Over∣throw
of his Armies, the Loss of his Crown and Life,
and the Ruin of the Constitution?</P>
<P>In all his Account he does Justice to his Enemies,
and honours the Merit of those whose Cause he fought
against; and many Accounts recorded in his Story,
are not to be found even in the best Histories of those
Times.</P>
<P>What Applause does he give to the Gallantry of Sir
<HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> to his Modesty, to his Conduct, under
<PB REF="5"/>
which he himself was subdued, and to the Justice he did
the King's Troops when they laid down their Arms?</P>
<P>His Description of the <HI>Scots</HI> Troops in the beginning
of the War, and the Behaviour of the Party under the
Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who went over against them, are ad∣mirable;
and his Censure of their Conduct, who push'd
the King upon the Quarrel, and then would not let him
fight, is no more than what many of the King's Friends,
tho' less knowing [as Soldiers, have often complained of.]</P>
<P>In a Word, this Work is a Confutation of many Er∣rors
in all the Writers upon the Subject of our Wars in
<HI>England,</HI> and even in that extraordinary History
written by the Earl of <HI>Clarendon;</HI> but the Editors
were so just, that when near twenty Years ago, a Person
who had written a whole Volume in Folio, by Way of
Answer to, and Confutation of <HI>Clarendon's</HI> History of
the Rebellion, would have borrowed the Clauses in this
Account, which clash with that History, and confront
it: We say the Editors were so just as to refuse
them.</P>
<P>There can be nothing objected against the general
Credit of this Work, seeing its Truth is established upon
universal History; and almost all the Facts, especially
those of Moment, are confirmed for their general Part by
all the Writers of those Times, if they are here embellished
with Particulars, which are no where else to be found,
that is the Beauty we boast of; and that it is that must
recommend this Work to all the Men of Sense and
Judgment that read it.</P>
<P>The only Objection we find possible to make against
this Work is, that it is not carried on farther; or, as we
may say finished, with the finishing the War of the Time;
and this we complain of also: But then we complain as
a Misfortune to the World, not as a Fault in the Author;
for how do we know but that this Author might carry it
on, and have another Part finished which might not
fall into the same Hands, or may still remain with
<PB REF="6" MS="y"/>
some of his Family, and which they cannot indeed publish,
to make it seem any Thing perfect, for want of the other
Part which we have, and which we have now made pub∣lick?
Nor is it very improbable, but that if any such
farther Part is in Being, the publishing these Two Parts
may occasion the Proprietors of the Third to let the World
see it; and that by such a Discovery, the Name of the
Person may also come to be known, which would, no doubt,
be a great Satisfaction to the Reader, as well as us.</P>
<P>This, however, must be said, that if the same Au∣thor
should have written another Part of this Work, and
carried it on to the End of those Times; yet as the Re∣sidue
of those melancholly Days, to the Restoration, were
filled with the Intrigues of Government, the Political Ma∣nagement
of illegal Power, and the Dissentions and Fa∣ctions
of a People, who were then even in themselves
but a <HI>FACTION,</HI> and that there was very little
Action in the Field; it is more than probable that our
Author, who was a Man of Arms, had little Share in
those Things, and might not care to trouble himself
with looking at them.</P>
<P>But besides all this, it might happen that he might
go abroad again, at that Time, as most of the Gentlemen
of Quality, and who had an Abhorrence for the Power
that then govern'd, here did. Nor are we certain that
he might live to the End of that Time, so we can give
no Account whether he had any Post in the subsequent
Actions of that Time.</P>
<P>'Tis enough that we have the Authorities above to re∣commend
this Part to us that is now published; the Rela∣tion,
we are perswaded, will recommend it self, and no∣thing
more can be needful, because nothing more can
invite than the Story it self, which when the Reader en∣ters
into, he will find it very hard to get out of, 'till
he has gone thro' it.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T may suffice the Reader, with∣out
being very inquisitive after
my Name, that I was born in
the County of <HI>SALOP,</HI> in
the Year 1608; under the Go∣vernment
of what Star I was
never Astrologer enough to exa∣mine;
but the Consequences of my Life may
allow me to suppose some extraordinary
Influence affected my Birth. If there be any
thing in Dreams also, my Mother, who was
mighty observant that Way, took Minutes, which
I have since seen in the first Leaf of her Prayer
Book, of several strange Dreams she had while she
was with Child of her second Son, which was my
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
self. Once she noted that she dreamed she was
carried away by a Regiment of Horse, and de∣livered
in the Fields of a Son, that as soon as
it was born had two Wings came out of its Back,
and in half an Hour's Time flew away from her:
And the very Evening before I was born, she dream∣ed
she was brought to Bed of a Son, and that all
the while she was in Labour a Man stood under her
Window beating on a Kettle-Drum, which very
much discomposed her.</P>
<P>My Father was a Gentleman of a very plen∣tiful
Fortune, having an Estate of above 5000
Pounds <HI>per Annum,</HI> of a Family nearly allied to
several of the principal Nobility, and lived about
six Miles from the Town: And my Mother be∣ing
at—on some particular Occasion, was sur∣prized
there at a Friend's House, and brought
me very safe into the World.</P>
<P>I was my Father's second Son, and therefore
was not altogether so much slighted as younger
Sons of good Families generally are. But my
Father saw something in my Genius also which
particularly pleased him, and so made him take
extraordinary Care of my Education.</P>
<P>I was taught therefore, by the best Masters
that could be had, every Thing that was needful
to accomplish a young Gentleman for the World;
and at seventeen Years old my Tutor told my Fa∣ther
an Academick Education was very proper
for a Person of Quality, and he thought me very
fit for it: So my Father entered me of—College
in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where I continued three Years.</P>
<P>A Collegiate Life did not suit me at all, though
I loved Books well enough. It was never de∣signed
that I should be either a Lawyer, Phy∣sician
or Divine; and I wrote to my Father,
that I thought I had staid there long enough
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
for a Gentleman, and with his Leave I desired
to give him a Visit.</P>
<P>During my Stay at <HI>Oxford,</HI> though I passed
through the proper Exercises of the House, yet
my chief reading was upon History and Geogra∣phy,
as that which pleased my Mind best, and
supplied me with Ideas most suitable to my Ge∣nius:
By one I understood what great Actions had
been done in the World; and by the other I
understood where they had been done.</P>
<P>My Father readily complied with my Desire
of coming home; for besides that he thought,
as I did, that three Years time at the University
was enough, he also most passionately loved me,
and began to think of my settling near him.</P>
<P>At my Arrival I found my self extraordinarily
caressed by my Father, and he seemed to take
a particular Delight in my Conversation. My
Mother, who lived in a perfect Union with him,
both in Desires and Affection, received me very
passionately: Apartments were provided for me
by my self, and Horses and Servants allowed me
in particular.</P>
<P>My Father never went a Hunting, an Exercise
he was exceeding fond of, but he would have
me with him; and it pleased him when he found
me like the Sport. I lived thus, in all the Plea∣sures
'twas possible for me to enjoy, for about
a Year more; when going out one Morning with
my Father to hunt a Stag, and having had a very
hard Chase, and gotten a great Way off from
home, we had Leisure enough to ride gently
back: And as we returned, my Father took Oc∣casion
to enter into a serious Discourse with
me concerning the Manner of my settling in
the World.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="10"/>
He told me, with a great deal of Passion, that
he loved me above all the rest of his Children,
and that therefore he intended to de very well
for me; that my eldest Brother being already
married and settled, he had designed the same for
me, and proposed a very advantageous Match for
me with a young Lady of very extraordinary
Fortune and Merit, and offered to make a Set∣tlement
of 2000 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> on me, which he
said he would purchase for me without diminish∣ing
his paternal Estate.</P>
<P><HI>There was too much Tenderness in this Dis∣course
not to affect me exceedingly. I told him,
I would perfectly resign my self unto his Dis∣posal.
But, as my Father had, together with his
Love for me, a very nice Judgment in his Dis∣course,
he fixed his Eyes very attentively on
me; and though my Answer was without the
least Reserve, yet he thought he saw some Un∣easiness
in me at the Proposal, and from thence
concluded that my Compliance was rather an
Act of Discretion than Inclination; and, that
however I seemed so absolutely given up to what
he had proposed, yet my Answer was really an
Effect of my Obedience rather than my Choice:
So he returned very quick upon me,</HI> Look you,
Son, though I give you my own Thoughts in the Matter,
yet I would have you be very plain with me; for if your
ewn Choice does not agree with mine, I will be your Ad∣viser,
but will never impose upon you; and therefore let
me know your Mind freely. I don't reckon my self ca∣pable,
Sir, <HI>said I, with a great deal of respect,</HI> to
make so good a Choice for my self as you can for me;
and though my Opinion differed from yours, its being
your Opinion would reform mine, and my Judgment
would as readily comply as my Duty. I gather at least
from thence, <HI>said my Father,</HI> that your Designs lay
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
another Way before, however they may comply with mine:
And therefore I would know what it was you would have
asked of me if I had not offered this to you; and you must
not deny me your Obedience in this, if you expect I should
believe your Readiness in the other.</P>
<P>Sir, <HI>said I,</HI> 'twas impossible I should lay out for my
self just what you have proposed; but if my Inclinations
were never so contrary, though at your Command you shall
know them, yet I declare them to be wholly subjected to
your Order: I confess my Thoughts did not tend towards
Marriage or a Settlement; for though I had no Rea∣son
to question your Care of me, yet I thought a Gentle∣man
ought always to see something of the World before
he confined himself to any part of it: And if I had been
to ask your Consent to any Thing, it should have been to
give me leave to Travel for a short Time, in order
qualifie my self to appear at home like a Son to so good
a Father.</P>
<P>In what Capacity woul you Travel, <HI>replied my Fa∣ther?</HI>
You must go abroad either as a private Gentleman,
as a Scholar, or as a Soldier. If it were in the latter
Capacity, Sir, <HI>said I, returning pretty quick,</HI> I hope
I should not misbehave my self; but I am not so deter∣mined
as not to be ruled by your Judgment. Truly, <HI>re∣plied
my Father,</HI> I see no War abroad at this Time
worth while for a Man to appear in, whether we talk of
the Cause or the Encouragement; and indeed, Son, I am
afraid you need not go far for Adventures of that Na∣ture,
for Times seem to look as if this Part of <HI>Europe</HI>
would find us Work enough. My Father spake then rela∣ting
to the Quarrel likely to happen between the King of
<HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> (<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon the Breach of the Match between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the Infanta of <HI>Spain;</HI> and particularly upon the old Quarrel of the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and the <HI>Palatinate.</HI></NOTE>) for I believe he had
no Notions of a Civil War in his Head.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
In short, my Father perceiving my Inclinati∣ons
very forward to go abroad, gave me Leave
to Travel, upon Condition I would promise to
return in two Years at farthest, or sooner, if he
sent for me.</P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Oxford</HI> I happened into the So∣ciety
of a young Gentleman, of a good Family,
but of a low Fortune, being a younger Brother, and
who had indeed instilled into me the first De∣sires
of going abroad, and who I knew passionate∣ly
longed to Travel, but had not sufficient Al∣lowance
to defray his Expences as a Gentleman.
We had contracted a very close Friendship, and
our Humours being very agreeable to one ano∣ther,
we daily enjoyed the Conversation of Let∣ters.
He was of a generous free Temper, with∣out
the least Affectation or Deceit, a handsome
proper Person, a strong Body, very good Mien,
and brave to the last Degree: His Name was
<HI>Fielding,</HI> and we called him <HI>Captain,</HI> though it be
a very unufual Title in a College; but Fate had
some Hand in the Title, for he had certainly
the Lines of a Soldier drawn in his Counte∣nance.
I imparted to him the Resolutions
I had taken, and how I had my Father's Consent
to go abroad; and would know his Mind, whe∣ther
he would go with me: He sent me Word,
he would go with all his Heart.</P>
<P>My Father, when he saw him, for I sent for
him immediately to come to me, mightily appro∣ved
my Choice; so we got our Equipage ready,
and came away for <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>'Twas on the 22d of <HI>April</HI> 1630, when we em∣barked
at <HI>Dover,</HI> landed in a few Hours at <HI>Calais,</HI>
and immediately took Post for <HI>Paris.</HI> I shall not
trouble the Reader with a Journal of my Tra∣vels,
nor with the Description of Places; which
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
every Geographer can do better than I; but
these Memoirs being only a Relation of what hap∣pened
either to our selves, or in our own Know∣ledge,
I shall confine my self to that Part of it.</P>
<P>We had indeed some diverting Passages in our
Journey to <HI>Paris;</HI> as first, the Horse my Comrade
was upon fell so very lame with a Slip that he
could not go, and hardly stand: And the Fel∣low
that rid with us Express, pretended to ride
away to a Town five Miles off to get a fresh
Horse, and so left us on the Road with one Horse
between two of us: We followed as well as we
could, but being Strangers, missed the Way, and
wandered a great Way out of the Road. Whe∣ther
the Man performed in reasonable Time, or
not, we could not be sure; but if it had not
been for an old Priest, we had never found him.
We met this Man, by a very good Accident,
near a little Village whereof he was Curate: We
spoke <HI>Latin</HI> enough just to make him understand
us, and he did not speak it much better himself;
but he carried us into the Village to his House,
gave us Wine and Bread, and entertained us with
wonderful Courtesie: After this he sent in∣to
the Village, hired a Peasant, and a Horse for
my Captain, and sent him to guide us into the
Road. At parting he made a great many Com∣pliments
to us in <HI>French,</HI> which we could just un∣derstand;
but the Sum was, to excuse him for
a Question he had a mind to ask us. After
leave to ask what he pleased, it was, if we want∣ed
any Money for our Journey, and pulled out
two Pistoles, which he offered either to give or
lend us.</P>
<P>I mention this exceeding Courtesie of the Cu∣rate,
because, though Civility is very much in
Use in <HI>France,</HI> and especially to Strangers, yet
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
'tis a very unusual thing to have them part with
their Money.</P>
<P>We let the Priest know, first, that we did not
want Money, and next that we were very
sensible of the Obligation he had put upon us;
and I told him in particular, if I lived to see
him again, I would acknowledge it.</P>
<P>This Accident of our Horse, was, as we after∣wards
found, of some use to us: We had left
our two Servants behind us at <HI>Calais</HI> to bring our
Baggage after us, by reason of some Dispute be∣tween
the Captain of the Pacquet and the
Custom-House Officer which could not be
adjusted; and we were willing to be at <HI>Paris:</HI>
The Fellows followed as fast as they could, and
as near as we could learn, in the Time we lost
our Way were robbed, and our Portmanteaus
opened. They took what they pleased; but
as there was no Money there, but Linen and Ne∣cessaries,
the Loss was not great.</P>
<P>Our Guide carried us to <HI>Amiens,</HI> where we
found the Express and our two Servants, who
the Express meeting on the Road with a spare
Horse, had brought back with him thither.</P>
<P>We took this for a good Omen of our suc∣cessful
Journey, having escaped a Danger which
might have been greater to us than it was to our
Servants; for the Highway-Men in <HI>France</HI> do
not always give a Traveller the Civility of
bidding him Stand and Deliver his Money, but
frequently Fire upon him first, and then take
his Money.</P>
<P>We staid one Day at <HI>Amiens,</HI> to adjust this
little Disorder, and walked about the Town,
and into the great Church, but saw nothing
very remarkable there; but going cross a broad
Street near the great Church, we saw a Crowd of
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
People gazing at a Mountebank Doctor who
made a long Harangue to them with a thousand
antick Postures, and gave out Bills this Way,
and Boxes of Physick that Way, and had a great
Trade, when on a sudden the People raised a
Cry,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In English, <HI>Thief, Thief,</HI></NOTE> <HI>Larron, Larron,</HI> on the other side the
Street, and all the Auditors ran away from Mr.
Doctor, to see what the matter was—Among
the rest, we went to see; and the case was plain
and short enough. Two <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen,
and a <HI>Scotch-Man,</HI> Travellers as we were, were
standing gazing at this prating Doctor, and one
of them catched a Fellow picking his Pocket:
The Fellow had got some of his Money, for he
dropt two or three Pieces just by him, and had
got hold of his Watch; but being surprized,
let it slip again: but the Reason of telling this
Story, is for the Management of it. This Thief
had his Seconds so ready, that as soon as the
<HI>English-Man</HI> had seized him, they fell in, pre∣tended
to be mighty zealous for the Stranger,
takes the Fellow by the Throat, and makes a
great Bustle; the Gentleman not doubting but
the Man was secured, let go his own Hold of
him, and left him to them: The Hubbub was
great, and 'twas these Fellows cried <HI>Larron, Lar∣ron;</HI>
but with a Dexterity peculiar to themselves,
had let the right Fellow go, and pretended to
be all upon one of their own Gang. At last
they bring the Man to the Gentleman, to ask
him what the Fellow had done? who, when he
saw the Person they seized on, presently told
them that was not the Man: Then they seemed
to be in more Consternation than before, and
spread themselves all over the Street, crying
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<HI>Larron, Larron,</HI> pretending to search for the Fellow;
and so one one Way, one another, they were all
gone, the Noise went over, the Gentlemen stood
looking one at another, and the bawling Doctor
began to have the Crowd about him again.</P>
<P>This was the first <HI>French</HI> Trick I had the Op∣portunity
of seeing; but I was told they have
a great many more as dextrous as this.</P>
<P>We soon got Acquaintance with these Gentle∣men,
who were going to <HI>Paris</HI> as well as we; so
the next Day we made up our Company with
them, and were a pretty Troop of five Gentle∣men
and four Servants.</P>
<P>As we had really no Design to stay long at
<HI>Paris,</HI> so indeed, excepting the City it self, there
was not much to be seen there. Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI>
who was not only a supreme Minister in the
Church, but prime Minister in the State, was
now made also General of the King's Forces, with
a Title never known in <HI>France</HI> before nor since,
<HI>viz.</HI> Lieutenant-General <HI>au Place du Roy,</HI> in the
King's stead, or as some have since translated it,
representing the Person of the King.</P>
<P>Under this Character he pretended to exe∣cute
all the Royal Powers in the Army without
Appeal to the King, or without waiting for
Orders: and having parted from <HI>Paris</HI> the
Winter before, had now actually begun the War
against the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> in the process of
which, he restored the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and
having taken <HI>Pignerol</HI> from the Duke, put it into
such a state of Defence, as the Duke could never
force it out of his hands, and reduced the Duke,
rather by Manage and Conduct than by Force,
to make Peace without it; so as annexing it to
the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> it has ever since been a
Thorn in his Foot, that has always made the
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Peace of <HI>Savoy</HI> lame and precarious: and <HI>France</HI>
has since made <HI>Pignerol</HI> one of the strongest
Fortresses in the World.</P>
<P>As the Cardinal, with all the Military part
of the Court, was in the Field; so the King,
to be near him, was gone with the Queen and
all the Court, just before I reached <HI>Paris,</HI> to reside
at <HI>Lyons.</HI> All these considered, there was no∣thing
to do at <HI>Paris:</HI> the Court looked like a
Citizen's House when the Family was all gone
into the Country: and I thought the whole City
looked very melancholy, compared to all the
fine things I had heard of it.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother and her Party were
chagrin at the Cardinal, who, tho' he owed his
Grandeur to her immediate Favour, was now
grown too great any longer to be at the Com∣mand
of Her Majesty, or indeed in her Interest;
and therefore the Queen was under Dissatisfa∣ction,
and Her Party looked very much down.</P>
<P>The Protestants were every where discon∣solate;
for the Losses they had received at
<HI>Rochel, Nismes,</HI> and <HI>Montpelier,</HI> had reduced them
to an absolute Dependence on the King's Will,
without all possible hopes of ever recovering
themselves, or being so much as in a Condition
to take Arms for their Religion; and therefore
the wisest of them plainly foresaw their own
entire Reduction, as it since came to pass: and I
remember vere well, that a Protestant Gentle∣man
told me once, as we were passing from
<HI>Orleans</HI> to <HI>Lyons,</HI> That the <HI>English</HI> had ruined
them; and therefore, says he, I think the next
Occasion the King takes to use us ill, as I know
'twill not be long, before he does, we must
all fly over to <HI>England,</HI> where you are bound
to maintain us for having helped to turn us out
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
of our own Country. I asked him what he
meant by saying the <HI>English</HI> had done it? He
returned short upon me; I do not mean, says
he, by not relieving <HI>Rochel,</HI> but by helping to
ruin <HI>Rochel,</HI> when you and the <HI>Dutch</HI> lent Ships
to beat our Fleet, which all the Ships in <HI>France</HI>
could not have done without you.</P>
<P>I was too young in the World to be very sensi∣ble
of this before, and therefore was something
startled at the Charge; but when I came to dis∣course
with this Gentleman, I soon saw, the
Truth of what he said was undeniable, and have
since reflected on it with regret, that the Naval
Power of the Protestants, which was then supe∣rior
to the Royal, would certainly have been the
Recovery of all their Fortunes, had it not been
unhappily broke by their Brethren of <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Holland,</HI> the former lending seven Men of War,
and the latter twenty, for the Destruction of the
<HI>Rocheller</HI>'s Fleet; and by those very Ships the
<HI>Rocheller</HI>'s Fleet were actually beaten and de∣stroyed,
and they never afterward recovered
their Force at Sea, and by consequence sunk
under the Siege, which the <HI>English</HI> afterwards in
vain attempted to prevent.</P>
<P>These things made the Protestants look very
dull, and expected the Ruin of all their Party;
which had certainly happened had the Cardinal
lived a few Years longer.</P>
<P>We stayed in <HI>Paris</HI> about three Weeks, as well
to see the Court, and what Rarities the Place
afforded, as by an Occasion which had like to
have put a short Period to our Ramble.</P>
<P>Walking one Morning before the Gate of
the <HI>Louvre,</HI> with a Design to see the <HI>Swiss</HI> Drawn
up, which they always did, and Exercised just
before they Relieved the Guards; a Page came up
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
to me, and speaking <HI>English</HI> to me, Sir, says he
the Captain must needs have your immediate
Assistance. I that had not the knowledge of any
Person in <HI>Paris</HI> but my own Companion, whom I
called Captain, had no room to question, but it
was he that sent for me; and crying out hastily
to him, Where, followed the Fellow as fast as
'twas possible: he led me thro' several Passages
which I knew not, and at last thro' a Tennis-Court,
and into a large Room where three Men,
like Gentlemen, were Engaged very briskly,
two against one: the Room was very dark, so
that I could not easily know them asunder; but
being fully possessed with an Opinion before of
my Captain's Danger, I ran into the Room with
my Sword in my Hand: I had not particular∣ly
Engaged any of them, nor so much as made
a Pass at any, when I received a very dangerous
Thrust in my Thigh, rather occasioned by my
hasty running in, than a real Design of the
Person; but enraged at the Hurt, without
examining who it was hurt me, I threw my self
upon him, and run my Sword quite thro' his
Body.</P>
<P>The Novelty of the Adventure, and the
unexpected Fall of the Man by a Stranger come
in no Body knew how, had becalmed the other
two, that they really stood gazing at me. By
this Time I had discovered that my Captain
was not there, and that 'twas some strange
Accident brought me thither. I could speak
but little <HI>French,</HI> and supposed they could speak
no <HI>English:</HI> so I stepped to the Door to see for the
Page that brought me thither: but seeing no
body there, and the Passage clear, I made off as
fast as I could, without speaking a Word; nor
did the other two Gentlemen offer to stop me.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20"/>
But I was in a strange Confusion when coming
into those Entries and Passages which the Page
led me thro', I could by no means find my way
out; at last seeing a Door open that looked
through a House into the Street, I went in, and
out at the other Door; but then I was at as
great a Loss to know where I was, and which
was the way to my Lodging. The Wound in my
Thigh bled apace, and I could feel the Blood in
my Breeches. In this Interval came by a
Chair, I called, and went into it, and bid them,
as well as I could, go to the <HI>Louvre;</HI> for tho' I
knew not the Name of the Street were I lodged,
I knew I could find the way to it when I was
at the <HI>Bastile.</HI> The Chair-Men went on their
own Way, and being stopp'd by a Company of the
Guards as they went, set me down till the Soul∣diers
were marched by; when looking out I found
I was just at my own Lodging, and the Captain
was standing at the Door looking for me; I beckon∣ed
him to me, and whispering told him I was
very much hurt, but bid him pay the Chair∣men,
and ask no Questions but come to me.</P>
<P>I made the best of my Way up Stairs, but had
lost so much Blood that I had hardly Spirits
enough to keep me from swooning till he came
in: He was equally concerned with me to see
me in such a bloody Condition, and presently
called up our Landlord, and he as quickly called
in his Neighbours, that I had a Room full of
People about me in a quarter of an Hour. But
this had like to have been of worse Consequence
to me than the other; for by this Time there
was great enquiring after the Person who killed
a Man at the Tennis-Court. My Landlord was
then sensible of his Mistake, and came to me,
and told me the Danger I was in, and very honest∣ly
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
offered to convey me to a Friend's of his,
where I should be very secure; I thanked him,
and suffered my self to be carried at Midnight
whether he pleased; he visited me very often
till I was well enough to walk about, which was
not in less than ten Days, and then we thought
fit to be gone, so we took Post for <HI>Orleans;</HI> but
when I came upon the Road I found my self in
a new Error, for my Wound opened again with
riding, and I was in a worse Condition than be∣fore,
being forced to take up at a little Village
on the Road, called about Miles from
<HI>Orleans,</HI> where there was no Surgeon to be had,
but a sorry Country Barber, who nevertheless
dressed me as well as he could, and in about a
Week more I was able to walk to <HI>Orleans</HI> at three
times.</P>
<P>Here I staid till I was quite well, and then
took Coach for <HI>Lyons,</HI> and so through <HI>Savoy</HI> into
<HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I spent near two Years Time after this bad be∣ginning
in travelling through <HI>Italy,</HI> and to the
several Courts of <HI>Rome, Naples, Venice</HI> and <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>When I came to <HI>Lyons</HI> the King was gone from
thence to <HI>Grenoble</HI> to meet the Cardinal, but the
Queens were both at <HI>Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Affairs seemed at this Time to
have but an indifferent Aspect; there was no
Life in any Thing but where the Cardinal was,
he pushed on every Thing with extraordinary
Conduct, and generally with Success; he had
taken <HI>Suza</HI> and <HI>Pignerol</HI> from the Duke of <HI>Sa∣voy,</HI>
and was preparing to push the Duke even out
of all his Dominions.</P>
<P>But in the mean Time every where else
Things looked ill; the Troops were ill paid,
the Magazines empty, the People mutinous, and
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
a general Disorder seized the Minds of the
Court; and the Cardinal, who was the Soul of
every Thing, desired this Interview at <HI>Grenoble,</HI>
in order to put Things into some better Method.</P>
<P>This politick Minister always ordered Mat∣ters
so, that if there was Success in any Thing
the Glory was his; but if Things miscarried it
was all laid upon the King. This Conduct was
so much the more Nice, as it is the direct con∣trary
to the Custom in like Cases, where Kings
assume the Glory of all the Success in an Acti∣on;
and when a Thing miscarries make them∣selves
easie by sacrificing their Ministers and Fa∣vourites
to the Complaints and Resentments of
the People; but this accurate refined Statesman
got over this Point.</P>
<P>While we were at <HI>Lyons,</HI> and as I remember,
the third Day after our coming thither, we had
like to have been involved in a State Broil, with∣out
knowing where we were; it was of a <HI>Sun∣day</HI>
in the Evening, the People of <HI>Lyons,</HI> who
had been sorely oppressed in Taxes, and the War
in <HI>Italy</HI> pinching their Trade, began to be very
tumultuous; we found the Day before the Mob
got together in great Crouds, and talked oddly;
the King was every where reviled, and spoken
disrespectfully of, and the Magistrates of the Ci∣ty
either winked at, or durst not attempt to
meddle, left they should provoke the People.</P>
<P>But on <HI>Sunday</HI> Night, about Midnight, we was
waked by a prodigious Noise in the Street; I
jumpt out of Bed, and running to the Window,
I saw the Street as full of Mob as it could hold,
some armed with Musquets and Halbards, march∣ed
in very good Order; others in disorderly
Crouds, all shouting and crying out <HI>du Paix le
Roy,</HI> and the like: One that led a great Party
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
of this Rabble carried a Loaf of Bread upon the
Top of a Pike, and other lesser Loaves, signi∣fying
the Smallness of their Bread, occasioned
by Dearness.</P>
<P>By Morning this Croud was gathered to a
great Heighth, they run roving over the whole
City, shut up all the Shops, and forced all the
People to join with them from thence; they
went up to the Castle, and renewing the Cla∣mour,
a strange Consternation seized all the
Princes.</P>
<P>They broke open the Doors of the Officers,
Collectors of the new Taxes, and plundered their
Houses, and had not the Persons themselves fled
in time they had been very ill treated.</P>
<P>The Queen Mother, as she was very much dis∣pleased
to see such Consequences of the Govern∣ment,
in whose Management she had no Share,
so I suppose she had the less Concern upon her.
However, she came into the Court of the Castle
and shewed her self to the People, gave Money
amongst them, and spoke gently to them; and
by a Way peculiar to her self, and which obli∣ged
all she talked with, she pacified the Mob
gradually, sent them home with Promises of Re∣dress
and the like; and so appeased this Tu∣mult
in two Days, by her Prudence, which the
Guards in the Castle had small Mind to meddle
with, and if they had, would, in all Probability,
have made the better Side the worse.</P>
<P>There had been several Seditions of the like Na∣ture
in sundry other Parts of <HI>France,</HI> and the very
Army began to murmur, though not to mutiny,
for want of Provisions.</P>
<P>This Sedition at <HI>Lyons</HI> was not quite over when
we left the Place, for, finding the City all in a
Broil, we considered we had no Business there, and
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
what the Consequence of a popular Tumult might
be, we did not see, so we prepared to be gone.
We had not rid above three Miles out of the
City but we were brought as Prisoners of War,
by a Party of Mutineers, who had been abroad
upon the Scout, and were charged with being
Messengers sent to the Cardinal for Forces to
reduce the Citizens: With these Pretences they
brought us back in Triumph, and the Queen
Mother being by this Time grown something fa∣miliar
to them, they carried us before her.</P>
<P>When they enquired of us who we were, we
called our selves <HI>Scots;</HI> for as the <HI>English</HI> were very
much out of Favour in <HI>France</HI> at this Time, the
Peace having been made not many Months, and
not supposed to be very durable, because parti∣cularly
displeasing to the People of <HI>England;</HI> so
the <HI>Scots</HI> were on the other Extreme with the
<HI>French.</HI> Nothing was so much caressed as the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and a Man had no more to do in <HI>France,</HI> if
he would be well received there, than to say he
was a <HI>Scotchman.</HI></P>
<P>When we came before the Queen Mother she
seemed to receive us with some Stiffness at first,
and caused her Guards to take us into Custody;
but as she was a Lady of most exquisite Politicks,
she did this to amuse the Mob, and we were im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ediately
after dismissed; and the Queen her self
made a handsome Excuse to us for the Rude∣ness
we had suffered, alledging the Troubles of
the Times; and the next Morning we had three
Dragoons of the Guards to convoy us out of the
Jurisdiction of <HI>Lyons.</HI></P>
<P>I confess this little Adventure gave me an
Aversion to popular Tumults all my Life after,
and if nothing else had been in the Cause, would
have byassed me to espouse the King's Party in
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
<HI>England,</HI> when our popular Heats carried all be∣fore
it at home.</P>
<P>But I must say, that when I called to mind
since the Address, the Management, the Com∣pliance
in shew, and in general the whole Con∣duct
of the Queen Mother with the mutinous
People of <HI>Lyons,</HI> and compared it with the Con∣duct
of my unhappy Master the King of <HI>England,</HI>
I could not but see that the Queen understood
much better than King <HI>Charles,</HI> the Management
of Politicks, and the Clamours of the People.</P>
<P>Had this Princess been at the Helm in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
the would have prevented all the Calami∣ties
of the Civil War here, and yet not have
parted with what that good Prince yielded in
order to Peace neither; she would have yield∣ed
gradually, and then gained upon them gra∣dually;
she would have managed them to the
Point she had designed them, as she did all Par∣ties
in <HI>France;</HI> and none could effectually subject
her, but the very Man she had raised to be her
principal Support; I mean the Cardinal.</P>
<P>We went from hence to <HI>Grenoble,</HI> and arrived
there the same Day that the King and the Car∣dinal,
with the whole Court, went out to view
a Body of 6000 <HI>Swiss</HI> Foot, which the Cardinal
had wheedled the Cantons to grant to the King
to help ruin their Neighbour the Duke of
<HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>The Troops were exceeding fine, well accou∣tred,
brave, cleail-limbed, stout Fellows indeed.
Here I saw the Cardinal; there was an Air of
Church Gravity in his Habit, but all the Vigor
of a General, and the Sprightliness of a vast
Genius in his Face; he affected a little Stiffness
in his Behaviour, but managed all his Affairs
with such Clearness such Steddiness, and such
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
Application, that it was no Wonder he had such
Success in every Undertaking.</P>
<P>Here I saw the King, whose Figure was mean,
his Countenance hollow, and always seemed
dejected, and every Way discovering that Weak∣ness
in his Countenance that appeared in his
Actions.</P>
<P>If he was ever sprightly and vigorous it was
when the Cardinal was with him; for he depended
so much on every Thing he did, that he was
at the utmost Dilemma when he was absent,
always timorous, jealous and irresolute.</P>
<P>After the Review the Cardinal was absent
some Days, having been to wait on the Queen
Mother at <HI>Lyons,</HI> where, as it was discoursed,
they were at least seemingly reconciled.</P>
<P>I observed while the Cardinal was gone there
was no Court, the King was seldom to be seen,
very small Attendance given, and no Bustle at
the Castle; but as soon as the Cardinal returned
the great Councils were assembled, the Coaches
of the Ambassadors went every Day to the
Castle, and a Face of Business appeared upon the
whole Court.</P>
<P>Here the Measures of the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s
Rune were concerted, and in Order to it the
King and the Cardinal put themselves at the Head
of the Army, with which they immediately
reduced all <HI>Savoy,</HI> took <HI>Chamberry</HI> and the whole
Dutchy except <HI>Montmelian.</HI></P>
<P>The Army that did this was not above 22000
Men, including the <HI>Swiss,</HI> and but indifferent
Troops neither, especally the <HI>French</HI> Foot, who
compared to the Infantry I have since seen in
the <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Swedish Armies,</HI> were not fit to
be called Soldiers. On the other hand, consi∣dering
the <HI>Savoyards</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Troops, they
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
were good Troops; but the Cardinal's Conduct
made amends for all these Deficiencies.</P>
<P>From hence I went to <HI>Pignerol,</HI> which was
then little more than a single Fortification on
the Hill near the Town called St. <HI>Bride's;</HI> but
the Situation of that was very strong: I mention
this because of the prodigious Works since added
to it, by which it has since obtained the Name
of the Right Hand of <HI>France;</HI> they had begun
a New Line below the Hill, and some Works
were marked out on the Side of the Town next
the Fort; but the Cardinal afterwards drew
the Plan of the Works with his own Hand, by
which it was made one of the strongest
Fortresses in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Pignerol</HI> the Governor of <HI>Milan</HI>
for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came with an Army and sat
down before <HI>Casal.</HI> The Grand Quarrel and
for which the War in this Part of <HI>Italy</HI> was
begun, was this; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Germans</HI> pre∣tended
to the Dutchy of <HI>Mantua;</HI> the Duke of
<HI>Nevers,</HI> a French Man, had not only a Title to it,
but had got Possession of it, but being ill supported
by the <HI>French,</HI> was beaten out by the <HI>Imperialists,</HI>
and after a long Siege the <HI>Germans</HI> took <HI>Mantua</HI>
it self, and drove the poor Duke quite out of
the Country.</P>
<P>The taking of <HI>Mantua</HI> elevated the Spirits of
the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI>
being now at more Leisure, with a compleat Army
came to his Assistance, and formed the Siege of
<HI>Montferrat.</HI></P>
<P>For as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pushed the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI>
so the <HI>French</HI> by Way of Diversion lay hard upon
the Duke of <HI>Savoy;</HI> they had seized <HI>Montferrat,</HI>
and held it for the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> and had a
strong <HI>French</HI> Garrison under <HI>Thoiras,</HI> a brave and
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
experienced Commander; and thus Affairs stood
when we came into the <HI>French</HI> Army.</P>
<P>I had no Business there, as a Soldier, but having
passed as a <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentleman with the Mob at
<HI>Lyons,</HI> and after with her Majesty, the Queen
Mother, when we obtained the Guard of her
Dragoons; we had also her Majesty's Pass, with
which we came and went where we pleased; and
the Cardinal, who was then not on very good
Terms with the Queen, but willing to keep
smooth Water there, when two or three times
our Passes came to be examined, shewed a more
than ordinary Respect to us on that very account,
our Passes being from the Queen.</P>
<P><HI>Casal</HI> being besieged, as I have observed, began
to be in Danger, for the Cardinal, who 'twas
thought had formed a Design to ruin <HI>Savoy,</HI> was
more intent upon that than upon the Succour of
the Duke of <HI>Mantua;</HI> but Necessity calling
upon him to deliver so great a Captain as <HI>Thoiras,</HI>
and not to let ssch a Place as <HI>Casal</HI> fall into the
Hands of the Enemy, the King, or Cardinal
rather, order'd the Duke of <HI>Momorency</HI> and the
Mareschal D' <HI>Effiat,</HI> with 10000 Foot and 2000
Horse, to march and joyn the Mareschals <HI>De la
Force</HI> and <HI>Schomberg,</HI> who lay already with an
Army on the Frontiers of <HI>Genoa,</HI> but too weak to
attempt the raising the Siege of <HI>Casal.</HI></P>
<P>As all Men thought there would be a Battle
between the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I could not
prevail with my self to lose the Opportunity,
and therefore by the Help of the Passes abovemen∣tioned,
I came to the <HI>French</HI> Army under the Duke
of <HI>Momorency;</HI> we marched through the Enemy's
Country with great Boldness and no small
Hazard, for the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> appeared fre∣quently
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
with great Bodies of Horse on the
Rear of the Army, and frequently skirmished
with our Troops, in one of which I had the
Folly, <HI>I can call it no better, for I had no Business
there,</HI> to go out and see the Sport, as the <HI>French</HI>
Gentlemen called it; I was but a raw Soldier,
and did not like the Sport at all, for this Party
was surrounded by the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and almost
all killed, for as to Quarter, they neither asked
nor gave; I run away very fairly one of the
first, and my Companion with me, and by the
Goodness of our Horses got out of the Fray, and
being not much known in the Army, we came into
the Camp an hour or two after, as if we had
been only riding abroad for the Air.</P>
<P>This little Rout made the General very cauti∣ous,
for the <HI>Savoyards</HI> were stronger in Horse by
3 or 4000, and the Army always marched in a
Body, and kept their Parties in or very near
Hand.</P>
<P>I'scaped another Rub in this <HI>French</HI> Army
about five Days after, which had liked to have
made me pay dear for my Curiosity.</P>
<P>The Duke <HI>de Mormorency</HI> and the Mareschal
<HI>Schomberg</HI> joined their Army above four or five
Days after, and immediately, according to the
Cardinal's Instructions, put themselves on the
March for the Relief of <HI>Casal.</HI></P>
<P>The Army had marched over a great Plain,
with some marshy Grounds on the Right, and
the <HI>Po</HI> on the Left, and as the Country was
so well discovered that 'twas thought impossible
any Mischief should happen, the Generals observed
the less Caution. At the End of this Plain was
a long Wood, and a Lane or narrow Defile thro'
the Middle of it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="30"/>
Thro' this Pass the Army was to march, and
the Van began to file through it about four a
Clock; by three Hours Time all the Army was
got through, or into the Pass, and the Artillery
was just entred when the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> with
4000 Horse and 1500 Dragoons, with every
Horse-man a Foot-man behind him; whether he
had swam the <HI>Po,</HI> or passed it above at a Bridge,
and made a long March after, was not examined,
but he came boldly up the Plain and charged our
Rear with a great deal of Fury.</P>
<P>Our Artillery was in the Lane, and as it was
impossible to turn them about, and make way
for the Army, so the Rear was obliged to sap∣port
themselves, and maintain the Fight for above
an Hour and a half.</P>
<P>In this Time we lost abundance of Men, and
if it had not been for two Accidents all that Line
had been cut off; one was, that the Wood was
so near that those Regiments which were dis∣ordered
presently sheltred themselves in the
Wood; the other was, that by this Time the
Mareschal <HI>Schomberg,</HI> with the Horse of the Van,
began to get back through the Lane, and to
make good the Ground from whence the other
had been beaten, till at last by this Means it
came to almost a pitched Battle.</P>
<P>There were two Regiments of <HI>French</HI> Dragoons
who did excellent Service in this Action, and
maintained their Ground till they were almost
all killed.</P>
<P>Had the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> contented himself with
the Defeat of five Regiments on the Right, which
he quite broke and drove into the Wood, and
with the Slaughter and Havock which he had
made among the rest, he had come off with
Honour, and might have called it a Victory;
<PB N="25" REF="31"/>
but endeavouring to break the whole Party,
and carry off some Cannon, the obstinate Resi∣stance
of these few Dragoons lost him his Advan∣tages,
and held him in play till so many fresh
Troops got through the Pass again, as made us
too strong for him; and had not Night parted
them he had been entirely defeated.</P>
<P>At last finding our Troops encrease and spread
themselves on his Flank, he retired and gave over,
we had no great Stomach to pursue him neither,
tho' some Horse were ordered to follow a little
Way.</P>
<P>The Duke lost above a thousand Men, and we
almost twice as many, and but for those Dragoons,
had lost the whole Rear-guard and half our Can∣non.
I was in a very sorry Case in this Action
too, I was with the Rear in the Regiment of
Horse of <HI>Perigoort,</HI> with a Captain of which Re∣giment
I had contracted some Acquaintance; I
would have rid off at first, as the Captain de∣sired
me, but there was no doing it, for the
Cannon was in the Lane, and the Horse and
Dragoons of the Van eagerly pressing back
through the Lane, must have run me down,
or carried me with them: As for the Wood,
it was a good Shelter to save ones Life, but was
so thick there was no passing it on Horseback.</P>
<P>Our Regiment was one of the first that was
broke, and being all in Confusion, with the Duke
of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Men at our Heels, away we ran into the
Wood; never was there so much Disorder among
a Parcel of Runaways as when we came to this
Wood, it was so exceeding bushy and thick at
the Bottom there was no entring it, and a Volley
of small Shot from a Regiment of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Dra∣goons
poured in upon us at our breaking into the
Wood made terrible Work among our Horses.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="32"/>
For my Part I was got into the Wood, but
was forced to quit my Horse, and by that means
with a great deal of Difficulty got a little farther
in, where there was a little open Place, and being
quite spent with labouring among the Bushes, I
sat down resolving to take my Fate there, let it
be what it would, for I was not able to go any
farther; I had twenty or thirty more in the
same Condition came to me in less than half an
Hour, and here we waited very securely the
Success of the Battle, which was as before.</P>
<P>It was no small Relief to those with me to
hear the <HI>Savoyards</HI> were beaten, for otherwise
they had all been lost; as for me, I confess, I
was glad as it was, because of the Danger, but
otherwise I cared not much which had the bet∣ter,
for I designed no Service among them.</P>
<P>One Kindness it did me, that I began to consi∣der
what I had to do here, and as I could give but
a very slender Account of my self for what it was
I run all these Risques, so I resolved they
should fight it out among themselves, for I would
come among them no more.</P>
<P>The Captain with whom, as I noted above, I
had contracted some Acquaintance in this Regi∣ment,
was killed in this Action, and the <HI>French</HI> had
really a great Blow here, though they took Care
to conceal it all they could; and I cannot, with∣out
smiling, read some of the Histories and
Memoirs of this Action, which they are not
ashamed to call a Victory.</P>
<P>We marched on to <HI>Saluces,</HI> and the next Day
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> presented himself in Batallia
on the other Side of a small River giving us
a fair Challenge to pass and engage him: We
always said in our Camp that the Orders were to
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
fight the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> where-ever we met him;
but tho' he braved us in our View, we did not
care to engage him, but we brought <HI>Saluces</HI> to
surrender upon Articles, which the Duke could
not relieve without attacking our Camp, which
he did not care to do.</P>
<P>The next Morning we had News of the Sur∣render
of <HI>Mantua</HI> to the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army; we heard
of it first from the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI>'s Cannon, which
he fired by way of Rejoycing, and which seemed
to make him Amends for the loss of <HI>Saluces.</HI></P>
<P>As this was a Mortification to the <HI>French,</HI> so
it quite damped the Success of the Campaign,
for the Duke <HI>de Momorency</HI> imagining that the
<HI>Imperial</HI> General would send immediate Assistance
to the Marquis <HI>Spinola,</HI> who besieged <HI>Casal,</HI> they
call'd frequent Councils of War what Course to
take, and at last resolved to halt in <HI>Piedmont.</HI></P>
<P>A few Days after their Resolutions were
changed again, by the News of the Death of
the Duke of <HI>Savoy, Charles Emanuel,</HI> who died, as
some say, agitated with the Extreams of Joy and
Grief.</P>
<P>This put our Generals upon considering again,
whether they should march to the Relief of
<HI>Casal,</HI> but the Chimera of the <HI>Germans</HI> put them
by, and so they took up Quarters in <HI>Piedmont;</HI>
they took several small Places from the Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> making Advantage of the Consternation
the Duke's Subjects were in on the Death of their
Prince, and spread themselves from the Sea-side
to the Banks of the <HI>Po.</HI></P>
<P>But here an Enemy did that for them which
the <HI>Savoyards</HI> could not, for the Plague got into
their Quarters and destroyed abundance of Peo∣ple,
both of the Army and of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="34"/>
I thought then it was Time for me to be
gone, for I had no manner of Courage for that
Risque; and I think verily I was more afraid
of being taken sick in a strange Country, than
ever I was of being killed in Battle. Upon this
Resolution I procured a Pass to go for <HI>Genoa,</HI> and
acordingly began my Journey, but was arrested at
<HI>Villa Franca</HI> by a slow lingring Fever, which held
me about five Days, and then turned to a burn∣ing
Malignancy, and at last to the Plague: My
Friend, the Captain, never left me Night nor
Day; and though for four Days more I knew
no Body, nor was capable of so much as think∣ing
of my self, yet it pleased God that the Di∣stemper
gathered in my Neck, swelled and broke;
during the Swelling I was raging mad with the
Violence of Pain, which being so near my Head,
swelled that also in Proportion, that my Eyes
were swelled up, and for twenty four Hours my
Tongue and Mouth; then, as my Servant told
me, all the Physicians gave me over, as past all
Remedy, but by the good Providence of God
the Swelling broke.</P>
<P>The prodigious Collection of Matter which
this Swelling discharged, gave me immediate Re∣lief,
and I became sensible in less than an Hour's
Time; and in two Hours, or thereabouts, fell
into a little Slumber which recovered my Spi∣rits,
and sensibly revived me. Here I lay by it
till the Middle of <HI>September,</HI> my Captain fell sick
after me, but recovered quickly; his Man had
the Plague, and died in two Days; my Man
held it out well.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>September</HI> we heard of a
Truce concluded between all Parties, and being
unwilling to winter at <HI>Villa Franca,</HI> I got Passes,
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
and though we were both but weak began to
travel in Litters for <HI>Milan.</HI></P>
<P>And here I experienced the Truth of an old
<HI>English</HI> Proverb, <HI>That Standers-by see more than the
Gamesters.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French, Savoyards</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> made this
Peace or Truce all for separate and several
Grounds, and every one were mistaken.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> yielded to it because they had given
over the Relief of <HI>Casal,</HI> and were very much
afraid it would fall into the Hands of the Mar∣quiss
<HI>Spinola.</HI> The <HI>Savoyards</HI> yielded to it be∣cause
they were afraid the <HI>French</HI> would winter
in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> yielded to it because the
Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> being dead, and the Count <HI>de Co∣lalto,</HI>
the <HI>Imperial</HI> General, giving no Assistance,
and his Army weakened by Sickness and the Fa∣tigues
of the Siege, he foresaw he should never
take the Town, and wanted but to come off
with Honour.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> were mistaken, because really <HI>Spi∣nola</HI>
was so weak, that had they marched on into
<HI>Montferrat</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> must have raised the Siege;
the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was mistaken, because the
Plague had so weakened the <HI>French</HI> that they
durst not have staid to winter in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> and
<HI>Spinola</HI> was mistaken, for tho' he was very slow,
if he had staid before the Town one Fortnight
longer <HI>Thoiras</HI> the Governour must have sur∣rendred,
being brought to the last Extremity.</P>
<P>Of all these Mistakes the <HI>French</HI> had the Ad∣vantage,
for <HI>Casal</HI> was relieved, the Army had
Time to be recruited, and the <HI>French</HI> had the best
of it by an early Campaign.</P>
<P>I past through <HI>Montferrat</HI> in my Way to
<HI>Milan</HI> just as the Truce was declared, and saw
the miserable Remains of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, who
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
by Sickness, Fatigue, hard Duty, the Sallies of
the Garrison, and such like Consequences, were
reduced to less than 2000 Men, and of them
above 1000 lay wounded and sick in the
Camp.</P>
<P>Here were several Reigments which I saw
drawn out to their Arms that could not make
up above 70 or 80 Men, Officers and all, and
those half starved with Hunger, almost naked,
and in a lamentable Condition. From thence I
went into the Town, and there Things were
still in a worse Condition, the Houses beaten
down, the Walls and Works ruined, the Gar∣rison,
by continual Duty, reduced from 4500
Men to less than 800, without Clothes, Money, or
Provisions. The brave Governour weak with
continual Fatigue, and the whole Face of things
in a miserable Case.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Generals had just sent them Thir∣ty
Thousand Crowns for present Supply, which
heartened them a little, but had not the Truce
been made as it was, they must have surrendred
upon what Terms the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had pleased to
make them.</P>
<P>Never were two Armies in such Fear of one
another with so little Cause; the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
afraid of the <HI>French</HI> whom the Plague had de∣voured,
and the <HI>French</HI> afraid of the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
whom the Siege had almost ruined.</P>
<P>The Grief of this Mistake, together with the
Sense of his Master, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> leaving him
without Supplies to compleat the Siege of
<HI>Casal,</HI> so affected the Marquess <HI>Spinola</HI> that
he died for Grief, and in him fell the last of
that rare breed of <HI>Low Country</HI> Soldiers who
gave the World so great and just a Character
of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Infantry as the best Soldiers of the
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
World; a Character which we see them so very
much degenerated from since, that they hardly
deserve the Name of Soldiers.</P>
<P>I tarried at <HI>Milan</HI> the rest of the Winter, both
for the Recovery of my Health, and also for
Supplies from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Here it was I first heard the Name of <HI>Gusta∣vus
Adolphus,</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who now be∣gan
his War with the Emperor; and while the
King of <HI>France</HI> was at <HI>Lyons,</HI> the League with
<HI>Sweden</HI> was made, in which the <HI>French</HI> contributed
1200000 Crowns in Money, and 600000 <HI>per An.</HI>
to the Attempt of <HI>Gustavus Adolphus:</HI> About this
Time he landed in <HI>Pomerania,</HI> took the Towns of
<HI>Stetin</HI> and <HI>Straelsund,</HI> and from thence proceeded
in that prodigious Manner, of which I shall have
Occasion to be very particular in the Prosecu∣tion
of these Memoirs.</P>
<P>I had indeed no Thoughts of seeing that King,
or his Armies, I had been so roughly handled
already that I had given over the Thoughts of
appearing among the fighting People, and resol∣ved
in the Spring to pursue my Journey to <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
and so for the rest of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Yet I cannot deny, that as every Gazette gave
us some Accounts of the Conquests and Victo∣ries
of this glorious Prince, it prepossessed my
Thoughts with secret Wishes of seeing him, but
these were so young and unsettled, that I drew no
Resolutions from them for a long while after.</P>
<P>About the Middle of <HI>January</HI> I left <HI>Milan</HI> and
came to <HI>Genoa,</HI> from thence by Sea to <HI>Leghorn,</HI>
then to <HI>Naples, Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> but saw nothing
in <HI>Italy</HI> that gave me any Diversion.</P>
<P>As for what is modern, I saw nothing but
Lewdness, private Murthers, stabbing Men at the
Corner of a Street, or in the dark, hiring of
<PB N="32" REF="38"/>
Bravoes, and the like; all the Diversions here
ended in Whoring, Gaming and Sodomy, these
were to me the modern Excellencies of <HI>Italy;</HI>
and I had no Gust to Antiquities.</P>
<P>'Twas pleasant indeed when I was at <HI>Rome</HI> to
say here stood the Capitol, there the Colossus of
<HI>Nero,</HI> here was the Amphitheatre of <HI>Titus,</HI> there
the Aqueduct of—here the Forum, there the
Catacombs, here the Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> there of
<HI>Jupiter,</HI> here the Pantheon, and the like; but I
never designed to write a Book, as much as was
useful I kept in my Head; and for the rest, I
left it to others.</P>
<P>I observed the People degenerated from the an∣cient
glorious Inhabitants, who were generous,
brave, and the most valiant of all Nations, to a
vicious Baseness of Soul, barbarous, treacherous,
jealous and revengeful, lewd and cowardly, in∣tolerably
proud and haughty, bigotted to blind,
incoherent Devotion, and the grossest of Idolatry.</P>
<P>Indeed I think the Unsuitableness of the Peo∣ple
made the Place unpleasant to me, for there
is so little in a Country to recommend it when
the People disgrace it, that no Beauties of the
Creation can make up for the Want of those
Excellencies which suitable Society procure the
Defect of; this made <HI>Italy</HI> a very unpleasant
Country to me, the People were the Foil to the
Place, all manner of hateful Vices reigning in
their general Way of living.</P>
<P>I confess I was not very religious my self, and
being come abroad into the World young enough,
might easily have been drawn into Evils that
had recommended themselves with any tolerable
Agreeableness to Nature and common Manners;
but when Wickedness presented it self full grown
in its grossest Freedoms and Liberties, it quite took
<PB N="33" REF="39"/>
away all the Gust to Vice that the Devil had
furnished me with, and in this I cannot but relate
one Scene which passed between no Body but
the Devil and my self.</P>
<P>At a certain Town in <HI>Italy,</HI> which shall be
nameless, because I won't celebrate the Proficiency
of one Place more than another, when I believe
the whole Country equally wicked, I was pre∣vailed
upon rather than tempted, <HI>a la Courtezan.</HI></P>
<P>If I should describe the Woman I must give
a very mean Character of my own Virtue to say
I was allured by any but a Woman of an ex∣traordinary
Figure; her Face, Shape, Mein, and
Dress, I may, without Vanity, say, the finest that
I ever saw: When I had Admittance into her
Apartments, the Riches and Magnificence of them
astonished me, the Cupboard or Cabinet of Plate,
the Jewels, the Capestry, and every Thing in
Proportion, made me question whether I was not
in the Chamber of some Lady of the best Quality;
—but when after some Conversation I found
that it was really nothing but a Courtezan, in
<HI>English,</HI> a common Street Whore, a Punk of the
Trade, I was amazed, and my Inclination to her
Person began to cool; her Conversation exceed∣ed
if possible, the best of Quality, and was, I
must own, exceeding agreeable; she sung to her
Lute, and danced as fine as ever I saw, and thus
diverted me two Hours before any Thing else
was discoursed of;—but when the vicious Part
came on the Stage, I blush to relate the Con∣fusion
I was in, and when she made a certain
Motion by which I understood she might be
made use of, either as a Lady, or as—I was
quite Thunder-struck, all the vicious Part of my
Thoughts vanished, the Place filled me with Hor∣ror,
and I was all over Disorder and Distraction.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="40"/>
I began however to recollect where I was, and
that in this Country these were People not to
be affronted; and though she easily saw the Dis∣order
I was in, she turned it off with ad∣mirable
Dexterity, began to talk again <HI>a la Gal∣lant,</HI>
received me as a Visitant, offered me Sweet∣meats
and some Wine.</P>
<P>Here I began to be in more Confusion than
before, for I concluded she would neither offer
me to eat or to drink now <HI>without Poison,</HI> and I
was very shy of tasting her Treat, but she scat∣tered
this Fear immediately, by readily, and of
her own accord, not only tasting but eating free∣ly
of every Thing she gave me; whether she per∣ceived
my Wariness, or the Reason of it, I know
not, I could not help banishing my Suspicion,
the obliging Carriage and strange Charm of her
Conversation had so much Power of me, that
I both eat and drank with her at all Hazards.</P>
<P>When I offered to go, and at parting present∣ed
her five Pistoles, I could not prevail with
her to take them, when she spoke some <HI>Italian</HI>
Proverb which I could not readily understand,
but by my Guess it seemed to imply, that <HI>she would
not take the Pay, having not obliged me otherwise:</HI> At
last I laid the Pieces on her Toilet, and would
not receive them again; upon which she obliged
me to pass ray Word to visit her again, else she
would by no Means accept my Present.</P>
<P>I confess I had a strong Inclination to visit her
again, and besides thought my self obliged to
it in Honour to my Parole; but after some Strife
in my Thoughts about it, I resolved to break my
Word with her, when going at Vespers one
Evening to see their Devotions, I happened to
meet this very Lady very devoutly going to her
Prayers.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="41"/>
At her coming out of the Church I spoke to
her, she paid me her Respects with a <HI>Seignior Inglese,</HI>
and some Words she said in <HI>Spanish</HI> smiling, which
I did not understand; I cannot say here so clear∣ly
as I would be glad I might, that I broke my
Word with her; but if I saw her any more I
saw nothing of what gave me so much Offence
before.</P>
<P>The End of my relating this Story is answer∣ed
in describing the Manner of their Address,
without bringing my felf to Confession; if I
did any Thing I have some Reason to be ashamed
of, it may be a less Crime to conceal it than ex∣pose
it.</P>
<P>The Particulars related however, may lead the
Reader of these Sheets to a View of what gave
me a particular Disgust at this pleasant Part of
the World, as they pretend to call it, and made
me quit the Place sooner than Travellers use
to do that come thither to satisfy their Cu∣riosity.</P>
<P>The prodigious stupid Bigottry of the People
also was irksome to me; I thought there was
something in it very sordid, the entire Empire
the Priests have over both the Souls and Bodies
of the People, gave me a Specimen of that Mean∣ness
of Spirit which is no where else to be seen
but in <HI>Italy,</HI> especially in the City of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Venice</HI> I perceived it quite different, the
Civil Authority having a visible Superiority over
the Ecclesiastick; and the Church being more
subject there to the State than in any other Part
of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>For these Reasons I took no Pleasure in fil∣ling
my Memoirs of <HI>Italy</HI> with Remarks of Places
or Things, all the Antiquities and valuable Re∣mains
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Nation are done better than
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
I can pretend to by such People who made it
more their Business; as for me, I went to see, and
not to write, and as little thought then of these
Memoirs, as I ill furnished my self to write them.</P>
<P>I left <HI>Italy</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> and taking the Tour of
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> though very much out of the Way, I
passed through <HI>Munick, Passaw, Lints,</HI> and at last
to <HI>Vienna.</HI></P>
<P>I came to <HI>Vienna</HI> the 10th of <HI>April</HI> 1631, in∣tending
to have gone from thence down the <HI>Da∣nube</HI>
into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and by Means of a Pass which
I had obtained from the <HI>English</HI> Ambassador at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> I designed to have seen all those
great Towns on the <HI>Danube</HI> which were then in
the Hands of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and which I had read much
of in the History of the War between the <HI>Turks</HI>
and the <HI>Germans;</HI> but I was diverted from my
Design by the following Occasion.</P>
<P>There had been a long bloody War in the
Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> for 12 Years, between the
Emperor, the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the King of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and the Popish Princes and Electors on
the one Side, and the Protestant Princes on the
other; and both Sides having been exhausted
by the War, and even the Catholicks themselves
beginning to dislike the growing Power of the
House of <HI>Austria,</HI> 'twas thought all Parties were
willing to make Peace.</P>
<P>Nay, Things were brought to that Pass that
some of the Popish Princes and Electors began
to talk of making Alliances with the King of
<HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is necessary to observe, that the two
Dukes of <HI>Mecklenburgh</HI> having been dispossessed
of most of their Dominions by the Tyranny of
the Emperor <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and being in danger of
losing the rest, earnestly sollicited the King of
<PB N="37" REF="43"/>
<HI>Sweden</HI> to come to their Assistance; and that Prince,
as he was related to the House of <HI>Mecklen∣burgh,</HI>
and especially as he was willing to lay
hold of any Opportunity to break with the Em∣peror,
against whom he had laid up an impla∣cable
Prejudice, was very ready and forward to
come to their Assistance.</P>
<P>The Reasons of his Quarrel with the Empe∣ror
were grounded upon the <HI>Imperialists</HI> concern∣ing
themselves in the War of <HI>Poland,</HI> where the
Emperor had sent 8000 Foot and 2000 Horse
to join the <HI>Polish</HI> Army against the King, and
had thereby given some Check to his Arms in
that War.</P>
<P>In Pursuance therefore of his Resolution to
quarrel with the Emperor, but more particu∣larly
at the Instance of the Princes above-named,
his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty had landed the Year before
at <HI>Straelsund</HI> with about 12000 Men, and having
joined with some Forces which he had left in <HI>Po∣lish
Prussia,</HI> all which did not make 30000 Men,
he began a War with the Emperor, the great∣est
in Event, filled with the most famous Bat∣tels,
Sieges and extraordinary Actions, including
its wonderful Success and happy Conclusion, of
any War ever maintained in the World.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> had already taken <HI>Stetin, Strael∣sund,
Rostock, Wismar,</HI> and all the strong Places on
the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and began to spread himself in <HI>Germa∣ny;</HI>
he had made a League with the <HI>French,</HI> as
I observed in my Story of <HI>Saxony,</HI> he had now
made a Treaty with the Duke of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> and,
in short, began to be terrible to the Empire.</P>
<P>In this Conjuncture the Emperor called the
General Diet of the Empire to be held at <HI>Ra∣tisbon,</HI>
where, as was pretended, all Sides were
to treat of Peace and to join Forces to beat the
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
<HI>Swedes</HI> out of the Empire. Here the Emperor, by
a most exquisite Management, brought the
Affairs of the Diet to a Conclusion, exceedingly
to his own Advantage and to the farther Op∣pression
of the Protestants; and in particular, in
that the War against the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was to
be carried on in such Manner as that the whole
Burthen and Charge would lie on the Protestants
themselves, and they be made the Instruments
to oppose their best Friends. Other Matters
also ended equally to their Disadvantage, as the
Methods resolved on to recover the Church-Lands,
and ro prevent the Education of the Pro∣testant
Clergy; and what remained was referred
to another General Diet to be held at <HI>Frankfort
au Main,</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1631.</P>
<P>I won't pretend to say the other Protestant
Princes of <HI>Germany</HI> had never made any Overtures
to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to come to their Assistance,
but 'tis plain they had entred into no League
with him; that appears from the Difficulties
which retarded the fixing the Treaties after∣ward,
both with the Dukes of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and
<HI>Saxony</HI> which unhappily occasioned the Ruine
of <HI>Magdenburgh.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis Plain the <HI>Swede</HI> was resolved on a War
with the Emperor; his <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty might and
indeed could not but foresee that if he once
shewed himself with a sufficient Force on the
Frontiers of the Empire, all the Protestant
Princes would be obliged by their Interest or by
his Arms to fall in with him, and this the Conse∣quence
made appear to be a just Conclusion; for
the Electors of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> and <HI>Saxony</HI> were both
forced to join with him.</P>
<P>First, They were willing to join with him,
at least they could not find in their Hearts to
<PB N="39" REF="45"/>
join with the Emperor, of whose Power they
had such just Apprehensions; they wished the
<HI>Swedes</HI> Success, and would have been very glad
to have had the Work done at another Man's
Charge; but like true <HI>Germans</HI> they were more wil∣ling
to be saved than to save themselves, and there∣fore
hung back and stood upon Terms.</P>
<P>Secondly, They were at last forced to it; the
first was forced to join by the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> him∣self,
who being come so far was not to be dallied
with; and had not the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> com∣plied
as he did, he had been ruined by the <HI>Swede;</HI>
the <HI>Saxon</HI> was driven into the Arms of the
<HI>Swede</HI> by Force, for Count <HI>Tilly</HI> Ravaging his
Country made him comply with any Terms to
be saved from Destruction.</P>
<P>Thus Matters stood at the End of the Diet at
<HI>Ratisbon;</HI> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> began to see himself
leagued against at the Diet both by Protestant
and Papist; and, as <HI>I have often heard his Maiesty say
since,</HI> he had resolved to try to force them off
from the Emperor, and to treat them as Enemies
equally with the Rest if they did not.</P>
<P>But the Protestants convinced him soon after,
that tho' they were tricked into the outward Ap∣pearance
of a League against him at <HI>Ratisbon,</HI> they
had no such Intentions; and by their Ambassadors
to him let him know, that they only wanted his
powerful Assistance to defend their Councils,
when they would soon convince him that they
had a due Sense of the Emperor's Designs, and
would do their utmost for their Liberty; and
these I take to be the first Invitations the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had to undertake the Protestant Cause
as such, and which entitled him to say he fought
for the Liberty and Religion of the <HI>German</HI>
Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="46"/>
I have had some particular Opportunities to hear
these Things from the Mouths of some of the
very Princes themselves, and therefore am the
forwarder to relate them; and I place them here,
because previous to the part I acted on this
bloody Scene, 'tis necessary to let the Reader
into some Part of the Story, and to shew him in
what Manner and on what Occasions this terrible
War began.</P>
<P>The Protestants, alarmed at the Usage they
had met with at the former Diet, had secretly
proposed among themselves to form a general
Union or Confederacy, for preventing that Ruin
which they saw, unless some speedy Remedies
were applied, would be inevitable. The Elector
of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the Head of the Protestants, a vigo∣rous
and politick Prince, was the first that
moved it; and the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse,</HI> a zea∣lous
and gallant Prince, being consulted with,
it rested a great while between those two, no
Method being found practicable to bring it to
pass; the Emperor being so powerful in all
Parts, that they foresaw the petty Princes would
not dare to negotiate an Affair of such a Nature,
being surrounded with the <HI>Imperial</HI> Forces, who
by their two Generals, <HI>Wallestein</HI> and <HI>Tilly,</HI> kept
them in continual Subjection and Terror.</P>
<P>This Dilemma had like to have stifled the
Thoughts of the Union as a Thing impracticable,
when one <HI>Seigenfius,</HI> a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Minister, a Person
of great Abilities, and one whom the Elector
of <HI>Saxony</HI> made great Use of in Matters of Po∣licy
as well as Religion, contrived for them this
excellent Expedient.</P>
<P><HI>I had the Honour to be acquainted with this
Gentleman while I was at</HI> Leipsick; <HI>it pleased
him exceedingly to have been the Contriver
<PB N="41" REF="47"/>
of so fine a Structure as the</HI> Conclusions of Leip∣sick,
<HI>and he was glad to be entertained on that
Subject; I had the Relation from his own Mouth,
when, but very modestly, he told me he thought
'twas an Inspiration darted on a sudden into his
Thoughts, when the Duke of</HI> Saxony <HI>calling him in∣to
his Closet one Morning, with a Face full of Con∣cern,
shaking his Head and looking very earnestly,</HI>
What will become of us, Doctor? <HI>said the Duke,</HI> we
shall all be undone at <HI>Frankfort au Main.</HI> Why so,
please your Highness? <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> Why they
will fight with the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with our Armies
and our Money, <HI>says the Duke,</HI> and devour our
Friends and our selves, by the help of our Friends and
our selves: But what is become of the Confederacy then,
<HI>said the Doctor,</HI> which your Highness had so happily
framed in your Thoughts, and which the Landgrave of
<HI>Hesse</HI> was so pleased with? Become of it, <HI>says the
Duke,</HI> 'tis a good Thought enough but 'tis impossible
to bring it to pass among so many Members of the
Protestant Princes as are to be consulted with, for we
neither have Time to treat, nor will half of them dare
to negotiate the Matter, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> being quar∣ter'd
in their very Bowels. But may not some Expedient
be found out, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> to bring them all to∣gether
to treat of it in a General Meeting? 'Tis well
proposed, <HI>says the Duke,</HI> but in what Town or City
shall they assemble where the very Deputies shall not be
besieged by <HI>Tilly</HI> or <HI>Wallestein</HI> in 14 Days Time, and
sacrificed to the Cruelty and Fury of the Emperor <HI>Ferdi∣nand?</HI>
Will your Highness be the easier in it, replies
the Doctor, if a way may be found out to call such an
Assembly upon other Causes, at which the Emperor may
have no Ʋmbrage, and perhaps give his Assent? You know
the Diet at <HI>Frankfort</HI> is at Hand; 'tis necessary the
Protestants should have an Assembly of their own, to
prepare Matters for the General Diet, and it may be
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
no <HI>Difficult</HI> Matter to obtain it. <HI>The Duke, surpri∣zed
with Joy at the Motion, embraced the Do∣ctor
with an extraordinary Transport,</HI> Thou hast
done it, Doctor, <HI>said he, and immediately caused
him to draw a Form of a Letter to the Empe∣ror,
which he did with the utmost Dexterity
of Style, in which he was a great Master, re∣presenting
to his</HI> Imperial <HI>Majesty, that in or∣der
to put an End to the Troubles of</HI> Germany,
<HI>his Majesty would be pleased to permit the Pro∣testant
Princes of the Empire to hold a Diet to
themselves, to consider of such Matters as they
were to treat of at the General Diet, in order to
conform themselves to the Will and Pleasure
of his</HI> Imperial. <HI>Majesty, to drive out Foreigners,
and settle a lasting Peace in the Empire; he also
insinuated something of their Resolutions unani∣mously
to give their Suffrages in favour of the
King of</HI> Hungary <HI>at the Election of a King of
the</HI> Romans, <HI>a thing which he knew the Emperor
had in his Thought, and would push at with all
his Might at the Diet. This Letter was sent,
and the Bait so neatly concealed, that the Electors
of</HI> Bavaria <HI>and</HI> Mentz, <HI>the King of</HI> Hungary, <HI>and
several of the Popish Princes, not foreseeing that
the Ruin of them all lay in the bottom of it,
foolishly advised the Emperor to consent to it.</HI></P>
<P>In consenting to this the Emperor signed his
own Destruction, for here began the Conjunction
of the <HI>German</HI> Protestants with the <HI>Swede,</HI> which
was the fatalest blow to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> and which he
could never recover.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Diet was held at <HI>Leipsick, Feb.</HI>
8, 1630, where the Protestants agreed on several
Heads for their mutual Defence, which were
the Grounds of the following War; these were
<HI>the Famous Conclusions of Leipsick,</HI> which so alarmed
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
the Emperor and the whole Empire, that to
crush it in the Beginning, the Emperor commanded
Count <HI>Tilly</HI> immediately to fall upon the Landgrave
of <HI>Hesse,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> as the principal
Heads of the Union; but it was too late.</P>
<P>The Conclusions were digested into ten Heads;</P>
<P>1. That since their Sins had brought God's
Judgments upon the whole Protestant Church,
they should command Publick Prayers to be made
to Almighty God for the diverting the Calami∣ties
that attended them.</P>
<P>2. That a Treaty of Peace might be set on
Foot, in order to come to a right Understanding
with the Catholick Princes.</P>
<P>3. That a Time for such a Treaty being ob∣tained,
they should appoint an Assembly of De∣legates
to meet preparatory to the Treaty.</P>
<P>4. That all their Complaints should be humbly
represented to his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, and the Ca∣tholick
Electors, in order to a peaceable Accom∣modation.</P>
<P>5. That they claim the Protection of the Em∣peror,
according to the Laws of the Empire,
and the present Emperor's solemn Oath and
Promise.</P>
<P>6. That they would appoint Deputies who
should meet at certain Times to consullt of their
common Interest, and who should be always em∣poured
to conclude of what should be thought
needful for their Safety.</P>
<P>7. That they will raise a competent Force
to maintain and defend their Liberties, Rights and
Religion.</P>
<P>8. That it is agreeable to the Constitution of
the Empire, concluded in the Diet at <HI>Ausburg</HI> to
do so.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="50"/>
9. That the arming for their necessary De∣fence
shall by no Means hinder their Obedience
to his <HI>Imperial</HI> Majesty, but that they will still
continue their Loyalty to him.</P>
<P>10. They agree to Proportion their Forces,
which in all amounted to 70000 Men.</P>
<P>The Emperor, exceedingly startled at the
Conclusions, issued out a severe Proclamation or
Ban against them, which imported much the
same Thing as a Declaration of War, and com∣manded
<HI>Tilly</HI> to begin, and immediately to fall on
the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> with all the Fury imaginable,
as I have already observed.</P>
<P>Here began the Flame to break out for upon
the Emperor's Ban, the Protestants send away to
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> for Succour.</P>
<P>His <HI>Swedish</HI> Majesty had already conquered
<HI>Macklenburgh,</HI> and Part of <HI>Pomerania,</HI> and was ad∣vancing
with his victorious Troops, encreased by
the Addition of some Regiments raised in those
Parts, in order to carry on the War against the
Emperor, having designed to follow up the <HI>Oder</HI>
into <HI>Silesia,</HI> and so to push the War home to
the Emperor's Hereditary Countries of <HI>Austria</HI>
and <HI>Bohemia,</HI> when the first Messengers came to
him in this Case; but this changed his Measures,
and brought him to the Frontiers of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI>
resolved to answer the Desires of the Protestants:
But here the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> began to halt, ma∣king
some Difficulties and demanding Terms which
drove the King to use some Extremities with him,
and stopt the <HI>Swedes</HI> for a while, who had other∣wise
been on the Banks of the <HI>Elbe</HI> as soon as
<HI>Tilly</HI> the <HI>Imperial</HI> General had entred <HI>Saxony,</HI>
which if they had done, the miserable Destru∣ction
of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> had been prevented, as I
observed before.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="51"/>
The King had been invited into the Union, and
when he first came back from the Banks of the
<HI>Oder</HI> he had accepted it, and was preparing to
back it with all his Power.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had already a good Ar∣my,
which he had with infinite Diligence re∣cruited,
and mustered them under the Cannon
of <HI>Leipsick.</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> having, by his
Ambalsador at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> entred into the Union of
the Protestants, was advancing victoriously to
their Aid, just as Count <HI>Tilly</HI> had enter'd the Duke
of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Dominions. The Fame of the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
Conquests, and of the Hero who command∣ed
them, shook my Resolution of travelling in∣to
<HI>Turkey,</HI> being resolved to see the Conjunction
of the Protestants Armies, and before the Fire
was broke out too far to take the Advantage of
feeing both sides.</P>
<P>While I remained at <HI>Vienna,</HI> uncertain which
Way I should proceed; I remember I observed
they talked of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> as a Prince
of no Consideration, one that they might let go
on and tire himself in <HI>Mecklenbergh,</HI> and there∣about,
till they could find Leisure to deal with
him, and then might be crushed as they pleased,
but as 'tis never safe to despise an Enemy, so this
was not an Enemy to be <HI>despised,</HI> as they after∣wards
found.</P>
<P>As to the Conclusions of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> indeed at
first they gave the <HI>Imperial</HI> Court some Uneasi∣ness,
but when they found the <HI>Imperial</HI> Armies
began to fright the Members out of the Union,
and that the several Branches had no considerable
Forces on Foot, it was the general Discourse at
<HI>Vienna,</HI> that the Union at <HI>Leipsick</HI> only gave the
Emperor an Opportunity to crush absolutely
the Dukes of <HI>Saxony, Brandenburgh,</HI> and the Land∣grave
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
of <HI>Hesse;</HI> and they looked upon it as a
Thing certain.</P>
<P>I never saw any real Concern in their Faces at
<HI>Vienna,</HI> 'till News came to Court that the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> had entered into the Union; but as
this made them very uneasie, they began to move
the powerfullest Methods possible to divert this
Storm; and upon this News <HI>Tilly</HI> was hastened
to fall into <HI>Saxony</HI> before this Union could pro∣ceed
to a Conjunction of Forces. This was certain∣ly
a very good Resolution, and no Measure could
have been more exactly concerted had not the Di∣ligence
of the <HI>Saxons</HI> prevented it.</P>
<P>The gathering of this Storm, which from a
Cloud began to spread over the Empire, and from
the little Dutchyof <HI>Mecklenburgh</HI> began to threaten
all <HI>Germany,</HI> absolutely determined me, as I noted
before, as to travelling; and laying aside the
Thoughts of <HI>Hungary,</HI> I resolved, if possible, to
see the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Army.</P>
<P>I parted from <HI>Vienna</HI> the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and
took post for <HI>Great Glogau</HI> in <HI>Silesia,</HI> as if I had
purposed to pass into <HI>Poland,</HI> but designing indeed
to go down the <HI>Oder</HI> to <HI>Custrin</HI> in the Marquisate
of <HI>Brandenburgh;</HI> and so to <HI>Berlin;</HI> but when I came
to the Frontiers of <HI>Silesia,</HI> tho' I had Passes I
could go no farther, the Guards on all the
Frontiers were so strict; so I was obliged to come
back into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> so and went to <HI>Prague.</HI></P>
<P>From hence I found I could easily pass through
the <HI>Imperial</HI> Provinces to the <HI>Lower Saxony,</HI> and
accordingly took Passes for <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> designing
however to use them no farther than I found
Occasion.</P>
<P>By Virtue of these Passes I got into the <HI>Im∣perial</HI>
Army, under Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> then at the Siege
of <HI>Magdenburgh, May</HI> the 2d.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="53"/>
I confess I did not foresee the Fate of this Ci∣ty,
neither I believe did Count <HI>Tilly</HI> himself ex∣pect
to glut his Fury with so entire a Desola∣tion,
much less did the People expect it. I did
believe they must capitulate, and I perceived by
Discourse in the Army, that <HI>Tilly</HI> would give them
but very indifferent Conditions; but it fell out
otherwise; the Treaty of Surrender was as it
were begun, nay some say concluded, when some
of the Out-guards of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> finding the
Citizens had abandoned the Guards of the Works,
and looked to themselves with less Diligence than
usual, they broke in, carried an Half-Moon
Sword in Hand with little Resistance; and tho'
it was a Surprize on both Sides, the Citizens
neither fearing, nor the Army expecting the
Occasion, the Garrison, with as much Resolution
as could be expected under such a Fright, flew
to the Walls, twice beat the <HI>Imperialists</HI> off, but
fresh Men coming up, and the Administrator of
<HI>Magdenburgh</HI> himself being wounded and taken,
the Enemy broke in, took the City by Storm,
and entred with such terrible Fury, that with∣out
Respect to Age or Condition, they put all
the Garrison and Inhabitants, Man, Woman and
Child, to the Sword, plundered the City, and
when they had done this, set it on Fire.</P>
<P>This Calamity sure was the dreadfullest Sight
that ever I saw; the Rage of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Sol∣diers
was most intolerable, and not to be ex∣pressed;
of 25000, some said 30000 People, there
was not a Soul to be seen alive, till the Flames
drove those that were hid in Vaults and secret
Places to seek Death in the Streets, rather than
perish in the Fire: Of these miserable Creatures
some were killed too by the furious Soldiers, but
at last they saved the Lives of such as came out
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
of their Cellars and Holes, and so about 2000
poor desperate Creatures were left: The exact
Number of those that perished in this City could
never be known, because those the Soldiers had
first butcher'd, the Flames afterwards devour'd.</P>
<P>I was on the other Side the <HI>Elbe</HI> when this
dreadful Piece of Butchery was done; the City
of <HI>Magdenburgh</HI> had a Sconce or Fort over against
it, called the Toll-House, which joined to the
City by a very fine Bridge of Boats.</P>
<P>This Fort was taken by the <HI>Imperialists</HI>
a few Days before, and having a Mind to see it,
and the rather because from thence I could have
a very good View of the City, I was gone over
<HI>Tilly</HI>'s Bridge of Boats to view this Fort; about
10 a Clock in the Morning I perceived they were
storming by the firing, and immediately all ran
to the Works, I little thought of the taking the
City, but imagined it might be some Out-work
attacked, for we all expected the City would
surrender that Day, or next, and they might
have capitulated upon very good Terms.</P>
<P>Being upon the Works of the Fort, on a sudden
I heard the dreadfullest Cry raised in the City
that can be imagined, 'tis not possible to express
the Manner of it, and I could see the Women and
Children running about the Streets in a most
lamentable Condition.</P>
<P>The City Wall did not run along the Side
where the River was with so great a Heighth
but we could plainly see the Market-Place and
the several Streets which run down to the River;
In about an Hour's Time after this first Cry all
was Confusion; there was little shooting, the
Execution was all cutting of Throats and meer
House Murthers; the resolute Garrison, with the
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
brave Baron <HI>Falconberg</HI> fought it out to the last,
and were cut in. Pieces, and by this Time the
<HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers having broke open the Gates
and entred on all Sides, the Slaughter was very
dreadful, we could see the poor People in Crowds
driven down the Streets, flying from the Fury
of the Soldiers who followed butchering them
as fast as they could, and refused Mercy to any
Body; 'till driving them to the River's Edge,
the desperate Wretches would throw themselves
into the River, where Thousands of them pe∣rished,
especially Women and Children; several
Men that could swim got over to our Side, where
the Soldiers not heated with Fight gave them
Quarter, and took them up, and I cannot but do
this Justice to the <HI>German</HI> Officers in the Fort, they
had five small flat Boats, and they gave leave to the
Soldiers to go off in them, and get what Booty
they could, but charged them not to kill any
Body, but take them all Prisoners.</P>
<P>Nor was their Humanity ill rewarded, for the
Soldiers wisely avoiding those Places where their
Fellows were employed in the butchering the
miserable People, rowed, to other Places, where
Crouds of People stood crying out for help, and
expecting to be every Minute either drowned
or murdered; of these at sundry Times they
fetched over near Six hundred, but took Care to
take in none but such as offered them good Pay.</P>
<P>Never was Money or Jewels of greater Service
than now, for those that had any Thing of that:
sort to offer were soonest helped.</P>
<P>There was a Burgher of the Town, who seeing
a Boat coming near him, but out of his Call, by
the help of a speaking Trumpet, told the Sol∣diers
in it he would give them 20000 Dollers to
fetch him off; they rowed close to the Shore,
<PB N="50" REF="56"/>
and got him with his Wife and six Children into
the Boat, but such Throngs of People got about
the Boat that had like to have sunk her, so that
the Soldiers were fain to drive a great many
out again by main Force, and while they were
doing this, some of the Enemies coming down
the Street desperately drove them all into the
Water.</P>
<P>The Boat however brought the Burgher and
his Wife and Children safe, and though they had
not all that Wealth about them, yet in jewels
and Money he gave them, so much as made all
the Fellows very rich.</P>
<P>I cannot pretend to describe the Cruelty of
this Day, the Town by five in the Afternoon
was all on a Flame; the Wealth consumed was
inestimable, and a Loss to the very Conqueror.
I think there was little or nothing left but the
great Church, and about 100 Houses.</P>
<P>This was a sad Welcome into the Army for
me, and gave me a Horror and Aversion to the
Emperor's People, as well as to his Cause. I quitted
the Camp the third Day after this Execution,
while the Fire was hardly out in the City; and from
thence getting safe Conduct to pass into the <HI>Palati∣nate,</HI>
I turned out of the Road at a small Village on
the <HI>Elbe,</HI> called <HI>Emerfield,</HI> and by Ways and Town I
can give but small Account of having a Boor for
our Guide, who we could hardly understand.
I arrived at <HI>Leipsick</HI> on the 17th of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>We found the Elector intense upon the strength∣ening
of his Army, but the People, in the great∣est
Terror imaginable, every Day expecting <HI>Tilly</HI>
with the <HI>German</HI> Army, who by his Cruelty at
<HI>Magdeburg</HI> was become so dreadful to the Pro∣testants,
that they expected no Mercy where-ever
he came.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="57"/>
The Emperor's Power was made so formidable
to all the Protestants, particularly since the Diet at
<HI>Ratisbon</HI> left them in a worse Case than it found
them, that they had not only formed the Con∣clusions
of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> which all Men looked on as
the Effect of Desperation rather than any pro∣bable
Means of their Deliverance, but had pri∣vately
implored the Protection and Assistance of
foreign Powers, and particularly the King of <HI>Swe∣den,</HI>
from whom they had Promises of a speedy and
powerful Assistance. And truly if the <HI>Swede</HI> had
not with a very strong Hand rescued them, all
their Conclusions at <HI>Leipsick</HI> had served but to
hasten their Ruin. I remember very well when
I was in the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army they discoursed with
such Contempt of the Forces of the Protestants,
that not only the <HI>Imperialists</HI> but the Protestants
themselves gave them up as lost: the Emperor
had not less than 200000 Men in several Armies
on Foot, who most of them were on the back
of the Protestants in every Corner. If <HI>Tilly</HI> did
but Write a threatning Letter to any City of
Prince of the Union, they presently submittted,
renounced the Conclusions of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and re∣ceived
<HI>Imperial</HI> Garrisons, as the Cities of <HI>Ʋl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
and <HI>Memingen,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> and se∣veral
others, and almost all <HI>Suaben.</HI></P>
<P>Only the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> and the Landgrave of
<HI>Hesse</HI> upheld the drooping Courage of the Pro∣testants,
and refused all Terms of Peace; slight∣ed
all the Threatnings of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Generals,
and the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> was brought in
afterward almost by Force.</P>
<P>The Duke Of <HI>Saxony</HI> mustered his Forces un∣der
the Walls of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and I having returned
to <HI>Leipsick</HI> two Days before, saw them pass the
Review. The Duke, gallantly mounted, rode
<PB N="52" REF="58"/>
through the Ranks, attended by his Field Mar∣shal
<HI>Arnheim,</HI> and seemed mighty well pleased
with them, and indeed the Troops made a very
fine Appearance; but I that had seen <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Ar∣my,
and his old Weather-beaten Soldiers, whose
Discipline and Exercises were so exact, and their
Courage so often tried, could not look on the
<HI>Saxon</HI> Army without some Concern for them,
when I considered who they had to deal with;
<HI>Tilly</HI>'s Men were rugged surly Fellows, their Faces
had an Air of hardy Courage, mangled with
Wounds and Scars, their Armour shewed the
Bruises of Musquet Bullets, and the Rust of the
Winter Storms: I observed of them their Cloaths
were always dirty, but their Arms were clean
and bright; they were used to camp in the
open Fields, and sleep in the Frosts and Rain;
their Horses were strong and hardy like them∣selves,
and well taught their Exercises; the Sol∣diers
knew their Business so exactly that gene∣ral
Orders were enough; every private Man
was fit to command, and their Wheelings, March∣ings,
Countermarchings and Exercises were done
with such Order and Readiness that the distinct
Words of Command were hardly of any use a∣mong
them; they were flushed with Victory, and
hardly knew what it was to fly.</P>
<P>There had passed some Messages between <HI>Tilly</HI>
and the Duke, and he gave always such ambi∣guous
Answers as he thought might serve to
gain Time; but <HI>Tilly</HI> was not to be put off with
Words, and drawing his Army towards <HI>Saxony,</HI>
sends four Propositions to him to sign, and de∣mands
an immediate Reply, the Propositions were
positive.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="59"/>
1. To cause his Troops to enter into the Em∣peror's
Service, and to march in Person with
them against the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>2. To give the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army Quarters in his
Country, and supply them, with necessary Pro∣visions.</P>
<P>3. To relinquish the Union of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and dif∣own
the 10 Conclusions.</P>
<P>4. To make Restitution of the Goods and
Lands of the Church.</P>
<P>The Duke being pressed hy <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Trumpeter
for an immediate Answer, sat all Night, and
part of the next Day in Council with his Privy
Councillors, debating what Reply to give him,
which, at last was concluded, in short, that he
would live and die in Defence of the Protestant
Religion, and the Conclusions of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and bad
<HI>Tilly</HI> Defiance.</P>
<P>The Dye being thus cast, he immediate∣ly
decamped with his whole Army for <HI>Tor∣gau,</HI>
fearing that <HI>Tilly</HI> should get there before
him, and so prevent his Conjunction with the
<HI>Swede.</HI> The Duke had not yet concluded any
positive Treaty with the King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and
the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> having made some Dif∣ficulty
of joining, they both stood on somee Nice∣ties
till they had like to have ruined themselves
all at once.</P>
<P><HI>Brandenburgh</HI> had given up the Town of <HI>Spandau</HI>
to the King by a former Treaty to secure a Re∣treat
for his Army, and the King was advanced
as far as <HI>Francfort</HI> upon the <HI>Oder,</HI> when on a sudden
some small Difficulties arising <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> seems
cold in the Matter, and with a sort of Indifference
demands to have his Town of <HI>Spandau</HI> restored to
him again. <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> who began presently
to imagine thp Duke had made his Peace with the
<PB N="54" REF="60"/>
Emperor, and so would either be his Enemy, or
pretend a Neutrality, generously delivered him
hisTown of <HI>Spandau;</HI> but immediately turns about,
and with his whole Army besieges him in his Capi∣tal
City of <HI>Berlin.</HI> This brought the Duke to know
his Error, and by the Interposition of the Ladies,
the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> being the Duke's Sister, the
Matter was accommodated, and the Duke joined
his Forces with the King.</P>
<P>But the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had like to have been
undone by this Delay, for the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> under
Count <HI>de Furstemburgh,</HI> were entred his Country, and
had possessed themselves of <HI>Hall,</HI> and <HI>Tilly</HI> was on
his March to join him, as he afterwards did, and
ravaging the whole Country laid Siege to <HI>Leip∣sick</HI>
it self; the Duke driven to this Extremity
rather flies to the <HI>Swede</HI> than treats with him, and
on the second of <HI>September</HI> the Duke's Army joined
with the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I had not come to <HI>Leipsick</HI> but to see the Duke
of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Army, and that being marched as I
have said, for <HI>Torgau</HI> I had no Business there:
but if I had, the approach of <HI>Tilly</HI> and the <HI>Im∣perial</HI>
Army was enough to hasten me away,
for I had no Occasion to be besieged there;
so on the 27th of <HI>August</HI> I left the Town, as several
of the principal Inhabitants had done before,
and more would have done had not the Governor
published a Proclamation against it; and besides
they knew not whether to fly, for all Places
were alike exposed, the poor People were under
dreadful Apprehensions of a Siege, and of the
merciless Usage of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers, the
Example of <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> being fresh before them,
the Duke and his Army gone from them, and
the Town, though well-furnished, but indifferent∣ly
fortified.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="61"/>
In this Condition I left them, buying up Stores
of Provisions, working hard to scour their Moats,
set up Palisadoes, repair their Fortifications, and
preparing all Things for a Siege and following the
<HI>Saxon</HI> Army to <HI>Torgau,</HI> I continued in the Camp till
a few Days before they joined the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>I had much ado to persuade my Companion
from entring into the Service of the Duke of
<HI>Saxony,</HI> one of whose Collonels, with whom we
had contracted a particular Acquaintance, offering
him a Commission to be Cornet in one of the old
Regiments of Horse; but the Difference I had
observed between this new Army and <HI>Tilly</HI>'s old
Troops had made such an Impression on me, that
I confess I had yet no manner of Inclination for
the Service; and therefore persuaded him to
wait a while till we had seen a little further into
Affairs, and particularly till we had seen the
<HI>Swedish</HI> Army, which we had heard so much of.</P>
<P>The Difficulties which the Elector Duke of
<HI>Saxony</HI> made of joining with the King were made
up by a Treaty concluded with the King on the
2d of <HI>September</HI> at <HI>Coswig,</HI> a small Town on the <HI>Elbe,</HI>
whither the King's Army was arrived the Night
before; for General <HI>Tilly</HI> being now entered
into the Duke's Country, had plundered and
ruined all the lower part of it, and was now
actually besieging the Capital City of <HI>Leipsick.</HI>
These Necessities made almost any Conditions
easy to him, the greatest Difficulty was that
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> demanded the absolute Com∣mand
of the Army, which the Duke submitted
to with less good Will than he had Reason to do,
the King's Experience and Conduct considered.</P>
<P>I had not Patience to attend the Conclusions
of their particular Treaties, but as soon as ever
the Passage was clear I quitted the <HI>Saxon</HI> Camp,
<PB N="56" REF="62"/>
and went to see the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army; I fell in with
the Our-guards of the <HI>Swedes</HI> at a little Town
called <HI>Beltsig,</HI> on the River <HI>Wersa,</HI> just as they
were relieving the Guards, and going to march,
and having a Pass from the <HI>English</HI> Ambassador
was very well received by the Officer who
changed the Guards, and with him I went back
into the Army; by nine in the Morning the Army
was in full March, the King himself at the Head
of them on a gray Pad, and riding from one
Brigade to another, ordered the March of every
Line himself.</P>
<P>When I saw the <HI>Swedish</HI> Troops, their exact
Discipline, their Order, the Modesty and Fami∣liarity
of their Officers, and the regular living of
the Soldiers, their Camp seemed a well ordered
City; the meanest Country Woman with her
<HI>Market Ware</HI> was as safe from Violence as in the
Streets of <HI>Vienna:</HI> There was no Regiments of
Whores and Rags as followed the <HI>Imperialists;</HI> nor
any Women in the Camp, but such as being known
to the Provosts to be the Wives of the Soldiers,
who were necessary for washing Linen, taking
Care of the Soldiers Cloaths, and dressing their
Victuals.</P>
<P>The Soldiers were well clad, not gay, furnished
with excellent Arms, and exceeding careful of
them; and though they did not seem so terrible
as I thought <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Men did when I first saw
them, yet the Figure they made, together with
what we had heard of them, made them seem
to me invincible: The Discipline and Order of
their Marchings, Camping and Exercise was
excellent and singular, and which was to be seen
in no Armies but the King's, his own Skill,
Judgment and Vigilance having added much to
the general Conduct of Armies then in use.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="63"/>
As I met the <HI>Swedes</HI> on their March I had no
Opportunity to acquaint my self with any Body
'till after the Conjunction of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army,
and then it being but four Days to the great
Battle of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> our Acquaintance was but
small, saving what fell out accidentally by Con∣versation.</P>
<P>I met with several Gentlemen in the King's
Army who spoke <HI>English</HI> very well, besides that
there were 3 Regiments of <HI>Scots</HI> in the Army,
the Collonels whereof I found were extraordi∣narily
esteemed by the King, as the Lord <HI>Rea,</HI>
Collonel <HI>Lumsdell,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Hepburn:</HI> The
latter of these, after I had by an Accident become
Acquainted with, I found had been for many
Years acquainted with my Father, and on that
Account I received a great deal of Civility from
him, which afterwards grew into a kind of
intimate Friendship; he was a compleat Soldier
indeed, and for that Reason so well beloved by
that gal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant King, that he hardly knew how to go
about any great Action without him.</P>
<P>It was impossible for me now to restrain my
young Comrade from entring into the <HI>Swedish</HI>
Service, and indeed every Thing was so invi∣ting
that I could not blame him. A Captain in
Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI>'s Regiment had picked Acquain∣tance
with him, and he having as much Gallan∣try
in his Face as real Courage in his Heart,
the Captain had persuaded him to take Service,
and promised to use his Interest to get him a
Company in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Brigade. I had made him
promise me not to part from me in my Tra∣vels
without my Consent, which was the only
Obstacle to his Desires of entring in the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI>
Pay; and being one Evening in the Cap∣tain's
Tent with, him, and discoursing very free∣ly
<PB N="58" REF="64"/>
together, the Captain asked him very short
tout friendly, and looking earnestly at me, <HI>Is
this the Gentleman, Mr.</HI> Fielding, <HI>that has done so
much Prejudice to the King of</HI> Sweden'<HI>s Service?</HI> I
was doubly surprized at the Expression, and
at the Collonel, Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> coming at
that very Moment into the Tent; the Collonel
hearing something of the Question, but know∣ing
nothing of the Reason of it, any more than as
I seemed a little to concern my self at it; yet
after the Ceremony due to his Character was
over, would needs know what I had done to
hinder his Majesty's Service. <HI>So much truly, says
the Captain, that if his Majesty knew it he would
think himself very little beholding to him. I am sorry,</HI>
Sir, says I, <HI>that I should offend in any Thing, who am
but a Stranger; but if you would please to inform me,
I wound endeavour to alter any Thing in my Behaviour
that is prejudicial to any one, much less to his Majesly's
Service. I shall take you at your Word, Sir,</HI> says the
Captain; <HI>the King of</HI> Sweden, <HI>Sir, has a particular
Request to you. I should be glad to know two Things,</HI>
Sir, said I, <HI>First, How that can be possible, since I am
not known yet to any Man in the Army, much less to
his Majesty? And, Secondly, What the Request can be?
Why, Sir, his Majesty desires you would not hinder this
Gentleman from entring into his Service, who it seems de∣sires
nothing more, if he may have your Consent to it. I have
too much Honour for his Majesty,</HI> return'd I, <HI>to deny any
Thing which he pleases to command me; but methinks 'tis
some Hardship, you should make that the King's Order,
which 'tis very probable he knows nothing of.</HI> Sir <HI>John
Heppburn</HI> took the Case up something gravely, and
drinking a Glass of <HI>Lipsick</HI> Beer to the Captain,
said, <HI>Come, Captain, don't press these Gentlemen; the
King desires no Man's Service but what is purely Vo∣luntier.</HI>
So we entred into other Discourse, and
<PB N="59" REF="65"/>
the Collonel perceiving by my Talk that I had
seen <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army, was mighty curious in his
Questions, and seemed very well satisfied with
the Account I gave him.</P>
<P>The next Day the Army having pass'd the <HI>Elbe</HI>
at <HI>Wittemberg,</HI> and joyn'd the <HI>Saxon</HI> Army near
<HI>Torgau</HI> his Majesty caused both Armies to draw
up in Battalia, giving every Brigade the same Post
in the Lines as he purposed to fight in: I must do
the Memory of that glorious General this Ho∣nour,
that I never saw an Army drawn up with so
much Variety, Order, and exact Regularity since,
tho' I have seen many Armies drawn up by some
of the greatest Captains of the Age; the Order
by which his Men were directed to flank and re∣lieve-one
another, the Methods of receiving one
Body of Men if disordered into another, and ral∣lying
one Squadron, without disordering ano∣ther
was so admirable; the Horse every where
flank'd, lin'd and defended by the Foot, and the
Foot by the Horse, and both by the Cannon, was
such, that if those Orders were but as punctually
obey'd, 'twere impossible to put an Army so
modell'd into any Confusion.</P>
<P>The View being over, and the Troops return'd
to their Camps, the Captain with whom we
drank the Day before meeting me, told me I must
come and sup with him in his Tent, where he
would ask my Pardon for the Affront he gave me
before. I told him he needed not put himlelf to
the Trouble; I was not affronted at all, that I
would do my self the Honour to wait on him,
provided he wou'd give me his Word not to speak
any more of it as an Affront.</P>
<P>We lad not been a quarter of an Hour in his
Tent but Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> came in again, and ad∣dressing
to me, told me he was glad to find me
there; that he came to the Captain's Tent to en∣quire
<PB N="60" REF="66"/>
how to send to me; and that I must do him
the Honour to go with him to wait on the King,
who had a Mind to hear the Account I could give
him of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army from my own Mouth.
I must confess I was at some Loss in my Mind how
to make my Address to his Majesty but I had
heard so much of the conversible Temper of the
King, and his particular Sweetness of Humour
with the meanest Soldier, that I made no more
Difficulty, but having paid my Respects to Collo∣nel
<HI>Hepburn,</HI> thank'd him for the Honour he had
done me, and offered to rise and wait upon him:
Nay, says the Collonel, we will eat first, for I find
<HI>Gourdon,</HI> which was the Captain's Name, has
got something for Supper, and the King's Order
is at seven a Clock: So we went to Supper, and
Sir <HI>John</HI> becoming very friendly, must know my
Name; which, when I had told him, and of what
Place and Family, he rose from his Seat and em∣bracing
me, told me he knew my Father very
well, and had been intimately acquainted with
him; and told me several Passages wherein my
Father had particularly obliged him. After this
we went to Supper, and the King's Health being
drank round, the Collonel moved the sooner be∣cause
he had a Mind to talk with me; when we
were going to the King, he enquired of me where
I had been, and what Occasion brought me to the
Army. I told him the short History of my Tra∣vels,
and that I came hither from <HI>Vienna</HI> on pur∣pose
to see the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> and his Army;
he ask'd me if there was any Service he could do
me, by which he meant, whether I desired an Em∣ploy
ment; I pretended not to take him so, but
told him the Protection his Acquaintance would
afford me was more than I could have ask'd, since
I might thereby have Opportunity to satisfie my
<PB N="61" REF="67"/>
Curiosity, which was the chief End of my coming
abroad. He perceiving by this that I had no
Mind to be a Soldier, told me very kindly I
should command him in any thing; that his Tent
and Equipage, Horses and Servants should always
have Orders to be at my Service: But that as a Piece
of Friendship, he would advise me to retire to
some Place distant from the Army, for that the
Army wou'd march to morrow, and the King was
resolved to fight General <HI>Tilly,</HI> and he wou'd not
have me hazard my self: that if I thought fit to
take his Advice, he wou'd have me take that In∣terval
to see the Court at <HI>Berlin,</HI> whither he
would send one of his Servants to wait on me:
His Discourse was too kind not to extort the
tenderest Acknowledgment from me that I was
capable of; I told him his Care of me was so o∣bliging,
that I knew not what Return to make
him, but if he pleased to leave me to my Choice
I desired no greater Favour than to trail a Pike
under his Command in the ensuing Battle. I
can never answer it to your Father, says he, to
suffer you to expose your self so far. I told him
my Father would certainly acknowledge his
Friendship in the Proposal made me; but I be∣liev'd
he knew him better than to think he wou'd
be well pleas'd with me if I should accept of it;
that I was sure my Father would have rod Post 500
Miles to have been at such a Battle under such a
General, and it should never be told him that his
Son had rod 50 Miles to be out of it: He seem'd
to be something concern'd at the Resolution I had
taken, and replied very quickly upon me, that
he approved very well of my Courage; but, says
he, no Man gets any Credit by running upon
needless Adventures, nor loses any by shunning
Hazards which he has no Order for. 'Tis enough,
<PB N="62" REF="68"/>
says he, for a Gentleman to behave well when he
is commanded, upon any Service; I have had fight∣ing
enough, says he, upon these Points of Honour,
and I never got any thing but Reproof for it from
the King himself. Well, Sir, said I, however if a
Man expects to rise by his Valour, he must shew
it somewhere; and if I were to have any Com∣mand
in an Army, I wou'd first try whether I
could deserve it: I have never yet seen any Ser∣vice,
and must have my Induction some time or
other: I shall never have a better Schoolmaster
than your self, nor a better School than such an
Army. Well, says Sir <HI>John,</HI> but you may have the
same School and the same teaching after this Bat∣tle
is over; for I must tell you before-hand, this
will be a bloody Touch; <HI>Tilly</HI> has a great Army
of old Lads that are used to boxing Fellows with
Iron Faces, and 'tis a little too much to engage so
hotly the first Entrance into the Wars; You may
see our Discipline this Winter, and make your
Campaign with us next Summer, when you need
not fear but we shall have fighting enough, and you
will be better acquainted with Things: We do
never put our common Soldiers upon Pitcht Bat∣tles
the first Campaign, but place our new Men in
Garrisons and try them in Parties first. Sir, said
I with a little more Freedom, I believe I shall not
make a Trade of the War, and therefore need
not serve an Apprenticeship to it: 'Tis a hard Battle
where none escapes: If I come off, I hope I shall
not disgrace you, and if not, 'twill be some Sa∣tisfaction
to my Father to hear his Son died fight∣ing,
under the Command of Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> in the
Army of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and I desire no bet∣ter
Epitaph upon my Tomb. Well, says Sir
<HI>John,</HI> and by this time we were just come to the
King's Quarters, and the Guards calling to us in∣terrupted
<PB N="63" REF="69"/>
his Reply; so we went into the Court
Yard where the King was lodg'd, which
was in an indifferent House of one of the Burgh∣ers
of <HI>Debien,</HI> and Sir <HI>John</HI> stepping up, met the
King coming down some Steps into a large Room
which looked over the Town-Wall into a Field
where Part of the Artillery was drawn up. Sir
<HI>John Hepburn</HI> sent his Man presently to me to come
up, which I did; and Sir <HI>John</HI> without any Cere∣mony
carries me directly up to the King, who
was leaning on his Elbow in the Window: The
King turning about, this is the <HI>English</HI> Gentle∣man,
says Sir <HI>John</HI> who I told your Majesty had
been in the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army. How then did he get
hither, says the King, without being taken by the
Scouts? At which Question Sir <HI>John</HI> saying nothing;
By a Pass, and please your Majesty, from the <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Ambassador's Secretary at <HI>Vienna,</HI> said I,
making a profound Reverence. Have you then
been at <HI>Vienna,</HI> says the King? Yes, and please
your Majesty, said I: upon which the King fold∣ing
up a Letter he had in his Hand, seemed much
more earnest to talk about <HI>Vienna,</HI> than about <HI>Til∣ly:</HI>
And pray what News had you at <HI>Vienna?</HI> No∣thing,
Sir, said I, but daily Accounts one in the
Neck of another of their own Misfortunes, and your
Majesty's Conquests, which makes a very melan∣choly
Court there. But pray, said the King, what is
the common Opinion there about these Affairs?
The common People are terrified to the last Degree,
said I, and when your Majesty took <HI>Frankfort</HI> up∣on
<HI>Oder,</HI> if your Army had march'd but 20
Miles into <HI>silesia,</HI> half the People wou'd have run
out of <HI>Vienna,</HI> and I left them fortifying the City.
They need not, reply'd the King smiling, I have
no Design to trouble them, 'tis the Protestant
Countries I must be for: Upon this the Duke
<PB N="64" REF="70"/>
of <HI>Saxony</HI> entred the Room, and finding the King
engaged, offer'd to retire; but the King beckon∣ing
with his Hand call'd to him in <HI>French,</HI> Cousin,
says the King, this Gentleman has been travel∣ling
and comes from <HI>Vienna,</HI> and so made me re∣peat
what I had said before; at which the King
went on with me, and Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> inform∣ing
his Majesty that I spoke high <HI>Dutch,</HI> he
changed his Language, and ask'd me in <HI>Dutch</HI>
where it was that I saw General <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army; I
told his Majesty at the Siege of <HI>Magdeburgh.</HI> At
<HI>Madeburgh;</HI> said the King shaking his Head;
<HI>Tilly</HI> must answer to me one Day for that <HI>City,</HI>
and if not to me to a greater King than I: Can
you guess what Army he had with him, said the
King? He had two Armies with him, said I, but
one I suppose will do your Majesty no harm: Two
Armies! said the King. Yes Sir, he has one Army
or about 26000 Men, said I, and another of above
15000 Whores and their Attendants; at which
the King laughed heartily; Ay, ay, says the
King, those 15000 do us as much Harm as the
26000; for they eat up the Country, and de∣vour
the poor Protestants more than the Men:
Well, says the King, do they talk of fighting us?
They talk big enough, Sir, said I, but your Majesty
has not been so often fought with as beaten in
their Discourse. I know not for the Men, says
the King, but the old Man is as likely to do it as
talk of it, and I hope to try them in a Day or
two: The King enquired after that, several Mat∣rers
of me about the <HI>Law Countries,</HI> the Prince of
<HI>Orange,</HI> and of the Court and Affairs in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
and Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> informing his Majesty
that I was the Son of an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman of his
Acquaintance, the King had the Goodness to ask
him what Care he had taken of Me against the
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
Day of Battle. Upon which Sir <HI>John</HI> repeated
to him the Discourse we had together by the
Way; the King seeming particularly pleased with
it, began to take me to Task himself: You <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Gentlemen, says he, are too forward in the
Wars, which makes you leave them too soon again.
Your Majesty, reply'd I, makes War in so plea∣sant
a Manner, as makes all the World fond
of fighting under your Conduct. Not so pleasant
neither, says the King, here's a Man can tell you
that sometimes 'tis not very pleasant. I know not
much of the Warrior, Sir, said I, nor of the
World, but if always to conquer be the pleasure of
the War, your Majesty's Soldiers have all that
can be desired. Well, says the King, but however
considering all Things, I think you would do well
to take the Advice Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> has given you.
Your Majesty may command me to any Thing,
but where your Majesty and so many gallant Gen∣tleman
hazard their Lives, mine is not worth
mentioning; and I should not dare to tell my Fa∣ther
at my return into <HI>England</HI> that I was in your
Majesty's Army, and made so mean a Figure
that your Majesty's would not permit me to fight
under that Royal Standard. Nay, replied the King,
I say no Commands upon you, but you are young.
I can never dye, Sir, said I, with more Honour than
in your Majesty's Service; I spake this with so
much Freedom, and his Majesty was so pleased
with it, that he asked me how I would choose to
serve, on Horseback or on Foot; I told his Ma∣jesty
I should be glad to receive any of his Ma∣jesty's
Commands, but if I had not that Honour I
had purpos'd to trail a Pike under Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI>
who had done me so much Honour as to introduce
me into his Majesty's Presence. Do so then, re∣ply'd
the King, and turning to Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
said, and pray do you take Care of him; at which
overcome with the Goodness of his Discourse I
could not answer a Word, but made him a pro∣found
Reverence and retired.</P>
<P>The next Day but one, being the Seventh of
<HI>September,</HI> before Day the Army march'd from
<HI>Dieben</HI> to a large Field about a Mile from
<HI>Leipsick,</HI> where we found <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Army in full Bat∣talia
in admirable Order, which made a shew both
glorious and terrible. <HI>Tilly,</HI> like a fair Gamster,
had taken up but one Side of the Plain, and left
the other free, and all the Avenues open for the
King's Army; nor did he stir to the Charge 'till
the King's Army was compleatly drawn up and
advanced towards him: He had in his Army
44000 old Soldiers, every Way answerable to
what I have said of them before; and I shall only
add, a better Army I believe never was so soundly
beaten.</P>
<P>The King was not much inferior in Force, be∣ing
joined with the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were reckoned
22000 Men, and who drew up on the Left, ma∣king
a main Battle and two Wings, as the King
did on the Right.</P>
<P>The King placed himself at the right Wing of
his own Horse; <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> had the main Bat∣tle
of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> had the main
Battle of his own Troops, and General <HI>Arnheim</HI>
the right Wing of his Horse.</P>
<P>The second Line of the <HI>Swedes</HI> consisted of the
two <HI>Scotch</HI> Brigades, and three <HI>Swedish,</HI> with the
<HI>Finland</HI> Horse in the Wings.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Fight, <HI>Tilly</HI>'s right Wing
charg'd with such irresistible Fury upon the Left
of the King's Army where the <HI>Saxons</HI> were posted,
that nothing could withstand them; the <HI>Saxons</HI>
fled amain, and some of them carried the News
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
over the Country that all was lost, and the King's
Army overthrown; and indeed it passed for an
Oversight with some, that the King did not place
some of his old Troops among the <HI>Saxons</HI> who were
new raised Men; the <HI>Saxons</HI> lost here near 2000
Men, and hardly ever shew'd their Faces again
all the Battle, except some few of their Horse.</P>
<P>I was posted with my Comrade, the Captain,
at the Head of three <HI>Scottish</HI> Regiments of Foot,
commanded by Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> with express
Directions from the Collonel to keep by him: Our
Post was in the second Line, as a Reserve to the
King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s main Battle, and which was
strange, the main Battle, which consisted of four
great Brigades of Foot, were never charged du∣ring
the whole Fight; and yet we, who had the
Reserve, were obliged to endure the whole Weight
of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army; the Occasion was, the
right Wing of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> having defeated
the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and being eager in the Chace, <HI>Tilly,</HI>
who was an old Soldier, and ready to prevent all
Mistakes, forbids any Pursuit; let them go, says
he, but let us beat the <HI>Swedes,</HI> or we do nothing.
Upon this the victorious Troops fall in upon the
Flank of the King's Army, which the <HI>Saxons</HI> be∣ing
fled lay open to them; <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> com∣manded
the left Wing of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and having
first defeated some Regiments which charged him,
falls in upon the Rear of the <HI>Imperial</HI> right Wing,
and separates them from the Van, who were ad∣vanced
a great Way forward in pursuit of the
<HI>Saxons;</HI> and having routed the said Rear or Re∣serve,
falls on upon <HI>Tilly</HI>'s main Battle, and de∣feated
Part of them, the other Part was gone in
Chase of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and now also returned, fell
in upon the Rear of the left Wing of the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
charging them in the Flank; for they drew
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
up upon the very Ground which the <HI>Saxons</HI>
had quitted. This changed the whole Front, and
made the <HI>Swedes</HI> face about to the Left, and make
a great Front on their Flank to make this good;
our Brigades, who were placed as a Reserve for the
main Battle, were by special Order from the
King, wheeled about to the Left, and placed for
the Right of this new Front to charge the <HI>Imperi∣alists;</HI>
they were about 12 Thousand of their best
Foot, besides Horse; and flusht with the Execu∣tion
of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> fell on like Furies: The King
by this time had almost defeated the <HI>Imperialist</HI>'s
left Wing; their Horse with more Haste than good
Speed, had charged faster than their Foot could
follow, and having broke into the King's first
Line, he let them go; where, while the second
Line bears the Shock, and bravely resisted them;
the King follows them on the Crupper with 13
Troops of Horse, and some Musqueteers, by
which being hemm'd in, they were all cut down
in a Moment as it were, and the Army never dis∣ordered
with them. This fatal Blow to the left
Wing, gave the King more Leisure to defeat the
Foot which followed, and to send some Assistance
to <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> in his left Wing, who had his
Hands full with the main Battle of the <HI>Imperialists.</HI></P>
<P>But those Troops who, as I said, had routed the
<HI>Saxons,</HI> being called off from the Pursuit, had
charged our Flank, and were now grown very
strong, renewed the Battle in a terrible Manner:
Here it was I saw our Men go to Wrack; Collo∣nel
<HI>Hall,</HI> a brave Soldier, commanded the Rear of
the <HI>Swedes</HI> left Wing; he fought like a Lion, but
was slain, and most of his Regiment cut off, tho'
not unrevenged; for they entirely ruined <HI>Fur∣stemberg</HI>'s
Regiment of Foot: Collonel <HI>Cullembach</HI>
with his Regiment of Horse, was extreamly over∣laid
<PB N="69" REF="75"/>
also, and the Collonel and many brave Of∣ficers
killed, and in short all that Wing was shat∣tered,
and in an ill Condition.</P>
<P>In this Juncture came the King, and having seen
what Havock the Enemy made of <HI>Cullembach</HI>'s
Troops, he comes riding along the Front of our
three Brigades, and himself led us on to the
Charge; the Collonel of his Guards, the Baron
<HI>Dyvel,</HI> was shot dead just as the King had given him
some Orders: When the <HI>Scots</HI> advanced, seconded
by some Regiments of Horse which the King also
sent to the Charge, the bloodiest Fight began
that ever Man beheld, for the <HI>Scotish</HI> Brigades
giving Fire three Ranks at a Time over one ano∣thers
Heads, pour'd in their Shot so thick, that
the Enemy were cut down like Grass before a
Scyth; and following into the thickest of their
Foot with the Clubs of their Musquets, made a
most dreadful Slaughter, and yet was there no
flying; <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Men might be killed and knocked
down, but no Man turned his Back, nor would
give an Inch of Ground, but as they were wheel'd,
or marched, or retreated by their Officers.</P>
<P>There was a Regiment of Cuirassiers, which
stood whole to the last, and fought like Lions,
they went ranging over the Field when all their
Army was broken, and no Body cared for charg∣ing
them; they were commanded by Baron <HI>Cro∣nenburgh,</HI>
and at last went off from the Battle
whole. These were armed in black Armour from
Head to Foot, and they carried off their
General; about Six a Clock the Field was cleared
of the Enemy, except at one Place on the King's
Side, where some of them rallied, and though
they knew all was lost would take no Quarter,
but fought it out to the last Man, being found
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
dead the next Day in Rank and File as they
were drawn up.</P>
<P>I had the good Fortune to receive no Hurt in
this Battle, excepting a small Scratch on the side
of my Neck by the push of a Pike; but my
Friend received a very dangerous Wound when
the Battle was as good as over; he had engaged
with a <HI>German</HI> Collonel whose Name we could
never learn, and having killed his Man, and pres∣sed
very close upon him so that he had shot
his Horse, the Horse in the fall kept the Collonel
down, lying on one of his Legs, upon which he
demanded Quarter, which Captain <HI>Feilding</HI> grant∣ing,
helped him to quit his Horse, and having
disarmed him, was bringing him into the Line,
when the Regiment of Cuirassiers, which I men∣tioned,
commanded by Baron <HI>Cronenburgh,</HI> came
roving over the Field, and with a flying Charge
saluted our Front with a Salvo of Carabin-shot,
which wounded us a great many Men, and a∣mong
the rest the Captain received a Shot in
his Thigh, which laid him on the Ground, and
being separated from the Line, his Prisoner got
away with them.</P>
<P>This was the first Service I was in, and in∣deed
I never saw any Fight since maintained
with such Gallantry, such desperate Valour, to∣gether
with such Dexterity of Management, both
Sides being composed of Soldiers fully tried, bred
to the Wars, expert in every Thing, exact in their
Order, and uncapable of Fear, which made the
Battle be much more bloody than usual. Sir
<HI>John Hepburn,</HI> at my Request, took particular Care
of my Comrade, and sent his own Surgeon to
look after him; and afterwards when the City
of <HI>Leipsick</HI> was retaken, provided him Lodgings
<PB N="71" REF="77"/>
there, and came very often to see him; and in∣deed
I was in great Care for him too, the Sur∣geons
being very doubtful of him a great while;
for having lain in the Field all Night among
the Dead, his Wound, for want of dressing, and
with the Extremity of Cold, was in a very ill
Condition, and the Pain of it had thrown him
into a Fever. 'Twas quite dusk before the Fight
ended, especially where the last rallied Troops
fought so long, and therefore we durst not break
our Order to seek out our Friends, so that 'twas
near seven o' Clock the next Morning before we
found the Captain, who though very weak by
the loss of Blood, had raised himself up, and
placed his Back against the Buttock of a dead
Horse; I was the first that knew him, and run∣ning
to him, embraced him with a great deal
of Joy: He was not able to speak, but made Signs
to let me see he knew me, so we brought him
into the Camp, and Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> as I noted
before, sent his own Surgeons to look after him.</P>
<P>The Darkness o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Night prevented any
Pursuit, and was the only Refuge the Enemy
had left; for had there been three Hours more
Day-light, ten Thousand more Lives had been
lost, for the <HI>Swedes</HI> (and <HI>Saxons</HI> especially) en∣raged
by the Obstinacy of the Enemy, were so
throughly heated that they would have given
Quarter but to few; the Retreat was not found∣ed
'till seven o' Clock, when the King drew up
the whole Army upon the Field of Battle, and
gave strict Command that none should stir from
their Order; so the Army lay under their Arms
all Night, which was another reason why the
wounded; Soldiers suffered very much by the Cold;
for the King, who had a bold Enemy to deal with,
was not ignorant what a small Body of despe∣rate
<PB N="72" REF="78"/>
Men rallied together might have done in
the Darkness of the Night, and therefore he
lay in his Coach all Night at the Head of the Line,
though it froze very hard.</P>
<P>As soon as the Day began to peep the Trum∣pets
founded to Horse, and all the Dragoons
and Light Horse in the Army were commanded
to the Pursuit; the Cuirassiers and some com∣manded
Musqueteers advanced some Miles, if
need were, to make good their Retreat, and all
the Foot stood to their Arms for a Reserve;
but in half an Hour Word was brought to the
King, that the Enemy was quite dispersed, up∣on
which Detachments were made out of every
Regiment to search among the Dead for any
of our Friends that were wounded and the
King himself gave a strict Order, that if any
were found wounded and alive among the Ene∣my
none should kill them, but take Care to bring
them into the Camp: A Piece of Humanity which
saved the Lives of near a Thousand of the
Enemies.</P>
<P>This Piece of Service being over, the Enemy's
Camp was seized upon, and the Soldiers were
permitted to plunder it; all the Cannon, Arms,
and Ammunition was secured for the King's Use,
the rest was given up to the Soldiers, who found
so much Plunder that they had no Reason to
quarrel for Shares.</P>
<P>For my share, I was so busie with my wounded
Captain that I got nothing but a Sword, which
I found just by him when I first saw him; but
my Man brought me a very good Horse with a
Furniture on him, and one Pistol of extraordi∣nary
Workmanship.</P>
<P>I bad him get upon his Back and make the best
of the Day for himself, which he did, and I saw
<PB N="73" REF="79"/>
him no more till three Days after, when he found
me out at <HI>Leipsick</HI> so richly dressed that I hard∣ly
knew him; and after making his Excuse for
his long Absence, gave me a very pleasant Ac∣count
where he had been: He told me, that ac∣cording
to my Order being mounted on the Horse
he had brought me, he first rid into the Field
among the Dead, to get some Clothes suitable
to the Equipage of his Horse, and having seized
on a laced Coat, a Helmet, a Sword, and an ex∣traordinary
good Cane; was resolved to see
what was become of the Enemy, and following
the Track of the Dragoons, which he could ea∣sily
do by the Bodies on the Road, he fell in
with a small Party of 25 Dragoons, under no
Command but a Corporal, making to a Village
where some of the Enemies Horse had been quar∣tered;
the Dragoons taking him for an Officer
by his Horse, desired him to command them,
told him the Enemy was very rich, and they
doubted not a good Booty: He was a bold brisk
Fellow, and told them, with all his Heart; but
said he had but one Pistol, the other being broke
with firing, so they lent him a pair of Pistols,
and a small Piece they had taken, and he led
them on. There had been a Regiment of Horse
and some Troops of <HI>Crabats</HI> in the Village, but
they were fled on the first Notice of the Pur∣suit,
excepting three Troops, and these on Sight
of this small Party, supposing them to be only
the first of a greater Number, fled in the great∣est
Confusion imaginable; they took the Village
and about 50 Horses, with all the Plunder of
the Enemy, and with the Heat of the Service
he had spoiled my Horse, he said, for which he
had brought me two more; for he passing for
the Commander of the Party, had all the Ad∣vantage
<PB N="74" REF="80"/>
the Custom of War gives an Officer in
like Cases.</P>
<P><HI>I was very well pleased with the Relation the
Fellow gave me, and laughing at him,</HI> Well, Cap∣tain,
<HI>said I,</HI> and what Plunder have ye got? Enough
to make me a Captain, Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> if you please, and
a Troop ready raised too; for the Party of Dragoons are
posted in the Village by my Command, till they have
farther Orders. <HI>In short, he pulled out 60 or 70
Pieces of Gold, 5 or 6 Watches, 13 or 14 Rings,
whereof 2 were diamond Rings, one of which was
worth 50 Dollars; Silver as much as his Pockets
would hold, besides that he had brought three
Horses, two of which were laden with Baggage,
and a Boor he had hired to stay with them at</HI>
Leipsick <HI>till he had found me out.</HI> But I am a∣fraid
Captain, <HI>says I,</HI> you have plundered the Village
instead of plundering the Enemy. No indeed not we,
<HI>says he,</HI> but the <HI>Crabats</HI> had done it for us, and we
light of them just as they were carrying it off. Well,
<HI>said I,</HI> but what will you do with your Men; for when
you come to give them Orders, they will know you well
enough? No, no, says he, I took Care of that; for
just now I gave a Soldier five Dollars to carry them
News that the Army was marched to <HI>Moersburgh,</HI>
and that they should follow thither to the Regiment.</P>
<P>Having secured his Money in my Lodgings,
he asked me if I pleased to see his Horses, and
to have one for my self? I told him I would go
and see them in the Afternoon; but the Fellow
being impatient goes and fetches them: There
was three Horses, one whereof was a very good
one, and by the Furniture was an Officer's Horse
of the <HI>Crabats,</HI> and that my Man would have me
accept, for the other he had spoiled, as he said;
I was but indifferently horsed before, so I ac∣cepted
of the Horse, and went down with him
<PB N="75" REF="81"/>
to see the rest of his Plunder there; he had got
three or four pair of Pistols, two or three Bundles
of Officers Linen and Lace, a Field-Bed and a
Tent, and several other Things of Value; but
at last coming to a small Fardel, and this, says
he, I took whole from a <HI>Crabat</HI> running away
with it under his Arm, so he brought it up in∣to
my Chamber; he had not looked into it, he
said, but he understood 'twas some Plunder the
Soldiers had made, and finding it heavy took it
by Consent; we opened it and found 'twas a
Bundle of some Linen, 13 or 14 Pieces of
Plate, and in a small Cup three Rings, a fine
Necklace of Pearl, and the Value of 100 Rix-dollars
in Money. The Fellow was amazed at
his own good Fortune, and hardly knew what
to do with himself: I bid him go take Care of
his other Things, and of his Horses, and come
again; so he went and discharged the Boor that
waited, and packed up all his Plunder, and came
up to me in his old Clothes again. <HI>How now,
Captain,</HI> says I, <HI>what have you altered your Equipage
already? I am no more ashamed, Sir, of your Livery,</HI>
answered he, <HI>than of your Service, and nevertheless
your Servant for what I have got by it. Well,</HI> says
I to him, <HI>but what will you do now with all your Mo∣ney?
I wish my poor Father had some of it,</HI> says he,
<HI>and for the rest I got it for you, Sir, and desire you
would take it.</HI> He spoke it with so much Honesty
and Freedom that I could not but take it very
kindly; but however, I told him I would not
take a Farthing from him, as his Master; but I
would have him play the good Husband with
it now he had such good Fortune to get it: He told
me he would take my Directions in every Thing.
<HI>Why then,</HI> says I, <HI>I'll tell you what I would advise you
to do, turn it all into ready Money, and convey it by
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
Return home into</HI> England, <HI>and follow your self the
first Opportunity, and with good Management you may
put your self in a good Posture of living with it.</HI> The
Fellow, with a sort of Dejection in his Looks,
asked me, if he had disobliged me in any Thing?
<HI>Why,</HI> says I: That I was willing to turn him out
of his Service. <HI>No,</HI> George, (that was his Name)
says I, <HI>but you may live on this Money without being
a Servant. I'd throw it all into the</HI> Elbe, says
he, <HI>over</HI> Torgaw <HI>Bridge, rather than leave your Ser∣vice;
and besides,</HI> says he, <HI>can't I save my Money
without going from you? I got it in your Service, and
I'll never spend it out of your Service, unless you put me
away. I hope my Money won't make me the worse Servant,
if I thought it would, I'd soon have little enough. Nay,</HI>
George, says I, <HI>I shall not oblige you to it, for I am not
willing to lose you neither: come then,</HI> says I, <HI>let us
put it all together, and see what it 'twill come to.</HI> So
he laid it all together on the Table, and by our
Computation he had gotten as much Plunder as
was worth about 1400 Rix-dollars, besides 3
Horses with their Furniture, a Tent, a Bed, and
some wearing Linen. Then he takes the Neck∣lace
of Pearl, a very good Watch, a Diamond Ring,
and 100 Pieces of Gold, and lays them by them∣selves,
and having according to our best Calcula∣tion
valued the Things, he put up all the rest,
and as I was going to ask him what they were left
out for, he takes them up in his Hand, and coming
round the Table, told me, that if I did not think
him unworthy of my Service and Favour, he
begged I would give him leave to make that
Present to me; that it was my first thought, his
going out; that he had got it all in my Service,
and he should think I had no Kindness for him
if I should refuse it. I was resolved in my Mind
not to take it from him, and yet I could find no
<PB N="77" REF="83"/>
Means to resist his Importunity; at last I told
him, I would accept of Part of his Present, and
that I esteemed his Respect in that as much as
the whole; and that I would not have him impor∣tune
me farther, so I took the Ring and Watch
with the Horse and Furniture as before, and
made him turn all the rest into Money at <HI>Leipsick,</HI>
and not suffering him to wear his Livery, made
him put himself into a tolerable Equipage, and
taking a young <HI>Leipsicker</HI> into my Service, he at∣tended
me as a Gentleman from that Time
forward.</P>
<P>The King's Army never entred <HI>Leipsick</HI> but
proceeded to <HI>Moersburg,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Hall</HI>
and so marched on into <HI>Franconia,</HI> while the Duke
of <HI>Saxony</HI> employed his Forces in recovering <HI>Leip∣sick</HI>
and the driving the <HI>Imperialists</HI> out of his
Country. I continued at <HI>Leipsick</HI> 12 Days, being
not willing to leave my Comrade 'till he was
recovered; but Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> so often impor∣tuned
me to come into the Army, and sent me
Word that the King had very often enquired for
me, that at last I consented to go without him;
so having made our Appointment where to meet
and how to correspond by Letters, I went to wait
on Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> who then lay with the
King's Army at the City of <HI>Erfurt</HI> in <HI>Saxony.</HI> As
I was riding between <HI>Leipsick</HI> and <HI>Hall</HI> I observed
my Horse went very aukwardly and uneasy, and
sweat very much, though the Weather was cold,
and we had rid but very softly; I fancied there∣fore
that the Saddle might hurt the Horse, and
calls my new Captain up; <HI>George</HI> say I, I believe
this Saddle hurts the Horse; so we alighted and
looking under the Saddle found the Back of the
Horse extreamly galled; so I bid him take off the
Saddle, which he did, and giving the Horse to my
<PB N="78" REF="84"/>
young <HI>Leipsicker</HI> to lead, we sat down to see if we
could mend it, for there was no Town near us;
Says <HI>George,</HI> pointing with his Finger, if you
please to cut open the Pannel there, I'll get
something to stuff into it which will bear it from
the Horse's Back; so while he look'd for some∣thing
to thrust in, I cut a Hole in the Pannel of
the Saddle, and following it with my Finger I felt
something hard, which seemed to move up and
down; again as I thrust it with my Finger, here's
something that should not be here, says I, not yet
imagining what afterwards fell out, and calling,
run back, bad him put up his Finger; whatever
'tis, says he, 'tis this hurts the Horse, for it bears
just on his Back when the Saddle is set on; so we
strove to take hold on it, but could not reach it;
at last we took the upper Part of the Saddle quite
from the Pannel, and there lay a small Silk Purse
wrapt in a Piece of Leather, and full of Gold Du∣cats;
thou art born to be rich, <HI>George,</HI> says I to
him, here's more Money, we opened the Purse
and found in it 438 small Pieces of Gold, there I
had a new Skirmish with him whose the Money
should be; I told him 'twas his, he told me no,
I had accepted of the Horse and Furniture and
all that was about him was mine, and solemnly
vow'd he wou'd not have a Penny of it: I saw no
Remedy but put up the Money for the Present,
mended our Saddle, and went on; we lay that Night
at <HI>Hall,</HI> and having had such a Booty in the Saddle,
I made him search the Saddles of the other two
Horses; in one of which, we found Three <HI>French</HI>
Crowns, but nothing in the other.</P>
<P>We arrived at <HI>Erfurt</HI> the 28th of <HI>September,</HI> but
the Army was removed, and entred into <HI>Franco∣nia,</HI>
and at the Siege of <HI>Koning shoven</HI> we came up
with them. The first thing I did, was to pay my
<PB N="79" REF="85"/>
Civilities to Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> who received me
very kindly, but told me withal, that I had not
done well to be so long from him; that the King
had particularly enquired for me, had command∣ed
him to bring me to him at my return: I told
him the Reason of my Stay at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and how I
had left that Place and my Comrade, before he
was cured of his Wounds, to wait on him accor∣ding
to his Letters. He told me the King had
spoken some Things very obliging about me, and
he believed would offer me some Command in the
Army, if I thought well to accept of it; I told
him I had promised my Father not to take Ser∣vice
in an Army without his Leave; and yet if
his Majesty should offer it, I neither knew how
to resist it, nor had I an Inclination to any thing
more than the Service, and such a Leader; tho'
I had much rather have serv'd as a Volunteer at
my own Charge, (which as he knew was the
Custom of our <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen) than in any
Command. He replied, do as you think fit;
but some Gentlemen would give 20000 Crowns
to stand so fair for Advancement as you do.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Koningshoven</HI> capitulated that Day,
and Sir <HI>John</HI> was ordered to treat with the Citi∣zens,
so I had no farther Discourse with him then;
and the Town being taken, the Army immedi∣ately
advanced down the River <HI>Main,</HI> for the
King had his Eye upon <HI>Frankford</HI> and <HI>Mentz,</HI> two
great Cities, both which he soon became Master
of, chiefly by the prodigious Expedition of his
March; For within a Month after the Battle, he
was in the lower Parts of the Empire, and had
passed from the <HI>Elb</HI> to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> an incredible
Conquest; had taken all the Strong Cities, the
Bishopricks of <HI>Bambergh,</HI> of <HI>Wirtsburgh,</HI> and almost
all the Circle of <HI>Franconia,</HI> with Part of <HI>Schawber∣land;</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="86"/>
a Conquest large enough to be seven Year
a making by the common Course of Arms.</P>
<P>Business going on thus, the King had not Lei∣sure
to think of small Matters, and I being not
thoroughly resolved in my Mind, did not press Sir
<HI>John</HI> to introduce me; I had wrote to my Father
with an Account of my Reception in the Army,
the Civilities of Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> the Particulars
of the Battle, and had indeed press'd him to give
me Leave to serve the King of <HI>Sweden:</HI> To which
Particular I waited for an Answer, but the fol∣lowing
Occasion determined me before an Answer
cou'd possibly reach me.</P>
<P>The King was before the Strong Castle of <HI>Ma∣rienburgh,</HI>
which commands the City of <HI>Wurtsburgh;</HI>
he had taken the <HI>City,</HI> but the Garrison and rich∣er
Part of the Burghers were retir'd into the
Castle, and trusting to the Strength of the Place,
which was thought impregnable, they bad the
<HI>Swedes</HI> do their worst; 'twas well provided with
all Things, and a strong Garrison in it; so that the
Army indeed expected 'twould be a long Piece of
Work. The Castle stood on a high Rock, and
on the Steep of the Rock was a Bastion, which
defended the only Passage up the Hill into the
Castle; the <HI>Scots</HI> were chose out to make this at∣tack,
and the King was an Eye Witness of their
Gallantry: In the Action Sir <HI>John</HI> was not com∣manded
out, but Sir <HI>James Ramsey</HI> led them on,
but I observed that most of the <HI>Scotch Officers</HI> in
the other Regiments prepared to serve as Volun∣teers
for the Honour of their Countrymen, and
Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> led them on: I was resolved to
see this Piece of Service, and therefore joined my
self to the Volunteers; we were armed with Parti∣zans,
and each Man two Pistols at our Best; it was
a Piece of Service that seemed perfectly desperate,
<PB N="81" REF="87"/>
the Advantage of the Hill, the Precipice we were
to mount, the height of the Bastion, the resolute
Courage and Number of the Garrison, who from
a compleat Covert made a terrible Fire upon us,
all joined to make the Action hopeless; but the
Fury of the <HI>Scots</HI> Musqueteers was not to be a∣bated
by any Difficulties; they mounted the
Hill, scaled the Works like Madmen, running
upon the Enemies Pikes, and after two Hour's de∣sperate
Fight in the midst of Fire and Smoke, took
it by Storm, and put all the Garrison to the Sword.
The Voluntiers did their part, and had their Share
of the Loss too, for 13 or 14 were killed out of
37, besides the wounded, among whom I received
a Hurt more troublesome than dangerous, by a
Thrust of a Halberd into my Arm, which proved
a very painful Wound, and I was a great while
before it was thoroughly recovered.</P>
<P>The King received us as we drew off at the
Foot of the Hill, calling the Soldiers <HI>his brave
Scots,</HI> and commending the Officers by Name.
The next Morning the Castle was also taken by
Storm, and the greatest Booty that ever was
found in any one Conquest in the whole War;
the Soldiers got here so much Money that they
knew not what to do with it and the Plunder they
got here and at the Battle of <HI>Leipsick</HI> made them so
unruly, that had not the King' been the best
Master of Discipline in the World they had never
been kept in any reasonable Bounds.</P>
<P>The King had taken Notice of our small Party
of Voluntiers, and though I thought he had not
seen me, yet he sent the next Morning for Sir
<HI>John Hepburn,</HI> and asked him if I were not come
to the Army? <HI>Yes,</HI> says Sir <HI>John, he has been here two
or three Days:</HI> And as he was forming an Excuse
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
for not having brought me to wait on his Majesty,
says the King interrupting him, <HI>I wander you would
let him thrust himself into such a hot Piece of Service
as storming the</HI> Port Graft: <HI>Pray let him know I saw
him, and have a very good Account of his Behaviour.</HI>
Sir <HI>John</HI> returned with this Account to me, and
pressed me to pay my Duty to his Majesty the
next Morning; and accordingly, though I had
but an ill Night with the Pain of my Wound, I
was with him at the Levee in the Castle.</P>
<P>I cannot but give some short Account of the
Glory of that Morning; the Castle had been
cleared of the dead Bodies of the Enemies, and
what was not pillaged by the Soldiers, was
placed under a Guard. There was first a Maga∣zine
of very good Arms for about 18 or 20000
Foot, and 4000 Horse, a very good Train of Ar∣tillery
of about 18 Pieces of Battery, 32 brass
Field-pieces and four Mortars. The Bishop's
Treasure, and other publick Monies not plun∣dered
by the Soldiers, was telling out by the
Officers, and amounted to 100000 Florins in Mo∣ney;
and the Burghers of the Town in solemn
Procession, bareheaded, brought the King three
Tun of Gold as a Composition to exempt the
City from Plunder. Here was also a Stable of gal∣lant
Horses which the King had the Curiosity
to go and see.</P>
<P>When the Ceremony of the Burghers was over
the King came down into the Castle Court, walk∣ed
on the Parade (where the great Train of Artil∣lery
was placed on their Carriages) and round
the Walls, and gave Order for repairing the Ba∣stion
that was stormed by the <HI>Scots;</HI> and as at
the Entrance of the Parade Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> and
I made our Reverence to the King, <HI>Ho, Cavalier,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="89"/>
said the King to me, <HI>I am glad to see you,</HI> and so
passed forward; I made my bow very low, but
his Majesty said no more at that Time.</P>
<P>When the View was over the King went up
into the Lodgings, and Sir <HI>John</HI> and I walked in an
Anti-Chamber for about a Quarter of an Hour,
when one of the Gentlemen of the Bed-Chamber
came out to Sir <HI>John,</HI> and told him the King ask'd
for him; he staid but a little with the King and
came out to me, and told me the King had or∣dered
him to bring me to him.</P>
<P>His Majesty, with a Countenance full of Ho∣nour
and Goodness interrupted my Compliment,
and asked me how I did; at which answering only
with a bow, says the King, <HI>I am sorry to see you
are hurt, I would have laid my Commands on you not to
have shewn your self in so sharp a Piece of Service, if I
had known you had been in the Camp. Your Majesty
does me too much Honour,</HI> said I, <HI>in your Care of a
Life that has yet done nothing to deserve your Favour.</HI>
His Majesty was pleased to say something very
kind to me relating to my Behaviour in the Battle
of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> which I have not Vanity enough to
write; at the Conclusion whereof, when I replyed
very humbly, that I was not sensible that any
Service I had done or could do could possibly
merit so much Goodness; he told me he had
ordered me a small Testimony of his Esteem, and
withal gave me his Hand to kiss: I was now
conquered, and with a sort of Surprize, told his
Majesty, I found my self of much engaged by his
Goodness, as well as my own Inclination, that if
his Majesty would please to accept of my Devoir
I was resolved to serve in his Army, or where∣ever
he pleased to command me. <HI>Serve me,</HI> says
the King, <HI>why so you do, but I must not have you be a
Musketeer; a poor Soldier at a Dollar a Week will do
<PB N="84" REF="90"/>
that. Pray, Sir</HI> John, says the King, give him what
Commission he desires. No Commission, Sir,
says I, <HI>would please me better than Leave to fight near
your Majesty's Person, and to serve you at my own Charge
till I am qualified by more Experience to receive your
Commands. Why then it shall be so,</HI> said the King,
<HI>and I charge you,</HI> Hepburn, says he, <HI>when any Thing
offers that is either fit for him, or he desires, that you tell
me of it,</HI> and giving me his Hand again to kiss I
withdrew.</P>
<P>I was followed before I had passed the Castle-Court
by one of the King's Pages, who brought
me a Warrant directed to Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> to go
to the Master of the Horse for an immediate
delivery of Things ordered by the King himself
for my Account, where being come, the Querry
produced me a very good Coach with four Horses,
Harness and Equipage, and two very fine Saddle-Horses
out of the Stable of the Bishop's Horses,
afore-mentioned; with these there was a List for
three Servants, and a Warrant to the Steward of
the King's Baggage to defray me, my Horses
and Servants at the King's Charge till farther
Order. I was very much at a Loss how to ma∣nage
my self in this so strange freedom of so
great a Prince, and consulting with Sir <HI>John
Hepburn,</HI> I was proposing to him whether it was
not proper to go immediately back to pay my
Duty to his Majesty and acknowledge his Bounty
in the best Terms I could; but while we were
resolving to do so, the Guards stood to their Arms,
and we saw the King go out at the Gate in his
Coach to pass into the City, so we were diverted
from it for that Time. I acknowledge the
Bounty of the King was very surprising, but I
must say it was not so very strange to me when
I afterward saw the Course of his Management;
<PB N="85" REF="91"/>
Bounty in him was his natural Talent, but he
never distributed his Favours but where he
thought himself both loved and faithfully served,
and when he was so, even the single Actions of
his private Soldiers he would take particular
Notice of himself, and publickly own, acknow∣ledge
and reward them, of which I am obliged
to give some Instances.</P>
<P>A private Musqueteer at the storming the
Castle of <HI>Wurtzberg,</HI> when all the Detachment was
beaten off stood in the Face of the Enemy, and fired
his Piece, and though he had 1000 shot made at
him, stood uuconcerned, and charged his Piece
again, and let fly at the Enemy, continuing to do
so three Times, at the same Time beckoning with
his Hand to his Fellows to come on again, which
they did, animated by his Example, and carried
the place for the King.</P>
<P>When the Town was taken the King ordered
the Regiment to be drawn out, and calling for that
Soldier, thanked him before them all for taking the
Town for him, gave him 1000 Dollars in Money,
and a Commission with his own Hand for a Foot
Company, or Leave to go home, which he
would; the Soldier took the Commission on his
Knees, kissed it, and put it into his Bosom, and
told the King, he would never leave his Service
as long as he lived.</P>
<P>This Bounty of the King's, timed and suited
by his Judgment, was the Reason that he was
very well served, intirely beloved, and most
punctually obeyed by his Soldiers, who were sure
to be cherished and encouraged, if they did well,
having the King generally an Eye-witness of their
Behaviour.</P>
<P>My Indiscretion rather than Valour had en∣gaged
me so far at the Battle of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> that be∣ing
<PB N="86" REF="92"/>
in the Van of Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI>'s Brigade,
almost three whole Companies of us were sepa∣rated
from our Line, and surrounded by
the Enemies Pikes; I cannot but say also that
we were disengaged rather by a desperate Charge
Sir <HI>John</HI> made with the whole Regiment to fetch
us off, than by our own Valour, though we were
not wanting to our selves neither, but this Part
of the Action being talked of very much to the
Advantage of the young <HI>English</HI> Voluntier, and
possibly more than I deserved, was the Occasion
of all the Distinction the King used me with ever
after.</P>
<P>I had by this Time Letters from my Father,
in which, though with some Reluctance, he left
me at Liberty to enter into Arms if I thought
fit, always obliging me to be directed, and, as
he said, commanded by Sir <HI>John Hepburn;</HI> at the
same Time he wrote to Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> com∣mending
his Son's Fortunes, as he called it, to
his Care; which Letters Sir <HI>John</HI> shewed the
King, unknown to me.</P>
<P>I took Care always to acquaint my Father
of every Circumstance, and forgot not to men∣tion
his Majesty's extraordinary Favour, which
so affected my Father that he obtained a very
honourable mention of it in a Letter from King
<HI>Charles</HI> to the King of <HI>Swedon,</HI> written by his own
Hand.</P>
<P>I had waited on his Majesty with Sir <HI>John
Hepburn,</HI> to give him Thanks for his magnificent
Present, and was received with his usual Good∣ness,
and after that I was every Day among the
Gentlemen of his ordinary Attendance; and if
his Majesty went out on a Party, as he would
often do, or to view the Country, I always at∣tended
him among the Voluntiers of whom a great
<PB N="87" REF="93"/>
many always followed him; and he would often
call me out, talk with me, send me upon Mes∣sages
to Towns, to Princes, free Cities, and the
like, upon extraordinary Occasions.</P>
<P>The first Piece of Service he put me upon
had like to have embroiled me with one of his
favourite Collonels; the King was marching
through the <HI>Bergstract,</HI> a low Country on the edge
of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and, as all Meri thought, was going
to besiege <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> but on a sudden orders a
Party of his Guards, with five Companies of <HI>Scots,</HI>
to be drawn out; while they were drawing out
this Detachment the King calls me to him, Ho,
<HI>Cavalier,</HI> says he, <HI>that was his usual Word,</HI> you
shall command this Party; and thereupon gives
me Orders to march back all Night, and in the
Morning, by break of Day, to take Post under
the Walls of the Fort of <HI>Oppenheim;</HI> and imme∣diately
to entrench my self as well as I could:
<HI>Grave Neels,</HI> the Collo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el of his Guards, thought
himself injured by this Command, but the King
took the Matter upon himself, and <HI>Grave Neels</HI>
told me very familiarly afterwards, We have
such a Master, says he, that no Man can be af∣fronted
by: I thought my self wronged, says he,
when you commanded my Men over my Head;
and for my Life, says he, I knew not which way
to be angry.</P>
<P>I executed my Commission so punctually that
by break of Day I was set down within Mus∣quet-shot
of the Fort, under covert of a little
Mount, on which stood a Wind-mill, and had in∣differently
fortified my self, and at the same
Time had posted some of my Men on two other
Passes, but at farther Distance from the Fort,
so that the Fort was effectually block'd up on
the Land-side; in the Afternoon the Enemy sal∣lied
<PB N="88" REF="94"/>
on my first Entrenchment, but being covered
from their Cannon, and defended by a Ditch which
I had drawn cross the Road, they were so well
received by my Musqueteers that they retired
with the loss of 6 or 7 Men.</P>
<P>The next Day Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> was sent with
two Brigades of Foot to carry on the Work, and
so my Commission ended; the King expressed
himself very well pleased with what I had done,
and when he was so was never sparing of telling
of it, for he used to say that publick Commendati∣ons
were a great Encouragement to Valour.</P>
<P>While Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> lay before the Fort,
and was preparing to storm it, the King's Design
was to get over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> which
where in <HI>Oppenheim</HI> had sunk all the Boats they
could find; at last the King being informed
where some lay that were sunk caused them to
be weighed with all the Expedition possible, and
in the Night of the 7th of <HI>December</HI> in three
Boats passed over his Regiment of Guards, about
three Miles above the Town, and as the King
thought secure from Danger; but they were
no sooner landed and not drawn into Order but
they were charged by a Body of <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse,
and had not the Darkness given them Opportu∣nity
to draw up in the Enclosures in several
little Parties, they had been in great Danger of
being disordered, but by this Means they lined
the Hedges and Lanes so with Musqueteers, that
the remainder had Time to draw up in Battalia,
and saluted the Horse with their Musquets so that
they drew farther off.</P>
<P>The King was very impatient, hearing his Men
engaged, having no Boats nor possible Means to
get over to help them; at last, about Eleven a
Clock at Night the Boats came back, and the
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
King thrust another Regiment into them, and
though his Officers dissuaded him, would go over
himself with them on Foot, and did so. This
was three Months that very Day when the Battle
of <HI>Leipsick</HI> was fought, and winter Time too, that
the Progress of his Arms had spread from the
<HI>Elbe,</HI> where it parts <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> to
the <HI>Lower Palatinate</HI> and the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>I went over in the Boat with the King, I
never saw him in so much Concern in my Life,
for he was in Pain for his Men; but before we
got on shore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> retired, however the
King landed, ordered his Men, and prepared to en∣trench,
but he had not Time; for by that Time
the Boats were put off again, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI>
not knowing more Troops were landed, and
being reinforced from <HI>Oppenheim,</HI> came on again,
and charged with great Fury; but all Things
were now in Order; and they were readily
received and beaten back again: They came on
again the third Time, and with repeated Charges
attacked us; but at last finding us too strong for
them they gave it over. By this Time another
Regiment of Foot was come over, and as soon as
Day appeared the King with the three Regi∣ments
marched to the Town, which surrendred
at the first Summons, and the next Day the Fort
yielded to Sir <HI>John Hepburn.</HI></P>
<P>The Castle at <HI>Oppenheim</HI> held out still with a Garri∣son
of 800 <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the King leaving 200 <HI>Scots</HI>
of Sir <HI>James Ramsey's</HI> Men in the Town, drew out
to attack the Castle; Sir <HI>James Ramsey</HI> being left
wounded at <HI>Wartsburgh</HI> the King gave me the
Command of those 200 <HI>Men,</HI> which were a Regi∣ment,
that is to say, all that were left of a Gallant
Regiment of 2000 <HI>Scots</HI> which the King brought
out of <HI>Sweden</HI> with him, under that Brave Collonel;
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
there was about 30 Officers, who having no Sol∣diers
were yet in Pay, and served as Reformadoes
with the Regiment, and were over and above the
200 Men.</P>
<P>The King designed to storm the Castle on the
lower side by the Way that leads to <HI>Mentz,</HI> and
Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> landed from the other Side and
marched up to storm on the <HI>Rhine</HI> Port.</P>
<P>My Reformado <HI>Scots</HI> having observed that the
Town Port of the Castle was not so well guarded
as the rest, all the Eyes of the Garrison being
bent towards the King and Sir <HI>John Hepburn;</HI> came
running to me, and told me, they believed they
could enter the Castle Sword in Hand if
I would give them Leave; I told them I durst
not give them Orders, my Commission being
only to keep and defend the Town; but they
being very importunate, I told them they were
Voluntiers, and might do what they pleased,
that I would lend them 50 Men and draw up
the rest to second them, or bring them off, as I
saw Occasion, so as I might not hazard the
Town; this was as much as they desired, they
sallied immediately, and in a trice the Voluntiers
scaled the Port, cut in Pieces the Guard and
burst open the Gate, at which the 50 entered:
finding the Gate won I advanced immediately
with 100 Musqueteers more, having locked up
all the Gates of the Town but the Castle-Port,
and leaving 50 still for a Reserve just at that
Gate; the Townsmen too seeing the Castle as it
were taken, run to Arms, and followed me with
above 200 Men; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were knocked down
by the <HI>Scots</HI> before they knew what the Matter
was, and the King and Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> advancing
to storm, were surprized, when instead of Resist∣ance,
they saw the <HI>Spaniards</HI> throwing themselves
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
over the Walls to avoid the Fury of the <HI>Scots;</HI>
few of the Garrison got away, but were either
killed or taken, and having cleared the Castle,
I set open the Port on the King's Side, and sent
his Majesty Word the Castle was his own. The
King came on, and entered on Foot, I received him
at the Head of the <HI>Scots</HI> Reformadoes, who all
saluted him with their Pikes. The King gave
them his Hat, and turning about, <HI>Brave</HI> Scots, <HI>Brave</HI>
Scots, says he smiling, <HI>you were too quick for me;</HI>
then beckoning to me, made me tell him how and
in what Manner we had managed the Storm,
which he was exceeding well pleased with, but
especially at the Caution I had used to bring them
off if they had miscarried, and secure the Town.</P>
<P>From hence the Army marched to <HI>Mentz,</HI>
which in 4 Days Time capitulated, with the Fort
and Citadel, and the City paid his Majesty
300000 Dollars to be exempted from the Fury
of the Soldiers; here the King himself drew the
Plan of those invincible Fortifications which
to this Day makes it one of the strongest Cities
in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friburg, Koningstien, Niustat, Keiser-Lautern,</HI> and
almost all the <HI>Lower Palatinate,</HI> surrendered at
the very Terror of the King of <HI>Sweden's</HI> Approach,
and never suffered the Danger of a Siege.</P>
<P>The King held a most Magnificent Court at
<HI>Mentz,</HI> attended by the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse,</HI>
with an incredible Number of Princes and
Lords of the Empire, with Ambassadors and
Residents of Foreign Princes; and here his
Majesty staid till <HI>March</HI> when the Queen,
with a great Retinue of <HI>Swedish</HI> Nobility came
from <HI>Erfurt</HI> to see him. The King attended by
a gallant Train of <HI>German</HI> Nobility went to
<PB N="92" REF="98"/>
<HI>Frankfort,</HI> and from thence on to <HI>Hoest,</HI> to meet
the Queen, where her Majesty arrived <HI>Feb.</HI> 8th.</P>
<P>During the King's stay in these Parts, his
Armies were not idle, his Troops on one side
under the <HI>Rhinegrave,</HI> a brave and ever-fortunate
Commander, and under the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse,</HI>
on the other, ranged the Country from <HI>Lorrain</HI>
to <HI>Luxeniburgh,</HI> and past the <HI>Moselle</HI> on the
West, and the <HI>Weser</HI> on the North. Nothing could
stand before them, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army which came
to the Relief of the Catholick Electors was every
where defeated and beaten quite out of the Coun∣try,
and the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Army quite ruined; 'twas
a most pleasant Court sure as ever was seen,
where every Day Expresses arrived of Armies
defeated, Towns surrendered, Contributions a∣greed
upon, Parties routed, Prisoners taken, and
Princes sending Ambassadours to sue for Truces
and Neutralities, to make Submissions and Com∣positions,
and to pay Arrears and Contri∣butions.</P>
<P>Here arrived, <HI>Febr.</HI> 10th, the King of <HI>Bohe∣mia</HI>
from <HI>England,</HI> and with him my Lord <HI>Craven,</HI>
with a Body of <HI>Dutch Horse,</HI> and a very fine
Train of <HI>English</HI> Voluntiers, who immediately,
without any stay, marched on to <HI>Hoest</HI> to wait
upon his Majesty of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who received him
with a great deal of Civility, and was treated
at a Noble Collation, by the King and Queen,
at <HI>Frankfort.</HI> Never had the Unfortunate King
so fair a Prospect of being restored to his Inhe∣ritance
of the <HI>Palatinate</HI> as at that Time, and had
King <HI>James,</HI> his Father-in-Law, had a Soul an∣swerable
to the Occasion, it had been effected be∣fore,
but it was a strange Thing to see him equip∣ped
from the <HI>English</HI> Court with one Lord and
about 40 or 50 <HI>English Gentlemen</HI> in his Attend∣ance,
<PB N="93" REF="99"/>
whereas had the King of <HI>England</HI> now, as
'tis well known he might have done, furnished
him with 10 or 12000 <HI>English</HI> Foot, nothing
could have hindered him taking a full Possession
of his Country; and yet even without that Help
did the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> clear almost his whole
Country of <HI>Imperialists,</HI> and after his Death rein∣stal
his Son in the Electorate, but no Thanks
to us.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Craven</HI> did me the Honour to en∣quire
for me by Name, and his Majesty of <HI>Sweden</HI>
did me yet more by presenting me to the King
of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and my Lord <HI>Craven</HI> gave me a Let∣ter
from my Father, and speaking something of
my Father having served under the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> in the Famous Battle of <HI>Neuport,</HI> the King
smiling returned, <HI>And pray tell him from me his Son
has served as well in the warm Battle of</HI> Leipsick.</P>
<P>My Father being very much pleased with the
Honour I had received from so great a King, had
ordered me to acquaint his Majesty, that if he
pleased to accept of their Service he would raise
him a Regiment of <HI>English</HI> Horse at his own
Charge to be under my Command, and to be sent
over into <HI>Holland;</HI> and my Lord <HI>Craven</HI> had
Orders from the King of <HI>England</HI> to signify
his Consent to the said Levy. I acquainted my
old Friend Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> with the Contents
of the Letter, in order to have his Advice, who
being pleased with the Proposal, would have me
go to the King immediately with the Letter, but
present Service put it off for some Days.</P>
<P>The taking of <HI>Creutznach</HI> was the next Service
of any Moment; the King drew out in Person to
the Siege of this Town; the Town soon came to a
Parly, but the Castle seemed a Work of Difficulty;
for its Situation was so strong and so surrounded
<PB N="94" REF="100"/>
with Works behind and above one another, that
most People thought the King would receive a
Check from it; but it was not easy to resist the
Resolution of the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>He never battered it but with two small Pieces,
but having viewed the Works himself, ordered
a Mine under the first Ravelin, which being sprung
with Success, he commands a storm; I think there
was not more commanded Men than Voluntiers,
both <HI>English, Scots, French</HI> and <HI>Germans:</HI> My old
Comrade was by this Time recovered of his
Wound at <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and made one. The first Body
of Voluntiers of about 40, were led on by my Lord
<HI>Craven,</HI> and I led the second, among whom were
most of the Reformade <HI>Scots</HI> Officers who
took the Castle of <HI>Oppenheim;</HI> the first Party was
not able to make any Thing of it, the Garrison
fought with so much Fury that many of the
Voluntier Gentlemen being wounded, and some
killed, the rest were beaten off with Loss. The
King was in some Passion at his Men, and rated
them for running away, as he called it, though
they really retreated in good Order, and com∣manded
the Assault to be renewed. 'Twas our
Turn to fall on next; our <HI>Scots</HI> Officers not being
used to be beaten, advanced immediately, and my
Lord <HI>Craven,</HI> with his Voluntiers, pierced in with
us, fighting gallantly in the Breach with a Pike
in his Hand, and to give him the Honour due to
his Bravery, he was with the first on the Top of
the Rampart, and gave his Hand to my Comrade,
and lifted him up after him; we helped one
another up, till at last almost all the Voluntiers
had gained the Height of the Ravelin, and main∣tained
it with a great Deal of Resolution, expect∣ing
when the commanded Men had gained the
same Height to advance upon the Enemy, when
<PB N="95" REF="101"/>
one of the Enemies Captains called to my Lord
<HI>Craven,</HI> and told him if they might have honoura∣ble
Terms they would capitulate, which my
Lord telling him he would engage for, the Gar∣rison
fired no more, and the Captain leaping
down from the next Rampart came with my
Lord <HI>Craven</HI> into the Camp, where the Conditions
were agreed on, and the Castle surrendered.</P>
<P>After the taking of this Town, the King hear∣ing
of <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Approach, and how he had beaten
<HI>Gustavus Horn,</HI> the King's Field Marshal out of
<HI>Bamberg,</HI> began to draw his Forces together, and
leaving the Care of his Conquests in these Parts
to his Chancellor <HI>Oxenstern,</HI> prepares to advance
towards <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>I had taken an Opportunity to wait upon his
Majesty with Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> and being about to
introduce the Discourse of my Father's Letter,
the King told me he had received a Compliment
on my account in a Letter from King <HI>Charles:</HI> I
told him his Majesty had by his exceeding Gene∣rosity
bound me and all my Friends to pay their
Acknowledgments to him, and that I supposed
my Father had obtained such a mention of it
from the King of <HI>England</HI> as Gratitude moved
him to; that his Majesty's Favour had been
shewn in me to a Family both willing and ready
to serve him, that I had received some Commands
from my Father, which if his Majesty pleased
to do me the Honour to accept of, might put
me in a Condition to acknowledge his Majesty's
Goodness in a Manner more proportioned to the
Sense I had of his Favour; and with that I pro∣duced
my Father's Letter, and read that Clause
in it which related the Regiment of Horse,
which was as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P><PB N="96" REF="102"/>
I Read with a great deal of Satisfaction the Account
you give of the great and extraordinary Conquests of
the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and with more his Majesty'<HI>s</HI> Sin∣gular
Favour to you, I hope you will be careful to value
and deserve so much Honour; I am glad you rather
chose to serve as a Voluntier at your own Charge, than to
take any Command, which for want of Experience you
might misbehave in.</P>
<P>I have obtained of the King that be will particularly
Thank his Majesty of <HI>Sweden</HI> for the Honour he has
done you, and if his Majesty gives you so much Freedom, I
could be glad you should in the humblest Manner thank
his Majesty in the Name of an old broken Soldier.</P>
<P>If you think your self Officer enough to command them,
and his Majesty pleased to accept them, I would have you
offer to raise his Majesty a Regiment of Horse, which I
think I may near compleat in our Neighbourhood with
some of your old Acquaintance who are very willing to see
the World. If his Majesty gives you the Word, they
shall receive his Commands in the <HI>Maes,</HI> the King having
promised me to give them Arms, and transport them for
that Service into <HI>Holland;</HI> and I hope they may do his
Majesty such Service as may be for your Honour and the
Advantage of his Majesty's Interest and Glory,</P>
<CLOSER>Your loving Father.</CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>'Tis an Offer like a Gentleman and like a Soldier, <HI>says
the King,</HI> and I'll accept of it on two Conditions; first,
<HI>says the King,</HI> that I will pay your Father the Advance
Money for the raising the Regiment; and next, that they
shall be landed in the <HI>Weser</HI> or the <HI>Elbe,</HI> for which if
the King of <HI>England</HI> will not, I will pay the Passage,
for if they land in <HI>Holland,</HI> it may prove very difficult
to get them to us when the Army shall be marched out of
this Part of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="103"/>
I returned this Answer to my Father, and
sent my Man <HI>George</HI> into <HI>England</HI> to Order that
Regiment, and made him Quarter-Master; I sent
blank Commissions for the Officers, signed by
the King, to be filled up as my Father should
think fit; and when I had the King's Order for
the Commissions, the Secretary told me I must go
back to the King with them. Accordingly I went
back to the King, who opening the Packet, laid
all the Commissions but one upon a Table before
him, and bad me take them, and keeping that
one still in his Hand, <HI>Now,</HI> says he, <HI>you are one of
my Soldiers,</HI> and therewith gave me his Commis∣sion,
as Collonel of Horse in present Pay. I
took the Commission kneeling, and humbly
thanked his Majesty; <HI>But,</HI> says the King, <HI>there is
one Article of War I expect of you more than of others.
Your Majesty can expect nothing of me which Ishall not
willingly comply with,</HI> said I, <HI>as soon as I have the Ho∣nour
to understand what it is. Why it is,</HI> says the
King, <HI>that you shall never fight but when you have Orders;
for I shall not be willing to lose my Collonel before I have
the Regiment. Ishall be ready at all Times, Sir,</HI> returned
I, <HI>to obey your Majesty's Orders.</HI></P>
<P>I sent my Man Express with the King's Answer,
and the Commission to my Father, who had the Re∣giment
compleated in less than 2 Months time, and
6 of the Officers with a List of the rest came away
to me, who I presented to his Majesty when he lay
before <HI>Neurenburg,</HI> where they kissed his Hand.</P>
<P>One of the Captains offered to bring the whole
Regiment travelling as private Men into the
Army in six Weeks Time, and either to trans∣port
their Equipage, or buy it in <HI>Germany;</HI> but
'twas thought impracticable; however, I had so
many came in that Manner that I had a compleat
<PB N="98" REF="104"/>
Troop always about me, and obtained the
King's Order to muster them as a Troop.</P>
<P>On the 8th of <HI>March</HI> the King decampt, and
marching up the River <HI>Mayn,</HI> bent his Course
directly for <HI>Bavaria,</HI> talking several small Places
by the Way, and expecting to engage with <HI>Tilly</HI>
who he thought would dispute his Entrance into
<HI>Bavaria</HI> kept his Army together; but <HI>Tilly</HI> find∣ing
himself too weak to encounter him, turned
away, and leaving <HI>Bavaria</HI> open to the King,
marched into the <HI>Ʋpper Palatinate.</HI> The King
finding the Country clear of the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> comes
to <HI>Norimberg,</HI> made his Entrance into that City
the 21<HI>st of March,</HI> and being nobly treated by the
Citizens, he continued his March into <HI>Bavaria;</HI>
and on the 26th sat down before <HI>Donawert:</HI> The
Town was taken the next Day by Storm, so swift
were the Conquests of this invincible Captain.
Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> with the <HI>Scots</HI> and the <HI>English</HI>
Voluntiers at the Head of them, entred the Town
first, and cut all the Garrison to Pieces, except
such as escaped over the Bridge.</P>
<P>I had no Share in the Business of <HI>Donawert,</HI>
being now among the Horse, but I was posted
on the Roads with five Troops of Horse, where
we picked up a great many Stragglers of the
Garrison, who we made Prisoners of War.</P>
<P>'Tis observable, that this Town of <HI>Donawert</HI>
is a very strong Place and well fortified, and
yet such Expedition did the King make, and
such Resolution did he use in his first Attacks,
that he carried the Town without putting him∣self
to the Trouble of formal Approaches; 'twas
generally his way when he came before any
Town with a Design to besiege it; he never would
encamp at a Distance and begin his Trenches a
great Way off, but bring his Men immediately
<PB N="99" REF="105"/>
within half Musquet-shot of the Place, there
getting under the best Cover he could, he would
immediately begin his Batteries and Trenches
before their Faces; and if there was any Place
possible to be attacked, he would fall to storm∣ing
immediately: By this resolute way of coming
on he carried many a Town in the first heat of
his Men, which would have held out many Days
against a more Regular Siege.</P>
<P>This March of the King broke all <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Mea∣sures,
for now was he obliged to face about, and
leaving the <HI>Ʋpper Palatinate,</HI> to come to the As∣sistance
of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> for the King be∣ing
20000 strong, besides 10000 Foot and 4000
Horse and Dragoons which joined him from
the <HI>Duringer Wald,</HI> was resolved to ruin the Duke,
who lay now open to him, and was the most
powerful and inveterate Enemy of the Prote∣stants
in the Empire.</P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> was now joined with the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
and might together make about 22000 Men, and
in Order to keep the <HI>Swedes</HI> out of the Country
of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> had planted themselves along the
Banks of the River <HI>Lech,</HI> which runs on the Edge
of the Duke's Territories; and having fortified
the other Side of the River, and planted his Can∣non
for several Miles at all the convenient Pla∣ces
on the River, resolved to dispute the King's
Passage.</P>
<P>I shall be the longer in relating this Account
of the <HI>Lech,</HI> being esteemed in those Days as great
an Action as any Battle or Siege of that Age,
and particularly famous for the Disaster of the
gallant old General <HI>Tilly;</HI> and for that I can be
more particular in it than other Accounts, hav∣ing
been an Eye-witness to every part of it.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="106"/>
The King being truly informed of the Dis∣position
of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Army, was once of the
Mind to have left the Banks of the <HI>Lech,</HI> have
repassed the <HI>Danube,</HI> and so setting down before
<HI>Ingolstat,</HI> the Duke's Capital City, by the taking
that strong Town to have made his Entrance
into <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Conquest of such a Fortress,
one entire Action; but the Strength of the Place,
and the Difficulty of maintaining his Leaguer in
an Enemy's Country, while <HI>Tilly</HI> was so strong
in the Field, diverted him from that Design; he
therefore concluded that <HI>Tilly</HI> was first to be
beaten out of the Country, and then the Siege
of <HI>Ingolstat</HI> would be the easier.</P>
<P>Whereupon the King resolved to go and view
the Situation of the Enemy; his Majesty went
out the 2d of <HI>April</HI> with a strong Party of Horse,
which I had the Honour to command; we march∣ed
as near as we could to the Banks of the River,
not to be too much exposed to the Enemy's
Cannon, and having gained a little Height,
where the whole Course of the River might be
seen, the King halted, and Commanded to draw
up. The King alighted, and calling me to him,
Examined every Reach and Turning of the River
by his Glass, but finding the River run a long
and almost a straight Course, he could find no
Place which he liked, but at last turning himself
North, and looking down the stream, he found
the River fetching a long Reach, doubles short
upon it self, making a round and very narrow
Point, <HI>There's a Point will do our business,</HI> says the
King, <HI>and if the Ground be good I'll pass there, let</HI> Tilly
<HI>do his worst.</HI></P>
<P>He immediately ordered a small Party of
Horse to view the Ground, and to bring him
<PB N="101" REF="107"/>
Word particularly how high the Bank was on
each Side and at the Point; and he shall have
50 Dollars, says the King, that will bring me
Word how deep the Water is. I asked his Majesty
Leave to let me go, which he would by no
Means allow of; but as the Party was drawing
out, a Serjeant of Dragoons told the King, if he
pleased to let him go disguised as a Boor, he
would bring him an Account of every Thing he
desired. The King liked the Motion well e∣nough,
and the Fellow being very well acquaint∣ed
with the Country, puts on a Ploughman's
Habit, and went away immediately with a long
Pole upon his Shoulder; the Horse lay all this
while in the Woods, and the King stood undis∣cerned
by the Enemy on the little Hill afore∣said.
The Dragoon with his long Pole comes
down boldly to the Bank of the River, and cal∣ling
to the Centinels which <HI>Tilly</HI> had placed on
the other Bank, talked with them, asked them,
if they could not help him over the River, and
pretended he wanted to come to them; at last
being come to the Point, where, as I said, the
River makes a short Turn, he stands parlying
with them a great while, and sometimes pretend∣ing
to wade over, he puts his long Pole into the
Water, then finding it pretty Shallow he pulls
off his Hose and goes in, still thrusting his Pole in
before him, till being gotten up to his middle,
he could reach beyond him, where it was too
deep, and so shaking his Head, comes back again.
The Soldiers on the other Side laughing at him,
asked him if he could swim? He said, No. Why
you Fool you, says one of the Centinels, the
Channel of the River is 20 Foot deep. How
do you know that? says the Dragoon. Why our
<PB N="102" REF="108"/>
Engineer, says he, measured it Yesterday. This
was what he wanted, but not yet fully satisfied;
Ay but, says he, may be it may not be very
broad, and if one of you would wade in to meet
me till I could reach you with my Pole, I'd give
him half a Ducat to pull me over. The innocent
way of his Discourse so deluded the Soldiers,
that one of them immediately strips and goes in
up to the Shoulders, and our Dragoon goes in on
this Side to meet him; but the Stream took the
t'other Soldier away, and he being a good Swim∣mer,
came swimming over to this Side. The
Dragoon was then in a great deal of Pain for fear
of being discovered, and was once going to kill
the Fellow, and make off; but at last resolved
to carry on the Humour, and having enter∣tained
the Fellow with a Tale of a Tub, about
the <HI>Swedes</HI> stealing his Oats, the Fellow being a
cold wanted to be gone, and he as willing to be
rid of him, pretended to be very sorry he could
not get over the River, and so makes off.</P>
<P>By this however he learned both the Depth and
Breadth of the Channel, the Bottom and Nature of
both Shores, and every Thing the King wanted to
know; we could see him from the Hill by our
Glasses very plain, and could see the Soldier na∣ked
with him: Says the King, he will certainly
be discovered and knocked on the Head from
the other Side: He is a Fool, says the King, he
does not kill the Fellow and run off; but when
the Dragoon told his Tale, the King was ex∣tremely
well satisfied with him, gave him 100
Dollars, and made him a Quarter-master to a
Troop of Cuirassiers.</P>
<P>The King having farther examined the Dra∣goon,
he gave him a very distinct Account of
<PB N="103" REF="109"/>
the Shore and the Ground on this Side, which
he found to be higher than the Enemy's by 10
or 12 Foot, and a hard Gravel.</P>
<P>Hereupon the King resolves to pass there, and
in order to it gives, himself, particular Directi∣ons
for such a Bridge as I believe never Army
passed a River on before nor since.</P>
<P>His Bridge was only loose Plank laid upon
large Tressels in the same homely Manner as I
have seen Bricklayers raise a low Scaffold to
build a Brick Wall; the Tressels were made
higher than one another to answer to the River
as it become deeper or shallower, and was all
framed and fitted before any Appearance was
made of attempting to pass.</P>
<P>When all was ready the King brings his Army
down to the Bank of the River, and plants his
Cannon as the Enemy had done, some here and
some there, to amuse them.</P>
<P>At Night <HI>April</HI> 4th, the King commanded
about 2000 Men to march to the Point, and to
throw up a Trench on either Side, and quite
round it with a Battery of six Pieces of Cannon,
at each End besides three small Mounts, one at
the Point and one of each Side, which had each
of them two Pieces upon them. This Work was
begun so briskly, and so well carried on, the King
firing all the Night from the other Parts of the
River, that by Day-light all the Batteries at the
new Work were mounted, the Trench lined with
2000 Musqueteers, and all the Utensils of the
Bridge lay ready to be put together.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Imperialists</HI> discovered the Design, but
it was too late to hinder it, the Musqueteers in
the great Trench, and the five new Batteries,
made such continual Fire that the other Bank,
which, as before, lay 12 Foot below them, was too
<PB N="104" REF="110"/>
hot for the <HI>Imperialists;</HI> whereupon <HI>Tilly,</HI> to be
provided for the King at his coming over, falls
to work in a Wood right against the Point, and
raises a great Battery for 20 Pieces of Cannon,
with a Breast-Work, or Line, as near the River
as he could, to cover his Men, thinking that
when the King had built his Bridge he might
easily beat it down with his Cannon.</P>
<P>But the King had doubly prevented him, first
by laying his Bridge so low that none of <HI>Tilly</HI>'s
Shot could hurt it; for the Bridge lay not above
half a Foot above the Water's edge, by which
Means the King, who in that shewed himself an
excellent Engineer, had secured it from any
Batteries to be made within the Land, and the
Angle of the Bank secured it from the remoter Bat∣teries,
on the other Side, and the continual Fire
of the Cannon and small Shot beat the <HI>Imperialists</HI>
from their station just against it, they having no
Works to cover them.</P>
<P>And in the second Place, to secure his Passage
he sent over about 200 Men, and after that 200
more, who had Orders to cast up a large Ravelin
on the other Bank, just where he designed to
land his Bridge; this was done with such Ex∣pedition
too, that it was finished before Night,
and in a Condition to receive all the Shot of
<HI>Tilly</HI>'s great Battery, and effectually covered his
Bridge. While this was doing the King on his
Side lays over his Bridge. Both Sides wrought
hard all Day and all Night, as if the Spade,
not the Sword, had been to decide the Contro∣versy,
and that he had got the Victory whose
Trenches and Batteries were first ready; in the
mean while the Cannon and Musquet Bullets
flew like Hail, and made the Service so hot,
that both Sides had enough to do to make their
<PB N="105" REF="111"/>
Men stand to their Work; the King in the
hottest of it, animated his Men by his Presence,
and <HI>Tilly,</HI> to give him his Due, did the same;
for the Execution was so great, and so many Offi∣cers
killed, General <HI>Attringer</HI> wounded, and two
Sergeant Majors killed, that at last <HI>Tilly</HI> himself
was obliged to expose himself, and to come up
to the very Face of our Line to encourage his
Men, and give his necessary Orders.</P>
<P>And here about one a Clock, much about the
Time that the King's Bridge and Works were
finished, and just as they said he had ordered to
fall on upon our Ravelin with 3000 Foot, was
the Brave old <HI>Tilly</HI> slain with a Musquet Bullet
in the Thigh; he was carried off to <HI>Ingolstat,</HI>
and lived some Days after, but died of that
Wound the same Day as the King had his Horse
shot under him at the Siege of that Town.</P>
<P>We made no question of paffing the River here,
having brought every Thing so forward, and
with such extraordinary Success, but we should
have found it a very hot Piece of Work if <HI>Tilly</HI>
had lived one Day more; and if I may give my
Opinion of it, having seen <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Battery and
Breast-work, in the Face of which we must have
passed the River, I must say, that whenever we
had marched, if <HI>Tilly</HI> had fallen in with his Horse
and Foot, placed in that Trench, the whole
Army would have passed as much Danger <HI>as in
the Face of a strong Town in the storming a Counterscarp.</HI>
The King himself, when he saw with what
Judgment <HI>Tilly</HI> had prepared his Works, and
what Danger he must have run, would often say,
that Day's Success was every way equal to the
Victory of <HI>Leipsick.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tilly</HI> being hurt and carried off, as if the Soul
of the Army had been lost, they begun to draw
<PB N="106" REF="112"/>
off; the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> took Horse and rid
away as if he had fled out of Battle for his
Life.</P>
<P>The other Generals, with a little more Cau∣tion,
as well as Courage, drew off by Degrees,
sending their Cannon and Baggage away first,
and leaving some to continue firing on the Bank
of the River to conceal their Retreat; the River
preventing any Intelligence, we knew nothing of
the Disaster befallen them; and the King, who
looked for Blows, having finished his Bridge and
Ravelin, ordered to run a Line with Palisadoes
to take in more Ground on the Bank of the River,
to cover the first Troops he should send over:
This being finished the same Night, the King
sends over a Party of his Guards to relieve the
Men who were in the Ravelin, and commanded
600 Musqueteers to Man the new line out of
the <HI>Scots</HI> Brigade.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning a small Party of <HI>Scots,</HI>
commanded by one Captain <HI>Forbes,</HI> of my Lord
<HI>Reas</HI> Regiment, were sent out to learn something
of the Enemy, the King observing they had not
fired all Night; and while this Party were abroad,
the Army stood in Battalia; and my old Friend
Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI> whom of all Men the King
most depended upon for any desperate Service,
was ordered to pass the Bridge with his Brigade,
and to draw up without the Line, with Com∣mand
to advance as he found the Horse who
were to second him came over</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John</HI> being passed without the Trench,
meets Captain <HI>Forbes</HI> with some Prisoners, and
the good News of the Enemy's Retreat; he sends
him directly to the King, who was by this Time
at the Head of his Army, in full Battalia ready
to follow his Vanguard, expecting a hot Day's
<PB N="107" REF="113"/>
Work of it. Sir <HI>John</HI> sends Messenger after Mes∣senger
to the King, intreating him to give him
Orders to advance; but the King would not suf∣fer
him; for he was ever upon his Guard, and
would not venture a Surprize; so the Army
continued on this Side the <HI>Lech</HI> all Day, and the
next Night. In the Morning the King sent for
me, and ordered me to draw out 300 Horse, and
a Collonel with 600 Horse, and a Collonel with
800 Dragoons, and ordered us to enter the Wood
by 3 Ways, but so as to be able to relieve one
another; and then ordered Sir <HI>John Hepburn</HI> with
his Brigade to advance to the edge of the Wood
to secure our Retreat; and at the same Time com∣manded
another Brigade of Foot to pass the
Bridge, if need were, to second Sir <HI>John Hepburn,</HI>
so warily did this prudent General proceed.</P>
<P>We advanced with our Horse into the <HI>Bavarian</HI>
Camp, which we found forsaken; the plunder
of it was inconsiderable, for the exceeding Cau∣tion
the King had used gave them Time to carry
off all their Baggage; we followed them three or
four Miles and returned to our Camp.</P>
<P>I confess I was most diverted that Day with
viewing the Works which <HI>Tilly</HI> had cast up, and
must own again, that had he not been taken
off, we had met with as desperate a Piece of
Work as ever was attempted. The next Day the
rest of the Cavalry came up to us, commanded
by <HI>Gustavus Horn,</HI> and the King and the whole
Army followed; we advanced through the Heart
of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> took <HI>Rain</HI> at the first Summons, and
several other small Towns, and sat down before
<HI>Ausburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ausburg,</HI> though a Protestant City, had a po∣pish
<HI>Bavarian</HI> Garrison in it of above 5000 Men,
commanded by a <HI>Fugger</HI> a great Family in <HI>Ba∣varia.</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="114"/>
The Governour had posted several little
Parties as out Scouts at the Distance of two Miles
and half, or three Miles from the Town. The
King, at his coming up to this Town, sends me
with my little Troop, and 3 Companies of Dra∣goons
to beat in these out Scouts; the first Party
I light on was not above 16 Men, who had made a
small Barricado cross the Road, and stood reso∣lutely
upon their Guard; I commanded the Dra∣goons
to alight, and open the Barricado, which
while they resolutely performed, the 16 Men
gave them 2 Volleys of their Musquets, and
through the Enclosures made their Retreat to
a Turn-pike about a quarter of a Mile farther.
We past their first Traverse, and coming up to
the Turn-pike, I found it defended by 200 Mus∣queteers:
I prepared to attack them, sending
word to the King how strong the Enemy was,
and desired some Foot to be sent me. My Dra∣goons
fell on, and tho' the Enemy made a very hot
Fire, had beat them from this Post before 200
Foot, which the King had sent me, had come up;
being joined with the Foot, I followed the Ene∣my,
who retreated fighting, till they came under
the Cannon of a strong Redoubt, where they drew
up, and I could see another Body of Foot of about
300 join them out of the Works; upon which
I halted, and considering I was in View of the
Town, and a great way from the Army, I faced
about and began to march off; as we marched I
found the Enemy followed, but kept at a Di∣stance,
as if they only designed to observe me; I
had not marched far, but I heard a Volly of small
Shot, answered by 2 or 3 more, which I presently
apprehended to be at the Turn-pike, where I
had left a small Guard of 26 Men, with a Lieu∣tenant.
Immediately I detached 100 Dragoons
<PB N="109" REF="115"/>
to relieve my Men, and secure my Retreat, fol∣lowing
my self as fast as the Foot could march. The
Lieutenant sent me back word the Post was
taken by the Enemy, and my Men cut off; upon this
I doubled my Pace, and when I came up I found
it as the Lieutenant said; for the Post was taken
and manned with 300 Musqueteers, and three
Troops of Horse; by this Time also I found the
Party in my Rear made up towards me, so that
I was like to be charged in a narrow Place, both
in Front and Rear.</P>
<P>I saw there was no Remedy but with all my
Force to fall upon that Party before me, and
so to break through before those from the Town
could come up with me; wherefore commanding
my Dragoons to alight, I ordered them to fall
on upon the Foot; their Horse were drawn up in
an enclosed Field on one Side of the Road, a
great Ditch securing the other Side, so that they
thought if I charged the Foot in Front they
would fall upon my Flank, while those behind
would charge my Rear; and indeed had the other
come in Time, they had cut me off; my Dra∣goons
made three fair Charges on their Foot, but
were received with so much Resolution, and so
brisk a Fire that they were beaten off, and
sixteen Men killed: Seeing them so rudely
handled, and the Horse ready to fall in, I
relieved them with 100 Musqueteers and
they renewed the Attack, at the same Time
with my Troop of Horse, flanked on both Wings
with 50 Musqueteers, I faced their Horse, but
did not offer to charge them; the Case grew
now desperate, and the Enemy behind were just
at my Heels with near 600 Men; the Captain who
commanded the Musqueteers who flanked my
Horse came up to me, says he, if we do not force
<PB N="110" REF="116"/>
this Pass all will be lost; if you will draw out your
Troop and 20 of my Foot, and fall in, I'll engage
to keep off the Horse with the rest. With all
my Heart, says I.</P>
<P>Immediately I wheel'd off my Troop, and a
small Party of the Musqueteers followed me, and
fell in with the Dragoons and Foot, who
seeing the Danger too, as well as I, fought like
Mad Men; the Foot at the Turn-pike were not
able to hinder our Breaking through, so we made
our way out, killing about 150 of them, and put
the rest into Confusion.</P>
<P>But now was I in as great a Difficulty as before
how to fetch off my brave Captain of Foot, for
they charged home upon him; he defended him∣self
with extraordinary Gallantry, having the
Benefit of a Piece of a Hedge to cover him; but
he lost half his Men, and was just upon the
Point of being defeated, when the King, informed
by a Soldier that escaped from the Turn-pike,
one of 26, had sent a Party of 600 Dragoons to
bring me off; these came upon the Spur, and
joined with me just as I had broke through the
Turn-pike; the Enemy's Foot rallied behind
their Horse, and by this Time their other Party
was come in, but seeing our Relief they drew off
together.</P>
<P>I lost above 100 Men in these Skirmishes, and
kill'd them about 180; we secured the Turn-pike,
and placed a Company of Foot there with 100
Dragoons, and came back well beaten to the
Army. The King, to prevent such uncertain
Skirmishes, advanced the next Day in View of the
Town, and according to his Custom, sits down
with his whole Army within Cannon-shot of
their Walls.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="117"/>
The King won this great City by Force of
Words, for by two or three Messages and Letters
to and from the Citizens, the Town was gained,
the Garrison not daring to defend them against
their Wills. His Majesty made his publick En∣trance
into the City on the 14th of <HI>April,</HI> and
receiving the Compliments of the Citizens, ad∣vanced
immediately to <HI>Ingolstat,</HI> which is accoun∣ted,
and really is the strongest Town in all these
Parts.</P>
<P>The Town had a very strong Garrison in it,
and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> lay entrenched with his
Army under the Walls of it, on the other Side of
the River. The King, who never loved long
Sieges, having viewed the Town, and brought
his Army within Musquet-shot of it, called a
Council of War, where it was the King's Opi∣nion,
in short, that the Town would lose him
more than 'twas worth, and therefore he re∣solved
to raise his Siege.</P>
<P>Here the King going to view the Town had
his Horse shot with a Cannon-bullet from the
Works, which tumbled the King and his Horse
over one another, that every Body thought he
had been killed, but he received no Hurt at all;
that very Minute, as near as could be learnt, Ge∣neral
<HI>Tilly</HI> died in the Town of the Shot he re∣ceived
on the Bank of the <HI>Lech</HI> as aforesaid.</P>
<P>I was not in the Camp when the King was
hurt, for the King had sent almost all the Horse
and Dragoons, under <HI>Gustavus Horn,</HI> to face the
Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Camp, and after that to plun∣der
the Country, which truly was a Work the
Soldiers were very glad of, for it was very sel∣dom
they had that Liberty given them, and
they made very good use of it when it was; for
the Country of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was rich and plentiful,
<PB N="112" REF="118"/>
having seen no Enemy before during the whole
War.</P>
<P>The Army having left the Siege of <HI>Ingolstat,</HI>
proceeds to take in the rest of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> Sir <HI>John
Hepburn</HI> with 3 Brigades of Foot, and <HI>Gustavus
Horn</HI> with 3000 Horse and Dragoons, went to
the <HI>Landshut,</HI> and took it the same Day; the
Garrison was all Horse, and gave us several Ca∣misadoes
at our Approach, in one of which I lost
two of my Troops, but when we had beat them
into colse Quarters, they presently capitulated.
The General got a great Sum of Money of the
Town befides a great many Presents to the Offi∣cers:
And from thence the King went on to
<HI>Munick,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s Court; some of
the General Officers would fain have had the
plundering of the Duke's Palace; but the King
was too generous, the City paid him 400000
Dollars; and the Duke's Magazine was there
seized, in which was 140 Pieces of Cannon, and
small Arms for above 20000 Men. The great
Chamber of the Duke's Rarities was preserved
by the Kings special Order with a great deal of
Care. I expected to have staid here some Time,
and to have taken a very exact Account of this
curious Labaratory; but being commanded away,
I had no Time, and the Fate of the War never
gave me Opportunity to see it again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperialists</HI> under the Command of Comis∣sary
<HI>Osta</HI> had besieged <HI>Bibrach,</HI> an Imperial
City not very well fortified, and the Inhabitants
being under the <HI>Swede</HI>'s Protection, defended
themselves as well as they could, but were in
great Danger, and sent several Expresses to the
King for Help.</P>
<P>The King immediately detaches a strong Body
of Horse and Foot, to relieve <HI>Bibrach,</HI> and would
<PB N="113" REF="119"/>
be the Commander himself; I marched among
the Horse, but the <HI>Imperialists</HI> saved us the La∣bour;
for the News of the King's coming fright∣ed
away <HI>Osta,</HI> that he left <HI>Bibrach,</HI> and hardly
looked behind him 'till he got up to the <HI>Bodensee,</HI>
on the Confines of <HI>Swisserland.</HI></P>
<P>At our Return from this Expedition, the King
had the first News of <HI>Wallestein</HI>'s Approach, who
on the Death of Count <HI>Tilly,</HI> being declared Ge∣neralissimo
of the Emperor's Forces, had plaid
the Tyrant in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was now advancing
with 60000 Men, as they reported, to relieve
the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P>The King therefore, in order to be in a Posture
to receive this great General, resolves to quit <HI>Ba∣varia,</HI>
and to expect him on the Frontiers of <HI>Fran∣conia;</HI>
and because he knew the <HI>Norembergers,</HI> for
their Kindness to him, would be the first Sacri∣fice,
he resolved to defend that City against him
whatever it cost.</P>
<P>Nevertheless he did not leave <HI>Bavaria</HI> without
a Defence; but on the one Hand he left Sir <HI>John
Bannier</HI> with 10000 Men about <HI>Ausburgh,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Saxe-Weymar</HI> with another like Army
about <HI>Ʋlme</HI> and <HI>Meningen,</HI> with Orders so to direct
their March, as that they might join him upon
any Occasion in a few Days.</P>
<P>We encamped about <HI>Noremberg</HI> the Middle of
<HI>June.</HI> The Army, after so many Detachments, was
not above 19000 Men. The Imperial Army joined
with the <HI>Bavarian,</HI> were not so numerous as was
reported, but were really 60000 Men. The
King, not strong enough to fight yet, as he used
to say, was strong enough not to be forced to
to fight, formed his Camp so under the Cannon
of <HI>Noremberg,</HI> that there was no besieging the
<PB N="114" REF="120"/>
Town, but they must besiege him too; and he
fortified his Camp in so formidable a Manner,
that <HI>Wallestein</HI> never durst attack him. On the
30th of <HI>June, Wallestein</HI>'s Troops appeared, and on
the 5th of <HI>July,</HI> encamped close by the King, and
posted themselves not on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Side, but
between the King and his own Friends of <HI>Schwa∣ben,</HI>
and <HI>Frankenland</HI> in order to intercept his
Provisions, and, as they thought, to starve him out
of his Camp.</P>
<P>Here they lay to see, as it were, who could
subsist longest; the King was strong in Horse, for
we had full 8000 Horse and Dragoons in the
Army, and this gave us great Advantage in the
several Skirmishes we had with the Enemy.
The Enemy had Possession of the whole Country,
and had taken effectual Care to furnish their
Army with Provisions; they placed their Guards
in such excellent Order, to secure their Convoys,
that their Waggons went from Stage to Stage as
quiet as in a time of Peace, and were relieved
every five Miles by Parties constantly posted on
the Road. And thus the Imperial General sat
down by us, not doubting but he should force
the King either to fight his Way through, on
very disadvantageous Terms, or to rise for want
of Provisions, and leave the City of <HI>Noremberg</HI>
a Prey to his Army; for he had vowed the De∣struction
of the City, and to make it a second
<HI>Magdeburg.</HI></P>
<P>But the King, who was not to be easily de∣ceived,
had countermined all <HI>Wallestein</HI>'s Designs;
he had passed his Honour to the <HI>Norembergers,</HI>
that he would not leave them, and they had
undertaken to Victual his Army, and secure him
from Want, which they did so effectually, that
<PB N="115" REF="121"/>
he had no Occasion to expose his Troops to any
Hazard or Fatigues for Convoys or Forage on
any Account whatever.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Noremberg</HI> is a very rich▪ and po∣pulous
City; and the King being very sensible of
their Danger, had given his Word for their De∣fence:
And when they, being terrified at the
Threats of the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> sent their Deputies to
beseech the King to take care of them, he sent
them Word, he would, and be besieged with them.
They on the other Hand laid in such Stores of
all Sorts of Provision, both for Men and Horse,
that had <HI>Wallestein</HI> lain before it six Months longer,
there would have been no Scarcity. Every private
House was a Magazine, the Camp was plenti∣fully
supplied with all Manner of Provisions, and
the Market always full, and as cheap as in Times
of Peace. The Magistrates were so careful, and
preserved so excellent an Order in the Disposal
of all sorts of Provision, that no engrossing of
Corn could be practised; for the Prices were
every Day directed at the Town-house: And if
any Man offered to demand more Money for
Corn, than the stated Price, he could not sell,
because at the Town Store-house you might buy
cheaper. Here are two Instances of good and
bad Conduct; the City of <HI>Magdeburgh</HI> had been
intreated by the King to settle Funds, and raise
Money for their Provision and Security, and to
have a sufficient Garrison to defend them, but they
made Difficulties, either to raise Men for them∣selves,
or to admit the King's Troops to affift
them, for fear of the Charge of maintaining
them; and this was the Cause of the City's
Ruin.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Noremberg</HI> open'd their Arm sto
receive the Assistance proferred by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and
<PB N="116" REF="122"/>
their Purses to defend their Town, and Common
Cause, and this was the saving them absolutely
from Destruction. The rich Burghers and Ma∣gistrates
kept open Houses, where the Officers
of the Army were always welcome; and the
Council of the City took such Care of the Poor,
that there was no Complaining nor Disorders in
the whole City. There is no doubt but it cost the
City a great deal of Money; but I never saw a
publick Charge borne with so much Chearful∣ness,
nor managed with so much Prudence and
Conduct in my Life. The City fed above 50000
Mouths every Day, including their own Poor,
besides themselves; and yet when the King had
lain thus 3 Months, and finding his Armies
longer in coming up than he expected, asked the
Burgrave how their Magazines held out? He
answered, they desired his Majesty not to hasten
things for them, for they could maintain them∣selves
and him 12 Months longer, if there was
Occasion. This Plenty kept both the Army and
City in good Health, as well as in good Heart;
whereas nothing was to be had of us but Blows;
for we fetched nothing from without our Works,
nor had no Business without the Line, but to
interrupt the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Manner of the King's Encampment de∣serves
a particular Chapter. He was a compleat
Surveyor, and a Master in Fortification, not to
be outdone by any Body. He had posted his
Army in the Suburbs of the Town, and drawn
Lines round the whole Circumference, so that
he begirt the whole City with his Army; his
Works were large, the Ditch deep, flanked with in∣numerable
Bastions, Ravelins, Horn-works, Forts,
Redoubts, Batteries and Pallisadoes, the incessant
Work of 8000 Men▪ for about 14 Days; besides
<PB N="117" REF="123"/>
that the King was adding some thing or other
to it every Day; and the very Posture of his
Camp was enough to tell a bigger Army than
<HI>Wallestein</HI>'s, that he was not to be assaulted in his
Trenches.</P>
<P>The King's Design appeared chiefly to be the
Preservation of the City; but that was not all:
He had three Armies acting abroad in three several
Places; <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> was on the <HI>Mosel,</HI> the Chan∣cellor
<HI>Oxenstern</HI> about <HI>Mentz, Cologn,</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI>
Duke <HI>William</HI> and Duke <HI>Bernard,</HI> together with
General <HI>Bannier</HI> in <HI>Bavaria.</HI> And though he de∣signed
they should all join him, and had wrote
to them all to that purpose, yet he did not
hasten them, knowing that while he kept the
main Army at Bay about <HI>Noremberg,</HI> they would
without Opposition reduce those several Coun∣tries
they were acting in to his Power. This
occasioned his lying longer in the Camp at <HI>No∣remberg</HI>
than he would have done, and this oc∣casioned
his giving the <HI>Imperialists</HI> so many Alarms
by his strong Parties of Horse, of which he was
well provided, that they might not be able to
make any considerable Detachments for the Re∣lief
of their Friends: And here he shewed his
Mastership in the War; for by this means his
Conquests went on as effectually as if he had been
abroad himself.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, it was not to be expected
two such Armies should lye long so near without
some Action; the Imperial Army being Masters
of the Field, laid the Country for 20 Miles round
<HI>Noremberg</HI> in a manner desolate; what the Inha∣bitants
could carry away had been before secured
in such strong Towns as had Garrisons to protect
them, and what was left, the hungry <HI>Crabats</HI> de∣voured,
or set on Fire; but sometimes they were
<PB N="118" REF="124"/>
met with by our Men, who often paid them home
for it. There had passed several small Rencoun∣ters
between our Parties and theirs; and as it
falls out in such Cases, sometimes one Side, some∣times
the other, got the better; but I have
observed there never was any Party sent out by
the King's special Appointment, but always came
home with Victory.</P>
<P>The first considerable Attempt, as I remember,
was made on a Convoy of Ammunition: The Party
sent out was commanded by a <HI>Saxon</HI> Collonel, and
consisted of a 1000 Horse, and 500 Dragoons,
who burnt above 600 Waggons, loaden with
Ammunition and Stores for the Army, besides tak∣ing
about 2000 Musquets which they brought
back to the Army.</P>
<P>The latter end of <HI>July</HI> the King received Ad∣vice,
that the <HI>Imperialists</HI> had formed a Magazine
for Provision at a Town called <HI>Freynstat,</HI> 20 Miles
from <HI>Noremberg.</HI> Hither all the Booty and Con∣tributions
raised in the <HI>Ʋpper Palatinate,</HI> and
Parts adjacent, was brought and laid up as in a
Place of Security; a Garrison of 600 Men being
placed to defend it; and when a Quantity of Pro∣visions
was got together, Convoys were appointed
to fetch it off.</P>
<P>The King was resolved, if possible, to take or de∣stroy
this Magazine; and sending for Collonel
<HI>Dubalt,</HI> a <HI>Swede,</HI> and a Man of extraordinary Con∣duct,
he tells him his Design, and withal, that
he must be the Man to put it in Execution, and
ordered him to take what Forces he thought con∣venient.
The Collonel, who knew the Town
very well, and the Country about it, told his
Majesty, he would attempt it with all his Heart;
but he was affraid 'twould require some Foot to
make the Attack; but we cant stay for that, says
<PB N="119" REF="125"/>
the King, you must then take some Dragoons
with you, and immediately the King called for
me. I was just coming up the Stairs, as the King's
Page was come out to enquire for me; so I went
immediately in to the King. Here is a Piece of
hot Work for you, says the King, <HI>Dubalt</HI> will
tell it you; go together and contrive it.</P>
<P>We immediately withdrew, and the Collonel
told me the Design, and what the King and he
had discoursed; that in his Opinion Foot would
be wanted: But the King had declared there was
no Time for the Foot to march, and had pro∣posed
Dragoons. I told him, I thought Dragoons
might do as well; so we agreed to take 1600
Horse and 400 Dragoons. The King, impatient
in his Design, came into the Room to us to know
what we had resolved on, approved our Measures,
gave us Orders immediately; and turning to me,
you shall command the Dragoons, says the King,
but <HI>Dubalt</HI> must be General in this Case, for he
knows the Country. Your Majesty, said I, shall
be always served by me in any Figure you please.
The King wished us good Speed, and hurried
us away the same Afternoon, in order to come to
the Place in Time. We marched slowly on be∣cause
of the Carriages we had with us, and came
to <HI>Freynstat</HI> about One a Clock in the Night per∣fectly
undiscoverd; the Guards were so negli∣gent,
that we came to the very Port before they
had Notice of us, and a Serjeant with 12 Dragoons
thrust in upon the Out-Centinels, and killed them
without Noise.</P>
<P>Immediately Ladders were placed to the Half-Moon
which defended the Gate, which the Dra∣goons
mounted and carried in a trice, about 28
Men being cut in Pieces within. As soon as the
<PB N="120" REF="126"/>
Ravelin was taken, they burst open the Gate, at
which I entered at the Head of 200 Dragoons,
and seized the Drawbridge. By this Time the
Town was in Alarm, and the Drums beat to
Arms, but it was too late; for by the help of a
Petard we broke open the Gate, and entered
the Town. The Garrison made an obstinate
Fight for about half an Hour, but our Men be∣ing
all in, and 3 Troops of Horse dismounted
coming to our Assistance with their Carabines,
the Town was entirely mastered by Three of
the Clock, and Guards set to prevent any Body
running to give Notice to the Enemy. There
were about 200 of the Garrison killed, and
the rest taken Prisoners. The Town being thus
secured, the Gates were opened, and Collonel
<HI>Dubalt</HI> came in with the Horse.</P>
<P>The Guards being set, we entered the Maga∣zine
where we found an incredible Quantity of all
sorts of Provision. There was 150 Tun of Bread,
8000 Sacks of Meal, 4000 Sacks of Oats, and
of other Provisions in Proportion. We caused as
much of it as could be loaded to be brought away
in such Waggons and Carriages as we found, and
set the rest on Fire, Town and all; we staid by it
till we saw it past a Possibility of being saved,
and then drew off with 800 Waggons, which we
found in the Place, most of which we loaded
with Bread, Meal and Oats. While we were
doing this we sent a Party of Dragoons into the
Field, who met us again as we came out, with
above a 1000 Head of Black Cattle, besides
Sheep.</P>
<P>Our next Care was to bring this Booty home
without meeting with the Enemy; to secure which,
the Collonel immediately dispatch'd an Express to
<PB N="121" REF="127"/>
the King, to let him know of our Success, and to
desire a Detachment might be made to secure our
Retreat, being charged with so much Plunder.</P>
<P>And it was no more than Need; for tho' we had
used all the Diligence possible to prevent any
Notice, yet some body more forward than ordi∣nary,
had scap'd away and carried News of it to
the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army. The General upon this bad
News detaches Major General <HI>Sparr,</HI> with a Body
of 6000 Men to cut off our Retreat. The King,
who had Notice of this Detachment, marches
out in Person with 3000 Men to wait upon Gene∣ral
<HI>Sparr:</HI> All this was the Account of one Day;
the King met General <HI>Sparr</HI> at the Moment when
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Troops were divided, fell upon them, routed
one Part of them, and the rest in a few Hours
after; killed them a 1000 Men, and took the Ge∣neral
Prisoner.</P>
<P>In the Interval of this Action, we came safe to
the Camp with our Booty, which was very con∣siderable,
and would have supplied our whole Ar∣my
for a Month. Thus we feasted at the Enemy's
Cost, and beat them into the Bargain.</P>
<P>The King gave all the live Cattle to the <HI>No∣rembergers,</HI>
who, tho' they had really no want of
Provisions, yet fresh Meat was not so plentiful as
such Provisions which were stored up in Vessels
and laid by.</P>
<P>After this Skirmish, we had the Country more
at Command than before, and daily fetch'd in
fresh Provisions and Forage in the Fields.</P>
<P>The two Armies had now lain a long Time in
sight of one another, and daily Skirmishes had
considerably weakened them; and the King be∣ginning
to be impatient, hastened the Advance∣ment
of his Friends to join him, in which also
they were not backward; but having drawn to∣gether
<PB N="122" REF="128"/>
their Forces from several Parts, and all
joined the Chancellor <HI>Oxenstern,</HI> News came the
15th of <HI>August,</HI> that they were in full March to
join us; and being come to a small Town called
<HI>Brock,</HI> the King went out of the Camp with about
1000 Horse to view them. I went along with the
Horse, and the 21st of <HI>August</HI> saw the Review of
all the Armies together, which were 30000 Men
in extraordinary Equipage, old Soldiers, and
commanded by Officers of the greatest Conduct
and Experience in the World. There was the rich
Chancellor of <HI>Sweden</HI> who commanded as General,
<HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> and <HI>John Bannier,</HI> both <HI>Swedes</HI> and
old Generals; Duke <HI>William</HI> and Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of
<HI>Weymar,</HI> the Landgrave of <HI>Hesse Cassel,</HI> the Pala∣tine
of <HI>Birkenfelt,</HI> and Abundance of Princes and
Lords of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Armies being joined, the King who was
now a Match for <HI>Wallestein,</HI> quits his Camp and
draws up in Battalia before the <HI>Imperial</HI> Trenches;
but the Scene was changed; <HI>Wallestein</HI> was no
more able to fight now than the King was before;
but keeping within his Trenches, stood upon his
Guard. The King coming up close to his Works,
plants Batteries, and cannonaded him in his very
Camp.</P>
<P>The <HI>Imperialists</HI> finding the King press upon
them, retreat into a woody Country about three
Leagues, and taking Possession of an old ruin'd
Castle, posted their Army behind it.</P>
<P>This old Castle they fortified, and placed a very
strong Guard there. The King having viewed the
Place, tho' it was a very strong Post, resolved to
attack it with the whole right Wing. The Attack
was made with a great deal of Order and Resolu∣tion,
the King leading the first Party on with
Sword in Hand, and the Fight was maintained
<PB N="123" REF="129"/>
on both Sides with the utmost Gallantry and Ob∣stinacy
all the Day and the next Night too; for
the Cannon and Musquet never gave over 'till the
Morning; but the <HI>Imperialists</HI> having the Advan∣tage
of the Hill, of their Works and Batteries,
and being continually relieved, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> na∣ked,
without Cannon or Works, the Post was
maintained; and the King finding it would cost
him too much Blood, drew off in the Morning</P>
<P>This was the famous Fight at <HI>Attembergh,</HI> where
the <HI>Imperialists</HI> boasted to have shewn the World
the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was not invincible. They call
it the Victory at <HI>Attembergh;</HI> 'tis true, the King
failed in his Attempt of carrying their Works,
but there was so little of a Victory in it, that the
<HI>Imperial</HI> General thought fit not to venture a se∣cond
Brush, but to draw off their Army as soon as
they could to a safer Quarter.</P>
<P>I had no Share in this Attack, very few of the
Horse being in the Action; but my Comerade,
who was always among the <HI>Scots</HI> Voluntiers was
wounded and taken Prisoner by the Enemy. They
used him very civilly, and the King and <HI>Wallestein</HI>
straining Courtesies with one another, the King
released Major General <HI>Sparr</HI> without Ransom,
and the <HI>Imperial</HI> General sent home Collonel <HI>Tor∣tenson</HI>
a <HI>Swede,</HI> and 16 Voluntier Gentlemen who
were taken in the Heat of the Action, among
whom my Captain was one.</P>
<P>The King lay 14 Days facing the <HI>Imperial</HI> Ar∣my,
and using all the Stratagems possible to bring
them to a Battle, but to no purpose; during
which Time, we had Parties continually out, and
very often Skirmishes with the Enemy.</P>
<P>I had a Command of one of these Parties in an
Adventure, wherein I got no Booty, nor much
Honour. The King had received Advice of a Con∣voy
<PB N="124" REF="130"/>
of Provisions which was to come to the Ene∣my's
Camp from the <HI>Ʋpper Palatinate,</HI> and ha∣ving
a great Mind to surprize them, he command∣ed
us to way-lay them with 1200 Horse, and 800
Dragoons. I had exact Directions given me of the
Way they were to come, and posting my Horse
in a Village a little out of the Road, I lay with my
Dragoons in a Wood, by which they were to pass
by break of Day. The Enemy appeared with
their Convoy, and being very wary, their Out-Scouts
discovered us in the Wood, and fired upon
the Centinel I had posted in a Tree at the En∣trance
of the Wood. Finding my self discovered,
I would have retreated to the Village where my
Horse were posted, but in a Moment the Wood
was skirted with the Enemy's Horse, and a Thou∣sand
commanded Musqueteers advanced to beat
me out. In this Pickle I sent away three Messen∣gers
one after another for the Horse, who were
within two Miles of me, to advance to my Relief;
but all my Messengers fell into the Enemy's Hands.
400 of my Dragoons on foot, whom I had plac'd at a
little Distance before me, stood to their Work, and
beat off two Charges of the Enemy's Foot with some
Loss on both Sides: Mean Time 200 of my Men
fac'd about, and rushing out of the Wood, broke
through a Party of the Enemy's Horse who stood
to watch our coming out. I confess I was ex∣ceedingly
surprized at it, thinking those Fellows
had done it to make their Escape, or else were
gone over to the Enemy; and my Men were so
discouraged at it, that they began to look about
which way to run to save themselves, and were
just upon the Point of disbanding to shift for
themselves, when one of the Captains called to
me aloud to beat a Parle and Treat. I made no An∣swer,
but, as if I had not heard him, immediately
<PB N="125" REF="131"/>
gave the Word for all the Captains to come to∣gether.
The Consultation was but short, for the
Musqueteers were advancing to a third Charge,
with Numbers which we were not likely to deal
with. In short, we resolved to beat a Parle, and
demand Quarter, for that was all we could ex∣pect;
when on a sudden the Body of Horse I had
posted in the Village being directed by the Nolse,
had advanced to relieve me, if they saw Occasion,
and had met the 200 Dragoons who guided them
directly to the Spot where they had broke thro',
and all together fell upon the Horse of the Ene∣my
who were posted on that Side, and mastering
them before they could be relieved, cut them all
to Pieces and brought me off. Under the Shelter
of this Party, we made good our Retreat to the
Village, but we lost above 300 Men, and were
glad to make off from the Village too, for the
Enemy were very much too strong for us.</P>
<P>Returning thence towards the Camp, we fell
foul with 200 <HI>Crabats</HI> who had been upon the
plundering Account: We made our selves some
Amends upon them for our former Loss, for we
shew'd them no Mercy; but our Misfortunes were
not ended, for we had but just dispatch'd those
<HI>Crabats</HI> when we fell in with 3000 <HI>Imperial</HI> Horse,
who, on the Expectation of the aforesaid Convoy,
were sent out to secure them.</P>
<P>All I could do, could not persuade my Men
to stand their Ground against this Party; so that
finding they would run away in Confusion, I a∣greed
to make off, and facing to the Right, we
went over a large Common a full Trot, 'till at last
Fear, which always encreases in a Flight, brought
us to a plain Flight, the Enemy at our Heels.
I must confess I was never so mortified in my
Life; 'twas to no Purpose to turn Head, no Man
<PB N="126" REF="132"/>
would stand by us, we run for Life, and a great
many we left by the Way who were either wound∣ed
by the Enemy's Shot, or else could not keep
Race with us.</P>
<P>At last having got over the Common, which
was near two Miles, we came to a Lane; one
of our Captains, a <HI>Saxon</HI> by Country, and a Gen∣tleman
of a good Fortune alighted at the Entrance
of the Lane, and with a bold Heart faced about,
shot his own Horse, and called his Men to stand
by him and defend the Lane. Some of his Men
halted, and we rallied about 600 Men which
we posted as well as we could, to defend the
Pass; but the Enemy charged us with great Fury.
The <HI>Saxon</HI> Gentleman, after defending himself
with exceeding Gallantry and refusing Quarter,
was killed upon the Spot: A <HI>German</HI> Dragoon
as I thought him, gave me a rude Blow with the
Stock of his Piece on the Side of my Head, and
was just going to repeat it, when one of my Men
shot him dead. I was so stunn'd with the Blow,
that I knew nothing; but recovering, I found my
self in the Hands of two of the Enemy's Officers,
who offered me Quarter, which I accepted; and
indeed, to give them their due, they used me ve∣ry
civilly. Thus this whole Party was defeated,
and not above 500 Men got safe to the Army, nor
had half the Number escaped, had not the <HI>Saxon</HI>
Captain made so bold a Stand at the Head of
the Lane.</P>
<P>Several other Parties of the King's Army re∣venged
our Quarrel, and paid them home for it;
but I had a particular Loss in this Defeat, that I
never saw the King after; for tho' his Majesty
sent a Trumpet to reclaim us as Prisoners the
very next Day, yet I was not delivered, some Scru∣ple
happening about exchanging, 'till after the
<PB N="127" REF="133"/>
Battle of <HI>Lutzen,</HI> where that Gallant Prince lost
his Life.</P>
<P>The Imperial Army rise from their Camp about
eight or ten Days after the King had removed,
and I was carried Prisoner in the Army 'till they
sat down to the Siege of <HI>Coburgh Castle,</HI> and then
was left with other Prisoners of War, in the Cu∣stody
of Collonel <HI>Spezuter,</HI> in a small Castle near
the Camp called <HI>Newstad.</HI> Here we continued
indifferent well treated, but could learn nothing
of what Action the Armies were upon, 'till the
Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> having been beaten off from the
Castle of <HI>Coburgh,</HI> marched into <HI>Saxony,</HI> and the
Prisoners were sent for into the Camp, as was said,
in order to be exchanged.</P>
<P>I came into the Imperial Leager at the Siege
of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> and within three Days after my com∣ing,
the City was surrendred, and I got Liberty
to lodge at my old Quarters in the Town upon
my Parole.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> was at the Heels of the <HI>Im∣perialists;</HI>
for finding <HI>Wallestein</HI> resolved to ruin
the Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> the King had recollected as
much of his divided Army as he could, and came
upon him just as he was going to besiege <HI>Torgau.</HI></P>
<P>As it it is not my Design to write a History of
any more of these Wars than I was actually con∣cerned
in, so I shall only note, that upon the
King's Approach, <HI>Wallestein</HI> halted, and likewife
called all his Troops together; for he apprehend∣ed
the King would fall on him; and we that were
Prisoners, fancied the <HI>Imperial</HI> Soldiers went un∣willingly
out; for the very Name of the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> was become terrible to them. In
short, they drew all the Soldiers of the Garri∣son
they could spare, out of <HI>Leipsick,</HI> sent for <HI>Pa∣penheim</HI>
again, who was gone but three Days
<PB N="128" REF="134"/>
fore with 6000 Men on a private Expedition. On
the 16th of <HI>November,</HI> the Armies met on the
Plains of <HI>Lutzen;</HI> a long and bloody Battle was
fought; the <HI>Imperialists</HI> were entirely routed and
beaten, 12000 slain upon the Spot, their Cannon,
Baggage and 2000 Prisoners taken, but the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> lost his Life, being killed at the Head of
his Troops in the Begining of the Fight.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe the Consternation the
Death of this conquering King struck into all the
Princes of <HI>Germany;</HI> the Grief for him exceeded
all Manner of human Sorrow: All People looked
upon themselves as ruined and swallowed up; the
Inhabitants of two Thirds of all <HI>Germany</HI> put them∣selves
into Mourning for him; when the Mini∣sters
mentioned him in their Sermons or Prayers,
whole Congregations would burst out into Tears:
The Elector of <HI>Saxony</HI> was utterly inconsolable,
and would for several Days walk about his Pa∣lace
like a distracted Man, crying the Saviour of
<HI>Germany</HI> was lost, the Refuge of abused Princes
was gone; the Soul of the War was dead, and
from that Hour was so hopeless of out-living the
War, that he sought to make Peace with the Em∣peror.</P>
<P>Three Days after this mournful Victory, the
<HI>Saxons</HI> recovered the Town of <HI>Leipsick</HI> by Strata∣gem.
The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI>'s Forces lay at <HI>Torgau,</HI>
and perceiving the Confusion the <HI>Imperialists</HI> were
in at the News of the Overthrow of their Army,
they resolved to attempt the Recovery of the
Town. They sent about 20 scattering Troopers who
pretending themselves to be <HI>Imperalists</HI> fled from
the Battle, were let in one by one, and still as
they came in, they staid at the Court of Guard in
the Port, entertaining the Souldiers with Dis∣course
about the Fight, and how they escaped, and
<PB N="129" REF="135"/>
the like; 'till the whole Number being got in at
a Watch Word, they fell on the Guard, and cut
them all in Pieces; and immediately opening the
Gate to three Troops of <HI>Saxon</HI> Horse, the Town
was taken in a Moment.</P>
<P>It was a welcome Surprise to me, for I was
at Liberty of Course; and the War being now
on another Foot, as I thought, and the King dead,
I resolved to quit the Service.</P>
<P>I had sent my Man, as I have already noted in∣to
<HI>England,</HI> in Order to bring over the Troops
my Father had raised for the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI>
He executed his Commission so well, that he
landed with five Troops at <HI>Embden,</HI> in very good
Condition; and Orders were sent them by the
King, to join the Duke of <HI>Lunenberg</HI>'s Army;
which they did at the Siege of <HI>Boxtude,</HI> in the
Lower <HI>Saxony.</HI> Here by long and very sharp Ser∣vice
they were most of them cut off, and though
they were several Times recruited, yet I under∣stood
there were not three full Troops left.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxe-Weymar,</HI> a Gentleman of
great Courage, had the Command of the Army
after the King's Death, and managed it with so
much Prudence, that all things were in as much
Order as could be expected, after so great a Loss;
for the <HI>Imperialists</HI> where every where beaten, and
<HI>Wallestein</HI> never made any Advantage of the King's
Death.</P>
<P>I waited on him at <HI>Hailbron,</HI> whither he was
gone to meet the great Chancellor of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
where I paid him my Respects, and desired he
would bestow the Remainder of my Regiment
on my Comerade the Captain, which he did with
all the Civility and Readiness imaginable: So I took
my Leave of him, and prepared to come for
<HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="136"/>
I shall only note this, that at this Dyet, the Pro∣testant
Princes of the Empire renewed their League
with one another, and with the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and came to several Regulations and Conclusions
for the carrying on the War; which they after∣wards
prosecuted under the Direction of the
said Chancellor of <HI>Sweden.</HI> But it was not the
Work of a small Difficulty, nor of a short Time;
and having been perswaded to continue almost
two Years afterwards at <HI>Frankfort, Hailbron,</HI> and
thereabout, by the particular Friendship of that
noble wise Man, and extraordinary Statesman
<HI>Axell Oxenstern,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Sweden,</HI> I had Oppor∣tunity
to be concerned in, and present at several
Treaties of extraordinary Consequence, sufficient
for a History, if that were my Design.</P>
<P>Particularly I had the Happiness to be present
at, and have some Concern in the Treaty for the
restoring the Posterity of the truly noble <HI>Pals∣grave</HI>
King of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> King <HI>James</HI> of <HI>England</HI>
had indeed too much neglected the whole Family;
and I may say with Authority enough, from my
own Knowledge of Affairs, had nothing been done
for them but what was from <HI>England,</HI> that Fami∣ly
had remained desolate and forsaken to this Day.</P>
<P>But that glorious King, whom I can never
mention without some Remark of his extraordina∣ry
Merit, had left particular Inftructions with
his Chancellor to rescue the <HI>Palatinate</HI> to its right∣ful
Lord, as a Proof of his Design to restore the
the Liberty of <HI>Germany,</HI> and reinstate the oppres∣sed
Princes who were subjected to the Tyranny of
the House of <HI>Austria.</HI></P>
<P>Pursuant to this Resolution, the Chancellor
proceeded very much like a Man of Honour;
and tho' the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was dead a little
<PB N="131" REF="137"/>
before, yet he carefully managed the Trea∣ty,
answered the Objections of several Prin∣ces,
who, in the general Ruin of the Family, had
reaped private Advantages, settled the Capitu∣lations
for the Quota of Contributions, very
much for their Advantage, and fully reinstalled
the Prince <HI>Charles</HI> in the Possession of all his Do∣minions
in the <HI>Lower Palatinate,</HI> which afterwards
was confirmed to him and his Posterity by the
Peace of <HI>West-Phalia,</HI> where all these bloody Wars
were finished in a Peace, which has since been the
Foundation of the <HI>Protestants</HI> Liberty, and the best
Security of the whole Empire.</P>
<P>I spent two Years rather in wandring up and
down, than travelling; for tho' I had no Mind to
serve, yet I could not find in my Heart to leave
<HI>Germany;</HI> and I had obtained some so very close
Intimacies with the General Officers, that I was
often in the Army, and sometimes they did me
the Honour to bring me into their Councils
of War.</P>
<P>Particularly, at that eminent Council before
the Battle of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> I was invited to the
Council of War, both by Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> of <HI>Wey∣mar,</HI>
and by <HI>Gustavus Horne.</HI> They were Gene∣rals
of equal Worth, and their Courage and Ex∣perience
had been so well, and so often tried,
that more than ordinary Regard was always given
to what they said. Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> was indeed
the younger Man, and <HI>Gustvaus</HI> had served longer
under our Great Schoolmaster the King; but
'twas hard to judge which was the better Gene∣ral,
since both had Experience enough, and shewn
undeniable Proofs both of their Bravery and
Conduct.</P>
<P>I am obliged, in the Course of my Relation,
so often to mention the great Respect I often re∣ceived
<PB N="132" REF="138"/>
from these great Men, that it makes me
sometimes jealous, least the Reader may think
I affect it as a Vanity. The Truth is, and I am
ready to confess the Honours I received, upon all
Occasions, from Persons of such Worth, and
who had such an eminent Share in the greatest
Action of that Age, very much pleased me;
and particularly, as they gave me Occasions to
see every thing that was doing on the whole
Stage of the War: For being under no Com∣mand,
but at Liberty to rove about, I could come
to no <HI>Swedish</HI> Garrison or Party, but sending my
Name to the commanding Officer I could have
<HI>the Word</HI> sent me; and if I came into the Army,
I was often treated as I was now at this famous
Battle of <HI>Nordlingen.</HI></P>
<P>But I cannot but say, that I always looked
upon this particular Respect to be the Effect
of more than ordinary Regard the great King
of <HI>Sweden</HI> always shewed me, rather than any
Merit of my own; and the Veneration they all
had for his Memory, made them continue to
shew me all the Marks of a suitable Esteem.</P>
<P>But to return to the Council of War, the great,
and indeed the only Question before us was, shall
we give Battle to the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> or not? <HI>Gustavus
Horn</HI> was against it, and gave, as I thought, the
most invincible Arguments against a Battle that
Reason could imagine.</P>
<P>First, They were weaker than the Enemy by
above 5000 Men.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Cardinal Infant of <HI>Spain,</HI> who
was in the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army with 8000 Men, was
but there <HI>en Passant,</HI> being going from <HI>Italy</HI> to
<HI>Flanders,</HI> to take upon him the Government of the
<HI>Low Countries;</HI> and if he saw no Prospect of im∣mediate
Action, would be gone in a few Days.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="139"/>
Thirdly, They had two Reinforcements, one
of 5000 Men, under the Command of Collonel
<HI>Cratz,</HI> and one of 7000 Men under the Rhinegrave,
who were just at Hand, the last within three
Days March of them: And</P>
<P>Lastly, They had already saved their Honour,
in that they had put 600 Foot into the Town
of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> in the Face of the Enemy's Army
and consequently the Town might hold out some
Days the longer.</P>
<P>Fate rather than Reason certainly blinded the
rest of the Generals against such Arguments as
these. Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> and almost all the Generals
were for Fighting, alledging, the Affront it would
be to the <HI>Swedish</HI> Reputation, to see their Friends
in the Town lost before their Faces.</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> stood stiff to his cautious Advice,
and was against it; and I thought the Baron <HI>D'Off∣kirk</HI>
treated him a little indecently; for being
very warm in the Matter, he told them; <HI>That if</HI>
Gustavus Adolphus <HI>had been governed by such cow∣ardly
Council, he had never been Conqueror of half</HI> Ger∣many
<HI>in two Years. No,</HI> replied old General <HI>Horn,</HI>
very smartly, <HI>But he had been now alive to have
testified for me, that I was never taken by him for a
Coward; and yet</HI> says he, <HI>the King was never for a
Victory with a Hazard, when he could have it without.</HI></P>
<P>I was asked my Opinion, which I would have
declined, being in no Commission; but they
pressed me to speak. I told them, I was for
staying at least till the Rhinegrave came up; who
at least might, if Expresses were sent to hasten
him, be up with us in 24 Hours. But <HI>Offkirk</HI>
could not hold his Passion, and had not he been
over-rul'd, he would have almost quarrelled with
Marshal <HI>Horn.</HI> Upon which the old General, not
<PB N="134" REF="140"/>
to foment him, with a great deal of Mildness
stood up, and spoke thus.</P>
<P><HI>Come,</HI> Offkirk, says he, <HI>I'll submit my Opinion to
you and the Majority of our Fellow-Soldiers: We will
fight, but upon my Word we shall have our Hands full.</HI></P>
<P>The Resolution thus taken, they attacked the
<HI>Imperial</HI> Army. I must confess the Councils of
this Day seemed as confused as the Resolutions
of the Night.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Bernard</HI> was to lead the Van of the Left
Wing, and to post himself upon a Hill which was
on the Enemy's Right without their Entrench∣ments;
so that having secured that Post, they
might level their Cannon upon the Foot who
stood behind the Lines, and relieved the Town
at Pleasure. He marched accordingly by Break
of Day, and falling with great Fury upon 8 Re∣giments
of Foot which were posted at the Foot
of the Hill, he presently routed them and made
himself Master of the Post. Flushed with this Suc∣cess,
he never regards his own concerted Mea∣sures
of stopping there, and possessing what he
had got, but pushes on and falls in with the
Main Body of the Enemy's Army.</P>
<P>While this was doing, <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> attacks
another Post on a Hill, were the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had
posted and lodged themselves behind some Works
they had cast up on the side of the Hill; here
they defended themselves with extreme Ob∣stinacy
for five Hours, and at last obliged the
<HI>Swedes</HI> to give it over with Loss. This extraor∣dinary
Gallantry of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> was the saving
of the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army; for Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> having
all this while resisted the frequent Charges of
the <HI>Imperialists,</HI> and borne the Weight of two
<PB N="135" REF="141"/>
Thirds of their Army, was not able to stand any
longer, but sending one Messenger in the Neck
of another to <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> for more Foot, he
finding he could not carry his Point, had given
it over, and was in full March to second the
Duke. But now 'twas too late; for the King of
<HI>Hungary</HI> seeing the Duke's Men as it were wave∣ring,
and having Notice of <HI>Horn</HI>'s wheeling about
to second him, falls in with all his Force upon
his Flank, and with his <HI>Hungarian</HI> Hussars, made
such a furious Charge, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> could
stand no longer.</P>
<P>The Rout of the Left Wing was so much the
more unhappy, as it happened just upon <HI>Gustavus
Horn</HI>'s coming up; for being pushed on with the
Enemies at their Heels, they were driven upon
their own Friends, who having no Ground, to
open, and give them way, were trodden down
by their own run-away Brethren. This brought
all into the utmost Confusion. The <HI>Imperialists</HI>
cried <HI>Victoria,</HI> and fell into the Middle of the In∣fantry
with a terrible Slaughter.</P>
<P>I have always observed, 'tis fatal to upbraid
an old experienced Officer with want of Cou∣rage.
If <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> had not been whetted with
the Reproaches of the Baron <HI>D' Offkirk,</HI> and some
of the other General Officers, I believe it had
saved the Lives of a 1000 Men; for when all was
thus lost, several Officers advised him to make
a Retreat with such Regiments as he had yet un∣broken;
but nothing could perswade him to
stir a Foot: But turning his Flank into a Front,
he saluted the Enemy as they pass'd by him in
Pursuit of the rest, with such terrible Volleys of
small Shot, as cost them the Lives of Abundance of
their Men.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="142"/>
The <HI>Imperialists,</HI> eager in the Pursuit, left him
unbroken, till the <HI>Spanish</HI> Brigade came up and
charged him: These he bravely repulsed with
a great Slaughter, and after them a Body of
Dragoons; till being laid at on every Side, and
most of his Men killed, the brave old General,
with all the rest who were left, were made Pri∣soners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedes</HI> had a terrible Loss here; for almost
all their Infantry were killed or taken Prisoners.
<HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> refused Quarter several times; and
still those that attacked him were cut down by
his Men, who fought like Furies, and by the
Example of their General, behaved themselves
like Lions. But at last, these poor Remains
of a Body of the bravest Men in the World were
forced to submit. I have heard him say, he had
much rather have died than been taken, but
that he yeilded in Compassion to so many brave
Men as were about him; for none of them would
take Quarter till he gave his Consent.</P>
<P>I had the worst Share in this Battle that ever
I had in any Action of my Life; and that was
to be posted among as brave a Body of Horse as
any in <HI>Germany,</HI> and yet not be able to succour
our own Men; but our Foot were cut in Pieces
(as it were) before our Faces; and the Situation
of the Ground was such as we could not fall in.
All that we were able to do, was to carry off about
2000 of the Foot, who running away in the Rout
of the Left Wing, rallied among our Squadrons,
and got away with us. Thus we stood till we saw
all was lost, and then made the best Retreat we
could to save our selves, several Regiments ha∣ving
never charged, nor fired a Shot; for the
Foot had so embarassed themselves among the
Lines and Works of the Enemy, and in the Vine∣yards
<PB N="137" REF="143"/>
and Mountains, that the Horse were ren∣dered
absolutely unserviceable.</P>
<P>The Rhinegrave had made such Expedition
to join us, that he reached within three Miles
of the Place of Action that Night, and he was a
great Saseguard for us in rallying our dispersed
Men, who else had fallen into the Enemy's
Hands, and in checking the Pursuit of the
Enemy.</P>
<P>And indeed, had but any considerable Body
of the Foot made an orderly Retreat, it had been
very probable they had given the Enemy a Brush
that would have turned the Scale of Victory;
for our Horse being whole, and in a manner un∣touched,
the Enemy found such a Check in the
Pursuit, that 1600 of their forwardest Men fol∣lowing
too eagerly, fell in with the Rhinegrave's
advanced Troops the next Day, and were cut in
Pieces without Mercy.</P>
<P>This gave us some Satisfaction for the Loss, but
it was but small compared to the Ruin of that
Day. We lost near 8000 Men upon the Spot,
and above 3000 Prisoners, all our Cannon and
Baggage, and 120 Colours. I thought I never
made so indifferent a Figure in my Life, and so we
thought all; to come away, lose our Infantry, our
General, and our Honour, and never fight for
it. Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> was utterly disconsolate for
old <HI>Gustavus Horn;</HI> for he concluded him killed;
he tore the Hair from his Head like a mad Man,
and telling the Rhinegrave the Story of the
Council of War, would reproach himself with
not taking his Advice, often repeating it in his
Passion, 'Tis <HI>I,</HI> said he, <HI>have been the Death of the
bravest General</HI> in Germany; would call himself
Fool and Boy, and such Names, for not liftening
to the Reasons of an old experienced Soldier. But
<PB N="138" REF="144"/>
when he heard he was alive in the Enemy's
Hands, he was the easier, and applied himself to
the recruting his Troops, and the like Business
of the War; and it was not long before he paid
the <HI>Imperialists</HI> with Interest.</P>
<P>I returned to <HI>Frankfort au Main</HI> after this
Action, which happened the 17th of <HI>August</HI> 1634;
but the Progress of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> was so great,
that there was no staying at <HI>Frankfort.</HI> The
Chancellor <HI>Oxenstern</HI> removed to <HI>Magdeburg,</HI>
Duke <HI>Barnard</HI> and the Landgrave marched into
<HI>Alsatia,</HI> and the <HI>Imperialists</HI> carried all before
them, for all the rest of the Campaign: They
took <HI>Philipsburgh</HI> by Surprize; they took <HI>Ausburgh</HI>
by Famine, <HI>Spire</HI> and <HI>Treves</HI> by Sieges, taking
the Elector Prisoner. But this Success did one
Piece of Service to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> that it brought the
<HI>French</HI> into the War on their Side; for the Ele∣ctor
of <HI>Treves</HI> was their Confederate. The <HI>French</HI>
gave the Conduct of the War to Duke <HI>Barnard.</HI>
This, though the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> fell off, and
fought against them, turned the Scale so much in
their Favour, that they recovered their Losses,
and proved a Terror to all <HI>Germany.</HI> The farther
Accounts of the War I refer to the Histories of
those Times, which I have since read with a
great deal of Delight.</P>
<P>I confess, when I saw the Progress of the <HI>Imperial</HI>
Army after the Battle of <HI>Nordlingen,</HI> and the
Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> turning his Arms against them,
I thought their Affairs declining; and giving
them over for lost, I left <HI>Frankfort,</HI> and came
down the Rhine to <HI>Cologn,</HI> and from thence into
<HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>I came to the <HI>Hague</HI> the 8th of <HI>March</HI> 1635,
having spent three Years and a half in <HI>Germany</HI>
and the greatest Part of it in the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="145"/>
I spent some Time in <HI>Holland</HI> viewing the won∣derful
Power of Art which I observed in the For∣tifications
of their Towns, where the very
Bastions stand on bottomless Morasses, and yet
are as firm as any in the World. There I had
the Opportunity to see the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army, and their
famous General Prince <HI>Maurice.</HI> 'Tis true, the
Men behaved themselves well enough in Action,
when they were put to it, but the Prince's
way of beating his Enemies without Fighting,
was so unlike the Gallantry of my Royal In∣structer,
that it had no manner of Relish with
me. Our way in <HI>Germany</HI> was always to seek
out the Enemy and fight him; and, give the <HI>Impe∣rialists</HI>
their due, they were seldom hard to be
found, but were as free of their Flesh as we
were.</P>
<P>Whereas Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> would lye in a Camp
till he starved half his Men, if by lying there he
could but starve two Thirds of his Enemies; so
that indeed the War in <HI>Holland</HI> had more of
Fatigues and Hardships in it, and ours had
more of Fighting and Blows: Hasty Marches,
long and unwholesome Encampments, Winter
Parties, Counter-marching, Dodging, and En∣trenching,
were the Excercises of his Men, and
often times killed him more Men with Hunger,
Cold, and Diseases, than he could do with Fight∣ing:
Not that it required less Courage, but rather
more; for a Soldier had at any time rather die
in the Field <HI>a la Coup de Mousquet,</HI> than be star∣ved
with Hunger, or frozen to Death in the
Trenches.</P>
<P>Nor do I think I lessen the Reputation of that
Great General; for tis most certain he ruined
the <HI>Spaniard</HI> more by spinning the War thus out
in Length, than he could possibly have done by
<PB N="140" REF="146"/>
a swift Conquest: For had he, <HI>Gustavus</HI> like,
with a Torrent of Victory dislodged the <HI>Spaniard</HI>
of all the 12 Provinces in 5 Years, whereas he
was 40 Years, a beating them out of 7, he had
left them rich and strong at Home, and able
to keep them in constant Apprehensions of a
Return of his Power: Whereas, by the long
Continuance of the War, he so broke the very
Heart of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy, so absolutely and
irrecoverably impoverished them, that they have
ever since languished of the Disease, till they
are fallen from the most powerful, to be the most
despicable Nation in the World.</P>
<P>The prodigious Charge the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was
at in losing the Seven Provinces, broke the very
Spirit of the Nation; and that so much, that all
the Wealth of their <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mountains have not
been able to retrieve it; King <HI>Philip</HI> having of∣ten
declared, that War, besides his Armada for
invading <HI>England,</HI> had cost him 370 Millions
of Ducats, and 4000000 of the best Soldiers
in <HI>Europe;</HI> whereof, by an unreasonable <HI>Spanish</HI>
Obstinacy, above Sixty Thousand lost their Lives
before <HI>Ostend,</HI> a Town not worth a sixth Part,
either of the Blood or Money it cost in a Siege
of three Years; and which at last he had never
taken, but that Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> thought it not
worth the Charge of defending it any longer.</P>
<P>However, I say, their Way of fighting in <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
did not relish with me at all. The Prince
lay a long time before a little Fort called <HI>Shenk∣scans,</HI>
which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> took by Surprize, and
I thought he might have taken it much sooner.
Perhaps it might be my Mistake; but I fancied
my Heroe, the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> would have carried
it Sword in Hand, in Half the Time.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="147"/>
However it was, I did not like it; so in the
latter End of the Year I came to the <HI>Hague,</HI> and
took Shipping for <HI>England,</HI> where I arrived, to
the great Satisfaction of my Father and all my
Friends.</P>
<P>My Father was then in <HI>London,</HI> and carried
me to kiss the King's Hand. His Majesty was
pleased to received me very well, and to say a
great many very obliging things to my Father
upon my Account.</P>
<P>I spent my Time very retired from Court, for
I was almost wholly in the Country; and it be∣ing
so much different from my Genius, which
hankered after a warmer Sport than Hunting
among our <HI>Welch</HI> Mountains, I could not but be
peeping in all the foreign Accounts from <HI>Germany,</HI>
to see who and who was together. There I could
never hear of a Battle, and the <HI>Germans</HI> being
beaten, but I began to wish my self there. But
when an Account came of the Progress of <HI>John Ban∣nier,</HI>
the <HI>Swedish</HI> General in <HI>Saxony,</HI> and of the con∣stant
Victories he had there over the <HI>Saxons,</HI> I could
no longer contain my self, but told my Father
this Life was very disagreeable to me; that I lost
my Time here, and might to much more
Advantage go into <HI>Germany,</HI> where I was sure I
might make my Fortune upon my own
Terms: That, as young as I was, I might have
been a General Officer by this Time, if I had not
laid down my Commission: That General <HI>Ban∣nier,</HI>
or the Marshal <HI>Horn,</HI> had either of them so
much Respect for me, that I was sure I might
have any thing of them: And that if he pleased
to give me Leave, I would go for <HI>Germany</HI> again.
My Father was very unwilling to let me go, but
seeing me uneasy, told me, that if I was resolv'd,
<PB N="142" REF="148"/>
he would oblige me to stay no longer in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
than the next Spring, and I should have his
Consent.</P>
<P>The Winter following began to look very un∣pleasant
upon us in <HI>England,</HI> and my Father used
often to sigh at it; and would tell me sometimes,
he was afraid we should have no need to send
<HI>Englishmen</HI> to fight in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The Cloud that seemed to threaten most was
from <HI>Scotland.</HI> My Father, who had made him∣self
Master of the Arguments on both Sides,
used to be often saying, he feared there was some
about the King who exasperated him too much
against the <HI>Scots,</HI> and drove things too high.
For my part, I confess I did not much trouble
my Head with the Cause; but all my Fear was,
they would not fall out, and we should have no
Fighting. I have often reflected since, that I
ought to have known better, that had seen how
the most flourishing Provinces of <HI>Germany</HI> were
reduced to the most miserable Condition that
ever any Country in the World was, by the
Ravagings of Soldiers, and the Calamities of
War.</P>
<P>How much soever I was to blame, yet so it
was, I had a secret Joy at the News of the
King's raising an Army, and nothing could have
with-held me from appearing in it; but my
Eagerness was anticipated by an Express the
King sent to my Father, to know if his Son was
in <HI>England;</HI> and my Father having ordered me
to carry the Answer my self, I waited upon his
Majesty with the Messenger. The King received
me with his usual Kindness, and asked me if I
was willing to serve him against the <HI>Scots?</HI></P>
<P>I answered, I was ready to serve him against
any that his Majesty thought fit to account his
<PB N="143" REF="149"/>
Enemies, and should count it an Honour to re∣ceive
his Commands. Hereupon his Majesty of∣fered
me a Commission. I told him, I supposed
there would not be much Time for raising of
Men; that if his Majesty pleased I would be
at the Rendezvous with as many Gentlemen
as I could get together, to serve his Majesty as
Voluntiers.</P>
<P>The Truth is, I found all the Regiments of
Horse the King designed to raise, were but two,
as Regiments; the rest of the Horse were such
as the Nobility raised in their several Counties,
and commanded them themselves; and, as I had
commanded a Regiment of Horse abroad, it look∣ed
a little odd to serve with a single Troop at
home; and the King took the thing presently. <HI>In∣deed
'twill be a Voluntier War,</HI> said the King, <HI>for the
Northern Gentry have sent me an Account of above
4000 Horse they have already.</HI> I bowed, and told
his Majesty I was glad to hear his Subjects were
so forward to serve him; so taking his Majesty's
Orders to be at <HI>York</HI> by the End of <HI>March,</HI> I re∣turned
to my Father.</P>
<P>My Father was very glad I had not taken a
Commission, for I know not from what kind of
Emulation between the Western and Northern
Gentry. The Gentlemen of our Side were not
very forward in the Service; their Loyalty to
the King in the succeeding Times made it ap∣pear
it was not from any Disaffection to his Ma∣jesty's
Interest or Person, or to the Cause; but
this however made it difficult for me when I
came home, to get any Gentleman of Quality to
serve with me, so that I presented my self to
his Majesty only as a Voluntier, with eight Gen∣tlemen,
and about 36 Countrymen well mounted
and armed.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="150"/>
And as it proved, these were enough, for this
Expedition ended in an Accomodation with the
<HI>Scots;</HI> and they not advancing so much as to
their own Borders, we never came to any Acti∣on;
but the Armies lay in the Counties of
<HI>Northumberland</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> eat up the Country,
and spent the King a vast Sum of Money, and
so this War ended, a Pacification was made, and
both Sides returned.</P>
<P>The Truth is, I never saw such a despicable
Appearance of Men in Arms to begin a War, in
my Life; whether it was that I had seen so
many braver Armies abroad that prejudiced me
against them, or that it really was so; for to
me they seemed little better than a Rabble met
together to devour, rather than fight for their
King and Country. There was indeed a great
Appearance of Gentlemen, and those of extraor∣dinary
Quality; but their Garb, their Equipages,
and their Mein, did not look like War; their
Troops were filled with Footmen and Servants,
and wretchedly armed, God wot. I believe I
might say, without Vanity, one Regiment of <HI>Fin∣land</HI>
Horse would have made Sport at beating them
all. There were such Crouds of Parsons, (for this
was a Church War in particular) that the Camp
and Court was full of them; and the King was
so eternally besieged with Clergymen of one sort
or another, that it gave Offence to the chief of
the Nobility.</P>
<P>As was the Appearance, so was the Service;
the Army marched to the Borders, and the Head
Quarter was at <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed;</HI> but the <HI>Scots</HI>
never appeared, no, not so much as their Scouts;
whereupon the King called a Council of War,
and there it was resolved to send the Earl of
<HI>Holland</HI> with a Party of Horse into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to
<PB N="145" REF="151"/>
learn some News of the Enemy; and truly the
first News he brought us was, that finding their
Army encamped about <HI>Coldingham,</HI> 15 Miles from
<HI>Berwick,</HI> as soon as he appeared, the <HI>Scots</HI> drew
Out a Party to charge him, upon which most of
his Men halted, I don't lay run away, but 'twas
next Door to it; for they could not be perswa∣ded
to fire their Pistols, and wheel off like Sol∣diers,
but retreated in such a disorderly and
shameful Manner, that had the Enemy but had
either the Courage or Conduct to have followed
them, it must have certainly ended in the Ruin
of the whole Party.</P>

<HEAD>THE
SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Confess, when I went into Arms at the
Begining of this War, I never troubled
my self to examine Sides: I was glad
to hear the Drums beat for Soldiers;
as if I had been a meer <HI>Swiss,</HI> that had not
car'd which Side went up or down, so I had my
Pay. I went as eagerly and blindly about my
Business, as the meanest Wretch that listed in the
Army; nor had I the least compassionate Thought
for the Miseries of my native Country, 'till after
the Fight at <HI>Edgehill.</HI> I had known as much, and
perhaps more than most in the Army, what it
was to have an Enemy ranging in the Bowels of a
Kingdom; I had seen the most flourishing Pro∣vinces
of <HI>Germany</HI> reduced to perfect Desarts, and
the voracious <HI>Crabats,</HI> with inhuman Barbarity,
quenching the Fires of the plundered Villages
with the Blood of the Inhabitants. Whether
this had hardened me against the natural Tender∣ness
which I afterwards found return upon me,
or not, I cannot tell; but I reflected upon my
self afterwards with a great deal of Trouble, for
the Unconcernedness of my Temper at the ap∣proaching
Ruin of my native Country.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="153"/>
I was in the first Army at <HI>York,</HI> as I have al∣ready
noted, and I must confess, had the least
Diversion there that ever I found in an Army in
my Life; for when I was in <HI>Germany</HI> with the
King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> we used to see the King with the
General Officers every Morning on Horseback,
viewing his Men, his Artillery, his Horses, and
always something going forward: Here we saw
nothing but Courtiers and Clergymen, Bishops and
Parsons, as busy as if the Direction of the War had
been in them; the King was seldom seen among us,
and never without some of them always about him.</P>
<P>Those few of us that had seen the Wars, and
would have made a short End of this for him,
began to be very uneasy; and particularly a cer∣tain
Nobleman took the Freedom to tell the
King, that the Clergy would certainly ruin the Ex∣pedition;
<HI>the Case was this</HI> he would ha' had the King
have immediately marched into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and put
the Matter to the Trial of a Battle; and he urged it
every Day; and the King finding his Reasons
very good, would often be of his Opinion; but
next Morning he would be of another Mind.</P>
<P>This Gentleman was a Man of Conduct enough,
and of unquestioned Courage, and afterwards lost
his Life for the King. He saw we had an Army
of young stout Fellows, numerous enough; and
tho' they had not yet seen much Service, he was
for bringing them to Action, that the <HI>Scots</HI> might
not have time to strengthen themselves; nor they
have time by Idleness and Sotting, <HI>the Bane of
Soldiers,</HI> to make themselves unfit for any thing.</P>
<P>I was one Morning in Company with this Gen∣tleman;
and as he was a warm Man, and eager
in his Discourse, a Pox of these Priests, says he,
'tis for them the King has raised this Army, and
<PB N="148" REF="154"/>
put his Friends to a vast Charge; and now we
are come, they won't let us fight.</P>
<P>But I was afterwards convinced, the Clergy
saw farther into the Matter than we did; they
saw the <HI>Scots</HI> had a better Army than we had;
bold and ready, commanded by brave Officers;
and they foresaw, that if we fought, we should
be beaten, and if beaten, they were undone. And
'twas very true, we had all been ruined, if we
had engaged.</P>
<P>It is true, when we came to the Pacification which
followed, I confess I was of the same Mind the Gen∣tleman
had been of; for we had better have fought,
and been beaten, than have made so dishonoura∣ble
a Treaty, without striking a Stroke. This
Pacification seems to me to have laid the Scheme
of all the Blood and Confusion which followed in
the Civil War; for whatever the King and his
Friends might pretend to do by talking big, the <HI>Scots</HI>
saw he was to be bullied into any thing, and that
when it came to the Push, the Courtiers never
cared to bring it to Blows.</P>
<P>I have little or nothing, to say as to Action, in
this Mock-Expedition. The King was perswaded
at last to march to <HI>Berwick;</HI> and as I have said al∣ready,
a Party of Horse went out to learn News
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and as soon as they saw them, run
away from them, bravely.</P>
<P>This made the <HI>Scots</HI> so insolent, that whereas
before they lay encamped behind a River, and
never shewed themselves, in a sort of modest
Deference to their King, which was the Pretence
of not being Aggressors or Invaders, only arming
in their own Defence; now, having been inva∣ded
by the <HI>English</HI> Troops entring <HI>Scotland,</HI> they
had what they wanted: And to shew it was not
Fear that restrained them before, but Policy, now
<PB N="149" REF="155"/>
they came up in Parties to our very Gates, bra∣ving,
and facing us every Day.</P>
<P>I had, with more Curiosity than Discretion,
put my self as a Voluntier at the Head of one of
our Parties of Horse, under my Lord <HI>Holland,</HI> when
they went out to discover the Enemy; they went,
they said, to see what the <HI>Scots</HI> were a-doing.</P>
<P>We had not marched far, but our Scouts
brought Word, they had discovered some Horse,
but could not come up to them, because a River
parted them. At the Heels of these came another
Party of our Men upon the Spur to us, and said
the Enemy was behind, which might be true,
for ought we knew; but it was so far behind,
that no Body could see them; and yet the Coun∣try
was plain and open for above a Mile before us:
Hereupon we made a Halt, and indeed I was a∣fraid
'twould have been an odd Sort of a Halt;
for our Men began to look one upon another,
as they do in like Cases, when they are go∣ing
to break; and when the Scouts came gallo∣ping
in, the Men were in such Disorder, that had
but one Man broke way, I am satisfied they had
all run for it.</P>
<P>I found my Lord <HI>Holland</HI> did not perceive it;
but after the first Surprize was a little over, I told
my Lord what I had observed; and that unless
some Course was immediately taken, they would
all run at the first Sight of the Enemy. I found
he was much concerned at it, and began to consult
what Course to take, to prevent it. I confess 'tis
a hard Question, how to make Men stand and face
an Enemy, when Fear has possessed their Minds
with an Inclination to run away: But I'll give
that Honour to the Memory of that noble Gen∣tleman,
who tho' his Experience in Matters of
War was small, having never been in much Ser∣vice;
<PB N="150" REF="156"/>
yet his Courage made amends for it; for
I dare say he would not have turned his Horse
from an Army of Enemies, nor have saved his
Life at the Price of running away for it.</P>
<P>My Lord soon saw, as well as I, the Fright the
Men were in, after I had given him a Hint of it;
and to encourage them, rode thro' their Ranks,
and spoke chearfully to them, and used what Ar∣guments
he thought proper to settle their Minds
I remembred a Saying which I had heard old
Marshal <HI>Gustavus Horn</HI> speak in <HI>Germany,</HI> If you
find your Men faulter, or in Doubt, never suffer
them to halt, but keep them advancing; for while
they are going forward, it keeps up their Courage.</P>
<P>As soon as I could get Opportunity to speak
to him, I gave him this as my Opinion. That's very
well, says my Lord, but I am studying, says he, to
post them so as that they can't run if they would;
and if they stand but once to face the Enemy, I
do'nt fear them afterwards.</P>
<P>While we were discoursing thus, Word was
brought, that several Parties of the Enemies were
seen on the farther Side of the River, upon which
my Lord gave the Word to march, and as we
were marching on, my Lord calls out a Lieute∣nant
who had been an old Soldier, with only five
Troopers whom he had most Confidence in; and
having given him his Lesson, he sends him away;
in a Quarter of an Hour, one of the five Troopers
comes back galloping and hallowing, and tells us
his Lieutenant had with his small Party beaten
a Party of 20 of the Enemy's Horse over the River,
and had secured the Pass, and desired my Lord
would march up to him immediately.</P>
<P>'Tis a strange thing that Mens Spirits should
be subjected to such sudden Changes, and capa∣ble
of so much Alteration from Shadows of things.
<PB N="151" REF="157"/>
They were for running before they saw the Ene∣my;
now they are in haste to be led on, and but
that in raw Men we are obliged to bear with any
thing, the Disorder in both was intolerable.</P>
<P>The Story was a premeditated Sham, and not
a Word of Truth in it, invented to raise their
Spirits, and cheat them out of their cowardly
flegmatick Apprehensions, and my Lord had his
End in it; for they were all on Fire to fall on:
And I am perswaded, had they been led immedi∣ately
into a Battle begun to their Hands, they
would have laid about them like Furies; for there
is nothing like Victory to flush a young Soldier.
Thus while the Humour was high, and the Fer∣mentation
lasted, away we marched; and passing
one of their great Commons which they call <HI>Moors,</HI>
we came to the River, as he called it, where our
Lieutenant was posted with his four Men; 'twas
a little Brook fordable with Ease, and leaving
a Guard at the Pass, we advanced to the Top of a
small Ascent, from whence we had a fair View
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, as they lay behind another
River larger than the former.</P>
<P>Our Men were posted well enough, behind a
small Enclosure, with a narrow Lane in their
Front: And my Lord had caused his Dragoons
to be placed in the Front to line the Hedges;
and in this Posture he stood viewing the Enemy
at a Distance. The <HI>Scots</HI> who had some Intelli∣gence
of our coming, drew out three small Parties,
and sent them by different Ways to observe our
Number; and forming a fourth Party, which I
guessed to be about 600 Horse, advanced to the
Top of the Plain, and drew up to face us, but ne∣ver
offered to attack us.</P>
<P>One of the small Parties making about 100 Men,
one third Foot passes upon our Flank in View,
<PB N="152" REF="158"/>
but out of reach; and as they marched, shouted
at us, which our Men better pleased with that
Work than with Fighting, readily enough an∣swered,
and would fain have fired at them for the
Pleasure of making a Noise; for they were too
far off to hit them.</P>
<P>I observed that these Parties had always some
Foot with them; and yet if the Horse galloped,
or pushed on ever so forward, the Foot were as
forward as they, which was an extraordinary
Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus Adolphus</HI> that King of Soldiers, was the
first that I have ever observed found the Advan∣tage
of mixing small Bodies of Musqueteers a∣mong
his Horse; and had he had such nimble
strong Fellows as these, he would have prized
them above all the rest of his Men. These were
those they call <HI>Highlanders;</HI> they would run on
Foot with their Arms, and all their Acoutre∣ments,
and keep very good Order too, and yet
keep Pace with the Horse, let them go at what
Rate they would. When I saw the Foot thus in∣terlined
among the Horse, together with the Way
of ordering their flying Parties, it presently oc∣curred
to my Mind, that here was some of our
old <HI>Scots,</HI> come home out of <HI>Germany,</HI> that had the
ordering of Matters; and if so, I knew we were
not a Match for them.</P>
<P>Thus we stood facing the Enemy 'till our Scouts
brought us Word the whole <HI>Scots</HI> Army was in
Motion, and in full march to attack us; and
though it was not true, and the Fear of our Men
doubled every Object, yet 'twas thought conve∣nient
to make our Retreat. The whole Matter
was, that the Scouts having informed them what
they could, of our Strength; the 600 were ordered
<PB N="153" REF="159"/>
to march towards us, and three Regiments of
Foot were drawn out to support the Horse.</P>
<P>I know not whether they would have ventured
to attack us, at least before their Foot had come
up; but whether they would have put it to the
Hazard or no, we were resolved not to hazard
the Trial, so we drew down to the Pass; and, as re∣treating
looks something like running away,
especially when an Enemy is at hand, our Men
had much a-do to make there Retreat pass for a
March, and not a Flight; and, by their often
looking behind them, any Body might know
what they would have done if they had been
pressed.</P>
<P>I confess, I was heartily ashamed when the <HI>Scots</HI>
coming up to the Place where we had been posted,
stood and shouted at us. I would have per∣swaded
my Lord to have charged them, and he
would have done it with all his Heart, but he
saw it was not practicable; so we stood at gaze
with them above 2 Hours, by which time their
Foot were come up to them, and yet they
did not offer to attack us. I never was so ashamed
of my self in my Life; we were all dispirited,
the <HI>Scots</HI> Gentlemen would come out single, with∣in
Shot of our Post, which in a time of War is
always accounted a Challenge to any single Gen∣tleman,
to come out and exchange a Pistol with
them, and no Body would stir; at last our old
Lieutenant rides out to meet a <HI>Scotchman</HI> that
came pickeering on his Quarter. This Lieute∣nant
was a brave and a strong Fellow, had been
a Soldier in the <HI>Low Countries;</HI> and though he
was not of any Quality, only a meer Soldier,
had his Preferment for his Conduct. He gallops
bravely up to his Adversary, and exchanging
their Pistols, the Lieutenant's Horse happened
<PB N="154" REF="160"/>
to be killed. The <HI>Scotchman</HI> very generously dis∣mounts,
and engages him with his Sword, and
fairly masters him, and carries him away Pri∣soner;
and I think this Horse was all the Blood
was shed in that War.</P>
<P>The Lieutenant's Name thus conquered was
<HI>English,</HI> and as he was a very stout old Soldier, the
Disgrace of it broke his Heart. The <HI>Scotchman</HI>
indeed used him very generously; for he treated
him in the Camp very courteously, gave him
another Horse, and set him at Liberty, <HI>gratis.</HI>
But the Man laid it so to Heart, that he never
would appear in the Army, but went home to
his own Country and died.</P>
<P>I had enough of Party-making, and was quite
sick with Indignation at the Cowardise of the
Men; and my Lord was in as great a Fret as I,
but there was no Remedy; we durst not go about to
retreat, for we should have been in such Confu∣sion,
that the Enemy must have discovered it:
So my Lord resolved to keep the Post, if pos∣sible,
and send to the King for some Foot. Then
were our Men ready to fight with one another
who should be the Messenger; and at last when
a Lieutenant with 20 Dragoons was dispatched,
he told us afterwards he found himselfan Hundred
strong before he was gotten a Mile from the
Place.</P>
<P>In short, as soon as ever the Day declined, and
the Dusk of the Evening began to shelter the
Designs of the Men, they dropt away from us
one by one; and at last in such Numbers, that if
we had stayed till the Morning, we had not
had 50 Men left, out of 1200 Horse and
Dragoons.</P>
<P>When I saw how 'twas, consulting with some
of the Officers, we all went to my Lord <HI>Holland,</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="161"/>
and pressed him to retreat, before the Enemy
should discern the Flight of our Men; so he drew
us off, and we came to the Camp the next Mor∣ning,
in the shamefullest Condition that ever poor
Men could do. And this was the End of the worst
Expedition ever I made in my Life.</P>
<P>To fight and be beaten, is a Casualty common
to a Soldier, and I have since had enough of it;
but to run away at the Sight of an Enemy, and
neither strike or be stricken, this is the very
Shame of the Profession, and no Man that has
done it, ought to shew his Face again in the
Field, unless Disadvantages of Place or Number
make it tolerable, neither of which was our
Case.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Holland</HI> made another March a few
Days after, in hopes to retrieve this Miscarriage;
but I had enough of it, so I kept in my Quarters:
And though his Men did not desert him as before,
yet upon the Appearance of the Enemy, they
did not think fit to fight, and came off with but
little more Honour than they did before.</P>
<P>There was no need to go out to seek the Enemy
after this; for they came, as I have noted, and
pitched in Sight of us, and their Parties came
up every Day to the very Out-works of <HI>Berwick;</HI>
but no Body cared to meddle with them: And
in this Posture things stood when the Pacifi∣cation
was agreed on by both Parties; which, like
a short Truce, only gave both Sides Breath to
prepare for a new War more ridiculously ma∣naged
than the former. When the Treaty was so
near a Conclusion, as that Conversation was ad∣mitted
on both Sides, I went over to the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Camp to satisfy my Curiosity, as many of our
<HI>English</HI> Officers did also.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="162"/>
I confess, the Soldiers made a very uncouth
Figure, especially the <HI>Highlanders:</HI> The Oddness
and Barbarity of their Garb and Arms seemed
to have something in it remarkable.</P>
<P>They were generaly tall swinging Fellows; their
Swords were extravagantly, and I think insignifi∣cantly
broad, and they carried great wooden Tar∣gets
large enough to cover the upper part of their
Bodies. Their Dress was as antique as the rest; a
at Cap on their Heads, called by them a Bonnet,
long hanging Sleeves behind, and their Doublet,
Breeches and Stockings, of a Stuff they called
Plaid, striped a-cross red and yellow, with short
Cloaks of the same. These Fellows looked, when
drawn out, like a Regiment of <HI>Merry Andrews</HI>
ready for <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Fair. They are in Companies
all of a Name, and therefore call one another
only by their Christian Names, as <HI>Jemy, Jockey,</HI>
that is <HI>John;</HI> and <HI>Sawny,</HI> that is, <HI>Alexander,</HI> and the
like. And they scorn to be commanded but by
one of their own Clan or Family. They are
all Gentlemen, and proud enough to be Kings.
The meanest Fellow among them is as tenacious
of his Honour, as the best Nobleman in the Coun∣try,
and they will fight, and cut one another's
Throats for every trifling Affront.</P>
<P>But to their own Clans or Lairds, they are the
willingest and most obedient Fellows in Nature.
Give them their due, were their Skill in Excer∣cises
and Discipline proportioned to their Cou∣rage,
they would make the bravest Soldiers in
the World. They are large Bodies, and pro∣digiously
strong; and two Qualities they have
above other Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> hardy to endure Hunger,
Cold, and Hardships, and wonderfully swift of
Foot. The latter is such an Advantage in the
Field, that I know none like it; for if they con∣quer,
<PB N="157" REF="163"/>
no Enemy can escape them; and if they
run, even the Horse can hardly overtake them.
These were some of them, who, as I observed
before, went out in Parties with their Horse.</P>
<P>There were three or four Thousand of these in
the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, armed only with Swords and
Targets; and in their Belts some of them had a
Pistol, but no Musquets at that time among them.</P>
<P>But there were also a great many Regiments
of disciplined Men, who by their carrying their
Arms, looked as if they understood their Busi∣ness,
and by their Faces, that they durst see
an Enemy.</P>
<P>I had not been Half an Hour in their Camp,
after the Ceremony of giving our Names, and
passing their Out-Guards and Main Guard was
over, but I was saluted by several of my Acquain∣tance;
and in particular, by one who led the
<HI>Scotch</HI> Voluntiers at the Taking the Castle of
<HI>Openheim,</HI> of which I have given an Account.
They used me with all the Respect they thought
due to me, on Account of old Affairs, gave me
the Word, and a Sergeant waited upon me when∣ever
I pleased to go abroad.</P>
<P>I continued 12 or 14 Days among them, till
the Pacification was concluded; and they were
ordered to march home. They spoke very re∣spectfully
of the King, but I found were exaspe∣rated
to the last Degree at Arch-bishop <HI>Laud</HI> and
the <HI>English</HI> Bishops, for endeavouring to impose
the <HI>Common-Prayer-Book</HI> upon them; and they
always talked with the utmost Contempt of our
Soldiers and Army. I always waved the Dis∣course
about the Clergy, and the Occasion of
the War; but I could not but be too sensible
what they said of our Men was true; and by
this I perceived they had an universal Intelligence
<PB N="158" REF="164"/>
from among us, both of what we were doing,
and what sort of People we were that were do∣ing
it; and they were mighty desirous of com∣ing
to Blows with us. I had an Invitation from
their General, but I declined it, lest I should give
Offence. I found they accepted the Pacification
as a thing not likely to hold, or that they
did not design should hold; and that they were
resolved to keep their Forces on Foot, notwith∣standing
the Agreement. Their whole Army
was full of brave Officers, Men of as much Ex∣perience
and Conduct as any in the World; and all
Men who know any thing of the War, know
good Officers presently make a good Army.</P>
<P>Things being thus huddled up, the <HI>English</HI> came
back to <HI>York,</HI> were the Army separated, and the
<HI>Scots</HI> went home to encrease theirs; for I easily
foresaw, that Peace was the farthest thing from
their Thoughts.</P>
<P>The next Year the Flame broke out again,
the King draws his Forces down into the North,
as before, and Expresses were sent to all the Gen∣tlemen
that had Commands, to be at the Place
by the 15th of <HI>July.</HI> As I had accepted of no
Command in the Army, so I had no Inclination
at all to go; for I foresaw there would be no∣thing
but Disgrace attend it. My Father ob∣serving
such an Alteration in my usual Forward∣ness,
asked me one Day, what was the Matter,
that I, who used to be so forward to go into the
Army, and so eager to run abroad to fight, now
shewed no Inclination to appear when the Ser∣vice
of the King and Country called me to it? I
told him, I had as much Zeal as ever for the
King's Service, and for the Country too: But
he knew a Soldier could not abide to be beaten;
and being from thence a little more inquisitive,
<PB N="159" REF="165"/>
I told him the Observations I had made in the
<HI>Scots</HI> Army, and the People I had conversed with
there; and, Sir, says I, assure your self, if the
King offers to fight them, he will be beaten; and
I don't love to engage, when my Judgement tells
me before-hand, I shall be worsted: And as I
had foreseen, it came to pass; for the <HI>Scots</HI> re∣solving
to proceed, never stood upon the Cere∣mony
of Aggression, as before, but on the 20th
of <HI>August</HI> they entered <HI>England</HI> with their
Army.</P>
<P>However, as my Father desired, I went to the
King's Army, which was then at <HI>York,</HI> but not
gotten all together: The King himself was at
<HI>London;</HI> but upon this News takes Post for the
Army, and advancing a Part of his Forces, he
posted the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> and Sir <HI>Jacob Astley,</HI>
with a Brigade of Foot and some Horse at <HI>New∣born,</HI>
upon the River <HI>Tine,</HI> to keep the <HI>Scots</HI> from
passing that River.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> could have passed the <HI>Tine</HI> without
Fighting; but to let us see that they were able
to force their Passage, they fall upon this Body
of Men; and notwithstanding all the Advan∣tages
of the Place, they beat them from the Post,
took their Baggage and two Pieces of Cannon,
with some Prisoners. Sir <HI>Jacob Astley</HI> made what
Resistance he could; but the <HI>Scots</HI> charged with
so much Fury, and being also over-powered, he
was soon put into Confusion. Immediately the
<HI>Scots</HI> made themselves Masters of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and
the next Day of <HI>Durham,</HI> and laid those two
Counties under intolerable Contributions.</P>
<P>Now was the King absolutely ruined; for
among his own People the Discontents before
were so plain, that had the Clergy had any
Forecast, they would never have embroiled him
<PB N="160" REF="166"/>
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> till he had fully brought Matters
to an Understanding at Home: But the Case was
thus: The King, by the good Husbandry of
Bishop <HI>Juxon,</HI> his Treasurer, had a Million of ready
Money in his Treasury, and upon that Account
having no need of a Parliament, had not called
one in 12 Years; and perhaps had never called
another, if he had not by this unhappy Circum∣stance
been reduced to a Necessity of it; for now
this ready Money was spent in two foolish Ex∣peditions,
and his Army appeared in a Condi∣tion
not fit to engage the <HI>Scots;</HI> the Detatch∣ment
under Sir <HI>Jacob Astley,</HI> which were of the
Flower of his Men, had been routed at <HI>Newborn,</HI>
and the Enemy had Possession of two entire
Counties.</P>
<P>All Men blamed <HI>Laud</HI> for prompting the King
to provoke the <HI>Scots,</HI> a headstrong Nation, and
zealous for their own Way of Worship; and
<HI>Laud</HI> himself found too late the Consequences of
it, both to the whole Cause and to himself;
for the <HI>Scots,</HI> whose native Temper is not easily to
forgive an Injury, pursued him by their Party
in <HI>England,</HI> and never gave it over, till they
laid his Head on the Block.</P>
<P>The ruined Country now clamoured in his
Majesty's Ears with daily Petitions, and the
Gentry of other Neighbour Counties cry
out for Peace and a Parliament. The King, em∣barassed
with these Difficulties, and quite em∣pty
of Money, calls a Great Council of the No∣bility
at <HI>York,</HI> and demands their Advice, which
any one could have told him before, would be
to call a Parliament.</P>
<P>I cannot, without Regret, look back upon the
Misfortune of the King, who, as he was one of
the best Princes in his personal Conduct that
<PB N="161" REF="167"/>
ever reigned in <HI>England,</HI> had yet some of the
greatest Unhappinesses in his Conduct as a King,
that ever Prince had, and the whole Course of
his Life demonstrated it.</P>
<P>1. An impolitick Honesty. His Enemies cal∣led
it Obstinacy: But as I was persectly ac∣quainted
with his Temper, I cannot but think
it was his Judgment, when he thought he was
in the right to adhere to it as a Duty tho' against
his Interest.</P>
<P>2. Too much Compliance when he was com∣plying.</P>
<P>No Man but himself would have denied what
at sometimes he denied, and have granted what
at other times he granted; and this Uncer∣tainty
of Counsel proceeded from two things.</P>
<P>1. The Heat of the Clergy, to whom he was
exceedingly devoted, and for whom indeed he
ruined himself.</P>
<P>2. The Wisdom of his Nobility.</P>
<P>Thus when the Counsel of his Priests prevai∣led,
all was Fire and Fury; the <HI>Scots</HI> were Re∣bels,
and must be subdued; and the Parlia∣ment's
Demands were to be rejected as exor∣bitant;
but whenever the King's Judgment was
led by the grave and steady Advice of his No∣bility
and Counsellors, he was always enclined
by them to temperate his Measures between
the two Extremes: And had he gone on in
such a Temper, he had never met with the
Misfortunes which afterward attended him, or
had so many Thousands of his Friends lost their
Lives and Fortunes in his Service.</P>
<P>I am sure, we that knew what it was to fight
for him, and that loved him better than any of
the Clergy could pretend to, have had many a
Consultation how to bring over our Master from
<PB N="162" REF="168"/>
so espousing their Interest, as to ruin himself for
it; but 'twas in vain.</P>
<P>I took this Interval, when I sat still and only
looked on, to make these Remarks, because I re∣member
the best Friends the King had were at
this time of that Opinion. That 'twas an unac∣countable
Piece of Indiscretion, to commence a
Quarrel with the <HI>Scots,</HI> a poor and obstinate Peo∣ple,
for a Ceremony and Book of Church Disci∣pline,
at a time when the King stood but upon
indifferent Terms with his People at Home.</P>
<P>The Consequence was, it put Arms into the
Hands of his Subjects to rebel against him; it
embroiled him with his Parliament in <HI>England,</HI>
to whom he was fain to stoop in a fatal and unu∣sual
Manner to get Money, all his own being
spent, and so to buy off the <HI>Scots</HI> whom he cou'd
not beat off.</P>
<P>I cannot but give one Instance of the unaccoun∣table
Politicks of his Ministers. If they over∣ruled
this unhappy King to it, with Design to ex∣haust
and impoverish him, they were the worst
of Traytors; if not, the grossest of Fools. They
prompted the King to equip a Fleet against the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and to put on board it 5000 Land Men.
Had this been all, the Design had been good, that
while the King had faced the Army upon the
Borders, these 5000 landing in the Frith of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>
might have put that whole Nation into Dis∣order.
But in Order to this, they advise the
King to lay out his Money in fitting out the big∣gest
Ships he had, and the Royal Sovereign, the
biggest Ship the World had ever seen, which
cost him no less than 100000 Pounds was now
built, and fitted out for this Voyage.</P>
<P>This was the most incongruous and ridiculous
Advice that could be given, and made us all be∣lieve
<PB N="163" REF="169"/>
we were betrayed, tho' we knew not
by whom.</P>
<P>To fit out Ships of 100 Guns to invade <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which had not one Man of War in the World, nor
any open Confederacy with any Prince or State
that had any Fleet! 'twas a most ridiculous thing.
An Hundred Sail of <HI>Newcastle</HI> Colliers, to carry the
Men with their Stores and Provisions, and ten Fri∣gates
of 40 Guns each, had been as good a Fleet
as Reason, and the Nature of the thing could ha'
made tolerable.</P>
<P>Thus things were carried on, 'till the King,
beggar'd by the Mismanagement of his Counsels,
and beaten by the <HI>Scots,</HI> was driven to the Necessity
of calling a Parliament in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my Design to enter into the Feuds and
Brangles of this Parliament. I have noted, by Ob∣servations
of their Mistakes, who brought the
King to this unhappy Necessity of calling them.</P>
<P>His Majesty had tried Parliaments upon seve∣ral
Occasions before, but never found himself so
much embroiled with them but he could send
them Home, and there was an End of it; but as
he could not avoid Calling these, so they took
Care to put him out of a Condition to dismiss
them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> Army was now quartered upon the
<HI>English.</HI> The Counties, the Gentry, and the
Assembly of Lords at <HI>York,</HI> petitioned for a Par∣liament.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> presented their Demands to the King,
in which it was observed, that Matters were con∣certed
between them and a Party in <HI>England;</HI> and
I confess, when I saw that, I began to think the
King in an ill Case; for as the <HI>Scots</HI> pretended Grie∣vances,
we thought, the King redressing those
Grievances, they could ask no more; and there∣fore
<PB N="164" REF="170"/>
all Men advised the King to grant their full
Demands. And whereas the King had not Mo∣ney
to supply the <HI>Scots</HI> in their March home, I know
there were several Meetings of Gentlemen with a
Design to advance considerable Sums of Money
to the King to set him free, and in order to rein∣state
his Majesty, as before. Not that we ever ad∣vised
the King to rule without a Parliament, but
we were very desirous of putting him out of the
Necessity of calling them, at least, just then.</P>
<P>But the Eighth Article of the <HI>Scots</HI> Demands ex∣presly
required, That an <HI>English</HI> Parliament might
be called to remove all Obstructions of Commerce,
and to settle Peace, Religion and Liberty; and
in another Article they tell the King, the 24th
of <HI>September</HI> being the Time his Majesty appointed
for the Meeting of the Peers, will make it too
long e'er the Parliament meet.</P>
<P>And in another, That a Parliament was the only
Way of settling Peace, and bringing them to his
Majesty's Obedience.</P>
<P>When we saw this in the Army, 'twas time to
look about. Every body perceived that the <HI>Scots</HI>
Army would call an <HI>English</HI> Parliament; and what∣ever
Aversion the King had to it, we all saw he
would be obliged to comply with it; and now
they all began to see their Error, who advised
the King to this <HI>Scotch</HI> War.</P>
<P>While these things were transacting, the Assem∣bly
of the Peers meet at <HI>York;</HI> and by their Ad∣vice
a Treaty was begun with the <HI>Scots.</HI> I had
the Honour to be sent with the first Message which
was in Writing.</P>
<P>I brought it, attended with a Trumpet, and a
Guard of 500 Horse, to the <HI>Scots</HI> Quarters. I was
stoped at <HI>Darlington,</HI> and my Errand being
known, General <HI>Lesly</HI> sent a <HI>Scots</HI> Major and 50
<PB N="165" REF="171"/>
Horse, to receive me, but would let neither my
Trumpet or Guard set Foot within their Quar∣ters.
In this Manner, I was conducted to Audi∣ence
in the Chapter-House at <HI>Durham,</HI> where a
Committee of <HI>Scots</HI> Lords who attended the Ar∣my,
received me very courteously, and gave me
their Answer in Writing also.</P>
<P>'Twas in this Anser that they shewed at least
to me their Design of embroiling the King with
his <HI>English</HI> Subjects; they discoursed very freely
with me, and did not order me to withdraw when
they debated their private Opinions: They drew
up several Answers but did not like them; at last,
they gave me one which I did not receive; I
thought it was too insolent to be born with, as
near as I can remember, it was thus.</P>
<P><HI>The Commissioners of</HI> Scotland <HI>attending the Service
in the Army, do refuse any Treaty in the City of</HI> York.</P>
<P>One of the Commissioners who treated me with
more Distinction than the rest, and discoursed
freely with me, gave me an Opportunity to
speak more freely of this than I expected.</P>
<P>I told them, if they would return to his Ma∣jesty
an Answer fit for me to carry, or if they
would say they would not treat at all, I would
deliver such a Message: But I entreated them to
consider the Answer was to their Sovereign, and
to whom they made a great Profession of Duty
and Respect; and at least they ought to give their
Reasons, why they declined a Treaty at <HI>York;</HI>
and to name some other Place, or humbly to de∣sire
his Majesty to name some other Place: But to
send Word they would not treat at <HI>York,</HI> I could
deliver no such Message, for when put into <HI>En∣glish</HI>
it would signify, they would not treat at all.</P>
<P>I used a great many Reasons and Arguments
with them on this Head: And at last, with some Dif∣ficulty,
<PB N="166" REF="172"/>
obtained of them to give the Reason, which
was the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI>'s having the chief Com∣mand
at <HI>York,</HI> whom they declared their mortal E∣nemy,
he having declared them Rebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>With this Answer I returned. I could make
no Observation in the short time I was with them;
for as I staid but one Night, so I was guarded as
a close Prisoner all the while. I saw several of
their Officers whom I knew, but they durst not
speak to me; and if they would ha' ventured,
my Guard would not ha' permitted them.</P>
<P>In this Manner I was conducted out of their
Quarters to my own Party again, and having
delivered my Message to the King, and told his
Majesty the Circumstances, I saw the King re∣ceive
the Account of the haughty Behaviour of the
<HI>Scots</HI> with some Regret; however it was his Ma∣jesty's
time now to bear, and therefore the <HI>Scots</HI>
were comply'd with, and the Treaty appointed
at <HI>Rippon;</HI> where, after much Debate, several
preliminary Articles were agreed on, as a Cessa∣tion
of Arms, <HI>Quarters and Bounds to the Armies,
Subsistence to the</HI> Scots <HI>Army,</HI> and the Residue of the
Demands was referred to a Treaty at <HI>London, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We were all amazed at the Treaty, and I cannot
but remember we used to wish much rather we had
been suffered to fight; for tho' we had been wor∣sted
at first, the Power and Strength of the King's
Interest which was not yet tried, must, in fine,
ha' been too strong for the <HI>Scots:</HI> Whereas now we
saw the King was for complying with any thing,
and all his Friends would be ruined.</P>
<P>I confess, I had nothing to fear, and so was not
much concerned; but our Predictions soon came
to pass: For no sooner was this Parliament called,
but Abundance of those who had embroiled their
King with his People of both Kingdoms, like the
<PB N="167" REF="173"/>
Disciples, when their Master was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etrayed to the
<HI>Jews, forsook him and fled;</HI> and now Parliament
Tyranny began to succeed Church Tyranny, and
we Soldiers were glad see it at first: The Bishops
trembled, the Judges went to Goal; the Officers
of the Costoms were laid hold on; and the Par∣liament
began to lay their Fingers on the great
ones, particularly Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> and the Earl
of <HI>Strafford.</HI> We had no great Concern for the
first, but the last was a Man of so much Conduct
and Gallantry, and so beloved by the Soldiers and
principal Gentry of <HI>England,</HI> that every Body was
touched with his Misfortune.</P>
<P>The Parliament now grew mad in their Turn,
and as the Prosperity of any Party is the time to
shew their Discretion, the Parliament shewed
they knew as little where to stop as other People.
The King was not in a Condition to deny any
thing, and nothing could be demanded but they
push'd it. They attainted the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and
thereby made the King cut off his right Hand, to
save his left, and yet not save it neither▪ They ob∣tain
another Bill, to empower them to sit during
their own Pleasure, and after them, Triennial Par∣liaments
to meet, whether the King call them or no;
and Granting this compleated his Majesty's Ruin.</P>
<P>Had the House only regulated the Abuses of
the Court, punished evil Counsellours, and restor'd
Parliaments to their original and just Powers, all
had been well; and the King, tho' he had been
more than mortified, had yet reaped the Benefit
of future Peace; for now the <HI>Scots</HI> were sent Home,
after having eaten up two Counties, and received
a prodigious Sum of Money to boot: And the
King, tho' too late, goes in Person to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and grants them all they could desire, and more
<PB N="168" REF="174"/>
than they asked; but in <HI>England,</HI> the Desires of
ours were unbounded, and drove at all Extremes.</P>
<P>They threw out the Bishops from sitting in the
House, make a Protestation equivalent to the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Covenant; and this done, print their Remon∣strance.
This so provoked the King, that he
resolves upon seizing some of the Members, and
in an ill Hour enters the House in Person to take
them. Thus one imprudent thing on one Hand
produced another of the other Hand, 'till the
King was obliged to leave them to themselves,
for fear of being mobbed into something or other
unworthy of himself.</P>
<P>These Proceedings began to alarm the Gentry
and Nobility of <HI>England;</HI> for however willing we
were to have evil Counsellours removed, and the
Government return to a settled and legal Course,
according to the happy Constitution of this Na∣tion,
and might ha' been forward enough to have
owned the King had been misled, and imposed up∣on
to do things which he had rather had not been
done; yet it did not follow, that all the Powers
and Prerogatives of the Crown should devolve
upon the Parliament, and the King in a Manner
be deposed, or else sacrificed to the Fury of the
Rabble.</P>
<P>The Heats of the House running them thus to
all Extremes, and at last to take from the King
the Power of the Militia, which indeed was all
that was left to make him any thing of a King,
put the King upon opposing Force with Force;
and thus the Flame of Civil War began.</P>
<P>However backward I was in engaging in the
second Year's Expedition against the <HI>Scots,</HI> I was
as forward now; for I waited on the King at <HI>York,</HI>
where a gallant Company of Gentlemen as ever
were seen in <HI>England,</HI> engaged themselves to en∣ter
<PB N="169" REF="175"/>
into his Service; and here some of us formed our
selves into Troops for the Guard of his Person.</P>
<P>The King having been waited upon by the
Gentry of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and having told them his Re∣solution
of erecting his Royal Standard, and re∣ceived
from them hearty Assurances of Support;
dismisses them, and marches to <HI>Hull,</HI> where lay
the Train of Artillery, and all the Arms and A∣munition
belonging to the <HI>Northern</HI> Army which
had been disbanded. But here the Parliament
had been before-hand with his Majesty, so that
when he came to <HI>Hull,</HI> he found the Gates shut,
and Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> the Governour upon the
Walls, tho' with a great deal of seeming Humility
and Protestations of Loyalty to his Person, yet with
a positive Denial to admit any of the King's At∣tendants
into the Town. If his Majesty pleased
to enter the Town in Person with any reasona∣ble
Number of his Houshould, he would sub∣mit,
but would not be prevailed on to receive
the King, as he would be received, with his
Forces, tho' those Forces were then but very few.</P>
<P>The King was exceedingly provoked at this
Repulse, and indeed it was a great Surprize to
us all; for certainly never Prince began a War
against the whole Strength of his Kingdom,
under the Circumstances that he was in. He had
not a Garrison, or a Company of Soldiers in
his Pay, not a Stand of Arms, or a Barrel of
Powder, a Musquet, Cannon or Mortar, not
a Ship of all the Fleet, or Money in his Trea∣sury
to procure them; whereas the Parliament
had all his Navy, and Ordinance, Stores, Maga∣zines,
Arms, Ammunition, and Revenue, in their
Keeping. And this I take to be another Defect
of the King's Counsel, and a sad Instance of the
Distraction of his Affairs; that when he saw how
<PB N="170" REF="176"/>
all things were going to wreck, as it was im∣possible
but he should see it, and 'tis plain he
did see it, that he should not long enough before
it came to Extremities, secure the Navy, Maga∣zines,
and Stores of War, in the Hands of his
trusty Servants that would have been sure to
have preserved them for his Use, at a Time
when he wanted them.</P>
<P>It cannot be supposed, but the Gentry of
<HI>England,</HI> who generally preserved their Loyalty
for their Royal Master, and at last heartily
shewed it, were exceedingly discouraged at
first, when they saw the Parliament had an the
Means of making War in their own Hands, and
the King was naked and destitute either of Arms,
or Ammunition, or Money to procure them.</P>
<P>Not but that the King, by extraordinary Ap∣plication,
recovered the Disorder the Want of
these things had thrown him into, and supplied
himself with all things needful.</P>
<P>But my Observation was this, had his Ma∣jesty
had the Magazines, Navy, and Forts in his
own Hand, the Gentry, who wanted but the
Prospect of something to encourage them, had
come in at first, and the Parliament being un∣provided,
would have been presently reduced
to Reason.</P>
<P>But this was it that baulked the Gentry of
<HI>Yorkshire,</HI> who went home again, giving the King
good Promises, but never appeard for him till
by raising a good Army in <HI>Shropshire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI>
he marched towards <HI>London,</HI> and they saw there
was a Prospect of their being supported.</P>
<P>In this Condition the King erected his Stan∣dard
at <HI>Nottingham, August</HI> the 22d 1642, and,
I confess, I had very melancholy Apprehensions
of the King's Affairs; for the Appearance to
<PB N="171" REF="177"/>
the Royal Standard was but small. The Affront
the King had met with at <HI>Hull,</HI> had baulked and
dispirited the Northern Gentry, and the King's
Affairs looked with a very dismal Aspect. We
had Expresses from <HI>London</HI> of the prodigious
Success of the Parliament's Levies, how their
Men came in faster than they could entertain
them, and that Arms were delivered out to whole
Companies listed together, and the like: And
all this while the King had not got together a
Thousand Foot, and had no Arms for them
neither. When the King saw this, he immediately
dispatches <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive several Messengers, whereof one
went to the Marquess of <HI>Worcester</HI> into <HI>Wales;</HI>
one went to the Queen, then at <HI>Windsor;</HI> one to
the Duke of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> then Marquess of <HI>New∣castle,</HI>
into the <HI>North;</HI> one into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and one
into <HI>France,</HI> where the Queen soon after arrived
to raise Money, and buy Arms, and to get what
Assistance she could among her own Friends:
Nor was her Majesty idle, for she sent over
several Ships laden with Arms and Ammunition,
with a fine Train of Artillery, and a great many
very good Officers; and though one of the first
fell into the Hands of the Parliament, with 300
Barrels of Powder and some Arms, and 150 Gen∣tlemen,
yet most of the Gentlemen found Means,
one Way or other, to get to us, and most of the
Ships the Queen freighted arrived; and at last
her Majesty came her self, and brought an extra∣ordinary
Supply, both of Men, Money, Arms, &amp;c.
with which she joined the King's Forces under
the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> in the <HI>North.</HI> Finding his
Majesty thus bestirring himself to muster his
Friends together, I ask'd him, if he thought it
might not be for his Majesty's Service to let me
go among my Friends, and his loyal Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects
<PB N="172" REF="178"/>
about <HI>Shrewsbury?</HI> Yes, says the King, smiling, I
intend you shall, and I design to go with you
my self. I did not understand what the King
meant then, and did not think it good Man∣ners
to enquire; but the next Day I found all
things disposed for a March, and the King on
Horseback by Eight of the Clock; when calling
me to him, he told me I should go before, and
let my Father and all my Friends know, he
would be at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> the <HI>Saturday</HI> following. I
left my Equipages, and taking Post with only
one Servant, was at my Father's the next Morn∣ing
by Break of Day. My Father was not sur∣prized
at the News of the King's coming at all;
for, it seems, he, together with the loyal Gentry
of those Parts, had sent particularly to give the
King an Invitation to move that Way, which I
was not made privy to; with an Account what
Encouragement they had there in the Endea∣vours
made for his Interest. In short, the whole
Country was entirely for the King, and such was
the universal Joy the People shewed when the
News of his Majesty's coming down was positi∣vely
known, that all Manner of Business was
laid aside, and the whole Body of the People
seemed to be resolved upon the War.</P>
<P>As this gave a new Face to the King's Affairs, so
I must own it filled me with Joy; for I was
astonished before, when I considered what the
King and his Friends were like to be exposed
to. The News of the Proceedings of the Par∣liament,
and their powerful Preparations were
now no more terrible; the King came at the
Time appointed, and having lain at my Father's
House one Night, entered <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> in the Morn∣ing.
The Acclamations of the People, the Con∣course
of the Nobility and Gentry about his Per∣son,
<PB N="173" REF="179"/>
and the Crouds which now came every Day
in to his Standard, were incredible.</P>
<P>The Loyalty of the <HI>English</HI> Gentry was not
only worth Notice, but the Power of the Gentry
is extraordinary visible in this Matter: The
King, in about six Weeks time, which was the
most of his Stay at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> was supplied with
Money, Arms, Ammunition, and a Train of Ar∣tillery,
and listed a Body of an Army upwards
of 20000 Men.</P>
<P>His Majesty seeing the general Alacrity of his
People, immediately issued out Commissions, and
form'd Regiments of Horse and Foot; and ha∣ving
some experienced Officers about him, toge∣ther
with about 16 who came from <HI>France,</HI> with
a Ship loaded with Arms and some Field-pieces
which came very seasonably into the <HI>Severn;</HI> the
Men were excercised, regularly disciplined, and
quartered, and now we began to look like
Soldiers. My Father had raised a Regiment of
Horse at his own Charge, and compleated them,
and the King gave out Arms to them from the
Supplies which I mentioned came from Abroad.
Another Party of Horse, all brave stout Fellows,
and well mounted, came in from <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and
the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> at the Head of them. The
<HI>Welchmen</HI> came in by Droves; and so great was
the Concourse of People, that the King began
to think of Marching, and gave the Command, as
well as the Trust of Regulating the Army, to the
brave Earl of <HI>Lindsey,</HI> as General of the Foot. The
Parliament General being the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> two
braver men, or two better Officers, were not in
the Kingdom; they had both been old Soldiers,
and had served together as Voluntiers, in the
<HI>Low Country</HI> Wars, under Prince <HI>Maurice.</HI> They
had been Comrades and Companions Abroad,
<PB N="174" REF="180"/>
and now came to face one another as Enemies
in the Field.</P>
<P>Such was the Expedition used by the King
and his Friends, in the Levies of this first Army,
that notwithstanding the wonderful Expedition
the Parliament made, the King was in the Field
before them; and now the Gentry in other Parts
of the Nation bestirred themselves, and siezed
upon, and Garrisoned several considerable Places
for the King. In the North, the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>
not only Garrisoned the most considerable Places,
but even the general Possession of the North
was for the King, excepting <HI>Hull,</HI> and some few
Places, which the old Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> had taken
up for the Parliament. On the other Hand,
entire <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and most of the Western Counties
were the King's. The Parliament had their
chief Interest in the South and Eastern Part of
<HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Kent, Surry,</HI> and <HI>Sussex, Essex, Suffolk,
Norfolk, Cambridge, Bedford, Huntington, Hertford,
Buckinghamshire,</HI> and the other midland Counties.
These were called, or some of them at least, the
Associated Counties, and felt little of the War,
other than the Charges; but the main Support of
the Parliament was the City of <HI>London.</HI> The King
made the Seat of his Court at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which he
caused to be regularly fortified. The Lord <HI>Say</HI> had
been here, and had Possession of the City for the Ene∣my,
and was debating about fortifying it, but came
to no Resolution, which was a very great Over∣sight
in them; the Situation of the Place, and
the Importance of it, on many Accounts, to the
City of <HI>London,</HI> considered; and they would have
retrieved this Error afterwards, but then 'twas
too late; for the King made it the Head Quar∣ter,
and received great Supplies and Assistance
from the Wealth of the Colleges, and the Plenty
<PB N="175" REF="181"/>
of the neighbouring Country. <HI>Abingdon, Walling∣ford,
Basing</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> were all Garrisoned
and fortified as Outworks to defend this as the
Center. And thus all <HI>England</HI> became the Thea∣ter
of Blood, and War was spread into every
Corner of the Country, though as yet there
was no Stroke struck. I had no Command in
this Army; my Father led his own Regiment,
and old as he was, would not leave his royal
Master, and my elder Brother staid at home to
support the Family. As for me, I node a Voluntier
in the royal Troop of Guards, which may very
well deserve the Title of a royal Troop; for it was
composed of young Gentlemen Sons of the Nobi∣lity
and some of the prime Gentry of the Nation,
and I think not a Person of so mean a Birth or
Fortune as my self. We reckoned in this Troop
Two and Thirty Lords, or who came afterwards to
be such, and Eight and Thirty of younger Sons of
the Nobility, five <HI>French</HI> Noblemen, and all the
rest Gentlemen of very good Families and
Estates.</P>
<P>And that I may give the due to their personal
Valour, many of this Troop lived afterwards to
have Regiments and Troops under their Com∣mand,
in the Service of the King; many of them
lost their Lives for him, and most of them
their Estates: Nor did they behave unworthy of
themselves in their first shewing their Faces
to the Enemy, as shall be mentioned in its
Place.</P>
<P>While the King remained at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> his
loyal Friends bestirred themselves in several
Parts of the Kingdom. <HI>Goring</HI> had secured <HI>Ports∣mouth;</HI>
but being young in Matters of War, and
not in Time relieved, though the Marquess of
<HI>Hertford</HI> was marching to relieve him, yet he
<PB N="176" REF="182"/>
was obliged to quit the Place; and shipped him∣self
for <HI>Holland,</HI> from whence he returned with
Relief for the King, and afterwards did very
good Service upon all Occasions, and so effectu∣ally
cleared himself of the Scandal the hasty
Surrender of <HI>Portsmouth</HI> had brought upon his
Courage.</P>
<P>The chief Power of the King's Forces lay in
three Places, in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and at <HI>Shrews∣bury:</HI>
In <HI>Cornwall,</HI> Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> afterwards Lord
<HI>Hopton;</HI> Sir <HI>Bevil Granvil</HI> and Sir <HI>Nicholas Slam∣ming,</HI>
secured all the Country, and afterwards
spread themselves over <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Somerset∣shire,</HI>
took <HI>Exeter</HI> from the Parliament, fortified
<HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and <HI>Barnstable,</HI> and beat Sir <HI>William
Waller</HI> at the Battle of <HI>Roundway Down,</HI> as I shall
touch at more particularly when I come to recite
the Part of my own Travels that Way.</P>
<P>In the <HI>North,</HI> the Marquess of <HI>Newcastle</HI> secured
all the Country, Garrisoned <HI>York, Scarborough, Car∣lisle,
Newcastle Pomfret, Leeds,</HI> and all the consi∣derable
Places, and took the Field with a very
good Army, though afterwards he proved more
unsuccessful than the rest, having the whole
Power of a Kingdom at his Back, the <HI>Scots</HI> co∣ming
in with an Army to the Assistance of the
Parliament; which indeed was the general Turn
of the Scale of the War; for had it not been
for this <HI>Scots</HI> Army, the King had most certainly
reduced the Parliament, at least to good Terms
of Peace, in two Years time.</P>
<P>The King was the third Article: His Force
at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> I have noted already; the Alacrity
of the Gentry filled him with Hopes, and all
his Army with Vigour, and the 8th of <HI>October</HI> 1642,
his Majesty gave Orders to march. The Earl
of <HI>Essex</HI> had spent above a Month after his lea∣ing
<PB N="177" REF="183"/>
<HI>London</HI> (for he went thence the 9th of <HI>Sep∣tember</HI>)
in modelling and drawing together his
Forces; his Rendezvous was at St. <HI>Albans,</HI> from
whence he marched to <HI>Northampton, Coventry,</HI> and
<HI>Warwick,</HI> and leaving Garrisons in them, he
comes on to <HI>Worcester.</HI> Being thus advanced, he
possesses <HI>Oxford,</HI> as I noted before, <HI>Banbury, Bri∣stol,
Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> out of all which
Places, except <HI>Gloucester,</HI> we drove him back to <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
in a very little while.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>John Biron</HI> had raised a very good Party
of 500 Horse, most Gentlemen, for the King,
and had possessed <HI>Oxford;</HI> but on the Approach of
the Lord <HI>Say</HI> quitted it, being now but an open
Town, and retreated to <HI>Worcester:</HI> From whence,
on the Approach of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Army, he retreated
to the King. And now all things grew ripe
for Action, both Parties having secured their
Posts, and settled their Schemes of the War, ta∣ken
their Posts and Places as their Measures
and Opportunities directed, the Field was next
in their Eye, and the Soldiers began to enquire
when they should fight; for as yet there had
been little or no Blood drawn, and 'twas not
long before they had enough of it; for I believe
I may challenge all the Historians in <HI>Europe</HI> to
tell me of any War in the World where, in the
Space of four Years, there were so many pitched
Battles, Sieges, Fights, and Skirmishes, as in this
War; we never encamped or entrenched, never
fortified the Avenues to our Posts, or lay fenced
with Rivers and Defiles; here was no Leaguers
in the Field, as at the Story of <HI>Noremberg,</HI> nei∣ther
had our Soldiers any Tents, or what they
call heavy Baggage. 'Twas the general Maxim
of this War, Where is the Enemy? Let us go
and fight them: Or, on the other Hand, if the
<PB N="178" REF="184"/>
Enemy was coming, what was to be done? Why,
what should be done? Draw out into the Fields,
and fight them. I cannot say 'twas the Prudence
of the Parties, and had the King fought less
he had gained more: And I shall remark several
times, when the Eagerness of Fighting was the
worst Counsel, and proved our Loss. This Bene∣fit
however happened in general to the Country,
that it made a quick, though a bloody End, of
the War, which otherwise had lasted till it
might have ruined the whole Nation.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>October</HI> the King's Army was
in full March, his Majesty Generalissimo, the
Earl of <HI>Lindsey</HI> General of the Foot, Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> General of the Horse; and the first Action
in the Field was by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and Sir <HI>John
Biron.</HI> Sir <HI>John</HI> had brought his Body of 500
Horse, as I noted already, from <HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>Wor∣cester;</HI>
the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> with a strong Party, being
in the Neighbourhood of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and expected
in the Town, Collonel <HI>Sandys,</HI> a hot Man, and
who had more Courage than Judgment, advances
with about 1500 Horse and Dragoons, with
Design to beat Sir <HI>John Biron</HI> out of <HI>Worcester,</HI>
and take Post there for the Parliament.</P>
<P>The King had notice that the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>
designed for <HI>Worcester,</HI> and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was or∣dered
to advance with a Body of Horse and
Dragoons, to face the Enemy, and bring off Sir
<HI>John Biron.</HI> This his Majesty did to amuse the
Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> that he might expect him that
Way; whereas the King's Design was to get be∣tween
the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Army and the City
of <HI>London;</HI> and his Majesty's End was doubly
answered; for he not only drew <HI>Essex</HI> on to <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI>
where he spent more Time than he needed,
but he beat the Party into the Bargain.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="185"/>
I went Voluntier in this Party, and rid in
my Father's Regiment; for though we really
expected not to see the Enemy, yet I was tired
with lying still. We came to <HI>Worcester</HI> just as
Notice was brought to Sir <HI>John Biron,</HI> that a
Party of the Enemy was on their March for <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI>
upon which the Prince immediately con∣sulting
what was to be done, resolves to march
the next Morning, and fight them.</P>
<P>The Enemy, who lay at <HI>Pershore,</HI> about eight
Miles from <HI>Worcester,</HI> and, as I believe, had no
Notice of our March, came on very confidently
in the Morning, and found us fairly drawn up
to receive them: I must confess this was the
bluntest downright Way of making War that
ever was seen. The Enemy, who, in all the little
Knowledge I had of War ought to have discovered
our Numbers, and guessed by our Posture what
our Design was, might easily have informed
themselves, that we intended to attack them,
and so might have secured the Advantage of a
Bridge in their Front; but without any Regard
to these Methods of Policy, they came on at
all Hazards. Upon this Notice, my Father
proposed to the Prince, to halt for them, and
suffer ourselves to be attacked, since we found
them willing to give us the Advantage: The
Prince approved of the Advice, so we halted
within View of a Bridge, leaving Space enough
on our Front for about half the Number of their
Forces to pass and draw up; and at the Bridge
was posted about 50 Dragoons, with Orders
to retire as soon as the Enemy advanced, as if
they had been afraid. On the Right of the
Road was a Ditch, and a very high Bank behind,
where we had placed 300 Dragoons, with Orders
to lye flat on their Faces till the Enemy had
<PB N="180" REF="186"/>
passed the Bridge, and to let fly among them
as soon as our Trumpets sounded a Charge. No
Body but Collonel <HI>Sandys</HI> would have been caught
in such a Snare; for he might easily have seen,
that when he was over the Bridge, there was not
Room enough for him to fight in: But the Lord
of Hosts was so much in their Mouths, <HI>for that was
the Word for that Day,</HI> that they took little heed
how to conduct the Host of the Lord to their
own Advantage.</P>
<P>As we expected, they appeared, beat our Dra∣goons
from the Bridge, and passed it: We stood
firm in one Line with a Reserve, and expected a
Charge; but Collonel <HI>Sandys</HI> shewing a great deal
more Judgment than we thought he was Master of,
extends himself to the Left, finding the Ground
too streight, and began to form his Men with
a great deal of Readiness and Skill; for by this
time he saw our Number was greater than he ex∣pected:
The Prince perceiving it, and foreseeing
that the Stratagem of the Dragoons would be
frustrated by this, immediately charges with
the Horse, and the Dragoons at the same time
standing upon their Feet, poured in their Shot
upon those that were passing the Bridge: This
Surprize put them into such Disorder, that we
had but little Work with them; for though Col∣lonel
<HI>Sandys</HI> with the Troops next him sustained
the Shock very well, and behaved themselves gal∣lantly
enough, yet the Confusion beginning in
their Reer, those that had not yet passed the
Bridge were kept back by the Fire of the Dra∣goons,
and the rest were easily cut in Pieces. Collo∣nel
<HI>Sandys</HI> was mortally wounded and taken Priso∣ner,
and the Crowd was so great, to get back,
that many pushed into the Water; and were ra∣ther
smothered than drowned. Some of them who
<PB N="181" REF="187"/>
never came into the Fight, were so frighted, that
they never looked behind them, 'till they came
to <HI>Pershore;</HI> and as we were afterwards informed,
the Life-Guards of the General who had quar∣tered
in the Town, left it in Disorder enough,
expecting us at the Heels of their Men.</P>
<P>If our Business had been to keep the Parlia∣ment
Army from coming to <HI>Worcester,</HI> we had a
very good Opportunity to have secured the Bridge
at <HI>Pershore;</HI> but our Design lay another Way, as
I have said, and the King was for drawing <HI>Essex</HI>
on to the <HI>Severn,</HI> in hopes to get behind him, which
fell out accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Essex,</HI> spurred by this Affront in the Infancy of
their Affairs, advances the next Day, and came
to <HI>Parshore</HI> time enough to be at the Funeral of
some of his Men; and from thence he advances
to <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>We marched back to <HI>Worcester</HI> extremely plea∣sed
with the good Success of our first Attack; and
our Men were so flushed with this little Victory,
that it put Vigour into the whole Army. The
Enemy lost about 3000 Men, and we carried a∣way
near 150 Prisoners, with 500 Horses, some
Standards and Arms, and among the Prisoners their
Collonel, but he died a little after of his Wounds.</P>
<P>Upon the Approach of the Enemy, <HI>Worcester</HI>
was quitted, and the Forces marched back to
join the King's Army which lay then at <HI>Bridg∣north,
Ludlow,</HI> and thereabout. As the King ex∣pected,
it fell out; <HI>Essex</HI> found so much Work at
<HI>Worcester</HI> to settle Parliament Quarters, and se∣cure
<HI>Bristol, Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Hereford,</HI> that it gave the
King a full Day's March of him; so the King ha∣ving
the Start of him, moves towards <HI>London;</HI> and
<HI>Essex,</HI> nettled to be both beaten in Fight, and out∣done
in Conduct, decamps, and follows the King.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="188"/>
The Parliament, and the <HI>Londoners</HI> too, were in
a strange Consternation at this Mistake of their
General; and had the King, whose great Misfor∣tune
was always to follow precipitant Advices:
Had the King, I say, pushed on his first Design,
which he had formed with very good Reason,
and for which he had been dodging with <HI>Essex</HI>
eight or ten Days, <HI>viz.</HI> Of marching directly to
<HI>London,</HI> where he had a very great Interest, and
where his Friends were not yet oppressed and
impoverished, as they were afterwards, he had
turned the Scale of his Affairs: And every Man
expected it; for the Members began to shift for
themselves, Expresses were sent on the Heels of
one another to the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> to hasten after
the King, and if possible to bring him to a Battle.
Some of these Letters fell into our Hands, and
we might easily discover, that the Parliament
were in the last Confusion at the Thoughts of our
coming to <HI>London:</HI> Besides this, the City was in
a worse Fright than the House, and the great
moving Men began to go out of Town. In
short, they expected us, and we expected to come,
but Providence for our Ruine had otherwise deter∣mined
it.</P>
<P><HI>Essex,</HI> upon News of the King's March, and
upon Receipt of the Parliament's Letters, makes
long Marches after us, and on the 23d of <HI>October</HI>
reaches the Village of <HI>Keynton</HI> in <HI>Warwickshire.</HI>
The King was almost as far as <HI>Banbury,</HI> and there
calls a Council of War. Some of the old Officers
that foresaw the Advantage the King had, the
Concern the City was in, and the vast Addition
both to the Reputation of his Forces, and the
Encrease of his Interest, it would be, if the King
could gain that Point, urged the King to march
on to <HI>London.</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the fresh Collo∣nells
<PB N="183" REF="189"/>
pressed for Fighting, told the King, it di∣spirited
their Men to march with the Enemy at
their Heels; that the Parliament Army was in∣feriour
to him by 6000 Men, and fatigued with
hasty Marching; that their Orders were to fight,
he had nothing to do, but to post himself to Ad∣vantage,
and receive them to their Destruction;
that the Action near <HI>Worcester</HI> had let him know
how easy it was to deal with a rash Enemy; and
that 'twas a Dishonour for him, whose Forces
were so much superior, to be pursued by his
Subjects in Rebellion. These and the like Argu∣ments
prevailed with the King to alter his wiser
Measures, and resolve to fight. Nor was this all,
when a Resolution of fighting was taken, that
Part of the Advice which they who were for
fighting gave, as a Reason for their Opinion, was
forgot, and instead of halting, and posting our
selves to Advantage till the Enemy came up,
we were ordered to march back, and meet
them.</P>
<P>Nay, so eager was the Prince for fighting,
that when from the Top of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> the Enemy's
Army was descried in the Bottom between them
and the Village of <HI>Keynton,</HI> and that the Enemy
had bid us Defiance, by discharging three Can∣nons,
we accepted the Challenge, and answering
with two Shot from our Army, we must needs
forsake the Advantages of the Hills, which they
must have mounted under the Command of our
Cannon, and march down to them into the Plain. I
confess, I thought here was a great deal more Gal∣lantry
than Discretion; for it was plainly taking an
Advantage out of our own Hands, and puting it
into the Hands of the Enemy. An Enemy that <HI>must
fight,</HI> may always be fought with to Advantage.
My old Heroe, the Glorious <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> was
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
as forward to fight as any Man of true Valour
mixt with any Policy need to be, or ought to be;
but he used to say, <HI>An Enemy reduced to a Necessity
of Fighting, is half Beaten.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, we were all but young in the War;
the Souldiers hot and forward, and eagerly
desired to come to Hands with the Enemy. But
I take the more Notice of it here, because the
King in this acted against his own Measures; For
it was the King himself had laid the Design of
getting the Start of <HI>Essex,</HI> and marching to <HI>Lon∣don.</HI>
His Friends had invited him thither, and
expected, him and suffered deeply for the Omissi∣on;
and yet he gave way to these hasty Counsels,
and suffered his Judgment to be over-ruled by
Majority of Voices; an Error, I say, the King of
<HI>Sweden</HI> was never guilty of: For if all the Officers
at a Council of War were of a different Opinion,
yet unless their Reasons mastered his Judgment,
their Votes never altered his Measures: But this
was the Error of our good, but unfortunate
Master, three times in this War, and particularly
in two of the greatest Battles of the time, <HI>viz.</HI>
this of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> and that of <HI>Naseby.</HI></P>
<P>The Resolution for Fighting being published
in the Army, gave an universal Joy to the Soldiers,
who expressed an extraordinary Ardour for
Fighting. I remember, my Father talking with
me about it, asked me what I Thought of the ap∣proaching
Battle: I told him, I Thought the King
had done very well; for at that time I did not con∣sult
the Extent of the Design, and had a mighty
Mind, like other rash People, to see it brought to
a Day, which made me answer my Father as I
did: But said I, Sir, <HI>I Doubt there will be but indif∣ferent
Doings on both Sides, between two Armies both
made up of fresh Men, that have never seen any Service.</HI>
<PB N="185" REF="191"/>
My Father minded little what I spoke of that;
but when I seemed pleased that the King had
resolved to fight, he looked angrily at me, and
told me he was sorry I could see no farther into
things. I tell you, says he hastily, <HI>If the King
should kill, and take Prisoners, this whole Army, Gene∣ral
and all, the Parliament will have the Victory; for we
have lost more by slipping this Opportunity of getting into</HI>
London, <HI>than we shall ever get by ten Battles.</HI> I saw
enough of this afterwards to convince me of the
Weight of what my Father said, and so did the
King too; but it was then too late, Advantages
slipt in War are never recovered.</P>
<P>We were now in a full March to fight the Earl
of <HI>Essex.</HI> It was on <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning the 24th of
<HI>October,</HI> 1642, fair Weather over Head, but the
Ground very heavy and dirty. As soon as we
came to the Top of <HI>Edgehill,</HI> we discovered their
whole Army. They were not drawn up, having
had two Miles to march that Morning; but they
were very busy forming their Lines, and po∣sting
the Regiments as they came up. Some of
their Horse were exceedingly fatigued, having
marched 48 Hours together; and had they been
suffered to follow us three or four Days March
farther, several of their Regiments of Horse
would have been quite ruined, and their
Foot would have been rendered unserviceable for
the present. But we had no Patience.</P>
<P>As soon as our whole Army was come to the
Top of the Hill, we were drawn up in Order of
Battle: The King's Army made a very fine Ap∣pearance;
and indeed they were a Body of gal∣lant
Men as ever appeared in the Field, and as
well furnished at all Points: The Horse exceeding
well accoutred, being most of them Gentlemen
and Voluntiers; some whole Regiments serving
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
without Pay. Their Horses very good and fit for
Service as could be desired. The whole Army
were not above 18000 Men, and the Enemy not
a 1000 over or under, though we had been told
they were not above 12000; but they had been
reinforced with 4000 Men from <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>The King was with the General, the Earl of
<HI>Lindsey,</HI> in the Main Battle; Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> com∣manded
the Right Wing, and the Marquess of
<HI>Hertford,</HI> the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> and several other
very good Officers, the Left.</P>
<P>The Signal of Battle being given with two
Cannot Shot, we marched in Order of Battalia
down the Hill, being drawn up in two Lines with
Bodies of Reserve; the Enemy advanced to meet
us much in the same Form, with this Difference
only, that they had placed their Cannon on their
Right, and the King had placed ours in the Cen∣ter,
before, or rather between two great Bri∣gades
of Foot. Their Cannon began with us
first, and did some Mischief among the Dragoons
of our left Wing; but our Officers perceiving
the Shot took the Men, and missed the Horses,
ordered all to alight, and every Man leading his
Horse, to advance in the same Order; and this
saved our Men, for most of the Enemy's Shot flew
over their Heads. Our Cannon made a terrible
Execution upon their Foot for a Quarter of an
Hour, and put them into great Confusion, till the
General obliged them to halt, and changed the
Posture of his Front, marching round a small
rising Ground by which he avoided the Fury of
our Artillery.</P>
<P>By this time the Wings were engaged, the King
having given the Signal of Battle, and ordered
the Right Wing to fall on. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> who as
is said, commanded that Wing, fell on with such
<PB N="187" REF="193"/>
Fury, and pushed the Left Wing of the Parliament
Army so effectually, that in a Moment he filled
all with Terror and Confusion: Comissary General
<HI>Ramsey,</HI> a Scochman, a Low Country Soldier, and
an experienced Officer, commanded their Left
Wing; and though he did all that an expert Sol∣dier,
and a brave Commander could do, yet
'twas to no Purpose; his lines were immediately
broken, and all overwhelmed in a trice: Two
Regiments of Foot, whether as Part of the Left
Wing, or on the Left of the Main Body, I know
not, were disordered by their own Horse, and
rather trampled to Death by the Horses, than
beaten by our Men; but they were so entirely
broken and disordered, that I do not remember
that ever they made one Volley upon our Men;
for their own Horse running away, and falling
foul on these Foot, were so vigorously followed
by our Men, that the Foot never had a Moment
to rally, or look behind them. The Point of the
left Wing of Horse were not so soon broken as
the rest, and three Regiments of them stood firm
for some Time: The dexterous Officers of the
other Regiments taking the Opportunity, ral∣lied
a great many of their scattered Men be∣hind
them, and pieced in some Troops with
those Regiments; but after two or three Charges,
which a Brigade of our second Line following
the Prince, made upon them, they also were
broken with the rest.</P>
<P>I remember, that at the great Battle of <HI>Leip∣sick,</HI>
the Right Wing of the <HI>Imperialists</HI> having fal∣len
in upon the <HI>Saxons</HI> with like Fury to this,
bore down all before them, and beat the <HI>Saxons</HI>
quite out of the Fields; upon which the Soldi∣ers
cried, <HI>Victoria, Let us follow. No, no,</HI> said the
old General <HI>Tilly, let them go, but let us beat the</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="194"/>
Swedes <HI>too, and then all's our own.</HI> Had Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> taken this Method, and instead of follow∣ing
the Fugitives, who were dispersed so
effectually, that two Regiments would have
secured them from rallying; I say, had he fal∣len
in upon the Foot, or wheeled to the Left,
and fallen in upon the Rear of the Enemy's Right
Wing of Horse, or returned to the Assistance of the
Left Wing of our Horse, we had gained the most
absolute and compleat Victory that could be; nor
had 1000 Men of the Enemy's Army got off: But
this Prince, who was full of Fire, and pleased
to see the Rout of the Enemy, pursued them
quite to the Town of <HI>Keynton,</HI> where indeed he
killed Abundance of their Men, <HI>and some Time al∣so
was lost in plundering the Baggage:</HI> But in the
mean Time, the Glory and Advantage of the Day
was lost to the King; for the right Wing of the
Parliament Horse could not be so broken. Sir
<HI>William Balfour</HI> made a desperate Charge upon
the Point of the King's Left; and had it not been
for two Regiments of Dragoons who were plan∣ted
in the Reserve, had routed the whole Wing;
for he broke through the first Line, and stag∣gered
the second, who advanced to their As∣sistance,
but was so warmly received by those
Dragoons, who came seasonably in, and gave their
first Fire on Horseback, that his Fury was check∣ed,
and having lost a great many Men, was forced
to wheel about to his own Men; and had the
King had but three Regiments of Horse at hand,
to have charged him, he had been routed. The rest
of this Wing kept their Ground, and received
the first Fury of the Enemy with great Firm∣ness;
after which, advancing in their Turn, they
were once Masters of the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s Cannon.
And here we lost another Advantage; for if any
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
Foot had been at hand to support these Horse, they
had carried off the Cannon, or turned it upon the
main Battle of the Enemy's Foot; but the Foot
were otherwise engaged. The Horse on this
Side fought with great Obstinacy, and Variety of
Success a great while. Sir <HI>Philip Stapylton,</HI> who
commanded the Guards of the Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> be∣ing
engaged with a Party of our <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> Ca∣valiers,
as we called them, was once in a fair
way to have been cut off by a Brigade of our
Foot, who being advanced to fall on upon the
Parliament's main Body, flanked Sir <HI>Philip</HI>'s Horse
in their way, and facing to the Left, so furiously
charged him with their Pikes, that he was obliged
to retire in great Disorder, and with the Loss
of a great many Men and Horses.</P>
<P>All this while the Foot on both Sides were
desperately engaged, and coming close up to
the Teeth of one another with the clubbed Mus∣quet
and Push of Pike, fought with great Reso∣lution,
and a terrible Slaughter on both Sides, gi∣ving
no Quarter for a great while; and they
continued to do thus, till, as if they were tired,
and out of Wind, either Party seemed willing
enough to leave off, and take Breath. Those
which suffered most were that Brigade which had
charged Sir <HI>William Stapylton</HI>'s Horse, who being
bravely engaged in the Front which the Ene∣my's
Foot, were, on the sudden, charged again
in Front and Flank, by Sir <HI>William Balfour</HI>'s Horse,
and disordered, after a very desperate Defence.
Here the King's Standard was taken, the Stan∣dard-bearer,
Sir <HI>Edward Varney,</HI> being killed; but
it was rescued again by Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> and
brought to the King the same Night, for which
the King Knighted the Captain.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="196"/>
This Brigade of Foot had fought all the Day,
and had not been broken at last, if any Horse had
been at Hand to support them: The Field began
to be now clear, both Armies stood, as it were,
gazing at one another, only the King, having
rallied his Foot, seemed inclined to renew the
Charge, and began to cannonade them, which
they could not return, most of their Cannon
being nailed while they were in our Possessi∣on,
and all the Cannoniers killed or fled, and
our Gunners did Execution upon Sir <HI>William Bal∣four</HI>'s
Troops for a good while.</P>
<P>My Father's Regiment being in the Right
with the Prince, I saw little of the Fight, but
the Rout of the Enemy's Left, and we had as
full a Victory there as we could desire, but spent
too much Time in it; we killed about 2000
Men in that Part of the Action, and having totally
dispersed them, and plundred their Baggage, be∣gan
to think of our Fellows when 'twas too late
to help them. We returned however victorious
to the King, just as the Battle was over; the King
asked the Prince what News? He told him he could
give his Majesty a good Account of the Enemy's
Horse; <HI>ay by G—d, says a Gentleman that stood by me,
and of their Carts too.</HI> That word was spoken with
such a Sense of the Misfortune, and made such
an Impression in the whole Army, that it occa∣sioned
some ill Blood afterwards among us; and
but that the King took up the Business, it had
been of ill Consequence; for some Person who
had heard the Gentleman speak it, informed the
Prince who it was, and the Prince resenting it,
spoke something about it in the hearing of the
Party when the King was present: The Gentle∣man
not at all surprized, told his Highness open∣ly,
he had said the Words; and though he owned
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
he had no Disrespect for his Highness, yet he
could not but say, if it had not been so, the
Enemy's Army had been better beaten. The
Prince replied something very disobliging; upon
which the Gentleman came up to the King, and
kneeling, humbly besought his Majesty to accept
of his Commission, and to give him leave to tell
the Prince, that whenever his Highness pleased,
he was ready to give him Satisfaction. The Prince
was exceedingly provoked, and as he was very
passionate, began to talk very odly, and without
all Government of himself: The Gentleman, as
hold as he, but much calmer, preserved his Tem∣per,
but maintained his Quarrel; and the King
was so concerned, that he was very much out of
Humour with the Prince about it. However,
his Majesty upon Consideration, soon ended the
Dispute, by laying his Commands on them both
to speak no more of it for that Day; and refu∣sing
the Comission from the Collonel, for he was
no less, sent for them both next Morning in pri∣vate,
and made them Friends again.</P>
<P>But to return to our Story, we came back to
the King timely enough to put the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>'s
Men out of all Humour of renewing the Fight;
and as I observed before, both Parties stood ga∣zing
at one another, and our Cannon playing upon
them, obliged Sir <HI>William Balfour</HI>'s Horse to
wheel off in some Disorder, but they returned us
none again; which, as we afterwards understood,
was, as I said before, for want of both Powder
and Gunners; for the Cannoniers and Firemen
were killed, or had quitted their Train in the
Fight, when our Horse had Possession of their
Artillery; and as they had spiked up some of the
Cannon, so they had carryed away 15 Carriages
of Powder.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="198"/>
Night coming on, ended all Discourse of more
fighting; and the King drew off and marched
towards the Hills. I know no other Token of
Victory which the Enemy had, than their lying
in the Field of Battle all Night, which <HI>they did</HI>
for no other Reason, than that having lost their
Baggage and Provisions, they had no where to go;
and which we <HI>did not,</HI> because we had good Quar∣ters
at Hand.</P>
<P>The Number of Prisoners, and of the slain, were
not very unequal; the Enemy lost more Men,
we most of Quality. Six Thousand Men on both
Sides were killed on the Spot, whereof, when our
Rolls were examined, we missed 2500. We lost
our brave General the old Earl of <HI>Lindsey,</HI> who
was wounded and taken Prisoner, and died of his
Wounds; Sir <HI>Edward Stradling,</HI> Collonel <HI>Lunds∣ford,</HI>
Prisoners; and Sir <HI>Edward Varney,</HI> and a
great many Gentlemen of Quality slain. On the
other Hand, we carried off Collonel <HI>Essex,</HI> Collo∣nel
<HI>Ramsey,</HI> and the Lord St. <HI>John,</HI> who also died
of his Wounds; we took five Ammunition Wag∣gons,
full of Powder, and brought off about 500
Horse in the Defeat of the Left Wing, with
18 Standards and Colours, and lost 17.</P>
<P>The Slaughter of the Left Wing was so great,
and the Flight so effectual, that several of the
Officers rid clear away, coasting round, and got
to <HI>London,</HI> where they reported, that the Parlia∣ment
Army was entirely defeated, all lost, killed,
or taken, as if none but them were left alive
to carry the News. This filled them with Con∣sternation
for a while; but when other Messen∣gers
followed, all was restored to Quiet again, and
the Parliament cried up their Victory, and
sufficiently mocked God and their General, with
their publick Thanks for it. Truly, as the Fight
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
was a Deliverance to them, they were in the
right to give Thanks for it; but as to its being
a Victory, neither Side had much to boast of, and
they less a great deal than we had.</P>
<P>I got no Hurt in this Fight; and indeed we of
the Right Wing had but little fighting; I think
I discharged my Pistols but once, and my Carabin
twice, for we had more Fatigue than Fight; the
Enemy fled, and we had little to do but to fol∣low
and kill those we could overtake. I spoiled
a good Horse, and got a better from the Enemy
in his Room, and came home weary enough. My
Father lost his Horse, and in the Fall was bruised
in his Thigh by another Horse, treading on him,
which disabled him for some Time, and, at his
Request, by his Majesty's Consent, I commanded
the Regiment in his Absence.</P>
<P>The Enemy received a Recruit of 4000 Men
the next Morning; if they had not, I believe they
had gone back towards <HI>Worcester;</HI> but, encouraged
by that Reinforcement, they called a Council of
War, and had a long Debate whether they could
attack us again? but notwithstanding their great
Victory, they durst not attempt it, though this
Addition of Strength made them superiour to
us by 3000 Men.</P>
<P>The King indeed expected, that when these
Troops joined them they would advance, and we
were preparing to receive them at a Village
called <HI>Aino,</HI> where the Head Quarter conti∣nued
three or four Days; and had they really
esteemed the first Day's Work a Victory, as they
called it, they would have done it, but they
thought not good to venture, but march away
to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Coventry.</HI> The King,
to urge them to venture upon him, and come to a
second Battle▪ sits down before <HI>Banbury,</HI> and takes
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
both Town and Castle, and two entire Regiments
of Foot, and one Troop of Horse, quit the Par∣liament
Service, and take up their Arms for the
King. This was done almost before their Faces,
which was a better Proof of a Victory on our
Side, than any they could pretend to. From <HI>Ban∣bury</HI>
we marched to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and now all Men
saw the Parliament had made a great Mistake,
<HI>for they were not always in the right any more than we,</HI>
to leave <HI>Oxford</HI> without a Garrison. The King
caused new regular Works to be drawn round
it, and seven royal Bastions with Ravelins and
and Out-works, a double Ditch, Counterscarp
and Covered Way; all which added to the Ad∣vantage
of its Situation, made it a formidable
Place, and from this Time it became our Place
of Arms, and the Center of Affairs on the King's
Side.</P>
<P>If the Parliament had the Honour of the
Field, the King reaped the Fruits of the Victo∣ry;
for all this Part of the Country submitted to
him: <HI>Essex</HI>'s Army made the best of their Way
to <HI>London,</HI> and were but in an ill Condition when
they came there, especially their Horse.</P>
<P>The Parliament, sensible of this, and receiving
daily Accounts of the Progress we made, began
to cool a little in their Temper, abated of their
first Rage, and voted an Address for Peace; and
sent to the King, to let him know they were
desirous to prevent the Effusion of more Blood,
and to bring things to an Accommodation, or, as
they called it, a <HI>Right Ʋnderstanding.</HI></P>
<P>I was now, by the King's particular Favour,
summoned to the Councils of War, my Father
continuing absent and ill; and now I began to
think of the real Grounds, and which was more,
of the fatal Issue of this War. I say, I now be∣gan
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
it; for I cannot say that I ever rightly sta∣ted
Matters in my own Mind before, though I
had been enough used to Blood, and to see the De∣struction
of People, sacking of Towns, and plun∣dering
the Country; yet 'twas in <HI>Germany,</HI> and
among Strangers; but I found a strange secret
and unaccountable Sadness upon my Spirits to see
this acting in my own native Country. It grie∣ved
me to the Heart, even in the Rout of our
Enemies, to see the Slaughter of them; and even
in the Fight, to hear a Man cry for Quarter in
<HI>English,</HI> moved me to a Compassion which I had
never been used to; nay, sometimes it looked to
me as if some of my own Men had been beaten; and
when I heard a Soldier cry, <HI>O God, I am shot,</HI> I
looked behind me to see which of my own Troop
was fallen. Here I saw my self at the cutting
of the Throats of my Friends; and indeed some
of my near Relations. My old Comerades and
Fellow-soldiers in <HI>Germany</HI> were some <HI>with us,</HI> some
<HI>against us,</HI> as their Opinions happened to differ
an Religion. For my part, I confess I had not
much Religion in me, at that time; but I
thought Religion rightly practised on both Sides
would have made us all better Friends; and there∣fore
sometimes I began to think, that both the
Bishops of our Side, and the Preachers on theirs,
made Religion rather <HI>the Pretence</HI> than <HI>the Cause</HI>
of the War; and from those Thoughts I vigorou∣sly
argued it at the Council of War against
marching to <HI>Brentford,</HI> while the Address for a
Treaty of Peace from the Parliament was in Hand;
for I was for taking the Parliament by the Handle
which they had given us, and entring into a
Negotiation with the Advantage of its being
<HI>at their own Request.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="202"/>
I thought the King had now in his Hands an
Opportunity to make an honourable Peace; for
this Battle at <HI>Edgchill,</HI> as much as they boasted
of the Victory to hearten up their Friends, had
sorely weakened their Army, and discouraged
their Party too, which in Effect was worse as to
their Army. The Horse were particularly in an
ill Case, and the Foot greatly diminished; and
the Remainder very sickly: But besides this, the
Parliament, were greatly alarmed at the Progress
we made afterward; and still fearing the King's
surprizing them, had sent for the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>
to <HI>London,</HI> to defend them; by which the Coun∣try
was as it were, deserted and abandoned, and
left to be plundered; our Parties over-run all
Places at Pleasure. All this while I considered,
that whatever the Soldiers of Fortune meant by
the War, our Desires were to suppress the ex∣orbitant
Power of a Party, to establish our King
in his just and legal Rights; but not with a De∣sign
to destroy the Constitution of Government,
and the Being of Parliament; and therefore I
thought now was the Time for Peace, and their
were a great many worthy Gentlemen in the
Army of my Mind; and, had our Master had
Ears to hear us, the War might have had an
End here.</P>
<P>This Address for Peace was received by the
King at <HI>Maidenhead,</HI> whither this Army was
now advanced, and his Majesty returned Answer
by Sir Peter Killegrem, that he desired nothing
more, and would not be wanting on his Part.
Upon this the Parliament name Commissioners,
and his Majesty excepting against Sir <HI>John
Evelyn,</HI> they left him out, and sent others; and
desired the King to appoint his Residence near
<HI>London,</HI> where the Commissioners might wait
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
upon him. Accordingly the King appointed
<HI>Windsor</HI> for the Place of Treaty, and desired the
Treaty might be haftened. And thus all things
looked with a favourable Aspect, when one un∣lucky
Action knocked it all on the Head, and
filled both Parties with more implacable Ani∣mosities
than they had before, and all Hopes of
Peace vanished.</P>
<P>During this Progress of the King's Armies, we
were always abroad with the Horse ravaging the
Country, aud plundering the Roundheads. Prince
<HI>Ruport,</HI> a most active vigilant Party-man, and I
must own, fitter for such than for a General, was
never lying still, and I seldom stayed behind; for
our Regiment being very well mounted, he
would always send for us, if he had any extraor∣dinary
Design in Hand.</P>
<P>One time in particular he had a Design upon
<HI>Alisbury,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Buckinghamshire;</HI> indeed
our View at first was rather to beat the Enemy
out of Town and demolish their Works, and per∣haps
raise some Contributions on the rich Coun∣try
round it, than to Garrison the Place, and keep
it; for we wanted no more Garrisons, being
Masters of the Field.</P>
<P>The Prince had 2500 Horse with him in
this Expedition, but no Foot; the Town had
sme Foot raised in the Country by Mr. <HI>Hamb∣den,</HI>
and two Regiments of the Country Militia,
whom we made light of, but we found they stood
to their Tackle better than <HI>well enough.</HI> We
came very early to the Town, and thought they
had no Notice of us; but some false Brother had
given them the Alarm and we found them all in
Arms, the Hedges without the Town lined with
Musqueteers, on that Side in particular where
they expected, us, and the two Regiments of Foot
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
drawn up in View to support them, with some
Horse in the Rear of all.</P>
<P>The Prince willing however to do some thing,
caused some of his Horse to alight, and serve as
Dragoons; and having broken a Way into the
Enclosures, the Horse beat the Foot from behind
the Hedges, while the rest who were alighted
charged them in the Lane which leads to the
Town. Here they had cast up some Works, and
fired from their Lines very regularly, considering
them as Militia only, the Governour encouraging
them by his Example; so that finding without
some Foot there would be no good to be done, we
gave it over, and drew off; and so <HI>Alisbury</HI> scaped a
scouring for that Time.</P>
<P>I cannot deny but these flying Parties of Horse
committed great Spoil among the Country Peo∣ple;
and sometimes the Prince gave a Liberty to
some Cruelties which were not at all for the
King's Interest; because it being still upon our
own Country, and the King's own Subjects,
whom, in all his Declarations, he protested to be
careful of. It seemed to contradict all those pro∣testations
and Declarations, and served to aggra∣vate
and exasperate the Common People; and
the King's Enemies made all the Advantages of
it that was possible, by crying out of twice as
many Extravagancies as were committed.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the King, who naturally abhorred
such thing, could not restrain his Men, no nor
his Generals, so absolutely as he would have
done. The War, on his Side, was very much
<HI>a la Voluntier;</HI> many Gentlemen served him at
their own Charge, and some paid whole Regi∣ments
themselves: Sometimes also the King's
Affairs were straiter than ordinary, and his
Men were not very well paid, and this obliged
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
him to wink at their Excursions upon the Coun∣try,
though he did not approve of them; and
yet I must own, that in those Parts of <HI>England</HI>
were the War was hottest, there never was seen
that Ruin and Depopulation, Murthers, Ravish∣ments,
and Barbarities, which I have seen even
among Protestant Armies abroad in <HI>Germany,</HI> and
other foreign Parts of the World. And if the
Parliament People had seen those things abroad,
as I had, they would not have complained.</P>
<P>The most I have seen was plundering the
Towns for Provisions, drinking up their Beer,
and turning our Horses into their Fields, or
Stacks of Corn; and sometimes the Soldiers would
be a little rude with the Wenches; but alas
what was this to Count <HI>Tilly</HI>'s Ravages in <HI>Saxony?</HI>
Or what was our taking of <HI>Leicester</HI> by Storm,
where they cried out of our Barbarities, to the
sacking of <HI>New Brandenburgh,</HI> or the taking of
<HI>Magdeburgh?</HI> In <HI>Leicester,</HI> of 7 or 8000 Peple in
the Town, 300 were killed; in <HI>Megdeburgh,</HI> of
25000 scarce 2700 were left, and the whole
Town burnt to Ashes. I my self, have seen 17
or 18 Villages on Fire in a Day, and the People
driven away from their Dwellings, like Herds of
Cattle; the Men murthered, the Women stript;
and, 7 or 800 of them together, after they had
suffered all the Indignities and Abuses of the
Soldiers, driven starknaked in the Winter through
the great Towns, to seek Shelter and Relief
from the Charity of their Enemies. I do not
instance these greater Barbarities to justify lesser
Actions, which are nevertheless irregular; but,
<HI>I do say,</HI> that Circumstances considered, this War
was managed with as much Humanity on both
Sides as could be expected, especially also con∣sidering
the Animosity of Parties.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="206"/>
But to Return to the Prince, he had not always
the same Success in these Enterprizes, for some∣times
we came short home. And I cannot omit one
pleasant Adventure which happened to a Party
of ours in one of these Excursions into <HI>Buck∣inghamshire.</HI>
The Major of our Regiment was
soundly beaten by a Party which, as I may say
was led by a Woman; and, if I had not rescued
him, I know not but he had been taken Prisoner
by a Woman. It seems our Men had besieged
some fortified House about <HI>Oxfordshire,</HI> towards
<HI>Tame,</HI> and the House being defended by the Lady
in her Husband's Absence, she had yielded the
House upon a Capitulation; one of the Articles
of which was, to march out with all her Servants,
Soldiers, and Goods, and to be convey'd to <HI>Tame:</HI>
Whether she thought to have gone no farther,
or that she reckoned her self safe there, I know
not; but my Major, with two Troops of Horse
meets with this Lady and her Party, about five
Miles from <HI>Tame,</HI> as we were coming back from
our defeated Attack of <HI>Alisbury.</HI> We reckoned
our selves in an Enemy's Country, and had lived
a little at large, or at Discretion, <HI>as 'tis called
abroad;</HI> and these two Troops with the Major, were
returning to our Detachment from a little Vil∣lage,
where, at a Farmer's House, they had met
with some Liquor, and truly some of his Men
were so drunk they could but lust sit upon their
Horses. The Major himself was not much bet∣ter,
and the whole Body were but in a sorry
Condition to fight. Upon the Road they meet this
Party; the Lady having no Design of Fighting,
and being as she thought under the Protection of
the Articles, sounds a Parley, and desired to
speak with the Officer. The Major <HI>as drunk as
be was,</HI> could tell her, that by the Articles she
<PB N="201" REF="207"/>
was to be assured no farther than <HI>Tame,</HI> and be∣ing
now five Miles beyond it, she was a fair
Enemy, and therefore demanded to render them∣selves
Prisoners. The Lady seemed surprized,
but being sensible she was in the wrong, offered
to compound for her Goods, and would have
given him 300 1. and, I think, seven or eight
Horses: The Major would certainly have taken
it, if he had not been drunk; but he refused it,
and gave threatning Words to her, blustering in
Language which he thought proper to fright a
Woman, <HI>viz.</HI> that he would cut them all to
Pieces, and give no Quarter, <HI>and the like.</HI> The
Lady, who had been more used to the Smell of
Powder than he imagined, called some of her
Servants to her; and consulting with them what
to do, they all unanimously encouraged her to
let them fight; told her, it was plain that the
Commander was drunk, and all that were with
him were rather worse than, he, and hardly
able to sit their Horses; and that therefore one
bold Charge would put them all into Confusion.
<HI>In a Word,</HI> she consented, and, as she was a Wo∣man,
they desired her to secure her self among
the Waggons; but she refused, and told them
bravely, she would take her Eate with them.
<HI>In short,</HI> she boldly bad my Major Defiance, and
that he might do his worst, since she had of∣fered
him fair, and he had refused it; her
Mind was altered now, and she would give him
nothing, and bad his Officer that parlied longer
with her, be gone; so the Parly ended. After
this, she gave him fair Leave to go back to his Men;
but before he could tell his Tale to them, she was
at his Heels, with all her Men, and gave him
such a home Charge as put his Men into Dis∣order;
and, being too drunk to rally, they were
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
knocked down before they knew what to do
with themselves; and, in a few Minutes more,
they took to a plain Flight. But what was
still worse, the Men, being some of them very
drunk, when they came to run for their Lives,
fell over one another, and tumbled over their
Horses, and made such Work, that a Troop of
Women might have beaten them all. In this
Pickle, with the Enemy at his Heels, I came
in with him, hearing the Noise; when I ap∣peared,
the Pursuers retreated, and, seeing what
a Condition my People were in, and not know∣ing
the Strength of the Enemy, I contented my
self with bringing them off without pursuing
the other; nor could I ever hear positively
who this Female Captain was. We lost 17 or
18 of our Men, and about 30 Horses; but when
the Particulars of the Story were told us, our
Major was so laughed at by the whole Army,
and laughed at every where, that he was a∣shamed
to shew himself for a Week or a Fort∣night
after.</P>
<P>But, to return to the King; his Majesty, <HI>as
I observed,</HI> was at <HI>Maidenhead</HI> addressed by the
Parliament for Peace, and <HI>Windsor</HI> being appoin∣ted
for the Place of Treaty, the Van of his Ar∣my
lay at <HI>Colebrook.</HI> In the mean time, whether
it were true, or only a Pretence, but it was re∣ported
the Parliament General had sent a Body
of his Troops, with a Train of Artillery, to <HI>Ham∣mersmith,</HI>
in order to fall upon some part of our
Army, or to take some advanced Post, which was
to the Prejudice of our Men; whereupon the
King ordered the Army to march, and, by the
Favour of a thick Mist, came within half a Mile
of <HI>Brentford</HI> before he was discovered. There
were two Regiments of Foot, and about 600
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
Horse in the Town, of the Enemy's best Troops;
these taking the Alarm, posted themselves on
the Bridge at the West End of the Town. The
King attacked them with a select Detachment
of his best Infantry, and they defended them∣selves
with incredible Obstinacy. I must own,
I never saw <HI>raw Men,</HI> for they could not have
been in Arms above four Months, act like them
in my Life. <HI>In short,</HI> there was no forcing these
Men; for, though two whole Brigades of our
Foot, backed by our Horse, made five several
Attacks upon them, they could not break them,
and we lost a great many brave Men in that
Action. At last, seeing the Obstinacy of these
Men, a Party of Horse was ordered to go round
from <HI>Osterly;</HI> and, entering the Town on the
North Side, where, though the Horse made
some Resistance, it was not considerable, the
Town was presently taken. I led my Regiment
through an Enclosure, and came into the Town
nearer to the Bridge than the rest, by which
Means I got first into the Town; but I had
this Loss by my Expedition, that the Foot
charged me before the Body was come up, and
pouring in their Shot very furiously, my Men
were but in an ill Case, and would not have
ftood much longer, if the rest of the Horse co∣ming
up the Lane had not found them other
Employment. When the Horse were thus en∣tered,
they immediately dispersed the Enemy's
Horse, who fled away towards <HI>London,</HI> and fal∣ling
in Sword in Hand upon the Rear of the
Foot, who were engaged at the Bridge, they
were all cut in Pieces, except about 200, who
scorning to ask Quarter, desperately threw them∣selves
into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> where they were
most of them drowned.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="210"/>
The Parliament, and their Party, made a great
Outcry at this Attempt; that it was base and
treacherous while in a Treaty of Peace; and
that the King, having amused them with hearken∣ing
to a Treaty, designed to have seized upon
their Train of Artillery first, and after that, to
have surprized both the City of <HI>London</HI> and the
Parliament. And I have observed since, that
our Historians note this Action as contrary to
the Laws of Honour and Treaties; though as
there was no Cessation of Arms agreed on, no∣thing
is more contrary to the Laws of War
than to suggest it.</P>
<P>That it was a very unhappy thing to the
King and whole Nation, as it broke off the
Hopes of Peace, and was the Occasion of bring∣ing
the <HI>Scots</HI> Army in upon us, I readily acknow∣ledge;
but that there was any thing dishonou∣rable
in it, I cannot allow: For though the Par∣liament
had addressed to the King for Peace,
and such Steps were taken in it, as before; yet,
as I have said, there was no Proposals made on
either Side for a Cessation of Arms; and all the
World must allow, that in such Cases the War
goes on in the Field, while the Peace goes on
in the Cabinet. And if the War goes on, ad∣mit
the King had designed to surprize the City
or Parliament, or all of them, it had been no
more than the Custom of War allows, and what
they would have done by him, if they could.
The Treaty of <HI>Westphalia,</HI> or Peace of <HI>Munster,</HI>
which ended the bloody Wars of <HI>Germany,</HI> was
a Precedent for this. That Treaty was actually
negotiating feven Years, and yet the War went
on with all the Vigour and Rancour imaginable,
even to the last: Nay, the very Time after the
Conclusion of it, but before the News could be
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
brought to the Army, did he that was afterwards
King of <HI>Sweden, Carolus Gustavus,</HI> take the City of
<HI>Prague,</HI> by Surprize, and therein an inestimable
Booty. Besides, all the Wars of <HI>Europe</HI> are full
of Examples of this Kind; and therefore I cannot
see any Reason to blame the King for this Action
as to the Fairness of it. Indeed as to the Policy
of it, I can say little; but the Case was this, the
King had a gallant Army, flushed with Success,
and things hitherto had gone on very prospe∣rously,
both with his own Army and elsewhere;
he had above 35000 Men in his own Army,
including his Garrisons left at <HI>Banbury, Shrewsbury,
Worcester, Oxford, Wallingford, Abbingdon, Reading,</HI>
and Places adjacent. On the other Hand, the
Parliament Army came back to <HI>London</HI> in but a
very<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note, General <HI>Ludlow,</HI> in his Memoirs, p. 52. says, their Men returned from <HI>Warwick</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> not like Men who had obtained a Victory, but like Men that had been beaten.</NOTE> sorry Condition; for what with their
Loss <HI>in their Victory, as they called it, at</HI> Edgehill,
their Sickness, and a hasty March to <HI>London,</HI> they
were very much diminished; though at <HI>London</HI>
they soon recruited them again. And this Pro∣sperity
of the King's Affairs might encourage
him to strike this Blow, thinking to bring the
Parliament to the better Terms, by the Appre∣hensions
of the superior Strength of the King's
Forces.</P>
<P>But <HI>however it was,</HI> the Success did not equal∣ly
answer the King's Expectation; the vigorous
Defence the Troops posted at <HI>Brentford</HI> made as
above, gave the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> Opportunity, with
extraordinary Application, to draw his Forces
out to <HI>Turnham-Green;</HI> and the exceeding Alacri∣ty
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
of the Enemy was such, that their whole
Army appeared with them, making together an
Army of 24000 Men, drawn up in View of our
Forces, by 8 o' Clock the next Morning. The
City Regiments were placed between the regular
Troops, and all together offered us Battle, but
we were not in a Condition to accept it. The
King indeed was sometimes of the Mind to charge
them, and once or twice ordered Parties to ad∣vance
to begin to skirmish; but upon better
Advice, altered his Mind; and indeed it was the
wiseft Counsel to defer the fighting at that Time.
The Parliament Generals were as unfixed in their
Resolutions on the other Side, as the King: Some∣times
they sent out Parties, and then called them
back again. One strong Party, of near 3000
Men marched off towards <HI>Action,</HI> with Orders
to amuse us on that Side, but were counter∣manded.
Indeed I was of the Opinion, we might
have ventured the Battle; for though the Parlia∣ment's
Army were more numerous, yet the City
Trained-Bands, which made up 4000 of their
Foot, were not much esteemed, and the King was
a great deal stronger in Horse than they; but
the main Reason that hindred the Engagement,
was want of Ammunition, which the King ha∣ving
duly weighed, he caused the Carriages and
Cannon to draw off first, and then the Foot, the
Horse continuing to face the Enemy till all was
clear gone, and then we drew off too, and mar∣ched
to <HI>Kingston,</HI> and the next Day to <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P>Now the King saw his Mistake, in not conti∣nuing
his March for <HI>London,</HI> instead of Facing
about to fight the Enemy at <HI>Edgehill.</HI> And all
the Honour we had gained in so many successful
Enterprizes lay buried in this shameful Retreat
from an Army of Citizens Wives: For, truly
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
that Appearance at <HI>Turnham-Green</HI> was gay, but
not great. There was as many Lookers on as
Actors; the Crouds of Ladies, 'Prentices and Mob
was so great, that when the Parties of our Army
advanced, and, as they thought, to Charge, the
Coaches, Horsemen, and Croud, that cluttered
away, to be out of Harm's way, looked little
better than a Rout: And I was perswaded a good
home Charge from our Horse would have sent
their whole Army after them; but so it was,
that this Croud of an Army was to triumph
over us, and they did it; for all the Kingdom was
carefully informed how their dreadful Looks had
frightened us away.</P>
<P>Upon our Retreat, the Parliament resent this
Attack, which they called treacherous, and vote
no Accommodation; but they considered of it
afterwards, and sent six Commissioners to the
King with Propositions; but the Change of the
Scene of Action changed the Terms of Peace;
and now they made Terms like Conquerors,
petition him to desert his Army, and return to
the Parliament, and the like. Had his Majesty, at
the Head of his Army, with the full Reputation
they had before, and in the Ebb of their Affairs,
rested at <HI>Windsor,</HI> and commenced a Treaty, they
had certainly made more reasonable Proposals;
but now the Scabbard seemed to be thrown
away on both Sides.</P>
<P>The rest of the Winter was spent in strength∣ening
Parties, and Places also in fruitless Treaties
of Peace, Messages, Remonstrances, and Paper
War on both Sides, and no Action remarkable
happened any where that I remember: Yet the
King gained Ground every where, and his For∣ces
in the <HI>North</HI> encreased under the Earl of
<HI>Newcastle;</HI> also my Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> then only called
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>
Collonel <HI>Goring,</HI> arrived from <HI>Holland,</HI> bringing
three Ships loaden with Arms and Ammunition,
and Notice, that the Queen was following with
more. <HI>Goring</HI> brought 4000 Barrels of Gunpow∣der,
and 20000 small Arms; all which came
very seasonably, for the King was in great want
of them, especally the Powder. Upon this Re∣cruit
the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> draws down to <HI>York,</HI>
and being above 16000 strong, made Sir <HI>Thomas
Fairfax</HI> give Ground, and retreat to <HI>Hull.</HI></P>
<P>Whoever lay still, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was always
abroad, and I chose to go out with his High∣ness
as often as I had Opportunity; for hitherto
he was always successful. About this Time the
Prince, being at <HI>Oxford,</HI> I gave him Intelligence
of a Party of the Enemy who lived a little at
large, too much for good Soldiers, about <HI>Ciren∣cester:</HI>
The Prince glad of the News, resolved to
attack them, and though it was a wet Season,
and the Ways exceeding bad, being in <HI>February,</HI>
yet we marched all Night in the Dark, which
occasioned the Loss of some Horses and Men too,
in Sloughs and Holes, which the Darkness of the
Night had suffered them to fall into. We were
a very strong Party, being about 3000 Horse and
Dragoons, and coming to <HI>Cirencester</HI> very early
in the Morning, to our great Satisfaction the Ene∣my
were perfectly surprized, not having the least
Notice of our March, which answered our End
more Ways than one. However, the Earl of
<HI>Stamford</HI>'s Regiment made some Resistance; but
the Town having no Works to defend it, saving
a slight Breaft-Work at the Entrance of the
Road, with a Turn-pike, our Dragoons alighted,
and forcing their Way over the Bellies of <HI>Stam∣ford</HI>'s
Foot, they beat them from their Defence,
and followed them at their Heels into the Town;
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
<HI>Stamford</HI>'s Regiment was entirely cut in Pieces,
and several others, to the Number of about
800 Men, and the Town entered without any
other Resistance. We took 1200 Prisoners, 3000
Arms, and the County Magazin, which at that
was considerable; for there was about 120 Bar∣rels
of Powder, and all things in Proportion.</P>
<P>I received the first Hurt I got in this War,
at this Action; for having followed the Dragoons,
and brought my Regiment within the Barricado
which they had gained, a Musquet Bullet struck
my Horse just in the Head; and that so effectu∣ally,
that he fell down as dead as a Stone, all at
once. The Fall plunged me into a Puddle of
Water, and daubed me; and my Man having
brought me another Horse, and cleaned me
a little, I was just getting up, when another
Bullet strook me on my left Hand, which I had
just clapt on the Horse's Mane, to list my self
into the Saddle. The Blow broke one of my
Fingers, and bruised my Hand very much, and
it proved a very painful Hurt to me. For the
present I did not much concern my self about
it, but made my Man tye it up close in my
Handkerchief, and led up my Men to the Mar∣ket
Place, where we had a very smart Brush
with some Musqueteers who were posted in the
Church-yard; but our Dragoons soon beat them
out there, and the whole Town was then our
own. We made no Stay here, but marched back
with all our Booty to <HI>Oxford,</HI> for we knew the
Enemy were very strong at <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and that
way.</P>
<P>Much about the same Time, the Earl of <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI>
with a strong Party, set upon <HI>Litchfield,</HI>
and took the Town, but could not take the Close;
but they beat a Body of 4000 Men coming to
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
the Relief of the Town, under Sir <HI>John Gell</HI> of
<HI>Darbyshire</HI> and Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and
killing 600 of them, dispersed the rest.</P>
<P>Our second Compaign now began to open;
the King marched from <HI>Oxford</HI> to relieve <HI>Read∣ing,</HI>
which was besieged by the Parliament For∣ces;
but Collonel <HI>Fielding,</HI> Lieutenant Gover∣nour,
Sir <HI>Arthur Ashton</HI> being wounded, surren∣dred
to <HI>Essex</HI> before the King could come up;
for which he was tried by Martial Law, and
condemned to die; but the King forbore to exe∣cute
the Sentence. This was the first Town we had
lost in the War; for still the Success of the
King's Affairs was very encouraging. This bad
News however was over-balanced by an Account
brought the King at the same time, by an Ex∣press
from <HI>York,</HI> that the Queen had landed in
the <HI>North,</HI> and had brought over a great Magazin
of Arms and Ammunition, besides some Men.
Some time after this, her Majesty marching
Southward to meet the King, joined the Army
near <HI>Edgehill,</HI> where the first Battle was fought.
She brought the King 3000 Foot, 1500 Horse
and Dragoons, six Pieces of Cannon, 1500 Barrels
of Powder, 12000 small Arms.</P>
<P>During this Prosperity of the King's Affairs,
his Armies encreased mightily in the Western
Counties also. Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> indeed comman∣ded
for the Parliament in those Parts too, and
particularly in <HI>Dorsetshire, Hampshire, and Berk∣shire,</HI>
where he carried on their Cause but too
fast; but farther West, Sir <HI>Nicholas Flamming,</HI> Sir
<HI>Ralph Hapton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Bevil Greenvil,</HI> had exten∣ded
the King's Quarters from <HI>Cornwall</HI> through
<HI>Devonshire,</HI> and into <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> where they took
<HI>Excter, Barnstable,</HI> and <HI>Biddiford;</HI> and the first
of these they fortified very well, making it a Place
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
of Arms for the West, and afterwards it was
the Residence of the Queen.</P>
<P>At last, the Famous Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> and
the King's Forces met, and came to a pitched
Battle, where Sir <HI>William</HI> lost all his Honour
again. This was at <HI>Roundway-down</HI> in <HI>Wiltshire.
Waller</HI> had engaged our <HI>Cornish</HI> Army at <HI>Lans∣down,</HI>
and in a very obstinate Fight had the
better of them, and made them retreat to
the <HI>Devizes.</HI> Sir <HI>William Hopton</HI> however ha∣ving
a good Body of Foot untouched, sent Ex∣presses
and Messengers one in the Neck of
another to the King for some Horse, and the
King being in great Concern for that Army,
who were composed of the Flower of the <HI>Cornish</HI>
Men, commanded me to march with all possible
Secresy, as well as Expedition, with 1200 Horse
and Dragoons from <HI>Oxford,</HI> to join them. We set
out in the Depth of the Night, to avoid; if pos∣sible,
any Intelligence being given of our Rout,
and soon joined with the <HI>Cornish</HI> Army, when it
was as soon resolved to give Battle to <HI>Waller;</HI> and,
give him his due, he was as forward to fight as
we. As it is easy to meet when both Sides are
willing to be found, Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> met us up∣on
<HI>Roundway-down,</HI> where we had a fair Field
on both Sides, and Room enough to draw up
our Horse. In a Word, there was little Cere∣mony
to the Work; the Armies joined, and we
charged his Horse with so much Resolution, that
they quickly fled, and quitted the Field; for
we over-matched him in Horse, and this was
the entire Destruction of their Army: For their
Infantry, which out-numbered ours by 1500,
were now at our Mercy; some faint Resistance
they made, just enough to give us Occasion to
break into their Ranks with our Horse, where
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
we gave Time to our Foot to defeat others that
stood to their Work: Upon which they began
to disband, and run every Way they could;
but our Horse having surrounded them, we
made a fearful Havock of them.</P>
<P>We lost not above 200 Men in this Action;
<HI>Waller</HI> lost abovie 4000 killed and taken, and as
many dispersed that never returned to their
Colours: Those of Foot that escaped got into
<HI>Bristol,</HI> and <HI>Waller,</HI> with the poor Remains of his
routed Regiments, got to <HI>London;</HI> so that it is
plain some run East, and some run West, that
is to say, they fled every Way they could.</P>
<P>My going with this Detachment prevented
my being at the Siege of <HI>Bristol,</HI> which Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> attacked much about the same Time, and
it surrendered in three Days. The Parliament
questioned Collonel <HI>Nathaniel Fienns,</HI> the Governor,
and had him tried as a Coward by a Court Martial,
and condemned to die, but suspended the Execu∣tion
also, as the King did the Governor of <HI>Reading.</HI>
I have often heard Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> say, they did Collo∣nel
<HI>Fienns</HI> wrong in that Affair; and that if the Col∣lonel
would have summoned him, he would have
demanded a Passport of the Parliament, and have
come up and convinced the Court, that Collonel
<HI>Fienns</HI> had not misbehaved himself; and that he had
not a sufficient Garrison to defend a City of that
Extent; having not above 1200 Men in the Town,
excepting some of <HI>Waller</HI>'s Runaways, most of whom
were unfit for Service, and without Arms; and that
the Citizens in general being disaffected to him,
and ready on the first Occasion to open the Gates
to the King's Forces, it was impossible for him
to have kept the City; and <HI>when I had farther in∣formed
them,</HI> said the Prince, <HI>of the Measures I had
taken for a general Assault the next Day, I am confi∣dent
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
I should have convinc'd them, that I had taken
the City by Storm, if he had not surrendered.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Affairs were now in a very good
Posture, and three Armies in the North, West,
and in the Center, counted in the Musters above
70000 Men, besides small Garrisons and Parties
abroad. Several of the Lords, and more of the
Commons, began to fall off from the Parliament,
and make their Peace with the King; and the
Affairs of the Parliament began to look very
ill. The City of <HI>London</HI> was their inexhaustible
Support and Magazine, both for Men, Money,
and all things necessary; and whenever their
Army was out of Order, the Clergy of their
Party in but one <HI>Sunday</HI> or two, would preach
the young Citizens out of their Shops, the La∣bourers
from their Masters, into the Army, and
recruit them on a sudden: And all this was still
owing to the Omission I first observed, of not
marching to <HI>London,</HI> when it might have been so
easily effected.</P>
<P>We had now another, or a faire Oppottunity,
than before, but, as ill Use was made of it. The
King, as I have observed, was in a very good
Posture; he had three large Armies roving at
large over the Kingdom. The <HI>Cornish</HI> Army,
Victorious and Numerous, had beaten <HI>Waller,</HI>
secured and fortified <HI>Exeter,</HI> which the Queen
had made her Residence, and was there deli∣vered
of a Daughter, the Princess <HI>Henrietta Ma∣ria,</HI>
afterwards Dutchess of <HI>Orleans,</HI> and Mother
of the Dutchess Dowager of <HI>Savoy,</HI> commonly
known in the <HI>French</HI> Stile by the Title of <HI>Madam
Royal. They had</HI> secured <HI>Salisbury, Sherbon</HI> Castle,
<HI>Weymouth, Winchester,</HI> and <HI>Basing-house,</HI> and com∣manded
the whole Country, except <HI>Bridgewater</HI> and
<HI>Taunton, Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Linn;</HI> all which Places they
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
held blocked up. The King was also entirely
Master of all <HI>Wales, Monmouthshire, Cheshire, Shrop∣shire,
Staffordshire, Worcestershire, Oxfordshire, Berk∣shire,</HI>
and all the Towns from <HI>Windsor</HI> up the
<HI>Thames to Cirencester,</HI> except <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Henly;</HI>
and of the Whole <HI>Severn,</HI> except <HI>Gloucester.</HI></P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> had Garrisons in every
strong Place in the <HI>North,</HI> from <HI>Berwick</HI> upon
<HI>Tweed,</HI> to <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and <HI>Newark</HI> upon
<HI>Trent, Hull</HI> only excepted, whither the Lord <HI>Fair∣fax</HI>
and his Son Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> were retreated, their
Troops being routed and broken, Sir <HI>Thomas Fair∣fax</HI>
his Baggage with his Lady and Servants
taken Prisoners, and himself hardly escaping.</P>
<P>And now a great Council of War was held in
the King's Quarters, what Enterprize to go up∣on;
and it happened to be the very same Day
when the Parliament were in a serious Debate
what should become of them, and whose Help
they should seek? And indeed they had Cause
for it; and had our Counsels been as ready and
well grounded as theirs, we had put an End to
the War in a Month's time.</P>
<P>In this Council the King proposed the March∣ing
to <HI>London,</HI> to put an End to the Parliament,
and encourage his Friends and loyal Subjects in
<HI>Kent,</HI> who were ready to rise for him; and
shewed us Letters from the Earl of <HI>Newcastle,</HI>
wherein he offered to join his Majesty with a
Detachment of 4000 Horse, and 8000 Foot, if
his Majesty thought fit to march Southward,
and yet leave Forces sufficient to guard the
<HI>North</HI> from any Invasion. I confess, when I saw
the Scheme the King had himself drawn for this
Attempt, I felt an unusual Satisfaction in my
Mind, from the Hopes that we might bring this
War to some tolerable End; for I prosessed my self
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
on all Occasions heartily weary of Fighting with
Friends, Brothers, Neighbours, and Acquain∣tance:
And I made no Question, but this Motion
of the King's would effectually bring the Par∣liament
to Reason.</P>
<P>All Men seemed to like the Enterprize but
the Earl of <HI>Worcester,</HI> who on particular Views
for securing the Country behind, as he called it,
proposed the taking in the Town of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and
<HI>Hereford</HI> first: He made a long Speech of the
Danger of leaving <HI>Massey,</HI> an active, bold Fellow,
with a strong Party in the Heart of all the King's
Quarters, ready on all Occasions to sally out,
and surprize the neighbouring Garrisons, as he
had done <HI>Sudley</HI> Castle and others; and of the
Ease and Freedom to all those Western Parts, to
have them fully cleared of the Enemy. Interest
presently backs this Advice, and all those
Gentlemen whose Estates lay that way, or whose
Friends lived about <HI>Worcester, Shrewsbury, Bridg∣north,</HI>
or the Borders; and who, as they said, had
heard the frequent Wishes of the Country to
have the City of <HI>Gloucester</HI> reduced, fell in with
this Advice, alledging the Consequence it was of
for the Commerce of the Country, to have the
Navigation of the <HI>Severn</HI> free, which was only
interupted by this one Town from the Sea up to
<HI>Shrewsbury</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I opposed this, and so did several others: Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> was vehemently against it; and we both
offered, with the Troops of the County, to keep
<HI>Gloucester</HI> blocked up during the King's March
for <HI>London,</HI> so that <HI>Massey</HI> should not be able
to stir.</P>
<P>This Proposal made the Earl of <HI>Worcester</HI>'s
Party more eager for the Siege than before; for
they had no Mind to a Blockade, which would
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
leave the Country to maintain the Troops all
the Summer; and of all Men the Prince did not
please them: For he having no extraordinary
Character for Discipline, his Company was not
much desired even by our Friends. Thus, <HI>in an
ill Hour</HI> 'twas resolved to sit down before <HI>Glou∣cester.</HI>
The King had a gallant Army of 28000
Men, where of 11000 Horse, the finest Body of
Gentlemen that ever I saw together in my Life;
their Horses without Comparison, and their
Equipages the finest and the best in the World,
and their Persons <HI>Englishmen,</HI> which I think is
enough to say of them.</P>
<P>According to the Resolution taken in the
Council of War, the Army marched Westward,
and sat down before <HI>Gloucester</HI> the Beginning of
<HI>August.</HI> There we spent a Month to the least
Purpose that ever Army did; our Men received
frequent Affronts from the desperate Sallies of
an inconsiderable Enemy. I cannot forbear re∣flecting
on the the Misfortunes of this Siege:
Our Men were strangely dispirited in all the
Assaults they gave upon the Place; there was
something looked like Disaster and Mismanage∣ment,
and our Men went on with an ill Will, and
no Resolution. The King despised the Place,
and the King, to carry it Sword in Hand, made
no regular Approaches, and the Garrison be∣ing
desperate, made therefore the greater Slaugh∣ter.
In this Work our Horse, who were so nu∣merous
and so fine, had no Employment: 2000
Horse had been enough for this Business, and
the Enemy had no Garrison or Party within
fourty Miles of us; so that we had nothing to
do but look on with infinite Regret, upon the
Losses of our Foot.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="223"/>
The Enemy made frequent and desperate
Sallies, in one of which I had my Share. I was
posted upon a Parade, or Place of Arms, with
Part of my Regiment, and Part of Collonel <HI>Go∣ring</HI>'s
Regiment of Horse, in order to support a
Body of Foot who were ordered to storm the
Point of a Breast-work which the Enemy had
raised to defend one of the Avenues to the
Town. The Foot were beat off with Loss, as
they always were; and <HI>Massey</HI> the Governor,
not content to have beaten them from his Works,
sallies out with near 400 Men, and falling in
upon the Foot as they were rallying under the
Cover of our Horse, we put our selves in the best
Posture we could to receive them. As <HI>Massey</HI> did
not expect, I suppose, to engage with any Horse,
he had no Pikes with him, which encouraged us
to treat him the more rudley; but as to desperate
Men Danger is no Danger, when he found he
must clear his Hands of us, before he could dis∣patch
the Foot, he faces up to us, fires but one
Volley of his small Shot, and fell to battering us
with the Stocks of their Musquets, in such a
manner, that one would have thought they had
been mad Men.</P>
<P>We at first despised this way of Clubbing us,
and charging through them, laid a great many
of them upon the Ground; and in repeating our
Charge, trampled more of them under our
Horses Feet: And wheeling thus continually,
beat them off from our Foot, who were just up∣on
the Point of disbanding. Upon this they
charged us again with their Fire, and at one
Volley killed 33 or 34 Men and Horses; and
had they had Pikes with them, I know not what
we should have done with them: But at last
charging through them again, we divided them;
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
one Part of them being hemmed in between us
and our own Foot, were cut in Pieces to a Man;
the rest, as I understood afterwards, retreated
into the Town, having lost 300 of their Men.</P>
<P>In this last Charge I received a rude Blow
from a stout Fellow on Foot, with the But End
of his Musquet, which perfectly stunned me,
and fetched me off from my Horse; and had
not some near me took Care of me, I had been
trod to Death by our own Men: But the Fellow
being immediately killed, and my Friends fin∣ding
me alive, had taken me up, and carried me
off at some Distance, where I came to my self
again, after some time, but knew little of what
I did or said that Night. This was the Reason
why I say I afterwards understood the Enemy
retreated; for I saw no more what they did
then; nor indeed was I well of this Blow for
all the rest of the Summer, but had frequent
Pains in my Head, Dizzinesses and Swimming,
that gave me some Fears the Blow had injured
the Scull, but it wore off again; nor did it at all
hinder my attending my Charge.</P>
<P>This Action, I think, was the only one that
looked like a Defeat given the Enemy at this
Siege; we kille them near 300 Men, as I have
said, and lost about 60 of our Troopers.</P>
<P>All this Time, while the King was harrassing
and weakening the best Army he ever saw toge∣ther
during the whole War, the Parliament Ge∣nerals,
or rather Preachers, were recruiting theirs;
for the Preachers were better than Drummers
to raise Voluntiers, zealously exhorting the <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
Dames to part with their Husbands, and the
City to send some of their Trained Bands to join
the Army for the Relief of <HI>Gloucester;</HI> and now
they began to advance towards us.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="225"/>
The King hearing of the Advance of <HI>Effex</HI>'s Army,
who by this time was come to <HI>Alisbury,</HI> had sum∣moned
what Forces he had within Call, to join him;
and accordingly he received 3000 Foot from <HI>Somer∣setshire:</HI>
And having batter'd the Town for 36 Hours,
and made a fair Breach, resolves upon an Assault,
if possible, to carry the Town before the Enemy
came up. The Assault was begun about Seven in the
Evening, and the Men boldly mounted the Breach;
but after a very obstinate and bloody Dispute, were
beaten out again by the besieged, with great Loss.</P>
<P>Being thus often repulsed, and the Earl of
<HI>Effex</HI>'s Army approaching, the King calls a Coun∣cil
of War, and proposed to fight <HI>Effex</HI>'s Army.
The Officers of the Horse were for fighting; and
without doubt we were superior to him both in
Number and Goodnss of our Horse, but the Foot
were not in an equal Condition: And the
Collonels of Foot representing to the King the
Weakness of their Regiments, and how their
Men had been bauked and disheartened at this
cursed Siege, the graver Counsel prevailed, and
it was resolved to raise the Siege, and retreat
towards <HI>Bristol,</HI> till the Army was recruited.
Pursuant to this Resolution, the 5th of <HI>Septem∣ber,</HI>
the King having before sent away his heavy
Cannon and Baggage, raised the Siege, and
marched to <HI>Berkley</HI> Castle. The Earl of <HI>Effex</HI>
came the next Day to <HI>Birdlip Hills;</HI> and under∣standing
by Messengers from Collonel <HI>Massey,</HI> that
the Siege was raised, sends a Recrult of 2500
Men into the City, and followed us himself with
a great Body of Horse.</P>
<P>This Body of Horse shewed themselves to us
once in a large Field fit to have entertained
them in; and our Scouts having assured us they
were not above 4000, and had no Foot with
<PB N="220" REF="226"/>
them, the King ordered a Detachment of about
the same Number to face them. I desired his
Majesty to let us have two Regiments of Dra∣goons
with us, which was then 800 Men in a
Regiment, lest there might be some Dragoons
among the Enemy, which the King granted;
and accordingly we marched, and drew up in
View of them. They stood their Ground, ha∣ving,
as they supposed, some Advantage of the
manner they were posted in, and expected we
would charge them. The King who did us the
Honour to command this Party, finding they
would not stir, calls me to him, and ordered
me with the Dragoons, and my own Regiment,
to take a Circuit round by a Village to a certain
Lane, where in their Retreat they must have
passed, and which opened to a small Common
on their Flank, with Orders, if they engaged,
to advance and charge them in the Flank.
I marched immediately; but though the Coun∣try
about there was almost all Enclosures, yet
their Scouts were so vigilant, that they dis∣covered
me, and gave Notice to the Body; upon
which their whole Party moved to the Left, as
if they intended to charge me, before the King
with his Body of Horse could come; but the
King was too vigilant to be circumvented so; and
therefore his Majesty perceiving this, sends away
three Regiments of Horse to second me, and a
Messenger before them, to order me to halt, and
expect the Enemy, for that he would follow with
the whole Body.</P>
<P>But before this Order reached me, I had hal∣ted
for some time; for, finding my self disco∣vered,
and not judging it safe to be entirely cut
off from the main Body, I stopt at the Village,
and causing my Dragoons to alight, and line a
<PB N="221" REF="227"/>
thick Hedge on my Left. I drew up my Horse
just at the Entrance into the Village opening to
a Common; the Enemy came up on the Trot
to charge me, but were saluted with a terrible
Fire from the Dragoons out of the Hedge,
which killed them near 100 Men. This being
a perfect Surprize to them, they halted; and
just at that Moment they received Orders from
their main Body to retreat; the King at the
same time appearing upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome small Heights
in their Rear, which obliged them to think of
retreating, or coming to a general Battle, which
was none of their Design.</P>
<P>I had no Occasion to follow them, not being
in a Condition to attack their whole Body;
but the Dragoons coming out into the Common,
gave them another Volley at a Distance, which
reached them effectually; for it killed about 20
of them, and wounded more; but they drew
off, and never fired a Shot at us, fearing to be
enclosed between two Parties, and so marched
away to their General's Quarters, leaving 10 or
12 more of their Fellows killed, and about 180
Horses. Our Men, after the Country Fashion,
gave them a Shout at parting, to let them see
we knew they were afraid of us.</P>
<P>However, this Relieving of <HI>Gloucester</HI> raised the
Spirits as well as the Reputation of the Parlia∣ment
Forces, and was a great Defeat to us; and
from this time things began to look with a me∣lancholy
Aspect; for the prosperous Condition
of the King's Affairs began to decline. The Op∣portunities
he had let slip, were never to be re∣covered;
and the Parliament, in their former
Extremity, having voted an Invitation to the <HI>Scots</HI>
to March to their Assistance, we had now new Ene∣mies
to encounter; and indeed there began the
<PB N="222" REF="228"/>
Ruine of his Majesty's Affairs; for the Earl of
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> not able to defend himself against the
<HI>Scots</HI> on his Rear, the Earl of <HI>Manchester</HI> in his
Front, and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> on his Flank, was
every where routed and defeated, and his Forces
obliged to quit the Field to the Enemy.</P>
<P>About this Time it was that we first began to
hear of one <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> who, like a little
Cloud, rose out of the East, and spread first into
the North, 'till it shed down a Flood that over∣helmed
the three Kindoms.</P>
<P>He first was a private Captain of Horse, but
now commanded a Regiment whom he armed
<HI>Cap-a-pee a la Curiassier;</HI> and joining with the Earl
of <HI>Manchester,</HI> the first Action we heard of him,
that made him any thing famous, was about
<HI>Grantham,</HI> where, with only his own Regiment,
he defeated 24 Troops of Horse and Dragoons
of the King's Forces: Then at <HI>Gainsborough,</HI> with
two Regiments, his own of Horse, and one of
Dragoons, where he defeated near 3000 of the
Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s Men, killed Lieutenant Gene∣ral
<HI>Cavendish,</HI> Brother to the Earl of <HI>Devonshire,</HI>
who commanded them, and relieved <HI>Gains∣borough;</HI>
and though the whole Army came in
to the Rescue, he made good his Retreat to
<HI>Lincoln,</HI> with little Loss; and the next Week he
defeated Sir <HI>John Henderson,</HI> at <HI>Winsby,</HI> near <HI>Horn
Castle,</HI> with sixteen Regiments of Horse and
Dragoons, himself having not half that Num∣ber,
killed the Lord <HI>Widdrington,</HI> Sir <HI>Ingram Hopton,</HI>
and several Gentlemen of Quality.</P>
<P>Thus this Firebrand of War began to blaze,
and he soon grew a Terror to the North; for
Victory attended him like a Page of Honour,
and he was scarce ever known to be beaten, du∣ring
the whole War.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="229"/>
Now we began to reflect again on the Mis∣fortune
of our Master's Counsels: Had we
marched to <HI>London,</HI> instead of besieging <HI>Gloucester,</HI>
we had finished the War with a Stroke. The
Parliament's Army was in a most despicable
Condition, and had never been recruited, had we
not given them a Month's time, which we linge∣red
away at this fatal Town of <HI>Gloucester:</HI> But
'twas too late to reflect; we were a disheartned
Army, but we were not beaten yet, nor broken;
we had a large Country to recruit in, and we lost
no time, but raised Men apace. In the mean
time his Majesty, after a short Stay at <HI>Bristol,</HI>
makes back again towards <HI>Oxford</HI> with a part
of the Foot, and all the Horse.</P>
<P>At <HI>Cireneester</HI> we had a Brush again with
<HI>Essex;</HI> that Town owed us a shrewd Turn for
having handled them coarsly enough before,
when Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> seized the County Maga∣zine.
I happened to be in the Town that Night
with Sir <HI>Nicholas Crisp,</HI> whose Regiment of Horse
quartered there with Collonel <HI>Spencer,</HI> and some
Foot; my own Regiment was gone before to
<HI>Oxford.</HI> About Ten at Night, a Party of <HI>Essex</HI>'s
Men beat up our Quarters by Surprize, just as
we had served them before; they fell in with
us, just as People were going to Bed, and having
beaten the Out-Guards, where gotten into the
Middle of the Town, before our Men could get
on Horseback. Sir <HI>Nicholas Crisp</HI> hearing the
Alarm, gets up, and with some or his Clothes on,
and some off, comes into my Chamber: We are
all undone, <HI>says he,</HI> the Roundheads are upon us,
We had but little time to confult; but being in
one of the principal Inns in the Town, we present∣ly
ordered the Gates of the Inn to be shut, and
sent to all the Inns where our Men were quartered,
<PB N="224" REF="230"/>
to do the like, with Orders, if they had any
Back-doors, or Ways to get out, to come to us.
By this means however we got so much time as
to get on Horseback, and so many of our Men
came to us by Back-ways, that we had near 300
Horse in the Yards and Places behind the House;
and now we began to think of Breaking out
by a Lane which led from the back Side of the
Inn; but a new Accident determined us another,
<HI>though a worse</HI> Way. The Enemy being entered,
and our Men cooped up in the Yards of the Inns,
Collonel <HI>Spencer</HI> the other Collonel, whose Regi∣ment
of Horse lay also in the Town, had got on
Horseback before us, and engaged with the Ene∣my,
but being over-powered, retreated fighting,
and sends to Sir <HI>Nicholas Crisp</HI> for Help. Sir
<HI>Nicholas</HI> moved to see the Distress of his Friend,
turning to me, says he <HI>What can we do for him?</HI>
I told him, I thought 'twas time to help him, if
possible; upon which, opening the Inn Gates,
we sallied out in very good Order, about 300
Horse; and several of the Troops from other
parts of the Town joining us, we recovered
Collonel <HI>Spencer,</HI> and charging home, beat back
the Enemy to their main Body: But finding
their Foot drawn up in the Church-yard,
and several Detachments moving to charge us,
we retreated in as good Order as we could. They
did not think fit to pursue us, but they took
all the Carriages which were under the Convoy
of this Party, and loaden with Provisions and
Ammunition, and above 500 of our Horse. The
Foot shifted away as well as they could: Thus we
made off in a shattered Condition towards <HI>Far∣rington,</HI>
and so to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and I was very glad
my Regiment was not there.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="231"/>
We had small Rest at <HI>Oxford,</HI> or indeed any
where else; for the King was marched from
thence, and we followed him. I was something
uneasy at my Absence from my Regiment, and
did not know how the King might resent it,
which caused me to ride after them with all Ex∣pedition.
But the Armies were engaged that
very Day at <HI>Newberry,</HI> and I came in too late.
I had not behaved my self so as to be suspected
of a wilful Shunning the Action; but a Collonel
of a Regiment ought to avoid Absence from his
Regiment in time of Fight, be the Excuse never
so just, as carefully as he would a Surprize in
his Quarters. The <HI>Truth is,</HI> 'twas an Error of
my own, and owing to two Days Stay I made at
the <HI>Bath,</HI> where I met with some Ladies who
were my Relations: And this is far from being
an Excuse; for if the King had been a <HI>Gusta∣vus
Adolphus,</HI> I had certainly received a Check
for it.</P>
<P>This Fight was very obstinate, and could our
Horse have come to Action as freely as the Foot,
the Parliament Army had suffered much more;
for we had here a much better Body of Horse
than they, and we never failed beating them
where the Weight of the Work lay upon the
Horse.</P>
<P>Here the City Train-Bands, of which there
was two Regiments, and whom we used to de∣spise,
fought very well: They lost one of their
Collonels, and several Officers in the Action;
and I heard our Men say, they behaved them∣selves
as well as any Forces the Parliament
had.</P>
<P>The Parliament cried Victory here too, <HI>as they
always did;</HI> and indeed where the Foot were
concerned they had some Advantage; but our
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
Horse defeated them evidently. The King drew
up his Army in Battalia, in Person, and faced
them all the next Day, inviting them to renew
the Fight; but they had no Stomach to come
on again.</P>
<P>It was a kind of a Hedge Fight, for neither
Army was drawn out in the Field; if it had,
'twould never have held from fix in the Morning
to ten at Night: But they fought for Advan∣tages;
sometimes one Side had the better, some∣times
another. They fought twice through the
Town, in at one End, and out at the other; and in
the Hedges and Lanes, with exceeding Fury. The
King lost the most Men, his Foot having suffe∣red
for want of the Succour of their Horse, who
on two several Occasions, could not come at
them. But the Parliament Foot suffered also,
and two Regiments were entirely cut in Peices,
and the King kept the Field.</P>
<P><HI>Essex,</HI> the Parliament General, had the Pillage
of the dead, and lest us to bury them; for while
we stood all Day to our Arms, having given them
a fair Field to fight us in, their Camp Rabble
stript the dead Bodies, and they not daring to
venture a second Engagement with us, marched
away towards <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The King Loss in this Action the Earls of
<HI>Carnarvon</HI> and <HI>Sunderland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> a
<HI>French</HI> Marquess, and some very gallant Officers,
and about 1200 Men. The Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> was
brought into an Inn in <HI>Newberry,</HI> where the
King came to see him. He had just Life enough
to speak to his Majesty, and died in his Presence.
The King was exceedingly concerned for him,
and was observed to shed Tears at the Sight of
it. We were indeed all of us troubled for the
Loss of so brave a Gentleman, but the Concern
<PB N="227" REF="233"/>
our royal Master discovered, moved us more
than ordinary. Every body endeavoured to have
the King out of the Room, but he would not stir
from the Bed Side, till he see all Hopes of Life
was gone.</P>
<P>The indefatigable Industry of the King, his
Servants and Friends, continually to supply and
recruit his Forces, and to harrass and fatigue
the Enemy, was such, that we should still have
given a good Account of the War had the <HI>Scots</HI>
stood neuter. But bad News came every Day
out of the North; as for other Places, Parties
were always in Action: Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> and
Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> beat one another by Turns;
and Sir <HI>Ralph</HI> had extended the King's Quarters
from <HI>Launceston</HI> in <HI>Cornwal</HI> to <HI>Farnham</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI>
where he gave Sir <HI>William Waller</HI> a Rub, and
drove him into the Castle.</P>
<P>But in the North, the Storm grew thick, the
<HI>Scots</HI> advanced to the Borders, and entered <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
in Confederacy with the Parliament, against
their King; for which the Parliament requited
them afterwards as they deserved.</P>
<P>Had it not been for this <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, the Par∣liament
had easily been reduced to Terms of
Peace: But after this they never made any Pro∣posals
fit for the King to receive. Want of
Success before had made them differ among
themselves: <HI>Essex</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI> could never agree;
the Earl of <HI>Manchester</HI> and the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI>
differed to the highest Degree; and the King's
Affairs went never the worse for it. But this
Storm in the North ruined us all; for the <HI>Scots</HI>
prevailed in <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and being joined with
<HI>Fairsax, Manchester,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> carried all be∣fore
them; so that the King was obliged to send
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with a Body of 4000 Horse, to
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
the Assistance of the Earl of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> where
that Prince finished the Destruction of the King's
Interest, by the rashest and unaccountablest Action
in the World, of which I shall speak in its Place.</P>
<P>Another Action of the King's though in it
self no greater a Cause of Offence than the cal∣ling
the <HI>Scots</HI> into the Nation, gave great Offence
in general, and even the King's own Friends
disliked it; and was carefully improved by his
Enemies to the Disadvantage of the King, and
of his Cause.</P>
<P>The Rebels in <HI>Ireland</HI> had, ever since the
bloody Massacre of the Protestants, maintained
a War against the <HI>English,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Or∣mond</HI>
was General and Governour for the King.
The King finding his Affairs pinch him at home,
sends Orders to the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> to consent
to a Cessation of Arms with the Rebels, and to
ship over certain of his Regiments hither to his
Majesty's Assistance. <HI>'Tis true,</HI> the <HI>Irish</HI> had de∣served
to be very ill treated by the <HI>English;</HI> but
while the Parliament pressed the King with a
cruel and unnatural War at home, and called
in an Army out of <HI>Scotland</HI> to support their
Quarrel with their King, I could never be con∣vinced,
that it was such a dishonourable Action
for the King to suspend the Correction of his
<HI>Irish</HI> Rebls, 'till he was in a Capacity to do it
with Safety to himself, or to delay any farther
Assistance to preserve himself at home; and the
Troops he recalled being his own, it was no
Breach of his Honour to make use of them, since
he now wanted them for his own Security,
against those who fought against him at home.</P>
<P>But the King was perswaded to make one
Step farther; and that, I confess, was unpleasing
to us all; and some of his best and most faithful
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
Servants took the Freedom to speak plainly to
him of it; and that was bringing some Regi∣ments
of the <HI>Irish</HI> themselves over. This cast,
as we thought an <HI>Odium</HI> upon our whole Nation,
being some of those very Wretches who had
dipt their Hands in the innocent Blood of
the Protestants, and with unheard of Butcheries,
had massacred so many Thousands of <HI>English</HI> in
cool Blood.</P>
<P>Abundance of Gentlemen forsook the King
upon this Score; and seeing they could not brook
the Fighting in Conjunction with this wicked
Generation, came into the Declaration of the
Parliament, and making Composition for their
Estates, lived retired Lives all the rest of the
War, or went abroad.</P>
<P>But as Exigences and Necessities oblige us to
do things which at other times we would not
do, and is, as to Man, some Excuse for such
things; so I cannot but think the Guilt and
Dishonour of such an Action must lye, very much
of it, at least, at their Doors, who drove the
King to these Necessities and Distresses by cal∣ling
in an Army of his own Subjects whom he
had not injured, but had complied with them in
every thing, to make War upon him without
any Provocation.</P>
<P>As to the Quarrel between the King and his
Parliament, there may something be said on
both Sides; and the King saw Cause himself, to
disown and dislike some things he had done, which
the Parliament objected against, such as levying
Money without Consent of Parliament, Infracti∣ons
on their Privileges, <HI>and the like:</HI> Here I say,
was some room for an Argument at least, and
Concessions on both Sides were needful to
come to a Peace; but for the <HI>Scots,</HI> all their
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
Demands had been answered, all their Grievan∣ces
had been redressed, they had made Ar∣ticles
with their Sovereign, and he had performed
those Articles; their capital Enemy Episcopacy
was abolished; they had not one thing to de∣mand
of the King which he had not granted:
And therefore they had no more Cause to take
up Arms against their Sovereign, than they had
against the <HI>Grand Senior.</HI> But it must for ever
lye against them as a Brand of Infamy, and as a
Reproach on their Whole Nation that, <HI>purchased
by the Parliament's Money,</HI> they sold their <HI>Honesty,</HI>
and rebelled against their King <HI>for Hire;</HI> and it
was not many years before, as I have said
already, they were fully paid the Wages of their.
Unrighteousness, and chastised for their Trea∣chery
by the very same People whom they thus
basely assisted: Then they would have retrieved
it, if it had not been too late.</P>
<P>But I could not but accuse this Age of In∣justice
and Partiality, who while they reproach∣ed
the King for his Cessation of Arms with the
<HI>Irish</HI> Rebls, and not prosecuting them with the
utmost Severity, though he was constrained by
the Necessities of the War to do it, could yet, at
the same time, justify the <HI>Scots</HI> taking up Arms
in a Quarrel they had no Concern in, and against
their own King, with whom they had articled
and capitulated, and who had so punctually
complied with all their Demands, that they
had no Claim upon him, no Grievances to be
redressed, no Oppression to cry out of, nor could
ask any thing of him which he had not granted.</P>
<P>But as no Action in the World is so vile, but
the Actors can cover with some specious Pre∣tence,
so the <HI>Scots</HI> now passing into <HI>England,</HI>
publish a Declaration to justify their Assisting the
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
Parliament: To which I shall only say, in my
Opinion, it was no Justification at all; for admit
the Parliament's Quarrel had been never so
just, it could not be just in them to aid them,
because 'twas against their own King too, to
whom they had sworn Allegiance, or at least
had crowned him; and thereby had recognized
his Authority: For if Male-Administration be,
according to <HI>Prynn</HI>'s Doctrine, or according to
their own <HI>Buchanan,</HI> a sufficient Reason for Sub∣jects
to take up Arms against their Prince, the
Breach of his Coronation Oath being supposed
to dissolve the Oath of Allegiance, which <HI>however</HI> I
<HI>cannot believe;</HI> yet this can never be extended to
make it lawful, that because a King of <HI>England</HI>
may, by Male-Administration discharge the Sub∣jects
of <HI>England</HI> from their Allegiance, that
therefore the Subjects of <HI>Scotland</HI> may take up
Arms against the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he having
not infringed the Compact of Government as
to them, and they having nothing to complain
of for themselves: Thus I thought their own Ar∣guments
were against them, and Heaven seemed
to concur with it; for although they did carry
the Cause for the <HI>English</HI> Rebels, yet the most of
them lest there Bones here in the Quarrel.</P>
<P>But what signifies Reason to the Drum and
the Trumpet. The Parliament had the su∣pream
Argument with those Men, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Mo∣ney;
and having accordingly advanced a good
round Sum, upon Payment of this, (for the Scots
<HI>would not stir a Foot without it</HI>) they entred <HI>England</HI>
on the 15th of <HI>January</HI> 1643, with an Army of
12000 Men, under the Command of old <HI>Lesley</HI>
now Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> an old Soldier of great
Experience, having been bred to Arms from a
Youth in the Service of the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="238"/>
The <HI>Scots</HI> were no sooner entred <HI>England,</HI> but
they were joined by all the Friends to the Par∣liament
Party in the North; and first, Collonel
<HI>Grey,</HI> Brother to the Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> joined them
with a Regiment of Horse, and several out of
<HI>Westmoreland</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and so they advan∣ced
to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which they summoned to surren∣der.
The Earl of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> who rather saw,
than was able to prevent this Storm, was in
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> and did his best to defend it; but the
<HI>Scots</HI> encreased by this time to above 20000,
lay close Siege to the Place, which was but
meanly fortified; and having repulsed the Garri∣son
upon several Sallies, and pressing the Place
very Close; after a Siege of 12 Days, or there∣abouts,
they enter the Town Sword in Hand.
The Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> got away, and afterwards
gathered what Forces together he could; but
not strong enough to hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from ad∣vancing
to <HI>Durham</HI> which he quitted to them, nor
to hinder the Conjunction of the <HI>Scots</HI> with the
Forces of <HI>Fairfax, Manchester,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell.</HI> Where∣upon
the Earl seeing all things thus going to
wreck, he sends his Horse away, and retreats
with his Foot into <HI>York,</HI> making all necessary
Preparations for a vigorous Defence there, in
case he should be attacked, which he was pretty
sure of, as indeed afterwards happened. <HI>York</HI> was
in a very good Posture of Defence: The Forti∣fications
very regular, and exceeding strong;
well furnished with Provisions, and had now a
Garrison of 12000 Men in it. The Governour
under the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> was Sir <HI>Thomas Glem∣ham,</HI>
a good Souldier, and a Gentleman brave
enough.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> as I have said, having taken <HI>Dur∣ham,
Tinmouth</HI> Castle and <HI>Sunderland,</HI> and being
<PB N="233" REF="239"/>
joined by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> who had taken <HI>Selby,</HI>
resolve, with their united Strength, to bsiege
<HI>York;</HI> but when they came to view the City, and
saw a Plan of the Works, and had Intelligence
of the Strength of the Garrison, they sent Ex∣presses
to <HI>Manchester</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> for Help,
who came on, and join them with 9000, ma∣king
together about 30000 Men, rather more
than less.</P>
<P>Now had the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>'s repeated
Messengers convinced the King, that it was
absolutely necessary to send some Forces to his
Assistance, or else all would be lost in the North.
Whereupon Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was detached with
Orders first to go into <HI>Lancashire,</HI> and relieve
<HI>Latham-House,</HI> defended by the brave Countess
of <HI>Derby;</HI> and then taking all the Forces he
could collect in <HI>Cheshire, Lancashire,</HI> and <HI>Yorkshire,</HI>
to march to relieve <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince marched from <HI>Oxfor</HI> with but
three Regiments of Horse, and one of Dragoons,
making in all about 2800 Men. The Collonels
of Horse were Collonel <HI>Charles Goring,</HI> the Lord
<HI>Biron,</HI> and my self; the Dragoons were of Col∣lonel
<HI>Smith.</HI> In our March we were joined by
a Regiment of Horse from <HI>Ranbury,</HI> one of Dra∣goons
from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and three Regiments of Horse
from <HI>Chester:</HI> So that when we came into <HI>Lanca∣shire,</HI>
we were about 5000 Horse Dragoons.
These Horse we received from <HI>Chester,</HI> were
those who having been at the Siege of <HI>Nantwich,</HI>
were obliged to raise the Siege by Sir <HI>Thomas
Fairfax;</HI> and the Foot having yielded, the Horse
made good their Retreat to <HI>Chester,</HI> being
about 2000; of whom three Regiments now
joined us.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="240"/>
We received also 2000 Foot from <HI>West-Chester,</HI>
and 2000 more out of <HI>Wales;</HI> and with this
Strength we entered <HI>Lancashire.</HI> We had not
much time to spend, and a great deal of Work
to do.</P>
<P><HI>Bolton</HI> and <HI>Leverpool</HI> felt the first Fury of our
Prince: At <HI>Bolton</HI> indeed he had some Provo∣cation;
for here we were like to be beaten off.
When first the Prince came to the Town, he
sent a Summons to demand the Town for the
King, but received no Answer but from their
Guns, commanding the Messenger to keep off at
his Peril. They had raised some Works about
the Town, and having by their Intelligence,
learnt that we had no Artillery, and were only
a flying Party, <HI>so they called us,</HI> they contemned
the Summons, and shewed themselves upon their
Ramparts ready for us. The Prince was resolved
to humble them, if possible, and takes up his
Quarters close to the Town. In the Evening
he orders me to advance with one Regiment
of Dragoons, and my Horse to bring them off,
if Occasion was, and to post my self as near as
possibly I could to the Lines, yet so as not to
be discovered; and at the same time having
concluded what Part of the Works to fall upon,
he draws up his Men on two other Sides, as if
he would Storm them there; and on a Signal
I was to begin the real Assault on my Side, with
my Dragoons. I had got so near the Town
with my Dragoons, making them creep upon
their Bellies a great way, that we could hear the
Soldiers talk on the Walls, when the Prince
believing one Regiment would be too few, sends
we Word, that he had ordered a Regiment of
Foot to help, and that I should not discover my
self till they were come up to me. This broke
<PB N="235" REF="241"/>
our Measures; for the March of this Regiment
was discovered by the Enemy, and they took
the Alarm. Upon this I sent to the Prince, to
desire he would put off the Storm for that
Night, and I would answer for it the next Day;
but the Prince was impatient, and sent Orders
we should fall on as soon as the Foot came up
to us. The Foot marching out of the Way,
missed us, and fell in with a Road that leads to
another Part of the Town; and being not able
to find us, make an Attack upon the Town
themselves; but the Desendants being ready
for them, received them very warmly, and beat
them off with great Loss. I was at a Loss now
what to do; for hearing the Guns, and by the
Noise knowing it was an Assault upon the Town,
I was very uneasy to have my Share in it; but
as I had learnt under the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> pun∣ctually
to adhere to the Excecution of Orders;
and my Orders being to lye still till the Foot
came up with me; I would not stir if I had been
sure to have done never so much Service; but
however to satisfy myself, I sent to the Prince
to let him know that I continued in the same
Place expecting the Foot, and none being yet
come, I desired farther Orders. The Prince
was a little amazed at this, and finding there
must be some Mistake, came galloping away in
the Dark to the Place, and drew off the Men,
which was no hard Matter, for they were wil∣ling
enough to give it over.</P>
<P>As for me, the Prince ordered me to come off
so privately, as not to be discovered, if possible,
which I effectually did; and s we were baulked
for that Night. The next Day the Prince fell on
upon another Quarter with three Regiments
of Foot, but was beaten off with Loss; and
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
the like a third time. At last, the Prince, <HI>re∣solved
to carry it,</HI> doubled his Numbers, and re∣newing
the Attack with fresh Men, the Foot
entred the Town over their Works, killing in
the first Heat of the Action, all that came in
their way some of the Foot at the same
time letting in the Horse; and so the Town
was entirely won. There was about 600 of
the Enemy killed, and we lost above 400 in all
which was owing to the foolish Mistakes we
made. Our Men got some Plunder here, which
the Parliament made a great Noise about;
but it was their due, and they bought it dear
enough.</P>
<P><HI>Leverpool</HI> did not cost us so much, nor did
we get so much by it, the People having sent
their Women and Children, and best Goods
on board the Ships in the Road; and as we
had no Boats to board them with, we could
not get at them. Here, as at <HI>Bolton,</HI> the Town
and Fort was taken by Storm, and the Garrison
were many of them cut in Pieces, which by the
way was their own Faults.</P>
<P>Our next Stop was <HI>Latham-House,</HI> which the
Countess of <HI>Derby</HI> had gallantly defended above
18 Weeks, against the Parliament Forces; and
this Lady not only encouraged her Men by her
chearful and noble Maintenance of them, but
by Examples of her own undaunted Spirit, ex∣posing
her self upon the Walls in the midst of
the Enemy's Shot, would be with her Men in the
greatest Dangers; and she well deserved our
Care of her Person; for the Enemy were pre∣paired
to use her very rudely if she fell into
their Hands.</P>
<P>Upon our Approach, the Enemy drew off;
and the Prince not only effectually relieved this
<PB N="237" REF="243"/>
vigorous Lady, but lest her a good Quantity
of all Sorts of Ammunition, three great Guns,
500 Arms, and 200 Men, commanded by a Ma∣jor,
as her extraordinary Guard.</P>
<P>Here the Way being now opened, and our
Success answering our Expectation, several Bo∣dies
of Foot came in to us from <HI>Westmoreland;</HI> and
from <HI>Cumberland;</HI> and here it was that the Prince
found Means to surprize the Town of <HI>Newcastle
upon Tyne,</HI> which was recovered for the King, by
the Management of the Mayor of the Town, and
some loyal Gentlemen of the Country, and a Gar∣rison
placed there again for the King.</P>
<P>But our main Design being the Relief of <HI>York,</HI>
the Prince advanced that Way a-pace, his Ar∣my
still increasing; and being joined by the
Lord <HI>Goring</HI> from <HI>Richmondshire</HI> with 4000 Horse,
which were the same the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> had
sent away when he threw himself into <HI>York</HI> with
the Infantry. We were now 18000 effective Men,
whereof 10000 Horse and Dragoons; so the
Prince, full of Hopes, and his Men in good
Heart, boldly marched directly for <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> as much surprized at the taking
of <HI>Newcastle,</HI> as at the coming of their Enemy,
began to enquire which Way they should get
home, if they should be beaten; and calling a
Council of War, they all agreed to raise the
Siege. The Prince, who drew with him a great
Train of Carriages charged with Provision and
Ammunition, for the Relief of the City, like a
wary General, kept at a Distance from the Ene∣my,
and setching a great Compass about, brings
all safe into the City, and enters into <HI>York</HI> him∣self
with all his Army.</P>
<P>No Action of this whole War had gained
the Prince so much Honour, or the King's Af∣fairs
<PB N="238" REF="244"/>
so much Advantage as this, had the Prince
but had the Power to have restrained his Cou∣rage
after this, and checked his fatal Eagerness
for Fighting. Here was a Siege raised, the Re∣putation
of the Enemy justly slurred, a City
relieved and furnished, with all things necessary
in the Face of an Army superior in Number
by near 10000 Men, and commanded by a Tri∣umvirate
of Generals <HI>Leven, Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Man∣chester.</HI>
Had the Prince but remembered the
Proceeding of the great Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> at the
Relief of <HI>Paris,</HI> he would have seen the relieving
the City was his Business; 'twas the Enemy's
Business to fight, if possible, 'twas his to avoid
it; for, having delivered the City, and put
the Disgrace of raising the Siege upon the Ene∣my,
he had nothing farther to do, but to have
waited till he had seen what Course the Enemy
would take, and taken his farther Measures
from their Motion.</P>
<P>But <HI>the Prince,</HI> a continual Friend to precipi∣tant
Counsels, would hear no Advice: I entreated
him not to put it to the Hazard; I told him,
that he ought to consider if he lost the Day, he
lost the Kingdom, and took the Crown off from
the King's Head. I put him in mind that it
was impossible those three Generals should con∣tinue
long together; and that if they did, they
would not agree long in their Counsels: Which
would be as well for us as their separating.
'Twas plain <HI>Manchester</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> must return
to the associated Counties, who would not
suffer them to stay, for fear the King should
attempt them; That he could subsist well
enough, having <HI>York</HI> City and River at his
Back; but the <HI>Scots</HI> would eat up the Country,
make themselves odious, and dwindle away to
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
nothing, if he would but hold them at Bay a
little; other General Officers were of the same
Mind; but all I could say, or they either, to a
Man deaf to any thing but his own Courage,
signified nothing. He would draw out and fight,
there was no perswading him to the contrary,
unless a Man would run the Risque of being
upbraided with being a Coward, and afraid of
the Work. The Enemy's Army lay on a large
Common, called <HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> doubtful what to
do: Some were for fighting the Prince, the
<HI>Scots</HI> were against it, being uneasy at having the
Garrison of <HI>Newcastle</HI> at their Backs; but the
Prince brought their Councils of War to a Re∣sult;
for he let them know, they must fight
him, whether they would or no; for the Prince
being, <HI>as before,</HI> 18000 Men, and the Earl of
<HI>Newcastle</HI> having joined him with 8000 Foot out
of the City, were marched in Quest of the Ene∣my,
had entered the Moor in View of their Ar∣my,
and began to draw up in Order of Battle;
but the Night coming on, the Armies only
viewed each other at a Distance for that time.
We lay all Night upon our Arms, and with the
first of the Day were in Order of Battle; the
Enemy was getting ready, but part of <HI>Man∣chester</HI>'s
Men were not in the Field, but lay about
three Miles off, and made a hasty March to
come up.</P>
<P>The Prince his Army was exceedingly well
managed; he himself commanded the Left Wing,
the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> the Right Wing; and the
Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> as General of the Foot, assisted by
Major General <HI>Porter,</HI> and Sir <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> led
the main Battle. I had prevailed with the
Prince, according to the Method of the King of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> to place some small Bodies of Musqueteers
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
in the Intervals of his Horse, in the Left Wing,
but could not prevail upon the Earl of <HI>New∣castle</HI>
to do it in the Right; which he after∣wards
repented. In this Posture we stood fa∣cing
the Enemy, expecting they would advance
to us, which at last they did; and the Prince
began the Day by saluting them with his Ar∣tillery,
which being placed very well, galled
them terribly for a Quarter of an Hour; they
could not shift their Front, so they advanced
the hastier to get within our great Guns,
and consequently out of their Danger, which
brought the Fight the sooner on.</P>
<P>The Enemy's Army was thus ordered; Sir
<HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> had the Right Wing, in which
was the <HI>Scots</HI> Horse, and the Horse of his own
and his Father's Army; <HI>Cromwell</HI> led the Left
Wing, with his own and the Earl <HI>Manchester</HI>'s
Horse, and the three Generals <HI>Lesley,</HI> old <HI>Fair∣fax,</HI>
and <HI>Mancheter,</HI> led the main Battle.</P>
<P>The Prince, with our Left Wing, fell on first,
and, with his usual Fury, broke, like a Clap
of Thunder, into the Right Wing of the <HI>Scots</HI>
Horse, led by Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax;</HI> and, as no∣thing
could stand in his Way, he broke through
and through them, and entirely routed them,
pursuing them quite out of the Field. Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Fairfax,</HI> with a Regiment of Lances, and
about 500 of his own Horse, made good the
Ground for some time; but our Musqueteers,
which, as I said, were placed among our Horse
were such an unlooked for sort of an Article
in a Fight among the Horse, that those Lan∣ces,
which otherwise were brave Fellows, were
mowed down with their Shot, and all was
put into Confusion. Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> was
wounded in the Face, his Brother killed, and a
<PB N="241" REF="247"/>
great Slaughter was made of the. <HI>Scots;</HI> to
whom I confess we shewed no Favour at all.</P>
<P>While this was doing on our Left, the Lord
<HI>Goring</HI> with the main Battle charged the Enemy's
Foot, and particulary one Brigade commanded
by Major General <HI>Porter,</HI> being mostly Pike∣men,
not regarding the Fire of the Ene∣my,
charged with that Fury in a close Body
of Pikes, that they overturned all that came
in their way, and breaking into the Middle of
the Enemy's Foot, filled all with Terror and
Confusion, insomuch that the three Generals
thinking all had been lost, fled, and quitted the
Field.</P>
<P>But Matters went not so well with that <HI>always
Ʋnfortunate</HI> Gentleman the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI>
and our Right Wing of Horse; for <HI>Cromwell</HI>
charged the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> with a power∣ful
Body of Horse; and though the Earl, and
those about him, did what Men could do, and
behaved themselves with all possible Gallantry,
yet there was no withstanding <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Horse;
but, like Prince <HI>Ruport,</HI> they bore down all
before them; and now the Victory was wrung
out of our Hands by our own gross Miscarriage;
for the Prince, as 'twas his Custom, too eager
in the Chase of the Enemy, was gone, and
could not be heard of: The Foot in the Center,
the Right Wing of the Horse being routed by
<HI>Cromwell,</HI> was left, and without the Guard of
his Horse; <HI>Cromwell</HI> having routed the Earl of
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> and beaten him quite out of the Field,
and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> rallying his dispersed
Troops, they fall all together upon the Foot.
General Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> like himself, fought like
a Lion, but, forsaken of his Horse, was hemmed
in on all Sides, and overthrown; and an Hour
<PB N="242" REF="248"/>
after this, the Prince returning too late to recover
his Friends, was obliged with the rest to quit
the Field to Conquerors.</P>
<P>This was a fatal Day to the King's Affairs,
and the Risque too much for any Man in his
Wits to run; we lost 4000 Men on the Spot,
3000 Prisoners, amongst whom was Sir <HI>Charles
Lucas,</HI> Major General <HI>Porter,</HI> Major General
<HI>Telier,</HI> and about 170 Gentlemen of Quality.
We lost all our Baggage, 25 Pieces of Cannon,
300 Carriages, 150 Barrels of Powder, and
10000 Arms.</P>
<P>The Prince got into <HI>York</HI> with the Earl of
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> and a great many Gentlemen, and 7
or 8000 of the Men, as well Horse as Foot.</P>
<P>I had but very course Treatment in this
Fight; for returning with the Prince from
the Pursuit of the Right Wing, and finding
all lost, I halted with some other Officers, to
consider what to do: At first we were for ma∣king
our Retreat in a Body, and might have
done so well enough, if we had known what had
happened, before we saw our selves in the Mid∣dle
of the Enemy; for Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> who
had got together his scattered Troops, and joi∣ned
by some of the Left Wing, knowing who we
were, charged us with great Fury. 'Twas not
a Time to think of any thing but getting away,
or dying upon the Spot; the Prince kept on
in the Front, and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> by this
Charge cut off about three Regiments of us
from our Body; but bending his main Strength
at the Prince, left us, as it were, behind him,
in the Middle of the Field of Battle. We took
this for the only Opportunity we could have
to get off, and joining together, we made cross
the Place of Battle in as good Order as we could,
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
with our Carabines presented. In this Posture
we passed by several Bodies of the Enemy's Foot,
who stood with their Pikes charged to keep us off;
but they had no Occasion, for we had no Design
to meddle with them, but to get from them.
Thus we made a swift March, and thought our
selves pretty secure, but our Work was not
done yet; for, on a sudden, we saw our selves
under a Necessity of Fighting our Way through
a great Body of <HI>Manchester</HI>'s Horse, who came
galloping upon us over the Moor. They had as,
we suppose, been pursuing some of our broken
Troops, which were fled before, and seeing us,
they gave us a home Charge. We received
them as well as could, but pushed to get
through them, which at last we did with a
considerable Loss to them. However, we lost
so many Men, either killed or separated from
us, (for all could not follow the same Way)
that of our three Regiments we could not be
above 400 Horse together, when we got quite
clear, and these were mixt Men, some of one
Troop and Regiment, some of another. Not
that I believe many of us were killed in the
last Attack; for we had plainly the better of
the Enemy; but our Design being to get off,
some shifted for themselves one Way, and some
another, in the best Manner they could, and as
their several Fortunes guided them. 400 more
of this Body, as I afterwards understood, having
broke through the Enemy's Body another Way,
kept together, and got into <HI>Pontfract</HI> Castle,
and 300 more, made Northward, and to
<HI>Skippon,</HI> were the Prince afterwards fetched
them off.</P>
<P>Those few of us that were left together, with
whom I was, being now pretty clear of Pur∣suit,
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
halted, and began to enquire who and
who we were, and what we should do; and on
a short Debate, I proposed we should make to
the first Garrison of the King's that we could
recover; and that we should keep together,
lest the Country People should insult us upon
the Roads. With this Resolution we pushed
on Westward for <HI>Lancashire;</HI> but our Misfor∣tunes
were not yet at an End: We travelled
very hard, and got to a Village upon the River
<HI>Wharf,</HI> near <HI>Wetherby.</HI> At <HI>Wetherby</HI> there was
a Bridge, but we understood that a Party from
<HI>Leeds</HI> had secured the Town and the Post, in
order to stop the flying Cavaliers; and that
'twould be very hard to get through there;
though, as we understood afterwards, there
were no Soldiers there but a Guard of the
Townsmen. In this Pickle we consulted what
Course to take; to stay where we were till
Morning, we all concluded would not be safe;
some advised to take the Stream with our
Horses; but the River, which is deep, and the
Current strong, seemed to bid us have a care
what we did of that Kind, especially in the
Night. We resolved therefore to refresh our
selves and our Horses, <HI>which indeed is more than
we did,</HI> and go on till we might come to a Ford
or Bridge, where we might get over. Some
Guides we had, but they either were foolish
or false; for after we had rid eight or nine Miles,
they plunged us into a River, at a Place they
called a Ford, but 'twas a very ill one; for most
of our Horses swam, and seven or eight were
lost, but we saved the Men; however, we got
all over.</P>
<P>We made bold with our first Convenience to
trespass upon the Country for a few Horses,
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
where we could find them, to remount our
Men, whose Horses were drowned, and conti∣nued
our March; but being obliged to refresh
our selves at a small Village on the Edge of
<HI>Bramham-moor,</HI> we found the Country alarmed
by our taking some Horses, and we were no
sooner got on Horseback in the Morning, and
entering on the Moor, but we understood we
were pursued by some Troops of Horse: There
was no Remedy but we must pass this Moor;
and though our Horses were exceedingly tired,
yet we pressed on upon a round Trot, and re∣covered
an enclosed Country on the other Side,
where we halted. And here, Necessity putting
us upon it, we were obliged to look out for
more Horses, for several of our Men were dis∣mounted,
and others Horses disabled by car∣rying
double, those who lost their Horses get∣ting
up behind them; but we were supplied
by our Enemies against their Will.</P>
<P>The Enemy followed us over the Moor, and
we having a woody enclosed Country about
us, where we were, I observed by their mo∣ving,
they had lost Sight of us; upon which I
proposed concealing our selves till we might
Judge of their Numbers. We did so, and lying
close in a Wood, they past hastily by us, without
skirting or searching the Wood, which was
what on Another Occasion they would not have
done. I found they were not above 150 Horse,
and considering, that to let them go before us,
would be to alarm the Country, and stop our
Design; I thought, since we might be able to
deal with them, we should not meet with a
better Place for it, and told the rest of our
Officers my Mind, which all our Party presently,
(for we not had Time for a long Debate) agreed
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
to. Immediately upon this I caused two Men
to fire their Pistols in the Wood, at two diffe∣rent
Places, as far afunder as I could. This I
did to give them an Alarm, and amuse them;
for being in the Lane, they would otherwise
have got through before we had been ready,
and I resolved to engage them there, as soon as
'twas possible. After this Alarm, we rushed
out of the Wood, with about 100 Horse, and
charged them on the Flank in a broad Lane,
the Wood being on their Right. Our Passage
into the Lame being narrow, gave us some
Difficulty in our getting out; but the Surprize
of the Charge did our Work; for the Enemy
thinking we had been a Mile or two before, had
not the least Thoughts of this Onset, till they
heard us in the Wood, and then they who
were before could not come back. We broke
into the Lane just in the Middle of them, and
by that means divided them; and facing to the
Left, charged the Rear. First our dismounted
Men, which were near 50, lined the Edge of
the Wood, and fired with their Carabines upon
those which were before, so warmly, that they
put them into a great Disorder: Mean while
50 more of our Horse from the farther Part
of the Wood shewed themselves in the Lane
upon their Front; this put them of the fore∣most
Party into a great Perplexity, and they
began to face about, to fall upon us who were
engaged in the Rear: But their facing about
in a Lane where there was no Room to wheel,
and one who understands the Manner of whee∣ling
a Troop of Horse, must imagine, put
them into a great Disorder. Our Party in the
Head of the Lane taking the Advantage of
this Mistake of the Enemy, charged in upon
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
them, and routed them entirely. Some found
means to break into the Enclosures on the
other Side of the Lane, and get away. About
30 were killed, and about 25 made Prisoners,
and 40 very good Horses were taken; all this
while not a Man of ours was lost, and not above
seven or eight wounded. Those in the Rear
behaved themselves better; for they stood our
Charge with a great deal of Resolution, and
all we could do, could not break them; but
at last our Men who had fired on Foot through
the Hedges at the other Party, coming to do
the like here, there was no standing it any lon∣ger.
The Rear of them faced about, and re∣treated
out of the Lane, and drew up in the
open Field to receive and rally their Fellows.
We killed about 17 of them, and followed them
to the End of the Lane, but had no mind to
have any more fighting than needs must; our
Condition at that time not making it proper,
the Towns round us being all in the Enemy's
Hands, and the Country but indifferently plea∣sed
with us; however, we stood facing them
till they thought fit to march away. Thus we
were supplied with Horses enough to remount
our Men, and pursued our first Defign of get∣ting
into <HI>Lancashire.</HI> As for our Prisoners, we
let them go off on Foot.</P>
<P>But the Country being by this time alarmed,
and the Rout of our Army every where known,
we foresaw Abundance of Difficulties before us;
we were not strong enough to venture into
any great Towns, and we were too many to
be concealed in small ones. Upon this we re∣solved
to halt in a great Wood about three
Miles beyond the Place, where we had the last
Skirmish, and sent out Scouts to discover the
<PB N="248" REF="254"/>
Country, and learn what they could, either of
the Enemy, or of our Friends.</P>
<P>Any Body may suppose we had but indiffe∣rent
Quarters here, either for our selves or for
our Horses; but however, we made shift to lye
here two Days and one Night. In the interim
I took upon me, with two more, to go to <HI>Leeds</HI> to
learn some News; we were disguised like Coun∣try
Ploughmen; the Clothes we got at a Farmer's
House, which for that particular Occasion we
plundered; and I cannot say no Blood was shed
in a Manner too rash, and which I could not
have done at another Time; but our Case was
desperate, and the People too surly, and shot
at us out the Window, wounded one Man and
shot a Horse, which we counted as great a Lofs
to us as a Man, for our Safety depended upon our
Horses. Here we got Clothes of all Sorts enough
for both Sexes, and thus dressing my self up <HI>a
la Paisant,</HI> with a white Cap on my Head, and
a Fork on my Shoulder, and one of my Come∣rades
in the Farmer's Wife's Russet Gown and
Petticoat, like a Woman; the other with an old
Crutch like a lame Man, and all mounted on
such Horses as we had taken the Day before
from the Country. Away we go to <HI>Leeds</HI> by
three several Ways, and agreed to meet upon
the Bridge. My pretended Country Woman
acted her Part to the Life, though the Party
was a Gentleman of good Quality of the Earl
of <HI>Worcester</HI>'s Family, and the Cripple did as
well he; but I thought my self very awkward
in my Dress, which made me very shy, especi∣ally
among the Soldiers. We passed their Cen∣tinels
and Guards at <HI>Leeds</HI> unobserved, and put
up our Horses at several Houses in the Town,
from whence we went up and down to make
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
our Remarks. My Cripple was the fittest to
go among the Soldiers, because there was less
Danger of being pressed: There he informed
himself of the Matters of War, particularly that
the Enemy sat down again to the Siege of <HI>York;</HI>
that flying Parties were in Pursuit of the Ca∣valiers;
and there he heard that 500 Horse of
the Lord <HI>Manchester</HI>'s Men had followed a Party
of Cavaliers over <HI>Bramham Moor;</HI> and, that en∣tering
a Lane, the Cavaliers, who were 1000
strong, fell upon them, and killed them all but
about 50. This, though it was a Lie, was very
pleasant to us to hear, knowing it was our Par∣ty,
because of the other part of the Story, which
was thus; that the Cavaliers had taken Posses∣sion
of such a Wood, where they rallied all the
Troops of their flying Army; that they had
plundered the Country as they came, taking all
the Horses they could get; that they had plun∣dered
Goodman <HI>Thompson</HI>'s House, which was the
Farmer I mentioned, and killed Man, Woman
and Child; and that they were about 2000
strong.</P>
<P>My other Friend in Woman's Clothes got a∣mong
the good Wives at an Inn, where she set
up her Horse, and there she heard the same sad
and dreadsul Tidings; and that this Party was
so strong, none of the neighbouring Garrisons
durst stir out; but that they had sent Expresses
to <HI>York</HI> for a Party of Horse to come to their
Assistance.</P>
<P>I walked up and down the Town, but fanci∣ed
my self so ill disguised, and so easy to be
known, that I cared not to talk with any Bo∣dy.
We met at the Bridge exactly at our Time,
and compared our Intelligence, found it answe∣red
our End of coming, and that we had no∣thing
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
to do but to get back to our Men; but
my Cripple told me, we would not stir till he
bought some Victuals: So away he hops with
his Crutch, and buys four or five great Pieces
of Bacon, as many of hung Beef, and two or
three Loaves; and, borrowing a Sack at the
Inn (which I suppose he never restored,) he
loads his Horse, and, getting a large Leather
Bottle, he filled that of <HI>Aquavitae</HI> instead of small
Beer; my Woman Comerade did the like. I was
uneasy in my Mind, and took no Care but to
get out of the Town; however, we all came off
well enough; but 'twas well for me that I had
no Provisions with me, as you will hear pre∣sently.
We came, as I said, into the Town by
several Ways, and so we went out; but about
three Miles from the Town we met again ex∣actly
where we had agreed: I being about a
Quarter of a Mile from the rest, I meets three
Country Fellows on Horseback; one had a long
Pole on his Shoulder, another a Fork, the third
no Weapon at all, that I saw; I gave them the
Road very orderly, being habited like one of
their Brethren; but one of them stopping short
at me, and looking earnestly, calls out, <HI>Hark
thee, Friend,</HI> says he, in a broad North Country
Tone, <HI>whar hast thou thilk Horse?</HI> I must confess
I was in the utmost Confusion at the Question,
neither being able to answer the Question, nor
to speak in his Tone, so I made as if I did not
hear him, and went on. <HI>Na, but ye's not gang soa,</HI>
says the Boor, and comes up to me, and takes
hold of the Horse's Bridle to stop me; at which,
vexed at Heart that I could not tell how to talk
to him, I reached him a great Knock on the Pate
with my Fork, and setched him off of his Horse,
and then began to mend my Pace. The other
<PB N="251" REF="257"/>
Clowns, though it seems they knew not what
the Fellow wanted, pursued me, and, finding
they had better Heels than I, I saw there was
no Remedy but to make use of my Hands, and
faced about. The first that came up with me
was he that had no Weapons, so I thought I might
parley with him; and, speaking as Country like
as I could, I asked him what he wanted? <HI>Thou'st
knaw that soon,</HI> says <HI>Yorkshire, and Ise but come at
thee. Then keep awa' Man,</HI> said I, <HI>or Ise brain thee.</HI>
By this Time the third Man came up, and the
Parley ended; for he gave me no Words but
laid at me with his long Pole, and that with
such Fury, that I began to be doubtful of him:
I was loath to shoot the Fellow, though I had
Pistols under my grey Frock, as well for that
the Noise of a Pistol might bring more People
in, the Village being on our Rear; and also be∣cause
I could not imagine what the Fellow
meant, or would have; but at last finding he
would be too many for me with that long Wea∣pon,
and a hardy strong Fellow, I threw
my self off of my Horse, and running in with
him, stabbed my Fork into his Horse; the Horse
being wounded, staggered a while, and then fell
down, and the Booby had not the Sense to get
down in time, but fell with him; upon which,
giving him a knock or two with my Fork, I
secured him. The other, by this Time, had fur∣nished
himself with a great Stick out of a Hedge,
and, before I was disingaged from the last Fellow,
gave me two such Blows, that if the last had
not missed my Head, and hit me on the Shoul∣der,
I had ended the Fight and my Life to∣gether.
'Twas time to look about me now,
for this was a mad Man; I defended my self
with my Fork, but 'twould not do; at last, in
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
short, I was forced to Pistol him, and get on
Horseback again, and, with all the Speed I
could make get away to the Wood to our Men.</P>
<P>If my two Fellow Spies had not been behind,
I had never known what was the Meaning of
this Quarrel of the three Countrymen, but
my Cripple had all the Particulars; for he be∣ing
behind us, as I have already observed,
when he came up to the first Fellow, who be∣gan
the Fray, he found him beginning to come
to himself; so he gets off, and pretends to help
him, and sets him up upon his Breech, and be∣ing
a very merry Fellow, talked to him, <HI>Well
and what's the Matter now,</HI> says he to him, <HI>an
wae's me,</HI> says the Fellow, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is killed: Not quite
Mon,</HI> says the Cripple. O that's <HI>a fau Thief,</HI>
says he, and thus they parlied. My Cripple
got him on's Feet, and gave him a Dram of
his <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> Bottle, and made much of him,
in order to know what was the Occasion of the
Quarrel. Our disguised Woman pitied the Fel∣low
too, and together they set him up again
upon his Horse, and then he told him that
that Fellow was got upon one of his Brother's
Horses who lived at <HI>Wetherby:</HI> They said the
Cavaliers stole him, but 'twas like such Rogues;
no Mischief could be done in the Country, but
'twas the poor Cavaliers must bear the Blame,
and the like; and thus they jogged on till they
came to the Place where the other two lay.
The first Fellow they assisted as they had done
t'other, and gave him a Dram out of the Lea∣ther
Bottle; but the last Fellow was past their
Care; so they came away: For when they un∣derstood
that 'twas my Horse, they claimed,
they began to be assraid that their own Horses
might be known too, and then they had been
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
betraid in a worse Pickle than I, and must
have been forced to have done some Mischief
or other to have got away.</P>
<P>I had sent out two Troopers to fetch them
off, if their was any Occasion; but their Stay
was not long, and the two Troopers saw
them at a Distance coming towards us, so they
returned.</P>
<P>I had enough of going for a Spy, and my
Companions had enough of staying in the Wood;
for other Intelligences agreed with ours, and all
concurred in this, that it was time to be going;
however, this Use we made of it, that while
the Country thought us so strong we were in
the lefs Danger of being attacked, though in
the more of being observed; but all this while
we heard nothing of our Friends, till the next
Day. We heard Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with about 1000
Horse, was at <HI>Skipton,</HI> and from thence marched
away to <HI>Westmoreland.</HI></P>
<P>We concluded now we had two or three Days
time good; for, since Messengers were sent to
<HI>York</HI> for a Party to suppress us, we must have
at least two Days March of them, and there∣fore
all concluded we were to make the best of
our Way; early in the Morning therefore we
decamped from those dull Quarters; and as we
marched through a Village, we found the Peo∣ple
very civil to us, and the Woman cried out,
<HI>God bless them, 'tis pity the Roundheads should make
such Woork with such brave Men,</HI> and the like. Find∣ing
we were among our Friends, we resolved to
halt a little and refresh our selves; and, indeed,
the People were very kind to us, gave us Victuals
and Drink, and took Care of our Horses. It
happened to be my Lot to stop at a House where
the good Woman took a great deal of Pains
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
to provide for us; but I observed the good Man
walked about with a Cap upon his Head, and
very much out of Order, I took no great No∣tice
of it, being very sleepy, and having asked
my Landlady to let me have a Bed, I lay down
and slept heartily: When I waked I found
my Landlord on another Bed groaning very
heavily.</P>
<P>When I came down Stairs, I found my Crip∣ple
talking with my Landlady; he was now out of
his Disguise, but we called him Cripple still;
and the other, who put on the Woman's Clothes,
we called Goody <HI>Thompson.</HI> As soon as he saw
me, he called me out, <HI>Do you know,</HI> says he <HI>the
Man of the House you are quartered in? No, not I,</HI>
says I. <HI>No, so I believe, nor they you,</HI> says he, <HI>if
they did, the good Wife would not have made you a
Posset, and fetched a white Loaf for you. What do
you mean,</HI> says I. <HI>Have you seen the Man</HI> says he?
<HI>Seen him,</HI> says I, <HI>yes, and heard him too; the Man's
Sick, and groans so heavily,</HI> says I, <HI>that I could not
lye upon the Bed any longer for him. Why, this is
the poor Man,</HI> says he, <HI>that you knocked down with
your Fork Yesterday, and I have had all the Story out
yonder at the next Door.</HI> I confess it grieved me to
have been forced to treat one so roughly who
was one of our Friends, but to make some a∣mends,
we contrived to give the poor Man his
Brother's Horse; and my Cripple told him a
formal Story, that he believed the Horse was
taken away from the Fellow by some of our
Men; and, if he knew him again, if 'twas his
Friend's Horse, he should have him. The Man
came down upon the News, and I caused fix or
seven Horses, which were taken at the same
time, to be shewn him; he immediately chose
the right; so I gave him the Horse, and we
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
pretended a great deal of Sorrow for the Man's
Hurt; and that we had not knocked the Fellow
on the Head as well as took away the Horse.
The Man was so over-joyed at the Revenge he
thought was taken on the Fellow, that we heard
him groan no more. We ventured to stay all
Day at this Town, and the next Night, and got
Guides to lead us to <HI>Blackstone Edge,</HI> a Ridge of
Mountains which part this Side of <HI>Yorkshire</HI> from
<HI>Lancashire.</HI> Early in the Morning we marched,
and kept our Scouts very carefully out every
Way, who brought us no News for this Day;
we kept on all Night, and made our Horses do
Penance for that little Rest they had, and the
next Morning we passed the Hills, and got into
<HI>Lancashire,</HI> to a Town called <HI>Littlebury;</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Rochedale,</HI> a little Market-Town. And
now we thought our selves sase as to the Pursuit
of Enemies from the Side of <HI>York;</HI> our Design
was to get to <HI>Bolton,</HI> but all the County was
full of the Enemy in flying Parties, and how to
get to <HI>Bolton</HI> we knew not. At last we resolved
to send a Messenger to <HI>Bolton;</HI> but he came back
and told us, he had with lurking and hiding,
tried all the Ways that he thought possible, but
to no Purpose; for he could not get into the
Town. We sent another, and he never retur∣ned;
and some time after we understood he was
taken by the Enemy. At lost one got into the
Town, but brought us Word, they were tired
out with constant Alarms, had been straitly
blocked up, and every Day expected a Siege,
and therefore advised us either to go North∣ward,
where Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Go∣ring</HI>
ranged at Liberty; or to get over <HI>Warring∣ton</HI>
Bridge, and so secure our Retreat to <HI>Chester.</HI>
This double Direction divided our Opinions; I
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
was for getting into <HI>Chester,</HI> both to recruit my
self with Horses and with Money, both which
I wanted, and to get Refreshment, which we all
wanted; but the major Part of our Men were
for the North. First they said, there was their
General, and 'twas their Duty to the Cause,
and the King's Interest obliged us to go
where we could do best Service; and there
was their Friends, and every Man might hear
some News of his own Regiment, for we belonged
to several Regiments; besides, all the Towns to
to the Left of us, were possessed by Sir <HI>William
Brereton, Warrington</HI> and <HI>Northwich,</HI> Garrisoned by
the Enemy, and a strong Party at <HI>Manchester;</HI> so
that 'twas very likely we should be beaten and
dispersed before we could get to <HI>Chester.</HI> These
Reasons, and especially the last, determined us
for the North, and we had resolved to march
the next Morning, when other Intelligence
brought us to more speedy Resolutions. We kept
our Scouts continually abroad, to bring us In∣telligence
of the Enemy, whom we expected on
our Backs, and also to keep an Eye upon the
Country; for as we lived upon them something
at large, they were ready enough to do us any
ill Turn, as it lay in their Power.</P>
<P>The first Messenger that came to us, was from
our Friends at <HI>Bolton,</HI> to inform us, that they
were preparing at <HI>Manchester</HI> to attack us: One
of our Parties had been as far as <HI>Stockport,</HI> on
the Edge of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and was pursued by a Party
of the Enemy, but got off by the Help of the
Night. Thus all things looking black to the
South, we had resolved to march Northward
in the Morning, when one of our Scouts from
the Side of <HI>Manchester</HI> assured us, Sir <HI>Thomas Mid∣dleton,</HI>
with some of the Parliament Forces, and
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
the Country Troops, making above 1200 Men,
were on their March to attack us, and would
certainly beat up our Quarters that Night, Up∣on
this Advice we resolved to be gone; and
getting all things in Readiness, we began to
march about two Hours before Night: And
having gotten a trusty Fellow for a Guide, a
Fellow that we found was a Friend to our Side,
he put a Project into my Head, which saved us
all for that time; and that was, to give out in
the Village, that we were marched back to <HI>York∣shire,</HI>
resolving to get into <HI>Pontfract</HI> Castle; and
accordingly he leads us out of the Town the
same way we came in; and taking a Boy with
him, he sends the Boy back just at Night, and
bad him say he saw us go up the Hills at <HI>Black∣stone-Edge;</HI>
and it happened very well; for this
Party were so sure of us, that they had placed
400 Men on the Road to the Northward, to
intercept our Retreat that Way, and had left
no Way for us, as they thought, to get away,
but back again.</P>
<P>About Ten a Clock at Night, they assaulted
our Quarters, but found we were gone; and be∣ing
informed which way, they followed upon
the Spur, and travelling all Night, being Moon-Light,
they found themselves the next Day
about 15 Miles East, just out of their Way; for
we had by the Help of our Guide, turned short
at the Foot of the Hills, and through blind, un∣trodden
Paths, and with Difficulty enough, by
Noon the next Day, had reached almost 25
Miles North near a Town called <HI>Clithero.</HI> Here
we halted in the open Field, and sent out our
People to see how things were in the Country.
This Part of the Country almost unpassable,
and walled round with Hills, was indifferent
quiet, and we got some Refreshment for our
<PB N="258" REF="264"/>
selves, but very little Horsemeat, and so went
on; but we had not marched far before we found
our selves discovered; and the 400 Horse sent to
lye in wait for us as before, having underftood
which way we went, followed us hard; and by
Letters to some of their Friends at <HI>Preston,</HI> we
found we were beset again. Our Guide began
now to be out of his Knowledge, and our Scouts
brought us Word, the Enemy's Horse was posted
before us, and we knew they were in our Rear.
In this Exigence, we resolved to divide our
small Body, and so amusing them, at least one
might get off, if the other miscarried. I took
about 80 Horse with me, among which were
all that I had of our own Regiment, amounting
to above 32, and took the Hills towards <HI>York∣shire.</HI>
Here we met with such unpassable Hills,
vast Moors, Rocks, and stony Ways, as lamed
all our Horses, and tired our Men; and some∣times
I was ready to think we should never be
able to get over them, till our Horfes failing, and
Jack-boots being but indifferent things to tra∣vel
in, we might be starved before we should
find any Road, or Towns, (for Guide we had
none) but a Boy who knew but little, and would
cry, when we asked him any Questions. I believe
neither Men nor Horses ever passed in some Pla∣ces
where we went, and for 20 Hours we saw
not a Town nor a House, excepting sometimes
from the Top of the Mountains, at a vaft Di∣stance.
I am perswaded we might have encam∣ped
here, if we had had Provisions, till the War
had been over, and have met with no Distur∣bance;
and I have osten wondered since, how we
got into such horrible Places, as much as how got
out. That which was worse to us than all the
reft, was, that we knew not where we were going,
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
nor what Part of the Country we should come
into, when we came out of those desolate Craggs.
At last, after a terrible Fatigue, we began to
see the Western Parts of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> some sew Vil∣lages,
and the Country at a Distance, looked
a little like <HI>England;</HI> for I thought before it
looked like old <HI>Brennus</HI> Hill, which the <HI>Grisons</HI> call
the Grandfather of the <HI>Alps.</HI> We got some
Relief in the Villages, which indeed some of us
had so much need of, that they were hardly able
to sit their Horses, and others were forced to
help them off, they were so faint. I never selt so
much of the Power of Hunger in my Life; for
having not eaten in 30 Hours, I was as ravenous
as a Hound; and if I had had a Piece of Horse∣flesh,
I believe I should not have had Patience to
have staid Dressing it, but have fallen upon
it raw, and have eaten it as greedily as a
<HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
<P>However, I eat very cautiously, having osten
seen the Danger of Mens eating heartily after
long Fasting. Our next Care was to enquire out
Way. <HI>Hallifax,</HI> they told us, was on our right;
there we durst not think of going; <HI>Skippon</HI> was
before us, and there we knew not how it was;
for a Body of 3000 Horse, sent out by the Enemy
in Pursuit of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> had been there but
two Days before, and the Country People could
not tell us, whether they were gone, or no:
And <HI>Manchester</HI>'s Horse, which were sent out
after our Party, were then at <HI>Hallifax,</HI> in Quest
of us, and afterwards marched into <HI>Cheshire.</HI> In
this Distress we would have hired a Guide,
but none of the Country People would go with
us; for the Roundheads would hang them, they
faid, when they came there. Upon this I called
a Fellow to me, <HI>Harke ye friend,</HI> says I, <HI>dost thee
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
know the Way so as to bring us into</HI> Westmoreland,
<HI>and not keep the great Road from</HI> York? <HI>Ay merry,</HI> says
he, <HI>I ken the Ways weel enou; and you would go and
guide us,</HI> said I, <HI>but that you are afraid the Roundheads
will bang you? Indeed would I,</HI> says the Fellow. <HI>Why
then,</HI> says I, <HI>thou hadst as good be hanged by a Round∣head
as a Cavalier; for if thou wilt not go, I'll hang
thee just now. Na, and ye serve me soa,</HI> says the Fel∣low,
<HI>Ise ene gang with ye; for I care not for Hang∣ing;
and ye'l get me a good Horse, Ise gang and be one
of ye, for I'll nere come heame mere.</HI> This pleased
us still better, and we mounted the Fellow;
for three of our Men died that Night with
the extreme Fatigue of the last Service.</P>
<P>Next Morning, when our new Trooper was
mounted and cloathed, we hardly knew him;
and this Fellow led us by such Ways, such
Wildernesses, and yet with such Prudence,
keeping the Hills to the left, that we might
have the Villages to resresh our selves, that
without him, we had certainly either perished
in those Mountains, or fallen into the Enemy's
Hands. We passed the great Road from <HI>York</HI> so
critically as to time, that from one of the Hills
he shewed us a Party of the Enemy's Horse,
who were then marching into <HI>Westmoreland.</HI> We
lay still that Day, finding we were not discove∣red
by them; and our Guide proved the best
Scout that we could have had; for he would go
out ten Miles at a time, and bring us in all the
News of the Country: Here he brought us
word, that <HI>York</HI> was surrendered upon Articles,
and that <HI>Newcastle,</HI> which had been surprized
by the King's Party, was besieged by another
Army of <HI>Scots</HI> advanced to help their Brethren.</P>
<P>Along the Edges of those vast Mountains we
past with the Help of our Guide, till we came
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
into the Forest of <HI>Swale;</HI> and finding our selves
perfectly concealed here, for no Soldier had
ever been here all the War, nor perhaps would
not, if it had lasted 7 Years; we thought we
wanted a few Days Rest, at least for our Horses,
so we resolved to halt, and while we did so,
we made some Disguises, and sent out some
Spies into the Country; but as here were no
great Towns, nor no Post Road, we got very little
Intelligence. We rested four Days, and then
marched again; and indeed having no great
Stock of Money about us, and not very free of
that we had, four Days was enough for those
poor Places to be able to maintain us.</P>
<P>We thought our selves pretty secure now;
but our chief Care was how to get over those
terrible Mountains; for having passed the great
Road that leads from <HI>York</HI> to <HI>Lancaster,</HI> the
Craggs, the farther Northward we looked,
look'd still the worse, and our Business was all
on the other Side. Our Guide told us, he would
bring us out, if we would have Patience, which
we were obliged to, and kept on this slow
March, till he brought us to <HI>Stanhope,</HI> in the
County of <HI>Durham;</HI> where some of <HI>Goring</HI>'s
Horse, and two Regiments of Foot, had their
Quarters: This was 19 Days from the Battle
of <HI>Marston-Moor.</HI> The Prince who was then at
<HI>Kendal</HI> in <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> and who had given me
over as lost, when he had News of our Arrival,
sent an Express to me, to meet him at <HI>Appleby.</HI>
I went thither accordingly, and gave him an
Account of our Journey, and there I heard the
short History of the other Part of our Men,
whom we parted from in <HI>Lancashire.</HI> They made
the best of their way North; they had two
resolute Gentlemen who commanded; and be∣ing
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
so closely pursued by the Enemy, that they
found themselves under a Necessity of Fighting,
they halted, and faced about, expecting the
Charge. The Boldness of the Action made the
Officer who led the Enemy's Horse (which it
seems were the County Horse only) afraid of
them; which they perceiving, taking the Advan∣tage
of his Fears, bravely advance, and charge
them; and, though they were above 200 Horse,
they routed them, killed about 30 or 40, got
some Horses, and some Money, and pushed on
their March Night and Day; but coming near
<HI>Lancaster,</HI> they were so way-laid and pursued,
that they agreed to separate, and shirt every
Man for himself; many of them fell into the
Enemy's Hands; some were killed attempting
to pass through the River <HI>Lune;</HI> some went
back again, six or seven got to <HI>Bolton,</HI> and about
18 got safe to Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince was in a better Condition here∣abouts
than I expected; he and my Lord <HI>Goring.</HI>
with the Help of Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and
the Gentlemen of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> had gotten a Body
of 4000 Horse, and about 6000 Foot; they had
retaken <HI>Newcastle, Iinmouth, Durham, Stockton,</HI>
and several Towns of Consequence from the
<HI>Scots,</HI> and might have cut them out Work
enough still, if that base People, resolved to
engage their whole Interest to ruine their Sove∣reign,
had not senta second Army of 10000 Men,
under the Earl of <HI>Calender,</HI> to help their first.
These came and laid Siege to <HI>Newcastle,</HI> but
found more vigorous Resistance now than they
had done before.</P>
<P>There were in the Town Sir <HI>John Morley,</HI> the
Lord <HI>Crawford,</HI> Lord <HI>Rea,</HI> and <HI>Maxwell, Scots;</HI>
and old Soldiers, who were resolved their Coun∣trymen
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
should buy the Town very dear if they
had it; and had it not been for our Disaster at
<HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> they had never had it; for <HI>Calen∣der,</HI>
finding he was not able to carry the Town,
sends to General <HI>Levin</HI> to come from the Siege
of <HI>York</HI> to help him.</P>
<P>Mean time the Prince forms a very good
Army, and the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> with 10000 Men
shews himself on the Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to try
if that might not cause the <HI>Scots</HI> to recal their
Forces; and, I am perswaded had he entered
<HI>Scotland,</HI> the Parliament of <HI>Scotland</HI> had recalled
the Earl of <HI>Calender,</HI> for they had but 5000 Men
lest in Arms to send against him; but they were
loath to venture.</P>
<P>However, this Effect it had, that it called the
<HI>Scots</HI> Northward again, and found them Work
there for the rest of the Summer, to reduce the
several Towns in the Bishoprick of <HI>Durham.</HI></P>
<P>I found with the Prince the poor Remains of
my Regiment, which when joined with those
that had been with me, could not all make up
three Troops, and but two Captains, three Lieu∣tenants,
and one Cornet; the rest were disper∣sed,
killed, or taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>However, with those, which we still called a
Regiment, I joined the Prince, and after ha∣ving
done all we could on that Side, the <HI>Scots</HI> be∣ing
returned from <HI>York,</HI> the Prince returned
through <HI>Lancashire</HI> to <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy often appeared and alarmed us,
and once fell on one of our Parties, and killed
us about a hundred Men; but we were too many
for them to pretend to fight us, so we came to
<HI>Bolton,</HI> beat the Troops of the Enemy near <HI>War∣rington,</HI>
where I got a Cut with a Halbard in
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
my Face, and arrived at <HI>Chester</HI> the beginning
of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>The Parliament, upon their great Success in
the North, thinking the King's Forces quite
broken, had sent their General <HI>Essex</HI> into the
West, where the King's Army was comman∣ded
by Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s elder Bro∣ther,
but not very strong; and the King being,
as they supposed, by the Absence of Prince <HI>Ru∣pert,</HI>
weakened so much as, that he might be
checked by Sir <HI>William Waller,</HI> who, with 4500
Foot, and 1500 Horse, was at that Time about
<HI>Winchester,</HI> having lately beaten Sir <HI>Ralph Hopton.</HI>
Upon all these Considerations, the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI>
marches Westward.</P>
<P>The Forces in the West being too weak to
oppose him, every thing give way to him, and
all People expected he would besiege <HI>Exeter,</HI>
where the Queen was newly lying in, and sent
a Trumpet to desire he would forbear the City,
while she could be removed; which he did, and
passed on Westward, took <HI>Tiverton, Biddeford,
Barnstble, Lanceston,</HI> relieved <HI>Plymouth,</HI> drove Sir
<HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> up into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and followed
him thither, but lest Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> behind
him with 4000 Men about <HI>Barnstable,</HI> and <HI>Exe∣ter.</HI>
The King, in the mean time, marches
from <HI>Oxford</HI> into <HI>Worcester,</HI> with <HI>Waller</HI> at his
Heels; at <HI>Edgehill</HI> his Majesty turns upon <HI>Waller,</HI>
and gave him a Brush, to put him in mind of
the Place; the King goes on to <HI>Worcester,</HI> sends
300 Horse to relieve <HI>Durley</HI> Castle, besieged
by the Earl of <HI>Denby,</HI> and sending Part of his
Proces to <HI>Brisral,</HI> returns to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty had now firmly resolved to march
into the West, not having yet any Account of
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>
our Missortunes in the North. <HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>Mid∣dleton</HI>
way-lay the King at <HI>Cropedy</HI> Bridge;
The King assaults <HI>Middleton</HI> at the Bridge; <HI>Wal∣ler</HI>'s
Men were posted with some Cannon to guard
a pass; <HI>Middleton</HI>'s Men put a Regiment of the
King's Foot to the Rout, and pursued them:
<HI>Waller</HI>'s Men, willing to come in for the Plun∣der,
a thing their General had often used them
to, quit their Post at the Pass, and their great.
Guns, to have Part in the Victory. The King
coming in seaonably to the Relief of his Men,
routs <HI>Middleton,</HI> and at the same time sends a
Party round, who clapt in between Sir <HI>Wil∣liam
Waller's</HI> Men and their great Guns, and secur∣ed
the Pass and the Cannon too.</P>
<P>The King took three Collonels, besides other
Officers, and about 300 Men Prisoners, with
eight great Guns, 19-Carriages of Ammunition,
and killed about 200 Men.</P>
<P><HI>Waller</HI> lost his Reputation in this Fight, and
was exceedingly slighted ever after, even by
his own Party; but especially by such as were
of General <HI>Essex</HI>'s Party, between whom and
<HI>Waller</HI> there had been Jealousies and Misunder∣standings
for some time.</P>
<P>The King, about 8000 strong, marched on to
<HI>Bristol,</HI> where Sir <HI>William Hopton</HI> joined him; and
from thence he follows <HI>Essex</HI> into <HI>Cornwall; Essex</HI>
still following <HI>Greenvil,</HI> the King comes to <HI>Exeter,</HI>
and joining with Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> resolves to
pursue <HI>Essex;</HI> and now the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> began
to see his Mistake, being cooped up between
two Seas, the King's Army in his Rear, the
Country his Enemy, and Sir <HI>Richard Grenvil</HI> in
his Van.</P>
<P>The King, who always took the best Measures,
when he was left to his own Counsel, wisely
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
refuses to engage, though superior in Number,
and much stronger in Horse. <HI>Essex</HI> often drew
out to fight, but the King fortifies, takes the
Passes and Bridges, Plants Cannon, and secures
the Country to keep off Provisions, and conti∣nually
streightens their Quarters, but would
not fight.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Essex</HI> sends away to the Parliament for
Help, and they write to <HI>Waller,</HI> and <HI>Middleton,</HI>
and <HI>Manchester,</HI> to follow, and come up with the
King in his Rear; but some were too far off, and
could not, as <HI>Manchester</HI> and <HI>Fairfax;</HI> others
made no Haste, as having no mind to it, as <HI>Wal∣ler</HI>
and <HI>Middleton,</HI> and if they had, it had been
too late.</P>
<P>At last the Earl of <HI>Essex</HI> finding nothing to be
done, and unwilling to fall into the King's Hands,
takes Shipping, and leaves his Army to shift
for themselves. The Horse, under Sir <HI>Wil∣tion
Balfour,</HI> the best Horse-Officer, and, with∣out
Comparison, the bravest in all the Parlia∣ment
Army, advanced in small Parties, as if to
Skirmish, but following in with the whole
Body, being 3500 Horse, broke through, and
got off. Though this was a Loss to the King's
Victory, yet the Foot were now in a Condition
so much the worse. Brave old <HI>Skippon</HI> proposed
to fight through with the Foot and die, as he
called, it, like <HI>English</HI> Men, with Sword in Hand;
but the rest of the Officers shook their Heads
at it; for, being well paid, they had at present no
Occasion for dying.</P>
<P>Seeing it thus, they agreed to treat, and the
King grants them Conditions, upon laying down
their Arms, to march off free. This was too
much; had his Majesty but obliged them upon
Oath not to serve again for a certain Time, he
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
had done his Business; but this was not thought
of; so they passed free, only disarmed, the
Soldiers not being allowed so much as their
Swords.</P>
<P>The King gained by this Treaty 40 Pieces of
Cannon, all of Brass, 300 Barrels of Gunpowder,
9000 Arms, 8000 Swords, Match and Bullet
in Proportion, 200 Waggons, 150 Colours and
Standards, all the Bag and Baggage of the Army,
and about 1000 of the Men listed in his Army.
This was a compleat Victory without Blood∣shed;
and, had the King but secured the Men
from serving but for six Months, it had most
effectually answered the Battle of <HI>Marston-Moor.</HI></P>
<P>As it was, it infused new Life into all his
Majesty's Forces and Friends, and retrieved
his Affairs very much; but especially it encou∣raged
us in the North, who were more sensi∣ble
of the Blow received at <HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> and of
the Destruction the <HI>Scots</HI> were bringing upon
us all.</P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Chester,</HI> we had some small
Skirmishes with Sir <HI>William Brereton.</HI> One Mor∣ning
in particular Sir <HI>William</HI> drew up, and
faced us, and one of our Collonels of Horse
observing the Enemy to be not, as he thought,
above 200, desires Leave of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to
attack them with the like Number, and accor∣dingly
he sallied out with 200 Horse. I stood
drawn up without the City with 800 more,
ready to bring him off, if he should be put to
the worst, which happened accordingly; for,
not having discovered neither the Country nor
the Enemy as he ought, Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI>
drew him into an Ambuscade; so that before
he came up with Sir <HI>William</HI>'s Forces, near
enough to charge, he finds about 300 Horse
<PB N="268" REF="274"/>
of my Father's House, I might soon recruit it,
my Father having got some Men together
already, I defired Leave to lye at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> for
a Month, to make up my Men. Accordingly
having obtained his Leave, I marched to <HI>Wrex∣ham,</HI>
where, in two Days time I got 20 Men,
and so on to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> I had not been here
above 10 Days, but I received an Express to
come away with what Recruits I had got to∣gether,
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> having positive Orders to
meet the King by a certain Day. I had not
mounted 100 Men, though I had listed above
200, when these Orders came; but leaving
my Father to compleat them for me, I marched
with those I had, and came to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>The King, after the Rout of the Parliament
Forces in the West, was marched back, took
<HI>Barnstable, Plympton, Lanceston, Tiverton,</HI> and se∣veral
other Places, and left <HI>Plymouth</HI> besieged
by Sir <HI>Richard Grenvil,</HI> met with Sir <HI>William Wal∣ler</HI>
at <HI>Shaftsbury</HI> and again at <HI>Andover,</HI> and
boxed him at both Places, and marched for
<HI>Newberry.</HI> Here the King sent for Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>
to meet him, who with 3000 Horse made long
Marches to join him; but the Parliament ha∣ving
joined their three Armies together, <HI>Man∣chefter</HI>
from the North, <HI>Waller</HI> and <HI>Essex,</HI> the
Men being cloathed and armed, from the West,
had attacked the King, and obliged him to
fight the Day, before the Prince came up.</P>
<P>The King had so posted himself, as that he
could not be obliged to fight but with Advan∣tage;
the Parliament's Forces being superior
in Number, and therefore, when they attacked
him, he galled them with his Cannon, and de∣clining
to come to a general Battle, stood upon
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
in his Reat: Though he was surprized at this,
yet, being a Man of a ready Courage, he boldly
faces about with 150 of his Men, leaving the
other 50 to face Sir <HI>William.</HI> With this small
Party, he desperately charges the 300 Horse in
his Rear, and putting them into Disorder,
breaks through them, and, had there been no
greater Force, he had cut them all in Pieces-Flushed
with this Success, and loath to desert
the 50 Men he had left behind, he faces about
again, and charges through them again, and with
these two Charges entirely routs them. Sir
<HI>William Brereton</HI> finding himself a little disap∣pointed,
advances, and falls upon the 50 Men
just as the Collonel came up to them; they
fought him with a great deal of Bravery, but
the Collonel being unfortunately killed in the
first Charge, the Men gave Way, and came
flying all in Confusion, with the Enemy at
their Heels. As soon as I saw this, I advanced,
according to my Orders, and the Enemy, as
soon as I appeared, gave over the Pursuit. This
Gentleman, as I remember, was Collonel <HI>Mor∣rough;</HI>
we fetched off his Body, and retreated
into <HI>Chester.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning the Prince drew out of the
City with about 1200 Horse and 2000 Foot,
and attacked Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> in his Quar∣ters.
The Fight was very sharp for the time,
and near 700 Men, on both Sides, were killed;
but Sir <HI>William</HI> would not put it to a general
Engagement, so the Prince drew off, contenting
himself to have insulted him in his Quarters.</P>
<P>We now had received Orders from the King
to join him; but I representing to the Prince
the Condition of my Regiment, which was
now 100 Men, and, that being within 25 Miles
<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
the Defensive, expecting Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with
the Horse.</P>
<P>The Parliament's Forces had some Advantage
over our Foot, and took the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>
Prisoner; but the King, whose Foot were not
above one to two, drew his Men under the
Cannon of <HI>Dennington</HI> Castle, and having secured
his Artillery and Baggage, made a Retreat with
his Foot in very good Order, having not lost
in all the Fight above 300 Men, and the Par∣liament
as many: We lost five Pieces of Can∣non
and took two, having repulsed the Earl of
<HI>Manchester</HI>'s Men on the North Side of the
Town, with considerable Loss.</P>
<P>The King, having lodged his Train of Ar∣tillery
and Baggage in <HI>Dennington</HI> Castle, mar∣ched
the next Day for <HI>Oxford;</HI> there we joined
him with 3000 Horse, and 2000 Foot. Encou∣raged
with this Reinforcement, the King
appears upon the Hills on the North-west of
<HI>Newberry,</HI> and faces the Parliament Army. The
Parliament having too many Generals as well
as Soldiers, they could not agree whether they
should fight or no. This was no great Token
of the Victory they boasted of; for they were
now twice our Number in the whole, and their
Foot three for one. The King stood in Battalia
all Day, and finding the Parliament Forces had
no Stomach to engage him, he drew away his
Cannon and Baggage out of <HI>Dennington</HI> Castle,
in View of their whole Army, and marched
away to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>This was such a false Step of the Parliament's
Generals, that all the People cried shame of
them: The Parliament appointed a Committee
to enquire into it. <HI>Cromwell</HI> accused <HI>Manchester,</HI>
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
and he <HI>Waller,</HI> and so they laid the Fault upon
one another. <HI>Waller</HI> would have been glad to
have charged it upon <HI>Essex;</HI> but as it happened
he was not in the Army, having been taken ill
some Days before; but, as it generally is when
a Mistake is made, the Actors fall out among
themselves, so it was here. No doubt it was
as false a Step as that of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> to let the King
fetch away his Baggage and Cannon in the
Face of three Armies, and never fire a Shot
at them.</P>
<P>The King had not above 8000 Foot in his
Army, and they above 25000; 'Tis true, the
King had 8000 Horse, a fine Body, and much
superior to theirs; but the Foot might, with
the greatest Ease in the World, have prevented
the removing the Cannon, and in three Days
time have taken the Castle, with all that was
in it.</P>
<P>Those Differences produced their Self-deny∣ing
Ordinance, and the putting by most of their
old Generals, as <HI>Essex, Waller, Manchester,</HI> and the
like; and Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> a terrible Man in
the Field, though the mildest of Men out of it,
was voted to have the Command of all their
Forces, and <HI>Lambert</HI> to take the Command of
Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI>'s Troops in the North, old
<HI>Skippon</HI> being Major General.</P>
<P>This Winter was spent on the Enemy's Side
in modelling, as they called it, their Army;
and, on our Side, in recruiting ours, and some
petty Excursions. Amongst the many Addres∣ses,
I observed one from <HI>Sussex</HI> or <HI>Surrey,</HI> complain∣ing
of the Rudeness of their Soldiers, and par∣ticularly
of the ravishing of Women, and the
murthering of Men; from which I only obser∣ved,
that there were Disorders among them, as
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
well as among us, only with this Difference,
that they, for Reasons I mentioned before, were
under Circumstances to prevent it better than
the King; But I must do the King's Memory
that Justice, that he used all possible Methods,
by Punishment of Soldiers, charging; and some∣times
entreating, the Gentlemen not to suffer
such Disorders and such Violences in their Men;
but it was to no Purpose for his Majesty to at∣tempt
it, while his Officers, Generals, and Great
Men, winked at it; for the Licentiousness of
the Soldier is supposed to be approved by the
Officer, when it is not corrected.</P>
<P>The Rudeness of the Parliament Soldiers be∣gan
from the Divisions among their Officers;
for, in many Places, the Soldiers grew so out
of all Discipline, and so unsufferably rude, that
they in particular refused to march when Sir
<HI>William Waller</HI> went to <HI>Weymouth.</HI> This had tur∣ned
to good Account for us, had these cursed
<HI>Scots</HI> been out of our way, but they were the
Staff of the Party; and now they were daily
sollicited to march Southward, which was a ve∣ry
great Affliction to the King, and all his
Friends.</P>
<P>One Booty the King got at this time, which
was a very seasonable Assistance to his Affairs,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) a great Merchant Ship richly laden at
<HI>London,</HI> and bound to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> was, by the
Seamen, brought into <HI>Bristol,</HI> and delivered up
to the King. Some Merchants in <HI>Bristol</HI> offered
the King 40000 1. for her, which his Majesty or∣dered
should be accepted, reserving only 30 great
Guns for his own Use.</P>
<P>The Treaty at <HI>Ʋxbridge</HI> now was begun, and
we that had been well beaten in the War, hear∣tily
wished the King would come to a Peace;
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
but we all foresaw the Clergy would ruine it all.
The Commons were for Presbytery, and would
never agree the Bishops should be restored; the
King was willinger to comply with any thing than
this, and we foresaw it would be so; from whence
we used to say among our selves, <HI>That the Clergy
was resolved if there should be no Bishop, there should
be no King.</HI></P>
<P>This Treaty at <HI>Ʋxbridge</HI> was a Perfect War
between the Men of the Gown, ours was be∣tween
those of the Sword; and I cannot but
take Notice how the Lawyers, Statesmen, and
the Clergy of every Side bestirred themselves,
rather to hinder than promote the Peace.</P>
<P>There had been a Treaty at <HI>Oxford</HI> some time
before, where the Parliament insisting that the
King should pass a Bill to abolish Episcopacy,
quit the Militia, abandon several of his faithful
Servants to be exempted from Pardon, and ma∣king
several other most extravagant Demands.
Nothing was done, but the Treasy broke off, both
Parties being rather farther exsperated, than
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n clined to hearken to Conditions.</P>
<P>However, soon after the Success in the West,
his Majesty, to let them see that Victory had
not puffed him up so as to make him reject the
Peace, sends a Message to the Parliament, to
put them in Mind of Messages of like Nature
which they had slighted; and to let them know,
that notwithstanding he had beaten their Forces,
he was yet willing to hearken to a reasonable
Proposal for putting an End to the War.</P>
<P>The Parliament pretended the King, in his
Message, did not treat with them as a legal Par∣liament,
and so made Hesitations; but after long
Debates and Delays they agreed to draw up
Propositions for Peace to be sent to the King.
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
As this Message was sent to the Houses about
<HI>August,</HI> I think they made it the middle of <HI>No∣vember</HI>
before they brought the Propositions for
Peace; and, when they brought them, they had
no Power to enter either upon a Treaty, or so
much as Preliminaries for a Treaty, only to de∣liver
the Letter, and receive an Answer.</P>
<P>However, such were the Circumstances of Af∣fairs
at this Time, that the King was uneasy
to see himself thus treated, and take no Notice
of it: The King returned an Answer to the
Propositions, and proposed a Treaty by Commis∣sioners
which the Parliament appointed.</P>
<P>Three Months more were spent in naming
Commissioners. There was much Time spent
in this Treaty, but little done; the Commissio∣ners
debated chiefly the Article of Religion, and
of the Militia; in the latter they were very
likely to agree, in the former both Sides see∣med
too positive. The King would by no Means
abandon Episcopacy, nor the Parliament Pre∣sbytery;
for both in their Opinion were <HI>sure
Divino.</HI></P>
<P>The Commissioners sinding this Point hardest
to adjust, went from it to that of the Militia;
but the Time spinning out, the King's Commis∣sioners
demanded longer Time for the Treaty;
the other sent up for Instructions, but the House
resused to lengthen out the Time.</P>
<P>This was thought an Insolence upon the King,
and gave all good People a Detestation of such
haughty Behaviour; and thus the Hopes of
Peace vanished, both Sides prepared for War
with as much Eagerness as before.</P>
<P>The Parliament was employed at this Time in
what they called a Modelling their Army; that
is to say, that now the Independent Party be∣ginning
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
to prevail; and, as they outdid all the
others in their Resolution of carrying on the
War to all Extremities, so they were both the
more vigorous and more politick Party in car∣rying
it on.</P>
<P>Indeed the War was after this carried on with
greater Annimosity than ever, and the Generals
pushed forward with a Vigour, that, as it had
something in it unusual, so it told us plainly
from this Time, whatever they did before, they
now pushed at the Ruine even of Monarchy
it self.</P>
<P>All this while also the War went on, and
though the Parliament had no settled Army, yet
their Regiments and Troops were always in
Action; and the Sword was at work in every Part
of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Among an infinite Number of Party Skir∣mishings
and Fights this Winter, one happened
which nearly concerned me, which was the Sur∣prize
of the Town and Castle of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> Col∣lonel
<HI>Mitton,</HI> with about 1200 Horse and Foot,
having Intelligence with some People in the Town,
on a <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning early broke into the Town,
and took it, Castle and all. The Loss for the Qua∣lity,
more than the Number, was very great to
the King's Affairs. They took there 15 Pieces
of Cannon, Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Magazine of Arms
and Ammunition, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Baggage, above
50 Persons of Quality and Officers: There was
not above 8 or 10 Men killed on both Sides;
for the Town was surprized, not stormed. I had
a particular Loss in this Action; for, all the
Men and Horses my Father had got together
for the recruiting my Regiment, were here lost
and dispersed; and, which was the worse, my
Father happening to be then in the Town, was
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
taken Prisoner, and carried to <HI>Beeston</HI> Castle in
<HI>Cheshire.</HI></P>
<P>I was quartered all this Winter at <HI>Banbury,</HI>
and went little abroad; nor had we any Action
till the latter end of <HI>February,</HI> when I was or∣dered
to march to <HI>Leicester</HI> with Sir <HI>Marmaduke
Langdale,</HI> in order, as we thought, to raise a
Body of Men in that County and <HI>Staffordshire,</HI> to
join the King.</P>
<P>We lay at <HI>Daventry</HI> one Night, and continu∣ing
our March to pass the River above <HI>Northam∣pton,</HI>
that Town being possessed by the Enemy,
we understood a Party of <HI>Northampton</HI> Forces
were abroad, and intended to attack us: Ac∣cordingly
in the Afternoon our Scouts brought
us Word, the Enemy were quartered in some
Villages on the Road to <HI>Coventry;</HI> our Comman∣der
thinking it much better to set upon them
in their Quarters, than to wait for them in the
Field, resolves to attack them early in the Mor∣ning,
before they were aware of it. We refre∣shed
our selves in the Field for that Day, and
getting into a great Wood near the Enemy, we
stayed there all Night, till almost break of Day,
without being discovered.</P>
<P>In the Morning very early we heard the Ene∣my's
Trumpets sound to Horse; this roused us
to look abroad; and, sending out a Scout, he
brought us Word a Party of the Enemy was at
Hand. we were vexed to be so disappointed,
but finding their Party small enough to be dealt
with, Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> ordered me to charge them
with 300 Horse and 200 Dragoons, while he at
the same Time entered the Town. According∣ly
I lay still till they came to the very Skirt of the
Wood where I was posted, when I saluted them
with a Volley from my Dragoons out of the
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
Wood, and immediately shewed my self with
my Horse on their Front, ready to charge them;
they appeared not to be surprized, and received
our Charge with great Resolution; and, being
above 400 Men, they pushed me vigorously in
their Turn, putting my Men into some Disor∣der.
In this Extremity I sent to order the Dra∣goons
to charge them in the Flank, which they
did with great Bravery, and the other still main∣tained
the Fight with desperate Resolution.
There was no want of Courage in our Men on
both Sides; but our Dragoons had the Advan∣tage,
and at last routed them, and drove them
back to the Village. Here Sir <HI>Marmaduke Lang∣dale</HI>
had his Hands full too; for my firing had
alarmed the Towns adjacent, that when he came
into the Town, he found them all in Arms; and,
contrary to his Expectation, two Regiments of
Foot, with about 500 Horse more. As Sir <HI>Mar∣maduke</HI>
had no Foot, only Horse and Dragoons,
this was a Surprize to him; but he caused his
Dragoons to enter the Town, and charge the
Foot, while his Horse secured the Avenues of
the Town.</P>
<P>The Dragoons bravely attacked the Foot, and
Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> falling in with his Horse, the
Fight was obstinate and very bloody, when the
Horse that I had routed came flying into the
Street of the Village, and my Men at their Heels.
Immediately I left the Pursuit, and fell in with
all my Force to the Assistance of my Friends,
and, after an obstinate Resistance, we routed the
whole Party; we killed about 700 Men, took
350, 27 Officers, 100 Arms, all their Baggage,
and 200 Horses, and continued our March to
<HI>Harborough,</HI> where we halted to refresh our selves.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="284"/>
Between <HI>Harborough</HI> and <HI>Leicester</HI> we met with
a Party of 800 Dragoons of the Parliament
Forces. They found themselves too few to at∣tack
us, and therefore to avoid us, they had
gotten into a small Wood; but perceiving them∣selves
discovered, they came boldly out, and
placed themselves at the Entrance into a Lane,
lining both Sides of the Hedges with their
Shot. We immediately attacked them, beat
them from their Hedges, beat them into the
Wood, and out of the Wood again, and forced
them at last to a down right <HI>Run-away,</HI> on Foot,
among the Enclosures, where we could not fol∣low
them, killed about 100 of them, and took
250 Prisoners, with all their Horses, and came
that Night to <HI>Leicester.</HI> When we came to
<HI>Leicester,</HI> and had taken up our Quarters, Sir <HI>Mar∣maduke
Langdale</HI> sent for me to sup with him,
and told me, that he had a secret Commission
in his Pocket, which his Majesty had commanded
him not to open 'till he came to <HI>Leicester;</HI> that
now he had sent for me to open it together,
that we might know what it was we were to do,
and to consider how to do it; so pulling out his
sealed Orders, we found we were to get what
Force we could together, and a certain Num∣ber
of Carriages with Ammunition which the
Governour of <HI>Leicester</HI> was to deliver us, and a
certain Quantity of Provision, especally Corn
and Salt, and to relieve <HI>Newark.</HI> This Town had
been long besieged: The Fortifications of the
Place, together with its Situation, had rendered
it the strongest Piece in <HI>England;</HI> And, as it was
the greatest Pass in <HI>England,</HI> so it was of vast
Consequence to the King's Affairs. There was
in it a Garrison of brave old rugged Boys, Fel∣lows,
that, like Count <HI>Tilly</HI>'s <HI>Germans,</HI> had Iron
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
Faces, and they had defended themselves with
extraordinary Bravery a great while, but were
reduced to an exceeding Streight for want of
Provisions.</P>
<P>Accordingly we received the Ammunition
and Provision, and away we went for <HI>Newark;</HI>
about <HI>Melton Mowbray,</HI> Collonel <HI>Roseter</HI> set upon
us, with above 3000 Men; we were about the
same Number, having 2500 Horse, and 800
Dragoons. We had some Foot, but they were
still at <HI>Harborough,</HI> and were ordered to come
after us.</P>
<P><HI>Roseter,</HI> like a brave Officer, as he was, charged
us with great Fury, and rather outdid us in
Number, while we defended our selves with all
the Eagerness we could, and withal gave him
to understand we were not so soon to be beaten
as he expected. While the Fight continued doubt∣ful,
especially on our Side, our People, who had
charge of the Carriages and Provisions, began
to enclose our Flanks with them, as if we had
been marching; which, though it was done
without Orders, had two very good Effects, and
which did us extraordinary Service. First, it
secured us from being charged in the Flank,
which <HI>Roseter</HI> had twice attempted; and, Se∣condly,
it secured our Carriages from being
plundered, which had spoiled our whole Ex∣pedition.
Being thus enclosed, we fought with
great Security; and though <HI>Roseter</HI> made three
desperate Charges upon us, he could never
break us. Our Men received him with so much
Courage, and kept their Order so well, that
the Enemy finding it impossible to force us,
gave it over, and left us to pursue our Orders.
We did not offer to chase them, but contented
enough to have repulsed and beaten them off
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
and our Business being to relieve <HI>Newark,</HI>
we proceeded.</P>
<P>If we are to reckon by the Enemy's usual
Method, we got the Victory, because we kept
the Field, and had the Pillage of their Dead;
but otherwise, neither Side had any great Cause
to boast. We lost about 150 Men, and near as
many hurt; they left 170 on the Spot, and
carried off some. How many they had wounded
we could not tell; we got 70 or 80 Horse,
which helped to remount some of our Men
that had lost theirs in the Fight. We had,
however, this Disadvantage, that we were to
march on immediately after this Service; the
Enemy only to retire to their Quarters, which
was but hard by. This was an Injury to our
wounded Men, who we were after obliged to
leave at <HI>Belvoir</HI> Castle, and from thence we ad∣vanced
to <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>Our Business at <HI>Newark</HI> was to relieve the
Place, and this we resolved to do, whatever it
cost, though, at the same Time, we resolved
not to fight, unless we were forced to it. The
Town was rather blocked up than besieged;
the Garrison was strong, but ill provided; we had
sent them word of our coming to them, and our
Orders to relieve them, and they proposed some
Measures for our doing it. The chief Strength
of the Enemy lay on the other Side of the River;
but they having also some Notice of our Design,
had sent over Forces to strengthen their Lea∣guer
on this Side. The Garrison had often sur∣prized
them by Sallies, and indeed had chiefly
subsisted for some time by what they brought
in on this Manner.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> who was our General
for the Expedition, was for a general Attempt
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
to raise the Siege; but I had perswaded him off
of that: First, Because if we should be beaten,
as might be probable, we then lost the Town.
Sir <HI>Marmaduke</HI> briskly replied, <HI>A Soldier ought
never to suppose he shall be beaten. But, Sir, says I,
you'll get more Honour by relieving the Town, than by
beating them: One will be a Credit to your Conduct, as
the other will be to your Courage; and, if you think you
can beat them, you may do it afterward, and then if you
are mistaken, the Town is nevertheless secured, and
half your Victory gained.</HI></P>
<P>He was prevailed with to adhere to this Ad∣vice,
and accordingly we appeared before the
Town about two Hours before Night. The
Horse drew up before the Enemy's Works; the
Enemy drew up within their Works, and seeing
no Foot, expected when our Dragoons would
dismount and attack them. They were in the
right to let us attack them, because of the
Advantage of their Batteries and Works, if
that had been our Design; but, as we intended
only to amuse them, this Caution of theirs ef∣fected
our Design; for, while we thus faced
them with our Horse, two Regiments of Foot,
which came up to us but the Night before, and
was all the Infantry we had, with the Waggons
of Provisions, and 500 Dragoons, taking a Com∣pass
clean round the Town, posted themselves
on the lower Side of the Town by the River. Up∣on
a Signal the Garrison agreed on before, they
fallied out at this very Juncture, with all the
Men they could spare, and dividing themselves
in two Parties, while one Party moved to the
Left to meet our Relief, the other Party fell
on upon Part of that Body which faced us. We
kept in Motion, and upon this Signal advanced
to their Works, and our Dragoons fired upon
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
them; and the Horse wheeling and counter-marching
often, kept them continually expect∣ing
to be attacked. By this Means the Enemy
were kept employed, and our Foot with the
Waggons, appearing on that Quarter where
they were least expected, easily defeated the
advanced Guards, and forced that Post, where
entring the Leaguer, the other Part of the Gar∣rison,
who had sallied that way, came up to
them, received the Waggons, and the Dragoons
entered with them into the Town. That Party
which we faced on the other Side of the Works;
knew nothing of what was done till all was
over; the Garrison retreated in good Order,
and we drew off, having finished what we came
for without fighting.</P>
<P>Thus we plentifully stored the Town with all
things wanting, and with an Addition of 500
Dragoons to their Garrison; after which we
marched away without fighting a Stroke. Our
next Orders were to relieve <HI>Pontfract</HI> Castle,
another Garrison of the King's, which had been
besieged ever since a few Days after the Fight
at <HI>Marston-Moor,</HI> by the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> Sir
<HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> and other Generals in their
Turn.</P>
<P>By the Way, we were joined with 800 Horse
out of <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> and some Foot, so many as
made us, about 4500 Men in all.</P>
<P>Collonel <HI>Forbes,</HI> a <HI>Scotchman,</HI> commanded at the
Siege, in the Absence of the Lord <HI>Fairfax;</HI> the
Collonel had sent to my Lord for more Troops,
and his Lordship was gathering his Forces to
come up to him; but he was pleased to come
too late. We came up with the Enemy's Lea∣guer
about Break of Day, and having been
discovered by their Scouts, they, with more
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
Courage than Discretion, drew out to meet us.
We saw no Reason to avoid them, being stronger
in Horse than they; and though we had but a
few Foot, we had 1000 Dragoons, which helped us
out. We had placed our Horse and Foot through∣out
in one Line, with two Reserves of Horse, and
between every Division of Horse, a Division of
Foot, only that on the Extremes of our Wings,
there were two Parties of Horse on each Point
by themselves, and the Dragoons in the Center,
on Foot. Their Foot charged us home, and stood
with Push of Pike a great while; but their Horse
charging our Horse and Musqueteers, and be∣ing
closed on the Flanks with those two exten∣ded
Troops on our Wings, they were presently
disordered, and fled out of the Field. The Foot
thus deserted, were charged on every Side,
and broken. They retreated still fighting, and
in good Order, for a while; but the Garrison
sallying upon them at the same Time, and being
followed close by our Horse, they were scat∣tered,
entirely routed, and most of them killed.
The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> was come with his Horse as
far as <HI>Ferribridge,</HI> but the Fight was over; and
all he could do was to rally those that fled, and
save some of their Carriages, which else had
fallen into our Hands. We drew up our little
Army in Order of Battle the next Day, expect∣ing
the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> would have charged us;
but his Lordship was so far from any such
Thoughts, that he placed a Party of Dragoons,
with Orders to fortify the Pass at <HI>Ferribridge,</HI>
to prevent our falling upon him in his Retreat,
which he needed not have done; for, having rai∣sed
the Siege of <HI>Pontfract,</HI> our Business was done,
we had nothing to say to him, unless we had
been strong enough to stay.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="290"/>
We lost not above 30 Men in this Action,
and the Enemy 300, with about 150 Prisoners,
one Piece of Cannon, all their Ammunition,
1000 Arms, and most of their Baggage, and
Collonel <HI>Lambert</HI> was once taken Prisoner, be∣ing
wounded, but got off again.</P>
<P>We brought no Relief for the Garrison, but
the Opportunity to furnish themselves out of
the Country, which they did very plentifully.
The Ammunition taken from the Enemy was
given to them, which they wanted, and was
their Due, for they had siezed it in the Sally they
made, before the Enemy was quite defeated.</P>
<P>I cannot omit taking Notice, on all Occasions,
how exceeding serviceable this Method was of
posting Musqueteers in the Intervals, among the
Horse, in all this War: I perswaded our Generals to
it, as much as possible, and I never knew a Body of
Horse beaten that did so; yet I had great
Difficulty to prevail upon our People to believe
it, though it was taught me by the greatest
General in the World, (viz.) the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI>
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> did it at the Battle <HI>Marston-Moor;</HI>
and had the Earl of <HI>Newcastle</HI> not been obstinate
against it in his Right Wing, as I observed be∣fore,
the Day had not been lost. In discoursing
this with Sir <HI>Marmakuke Langdale,</HI> I had related
several Examples of the Serviceableness of these
small Bodies of Firemen, and, with great Diffi∣culty,
brought him to agree, telling him, I
would be answerable for the Success; but, after
the Fight, he told me plainly he saw the Ad∣vantage
of it, and would never fight otherwise
again, if he had any Foot to place. So having
relieved these two Places, we hastened, by long
Marches, through <HI>Derbyshire,</HI> to join Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>
on the Edge of <HI>Shropshire</HI> and <HI>Cheshire.</HI> We found
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
Collonel <HI>Roseter</HI> had followed us at a Distance,
ever since the Business at <HI>Melton Mowbray,</HI> but
never cared to attack us, and we found he did
the like still. Our General would fain have
been doing with him again, but we found him
too shy. Once we laid a Trap for him at <HI>Dove-Bridge,</HI>
between <HI>Derby</HI> and <HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> the
Body being marched two Days before; 300
Dragoons were left to guard the Bridge, as if
we were afraid he should fall upon us. Upon
this we marched, as I said, on to <HI>Burton,</HI> and,
the next Day, fetching a Compass round, came
to a Village near <HI>Titbury</HI> Castle, whose Name I
forgot, were we lay still expecting our Dra∣goons
would be attacked.</P>
<P>Accordingly the Collonel, strengthned with
some Troops of Horse from <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> comes up
to the Bridge, and finding fome Dragoons po∣sted,
advances to charge them: The Dragoons
immediately get a Horseback, and run for it,
as they were ordered; but the old Lad was not
to be caught so; for he halts immediately at
the Bridge, and would not come over till he
had sent three or four flying Parties abroad, to
discover the Country. One of these Parties
fell into our Hands, and received but coarse
Entertainment. Finding the Plot would not take,
we appeared, and drew up in View of the Bridge
but he would not stir: So we continued our
March into <HI>Cheshire,</HI> where we joined Prince
<HI>Rupert,</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> making together a
fine Body, being above 8000 Horse and Dragoons.</P>
<P>This was the best and most successful Expe∣dition
I was in during this War. 'Twas well
concerted, and executed with as much Expedition
and Conduct as could be desired, and the
Success was answerable to it: And indeed, con∣sidering
<PB N="286" REF="292"/>
the Season of the Year (for we set out
from <HI>Oxford</HI> the latter end of <HI>February</HI>) the Ways
bad, and the Season wet, it was a terrible
March of above 200 Miles, in continual Action,
and continually dodged and observed by a vi∣gilant
Enemy, and at a Time when the North
was over-run by their Armies, and the <HI>Scots</HI>
wanting Employment for their Forces; yet in
less than 23 Days, we marched 200 Miles,
fought the Enemy in open Field four Times,
relieved one Garrison besieged, and raised the
Siege of another, and joined our Friends at last
in Safety.</P>
<P>The Enemy was in great Pain for Sir <HI>William
Brereton</HI> and his Forces, and Expresses rid
Night and Day to the <HI>Scots</HI> in the North, and
to the Parties in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> to come to his Help.
The Prince, who used to be rather too forward
to fight than otherwise, could not be perswaded
to make use of this Opportunity, but loitered,
if I may be allowed to say so, till the <HI>Scots,</HI> with
a Brigade of Horse and 2000 Foot, had joined
him; and then 'twas not thought proper to
engage them.</P>
<P>I took this Opportunity to go to <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>
to visit my Father, who was a Prisoner of War
there, getting a pass from the Enemy's Gover∣nour.
They allowed him the Liberty of the
Town, and sometimes to go to his own House,
upon his Parole, so that his Confinement was not
very much to his personal Injury; but this, to∣gether
with the Charges he had been at in rai∣sing
the Regiment, and above 20000 l. in Money
and Plate, which at several Times he had lent,
or given rather, to the King, had reduced our
Family to very ill Circumstances; and now they
talked of cutting down his Woods.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="293"/>
I had a great deal of Discourse with my Fa∣ther
on this Affair; and finding him extremely
concerned, I offered to go to the King, and desire
his Leave to go to <HI>London,</HI> and treat about
his Composition, or to render my self a Priso∣ners
in his stead, while he went up himself∣In
this Difficulty I treated with the Governour
of the Town, who very civilly offered me his
Pass to go for <HI>London,</HI> which I accepted; and
waiting on Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was then at <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI>
I acquainted him with my Design. The
Prince was unwilling I should go to <HI>London;</HI>
but told me, he had some Prisoners of the Par∣liament's
Friends in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> and he would
get an Exchange for my Father. I told him,
if he would give me his Word for it, I knew I
might depend upon it, otherwise there was so
many of the King's Party in their Hands, that
his Majesty was tired with Sollicitations for Ex∣changes;
for we never had a Prisoner but there
was ten Offers of Exchanges for him. The
Prince told me, I should depend upon him; and
he was as good as his Word quickly after.</P>
<P>While the Prince lay at <HI>Worcester</HI> he made an
Incursion into <HI>Herefordshire,</HI> and having made
some of the Gentlemen Prisoners, brought them
to <HI>Worcester;</HI> and though it was an Action
which had not been usual, they being Persons
not in Arms, yet the like being my Father's
Case, who was really not in Commission, nor
in any Military Service, having resigned his
Regiment three Years before to me, the Prince
insisted on exchanging them for such as the
Parliament had in Custody in like Circumstan∣ces.
The Gentlemen seeing no Remedy, sol∣licited
their own Case at the Parliament, and
got it passed in their behalf; and by this Means
<PB N="288" REF="294"/>
my Father got his Liberty; and, by the As∣sistance
of the Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> got Leave to
come to <HI>London</HI> to make a Composition, as a
Delinquent, for his Estate. This they charged at
7000l. but by the Assistance of the same noble
Person, he got off for 4000l. Some Members of
the Committee moved very kindly, that my
Father should oblige me to quit the King's Ser∣vice;
but that, as a thing which might be out
of his Power, was not insisted on.</P>
<P>The Modelling the Parliament Army took
them up all this Winter, and we were in great
Hopes the Divisions which appeared amongst
them might have weakened their Party; but
when they voted Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> to be Ge∣neral,
I confess I was convinced the King's
Affairs were lost and desperate. Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> a∣bating
the Zeal of his Party, and the mistaken
Opinion of his Cause, was the fittest Man
amongst them to undertake the Charge: He
was a compleat General, strict in his Discipline,
wary in Conduct, fearless in Action, unwearied in
the Fatigue of the War, and withal, of a modest,
noble, generous Disposition. We all aprehend∣ed
Danger from him, and heartily wished him of
our own Side; and the King was so sensible,
though he would not discover it, that when
an Account was brought him of the Choice
they had made, he replied, <HI>he was sorry for it; he
had rather it had been any Body than he.</HI></P>
<P>The first Attempts of this new General and
new Army were at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which, by the
Neighbourhood of a numerous Garrison in <HI>A∣bingdon,</HI>
began to be very much streightned for
Provisions; and the new Forces under <HI>Cromwell</HI>
and <HI>Skippon,</HI> one Lieutenant General, the other
Major General to <HI>Fairfax,</HI> approaching with a
<PB N="289" REF="295"/>
Design to block it up, the King left the Place,
supposing his Absence would draw them away,
as it soon did.</P>
<P>The King resolving to leave <HI>Oxford,</HI> marches
from thence with all his Forces, the Garrison
excepted, with Design to have gone to <HI>Bristol,</HI>
but the Plague was in <HI>Bristol,</HI> which altered the
Measures, and changed the Course of the
King's Designs, so he marched for <HI>Worcester</HI> about
the begining of <HI>June</HI> 1645. The Foot with a
Train of 40 Pieces of Cannon, marching into
<HI>Worcester,</HI> the Horse stayed behind some time
in <HI>Gloucestershire.</HI></P>
<P>The first Action our Army did, was to raise
the Siege of <HI>Chester;</HI> Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> had be∣sieged
it, or rather blocked it up, and when his
Majesty came to <HI>Worcester,</HI> he sent Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI>
with 4000 Horse and Dragoons, with Orders
to join some Foot out of <HI>Wales,</HI> to raise the Siege;
but Sir <HI>William</HI> thought fit to withdraw, and
not stay for them, and the Town was freed
without fighting. The Governour took Care in
this Interval to furnish himself with all things
necessary for another Siege; and, as for Am∣munition
and other Necessaries, he was in
no Want.</P>
<P>I was sent with a Party into <HI>Staffordshire,</HI>
with Design to intercept a Convoy of Stores
coming from <HI>London,</HI> for the Use of Sir <HI>Willia
Brereton;</HI> but they having some Notice of the
Design, stopt, and went out of the Road to
<HI>Burton upon Trent,</HI> and so I missed them; but that
we might not come back quite empty, we
attacked <HI>Hawkesly</HI> House, and took it, where
we got good Booty, and brought 80 Prisoners
back to <HI>Worcester.</HI> From <HI>Worcester</HI> the King ad∣vanced
into <HI>Shropshire,</HI> and took his Head Quar∣ters
<PB N="290" REF="296"/>
at <HI>Bridgenorth.</HI> This was a very happy
March of the King's, and had his Majesty pro∣ceeded,
he had certainly cleared the North
once more of his Enemies, for the Country was
generally for him. At his advancing so far as
<HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> Sir <HI>William Brereton</HI> fled up into
<HI>Lancashire;</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Brigades who were with
him retreated into the North, while yet the
King was above 40 Miles from them, and all
things lay open for Conquest. The new Ge∣nerals,
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> lay about <HI>Oxford</HI>
preparing as if they would besiege it, and gave
the King's Army so much Leisure, that his
Majesty might have been at <HI>Newcastle</HI> before
they could have been half Way to him. But
Heaven, when the Ruine of a Person or Party is
determined, always so infatuates their Counsels,
as to make them instrumental to it themselves.</P>
<P>The King let slip this great Opportunity, as
some thought, intending to break into the
Associated Counties, of <HI>Northampton, Cambridge,
Norfolk,</HI> where he had some Interests forming.
What the Design was, we knew not, but the
King turns Eastward, and Marches into <HI>Leicester∣shire,</HI>
and having treated the Country but very
indifferently, as having deserved no better of us,
laid Siege to <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P>This was but a short Siege; for the King, re∣solving
not to lose Time, fell on with his great
Guns, and having beaten down their Works,
our Foot entered, after a vigorous Resistance,
and took the Town by Storm. There was some
Blood shed here, the Town being carried
by Assault; but it was their own Faults; for after
the Town was taken, the Soldiers and Towns∣men
obstinately fought us in the Market-Place;
insomuch that the Horse was called to enter
<PB N="291" REF="297"/>
the Town to clear the Streets. But this was
not all; I was commanded to advance with these
Horse, being three Regiments, and to enter the
Town; the Foot, who were engaged in the
Streets, crying out, <HI>Horse, Horse.</HI> Immediately
I advanced to the Gate, for we were drawn up
about Musquet Shot from the Works, to have
supported our Foot, in Case of a Sally. Having
siezed the Gate, I placed a Guard of Horse
there, with Orders to let no Body pass in or
out, and dividing my Troops, rode up by two
Ways towards the Market-Place; the Garrison
defending themselves in the Market-Place, and
in the Church-yard with great Obstinancy,
killed us a great many Men; but, as soon as our
Horse appeared, they demanded Quarter, which
our Foot refused them in the first Heat, as is
frequent in all Nations, in like Cases; 'till at
last, they threw down their Arms, and yielded
at Discretion; and then I can testisy to the
World, that fair Quarter was given them.
I am the more particular in this Relation, ha∣ving
been an Eye-witness of the Action, because
the King was reproached in all the publick Li∣bels,
with which those Times abounded, for
having put a great many to Death, and hanged
the Committee of the Parliament, and some
<HI>Scots,</HI> in cold Blood, which was a notorious For∣gery;
and as I am sure there was no such thing done,
so I must acknowledge I never saw any Inclination
in his Majesty to Cruelty, or to act any thing
which was not practised by the General Laws of
War, and by Men of Honour in all Nations.</P>
<P>But the Matter of Fact, in Respect to the Gar∣rison,
was as I have related; and, if they had
thrown down their Arms sooner, they had had
Mercy sooner; but it was not for a conquering
<PB N="292" REF="298"/>
Army, entered a Town by Storm, to offer Con∣ditions
of Quarter in the Streets.</P>
<P>Another Circumstance was, that a great ma∣ny
of the Inhabitants, both Men and Women,
were killed, which is most true; and the Case
was thus: The Inhabitants, to shew their over∣forward
Zeal to defend the Town, fought in
the Breach; nay, the very Women, to the Ho∣nour
of the <HI>Leicester</HI> Ladies, if they like it, of∣ficiously
did their Parts; and after the Town was
taken, and when, if they had had any Brains in
their Zeal, they would have kept their Houses,
and been quiet, they fired upon our Men out
of their Windows, and from the Tops of their
Houses, and threw Tiles upon their Heads; and
I had several of my Men wounded so, and 7
or 8 killed. This exasperated us to the last
Degree; and, finding one House better manned
than ordinary, and many shot fired at us out
of the Windows, I caused my Men to attack it,
resolved to make them an Example for the rest;
which they did, and breaking open the Doors,
they killed all they found there, without Di∣stinction;
and I appeal to the World if they were
to blame. If the Parliament Committee, or the
<HI>Scots</HI> Deputies were here, they ought to have
been quiet, since the Town was taken; but they
began with us, and, I think, brought it upon
themselves. This is the whole Case, so far as
came within my Knowledge, for which his Ma∣jesty
was so much abused.</P>
<P>We took here Collonel <HI>Gray</HI> and Captain
<HI>Hacker,</HI> and about 300 Prisoners, and about 300
more were killed. This was the last Day of
<HI>May</HI> 16415.</P>
<P>His Majesty having given over <HI>Oxford</HI> for lost,
continued here some Days, viewed the Town,
<PB N="293" REF="299"/>
ordered the Fortifications to be augmented, and
prepares to make it the Seat of War. But the
Parliament, rouzed at this Appearance of the
King's Army, order their General to raise the
Siege of <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the Garrison had, in a
Sally, ruined some of their Works, and killed
them 150 Men, taking several Prisoners, and
carrying them with them into the City; and
orders him to march towards <HI>Leicester,</HI> to observe
the King.</P>
<P>The King had now a small, but gallant Ar∣my,
all brave tried Soldiers, and seemed eager
to engage the new-modelled Army; and his Ma∣jesty,
hearing that Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> having rai∣sed
the Siege of <HI>Oxford,</HI> advanced towards him,
fairly saves him the Trouble of a long March,
and meets him half Way.</P>
<P>The Army lay at <HI>Daventry,</HI> and <HI>Fairfax</HI> at
<HI>Towcester,</HI> about 8 Miles off. Here the King sends
away 600 Horse, with 3000 Head of Cattle, to
relieve his People in <HI>Oxford;</HI> the Cattle he
might have spared better than the Men. The
King having thus victualled <HI>Oxford,</HI> changes his
Resolution of fighting <HI>Fairfax,</HI> to whom <HI>Crom∣well</HI>
was now joined with 4000 Men, or was with∣in
a Day's March, and marches Northward.
This was unhappy Counsel, because late given:
Had we marched Northward at first, we had
done it; but thus it was. Now we marched
with a triumphing Enemy at our Heels, and at
<HI>Naseby</HI> their advanced Parties attacked our Rear.
The King, upon this, alters his Resolution again,
and resolves to fight, and at Midnight calls us up at
<HI>Harborough</HI> to come to a Council of War. Fate
and the King's Opinion determined the Council
of War; and 'twas resolved to fight. Accor∣dingly
the Van, in which was Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Bri∣gade
<PB N="294" REF="300"/>
of Horse, of which my Regiment was a
Part, countermarched early in the Morning.</P>
<P>By five a Clock in the Morning, the whole
Army, in Order of Battle, began to descry the
Enemy from the rising Grounds, about a Mile
from <HI>Naseby,</HI> and moved towards them. They
were drawn up on a little Ascent in a large
Common Fallow Field, in one Line extended
from one Side of the Field to the other, the
Field something more than a Mile over, our
Army in the same Order, in one Line, with the
Reserves.</P>
<P>The King led the main Battle of Foot, Prince
<HI>Rupert</HI> the Right Wing of the Horse, and Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> the Left. Of the Enemy
<HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Skippon</HI> led the Body, <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mwell</HI> and
<HI>Roseter</HI> the Right, and <HI>Ireton</HI> the Left. The
Numbers of both Armies so equal, as not to
differ 500 Men, save that the King had most
Hore by about 1000, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> most Foot
by about 500. The Number was in each Army
about 18000 Men.</P>
<P>The Armies coming close up, the Wings
engaged first. The Prince with his Right Wing
charged with his wanted Fury, and drove all
the Parliament's Wing of Horse, one Division
excepted, clear out of the Field. <HI>Ireton,</HI> who
commanded this Wing, give him his due, ral∣lied
often, and fought like a Lion; but our
Wing bore down all before them, and pursued
them with a terrible Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Ireton</HI> seeing one Division of his Horse left,
repaired to them, and keeping his Ground,
fell foul of a Brigade of our Foot, who coming
up to the Head of the Line, he like mad Man
charges them with his Horse: But they with
their Pikes tore him to Pieces; so that this
<PB N="295" REF="301"/>
Division was entirely ruined. <HI>Ireton</HI> himself
thrust through the Thigh with a Pike, wound∣ed
in the Face with a Halberd, was unhorsed
and taken Prisoner.</P>
<P><HI>Cromwell,</HI> who commanded the Parliament's
Right Wing, charged Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI>
with extraordinary Fury; but he an old tried
Soldier, stood firm, and received the Charge
with equal Gallantry, exchanging all their Shot,
Carabines and Pistols, and then fell on Sword in
Hand. Roseter and Whaley had the better on
the Point of the Wing, and routed two Divisi∣ons
of Horse, pushing them behind the Reserves,
where they rallied, and charged again, but
were at last defeated; the rest of the Horse
now charged in the Flank retreated fighting,
and were pushed behind the Reserves of Foot.</P>
<P>While this was doing, the Foot engaged
with equal Feirceness, and for two Hours there
was a terrible Fire. The King's Foot backed
with gallant Officers, and full of Rage at the
Rout of their Horse, bore down the Enemy's
Brigade led by <HI>Skippon.</HI> The old Man woun∣ded,
bleeding retreats to their Reserves. All the
Foot, except the General's Brigade, were thus
driven into the Reserves, where their Officers
rallied them, and bring them on to a fresh
Charge; and here the Horse having driven our
Horse about a Quarter of a Mile from the Foot,
face about, and fall in on the Rear of the
Foot.</P>
<P>Had our Right Wing done thus, the Day had
been secured; but Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> according to
his Custom, following the flying Enemy, never
concerned himself with the Safety of those
behind; and yet he returned sooner than he
had done in like Cases too. At our Return we
<PB N="295" REF="302"/>
found all in Confusion, our Foot broken, all
but one Brigade, which though charged in
Front, Flank and Rear, could not be broken,
till Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> himself came up to the
Charge with fresh Men, and then they were
rather cut in Pieces then beaten; for they
stood with their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ikes charged every Way to
the last Extremity.</P>
<P>In this Condition, at the Distance of a Quar∣ter
of a Mile, we saw the King rallying his
Horse, and preparing to renew the Fight; and
our Wing of Horse coming up to him, gave
him Opportunity to draw up a large Body of
Horse, so large, that all the Enemy's Horse
facing us, stood still and looked on, but did
not think fit to charge us, till their Foot, who
had entirely broken our main Battle, were put
into Order again, and brought up to us.</P>
<P>The Officers about the King advised his
Majesty rather to draw off; for, since our Foot
were lost, it would be too much Odds to expose
the Horse to the Fury of their whole Army,
and would but be sacrificing his best Troops,
without and Hopes of Success.</P>
<P>The King, though with great Regret, at the
Loss of his Foot, yet seeing there was no other
Hope, took this advice, and retreated in good
Order to <HI>Harborough,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Lei∣cester.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Occasion of the Enemy having
so great a Number of Prisoners; for the Horse
being thus gone off, the Foot had no Means to
make their Retreat, and were obliged to yield
themselves. Commissary General <HI>Ireton</HI> being
taken by a Captain of Foot, makes the Captain
his Prisoner, to save his Life, and gives him his
Liberty for his Courtesy before.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="303"/>
<HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Roseter,</HI> with all the Enemy's
Horse, followed us as far as <HI>Leicester,</HI> and killed
all that they could lay hold on straggling from
the Body, but durst not attempt to charge
us in a Body. The King expecting the Enemy
would come to <HI>Leicester,</HI> removes to <HI>Ashby de la
Zouch,</HI> where we had some Time to recollect
our selves.</P>
<P>This was the most fatal Action of the whole
War; not so much for the Loss of our Cannon,
Ammunition, and Baggage, of which the Enemy
boasted so much, but as it was impossible for
the King ever to retrieve it: The Foot, the
best that ever he was Master of, could never be
supplied; his Army in the West was exposed
to certain Ruin, the North over-run with the
<HI>Scots; in short,</HI> the Case grew desperate, and the
King was once upon the Point of bidding us all
disband, and shift for our selves.</P>
<P>We lost in this Fight not above 2000 slain,
and the Parliament near as many, but the
Prisoners were a great Number; the whole Body
of Foot being, as I have said, dispersed, there
were 4500 Prisoners, besides 400 Officers, 2000
Horses, 12 Pieces of Cannon, 40 Barrels of Pow∣der,
all the King's Baggage, Coaches, most of
his Servants, and his Secretary, with his Ca∣binet
of Letters, of which the Parliament made
great Improvement, and, basely enough caused
his private Letters between his Majesty and the
Queen, her Majesty's Letters to the King, and a
great deal of such Stuff to be printed.</P>
<P>After this fatal Blow, being retreated, as I
have said, to <HI>Ashby de la Zouch</HI> in <HI>Leicestershire,</HI>
the King ordered us to divide; his Majesty,
with a Body of Horse, about 3000, went to
<HI>Litchfield,</HI> and through <HI>Cheshire</HI> into North <HI>Wales</HI>
<PB N="298" REF="304"/>
and Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> with about 2500
went to <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>The King remained in <HI>Wales</HI> for several
Months; and though the Length of the War
had almost drained that Country of Men, yet
the King raised a great many Men there, re∣cruited
his Horse Regiments, and got together
six or seven Regiments of Foot, which seemed
to look like the Beginning of a New Army.</P>
<P>I had frequent Discourses with his Majesty
in this low Ebb of his Affairs, and he would
often wish he had not exposed his Army at
<HI>Naseby.</HI> I took the Freedom once to make a
Proposition to his Majesty, which if it had
taken Effect, I verily believe would have given
a new Turn to his Affairs; and that was, at
once to flight all his Garrisons in the Kingdom,
and give private Orders to all the Soldiers in
every Place, to join in Bodies, and meet at two
General Rendezvous, which I would have ap∣pointed
to be, one at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and one at <HI>West∣chester.</HI>
I demonstrated how easily all the Forces
might reach these two Places; and both being
strong and wealthy Places, and both Sea-Ports,
he would have a free Communication by Sea,
with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and with his Friends abroad; and
having <HI>Wales</HI> entirely his own, he might yet
have an Opportunity to make good Terms for
himself, or else have another fair Field with
the Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon a fair Calculation of his Troops in
several Garrisons and small Bodies dispersed
about, I convinced the King, by his own Ac∣counts,
that he might have two compleat Ar∣mies,
each of 25000 Foot, 8000 Horse, and 2000
Dragoons; that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> and the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> might Ship all their Forces, and come
<PB N="299" REF="305"/>
by Sea in two Tides, and be with him in a
shorter Time than the Enemy could follow.</P>
<P>With two such Bodies he might face the
Enemy, and make a Day of it; but now his Men
were only sacrificed, and eaten up by Piece-meal
in a Party-War, and spent their Lives and
Estates to do him no Service: That if the Par∣liament
garrisoned the Towns and Castles he
should quit, they would lessen their Army,
and not dare to see him in the Field; and if
they did not, but left them open, then 'twould
be no Loss to him, but he might pssess them
as often as he pleased.</P>
<P>This Advice I pressed with such Arguments,
that the King was once going to dispatch Orders
for the doing it; but to be irresolute in Counsel,
is always the Companion of a declining Fortune;
the King was doubtful, and could not resolve
till it was too late.</P>
<P>And yet, though the King's Forces were
very low, his Majesty was resolved to make
one Adventure more, and it was a strange one;
for, with but a Handful of Men he made a de∣sperate
March, almost 250 Miles in the Middle
of the whole Kingdom, compassed about with
Armies and Parties innumerable, traversed the
Heart of his Enemy's Country, entered their
associated Counties, where no Army had ever
yet come, and in spight of all their victorious
Troops facing and following him, alarmed even
<HI>London</HI> it self, and returned safe to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>His Majesty continued in <HI>Wales</HI> from the
Battle at <HI>Naseby</HI> till the 5th or 6th <HI>August,</HI> and
till he had an Account from all parts of the
Progress of his Enemies, and the Posture of his
own Affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="306"/>
Here he found, that the Enemy being hard
pressed in <HI>Somersetshire</HI> by the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> and
Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Forces, who had take <HI>Bridgewater,</HI>
and distressed <HI>Taunton,</HI> which was now at the
Point of Surrender, they had ordered <HI>Fairfax</HI>
and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and the whole Army to march
Westward, to relieve the Town; which they
did, and <HI>Goring</HI>'s Troops were worsted, and him∣self
wounded at the Fight at <HI>Langport.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> who were always the dead Weight
upon the King's Affairs, having no more Work
to do in the North, were, at the Parliament's
Desire, advanced Southward, and then ordered
away towards South <HI>Wales,</HI> and were set down
to the Siege of <HI>Hereford.</HI> Here this famous <HI>Scotch</HI>
Army spent several Months in a fruitless Siege,
ill provided of Ammunition, and worse with
Money; and having sat near three Months be∣fore
the Town, and done little but eaten up the
Country round them; upon the repeated Ac∣counts
of the Progress of the Marquess of <HI>Mon∣trose</HI>
in that Kingdom, and pressing Instances
of their Countrymen, they resolved to raise their
Siege, and go home to relieve their Friends.</P>
<P>The King, who was willing to be rid of the
<HI>Scots,</HI> upon good Terms; and therefore to hasten
them, and least they should pretend to push
on the Siege to take the Town first, gives it
out, that he was resolved with all his Forces
to go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and join <HI>Montrose;</HI> and so
having secured <HI>Scotland,</HI> to renew the War from
thence.</P>
<P>And accordingly his Majesty marches North∣wards,
with a Body of 4000 Horse; and, had
the King really done this, and with that Body
of Horse marched away, (for he had the Start
of all his Enemies, by above a Fortnight's March)
<PB N="301" REF="307"/>
he had then had the fairest Opportunity for
a general Turn of all his Affairs, that he ever
had in all the latter Part of this War: For
<HI>Montrose,</HI> a gallant daring Soldier, who from
the least Shadow of Force in the farthest Cor∣ner
of his Country, had, rowling like a Snow
Ball, spread all over <HI>Scotland,</HI> was come into the
South Parts, and had summoned <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
frighted away their, Statesmen, beaten their
Soldiers at <HI>Dundee</HI> and other Places, and Letters
and Messengers in the Heels of one another,
repeated their Cries to their Brethren in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
to lay before them the sad Condition of
the Country, and to hasten the Army to their
Relief. The <HI>Scots</HI> Lords of the Enemy's Party
fled to <HI>Berwick,</HI> and the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI>
goes himself to General <HI>Lesly,</HI> to press him
for help.</P>
<P>In this Extremity of Affairs <HI>Scotland</HI> lay, when
we marched out of <HI>Wales.</HI> The <HI>Scots</HI> at the Siege
of <HI>Hereford</HI> hearing the King was gone North∣ward
with his Horse, conclude he was gone
directly for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and immediately send
<HI>Lesly</HI> with 4000 Horse and Foot to follow, but
did not yet raise the Siege.</P>
<P>But the King still irresolute, turns away to the
Eastward, and comes to <HI>Litchfield,</HI> where he
shewed his Resentments at Collonel <HI>Hastings,</HI> for
his easy Surrender of <HI>Leicester.</HI></P>
<P>In this March the Enemy took Heart; we
had Troops of Horse on every Side upon us,
like Hounds started at a fresh Stag. <HI>Lesly,</HI> with
the <HI>Scots,</HI> and a strong Body followed in our
Rear, Major General <HI>Points,</HI> Sir <HI>John Gell,</HI> Collonel
<HI>Roseter,</HI> and others, in our Way; they pretended
to be 10000 Horse, and yet never durst face us.
The <HI>Scots</HI> made one Attempt upon a Troop which
<PB N="302" REF="308"/>
stayed a little behind, and took some Prisoners;
but when a Regiment of our Horse faced
them, they retired. At a Village near <HI>Litchfield,</HI>
another Party of about 1000 Horse attacked my
Regiment; we were on the left of the Army,
and, at a little too far a Distance. I happened to
be with the King at that time, and my Lieu∣tenant
Collonel with me; so that the Major had
Charge of the Regiment; he made a very hand∣some
Defence, but sent Messengers for speedy
Relief; we were on a March, and therefore all
ready, and the King orders me a Regiment of
Dragoons and 300 Horse, and the Body halted
to bring us off, not knowing how strong the
Enemy might be. When I came to the Place
I found my Major hard layed to, but fighting
like a Lion; the Enemy had broke in upon him
in two Places, and had routed one Troop,
cutting them off from the Body, and had made
them all Prisoners. Upon this I fell in with the
300 Horse, and cleared my Major from a Party
who charged him in the Flank; the Dragoons
immediately lighting, one Party of them comes up
on my Wing, and saluting the Enemy with
their Musquets, put them to a stand; the other
Party of Dragoons wheeling to the Left, en∣deavoured
to get behind them. The Enemy
perceiving they should be over-powered, retrea∣ted
in as good Order as they could, but left
us most of our Prisoners, and about 30 of their
own. We lost about 15 of our Men, and the
Enemy about 40, chiefly by the Fire of our Dra∣goons
in their Retreat.</P>
<P>In this Posture we continued our March; and
though the King halted at <HI>Litchfield,</HI> which was
a dangerous Article, having so many of the E∣nemy's
Troops upon his Hands, and this Time
<PB N="303" REF="309"/>
gave them Opportunity to get into a Body;
yet the <HI>Scots,</HI> with their General <HI>Lesly,</HI> resolving
for the North, the rest of the Troops were not
able to face us, till having ravaged the Enemy's
Country through <HI>Staffordshire, Warwick, Leicester,</HI>
and <HI>Nottinghamshire,</HI> we came to the Leaguer be∣fore
<HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>The King was once more on the Mind to have
gone into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and called a Council of War
to that Purpose; but then it was resolved by
all Hands, that it would be too late to attempt
it; for the <HI>Scots</HI> and Major General <HI>Pointz</HI> were
before us, and several strong Bodies of Horse in
our Rear; and there was no venturing now, un∣less
any Advantage presented to rout one of
those Parties which attended us.</P>
<P>Upon these and like Considerations we resol∣ved
for <HI>Newark;</HI> on our Approach the Forces
which blocked up that Town drew off, being
too weak to oppose us; for the King was now
above 5000 Horse and Dragoons, besides 300
Horse and Dragoons he took with him from
<HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>We halted at <HI>Newark</HI> to assist the Garrison, or
give them Time rather to furnish themselves
from the Country with what they wanted, which
they were very diligent in doing; for in two
Days time they filled a large Island which lies
under the Town, between the two Branches of
the <HI>Trent,</HI> with Sheep, Oxen, Cows and Horses,
an incredible Number; and our Affairs being
now something desperate, we were not very nice
in our Usage of the Country; for really if it
was not with a Resolution, both to punish the
Enemy and enrich our selves, no Man can give
any rational Account why this desperate Jour∣ney
was undertaken.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="310"/>
'Tis certain the <HI>Newarkers,</HI> in the Respite they
gained by our coming, got above 50000l. from
the Country round them, in Corn, Cattle, Mo∣ney,
and other Plunder.</P>
<P>From hence we broke into <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and
the King lay at <HI>Belvoir</HI> Castle, and from <HI>Belvoir</HI>
Castle to <HI>Stamford.</HI> The Swiftness of our March
was a terrible Surprize to the Enemy; for our
Van being at a Village on the great Road called
<HI>Stilton,</HI> the Country People fled into the Isle of
<HI>Ely,</HI> and every Way, as if all was lost. Indeed
our Dragoons treated the Country very coarsly;
and all our Men in general made themselves rich.
Between <HI>Stilton</HI> and <HI>Huntingdon</HI> we had a small
Bustle with some of the Association Troops of
Horse, but they were soon routed, and fled to
<HI>Huntingdon,</HI> where they gave such an Account
of us to their Fellows, that they did not think
fit to stay for us, but left their Foot to defend
themselves as well as they could.</P>
<P>While this was doing in the Van, a Party
from <HI>Burleigh</HI> House, near <HI>Stamford,</HI> the Seat of
the Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> pursued four Troops of our
Horse, who straggling towards <HI>Peterborough,</HI> and
committing some Disorders there, were surpri∣zed
before they could get into a Posture of
Fighting; and encumbered, as I suppose, with
their Plunder, they were entirely routed, lost
most of their Horses, and were forced to come
away on Foot; but finding themselves in this
Condition, they got into a Body in the Enclo∣sures,
and in that Posture turning Dragoons, they
lined the Hedges, and fired upon the Enemy
with their Carabines. This way of Fighting,
though not very pleasant to Troopers, put the
Enemy's Horse to some Stand, and encouraged
our Men to venture into a Village, where the
<PB N="305" REF="311"/>
Enemy had secured 40 of their Horse; and
boldly charging the Guard, they beat them off
and recovered those Horses; the rest made their
Retreat good to <HI>Wandsford</HI> Bridge; but we lost
near 100 Horses, and about 12 of our Men taken
Prisoners.</P>
<P>The next Day the King took <HI>Huntington;</HI> the
Foot which were left in the Town, as I observed
by their Horse, had posted themselves at the
Foot of the Bridge, and fortified the Pass, with
such Things as the Haste and Shortness of the
Time would allow; and in this Posture they
seemed resolute to defend themselves. I con∣fess,
had they in Time planted a good Force
here, they might have put a full Stop to our
little Army; for the River is large and deep,
the Country on the left marshy, full of Drains
and Ditches, and unfit for Horse, and we must
have either turned back, or took the Right
Hand into <HI>Bedfordshire;</HI> but here not being above
400 Foot, and they forsaken of their Horse,
the Resustance they made was to no other Pur∣pose
than to give us Occasion to knock them in
the Head, and plunder the Town.</P>
<P>However they defended the Bridge, as I
have said, and opposed our Passage. I was this
Day in the Van, and our Forelorn having en∣tered
<HI>Huntington</HI> without any great Resistance
till they came to the Bridge, finding it barrica∣ded,
they sent me Word; I caused the Troops
to halt, and rid up to the Forelorn, to view
the Countenance of the Enemy, and found by
the Posture they had put themselves in, that
they resolved to sell us the Passage as de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>' as
they could.</P>
<P>I sent to the King for some Dragoons, and gave
him Account of what I observed of the Enemy, and
<PB N="306" REF="312"/>
that I judged them to be 1000 Men; for I could
not particularly see their Numbers. According∣ly
the King ordered 500 Dragoons to attack
the Bridge, commanded by a Major; the Ene∣my
had 200 Musqueteers placed on the Bridge,
their Barricade served them for a Breast-work
on the Front, and the low Walls on the Bridge
served to secure their Flanks: Two Bodies of
their Foot were placed on the opposite Banks of
the River, and a Reserve stood in the High-way
on the Rear. The Number of their Men could
not have been better ordered, and they wanted
not Courage answerable to the Conduct of the
Party. They were commanded by one <HI>Bennet,</HI>
a resolute Officer, who stood in the Front of his
Men on the Bridge with a Pike in his Hand.</P>
<P>Before we began to fall on, the King ordered
to view the River, to see if it was no where passa∣ble,
or any Boat to be had; but the River
being not fordable, and the Boats all secured
on the other Side, the Attack was resolved on,
and the Dragoons fell on with extraordinary
Bravery. The Foot defended themselves ob∣stinately,
and beat off our Dragoons twice; and
though <HI>Bonnet</HI> was killed upon the Spot, and
after him him his Lieutenant, yet their Officers
relieving them with fresh Men, they would cer∣tainly
have beat us all off, had not a venturous
Fellow, one of our Dragoons thrown himself
into the River, swum over, and, in the midst
of a Shower of Musquet Bullets, cut the Rope
which tied a great flat-bottom Boat, and brought
her over: With the Help of this Boat, I got
over 100 Troopers first, and then their Horses,
and then 200 more without their Horses; and
with this Party fell in with one of the small
Bodies of Foot that were posted on that Side,
<PB N="307" REF="313"/>
and having routed them, and after them the
Reserve which stood in the Road, I made up so
the other Party; they stood their Ground, and
having rallied the Run-aways of both the other
Parties, charged me with their Pikes, and
brought me to a Retreat; but by this time the
King had sent over 300 Men more, and they
coming up to me, the Foot retreated. Those
on the Bridge finding how 'twas and having no
Supplies sent them, as before, fainted, and fled;
and the Dragoons rushing forward, most of them
were killed; about 150 of the Enemy were
killed, of which all the Officers at the Bridge,
the rest run away.</P>
<P>The Town suffered for it; for our Men left
them little of any thing they could carry. Here
we halted, and raised Contributions, took Money
of the Country, and of the open Towns, to ex∣empt
them from Plunder. Twice we faced the
Town of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and several of our Officers
advised his Majesty to storm it; but having no
Foot, and but 1200 Dragoons, wiser Heads di∣verted
him from it; and, leaving <HI>Cambridge</HI> on
the left, we marched to <HI>Wooburn,</HI> in <HI>Bedfordshire,</HI>
and our Parties raised Money all over the Coun∣ty
quite into <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> within 5 Miles of
St. <HI>Alban</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Swiftness of our March, and Uncertainty
which Way we intended, prevented all possi∣ble
Preparation to oppose us, and we met with
no Party able to make Head against us. From
<HI>Wooburn</HI> the King went through <HI>Buckingham</HI> to
<HI>Oxford;</HI> some of our Men straggling in the Villa∣ges
for Plunder, were often picked up by the
Enemy; but in all this long March we did not
loose 200 Men, got an incredible Booty, and
<PB N="308" REF="314"/>
brought 6 Waggons loaden with Money, besides
2000 Horses, and 3000 Head of Cattle into
<HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Oxford</HI> his Majesty moves again into
<HI>Gloucestershire</HI> having left about 1500 of his Horse
at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to scour the Country, and raise Con∣tributions,
which they did as far as <HI>Reading.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> was returned from taking
<HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and was sat down before <HI>Bristol,</HI>
in which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> commanded with a strong
Garrison, 2500 Foot and 1000 Horse. We had
not Force enough to attempt any thing there;
but the <HI>Scots,</HI> who lay still before <HI>Hereford,</HI> were
afraid of us, having before parted with all their
Horse under Lieutenant General <HI>Lesly,</HI> and but
ill stored with Provisions; and, if we came on
their Backs, were in a fair way to be starved,
or made to buy their Provisions at the Price of
their Blood.</P>
<P>His Majesty was sensible of this, and had we
had but 10 Regiments of Foot, would certainly
have fought the <HI>Scots;</HI> but we had no Foot, or so
few as was not worth while to march them.
However, the King marched to <HI>Worcester,</HI> and
the <HI>Scots</HI> apprehending they should be blocked
up, immediately raised the Siege, pretending
it was to go help their Brethren in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
away they marched Northwards.</P>
<P>We picked up some of their Stragglers, but
they were so poor, had been so ill paid, and so
harrassed at the Siege, that they had neither
Money nor Clothes; and the poor Soldiers fed
upon Apples and Roots, and eat the very green
Corn as it grew in the Fields, which reduced
them to a very sorry Condition of Health, for
they died like People infected with the Plague.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="315"/>
'Twas now debated whether we should yet
march for <HI>Scotland,</HI> but two Things prevented.
1. The Plague was broke out there, and Mul∣titudes
died of it, which made the King back∣ward,
and the Men more backward. 2. The
Marquess of <HI>Montrose</HI> having routed a whole
Brigade of <HI>Lesly</HI>'s best Horse, and carried all
before him, wrote to his Majesty, that he did
not now want Assistance, but was in Hopes in a
few Days to send a Body of Foot into <HI>England,</HI>
to his Majesty's Assistance. This over Confi∣dence
of his was his Ruine; for, on the con∣trary,
had he earnestly pressed the King to have
marched, and fallen in with his Horse, the King
had done it, and been absolutely Master of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
in a Fortnight's time; but <HI>Montrose</HI> was too
confident, and defied them all, till at last they
got their Forces together, and <HI>Lesly,</HI> with his
Horse out of <HI>England,</HI> and worsted him in two
or three Encounters, and then never left him
till they drove him out of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>While his Majesty stayed at <HI>Worcester</HI> several
Messengers came to him from <HI>Cheshire</HI> for Relief,
being exceedingly streightened by the Forces of
the Parliament: In order to which, the King
marched, but <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> being in the Enemy's
Hands, he was obliged to go round by <HI>Ludlow,</HI>
where he was joined by some Foot out of <HI>Wales.</HI>
I took this Opportunity to ask his Majesty's
Leave to go by <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> to my Father's, and
taking only two Servants, I left the Army two
Days before they marched.</P>
<P>This was the most Unsoldier-like Action that
ever I was guilty of, to go out of the Army to pay
a Visit, when a Time of Action was just at Hand;
and, though I protest I had not the least Intima∣tion,
no not fri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m my own Thoughts, that the
<PB N="310" REF="316"/>
Army would engage, at least before they came
to <HI>Chester,</HI> before which I intended to meet them;
yet it looked so ill, so like an Excuse, or a Sham
of Cowardise, or Disaffection to the Cause, and
to my Master's Interest, or something I know
not what, that I could not bear to think of it,
nor never had the Heart to see the King's Face
after it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ludlow</HI> the King marched to relieve
<HI>Chester; Poyatz,</HI> who commanded the Parliament's
Forces, follows the King, with Design to join
with the Forces before <HI>Chester,</HI> under Collonel
<HI>Jones,</HI> before the King could come up. To that
End <HI>Poyntz,</HI> passes through <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> the Day
that the King marched from <HI>Ludlow;</HI> yet the
King's Forces got the Start of him, and forced
him to engage: Had the King engaged him
but three Hours sooner, and consequently far∣ther
off from <HI>Chester,</HI> he had ruined him; for
<HI>Poyntz</HI>'s Men not able to stand the Shock of
the King's Horse, gave Ground, and would in
half an Hour more been beaten out of the Field;
but Collonel <HI>Jones,</HI> with a strong Party from
the Camp, which was within two Miles, comes
up in the Heat of the Action, falls on in the
King's Rear, and turned the Scale of the Day:
The Body was, after an obstinate Fight defeated,
and a great many Gentlemen of Quality killed
and taken Prisoners; the Earl of <HI>Litchfield</HI> was
of the Number of the former, and 67 Officers
of the latter, with 1000 others.</P>
<P>The King with about 500 Horse got into
<HI>Chester,</HI> and from thence into <HI>Wales,</HI> whither all
that could get away made up to him as fast as
they could, but in a bad Condition.</P>
<P>This was the last Stroke they struck, the rest
of the War was nothing but taking all his Gar∣risons
<PB N="311" REF="317"/>
from him, one by one, till they finished
the War, with the captivating his Person, and
then, for want of other Business, fell to fighting
with one another.</P>
<P>I was quite disconsolate at the News of this
last Action, and the more because I was not
there; my Regiment was wholly dispersed, my
Lieutenant Collonel, a Gentleman of a good
Family, and a near Relation to my Mother, was
Prisoner, my Major and three Captains killed, and
most of the rest Prisoners.</P>
<P>The King, hopeless of any considerable Party
in <HI>Wales, Bristol</HI> being surrendered, sends for
Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> who came
to him. With them, and the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and a great Train of Gen∣tlemen,
his Majesty marches to <HI>Newark</HI> again,
leaves a Thousand Horse with Sir <HI>William Vaughan,</HI>
to attempt the Relief of <HI>Chester,</HI> in doing
whereof he was routed the second time by <HI>Jones</HI>
and his Men, and entirely dispersed.</P>
<P>The chief Strength the King had in these
Parts was at <HI>Newark,</HI> and the Parliament were
very earnest with the <HI>Scots</HI> to march Southward,
and to lay Siege to <HI>Newark;</HI> and while the Par∣liament
pressed them to it, and they sat still,
and delayed it, several Heats began, and some
ill blood between them, which after wards broke
out into open War. The <HI>English</HI> reproached the
<HI>Scots</HI> with pretending to help them, and really
hindering their Affairs. The <HI>Scots</HI> returned,
that they come to fight for them, and are left
to be starved, and can neither get Money nor
Clothes. At last they came to this, the
<HI>Scots</HI> will come to the Siege, if the Parlia∣ment
will send them Money, but not before:
However, as People sooner agree in doing ill,
<PB N="312" REF="318"/>
than in doing well, they came to Terms, and
the <HI>Scots</HI> came with their whole Army to
the Siege of <HI>Newark.</HI></P>
<P>The King, foreseeing the Siege, calls his
Fiends about him, tells them, he sees his Cir∣cumstances
are such, that they can help him
but little, nor he protect them, and advises
them to separate. The Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> with Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> with a strong Body of
Horse, attempt to get into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to join with
<HI>Montrose,</HI> who was still in the Highlands, though
reduced to a low Ebb; but these Gentlemen
are fallen upon on every Side and routed, and
at last being totally broken and dispersed, they
fly to the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI>'s Protection in the Isle
of Man.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> Collonel <HI>Ger∣rard,</HI>
and above 400 Gentlemen, all Officers
of Horse, lay their Commissions down, and siez∣ing,
upon <HI>Wooton</HI> House for a Retreat, make
Proposals to the Parliament to leave the King∣dom,
upon their Parole not to return again in
Arms against the Parliament, which was accep∣ted,
though afterwards the Princes declined
it. I sent my Man Post to the Prince to be
included in this Treaty, and for Leave for all
that would accept of like Conditions, but they
had given in the List of their Names, and could
not alter it.</P>
<P>This was a sad Time; the poor Remains of
the King's Fortunes went every where to wreck;
every Garrison of the Enemy was full of the
Cavalier Prisoners, and every Garrison the
King had was belet with Enemies, either
blocked up or besieged. <HI>Goring</HI> and the Lord
<HI>Hopton</HI> were the only Remainders of the King's
Forces, which kept in a Body, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> was
<PB N="313" REF="319"/>
pushing them with all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>maginable Vigour with
his whole Army, about <HI>Exeter,</HI> and other Parts
of <HI>Devonshire</HI> and <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>In this Condition the King left <HI>Newark</HI> in the
Night, and got to <HI>Oxford.</HI> The King had in
<HI>Oxford</HI> 8000 Men, and the Towns of <HI>Banbury,
Farrington, Durnnington</HI> Castle, and such Places
as might have been brought together in 24
Hours, 15 or 20000 Men, with which if he
had then resolved to have quitted the Place,
and collected the Forces in <HI>Worcester, Hereford,
Lichfield, Ashby de la Zouch,</HI> and all the small
Castles and Garrisons he had thereabouts, he
might have had near 40000 Men, might have
beaten the <HI>Scots</HI> from <HI>Newark,</HI> Collonel <HI>Jones</HI> from
<HI>Chester,</HI> and all, before <HI>Fairfax</HI> who was in the
West, could be able to come to their Relief, and
this his Majesty's Friends in North <HI>Wal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> had
concerted; and, in order to it, Sir <HI>Jacob Ashby</HI>
gathered what Forces he could, in our Parts,
and attempted to join the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and
to have proposed it to him; but Sir <HI>Jacob</HI> was
entirely routed at <HI>Stow on the Would,</HI> and taken
Prisoner, and of 3000 Men not above 600 came
to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>All the King's Garrisons dropt one by one;
<HI>Hereford</HI> which had stood out against the whole
Army of the <HI>Scots</HI> was surprized by six Men and
a Lieutenant dressed up for Country Labourers,
and a Constable pressed to work, who cut the
Guards in Pieces, and let in a Party of the
Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Chester</HI> was reduced by Famine, all the At∣tempts
the King made to relieve it being fru∣strated.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> routed the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> at
<HI>Forrigton,</HI> and drove him to such Extremities,
<PB N="314" REF="320"/>
that he was forced up into the farthest Corner
of <HI>Cornwall.</HI> The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had a gallant
Body of Horse with him of nine Brigades, but
no Foot; <HI>Fairfax,</HI> a great Army.</P>
<P>Heartless, and tired out with continual ill
News, and ill Success, I had frequent Meetings
with some Gentlemen, who had escaped from
the Rout of Sir <HI>William Vaughan,</HI> and we agreed
upon a Meeting at <HI>Worcester</HI> of all the Friends
we could get, to see if we could raise a Body fit
to do any Service; or, if not, to consider what
was to be done. At this Meeting we had almost
as many Opinions as People; our Strength ap∣peared
too weak to make any Attempt, the
Game was too far gone in our Parts to be retrie∣ved;
all we could make up did not amount to
above 800 Horse.</P>
<P>'Twas unanimously agreed not to go into the
Parliament as long as our Royal Master did not
give up the Cause; but in all Places, and by all
possible Methods, to do him all the Service we
could. Some proposed one thing, some another;
at last we proposed getting Vessels to carry us
to the Isle of <HI>Man</HI> to the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> as Sir
<HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and others had
done. I did not foresee any Service it would be
to the King's Affairs, but I started a Proposal,
that marching to <HI>Pembrook</HI> in a Body, we sould
there sieze upon all the Vessels we could, and
embarking our selves, Horses, and what Foot
we could get, cross the <HI>Severn</HI> Sea, and land in
<HI>Cornwall</HI> to the Assistance of Prince <HI>Charles,</HI> who
was in the Army of the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and where
only there seemed to be any Possibility of a
Chance for the remaining part of our Cause.</P>
<P>This Proposal was not without its Difficulties,
as how to get to the Sea-side, and, when there,
<PB N="315" REF="321"/>
what Assurance of Shipping. The Enemy, under
Major General <HI>Langhorn</HI> had over-run <HI>Wales,</HI>
and 'twould be next to impossible to effect it.</P>
<P>We could never carry our Proposal with the
whole Assembly; but however, about 200 of
us resolved to attempt it, and Meeting being
broke up without coming to any Conclusion, we
had a private Meeting among our selves to
effect it.</P>
<P>We dispatched private Messengers to <HI>Swanzey</HI>
and <HI>Pembrook,</HI> and other Places; but they all
discouraged us from the Attempt that way, and
advised us to go higher towards North <HI>Wales,</HI>
where the King's Interest had more Friends, and
the Parliament no Forces. Upon this we met,
and resolved, and having sent several Messengers
that Way, one of my Men provided us two
small Vessels in a little Creek near <HI>Harlegh</HI> Ca∣stle,
in <HI>Merionethshire.</HI> We marched away with
what Expedition we could, and embarked in
the two Vessels accordingly. It was the worst
Voyage sure that ever Man went; for first, we
had no Manner of Accomodation for so many
People, Hay for our Horses we got none, or
very little, but good Store of Oats, which
served us for our own Bread as well as Provender
for the Horses.</P>
<P>In this Condition we put off to Sea, and
had a fair Wind all the first Night, but early
in the Morning a sudden Storm drove us within
two or three Leagues of <HI>Ireland.</HI> In this Pickle
Sea-Sick our Horses rouling about upon one a∣nother,
and our selves stifled for want of Room,
no Cabins nor Beds, very cold Weather, and
very indifferent Diet, we wished our selves a∣shore
again a thousand times; and yet we were
not willing to go on Shore in <HI>Ireland,</HI> if we could
<PB N="316" REF="322"/>
help it; for the Rebels having Possession of every
Place, that was just having our Throats cut at
once. Having rouled about at the Mercy of the
Winds all Day, the Storm ceasing in the Even∣ing,
we had fair Weather again, but Wind
enough, which being large, in two Days and a
Night we came upon the Coast of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and,
to our no small Comfort, landed the next Day
at St. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves</HI> in the County of <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>We rested our selves here, and sent an Express
to the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who was then in <HI>Devonshire,</HI>
of our Arrival, and desired him to assign us Quar∣ters,
and send us his farther Orders. His Lord∣ship
expressed a very great Satisfaction at our
Arrival, and left it to our own Conduct to join
him as we saw convenient.</P>
<P>We were marching to join him, when News
came, that <HI>Fairfax</HI> had given him an entire De∣feat
at <HI>Torrington.</HI> This was but the old Story
over again; we had been used to ill News a
great while, and 'twas the less Surprize to us.</P>
<P>Upon this News we halted at <HI>Bodmin,</HI> till we
should hear farther; and it was not long be∣fore
we saw a Confirmation of the News before
our Eyes; for the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> with the Re∣mainder
of his Horse, which he had brought
off at <HI>Torrington</HI> in a very shattered Condition,
retreated to <HI>Lanceston,</HI> the first Town in <HI>Corn∣wall,</HI>
and hearing that <HI>Fairfax</HI> pursued him,
came on to <HI>Bodmin.</HI> Hither he summoned all
the Troops which he had left, which when he
had got together, were a fine Body indeed of 5000
Horse, but few Foot but what were at <HI>Pendennis,
Barnstable,</HI> and other Garrisons; these were com∣manded
by the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>
had taken shipping for <HI>France,</HI> to get Relief, a
few Days before.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="323"/>
Here a Grand Council of War was called, and
several things were proposed, but as it always
is in Distress, People are most irresolute, so
'twas here: Some were for breaking through by
Force, our Number being superiour to the
Enemy's Horse. To fight them with their Foot
would be Desperation, and ridiculous; and to
retreat, would but be to coop up themselves in
a narrow Place, where at last they must be
forced to fight upon Disadvantage, or yield at
Mercy. Others opposed this as a desperate Acti∣on,
and without Probability of Success; and all
were of different Opinions: I confess, when I
saw how things were, I saw 'twas a lost Game,
and I was for the Opinion of breaking through,
and doing it now, while the Country was open
and large, and not being forced to it when it
must be with more Disadvantage; but nothing
was resolved on, and so we retreated before the
Enemy. Some small Skirmishes there happen∣ed
near <HI>Bodmin,</HI> but none that were very con∣siderable.</P>
<P>'Twas the 1st of <HI>March</HI> when we quitted
<HI>Bodmin,</HI> and quartered at large at <HI>Columb, St.
Denis</HI> and <HI>Truro,</HI> and the Enemy took his Quar∣ters
at <HI>Bodmin,</HI> posting his Horse at the Passes
from <HI>Padstow</HI> on the North, to <HI>War-bridge Lesti∣thel</HI>
and <HI>Foy,</HI> spreading so from Sea to Sea, that
now breaking through was impossible. There
was no more Room for Counsel; for unless we had
Ships to carry us off, we had nothing to do but
when we were fallen upon, to defend our selves,
and sell Victory as dear as we could to the
Enemies.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> seeing the Distress we
were in, and loath to fall into the Enemy's Hands,
ships himself on board some Vessels at <HI>Falmouth,</HI>
<PB N="318" REF="324"/>
with about 400 Lords and Gentlemen; and, as I
had no Command here, to oblige my Attendance, I
was once going to make one; but my Come∣rades,
whom I had been the principal Occasion
of bringing hither, began to take it ill, that I
would leave them, and so I resolved we would
take our Fate together.</P>
<P>While thus we had nothing before us but a
Soldier's Death, a fair Field, and a strong Enemy,
and People began to look one upon another: The
Soldiers asked how their Officers looked, and the
Officers asked how their Soldiers looked, and
every Day we expected to be our last, when
unexpectedly the Enemy's General sent a Trum∣pet
to <HI>Truro</HI> to my Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> with a very
Handsom Gentleman-like Offer.</P>
<P>That since the General could not be igno∣rant
of his present Condition, and that the Place
he was in could not afford him Subsistance or
Defence; and especially considering that the
State of our Affairs were such, that if we should
escape from thence, we could not remove to
our Advantage, he had thought good to let us
know, <HI>That if we would deliver up our Horses and
Arms, he would, for avoiding the Effusion of Christian
Blood, or the putting any unsoldiery Extremities upon
us, allow such honourable and safe Conditions, as were
rather better than our present Circumstances could de∣mand,
and such as should discharge him to all the
World, as a Gentleman, as a Soldier and as a
Christian.</HI></P>
<P>After this followed the Conditions he would
give us, which were as follows, (<HI>viz.) That all
the Soldiery, as well</HI> English <HI>as Foreigners, should have
Liberty to go beyond the Seas, or to their own Dwel∣lings,
as they pleased; and to such as shall chuse to live
at home, Protection for their Liberty, and from all
<PB N="319" REF="325"/>
Violence, and plundering of Soldiers, and to give them
Bag and Baggage, and all their Goods, except Horses
and Arms.</HI></P>
<P>That for Officers in Commission, and Gentlemen of
Quality, he would allow them Horses for themselves
and one Servant, or more, suitable to their Quality,
and such Arms as are suitable to Gentlemen of such
Quality travelling in Times of Peace; and such Officers
as would go beyond Sea, should take with them their
full Arms and Number of Horses as are allowed in
the Army to such Officers.</P>
<P>That all the Troopers should receive on the Delivery
of their Horses, 20s. a Man, to carry them home;
and the General's Pass and Recommendation to any
Gentleman who desires to go to the Parliament to settle
the Composition for their Estates.</P>
<P>Lastly, A very honourable Mention of the General,
and Offer of their Mediation to the Parliament, to
treat him as a Man of Honour, and one who has
been tender of the Country, and behaved himself with
all the Moderation and Candor that could be expected
from an Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon the unexpected Receipt of this Message,
a Council of War was called, and the Letter
read; no Man offered to speak a Word; the Ge∣neral
moved it, but every one was loath to
begin.</P>
<P>At last, an old Collonel starts up, and asked
the General what he thought might occasion
the writing this Letter? The General told him,
<HI>he could not tell;</HI> but he could tell he was sure
of one thing, that he knew what was not the
Occasion of it (<HI>viz.</HI>) That is, not any want of
Force in their Army to oblige us to other Terms.
Then a Doubt was started, whether the King
and Parliament were not in any Treaty, which
this Agreement might be prejudicial to.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="326"/>
This occasioned a Letter to my Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI>
wherein our General returning the Civilities,
and neither accepting nor refusing his Proposal,
put it upon his Honour, whether there was not
some Agreement or Concession between his
Majesty and the Parliament, in order to a Ge∣neral
Peace, which this Treaty might be pre∣judicial
to, or thereby be prejudicial to us.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> ingenuously declared, he
had heard the King had made some Concessions,
and he heartily wished he would make such
as would settle the Kingdom in Peace, that
<HI>Englishmen</HI> might not wound and destroy one a∣nother;
<HI>but that he declared he knew of no Treaty
commenced, nor any Thing past which could give us the
least Shadow of hope for any Advantage in not accept∣ing
his Conditions.</HI> At last telling us, <HI>That though
he did not insult over our Circumstances, yet if we
thought fit, upon any such Supposition, to refuse his
Offers, he was not to seek in his Measures.</HI></P>
<P>And it appeared so, for he immediately ad∣vanced
his Forlorns, and dispossessed us of two
advanced Quarters, and thereby streightened
us yet more.</P>
<P>We had now nothing to say, but treat, and
our General was so sensible of our Condition,
that he returned the Trumpet with a safe Con∣duct
for Commissioners at 12 a Clock that Night;
upon which a Cessation of Arms was agreed
on, we quitting <HI>Truro</HI> to the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI>
and he left St <HI>Allan</HI>'s to us to keep our head
Quarter.</P>
<P>The Conditions were soon agreed on, we dis∣banded
nine full Brigades of Horse, and all the
Conditions were observed with the most Honour
and Care by the Enemy that ever I saw in my
Life.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="327"/>
Nor can I omit to make very honourable Men∣tion
of this noble Gentleman, though I did not
like his Cause; but I never saw a Man of a more
pleasant, calm, courteous, down-right, honest
Behaviour in my Life; and, for his Courage
and personal Bravery in the Field, that we
had felt enough of. No Man in the World had
more Fire and Fury in him while in Action,
or more Temper and Softness out of it. In
short, and I cannot do him greater Honour,
he excedingly came near the Character of my
Foreign Heroe <HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> and in my Ac∣count,
is, of all the Soldiers in <HI>Europe,</HI> the fit∣test
to be reckoned in the second Place of Ho∣nour
to him.</P>
<P>I had particular Occasion to see much of his
Temper in all this Action, being one of the
Hostages given by our General for the Perfor∣mance
of the Conditions, in which Circumstance
the General did me several times the Honour to
send to me to dine with him; and was exceed∣ingly
pleased to discourse with me about the
Passages of the Wars in <HI>Germany,</HI> which I had
served in; he having been at the same time in
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> in the Service of Prince <HI>Mau∣rice;</HI>
but I observed if at any time my Civilities
extended to Commendations of his own Actions,
and especially to comparing him to <HI>Gustavus Adol∣phus,</HI>
he would blush like a Woman, and be
uneasy, declining the Discourse, and in this he
was still more like him.</P>
<P>Let no Man scruple my honourable Mention
of this noble Enemy, since no Man can suspect
me of favouring the Cause he embarked in, which
I served as heartily against as any Man in the
Army; but I cannot conceal extraordinary Me∣rit
for its being placed in an Enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="328"/>
This was the End of our making War; for
now we were all under Parole never to bear
Arms against the Parliament; and though some
of us did not keep our Word, yet I think a
Soldier's Parole ought to be the most sacred in
such Case, that a Soldier may be the easier
trusted at all Times upon his Word.</P>
<P>For my Part I went home fully contented,
since I could do my Royal Master no better
Service, that I had come off no worse.</P>
<P>The Enemy going now on in a full Current
of Success, and the King reduced to the last
Extremity, and <HI>Fairfax,</HI> by long Marches, being
come back within five Miles of <HI>Oxford;</HI> his Ma∣jesty
loath to be cooped up in a Town which
could on no Account hold long out, quits the
Town in a Disguise, leaving Sir <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI>
Governour, and being only attended with Mr.
<HI>Ashburnham</HI> and one more, rides away to <HI>New∣ark</HI>
and there fatally committed himself to the
Honour and Fidelity of the <HI>Scots,</HI> under General
<HI>Leven.</HI></P>
<P>There had been some little Bickering between
the Parliament and the <HI>Scots</HI> Commissioners,
concerning the Propositions which the <HI>Scots</HI> were
for a Treaty with the King upon, and the
Parliament refused it. The Parliament, upon
all Proposals of Peace, had formerly invited
the King to come and throw himself upon the
Honour, Fidelity and Affection of his Parlia∣ment;
and now the King from <HI>Oxford</HI> offering
to come up to <HI>London,</HI> on the Protection of the
Parliament for the Safety of his Person, they
refused him, and the <HI>Scots</HI> differed from them
in it, and were for a personal Treaty.</P>
<P>This, in our Opinion, was the Reason which
prompted the King to throw himself upon the Fi∣delity
<PB N="323" REF="329"/>
of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who really by their Insidelity
had been the Ruine of all his Affairs, and now,
by their perfidious Breach of Honour and
Faith with him, will be virtually and mediately
the Ruine of his Person.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> were, as all the Nation besides them
was, surprized at the King's coming among them;
the Parliament began very high with them, and
send an Order to General <HI>Leven</HI> to send the
King to <HI>Warwick</HI> Castle; but he was not so hasty
to part with so rich a Prize. As soon as the
King came to the General, he signs an Order
to Collonel <HI>Ballasis,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Newark,</HI>
to surrender it, and immediately the <HI>Scots</HI> de∣camp
homewards, carrying the King in the
Camp with them, and marching on, a House
was ordered to be provided for the King at
<HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>
<P>And now the Parliament saw their Error,
in refusing his Majesty a Personal Treaty, which
if they had accepted, (their Army was not yet
taught the way of huffing their Masters,) the
Kingdom might have been settled in Peace.
Upon this the Parliament send to General <HI>Le∣ven</HI>
to have his Majesty not <HI>be sent,</HI> which was
their first Language, but <HI>be suffered to come</HI> to
<HI>London,</HI> to treat with his Parliament; before it
was, <HI>Let the King be sent to</HI> Warwick <HI>Castle;</HI> now
'tis, <HI>To let his Majesty come to</HI> London <HI>to treat with
his People.</HI></P>
<P>But neither one or the other would do with
the <HI>Scots;</HI> but we who knew the <HI>Scots</HI> best, knew
that there was <HI>one Thing</HI> would do with them, if
the other would not, and that was Money; and
therefore our Hearts aked for the King.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots,</HI> as I said, had retreated to <HI>New∣castle</HI>
with the King, and there they quartered
<PB N="324" REF="330"/>
their whole Army at large upon the Country;
the Parliament voted they had no farther Oc∣casion
for the <HI>Scots,</HI> and desired them to go home
about their Business. I do not say it was in these
Words, but in whatsoever good Words their
Messages might be expressed, this and nothing
less was the <HI>English</HI> of it. The <HI>Scots</HI> reply, by
setting forth ther Loffes Damages, and Dues,
the Substance of which was, <HI>Pay us our Money, and
we will be gone, or else we won't stir.</HI> The Parliament
call for an Account of their Demands, which the
<HI>Scots</HI> give in, amounting to a Million; but, ac∣cording
to their Custom, and especially finding
that the Army under <HI>Fairfax</HI> inclined gradual∣ly
that Way, fall down to 500000l. and at last
to four; but all the while this is transacting, a
separate Treaty is carried on at <HI>London</HI> with
the Commissioners of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and afterwards
at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> by which it is given them to
understand, that whereas upon Payment of the
Money, the <HI>Scots</HI> Army is to march out of
<HI>England,</HI> and to give up all the Towns and Gar∣risons
which they hold in this Kingdom, so
they are to take it for granted, that 'tis the
meaning of the Treaty, that they shall leave the
King in the Hands of the <HI>English</HI> Parliament.</P>
<P>To make this go down the better, the <HI>Scotch</HI>
Parliament, upon his Majesty's Desire to go
with their Army into <HI>Scotland,</HI> send him for
Answer, that it cannot be for the Safety of his
Majesty or of the State, to come into <HI>Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tland,</HI>
not having taken the Covenant, and this was
carried in their Parliament but by two Voices.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scots</HI> having refused his coming into
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as was concerted between the two
Houses, and their Army being to march out
of <HI>England,</HI> the delivering up the King became
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
a Consequence of the Thing unavoidable, and
of Necessity.</P>
<P>His Majesty thus deserted of those into whose
Hands he had thrown himself, took his Leave
of the <HI>Scots</HI> General at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> telling him
only, in few Words, this sad Truth, <HI>That he was
Bought and Sold.</HI> The Parliament Commissioners
received him at <HI>Newcastle</HI> from the <HI>Scots,</HI> and
brought him to <HI>Holmby</HI> House, in <HI>Northamton∣shire;</HI>
from whence, upon the Quarrels and
Feuds of Parties, he was fetched by a Party
of Horse, commanded by one Cornet <HI>Joyce,</HI>
from the Army, upon their mutinous Rendez∣vous
at <HI>Triplow-Heath;</HI> and, after this, suffering
many Violences, and Varieties of Circumstances
among the Army, was carried to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
from whence his Majesty very readily made his
Escape; but not having Notice enough to pro∣vide
effectual Means for his more effectual Deli∣verance
was obliged to deliver himself to Collo∣nel
<HI>Hammond</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Wight.</HI> Here, after
some very indifferent Usage, the Parliament
pursued a farther Treaty with him, and all
Points were agreed but two. The entire Abo∣lishing
Episcopacy, which the King declared
to be against his Conscience, and his Coronation
Oath; and the Sale of the Church-Lands, which
he declared, being most of them Gifts to God
and the Church, by Persons deceased, his
Majesty thought could not be alienated without
the higheft Sacrilege, and if taken from the
Uses to which they were appointed by the Wills
of the Donors, ought to be restored back to
the Heirs and Families of the Persons who
bequeathed them.</P>
<P>And these two Articles so stuck with his
Majesty, that he ventured his Fortune and
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
Royal Family, and his own Life for them:
However, at last, the King condescended so far
in these, that the Parliament voted his Ma∣jesty's
Concessions to be sufficient to settle and
establish the Peace of the Nation.</P>
<P>This Vote discovered the bottom of all the
Counsels which then prevailed; for the Army, who
knew if Peace were once settled, they should
be undone, took the Alarm at this, and clubbing
together in Committees and Councils, at last
brought themselves to a Degree of Hardness
above all that ever this Nation saw; for, cal∣ling
into Question the Proceedings of their
Masters who employed them, they immediately
fall to Work upon the Parliament, remove Col∣lonel
<HI>Hammond,</HI> who had the Charge of the
King, and used him honourably, place a new
Guard upon him, dismiss the Commissioners,
and put a Stop to the Treaty; and, following
their Blow, march to <HI>London,</HI> place Regiments
of Foot at the Parliament House Door, and,
as the Members came up, sieze upon all those
whom they had down in a List as Promoters of
the Settlement and Treaty, and would not
suffer them to fit; but the rest, who being of
their own Stamp, are permitted to go on, carry
on the Designs of the Army, revive their
Votes of Non-Addresses to the King, and then,
upon the Army's Petition, to bring all Delin∣quents
to Justice; the Masque was thrown off,
the Word all is declared to be meant the King,
as well as every Man else they pleased. 'Tis
too sad a Story, and too much a Matter of Grief
to me, and to all good Men, to renew the Black∣ness
of those Days, when Law and Justice was
under the Feet of Power; the Army ruled the
Parliament, the private Officers their Generals,
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
the common Soldiers their Officers, and Con∣fusion
was in every Part of the Government: In
this Hurry they sacrificed their King, and
shed the Blood of the <HI>English</HI> Nobility without
Mercy.</P>
<P>The History of the Times will supply the Pa∣ticulars
which I omit, being willing to confine
my self to my own Accounts and Observations;
I was now no more an Actor, but a melancholly
Observator of the Misfortunes of the Times. I
had given my Parole not to take up Arms against
the Parliament, and I saw nothing to invite me
to engage on their Side; I saw a World of
Confusion in all their Counsels, and I always
expected that in a Chain of Distractions, as it
generally fals out, the last Link would be De∣struction;
and though I pretended to no Pro∣phecy,
yet the Progress of Affairs have brought
it to pass, and I have seen Providence, who suf∣fered,
for the Correction of this Nation, the
Sword to govern and devour us, has at last
brought Destruction <HI>by the Sword,</HI> upon the Head
of most of the Party who first drew it.</P>
<P>If together with the brief Account of what Con∣cern
I had in the Active Part of the War, I leave
behind me some of my own Remarks and Ob∣servations,
it may be pertinent enough to my
Design, and not unuseful to Posterity.</P>
<P>1. I observed by the Sequel of Things, that
it may be some Excuse to the first Parliament,
who began this War, to say that they manife∣sted
their Designs were not aimed at the Monar∣chy,
nor their Quarrel at the Person of the
King; because, when they had him in their
Power, though against his Will, they would have
restored both his Person and Dignity as a King,
only loading it with such Clogs of the People's
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
Power as they at first pretended to, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
the Militia, and Power of naming the great
Officers at Court, and the like; which Powers,
it was never denied, had been stretched too
far in the Beginning of this King's Reign, and
several things done illegally, which his Majesty
had been sensible of, and was willing to rectify;
but they having obtained the Power by Victory,
resolved so to secure themselves, as that when∣ever
they laid down their Arms, the King
should not be able to do the like again: And
thus far they were not to be so much blamed,
and we did not, on our own Part, blame them,
when they had obtained the Power, for parting
with it on good Terms.</P>
<P>But when I have thus far advocated for
the Enemies, I must be very free to state the
Crimes of this Bloody War, by the Events of
it. 'Tis manifest there were among them,
from the Beginning, a Party who aimed at the
very Root of the Government, and at the very
thing which they brought to pass, <HI>viz.</HI> The
deposing and murthering of their Sovereign;
and, as the Devil is always Master where Mis∣chief
is the Work, this Party prevailed, turned
the other out of Doors, and over-turned all
that little Honesty that might be in the first
Beginning of this unhappy Strife.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this was, the Presby∣terians
saw their Error when it was too late,
and then would gladly have joined the Royal
Party, to have suppressed this new Leaven, which
had infected the Lump; and this is very re∣markable,
that most of the first Champions of
this War, who bore the Brunt of it, when
the King was powerful and prosperous, and
when there was nothing to be got by it but
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
Blows, first or last, were so ill used by this In∣dependant
powerful Party, who tripped up
the Heels of all their Honesty, that they were
either forced, by ill Treatment, to take up
Arms on our Side, or suppressed and reduced by
them. In this the Justice of Providence seemed
very conspicuous, that these having pushed all
things by Violence against the King, and by
Arms and Force brought him to their Will,
were at once both robbed of the End, their
Church-Government, and punished for draw∣ing
their Swords against <HI>their Masters,</HI> by <HI>their
own Servants</HI> drawing the Sword against them;
and God, in his due Time, punished the others
too: And, what was yet farther strange, the
Punishment of this Crime of making War against
their King, singled out those very Men, both
in the Army and in the Parliament, who were
the greatest Champions of the Presbyterian Cause
in the Council, and in the Field. Some Mi∣nutes
too of Circumstances I cannot forbear obser∣ing,
though they are not very material, as to
the Fatality and Revolutions of Days and
Times.</P>
<P>A <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Gentleman of <HI>Lancashire,</HI> a
very religious Man in his way, who had kept a
Calculate of Times, and had observed mightily
the Fatality of Times, Places and Actions, be∣ing
at my Father's House, was discoursing once
upon the just Judgment of God in dating his
Providences, so as to signify to us his Displeasure
at particular Circumstances; and among an in∣finite
Number of Collections he had made, these
were some which I took particular Notice of,
and from whence I began to observe the like.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="336"/>
1. That King <HI>Edward</HI> the VIth died the very
same Day of the same Month in which he caused
the Altar to be taken down, and the Image of
the Blessed Virgin in the Cathedral of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s.</P>
<P>2. That <HI>Cranmer</HI> was burnt at <HI>Oxford</HI> the same
Day and Month that he gave King <HI>Henry</HI> the
VIIIth Advice to Divorce his Queen <HI>Catherine.</HI></P>
<P>3. That Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> died the same Day
and Month that she resolved, in her Privy Coun∣cil,
to behead the Queen of <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>4. That King <HI>James</HI> died the same Day that
he published his Book against <HI>Bellarmine.</HI></P>
<P>5. That King <HI>charles</HI>'s long Parliament, which
ruined him, began the very same Day and Month
which that Parliament began, that at the Re∣quest
of his Predecessor robbed the <HI>Roman</HI> Church
of all her Revenues, and suppressed Abbies and
Monasteries.</P>
<P>How just his Calculations were, or how true
the Matter of Fact, I cannot tell, but it put me
upon the same in several Actions and Successes
of this War.</P>
<P>And I found a great many Circumstances, as
to Time and Action, which befel both his Ma∣jesty
and his Parties first.</P>
<P>Then others which befel the Parliament
and Presbyterian Faction which raised the war.</P>
<P>Then the Independant Tyranny which suc∣ceeded
and supplanted the first Party.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Scots,</HI> who acted on both Sides.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Restoration and Re-establishment
of the Loyalty and Religion of our Ancestors.</P>
<P>1. For King <HI>Charles</HI> the First; 'tis observable
that the Charge against the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> a
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
thing which his Majesty blamed himself for all
the Days of his Life, and at the Moment of his
last Suffering, was first read in the Lords House
on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> the same Day of the
Month six Year that the King himself was brought
to the Block.</P>
<P>2. That the King was carried away Prisoner
from <HI>Newark,</HI> by the <HI>Scots, May</HI> 10, the same
Day six Year that, against his Conscience and
Promise, he passed the Bill of Attainder against
the loyal noble Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI></P>
<P>3. The same Day seven Year that the King
entered the House of Commons for the five Mem∣bers,
which all his Friends blamed him for, the
same Day the Rump voted bringing his Majesty
to Tryal, after they had set by the Lords for
not agreeing to it, which was the 3d of <HI>January</HI>
1648.</P>
<P>4. The 12th of <HI>May</HI> 1646, being the Surren∣der
of <HI>Newark,</HI> the Parliament held a Day of
Thanksgiving and Rejoicing, for the Reduction
of the King and his Party, and finishing the
War, which was the same Day five Year that
the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> was beheaded.</P>
<P>5. The Battle at <HI>Naseby,</HI> which ruin'd the
King's Affairs, and where his Secretary and his
Office was taken, was the 14th of <HI>June</HI> the same
Day and Month the first Commission was given
out by his Majesty to raise Forces.</P>
<P>6. The Queen voted a Traytor by the Parlia∣ment
the 3d of <HI>May,</HI> the same Day and Month
she carried the Jewels into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>7. The same Day the King defeated <HI>Essex</HI> in
the West, his Son King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was defeated
at <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>8. Arch-bishop <HI>Laud</HI>'s House at <HI>Lambeth</HI> assaulted
by the Mob, the same Day of the same Month that
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
he advised the King to make War upon the
<HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>9. Impeached the 15th of <HI>December</HI> 1640, the
same Day Twelve-month that he ordered
the Common-Prayer-Book of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be
printed, in order to be imposed upon the
<HI>Scots,</HI> from which all our Troubles began.</P>
<P>But many more, and more strange, are the
critical Junctures of Affairs in the Case of the
Enemy, or at least more observed by me.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John Hotham,</HI> who repulsed his Majesty
and refused him Admittance into <HI>Hull</HI> before the
War, was siezed at <HI>Hull</HI> by the</P>
<P>same Parliament
for whom he had done it, the same 10th Day
of <HI>August</HI> two Years that he drew the first Blood
in that War.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Hambden</HI> of <HI>Buckinghamshire</HI> killed the same
Day one Year that the Mob Petition from <HI>Bucks</HI>
was presented to the King about him, as one of
the five Members.</P>
<P>3. Young Captain <HI>Hotham</HI> executed the 1st of
<HI>January,</HI> the same Day that he assisted Sir <HI>Tho∣mas
Fairfax</HI> in the first Skirmish with the King's
Forces at <HI>Bramham-Moor.</HI></P>
<P>4. The same Day and Month, being the 6th
of <HI>August</HI> 1641, that the Parliament voted to
to raise an Army against the King, the same
Day and Month, <HI>Anno</HI> 1648, the Parliament
were assaulted and turned out of Doors by that
very Army, and none left to sit but who the
Soldiers pleased, which were therefore called the
<HI>Rump.</HI></P>
<P>5. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> deserted the King, who
had made him General of the Horse, and went
over to the Parliament, and the 9th of <HI>March</HI>
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
1641, carried the Commons reproaching Decla∣ration
to the King; and afterwards taking up
Arms for the King against the Parliament, was
beheaded by them the 9th of <HI>March</HI> 1648, just
seven Years after.</P>
<P>6. The Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> was sent to by the
King to come to his Assistance and refused,
the 11th of <HI>July</HI> 1641, and that very Day seven
Years after was taken by the Parliament at
<HI>St. Needs.</HI></P>
<P>7. Collonel <HI>Massey</HI> defended <HI>Gloucester</HI> against
the King, and beat him off the 5th of <HI>septem∣ber</HI>
1643, was after taken by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Men fight∣ing
for the King, on the 5th of <HI>September</HI> 1651,
two or three Days after the Fight at <HI>Worcester.</HI></P>
<P>8. <HI>Richard Cromwell</HI> resigning because he could
not help it, the Parliament voted a free Com∣monwealth,
without a single Person or House
of Lords; this was the 25th of <HI>May</HI> 1658; the
25th of <HI>May</HI> 1660 the King landed at <HI>Dover,</HI>
and restored the Government of a single Person
and House of Lords.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Lambert</HI> was proclaimed a Traytor by the
Parliament, <HI>April</HI> the 20th, being the same Day
he proposed to <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to take upon him
the Title of King.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Monk</HI> being taken Prisoner at <HI>Nantwich</HI> by
Sir <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> revolted to the Parliament,
the same Day nineteen Years he declared for
the King, and thereby restored the Royal Au∣thority.</P>
<P>11. The Parliament voted to approve of Sir
<HI>John Hotham</HI>'s repulsing the King at <HI>Hull,</HI> the
28th of <HI>April</HI> 1642; the 28th of <HI>April</HI> 1660, the
Parliament first debated in the House the resto∣ring
the King to the Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="340"/>
12. The Agitators of the Army formed them∣selves
into a Cabal, and held their first Meet∣ing
to sieze on the King's Person, and take him
into their Custody from <HI>Holmby,</HI> the 28th of
<HI>April</HI> 1647; the same Day 1660, the Parliament
voted the Agitators to be taken into Custody,
and committed as many of them as could be
found.</P>
<P>13. The Parliament voted the Queen a Tray∣tor
for assisting her Husband the King, <HI>May</HI> the
3d 1643, her Son King <HI>Charles</HI> II. was presented
with the Votes of Parliament to restore him, and
the Present of 50000l. the 3d of <HI>May</HI> 1660.</P>
<P>14. The same Day the Parliament passed the
Act for Recognition of <HI>Oliver Cromwell, October</HI>
the 13th 1654. <HI>Lambert</HI> broke the Parliament
and set up the Army 1659, <HI>October</HI> the 13th.</P>
<P>Some other Observations I have made, which
as not so pertinent I forbear to publish, among
which I have noted the Fatality of some Days
to Parties, as,</P>
<P>The 2d of <HI>September,</HI> the Fight at <HI>Dunbar;</HI> the
Fight at <HI>Worcester;</HI> the Oath against a single
Person past; <HI>Oliver</HI>'s first Parliament called: For
the Enemy.</P>
<P>The 2d of <HI>September, Essex</HI> defeated in <HI>Corn∣wall;
Oliver</HI> died; City Works demolished: For
the King.</P>
<P>The 29th of <HI>May,</HI> Prince <HI>Charles</HI> born; <HI>Lei∣cester</HI>
taken by Storm; King <HI>Charles</HI> II. restored:
Ditto.</P>
<P>Fatality of Circumstances in this unhappy
War, as,</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="341"/>
1. The <HI>English</HI> Parliament call in the <HI>Scots,</HI> to
invade their King, and are invaded themselves
by the same <HI>Scots,</HI> in Defence of the King whose
Case, and the Design of the Parliament the
<HI>Scots</HI> had mistaken.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Scots,</HI> who unjustly assisted the Parlia∣ment
to conquer their lawful Sovereign, con∣trary
to their Oath of Allegiance, and without
any Pretence on the King's Part, are after∣wards
absolutely conquered and subdued by
the same Parliament they assisted.</P>
<P>3. The Parliament, who raised an Army to
depose their King, deposed by the very Army
they had raised.</P>
<P>4. The Army broke three Parliaments,
and are at last broke by a free Parliament
and all they had done by the Military Power,
undone at once by the Civil.</P>
<P>5. Abundance of the Chief Men, who by
their fiery Spirits involved the Nation in a Civil
War, and took up Arms against their Prince, first
or last met with Ruine or Disgrace from their
own Party.</P>
<P>1. Sir <HI>John Hotham</HI> and his Son, who struck
the first Stroke, both beheaded or hanged by
the Parliament.</P>
<P>2. Major General <HI>Massey</HI> three times taken
Prisoner by them, and once wounded at <HI>Wor∣cester.</HI></P>
<P>3. Major General <HI>Langhorn.</HI> 4. Collonel <HI>Poyer:</HI>
And, 5. Collonel <HI>Powell,</HI> changed Sides, and at
last taken, could obtain no other Favour than
to draw Lots for their Lives; Collonel <HI>Poyer</HI>
drew the Dead Lot, and was shot to Death.</P>
<P>6. Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who, when the House voted
who should be reprieved, Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> who
<PB N="336" REF="342"/>
had been their worst Enemy, or the Earl of
<HI>Holland,</HI> who, excepting one Offence, had been
their constant Servant, voted <HI>Goring</HI> to be
spared, and the Earl to die.</P>
<P>7. The Earl of <HI>Essex,</HI> their first General.</P>
<P>8. Sir <HI>William Waller.</HI></P>
<P>9. Lieutenant General <HI>Ludlow.</HI></P>
<P>10. The Earl of <HI>Manchester.</HI></P>
<P>All disgusted and voted out of the Army,
though they had stood the first Shock of the War,
to make way for the new Model of the Army,
and introduce a Party.</P>
<P>In all these Confusions I have observed two
great Errors, one of the King, and one of his
Friends.</P>
<P>Of the King, that when he was in their Cu∣stody,
and at their Mercy, he did not comply
with their Propositions of Peace before their
Army, for want of Employment, fell into Heats
and Mutinies; that he did not at first grant
the <HI>Scots</HI> their own Conditions, which, if he
had done, he had gone into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and then,
if the <HI>English</HI> would have fought the <HI>Scots</HI> for
him, he had a Reserve of his loyal Friends,
who would have had Room to have fallen in
with the <HI>Scots</HI> to his Assistance, who were af∣ter
dispersed and destroyed in small Parties at∣tempting
to serve him.</P>
<P>While his Majesty remained at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> the
Queen wrote to him, perswading him to make
Peace upon any Terms; and in Politicks her
Majesty's Advice was certainly the best: For,
however low he was brought by a Peace, it
must have been better than the Condition he
was then in.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="343"/>
The Error I mention of the King's Friends
was this, that after they saw all was lost, they
could not be content to sit still, and reserve
themselves for better Fortunes, and wait the
happy Time when the Divisions of the Ene∣my
would bring them to certain Ruin; but
must hasten their own Miseries by frequent
fruitless Risings, in the Face of a victorious Ene∣my,
in small Parties, and I always found these
Effects from it.</P>
<P>1. The Enemy, who were always together
by the Ears, when they were let alone, were
united and reconciled when we gave them any
Interruption; as particularly, in the Case of
the first Assault the Army made upon them,
when Collonel <HI>Pride,</HI> with his Regiment garbled
the House, as they called it, at that Time,
a fair Opportunity offered; but it was omit∣ted
till it was too late: That Insult upon the
House had been attempted the Year before,
but was hindered by the little Insurrections of
the Royal Party, and the sooner they had fal∣len
out, the better.</P>
<P>2. These Risings being desperate, with vast
Disadvantages, and always suppressed, ruined
all our Friends; the Remnants of the Cavaliers
were lessened, the stoutest and most daring
were cut off, and the King's Interest exceed∣ingly
weakened, there not being less than Thir∣ty
Thousand of his best Friends cut off in the
several Attempts made at <HI>Maidstone, Colchester,
Lancashire, Pembrook, Pontfract, Kingston, Preston,
Warrington, Worcester,</HI> and other Places. Had
these Men all reserved their Fortunes to a Con∣junction
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> at either of the Inva∣sions
they made into this Kingdom, and acted
with the Conduct and Courage they were known
<PB N="338" REF="344"/>
Masters of, perhaps neither of those <HI>Scots</HI> Armies
had been defeated.</P>
<P>But the Impatience of our Friends ruin'd all;
for my Part, I had as good a Mind to put my
Hand to the Ruine of the Enemy as any of them,
but I never saw any tolerable Appearance of a
Force able to match the Enemy, and I had no
Mind to be beaten, and then hanged. Had we
let them alone, they would have fallen into so
many Parties and Factions, and so effectually have
torn one another to Pieces, that which soever
Party had come to us, we should, with them,
have been too hard for all the rest.</P>
<P>This was plain by the Course of Things after∣wards,
when the Independant Army had ruffled
the Presbyterian Parliament, the Soldiery of that
Party made no Scruple to join us, and would
have restored the King with all their Hearts,
and many of them did join us at last.</P>
<P>And the Consequence, though late, ended so;
for they fell out so many times, <HI>Army</HI> and <HI>Par∣liament,
Parliament</HI> and <HI>Army,</HI> and alternately pul∣led
one another down so often, till at last the
Presbyterians, who began the War, ended it;
and, to be rid of their Enemies, rather than for
any Love to the Monarchy, restored King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second, and brought him in on the very Day
that they themselves had formerly resolved the
Ruine of his Father's Government, being the 29th
of <HI>May,</HI> the same Day 20 Year that the private
Cabal in <HI>London</HI> concluded their Secret League
with the <HI>Scots,</HI> to embroil his Father King <HI>Charles</HI>
the First.</P>
