<HEAD>TO <HI>Francis Delaval,</HI> Esq;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I consider the long Intimacy that has subsisted between us, the Obligati∣ons I owe to your generous, disin∣terested Friendship, and the Protec∣tion and Encouragement I received both from you and your Brother, when Necessity listed me in the Ser∣vice of the Public; there is no Man to whom with equal Propriety and Pleasure I can address the fol∣lowing Work. It would be paying a bad Compliment to the Town were I to trouble you with an Apo∣logy for the Inconsiderableness of the Present. I thought it worthy their Attention, and consequently not beneath the Acceptance of my Friend.
<PB N="iv" REF="4"/>
With the Aid of a Love-plot I could have spun out the Piece to the Ex∣tent of five Acts; but besides that I wanted to confine the Eye to the single Object of my Satire, I declare myself a Rebel to this universal Ty∣rant, who, not contented with ex∣citing all that is pitiful or terrible in human Nature, has claim'd the Privilege of occasioning every Thing that is ridiculous or contemptible in it; and thus from the abject Sub∣mission of our dramatic <HI>Poets</HI> is both <HI>Tragedy</HI> and <HI>Comedy</HI> subjected to the Power of <HI>Love.</HI> It may be thought presumptuous in me to have digni∣fy'd so short a Performance with the Name of a <HI>Comedy;</HI> but when my Reasons why it cannot be call'd a <HI>Farce</HI> are consider'd, the <HI>Critics</HI> must indulge me with the Use of that Title; at least, till they can furnish me with a better. As the Follies and Absurdities of Men are the sole
<PB N="v" REF="5"/>
Objects of <HI>Comedy</HI> so the Powers of the Imagination (Plot and Incident excepted) are in this kind of Writing greatly restrain'd. No unnatural As∣semblages, no Creatures of the Fancy can procure the Protection of the <HI>Comic</HI> Muse; Men and Things must appear as they are. To <HI>Farce</HI> greater Liberties are permitted. I look upon <HI>Farce</HI> to hold the same Rank in the Drama, that <HI>Burlesque</HI> does in other Poetry. It is employ'd either in debasing lofty Subjects▪ or in raising humble Ones▪ Of the two Kinds we have Examples in the <HI>Tom Thumb</HI> of Mr. <HI>F</HI>—, and a Travesty of the <HI>Ulysses,</HI> where <HI>Penelope</HI> keeps an Alehouse, <HI>Telemachus</HI> is a Tapster, and the <HI>Heroe</HI> a recruiting Serjeant. In both these Instances you see Nature is re∣versed; but as I flatter myself in the following Sheets her Steps have been trod with an indeviating Sim∣plicity, give me Leave to hope, that
<PB N="vi" REF="6"/>
tho' I have not attain'd the <HI>Togata,</HI> yet I have reach'd the <HI>Tabernaria</HI> of the <HI>Romans.</HI> I once intended to have thrown into this Address the Con∣tents of many of our Conversations on the Subject of <HI>Comedy;</HI> for in whatever Dissipations the World may suppose our Days to have been con∣sumed, many, many Hours have been consecrated to other Subjects than generally employ the Gay and the Giddy. I hope the present Oc∣casion will demonstrate that Pleasure has not been always my Pursuit; and unless I am greatly mistaken it will soon be discover'd that, join'd to the acknowledged best Heart in the World, Mr. <HI>Delaval</HI> has a Head capable of directing it. As I am now above the Reach of common Obliga∣tions, an Acknowledgment of these Qualities in the Person of a Man, who has honour'd me with his Friend∣ship, is the sole Cause of the Trouble
<PB N="vii" REF="7"/>
you now receive. Long has been our Union, may it never be divided till the fatal Stroke, that demolishes all sublunary Connections, shall reach One of us, which One will I hope be</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I was always apprehensive that the Subject of the following Piece was too abstracted and singular for the Comprehension of a mix'd Assembly. <HI>Juno Lucina, Jupiter Tonans, Phi∣dias, Praxiteles,</HI> with the other Gentlemen and Ladies of Antiquity, were, I dare say, utterly unknown to my very good Friends of the Gal∣lery; nor to speak the Truth do I beleive they had many Acquaintances in the other Parts of the House. But tho' I despair of gratifying the <HI>Populum Tributim</HI> of the THEATRE, yet I flatter myself the <HI>Primores Populi</HI> will find me no disagreeable Companion in the Closet, <HI>et satis magnum Theatrum mihi estis.</HI></P>
<P>I was neither prompted by a lucrative, nor an ambitious Motive to this Undertaking. My Design was to serve a Man, who had ever great Merit with his Friends, and to whom, on the score of some late Transactions, I think the Public vastly indebted. That my good Intenti∣ons for Mr. WORSDALE have proved successful, is intirely oweing to the Generosity and Huma∣nity of the Managers of <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> THEATRE;
<PB N="ix" REF="9"/>
they have given him a Benefit and are jointly entitled to my Thanks; but as to Mr. GARRICK, I have more personal Obligati∣ons. I take this Opportunity of assuring him, that I shall ever retain the most grateful Re∣membrance of his Assistance, Assiduity, and kind Concern▪ at the Birth, Progress, and un∣timely End of this my last and favourite Off∣spring.</P>
<P>The Objects of my Satire were such as I thought, whether they were consider'd in a moral, a political, or a ridiculous Light, deser∣ved the Notice of the <HI>Comic</HI> Muse. I was de∣termined to brand those <HI>Goths</HI> in Science, who had prostituted the useful Study of Antiquity to trifling superficial Purposes; who had blasted the Progress of the elegant Arts amongst us, by unpardonable Frauds and absurd Prejudices; and who had corrupted the Minds and Morals of our Youth, by persuading them that what only serves to illustrate Literature was true Learning, and active Idleness real Business. How far this End has been obtain'd is now in the following Sheets more generally submitted to the Public.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Carmine,</HI> I vow you are a very judicious Person. I was always said to be like that Family. When my Piece was first done, the Limner did me after <HI>Venus de Medicis,</HI> which I suppose might be one of <HI>Mary</HI>'s Sisters▪ but Things must change; to be sitting for my

<P>Great! great indeed!</P>

<P>Great? Amazing! divine! oh, let me embrace the dear dismember'd Bust! a little far∣ther off. I'm ravish'd! I'm transported! What an Attitude? But then the Locks! How I adore the Simplicity of the Antients! How unlike the present, priggish, prick-eard Puppies! How grace∣fully they fall all adown the Cheek! so decent, and so grave, and—who the Devil do you think it is, <HI>Brush?</HI> Is it a Man, or a Woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Canto.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Connoisseurs differ. Some will have it to be the <HI>Jupiter Tonans</HI> of <HI>Phidias,</HI> and others the <HI>Venus</HI> of <HI>Paphos</HI> from <HI>Praxiteles;</HI> but I don't think it fierce enough for the first, nor handsome enough for the last.</P>

<P>Not quite—therefore I am inclined to join with Signor <HI>Julio de Pampedillo,</HI> who in a Treatise, dedicated to the King of the two <HI>Sicilies,</HI> calls it the <HI>Serapis</HI> of the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> and supposes it to have been fabricated about e∣leven hundred and three Years before the Mo∣saick Account of the Creation.</P>

<P>Upon my honour, 'tis a ver fine Bust; but where is de Nose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nov.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Nose; what care I for the Nose? Where is de Nose? Why, Sir, if it had a Nose, I would not give Six-pence for it.—How the Devil should we distinguish the Works of the Antients, if they were perfect?—The Nose indeed! Why I don't suppose now, but, bar∣ring the Nose, <HI>Rubiliac</HI> could cut as good a Head ev'ry whit.—<HI>Brush,</HI> who is this Man with his Nose? The Fellow should know some∣thing of something too; for he speaks broken English.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Brush.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is Mynheer <HI>Groningen;</HI> a great Connoisseur in Painting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nov.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be; but as to Sculpture, I am his very humble Servant. A Man must know damn'd little of Statuary, that dislikes a Bust for want of a Nose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Canto.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Sir.—The Nose itself with∣out the Head, nay in another's Possession, would
<PB N="27" REF="39"/>
be an Estate.—But here are behind, Gen∣tlemen and Ladies, an equestrian Statue of <HI>Marcus Aurelius</HI> without the Horse; and a compleat Statue of the Emperor <HI>Trajan,</HI> with only the Head and Legs missing; both from <HI>Herculaneum.</HI>—This Way, Gentlemen and Ladies.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Alderman</HI> is in the right. The Affair is a Trifle; but a twenty Guinea Job.</P>

<P>Twenty Guineas! You should have twenty of my Teeth as—</P>

<SP>

<P>You mean if you had them—Your Ladyship does not know the Value of that Piece of China. It is the right old Japan of the pea green Kind. Lady <HI>Mandarin</HI> offer'd me, if I could match it, fourscore Guineas for the Pair.</P>

<P>Maam, I would willingly set you right in this Affair; you don't seem acquainted with these Kind of Things; therefore, I have the

Honour to tell you that the Crack in the Middle is a Mark of it's Antiquity, and enhances it's Value; and these Gentlemen are, I dare say, of the same Opinion.</P>
