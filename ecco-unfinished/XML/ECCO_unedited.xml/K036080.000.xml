<HEAD>HEREDITARY &amp; INDEFEASIBLE RIGHT
OF
KINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE hereditary-indeseasible right of kings,
and passive obedience and non-resist∣ance
its genuine offspring, are doctrines which
of late have made a great noise in Europe, and
particularly in this island.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider man, abstracted from
all positive engagements, we find nothing in
his nature, or in his situation, to subject him
to the power of any, his creator and his pa∣rents
excepted. The parental power is at an
end when children are grown up, and can
provide for themselves. At any rate the pa∣rental
power cannot subsist longer than the
life of the parents; for it is not a matter of
property to be transmitted by succession. since
it depends upon personal circumstances. And
supposing it a subject to be taken by succes∣sion,
it must descend to all the children equal∣ly,
at least to all the sons equally; for prime∣geniture,
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
'tis certain, is not a right of the law
of nature, but a consequence only of the feu∣dal
law. Hence it is a principle embraced by
the gravest writers, that all mankind are born
free, and independent of one another.</P>
<P>MAN indeed is fitted for society. His wants
prompt him to it, and his inclinations render
it agreeable. Accordingly we find mankind
almost every where parcelled out into societies,
which have been originally formed by acci∣dental
circumstances, more or less extensive.
A society of any extent cannot be without
government. The members must have laws
to determine their differences, and they must
have rulers to put their laws in execution. At
the same time, we find the constitutions of
different states, with regard to government,
almost as various as are the sentiments of men
concerning it: So that tho' government be
necessary to the well-being of society, yet from
this circumstance alone, were we to look no
further back, we may conclude no particular
form to be necessary, but the effect of choice,
or perhaps in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> measure of accident.</P>
<P>LET us trace this matter further, because it
is of importance. Man is a shy animal, and in
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
his original state rather averse to society. In
that state his wants were few, and easily sup∣plied;
therefore we may readily conclude,
that while acorns were the food of man, and
water his drink, there was neither use nor ap∣petite
for society. Accordingly we find man∣kind
originally in every corner of the earth
living in scattered habitations, with little in∣tercourse,
except among members of the same
family. The culture of corn laid the founda∣tion
of a more extensive intercourse, because
thereby mutual assistance became necessary.
When arts were invented, and industry increas∣ed,
it was found convenient to herd together
in towns and villages. From this closser con∣nection
one evil sprung, opposition of interests,
formerly rare; which at first was the occasion
of quarrels and bloodshed, and afterwards of
frequent appeals to men of weight and pro∣bity.
In time the necessity of fixed judges
to determine differences being discovered, the
election of these judges, which could not o∣therways
be than popular, was the first step to
government. The chief magistrate therefore
was originally no more but the chief judge,
whose powers were gradually extended, as
cases occured which required the interposition
of a superior governor. War introduced Sla∣very,
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
as it subjected those taken in battle to
the arbitrary will of their conquerors; and ab∣solute
power was too desirable an acquisition
to be the perquisite of subjects only. The
chief magistrate, however repugnant it is to
the nature of his office, did often grasp at it:
And history informs us, that the chief magi∣strate,
in different societies, has been often but
too successful. In a word, absolute indepen∣dence
and absolute power are the two ex∣tremes;
and the latter, at least so far as con∣cerns
sovereignty, could never have been in∣troduced,
but by passing through all the inter∣mediate
degrees.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT therefore is one of the arts
which necessity has suggested, which time and
experience have ripened, and which must be
perpetually subject to further improvements.
For government, like all other arts, being in∣vented
for the good of mankind, it must be the
privilege of every society to improve upon it,
as well as upon manufactures or husbandry.
No particular form therefore can be necessary,
as no particular form is preferable to another,
unless so far as it has a greater tendency to
promote its end, the good of the society. Com∣paring
democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy
together, this is their common standard.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
THERE is a people inhabiting the earth who
are not left to the choice of their governors,
but are by nature subjected to monarchy. In
every society there is a royal family, of a dif∣ferent
species from the other members. Every
monarch is born with marks of royalty, of a
peculiar shape, and with superior beauty. We
may suppose that the excellencies of the
mind are not inferior to those of the body; and
no wonder when this is the case, that perfect
obedience is given through all the state, and
that their monarch's will is their only law.—
There the parts are justly distributed, the so∣vereign
framed for command, as the subjects
for obedience, each in their several capacities
equally contributing to the only end of go∣vernment,
the well-being of the society. Here
there can be no stretching of prerogative on
the one hand, no resistance nor even murmurs
on the other. The monarch, taught by nature
that the sovereign power is a trust which ought
not to be abused, has no desire but to promote
the public welfare. The people, taught by
nature that passive obedience and non-resist∣ance
are the only means to promote their hap∣piness,
implicitly submit themselves to their
monarch's will.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7"/>
WERE mankind so framed, for of insects we
have been speaking, these gentlemen would
have reason on their side who declare so strong∣ly
for indefeasible-hereditary right, and the
reciprocal duty of passive obedience and non∣resistance:
Were our royal family, like that
of the bees, distinguished from the mass of the
people by superior excellencies, whether of the
mind or body, were they unerringly prompt∣ed
by nature to exercise their power for the
welfare of the society, blind obedience to their
will would be a virtue. But when we trust
with sovereign power one of the common
stamp of mankind, who has by nature no
marks of royalty, and who perhaps by nature
is not fitted for command, the absurdity is
great to maintain that this person ought to
be under no controul, and that we ought to
continue to trust him, after repeated instances
of his betraying the trust reposed in him.</P>
<P>I HAVE no occasion to consider whether con∣quest
be a good title by the law of nature to
acquire the absolute dominion of a state, as in
Turky, where the Grand Signior is supposed
to be the lord of the manor, and all the peo∣ple
his slaves. This is not government, the
characteristic of which is trust reposed in one
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
for the good of the whole. It is like a private
estate, which may be disposed of by the pro∣prietor
without controul, and applied for his
own purposes. It cannot be pretended that
the king of Britain has his right by conquest,
and therefore no support can be drawn to the
argument from that quarter.</P>
<P>THE scheme, it must be yielded, is so far
consistent, that if we suppose the king's right
to be indefeasible, and that he cannot be de∣prived
of his authority however much his
measures swerve from the rules of good go∣vernment,
it must follow, that the people are
tied to passive obedience and non-resistance,
as there is no medium betwixt resistance and
obedience. But where is the foundation of
the indefeasible right of the king, more than
of any other officer of the state? Does it lie
in the name? One should scarce think so,
when the name is indifferently applied to go∣vernors
who have very little power, as well
as to those whose power is the most extensive.</P>
<P>It cannot lie in the nature of the office,
which being a trust, is undoubtedly forfeitable
upon mal-administration. It will perhaps be
said to lie in the constitution of our govern∣ment
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
So far from it, that no man is bound
to obey the king's commands, unless delivered
in a certain form prescribed by law. And
even in France, supposing it an absolute mo∣narchy,
without any constitutional check upon
the king's actions, the king's power is notwith∣standing
limited. There cannot be such a
thing in nature as for a people voluntarily to
surrender their liberties to the arbitrary will
of any man. The act would be void as incon∣sistent
with the great law of nature, <HI>salus po∣puli
suprema lex.</HI></P>
<P>But the favourers of this doctrine when beat
out of these entrenchments, have a retreat
which they suppose impregnable. They allow
at last that the king may do wrong, by betray∣ing
the trust reposed in him. But then they
maintain, that a king having no superior on
earth can have no proper judge of his actions
but God alone, from whom his power slows,
and therefore is accountable to the Almighty
only. This is a fortress built upon sand. All
power no doubt is from God, natural and legal,
for he is the creator and upholder of all things.
But it follows from this, instead of being con∣tradictory
to it, that every sort of power is li∣mited
by the opposition of other powers, na∣tural
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
or legal, which are equally from God
with the power resisted. Perhaps they mean
that every king has his commission from the
Almighty, and not from the people. Histo∣ry
alone may suffice to inform us, that this
cannot be, when there have existed so many
kings unworthy of command. But supposing
the fact, it does not follow that this commission
is unlimited. On the contrary it must be li∣mited;
for who can patronize so impious a
doctrine as that God should give a direct com∣mission
to any being to plague and persecute
mankind, unless for their sins? The voice of
nature is the voice of God; and it is a fixed
principle in the law of nature, that where
there is no common judge to appeal to, the
party injured may do himself justice. The
laws are superior to the king, and these he must
be judged by. And supposing an absolute
government in the strictest sense, where the
king's will is law, yet there is one law above
him. If his actions generally tend to destruc∣tion
instead of government, the people, who
have no judge to appeal to, may lawfully do
themselves right. <HI>Salus populi est suprema lex.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, where is the necessity of God's
extraordinary interposition by granting his im∣mediate
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
commission to kings, when in other mat∣ters
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>words<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overn the world by second
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and ordinary means? Why should we
suppose, that mankind are deprived of their na∣tural
privilege of chusing their first magistrate,
more than of chusing those that are subordi∣nate?
Where is this commission recorded? Is
it given to all rulers who have the name of king,
or are some nations peculiarily honoured? Is
it given to all sovereigns in general, whether
honoured with the name of king or not? Had
all the crown-vassals in France, dukes, earls,
barons, this commission, who usurped, and,
for many ages, possessed a sort of sovereignty
within their own territories? These are puz∣zling
questions, and it would require a most
express revelation to put an end to the doubts
that arise from them. The legislative power,
one should imagine, is of a superior rank to
that of the king, because that power gives laws
to the king; yet no peculiar interposition
of providence is pretended in its behalf. This
body is left to be modelled bychoice or by ac∣cident.
The government of the world is after
this manner carried on; and yet nothing hap∣pens,
we may presume, contradictory to the
original plan of providence. Why then a pe∣culiar
providence in behalf of kings, or an im∣mediate
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
revelation, when there appears to be
no necessity? We cannot, withour impiety, ad∣mit
of the supposition, when, so far as weak
man can conjecture about the operations of
the Almighty, he never interposes by extraor∣dinary
means, unless where the ordinary dis∣pensations
of providence prove insufficient to
answer his purposes: We may therefore con∣clude,
with the highest degree of assurance, that
kings have no other commission from God but
what every magistrate has, supreme and sub∣ordinate,
who is legally elected according to
the standing laws of the society to which he
belongs.</P>
<P>BUT doubts and difficulties multiply upon
us. Were all the nations pointed out by an
express revelation who, like the Jews of old,
are to be governed by magistrates of God's ex∣press
appointment; were all the families point∣ed,
out who are to bear his commission, the re∣velation
would still be imperfect. It is not
enough to point out the family; the rules of
succession must also be ascertained, that there
be no dispure about the particular persons who
are to enjoy this hereditary-indefeasible right.
Here, without a new revelation, we are left
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
in a great measure at an uncertainty; for, are
we to follow the rules of England or France?
Are we to be guided by the law as at present
established, or as it was three centuries ago?
Whatever rules are followed, we must see that
they are in a great measure arbitrary, the off∣spring
of accident, or of the slenderest feelings
of the imagination, and established by custom
only. Has not this a strong appearance of
leaving to every nation the choice of their own
chief magistrates? Kings were at first general∣ly
chosen for life. It crept into practice to
make all public offices hereditary; and so
the sovereign power has generally come to be
hereditary, partly from the bent of the people,
and partly to avoid the inconveniencies which
elective monarchy is subjected to. But after
what manner is this hereditary right of kings
carried on? Not by any universal law, express∣ly
revealed or wrought into the nature of man;
so far from it, that the rules of succession are
different in every different country, established
by custom alone, or, in other words, by the con∣sent
of the people. In France, for example,
the females are totally excluded. Have fe∣males
by the appointment of the Almighty this
indefeasible right of succession? If they have,
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
France for many ages has been in a damn∣able
error. If not, the load of the guilt must
lie upon England, and upon many other coun∣tries
who admit of female succession. In my
apprehension, this consequence cannot be
evaded, otherways than by fairly acknowledg∣ing
that God, in this matter, as well as in
others, works by second causes without any
direct interposition, leaving every nation to be
governed by laws of their own appointment.
And indeed nothing looks liker a contradiction
than to suppose that hereditary monarchy is
the appointment of the Almighty, and that he
has bestowed upon every heir an indefeasible
right, not to be dispensed with upon any oc∣casion
whatever, without pointing out, by in∣fallible
marks, the persons who are to enjoy
this extraordinary privilege; commanding us,
under the pain of damnation, to give entire
submission to persons, as rulers appointed by
him, without revealing who these persons are.</P>
<P>ANOTHER inference may be drawn from this
doubtfulness of the law of succession. It is a
self-evident proposition, that no right can be
stronger than the title upon which it is found∣ed.
No title is more slender, in most instances,
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
than that of succession. How then can it be
maintained, that the hereditary right of kings
is indefeasible, when the title upon which the
right is founded is so weak and so arbitrary.
I think we may with certainty conclude, that
such a right must, upon every occasion, give
place to the primary rights of nature, such as
tend to our preservation and well-being; and
therefore that any particular heir may be safe∣ly
set aside, when he becomes dangerous to
the society. For this is assuredly the voice of
God, that in every conflict the weaker right
must yield to the stronger. Nay we may go
one step further, that if the good of the society
can be more promoted by a different form of
government, hereditary right may be laid aside
altogether without any crime; since the good
of the society is an object of much greater im∣portance
than the right of any particular family
can be.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the family of Stuart, no right
has a less air of divine authority than what they
had to the crown of Britain. To look no further
back than to the competition betwixt Bruce
and Baliol, which in these days appeared and
truly was an intricate affair: was Baliol a king
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
by divine appointment, when he was acknow∣ledged
and submitted to, in consequence of an
award given by Edward of England, who
plainly manifested, by the whole course of his
proceedings, that he was more swayed by po∣litical
considerations than by justice and equi∣ty?
Unhappy is the condition of that people
who, under the pain of damnation, must yield
passive obedience and non-resistance to a mo∣narch,
and yet have no better authority to di∣rect
their duty than such an award. It will
be said, that the merits of the cause were with
Baliol. But how the patrons of the divine
right of kings should come to a certainty in
this matter, I'm at a loss to understand. For
not to mention the pretensions of his competi∣tor
Bruce, it is perhaps not extremly clear that
a female has any divine right to a crown; at
least, there is no instance of this amongst the
Jews. And if females are admitted, I can∣not
see why the kingdom ought not to be split
amongst female heirs, as well as a private estate.
If right to a crown be considered as a matter
of property, there certainly ought to be no differ∣ence.
But laying aside all difficulties, and suppo∣sing
Baliol's right of primogeniture to be invin∣cibly
good, 'tis plain Robert Bruce could have
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
no divine right, nor can the Stuarts have a
divine right who derive their right from him.
It is but a mean subterfuge, that none of Ba∣liol's
race appear to claim the crown. Will
it be said, that this nation continued in an ob∣stinate
course of rebellion against the king of
heaven, so long as any of Baliol's race existed?
How do we know they do not at present exist?
It is our indispensible duty to search for the
king whom God has given us thro' every corner
of the earth. And 'tis equally our duty to re∣fuse
our obedience to an usurper; and he must be
so, who has not a hereditary right, and conse∣quently
is not of God's appointment. Let
us keep in view, that prescription, positive or
negative, can avail nothing, which has no other
foundation but universal consent, implied from
a long acquiescence.</P>
<P>THE asserters of this divine right dare not yield
that Baliol forfeited the crown of Scotland, by
acknowledging himself to be the king of Eng∣land's
vassal; for this would be justifying the late
revolution in every point. Making an indepen∣dent
kingdom a fief of another sovereignty, is
not more subversive of the constitution, than
the measures are which were pursued by James
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
VII. during the whole course of his reign. And
if the people of Scotland could lawfully judge
that Baliol had subverted the constitution, and
upon that judgment transfer the crown to
another, the people of Britain had the same
title to give judgment against James VII.
and to declare that he had forfeited the crown.</P>
<P>WITH regard to England, the pretext of a di∣vine
right is still more lame, if possible. William
the conqueror was a bastard, and could have
no divine right to the dukedom of Normandy;
nor did he himself pretend any other right to
the crown of England, than by the testament
of Edward the confessor. But supposing him
to have conquered England, which will not be
readily yielded, he certainly did not conquer
his Norman subjects who came over with him
to England, and from whom, for ought we
know, a great part of the nation are descended.
The Stuarts therefore who have no other
claim to the crown of England, but by a fe∣male
connection with the race of William the
conqueror, cannot, with any shadow of reason,
insist upon their beloved doctrine of a divine
right, so far as concerns the English, who are
of Norman extraction.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>
ON the whole, supposing the hereditary right
of kings to be the appointment of God, inde∣feasible
and indispensible, the following points
ought to be ascerained: 1. Whether this law
be universal, to take place over the whole earth,
or if it be limited to certain nations, and what
these nations are. 2. To what particular families
does this divine right belong, who are thus
made superior to the rest of mankind. 3. The
rules of succession, which concern these parti∣cular
families, ought to be distinct and perspi∣cuous,
so as to procure a perfect agreement a∣mongst
mankind, as about the primary laws of
nature. 4. These rules ought to be wrought
into our nature, and the transgression of them
attended with the strongest sense of immorality,
like treachery or murder. Were these points
thoroughly cleared, the scheme might be con∣sistent;
but as it stands, it is attended with
doubts and darkness, to lead every honest heart
who espouses it into endless perplexities.</P>
<P>MODERN histories are full of the evils occasion∣ed
by disputed successions; they are still fuller
of the evils occasioned by contests about the
king's prerogative. There can be no mode∣ration
in such controversies, where God Almigh∣ty
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
is made a party, and every person called
impious who takes the opposite side. Hereby
it comes, that this doctrine of the hereditary
indefeasible right of kings seldom fails to break
the peace of society, to foster inveterate enmities,
and to be the source of endless wars; of which,
were there no other evidence, the present times
afford a deplorable instance. So that, if we
are to give any parent to this doctrine other
than blind enthusiasm, we can never ascribe it
to a good being. And indeed if there is an
invisible power a greater enemy to mankind
than another, he could not possibly instil into
us a more poisonous principle. Plague and
famine are nothing to it.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' I have been deservedly severe upon
the doctrine, I would not be understood to
pass the same censure upon its votaries. I am
sensible the further removed a tenet is from
truth, the difficulty of conversion is propor∣tionally
great. 'Tis like love bestowed upon
an ugly woman, which is observed to be ever
without bounds. The Jacobites, such as are
not of a desperate fortune, certainly deserve
compassion, even while they are laying waste
their country by intestine commotions. They
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
can have no other motive but principle, when
they venture their lives and their fortunes
in the service of their idol prince, as their
prospect of success can never balance the ha∣zard.
What pity is it they were not employ∣ed
in a better cause. But if nothing else will
open their eyes, ought it not to have some
weight, that there is nothing more repugnant
to the laws which must govern all societies,
than for any single man, or set of men, to force
their opinion upon the majority. How would
they relish the behaviour of a member of their
own parliament, who should endeavour by
force of arms to oblige the whole body to sub∣mit
to his sentiment? Or how would they re∣lish
it, that a body of men should rise in arms
upon no better pretext than the procuring
justice to a friend whom they suppose to be
unjustly condemned by the whole body of judg∣es?
Is it not an excuse commonly given by
banditti for robbing on the highway, that they
are but making reprisals upon account of
goods unjustly wrested from them by authority
of law? Yet this is precisely the present case.
King James was set aside by the authority of the
nation, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the act of the majority, who from
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
the very nature of society, must be the ultimate
judges, in all matters which concern their pre∣servation
and well-being. Perhaps he was un∣justly
condemned. Be it so for argument's sake.
But an ultimate judgment must lie somewhere,
without further appeal. It must be a funda∣mental
law in all societies to aquiesce in this
ultimate judgment, right or wrong, without
which concord cannot be preserved but for a
moment. No honest remedy after this can
remain, but to desert the society and to join
some other, where the rules of justice are sup∣posed
to be better observed. Can it be thought
that the right of any man in a society, suppos∣ing
him to be a chief magistrate, trusted with
the greatest powers, is superior to the funda∣mental
laws of the society whence he derives
this right? It is an absurdity, the same as that
a part is greater than the whole. It were to
be wished, that gentlemen would seriously con∣sider
this matter, who are so strenuous for the
claim of an abdicated king, and who would
embroil heaven and earth to compass the re∣storation
of the family. And would they but
allow themselves to think with any degree of
coolness, they would soon be convinced, that
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
the peace of society is an object of greater im∣portance
than the right of any particular man
can be, supposing him to be descended from a
thousand kings.</P>
