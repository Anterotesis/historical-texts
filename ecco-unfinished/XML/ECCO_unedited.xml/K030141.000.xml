<HEAD>PROLOGUE. <HI>Spoken by</HI> Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<L>FOR wit's keen satire, and this laughing stage,</L>
<L>What theme so fruitful as a Bankrupt Age?</L>
<L>For not confin'd to commerce is the curse,</L>
<L>The head is near as empty as the purse;</L>
<L>Equally sunk, our credit and our wit,</L>
<L>Nor is the sage mere solvent than the cit;</L>
<L>All these—but soft, ere thus abroad we roam,</L>
<L>Were it not prudent first to look at home?</L>
<L>You, gentle Sirs, have giv'n me credit long,</L>
<L>And took my word for many an idle song;</L>
<L>But if exhausted, I give notes to-day,—</L>
<L>For wit and humour, which I cannot pay,</L>
<L>I must turn Bankrupt too, and hop away.</L>
<L>Unless indeed, I modishly apply,</L>
<L>For leave to sell my works by lottery.</L>
<L>Tho' few will favour, where's no cash to fee'em,</L>
<L>Poor hopes, that way to part with my Muscum:</L>
<L>My old friend, Smirk, indeed, may lend his aid,</L>
<L>And sell by auction all my stock in trade;</L>
<L>His placid features, and imploring eye,</L>
<L>May tempt perhaps the tardy town to buy;</L>
<L>His winning manner, and his soft address,</L>
<L>To other sales of mine have giv'n success;</L>
<L>But after all, my ever honour'd friends,</L>
<L>On you alone my fate this night depends;</L>
<L>I've fought some battles, gain'd some vict'rys here,</L>
<L>And little thought a culpript to appear</L>
<L>Before this house; but if resolv'd you go</L>
<L>To find me guilty, or to make me so,</L>
<L>To grant me neither wit, nor taste, nor sense,</L>
<L>Vain were my plea, and useless my defence.</L>
<L>But still, I will not steal, I will not beg,</L>
<L>Tho' I've a pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort in this wooden leg.</L>
<L>But to my cot contentedly retire,</L>
<L>And flew my cabbage by my only fire;</L>
<L>Mean time, great Sirs, my sentence yet unknown,</L>
<L>E'en as your Justice be your candor shewn,</L>
<L>And when you touch my honour, don't forget your own.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>THIS letter and casket, with my master's most respectful compliments, you will, Kitty, with your own fair hands, deliver to Miss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Casket is heavy—I suppose, Mr. Robin, this is what my Lady calls the Purryfunalia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>A small tribute, Madam, to adorn the bride on the happy occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, I suppose you look upon this mar∣riage as good as concluded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things are gone such a length, that not the least doubt can be made.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet between the cup and the lip,—you remember the proverb?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of the parties may die to be sure, other∣wise I don't know how—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: The young lady has not alter'd her mind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No to my knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir Robert Riscounter, her father? these curmudgeonly cits regard no ties, no obli∣gations when they have an higher interest in view. I suppose he has received larger proposals from some other party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard no such thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I am sure no impediment can arise from our quarter. My master, Sir James Bid∣dulph,
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
is too much a man of honour: besides, I know his whole soul is wrapt up in Miss Lydia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has given her pretty convincing proofs of his passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, I suppose the malicious mother-in-law, who, I know, hates Miss, and has a damn'd deal of art, in conjunction with Miss Lucy, that pre∣cious pledge of her former husband's affections, has contrived to throw some confounded rub in the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me, Mr. Robin, I don't know what you mean, I am sure I said nothing at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. But only that things which are not done, may perhaps never be done; there is nothing certain but death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very moral, Miss Kitty,—(there is some mis∣tery, if I could but get at it, but this slut is as cunning—I will have a trial, however) nay, for the matter of that, I can have, Mrs. Kitty, no interest at all in this match: there is so much confinement, and form, even in the most fashion∣able families, that a single service is best suited to me, especially too, that now I am got into most of the clubs: there is one circumstance I
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
shall most feelingly regret: That I own, will greatly touch me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, what may that be, Mr. Robin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not living under the same roof with Miss Kitty. I made no doubt, Madam, but your fortunes would follow your mistress's, and, in that case, I thought to soften the rigours of my captivity, in your agreeable converse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Mr. Robin? Well, I protest, I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when our mutual endeavours had pro∣cured for us a small independence, I flatter'd my∣self with gently sliding the down-hill of life, subject to no other will but Miss Kitty's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a difference between him, and the ser∣vants of this side the bar?—Really, Mr. Robin, you talk nearly as well as your master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And no wonder, Madam, since love, the same deity, inspires us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How quick you are in your rippartees, Mr. Robin? are you good at a riddle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean the making them, no; it is too low a species of writing for me; for novels I
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
have now and then some dealings with Noble, and have by me a genteel comedy of one act, that is thought to have a good deal of merit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Pray when does it make its appearance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, faith, I don't know, all the managers are such scribblers, that they won't give a genius fair play, but engross the whole stage to them∣selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very selfish, indeed. Well, Mr. Robin, though you won't make a riddle, I will, which, as my Lady expects me, you may study to expound by yourself. This match won't take place, and yet are none of the parties to blame; I may live in the same house with you, though I should leave my young Mistress's service, and the loss of my place may perhaps be the making of my fortune. So Adieu.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but Miss Kitty, one word, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a syllable, go, and puzzle your brains. But take this, for your comfort, that if you can∣not at present make out my meaning, a little time will fully explain it.<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So skittish and shy, Mrs. Pert! but if our next meeting don't bring forth this secret, you are no true chambermaid, nor I fit for a valet de chambre. All reserve amongst servants is flat
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
treason against the community. Every well-dis∣ciplin'd domestic is bound in honour, however careful of his own, to reveal all family secrets, to the rest of the tribe. But I must brush off, for here comes my Lady.<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Lady RISCOUNTER, <HI>and</HI> JAMES.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And he has promised that the paragraph shall appear in the paper this morning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, Madam, there is no doubt of his keeping his word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Afraid! what a pusillanimous creature art thou?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Ladyship, by what means I know not, is acquainted with my veneration for Miss, you can't wonder at my feeling some compunc∣tion, in becoming an instrument to ruin her fame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why the fellow is a fool: don't you consider, that her ruin, as you call it, will be your rise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so, Madam, but how can I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You love Lydia, you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than I have words to express.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Sir James Biddulph you detest, as a suc∣cessful rival, no doubt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except on that account, I have no reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what better reason can any man have? don't you know, that the two great master pas∣sions that give birth to all that we do, is hatred and love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mind would stagnate without them; and are not you particularly fortunate, in being able, by one masterly stroke, to gratify both?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I indeed sure of succeeding with Miss?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have every probable chance in your fa∣vour: in the first place, it is impossible, consist∣ently with his honour, that Sir James Biddulph can pursue his designs upon Lydia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor will any proper suitable person think of her when her reputation is gone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Too true, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, who so likely to succed as yourself? as you are the party suspected, common policy will point out you for her husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>But will Miss Lydia be brought to submit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>She can have no choice but her father's. Him, I can easily manage, and possibly, as a douceur, prevail on him to augment the very considerable fortune she derives from her aunt; never fear, things are in a very good way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must submit all to your ladyship's manage∣ment.</P>
</SP>

<P>Your part will be easy enough, you will have nothing to do but be passive.</P>

<P>Finely circumstantial, it is impossible for any body to err in the person.</P>

<SP>

<P>Don't be too forward in replying to any ques∣tion they put to you; but answer with a kind of

reluctant hesitation, as if the facts were forc'd from your mouth.</P>

<P>Never fear, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RESCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't forget to make frequent professions of the great love and affection you bear your young mistress, that you could not have thought it, shan't know whom to trust for the future; rea∣dy to lay down your life for your lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suggest too, that some strange arts must have been used, or you are convinc'd she could never have been brought to submit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall carefully, Madam, obey your direc∣tions.</P>

<SP>

<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or, if they won't come, rub your eyes till they are red.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RESCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right; this will give probability to all that you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Otherwise, the young hypocrite's behaviour has been always so specious, those who know her won't credit the story.</P>

<P>Suppose, Madam, Sir James Biddulph, or any body else, should make any enquiry.</P>

<P>That I most sufficiently feel.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a wonder, Madam, how have you got all this address: instead of a private family, you are form'd to govern a country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think, I may without vanity say, that I deriv'd from nature some talents for this kind of intrigue; but to the care of my educa∣tion I chiefly owe what I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father was a stock-broker, you know, and your father, my first husband, an attorney, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as they had no reserve, they kept no se∣crets from me, I must have been a blockhead, indeed, not to have made some progress in their professional arts.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after defeating Sir James Biddulph's de∣signs upon Lydia, to turn the tide of his affec∣tions, and substitute you in her room, will, Lu∣cy, be the great political effort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>From your ladyship's great abilities there can∣not be the least doubt of success: besides, her father is so hasty and violent that, I am sure, he will never be brought to forgive her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no relying on that; no mortal was ever so mutable. Our various climate is not so inconstant as he. Sir Robert is choleric enough, but then, as he is provoked without cause, he is appeased without reason; one word will inflame, another extinguish the fire; whom one minute he persecutes, the next he protects. His joy, grief, love, hatred, are in eternal rotation, and I have been often tempted to think his mind a machine, moved only by the immediate objects before it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Madam, how compleatly you rule him!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No longer, child, than I stay by his side; af∣ter that, the first person has him that sees him, and all my impressions are effac'd in an instant.</P>

<P>Ay, child; for instance now, Sir Thomas Perkins, our neighbour, finding that Miss Wil∣liams has a good parcel of land, which being contiguous to his estate, will be very proper for him to possess; immediately sends his rent-roll a-courting to her's. The parchments are pro∣duc'd on both sides, and no impediments, that is incumbrance appearing, a couple of lawyers marry the manors together.</P>

<P>Sir Robert, we shall be very happy to serve you, if you will tell us but how.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to deal plainly, gentlemen, my affairs are come to a crisis, and without some sustantial and speedy assistance, my credit will quickly ex∣pire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PILLAGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me: I never guess'd it in dan∣ger. Pray, Sir Robert, what brought on the disease, was it an alley fever, or a gradual decay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A complication of causes. Not but I could have weather'd them all, had the house in Hol∣land but stood, their failure must be followed by mine.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you heard any thing of him to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PILLAGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt, I believe, of their stopping; their bills were offer'd at Garraway's under forty per cent. As your name is not blown upon yet, sup∣pose you coin a couple of quires! don't you think the circulation might serve you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that mint is exhausted, and private pa∣per return'd to its primitive value. My real case

can be no longer conceal'd. I must stop, and should be glad of your advice how to manage the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PILLAGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are two methods in use. The choice will depend on how your affairs stand with the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bitter bad, Mr. Pillage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PILLAGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guess'd as much, by your sending for us. They treat us, Master Resource, like a couple of quacks, never apply but in desperate cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>RESOURCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in all diseases there are different degrees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PILLAGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; for instance, if you find you are pret∣ty near on a par, with perhaps a small balance per contra, summon your creditors, lay your con∣ditions fully before them, convince them you have a fund to answer all their demands, and crave a respite for three or four years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just to call in my debts, and make the most of my other effects?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>True; as the English merchants have a good deal of milk in their blood, that is a favour rarely refused.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, Master Pillage, will be only deferring the evil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PILLAGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, Sir Robert, as you manage the cards. Don't you see that the length of time, with the want or wish of ready money for trade, will dis∣pose the bulk of your creditors to sell their debts at a loss of thirty or forty per cent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>True.</P>
</SP>

<P>A fine fortune sav'd out of the fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That will swell my debts to a monstrous a∣mount.</P>

<P>Damn'd provoking however, to have our ship sunk just as we were entering the port; this could not happen but by the contrivance of some of the crew: our captain too is most horribly hurt. This jade, I am convinc'd, is in the whole of the plot; but her own art, and the skill of her prompter, will make it difficult to get at the bottom.</P>

<P>Bless me, Mr. Robin, after what has pass'd, I little expected to see you again at our house.</P>

<P>What injustice both to me and yourself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so, Mr. Robin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To your powerful attractions, and my proper discernment.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know I had any such things, Mr. Robin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Infinite! but above all your penetration is the most surprising to me. The conjuror in the Old Bailey is a fool compar'd to Miss Kitty. You are absolutely as knowing as one of the Civils, if the latter part of your prediction was but as fully accomplish'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't comprehend how that can happen.</P>

<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! why, to make your master amends for the loss of Miss Lydia, suppose we were to give him Miss Lucy—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>D'ye call that making my master amends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a good showy girl, and her fortune—</P>

<P>Will be no temptation to him, I know he de∣tests her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cordially. So that if that be the only means, I have nothing left but despair. Oh! Miss Kitty, think what misery! that tender frame has a tear for pity, I'm sure; to be deprived of the warmest wish of my life, to be cut off for ever—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you really think as you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose then, Mr. Robin, we were to live under our own roof, instead of that of another, don't you think it would be mending the mat∣ter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be Elysium, my angel. But how to get at the means?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that is your objection, they may be easily found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does my lovely Kitty think I can have any other?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then since that is the case, Mr. Robin, it is but right I should explain to you, what I meant, by my riddle, this morning. But see that we are safe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know, then, that this whole affair of Miss Lydia is my lady's contrivance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is that whole story a fiction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A mere flam; nothing else; and to bring about Sir James's marriage with Lucy, her mo∣tive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I conceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, as the project would not do without my assistance, my lady gave me (here it is, stuck in my stays) a note for five hundred pounds, if the match is broke off; and a thousand, should Miss Lucy's take place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum—hum—hum—500—hum—hum—Re∣becca Riscounter—it is just as you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Now, as matters stand, you see I am entitled to the first 500 directly, and, with your assist∣ance, perhaps the other may follow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not unlikely. But hold a little, dear Kitty, a little caution may not be amiss. This mistress of yours is a damn'd artful woman; she has trick'd others, and won't scruple cheating of you.</P>

<P>Then the business shall be blown up in an in∣stant.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what steps can we take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is an old master of mine, who lives in Brick-court in the Temple, as cunning a cur as ever hang'd an innocent man, or sav'd a rogue from the gallows. I'll run, and ask his opi∣nion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITTY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But won't that be betraying our secret?</P>

<P>No, no; enough for the present. It is, Plais∣ter, the proper timeing the subject, that gives success to our labours. The conductor of a News-paper, like a good cook, should always serve up things in their season: who eats oysters in June? Plays and Parliament Houses are winter provisions.</P>

<P>Do you? and what an ungrateful wretch must you be? you have been but a poor instrument only. But is it possible you, Lady Riscounter, could so entirely forget what you owe to me, and your—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, Sir Robert, you are so far prepossess'd, that all I can say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, Madam, what can be said for such—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, I am not going to make a formal defence, it is not worth my while, nor would you have leisure to hear it: if you will walk
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
down, you will find another sort of business, that demands your attention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The house fill'd with a new kind of customers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYDIA, Sir ROBERT, Sir JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only an extent, to seize on all his effects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYDIA, Sir ROBERT, Sir JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>The world will therefore see how ill I am treated—but don't imagine, Sir Robert, that the provision I derive from her father, shall be la∣vished to lessen your debts, or be employ'd in support of their author.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ladyship will have more prudence, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, child, we will quit this mansion directly, and leave him for consolation to the care of his daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYDIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A more precious trust, I could never receive. Your treachery to me, Madam, I could both despise and forgive: but your insolent triumph, at the distress of an unfortunate husband, gives
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
you a pre-eminence above the worst of your sex. If, Sir, what you are pleased to call mine, can either reinstate, or assist you, I beg it may be all employ'd in the service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, pr'ythee, Lydia—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYDIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, Sir James Biddulph, there are new obstables oppos'd to your purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean those her ladyship has been pleas∣ed to produce, they add only an additional strength to my wishes. The piety with which this great, this first duty is discharg'd, must ac∣company every other relation in life. I applaud, and shall be happy to join in your purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady RISCOUNTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Lucy, let us leave these romantick creatures together, they are only fit for each other; when your effects are convey'd to proper trustees, I shall take care to put in my claim.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfeeling, insolent woman; but thy good∣ness, Lydia, supplies every loss, nor will my cre∣ditors, when they find I never deceiv'd them, take advantage of thy filial affection.</P>

<SPEAKER>CLERK.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Dutch mail is arrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Any private letters from Holland?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your correspondents, Sir, have honour'd your bills.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And discharg'd them?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the report of their failing—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLERK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was without the smallest foundation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven be prais'd; now, Lydya, thy fa∣ther can look again with confidence in the face of his friends.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>LYDIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>A more real transport could never have reach'd me!</P>

<P>I know it, Lydia, I know it. This gentle∣man will both thank and reward you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me leave to join in the general joy. But what, Sir Robert, shall we do with this paper? I fancy my man is in waiting; Robin.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been of singular service to-day, which I shall take good care to acknowledge. The worth of this note, as the conditions have fail'd—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like many more of his kindred, is reduc'd to waste paper, your honour; but as this happy turn has been chiefly owing to Kitty, I hope she will be restor'd to favour again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JAMES.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, Robin, that was not her inten∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ROBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But recollect, Sir, the temptation—five hun∣dred pounds—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then the treachery—But as many of her
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
superiors, tho' perhaps not her betters, are daily detected in doing things more criminal for less consideration, it is some excuse, I confess. But what says my Lydia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LYDIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be directed by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And now, my children, nothing remains but the last act, to establish your union, and if (as I am resolved to disengage myself from that bad woman, and the cares of this world) you will suffer me to be a partaker of this domestic feli∣city—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JAMES, LYDIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot in any thing oblige us so much.</P>
