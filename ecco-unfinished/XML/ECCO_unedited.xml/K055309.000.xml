<P>THE HYPOCRITE: A COMEDY.</P>
<P>As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN DRURY-LANE.</P>
<P>Taken from MOLIERE and CIBBER, By the AUTHOR Of the ALTERATIONS of the PLAIN-DEALER.</P>

PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HAD any objections been made to this play, worth taking notice of, I should be un∣der no obligations to answer them, being ac∣countable for none of it's faults, as I lay claim to none of it's beauties. Cibber's Non-Juror (bor∣rowed from the Tartuffe of Moliere) has ever been reckoned an excellent comedy; but be∣ing written to expose a party, it was no longer interesting, because the folly and roguery it de∣sign'd to ridicule, no longer existed: It was thought, that it might be render'd agreeable to the present times, by once more having recourse to Moliere; and, with that view, I have endea∣vour'd to substitute his celebrated character of Tartuffe, in the room of Doctor Wolf.</P>
<P>Mr. Garrick determin'd to do this about two years ago; but, because the consequence of suc∣cess wou'd be a benefit easily gotten, he kindly put it into my hands, with some hints for the
<PB REF="4"/>
alteration. He did not think it was necessary to have any thing new, besides a short character for that entertaining comedian, Mr. Weston: Maw-worm therefore in this play is written by me, and scarce any thing more. For the rest, the character of Doctor Cantwell, as it here stands, is almost a verbal translation from Moliere, as old Lady Lambert is a counterpart of Madam Pernelle.</P>
<P>All the world knows, that the Tartuffe is reckon'd among the <HI>Chef des Oeuvres</HI> of the French Theatre; I may therefore presume with∣out any vanity, in spite of the ignorance and malevolence of little judges, that the man who takes two such plays as I have had to work upon, cou'd not, under the direction of Mr. Garrick, produce a very bad one; especi∣ally if he presum'd to foist in little or nothing of his own: And the remarkably kind reception the public have given to this Comedy, makes me believe they are well content with my humble endeavour to entertain them.</P>
<P>Gratitude, however, obliges me to take notice of the great assistance I have receiv'd from Mrs. Abington and Mr. King. The former, in the character of Charlotte, (Cibber's admirable Maria) is so excellent, that I cannot conceive it possible for any actress ever to have gone beyond
<PB REF="5"/>
her. There is a natural ease and vivacity in her manner, and, in this part particularly, a fashionable deportment (if I may use the ex∣pression) which gives a brilliancy to every thing she says, and has in a very uncommon manner, engaged the attention and applause of the town. The latter, in the part of the Hypocrite, has shewn that he is capable of assuming cha∣racters the most difficult, and at the same time the most opposite; and, by each new effort, to add to the esteem which the public appears to have for him.</P>

<HEAD>ACT I. SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>A hall in Sir <HI>JOHN LAMBERT</HI>'s house. Sir <HI>JOHN LAMBERT</HI> enters, followed by Colonel <HI>LAMBERT.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>PRAY, consider, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I do, Sir, that I am her Father, and will dispose of her as I please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not dispute your authority, Sir; but as I am your son too, I think it my duty to be concern'd for your honour. Have not you countenanc'd his addres∣ses to my sister? has not she received them?—Mr. Darnley's birth and fortune are well known to you, and, I dare swear, he may defy the world to lay a blemish on his character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, Sir, since I am to be catechiz'd, I must tell you, I do not like his character: he is a world∣server, a libertine, and has no more religion than you have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, we neither of us think it proper to make a boast of our religion; but, if you will please to en∣quire, you will find that we go to church as orderly as the rest of our neighbours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! you go to church! you go to church!—Wonderful! wonderful! to bow, and grin, and cough, and sleep: a fine act of devotion indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but dear Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, you are an atheist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir! I am none: it is a character I abhor; and, next to that, I abhor the character of an enthusiast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you do so; an enthusiast!—this is the fashion∣able phrase, the bye-word, the nick-name, that our pleasure-loving generation give to those few who have a sense of true sanctity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say, canting Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell you what, Son, as I have told you more than once, you will draw some heavy judgment on your head one day or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So says the charitable Doctor Cantwell: you have taken him into your house, and, in return, he gives over half your family to the devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not abuse the Doctor, Colonel; it is not the way to my favour. I know you cannot bear him, be∣cause he is not one of your mincing preachers.—He holds up the candle to your enormities, shews you to yourselves in your genuine colours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always respect piety and virtue, Sir; but there are pretenders to religion, as well as to courage: and as we never find the truly brave to be such as make much noise about their valour; so, I apprehend, the truly good seldom or ever deal much in grimace.—
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
To be candid, Sir, I make a distinction between hy∣pocrisy and devotion, and can never pay the same regard to the mask, that I would to the face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, Sir; this is very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Sir, I should be glad to know, by what authority the Doctor pretends to exercise the clerical function.—It does not appear clearly to me, that he ever was in orders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is no business of yours, Sir.—But I am better informed.—However, he has the call of zeal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zeal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Colonel, you are in a passion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own, I cannot see with temper, Sir, so many re∣ligious mountebanks impose on the unwary multi∣tude; wretches, who make a trade of religion, and shew an uncommon concern for the next world, only to raise their fortunes with greater security in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colonel, let me hear no more: I see you are too hardned to be converted now; but since you think it your duty, as a son, to be concerned for my errors; I think it as much mine, as a father, to be concerned for yours.—If you think fit to mend them so; if not, take the consequence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, may I ask you without offence, if the reasons you have given me are your only reasons, for discountenancing Mr. Darnley's addresses to my sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they not flagrant? would you have me marry my daughter to a Pagan?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="$" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He intends this morning paying his respects to you, in hopes to obtain your final consent, and de∣sir'd me to be present, as a mediator of articles be∣tween you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad to hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's kind, indeed, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be not, Sir; for I will not be at home when he comes; and because I will not tell a lie for the matter, I will go out this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, dear Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, do you hear, because I will not deceive him, either, tell him I would not have him lose his time in fooling after your sister—In short, I have another man in my head for her.</P>

<STAGE>Colonel <HI>LAMBERT,</HI> and then <HI>CHARLOTTE.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another man! it would be worth one's while to know him; pray heav'n this canting Hypocrite has not got some beggarly rascal in his eye for her.—I must rid the house of him at any rate, or all the settlement I can hope from my father, is a castle in the air,—my sister may be ruin'd too—Here she comes: if there be another man in the case, she, no doubt, can let me into the secret.—Sister, good morrow, I want to speak with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prythee then, dear brother, don't put on that wise politic face, as if your regiment was going to be dis∣banded, or sent to the West Indies, and you obliged to follow it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, a truce with your raillery; what I have to ask of you is serious, and I beg you would be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in your answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11" MS="y"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, provided it is not upon the subject of love, I will be so—but make haste too—for I have not had my tea yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is, and it is not, upon that subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I love a riddle dearly—Come—lets hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>—Nay, psha! if you will be serious, say so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lard, Sir; I beg your pardon—there—there's my whole form and features, totally disengag'd, and lifeless at your service; now, put them in what pos∣ture of attention you think sit.</P>
<STAGE>[Leaning against him awkwardly.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there ever such a giddy devil!—prythee stand up, I have been talking with my father, and he de∣clares positively, you shall not receive any further addresses from Mr. Darnley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you serious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said so this minute, and with some warmth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad on't with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! glad!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a degree. Do you think a man has any more charms for me for my father's liking him? No, Sir; if Mr. Darnley can make his way to me now, he is obliged to me only. Besides, now it may have the face of an amour indeed; now one has something to struggle for; there's difficulty, there's danger, there's the dear spirit of contradiction in it too: O! I like it mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad this does not make you think the worse of Darnley—but a father's consent might have clap't
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
a pair of horses more to your coach perhaps, and the want of it may pinch your fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Burn fortune; am not I a fine woman? and have not I ten thousand pounds in my own hands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sister; but, with all your charms, you have had them in your hands almost these four years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! and have not I had the full swing of my own airs and humours these four years? but if I humour my father, I warrant, he'll make it three or four thousand more, with some unlick'd lout: a com∣fortable equivalent, truly—No, no; let him light his pipe with his consent, if he please. Wilful against wise for a wager.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said; nothing goes to your heart, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; if I must have an ill match, I'll have the pleasure of playing my own game at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, sister, has my father ever propos'd any other man to you?</P>

<P>Another man! let me know why you ask, and I'll tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the last words he said to me were, that he had another man in his head for you.</P>

<P>And who is it? who is it? tell me, dear brother?</P>

<P>Why you don't so much as seem surpris'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No; but I'm impatient, and that's as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how now, sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="$" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sure, brother, you know very little of female happiness, if you suppose the surprise of a new lover ought to shock a woman of my temper—don't you know that I am a coquette?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are, you are the first that ever was sincere enough to own her being so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a lover, I grant you; but I make no more of you than a sister: I can say any thing to you.</P>
</SP>

<P>I should have been better pleas'd, if you had not own'd it to me—its a hateful character!</P>

<P>Ay, its no matter for that; it's violently pleasant▪ and there's no law against it, that I know of.</P>

<P>Darnley's like to have a hopeful time with you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; but don't you really know who it is my father intends me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, really; but I imagin'd you might, and there∣fore thought to advise with you about it.</P>

<P>Nay, he has not open'd his lips to me yet—are you sure he's gone out?</P>

<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very impatient to know, methinks; what have you to do to concern yourself about any man but Darnley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O lud! O lud! Prythee, brother, don't be so wise; if you had an empty house to let, would you be dis∣pleased to hear there were two people about it? Be∣sides, to be a little serious: Darnley has a tincture of jealousy in his temper, which nothing but a substan∣tial rival can cure.</P>

<P>Alas, Madam!

<P>None, Madam, that, perhaps, humanity may call very enormous; yet am I sure, that my thoughts never stray a moment from celestial contemplations; do they not sometimes, before I am aware, turn to things of this earth? am I not often hasty, and surpris'd into wrath? nay, the instance is recent; for, last night, being snarled at, and bit by Minxy, your daughter-in-law's lap-dog, I am conscious I struck the little beast with a degree of passion, for which I have never been able to forgive myself since.</P>

For so extravagant is this settlement, that it leaves her not a shilling, unless she marries with the Doctor's con∣sent, which is intended by what I have heard, as an expedient to oblige her to marry the Doctor himself. Now, 'twere but an honest part to let Charlotte know the snare that's laid for her: This deed's not sign'd, and may be yet prevented.—It shall be so.—Yes, charm∣ing creature!—I adore you!—And tho' I am sensible that my passion is without hope, I may indulge it thus far, at least; I may have the merit of serving you, and perhaps the pleasure to know you think yourself oblig'd by me.</P>

<P>Frolicksome! Why you sensual ideot, what have frolicks to do with solid happiness?

<P>Lord, Sir, how you talk! you don't consider peo∣ple's tempers.

<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O horrible! flirtation! My poor sister has ruin'd her; leaving a fortune in her own hands, has turn'd her brain. In short, Charlotte, your sentiments of life are shameful, and I am resolv'd upon your instant re∣formation; therefore, as an earnest of your obedience, I shall first insist that you never see young Darnley more; for, in one word, the good and pious Doctor Cantwell's the man that I have decreed your husband.</P>

<P>Come, come; I wish you would follow his pre∣cepts, whose practice is conformable to what he teaches.—Virtuous man!—Above all sensual regards, he considers the world merely as a collection of dirt and pebble-stones.—How has he wean'd me from tem∣poral connections!

I conwicted a man of five oaths, as last Thursday was a se'nnight, at the Pewter-platter in the Bo∣rough; and another of three, while he was playing trap-ball in St. George's Fields: I bought this waistcoat out of my share of the money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, how do you mind your business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAW-WORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have lost almost all our customers; because I keeps extorting them whenever they come into the shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAW-WORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better than ever we did: while we were worldly∣minded, my wife and I (for I am married to as likely a woman as you shall see in a thousand) could hardly make things do at all; but since this good man has brought us into the road of the righteous, we have
<PB N="38" REF="44"/>
always plenty of every thing; and my wife goes as well-dress'd as a gentlewoman—we have had a child too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Merciful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAW-WORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And between <HI>you</HI> and <HI>me,</HI> Doctor, I believe Susy's breeding again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus it is, Madam; I am constantly told, tho' I can hardly believe it, a blessing follows, wherever I come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MAW-WORM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, if you would hear how the neighbours reviles my wife; saying, as how she sets no store by me, because we have words now and then; but, as I says, if such was the case, would ever she have cut me down that there time, as I was melancholy, and she found me hanging behind the door; I don't believe there's a wife in the parish would have done so by her husband.</P>
</SP>

<P>Occasion for them this afternoon! then there's no time to be lost; the coast is clear, and this is her chamber—what's the matter with me—the thought of speaking to her throws me into a disorder—there's no body within, I believe; I'll knock again—Is your Lady busy.</P>

<P>O, your servant, Mr. Seyward—here, take this odious Homer, and lay him up again, he tires me; how could the blind wretch make such an horrid fuss about a fine woman, for so many volumes together,

<P>Why; what's the matter?</P>

<P>Oh, I love melancholy stories of all things▪ pray, how long have you liv'd with your uncle, Mr. Sey∣ward?</P>

<P>He's no uncle of mine, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprise me! not your uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; but that's not the only character the Doctor assumes, to which he has no right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! I am concern'd for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would, Madam, if you knew all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="48"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am already; but if there are any further particu∣lars of your story, pray let me hear them; and should any services be in my power, I am sure you may com∣mand them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>My father, Madam, was the younger branch of a genteel family in the North, his name Trueman—but dying, while I was yet in my infancy, I was left wholly dependent on my mother—a woman really pious and well meaning, but.—In short, Madam, Doctor Cantwell fatally got acquainted with her, and, as he is now your father's bosom counsellor, soon became hers; for his hypocrisy had so great an effect on her weak spirit, that he entirely led and manag'd her at his pleasure.—She died, Madam, when I was but eight years old; and then I was, indeed, left an orphan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor creature!—Lord! I cannot bear it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>She left Doctor Cantwell her sole heir and execu∣tor—but I must do her the justice to say, I believe it was in the confirmation, that he would take care of, and do justice to me; who, young as I was, I yet remember to have heard her recommend to him, on her death-bed; and, indeed, he has so far taken care of me, that he sent me to a seminary abroad; and for these three years last past; has kept me with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! heavens! but, why have you not strove to do yourself justice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thrown so young into his power, as I was—un∣known and friendless, but thro' his means; to whom could I apply for succour?—Nay, Madam, I will confess, that, on my return to England, I was, at first, tainted with his enthusiastic notions myself; and, for some time, as much impos'd upon by him, as others; till, by degrees, as he found it necessary to make use
<PB N="43" REF="49"/>
of, or totally discard me (which last he did not think prudent to do), he was obliged to unveil himself to me, in his proper colours—And, I believe, I can inform you of some parts of his private character, that may be the means of detecting one of the wickedest impostors that ever practis'd upon credulity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how has the wretch dared to treat you?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>In his ill and insolent humours, Madam, he has sometimes the presumption to tell me, that I am the object of his charity; and, I own, Madam, that I am humbled, in my own opinion, by his having drawn me into a connivance at some actions, which I can't look back on without horror!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you can't tell how I pity you, and depend upon it, if it be possible to serve you, by getting you out of the clutches of this monster, I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Once more, Madam, let me assure you, that your generous inclination would be a consolation to me in the worst misfortunes; and, even in the last moment of painful death, would give my heart a joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! the poor unfortunate boy loves me too—what shall I do with him—pray, Mr. Seyward, what paper's that you have got in your hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another instance of the conscience, and gratitude, which animates our worthy Doctor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You frighten me! pray, what is the purport of it? It is neither sign'd nor seal'd:</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam; therefore▪ to prevent it, by this time∣ly notice, was my business here with you: your fa∣ther gave it the Doctor first, to shew his council, who, having approved it, I understand, this evening it will be executed.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="50"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>It grants to Doctor Cantwell, in present, four hun∣dred pounds per Annum, of which, this very house is part; and, at your father's death, invests him in the whole remainder of his freehold estate.—For you, indeed, there is a charge of four thousand pounds upon it, provided you marry with the Doctor's con∣sent; if not, 'tis added to my Lady's jointure; but your brother, Madam, is, without conditions, utterly disinherited.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am confounded!—what will become of us? my father now I find, was serious—O, this insinuating Hypocrite—let me see—ay—I will go this minute.—Sir, dare you trust this in my hands for an hour only.</P>

<P>I don't say that, neither; perhaps, I am in the wrong, in what I have said; but I have been so often used to ask pardon for your being in the wrong, that I am resolv'd henceforth never to rely on the insolent evidence of my own senses.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it a crime to be concern'd for what becomes of you? has not your father openly declar'd against me, in favour of another? how is it possible, at such a time, not to have a thousand fears? what? tho' they are all false and groundless, are they not still the effect of love, alarmed, and anxious to be satisfied? I have an heart that cannot bear disguises; but when 'tis griev'd, in spite of me, will shew it—pray pardon me—but when I am told you went out in the utmost hurry with some writings to a lawyer, and took the Doctor's nephew with you; ev'n in the very hour your father had propos'd him as an husband; what am I to think? can I? must I suppose my senses fail me? if I have eyes, have ears, and have an heart, must it be still a crime to think I see and hear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own, it looks ill-natur'd now, not to shew him some concern—but then, this jealousy—I must, and will get the better of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speak, Charlotte; is still my jealousy a crime?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you still insist on't, as a proof of love, then I must tell you, Sir, 'tis of that kind that only slighted hearts are pleas'd with. The fact you charge me
<PB N="49" REF="55"/>
with, is true; I have been abroad; but let appearan∣ces be ever so strong, while there is a possibility, that what I have done may be innocent, I won't bear a look that tells me to my face, you dare suspect me. If you have doubts, why don't you satisfy them before you see me? Can you suppose I am to stand confound∣ed, like a criminal before you? Come, come, there's nothing shews so low a mind, as those grave and in∣solent jealousies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, Madam, mine you won't find so low as you imagine; and, since I see your tyranny arises from your mean opinion of me, 'tis time to be myself, and disavow your power; you use it now beyond my bear∣ing; not only impose on me, to disbelieve my senses, but do it with such an imperious air, as if my manly reason were your slave; and this despicable frame that follows you, durst shew no signs of life but what you vouchsafe to give it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the right:—go on—suspect me still—believe the worst you can—'tis all true—I don't jus∣tify myself.—Why do you trouble me with your complaints? if you are master of that manly reason you have boasted, give me a manly proof of it▪ at once resume your liberty; despise me; go off in triumph now; and let me see you scorn the woman, whose overbearing falsehood would insult your senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the end of all then? and, are those tender protestations you have made me (for such I thought them), when, with a kind reluctance, you gave me something more than hope?—what all?—O, Char∣lotte!—all come to this!</P>

You must know, Charlotte, Sir John has been pressing me to speak to you, in his favour, and has desir'd me to hear what the Doctor had to say upon that subject; but must I play a traiterous part now, and instead of per∣suading you to the Doctor, persuade the Doctor a∣gainst you?</P>

<P>But our business, Sir, is upon another subject: Sir John informs me, that he thinks himself under no obligations to Mr. Darnley, and therefore resolves to give his Daughter to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such a thing has been mention'd, Madam; but, to deal sincerely with you, that is not the happiness I sigh after; there is a soft and serious excellence for me, very different from what your step-daughter possesses.</P>

<P>Well, Sir, pray be sincere, and open your heart to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Open my heart! can you then, sweet Lady, be yet a stranger to it? Has no action of my life been able to inform you of my real thoughts? I hope you imagine not that it was from ill-will, or on any account but yours, that I urg'd Sir John to restrain your assem∣blies and visits: No, blessed creature!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. Seyward, whether it succeeds to our ends or not, we have still the same obligations to you. You saw with what a friendly warmth my brother heard your story, and I don't in the least doubt his being able to do something for you.</P>

<P>Have you never suspected, that in all this affair, I have had some secret stronger motive, than barely duty?</P>

<P>Not at all, it loses you no merit with me; nor is it in my nature to use any one ill that loves me, unless

I lov'd that one again; then, indeed, there might be danger.—Come, don't look grave; my inclinations to another shall not hinder me paying every one what's due to their merit; I shall, therefore, always think myself obliged to treat your misfortunes, and your modesty, with the utmost tenderness.</P>

<SPEAKER>SEYWARD.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it then possible you can have lov'd another, to whom you never were sincere?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! you are but a novice in the passion. Sincerity is a dangerous virtue, and often surfeits what it ought to nourish. Therefore I take more pains to make the man I love believe I slight him, than (if possible) I would to convince you of my esteem and friendship. Nay, I'll do more still; I'll shew you all the good-na∣ture you can desire; you shall make what love to me you please; but then I'll tell you the consequence; I shall certainly be pleas'd with it, and that will flatter you, till I do you a mischief. Now do you think me sincere?</P>

<P>Ay; but the more I give it you, the better you'll think of me still; and then I must think the better of you again, and then you the better of me, upon that too; and so at last I shall think seriously, and you'll begin to think ill of me.

<P>Doctor Cantwell desires to be admitted, Madam.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him come in.—Your servant, Sir.—Give us chairs, Betty, and leave the room▪—Sir, there's a seat.—What can the ugly cur say to me! he seems a little puzzled. <STAGE>(Humming a tune).</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye', young lady, I am afraid, notwithstanding your good father's favour, I am not the man you would desire to be alone with upon this occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your modesty is pleas'd to be in the right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid, notwithstanding all my endeavours to the contrary, that you entertain a bad opinion of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="65" REF="71"/>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A worse, Sir, of no mortal breathing!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which opinion is immoveable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No rock so firm!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid, then, it will be a vain pursuit, when I sollicit you, in compliance with my worthy friend's de∣sire, and my own inclinations, to become my partner, in that blessed estate, in which we might be a comfort and support to each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would die, rather than consent to it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>In other words, you hate me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most transcendantly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! there is sincerity at least in your confession: you are not, I see, totally depriv'd of all virtue; tho', I must say, I never could perceive in you but very little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, fy! you flatter me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I speak it with sorrow! because you are the daughter of my best friend. But how are we to proceed now; are we to preserve temper?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! never fear me, Sir! I shall not fly out, being convinced, that nothing gives so sharp a point to one's aversion, as good breeding; as, on the contrary, ill manners often hides a secret inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, young lady, be assured, so far am I from the unchristian disposition of returning injuries, that your antipathy to me causes no hatred in my soul towards you; on the contrary, I would willingly make
<PB N="66" REF="72"/>
you happy, if it may be done, according to my con∣science, with the interest of heaven in view.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I can't see, Sir, how heaven can be any way concern'd in a t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ansaction between you and me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>When you marry any other person, my consent is necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I hear, indeed! but pray, Doctor, how could your modesty receive so insolent a power, without put∣ting my poor father out of countenance with your blushes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I sought it not; but he would croud it in among other obligations. He is good-natur'd; and I foresaw it might serve to pious purposes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take it for granted, that you would marry Mr. Darnley. Am I right?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Once in your life, perhaps you may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, let us be plain. Would you marry him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You're mighty nice, methinks. Well, I would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will not consent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You won't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>My conscience will not suffer me. I know you to be both luxurious and worldly-minded; and you would squander upon the vanities of the world, those treasures which ought to be better laid out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum!—I believe I begin to conceive you.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="73"/>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you can think of any project to satisfy my con∣science, I am tractable. You know there is a consi∣derable moiety of your fortune, which goes to my Lady, in case of our disagreement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's enough, Sir.—You think we should have a fellow-feeling in it. At what sum do you rate your concurrence to my inclinations? that settled, I am willing to strike the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you think of half?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! two thousand pounds!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know you gain two thousand pounds; and really the severity of the times for the poor, and my own stinted pittance, which cramps my charities, will not suffer me to require less.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how is my father to be brought into this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Leave that to my management.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what security do you expect for the money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Mr. Darnley is wealthy: when I deliver my consent in writing, he shall lay it me down in bank bills.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>On one proviso tho'.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Name it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you immediately tell my father, that you are willing to give up your interest to Mr. Darnley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum!—stay,—I agree to it; but in the mean time, let me warn you, child, not to expect to turn that, or what has now passed between us, to my confusion, by sinis∣ter
<PB N="68" REF="74"/>
constructions, or evil representations to your father▪ I am satisfied of the piety of my own intentions, and care not what the wicked think of them; but force me not to take advantage of Sir John's good opinion of me, in order to shield myself from the consequences of your malice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I shall not stand in my own light: I know your conscience and your power too well, dear Doctor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let your Interest sway you. Thank heaven, I am actuated by more worthy motives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt on't.</P>

<P>Charlotte!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may come in. Well, I hope you bring me a good account of the Doctor.—What success?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>All I could wish!—Seyward has given so strong and so fair a detail of his frauds and villainies of every kind, that my Lord Chief Justice made not the least hesita∣tion to grant his warrant; and I have a tipstaff at the next door, when I give the word, to take him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should not you do it immediately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a little patience; I have a farther design in my head.—But pray, Sister, what secret's this, that you

have yet behind in those writings that Seyward brought you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! that's what I can't tell you.—But, by the way, what have you done with Darnley? why is not he here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Colonel LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been here; but you must excuse him.—I told him how anxious you were about Seyward's affair, and he has taken him with him, in his own coach, to the Attorney General's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own he has gain'd upon me by this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I am glad to hear that at last. But I must go and let my Lady know what progress we have made in the Doctor's business; because I have something particular to say to her.</P>

<P>To find you thus alone, Madam, is an happiness I did not expect, from the temper of our last parting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have been as well pleas'd now, to have been thank'd, as reproach'd, for my good-nature; but you will be in the right, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, you take me wrong. I literally mean't, that I was afraid you wou'd not so soon think I had deserv'd this favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, one of us has been in the wrong, at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="76"/>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas I, I own it;—more is not in my power: all the amends possible I have made you: my very joy of seeing you has waited; till what you had at heart, un∣ask'd, was perfected for a rival, whom you had so just∣ly compassionated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! but why would you say unask'd now? don't you consider your doing it so, is half the merit of the action?—Lord! you have no art; you should have left me to have taken notice of that. Only imagine, now, how kind and handsome an acknowledgment you have rob'd me of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet how artfully you have paid it. With what a wanton charming ease you play upon my tenderness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but were not you silly now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come,—you shall not be serious;—you can't be more agreeable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! but I am serious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'll be so.—Do you forgive me all?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are we friends, Charlotte?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord! but you've told me nothing of poor Sey∣ward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must you needs know that, before you answer me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Psha! I won't pull off my glove; not I.</P>

<P>I'll take it as it is then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! there, there; eat it, eat it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so I could, by heaven!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, my glove! my glove! my glove! you are in a perfect storm! Lord! if you make such a rout with one's hand only; what wou'd you do if you had one's heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's impossible to tell.—But you were asking me of Seyward, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, ay! that's true. Well, now you are good again.—Come, tell me all that affair, and then you shall see—how I will like you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! that I could thus play with inclination!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! but you don't tell me now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not much to tell;—only this: We met the Attorney General, to whom he has given a very sensi∣ble account of himself, and the Doctor's proceedings.—But, still more fortunate! there happen'd to be a gen∣tleman present, who came from the same part of the country with Seyward, and is well acquainted with his family; and even remembers the circumstance of his mother's death; who promises to be speedy and diligent in his enquiries.—We have been at the Commons to search for her will, but none has been enter'd.—But, as it can be prov'd, she died possessed of eight or ten thousand pounds, the Attorney General seems very clear in his opinion, that, as the Doctor, at the time of the death of Seyward's mother, was intrusted with
<PB N="72" REF="78" MS="y"/>
her whole affairs, the court of Equity will oblige him to be accountable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Seyward does not recover his fortune, you must absolutely get him a Commission, and bring him into acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my word, I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And shew him to all the women of taste; and I'll have you call him my pretty fellow, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will, indeed!—but hear me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You can't conceive, how prettily he makes love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not so well as you make your defence, Charlotte.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! I had forgot, he is to teach me Greek, too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DARNLEY.</SPEAKER>

<P>Now, I understand you. But since you will have me touch every thing so very tenderly, Charlotte, how shall I find proper words to ask you the lover's last necessary question.</P>

<P>O! there's a thousand points to be adjusted, before that's answer'd.</P>

<SP>

<P>So I will; for I will make you do more of your's in two minutes, than you wou'd have done without me in a twelvemonth. Why, how now! do you think the man's to dangle after your ridiculous airs for ever?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, pray, Madam, when your tea's ready, what have you to do but to drink it?—but you, I suppose, expect a lover's heart, like your lamp, should be always flaming at your elbow; and when it's ready to go out, you indolently supply it with the spirit of contradiction.</P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you suppose, that your assurance has made an end of this matter?</P>

<P>It's a very proper caution. Come along, Darnley: nay, you must leave her now, whatever violence you do yourself.</P>

<P>Sir, I'll be plain with you—I went out to avoid you; but where the welfare of a child is concern'd, you must not take it ill if we don't stand upon cere∣mony—However, since I have reason now to be more in temper than perhaps I was at that time, I should be glad to talk with you.</P>

<P>I appeal to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I appeal even to yourself, Sir—Has not the Doctor, just now, in the garden, spoke in favour of Mr. Darnley to you? Nay, pray, Sir, be plain; because more depends on that, than you can easily imagine or believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What senseless insinuation have you got into your head now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be so kind, Sir, first to answer me, that I may be better able to inform you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I own he has declin'd his interest in favour of Mr. Darnley; but I must tell you, Madam, he did it in so modest, so friendly, so good-natur'd, so conscien∣tious a manner, that I now think myself more than ever bound in honour to espouse him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>But now, Sir, (only for argument's sake) Suppose I could prove that all this seeming virtue was artificial; that his regard for Mr. Darnley was neither founded upon modesty, friendship, good-nature, nor con∣science: or, in short, that he has, like a villain, bar∣ter'd, bargain'd, to give me to Mr. Darnley, for half the four thousand pounds you valued his consent at.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impious to suppose it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Sir, from what principle must you suppose that I accuse him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>From an obstinate prejudice to all that's good and virtuous.</P>
</SP>

<P>That's too hard, Sir. But, the worst your opi∣nion can provoke me to, is to marry Mr. Darnley, without either his consent or yours.</P>

<P>What do you brave me, Madam?</P>

<P>Indeed, my dear, I fear it is. Give me leave to ask you one question. In all our mutual course of hap∣piness, have I ever yet deceived you with a falshood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Would you then believe me, should I accuse him even of crimes which virtue blushes but to mention?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what extravagance would you drive me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would before have undeceiv'd you, when his late artifice turned the honest duty of your son into his own reproach and ruin; but knowing then your temper was inaccessible, I durst not offer it.—But suppose I should be able to let you see his villainy, make him re∣peat his odious love to me in your own hearing, at once throw off the mask, and shew the barefac'd tray∣tor.</P>

<P>Madam, your woman tells me, that being here, and alone, you desir'd to speak with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir—but, that we may be sure we are alone, pray shut the outward door, and see that passage be clear too—another surprize might ruin us—is all safe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have taken care, Madam.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am afraid I interrupt your meditations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, Madam, no; I was only looking over some pious exhortations here, for the use of a society of chosen brethren.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Doctor! what have you done to me? the trouble of my mind, since our last unfortunate conference, is not to be express'd. You, indeed, discovered to me, what perhaps, for my own peace, 'twere better I had never been acquainted with; but I had not sufficient time to lay my heart open to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="88"/>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whither, Madam, would you lead me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been uneasy too, not knowing how far you might mistake my behaviour on the last accident that happen'd; but I was really so shock'd, so terrified, I knew not what I was doing: only had I join'd in your defence against the Colonel, it would have been evi∣dent I was his enemy, and I have uses for his friend∣ship. Silence, therefore, was my only prudent part; and I knew your credit with Sir John needed no sup∣port.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me presume then to hope, that what I did, you judge was self-defence, and pure necessity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, perhaps, after all, the accident was lucky; for Sir John, in order to obviate any ill constructions that may be put upon it, insists now that we should be more together, to let the world see his confidence in us both. This relieves us from restraint, and I now dare tell you—but no—I won't—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why, Madam? let me beseech you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—besides—what need you ask me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! do not endeavour to decoy my foolish heart, too apt to flatter itself. You cannot, sure, think kindly of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; I would have you imagine so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Doctor CANTWELL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, may I not with reason suspect, that this ap∣parent goodness is but artifice, a shadow of compliance, meant only to persuade me from your daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>

</SP>

<P>Mere artifice. You knew that modest resignation would make Sir John warmer in your interest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, indeed, indeed. I had other motives, which you may hereafter be made acquainted with, and will con∣vince you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, Sir; now I'll give you leave to guess the rea∣son why, at our last meeting, I press'd you so warmly to resign Charlotte.</P>

<P>In short, gentlemen, the affair is circumstantially this—The Doctor called me out into the pavilion in the garden; appear'd in great disorder; told me there was a sudden storm raised, which he was not sufficient∣ly prepared to weather.

He talked confusedly a∣bout giving value for an estate, but I boldly refused to perjure myself; and told him, on the contrary, I was satisfied he had fleeced Sir John of several large sums, under pretence of charitable uses, which he secretly converted to his own.—This stung him—and he fast∣ened at my throat. Then, indeed, all temper left me; and, disengaging myself from his hold, with a home∣blow, struck him down. At this, grown desperate, he ran with fury to some pistols that hung above the chim∣ney; but in the instant he reach'd one, I seiz'd upon his wrist; and as we grappled, the pistol firing to the cieling, alarm'd the family.</P>

<P>O, my child▪ for my deliverance, I can only re∣ward you here.—For you, my son, whose filial virtue I have injur'd; this honest deed, in every article, shall be ratified.—And, for the sake of that hypocritical villain! I declare, that from henceforward I renounce all pious folks; I will have an utter abhorrence for every thing that bears the appearance—</P>

<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>

Guard, if possible, against doing honour to hypocrisy.—But, at the same time, let us allow there is no character in life, greater or more valuable, than that of the truly de∣vout,—nor any thing more noble, or more beautiful, than the fervour of a sincere piety.</P>
