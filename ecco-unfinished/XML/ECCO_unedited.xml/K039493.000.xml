<P>Why, I come, Sir Jacob, partly to enquire after your health; and partly, as I may say, to settle the business of the day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your worship knoweth, this being the day of election, the rabble may be riotous; in which case, maims, bruises, contusions, dislocations, fractures, simple and compound, may likely ensue; now your worship need not be told, that I am not on∣ly a pharmacopolist, or vender of drugs; but likewise chirurgeon, or healer of wounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, master Lint, and equally skilful in both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>It is your worship's pleasure to say so, Sir Jacob: Is it your worship's will that I lend a ministring hand to the maim'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>By all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And to whom must I bring in my bill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, the vestry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your worship knows, that kill or cure, I have contracted to physic the parish-poor by the great: But this must be a se∣parate charge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; all under one; come, master Lint, don't be unreasonable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir Jacob, I can hardly af∣ford it. What with the dearness of drugs, and the number of patients the peace has procured me, I can't get salt to my por∣ridge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Bad this year, the better the next—We must take things rough and smooth as they run.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I have a very hard bar∣gain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No such matter; we are, neigh∣bour Lint, a little better instructed. For∣merly indeed, a fit of illness was very ex∣pensive; but now, physic is cheaper than food.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lint.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, heaven forbid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, your essences, elixirs, emetics, sweats, drops, and your pastes, and your pills, have silenced your pestles and mortars. Why a fever, that would former∣ly have cost you a fortune, you may now cure for twelve pennorth of powder.</P>

<P>I could have wish'd you had come a little sooner, Major Sturgeon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what has been the matter, Sir Jacob?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jacob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There has, Major, been here an impudent pill-monger, who has dar'd to scandalize the whole body of the bench.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Insolent companion! had I been here, I would have mittimus'd the rascal at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, he wanted the Major more than the magistrate; a few smart strokes from your cane would have fully an∣swer'd the purpose.—Well, Major, our wars are done; the rattling drum, and squeaking fife, now wound our ears no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir Jacob, our corps is dis∣embodied, so the French may sleep in se∣curity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But, Major, was it not rather late in life for you, to enter upon the profes∣sion of arms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A little aukward in the begin∣ning, Sir Jacob: The great difficulty they had was, to get me to turn out my toes; but use, use reconciles all them kind of things: Why, after my first campaign, I no more minded the noise of the guns than a flea-bite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No. There is more made of these matters than they merit. For the ge∣neral good indeed, I am glad of the peace; but as to my single self——And yet, we have had some desperate duty, Sir Jacob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! such marchings and coun∣ter-marchings from Brentford to Elin, from Elin to Acton, from Acton to Uxbridge: The dust flying, sun scorching, men sweat∣ting—Why, there was our last expedition to Hounslow, that day's work carried off Major Molossas. Bunhill-fields never saw a braver commander. He was an irreparable loss to the service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How came that about?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was partly the Major's own fault; I advised him to pull off his spurs before he went upon action; but he was resolute, and would not be rul'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit; zeal for the service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless—But to proceed: In order to get our men in good spirits, we were quarter'd at Thistleworth the evening before; at day-break, our regiment form'd at Hounslow town's-end, as it might be about here. The Major made a fine disposi∣tion: On we marched, the men all in high spirits, to attack the gibbet where Gardel is hanging; but turning down a narrow lane to the left, as it might be about there, in order to possess a pig's-stye, that we might take the gallows in flank, and, at all events, secure a retreat; who should come by but a drove of fat oxen for Smithfield. The drums beat in the front, the dogs bark'd in the rear, the oxen set up a gallop; on they came thundering upon us; broke through our ranks in an instant, and threw the whole corps in confusi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Terrible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Major's horse took to his heels, away he scour'd over the heath. That gallant commander stuck both his spurs into the flank, and for some time held by his mane; but in crossing a ditch, the horse threw up his head, gave the Major a dowse in the chops, and plump'd him into a gravel-pit, just by the powder-mills.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dreadful!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Whether from the fall or the fright, the Major mov'd off in a month— Indeed it was an unfortunate day for us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as Captain Cucumber, Lieutenant Patty-Pan, Ensign Tripe, and myself, were returning to town in the Turnham-Green stage, we were stop'd near the Hammersmith turnpike, and rob'd and stripp'd by a footpad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An unfortunate day indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But in some measure to make me amends, I got the Major's commission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>O yes. I was the only one of the corps that could ride; otherwise, we al∣ways succeeded of course: No jumping over heads; no underhand work among us; all men of honour; and I must do the regi∣ment the justice to say, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re never was a set of more amiable officers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Quiet and peaceable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As lambs, Sir Jacob, (excepting one boxing-bout at the Three-Compasses in Acton, between Captain Sheers and the Colonel, concerning a game at All-fours) I don't remember a single dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir John.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that was mere mutiny; the Captain ought to have been broke.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He was; for the Colonel not on∣ly took away his cockade, but his custom;
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
and I dont think poor Captain Sheers has done a stitch for him since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But you soon supplied the loss of Molossas?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In part only; no, Sir Jacob, he had great experience; he was train'd up to arms from his youth: At sixteen he trail'd a pike in the Artillery-ground; at eighteen got a company in the Smithfield pioneers; and by the time he was twenty, was made aid-de-camp to Sir Jeffery Grub, Knight, Alderman, and Colonel of the Yellow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A rapid rise!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he had a genius for war; but what I wanted in practice, I made up by doubling my diligence. Our porter at home had been a serjeant of marines; so af∣ter shop was shut up at night, he us'd to teach me my exercise; and he had not to deal with a dunce, Sir Jacob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your progress was great.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Amazing. In a week I could shoulder, and rest, and poize, and turn to the right, and wheel to the left; and in less than a month, I could fire without winking or blinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A perfect Hannibal!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, and then I learnt to form lines, and hollows, and squares, and evolu∣tions, and revolutions; let me tell you, Sir Jacob, it was lucky that Monsieur kept his
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
mirmidons at home, or we should have pep∣per'd his flat-bottom'd boats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, marry, he had a marvellous escape.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We would a taught him what a Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton can do who is fighting <HI>pro arvis</HI> and <HI>focus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Pray now, Major, which do you look upon as the best disciplin'd troops, the London regiments, or the Middlesex militia?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir Jacob, it does not be∣come to me say; but lack-a-day, they have never seen any service—Holiday soldiers; why, I don't believe, unless indeed upon a lord-mayor's day, and that mere matter of accident, that they were ever wet to the skin in their lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No! soldiers for sun-shine, Cock∣neys; they have not the appearance, the air, the freedom, the <HI>Jenny sequi</HI> that— Oh, could you but see me salute: You have never a spontoon in the house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No; but we could get you a shove-pike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No matter. Well, Sir Jacob, and how are your fair daughters, sweet Mrs. Sneak, and the lovely Mrs. Bruin, is she as lively and as brilliant as ever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, oh, now the murder is out; this visit was intended for them; come, own

now, Major, did not you expect to meet with them here? You officers are men of such gallantry!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, we do tickle up the ladies, Sir Jacob; there is no resisting a red coat.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jacob.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, true, Major.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But that is now all over with me. <Q>“Farewel to the plumed steeds and neigh∣ing ”troops,</Q> as the black man says in the play; like the Roman censurer, I shall re∣tire to my savine field, and there cultivate cabbages.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Jac.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Under the shade of your laurels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Major.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>True, I have done with the Ma∣jor, and now return to the magistrate, <HI>Ce∣dunt Arma Togge.</HI></P>

<P>Still in the service of your country.</P>

<P>True; man was not made for himself; and so, thinking that this would prove a busy day in the justicing way, I am come, Sir Jacob, to lend you a hand.</P>

Were I, gentlemen, worthy to advise, I would recommend the opening a new branch of trade; sparagrass, gentlemen, the manufacturing of sparagrass: Battersea, I own, gentlemen, bears at present the belle: But where lies the fault? In our∣selves, gentlemen: Let us, gentlemen, but exert our natural strength, and I will take upon me to say, that a hundred of grass from the corporation of Garret, will in a short time, at the London market, be held, at least, as an equivalent to a Battersea bundle.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Where's brother Bruin? O Lord, brother, I have such a dismal story to tell you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bruin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What's the matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you know I went into the garden to look for my wife and the Major, and there I hunted and hunted as sharp as if it had been for one of my own minickens; but the deuce a Major or Madam could I see: At last, a thought come into my head to look for them up in the summer-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bruin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And there you found them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, the door was lock'd; and then I look'd thro' the key-hole: And, there, Lord a mercy upon us: <STAGE><HI>Whispers</HI></STAGE> as sure as a gun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bruin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! Zounds, why did not you break open the door?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I durst not: What, would you have me set my wit to a soldier? I warrant, the Major would have knock'd me down with one of his boots; for I could see they were both of them off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Bruin.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! Pretty doings! You see, Sir Jacob, these are the fruits of in∣dulgence;

you may call me bear, but your daughter shall never make me a beast.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Me! huzza! good Lord, who would have thought it: But how come Master Primmer to lose it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Heel-Tap.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Phill Fleam had told the electors, that Master Primmer was an Irishman; and so they would none of them give their vote for a foreigner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So then, I have it for certain: Huzza! Now, brother Bruin, you shall see how I'll manage my Madam: Gad, I'll make her know I am a man of authority; she shan't think to bullock and domineer over me.</P>
</SP>

<P>So, sot; what, is this true that I hear?</P>

<SP>

<P>May be 'tis, maybe 'tant: I don't chuse to trust my affairs with a voman: Is that right, brother Bruin?</P>

<P>Hey-day! I am amaz'd! Why, what is the meaning of this?</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the fellow is surely bewitch'd.</P>

<P>That's right; at her again.</P>

<P>Yes; and you shan't think to hector and domineer over me as you have done; for I'll go to the club when I please, and stay cut as late as I list, and row in a boat to Putney on Sundays, and wisit my

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Have I, sirrah, demean'd myself to wed such a thing, such a reptile as thee: Have not I made myself a bye-word to all my acquaintance; don't all the world cry, Lord, who would have thought it. Miss Molly Jollup to be married to Sneak, to take up at last with such a noodle as he.</P>

<P>Ay, and glad enough you could catch me: You know, you was pretty near your last legs.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mrs. Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Was there ever such a confi∣dent cur. My last legs; why, all the coun∣try knows, I could have pick'd and chus'd where I would: Did not I refuse Squire Ap-Griffith from Wales; did not Counsel∣lor Crab come a courting a twelvemonth; did not Mr. Wort, the great brewer of Brentford, make an offer that I mould keep my post-chay.</P>

<P>Nay, brother Bruin, she has had werry good proffers, that is certain.</P>

<P>Oh Major! such a riot and rumpus! like a man indeed! I wish people would mind their own affairs, and not meddle with

<P>What! read the articles of war: but these things are out of your spear: points of honour are for the sons of the sword.</P>

<P>Honour! if you come to that, where was your honour when you got my vife in the garden?</P>

<P>Now, Sir Jacob, this is the curse of our cloth: All suspected for the faults of a few.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sneak.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and not without reason; I heard of your tricks at the King of Bohemy, when you was campaining about, I did: father, Sir Jacob, he is as vicious as an old ram.</P>

<P>Not for the world, my dear Major; oh, risk not so precious a life: Un∣grateful wretches, and is this the reward for all the great feats he has done: After all his marchings, his sousings, his sweat∣ings, his swimmings; must his dear blood be spilt by a broker!</P>
