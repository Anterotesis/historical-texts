<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO give materials their due use and ar∣rangement, is the chief property that distinguishes History from Compilation; and no period, perhaps, ever required a forming hand more than that which is contained in the following volume. We will venture to say that, from the events it describes, the sy∣stem of Europe presents us with a new face; and that both the military and civil genius of Great Britain have assumed appearances dif∣ferent from those they formerly wore, in their most glorious periods.</P>
<P>The fourth volume of this Continuation ended when the American and East Indian power of France were next to annihilated; and when, by the operation of the famous Family Compact amongst the different branches of the House of Bourbon, we were upon the eve of a war with Spain. The Pub∣lick has not forgot the dangers, difficulties, and losses to this nation, attending the war with the same people, which was so lamely terminated by the peace of Aix la Chapelle,
<PB N="iv" REF="30"/>
after a continuance of almost ten years. The late Spanish war, though it lasted scarcely the tenth part of that time, had more important objects, and was more decisive in its events; but we will venture to say, that no account of it has hitherto appeared, from whence a reader can form an adequate idea of its plan and pur∣poses, which were more extensive, more truly national, and more rapidly executed than any that Great Britain was ever engaged in.—The operations of a few months cut asunder the sinews of Spanish power, and protected Por∣tugal, the only country where Spain and France could have attacked us with any probability of success.</P>
<P>The glorious consequences of this war to Great Britain, have introduced a new system of policy all over Europe.—Great Britain, alone, has encountered and defeated the once dreaded power of the House of Bourbon, and accomplished what, before the com∣mencement of the late war, would have been thought arrogance for an Englishman even to have imagined. The power of France on the continent of Europe has been broken less by our resisting it, than by our taking n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> improper lead in the affairs of Germany, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="v" REF="40"/>
by leaving the interests of that empire to be ballanced by its own constituent parts, which, when no foreign influence operates, will always preserve a proper equilibre. France can now no longer dictate to Great Britain by land, because the latter has no object in Germany, for which she can be brought to risque her most essential concerns; and the attention which she formerly directed to the continent of Europe, is now transferred to that of Ame∣rica and our American possessions.</P>
<P>The late peace has had other great effects upon the general system of Europe. By delivering us from our continental allies, we are freed from a burthen too heavy for us, on account of the subsidies we were obliged to pay them in time of peace, and the different views they had from those of Great Britain in time of war. These are truths fully proved by the events described in the short interval on which the following pages are employed, and which produces what may be called the catastrophe, or completion of all the transactions contained in the four preceding volumes.</P>
<P>The reader, in the subsequent sheets (the con∣nexion of which with that of the preceding, he
<PB N="vi" REF="50"/>
may find in the note annexed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inhabitants of Gre∣nada refused to obey the sum∣mons of commodore Swan∣ton; but he being joined by a body of troops under the command of brigadier-ge∣neral Walsh, who was de∣tached upon this service by general Monckt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, they thought proper to submit without further opposition, although the island, by the nature of its situation, was capable of making a vigor∣cus defence. It lies about fifty leagues to the south-west of Barbadoes, has a good har∣bour, and the soil produces sugar, indigo, and many other valuable commodities. The inhabitants enjoyed the same capitulation which had been granted to the people of Martinique; and this was ex∣tended to the Grenadillas, a number of small fruitful islands by which the other is surrounded. At the same time the English troops took possession of the islands St. Lucie, Tobago, and St. Vin∣cent, which the French had begun to settle, although they had been considered as neutral by the late treaties subsisting between the two nations.—While the British armament remained at Mar∣tinique, a French fleet ap∣peared to windward of the island, and sent an officer on shore to receive intelligence. They continued cruising to windward for two days, and even approached within can∣non-shot of Trinity, as if their intention had been to make a descent: but after∣wards they changed their course, and bore away for the island of Dominique. Ad∣miral Rodney being informed of their arrival on the coast of Martinique, got under sail with his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quadron, and beat up to windward in quest of the enemy; but they did not wait his coming.</NOTE>) will see a new plan of internal as well as external policy adopted by the British government, which has been productive of great altercation, and attended with various impressions on the minds of a people, jealous to excess of their civil liberty, and greedily embracing every opportunity, whether real or delusive, which
<PB N="vii" REF="60"/>
they think can tend either to enlarge or se∣cure it. The same principle that has taken off from our necks the dead weight of conti∣nental connections, has removed the screen which they but too often placed between the king and the subject, to the irreparable loss of both.—The throne is now accessible to all ranks and orders of men; because the mo∣narch who fills it knows he has nothing to apprehend from those distinctions which, in former times, were too artfully propagated, and too hastily believed. These are facts which have been fully explained in the pre∣ceding parts of this History.</P>
<P>The utmost care has been taken, in the course of this volume, to ascertain the pro∣per boundaries between Prerogative and Pri∣vilege, and to distinguish the real acquisitions Liberty has made, from the dangerous inno∣vations Faction would introduce. The reader has here a clear view of those improvements and advantages that are, or ought to be, the concomitants of new established peace. No argument urged in favour of any of the public parties among us, has been either suppressed, disguised, or weakened in the re∣presentation; and as national affairs, never, since the Revolution took place, have had so fair a discussion as during the present reign,
<PB N="viii" REF="70"/>
the author has endeavoured to avail himself of the several tracts that carry the greatest autho∣rity with either party; and nothing can give him more pleasure than in preserving, with the rational and sober part of his country∣men, the character of a just and dispassionate historian.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">GEORGE III.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762. Transac∣tions in parlia∣ment.</NOTE> BEFORE we relate the consequences of the new war with Spain, it will be neces∣sary to particularize the other transactions in parliament which distinguished this s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion▪ as well as to give a detail of some domestic occur∣rences; and then proceed, as usual, to the opera∣tions of war on the continent of Germany. In the course of the preceding year, it had been thought proper to lay an additional duty of three shillings on every barrel of beer; and as this did not immediately take place, it made little impres∣sion on the minds of the people: but now that the brewers began to raise the price of their li∣quor, and the publicans in consequence resolved to demand one halfpenny extraordinary on every quart of strong beer, the cities of London and
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> Westminster were filled with tumult. The popu∣lace vowed revenge against the brewers for exact∣ing a higher price than usual from the victuallers; and even threatened to pull down the houses of those publicans who should charge the additional halfpenny on their beer. Under the terror of these menaces, they petitioned the house of commons for protection and relief; and a new act was passed in favour of their request. It implied that no brewer or retailer of strong beer or ale should be liable to be sued, impleaded, or molested, by indictment, in∣formation, popular action, or otherwise, for ad∣vancing the price; and that, on the other hand, they should not be allowed to mix it, on any pre∣tence whatsoever, after the gauge of it should be taken by an officer of the excise. It may be worth observing, that all the odium of this unpopular tax fell upon the present king and his ministry, tho' it was a measure planned, regulated, and settled in the last reign: such is the preposterous caprice of a vulgar indulged in insolence and riot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New mi∣litia act.</NOTE> Another law was passed to explain, amend, and reduce into one act, the several laws relating to the militia, which had been found hitherto ineffec∣tual. By this last regulation, parish-officers are impowered, with the consent of the inhabitants, to provide voluntiers for the militia, by a rate on the parish, in proportion to that for the relief of their poor. It is also provided, that no person under eighteen or above forty-five, nor articled clerk, apprentice, or pauper with three children born in wedlock, shall be compelled to serve. By these alterations in the militia law, every man is
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
to pay his quota; all parishes have it in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> their power to keep their useful hands at home, and to employ the idle and dissolute in the service of their country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for the regu∣lation of prize∣money.</NOTE> A bill was moreover passed for vesting the pro∣perty of all Spanish prizes in the captors, and for continuing during the present war with Spain, all the provisions and regulations which were made on the same subject in different acts passed in the twenty-ninth, thirty-second, and thirty-third years of the late reign. It might deserve the conside∣ration of the legislature, whether it would not be expedient to alter the proportions in which all prize-money is at present distributed to the officers and sailors on board a ship of war. Nothing can be more absurd than the regulation by which a captain shares three-eighths of the prize, amount∣ing to one-eighth more than is divided among the whole crew of common seamen. In consequence of this ridiculous custom, private captains are of∣ten raised by accident to the possession of over∣grown fortunes, to which their merit gives them no title; and the hope of such an exorbitant share of booty renders them so eager in the pursuit of trading vessels, that they often neglect opportuni∣ties of acting more vigorously against the enemy. If the captain's share was limited to one-sixteenth, he would have a proportion sufficiently suited to his rank; another sixteenth might be added to the share of the seamen; and one-fourth of the whole prize might be employed in the service of the public.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762. Other bills.</NOTE> With a view to prevent in some measure certain inhuman practices relating to poor parish children within the bills of mortality, the parliament en∣acted a law for keeping an annual register of those infants in every parish, under the age of four, a time of life in which they were supposed to be more particularly exposed to the barbarity of their nur∣ses, some of whom were said to be the more fa∣voured by the overseers of the poor, the more dexterous they proved themselves in dispatching the unhappy orphans committed to their charge. The suspicion that such cruelties had been exer∣cised, was supported by strong presumptions, which indeed gave rise to this bill in favour of pu∣blic registers, which will be a considerable check upon the overseers. They will point out those pa∣rishes where the greatest mortality prevails among those hapless children, and perhaps induce the le∣gislature to inquire into the cause of this calamity. The parish-officers, thus open to detection, will execute their office with a more conscious regard to the duties of christian humanity.</P>
<P>A new law was made for rendering London-bridge more accessible for the convenience of com∣merce; and another to facilitate a scheme for sup∣plying the cities of London and Westminster with fresh fish by land-carriage from different parts of the kingdom. This useful scheme, conceived and digested by a private gentleman called Blake, a descendant of the celebrated admiral Blake, was pa∣tronized by the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, who advanced a considerable sum towards the execution of it; and the capital was in a little
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
time supplied with great plenty and variety of ex∣cellent<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1762.</NOTE> fish, by the industry and ingenuity of the projector. He had no other view but that of rescu∣ing the people from the tyranny of a few indivi∣duals, who had long monopolized the market, and kept up the commodity at exorbitant rates: but whether a scheme founded on public utility, openly executed, and honestly pursued, will be able to maintain its ground against a powerful combina∣tion of wealthy individuals, who will not scruple to expend large sums to effect its miscarriage, time alone will discover <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a new law for the preservation of the game, it was decreed, that after the first day of June next ensu∣ing, no partridge, pheasant, heath-fowl, or grouse, should be killed, taken, or sold, any year, between the twelfth day of February and first of September, for partridges; between the first of Febru∣ary and the first of October, for pheasants; between the first of January and the twentieth of August, for heath-fowl, commonly called black-game; and between the first of December and the twenty-fifth day of July, for the grouse, commonly cal∣led the red-game.—The person offending against this law to forfeit five pounds for every bird, to the prosecutor.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A new act passed for the better lighting and pa∣ving the streets of Westminster, which were neither very safe nor commodious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill for naturali∣zing fo∣reign of∣ficers.</NOTE> By another, the king was enabled to grant com∣missions to a certain number of foreign pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s who had settled in America, and been very useful to the service in raising and disciplining soldiers on that continent. As a reward for their fidelity, and a further encouragement to protestant adventu∣rers, it was now enacted that all foreigners of this
<PB N="14" REF="130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> religion, as well officers as soldiers, who had ser∣ved, or should hereafter serve, in the Royal Ame∣rican regiment, or as engineers in America, for the space of two years, taking and subscribing the oaths, should be deemed natural-born subjects of Great-Britain to all intents and purposes; except that no person naturalized by this act, should be held capable of being a member of the privy council, or either house of parliament, or of en∣joying any office or place of trust within the king∣doms of Great-Britain and Ireland, either civil or military; or any grant from the crown to himself, or to any other in trust for him, of any lands, tene∣ments, or hereditaments, within the said king∣doms. Neither does the benefit of this act extend to children born out of the king's allegiance, whose fathers, at the birth of such children, were liable to the penalties of high-treason or felony, or in the service of any foreign power at war with Great-Britain, excepting still the children of those who quitted Ireland in pursuance of the capitula∣tion of Limerick. Yet even this Jewish law of vi∣siting the iniquities of the fathers on the children, which had passed in the fourth year of the late reign, had been mitigated by another clause in the same act, importing, That the privileges of natu∣ralization should, notwithstanding, be enjoyed by every child thus disqualified, who should make it appear that he had resided two years in any part of the British dominions, between the sixteenth day of November in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and eight, and the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thousand seven hundred and thirty-one,
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
and had professed the protestant religion, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> died in Great-Britain or the dominions thereof, within the said term; or had possessed any lands, or made any settlement in Great-Britain or Ireland. The practice of naturalizing foreign protestants is certainly, at this juncture, highly expedient for the benefit of Great-Britain and her colonies; now▪ when the mother-country is so depopulated by war and migration, that there is not a sufficient num∣ber of hands left for the purposes of agriculture, manufacture, and commerce; and when the na∣tion has made the acquisition of rich islands, and an immense continent, whose value must always depend upon their population.</P>
<P>A new law was made for securing the additional salaries to the puisne judges, whom the king had rendered independent, in the course of the preced∣ing session.</P>
<P>The mutiny bill was passed as an annual regu∣lation; and the parliament enacted an explanatory<NOTE PLACE="marg">Touching the lon∣gitude at sea.</NOTE> law for a further encouragement to those who should make any progress towards the discovery of a cer∣tain method for finding out the longitude at sea, that great desideratum in the art of navigation. Mr. Harrison, a clock-maker of London, had con∣trived a curious time-piece, which, under the di∣rection of his son, was tried in a voyage to the West-Indies, and found to succeed in all experi∣ments infinitely beyond any thing which had been hitherto invented on the same subject. Mr. Irwin, a native of Ireland, had also contrived a marine chair, by means of which it was found practicable, in the roughest weather at sea, to take observations
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> of the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's satel∣lites, from which the longitude may be ascertained. This machine had been found successful upon trial; and now a board of longitude was held at the Ad∣miralty, to consider the merit of those improve∣ments, in consequence of the act lately passed. Mr. Harrison and his son were gratified with a re∣ward of fifteen hundred pounds; and five hun∣dred were bestowed upon Mr. Irwin. Many me∣thods were, at this time, proposed for finding the longitude at sea, and some of them appeared to be extremely ingenious: but as none of them had been reduced to practice by actual experiment, the claims and pretensions of their several authors were neglected or overlooked <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a bill passed in this session, an annuity of three thousand pounds was settled and secured for the use of Arthur Onslow, Esq; late speaker of the house of com∣mons.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The business of the session being ended, the king concluded it with a speech, as usual, on the second day of June, when both houses were prorogued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Transac∣tions of the Irish parlia∣ment.</NOTE> There was nothing remarkable that distinguished this session in the parliament of Ireland, except a remarkable resolution in favour of their lord▪lieute∣nant the earl of Halifax, whose conduct they in∣tirely approved, and whose character they held in the utmost veneration. They unanimously resolved on an address to his excellency, desiring he would represent to the king the sense of the house, that the appointments of the lord-lieutenant were be∣come
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>
inadequate to the dignity of that office: they<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> therefore humbly desired that his majesty would be pleased to grant such an augmentation to the en∣tertainment of the lord-lieutenant for the time be∣ing, as should raise the whole to the annual sum of sixteen thousand pounds. At the same time they expressed their satisfaction at the pleasing hope that this augmentation should take place during the administration of a chief governor whose many great and amiable qualities, whose wise and happy administration in the government of that kingdom, had universally endeared him to the people of Ire∣land. The earl received this glorious testimony of their approbation with all suitable acknowledg∣ments: but, with a delicacy peculiar to himself, declined their proposal that the augmentation should take place during his government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion in that king∣dom.</NOTE> The peace of that kingdom had been for some time disturbed by a set of licentious people, who assembled in the night in arms, and committed many outrages in different parts of the island. They were indiscriminately distinguished by the name of White Boys and Levellers, because they wore linen shirts over their cloaths, that they might know one another in the dark; and level∣led all the inclosures which had encroached up∣on commons. Indeed, this was not the only grie∣vance of which they complained. They looked upon every diminution of a common as an injury to the poor, who had used to enjoy the benefit of that common. They therefore not only destroyed the fences which had lately been made, but also robbed and maltreated the authors and proprietors
<PB N="18" REF="170"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> of those encroachments. They even made head against some parties and detachments that were sent to suppress them▪ and some lives were lost. A re∣port began to gain ground that those were no other than assemblies of malcontents taking measures a∣gainst the established government: that they were already encreased to a formidable number, well armed and disciplined by officers, who had come for that purpose from France and other foreign countries. These surmises, however, were abso∣lutely without foundation, and all those petty insur∣rections were quelled by the vigilance and wise conduct of the lord-lieutenant, who, nevertheless, found it absolutely necessary to make some exam∣ples of severity, in order to prevent such distur∣bances for the future. What contributed, per∣haps, to the more speedy restoration of that king∣dom's quiet, was the raising of six new battalions on that establishment, which were, in the course of this year, levied in Ireland, of protestants and catholics indiscriminately; an experiment which succeeded according to the wish of those by whom it was projected. This and other indulgencies which may be safely granted to the catholics in Ire∣land, who are generally well affected to the esta∣blished government, would prevent the emigration of many industrious hands, who are not only lost to their native country, but even contribute to strengthen the power of the enemies of Great-Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able im∣posture in London.</NOTE> In giving a detail of the domestic transactions which happened during the course of this year in Great-Britain, it may be deemed superfluous to
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
particularize every event which engaged the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> attention of the public: we shall therefore in ge∣neral observe, that murders, robberies, fraud, im∣posture, and every species of villainy continued to prevail not only in the metropolis, but in almost every part of the kingdom, to the shame of police, the disgrace of the nation, and the reproach of hu∣manity. From the frivolous pursuits of the people, their rage for novelty, their admiration of shew and pageantry, their ridiculous extravagance, their licentious conduct, their savage appetite for war and carnage which they had for some time avowed, and the spirit of superstition with which they be∣gan to be possessed, one would be apt to believe that the human mind had begun to degenerate, and that mankind was relapsing into their original ignorance and barbarity. In the beginning of the year, the inhabitants of London and Westminster were alarmed and engrossed by the imposture of a child of ten years of age, the daughter of one Par∣sons, clerk of a parish in Cock-Lane, near West-Smithfield. This girl, tutored in all appearance by the father for the purposes of malice, pretended to be visited by the spirit of a young woman who had formerly lodged in the house, and died about a year and a half before this period. This per∣son, who went by the name of Fanny, had lived in familiarity with one Mr. K—t, a broker. He had been the husband of her sister, and would have willingly taken Fanny to wife: but this union being forbid by the canon law, the parties agreed to indulge their mutual passion without the ceremony of the church, and lived together with great har∣mony,
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> until she was seized with the small-pox, of which distemper she died, to the unspeakable grief of her lover, to whom she bequeathed the whole of her slender fortune. Mr. K—t had, it seems, incurred the resentment of P—s, by pressing him for the payment of some money he had lent him while he lodged at his house; and this is sup∣posed to have been the source of the plan which he now projected for the broker's destruction. His daughter pretended to see the apparition of Fanny, whose favourite she had been. She was seized with fits and agitations; and strange noises of scratch∣ing, fluttering, whispering, and knocking, were heard in the apartment where she lay. A woman who lived in the house, and was an accomplice in the imposture, pretended to hold conferences with the spectre. She asked if it was the spirit of Fan∣ny; and if it was, desired the affirmative might be signified by a certain number of distinct knocks, which were heard accordingly. The signs of assent and negation being thus ascertained, she proceeded with a number of interrogations. She asked if the spirit had any thing to disclose for the detection of guilt?—if it was the spirit of Fanny?—if her death had been hastened by violent means?—if those means had been used by Mr. K—t with whom she lived? To all these and many other questions, answers were made in the affirmative by three distinct knocks to each interrogation; and this sort of communication was often repeated in the hearing of many different companies of peo∣ple, who crowded to the house in order to satisfy their curiosity. The sound of the knocks varied
<PB N="21" REF="200"/>
at different times, and seemed to proceed occasion∣ally<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> from different parts of the room: other noises of scratching, rustling, whispering, and something like the fluttering of wings, were fre∣quently perceived, while the child lay in bed seemingly insensible; for her presence was the sole condition on which the spirit would make itself known, and it declared it would follow her where∣soever she should be conveyed. The circum∣stances of this strange visitation being reported, with many idle exaggerations, interested the public to such a degree, that in all assemblies, from the highest to the most humble, nothing was heard but remarks and observations on the progress of the spirit in Cock-Lane, where there was a perpe∣tual flux and reflux of people of all ranks and characters, whether stimulated by curiosity, actu∣ated by superstition, or attracted by the hopes of amusement and pastime. What was at first pro∣posed as the gratification of revenge alone, became now a source of considerable profit, as every per∣son paid for admittance to the haunted chamber. Among the lower class of people this ridiculous im∣posture produced a general spirit of infatuation, and filled the domestics of almost every family with such terrors as greatly disconcerted them in the performance of their several functions. Many weak minds in respectable spheres of life, were in∣fected by the fears of the vulgar. Some indivi∣duals who entered the house with a view to mirth and ridicule, were so struck with the scene, that they became converts to the general belief. It even made an impression upon some persons of su∣perior
<PB N="22" REF="210"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> understanding; and one or two clergymen openly avowed themselves patrons of this superna∣tural visitation. Superstitious terror is of all the different species of fear the most infectious; and when once it gains possession of the human mind, renders all the suggestions of reason ineffectual. The spirit was asked if it would signify its presence in the vault of a certain church where the body of Fanny was deposited; an answer was made in the affirmative, and the hour appointed for this expe∣riment. The child was removed to another house, and so narrowly watched, that she could neither make use of her own hands, nor be assisted by any accomplice. While she remained in this situation, no knocks nor noises were heard. The vault was visited at the hour appointed: but the spirit gave no tokens of its being present. The girl being reconveyed to her father's house, the noises re∣turned, and the spurious ghost declared in the usual▪way, that it did not exhibit in the vault be∣cause the body had been previously removed from thence, and was now interred in another place. The vault was again visited by several persons of credit, in whose presence the coffin was opened, and the body found almost quite consumed. This was an evidence which ought to have opened the eyes of the most infatuated; and immediately af∣terwards the girl being again removed to another house, in order to be more narrowly observed, was detected in the act of conveying to bed with her, a piece of board on which she had knocked with her fingers.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="220"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762. Punish∣ment of the au∣thors.</NOTE> Notwithstanding these strong proofs of impos∣ture, and the glaring absurdities which every un∣prejudiced man of common sense must have per∣ceived in the whole contrivance and exhibition of this ridiculous scene, the reputation of the Cock-Lane spirit still gained ground; and of consequence the person whom it accused, was universally de∣tested as an infamous murderer, who had poisoned a poor young creature, after having robbed her of her innocence. In vain he endeavoured to vindi∣cate himself from this insidious charge, by publish∣ing the affidavits of the physician and apothecary who attended her in her last illness; in vain he availed himself of the testimony of those who con∣versed with her in her last moments, and saw the tender parting between her and the man whom her spirit was now supposed so virulently to im∣peach: the more pains he took in his own justifi∣cation, the people seemed the more convinced of his guilt; and some papers equally artful and ma∣licious were published, with a view to refute what he had advanced in his own justification. Under this disagreeable oppression, he had recourse to the protection of the law, by commencing a pro∣secution against Parsons, the father of the child, a certain ecclesiastic who had been very active in behalf of the pretended spirit, and some others, who, by supporting the imposture, had contribu∣ted to the ruin of his reputation and fortune. They were indicted for a conspiracy, and tried be∣fore the lord-chief-justice Mansfield, who would not suffer them to make the least attempt towards proving that the visitation was, or might have
<PB N="24" REF="230"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> been, supernatural. He treated such a supposition with the contempt it deserved, and represented the whole in the right point of view, as an infamous imposture, contrived and carried on in order to effect the ruin of an innocent person. Accord∣ingly, they were convicted of the conspiracy.

The principal person of the three, was called Outacite, signifying Man∣killer, who had signalized himself by his valour in many skirmishes. He and his companions had been induced to visit England by motives of curio∣sity, which was the more remarkable, as during their stay in London, they expressed no emotions of surprize at any thing that fell under their obser∣vation, although they were indulged with the sight of every object that might be supposed to strike the imagination of a savage. They traversed the vast metropolis, swarming with innumerable crowds of people. They beheld the shops and warehouses filled with incredible profusion of wealth and mer∣chandize; and the river covered with ships and vessels. They surveyed the churches, hospitals, palaces, and houses of the nobility: they viewed the guards exercised in the park; the surprising armoury at the Tower; the splendor and magnifi∣cence of the court; the train of artillery, the fleets, the dock yards, in different parts of the kingdom. In a word, they saw all the improvements of arts and mechanics, the commerce, strength, and opu∣lence of England, without discovering the least symptom of admiration, either in word, look, or gesture. They seemed to be in a state of brutal insensibility, which indeed seems to be the character of the North American tribes in general, notwith∣standing all the encomiums which some writers have lavished on the natural good sense and sagacity of that people. After having been feasted and ca∣ressed for some months by the English people, they

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Instances of his ma∣jesty's hu∣manity.</NOTE> Every day exhibited fresh instances of his ma∣jesty's humanity and affection for his people. As the proprietors of the Antigallican privateer were said to have sustained a very considerable loss from the partiality of the Spaniards in the late reign, who had detained that ship at Cadiz, and restored to France the rich prize which she had taken; the king now ordered them a ship of forty-four guns, that they might equip her as a privateer, in or∣der to indemnify themselves upon the subjects of Spain. His humanity was still more conspicuous with respect to the crew of a French frigate, called the Zenobie, commanded by Mr. de Sage, which was shipwrecked in January on the peninsula of Portland. About seventy of the people reached the shore, where they were barbarously stripped by the inhabitants. His majesty was no sooner made acquainted with their deplorable situation, than he ordered them to be supplied with necessaries and entertainment at his expence; and the lords of the admiralty gave them to understand that they were not considered as prisoners. It was not long before this act of generosity was retaliated by the subjects of France. An English trading vessel being drove ashore on the coast of Havre-de-Grace, the com∣mandant of that place received the crew with the utmost hospitality. They had good quarters pro∣vided for them, and a daily allowance of thirty sols per man, until they were sent back to their own country.</P>

He made for his own use a noble provision of curious books, prints, and drawings, including two capital collections, amounting to three hundred volumes, which had belonged to cardinal Albani at Rome, and the library and museum of Mr. Smith, a curious virtuoso who resided at Venice. The pa∣lace of Buckingham house, in St. James's Park, he purchased of sir Charles Sheffield, and presented it to the queen, after it had been improved, enlarged, and elegantly adorned with pictures and furniture for her majesty's reception.

They might be employed in places under the government, adapted to their several talents and dispositions. Indeed when we reflect upon the vast variety of offices in the gift of the crown, both at home and abroad; places in the different branches of the revenue and police: when we consider the multitude of consuls, agents, contractors, commissaries, residents, gover∣nors, and secretaries, appointed in different parts of Europe, Africa, and America; when we examine the characters of many individuals who enjoy those offices of trust and emolument, without either ta∣lent, integrity, or reputation; and revolve the number of men of genius, capacity, and character, who languish in obscurity, struggling with the ad∣versities of life, neglected even by those ministers to whom their merit is not unknown; we cannot help feeling the mingled emotions of pity, con∣tempt, and indignation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of May the king created lord Ligonier viscount of Clonmel in Ire∣land, the dignity to descend, in default of his issue male, to his nephew lieutenant co∣lonel Ligonier.

In the low parts of Essex the waters rose twelve feet in less than five hours; all their stacks of corn, hay, and wood, together with cottages, barns, hogs, and cattle, were swept away. At Chelmsford, Cambridge, and Norwich, great damage was sustained.

Ex∣traordinary collections were made for the indigent in every parish. The king gave a thousand pounds to the bishop of London, to be distributed among proper objects. The dukes of Newcastle, Bedford, and the earl of Bute, contributed largely to the re∣lief of the distressed. Many other noblemen, gen∣tlemen, and other persons in affluent circumstances, exerted their charity in favour of the poor, who were in general well clothed, fed, and supplied with necessaries: but the calamity was most severely felt by those who experienced in secret the pressure of in∣digence, and were too modest to make their misery known, or too proud to sollicit assistance.

While they were thus employed in sapping insensibly the very foundations of the constitution, they affected on all occasions a spirit of toleration in matters of religion. They professed the abhorrence of their ancestors to the doctrines of passive obedience and indefeasible hereditary right: they took every op∣portunity to give themselves credit for the revolu∣tion, to stigmatize the family of Stuart, and to brand all their political adversaries with the odious names of Tory and Jacobite, which they affirmed to be synonymous terms.

Many of them were persons of great rank and extensive property, equally distin∣guished by their abilities and integrity; and many of them had approved themselves faithful adherents to his father and his family. He was therefore de∣termined to favour and protect all his subjects equally, without any other distinction than that of merit; and to avoid the errors of his two immedi∣ate predecessors, who by appearing at the head of a party, had not only deprived their own councils of the best heads and best hearts in the kingdom; but also provoked some individuals to embroil the administration, from which they found themselves so unjustly excluded.</P>

In all likelihood he entertained no very high idea of the d—ke's management and capacity, and per∣ceived it would be expedient to give the direction of the treasury to the person who should be placed at the helm of government. These were probably the considerations, in consequence of which his grace was desired to resign his employment, and he retired accordingly about the latter end of May, when the earl of Bute was appointed first lord of the treasury. Mr. George Grenville, brother to earl Temple, became secretary of state in the room of his lordship; and the place of first commissioner of the admiralty being vacated by the death of lord Anson, that office was bestowed upon the earl of Hallifax, now returned from Ireland. To ma∣nage the affairs of the administration in parliament, it was necessary to employ some person of talents and influence, well acquainted with the business and temper of the house of commons; and for this purpose the choice fell upon Mr. F—x, who still continued in the office of pay-master general of the forces, which, in time of war, is the most lucrative place under the British government.</P>

The French were already expelled from all their settlements in North-Ame∣rica, except that of Louisiana, which was deemed an object of little or no importance. It was re∣solved therefore to transfer the seat of war from that continent; to attack the French islands, the conquest of which we have already described; and to make a vigorous impression upon Spain, not only by attempting the reduction of the Havanna, which may be considered as the key of the bay of Mexico; but also by making a descent on the island of Manilla, in the East Indies, a country in which the French had now nothing left to be con∣quered.</P>
<P>The first of these expeditions was intrusted to the conduct of the earl of Albemarle commander of the land forces, recommended for this service by the duke of Cumberland under whose auspices he had been formed to war; and the ships of war destined to co-operate in the attack, were com∣manded by admiral Sir George Pococke, who had already distinguished himself by his gallantry in the East-Indies: his second was Mr. Keppel, brother to the earl, an able officer, who had reduced the Isle of Goree, on the coast of Africa.

After a short contest both the bat∣tery and ship were abandoned: before captain Hotham could take possession of his prize, she ran aground, and bulging, was burned by the captors. She was a large ship bound from the Caraccas to Passage, laden with hides and cocoa; the other escaped in the night.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> her designs upon their West Indian settle∣ments, it would be necessary to find new employ∣ment for her arms in another quarter, resolved to attack her through the sides of some ally, the only avenue by which she was at all accessible. The war in Germany, howsoever it might have increased her burthens, had not yet been able to exhaust her credit; nor had it prevented her conquests in other quarters of the globe. They hoped, however, that both these purposes might be effected by add∣ing to that drain another continental sluice through which her blood and treasure should be discharged. In these sentiments they cast their eyes upon the kingdom of Portugal, which was suited in all re∣spects to the ideas they had conceived. They knew it was a country altogether unprovided with the means of defence. The military spirit by which the Portuguese had formerly signalized themselves, was now quite extinguished. The nobles were grown effeminate and slothful. The people were overwhelmed with ignorance, bigotry, and op∣pression spiritual as well as temporal. There was neither valour, skill, discipline, nor order among their troops; nor indeed any appearance of a re∣gular army; and the frontier places were ill-forti∣fied, worse garrisoned, and almost destitute of ar∣tillery and ammunition. The kingdom had not yet recovered from the consternation and losses oc∣casioned by the dreadful earthquake which had de∣stroyed the capital. The expulsion of the Jesuits, and the subsequent difference with the see of Rome, had filled the nation with discontent and disquiet. The late attempt upon the king's life by persons of

the first rank, had naturally inspired the sovereign<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> with sentiments of distrust and anxiety; and the minds of the people were still overspread with gloomy terror from the horrible execution of the conspirators, who consisted of the first families in Portugal, men not more distinguished by their high rank, than generally esteemed and beloved for their personal qualifications. This being the unfortunate situation of Portugal, the house of Bourbon hoped that kingdom would be an easy conquest, notwithstanding all the succours it could possibly receive from England; that this being once atchieved, Great Britain would lose one con∣siderable source of wealth, amounting to a million sterling per annum, the balance of her trade with this country; and that such a conquest would be a valuable deposit to be exchanged at the peace for the further acquisitions England might make at the expence of France or Spain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions a∣gainst that kingdom.</NOTE> The previous measures being taken by these two powers, his catholic majesty began to make prepa∣rations for war.

The court of Lisbon, alarmed at these motions, the meaning of which it could not misunderstand, had immediate recourse to the king of England, the only ally upon whom his Portuguese majesty thought he could depend for protection. His am∣bassador at London explained to the ministry the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> danger to which his master was exposed from such a formidable invasion; at the same time declaring he was resolved to pursue the most vigorous mea¦sures of defence. He observed that the Portugues<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> troops were ordered to assemble; that direction were given for equipping a squadron of ships; fo putting the sea-ports in a posture of defence; and for fortifying the frontiers of the kingdom. Fi¦nally, he assured them that his most faithful majesty was determined to adhere to his engagements with England. He therefore made a requisition of th succours stipulated in favour of Portugal, by th treaties subsisting between the two nations. H expressed a desire that his master should be sup¦plied with a number of able officers to command discipline, and conduct the forces of Portugal which had been long disused to war; and that hi Britannic majesty would continue to favour him with what further assistance the necessities of hi occasions might require.</P>
<P>The court of London, reflecting that both th honour and the interest of Great Britain was con¦cerned in supporting this ally, resolved immediately to exert itself for the defence of Portugal.

The king of Spain, after having professed the warmest affection for his dear brother-in-law, and the most cordial attachment to his interests, insisted upon his driving all the British subjects out of his dominions, and all the English shipping from his ports, giving him to understand that he had an army already on the frontiers of Portugal, which should enter the king∣dom without delay, and occupy his fortresses and maritime places, to protect them from the resent∣ment of the English monarch, should he attempt to chastise his faithful majesty for having abandoned the alliance of Great Britain.</P>
<P>The ministers of the two crowns, when they de∣livered these extraordinary memorials, declared to Don Lewis da Cunha, the Portuguese secretary of state, that they were ordered to demand a catego∣rical answer in four days, and that every delay be∣yond that term would be considered as a refusal. It would be superfluous to make any other reflection upon those memorials, but that they were perhaps
<PB N="50" REF="510"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> the most insolent and iniquitous which had ever been presented to any independent state; that the arguments they contained were equally ridiculous and absurd; and that the slightest matter will serve as a pretence to powerful princes, who find them∣selves in condition to oppress their weaker neigh∣bours, for the gratification of their own interest or ambition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflec∣tions on the situ∣ation of that mo∣narch.</NOTE> The king of Portugal, thus situated, seems to have had some reason for hesitation. The threats of the house of Bourbon resembled a dreadful storm ready to burst upon his head: even their of∣fers of friendship were accompanied with a condi∣tion which struck at the very foundation of his in∣dependency; namely, that of admitting Spanish garrisons into all his fortified places. The enmity of Great-Britain, which he was solicited to pro∣voke, formed a prospect which, though at a greater distance, appeared equally dangerous and discou∣raging. Portugal has no resources in itself, but depends entirely upon the supplies of gold and merchandize which it draws from its settlements in the East-Indies, and its colony of Brasil upon the continent of America. None of these were in any condition of defence; consequently they lay exposed at the mercy of England, whose fleets covered the ocean, and whose naval armaments had for some tim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> triumphed over all resistance. Over and above these considerations, perhaps he reflect∣ed that England was the only nation to which his people could dispose of the wines of Portugal to advantage, and by which they could be regularly and reasonably supplied with those necessary arti∣cles
<PB N="51" REF="520"/>
of merchandize which their own country did<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> not produce.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He rejects their pro∣posals.</NOTE> Whatever his reflections might have been when he was first menaced with this invasion, his resolu∣tion was now taken. He replied to the memorials which had been delivered to his minister, That he was sincerely disposed to act as mediator in com∣promising the differences between the house of Bourbon and the king of Great-Britain: that the honour of his crown and the faith of solemn trea∣ties would not permit him to abandon the alli∣ance of England, from which he had received no injury or provocation: that the deplorable state of his kingdom would not allow him (were he so in∣clined) to engage as a principal of the war: that he was determined to observe a strict neutrality: that he had given orders to repair his maritime places, to equip a squadron of ships sufficient to protect them, and to hold his troops in readiness for the defence of his kingdom, as well as for the maintenance of that neutrality to which he ad∣hered.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> he had received satisfaction: that as he had not obtained restitution of the French ships so taken in the Bay of Lagos, the most christian king had a right to declare war against Portugal: that his most faithful majesty's defensive alliance with England became, in effect, an offensive alli∣ance, from the situation of the Portuguese domi∣nions, and from the nature of the English power: that the British squadrons could not keep the sea in all seasons, nor intercept the French and Spanish navigation without the ports and assistance of Por∣tugal: that all the riches of Portugal passed into the hands of the English; consequently Portugal furnishes them with the means to make war, the alliance therefore is offensive: that those alliances were made in the beginning of the century, when differences subsisted between the possessors of the two crowns of Spain and Portugal; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now those animosities are happily removed, and the two kings are connected by the ties of blood and friendship; consequently his Portuguese majesty ought to abandon the English, and enter heartily into the measures and resentments of his good brother. They again invited him to take this salutary step, declaring that, in the mean time, the Spanish troops should enter Portugal to take possession of those places which the enemy might otherwise be permitted to occupy: that they should maintain the strictest discipline, and pay punctually for every necessary with which they might be sup∣plied, unless they should meet with resistance; in which case their peaceable intention might be frustrated.</P>

All the French and Spanish subjects in Portugal were ordered to quit that kingdom in fifteen days, and their goods were consiscated. The same rigour was practised against the Portuguese who were set∣tled in France and Spain, though expresly contrary to an article in the treaty of Utrecht, stipulating that, in case of a rupture, the space of six months should be granted to the subjects of the two crowns respectively, to sell or remove their effects, and withdraw their persons.

The earl of Loudon was second to lord Tyrawley in conducting the English auxiliaries; lieutenant-general Townshend, who had served with such reputation in America, was next to his lordship in command; and the subordinates were lord George Lenox, with the brigadiers Craw∣ford and Burgoyne; the former of these last had been govern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, where he was now suc∣ceeded by colonel Forrester, an accomplished officer, equally dist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed for his wit, politeness, and hu∣manity; the other commanded a regiment of light horse, which were now numbered among the Eng∣lish troops who served in Portugal.

The officers of Britain, even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their endeavours to distress the in∣vaders of Portugal, were upon all occasions thwart∣ed, impeded, and opposed by those wretched bigots, who would rather have been enslaved, even by the odious Spaniard, than owe their deliverance to the more detested subjects of Great Britain. Their ani∣mosity to the Spaniards was founded on temporal provocations; but their abhorrence of the English

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inactivity of the Spaniards</NOTE> The Spanish forces had, without all doubt, many difficulties to encounter from the nature of the country, which was not only extremely mountain∣ous, but so very barren and wretchedly poor, as to afford little or nothing for their subsistence. Ne∣vertheless, had they been really bent upon the con∣quest of the kingdom; had they advanced with spirit, activity and perseverance, and made a proper use of all the advantages they possessed, it was sup∣posed they might have penetrated to Lisbon before any effectual measures could have been taken to ob∣struct their progress. But, instead of prosecuting their first success with vigour, they lingered in their operations, and during the heats of summer, were distributed into quarters of refreshment. These de∣lays seemed to corroborate the suspicion of a secret understanding between the courts of Madrid and Lisbon. Had the Spaniards taken possession of the whole kingdom, the war in that quarter must have been terminated. The British succours would have been withdrawn by means of a squadron, which re∣mained in the Tagus to answer any emergency of that nature; and perhaps the next armament from England would have been directed against Brasil.</P>

uncommon courage, conduct, and expedition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> For this enterprize the count pitched upon briga∣dier Burgoyne, who, on the twenty-fifth day of July, passed the Tagus at midnight, with four hun∣dred of his own dragoons, and put himself at the head of all the British grenadiers, commanded by lord Pulteney, and eleven companies of Portuguese grenadiers, with two pieces of light artillery, and two howitzers. Having marched across the coun∣try to Apallem, which he reached on the morning of the twenty-fifth, he proceeded to Castel-Vida, where, arriving late at night, he was joined by some infantry, and irregular cavalry, with forty-eight armed peasants; and here he made his final disposi∣tion, in consequence of the advices he received touching the situation and the state of the place he was determined to attack. Notwithstanding all the dispatch he could make in the night, he found him∣self overtaken by day-light, before he could reach Valencia; so that he was obliged to lay aside the disposition he had made, and advance with the ca∣valry at full gallop, in hope of surprising the place. He accordingly entered the town sword in hand, dispersed the guards that were in the great square, and occupied the ends of the streets, having met with little or no resistance. Some desperate parties attacked the regiment when it was formed in the square; but they were all killed or taken. When the grenadiers came up, they sustained some loss by siring from the windows, which however soon ceas∣ed, when the brigadier declared that he would set fire to the town at the four quarters of it, if they would not desist. A detachment of dragoons being

A British serjeant and six men only, falling in with a subal∣tern of the enemy, at the head of twenty-five dra∣goons, unbroken and prepared for action, killed six, made all the rest prisoners, and took the horses of the whole party. Major-general Don Michael d'Iruniberri, and Kalanca his aid-de-camp, one co∣lonel with his adjutant, two captains, seventeen su∣balterns, fifty-nine soldiers, with three pair of co∣lours, a great quantity of arms and ammunition, fell into the hands of the victor, who brought away hostages for the care of the wounded; and the pay∣ment of the king's revenue for one year, which he exacted as a consideration for having spared the town and convents. Lieutenant colonel Somer∣ville, lord Pulteney, and major Singleton, distin∣guished themselves in this action, which cost the British troops but one lieutenant, one serjeant, and three men killed, with ten horses, and about twenty private men wounded. The information which the count had received about the magazine, was groundless; but the Spanish major-general d'Iruni∣berri was to have entered Alentejo in a few days, with a considerable detachment, and when taken was actually employed in reconnoitering the en∣trance into that province.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disposi∣tion of the ene∣my at Vil∣la-velha.</NOTE> This was not the only spirited exploit performed by the British troops in Portugal, nor the sole occasion upon which brigadier Burgoyne displayed his gal∣lantry and good conduct. The Spanish army, now commanded by the Conde de Aranda, having lest garrisons in Almeyda and Castel Rodrigo, marched
<PB N="63" REF="640"/>
by Alsayates to Castel Branco; and this motion<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> obliged the count de la Lippe to abandon his strong camp at Ponte de Murcella in the Beira, from whence he marched back into Estremadoura. On the eighteenth day of September, he arrived at Abrantes; and lord Loudon, with a separate corps, encamped at Sardoal in the neighbourhood. The business now was to prevent the Spaniards from forcing a passage through the mountains in their front, and from crossing the river Tagus at Villa-velha. For these purposes the marshal count de la Lippe ordered the count St. Jago, with four battalions, six companies of grenadiers, and a regi∣ment of cavalry, to occupy the strong pass of Al∣vito, which had been esteemed impregnable; and brigadier general Burgoyne, with part of his own regiment, the royal volunteers, and the English grenadiers, encamped on the southern bank of the Tagus, over-against Villa-velha, where the great road from Castel Branco crosses the river into Alentejo. Such was the disposition, when the enemy, on the first day of October, made several movements towards both these advanced bodies; they placed six thousand men over-against the corps of the count St. Jago, and attacked upon his right the old Moorish castle of Villa-velha, at the same time assaulting a post upon his left, commanded by a major at the defile of St. Simon. Though briga∣dier Burgoyne for several days protected the castle of Villa-velha, by his cannon across the river, it was at length reduced, and the post of St. Simon taken: the enemy likewise made themselves masters of the passes of the mountains; so that the corps com∣manded

His lord∣ship immediately advanced with great expedition by the shortest road through the mountains, to Soubrira-formosa, where he was joined by major Macbean of the artillery, with four regimental field pieces. The enemy, perceiving their intention to retreat, detached a strong body over the river Al∣vito, to harrass the rear-guard, which was formed of four English regiments, six companies of Portu∣guese grenadiers, a few light dragoons, a regiment of Portuguese cavalry, with the four field pieces, the whole under his lordship's command. The re∣treat was conducted with such good order and countenance, that not a man was lost, notwith∣standing all the efforts of the enemy, who, being much galled by the artillery, thought proper to de∣sist, while the forces of Portugal continued their march unmolested towards Cardegas.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beat up the ene∣my's quarters.</NOTE> The enemy, on account of these motions, having weakened their corps at Villa-velha, brigadier Bur∣goyne seized this favourable opportunity to beat up their quarters. He directed lieutenant-colonel Lee, with a detachment of British troops, to ford the Tagus in the night, and fall upon the Spanish camp. This gallant officer executed the plan with equal spirit and success, while the brigadier pointed his cannon, and made a false attack on the other side, to amuse and distract the enemy. The colonel

The enemy being at length alarmed, began to make a confused and irregular defence; but being vigorously pushed by the grenadiers and volunteers, who used their bayonets without firing, they found it impossible to form, and were obliged to submit. The only part of them that made a regular stand was a body of horse, which lieutenant Maitland, at the head of Burgoyne's dragoons, attacked and routed in a few minutes. Most of the Spanish officers, including a brigadier-general, were slain in endea∣vouring to rally their troops. Four cannon were spiked up in their camp: their magazines were de∣stroyed; some prisoners were taken, together with a good number of horses and mules, and a consi∣derable quantity of valuable baggage. The loss of the English on this occasion, did not exceed ten men and horses. Immediately after this atchieve∣ment, the count de la Lippe, finding it impossible to defend the passes of the mountains, assembled his forces at Macao.</P>

At the same time they dismantled the fortifications of Almeida, Castel-Rodrigo, and

Their East India factors had published a detail of the mutual hostilities which had been committed in the river of Bengal; and this piece, which was artfully written in order to lay the blame of aggression upon the English, was fully refuted by an answer published at London, under the sanction of authentic docu∣ments. At length the directors of the Dutch company proposed an accommodation. The pro∣posal was embraced by the English directors, and a deputation of merchants from Amsterdam were sent over to London for this purpose, which was

happily accomplished. The merchants of Holland<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> still murmured at the capture of their ships by the English cruisers, and, in the course of this year, loudly complained that their neutrality was again violated by a British sloop, which drove on shore and destroyed a French privateer on the coast of Scheveling: but the States were too wife to enter into the resentments of the people; they knew their merchants had provoked this treatment, by carry∣ing on a contraband commerce ever since the be∣ginning of the war, in favour of the enemies of Great-Britain; nor would they allow such a petty insult as that of the British cruiser, to come in com∣petition with the friendship of the British monarch, which, therefore, they continued assiduously to cultivate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Internal state of France.</NOTE> The internal state of France was still disquieted by the dispute between the parliaments and the Jesuits.

The edict issued by the king for suspending the execution of the sentence against the Jesuits, the parliaments refused to re∣gister.

Nevertheless, they still continued to sell their merchandize for ready money, until a guard was plated upon their college in the Ruë St. Ja∣ques; and places were appointed for taking infor∣mations<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expulsion of the Jesuits.</NOTE> concerning their effects. In a word, they were now grown into such disgrace with the people in general, and the clamour against them grew so loud, that the king found it convenient to give them up. All their colleges were seized; all their effects confiscated; and, with respect to France, the order itself was annihilated. Notwithstanding this persecution, which was certainly founded on justice, it must be owned, that the society hath produced a great number of men who have distin∣guished themselves by very useful improvements in the arts and sciences: that many of them have devoted their lives to the service of religion with a truly apostolical piety, encountering difficulties, hardships, mutilation, and martyrdom, with the most surprising fortitude; and that in general they exerted themselves in the education of youth with great judgment, astonishing perseverance, and re∣markable success: but their ambition, art, and in∣fluence, as well as some pernicious doctrines they

One Francis Rochette, a protestant minister at Mont<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣ban, being apprehended and carried before the judge at Caussade, was interrogated upon oath, touching his profession, and owning the truth, was loaded with irons and committed to a dungeon.

After having been fired upon by the guards before they had attempted the least violence, and cruelly mangled by dogs set upon them in their re∣treat, all three were apprehended and conveyed to Tholouse, together with Rochette.

<P>This venerable old man, universally esteemed and beloved for his benevolence and integrity, a warm
<PB N="70" REF="710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> friend, a kind master, a tender husband, and indul∣gent father, had several sons, one of whom called Mark-Anthony, a youth of a gloomy disposition, made away with himself in the month of October of the preceding year. He had supped with his father and mother, and brother Peter, together with a young man called La Vaisse, the son of an emi∣nent advocate at Tholouse, who had been invited to pass the evening with Calas. After supper, Mark-Anthony going down stairs, threw a bar across two folding doors of a warehouse, and from thence suspended himself so effectually, that he was dead before any person in the family could suspect his design. He was first discovered by his brother and young La Vaisse, who being shocked at the spec∣tacle, shrieked aloud. The father, alarmed by their cries, ran down stairs, while the mother continued trembling in the passage above, without having strength either to advance or retire. The unhappy old man, seeing the fatal cause of the outcry, rushed forwards, and embracing the body of his son, the bar slipped off the folding doors, and the corpse fell upon the floor. He forthwith loosened the cord in an agony of grief and horror, and, deploring the fate of his child, dispatched his son Peter for a surgeon, exclaiming at the same time, "Save at least the ho∣nour of my family; do not divulge the report that your brother has made away with himself." Mean while the mother, deriving strength from despair, ran down stairs in the utmost distraction, and join∣ing the rest of the family, the house was filled with cries and lamentations, which gathered a croud about the door. The surgeon examining the body
<PB N="71" REF="720"/>
found the mark of the cord about the neck, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> declared that the deceased had been strangled. This declaration no sooner reached the populace in the street, than they began to cry out, that Mark-Anthony Calas intended to abjure the protestant heresy next day; that protestants were bound by the religion they professed, to destroy all their own children who expressed a desire to renounce their errors; that there was an executioner appointed among them for this horrid purpose; that La Vaisse was the person who at present performed this office; that he had, with the assistance of the family, exe∣cuted the unhappy youth; and that the cries which they had heard, were uttered by him in his endea∣vours to resist the assassins. The old man being by this time joined by one or two of his friends, and perceiving the tumult and uproar increasing every moment, dispatched a messenger to the capi∣toul, whose name was David, one of those miscre∣ants, who, for the misfortune of mankind, and to the disgrace of civil government, are sometimes promoted to the chief magistracy. This wretch, equally ignorant, rancorous, and inhuman, had been already alarmed, and adopting immediately all the prejudices of the vulgar, assembled a guard of forty soldiers, with whom he entered the house. The first step he took was to imprison the whole family, together with La Vaisse. Then he ordered the body to be examined by surgeons, who declared, that except the mark of the ligature upon the neck, they perceived no marks of violence; that the hair of the deceased was perfectly smooth and in good order; that his cloaths which he had pulled off
<PB N="72" REF="730"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> were regularly folded up and laid upon the coun∣ter; and that his shirt was neither torn <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or un∣buttoned. Notwithstanding these marks of the fa∣ther's innocence, this ignorant bigot committed the old man and his son Peter to a dark dungeon; or∣dering at the same time the mother, La Vaisse, the servant maid Janeton, with one Casin, a friend of the family who had come in upon hearing the out∣cries, to be confined in a separate prison; while the dead body was carried to the Hotel-de-ville, or town∣house. Next day the verbal process being taken, and no evidence appearing to the prejudice of the family, the implacable and iniquitous capitoul had recourse to a monitory, which was published, invit∣ing all persons who knew any particular of the affair, to give testimony against the perpetrators of the supposed murder. In this monitory, the infa∣mous magistrate recited, as undubitable truths, that the protestants were in the constant practice of putting to death their children when they seemed bent upon renouncing their errors; that La Vaisse was the person employed in these executions; that Mark▪Anthony Calas certainly intended to abjure his heresy; and was therefore cruelly murdered with the assistance of his own parents. We know not whether it reflects more disgrace upon human nature in general, or upon the French nation in particular, that such an execrable caitiff should, with impunity, publish those atrocious calumnies against a set of people, who, of all religionists, have ever approved themselves the most tolerating, liberal, and humane. Even before the monitory was issued, he took care to in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ame the minds of the populace,
<PB N="73" REF="740"/>
by directing that the body should be buried in St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> Stephen's church, with a solemn funeral procession of the White Penitents. They afterwards performed a solemn service for him in their chapel. The church was hung with white, and on a tomb erect∣ed in the middle of it was placed a human skeleton, holding in one hand a paper inscribed, <HI>Abjuration of heresy;</HI> and in the other, a palm, as the emblem of martyrdom. The Franciscans followed their example; so that it is no wonder that the minds of the superstitious vulgar were inflamed to the most savage degree of animosity against the unfortunate Calas. Though the monitory produced no proof, the capitoul brought the whole family to tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al, when, in defiance of all probability and presumption of innocence, he condemned to the torture the father, mother, brother, friend, and even the maid servant, who was known to be a rigid catholic: as for Ca∣sin, he was set at liberty, on proving that he had not entered the house until the son was strangled and dead. From this dreadful sentence, the priso∣ners appealed to the parliament, which immediately took cognizance of the affair, annulled the pro∣ceedings of the capitoul, as irregular, and conti∣nued the prosecution. They seemed, however, to be actuated by the same spirit of cruelty and fana∣ticism. At the trial, the common executioner of Tholouse gave it as his opinion upon oath, that the son could not possibly have hanged himself as it was alledged, upon the folding doors of the ware∣house; another witness deposed, that looking through the key-hole of the door into a dark room of the prisoner's house, he saw several men running
<PB N="74" REF="750"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> hastily to and fro, with marks of eagerness and tre∣pidation: a third declared he had been informed by his wife, that a woman called Mandril had as∣sured her, from the information of a certain person unknown, that the cries of Mark-Anthony Calas were heard at the farther end of the city. Such was the evidence that, in the opinion of this vile tribunal, weighed against the characters of old Ca∣las and his family; their grief, distraction, and eagerness to discover the death of their son, which they were supposed to have effected; against the testimony of their maid servant, who had given very extraordinary proofs of her attachment to the catholic religion; against the disposition of the de∣ceased, who was proved to have been subject to fits of melancholy, to have frequently argued in favour of suicide, though he was never known to harbour the least doubts about his own religion, or to have uttered the least expression in favour of the Roman catholic faith. On the contrary, he had chosen to forfeit all the advantages arising from the practice of the law to which he had been bred, rather than demand a certificate from the curé, without which he could not exercise his profession; because he thought such certificates, though usually demanded and given, implied an difference towards the pro∣testant religion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A protestant, before he can fill any post, of exercise any civil profession in France, must produce a certificate of his having been at confession; and such certificates are fre∣quently purchased of some mercenary curé, by persons who have neither abjured nor confessed.</NOTE>. One La Bordé, who presided at
<PB N="75" REF="760"/>
the trial, and seems to have espoused all the popu∣lar<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> prejudices, voted that old Calas should suffer the torture, ordinary and extraordinary, for the dis∣covery of his accomplices; then be broken alive upon the wheel; to remain in this dreadful fituation for two hours before he should receive the final stroke; and that his body should be burned to ashes. This opinion was espoused by the majority: one member only had sense, candour, and spirit enough to vote that the prisoner should be ac∣quitted. As for the supposed accomplices, their fate was suspended until they should see the result of the torture in the father's confession: a circum∣stance which throws the most glaring absurdity on the face of their proceedings; for, if the father was guilty, the others could not possibly be innocent. This venerable martyr bore his fate with such pri∣mitive simplicity of piety and fortitude, as even ex∣cited the admiration of his persecutors. He uttered but one shriek when he received the first stroke, after which he made no complaint. While he lay stretched upon the wheel, expecting the last favour of the executioner, he made a fresh declaration of his innocence, expressing at the same time a chari∣table regard for the judges by whom he had been condemned. In this deplorable situation he was again insulted by the furious capitoul, who, with an implacability truly infernal, not only feasted his rancour in viewing the agonies of this innocent victim, but, advancing to the wheel, exclaimed, "Wretch, behold the faggots which will reduce thy body to ashes: now is the time to confess the truth." To this shocking address the old man
<PB N="76" REF="770"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> made no reply; but, turning aside his head, was delivered from his misery by the last st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke of the executioner. The behaviour of this worthy man, from the moment of his condemnation to his last breath, was so composed and exemplary, that father Bourges, a Dominican professor of divinity, and father Caldagues his colleague, who were appointed to attend and assist him in his last moments, be∣stowed the warmest e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>logiums on his memory, de∣claring themselves edified by his manly fortitude and christian charity. The judges thought fit to suppress the trial: but, that they might act with uniform absurdity through the whole affair, they banished the son Peter for life, and released the rest of the prisoners. If La V <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse was innocent, his evidence ought to have been admitted in favour of the old man, whom he had never left one moment during the whole transaction; in which case the unfortunate Calas must have been honourably ac∣quitted. The hapless widow and the other sufferers had recourse to the clemency of the king, who or∣dered the proceedings to be revised by the council of state at Versailles, that in case Calas should be found innocent, the sentence might be reversed, and the family restored to the character and rights of which it had been so unjustly deprived: but, in order to vindicate their country from the reproach of such barbarity and oppression, it were to be wished they had contrived some method for inflict∣ing exemplary punishment on the authors of such infamous proceedings.</P>

In the mean time, exclusive of their schemes in Portugal, they resolved to make fresh efforts in Westphalia, and actually formed a camp in the neighbourhood of Dunkirk, with a view to keep the coast of Eng∣land in continual alarm; but this expedient had at present very little effect. At the same time several communities of the kingdom engaged to build ships of war for the king's service; and large sums were subscribed by individuals for the same pur∣pose. After the conclusion of the last campaign, the court of Versailles became the scene of in∣trigues, between the prince of Soubise and the mar∣shal duke de Broglio, who accused each other, and, in all appearance, were both equally guilty of having retarded and impeded the operations of the last campaign, by their mutual jealousies and animo∣sity. In this civil contest, the prince de Soubise, being supported by the interest of madame de Pom∣padour, gained a complete victory over his rival, who was deprived of his command, and, together with his brother, banished from court, to the great mortification of the people, who considered the marshal as a general of superior talents.

The neglect of these measures, and even the delay of the flota, which was not yet arrived, form a strong presumption that the rupture with England was not premeditated; and that the last negotiation was founded on a sincere desire of peace.

Whatever moderation the house of Austria affected on this occasion, it was not with∣out a sanguine hope of terminating the war greatly to its advantage, now that she was in possession of Schweidnitz, the key of Silesia, and her allies the Russians had acquired a sea-port in the Baltic, and established their winter-quarters in Pomerania. In∣deed, at this period, the king of Prussia, notwith∣standing all his activity, experience, and resources, seemed to totter on the brink of ruin; therefore could not be supposed any longer averse to peace, especially as a change was made in the system of Great Britain, which had been hitherto so favoura∣ble to his designs.</P>

Elizabeth, empress of Russia, daughter of the Czar Peter Alexiowitz, died on the second day of January, in the sixty-third year of her age. She was a princess of moderate talents, who had governed Russia with an easy sway, maintaining at the same time its importance among the nations, by a numerous army and well regulated oeconomy.

In her pri∣vate character she was not cruel; but particular

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> foibles of mind and constitution are said to have hurried her into certain excesses, which, towards the latter part of her life, exposed her to the con∣tempt of her subjects. The political interest of her empire coincided with her personal animosity, in the war with Prussia, by which alone she could have any reasonable prospect of making such an esta∣blishment in Germany, as should give her a title to interfere in the affairs of the empire; an object which had ever engrossed the attention and influenced the conduct of her father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Succes∣sion of the Czar Peter III.</NOTE> She was succeeded on the throne by her nephew Charles-Peter Ulric, a prince of the house of Hol∣stein, who had been created grand duke of Russia, and declared heir apparent to that empire. This new Czar, who ascended the throne by the name of Peter III. was a prince of weak intellects, whose conduct had been ever unguarded and irregular. Though he had renounced the protestant faith, and embraced the Greek religion, when he was called as successor to the crown of Muscovy, he made no secret of his contempt of the Russian ceremonies, and seized all opportunities of mortifying their clergy. He had espoused a princess of the house of Anhalt-Zerbst, by whom he had a son living: but he lived upon ill terms with his consort, who was subtle, insinuating, politic, vindictive, and re∣solute; and this division in his private family was the chief source of his misfortunes. He openly maintained an amorous correspondence with the countess of Woronzoff: and his remarkable attach∣ment to this lady furnished a pretext for dissusing a report that he intended to raise her to the throne,

after having confined his empress to a convent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> Whatever his views might have been in this respect, he certainly began his reign under the most favour∣able auspices, acting, in many particulars, on the most prudential maxims that the most sagacious prince could have espoused. He ensranchised the Russian noblesse, declaring, that for the future, they should be intitled to the same rank and privileges that were enjoyed by the noblesse in any other country of Europe. He recalled count Biron, count Munich, and count Lestock, who had been banished to Siberia, for their adherence to the In∣fant Czar John, son of the princess of Mecklen∣bourg, dethroned at the accession of the last em∣press. He abolished the private chancery, which was a sort of state-inquisition, and lightened the burthen of some taxes on the necessaires of life, which were very grievous to the body of his peo∣ple. These were undoubtedly very popular mea∣sures, and would have produced happy effects in his favour, had not they been overbalanced by other parts of his conduct, which savoured strongly of caprice and temerity. On the very threshold of his administration, he discovered a childish admiration of his Prussian majesty. He forthwith concluded a suspension of arms with that monarch. He sol∣licited and received a commission in the Prussian army: he was already a knight of the Prussian or∣der, the badge of which he constantly wore. He appeared publicly in the Prussian uniform, to the unspeakable mortification of the Russian guards, who, like the praetorian cohorts at Rome, had effected the last revolution; and he introduced
<PB N="82" REF="830"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> the Prussian discipline into his army, who did not, without murmuring, adopt the manners and exer∣cise of a nation, which they had so long and so lately detested and opposed as their most inveterate enemies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His paci∣fic decla∣ration to his allies.</NOTE> As early as the month of February, he delivered to the Imperial, French, Polish, and Swedish mi∣nisters at Petersburg, a declaration, in writing, ex∣pressing his desire of putting an end to the effusion of blood; announcing his readiness to sacrifice to this aim the conquests which the arms of Russia had made; exhorting his allies to imitate his mode∣ration, and employ all their power to re-establish the peace of Europe. In answer to this declara∣tion, the empress-queen prosessed a disposition to concur with him in such a desirable work, desiring he would impart to her any proposals of peace which he might have received, that she and the rest of the allies might co-operate with his laudable design, provided the terms were such as her honour would admit. The answer of the French king was much to the same purpose; and he moreover ob∣served, that no duty was more incumbent on a prince, than a punctual performance of engage∣ments, and a scrupulous fidelity to allies. The king of Poland proposed a general congress for treating of a pacification. He reminded the Czar that Saxony had been attacked and ruined meerly on account of its connexion with the Russian em∣pire; and expressed his hope of the Czar's taking care that, in the first place, his electorate should be evacuated by those enemies who had reduced it to the brink of ruin, by exorbitant contributions, as

well as by the alienation of revenues and funds ap∣propriated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to the payment of public debts formerly contracted. As for Sweden, she had never entered heartily into the war, and now adopted without re∣gret the pacific sentiments of Russia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His trea∣ty with the king of Prussia.</NOTE> The Czar, however, payed very little regard to the remonstrances made by the other powers of the confederacy. On the fifth day of May, a treaty of peace between Russia and Prussia was signed at Petersburg; another between Prussia and Sweden was ratified on the twenty-fifth of the same month; and this produced a reconciliation between his Prussian majesty and the duke of Mecklenburg. In consequence of these events, all the Prussian troops employed in Pomerania, Brandenburg, and the country of Mecklenburg, were at liberty to join their king in Silesia, or his brother in Saxony. This was not all the advantage which the Prussian monarch derived from his treaty with the Czar. The body of Russian troops commanded by general Czernichew, which had hitherto acted as auxilia∣ries to the Austrians, were ordered to join the Prus∣sian army, and this junction was actually effected; so that one compaign saw them serve in opposite interests, committing hostilities against their former friends, in favour of those whom they had hitherto combated with all the marks of implacable animo∣sity. While the emperor of Russia thus cultivated the good graces of his Prussian ally, whom he actally proposed to visit in person, he did not allow this object to engross his whole attention. <NOTE PLACE="marg">He re∣solves up∣on a war with Den∣mark.</NOTE></P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> Denmark, in order to recover the entire dominion and revenue of Holstein, his native country, which was shared by the Danish king, whose claim, tho' originally oppressive, had been confirmed by a treaty. The Czar considered the treaty itself as an oppression, in which the necessity of his father's affairs had obliged him to acquiesce; and now he resolved to employ the power of Russia to vindicate the independency of his hereditary dominions.</P>
<P>The king of Denmark, without suffering himself to be dismayed by the power of his adversary, be∣gan to make preparations for defending himself against the impending storm. He augmented his army and navy, putting his frontiers in a posture of defence; and well-knowing that money formed the sinews of war, he fell upon a method of obtain∣ing a considerable sum, which perhaps it would not be found an easy task to justify. He had ever kept alive his pretensions to a claim of sovereignty over the city of Hamburgh, which being, at this period, enriched in consequence of the war in Ger∣many, he forthwith resolved to lay under contribu∣tion. In the month of June, he suddenly appeared at their gates at the head of a strong body of forces, and seizing the suburbs, demanded an immediate loan of a million of rix-dollars, on pain of investing them with a l the horrors of war. The magistrates being in no condition to support a siege, assembled the senate, and after due deliberation, they deter∣mined to grant the supply which his Danish majesty required. Their compliance was followed by the immediate retreat of their disagreeable guests.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762. He dis∣obliges the sub∣jects of Russia.</NOTE> While the king of Denmark took those bold and vigorous measures for the support of his own in∣terest, the Czar continued to shock the prejudices, and excite the indignation of his Russian subjects. He was seized with a rash spirit of resormation, which is a rock upon which a prince will infallibly split, unless he is sustained by uncommon courage and a well established authority. In all probability he was fired with the ambition of imitating the first Peter, who shone more illustrious as the resormer of his barbarous subjects, than as the conqueror of the Swedish monarch: but then he did not begin his innovations, until he had attained the very summit of reputation and authority, by his wonderful con∣duct and capacity, and impressed the minds of his subjects with the most sublime ideas of his character. The present Czar was a foreigner by birth, a cir∣cumstance always unfavourable for a prince in the opinion of his subjects; and he was at no pains to conceal his predilection for his native country. To this object he now sacrificed the conquests and the interests of Russia. In distinguishing the Holstein guards by his particular favour and attention, he disgusted and incensed the Russian guards, who had been remarkably cultivated by the late Czarina, as the troops to whom she owed her elevation to the throne. He not only caressed the Holstein guards, but he promoted officers of that country in his ser∣vice, and was said to discover, on all occasions, an impolitic partiality for foreigners in general. To these articles of misconduct, he added another of still more dangerous consequence. He incurred the resentment of the clergy, first, by his contemp∣tuous
<PB N="86" REF="870"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> indifference for the Greek religion: secondly, by making certain regulations in their churches, touching their images and pictures: thirdly, in de∣priving the priests of their beards, which they did not resign without rage and horrer: and lastly, by seizing upon the revenues belonging to the bishops and monasteries, and inferior clergy, for which he allowed mean pensions that did not amount to one third of their former income. Having thus disgusted his army, disobliged his nobles, exasperated his clergy, and injured his conduct, he could not fail to incur the danger of a conspiracy, in a country of sa∣vages prone to vengeance and accustomed to revo∣lution.</P>

A conspiracy was accordingly formed by Rosa∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sky, hetman, or chief of the Cossacks, who are generally employed on such occasions, in conjunc∣tion with Panin, who was governor to the great duke, mareshal Butturlin, the chamberlain Tep∣low, the attorney-general Glebow, baron Orlow, major of the guards, and some of the nobility. They communicated their designs to the clergy,
<PB N="87" REF="880"/>
who contributed all their influence towards the de∣position<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> of a prince whom they dreaded and detested. They secured the concurrence of the guards and other forces in the neighbourhood of Petersburg; they held consultations for taking all the previous steps for the execution of their plan; and at length the senate and clergy were actually assembled to pass the sentence of the Czar's deposition, before that unfortunate prince had the least intimation of their design; a certain proof that the affections of his subjects were wholly alienated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He is de∣posed, and she as∣cends the throne.</NOTE> On the twenty-eighth day of June, the empress being at her own country seat of Petershoff, in the skirts of Petersburg, received intelligence that the design was declared. She sorthwith mounted a horse, and riding at full speed to the capital, har∣rangued the guards, who immediately proclaimed her empress of all the Russias, by the name of Ca∣therine II. declaring, at the same time, her husband dethroned. After this ceremony, she repaired to the church of Kasansky, where, divine service be∣ing performed, the senate and the grandees, includ∣ing the conspirators, took the oath of allegiance. Then she appeared on horseback, in the uniform of the guards, and putting herself at the head of the forces, began her march for the country palace of Oranjebaum, where the Czar had been for some days indulging his indolence in the most profound security. He had that very day, however, gone to Petershoff, in order to dine with the empress; and understanding that she had set out early in the morning for Petersburg, he dispatched several cou∣riers, one after another, to know the cause of her
<PB N="88" REF="890"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> departure. These did not return; but some sol∣diers, disguised like peasants, arrived at Petershoff, and informed him of what had happened. In the first hurry of his trepidation, he embarked in a yacht for Cronstadt, in hope of escaping by sea; but finding the gates shut against him, he returned to Oranjebaum, and made some preparations for de∣fence. He assembled some peasants, and began to throw up an intrenchment, which he declared he would defend with his Holstein guards: but, the empress advancing at the head of ten thousand re∣gular forces, with a train of artillery, his guards were dismayed, and threw down their arms. In this situation, he had nothing to do but to submit: he delivered his sword to an officer, whom the em∣press had sent with a message, exhorting him to sub∣mission; and being put in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a coach, was conducted to Petershoff. His behaviour on this occasion was weak and pussilanimous. He, in a letter to the empress, renounced the reins of government, and all pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons to the empire, intreating leave to re∣turn to Holstein, with the countess of Woronzoff, and one single friend. This, however, was a favour which she could not grant with any regard to her own interest; and his mentioning the countess was an insult upon her honour. He was required to sign an unconditional resignation of the crown; and he actually signed a paper prepared for this pur∣pose, which was immed ately made public. In this he acknowledged his own incapacity to govern Russia: that his misconduct must have not only covered himself with disgrace; but likewise have occasioned the total ruin of the empire: he therefore
<PB N="89" REF="900"/>
abdicated the throne, declaring, before God, that his<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> abdication was not the effect of compulsion; but of the sense he had of his own unworthiness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peter dies suddenly in prison.</NOTE> Having thus acted as the assassin of his own cha∣racter, he was sequestred from all communication, and committed to close prison, where he did not long languish in the horrors of captivity. In seven days he was released by death; and no body was surprised at the event, which was indeed the natural consequence of his deposition. The new empress was no sooner proclaimed, than she published a short manifesto, implying, that she had ascended the throne, at the earnest desire of the people, to save the empire from that ruin to which it was exposed from the misconduct and pernicious principles of her husband. She observed, that the foundations of the orthodox Greek religion had been shaken; and that there was great reason to fear a design had been formed to introduce a foreign faith into the empire: that the glory of Russia had been trampled under foot by the late peace with its most invete∣rate enemy; and that the domestic regulations of the country had been totally overturned. At the same time, formal notice of her accession to the throne was given to all the foreign ministers at Petersburg.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Declara∣tion of the new empress.</NOTE> In a few days after this strange revolution, an∣other manifesto appeared, which in fact was a most virulent satire on the character of the deposed Czar, whose foibles and misconduct were painted in the most glaring colours of exaggeration. In this de∣tail of his errors and vices, he was likewise charged with a design upon the life of the empress; as well

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> as with a settled scheme for setting aside the succes∣sion of his own son; though no facts were specified to give a probability either to the one or to the other. Finally, Catherine II. thought it conve∣nient to appeal once more to the public, on occa∣sion of her husband's death. She declared that he was carried off by a haemorrhoidal discharge, to which he had been formerly subject: that his de∣cease had overwhelmed her with affliction; and that she had ordered his body to be buried in the monastery of Newsky. She exho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted her faithful subjects to pay the last duties to his remains; to pray to God for the repose of his soul; and to con∣sider his death as a special effect of the Divine Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>Whether these declarations are of weight suffi∣cient to influence the reflections which must have occurred to every sensible mind, upon this remark∣able event, we shall not pretend to determine. We shall only observe, that Peter seems to have been weak, but not wicked, and therefore might have been reclaimed or restricted, without forfeiting the crown. He might have been removed from the throne, without suffering any violence in his person. Though the murder of a weak sovereign may, perhaps, be justified by the savage policy of a bar∣barous nation, it will ever be deemed a detestable act, by every person of sentiment and humanity; and it is the duty of an historian, to fix the mark of eternal infamy upon the perpetrators, howso∣ever dignified they may be by the success of usur∣pation.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> The Czarina being, by the death of her husband, freed from the dread of competition, began her reign with such measures as were well adapted to the establishment of her throne. She ingratiated herself with her new subjects, by sending away the Holstein-guards, and dismissing all the foreigners from her service. She restored the clergy to their possessions, and allowed their beards to grow with∣out molestation. She made particular court to the Russian guards, and often wore their regimentals, in imitation of the late empress; and she conferred all the great posts of the empire on the natives of Mus∣covy. In her first manifesto she seems to have espoused the resentments of the Russian people, who were generally averse to his Prussian majesty: but, upon further deliberation, it was found convenient to avoid a foreign war, and concentrate all her forces in her own dominions, in case of any domes∣tic disturbance, or attempt against her government. She therefore determined to keep measures with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">She ad∣heres to the peace with Prus∣sia.</NOTE> Prussian monarch, to whose ministers she declared her resolution to observe inviolably the peace con∣cluded with him under the preceding reign; though at the same time she had thought proper to recall her troops from Pomerania and Silesia: this mode∣ration towards the king of Prussia, against whom the Russian senate was much incensed in the be∣ginning, is said to have been owing to the discovery of some letters which the king had written to the late Czar at his accession. They contained so much wholesome advice, and exhorted him so warmly to respect his consort, as well as to consult the true in∣terests of his empire, that the animosity of the

This may have had some effect in strengthening the other substantial reasons for avoid∣ing fresh hostilities with Prussia; and in all proba∣bility they were corroborated by the remonstrances and advices of Great Britain, with whose monarch the Czarina was connected by the ties of consan∣guinity.</P>

On the other hand, the Imperial and Saxon troops dislodged the Prussians in February, from the post of Lamatch, and burned the magazine which had been transported thither from Magdeburg. In the beginning of May, this active prince unex∣pectedly passing the Mulda in three columns, at Roswen, Dolbeling, and Leisnig, surprised the left wing of the Imperial and Austrian army; on which occasion, general Zetwitz was taken, with twelve officers, fifteen hundred men, and three pieces of cannon.

Thus rein∣forced, his majesty took possession of the heights of Sackwitz; and this motion obliged count Daun to retire in the night to the hills of Kuntzendorff. The king continued to advance, and dislodged the Austrians from several hills; but his attack upon the hill of Engel, defended by general Brentano, proved ineffectual. Count Daun, however, thought proper to decamp from Kuntzendorff, and take post at Tanhausen, in order to protect his maga∣zine at Freidland, and preserve his communication with Bohemia, into which the Prussian general Weid actually penetrated with a detachment, as far as Weisse. Marshal Daun no sooner abandoned the hills of Kuntzendorff, than they, together with the heights of Ziesken and Justenstein, were occu∣pied by the Prussian forces; thus all communication was cut off between Schweidnitz and the Austrian army.

Schweidnitz was undoubtedly strong, both by nature and art, and moreover defend∣ed by a numerous garrison, who exerted themselves with courage and activity: but such was the deter∣mined resolution of the besieger, and so formidable was the provision he had made for this enterprize, that the Austrian general thought it necessary to make some bold attempt to disturb him in his ope∣tations. The Prussian infantry were encamped on the heights behind Schweidnitz. The cavalry formed a chain in the plains of Keintzerdorff, extending to a detached corps, under the prince of Wirtemberg, so situated as to prevent any interruption from the county of Glatz; and the prince of Bevern, with another strong corps, was encamped at Guttmans∣dorff near Reickenbach.</P>

In the beginning of No∣vember, the king of Prussia joined his brother in Saxony, leaving a strong garrison in Schweidnitz, under the command of major-general Knoblock, and his army in Silesia, to the conduct of the prince of Bevern, whose camp formed a chain on the mountains from Steinfeissendorff to Borsdorff, while part of the cavalry encamped on the plain. Gene∣ral Werner was detached with a small corps into the Upper Silesia. As for marshal Daun, he sent a large detachment into the same country, and rein∣forced the Austrian troops in Saxony, he himself remaining at Scharssnick, in the county of Glatz. Immediately after the victory at Freyberg, a de∣tachment of Prussians, under the command of general Kleist, made an irruption into Bohemia, ravaging the country to the very gates of Prague, and destroyed several Austrian magazines of great value.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suspen∣sion of hostilities in Silesia.</NOTE> The consternation occasioned by the success of this partisan, in all probability induced the court of Vienna to acquiesce in a suspension of arms, pro∣posed by the king of Prussia, for the respective

armies in Silesia, to remain in force during the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> winter. This being accordingly concluded, the Austrian and Imperial troops retired into their win∣ter quarters, in hope of enjoying some repose, which, however, was of very short duration.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contri∣butions raised by the Prus∣sians.</NOTE> General Kleist immediately marched at the head of a strong body of forces into Franconia, where he compelled a great number of men to engage in the king's service, and laid the whole country under exorbitant contributions. From the city of Nu∣remberg alone, they exacted three hundred thousand crowns, and carried off from thence twelve fine brass cannon, with six waggon loads of arms and ammunition. The king, being resolved on these measares, had declared by his minister to the diet assembled at Ratisbon, that as all his former re∣monstrances to the states of the empire had pro∣duced no effect, he was determined to employ more effectual means to make them recall their troops from the Austrian army: that he had ordered one body of his forces to enter Franconia; another to take the route of Suabia, and a third to penetrate into Bavaria: that they should every where conduct themselves according to the exigencies of war: but that the diet of the empire should not be disturbed. The contributions raised in the course of these in∣cursions are said to have amounted to the sum which he had for some years annually received as a subsidy from the court of Great Britain.</P>
<P>Had the states of the empire acted with that vi∣gour which their situation required, they would not have confined themselves to the ineffectual propor∣tions of troops, which they were obliged to furnish

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> by the constitutions of the empire; but they would have exerted their whole power in restraining within proper bounds a formidable prince, who payed so little regard to the liberties of his co-estates and the tranquillity of the empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cam∣paign in West∣phalia.</NOTE> In Westphalia, the campaign was also fruitful of events, and productive of much bloodshed, some of which might have been spared, if more regard had been payed to the dictates of reason and huma∣nity. The design of the enemy was to keep pos∣session of Hesse, and extend their conquests into the electorate of Hanover, where they still retained the town of Goettingen, which they had been at great pains and expence to fortify. The business of prince Ferdinand was to stop their progress, and if possible, drive them back to the banks of the Mayne.</P>
<P>In the beginning of March, before the armies took the field, a detachment of four thousand men from the French garrison of Goettingen, made a forced march to the posts of Gittel and Kahlfeldt, in hope of surprising the east chain of the allied cantonments; but the troops retired from these places so seasonably, that the enemy could only make a small impression on their rear, and next day returned to their quarters. Immediately after this attempt, the east chain of the allies was strengthen∣ed by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of three thousand men, who took post at Eimbeck.</P>
<P>In April, general Luckner, a famous Hanoverian partisan, obtained an advantage over the marquis de Lorta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, who had marched out of Goettingen, at the head of eighteen hundred horse and two thousand
<PB N="101" REF="1020"/>
infantry, to intercept the other in one of his excur∣sions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> but Luckner, receiving intelligence of his design, procured a strong reinforcement of horse, with which he fell upon the marquis unexpectedly, and obliged him to retire into Goettingen with great precipitation and considerable loss. About the same time major Wintzingerode, commander of the Hessian hussars, made a party of French irre∣gulars prisoners at Eichsfeld. In the course of the same month, the hereditary prince of Brunswick, at the head of a strong detachment, with a train of ar∣tillery, invested the castle of Arensberg, situated on one of the heads of the Roer, which the French had occupied, in order to preserve a communication be∣tween their forces on the Rhine, and those they had upon the Weser. In a few hours after the batteries of the besiegers began to play, the castle was set on fire, and the flames raged with such vio∣lence, that monsieur de Muret, with his garrison of two hundred and thirty men, were obliged to leap over the walls, and surrender at discretion. After this exploit, the prince made a progress as far as Elvervelt and Solingen, in the neighbourhood of Dusseldorp, and met with considerable success in levying recruits and contributions.</P>
<P>The French generals, Soubise and d'Estrées, ar∣riving at Franckfort in April, assembled their forces in May, on the banks of the Weser, while the prince of Condé commanded a separate army at Dussel∣dorp, on the Lower Rhine. Prince Ferdinand, with the main body of the allies, lay encamped be∣hind the Dymel, to oppose the progress of the two marshals; the hereditary prince was posted with a
<PB N="102" REF="1030"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> considerable corps, in the bishopric of Munster, to watch the motions of the prince of Condé; and ge∣neral Luckner, with a third detachment, encamped near Eimbecke on the Leine, to observe prince Xavier of Saxony, who had taken p st with a corps de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reserve, between the river Weria and the town<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battle of Graeben∣stein.</NOTE> of Gottingen. The French camp of the marshals being si uated between Graebenstein and Mein∣brexen, prince Ferdinand made a disposition for attacking them on the twenty-fourth day of June; and the plan was executed acco dingly. General Luckner, leaving his Hessian hussars to amuse prince Xavier and conceal his route, marched from Hollenstadt on the twenty-third in the morn∣ing, passed the Weser in the evening, and by three o'clock next morning, formed betwe n Marien∣dorff and Udenhausen. At four, general Sporcken passed the Dymel at Sielem, with twelve battalions of Hanoverians, and part of the cavalry of the left wing, and advanced between Nombrexen and U∣denhausen, with a view to attack the enemy's flank at Carlsdorff, while Luckner should charge them in the rear. At the same time prince Ferdinand, passing the river with twelve British battalions, eleven of the Brunswic troops, eight regiments of Hessians, with the English cavalry, and part of the German horse of the left wing, drew them up, in order, behind the ponds of Kalse. The vanguard on the left was formed by the piquets of the army, and that on the right by the chasseurs of the Eng∣l sh, and German infantry, commanded by lord Frederick Cavend sh, and Freytag's Hanoverian chasseurs, who had orders to seize upon the moun∣tain
<PB N="103" REF="1040"/>
of Langenberg. The marquis of Granby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> who commanded the body of the reserve, passed the Dymel at Warburg, and marched by Zierem∣berg and Ziebershausen, upon an eminence opposite to Furstenwalde, in order to fall upon the left wing of the enemy. Though they had no intimation of this design, until the allies were in sight, mon∣sieur de Castries, who commanded an advanc∣ed post at Carlsdorff, retreated to their main army in good order. The marshals finding themselves unexpectedly attacked with great impetuosity in front, slank, and rear, at the same time, were not a little embarrassed, and soon resolved to retire. Their tents were immediately struck, and they be∣gan their retreat, which, considering the ardour with which they were attacked, would in all proba∣bility have ended in a total defeat, had not Mr. de Stainville, at the head of a chosen body, sacrificed them to the safety of the army. This gallant officer threw himself into the woods of Wilhem∣stahl, with the grenadiers of France, the royal gre∣nadiers, the regiment of Aquitaine, and some other troops that constituted the flower of the French in∣fantry. With these he made a noble stand, effectu∣ally covering the retreat of the marshals, who re∣tired under the cannon of Cassel, and part of their forces passed the Fulda in the utmost precipitation. Lord Granby attacked the troops of Stainville with his usual impetuosity; and the whole body was either killed or taken, except two battalions that found means to escape. Upon this occasion the allies took near three thousand prisoners, including two hundred officers, together with some standards

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> and colours; while the loss of the victors did not exceed three hundred men, and no British officer of distinction lost his life, except colonel Townshend, who had behaved with great gallantry in this and several previous actions since the commencement of the war. After all, this victory was of little consequence. No decisive stroke had been struck on either side, since the battle of Hastenbeck.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the ge∣nius of prince Ferdi∣nand.</NOTE> The war chiefly consisted in bush-fighting, the attack of posts, and surprize of quarters. Were the general's honour at all to be questioned, one would be apt to think his aim was to protract, ra∣ther than to terminate, the miseries of his country: but, without all doubt, he exerted his best faculties to bring the war to a conclusion. It is remarkable of this prince, that he seldom advanced to the ene∣my from his own camp, with all his forces assem∣bled. All his schemes of attack tended to sur∣prise. He made his dispositions so that the de∣tached bodies constituting his army should, at an appointed time, move like so many radii from the circumference to the centre, where the attack was to be made; and they had often rivers, mountains, and defiles to pass: consequently they were subject to a variety of accidents, any one of which would have been sufficient to disconcert the whole design. The bridge of a river might break down; or the stream might be rendered un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ordable by a few hours rain. A pass might be suddenly occupied by the enemy: the breaking down of a waggon in a narrow defile might retard the march of the whole body. If the French generals had been vigilant, they would not have allowed themselves to be sur∣prised:
<PB N="105" REF="1060"/>
had they been dextrous in managing their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> private correspondence, they would have received intimation of the design; and, in that case, might have taken such measures as would have proved fatal to the aggressor: had they changed their position, the prince's plan must have miscarried: had they advanced to the right or to the left, and met any one detachment of the allies half way, they might have defeated them all successively, before they could sustain each other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Action in the neigh∣bourhood of Hom∣burg.</NOTE> While the French army remained in their strong camp, under the cannon of Cassel, prince Ferdinand resolved, if possible, to cut off their communication with Franckfort, which was at present maintained by Mr. de Rochambeau, who had taken possession of a strong post near Homburg, with a body of horse and some brigades of infantry. The marquis of Granby and lord Frederick Cavendish advanced to dislodge him at the head of the British grena∣diers, two regiments of English cavalry, four Ha∣noverian squadrons, the chasseurs of the infantry, and the hussars of Bauer and Riedesel. The enemy beginning to retreat as they approached, the mar∣quis ordered his horse to attack their rear, and this service was gallantly performed by the regiment of blues and Elliot's dragoons, led on by the colonels Hervey and Erskine: but the French cavalry sud∣denly facing about, and falling upon them sword in hand, with great resolution, they must have been overpowered by superior number, had not the in∣fantry come up to their relief. Then the French cavalry retired, and were hard pressed by the Bri∣tish g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enadiers and Highlanders; so that they must
<PB N="106" REF="1070"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> have been entirely routed, had not they been sus∣tained by their infantry, which had posted them∣selves in a hollow way. At length they effected their retreat, with the loss of about four hundred men; while the hussars of Bauer and Riedesel, advancing to Rothemburg, destroyed a consider∣able magazine which the enemy had there esta∣blished.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Ferdi∣nand compels the French army to retire from Melsun∣gen.</NOTE> In the month of July, prince Ferdinand formed the resolution of attacking the French marshals in their camp at Melsungen, to which place they had fallen back in order to preserve their communication with Franckfort, and to facilitate their junction with the prince de Condé, who had orders to ad∣vance from the Lower Rhine for that purpose. The general of the allied army, having made his usual exposition for attacking the enemy, passed the Eder on the twenty-fifth, and joined the marquis of Granby on the Heights of Falkenberg: but, ob∣serving the posture of the enemy, he found them too advantageously posted to attack them with any prospect of success. Perceiving, however, that there were signs of confusion among them, he ad∣vanced in columns, and forming at eight in the evening, began to cannonade their camp. At night he retired and repassed the rivers S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hwalm and Eder, leaving the marquis on the Heights of Falkenberg. At the same time the enemy passed the F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lda, and leaving a body of troops under Mr. de Guerchy, opposite to the camp which they abandoned, they retired towards Cassel, while the marquis of Granby took possession of the post of Melsungen. Thus their communication with
<PB N="107" REF="1080"/>
Francfort seemed to be once more cut off. Their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> conduct at this period appears to have been equally irregular and irresolute. They received a new check in the misfortune of Mr. de Stainville, who, marching with four regiments of dragoons towards Rothenburn, fell into an ambuscade at Morschen, where his troops were routed and dispersed by a body of troops, under the command of general Freytag. They now abandoned Goettingen, after having demolished the fortifications of the place, which they themselves had erected at a very great expence. They sent repeated orders to the prince of Condé, to join them without delay; and, in the mean time, they occupied a strong camp on the banks of the Fulda; while prince Ferdinand threw bridges over that river, as if he intended to seize the first opportunity of hazarding another attack. His serene highness seems to have been particularly alert at this juncture, and more eager than ever to give battle, although he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w that the negotiation for peace was already far advanced. Some poli∣ticians maliciously observed, that, finding it im∣practicable to protract the war for his private ad∣vantage, he was resolved to conclude it with some bold stroke that should reflect lustre upon his mili∣tary reputation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prince of Bruns∣wick de∣feated, and dan∣gerously wounded, at Johan∣nesberg.</NOTE> On the sixteenth of July, the prince of Condé began his march from Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sfeldt, in order to join the marshals, and crossed the Lippe at Halteren; but was obliged to take a large circuit, in which he was constantly attended by the hereditary prince of Brunswic, at the head of a strong body detached from the aliied army. On the thirtieth day of
<PB N="108" REF="1090"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An▪ 1762.</NOTE> August, having received advice that a large body of the enemy were on their march to join the prince of Condé, he resolved to attack him before he should be reinforced. The enemy were posted on the mountain of Johannesberg, in the neighbourhood of Rodheim, near the banks of the Wetter. Such was the impetuosity of the assailants, that they were soon driven into the plain below; and here the for∣tune of the day was immediately changed. They were so considerably reinforced from their grand army, which had marched from the Fulda to join the prince of Condé, that the action was renewed with redoubled vigour, and the allies gave way in their turn. They were obliged to repass the Wetter with considerable loss, the prince himself being dangerously wounded by a musket ball that entered his right side a little above the hip-bone; a consi∣derable number were killed on both sides, and about eight hundred of the allies were taken, with seven pieces of cannon. Prince Ferdinand no sooner heard that the hereditary prince was engaged, than he marched from his camp, at Nidda, to support him; and arrived time enough to prevent the enemy from pursuing their advantage. This was the third separate expedition, in which the hereditary prince proved unsuccessful, since the beginning of the war. He was removed to Homburg, and from thence to Munden, where the ball was extracted▪ and he happily recovered.</P>
<P>As prince Ferdinand seemed to have a design upon Cassel, where the French marshals had lest general Diesbach with a numerous garrison; the prince of Condé was employed to open march∣routes
<PB N="109" REF="1100"/>
towards Frankberg, on the Eder, through<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> which they proposed to turn the right of the allied army, passing by the county of Waldeck. Thro' these very roads prince Ferdinand advanced to Wetter, which was evacuated by the French gar∣rison, and the prince of Condé obliged to pass the Lahne. Then the allied army marched to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The allies encamp at Kir∣chayne.</NOTE> Ohme, and took possession of the camp at Kir∣chayne, extending to Ernesthausen, while general Luckner occupied Frankenberg on the Upper Eder. The French marshals having attempted, in vain, to disturb his march, between Horloff and Ohme, passed the Lahne in the neighbourhood of Giessen, and encamped near Marburg: the prince of Condé took post at Gosfeln, and general Levis at Wetter: but this last was dislodged, and their place occupied by a detachment under the generals Luckner and Conway. Many posts were contested on both sides with uncommon vivacity. The ge∣neral of the allies had resolved to lay siege to Cassel; and the enemy made repeated efforts to throw fresh supplies into the place; but they were ef∣fectually prevented by the disposition of his forces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Severe ac∣tion at the Brucker∣muhl, near Ame∣nebourg.</NOTE> Part of the French army, under the generals de Castrees and Saarsfeldt, was posted on one side of the Ohme; and on the other, opposite to them, was a strong detachment of the allies, commanded by the marquis of Granby and general Zastrow, in the neighbourhood of the castle of Amenebourg, which the allies occupied with a garrison of about seven hundred men, under the conduct of captain Cruse. The enemy resolved to make themselves masters of this fortress; and, in order to amuse the
<PB N="110" REF="1110"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> allies, attacked a post which they possessed at the Bruck-r-muhl, for the defence of a bridge over the Ohme. It was defended by a detachment of two hundred men, the greatest part of whom were posted in a small redoubt they had raised for the purpose. On the twenty-first day of September, about six in the morning, the weather being extremely foggy, the enemy attacked the post at the Brucker-muhl with musquetry and some pieces of cannon, having formed a b dy of ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se and infantry on the emi∣nence beyond the bridge. A cannonade immedi∣ately began on both sides, while a warm dispute with small arms was maintained between the assail∣ants and the Hanoverians, who defended the re∣doubt. General Waldegrave, being ordered to support the Brucker-muhl, detached the first bat∣talion of British guards to relieve the Hanoverians, who had by this time susta ned great loss, and ex∣pended all their ammunition. The enemy conti∣nuing to throw fresh troops into a small work, which they had beyond the bridge, and to bring up more cannon; prince Ferdinand also reinforced his artillery with six large cannon, and three how∣itzers from the army; and four Hessian battalions advanced to sustain those who were engaged. Both sides fought with the most determined resolution, and a prodigious fire of artillery and small arms was maintained for fourteen hours, without inter∣mission; yet no attempt was made on either side to pass the bridge. At length the darkness put an end to the action, which cost the allies very near a thousand men killed on the spot The loss of the enemy greatly exceeded that number. Among the
<PB N="111" REF="1120"/>
killed on the side of the allies, was major Maclean<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> of the Highlanders, who had lost his arm at Gua∣dalupe, an officer who had recommended himself to the particular favour of the hereditary prince, by an indefatigable spirit of undaunted intrepidity. Dur∣ing this very warm dispute, the enemy opened some batteries against the castle of Amenebourg; and next day, the breach being practicable, threatened to give the assault, when the commander, being unprovided for further defence, surrendered with his garrison prisoners of war. In consequence of this acquisition, the enemy advanced the right of their camp, and posted a strong body of forces be∣tween Amenebourg and Kleinfeelheim. As it does not appear that they meant any thing else by the at∣tack at the Brucker-muhl, than to divert the atten∣tion of the allies from the defence of Amenebourg; and, as the redoubt was a post of no consequence, this wanton sacrifice of the lives of some thousands of brave men, including many gallant officers who perished in the action, might have been prevented by withdrawing the Hanoverians from the redoubt when the French advanced to the attack; and the castle of Amenebourg, which was of more impor∣tance, perhaps would have been saved, if proper dispositions had been made upon that quarter, which seems to have been wholly neglected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Al∣lies un∣dertake the siege of Cassel, which is reduced.</NOTE> After this sanguinary affair, the French marshals contented themselves with making detachments on the right and left of the allied army, in order to open their communication with Cassel; but all their efforts were rendered abortive by the vigilance and activity of the allied parties, who obtained several
<PB N="112" REF="1130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> advantages over them, between the twenty-seventh of September and the first day of October, when prince Ferdinand's quarters were still at Kerchayn, his army extending on the right to Watzenback, and on the left, behind Merlan. The marshals of France had their right at Merlan, and their left at Caldern. This was the period at which the siege of Cassel was undertaken. The trenches were opened on the sixteenth day of October; and the operations prosecuted with such vigour, that, not∣withstanding the activity and resolution of a very numerous garrison, headed by the baron de Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣bach, they were obliged to capitulate on the first day of November, and marched out with all the honours of war. Prince Ferdinand intended to have closed the campaign with the siege of Ziegen∣hayn, which was the only place in Hesse now pos∣sessed by a French garrison; but his preparations were interrupted by the cessation of arms, which took place immediately after the signing of the pre∣liminaries of the peace between France and Great Britain. The siege of Cassel, undertaken at such an advanced season of the year, could not have cost less than the lives of three thousand men on both sides, over and above a very considerable expence, and the great damage sustained by the city. We will venture to affirm, that the fate of the town could not, in the smallest degree, influence the ar∣ticles of the peace, which were, in a great measure, settled before the siege was undertaken. Had the allies remained in their camp at Kerchayn, without engaging in any new enterprize, the cessation of arms must have taken place in a few weeks, and
<PB N="113" REF="1140"/>
then the French garrison would have quietly evacu∣ated<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> Cassel, without any damage or disturbance to the inhabitants, who now suffered all the horrors of a siege from the cruel ambition of their own allies. Thus were the misfortunes of Hesse compleated by the ruin of its capital.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Deplor∣able state of Hesse-Cassel.</NOTE> This delightful country, which, in cultivation, far exceeded any other province or district of West∣phalia, had been entirely desolated by the savage hand of war. All the inclosures were broke down, and all the plantations destroyed. The farm-houses and villages, having been pillaged by the irregular troops and dragoons of both armies, on pretence of searching for forage, were now wholly abandoned by their wretched inhabitants, great numbers of whom perished for want of sustenance and shelter: troops of helpless old men, women, and children, were seen fainting with hunger, and crying aloud for bread; while others, who had more strength and vigour left, sled from their hapless country, and had recourse to the charity of neighbouring states. At the affair of Willelmstahl, the magnifi∣cent gardens of the landgrave, adorned with statues, temples, fountains, and cascades, had been totally ruined by the artillery of the allies, which played upon the enemy in their retreat. The delightful groves were cut down, for firing to the French soldiery. The elegant apartments of the palace were disfurnished, defaced, and defiled, by the wan∣ton insolence and brutal indelicacy of their officers, who converted them into lodging rooms, kitchens, and kennels; and, during the siege of Cassel, great part of the city was demolished and laid waste by

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Animosi∣ty against the Scot∣tish na∣tion.</NOTE> But the character and conduct of the minister might have possibly stood proof against all those assaults, had not his enemies artfully pointed their arrows at that part of him which was most vul∣nerable. The earl of Bute was not only a <HI>Stuart</HI> by name, but he had the misfortune to be born a native of North Britain; and this very circum∣stance, we will venture to say, was, in the opinion of the people, more than sufficient to counter∣balance all the good qualities which human nature could possess. The jealousy of the English nation, towards their fellow-subjects on the other side of the Tweed, had discovered itself occasionally ever since the union of the crowns; and antient animosities had been kept alive by two successive rebellions which began in Scotland: but the common grudge was founded upon the success of the Scots, who had established themselves in different parts of England, and risen from very small beginnings to wealth and consideration. They had prospe ed in many different provinces of life, and made no con∣temptible figure in the cultivation of the arts and sciences. In a word, the English people looked upon them with an evil eye, as interlopers in com∣merce and competitors for reputation. It was not without murmuring, they had seen them aspire to

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> the first offices in the law, the army, and the navy: but they were exasperated to find a Scot at the head of the English treasury, and the chief administration of the kingdom in his hands. These were topicks on which the writers in the opposition did not fail to expatiate. They revived, and retailed with pe∣culiar virulence, all the calumnies, antient and mo∣dern, that ever had been uttered against the Scottish nation; some of them so gross and absurd, that they could not possibly obtain credit but among the very dregs of the people. They enlarged upon their craft, dissimulation, deceit, and national par∣tiality. They demonstrated the dangers that threatened the interests of Old England, from the great numbers of those Northern adventurers, who had wriggled themselves into all the different de∣partments of civil and military institution; and they insisted upon the disgrace of acquiescing under the government of a North Briton, a Stuart allied by blood to the pretender, who had expelled from court the best friends of the protestant succession, associated himself with avowed Tories, who prosti∣tuted the offices, and squandered away the wealth of England on worthless favourites of his own country. These bitter remonstrances, in which no regard was payed either to truth or decency, they reinforced with feigned circumstances, and forged lists of North Britons gratified with pensions, ap∣pointed to places, or promoted in the service; till at length the populace were incensed and impelled even to the verge of insurrection.</P>

This very extraordinary person was really an enthusiast in patriotism. He had nothing at heart but to co-operate with the views of his royal master, which were solely directed to the advantage and happiness of that very people by whom he was loaded with reproach and execration. He was of opinion that virtue, by its own intrinsic efficacy, would in the end triumph over all opposition; therefore, he did not think it necessary to reinforce it by means of any temporizing art, auxiliary law, or other pre∣caution. Without all doubt, posterity will do him justice: but this justification may come so late, that he himself will reap no benefit from the triumph of his reputation. He was not without friends who exercised their pens in his vindication: but the torrent of popular prejudice soon became too strong to be resisted, either by argument or facts. The populace industriously avoided hearing or seeing any thing that could be urged, or produced in his behalf. They resigned all their thinking faculties, and even their senses, to the indefatigable incendia∣ries of a bold and insolent faction, who were over∣awed by no authority, and restrained by no princi∣ple; till at length the animosity to the Scots in ge∣neral, and the aversion to the minister in particular, proceeded to an amazing degree of infatuation. Had the natives of North Britain proved equally combustible, the flames of civil war would have certainly been kindled; and, in that case, the ruin of a mighty nation might have been effected by

Animad∣versions on the conduct of the m—r.</NOTE> his intention was upright, and the par∣tiality for his own countrymen, of which he was accused, seems to have been entirely without foun∣dation. At least it appears, that as few natives of North Britain were provided with places, or promoted in the service, during his ministry, as in any former term of the same duration, since the be∣ginning of the century. It was observed, however, that this nobleman did not possess the art of ac∣quiring popularity: that his deportment, though civil and condescending, was stiffened with a re∣serve, which kept mankind at too great a distance; that, instead of giving magnificent entertainments, suitable to the dignity of his office, and the libera∣lity of his fortune, which had been increased to a very ample revenue by the death of his father-in-law, his housekeeping was modest, frugal, and savoured rather too much of oeconomy; that he did not mingle enough in the society and diver∣sions of the nobility, whose friendship it was his in∣terest to cultivate; but passed his hours of relaxa∣tion among a few private favourites of his own country, whose characters, perhaps, wanted no ad∣vantage, but that of being known, to attract the esteem of the public. We will not pretend to judge whether he was to blame in associating as a minister with Mr. F—x, who was, undoubtedly, next to himself, the most unpopular man in the whole kingdom: but this circumstance was loudly re∣hearsed as a flagrant article of his demerits. He was also ridiculed for having forced the place of chancellor of the exchequer upon sir F—s D—sh—d,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The king's in∣clination for peace.</NOTE> In the midst of these internal disturbances, the operations of war were prosecuted with unremitting ardour in the East and West Indies; while the king still persisted in his resolution to embrace the first opportunity of re-establishing peace, which, exclusive of motives of humanity, he thought ab∣solutely necessary for the advantage of his own kingdom. He longed to see his people eased of that intolerable load of taxes, which the expences of this and the former war had laid upon their shoulders. He saw them exhausting their blood and treasure in quarrels, not their own, upon the continent of Germany; and that this fatal drain could not be effectually stopped, but by a general pacification. The national debt was increased to such an enormous burden, as seemed to threaten the immediate ruin of public credit, which a peace alone could prevent. The original scope of the war, namely, the security of the British colonies in America, was fully accomplished; forty ships of the line were rendered useless by hard service: thirty thousand recruits were wanted for the army; and the war had occasioned such a scarcity of men, that, during the preceding year, it had been found im∣practicable to raise above fifteen hundred recruits for the established regiments, though great pre∣miums had been offered to engage men in the ser∣vice. These considerations reinforced the other

The duke of Bedford being chosen for th s purpose, by the king of Great Britain, set out for Franc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the beginning of September; and, at the same time, the duke de Nivernois arrived in England with the same character from his most christian majesty.

The king of Prussia delivered from two formidable enemies, in consequence of his late ac∣commodation with Russia and Sweden, was now in a condition to take care of himself: besides, that system was changed, by which his interests had been so warmly espoused at the court of London. In settling the preliminaries, which were discussed in concert with the kings of Spain and Portugal, the belligerant powers made allowances for what might have happened in the East and West Indies, and regulated the concessions to be made in proportion

We have already observed that the armament under the con∣duct of those two commanders had sailed from Portsmouth in the beginning of March; and, ac∣cording to the general opinion, it was destined to act against the principal Spanish settlement on the island of Cuba. On the twenty-seventh day of May, they were joined off Cape Nichola, on the north-west point of Hispaniola, by a detachment of the fleet from Martinique, under sir James Douglas; and, in consequence of this junction, their whole force consisted of nineteen sail of the line, eighteen smaller ships of war, and about one hundred and fifty transports, having on board about ten thousand land forces and marines. Orders had been sent to detach another reinforcement of four thousand men from New York, which, it was supposed, would arrive time enough to bear a part in their military operations.</P>

the fleet through that difficult and danger∣ous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762▪</NOTE> passage, which lies along the north side of Cuba. He was favoured with fair wind and good weather, which enabled him to perform this task in a few days, without accident or danger; and, on the sixth day of July, he lay to, about five leagues to the eastward of the Havanna, after having taken a Spanish frigate and a store-ship in the passage. Having issued directions to the masters of the transports, with respect to the disembarkation of the army, and left commodore Keppel to superin∣tend this service, with six sail of the line and some frigates, he bore away with the rest of the fleet, and ran down off the harbour, where he descried twelve Spanish ships of the line, with several trading vessels. Next morning he embarked his marines in boats, and made a shew of landing about four miles to the westward of the Havanna; while the earl of Albemarle landed with the whole army, be∣tween the rivers Boca-nao and Coxemar, about six miles to the eastward of the Moro Castle, which was the enemy's chief fortress for the defence of the town and harbour. A body of Spaniards ap∣peared on the shore; but, some sloops being or∣dered in to scour the beach and the woods with their cannon, the troops not only landed, but also passed the river Coxemar, without opposition. On the tenth, colonel Carleton drove the enemy from a small redoubt on the top of the hill Cavannos, which overlooked the Moro; and there a post was established: at the same time, three bomb-vessels being anchored in shore, began to throw shells into the town, under cover of the ships Sterling Castle

Though this invasion of the English was altogether unexpected, the place being strong∣ly fortified and well supplied, preparations were instantly made for a vigorous defence, by Don Juan de Prado, governor of the city, and the mar∣quis del Real, commodore of the shipping, assisted by the counsels and experience of the viceroy of Peru and the governor of Carthagena, who hap∣pened to be at the Havanna, in the way to or from their respective governments. By the twelfth, they had sunk three of their capital ships in the mouth of the harbour; so as entirely to block up the channel. The admiral ordered four ships of the line to cruise in the offing; and, with the rest of his squadron, anchored off Chorera river, four miles to the westward of the Havanna, where there was plenty of wood and fresh water. Here, at the re∣quest of lord Albemarle, he landed eight hundred marines, formed into two battalions, under the majors Campbell and Collins, who encamped on this side, and were reinforced from the other side by a detachment of twelve hundred men, under the command of colonel Howe. This step was taken in order to secure a footing on both quarters of the town, and divide the enemy's attention, so as to weaken the defence of the Moro, against which the earl of Albemarle had determined to di∣rect his chief operations. He was encamped in the woods between the river Coxemar and the Moro, leaving a corps at Guana-macoa, under the com∣mand of lieutenant-general Elliot, to secure the avenues on that side, and his communication with a large tract of country, which, it was hoped,
<PB N="127" REF="1310"/>
would supply the troops with water, vegetables,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> and fresh provision. The attack of the Moro was commanded by major-general Keppel, brother to the earl of Albemarle; and the chief engineer was Mr. Mackellar, who displayed uncommon abilities at the siege of Louisbourg, and on many other oc∣casions both in this and the last war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack of Fort Moro.</NOTE> Fascines, stores, and artillery, being landed from the ships with great expedition by the seamen, the engineers began to erect batteries of bombs and cannon, while a body of pioneers were employed to cut parallels in the woods, and form a line with fascines to secure the guards from the fire of the enemy, which began to be very troublesome. On the twenty-ninth, about one thousand chosen men of the enemy, with a detachment of armed negroes and mulattoes, landed on two divisions to the right and left of the Moro, in order to destroy the works of the besiegers: but they were repulsed by the piquets and advanced posts, and retreated in great confusion, with the loss of two hundred men, killed and taken. On the first day of July, the besiegers opened two batteries of cannon, so that their whole fire now proceeded from twelve battering cannon, six large mortars, three small ones, and twenty-six royals. The enemy had seventeen pieces of ar∣tillery, and one mortar, mounted on the front at∣tacked: but their fire was not so well maintained as that of the assailants. Indeed, their attention was this day divided for about three hours, in consequence of an attack made upon the north-east face, by three ships of the line, the Cambridge, Dragon, and Marlborough, commanded by the
<PB N="128" REF="1320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> captains Goostrey, Hervey, and Burnet, who main∣tained a close cannonade, though with little effect: for the Moro was situated too high to be much affected by their artillery. They suffered con∣siderably in their rigging, and lost a great num∣ber of men, including captain Goostrey, who fell in the beginning of the engagement. His place was supplied by captain Lindsay of the Trent, a brave officer, who behaved with remarkable gal∣lantry. Captain Campbell, of the Sterling Castle, who had been ordered to lead until the first ship had been properly placed, did not perform his part according to the directions he had received; and was obliged to quit the service.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prizes made by the admi∣ral's cruisers.</NOTE> About the same time, the admiral's cruisers, who scoured the sea round the whole island, brought in the Venganza frigate of twenty-six guns, the Marté of eighteen, and a schooner, laden with coffee. On the twelfth, sir James Douglas, who had parted from the admiral immediately after their junction, and steered his course to Jamaica, in a single ship, now arrived off the Havanna, having under his convoy, a fleet of merchant ships bound for England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficul∣ties of the siege.</NOTE> The parapet of Fort Moro was all of masonry; the ditch of the front attacked, was seventy feet deep from the edge of the counterscarp, and more than forty feet of that depth sunk in the rock. The soil of the country in the neighbour∣hood, being very thin, afforded little earth; and as it was thought necessary to carry on the approaches by sap, this method might have been found alto∣gether impracticable, had not sir James Douglas
<PB N="129" REF="1330"/>
supplied the engineers with cotton bags, from some<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> ships of his convoy, which were partly loaded with this commodity. Mean while, the enemy made such a vigorous defence, that the siege was pro∣tracted beyond expectation; a considerable delay was likewise occasioned by an unlucky accident. On the third day of July, the principal battery of the besiegers, chiefly constructed of timber and fas∣cines, being dried by the heat of the weather and the continual cannonade, took fire, and the flames raged with such violence, that almost the whole work was consumed. The besiegers were subjected to various other discouragements. Epidemical distempers, such as never fail to attack the natives of Britain who visit those countries, began to make great havock, both in the army and the navy. These were rendered more fatal by the want of necessaries and refreshments. The provision was bad; and the troops were ill supplied with water. The great number of the sick rendered the duty more fatiguing to those that were well. In those warm climates, the human body being in a state of relaxation, is incapable of such a degree of labour as it can bear in more northern latitudes; and the men are subject to a species of dejection, which al∣ways augments the general mortality: this was now reinforced by the delay of the troops from North America, which they had long expected to no purpose.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Observa∣tions re∣lating to the health of the sol∣diery and seamen.</NOTE> From repeated experience, it appears, that the troops of England can never endure a campaign of any length in the West-Indies. At least, nothing can render it tolerable, but such attention to the

That the forces before the Ha∣vanna should be obliged to live on damaged provi∣sion, is a reproach upon the victuallers; but it is still more surprising that they should be in want of water in the neighbourhood of two rivers, while the boats-crews of the whole fleet were unem∣ployed It would deserve the consideration of our admirals and generals, who may hereafter be chosen to conduct such enterprizes, whether it would not conduce to the health of the men, if certain sloops, vessels, and boats, should be regularly employed in making provision of turtle, fish, pot-herbs, roots, oranges, and lemons, along the coast, and in the neighbouring islands, where these articles abound; while successive detachments are sent out from the army to procure supplies of black cattle, hogs, poultry, and every other species of eatables. The owners of these ought not to be pillaged, but conscientiously payed for what they furnish; and, above all things, the men ought to be indulged with plenty of fresh water, a certain proportion of it being mixed with wine or distilled spirit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival of the rein∣forcement from North America.</NOTE> On the second day of August, the second divi∣sion of the transports, with the troops from North-America, arrived; and this reinforcement added fresh vigour to the operations of the siege. In a few days, the seamen and soldiers belonging to four of the American transports, which had been wrecked in the straights of Bahama, were brought off in five sloops, detached by the admiral on this service: but, at the same time, he received infor∣mation
<PB N="131" REF="1350"/>
that five other transports, having on board<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> three hundred and fifty soldiers, of Anstruther's regiment, and one hundred and fifty provincial troops, were taken on the twenty-first day of July, by a French squadron, which fell in with them near the passage between Maya Guanna, and the North Caicos. All the rest of the troops, however, arrived in perfect health.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the siege.</NOTE> On the nineteenth of July, the besiegers took possession of the covered-way, before the point of the right bastion, and a new sap was begun at this lodgment. The only place by which the foot of the wall was accessible, happened to be a thin ridge of rock, left at the point of the bastion, to cover the extremity of the ditch, which would otherwise have been open to the sea. Along this ridge the miners passed, without cover, to the foot of the wall, where they made a lodgment with little loss. Mean while, they sunk a shaft without the covered-way, in order to form a mine for throwing the counterscarp into the ditch, should it be found ne∣cessary to fill it; and continued their former sap along the glacis. In the night of the twenty-first, a serjeant and twelve men scaled the walls by sur∣prize; but, the garrison being alarmed before they could be sustained, they were obliged to retreat with precipitation. Next day, at four in the morning, a sally was made from the town, by fifteen hundred men, divided into three detachments, who attacked the besiegers in three different places, while a warm fire was kept up in their favour from the fort of Punta, the west bastion, the lines and flanks of the entrance, and their shipping in the harbour.
<PB N="132" REF="1360"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An 1762.</NOTE> After a warm dispute, which cost the English about fifty men killed or wounded, all their three parties were repulsed, and fled with such precipitation, that a considerable number was drowned in the hurry of their retreat. Their loss amounted to four hundred, killed and taken prisoners. On the thirtieth day of the month, about two in the morn∣ing, a floating battery was towed out into the har∣bour, and fired with grape-shot and small arms into the ditch, though without any great interruption to the miners; and the close fire of the covering party soon compelled the enemy to retire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Moro taken by assault.</NOTE> In the afternoon, two mines were sprung by the besiegers, with such effect, that a practicable breach was made in the bastion; and orders were immedi∣ately given for the assault. The troops mounted with great intrepidity, and, forming on the top of the breach, drove the enemy from every part of the ramparts, after a short, though very warm, dispute, in which about one hundred and thirty Spaniards were killed, including several officers of distinction. Don Luis de Velasco, governor of the fort, had distinguished himself from the beginning of the siege, by such activity and courage, as attracted the admiration and esteem even of his enemies. In this last action, he did all that could be expected from the most romantic gallantry, and fell by a shot he received in defending the colours of Spain. The marquis Gonzales, who was second in command, likewise lost his life on this occasion. About four hundred of the garrison threw down their arms, and were made prisoners: the rest were either killed in boats, or drowned, in attempting to escape to
<PB N="133" REF="1370"/>
the Havanna. Lieutenant-colonel Stuart, who<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> commanded the attack, lost but two lieutenants, and twelve men; and one lieutenant, with four ser∣jeants, and twenty-four men, were wounded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Surrender of the Havanna and Spanish shipping.</NOTE> The reduction of the Moro was not immediately attended with the surrender of the Havanna; on the contrary, the governor of the place now di∣rected his chief fire against the fortress which they had lost; and even sent down a large ship of the line to the entrance of the harbour, from whence she could batter it with more effect. Her efforts, however, produced nothing, and in a few hours she removed to a greater distance. In the mean time, general Keppel, with the advice of the engi∣neer, resolved to erect new batteries on the Ca∣vannos; and a plan was formed for making a new attack to the westward of the town. On the tenth of August, in the morning, the batteries on the Cavannos being finished, the earl of Albemarle sent a flag of truce to summon the governor to surrender; and his answer was, that he would de∣fend the place to the last extremity. Next morn∣ing, at day-break, about five and forty cannon and eight mortars began to play against the town and the Punta, which last was silenced before ten; in another hour the north bastion was almost disabled. About two in the afternoon, white flags were hung out all round the place, as well as on board the ad∣miral's ship in the harbour; and, in a little time, a flag of truce arrived at the head-quarters, with proposals of capitulation. The governor stickled hard to obtain permission to send the ships to Spain, and to have the harbour declared neutral; but
<PB N="134" REF="1380"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> neither of these points could be given up, and hosti∣lities were ordered to be renewed, when the enemy thought proper to recede from their demands. By the capitulation, which was signed on the thirteenth, the inhabitants were secured in their private pro∣perty, in the enjoyment of their own laws and reli∣gion; and next day the English troops took pos∣session of this important conquest. As for the Spanish garrison, which amounted to about nine hundred, including officers, they were indulged with the honours of war; and it was stipulated, that they and the sailors should be conveyed to Old Spain, together with the Spanish commodore, the governor of the Havanna, the viceroy of Peru, and the governor of Carthagena. In the progress of the siege, about five hundred of the British troops, including fifteen officers, were killed out-right or died of their wounds; and about seven hundred, comprehending thirty-nine officers, were cut off by distemper, which raged with redoubled violence after the reduction of the place. Great quantities of artillery, small arms, ammunition, and warlike stores, fell into the hands of the conquer∣ors, together with twelve ships of the line, two upon the stocks, and several trading vessels. They likewise acquired to the amount of near two mil∣lions sterling, in silver, tobacco, and valuable mer∣chandize, collected on his catholic majesty's ac∣count: so that the British nation was more than indemnified for the expence of the expedition; and the enemy's loss was irreparable.</P>
<P>So much treasure intercepted by the English, first in the ship Hermione, and now in the island of

While this place remains in the hands of an enemy, who are masters at sea, the court of Madrid can re∣ceive no supplies of treasure from the West Indies, except by such routes as are equally tedious and uncertain, by beating up the windward passage from Carthagena, which cannot be effected without infinite trouble, perseverance, and danger from the English squadrons; and, by surrounding Cape∣horn, or passing through the streights of Magellan from the South-sea, a voyage of great length, sub∣ject to infinite hazards and inconveniences. The reduction of the Havanna, therefore, was an acqui∣sition, that not only distressed the Spaniards in the most essential manner, by stopping the sources of their wealth, but likewise opened to the conquerors an easy avenue to the centre of their American treasures. In no former war had Great Britain ac∣quired such large sums at the expence of her ene∣mies. Her success in the East-Indies is said to have brought into England near six millions in treasure and jewels, since the commencement of hostilities; but every million thus acquired, she has expended tenfold in the course of her subsidies and expeditions.</P>

The troops allotted for this expedition consisted of one regiment, with a company of the royal ar∣tillery; and these were, by the governor of Ma∣drass, reinforced with some able officers, about thirty men of the company's artillery, six hundred Sipoys, one company of Caffres, one of Topazes, one of pioneers, two companies of French de∣serters, with a few hundred of Lascars, for the use of the engineers and the park of artillery. Vice-admiral Cornish supplied a strong battalion of sea∣men and marines; so that the whole force amount∣ed to two thousand three hundred effective men, with which it was resolved to make an attempt upon the flourishing city of Manilla. Major-ge∣neral Laurence, who commanded the forces of the East-India company at Madrass, was of opinion that the settlements would be in danger, should a greater number of troops be drawn from the coast; and, therefore, the two battalions of the company's troops, the whole cavalry, six thousand sipoys, with part of Monson's regiment, and the highlanders, were left for their security: at the same time, or∣ders were left for three ships of war, which they hourly expected at Madrass, to remain on that part of the coast for the protection of the commerce. The enterprize was no sooner resolved upon, than the admiral detached captain Grant in the Sea-horse, to the entrance of the Chinese sea, with in∣structions to intercept all vessels bound for Manilla,

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> King, Grant, and Peighin, who commanded the covering frigates, maintained such a warm fire of cannon, to the right and left, that they soon dis∣persed; and the general disembarked his troops without the loss of one man; while the Spanish garrison were employed in burning the suburbs of Manilia. Next day the general took possession of the Polverista, a small fort which the enemy had abandoned, and which proved an excellent place of arms for covering the landing of the stores and ar∣tillery. Colonel Monson, with an advanced party of two hundred men, occupied the church of the Hermita, about nine hundred yards from the city. The head▪quarters were fixed in the curate's house, and secured by the seventy-ninth regiment, of which Mr. Draper himself was colonel, as a post of the utmost importance, both from its strength, and the commodious cover it afforded from the rains which had deluged the country, and rendered it impossible to encamp. The marines were left at the Malata, in the neighbourhood of the Pol∣verista, to preserve the communication with the fleet, and guard the stores and artillery, which were not landed without great danger and fatigue. Some boa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were overset, and lieutenant Hardwick pe∣rished on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his occasion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opera∣tions be∣gun against the town.</NOTE> The governor had been already twice summon∣ed to surrender, but returned a resolute refusal; and, indeed, if the valour of his troops had cor∣responded with the vigour of his declaration, he had but little to apprehend from an handful of enemies, who, far from being in a condition to invest the city on all sides, were obliged to confine their operations to one corner, leaving two thirds of it open to all manner of supplies. The front, which the general resolved to attack, was defended by the bastions of St. Diego, and St. Andrew; a ravelin, which covered the royal gate, a wet ditch, a covered way, and a glacis. The bastions were in good order, mounted with a great number of fine brass cannon: but the ravelin was not armed; nor the covered way in good repair: the glacis was▪ too low, and the ditch was not carried round the capital of the bastion of St. Diego. The breadth of the ditch was about thirty yards, and the depth of water did not exceed five feet. It was sounded by a detachment, headed by captain Fletcher, who begged leave to undertake this dangerous enterprize, which he atchieved in the

Some straggling seamen having been mur∣dered by the savages, the governor sent out a flag of truce on the twenty-seventh, to apologize for these barbarities, and request the release of his own nephew, who had been lately taken in the bay, by the boats of the fleet. He had been dispatched in a galley, by the commander of the Galleon Phi∣lippina, just arrived from Acapulco, at Cajayagan, near Cape Spirito Santo, with the first advices of the war. Next day, while lieutenant Fryar, with a flag of truce, conducted this prisoner to the town, a detachment of the garrison, intermixed with In∣dians, sallied out to attack one of the posts of the besiegers: when the savages, without respecting the law of nations, or the sacred character of an officer, under the protection of a flag of truce, fell upon Mr. Fryar, with the most inhuman fury, and murdered him on the spot. They even mangled his body in the most brutal manner, and mortally wounded the Spanish gentleman who endeavoured to protect his conductor. In their attack, they were soon repulsed by the British party that de∣fended the post, who were so exasperated by their barbarity, that they gave them no quarter.</P>

with a view to second the operations of the be∣siegers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> They performed this service with great intrepidity; and, although the shallows kept them at too great a distance to answer the purpose effec∣tually, their fire did not fail to produce great con∣fusion and terror among the inhabitants. On the first and second days of October, the weather was so tempestuous, as to endanger the whole squa∣dron, which lay upon a lee-shore. The South-sea Castle store-ship was driven ashore, and, even in that situation, did remarkable service, by enfilading the whole beach to the southward, with her guns, and keeping in awe a large body of Indians, who threatened an attack on the Polverista, and the ma∣gazines of the besiegers at the Malata. Notwith∣standing the storm and heavy rains, the troops and seamen compleated several batteries of cannon and mortars; finished a parallel and communication from thence to the advanced-post at the church, and established a spacious place of arms on the left of it, near the sea, the roaring of which favoured the workmen in the night, by preventing the noise they made from being heard by the garrison. On the third, the battery being opened against the left face of St. Diego's bastion, was so well served by the seamen and corps of artillery, and the fire so well directed by the conduct and skill of major Barker, that, in a few hours, twelve pieces of can∣non, mounted on the face of the bastion, were to∣tally silenced, and the enemy obliged to retire. At night, a battery was begun of three guns on the left of the place of arms, to silence those that were in barbette, upon the orillon of the St. Andrew

Their approach was facilita ed by a number of thick bushes growing on the side of a rivulet, through which they passed in the night, without being perceived by the patroles. The alarm was no sooner given, than colonel Mon∣son and captain Fletcher advanced with the picquets to the assistance of the seamen, who had very judi∣ciously kept firm within their posts, contenting themselves with acting on the defence, until the light should render objects more distinguishable. The assailants, though armed chiefly with bows and lances, advanced in the most resolute manner to the attack; fought with incredible ferocity; when repulsed, returned with redoubled fury to the very muzzles of the English musquets; and died like wild beasts, gnawing their bayonets. At day-break, a fresh p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cquet of the seventy-ninth regiment appearing upon their right flank, they gave way, and fled with great precipitation, having lost three hundred men in their attack and retreat.

According to colonel Draper's own account the total of the troops with which he entered Manilla amounted to little more than two thousand, a motley composition of sea∣men, soldiers, Sipoys, Cafres, Lascars, Topasees, French and German deserters. These assailants mounted the breach with incredible courage and ra∣pidity; while the Spaniards, on the bastion, retired so suddenly, that it was imagined they depended entirely on their mines. Capt. Stephenson was im∣mediately ordered to examine the ground; but this precaution was needless. The English troops pene∣trated into the town with very little opposition, ex∣cept at the royal gate, where there was a guard-house, defended by one hundred Spaniards and Indians, who, refusing to surrender, were put to the sword. They were likewise considerably galled with shot from the galleries of lofty houses, by which the great square was surrounded. Three hundred of the garrison were drowned in attempting to pass the river, which was deep and rapid; the governor, with the principal magistrates, retiring into the citadel.

Upon their return they brought a draught of terms, in the name of the archbishop, the royal audience, and the city and commerce of Manilla, which were so unsuitable to their desperate situation, that they were rejected as unsatisfactory and inadmissible, be∣cause they contained no mention of a compensation to the victors for saving the place from utter de∣struction. The English commanders then took the pen, and dictated the conditions on which the city of Manilla should be preserved from plunder, and the inhabitants maintained in their religi∣on, liberties, and properties, under the govern∣ment and protection of his Britannic majesty. In this paper the British commanders promised that the terms proposed by the archbishop and the ma∣gistrates should be granted, if those of the ransom were complied with; to which the Spaniards consented. In consequence of this capitulation the town and port of Cavi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, with the islands and forts depending upon Manilla, were to be surrendered to his Britannic majesty; and four millions of dollars paid as a ransom for the city of Ma∣nilla, and the effects of the inhabitants, who, on the other hand, were to be secured in their religion and private property, under the government and protection of the king of England.

The port and citadel of Cavite were surrendered, together with several large ships, and a vast quantity of warlike and naval stores. The Spanish garrison of three hundred men, instead of quietly surrendering the place, in consequence of the governor's order, mutinied against their officers; and, having plun∣dered some houses, retired with their arms to the country. Captain Campion, with two hundred men, being embarked in the Sea-horse, took pos∣session of the place, and captain Kempenfeldt was appointed governor of it, by a commission from the general. One third of the ransom of Manilla was allowed to the East-India company; and Mr. Draper, according to the instructions he had re∣ceived, delivered up the city of Manilla, the port of Cavite, with all their artillery, ammunition, and warlike stores, to Dawson Drake, Esq; and the other individuals appointed to receive them in be∣half of that company. All the British forces em∣ployed in this expedition were but barely suffi∣cient to garrison these important conquests, which were atchieved with so little loss, that not above one hundred men were killed in the whole service.

On the eleventh day of Septem∣ber, his lordship was joined by colonel Amherst, who had been ordered on this service by his brother sir Jeffery Amherst, commander of the forces in America. The colonel had touched at Louis∣bourg, and taken on board some troops, which, with those embarked at Hallifax, amounted to about eight hundred, chiefly highlanders and light infantry. They were landed, after a short resistance, in Torbay, about seven miles to the northward of St. John's; and this part of the country was ren∣dered difficult by m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untains and passes occupied by the enemy. The British forces advanced to the strong post of Kitty-vitty, which they took sword in hand. They likewise drove the enemy from two other heights which they had fortified, and did not abandon without bloodshed. On the sixteenth of September, they encamped in the neighbourhood of St. John's Fort, and, next day, a mortar battery was compleated. The French com∣modore had sunk some shallops in the entrance of the harbour, which was commanded by a breast∣work and unfinished battery. These being taken, and the channel opened, colonel Amhe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st received his artillery and stores, by water conveyance: but lord Colville was driven by contrary winds, to some distance from the coast. In his absence, Mr. de Ternay took advantage of a thick fog, to slip his cables and make his escape.

They were a fine body of troops, very near equal in number to the besiegers; and lord Colville, who had by this time returned to the harbour, prepared ships for their transportation to France. Thus the town and fort of St. John's, with all the other petty places which the French had taken on this coast, were recovered, with very little loss, by a handful of troops, who acted with most remarkable resolution, and sur∣mounted many difficulties by dint of indefatigable labour and perseverance. In this short expedition, lieutenant Schuyler, of the royal Americans, was killed. Captain Macdonald died of the wounds he received in attacking one of the enemy's fortified posts. The captains Bailie and Mackenzie were likewise wounded, but recovered; and not above twenty men were lost in all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ferent actions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes about the peace in England.</NOTE> While the British troops were thus encountering dangers and difficulties abroad, and spending their best blood with alacrity, for the honour and ad∣vantage of their country, the people at home were heated and inflamed to a very dangerous degree of faction. Indeed, by this time, the commonalty through the whole kingdom had loudly declared for the professed enemies of the ministry: and the clamour against the peace was augmented by the
<PB N="155" REF="1610"/>
voice of many, who, in other respects, had no ob∣jection<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> to the person of the minister. With respect to the articles of the peace, which were now pretty well known, though the preliminaries had not been formally signed, many papers and pamphlets were written and published on both sides of the question. It was taken for granted that great part of the British conquests would be restored; therefore la∣boured comparisons were drawn between Canada and the French sugar islands, in which the im∣portance of each was magnified or depreciated with all the artifice of misrepresentation, according to the interested views of the different authors who drew their pens upon this occasion. Whether it was necessary to give up the conquered islands, we shall not pretend to determine; but those who ar∣gued for restoring Canada, rather than Guadalupe, were either extremely ignorant of the true interests of Great Britain, or influenced by motives of pri∣vate advantage, which they resolved to obey at the hazard of sowing the seeds of a new war in North-America: for, exclusive of the commercial ad∣vantages immediately derived from the possession of Canada, that is, the entire fur trade of a vast continent, it effectually secured the British colonies in that part of the world, which could not possibly be safe while the French retained their settle∣ments on the lakes, the river and gulph of St. Laurence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Objecti∣ons to the articles.</NOTE> The most sanguine politicians insisted upon a continuation of the war, which would, in another compaign, add the isl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of St. Domingo to the other conquests; of consequence, give the finishing

They affirmed that, in the mean time, public credit could receive no great shock, inasmuch as it appeared in the course of the preceding year, that the government might have borrowed much greater sums than were necessary for the annual expence of the war. This, how∣ever, was a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lacious argument. True it is, great sums were offered; but these offers were not the effect of affluence, but of avarice. Every indivi∣dual who could command a sum of ready money, being allured by the high premiums which the go∣vernment allowed, hastened to join in the subscrip∣tion. A vile spirit of usury took possession of the people Just debts were left unpayed: sacred de∣posits of trust were invaded. The whole specie of the united kingdom centered in the capital; so that the extremities were lest destitute. Personal credit, the soul and essence of a trading nation, was at an end; manufactures languished; and scarce any commerce was to be seen, but the infamous traffick of stock-jobbing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarks on the excepti∣ons tak∣en.</NOTE> Another set of patriots declared they had no ob∣jection to a peace, provided the nation retained the islands of Martinique and Guadalupe, together with Canada and Cape Breton, and the French should be totally excluded from the fishery on the banks of Newfoundland, which last was not only a source of great wealth, but also the chief nursery of their seamen, by means of which they had been enabled to contest the superiority with Great Britain, in every branch of commerce▪ Without
<PB N="157" REF="1630"/>
all doubt, England, by the possession of those<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> islands and the exclusive fishery, would have de∣rived great advantages, and, in particular, must have engrossed almost the whole Guinea trade for slaves and gum, which the French had for many years carried on to the greatest extent. They ob∣served that France had no right to demand the re∣storation of their islands, as they had nothing to give by way of compensation for such a sacrifice: that Belleisle was an equivalent for Minorca; that they could have as little pretence for insisting upon a share of the fishery: that, with respect to Spain, it would be weak and impolitic to give up at any rate the important conquest of the Havanna, which must of course be followed by the reduction of the whole island of Cuba, very near as extensive as Great Britain; the most healthy, fertile, and de∣lightful of all the countries hitherto discovered in that part of the world: but, that it would be a mark of still greater imbecility, to part with this conquest, without establishing the right of the British subjects to cut logwood and erect forts for their security in the bay of Honduras, and to navi∣gate in those seas, without search or molestation; without obliging Spain to relinquish all title to the fishery of Newfoundland; to cede the whole coun∣try of Florida to Great Britain; and make signal satisfaction for the shameful partiality she had, since the beginning of the war, shewn in favour of France, to the prejudice of the English subjects. All these points deserved consideration.</P>
<P>Had Great Britain fought for herself alone, and restricted her efforts to her own element, she might
<PB N="158" REF="1640"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> have retained all her conquests, and even have found her account in the prosecution of hostilities: but she was saddled with the protection of her allies; and, on their account, involved in a double continental war, the expence of which over-bal∣lanced all the advantages she could derive from the success of her arms. France and Spain declared, in plain terms, that, without the restitution of the islands and the Havanna, peace could be of no advantage to them; that they would rather hazard the prosecution of the war, which, in the long run, must exhaust the finances and credit of England; and, in the mean time, redouble their efforts in making an entire conquest of Portugal, which it would not be in the power of the British auxiliaries to protect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelimi∣naries signed.</NOTE> Perhaps the m—y of Great Britain discovered an eagerness for peace in the negotiation, which en∣couraged the courts of Versailles and Madrid to insist upon more favourable terms than, otherwise, they would have been glad to embrace. Be that as it may, the preliminaries were signed on both sides, and interchanged at Versailles about the latter end of November: an event which was im∣mediately communicated to the city of London, by a letter from the under-secretary of state, to the lord-mayor. The capital was still in a ferment, which the chief magistrate took very little pains to allay. The opposition had been gathering strength ever since the negotiation was renewed. Measures were taken for effecting a coalition between the d—ke of N—w—le and Mr. P—tt, who had hi∣therto kept aloof from each other, at the head of
<PB N="159" REF="1650"/>
their respective partisans. It is certain that the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> former, for some time, had been no friend to that minister's measures. He saw his own importance dwindle by the continuance of the war, in propor∣tion as it was successful. He secretly encouraged the attacks that were made upon Mr. P—tt's mea∣sures, and, had not lord B—e stept in, he himself would have headed the pacific system. But they were far less disunited from one another than each was to lord B—e. At last common enmity unit∣ed them, and they joined their endeavours to persuade the people that the p—t would never ratify the conditions of such an infamous peace. On the other hand, the members of the administration did not fail to take every proper measure that could ensure the approbation of the legislature. By this time the earl of Hallifax was joined with the earl of Egremont, as se∣cretary of state; and Mr. Grenville was placed at the head of the admiralty. Mr. F—x exerted him∣self successfully in securing the concurrence of many individuals in the lower house; and almost the whole landed interest was well affected to the mea∣sures of the government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> On the twenty-fifth day of November, the par∣liament being assembled, his majesty harrangued them from the throne. He observed, that the late war with Spain, and the attack of his ally, the king of Portugal, having greatly affected the com∣merce of his subjects, multiplied the objects of his military operations, and added to the heavy bur∣thens of his people; he had willingly embraced an occasion that offered of renewing the negotiation
<PB N="160" REF="1660"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> for peace. He gave them to unde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stand, that the preliminary articles were actually signed: that, by the cond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions in which all parties had acquiesced, an immense territo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y was added to the empire of Great Britain; and a so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id foundation laid for the increase of commerce; that care had been taken to remove all occasions of future disputes; that the king of Portugal was secured in all his domi∣nions; and that all the territories of his German allies were evacuated by the troops of France. He lamented that a great number of his subjects had been lost in different parts of the world; a consi∣deration which reinforced the other reasons he had to engage in the negotiation; and that he had hastened the conclusion of it, to prevent the ne∣cessity of making preparations for another cam∣paign. He desired the commons to consider of such methods in the settlement of the new acquisi∣tions, as should most effectually tend to the secu∣rity of those countries, and to the improvement of the British trade and navigation. He recommend∣ed to their care and attention, his gallant subjects by whose valour those acquisitions were made. He observed, that union at home was peculiarly ne∣cessary to lay the foundation of that oeconomy which they owed to themselves and their posterity, and which alone could relieve the nation from the heavy burthens entailed upon it by the necessities of a long expensive war.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles of peace approved by both houses.</NOTE> In answer to this speech, addresses were presented as usual by both houses, containing general compli∣ments of congratulation on the approach of peace, as well as upon the birth of the prince of Wales;
<PB N="161" REF="1670"/>
next day a cessation of arms was proclaimed; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> orders were given for opening again all the chan∣nels of communication with France and Spain. When the upper house took the articles of the peace into consideration, many objections were made by the lords in the opposition; and some severe reflections were thrown out against the earl of B—te, with appearance of heat and personal animosity. That nobleman defended his own con∣duct with temper and decorum, in a well connected speech delivered with great propriety, to the sur∣prize of many who did not think him so well qua∣lified in the art and faculty of elocution. He gave a detail of the negotiation; and not only owned himself a warm promoter of the peace, but even expressed a desire that this circumstance should be engraved upon his tomb He was seconded by the earl of Halifax, and supported by a great ma∣jority.</P>
<P>The same good fortune attended the administra∣tion in the other house, where the opposition made its appearance in a number that was by no means formidable. Mr. P—tt, though in his health greatly indisposed, resolved to disapprove the peace in per∣son. He came into the house, supported on the arms of his friends, and obtained of the speaker permission to harangue sitting. In this attitude he spoke above two hours without intermission. The scope of his speech was to justify his own con∣duct in the administration; and to give his opinion of the separate articles of the peace, which, upon the whole, he condemned as inadequate to the suc∣cess of the British arms. It is true he himself had
<PB N="162" REF="1680"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> in the course of the preceding year, agreed to ar∣ticles much less advantageous to Great Britain: but he insisted upon the conquests made since that period; and it was observed on the other side, that, if fresh advantages had been gained, new in∣cumbrances were added by the war with Spain, the protection of Portugal, the interruption of trade with both those nations; the increase of the na∣tional debt; and the want of men to recruit the army and navy. In a word, Mr. P—tt was not heard with that attention and applause which he had formerly commanded. The mayor of London spoke on the same side, without making much im∣pression; and both houses agreed upon addresses of approbation, which were presented accordingly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> The definitive treaty of peace, signed at Paris on the tenth day of February, was couched in these terms:</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Observa∣tions on the trea∣ty.</NOTE> The reader will, at one glance, perceive that these terms are more advantageous to Great Britain and her allies, than those which were agreed to by the late minister. He must determine for himself, whether they were such as she ought to have insist∣ed upon, in consequence of her additional successes. Certainly they were more favourable for France and Spain, than those powers could have reasonably ex∣pected to enjoy, after the losses they had sustained. It must be acknowledged that Great Britain, by extending the frontiers of Canada, to the middle of the Mississippi, gained a large tract of fertile country lying on the banks of that river, besides the advantage of a free navigation upon it, and the possession of the port of Mobile: but, in order to secure the English American colonies from all pos∣sibility of disturbance from the French, that rest∣less nation ought to have been expelled from New Orleans, and the whole country of Louisiana; for, while they remain in this settlement, at liberty to penetrate by the river to the remote tribes of In∣dians, they will still maintain their influence among those savages: they will supply them with necessaries, consequently weaken their dependence upon the English; and employ their arts of insi∣nuation upon them so effectually, as to have it al∣ways in their power to hunt them upon the de∣fenceless back-settlements of the British colonists. It does not appear that the British ministry were well acquainted with the importance of this article.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="1930"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> England, by this peace, likewise gained an ac∣cession, in France's ceding to her the island of Gre∣nada, which, when fully cultivated and peopled, may be of some consequence. She moreover ac∣quired the unsettled islands of Dominica, Tobago, and St. Vincent; but yielded to France the island of St. Lucie, said to be worth all the rest. She retains the settlement of Senegal on the coast of Africa, by which she engrosses the whole gum trade of that country; as for the rock of Goree, which she restored, it was no great sacrifice. The article that relates to the East-Indies, was dictated by the directors of the English company; and surely the French have no reason to complain of its severity, as it restores them to the possession of all the places they had at the beginning of the war, on condition that they shall maintain neither forts nor forces in the kingdom of Bengal; thus they will enjoy all their former advantages in trade, without the temp∣tation and expence of forming schemes of conquest and dominion.</P>
<P>The demolition of the works belonging to the harbour of Dunkirk, is no doubt a sensible morti∣fication to France, though of little consequence to England, while a squadron of ships is kept at an∣chor in the Downs. It became an object of some consideration in the war of queen Anne, as a nest of privateers that infested the channel; and was after∣wards used as an inflammatory term of faction. The danger that may threaten England from Dunkirk, does not depend upon vessels which could be received into the harbour; but must arise from a strong squadron of ships of the line, which
<PB N="188" REF="1940"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> may always lie at anchor in the road. It is un∣doubtedly in the power of France to embark twenty thousand men on the coast of Calais and Dunkirk; and these, taking the advantage of a strong easterly wind, which will not allow the Bri∣tish squadron in the Downs to move from their riding, may, under convoy of ten sail of the line, reach the mouth of the river Thames, in fourteen hours. Tilbury fort, opposite to Gravesend, which is the only strength that guards the channel, might be silenced in two hours, by two or three ships of the line; and then the whole armament might proceed to Blackwall, without further opposition. Every lover of his country must be shocked at the thoughts of what would happen, if twenty thousand French troops, with the pretender at their head, should land within six miles of the capital. In two hours he would be joined by an equal number of partisans, in arms, either induced by affection to his family, or instigated by the hope of plunder. From that moment, public credit would fail; and London be obliged to receive law from the invader. This dreadful picture we draw by way of caution to the government, which may easily prevent any such disaster, by fortifying the rivers Thames and Medway, on both sides, at those places where their channels are the most easily commanded, and keep∣ing a strong squadron of ships always ready for ser∣vice, at the Nore, or in the harbour of Sheerness. Granting that such an invasion was attended with much greater difficulty, it will be the interest of France, upon certain occasions, to sacrifice twenty thousand men meerly to try the experiment.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="1950"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> As the treaty makes no mention of the ships taken from the subjects of France before the de∣claration of war, in all probability, the king of Great Britain agreed that their owners should be indemnified; a concession which barely attones for a measure which (whatever may have been alledged in its justification) will always be considered by the candid and impartial, as an act of violence and ra∣pine, that strikes at the very root of the law of na∣tions, which, for the interests of humanity in gene∣ral, ought to be held sacred, even amidst the warmest transports of animosity and resentment.</P>
<P>The liberty of cutting logwood in the bay of Honduras, granted to the subjects of Great Britain, was undoubtedly a great point gained in their fa∣vour; but their obliging themselves to demolish their fortifications on that coast, was a tacit acknowledg∣ment that the privilege was not founded upon right, but derived from favour. His catholic majesty's renouncing all pretensions in favour of his subjects, to the right of fishing on the coasts of Newfound∣land, was a puny sacrifice, something in appearance, but nothing in reality: for the claim was almost as obsolete as that of the English monarch to the do∣minions of France. The cession of Florida, with the forts of St. Augustine and Pensacola, to Great Britain, was an object of much greater importance. It extended the British dominions along the coast to the mouth of the Mississippi. It removed an asylum for the slaves of the English colonies, who were continually making their escape to St. Au∣gustine. It deprived the Spaniards of an easy ave∣nue, through which they had it in their power to
<PB N="190" REF="1960"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> invade Georgia and Carolina; it afforded a large extent of improveable territory, a strong frontier, and a good port in the bay of Mexico, both for the convenience of trade, and the annoyance of the Spaniards in any future contest. But neither the cession of Florida, nor the renunciation of the right to the fishery, nor the permission granted to the English logwood cutters, nor the evacuation of Portugal; nor all these articles together, can ever be esteemed equivalent to the restitution of the Havanna; for which, indeed, the Spanish monarch had no suitable compensation to make, without dismembring his kingdom, unless he had thrown into the scale with his other concessions, that of a free navigation, without search, to the British tra∣ders on the coast of New Spain. This was an ad∣vantage with which the people of England flattered their own imaginations: but it was a privilege which the court of Madrid could not grant, without opening the avenues of a contraband trade between the English and Spanish creoles, which would have been fatal to the commerce of Old Spain: because, in that case, his catholic majesty's American sub∣jects would have supplied themselves at the first hand, with European commodities, from the trad∣ing ships of Great Britain; and great part of the wealth of that country would have been conveyed immediately to England.</P>
<P>The crown of Spain was much favoured by the article which stipulates, that the conquests, not in∣cluded in the treaty either as cessions or restitutions, shou d be restored without compensation. Neither France nor Spain had any armament on foot, from
<PB N="191" REF="1970"/>
which they could expect the least acquisition or<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> success; whereas the ministry of England had great reason to believe that the island of Luconia was al∣ready reduced.</P>
<P>On the whole, the treaty, tho' perhaps it might have been more favourable in some articles, certainly con∣firmed great and solid advantages to Great Britain; and will remain as an eternal monument of that moderation which forms the most amiable flower in the wreath of conquest.</P>
<P>Whilst the public was in suspense concerning the terms of the peace, the conduct of the West-Indian interest in parliament, the lead of which the lord-mayor of London assumed, was very remarkable. Those colonists, at this time, made no inconsiderable figure in the house of commons, and, before the fate of the peace was determined, they omitted neither pains nor expence to persuade the public that it was far more eligible for Great Britain to give up Martinico and Guadaloupe than Canada. Their reason for this was plain, because the retention of those islands must have diminished their own importance, and the clamorous efforts they made to render their own voice that of the pub∣lic, had, undoubtedly, some weight with the mi∣nistry. But no sooner did those patriots perceive, that the cession of these islands was the measure espoused by lord B—e, and that it was in a man∣ner irrevocable in the negotiation, than they joined heartily in the opposition to the whole system of the peace. This inconsistent behaviou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gave the greater disgust to wise and considerate persons, as it was well known that the former minister had,
<PB N="192" REF="1980"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> against his own sentiments, bought the friendship of those colonists at the same price.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace in Germa∣ny.</NOTE> France and England, having mutually with∣drawn themselves from the war in Germany, the courts of Vienna and Berlin began to think in earnest of an accommodation. The empress queen had but little hopes of prevailing, by her own strength alone, against a prince who had so long withstood the joint efforts of so many powerful confederates. On the other hand, the k—g of P—a had no more subsidies to expect from Great Britain, and little more to gain by contribution and compulsion in the provinces of Germany, which he had already, in a great measure, depopulated and impoverished. Perhaps he was sick of a war, which, in spite of all his activity and success, had exposed him to incredible fatigue, and repeated mortification. Both parties having expressed a de∣fire of peace, conferences were opened at Huberts∣burg, by the Austrian, Prussian, and Polish pleni∣potentiaries; and the articles were, in a little time, adjusted. The treaties of pacification between these powers imported, that the troops on all sides should be withdrawn from the countries which had been invaded and possessed in the course of the war; that peace should be re-established on the footing of former treaties, and each party sit down quietly with the loss it had sustained.</P>
<P>Such was the issue of a war, sanguinary beyond example, which had raged with uncommon fury in the four quarters of the globe; which had ruined many fair provinces; and, in the space of seven years, destroyed above a million of lives; which
<PB N="193" REF="1990"/>
had cost Great Britain, in particular, above two<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> hundred and eighty thousand men, including a great number of brave and able officers, with an incredible quantity of treasure; and increased the burthen of her national debt, from fourscore, to one hundred and thirty millions sterling.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of parlia∣ment.</NOTE> We shall now proceed to the transactions of par∣liament, especially such as most strongly attracted the public attention. Oeconomy was the avowed plan of government, and the ministry laid it down as a rule of their conduct, to retrench all the expences which had been been lavished during the two late reigns, for supporting the parliamentary interest of the court. These, upon enquiry, were found to be extravagant almost beyond belief, as a chain of venal dependency reached from the highest minister down to the meanest domestic, each being allowed, without enquiry or examination, to accu∣mulate, in the most shameful manner, profits and perquisites amounting often to ten times the value of their regulated appointments. The reformation<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reforma∣tion of the royal houshold.</NOTE> of this extravagancy, and those impositions which, instead of contributing to the dignity and support of government, debased and weakened it, occasi∣oned an outcry from the numerous dependants of the late ministers, who pleaded practice and pre∣scription in their favour; and many of them com∣plained that they had bought their posts from their superiors in office, and that therefore they had a right to make as much of them as they could. But even this reformation was performed with an equi∣table hand: the lawful wages of those who were dis∣missed
<PB N="194" REF="2000"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> were continued, even though their attend∣ance and services were not required.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficul∣ties in raising the sup∣ply.</NOTE> The savings by this measure, great as they were, were inadequate to the necessities of the public, and therefore it was found necessary to have re∣courle to some national method of supply. The more this affair was considered, the more difficult it appeared. The duties upon malt and publicans could not be extended without public distress and danger. The necessaries, conveniences, and luxu∣ries of life, were already taxed to the utmost they could bear, nor could the ablest financier in the kingdom point out an object that admitted of an additional burden. This difficulty had been fore∣seen and owned by the late ministers, when they planned the unpopular additional tax upon beer. The new ministry would have willingly taken their advice upon this subject, but they maintained a sullen reserve. The chancellor of the exchequer, within whose department the business of financing lies, had been put into that office from the opinion the minister entertained of his honesty rather than his abilities, which, in the art of raising supplies, are chiefly acquired by experience. The difficul∣ties of the government were encreased by the re∣peated declarations they had made, that a peace was necessary, in order to lighten the pressures of the people: without, perhaps, sufficiently consider∣ing, that money is equally necessary at the conclu∣sion, as in the middle, of a war, that the purposes of a peace may be established.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ways and means proposed.</NOTE> To raise the money necessary, it was proposed to take from the sinking-fund two millions; by
<PB N="195" REF="2010"/>
loans and exchequer bills, one million eight hun∣dred<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> thousand pounds; by annuities and two lot∣teries three millions five hundred thousand pounds. Nothing could be more defensible than this plan of supply; and to defray the interest of those loans, which amounted to seven million three hundred thousand pounds, an additional duty of eight pounds a ton was laid on French wines, and four pounds a ton on all other wines. No opposition was made to those imposts; but a duty of a very different kind<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duty up∣on cyder.</NOTE> this session passed into a law; it was that for imposing upon every hogshead of cyder a tax of four shillings, to be paid by the maker; and, with certain qualifi∣cations, to be subjected to all the laws of excise.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oppositi∣on to it.</NOTE> No sooner was this unpopular tax proposed, than opposition unmasked all its batteries, and attacked the whole plan of the supplies. Its patrons maintain∣ed, in direct contradiction to the ministry, and many of them to their own former declarations, that to re∣present the nation as exhausted, was advancing a fal∣lacy; that the war had paid for itself; that supplies for continuing it for two years might easily be raised; that the nation never at any time possessed so much wealth, or contained so many rich individuals, as it did at that very time; that all pretences towards oeconomy were fordid and futile; and that no plan of frugality could have any sensible operation towards the payment of the public debts, but that it might terminate in loss and disgrace. The lottery-plan was objected to as encouraging the spirit of gam∣ing, and giving an immense profit to the subscrib∣ers. The loan from the sinking-fund, that sacred
<PB N="196" REF="2020"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> deposit, was exclaimed against as only postponing the evil day, and tending to load posterity with ad∣ditional burdens.</P>
<P>Those objections came with no great weight from gentlemen, who, when they and their friends were in the administration, had complained of the difficulties of financing, had established the practice of lotteries, which, on all hands, were admitted to be necessary evils, and had given the greatest blows to the sinking-fund it ever had received. But the chief matter of declamation against the minis∣try arose from the cyder-tax. The opposition en∣deavoured to shew that in its plan, execution, and consequences, it was dangerous to the public tran∣quility; and, in short, that it might raise a rebelli∣ous spirit in those counties it was to affect. It was sisted upon, that it was partial and oppressive, be∣cause it laid a burden, that ought to be national, up∣on cyder-makers only. The method of collecting it was described in the most dreadful terms; and all the arguments that had ever been made use of against the oppression and unconstitutional tendency of excises, and of their being actually badges of slave∣ry, were renewed with all the virulence of popular and party declamation. The more refined reason∣ers against this duty urged, that from the smallness of the sum to be raised, it appeared evidently that the true object of the government was to gain a precedent which might extend the odious institu∣tion of excises to every branch of trade and manu∣factures, and consequently increase the influence of the crown, to the destruction of the properties of the people, and at last to the ruin of their liber∣ties.
<PB N="197" REF="2030"/>
So keen was the fury of opposition on this<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> occasion, that some of its patrons urged against this tax a fact which has always been looked upon to be one of the strongest arguments for excises; the cheapness of the material from which the com∣modity is produced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Answered by the friends of the go∣vern∣ment.</NOTE> Such, divested of the usual ornaments of decla∣mation and local considerations, were the argu∣ments made use of against the ministry on the cyder tax. They and their friends, however, were not wanting to themselves, and repelled the attack with superior strength of reasoning. They challeng∣ed their opponents to point out any one object that could be taxed without doing a manifest, and, per∣haps, an irreparable injury to trade and manufac∣tures, because all duties raise the price of commodi∣ties, and thereby hurt foreign trade. As taxes must fall upon the poor equally as the rich, they con∣tended that it was ridiculous to mention the wealth of individuals in that question, unless it was propos∣ed to renew the practices of privy seal loans, free-gifts, and capitation taxes. They maintained that it was absurd to think of imposing mo e taxes, or borrowing more money, without extreme necessity. That every tax must be attended with some incon∣veniency, and that the duty proposed upon cyder was the most equal and the least oppressive of any that could be mentioned. They appealed to the heads of the opposition, whether the cyder counties had ever paid in any adequate proportion to the public taxes with the malting counties, where the excise has no such exemptions in favour of the poor, as were proposed in the cyder bill; and that even the
<PB N="198" REF="2040"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> latter, though carried into a law, must leave the cyder counties less burdened than the malting coun∣ties towards the public supplies. They retorted up∣on the opposition the argument arising from the low value of the commodity, and quoted the cases of tobacco, beer, and malt spirits.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argu∣ments in favour of the ex∣cise.</NOTE> They offered to comply with any other mode of collection besides that of excise; but they clearly demonstrated that, if cyder was admitted to be a sit object for a tax, the excise was undoubtedly the me∣thod of collecting it, the most easy for the people, and the most advantageous for the government. With regard to the excise laws being so many badges of slavery, the notion arose from preposses∣sion and ignorance; because the legislature had often enlarged its bounds, particularly during the administration of Mr. Pelham, when an excise tax was imposed upon tobacco, which Sir Robert Wal∣pole would not have ventured upon; that every gentleman in England, who makes his own malt, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subject to excise laws; and that the number of British subjects dealing in exciseable commodities far exceeded the number of those whom the cyder tax was proposed to affect. That though it was true, in the question before them, the object of ex∣cise was extended, yet that its powers were con∣tracted; the cyder makers being thereby exempt∣ed from many hardships to which other dealers in exciseable commodities were subjected.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissatis∣faction without doors.</NOTE> Such is the main state of the question that was agitated previous to the passing this bill. It must be admitted that nothing but necessity, and the strongest conviction of its expediency, could justify
<PB N="199" REF="2050"/>
the ministry in carrying it through, as they did,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763</NOTE> against the torrent of opposition it met with. Their antagonists spared no pains to make the public ima∣gine that the opposition was general without doors. But that was far from being the case; for it was confined to the cyder counties, from whence it was communicated to the common-council of London, whom the tax could never affect in any degree worth mentioning. Future times, perhaps, may do justice to the integrity of the ministry, when it is considered that the counties which were to pay this tax, had been always zealously atrached to the principles upon which the new government acted, and remarkably averse to the measures of the two last reigns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Com∣plaints of the mi∣nistry.</NOTE> With regard to the excessive premiums the go∣vernment was obliged to give for money, the friends of the ministry did not seem to deny the charge, but threw the blame upon their predecessors, who, they said, had so frequently and so immoderately applied to public credit, that they had raised the terms of the lenders. They said that such was the combination of the enemies of the government, that even the return of peace had not restored it; and that those gentlemen who had leagued them∣selves with the money-dealers, and amused them with the hopes of forcing the government into their own terms, were accountable for all the dis∣agreeable consequences to the nation. They add∣ed, that it was eligible to raise money by taking it from the sinking-fund, where it might be replac∣ed, rather than by farther taxations upon indus∣try and commerce, which groaned under the loads
<PB N="200" REF="2060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> that had been laid upon them, through the profuse management of the late war. The last argument was thrown in on account of the incredible demands that were made upon the government by contrac∣tors of all kinds, foreign as well as domestic, some of whom were known to have made fortunes, dur∣ing the course of the war, of several hundred thou∣sand pounds each, and far exceeding what fell to the share even of the great duke of Marlborough, dur∣ing the same number of campaigns.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of party writings.</NOTE> Though we cannot have so low an opinion of ei∣ther house of parliament, as not to suppose that the reasons urged for the ministry had their weight with∣in doors, yet it is certain they had but little without, where the spirit which had been so industriously raised by the opposition, threatened the most dreadful conse∣quences. All the most virulent papers against govern∣ment in former days seemed to be but decent com∣positions compared to those which were circulated thro' the nation. The usual caution of not printing names at length was now laid aside; every quarter was full▪ of tumult and confusion, and the friends of the government were answered by clamour, which increased in proportion to the weakness of their opposing arguments. The lord-mayor and aldermen of London instructed their representa∣tives, in terms that conveyed no favourable ideas as to the intentions of the government, to oppose the cyder bill, as did many other counties, whose representatives, though otherwise extremely well∣affected towards the min stry, either opposed them, or did not support them in this measure.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="2070"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Firmness of the ad∣ministra∣tion.</NOTE> This storm had no manner of effect on the ad∣ministration, who steadily pursued their point, tho' the city of London presented, by the hand of the sheriffs, at the bar of the house, a petition against it. Another petition, in the same words, was that same day presented by the earl Temple in the house of lords. Both those applications proving ineffec∣tual, the petitioners, even when they knew the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill was passed, carried up a third petition to his majes∣ty in person, imploring him not to give his royal as∣sent to so much of the bill as subjects the makers of cyder and perry to excise laws. This measure was by the cooler and more disinterested part of the public, thought to be indecent as well as unconsti∣tutional; as, in fact, it meant nothing less than beseeching his majesty to prefer the advice and opi∣nion of the lord mayor, alde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>men, and common-council of London, to that of both houses of par∣liament. The bill met with a strong opposition in the house of peers, where five dukes, one marquis, ten earls, four viscounts, fourteen barons and nine bishops, opposed it; but this debate gave very lit∣tle concern to the ministry, who knew that the op∣position of several of the noble personages was con∣fined to that single point. The passing of the bill was attended by two protests, each signed by three<NOTE PLACE="marg">A protest entered.</NOTE> noblemen, who, besides the arguments we have already mentioned against the cyder act, complain∣ed loudly of the immense profits accruing to the subscribers to the loan. This opposition had no great weight with the public; and it was extremely remarkable, that the louder the clamour without doors rose against the minister, the greater was the
<PB N="202" REF="2080"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> deference paid him within doors. His levees were more crouded than those of any minister were ever known to be in England, by the greatest and most respectable subjects in the kingdom; and he carri∣ed every question of importance in parliament, by a majority seldom known in the most prosperous administrations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sudden resignati∣on of lord Bute.</NOTE> Had lord B—e been a minister by profession, he no doubt would have got the better of all opposi∣tion; but that character in him was only occasion∣al. The wish of his master's heart was to restore peace to his country, a task which his lordship had undertaken and completed. Ministerial greatness was no object for a nobleman of his turn of mind, and circumstances of fortune. He had fulfilled his engagements; he had stood the tempest of unpo∣pularity, and his power was so fixed, that he could not be displaced by faction, when, all of a sudden, he resigned it. This, amongst his friends, was consider∣ed as a daring st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, and as a challenge to his ene∣mies, by retiring to a private station. The latter triumphed for some time, as if they had driven him from the helm of government; but it soon appear∣ed that he had only voluntarily withdrawn himself; that he had forfeited no engagement; that he had abandoned no friend; and that the connections he had formed were so firm as to subsist of themselves. His resignation was, in fact, a dreadful blow upon the antimini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rial party, which had chiefly sub∣sisted by the jealousy of his influence, which they had infused into the public.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New mi∣nistry ap∣pointed.</NOTE> The professed plan of government appeared now to consist in a detachment from all continental
<PB N="203" REF="2090"/>
considerations, and a determined resolution of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> sovereign to throw down all distinctions of party, and to govern by no faction, be its denomination ever so plausible. Mr. Grenville, a man of the most practicable and useful abilities of any in the nation, and of as great experience in business, was placed at the head of the treasury. Though his expectations were great, and his natural connections powerful, yet he had no dependence, and could scarcely be said to have a friend but what his inte∣grity and affability procured him. The earls of Hallifax and Egremont continued to be the two secretaries of state, and the opposite principles of their ancestors exhibited a specimen of that coali∣tion which his majesty wanted to establish in his go∣vernment. The death of lord Egremont, in Au∣gust this year, occasioned a remove in the ministry, and the earl of Sandwich, who had been appointed to go ambassador to Spain, succeeded him as secre∣tary of state, and the earl of Egmont was appoint∣ed first lord of the admiralty. Some other removes about the same time took place, to the great sur∣prize of the public; the earl of Hillsborough be∣ing appointed first lord of trade and plantations, in the room of the earl of Shelburn, and the duke of Bedford succeeding to the vacant post of president of the council.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proposals for a coa∣lition of interests.</NOTE> His majesty, though firmly resolved as to his own conduct, at this time gave way to some overtures for a coalition of interests. The proposal was at first readily embraced, and Mr. P—tt appeared at court with great alacrity. Mr. G—lle offered, for the tranquility of his majesty's government, to
<PB N="204" REF="2100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> resign his place of first commissioner of the treasury, and to accept of any post that was not utterly in∣consistent with his rank in life. The accommoda∣tion appeared the more practicable, as the heads of the opposition were so far from being averse to a coalition with lord B—e, that they courted it. Per∣haps the new secretaries too much affected an inde∣pendency, which piqued the pride of their antago∣nists. It is certain that, at the second audience, the former minister had insisted upon terms which his majesty thought by no means compatible either with his justice or humanity, and with which he could not comply, without doing violence both to his inclinations and honour. The negotiation, con∣sequently, had no effect. But his majesty's firm∣ness and resolution made up for all inconvenien∣cies, and the administration soon returned to its na∣tural channel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the conti∣nent.</NOTE> The British ministry, at this time, had reason to congratulate themselves upon the wisdom and recti∣tude of their continental measures; for no sooner did they withdraw their subsidies and troops from Germany than that empire recovered its tranquili∣ty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forces paid by Great Britain the pre∣ceding year.</NOTE> By an abstract of the sea and land forces paid by Great Britain, during the last year of the war, they appeared to be 337, 106. This was an ex∣pence that no government could long support, as it amounted to eighteen millions a year, or 501▪ a man, upon an average. The scarcity of hands in agriculture and manufactures was incredible; women through many parts of England were em∣ployed in the most robust labours, and it appeared that the number of marines and seamen who had
<PB N="205" REF="2110"/>
died during the course of the war were no fewer<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1762.</NOTE> than 135,220. The wages of labourers now rose to be so excessive, that they could not be defrayed by the profits upon inland trade; and the common people grew insolent beyond expression. Upon the death of lord Pulteney, member of parliament for the city and liberty of Westminster, lord Wark∣worth, eldest son to the earl of Northumberland, was chosen in his room. The rejoicings made on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disorders amongst the lower ranks.</NOTE> the occasion terminated in a fray between a body of riotous sailors, (who, under pretence of being wronged of their pay, had associated together,) and the chairmen of Westminster, in which some blood was shed; and it might have been attended with still more disagreeable consequences, had not the rioters been dispersed by the guards. This, how∣ever, did not prevent the same sailors from patrol∣ling, in a tumultuous manner, through Westmin∣ster, and they carried their petitions to his majesty; but they were referred to the lords of the ad∣miralty, who promised to do them justice, and to recommend to favour all who should appear to de∣serve it. This lenity was far from quelling the out∣rage among the sailors, who now threatened the magistrates in the execution of their office. Upon enquiry it was found, that they were spirited up by a number of lewd women, who were harboured about Tower-Hill, Wapping, and that neighbour∣hood, and who were protected by the sailors against the constables, who were sent by the justices of the peace of that division to apprehend them. The ci∣vil power thus proving ineffectual, the military was called in, and a guard was sent from the Tower.
<PB N="206" REF="2120"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> The sailors encreased to such numbers, that the guard was twice reinforced, and the consequences must have been dreadful, had not a sea officer, for whom the sailors had a regard, appeared, and call∣ed them off just as the soldiers were about to fire. The magistrates then ventured to order some of their loose women to be committed to Bridewell; but they were rescued from the guard, not without bloodshed.</P>
<P>The like spirit of disorder affected other parts of the kingdom, nor was even confinement itself any preservative against intemperance and riot. The East-India company had been obliged to give vast wages to their recruits, whom they confined in the Savoy: here they rose upon their guard, who were forced to kill three of them, and wound many others, before they could be quelled. Never were murders of the most cruel kind more frequent, nor robberies more audacious, than those with which the public were now every day alarmed. Liber∣tinism at the same time seemed to take possession of the theatres, which were filled with tumult<NOTE PLACE="marg">Learning encou∣raged in America.</NOTE> and confusion; but a spirit of benevolence ex∣tended itself to the foundations for learning in Philadelphia and New-York, and very large col∣lections were made all over England for their be∣nefit. This season produced one remarkable of∣fender, whose crime became a national affair, and therefore requires to be particularly mentioned here.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case,</NOTE> One Rice, an exchange-broker, of a fair charac∣ter in trade, and supposed to be of a considerable fortune, had been entrusted by a lady to receive
<PB N="207" REF="2130"/>
her dividends of South-sea stock, and to send it to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> her in the country. During the negotiations for peace, the various turns they met with encouraged a spirit of gaming in Exchange▪alley, especially among the brokers, some of whom, and Rice among the rest, suffered largely by the fluctuation of the stocks. Dreading the loss of credit, he forged a letter of attorney from this lady, impowering him to sell her stock, to the amount of 5000 l. and it is said he practised the same fraud upon others of his employers, without their suspecting the matter, as he regularly transmitted them their dividends, and sometimes even replaced the stock. His losses multiplying, he was unable to remain longer with∣out detection, especially as he understood that the lady whom he had defrauded was coming up to town, and would infallibly discover the forgery. The remains of his fortune, besides his furniture and equipages, which were very elegant, amounted to five thousand four hundred pounds, five thou∣sand of which he deposited with his wife, in bank∣bills, and privately withdrew, with the remainder, to Harwich, from whence he procured a passage to Holland, leaving orders with his wife, who ra∣ther suspected, than knew, his circumstances, to fol∣low him. She accordingly took shipping for Hol∣land, but being forced back to Harwich, she fell into the hands of those who were in pursuit of her husband. Being brought up to London, and ex∣amined before the lord-mayor, she readily gave up the bank-notes that were in her hands, to the amount of four thousand seven hundred pounds. Her answers to the questions asked of her were so
<PB N="208" REF="2140"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> candid, that the directors of the South-Sea compa∣ny, who thought proper to replace the stock to the lady, allowed her a pension.</P>
<P>The crime committed by Rice was of the most dangerous tendency, especially in a commercial country, and indeed became a common concern to all the traders in Europe, who had any connecti∣ons of credit. The English government thought the offence of such a nature, that no local protection was due to the offender, and the place of his retreat was soon discovered by a letter which he wrote to his agent, who immediately carried it to the lord∣mayor. By this it appeared that he had taken re∣fuge in Cambray. The juncture was favourable for bringing him to punishment, as the duke of Bedford was then negotiating the peace at Paris, and the French court was willing to oblige that of Great Britain. His grace, by his majesty's order, applied to have Rice apprehended at Cambray, which was accordingly done, and he was sent over<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial, and execution of Rice the brok∣er.</NOTE> to England, where he was tried at the Old-Bailey for forgery, convicted, and executed; but it ap∣peared he had no accomplices. The compliance shewn by the French court on this occasion was the more remarkable, as several of their subjects, obnoxious to them, were at that very time said to be sheltered and protected in England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the East-India compa∣ny's af∣fairs.</NOTE> The affairs of the East-India company began now more than ever to engross the attention of the public, and two parties were formed, said to be of very different interests. Lord Clive headed the one; and Mr. Sullivan, a director of great abilities and eminence, the other. Mr. Rous was the chair∣man,
<PB N="209" REF="2150"/>
whose interest lord Clive espoused: he was<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> accused by the other party of a dangerous inatten∣tion to the interests of the company during the late negotiations for peace. At a meeting held the middle of March, a motion was made for giving Mr. Rous thanks for his prudent management and attention to the interests of the company, in the late negotiations for a peace with France; and, after a long and warm debate, the question was carried in the affirmative <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the late negotia∣tion was set on foot, our East-India company was applied to by his majesty's servants, to know on what footing they would chuse to have the affairs in the East-Indies set∣tled: they drew the tenth ar∣ticle in the preliminaries; it was signed by their chairman, sent to his majesty's minister, and by him transmitted to the noble duke then at Paris: which article was transcribed into the preliminaries, verba∣tim, as it came from the East-India company, and the pre∣liminaries were deferred sign∣ing forty-eight hours, as an honourable member of the house of commons declared, waiting for that article.</NOTE>. As this court consisted of above six hundred and fifty members, the fullest ever known, it was considered as a prelude to affairs of more importance; but it appeared, during the course of the following month, that the interest of the noble candidate for a seat in the direction was inferior to that of his antagonist. An unexpected revolution in the company's affairs abroad, which shall be taken notice of in its proper place, soon turned the scale.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Shocking abuse of mad-houses.</NOTE> Among the other affairs of importance which this year came before the parliament, was the re∣gulation of private mad-houses, nuisances that had
<PB N="210" REF="2160"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> risen to an incredible height in England, but espe∣cially in London and its neighbourhood. A com∣mittee was appointed to enquire into the state of this growing evil; and it appeared that many of the private mad-houses were no other than places of correction and imprisonment for persons whose relations found it for their interest that they should be sequestered from the public. One of those private bridewells was situated at Chelsea. It received all who were brought to it; and though it was not pretended that they were lunatics, yet they were treated as such. Wives were shut up at the request of their husbands, and drunkenness was a sufficient cause for one person to imprison another, to debar him from all access to pen, ink, and paper, and to keep him from the knowledge of his nearest relations, if they should call for him at the place of confinement. It was farther proved, that any per∣son might be thus confined, upon application to the master of the house, and engaging for the regular payment of a stipulated sum. Those, and other circumstances, equally detestable, were fully made out before the committee, who heard them with the deepest concern and indignation. But, though it was generally expected that measures would have been taken, not only for preventing the like abuses for the future, but that the delinquents would have been brought to condign punishment for what had passed: yet, to the inexpressible sur∣prize of the public, the whole was dropped, and a scene which was thought to be of greater import∣ance was now opened.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. The rage of writing conti∣nues.</NOTE> The steadiness of his majesty in supporting the alterations he had made in his ministry, disconcert¦ed the old ministers and their friends to a degree of inquietude scarcely to be conceived, especially after they saw that their successors displaced their subor∣dinate creatures from many offices and departments of government. As they could complain of no unconstitutional measure that had been pursued, and as the votes of parliament fully vindicated the conduct of the ministry, they had recourse to the most desperate expedients for inflaming the lower ranks of people. Though the new ministry might have easily crushed the authors of the papers and pamphlets published against them in the ordinary course of law-proceedings, (as their names were printed at full length in many audacious libels,) yet they persevered in the most amazing contempt and disregard of all the abuse offered to their own persons, especially in a periodical publication of a paper called the North Briton, which was insolent and attrocious beyond the example of all former oppositions, in the most distempered periods of go∣vernment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imprison∣ment of Mr. Wilkes,</NOTE> One Mr. Wilkes, member of parliament for Aylesbury, was at very little pains to conceal that he was the author of this paper, which, in point of wit, language, or argument, could never have attracted the attention of the public, had not the minds of the people, by the arts of faction, been inflamed to a degree of madness Wilkes was lively but superficial, and in his morals he was said to be dissipated even to profligacy. He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad more than once applied to the new ministers
<PB N="212" REF="2190"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> for a post that might repair his shattered for∣tunes; but prepossessions arising from his cha∣racter were so strong against him, that failing of success, he resolved, as he openly declar∣ed, to try how far it was practicable to carry the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>centiousness of writing, under pretext of ex∣er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ising the liberty of the press. Perceiving the next to stoical indifference of the ministry with regard to their own persons, he aimed his abuse at majesty itself, and, in the forty-fifth number of his paper, animadverted upon the king's speech in parliament, with an acrimony so indecent towards his majesty's probity as well as person, that the ministers could no longer avoid giving orders for seizing the printer, and all concerned in the pub∣lication. Those orders were contained in a war∣rant of a general nature, under the hand of lord Hallifax, directed to four of his majesty's messen∣gers, commanding them to apprehend, without specifying their names, the authors, printers, and publishers of that seditious and treasonable paper; and the publisher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">George <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Ludgate-street.</NOTE> being accordingly apprehended, his examination afforded sufficient ground for fix∣ing up n Mr. Wilkes as the author.</P>
<P>This warrant, though afterwards pronounced to be illegal by a lord chief justice, was, in point of form and substance, the same that had always been issued by former secretaries of state, and even by Mr. P—tt and the d—e of N—e, whose party now openly contended that it was subversive
<PB N="213" REF="2200"/>
of the British constitution. On the 29th of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> late at night, the messengers entered the house of Mr. Wilkes, and produced their warrant, which he refused to comply with, on account of its general terms; but next morning they returned, and car∣ried him in a coach before one of the secretaries of state, partly, as he alledged, by force. In the mean time a motion was made in the court of Common Pleas, for an habeas corpus; which was granted. The seizure and sealing up of pa∣pers, when any person was taken into custody for a libel, though not treasonable, had always been customary, and the practice had been strenuously defended, especially under whig ministers. The same proceeding was observed on this occasion, but with an indulgence to Mr. Wilkes which had not been shewn to former prisoners in his situation; for the under-secretary of state, and the solicitor of the treasury, attended, and invited the friends of Mr. Wilkes to be present at sealing up his papers, an operation which had in past times been always performed by the messenger, (were he ever so rude or illiterate,) who took the delinquent into custody. Mr. Wilkes, after his examination, of course was committed to close prison (the Tower of London) by the two secretaries of state. Earl T—le went to pay him a visit, but was denied admittance by major Rainsford, the officer of the Tower, who had him in custody. His counsel and solicitor soon after made the same application, but met with the like refusal, the major alledging, that he had re∣ceived orders from the secretary of state, not to admit any person whatever to see or speak with the
<PB N="214" REF="2210"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> prisoner. Next day the major repeated his refusal of admittance to several noblemen and gentlemen of distinction, but readily gave to the council and solicitor for Mr. Wilkes a copy of his commitment. The solicitor of the treasury▪ who is generally the manager of government-prosecutions, interced∣ed with the major for leave of admittance to Mr Wilkes's lawyers; but the major continued inflexible in his refusal. By this time, the court of Common Pleas had ordered a return to their writ of habeas corpus, which having been serv∣ed upon the messengers only, th ir return was that Mr. Wilkes was not then in their custody. The court not judging that return to be sufficient, would not suffer it to be filed▪ and another writ of habeas corpus was granted, directed to the constable of the Tower of London and his officers; and in consequence of this, Mr. Wilkes was brought up next day (May the 3d) to Westminster-hall. Up∣on his entering the court he made a formal speech, replete with virulent expressions against the mini∣stry, affected compliments to the person of his majesty, and laboured encomiums upon himself, as the dauntless champion and persecuted sufferer in the cause of public liberty. Pleadings followed on both sides; and Mr. Wilkes was remanded to the Tower, till Friday the 6th of May, that the judges might have leisure to form their opinion; but in the intermediate time his friends and law∣yers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is released on ac∣count of privilege.</NOTE> were to have free admittance to his person.</P>
<P>Being accordingly, on that day, brought back to court, he made another speech, still more la∣boured than the former, but of the same inflam∣matory
<PB N="215" REF="2220"/>
tendency. Lord chief justice Pratt then<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> proceeded to give the opinion of the court. He stated the case in hand under three heads First, the legality of Mr. Wilkes's commitment. Se∣condly, the necessity for a specification of those particular passages in the 45th numb. of the North Briton, which had been deemed a libel. And, thirdly, Mr. Wilkes's privilege as a member of parliament. Under the first head, his lordship thought that the commitment of Mr. Wilkes was not illegal, because, though the warrant of a se∣cretary of state in such a case was not of superior force to that of a justice of peace, and though no magistrate had, in reality, a right, <HI>ex officio,</HI> to apprehend any person, without stating the particu∣lar crime of which he was accused; yet at the same time he observed "there were many precedents where a nice combination of circumstances gave so strong a suspicion of facts, that though the magi∣strate could not be justified <HI>ex officio,</HI> he was, ne∣vertheless, supported in the commitment, even without receiving any particular information for the foundation of the charge."</P>
<P>As to the second division, he was of opinion that there was no necessity for the specification mentioned; and thought that if the whole of the obnoxious paper had been inserted in the body of the warrant, yet it did not at that time come under his cognizance; nor could it, without the assistance of a jury.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Opinon of the lord chief jus∣tice on that head.</NOTE> Upon the third head, he remarked, "that there were but three cases which could possibly affect the privilege of a member of parliament, and these were
<PB N="216" REF="2230"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> <HI>treason, felony,</HI> and the <HI>peace,"</HI> or which is the same thing, the breach of it. He observed that the com∣mitment of the bishops for endeavouring to disturb the peace happened in an arbitrary reign, when there was but one honest judge in the court of King's Bench. He concluded, that "Mr. Wilkes stood accused of writing a libel; a libel in the sense of the law was a <HI>high misdemeanor,</HI> but did not come within the description of <HI>treason, felony,</HI> or <HI>breach of the peace:</HI> at most, it had but a tenden∣cy to <HI>disturb</HI> the <HI>peace,</HI> and consequently could not be sufficient to destroy the privilege of a member of parliament."</P>
<P>The court then discharged Mr. Wilkes, who returned the judges his thanks in the name of the public, and of the whole English nation, and eve∣ry subject of the English crown, for his liberty; though it is very evident that he obtained it only under the circumstance of his being a member of parliament. As it is the chief duty of history to record facts as they arise, it is sufficient here to ob∣serve that many other eminent lawyers, and in∣deed a majority of the house of commons, were of opinion that no privilege was due in such cases▪ and it was observed that the only triumph which the minority could boast of on this occasion, was a temporary deliverance of Mr. Wilkes on the above account; but that he was still subject to a prose∣cution by the attorney general, which his majesty had ordered.</P>
<P>During the course of this affair several inci∣dents happened that were the subjects of the pub∣lic's amusement, rather than its attention. The
<PB N="217" REF="2240"/>
day after Mr. Wilkes was delivered from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> Tower he wrote a letter to the two secretaries of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letters between Mr. Wilkes and the secreta∣ries of state.</NOTE> state, complaining, that, during his confinement, his house had been robbed; and that being inform∣ed his goods were in the custody of their lordships, he insisted upon restitution. Next day he repaired to a justice of peace, and demanded a warrant to search the houses of the two secretaries; which the magistrate refused to grant. Though nothing could be more impotent and extravagant than those proceedings; yet the secretaries, to the surprize of the friends of the government, thought proper to return, under their own hands, a serious answer to his charge; which afforded him a commodious han∣dle to send their lordships a reply stuffed with in∣sults and scurrility, but such as added to his cha∣racter among the vulgar. His majesty, at the same time ordered the earl of Egremont to signify to earl Temple, who was lord lieutenant of the county of Buckingham, his pleasure, that Mr. Wilkes should be dismissed from being colonel of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Wilkes removed from be∣ing colo∣nel of the militia.</NOTE> the Buckinghamshire militia; and this command was intimated to Mr. Wilkes with apparent reluctancy by his lordship, who was himself soon after removed from the lieutenancy of the same county, to make way for lord Despencer, late sir Francis Dash∣wood. The letters that passed on Mr. Wilkes's be∣ing removed were likewise published, and industri∣ously circulated, to swell the popular clamour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An infor∣mation filed a∣gainst him.</NOTE> While Mr. Wilkes affected to be thought the champion of a party, he was no other than the tool of a faction. The men of sense in the opposition despised, shunned, and hated him; nor could all

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the efforts made use o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by him and his friends pro∣duce any general measure for supporting either his cause or himself, though they well knew the state of his private finances. To give himself some co∣lour of importance he publicly advertised the print∣ing all the proceedings against him at a private press he set up in his own house; and the exorbi∣tant price at which they were to be sold, was a suf∣ficient evidence that he intended this publication should indemnify him for his sufferings and ex∣pence, and support him against the prosecution he was threatened with. But even this exped<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, plausible and practicable as it appeared to be, had very little effect in his favour. I he ministry were so far from being intimidated, that an information was filed against him in the court of King's Bench, for bring the author of the North Briton, N<SUP>o</SUP> 45.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the personal veracity of Mr. Wilkes receive a severe shock by his being called<NOTE PLACE="marg">His vera∣city ques∣tioned.</NOTE> upon in the public papers to make good an asser∣tion he had advanced in his speech at the court of Common Pleas that corrupt offers had been made to him by the government; and to declare when, how, o by whom such offers were made, and what they were. Neither Mr. Wilkes nor any of his friends thought proper to take any notice of this peremptory challenge, though often repeated, and affecting his moral character in the most sen∣sible part.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads of the opposition at this time flatter∣ed themselves that no part of the magistracy of London would address his Majesty upon the peace;
<PB N="219" REF="2260"/>
but on the 12th of May, while the public was in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the highest suspence concerning the fate of Mr. Wilkes, the address of the lord-mayor and alder∣men<NOTE PLACE="marg">Address of the lord may∣or and al∣dermen of London.</NOTE> was carried up. It was worded with remark∣able decency, as they grounded their approbation of the peace upon that which it had already receiv∣ed from parliament, and they shewed a becoming abhorrence of the spirit of faction then arising. Great pains were taken by the lower part of the ci∣tizens to ridicule and vilify this measure; but it served to disabuse the public, especially as to the opinion which had been propagated concerning the aversion of the city of London towards the late treaty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">King's speech.</NOTE> Upon the meeting of the parliament on the 15th of November, his majesty's speech from the throne exhorted the members to cultivate the arts of peace in such a manner as might most effectually contribute to extend the commerce and augment the happiness of his kingdoms. He requested the commons to employ their utmost attention, and the strictest frugality, as to the heavy debts con∣tracted in the late war, for many of which no pro∣vision had been made. He recommended to them the care and support of the fleet, and informed them that he had directed the money arising from the sale of the prizes vested in the crown to be applied to the public service; and that he in∣tended to reserve for the same use, whatever sums should be produced by the sale of any of the lands belonging to himself in the islands of the West-Indies that were ceded by the late treaty. To∣wards

"And we beg leave (concluded their lordships) to assure your majesty, that by our zeal and application in bringing all of∣fenders of that sort to justice, as well as by our proceedings in general, we will endeavour to give such an example, as may induce your majesty's subjects to unite in discouraging a licentiousness, which is so repugnant to the true principles of this happy constitution; and in promoting such mea∣sures as may equally conduce to the honour and dignity of your majesty's crown, and to their own happiness and security."</P>
<P>The commons were equally dutiful in their ad∣dress of thanks, which turned upon the same to∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s as that of the peers. It was expected, and indeed declared by all the friends of the opposition, that those addresses, especially those relating to the licentious spirit of the nation, would have brought on a strong debate; but the addresses passed without any division. This was owing to
<PB N="221" REF="2280"/>
the remains of a misunderstanding between the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> party headed by the d. of N. and that which con∣sidered Mr. P. as its leader; each recriminating on the other for their pusillanimity and indeci∣sion. The truth, perhaps, was, that the heads of both thought that there was still an opening for them to make their terms, and which they were unwilling to shut up, by espousing a cause which neither of them in private approved of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Com∣plaint in the house of com∣mons a∣gainst Mr. Wilkes.</NOTE> Before the king's speech was reported to the house of commons, the chancellor of the Exchequer, by his majesty's▪ command, acquainted the house "that his majesty having received information, that John Wilkes, esq; a member of that house, was the author of a most seditious and dangerous libel, published since the (then) last session of parli∣ament, he had caused the said John Wilkes, esq; to be apprehended, and secured, in order to his being tried for the same, by due course of law; and Mr. Wilkes having been discharged out of custody by the court of Common Pleas, upon ac∣count of his privilege as a member of that house; and having, when called upon by the legal pro∣cess of the court of king's bench, stood out, and declined to appear and answer to an information, which had since been exhibited against him by his majesty's attorney-general for the same offence; in this situation his majesty being de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irous to shew all possible attention to the privileges of the house of commons, in every instance wherein they can be supposed to be concerned; and at the same time thinking it of the utmost importance, not to suffer

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An▪ 1763.</NOTE> the public justice of the kingdom to be eluded, had chosen to direct the said libel, and also copies of the examinations, upon which Mr. Wilkes was apprehended and secured, to be laid before that house for their consideration: and then Mr. chan∣cellor of the Exchequer delivered the said papers in at the table."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their proceed∣ings.</NOTE> The house upon this unanimously resolved to pre∣sent an address of thanks to his majesty, and to assure him that they would forthwith take the very impor∣tant matter of his message into their consideration. In their proceedings on this affair the members per∣ceived that the government had been well founded in their prosecution of Mr. Wilkes, by the examina∣tion of Kearsley the publisher, and one Balf a printer. The question, even after this, admitted of great debates; and it was strongly urged by the gentlemen in the opposition, that no greater li∣berties had been taken by the author of the ob∣noxious paper, with regard to his majesty's speech than what had been common upon former occasions of the same kind; and that the speech of the king had never been considered in any other light than that of the minister, and had always been treated with equal freedom. The house, however, was of opinion that under no former opposition such abusive terms, or so personally disrespectful to ma∣jesty, had ever been made use of; and therefore it was resolved by a great majority, "That the paper, intitled The North Briton, No 45, is a false, scan∣dalous, and seditious libel, containing expressions of the most unexampled insolence, and contumely towards his majesty, the grossest aspersions upon
<PB N="223" REF="2300"/>
both houses of parliament, and the most audacious<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> defiance of the authority of the whole legislature; and most manifestly tending to alienate the af∣fections of the people from his majesty, to with∣draw them from their obedience to the laws of the realm, and to excite them to traiterous insur∣rections."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No 45 of the North Briton or∣dered to be burnt.</NOTE> In consequence of this resolution, an order was made, that the said paper should be burnt by the hands of the common hangman; but the further consideration of it was put off from one o'clock in the morning of Wednesday the 16th to one of the clock the same day. No legal conviction yet lying against Mr. Wilkes of his being the au∣thor of the paper, he complained to the house the same day, of breach of privilege, by the imprisonment of his person, the plundering of his house, the seizure of his papers, and the serv∣ing him with a subpoena upon an information in the court of King's Bench. As this complaint certainly was regular, the house resolved to take it into consideration on Tuesday the 17th.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duel be∣tween Mr. Mar∣tin and Mr. Wilkes▪</NOTE> Besides the single paper complained of, a col∣lection of all the other numbers of the North Bri∣ton had been reprinted, by order of Mr. Wilkes, in the most unguarded manner. Among other names inserted at full length, in this collection, was that of Samuel Martin, esq▪ member of parlia∣ment for Camelford, and late first secretary of the treasury, attended with a most in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amous character of his person and morals. It being no longer doubted that Mr. Wilkes was princ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pally concern∣ed in this publication, Mr. Martin, thought it
<PB N="224" REF="2310"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> incumbent on him to demand satisfaction for the wanton injury that had been offered him. A duel with pistols in Hyde-Park ensued, in which both parties behaved like men of courage; but Mr. Wilkes was wounded in the body so dangerously, that he was in no condition to appear in the house of commons, when the matter of his complaint was to be heard. On the 16th, however, the farther consideration of his majesty's message was put off till the 18th; and, through the speaker's illness, the house did not proceed upon it till the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resoluti∣ons with regard to privilege.</NOTE> 23d, when a motion was made, "That privilege of parliament does not extend to the case of writing and publishing seditious libels, nor ought to be allowed to obstruct the ordinary course of the laws, in the speedy and effectual prosection of so heinous and dangerous an offence." As this resolution was far from being agreeable to the opi∣nion given by the lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, a great debate arose; which being adjourn∣ed, in complainsance to the speaker, was not deter∣mined till the 24th, when it was carried by a ma∣jority of 125. A number of members on this oc∣casion spoke and voted against the resolution, on∣ly because they thought it was a matter founded in the constitution, independent of all party-conside∣ration. With regard to the debate concerning the complaint of Mr. Wilkes for breach of privilege, it was put off on account of his wound.</P>
<P>After the commons had agreed to the above im∣portant resolutions, it was ordered, that lord Strange should go up to the house of lords to desire a con∣ference for obtaining the concurrence of their
<PB N="225" REF="2320"/>
lordships; which was accordingly granted, and their<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Both houses join in an address to the king.</NOTE> lordships agreed to the resolutions. It was then resolved by the commons, "That the printed pa∣per, intitled, the North Briton, N<SUP>o</SUP> 45 which was communicated to the lords at the last conference, be burnt by the hands of the common hangman, at the Royal Exchange in London; upon Satur∣day next, at one of the clock; and that the she∣riffs of London do then attend, and cause the same to be burnt there accordingly." The com∣mons obtained this concurrence of the lords to the resolution likewise, as they did to another, which was unanimously agreed upon, to express their sur∣prize and indignation at the scandalous and sediti∣ous libel which they had censured. This address was drawn up in terms of such warm affection for his majesty's person and government, that it was evident the two houses meant it as a mark of their signal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of such libellous writings, and as a proof to all Europe that their sentiments and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of the ministry were the same, whatever pains might be taken to impress foreigners with an oppo∣site opinion. His majesty, by his answer, seemed to take a peculiar satisfaction in this address, which wonderfully disconcerted the opposition, and left no farther handle for pretending, as was most in∣dustriously given out, that matters in parliament were ready to take a turn to the disadvantage of the government.</P>
<P>Hitherto the charge of being the author of the obnoxious paper had not, by any regular mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, been urged personally against Mr. Wilkes; but, on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> December, when the members resum∣ed

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the farther consideration of his majesty's message<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Wilkes proved to be the au∣thor of the North Briton.</NOTE> of the 15th of Nov. the house was informed that evidence was ready to be produced of Mr. Wilkes' being the author; and his wound still disabling him from his attendance, it was ordered that he should answer the charge, ready to be produced against him, on that day seven-night, when his own complaint of breach of privilege was to be heard<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riot upon burning the same.</NOTE> likewise. While this matter was depending, the sheriffs of London, who were the honourable Mr. Harley, and Richard Blunt, esq; endeavoured to execute the order of the two houses, by burning the 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th number of the North Briton at the Royal Exchange; but the mob proved so riotous on this occasion, that they rescued the paper from the exe∣cutioner before it was consumed, pelted the con∣stables, and other peace-officers, and even put Mr. sheriff Harley in danger of his life. This riot being reported in the two houses of parliament, they entered very seriously in consideration of its consequences: and resolved, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lords had examined Mr. alderman Harley, "that the rio∣ters were perturbators of the public peace, dange∣rous to the liberties of this country, and obstruc∣tors of the national justice." The two sherisss at the same time had the thanks of the house for their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> behaviour on that occasion; and the two houses joined unanimously in an address to his ma∣jestly, that he would give directions for the disco∣very of the rioters.</P>
<P>The walls of parliament as yet contained the de∣ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es on this affair, which was of far greater im∣portance than the public at first apprehended.
<PB N="227" REF="2340"/>
The resolutions of neither house could deter∣mine<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the great points depending on it, for those were cognizable only in a court of law. In the July preceding, the journeymen printers who had been seized and confined on suspicion of printing the North Briton brought actions against the mes∣sengers on that account. On the first action that was tried the plaintiff recovered 300l. damages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verdicts obtained by the printers.</NOTE> and 200l. was allowed to each of the others, who were thirteen in number. It appeared from those trials that the plaintiffs were not really guilty of the fact for which they had been seized; that the messengers had been misled by the general terms of the warrants; and that room was left for contesting their validity. At the same time, the cooler and more judicious part of the public thought the damanges, considering the state and circumstances of the parties, were exorbitant; and that the verdicts in their favour would only serve to exasperate the ministers, when it should be their turns to prosecute. Mr. Wilkes, who no doubt was highly encouraged by the verdicts the printers had obtained, brought his action likewise against the late secretary of state for seizing his pa∣pers; and on the 6th of December, after a hearing of near fifteen hours before lord chief justice Pratt, and a special jury in the court of Common Pleas, he obtained a verdict with 1000l. damages, and costs of suit. In the charge given on this occasion by the judge to the jury, his lordship pronounced the warrant under which Mr. Wilkes was seized, illegal; but very modestly submitted his own opi∣nion to the other judges and the house of peers,
<PB N="228" REF="2350"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 176<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> ending his speech with the following remarkable<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able speech of the chief justice.</NOTE> words: "If these higher jurisdictions should de∣clare my opinion erroneous, I submit, as will be∣come me, and kiss the rod; but I must say, I shall always consider it as a rod of iron for the chastise∣ment of the people of Great-Britain."</P>
<P>So solemn a decision was considered by the gen∣tlemen in the opposition as a matter of triumph, which they endeavoured to improve by a most ri∣diculous incident which happened on the night the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt upon Mr. Wilkes by a mad∣man.</NOTE> verdict was obtained. One Dunn, a Scotchman, and a lunatic, having been overheard to make use of some threatening expressions against Mr. Wilkes, the latter was apprized of them, and Dunn next morning making an effort to get admission into the house of Mr. Wilkes, whose wound still con∣fined him to his room, he was seized upon, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armed of a penknife, which the party reported was to be the instrument for assassinating Mr. Wilkes. The lunatic, Dunn, was committed to the custody of a tipstaff, and Mr. Wilkes's friends took the matter up so seriously, that a com∣plaint was made to the house of commons, who or∣dered the tip staff to bring Dunn to their bar, and the evidences against him to attend at the same time. Before this could be done, the house was satisfied, by indisputable evidence, that Dunn was a madman; and he was remitted to the course of common law, which confined him for some time to prison for want of ba l. Though nothing could be more plain than the insanity of this wretch, yet the party still continued to asfirm that he was an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because he was a Scotchman, and even

Mr. Wilkes declined to admit them, though at the request of Mr. Martin he had suffered them to at∣tend him before; but sent for Dr. Duncan, a phy∣sician, and Mr. Middleton, a surgeon, who were Scotchmen; and they attended him accordingly▪ The commons adjourning during the Christmas holi∣days, Mr. Wilkes made use of that opportunity to go over to France; but his friends gave out that he certainly would attend the house on the 16th of January, which was the last day fixed for his ap∣pearance. On the meeting of the house the speak∣er produced a letter he had received from Mr. Wilkes dated from Paris, and inclosing a certifi∣cate of one of the French king's physicians, and another from a surgeon of the French army concerning the state of his health, but both of them without any notorial attestation. Those pa∣pers being read, all the gentlemen of the faculty, who had attended Mr. Wilkes, were again exa∣mined; and then the house, by a great majority, voted, that by withdrawing himself to a foreign country, without assigning a sufficient cause, he had

On the 19th of Ja∣nuary<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> one of his majesty's principal secretaries of state accused Mr. Wilkes, in the house of lords▪ of violating the most sacred ties of religion as well as decency, by printing in his own house a book or pamphlet, intitled, "an Essay on Woman, with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the Es∣say on Woman,</NOTE> notes or remarks."

The book itself, though printed with the utmost secrecy, had been communicated, through Mr. Wilkes's own inadvertency, to the secretary by a journeyman printer, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a co∣py, and the very mention of its contents <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the public with horror.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> The minority in the lower house now pro∣ceeded<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates in the house of commons concern∣ing gene∣ral war∣rants,</NOTE> upon a question which was of general con∣cern to the nation, and the liberty not only of the press, but of the subject. On the 14th of Febru∣ary a motion was made by Sir W. M. in the house of commons, "That a general warrant for appre∣hending and seizing the authors, printers, and pub∣lishers of a seditious libel, together with their pa∣pers, is not warranted by law." As several cases were then depending before the courts of law, in which juries, and judges likewise, might be influ∣enced
<PB N="233" REF="2400"/>
by this resolution, should it have passed, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> friends of the administration objected to it. They insisted that it was a point not proper for the cog∣nisance of the house at that time, as uninterrupted usage had given it a sanction, and as it did not ap∣pear to have been abused in the instance referred to. They thought that the confining the resolu∣tion to the case of general warrants against a sediti∣ous libel only, was a kind of a tacit approbation of their being employed in all other cases; and that therefore the resolution, as it then stood, would ra∣ther strenthen than prevent the evil complained of. They farther urged, that should a court of law con∣form themselves to the proposed resolution (which, though it should pass, would not be law) and if the lords, in their judicial capacities, when appealed to, should decree for the legality of the general warrants, the consequences both with regard to the courts of law, and the dignity of the house of commons, must be very disagreeable.</P>
<P>During the debate, the friends of the ministry were far from vindicating the practice of general warrants, but they thought that the abuse of them could not be effectually prevented by a resolution of one house upon a single case; and that the re∣medy should be provided by an act of parliament, after most solemn debate and deliberation, distin∣guishing cases, and specifying those discretionary powers, which the contingent exigencies of govern∣ment require to be vested in a secretary of state. Sir John Philips, who was one of the majority, expressed himself with great warmth against the abuse of general warrants, and, with the approba∣tion
<PB N="234" REF="2410"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> of the first commissioner of the treasury, un∣dertook to bring in a bill for those purposes that very session. Such a bill was actually brought in, but it was treated by the gentlemen in the mino∣rity with a mixture of ridicule and contempt, on pretence that Sir John was not in earnest, and that they had no power to regulate an abuse. It was replied, that the bill was meant to regulate the practice; but they appeared determined to oppose the bill and it was accordingly withdrawn, the de∣bate being adjourned to the 17th of February.</P>
<P>When the house met again, it appeared beyond all contradiction, that the motion, should it pass, was ineffectual for redressing the evil; and, after long debates, it was drawn up in the following manner: <Q>“That a general warrant for apprehend∣ing and seizing the authors, printers, and publish∣ers, of a seditious and TREASONABLE l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bel, toge∣ther with their papers, is not warranted by law; although such warrant hath been issued accord∣ing to the usage of office, and hath been fre∣quently produced to, and, so far as appears to this house, the validity thereof hath never been debated in the court of King's bench, but the parties thereupon have been frequently bailed by the said court.”</Q> This state of the question, as it was amended, (if not by the heads of the mino∣rity, yet with their concurrence and consent), sub∣jected it to new and insurmountable difficulties, because upon debate it was found, that it implied no less than a charge of perjury upon the court of King's bench, for admitting to bail persons com∣mitted upon such illegal warrants, instead of giving
<PB N="235" REF="2420"/>
them a free discharge. It was likewise thought<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> pretty extraordinary that the word TREASONABLE, contained in the earl of Hallifax's general warrant for apprehending the authors, printers, and pub∣lishers of the North Briton No. 45. was omitted in the original motion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That the reader may have a more clear idea of this debate, we shall here tran∣scribe the words of the gene∣ral warrant.</P>

<P>During the discussion of this important trial of skill, as it may be called, between the two parties, the gentlemen of the opposition flattered themselves with the hopes of obtaining the most decisive ad∣vantages, and, indeed, the plausibility of their ar∣guments brought over to their side some who were the most determined friends to the government in all other cases. Having thus, for the sake of per∣spicuity, preserved the narrative of the case of Mr. Wilkes, and the great questions to which it led, from being interrupted by any other matter, we shall resume the thread of our history.</P>

It has been mentioned that Jaffier Ali Cawn, who was rais∣ed to the nabobsh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p of Bengal, had been depos∣ed for his cruelty and mal administration, by the influence and address of the English president Vansittart; and that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his son-in-law, Cossim Ali Cawn, had succeeded him in the nabobship; and had confirmed and augmented the privileges of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs and revo∣lutions in the East Indies.</NOTE> English company in the East Indies. Later ad∣vices have explained the causes of that extraordi∣nary revolution, which appears to have been chief∣ly owing to the j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es which the English East-India company's servants there entertained, that Mhir Jaffier endeavoured to render himself inde∣pendent of the company, by assassinating, or ba∣nishing from his court, all persons of any figure or consequence, who were known to favour the Eng∣lish.
<PB N="237" REF="2440"/>
He was suspected of having entered into<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> measures with the Dutch for calling them in to his assistance against the power and influence of the English in the country, and of his having offered to sacrifice the company's servants and interests to shah Zaddah, who pretended to be the true heir of the mogul empire. In short, it was pretended, that, by a se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of cruelties and oppressions of various kinds, he had rendered it scandalous for the Eng∣lish to support his tyrannic government any longer; having brought the company's and his own affairs to the very brink of ruin. Such was the charge that was brought against this nabob by Mr. Van∣sittart, Mr. Holwell, and other servants of the East India company in Bengal. Other gentlemen in the same service represented matters in a differ∣ent light, which makes it necessary here to state more particularly the facts that preceded the depo∣sition of Mhir Jaffier.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See vol. iv. p. 245.</NOTE> Shah Zaddah, in right of his mogulship, claimed all the original powers exercised by the emperors of Indostan, or India, previous to the invasion of that empire by Nadir Shah; and we have already recounted the defeat he suffered by the English East-India company's forces, under major Carnac. It seems to be certain, that the death of Mhir Jaf∣fier's son, who is said to have been killed in his tent by lightning, had made a strong impression upon the father, who was daily apprehensive of conspiracies against himself, as he had no son to succeed him. Jealousy and dread is the governing principle of those Eastern courts. A legal trial is seldom or never granted; to be suspected is to be guilty, and
<PB N="238" REF="2450"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the most involuntary connections are admitted as evi∣dences of treason. In consequence of those detest∣able maxims, Mhir Jaffier had put to death some of the late Surajah Dowla's family and friends; and it is very possible that he might have wished, not to have been so entirely dependent, as he was, upon the English, and, that they might have re∣ceived some counter-balance from a partial admissi∣on of the Dutch into his government. It is, however, certain, that no part of his conduct gave unquesti∣onable grounds for this surmise, because, after the Dutch made such an attempt, he sent troops to the assistance of the English, and, had the latter con∣sented, he would have put them all to the sword.</P>
<P>Another article urged against Mhir Jaffier was, his having obstructed the currency of the English Calcutta coin; but from this charge his friends endeavoured to clear him, by alledging, that this stoppage was owing to the bankers, whose practices he could not controul, while Shah Zaddah was mas∣ter of the southern provinces, and, by encouraging the tributary rajahs to rebel, cut off all the resources on which Mhir Jaffier depended for satisfying the demands of the English, who became every day more and more clamorous. Such was the state of affairs when Mr. Holwell resigned the president∣ship and government of Fort William to Mr. Van∣sittart, in August 1760, and at the same time re∣monstrated to his successor the necessity of depos∣ing Mhir Jaffier, for the causes above-mentioned, and many others, which rendered that nabob the ob∣ject of public horror and detestation. But the conduct of the two English chiefs, if the unpopularity of
<PB N="239" REF="2460"/>
Mhir Jaffier was so great, is pretty unaccountable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> for, instead of declaring openly against him, they laid a deep, and indeed an artful, train for his ruin. Mr. Holwell, it seems, had for some time, kept up a correspondence with Cossim Ali Cawn, Mhir Jaffier's son-in-law, who had made such pro∣positions of advantage for the company, that he was considered as a proper person to succeed Mhir Jaffier, if the latter was deposed. Cossim, at this time, had the confidence of his father-in-law, whom he persuaded to send him, under pretence of con∣certing the operations of the approaching cam∣paign, to Calcutta, where the measures were con∣certed for deposing Mhir Jaffier, or rather for de∣priving him of all power in the government. It was agreed, "That he should still maintain his dignity; that affairs should be transacted in his name, and that he should have an allowance to support him; that Cossim should conduct all the public affairs of the soubahship, and be named his successor, and live in perpetual alliance with the English factory. The English Sipoys were to be always ready to assist him, and the revenues of the three countries of Burdwan, Midnepoor, and Chittegong, were to be assigned to the English."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mhir Jaf∣fier de∣posed,</NOTE> Such were the principal articles of this clandes∣tine treaty, by which a great prince (for such Mhir Jaffier was) without his own knowledge, was to be stript of his power. We do not find any process, or proofs, that could ground the legality of this proceeding; but governor Vansit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art in person took upon him the execution▪ and under the pretence of a visit, he went up to Morshedabad, the place of

Mr. Van∣sittart, at the second visit paid him by the nabo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, produced the letters. The first charged him with the non-payment of the English troops, and the great disorders of his government, to the apparent ruin of his affairs. The second letter related to the affairs of Patna; and the third mentioned certain articles to which he was required to submit, toge∣ther with a requisition of lands, for the payment of the English troops, under the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of his being forced to comply.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in favour of Cossim AliCawn.</NOTE> It was no wonder if Mhir Jaffier was alarmed even to a state of distraction at those peremptory demands. He lamented the death of his son, which, he said, had impaired his understanding, and desired some time for consulting with his friends, which the go∣vernor was unwilling to grant, but pressed him to name some one of his relations, plainly enough pointing out Cossim, for the management of his affairs. Cossim was mentioned and sent for, but with a visible reluctance on the part of the nab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b, which determined Vansittart to employ force. Cos∣sim, being unwilling to come to the conference, oc∣casioned such a delay, that Mr. Vansittart, to save appearances, was obliged to suffer Mhir Jaffier to return that night to his palace. Cossim and the governor consulted together that night and all the next day, and the English troops under colonel
<PB N="241" REF="2480"/>
Caillaud, clandestinely passed the river, and, in con∣junction<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> with a party raised by Cossim, surrounded the palace. A letter was sent in to the nabob, de∣manding his immediate compliance, and dispositi∣ons were made for seizing his ministers. Mhir Jaffier could do nothing but complain in the most pathetic terms of the usage he met with from the English, whom he accused of perjury and breach of faith; but at last recollecting, that he had sworn to be for ever their friend, he dropt all thoughts of resentment, and offered, rather than continue un∣der the power of his son-in-law, to resign the sou∣bahship, provided he could be assured of a safe re∣treat in Calcutta, with an allowance for his mainte∣nance. This proposition, which was construed in∣to a voluntary resignation, was instantly agreed to, and Cossim proclaimed nabob, to the apparent sa∣tisfaction of the people. Mhir Jaffier was hurried into a boat, and sent to Calcutta, with some of his women, and an attendance no way suited to his dignity. A guard of English was appointed him by way of convoy to Calcutta.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disagree∣ment in the Eng∣lish coun∣cil.</NOTE> The secret committee of the English council there had approved of Cossim's being appointed sole minister to Mhir Jaffier, and he began his go∣vernment with a vigour unusual among the eastern princes, which ought to have alarmed our fac∣tory. The Shah Zaddah was defeated by the as∣sistance of the English, and the rebellious rajahs were reduced. Cossim prevailed with the English to sacrifice to him Ramnaran, the deputy nabob of the province, of whom he was jealous, but who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best friend the English had in Bengal. He
<PB N="242" REF="2490"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> then began to give strong indications of his in∣tending to be quite independent of the English. He disciplined his troops in the European manner. He was even furnished with some heavy artillery by Mr. Vansittart, and provided a train from other quarters, which gave his troops the appearance of a disciplined army. He took some French into his pay: he engaged some of the English Sipoys and their officers to serve him; and, not being fond of the neighbourhood of the factory, he retired from his capital to a strong fort three hundred miles distant from Calcutta.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty between Cossim and go∣vernor Vansit∣tart,</NOTE> Cossim soon convinced the English of their mis∣taken politics in raising him to the nabobship. He made a distinction between the trade of the com∣pany, as founded upon their rights, and the com∣merce of their servants, who, under pretence of a free trade, lent their names to Indian inland smug∣glers, so much to the prejudice of the revenue, that he complained, if the practice was continued, he should be unable to discharge his engagements with the English. It happened that this last com∣plaint agreed exactly with the instructions which Mr. Vansittart had received from the East-India direc∣tors in England, for discouraging all the fraudulent trade of their servants, as being of the utmost pre∣judice to the company's interest. Cossim support∣ing his demands with great firmness, Mr. Vansittart paid him a v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t to s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle all differences, especially that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to the inland trade carried on by the company's servants. To this trade it was owing, that so many great fortunes w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re made in the East Indies by the British subj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts, who could not other∣wise

The sweets of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s trade had been but lately discovered by the directors, who, perhaps, were not displeased, that, in some instances, Cossim checked it by force. Mr. Vansittart, on his arrival at the nabob's court, concluded a treaty with him, one of the articles of which subjected the company's servants to the judges of the nabob's courts in in∣land places. This treaty was no sooner communi∣cated to the board at Calcutta, than the resident members there sent for all the chiefs of the out-fac∣tories, who had seats at the board; and the treaty was disapproved of.

But all this had no impression upon Cossim, who dismissed the deputation from his court with a ne∣gative, and ordered some boats, with arms belong∣ing to the English, to be seized, near Patna, for the non-payment of the new duties.</P>
<P>Such was the state of affairs on the 24th of June, 176<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when Mr. Amyat and his companions, who were Messrs. Amphlett, Wollaston, and Hutchin∣son; lieutenant Jones, Gordon, and Cooper; and doctor Crooke (Messrs. Hay and Gulston remain∣ing with the nabob as hostages) took their leave of Cossim Ali, with the usual passports, and set out in boats for Calcutta. In passing by the city of Mor∣shedabad, they were attacked by a party of the na∣bob's troops on both sides of the river; and some of the English were killed in their boats. Mr. Amyat, with a few Sipoys, whom he forbad to fire,
<PB N="245" REF="2520"/>
landed, and endeavoured to make the Indians sen∣sible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> that they were furnished with the nabob's passports: the Sipoys fired, and Mr. Amyat with his party were cut in pieces.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolu∣tion at Patna, which is taken and retaken.</NOTE> While this tragedy was acting, Mr. Ellis, the English chief at Patna, with the approbation of captain Carstairs, the military commandant there, on the 25th of June, attacked and took the city of Patna, of which they were in possession for four hours, having driven out the Moorish or Indian governor and his garrison; but the latter, understanding that the English and their Sipoys were intent on plundering, returned, and soon retook the city; from whence, in their turn, they drove the English, who crossed the river, and pro∣ceeded towards Surajah Dowla's country. While they were on their march, on the 1st of July, they were attacked by a large body of the natives, with four or five hundred Sipoys, who defeated the Eng∣lish, killed about fifty of them, with eight or nine officers, among whom was captain Carstairs. Next day Mr. Ellis and all the remainder of his party, were made prisoners, and some of them sent to Pat∣na, but Mr. Ellis, with the gratest part, to Mon∣gheer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Victori∣ous pro∣gress of the Eng∣lish under major Adams.</NOTE> In the mean time Mr. Vansittart at Calcutta very candidly acknowledged the necessity of breaking the late treaty, the meaning of which had been so noto∣riously perverted by Cossim; in consequence of which a resolution was taken to declare war against him, and to restore Mhir Jaffier to the soubahship, upon his granting the company very advantageous terms, be∣sides engaging to reimburse them in all the expences
<PB N="246" REF="2530"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> of the war. Major Adams, who then command∣ed the company's troops, took the field, and in a few days was joined by Mhir Jaffier. They direct∣ed their march towards Morshedabad; and, on the 19th of July, they came up with a party of the ene∣my, whom they defeated with an inconsiderable loss, and killed Mahomed Tuckey-Cawn, who commanded the party that had slaughtered Mr. A∣myat and his companions. At the same time, they made themselves masters of the fort of Cutwa, with all the enemy's artillery there, and in the field; and on the 24th, after a trifling opposition, they entered the important city of Morshedabad, where Mhir Jaffier was proclaimed soubah. The company's troops refreshed themselves here for some days, and resuming their march, they were opposed at the head of Cossimbuzar river by a large army of Cossim's best troops and artillery. An engagement followed, in which it soon appear∣ed, by the firm stand which the natives made, that they had been improved in their discipline; but, after a long dispute, they were totally defeat∣ed. The loss of the English consisted of six offi∣cers, forty Europeans, and about three hundred Sipoys and black horse killed and wounded. The enemy's loss was very considerable; twenty-three pieces of cannon fell into the hands of the English, with one hundred and fifty boats, among which were those they had taken at Patna, laden with military, and other, stores. The major then ad∣vanced to Rajamant, near which he forced a strong entrenchment of the enemy, and thereby deprived
<PB N="247" REF="2540"/>
them of all their supplies of provisions from Ben∣gal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> which he entirely secured to the company.</P>
<P>In all these operations, major Carnac, who had been displaced from his command for his opposition to Mr. Vansittart, distinguished himself with great gallantry and good conduct; which major Adams so warmly and generously represented to the com∣pany, that they restored him to his command of their forces at Bengal. Major Adams, on the 11th of October, completed the campaign by the reduc∣tion of Mongheer, without the loss of a man. It<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cossim's troops disciplin∣ed by Eu∣ropeans.</NOTE> was remarkable, that Cossim's artillery was mount∣ed in the English manner, and served by two hun∣dred Europeans, who had been taken at Patna, (but none of them English, for they had refused to enter into his service), and were kept prisoners at Mongheer. His Sipoys were armed and cloathed in the English manner, and divided into brigades. Their skill in chusing their ground was greater than ever had been before known in the East In∣dies; and it was believed by major Adams, that the Armenians and some Europeans were princi∣pally instrumental in reducing his troops to disci∣pline.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrid massacre of the Englis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> From what has been premised, the reader must have a contemptible idea of Indian fortification, as their strongest towns and entrenchments, tho' guarded by numerous armies, were so easily re∣duced by the handful of men commanded by ma∣jor Adams. Upon the reduction of Mongheer, he sent a detachment, under captain Wedderburn, towards Patna, to which Cossim had retired, with orders to block up that place, and to inform the
<PB N="248" REF="2550"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> English prisoners there of his approach. He effectu∣ally executed the first part of his commission, but was prevented from discharging the second by the barbarity of Cossim. This tyrant employed one So∣mers, a German russian, who had entered into his service, to massacre the English prisoners. The latter so little expected such a fate, that, upom Somers's arrival with some Sipoys he commanded, they pre∣pared to receive him as a companion. The barbarian on pretence of inviting them to supper, borrowed all their knives and forks, and sending for Messrs. Ellis and Lushington, he and his assassins immedi∣ately dispatched them, but not before the latter had killed one, and wounded two, of the murderers. Messrs. Chambers, Amphlett, and Gulston, who were next sent for, underwent the same fate; but one Mr. Smith escaping with a wound back to the room, alarmed the rest of the gentlemen, who de∣fended themselves for some time bravely with their plates and bottles, and obliged the Sipoys to re∣tire; but the assassins discharging their pieces, shot them all dead. The number massacred in that house were forty-nine gentlemen, of whom twenty-five were in irons. Fifty soldiers, who were in irons likewise, were massacred at the same time, as were nine other gentlemen, and the remainder of the English prisoners, amounting in the whole to two hundred, in different parts of the country. This massacre was so barbarous, that it was re∣luctantly performed by the Sipoys, who desired Somers to give the prisoners arms, and that they would fight them; alledging, that it was unfair to kill them in so cowardly a manner: but the ruf∣fian
<PB N="249" REF="2560"/>
struck several of them down with bamboos,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> and was so cruel as to put to death a child of Mr. Ellis. One Fullerton, a physician, was the only person who escaped from Patna, having, a few days before, received a pardon from Cossim.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Farther cruelties of Cossim.</NOTE> That tyrant extended his cruelty to all the na∣tives who were thought to be in the English inter∣est. He put to death the famous banker Tagul∣pat, and his brother, with Ramnaran, whom he had kept in captivity ever since he was delivered up by the English, with about twenty-eight others, and left their bodies to be devoured by birds and beasts, the most exquisite punishment that a super∣stitious East-Indian can devise to a departed spirit. Major Adams found large magazines of ammuni∣tion and grain in Mongheer, and, after making the necessary dispositions, he proceeded against Patna, which was garrisoned by ten thousand men left by Cossim, who retired to the westward. He ordered, however, a party of horse to harrass the English in their march; but without any effect, for major Adams arrived within two miles of Patna, where he took up a strong post, and prepared to form a re∣gular siege. His manoeuvres were interrupted by a strong detachment of the enemy's Sipoys, who, with some difficulty, were beaten off, but not be∣fore they had blown up a principal magazine, the property of the English; three boats belonging to the company, laden with ammunition, were lost at the same time by a violent gust of wind. The siege, however, went on, though with great difficulty. The enemy made an obstinate defence, by which many of the English officers were wounded, but
<PB N="250" REF="2570"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> the city was at last carried, and Cossim retired pre∣cipitately to Lassarum, from whence he proceeded with all his treasure and valuable effects to the con∣fines of Surajah Dowla's country, where all he could obtain was an asylum for himself and his family.</P>
<P>So many vicissitudes of the English affairs in the East Indies, occasioned an incredible ferment in London, among all who had any concern with that company. The public was surprized that such im∣portant events had passed without being known to any but the directors; and a party was formed, with lord Clive at its head, for putting the directi∣on into other hands, at the approaching election of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proceed∣ings of the East-India company in Eng∣land.</NOTE> directors. On the 12th of March, a very numerous general court of the East-India proprietors was held, and opened by Sir Francis Gosling, who declared, "The business of their meeting to be to enquire into the present condition of the company's affairs abroad; to endeavour to discover the causes of the misfortunes that had happened at Bengal; to learn what steps had been taken by the directors to re∣medy those misfortunes; and their reasons for dis∣missing many of their old servants, and appointing a gentleman, seventh in the council at Bombay, (meaning Mr. Vansittart) to be governor at Bengal, in preference to another gentleman who should re∣gularly have succeeded to that trust."</P>
<P>The business of the day was then divided into three heads. Under the first was discussed the con∣duct of Mr Vansittart in advancing Cossim A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cawn to the nabobship, and deposing Mhir Jaffier in direct opposition, as was alledged, to his coun∣cil,
<PB N="251" REF="2580"/>
whom he ought to have consulted. As the ori∣ginal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> principles upon which this revolution was brought about had been entirely conformable to the sentiments of the directors themselves, this matter bore a strenuous debate, which threw the assem∣bly into some confusion, if not tumult. Many let∣ters and papers were read to prove the expediency and necessity of the measure, and many to shew its pernicious tendency; but their contents were so directly contradictory to one another, that the de∣bates on this head were, upon the whole, trifling and ineffectual. Under the second head was dis∣cussed the management of the company's servants at Calcutta. It was alledged, and many papers produced to confirm it, that the majority of the council had demanded exorbitant sums from the new nabob, who had refused to comply with the pay∣ment, while the governor protested against them. It was, on the other hand urged, that, without breaking the arrangements which had been made between Cossim and Mr. Vansittart, the company's affairs must have been absolutely ruined in India. To this it was replied, that they could have had no other effect than the reducing the profits of the compa∣ny's servants, who wanted to be exempted from all duties, and even to trade duty-free. Nay, it was urged, that they often covered under their names the illicit trade of the natives. The undue pre∣ference that had been given to many of the com∣pany's principal servants, formed the third and last head of this debate, which grew more warm than ever, the friends of those postponed or preferred interesting themselves with uncommon ardour.
<PB N="252" REF="2590"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> But we are here to take a short view of the state of lord Clive's affairs with regard to the company, and which indeed were thought to have given rise to the original division among the directors and proprietors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">See vol. ii. p. 46 to p. 52. State of the case between the com∣pany and lord Clive.</NOTE> We have already more than once mentioned the vast services performed by lord Clive, when in the company's service in India, for which he had been recompenced very deservedly by Mhir Jasfier, with a jaghire, or settlement, upon the revenues of that country, issuing from the reserved rent of the lands which had been ceded to the company by that prince; and this jaghire, which amounted to near 30,000 l. a year, was consequently to be paid by the factory. As his lordship had so great a con∣cern in the welfare of the company, he thought it was reasonable that he should have some part of its management. He differed with the directors in wording the article relating to the East Indies in the preliminaries for peace, and it was accordingly al∣tered; many occurrences happened which indicat∣ed that those who were in the secret of the direction were averse to his lordship's having a seat at their board, and the opposition to him was thought to arise principally from Mr. Sullivan, the deputy-chairman, who was said to understand the affairs of the direction better than any man in England. His lordship's interest being very strong, his friends pressed his admission into the directorship; and matters went so high, that orders were sent to the company's servants to stop the payment of the jaghire, for the recovery of which his lordship brought a suit in the chancery of England.</P>

<P><PB N="253" REF="2610"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Debates on that head.</NOTE> Various were the reasons alledged by the directors for this detention, which the public in general resented as injurious. They objected to the dispo∣sition which his lordship had made of the treasures of the nabob whom he had deposed; and that he had with-held from the relations of the sufferers in the black-hole at Calcutta the sums stipulated for their indemnification. He was likewise accused of remitting money home by a Dutch ship, contrary to the regulations of the company, and of having sup∣plied a Portuguese ship with goods and money; but the chief allegation which lay against him was, that he had no right to the jaghire, which was paid at the company's expence. In answer to these alle∣gations, his lordship addressed a letter to the pro∣prietors, which confuted them beyond all possibi∣lity of reply. He proved that the relations of the sufferers at Calcutta, as appeared by their own let∣ters of thanks to him, had been more than indem∣nified by the scrupulous exactness with which the stipulations in their favour had been fulfilled; that the nabob's treasures had been punctually applied, according to agreement with Mhir Jaffier, to whom they belonged, and that he sent no money by Dutch ships but in bills, which, not being due till three years after date, were in danger of never being paid, as he was then opposing the designs of the Dutch in Bengal; and that, at the time he sent those bills, the company's servants thought it in∣consistent with their interest to grant bills. The charge with regard to the Portuguese ship, was proved to be a groundless falsity; and his lord∣ship shewed that he had at least as good a right
<PB N="254" REF="2620"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> to his jaghire as the company had to the vast estates which they possessed in the East Indies.</P>
<P>The more disinterested part of the proprietors were of opinion that nothing but the credit, expe∣rience, and abilities, of lord Clive in person could retrieve the disorder into which their affairs were thrown in the East Indies. Other meetings were accordingly held to bring about this desirable end; and a motion was made, that lord Clive should be requested to take upon him the presidentship of Bengal, and the command of the military forces there. His lordship, in his answer, shewed himself ready to comply with the motion, provided mat∣ters could be settled, so that he could proceed with vigour, supported by a friendly and united direction. Upon this, a letter was sent in form to his lordship; but in the mean time such altercations passed be∣tween him and the deputy chairman, that it was very plain his lordship was resolved to decline the presidentship and all military command, if that gentleman continued to take the lead in the com∣pany's affairs at London. The directors in the oppo∣sition to his lordship, upon this published the fa∣vourable accounts of their affairs in the East In∣dies which they had received from major Adams, and which they hoped would convince the public, that there was no necessity for courting lord Clive to accept of the presidentship, which he continued to decline unless Mr. Sullivan was displaced from his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> The publication of the accounts from maj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Adams and governor Van<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tart damped the zeal of many who had be n most forward in pressing lord Clive to name his own terms; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="255" REF="2630"/>
as it was called, prevailed against that of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> proprietors, which had been formed by his lord∣ship's friends.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Sul∣livan turned out of the chair.</NOTE> Mr. Sullivan, however, was so near being thrown out of the direction, which he carried only by one vote upon the scrutiny of the ballot, that it was plain, business could not be done, if he continued to lead the board of directors; and a ballot being taken for a chairman, Mr. Rous, lord Clive's friend, was elected, and Mr. Bolton deputy-chairman. This event gave so general a satisfaction, that the company's stock immediately rose upon it, and fresh applications were made to lord Clive. His lordship, in a letter addressed to the directors, took notice, that a law-suit was depending between him and the company, concerning his jaghire, which rendered it highly improper for him to go abroad before it was determined; "and therefore, said his lordship, allow me to suggest to you the expediency of referring the matter to a general court of the proprietors, with the proposal I now make, viz. That I shall enjoy my jaghire for ten years, provided the company shall remain so long in possession of those lands, of which the jaghire is the quit-rent, and provided I shall live so long. At the end of ten years, or at my death, if it should happen first, my right and title to the jaghire shall cease; and, on my arrival in India, I shall use my utmost endeavours with the nabob, to secure the re∣version of it to the company. Should my death hap∣pen early in this service, I submit to the consideration of the directors and proprietors (but do not insist
<PB N="256" REF="2640"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> upon it) whether it cannot be continued to my heirs for five years."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate and divi∣sion upon lord Clive's propo∣sals.</NOTE> In consequence of this letter a general court of the East-India company was held, to deliberate on its contents, which were highly applauded by the public for their moderation; and a resolution passed for taking the sense of the proprietors by a ballot for empowering the court of directors "to agree with lord Clive for the payment of his jaghire during ten years, if his lordship should so long live, and the company shall be in actual possession of the lands, out of which it issues, and the revenues thereof during that period of time." This question created great debates. The court of directors thought themselves obliged to justify their pro∣ceedings upon the jaghire, by producing the opini∣ons which they had taken from the learned of the law. Lord Clive's friends did the same on their side; and they were found, on the whole, to be confused, contradictory, and irreconcilable to each other. The majority of the meeting, however, seemed in∣clinable to close with his lordship's proposal, and a day was fixed for the ballot. Before the company broke up, a motion was made, on the part of his lordship's friends, with a view of facilitating the success of the ballot, "That, for the future, none of the company's servants in the East Indies should, upon pain of expulsion, receive from any of the nabobs, or from any others, any kind of gratuity or reward, without the concurrence or consent of the council, or of the court of directors of the East-In∣dia company." This resolution met with applause, and passed.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Which are ac∣cepted of.</NOTE> On the day after the ballot was taken, it appear∣ed that the question was carried for allowing lord Clive his jaghire by a majority of 583 against 396. Other motions of less importance were then made, particularly upon a resolution that had been taken by the court of directors to recommend major Adams to the secretary at war, for his majesty to confer on him some higher post, that he may be continued at Bengal so long as the exigencies of af∣fairs should require. A motion being made upon this resolution, it was strongly opposed, as tending to impose a check upon lord Clive, who was then making preparations for his departure. The mo∣tion, however, was carried, as were other motions, for returning the thanks of the court to major Car∣nac, and the other officers and troops who had so gallantly s rved under major Adams. After this, many debates ensued, which discovered that great heart▪burnings still remained among the proprie∣tors; but they were of too private a nature to merit a place here. Lord Clive had formed a military establishment for the East Indies, by reducing the company's troops into regiments, and keeping up two battalions in England, with various other regu∣lations; but as the discussing of those particulars must have taken up too much time, the debate was ended by a motion being carried, "That the com∣pany's a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>airs in Bengal requiring immediate atten∣tion, and the season being very far advanced, lord Clive be desired to embark forthwith for that go∣vernment; and that all the officers now appointed be ordered to proceed th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther without delay."</P>

We are now to return to the course of our history, which we have found necessary to discontinue, that we might preserve the narrative of the East-India affairs entire; and for that purpose we shall, as usual, take a general view of the state of Europe, about the middle of the year 1763.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of affairs on the conti∣nent of Europe.</NOTE> The several powers upon the continent wisely applied themselves to resettle the civil policy of their dominions, which had suffered so dreadfully during the late war. The empress of Russia, hav∣ing by force reinstated count Biron in the duchy of Courland, followed the plan which had been struck
<PB N="259" REF="2670"/>
out by her unhappy husband, in forming closer<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> connections than ever with the king of Prussia, but discovered an eager desire that the court of London should enter into their measures. His Prussian ma∣jesty applied himself with incredible ardour to the promotion of agriculture and the civil arts in his kingdom. He softened the rigour of the military jurisdiction, which his officers used to exercise over the peasants; and he left the censure of the gene∣rals Zastrow and Fink, with other officers who were thought to have misbehaved in the late war, to courts-martial, by whom some were broke, others degraded, and some imprisoned, but none of them condemned to death. The imperial court concerted measures with his Prussian majesty for the archduke Joseph to be elected king of the Romans; a step which was thought to be the most probable means of preventing the future troubles of the em∣pire, should its throne become vacant.</P>
<P>As to the court of France, its ministers were embarrassed by the heavy debts contracted in the late war; and tho' they applied themselves to the reparation of their marine, it made but a slow pro∣gress, thro' the lowness of their finances, while their assiduity and success were greatly exagge∣rated by the malcontents in England. The court of Madrid received intelligence of their troops hav∣ing made themselves masters of the colony of St. Sacrament, belonging to the Portuguese, with a vast booty. At the same time their attention was employed in procuring the evacuation of the Ha∣vannah by the British troops, which was happily effected. The death of the king of Poland, which

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Death of the king of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> happened on the 5th of October, threatened new convulsions to that part of Europe. The courts of Versailles and Vienna shewed dispositions for op∣posing the elevation of a Plast, or native, to that throne, to which the people inclined; and the elector of Saxony declared himself a candidate, in a circular latter which he wrote to all the nobles of Poland. On the other hand, the empress of Russia had pri∣vate as well as political reasons for seeing a Pia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon the throne, and loudly declared, that she would support the freedom of the Polish election with a sufficient force. In this declaration she was joined by his Prussian majesty, who at the same time had interest enough at the Ottoman court to bring that ministry into the same sentiments; and thus the three powers in Europe who had the greatest in∣fluence in the election, concurred with the general voice of the Polish nation. The court of England, with the other powers of Europe, observed a per∣fect neutrality in all the transaction; and the death of the elector of Saxony, which happened soon af∣ter that of his father, left the contest to be decided<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him.</NOTE> among the Piasts. Prince Czartorinski, at first, stood for the election, as did several other Po∣lish noblemen. It was for some time imagined, that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Prussian majesty interested himself in the affair, because his brother prince Henry would likewise declare himself a candidate. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> however, was soon undeceived as to the real views of the empress of Russia, who highly savoured court <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Polish nobleman, who had for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> resided at the court of Petersburgh, and for whom her imperial majesty was said to have

Indeed, the magnifi∣cent<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> presents she made him upon his declaring him∣self a candidate, left little room for the rest of Europe to doubt of his success, especially as the court of Vi∣enna seemed to employ all its attention for facilitat∣ing the election of a king of the Romans. In this situation stood the affairs of Europe towards the beginning of the year 1764, so far, at least, as they related to Great Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs between England and France.</NOTE> The court of London, in the mean time, ap∣peared to be intirely indifferent with regard to the opposition formed against the government, and proceeded with the utmost firmness in establishing the plan of policy it had adopted. A magnificent entry was made by the Venetian embassadors into London on the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of April, and the parade con∣tinued for two or three days after, when they were introduced to his majesty at St. James's. The duke de Nivernois took leave of the court next month, highly pleased with the success of his em∣bassy, and amazed at the magnificence and riches of the English court and nation. A public thanks∣giving on occasion of the peace was observed, and numbers of illustrious foreigners resorted to the English court, which then seemed entirely intent upon festivities. But under those appearances his majesty and the ministry were pursuing the most steady means for insuring the advantages of peace. Though there appeared the greatest unanimity be∣tween them and the court of France, yet very seri∣ous remonstrances were made to the latter, con∣cerning several matters of importance which had been left unsettled at the conclusion of the general

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> peace. An arrear of about 1,200,000 l. was due to England for the maintenance of the French pri∣soners during the time of the war; and the French, on the other hand, brought a large charge against the British ministry for their ships which had been taken before the declaration of hostilities, alledging that the captures were illegal, and that the produce of them was a sufficient fund for the support of their prisoners; but the members of the English council were of a different opinion. They con∣sidered the French as the aggressors in the war, which had been in fact declared by the hostilities they had commenced in America. In conse∣quence of this principle, commissioners had been named, who sold the prizes; and their produce, amounting to about 700,000 l. was generously giv∣en by his majesty towards lessening the public bur∣thens.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficul∣ties about the Cana∣da bills.</NOTE> The affair of the Canada bills was another unde∣termined point between the two courts. The French king, by a particular act, stood engaged for their discharge. Those bills were paper-money, and were of two sorts; either bills of exchange on the royal treasury of Old France, or ordonnances, which were a kind of notes of hand payable by that king. In this manner the French government paid their subjects of Canada the balance due to them up∣on their trade, which, though detrimental to the royal finances, was very profitable to individuals; and the people of Canada preferred the ordonnances even to ready money. For this reason, when Canada fell into the hands of the English, the old <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> possessed of that paper currency to
<PB N="263" REF="2710"/>
a very considerable amount, some of the ordon∣nances<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> being dated so far back as the year 1729. In 1759, Bigot, the French intendant, who signed those ordonnances and bills of exchange, issued vast quantities of them, on pretence that they were ne∣cessary for the purposes of the war; and the Cana∣dians took them as usual, paying for them in ne∣cessaries to their full amount. Upon the English taking possession of the province, it was found that the trade of Canada could not subsist unless those bills were paid; nor could the new subjects of England, who held them, pay for the goods they imported from Great Britain. Under this difficulty many English merchants were, in a manner, obliged to accept of them in payment, trusting to the declaration signed by the duke de Choiseul, when the definitive treaty was concluded, for their being discharged. Upon the return of Bigot to France, that court accused him of having wantonly and fraudulently issued out great num∣bers of those bills, for which he and his accom∣plices were severely fined and punished. The French court, therefore, besides the plea of inabi∣lity, which they brought to excuse them from the immediate payment, pretended to liquidate them according to the value originally received for them, alledging, that no time for their payment was specified in the duke de Choiseul's declaration. The total sum of this paper currency was said to amount to about two millions and a half sterling; and the English merchants insisted upon the notes they were in possession of being either discharged,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Demoli∣tion of Dunkirk.</NOTE> The demolition of Dunkirk was another object in which the British ministry at this time warmly interested themselves. The shameful evasions of the French in performing this article after the treaty of Utrecht, and the more shameful conni∣vances of the whig ministers in England at that non-execution, were fresh in the minds of the pub∣lic. All the reproaches thrown out in former times on that account were now renewed; but the remonstrances of the British ministry were so effec∣tual, that in November the nation had authen∣tic information that the cunet<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Dunkirk was entirely filled up, excepting a trifling part, for which there was no earth; and that near three hundred men were employed in demolishing the king's bason there. Thus, in a few months, the ministry under George the Third obliged the French court to do what they had either evaded or refused to perform for above fifty years before.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the Indian <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and war.</NOTE> The state of the British affairs in America be∣came now the most important of all considerations to the government, which acted in such a manner, as plainly indicated that his majesty intended to make that country as much the object of his atten∣tion, as Germany had been that of his predecessors. The French Jesuits and their partizans still kept up their interest with the natives, and instigated them, especially the Cherokee Indians, to hostilities against the English. Those savages, however rude and uninformed, were found to be highly suscep∣tible
<PB N="265" REF="2730"/>
of resentment, and complained of suffering<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> many grievances in their trade with the English. Though those complaints were probably founded on the suggestions of the French, yet the general assembly of the province of Pensylvania passed an act for preventing abuses in the Indian trade, and for strengthening peace and friendship with the northern Indians. Notwithstanding this, and ma∣ny other wise precautions, taken both in America and Great Britain to quiet the savages, every dis∣patch brought fresh accounts of the inhuman mas∣sacres and devastations committed by them in the back-settlements of the English. In the spring of the year 1763, the Six Nations, as they are called, had a meeting with the Delawares, and others of the savage tribes, who sent deputies to Hertford, in New-York, representing that the lands on the Susquehanna belonged to them; complaining that the English had begun to build sorts there, to extend their possessions, as far as the western seas; and de∣claring that, whatever pretended deeds might be produced, especially by one Lydias, of their having disposed of those lands, they were resolved to de∣fend them to the last extremity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Massacres commit∣ted by the savages;</NOTE> It was known at the council board of England, that some of those complaints were but too well founded, and instructions were sent to all the Bri∣tish governors in America, to prevent any settle∣ments being made on the lands of the Indians, un∣der pretence of deeds of sale and conveyance trau∣dulently obtained from the savages. The gover∣nors, accordingly, had issued proclamations against all such settlements being made, and order∣ing
<PB N="266" REF="2740"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> that, if already made, they should be evacu∣ated. The savages at Hertford had been instruct∣ed by their constituents, that as soon as their com∣plaint was lodged they should return, without wait∣ing for an answer; but they were persuaded to re∣main till the governor explained himself in a man∣ner that would have been to their satisfaction, if they had not previously concerted a most diabolical scheme of a massacre. They had resolved to have as∣sembled in a body, and to have made a general at∣tack upon the British back-settlers, while they were getting in their harvest; and after having murder∣ed all they could meet with, to have destroyed their provisions, that no subsistence might remain for those who escaped. The eager forwardness of some young Indians prevented the total execution of this infernal design, which they executed in part with amazing barbarity, and with a cun∣ning and conduct of which they were thought to have been incapable The back-settlements were instantly filled with savages from the neighbour∣hood of Pittsburgh, Sandusky, and Detroit, where they put all the defenceless English to the sword. Of an hundred and twenty traders, trafficking in the back-settlements, only two or three escaped be∣ing murdered; Sir Robert Davers, an English gentleman, who out of curiosity was viewing the lakes of North America, together with one colonel Clapham, an officer belonging to the garrison of For Pitt, underwent the same fate. The savages, afterwards, regularly attacked all the small posts betw en Pittsburgh and Lake Erie, giving out to the garrison of every post, that they had destroyed
<PB N="267" REF="2750"/>
that which was adjoining, and exceedingly exag∣gerating<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> their own numbers Of one hundred of the settlers, and others, who were escorting a large quantity of provisions and goods to Detroit, sixty-seven were massacred. The savages spared all the French that were of the convoy; but finding that the goods belonged to the English, they seiz∣ed the whole: nor did the French make any resist∣ance from the beginning. Having inveigled, with fair pretences, one Mr. Colhoun to trust them, they plundered him, and killed ten of his people, he himself narrowly escaping. In short, the desola∣tion those barbarians spread was frightful; whole families were murdered, their corn and stock of provisions destroyed, the settlements for twenty miles were deserted, and five hundred poor fami∣lies, with women and children, who had the good fortune to escape, fled to the woods of Virginia, where they could find neither shelter nor subsist∣ence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who be∣siege Detroit,</NOTE> When the English were somewhat recovered from their consternation at this dreadful scene, they repulsed the savages from Bedford, Ligonier, Nia∣gara, Detroit, and Fort Pitt. The two last-mention∣ed garrisons were prepared to receive them. A large body of them appeared before Fort Detroit, on pretence of holding a congress with major Glad∣win, the commandant, who being on his guard, refused to admit them, and put his garrison under arms. Next day the savages were joined by five hundred more of their own number, all armed, who demanded admittance into the fort. The comman∣dant offered to admit forty; and they required to
<PB N="268" REF="2760"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> confer with two officers, whom they detained, and afterwards scalped. They then practised a great many arts to become masters of the place, and to have carried it by surprize. For this purpose, they cut off all the garrisons of the out-posts, with those of Presque Isle and St. Joseph; and suddenly possessed themselves of the post of Michilimakinac, where they massacred all the garrison but two officers. The garrison of Fort Detroit, which is no other than a square stockade with four bastions, when the savages appeared first before it, consisted of no more than eighty persons who carried arms, and thirty-four on board two vessels which enfiladed three sides of the square, and struck vast terror into the Indians, who, however, still continued the blockade. On the 30th of July, captain Dalyel, aid de camp to general Amherst, arrived at the fort, and laid a plan for surprising the savages, who were preparing to depart. The captain marched out with two hundred and forty-five men, attended by<NOTE PLACE="marg">and de∣feat the English.</NOTE> two boats, with a patterero in each. At the dis∣tance of two miles and a half from the fort they came up with the Indians, who were covered by breast-works▪ and at first received the English, who attacked them in the dark, with a brisk regular fire, which did considerable execution. The de∣tachment, however, with difficulty got possession of some of the works; but captain Dalyel seeing it impracticable to hold them, made dispositions for a retreat, when he was killed by the savages. The command devolved upon captain Grant who was so hard pressed on every side by a continua f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> e from the inclosures, that he was obliged to

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They blockade Fort Pitt.</NOTE> The resolute and regular behaviour of the sa∣vages during this action, convinced the English that they were improved in their discipline; and they were confirmed in this opinion, by an action which happened two days after, between them and colonel Bouquet, who commanded a party sent to the relief of Fort Pitt, formerly Fort du Quesne, by Sir Jeffery Amherst, the British commander in chief in America. The works of this important fort had never been completed, and had suf∣fered lately by an inundation. The savages found it in this condition, and provided with a weak gar∣rison, when they surrounded it, with a design to take it by famine. Being destitute of all means of making regular approaches, they took post in the banks of the adjacent rivers, and blockaded it so effectually, that they cut it off from all communications without, murdering all the messengers who were ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g intelligence either to of from the fort In this de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perate situation, captain E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uyer, the English commandant, and his garri∣son, resolved to die, rather than surrender to so inhuman an enemy; and dispos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions were made accordingly.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> one of the principal objects of savage fury, and or∣dered colonel Bouquet to march to its relief, with a large quantity of provisions and stores, under a strong escort. The colonel, in his march, could receive no intelligence of the enemy, who had posted themselves in all passes, and either killed all his messengers, or obliged them to return. By this it appeared that the Indians had excellent intelli∣gence. When the colonel, on the 5th of Au∣gust, came to Ligonier, he found it proper to leave the waggons, the powder, and the chief part of the stores and provisions there; while he proceeded with the troops, and about three hundred and forty horses, loaded with flour. The Indians, by this time, had abandoned the blockade of Fort Pitt, to attack the English on their march, which lay through a dangerous defile, called Turtle Creek, extending several miles in length, with high rug∣ged<NOTE PLACE="marg">They at∣tack the English convoy,</NOTE> grounds on each side. While the colonel was preparing to pass this defile in the night-time, and while his men were refreshing themselves, after a fatiguing march of seventeen miles, his advanced guard was suddenly attacked by the savages; but, being speedily supported, they were repulsed, dri∣ven from some of their posts, and pursued a consi∣derable way. Soon after the pursuit ceased, the savages returned to the attack, and appeared upon all the eminences round, from whence they kept up an incessant fire upon the English, who gave them a general charge with their whole line. Though this dislodged the savages at first, they
<PB N="271" REF="2790"/>
soon recovered other heights, and thickened round<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> in such a manner, by means of fresh reinforcements, that the convoy which was left in the rear of the English was in danger of being taken. The latter returned to protect it, and the engagement became general.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">but are repulsed with diffi∣culty.</NOTE> The savages supported their attempt with unpa∣ralleled regularity and order, from one o'clock at noon till night; and then, with great difficulty, were repulsed and driven from their posts, with fixed bayonets, though with considerable loss to the English, of whom above sixty were killed or wounded. But this repulse was far from being de∣cisive. The English could do no more than to take post on the hill in such a manner as to surround their convoy with their wounded, and cover them from the enemy, who formed an outer circle at the distance of about five hundred yards, where they emitted the most terrible shouts and yells to intimi∣date the English. In the morning they attacked the camp under an incessant fire. It was in vain for the English to repel them, because when pressed they retired, but immediately returned to the charge with redoubled ardour; so that the situa∣tion of the troops attacked was truly deplorable; galled by the fire of the savages, fatigued by the preceding engagement, and faint and dispirited through a total want of water. Had they attempt∣ed to break through the enemy to have gained a more secure and comfortable situation, they must have left their convoy to be plundered, and their
<PB N="272" REF="2800"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> wounded to be butchered; not to mention that they had lost many of their horses, and that the drivers of those who remained were so stupified by their fears, that they slunk into bushes, and were incapable of doing their duty. In the mean time, the fury of the savages encreased, and their attempts to break into the camp were more violent than ever; but still, when pressed, they kept aloof, that they might rally, and return with the greater effect. The English followed the only method that could be practised for disengaging themselves, which was by making dispositions for an apparent retreat, and thereby encouraging the savages to come to a closer engagement. Colonel Bouquet ordered two com∣panies of his troops, who had been the most ad∣vanced in the engagement, to fall in with the cir∣cle, and the troops on the right and left to open their files, as if to cover the retreat of the others; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e another company of light infantry, and one of grenadiers, were directed to support the two first companies. The savages who possessed the ground lately occupied by the two light infantry companies, drawing nearer at the same time to the center of the circle, thought themselves so secure of victory, that they pressed on, but still pouring i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a heavy fire, till major Campbell, with the first companies, from a part of the hill which they could not observe, attacked their right flack; and being seconded by captain Basset, from another quarter, the barbarians were every

The English now proceeded about two miles farther, to a place call∣ed Bushy Run; but, notwithstanding the late de∣feat, the savages again attacked the English in their new camp, tho' l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss vigorously then be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore; and being repulsed, the troops continued their march till they arrived at Fort Pitt, in four days after their engagement. The loss which the English sustain∣ed upon the whole was above an hundred killed and wounded, that of the savages was not much greater, owing to their manner of fighting; tho' those barbarians, whose tribes are very thin, looked upon it as being very considerable. But though the two forts of Detroit and Pitt were thus secured, yet the war still continued in other parts, and it is incredible with what foresight and resolution they took their measures in way-laying the convoys, or in surprising the parties of the English. When colonel Bouquet arrived at Fort Pitt, he found captain Ecuyer, who had been wounded in the leg, reduced almost to extremity, having raised a parapet of logs around the fort, by the help only of a few ship-wrights, and taken every other imaginable precau∣tion, for the safety of the place. Upon the whole, though the improvement of the savages in the art of war was a melancholy consideration to the Eng∣lish, yet it was some comfort to the latter, to learn

The new go∣vernors were impowered and directed, with the ad∣vice and consent of the members of the council, to call assemblies, in the same manner as other Ame∣rican governors do for the regulation of their pro∣vinces. Power was granted to the three new go∣vernors upon the continent to give the inhabitants living under them the necessary securities for the protection of their possessions▪ on the payment of such moderate quit-rents, services, and acknowledg∣ments as were common to other colonies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Procla∣mation for the encou∣ragement of reduced officers and sol∣diers.</NOTE> A provision was made in the same proclamation for the encouragement of such reduced officers as served in America, during the late war, and to the private soldiers disbanded there. Every field offi∣cer was to have five thousand acres, every captain three thousand, every subaltern, or staff-officer, two thousand, every non-commissioned officer two hundred, and every private man fifty acres. This encouragement was to extend to such of the reduc∣ed officers in the navy of like rank as served on board British ships of war in North America, at the time Louisburgh and Quebec were reduced. The strictest provisions were then made for the security of the native Indians in the possession of their hunt∣ing and other grounds allotted for their support; and all British subjects who had encroached upon them, were ordered to remove. From this wise provision it was evident that his majesty distinguish∣ed between the rights of sovereignty and those of property, by excluding his governors from any manner of jurisdiction over those lands which were
<PB N="277" REF="2860"/>
not specified within the limits of their provinces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> Even private subjects of England were prohibited from purchasing any lands from the Indians; but if the latter were inclined to dispose of any such lands, it must be done in an assembly of the Indi∣ans, held by a British governor. Lastly, every In∣dian trader was to take out a licence from the re∣spective governors for carrying on commerce with the Indians.</P>
<P>Though the wisdom, and, indeed, the necessity, of those regulations, were evident, at the first sight, yet they did not fail to raise an outery against the government, as if the most valuable part of the English acquisitions on the continent had been left in the hands of the savages, by which the French would always have it in their power to renew their treacherous intrigues and practices; and the Indian war which broke out soon after the conclusion of the peace, seemed to give too much colour for such allegations. But when the measure is rightly considered, it is rather a regulation, than a relin∣quishment, of territory; for, in fact, all the lands reserved for the Indians, and, indeed, all the con∣quests made by the English during the course of the late war, were comprehended in former grants and charters, which had no other boundaries to the westward but the South Sea. From this there arose a necessity for adjusting the limits of the seve∣ral governments with greater precision, but still with∣out any prejudice to the British rights of sovereign∣ty over those lands, and which may require still far∣ther regulations, as the natives become more civi∣lized,

James Grant, Esq. obtained the government of East, as George Johnston, Esq. did that of West Florida, and Ro∣bert Melvill, Esq. had that of Grenada conferred on him. Those appointments were, by all men of candour and judgment, thought to be justly due to the merits and services of the gentlemen to whom they were allotted; each of whom had particularly distinguished himself in the reduction of the pro∣vince over which he was appointed governor; but the tools of opposition loaded the government with the most illiberal abuse, without assigning any other reason than that the gentlemen thus distinguished were all of them natives of Scotland, though in other respects they were allowed by calumny itself to be unexceptionable, both in their civil and military capacities.

<P>During this parley, the governor had been joined by all the officers in the garrison; and lieutenant Mills, the town major, had taken care to shut the gates of the town. The night being very dark, this exposed the inhabitants to be plundered, if the men should disperse within the walls. At last the governor, seconded by his officers, prevailed with them to march back to the grand parade, where he addressed them file by file; but they still seemed to persist in their resolution not to serve without provisions, and all he could do was to persuade them to march to their barracks, till he could have an opportunity to represent their grievances to the commander in chief. When they complied with this request, they repeated their protestations of loyalty and personal esteem for their officers; but seemed as determined as ever to execute their pur∣pose. Next day they mounted guard as usual, in good order, while general Murray took that oppor∣tunity of assembling together the commissioned and non-commissioned officers. To them he re∣presented the danger of a mutiny in the strongest British garrison in America, an example which, un∣doubtedly, would be followed by all the troops on that continent; and that, for his own part, he was resolved either to reduce the men to their duty, or to perish in the attempt. After consultation, it was agreed, that the mildest measures should be

used, and accordingly all that and part of the suc∣ceeding<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> day was spent by the officers in endeavour∣ing to reduce the men to their duty, tho' without any visible effect.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Which is quelled by governor Murray.</NOTE> The general now thought it was high time to bring this dangerous affair to a crisis by a decisive effort. In the evening of the 20th, the governor, after harranguing each battalion separately, in an affecting but manly manner, ordered all the garri∣son to be under arms next day on the grand pa∣rade. They obeyed, and the good effects of his remonstrances soon appeared. He himself read to them the articles of war, repeated his representa∣tions on their enormous conduct, and declared, that he was resolved, by the assistance of his officers, ei∣ther to reduce them to their duty, or to die by their hands. He then posted himself at the head of Am∣herst's grenadiers, with an air that bespoke him de∣termined to put the first man to death who should refuse to obey him; and ordered them, in token of their compliance, to march between two royal co∣lours planted for that purpose. The grenadiers obeyed, the rest of the garrison followed their ex∣ample, while all of them expressed sorrow for their past behaviour; upon which the governor restored them to their colours, and expressed his satisfac∣tion in their having recovered their characters as good soldiers. This affair being transmitted to England, it was found, upon enquiry, that matters had been misrepresented to the government, who were induced to believe, that the allowances might have been deducted without injuring the garrison of Quebec.

Before this matter could be properly explained, the mob broke into Mr. Cottingham's and other shops, where they destroyed the work to a considerable value, and committed many other disorders; nor could they be quieted till Cottingham promised he would import no more silks, and even gave bond for that purpose to the rioters, who behaved on this occasion with most astonishing intrepidity against the regular troop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763. Proceed∣ings in the Irish par∣liament about pensions.</NOTE> On the 20th of October the earl of Northumber∣land, lord lieutenant of Ireland, arrived at Dublin, where great pains had been taken to exasperate the public of all degrees against the large sums of mo∣ney that had been granted in pensions on that establishment. A list of those pensions was obtain∣ed, specifying the particular persons to whom they had been granted; and it appeared that, exclusive of the military establishment, and the pensions granted to French people, they amounted annually to the sum of 72002 l. those of the military estab∣lishment to 2400 l. and the sum granted to French pensioners, who had been upon the establishment ever since the death of George the First, to 920 l. 17 s. It was alledged that these pensions had been doubled since the year 1756, and that a considera∣ble part of the sum total had been imposed since the accession of his present majesty. Great pains were taken to prove that the unalienable revenues of the crown, and the temporary as well as the he∣reditary duties of Ireland, were legally applicable to public purposes only. That the three branches of the Irish revenue, the prisage on wines, light▪house duties, and the casual revenue, the only funds from which pensions can be legally issued, do no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amount to 15,000 l. (probably not to 7000 l.▪ a year; and, upon the whole, it was reasonable that all those illegal pensions should be recalled.</P>
<P>As neither the ministry in England or Ireland thought proper to publish any authentic refutation of these charges, they passed as acknowledged, when the parliament met at Dublin on the 11th of Oct¦ber, and was opened by an excellent speech from
<PB N="285" REF="2940"/>
the lord▪lieutenant, taking notice of the late riot∣ous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> proceedings, recommending the support of the Protestant charter-schools, and of the linnen manu∣facture. After they had gone through the usual<NOTE PLACE="marg">Motions rejected.</NOTE> forms of addresses and other business, they moved for an address to his majesty, to give orders to his attorney-general to bring a writ of scire facias, to enquire into the legality of the patent by which the office of chancellor of the exchequer of that kingdom was then held. Though this motion was in effect lost by the consideration of its being put off to a long day, yet the house proceeded to other business, which shewed them to be by no means in∣sensible of what they conceived to be their griev∣ances, particularly with regard to the pensions we have mentioned. One of 1000 l. a year had been granted to George Charles, Esq. on the 15th of the preceding July, for the term of thirty-one years, in trust, (it was alledged), for the Sardinian minister, as a reward for his negotiating the late treaty of peace with France and Spain; therefore a motion was made for an address to his majesty to recall it, which passed in the negative. Other general motions against the grants of pensions were likewise made, but miscarried.</P>
<P>This did not discourage Mr. Perry, a leading member of the commons, from moving for an ad∣dress to his majesty, expressing, that their pleasing hopes of the national debt being reduced, and the people eased of their heavy taxes, were "blast∣ed by the unexpected requisition of supplies to sup∣port a civil establishment, loaded with a long train of pensions, the amount of which, exclusive of the
<PB N="286" REF="2950"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> French and military, exceeded the expence of all the other branches of the civil establishment, in the sum of 42,627 l. 19s. 2d. many of which were pub∣licly bought and sold in the market. That the number of officers upon the military establishment was increased, not only far beyond what it ever was in time of peace, but even beyond what it was in the time of the most dangerous war; and would, under any reign but that of his majesty, raise just appre∣hensions for the constitution not only of this king∣dom, but of Great Britain. That, instead of six regiments of dragoons, and twenty-six of foot, the most ever seen in this kingdom, there are now <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight regiments of dragoons and thirty of foot, be∣sides the four old regiments of horse. That the expence of general officers is raised from 32,000 l. in two years, to 45,000 l. though there was not a sufficient number of them in this kingdom to at∣tend the last reduction of the forces. That the ex∣pence of the ordnance is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>welled from 10,600 l. in two years, to 45,700 l. independent of its extraor∣dinary charges, which are very considerable; tho' the whole artillery of this kingdom is not equal to the ordnance of one of his majesty's ships of war of thirty guns. That every other branch of the military and civil establishments are advanced near∣ly in the same proportion."</P>
<P>The rest of this addre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is filled with the like plaintive matter. The patrons of it pretended, that, in two years, the military establishment a∣mounted to the sum of n ne hundred and eighty thousand three hundred and fifty-five pounds <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shillings. "The civil establishment to two
<PB N="287" REF="2960"/>
hundred and forty-two thousand nine hundred<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> and fifty-six pounds ten shillings and nine pence; to which must be added, at the most moderate computation, three hundred thousand pounds, for the extraordinary and contingent expences of go∣vernment. So that, (continued the proposed ad∣dress) the expence of the nation for these two years must exceed its whole revenue in a sum of three hundred and fourteen thousand two hundred and forty-eight pounds nine shillings and nine pence; which deficiency being added to the national debt, must leave this kingdom, at the next meeting of parliament, near one million in debt." The ad∣dress concluded with a request, that the circum∣stances of the Irish might be laid before his majesty, whose wisdom, justice, and humanity, would not permit the utter ruin of a dutiful, loyal, and affecti∣onate people. It was plainly seen that this inflamma∣tory, but plausible, address had a most dangerous tendency; and therefore the motion for it passed in the negative, greatly to the satisfaction of all who wished well to the two kingdoms. The debates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Debates upon the above ad∣dress.</NOTE> on this occasion were keen, and, in some cases, per∣sonal; but the advocates for the government car∣ried their point by unanswerably proving, that, as Ireland had, in no perceptible degree, been burdened with the expences of the late war, that had cost so many millions to Great Britain, a great part of which had been laid out for the protection of the Irish ter∣ritory and commerce; and as, from the encourage∣ment she received from England, she was then in a flourishing and respectable condition; it was there∣fore just, that, in time of peace, she should contri∣bute
<PB N="288" REF="2970"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> towards the relief of her protectors. This argument carried with it unanswerable weight, and encouraged the friends of the government to try their strength with the furious Irish zealots, who seemed to aim at nothing less than a breach be∣tween the two nations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Address from the commons of Ireland express∣ing their abhor∣rence of libels.</NOTE> Accordingly, on the 20th of December, a mo∣tion was made in the house of commons to address the king, "by making the most solemn and public declarations of their inviolable duty and attachment to his majesty, when the most infamous and flagi∣tious libels had been published and circulated throughout his kingdoms, filled with the grossest insults to his majesty's sacred person and royal au∣thority, violating every rule of decency, order, and government; and tending to stir up, through all ranks of his majesty's subjects, a spirit of discon∣tent, and disobedience to their prince, the laws, and the constitution." This address was strongly opposed, and the Irish patriots, as they affected to be called, moved, that the consideration of it should be adjourned till the first Monday after the Christ∣mas recess. This motion passing in the negative, another was made for inserting in the address the following words: "And at the same time to ex∣press our general satisfaction and joy, at seeing the principles of liberty vindicated and maintained, and the rights of the subject protected from the invasion of power, by the just determination and spirited conduct of one of his majesty's judges, and of an English jury." This most absurd motion, which consisted of a series of falshoods, was deserv∣edly rejected. Another motion was made for ex∣punging

out of the said address the following ex∣pressions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> "That we are truly thankful to his ma∣jesty for the honourable and advantageous peace which his majesty, through his great wisdom and paternal concern for his subjects, hath happily con∣cluded for the benefit of his kingdoms."

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bank∣ruptcies in Eu∣rope.</NOTE> The rest of the session in Ireland was very tran∣quil, and the lord-lieutenant left that kingdom with the greatest popular applause. During the course of this year, most of the trading cities in Germany were greatly affected by a course of bankruptcies, which began at Amsterdam, by the failure of two brothers called Neufville, for above 330,000 l. and a Jew, who broke for near 40,000 l. Eighteen houses at Amsterdam stopped payment, as did a much greater number at Hamburgh. The worst of consequences both to public and private credit, was threatened by this spreading calamity, when the Lombard houses of Amsterdam and Hamburgh, and the authority of the civil magistrates, interpos∣ed. The former advanced large sums of rea∣dy money to all who could give any feasible secu∣rity, and the latter protected from arrests all such merchants as were willing to suffer their books to be inspected, or could give a satisfactory account of their trade. His Prussian majesty, above all, exert∣ed himself in securing from their creditors the ef∣fects of his subjects which were deposited at Ham∣burgh.
<PB N="290" REF="2990"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> In the mean while it was remarkable, that the credit of the English merchants, at London especially, received but a very inconsiderable shock on this occasion. It was plain that the origin of the calamity was owing to the scandalous practices of the German princes themselves, who had debas∣ed their coin to an incredible degree, during the late war. Add to this, that the exorbitancies of agents and commissaries, especially the Jews and Germans, had created a sort of an imaginary credit, which failed them, when the court of England re∣fused to answer their extravagant demands without examination. A calamity of a different kind af∣fected trade about the same time, in a very distant<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the great fire as Smyr∣na.</NOTE> quarter. On the 6th of August a most dreadful fire broke out and raged for twenty-six hours in that part of Smyrna which is called the Franc Quarter, and in which are situated the English, French, Dutch, Venetian, Imperial, Swedish, Da∣nish, and Ragusan factories. The flames raged so fiercely, that the houses of all those merchants were burnt down, the residence of the English consul ex∣cepted, and even that was damaged. The maga∣zines, which had been before looked on as fire-proof, burst, through the violence of the conflagration, and the damage, upon the whole, was computed to exceed 200,000 l. Great complaints were made of the behaviour of the Turkish officers, during the fire, which was such as rather served to spread, than to abate, the flames; and this being known at Con∣stantinople, all the Christian ministers there joined in a remonstrance against those monsters; which, however, produced but very little effect.</P>

The socie∣ty of noblemen and gentlemen for promoting arts, manufactures, and commerce, though destitute of all public support, consisted of above two thousand five hundred members; by which they raised an annual fund, sufficient to encourage the highest enterprizes and improvements for the good of the nation. The progress they made in the ends of their institution was such as must do honour to their memory through all succeeding ages, as their institution is, perhaps, the most public-spirited that ever was formed. This ardour for useiul im∣provements<NOTE PLACE="marg">imitated by the French and other nations.</NOTE> soon spread itself to Edinburgh and Dublin, where societies were planned on the like noble principles with that of London; and the French, the Danes, the Dutch, the Swedes, some of the states of Italy, Swisserland particularly, fol∣lowed the same example The French king opened a free trade for grain through all his dominions, great encouragement was given to tillage and agriculture all over that kingdom▪ where the for∣mer laws, oppressive to trade, were abrogated. A new taxation took place, by which imposts were laid on more equally; and a new account of all the freeholds of the kingdom was ordered to be taken, for the better regulation of the revenue Soon af∣ter this an ordonnance was published at Paris, which rendered it lawful for the parents of young men of family, who were guilty of crimes that might bring trouble and disgrace upon themselves and their relations, without being punishable by law, to apply to the secretaries of state for leave to

There, they were to be delivered to the commandant, who was to station them in a fruitful healthy part of the island, to lodge them in cabbins, to feed them no better than common soldiers, but to furnish them gratis with instruments for tilling the earth, and seed to sow it; the produce to become their own property. They were to have new cloathing every year, and, in case of sickness, to be received as soldiers into the hospital. Upon their comman∣dant making a favourable report of them to the secretary at war, he was to inform their parents and relations of their amendment; but if it was disco∣vered that the latter found their account in keeping the young men abroad, they were to be assisted in recovering their estates, and permitted to return to France, to take care of their affairs. We have been the more explicit in our account of this regu∣lation, as it may admit of various improvements for the benefit of Great Britain; though no English subject could wish to see it take place here, merely by the authority of a king and ministry.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Profliga∣cy of the common people of England.</NOTE> In proportion as public spirit seemed to gain ground among the better sort in England, the com∣mon people were infected with the utmost degene∣racy of manners.

At Maidstone,
<PB N="293" REF="3020"/>
in Kent, and at Croydon, in Surry, no fewer than<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1763.</NOTE> eighteen persons were capitally convicted for atro∣cious crimes. Fifteen received sentence of death at the assizes for the county of Devon; at Win∣chester fourteen, and the numbers were proportion∣able thro' the other assizes of the kingdom; and the executions were sometimes attended with me∣lancholy consequences. On the second of Octo∣ber a most violent storm arose in Ireland, by which many lives were lost, and seventy persons perished by the falling of a bridge. The passengers in a ship going from Chester to Dublin being far too numerous for their scanty provisions, were reduced to a distress that was almost as incredible as their escape. The infamous practice of taking in more passengers than could subsist upon the stores pro∣vided, had been severely felt, when any accident happened to retard a voyage; and no sooner did the parliament of Ireland meet, than they passed an act, by which the masters of all ships coming to, or going out of, the Irish ports, were obliged, un∣der severe penalties, to man, victual, and otherwise provide themselves, in proportion to the length of the voyage, and number of passengers, with proper allowance for accidents of any kind. The earl of Northumberland, lord-lieutenant, exerted himself at the same time, for the relief of the inland sus∣ferers by the storms and inundations, in the noblest and most effectual manner; for besides the assist∣ance he gave them as lord-lieutenant, he present∣ed them with one thousand pounds out of his pri∣vate purse.</P>

The most shameful practices were devised, and the most scandalous falshoods propa∣gated by the agents of a power which severely felt the withdrawing of the British subsidies. Notwith∣standing this, his majesty's system still continued firm both in Germany and in England. Of all the princes that Great Britain had been connected with during the late war, the hereditary prince of Bruns∣wick was, by far, the most popular in the kingdom. He had, on all occasions, exposed his person as freely as the meanest subaltern in the army; and always expressed the highest regard for the British troops, to whom he never failed to give the pre∣ference.

It was believed that great interest was made in Germany to prevent the match from taking place; and it is certain that, in June, his Prussian majesty received a visit at Wesel from the hereditary prince, who was at Aix la Cha∣pelle for the cure of his wound. The fitness of the match on both sides was so evident, that no∣thing could divert it; and his majesty communi∣cated the same to the British house of commons, which, on the second of December, went up to St. James's, with their address of thanks on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> communication. On the 12th of January follow∣ing his most serene highness landed from the Prin∣cess Augusta yacht, and arriving in London, So∣merset-house was appointed for the place of his re∣sidence. His reception from his majesty and the royal family was highly affectionate; and on the 16th the nuptials were celebrated in the most splen∣did manner, though none but peers and peeresses, peers eldest sons and peers daughters, privy coun∣sellors, their wives, and foreign ministers, were admitted. After passing some days in festivities, and visiting the principal places of note in and about London, his serene highness paid visits to many of the nobility who had distinguished themselves in support of continental measures, and in particular, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e visited (but incognito) Mr. Pitt, at his country<NOTE PLACE="marg">He visits Mr. Pitt.</NOTE> seat.

In December 1762, the whole squadron arrived in the river Plata, which they found much better prepar∣ed to receive them than they had imagined. After reconnoitring the river, it was resolved to attack the colony of San Sacrament, or Nova Colonia, which the Spaniards, some time before, had taken from the Portuguese. Though this was, by many, of the crew, considered as a desperate enterprize, yet the adventurers, having their whole fortunes at stake, and the expectation of the public being ve∣ry high, the attack was resolved on. Nova Colo∣nia
<PB N="299" REF="3090"/>
lies on the north side of the Plata, opposite to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Buenos Ayres. It was more important for its situ∣ation than for its riches, as it lay the most conve∣nient of all the South Sea Spanish settlements for acting against the Portuguese; and should it fall in∣to the hands of the English, must be an effectual curb upon the Span<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ards in that part of the globe. Besides the three ships already mentioned, the squa∣dron was attended by some small armed vessels and store-ships; the complement of British sailors and soldiers on board being about five hundred, ex∣clusive of the Portuguese. The expedition was originally planned for getting possession of Buenos Ayres; but finding the navigation of the river ve∣ry difficult, they resolved, before they proceeded farther, to attack Nova Colonia; an English pilot, whom they found on board a Portuguese ship, un∣dertaking to bring the commodore within pistol∣shot of the chief battery on shore. On the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of January 1763, the Lord Clive made the signal for engaging, and soon after anchored under the fire of the eastmost battery of the place, while the Am∣buscade was severely handled by the fire of the middle and westmost batteries, and from some Spa∣nish frigates. As usual, in those cases, the plan of engagement was not exactly followed; and the Portuguese frigate, on which they had great de∣pendence, anchored at such a distance, that none of her shot reached the shore. After several mis∣takes had been rectified, a most fierce cannonading began on both sides, which lasted from eleven in the forenoon till three in the afternoon, when the enemy's fire, that had been before kept up very
<PB N="300" REF="3100"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> steadily, began to flag, and they themselves to re∣tire to the eastmost battery, as the place of greatest safety. In this state of the engagement, when the English expected every moment to see the Spanish colours struck, the Lord Clive was found to be on fire, by some accident which never has been ac∣counted for. No sooner did the flames appear, than it was easy to perceive that it was impossible to extinguish them. In an instant the attack was discontinued: the Ambuscade, with vast difficulty, got clear of the other ship's flames, but was little better than a wreck, having received a great num∣ber of shot between wind and water, and none less than twenty-four pounders. As to the crew of the Lord Clive, some perished in the water, some in the flames, and many by the enemy's fire, which re∣commenced on the occasion. Some of the wound∣ed, through despair and torture, dispatched them∣selves; and many, finding all hopes of escaping vain, ran to the lower guns, from whence they kept up a constant fire, till they were involved in the common calamity; so that no more than seventy-eight of three hundred and forty, the complement of the ship when the engagement began, escaped with their lives, the ship blowing up about eight in the evening.</P>
<P>The fate of the unhappy sufferers was the more affecting (and at the same time inevitable), as it would have been certain destruction for any of the other ships to have moved to their relief. The Ambuscade, in danger of sinking every moment found means to stop her leaks in the river Place and to escape to the Portuguese settlement of Ri▪de

While captain Roberts, who commanded the Ambuscade, lay at Rio de Janeiro, the Portuguese received an account of the general pacification in Europe; but no such accounts arriving at the Spanish settle∣ments, hostilities continued between them and the Portuguese, some of whose vessels and troops cap∣tain Roberts undertook to convoy to the island of Catherine; and thus ended this unfortunate ex∣pedition.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of affairs at the court of Great Britain.</NOTE> The firmness with which his majesty continued to support the new arrangements of his admini∣stration, had been but little expected by those whom it affected. They had, on all occasions, given out that they were too powerful and too popular to be kept out of the management of affairs, to which the administration was greatly unequal; but, in the beginning of the year 1764, the government ap∣peared too well settled to be shaken. Upon the death of the earl of Egremont, the earl of Sand∣wich, who had been first nominated embassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the catholic king, and afterwards first commissioner of the ad∣miralty, was appointed secretary of state, the earl of Egmont succeeding him as first commissioner of the admiralty; and the duke of Bedford earl Granville as lord-president of the privy-council, while his son-in-law the duke of Marlbo∣rough was made lord-privy-seal. The earl of

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Hillsborough was placed at the head of the board of trade; several new members were sworn into the privy-council: earl Gower was made lord-cham∣berlain of the houshold; and all the inferior depart∣ments of business were filled up with noblemen or gentlemen of approved attachment to his majesty's person and government. It was not long before some misunderstandings of no consequence between the French and English commanders in America gave an opportunity for the opposition to renew their clamours against the peace; but upon enqui∣ry into the facts, it was found that the differences arose only from captain Douglas, a commander of a frigate, having, pursuant to his orders from Eng∣land, obliged a French ship to keep within the bounds of navigation prescribed by treaty. The delay of payment of the Canada bills was another objection brought to the conduct of the govern∣ment; and a committee of the merchants concerned in that trade received fresh assurances from the se∣cretary of state, that the most effectual instructions should be sent to the earl of Hertford, to press the payment of the money, which the court of France was willing to do, as soon as it was in its power.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Irish af∣fairs.</NOTE> These expedients of the opposition failing, a very extraordinary application was made to the common∣alty of the city of Dublin, in Ireland, the guild of the merchants, and the corporation of the barbers and surgeons, for distinguishing lord chief justice Pratt with some eminent marks of honour, as he had presided in the court which had given damages to Mr. Wilkes and the printers of the North-Bri∣ton against the secretaries and the messengers of

state, upon the late trials on general warrants. This<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> affair was pushed with great warmth in Dublin, by the party which had lately failed in opposing the parliamentary address to the king against libellous writings. In a quarterly meeting of the guild of merchants, the granting the freedom to his lord∣ship was proposed in a most unprecedented manner, as it had been always customary for that body to name the person that is to be honoured with the freedom at a previous meeting; and, at a subsequent one, to receive or reject him. A considerable num∣ber of the merchants remonstrated in the meeting upon the imprudence and indecency of that body forcing themselves into a party which was disturb∣ing and inflaming Great Britain. Strong objecti∣ons were brought against the words in the resolu∣tion for granting the freedom, "As a testimony of the guild's sense of his lordship's fidelity to his ma∣jesty, at seeing the principles of liberty vindicated and maintained, and the rights of the subject pro∣tected, by the just determination, and spirited conduct, of his lordship," which seemed to be a kind of imputation of infidelity upon others; and was pronouncing a fixed, determined, absolute judgment upon questions in law, which were still litigated and undetermined: and assuming a privilege and right which belonged only and exclusively to the highest and most respectable tribunals in Great Britain. Nay, that it was, as far as their influence extended, and, for any thing they knew, anticipating the judgment of those tribunals, and inciting the minds of men to discontent and sedition; for, should the
<PB N="304" REF="3140"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> questions still in dispute be determined, in the last resort, differently from what his lordship had decid∣ed them, then their solemn honorary act would not only appear absurd, but the minds of all those who should be influenced by this previous and an∣ticipating judgment of theirs might remain soured, turbulent, and discontented at the laws, and the most perfect and constitutional decision of their meaning and force.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Debate upon</NOTE> It was farther urged, that such a resolution was premature, as neither the city of London nor any other city or borough corporate in Great Britain had set them the example: that it was dictatorial, because they thereby stept forth to alarm the peo∣ple, and to declare that the principles of liberty have been attacked, and the rights of the subject invaded; facts of which they presumed to be the judges, by bestowing their freedom as a reward for their defence and protection. It was insulting, be∣cause the commonalty of Dublin thereby interfer∣ed in an affair which belonged to a separate and a superior kingdom; an affair in which the Irish were not principals, and in which their taking the lead impired a tacit reproach upon the people of Great Britain, as if they were insensible of the danger which they had escaped thro' the seasonable firm∣nes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of that great magistrate, by neglecting to re∣ward him according to his services. It was lastly al∣ledged, that the proceeding was irregular, as it vio∣lated that law of the guild, which provided against its members being surprized into any act, by giving them time to examine it before hand. Such were the arguments urged on the part of the lord mayor
<PB N="305" REF="3150"/>
and aldermen of Dublin for their not passing the cer∣tificate<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> upon which his lordship's freedom of the guild merchants, and the corporation of barbers and surgeons, was to be founded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">the free∣dom of Dublin given to lord chief justice Pratt,</NOTE> Some warm commoners moved, that all ordinary business should be postponed till the lord mayor and board of aldermen should send their answer upon this head; but it was answerd, That they had consi∣dered the petition for presenting the lord chief jus∣tice Pratt with the freedom of their city, but did not judge it proper, at that time, to agree to it. This answer set the commons in a flame; the administra∣tions in both kingdoms were loaded with the most opprobrious abuse; and it was affirmed that, ever since the freedom of the guild had been voted to that great man, the tools of power had been inde∣fatigable in preventing its taking place in the city: that among those tools were some men in the most sacred stations; and that the commons of Dublin could not be too vigorous in clearing themselves from the suspicion of all sinister intentions. They were then absurd enough to enter into a discussion of the abuse of general warrants in England, and into all the affair of Mr. Wilkes, with so much heat, that those who opposed the petition saw it was in vain to contend with men who rushed headlong upon such wild unwarrantable principles, and had nothing but passion and prejudice to advance against the most solid arguments. As to the petition, it might be termed an insult upon common sense, by making the cause of the opposition in Great Britain that of the commons of Dublin, and erecting that city into a kind of tribunal which was to be a

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> directory to all the corporations of the British do∣minions. It mentioned, "That no man appeared to them to have acquitted himself in his high sta∣tion with such becoming zeal for the honour and dignity of the crown, and the fulfilling his majes∣ty's most gracious intentions for preserving the freedom and happiness of his subjects, such invin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble fortitude in administring justice and law, as the Right Honourable Sir Charles Pratt, Knt. the present lord chief justice of his majesty's court of Common Pleas in England, has shewn in some late judicial determinations, which must be remembered, to his lordship's honour, while and wherever British liberties are held sacred." It then took notice, that the city of Dublin and kingdom of Ireland owed to lord chief justice Pratt the benefit of the act of the 31st of his late majesty, for better supplying that city with corn and flour; and concluded with praying, That the lord mayor and aldermen would present the said lord chief justice Pratt, the great assertor of the rights of king and people, with the freedom of their city in a gold box.</P>
<P>A motion being made in conformity to the prayer of this petition, the same was carried, and, as if they could not exceed in their adulations, they voted that the thanks of the sheriffs and commons in council assembled, should be presented to his lordship for the causes so often mentioned; and the said thanks were ordered to be communicated to his lordship, in a letter from the high sheriff of the city. It is to the honour of the moderate part of the magistra∣cy and commons of Dublin, that, during the whole course of this affair, they, if possible, outdid their

And to express to them their warmest ex∣hortations, that they steadily persevere in their du∣ty to the crown, and use their utmost endeavours to secure the houses, papers, and persons, of the sub∣ject, from arbitrary and illegal violations. The same day the lord mayor, aldermen, and common-coun∣cil, having resolved that, "the independency and uprightness of judges is essential to the impartial administration of justice, and one of the best secu∣rities to the rights and liberties of the subject," the court voted, "that the freedom of the city be presented to lord chief justice Pratt; and that he be desired to sit for his picture, to be placed in Guild∣hall,

Those zealous pro∣ceedings in the common-council of London were intended as a signal for the rest of the nation to fol∣low their example, and met with a strong opposi∣tion. It was objected, that the members of the common-council, as such, had no right even to elect the city representatives, and far less to pay them a compliment at the expence of the majority of parliament, and even of the English constituti∣on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Animad∣versions on these proceed∣ings,</NOTE> It was observed, that the laws which had been passed by the king and parliament are the sole rules by which courts of justice ought to proceed; that by them, all offenders ought to be tried, and not by the censures or resolutions of a house of commons, which is no court of judicature, where offences not regarding their own privileges are not cognizable.</P>

Had

those endeavours been successful, and had a vote of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> the house of commons passed in consequence of them, it was observed, that such a vote must have been highly unconstitutional, as tending to influ∣ence and to intimidate not only the jury-men but the judges themselves, before whom the causes were to be brought. It was therefore said, that the thanks of the court ought rather to have been voted to the members who thought those endea∣vours to be unconstitutional; that the laws of the land ought not to be influenced by any part of the legislature; and therefore had voted for an adjourn∣ment of the consideration concerning the illegality of the aforementioned warrants to a distant day.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and im∣proper.</NOTE> The same court exhorting their representatives to use their utmost endeavours to secure the houses, pa∣pers, and persons of the subject from arbitrary and illegal violations, was deemed to be highly absurd, when it was notorious that one of those representa∣tives had opposed a bill for establishing by law the illegality of the warrants objected to; and that the first lord-commissioner of the treasury distinguished himself in the debate for bringing in this bill, and shewed himself willing to agree with the gentlemen in the opposition on that head. It was urged that the consideration of the legality or illegality of the war∣rants by virtue of the exceptions that had been tak∣en at Mr. Wood's trial (the under secretary of state) would come before the bench of judges. If that bench was unanimous in pronouncing them to be illegal, the end was answered, without having re∣course to a new law; but if it should be divided, a law was proposed by the administration itself, for

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> rendering such warrants illegal ever after. Upon the whole, it was observed, that the question so much applauded by the address was only intended to serve a particular purpose; and that those who supported it, were actually not in earnest in obtain∣ing a remedy for the evils they had so pathetically bewailed, otherwise they never would have reject∣ed the sanction of an act of parliament to prevent them for the future.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Replied to▪</NOTE> To those observations, it was replied, That no regard was had to the objection brought by the friends of Mr. Wilkes against the house proceed∣ing upon an enquiry into his offence, while he was under prosecution for it in the courts below, at the suit of the crown, and for the house delaying their judgment till the record office conviction should be brought up to it, which would have been a proper ground of their proceeding against him; whereas by censuring him before such record could be ob∣tained, the court and jury would be under an un∣due influence. To this it was answered, That the house of commons, in their proceeding against Mr. Wilkes, had done no more than explain a point of their own privileges, which had no concern with the common law; that the lords had concurred with them in their proceedings; that all possible indulgence had been given him, and that no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣gorous step had been taken against him, till he had actually withdrawn himself from public justice of every kind; and that the lords and commons had as much authority as any one chief of the law could have in determining the nature and extent of par∣liamentary privilege.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> It was urged by the defenders of the minority in support of the motion they had made, that Sir John Phillips, who was to have brought in the bill, was not in earnest; and that, as they held a general warrant for apprehending and seizing the authors, printers, and publishers of a seditious libel to be illegal, they could not vote for a bill to re∣gulate an illegality. To this it was replied, That they had no right to judge of any member's inten∣tions before they found them to be inconsistent with his professions; and that the administration could not give a better test of their sincerity than by proposing a bill which was to declare those war∣rants to be illegal, even if they should be declared otherwise by a majority of the judges. We have been the more particular in recapitulating these matters, as the question concerning the motion made in the house of commons was revived with great acrimony by the minority on the above occa∣sion, and supported by all the skill and abilities of the party. The motion for the address met with no material opposition in the common-council, and it answered the main end which its friends had in view. The lord chief justice, when waited upon by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compli∣ments paid by the com∣mon council to lord chief justice Prat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</NOTE> chamberlain of London, accepted of the freedom, and condescended to sit for his picture. His lord∣ship, at the same time, returned a verbal answer to the chamberlain for the compliments that had been paid him by "the most respectable body in this kingdom, after the two houses of parliament." This expression was shrewdly animadverted upon by some who thought that the two houses of convoca∣tion, the privy-council, and the body of merchants

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The pri∣vilege of franking abused,</NOTE> Among the other public abuses which had long prevailed was that of members franking blank, and other, covers, which were to go free by the post to any part of Great Britain or Ireland. This prac∣tice had arisen to an incredible height, and had in∣troduced most notorious frauds, to the prejudice of the revenue. The most obscure persons ventured upon counterfeiting the hands of the members, and selling the covers so franked in public, with∣out the least fear of detection. No instance had been known of any conviction at common law for this species of fraud, and the examples of punish∣ment attending it in either house of parliament were rare, and almost forgotten; so that the abuse
<PB N="313" REF="3230"/>
gathered strength every day. Besides the two houses<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> of parliament, the inferior clerks of the post and other offices pretended to a prescriptive right of franking, which extended even farther than that of the members of the legislature, who were con∣sined to a certain weight. This office-privilege, which was attended with great emoluments, ap∣peared to be more detrimental to the revenue than the parliamentary privilege itself; it was therefore necessary for a government, which valued itself upon oeconomy, to check those abuses, and to re∣gulate the privilege.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">but regu∣lated by parlia∣ment.</NOTE> When the matter came to be examined in the house of commons, it occasioned more difficulty than was at first apprehended; for though the vast increase of franking was detrimental to one branch of the revenue, it was of service to an∣other, by the immense consumption of stamps which it occasioned: but this inconveniency was found at last to admit of a remedy. It was enacted, That from and after the 1st of May 1764, while the revenue of the post-office shall continue to be carried to the aggregate fund, no letters or packets shall be exempted from postage but such as are sent to or from the king; or such as, not exceeding two ounces in weight, shall be signed on the outside by a member of either house, the whole of the su∣perscription being his own writing, or such as shall be directed to him at his usual residence, or place where he shall then be, or at either house of parlia∣ment, all letters and packets to the lord high treasurer, or commissioners, and secretaries to the treasury; lord high admiral, commissioners, and

That nobleman, in his memorial to the king, desired from his majesty a grant of the whole island of St. John's, in the gulph of St. Lawrence, to hold the same in see of the crown for ever, as one entire county (which island is supposed and estimated to contain two millions of acres of land, be the same more or lets) with all manner of rights, royalties, privileges, franchises, and appurtenances whatsoever, with all civil and criminal jurisdiction, and all manner of courts as in England, and with power to appoint or commission from time to time all manner of officers for the exercise of the said jurisdiction, and for ordering the government thereof. The civil
<PB N="316" REF="3260"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> jurisdiction was to be separted from the military and ministerially invested in the lord of the country but effectually controuled by subsequent provisos conducted with dignity, justice, lenity, and confi¦dence of the people, by persons who will have a permanent and common interest in the prosperity of those over whom they are to preside, and a great stake at home to pledge for their good behaviour abroad, either to the people or the crown, without any expence to the public. The exercise of the ci∣vil jurisdiction was in no case whatever to vary from the common and stated law of England, and there∣fore the subjects on the said island were to be inti∣tled to all the rights and privileges of British sub∣jects, only making allowance for the particular con∣stitution of the island. In criminal cases no capital sentence was to be put into execution without the assent of the king, or his governor in Nova Scotia, excepting in cases of dangerous emergency to the quiet of the island; and in all acts of judicial pro∣ceedings above the value of 500 l. in which, ap∣peals shall lie to the king and council in England. All officers were to be appointed or removed with the king's approbation, and the power of arms was to be regulated according to the antient and com∣mon law in England; that is, the earl, his sheriff, or deputy, was to call together the number of men which, by tenure and common soccage, were to be furnished for the defence of the said island. Upon the whole, this excellent memorial is a revival, with amendments, of the old feodal law in England▪ and seems to have been designed as a plan for the settlement of all the conquered countries in Ame∣rica.

The remaining ten hundreds were to be reserved for the earl's demesne, of which he was to set out a dis∣trict of 15,200 acres for the capital town, and prin∣cipal place of trade in the island. The earl was to accomplish his tenure of finding 1200 men for the defence of the island, within ten years after its be∣ing so divided.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the dis∣pute for the stew∣ardship of Cam∣bridge.</NOTE> The death of Philip earl of Hardwicke at this time, occasioned a vacancy of the high-stewardship of the university of Cambridge, which engaged the attention of the public far more than so trifling a consideration ought to have done. That learned body, during the late reign, had been remarkable for their attachment, and, as their enemies said, for their servility, to government; but, when their chancellor the duke of Newcastle lost his power in the administration, their ardour cooled, and the principles of many of the members received a re∣markable change. His grace had rewarded the loyalty they professed, by bestowing upon them the most unbounded favours, and from that university the bench of bishops, and the best livings in the church of England, had been supplied. The government was fully sensible of its importance, and resolved to avail themselves of the juncture. The earl of Hardwicke stood a candidate to succeed his father in the stewardship, and was opposed by the earl of Sandwich, one of the principal secretaries of state. It was necessary that they should be separately put up; the earl of Hardwicke's turn was first, and the 30th of March was fixed for the election. A

hundred and fourteen voters appeared in the senate-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and the two proctors, who were of different parties, after rectifying some mistakes that had been made in their first accounts, declared that the numbers for and against his lordship were equal. This equality of votes, by the constitutions of the university, put a negative upon the earl of Hard∣wicke's election, and his friends insisted upon having another scrutiny, on account of the mistakes that had been made in taking the votes. The vice-chancellor, who acted as praeses of the meet∣ing, was of their opinion, but the other party re∣fused to admit of another scrutiny, nor would their proctor collect the votes again; so that all the vice-chancellor could do was to order a notorial account of the whole transaction to be drawn up in the se∣nate house. No sooner was it cleared of the mas∣ters of arts, the electors, than the younger part of the university, who were less interested in the event, testified their approbation of lord Hard∣wicke, by a mock-election in the same room, in which he was chosen their high▪steward, with only three dissentient votes, and they afterwards express∣ed their disapprobation of his rival in a manner that bordered upon indecency.</P>

indeed an absolute discharge of the debt, but the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> method of payment rendered it more easy. It was thought with some reason, that this vast discharge of the national debt upon terms so easy to the pub∣lic, would have carried great merit with it; but the gentlemen in the opposition, both without and with∣in doors, were industrious, and, indeed, successful, in
<PB N="322" REF="3320"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764</NOTE> their endeavours to prove, that little or no thanks were due to the administration for their manage∣ment of the finances, because the stocks had fallen. The thinking part of the nation, however, was soon sensible, that this fall was owing to the rapacious∣ness and avarice of certain persons who kept up their money in hopes that the distresses of the go∣vernment would oblige the ministry to give an ex∣orbitant price for supplies. An outcry was like∣wise raised on account of the debt that was not funded. To this it was answered, that it would be injurious to the nation to pass every account, or to give parliamentary security for every bill that was brought to the treasury, by way of public debt; that the immense demands for the war in Germa∣ny required the severest s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rutiny before they were passed, and that it was highly reasonable to post∣pone them till they were examined.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tion,</NOTE> The accounts which were daily received from America gave a handle for continuing the outcry against the government, as if the administration in England had been accountable for all the barbari∣ties committed there. That the French priests and Jesuits did not spirit up the Indians to hostili∣ties against the English can scarcely be doubted; and it is certain that animosities among the English subjects themselves proceeded to a great height. The Connestaga Indians were the remains of a tribe of the Six Nations, settled at that place, within the limits of Pensylvania, but they were reduced to a very small number. Their harmless hospitable behaviour towards the English could not, however
<PB N="323" REF="3330"/>
protect them from a massacre almost unheard of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> among Christians. A certain simplicity of behavi∣our had endeared them to the Quakers, by whom they were caressed, notwithstanding the many bar∣barous massacres committed by other Indians, on the frontiers of the province. Some resentful spirits associated themselves under the term of the Paxton Volunteers, and came to the inhuman resolution of putting those harmless Conestaga Indians to death. They alledged in defence of their barba∣rity, that near a thousand families had been driven from their habitations by the Indian incursions, and obliged to throw themselves upon the humanity of the inhabitants in the more inland parts of the province, who gave them but a very cold recep∣tion, though they shewed all imaginable tender∣ness to the Conestaga, and other, Indians. It was even alledged that they carried their kindness so far, as to relieve the savages who had been the most active against colonel Bouquet during the late war. Admitting all those allegations to be well founded, they could serve for no justification of the tragedy that ensued.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and mas∣sacres in Pensylva∣nia.</NOTE> On the 14th of December 1763, fifty-seven of those Paxton Volunteers, having travelled all night, surrounded the Indian huts at Conestaga at break of day. No more than three men, two women, and a boy happened to be on the spot, who were immediately massacred, the rest of the tribe being abroad to dispose of the few commodities they were masters of among the English. After the massacre had been committed, the murderers set fire to the huts. When the Indians returned
<PB N="324" REF="3340"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> to their habitations, the consternation, grief, and horror with which they beheld the murdered, half∣burnt bodies of their relations, cannot be expressed. The magistrates of Lancaster county, where the tragedy was acted, gave them all the consolation in their power, and lodged them in their work∣house, as a place of safety, promising, at the same time, to protect them. The white people in the neighbourhood commiserated and bewailed their fate, and the governor of Pensylvania issued a proclamation, requiring all magistrates and others to do their utmost in discovering and securing the murderers, and prohibiting all farther injuries to the Indians of the province. This had no effect upon the inhuman murderers. Hearing that about fourteen of the little tribe were still alive, fifty of the Paxton Volunteers, on the 27th of December, assembled, and marched to the workhouse, which they broke open, and entered it with looks that suf∣ficiently denoted their bloody intentions. The poor wretches endeavoured to avert their fate by falling on their knees, holding forth their little ones to plead for compassion, and earnestly declar∣ing their love for the English. All was ineffectual; every one of them was butchered on the spot; after which the monsters mounted their horses, and went off with loud huzzas, as if they had gain∣ed a victory. Those inhumanities were the more barbarous, as the murdered Indians had so intire an affection for the English, that, when they were warned of their danger, they refused to take any precaution for their own safety. Another procla∣mation was issued for discovering the murderers,
<PB N="325" REF="3350"/>
but all was to no purpose. It soon appeared that a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> conspiracy had been formed so deep and strong against the unhappy savages, that the conspira∣tors braved the government, and threatened de∣struction to any one who should attempt to bring them to justice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Obstinacy of the in∣surgents.</NOTE> The Paxton Volunteers made but a poor apolo∣gy for those barbarities, by publishing a remon∣strance, in which they petition'd their governor, that all Indians should be removed out of the pro∣vince, and that public rewards should be proposed for their scalps, as being the most likely means for destroying or reducing them to reason, and that no trade should be carried on with them, till all the English in captivity were released. But we are now to attend the affairs of the continent of Europe, after a long interval, proceeding from the im∣portance of the events that immediately affected England.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Europe.</NOTE> Though the Austrian hereditary dominions had been exhausted of men during the late war, yet it is certain that the empire never was known to abound so much in gold and silver specie, as when it was finished. This was a lucky circumstance for the princes of that empire, who employed their several prerogatives in multiplying money, by a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulterat∣ing the coinage; but however profitable it might be for them, it proved fatal to their subjects, be∣cause it ruined all their foreign credit. The queen<NOTE PLACE="marg">Germa∣ny.</NOTE> of Hungary acknowledged that she had lost half a million of men during the war, and published edicts, offering lands to all who were inclined to settle in the bannat of Temeswar, Transylvania, and Hun∣gary,
<PB N="326" REF="3360"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> granting liberty of conscience to all Protest∣ants who should reside in the two last mentioned countries. On the 10th of May, a separate act was published at Berlin, signed by the plenipotentiaries of the queen of Hungary and the king of Prussia, which gave rise to various speculations. At the time of the treaty of Hubertsburg, which was dat∣ed the 15th of February, 1763, the court of Vien∣na was so much out of humour with its allies, and the king of Prussia with his, that they were not in∣cluded in that treaty. Both parties perceiving that this silent mark of dissatisfaction made no impres∣sion upon the powers concerned, and that the peace was cemented between France and Great Britain, they thought proper to publish this act, by which the French king, with the kings of Sweden and Po∣land, the princes and states of the empire, were in∣cluded on the part of the empress-queen; and the king of Great Britain, the duke of Brunswic-Lu∣nenburg, and the landgrave of Hesse, on the part of Prussia; but the empress of Russia was included by both. About this time the court of Vienna had some thoughts of making a farther reduction of its troops, but the motions of the Turks, and the state of affairs in Poland, prevented it; and, instead of reducing, her imperial majesty augment∣ed, her armies, but at the same time severely pu∣nished all the officers who had misbehaved in the late war.</P>
<P>During those transactions, an extraordinary inci∣dent happened in Germany, where the troops of H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse-Darmstadt, on a disgust which they had re∣ceived
<PB N="327" REF="3370"/>
during the late war from the inhabitants of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Wetzlar, an imperial city, entered it, and putting the magistrates under arrest, carried them off as hostages for their giving satisfaction to the prince. It was thought that this insult would have shaken the peace of Germany, especially as several other cities were equally liable to the same insults, for the same reason. The inhabitants sent a me∣morial of what had happened to the diet at Ratis∣bon, and likewise complained to the college of ci∣ties; but the affair was at last compromised by the prudence of the imperial court, without any farther bad consequences. Towards the close of the year 1763, the court of Rome gave an uncommon proof of its impartiality by its decision in the great appeal concerning the succession to the bishopric of Liege. The candidates were the count d'Outre∣mont and prince Clement of Saxony. The former had a clear majority of voices in his favour, but the courts of Vienna and France interesting them∣selves strongly for prince Clement, the affair was carried to Rome, where the pope confirmed Outre∣mont's election; and the election of the king of the Romans being then in agitation, that count was suffered to take quiet possession of the sovereignty. Their imperial majesties likewise prevented, with great prudence, a misunderstanding that was likely to arise between the chapter of Osnaburgh and his Britannic majesty, on account of the administration of that bishopric during the nonage of his son, whose turn it was to succeed to it by the treaty of Westphalia.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="3380"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> The king of Prussia, the other great power of Germany, was equally assiduous in cultivating the public tranquility, and re peopling his dominions after the war. Upon his return to his capital, he was received as the guardian-angel of his country. He published an amnesty and general pardon to all his subjects whatever, excepting the baron War∣kotsch, who had formed a plot to deliver him up to the queen of Hungary. By another proclamation he gave freedom to all the peasants of Silesia and Pomerania, who, till that time, were upon the same footing with the antient English villains, and were bought and sold with the estates; besides making many other regulations equally prudent and humane for the benefit of his subjects. After hav∣ing given way to justice in the trial and punish∣ment of his misbehaving officers, he set out on a progress through his dominions; and, having just touch'd at Hanover, he returned to Berlin. His court never was known to be so brilliant as at this time, and he affected an unusual magnificence in entertaining a Turkish embassador who had been some time at Berlin. This created great specu∣lation among the other powers of Europe; but it was soon understood that this politic prince meant no more than to make the house of Austria sensible that he had great interest at the Porte. When he visited Cleves, the states of his dominions upon the Rhine assembled, and, in consideration of the losses in the late war, he eased them of part of their taxes for two years. But, under all these appear∣ances of tranquility and prosperity, his Prussian ma∣jesty
<PB N="329" REF="3390"/>
could not hinder himself, from sometimes ex∣pressing<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> his resentment at the manner in which his subsidy had been withdrawn by the court of Lon∣don, and left no measure unattempted to make himself considerable in his Britannic majesty's eyes. Sometimes he complained of the injustice that had been done him, and demanded the arrears that were due to him from Great Britain; but all demands of that kind were treated with silent contempt. Sometimes his minister who resided in London formed connections with the party that was in op∣position to the court, and endeavoured to embroil the proceedings of parliament; but finding all his endeavours unsuccessful, and that his popularity daily declined, for reasons that are foreign to this history, he obtained his recall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">France.</NOTE> The behaviour of the French court, and the good faith with which they fulfilled the terms of the late treaty, gave fresh disquiet to the discontented of Great Britain, who had flattered themselves, in the most sanguine manner, that the French ministry would take advantage of the national divisions, to infringe the articles in such a manner as to found a charge against the ministry; but it was soon evi∣dent, that France had made a thorough alteration in her system. Her court and that of Vienna, all of a sudden, grew cold towards each other, and the empress queen complained, that his most christian mejesty had deviated from the plan of operations which had been concerted between them. The ele∣venth article of the definitive treaty stipulating, that Nattal and Tapanouilly, in the island of Suma∣tra, should be delivered up to Great Britain, and
<PB N="330" REF="3400"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> they being then in the hands of the Dutch, he or∣dered his minister at the Hague to require the states general to give immediate orders for deliver∣ing up those two places to the English. The same minister declared in his master's name, and the duke of Praslin did the same to the Dutch am∣bassador, "That the most christian king, from friendship to the republic, had permitted the free importation of herrings into his ports, by Dutch merchants; but that, in consequence of certain ar∣rangements with England, his majesty revoked this grant." The Dutch were obliged to put up with these requisitions, which they by no means expect∣ed, and the French proceeded to prohibit the im∣portation of all salt-fish by other nations into▪ their kingdom. Notice of this was given not only to the Dutch, but to the Danes and the Swedes, inti∣mating at the same time, that, as the prohibition was general to all nations, no particular people had a right to take it amiss. In June his most christian majesty ordered an account to be brought in of all the freeholds of his kingdom, that the taxes of his people might be more equally proportioned; and made many other salutary regulations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Purish∣ment of the French governors of Cana∣da.</NOTE> Notwithstanding his cares, the public debts were so heavy, that the relief which the French govern∣ment was enabled to give the public was but incon∣siderable. To make some amends for this, the people were gratified in their outcries for justice upon those who had the management of their af∣fairs when they lost America to the English. Bi∣got, the intendant of Canada, was banished France for ever, and condemned to pay a fine of 4,500,000
<PB N="331" REF="3410"/>
livres. The rest of the offenders were punished<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and fined in proportion to their demerits; and the whole sum raised by the enquiry amounted to 12,965,000 livres. This year was remarkable for the dreadful fires that happened in Paris, which burnt to the ground the palace-royal belonging to the duke of Orleans; and in other parts of France whole towns and villages were consumed; but even this calamity was not equal to that occasioned by the storms and inundations which desolated many parts of that kingdom. At Aix a most dreadful earthquake was felt, and in many places the hail∣stones and winds destroyed all the fruits of the earth. The French king had issued an edict, or∣dering that all the crown debts, which are payable out of the revenue of the crown, should be redeema∣ble, some at twenty years purchase, without regard to the original capital, and others in proportion to what the present possessors paid for them. By the same edict, which was registered that day, a duty of one per cent. was laid on all alienations of immoveables.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French parlia∣ments re∣fractory.</NOTE> The French parliaments took exception to these and other edicts. That of Rouen passed an edict a-aginst the proceedings of the duke de Harcourt, who had made transcriptions and erasures in their records, and came to some very spirited resolutions against registering the king's edicts and declarations, but finding their opposition disregarded, most of the members resigned. This startled the French king so much, that he refused to accept of their resigna∣tions, and promised to make alterations in his edicts. The parliament of Thoulouse was equally
<PB N="332" REF="3420"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> repugnant to the royal will, and the duke of Fitz James put its members under arrest, for refusing to register the edicts. Their resentment made an im∣pression upon the king, especially as the province of Normandy made it appear, that, of sixty millions of livres, which they annually paid in taxes, not above fifteen came into the royal treasury. Arti∣cles of impeachment against the duke of Fitz James were presented by the parliament of Thoulouse, and they were drawn up in a strain that would have done honour to the noblest periods of antiquity. They even ordered that the said duke of Fitz James should be personally taken and seized, wheresoever he could be found in the kingdom, and brought to the prisons of the court; and, in case he could be apprehended, his estates and effects should be seized, or put under the administration of a legal commissary, according to the ordinance. An ap∣peal was made to the parliament of Paris upon this arret, and the first president waited upon the king, to know whether his majesty would be pleased to attend the examination?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They prosecute the duke of Fitz James.</NOTE> This was the most extraordinary request that, perhaps, was ever made to a French king. The answer was, that, as the duke of Fitz James repre∣sented his person in the province of Languedoc, he reserved to himself and his council, the determina∣tion of his cause; permitting, however, the parlia∣ment to make such representations of his conduct as they should find agreeable to justice and the laws. This answer proved by no means satisfac∣tory; and a committee, consisting of the princes of the blood, four peers, and sixty members of parlia∣ment,
<PB N="333" REF="3430"/>
was nominated to wait upon the king, with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> fresh remonstrances; but the duke's death, which happened soon after, put a stop to farther proceed∣ings. This affair, however, was not the only point of difference between the court and parliaments of France. The first president of the parliament of Rouen informed the king that ever since the mem∣bers had resigned their gowns, there was a total stop to the administration of justice of that pro∣vince. The archbishop of Paris, as usual, had in∣veighed against the encroachments, as he thought them, of the civil, upon the ecclesiastical, authority, especially in the expulsion of the Jesuits from France, and acknowledged himself to be the author of a Pastoral Instruction on that head, which the Parlia∣ment had condemned to the flames. Not satisfied with this, orders were issued for the peers to be summoned to deliberate farther on the matter, and the king himself was invited to be present; but his answer was, that he had already punished the archbishop by banishing him, and it was his plea∣sure that they should proceed no farther against him. The bishop of Amiens having taken up the pen in the archbishop's defence, the parliament of Paris ordered his performance likewise to be burnt by the hands of the common hangman.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of madam Pompa∣dour.</NOTE> About this time the public of France was great∣ly elated by the death of the famous duchess of Pompadour, whom the people, during her life, had considered as their scourge. She was the wife of a private gentleman; but ambition had rendered her the mistress of the French king, over whom she exercised an uncontrouled sway, even for several
<PB N="334" REF="3440"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> years after he was a stranger to her arms. She was equally vindictive as rapacious, and not only minis∣ters but generals were raised by her nomination. The French attributed to her all their misfortunes in the late war, that they might veil their national ignominy; though probably they might have been equally unfortunate had she never existed. It is certain that, before her death, the French king yielded much to his parliaments, who obtained what future ages will look upon as a complete triumph over his prerogative.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebellion of the Dutch negroes in America.</NOTE> In July 1763, the government of Holland re∣ceived an account that the negroes belonging to their colony of the Berbices, in South America, had rebelled in the month of the preceding February, and had made themselves masters of all the planta∣tions in that settlement excepting three. At first great pains were taken by some who wanted to pass for Dutch patriots, to fix the infamy of this revolt upon the English, whose behaviour soon convinced the public of the falsity of the report. The ne∣groes, at first, murdered all the white men who fell into their hands. The insurrection broke out in a plantation called Magdalenburgh, where about twenty whites were killed, none escaping but those who got on board four vessels that lay in the river, and carried them to Curassoa. Those planters who wanted to secrete their slaves were either put to death, or obliged to suffer them to join in the in∣surrection; and at last the rebellion became general. A hundred of the Dutch militia recovered two of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plantations, and put the rebels to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ght.
<PB N="335" REF="3450"/>
The proceedings of those negroes were barbar∣ous<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> beyond expression. Some of the planters were cut in pieces, bit by bit, and the most favoured had a spike drove through their bodies. On the 8th of March the governor quitted the town, and set fire to it; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the militia, and some reinforcements which arrived from Surinam, they continued greatly superior to the planters and the whites, who were plentifully sup∣plied with provisions of every kind. When the account of this insurrection arrived at Barbadoes, the English governor of that island immediately or∣dered all the assistance to be sent to the Dutch planters that the state of his government could admit of, which put a stop to the progress of the rebels; so that, when supplies came from the European Dutch, they had very little more to do than to complete what the English had begun. But whether the colony itself has been since secured against insurrections of the like nature, time only can determine. We are now to return to the history of Great Britain.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bank of Eng∣land re∣news its charter. See vol. iv. p. 115.</NOTE> One of the principal objects of this session of par∣liament was the proposal made by the Bank of England to the committee of the house of com∣mons for advancing the sum of one million on ex∣chequer-bills, and for paying the sum of 1,100,000l▪ into the exchequer. We have already explained the purpose for which the former of those sums was intended. The latter was meant as a present to the public for renewing the patent of the bank,
<PB N="336" REF="3460"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> which has been long so beneficial to this kingdom, and so profitable to the members of that important body. We are here to observe, that, upon the original establishment of the bank of England, the proprietors obtained their charter upon the consideration of their lending the government 1,200,000 l. at an interest which amounted to above 8 per cent. But the public prepossessions ran then so strongly against banking, which might be abused into a monopoly of money, that an act at the same time passed, by which it was expressly provided, "That at any time, upon twelve months notice, after the 1st of August 1705, and upon repayment by parliament of the said sum of 1,200,000 l. and all arrears of the said yearly in∣terest, the payment of the said yearly interest, and the said corporation, should absolutely cease and determine." In 1697, the term was continued to the 1st of August 1710, upon their agreeing to lend another sum upon the like exorbitant interest; but the privileges were enlarged by a clause which provided, "That, during the continuance of this bank, no other bank should be either erected or permitted by parliament." Before the expiration of the term in 1710, the government found so much benefit from the institution of this bank, that it was enacted, "That, after the 29th of September 1708, during the continuance of the bank of England, it shall not be lawful for any body politic or corpo∣rate (other than the said company of the bank) or for any partners exceeding six in England, to bor∣row or owe any sum on bill or note, payable on de∣mand▪

or at any time less than six months from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> borrowing thereof.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the Bank.</NOTE> Whatever consideration the governors or other persons interested in the bank might bestow upon those who procured them this great and indeed un∣precedented exclusive privilege, it is certain, that upon the whole all that the public gained in re∣turn was in point of conveniency. The whig mi∣nisters found that they could more readily raise mo∣ney by the bank than by any other method of fi∣nancing; and therefore they carried through every measure for its advantage, without seeming once to reflect on the prodigious load of interest attending every one of those convenient calls upon the bank. It was even remarked (though we are not in this place to descend to parti∣culars) that after the East India company had agreed to accept of five per cent. for the in∣terest of the debt due from the government, the bank insisted upon having six, without their being all the while at one shilling of expence for the re∣newal of their charter, though prolonged to the year 1732, and from thence to the year 1742. Thus (whatever may be pretended) the favours of the government, and the public money, have laid the foundation of the vast credit of the bank of England; and the sums which they gained by bank∣ing under whig ministers are incredible. In the year 1742, when their term was to expire, the na∣tion was engaged in a war with Spain; and the go∣vernment having then occasion for money, the di∣rectors of the bank agreed to advance the sum of 1,600,000l. before December 25, 1742, without
<PB N="340" REF="3480"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> any interest to be paid for it after the first of Au∣gust, 1743, from which time they were to rest sa∣tisfied with their original annuity of 100,000l. up∣on condition of their term being continued till the first of August, 1764: in pursuance of which agree∣ment, the act 15 Geo. II. ch. 23. was passed the next session, by which their corporation and term of exclusive banking, with all former pri∣vileges, was to continue till the first of August 1764; after which, upon a year's notice, and pay∣ment of the said 1,600,000l. now advanced, and the like sum before advanced, and all arrears of their said annuity of 100,000l. and the principal and interest owing them on all tallies, exchequer-orders, exche∣quer bills, or parliamentary funds, (except such fund as were otherwise provided for) which the company should have remaining in their hands, or be inti∣tled to, at the time of such notice given, then, and not till then, their corporation was to cease and determine.</P>
<P>All the favour the public received from the di∣rectors, even at this period, was their agreeing to take less interest for the whole of their debt, amount∣ing now to three millions, two hundred thousand pounds, than was that year allowed for money ad∣vanced on the land▪tax. It is well known, that when the great reduction of interest took place in 1749, the general court of the bank, with those of the other two great companies, opposed it, till they saw that the parliament was likely to pay off the ca∣pital stock, if they stood out; and then they agreed to it. By the new act the redemption-clause above∣mentioned is repealed, and it is enacted, that the
<PB N="341" REF="3490"/>
said governor and company, and their successors for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> ever, shall continue one body corporate and politic, by the name aforesai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and shall for ever receive and enjoy the said entire yearly fund of 100,000 l. to∣gether with perpetual succession and privilege of exclusive banking, and all other abilities, powers, privileges, and advantages whatsoever, whereunto they were intitled by the acts or charters then in force; subject nevertheless to such restrictions and rules, and also to such other agreements, as in the said acts and charters are prescribed. The privi∣lege of exclusive banking, is, after this, very strong∣ly guarded, tho' it was thought that some doubts may arise after the first of August, 1786, when<NOTE PLACE="marg">It is de∣termina∣ble in 1786.</NOTE> their debt is redeemable, upon a year's notice, whether those privileges do not cease and deter∣mine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Refracto∣ry con∣duct of the Eng∣lish go∣vernment in Ame∣rica.</NOTE> The next money-matter, of great importance, which came under the cognizance of the parlia∣ment, related to the consideration of proper methods for raising a revenue in the British colonies and plantations in America, towards defraying the ne∣cessary charges of defending, protecting, and secur∣ing them. This consideration took in a great variety of objects, but especially that of preventing smuggling, so as that the duties laid upon the American trade may come into the hands of the go∣vernment. The ministry met with no opposition in carrying through this measure, which in itself was so very reasonable after the prodigious ex∣pences the mother country had been at upon those colonies and plantations, and considering the great probability of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and disturbances with the Indi∣ans

But the behaviour of the assemblies in North America towards his ma∣jesty's governors was far from exhibiting any marks of zeal or affection either to the service of the king or their mother-country. The illicit trade openly carried on between them and the French and Spa∣nish colonies, bade defiance to all law and regulati∣ons, and many intimations had been thrown out that it was not impossible for them to withdraw their dependency upon Great Britain. The disputes in Pensylvania, New England, Virginia, and other colonies, before the late war, carried with them dis∣agreeable prognostics, which were quieted only by the fear of the French. That fear is now remov∣ed; the colonies are not only extended but secured, and the continent of America alone contains above two millions of free British subjects: the necessity of having a revenue raised from such a body was self-evident; but some thought it might be dan∣gerous to provoke them. To this it was replied, that the danger must encrease by forbearance; and as the taxation was indispensable, the sooner the experiment was made the better.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are taxed.</NOTE> On the 10th of March the house resolved upon several new duties on imports and exports to and from the British colonies and plantations in Ame∣rica; the whole amounting to a very considerable sum. Among the other resolutions, one was, that towards further defraying the said expences, it may be proper to charge certain stamp duties in the said colonies and plantations. But this resolution was reserved to take place the succeeding year. It was remarkable that those resolutions which passed into
<PB N="343" REF="3510"/>
laws affected no necessary of life, nor any material<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> for manufacture, nor gave the least discouragement to the necessary population of those vast domi∣nions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The sessi∣on of par∣liament ended.</NOTE> The business of the session being over, his majesty put an end to it by a speech the most extra∣ordinary that had ever come from the throne since the accession of the family of Hanover. Though the election of a king of the Romans was then actually proceeding at Franckfort, and though that of a king of Poland interested in one shape or other all the powers upon the continent, yet his majesty made no mention of either of those great events. The public saw, to its pleasing amazement, that the withdrawing British money from bribing German princes was the surest way to eastblish the tranquillity of Europe; and the immense sums which had been lavished upon German subsidies, during the two last reigns, now rose fresh to every one's remembrance. His ma∣jesty, in general, told the house that he had received as∣surances of the pacific dispositions of the several pow∣ers with whom we were lately at war. He thanked the house for the supplies for maintaining the fleet in a respectable state; for augmenting the publ c revenues, uniting the interests of the most distant possessions of his crown, and for encouraging and securing their commerce with Great Britain; but above all he took notice with pleasure of their hav∣ing discharged a part of the heavy debt contracted and unprovided for during the late war, without imposing upon the kingdom the burden of any new taxes. The calm which was so visible at the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> close of this session was soon disturbed by explosi∣ons from the press, if possible mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fierce than any that had been yet discharged. The veracity of the m nisters was attacked with regard to the accounts of the finances that had been given by them or their friends to the public; and their enemies triumphed till the next publication in defence of the government destroyed the grounds of their opposition. Other pamphlets were published, defending the minori∣ty, as if the question about Mr. W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kes had been entirely decided in the courts below, and that there∣fore no dependency of a litigation ought to have af∣fected the question which had been moved against general warrants in parliament. Some great names were publicly mentioned, as the authors of those pamphlets, nor was the report ever contradicted; but the cause of opposition was hurt by such publicat ons, because both sides having appealed to facts, they turned out incontestably in favour of the ministry. But we are now to attend a scene of a different and a more pleasing nature.</P>

A taste for the arts▪was now united to the love of liberty, and the gloomy habits of prepossession and prejudice began daily to wear off. The public had not for many years seen a prince of the British blood improving himself by travel; and as an heir-apparent to the crown was now born, his royal highness the duke of York obtained his majesty's leave to add the improve∣ments of travelling to his other acquisitions, which
<PB N="345" REF="3530"/>
qualified him to make the tour of Europe with more<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> than an empty parade of curiosity. That he might avoid the fatigue of ceremony, he resolved to travel under the title of earl of Ulster. On the 23d of September 1763, he embarked on board the Centu∣rion, commanded by commodore Harrison, with the royal standard hoisted at the main-top-mast-head; and after receiving due honours from the shipping, he set sail, and arrived on the 3d of October at Lis∣bon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Lis∣bon.</NOTE> A visit of this kind, after the recent delive∣rance of Portugal by the British arms, could not but be highly agreeable to his most faithful ma∣jesty. His royal highness lodged in the house of the secretary of state; he was attended by the king's equipages, and was offered a guard, but he declined it. Nothing was omitted on the part of the court and the ministry, to testify the high sense of the obligations they lay under to the king and nation of Great Britain. Music, operas, and enter∣tainments were every day exhibited for the diver∣sion of so illustrious a guest; the count de Oeyras, Senhor don John, the high-admiral, the archbi∣shop of Evora, the lord chief justice, were ap∣pointed to attend him, and he dined with the count de Villanova. On the 15th of October he went to Mafra, where the royal family then resided, and it was thought he took that opportunity of dis∣charging a private but important commission with his most faithful majesty and his ministers. The Bri∣tish consul and merchants in Lisbon distinguished themselves in entertaining his royal highness with a most magnificent ball and supper. He spent three weeks and four days in the capital of Portugal.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="3540"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> During that time, his Britannic majesty's ship the Valeur had sailed to Genoa, to apprize the British<NOTE PLACE="marg">Genoa.</NOTE> consul of his royal highness's intention to visit that city; and he reimbarked at Lisbon on the 28th of October, proceeding to Gibral<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar with the Thames frigate and Vulture sloop, in company. He was received with proper honours by general Cornwallis the governor; and, after spending two days in viewing that stupendous fortress, he pro∣ceeded to Minorca, where he arrived on the 11th of November, and had an opportunity of examining the fortifications of Fort St. Philip. As the Duke of York, by his education was perfectly well quali∣fied to judge of the state of those two bulwarks of the British empire in the Mediterranean, the public of England was highly pleased at his visiting them; and it has been said that several very useful works are now adding to Gibraltar, in consequence of some observations made on the spot by his royal highness. On the 17th of the same month he sail∣ed from Minorca, attended by the Lively and Thames frigates; and, after encountering some bad weather, he arrived at Genoa on the 28th at night. The good faith which England had observed to∣wards that republic ever since the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, by avoiding all opportunities of inter∣meddling with the affairs of Corsica, where the in∣surgents had often offered to put themselves under the British protection, had disposed the Genoese to entertain the highest opinion of English honour; and the success of the British arms in every part of the globe had inspired them with the most ex∣alted ideas of the British power; so that nothing
<PB N="347" REF="3550"/>
could exceed either the politeness or magnificence<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> with which those republicans received and enter∣tained the royal stranger. The Genoese master of the ceremonies came on board the Centurion, and acquainted his royal highness that the republic had ordered a palace to be fitted up for his use; but as the duke still retained the character of earl of Ulster, he declined that and all the other honours intended him, excepting a deputation of six noble∣men, who were appointed on the part of the senate, to attend him during his residence at Genoa; their names were James Gentile, Bartholomew Lomel∣lino, Nicolas Cattaneo, Jerome Durazzo, Jerome Veneroso, and Dominic Franzone. Most of the Genoese nobility attended those deputies in paying their respects to his royal highness. On the 30th of November he received a present, on the part of the republic, of all kinds of fruits, wines, wild fowl, and other refreshments; and the Duke going on shore in the evening, was entertained with a magnificent ball, and a supper of forty co∣vers, in the palace which had been prepared for his reception. Even the gloomy forms of their reli∣gion were set aside to do honour to his person and high rank; for, though it was advent time, when no theatrical diversions nor masking is allowed in that state, yet, after the ball, the palace doors were thrown open, and a great company of maskers were admitted, to testify their respects to his royal highness.</P>
<P>The 2d and 3d of December were spent in con∣certs<NOTE PLACE="marg">Turin.</NOTE> and assemblies, in which the nobility of Ge∣noa vied with each other in the magnificence of
<PB N="348" REF="3560"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> their dresses and equipages; and nothing could be more splendid than the diversions and entertain∣ments exhibited during the remaining part of the month. His royal highness did not yield to the noble Genoese in politeness. He invited the greatest personages of their republic to an entertainment on the 10th of January, on board his ship, and being sensible of the great sums laid out in entertaining him, it is said that he made presents during his residence at Genoa to the amount of near <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0,000 ducats. On the 11th of February he left that magnificent city, one of the most shewy perhaps of any in the world, and set out by land to visit his Sardinian majesty's domi∣nions. No prince in Europe, the empress queen excepted, had been more beholden than his Sardinian majesty to the friendship of Great Britain, which has rendered him far more power∣ful than any of his predecessors, and an impregna∣ble bulwark to the ambition of France on the side of Italy. On the heights of Lonquette, the Duke's carriage happened to break down; and he proceed∣ed on horseback to Alexandria, a city, which, thro' the good offices of England, had been ceded to the late king of Sardinian by the treaty of Utrecht. The high reputation in which the British royal fa∣mily and name stood in the present king's domi∣nions broke through all restraint, notwithstand∣ing the desire of his royal highness to continue in a private character. When he approached to Alex∣andria he was met in the king of Sardinia's name by the commandant of the place with two coaches and six, which attended him to the governor's
<PB N="349" REF="3570"/>
house, (who was absent on account of his health)<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> under a salute of 30 pieces of cannon, the guards l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the way and presenting their arms. He was there waited upon and magnificently entertained by the chief nobility and the officers of the garri∣son; and a captain's guard attended him. Af∣ter visiting the citadel, which is a complete piece of military architecture, he received at his depar∣ture the same honours as at his arrival; and pro∣ceeding to Asti, the next fortified town, he was there treated in the same respectful manner.</P>
<P>When he arrived within ten miles of Turin he was met by his Sardinian majesty's master of the ceremonies, and his deputy, with the royal equi∣pages, which conducted him to a palace prepared for his reception, where he received the compli∣ments of the king and royal family of Sardinia, and those of all the foreign ministers, who waited upon his royal highness in a body. After this he was carried to court in the same equipages, attend∣ed by the master of the ceremonies, Mr. Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, the British envoy at Turin, sir William Boothby, and colonel St. John. His reception and entertain∣ment by his Sardinian majesty d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffered in no re∣spect from what it would have been had he appear∣ed as duke of York. At the bottom of a private stair-case he was met by the same lord of the bed∣chamber, who had complimented him in the name of the king, and was conducted from the head of the stairs by the grand chamberlain, to the royal presence: his majesty, on this occasion, was attended by the duke of Chablais, his eldest son by his second marriage, and the prince of Piedmont, eld∣est
<PB N="350" REF="3580"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> son to the duke of Savoy, (the heir of his Sardi∣nian majesty's crown) who was then confined by a fever to his room. He was afterwards attended by the duke and the prince to the duke and duchess of Savoy's apartment, where he was received by the rest of the princes and princesses of the royal family; and then reconducted to his palace with the same ceremonies, and in the same equi∣pages.</P>
<P>All this state and magnificence did not exclude the warmest testimonies of esteem and cordiality in the interviews his royal highness had with his Sar∣dinian majesty and the royal family, whose heart the duke won by the politeness, ease, and sincerity of his behaviour. He seemed as if he had been born and educated in the Sardinian court; and when the first ceremonies were over, he was waited upon by the prince of Carignan and his son, the great officers of state, the knights of the order of the Annunciation, and by all persons of distinction about court. On the 15th of February, count Albeni de Belgios came from Milan to Turin on the part of the duke of Modena, who, by order of the empress queen, offered his royal highness the ducal palace at Milan when he should visit that city. The visits of state and public entertainments being over, his royal highness inspected the citadel and the other fortifications about Turin; and then received, by the marquis Calcagnini, the duke of Parma's compliments, with an invita∣tion to spend some time at his court. During the residence of his royal highness at Turin, he gave several magnificent entertainments to the
<PB N="351" REF="3590"/>
royal family and nobility, and more than once<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> dined with his majesty in private. On the 6th of March he took leave of the court of Turin, who seemed to be sensibly affected at his departure. His royal highness then set out for Milan, where he was received and treated with all the honours due to his rank; but when he came to Parma, he only stopt till he could change horses; and he received the compliments from the duke by Mr. Tillot at his coach-door. On the 16th he arrived at Flo∣rence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Florence▪</NOTE> and took up his residence at the house of Sir Horace Mann, the British minister there. Tho' he declared that he would be known under no other character than that of earl of Ulster, yet the streets through which he passed was crowded with spectators, and a guard attended him; but his royal highness politely dismissed it. The marshal Botta, the members of the regency, and the great chan∣cellor of Russia, who was then at Florence, sent to know when they might be permitted to wait upon his royal highness. He received them after dinner▪ but declined the offer made him by the marshal, in the name of the emp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ror, of the use of the im∣perial equipages and palaces, during his residence at Florence.

Hearing that marshal Botta de lined, out of respect, to invite him to dinner, his royal highness sent him word that he would d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne with him on the 19th; and the evening concluded with a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd assembly opened

Six of their nobles met him at a small dis∣tance from their city, and paid him very polite compliments. He was received under a discharge of the artillery, and chose to alight at an inn, tho' the magistrates had provided a house for the use of their illustrious visitor. The same deputies waited upon him at his inn, to desire his acceptance of a present, consisting of eighteen chests of oil, wine, coffee, chocolate, wax, sweetmeats, hams, and va∣rious other refreshments. This present was ushered in by a maitre d'hôtel, (whom his royal highness generously rewarded) and carried by fifty servants in the livery of the republic. The Duke then was conducted in coaches of the republic to the palace, which was magnificently furnished, and had been prepared for his lodging, where he met with a splendid entertainment, of which many ladies partook. A ball followed, with a concert of vocal and instrumental music; nor did the company break up till three in the morning. His royal highness then set out on his return to Florence; and in passing Pistoia, he was saluted by the cannon, complimented by the governor of the place; and after lying at one of the emperor's hunting seats, returned in the evening to Florence, where he partook of the usual diversions. On the 11th of April, marshal Botta and the regency waited upon the Duke to wish him a good journey; and he set out, attended by Sir Horace Mann, for Sienna. He was met on the road by the nobility

Princes, cardinals, and noblemen vied with each other in doing him honour; and the elegant magnificence of this once mistress of the world seemed to be revived in the enter∣tainments of every kind that were made for his royal highness.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> His royal highness returned to Florence from Rome, and from thence set out for Bologna, where he arrived on the 5th of May. Having seen what∣ever was worthy of curiosity in that once famous seminary of learning, and every where attended by the usual honours due to his rank, he set out for Parma, where he alighted at the hotel Palavicini, and was complimented again by Mr. Tillot, who immediately introduced him to his master. The duke of Parma is, in his behav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our, a remarkable exception to the pride and formality for which the Spanish branches of the families of Austria and Bourbon have been generally noted. As he was an early adventurer for sovereignty, he entered upon life with few prepossessions, and his subjects have experienced under him that happiness which results from the good sense of a sovereign, who places his greatness in the welfare of his people. He received the duke of York with the same ease and frankness with which he would have receiv'd his brother; and some English noblemen of great dis∣tinction<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ma.</NOTE> being then at the court of Parma, all their parties and entertainments were agreeably heighten∣ed, especially as the duke of Parma himself is no small proficient in the English language. The illus∣trious stranger visited all the branches of the royal house of Spain then at Parma; often dined and lived in a kind of intimacy with the court; partook of all the diversions of the field and the theatre, where the actors carried their complaisance so far to his royal highness, that in one of their operas, they introduced some complimentary lines upon his per∣son. After hunting in the park of Colorno, and

On the 26th at night, he arrived at Venice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Venice.</NOTE> The government of that ancient, and once powerful Republic, have for some years courted the protection, and cultivated the friendship of England. Fallen from what they were, they omit∣ted no mark of esteem and regard for the British nation, whose interest it is to preserve a proper balance of trade among all the Mediterranean and Adriatic states; in consequence of which, Venice of late has been distinguished with particular fa∣vours and honours. More than one English noble∣man of high rank, during the late reign, resided there as ambassador; and we have already men∣tioned
<PB N="358" REF="3660"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> the great pomp with which their ambassa∣dors appeared at London. The truth is, the friend∣ship of England has secured to that republic the respect of her inveterate enemies the Turks, and of all the Barbary states; and she has, for above thirty years past, remained in a state of tranquil prosperity. Four deputies of the first quality were appointed by the doge to attend his royal highness during his residence at Venice; magnifi∣cent boxes were fitted up in the opera-house for his reception there; and a very fine felucca was built to carry him through the different quarters of the city. He was attended by other feluccas, filled with the English nobility and gentry, who happen∣ed to be then at Venice, and by noble Venetians, all of them rowed by boat-men in English dresses. He visited the arsenal, (and while he was there, they began to build a large galley,) the rope-walks, the armoury, and it is said saw 3000 hands em∣ployed in ship-building. Concerts of music attend∣ed him, and feats of activity, peculiar to the coun∣try, were every where exhibited for his amusement. On the 30th, he received from the magistrates of Razon Vecchia, the usual presents made to foreign princes, consisting of a large service of glass for a desert, and of wax in a variety of forms of birds, fruits, and flowers, to which was added a bureau of very extraordinary workmanship. After those and many other honours had been paid him, both by land and water, his royal highness, on the 3d of June, saw, in a very noble barge, the famous cere∣mony of the doge proceeding in his bucentoro or galley of state, to espouse the Adriatic sea; and in
<PB N="359" REF="3670"/>
the evening he was entertained with a concert of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> music.</P>
<P>These were but preludes to the magnificent ex∣hibitions upon the great canal on the 4th of June, his Britannic majesty's birth-day. The zeal of the deputies was not to be damped by the shortness of time allotted for the preparations of this glorious spectacle, which the Venetians call a public regatta. It is introduced by a race in single boats of a four mile course, terminating in a conspicuous struc∣ture, erected on barges representing the palace of Joy; and in the front of the first story was repre∣sented Venice embracing Britain. His royal high∣ness having received the compliments of all the English noblemen and gentlemen, and the most distinguished foreigners at the house of Mr. Murray, the British resident, went on board a vessel called a bissona, and was attended by a numerous and splendid train of barges, which rendezvoused be∣fore his palace, to the number of nine magnificent peotas, ten fine bissonas, seven margarottas, and one ballotina; all of them terms for various magnificent water-carriages. After the first race was over, his royal highness went ashore to a palace, where a noble collation was prepared for him; and from its balcony he saw the remaining diversions, the most splendid perhaps of the kind of any exhibited since the days of antient Rome. The peotas were emblematical pageants represent∣ing the four elements, Great Britain, the Whale Fishery, the Triumphs of Pallas and Venus, and the Chariot of the Sun; all rivalling each other in pomp, and glittering with silver and gold, particu∣larly

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> the various elegant dresses of the rowers, musicians, and other figures, in each peota, richly adorned with laces, besides the long fringes and tassels of silver playing upon the water. The bis∣sonas were barges with eight oars; the margarottas with six; and the ballotinas had four. Both barges and rowers were dressed in a most elegant taste, and were as fine as silk, gold, and silver could make them. So very expensive were the nobles upon this occasion, that they changed all the dresses of their rowers after the third race.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His re∣turn to England▪</NOTE> The nature of our undertaking does not permit us to particularize the vast profusion of other honours and entertainments, which the Duke partook of during his stay in this superb city; and indeed the variety, elegance, and richness, leave it in dispute, whether the Venetians shewed them∣selves more ingeniously inventive, or emulous of deserving the good graces of his royal highness. On the 16th of June he went up the Brenta to Pa∣dua, where he was received by four nobles; and, as usual, entertained with all the elegances that music, art, and a happy climate could afford. The proveditor omitted nothing that could merit the approbation of his masters, the Venetian senate, in the magnificent entertainments he gave to his royal highness during his residence at Padua. From thence the duke went to Vincenza, where he saw all the curious pageantries exhibited by the clergy and the natives, on the feast of the Corpus Domini. In the afternoon he saw a horse-race, and took an airing in that beautiful neighbourhood, attended by a hundred and fifty very rich equipages. On

On the 17th of August he left Genoa, landed on the 20th at Nice, and proceeded from thence to Antibes, then to Carren, Avignon, and Lions, through Burgundy, and other parts of France to Calais; from thence he arrived at Dover, and on the 1st of September at London.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">where a scarcity of provisi∣ons pre∣vail.</NOTE> Upon the return of the duke of York, after so pleasing a tour of travel, the public did not fail to reflect upon the very different entertainment his royal brother met with from the factions at home. Every foolish or insolent exploit of a French officer by sea or land; every commotion of government; every disturbance occasioned by sloth, vice, or in∣temperance, were, by the discontented, placed to the account of the government; and they were even loaded with the blame of the natural scarcity of provisions which at that season affected England. If the English at this time suffered a real grievance, it arose from the marriage act; the observance of which was now found to be intolerable and impracti∣cable. Numbers of young people of great fortune repaired to Scotland, where they were married; and many great and eminent lawyers having objected to the validity of the Scotch marriages, the parties, their friends and families, were thrown into the most cruel disquietudes, with regard to the le∣gitimacy of the issue from such matches. Their consternation was heightened by a declaration emit∣ted by the presbytery of Edinburgh, who thought
<PB N="362" REF="3700"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> it their duty, in justification of themselves, and the rest of their brethren of the established church of Scotland, "to say and declare, that not one of these marriages, nor any marriage of that kind, has been performed by any minister of this presbytery, nor so far as they know, by any minister of this esta∣blished church. What forms the celebrators of such marriages have observed, whether those of the church of England, or of the church of Scotland, this presbytery knows not." This cruel state of un∣certainty occasioned a bill being brought into the house of commons for annulling that act; but it met with great opposition; tho' probably it will be regulated at a more favourable juncture.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Invasion of the French upon Turk's-Island.</NOTE> An incident which happened in the West-Indies about this time greatly elevated the gentlemen of the opposition. On the coast of Spanish Hispaniola lies what is called Turk's-Island, properly so call∣ed, being the capital island of many others which go under that name. Tho' it is an uncomfortable barren spot, without either harbour or settlement upon it, and only about four miles in length, yet the coast abounds with fish, turtle, and sea fowls; and the soil itself produces salt. As it is impossible for any settlement to subsist upon the island, the property of it is undetermined; yet the Bermudi∣ans and other British subjects resort thither for the benefit of gathering salt in the dry season. Their life is the most wretched that can be conceived, by those who have no idea of the sweets of indepen∣dency and industry. They dwell in huts covered with leaves; a kettle and a knife are their only utensils; salt pork, and when they have time to go in quest
<PB N="363" REF="3710"/>
of it, a turtle or guano is their food; and a straw hat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> check shirt, with a pair of very coarse linnen trowsers form their dress. Their chief customers are the people of New-England, who buy their salt at the rates of from 4d. to 6d. a bushel, for curing their fish, and pay them in truck. In June this year, a French 74 gun ship, with a snow, sloop, and xe∣beque, landed from Cape François upon this unim∣portant island, turned off the Engish, who were about 200, while they were making their salt, plun∣dered and burnt their cabins, and carried their per∣sons prisoners, together with nine English vessels, which they found off the island of Cape François. There they were detained one night, and next morning were told that they might go where they pleased, provided they did not return to Turk's-Island.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Satisfac∣tion given by the court of France.</NOTE> It was generally thought that the French in∣tended to attempt a settlement upon that uncom∣fortable spot; and some gave out that they had robbed the English ships of a considerable pro∣perty. Mr. Littelton, the governor of Jamaica, being informed of those hostilities, lost no time in communicating his intelligence to the ministry, nor they in transmitting it to the earl of Hertford, the British ambassador at the court of France. In the mean time an account of the whole affair was laid before the public, and represented by the opposi∣tion writers, as a plan of the court of France, which was to be executed by D'Estaign, their ac∣tive<NOTE PLACE="marg">See vol. iv. p. 245, 246.</NOTE> but infamous, governor at St. Domingo, for expelling the English, not only from that, but from the other islands and possessions in the West-Indies.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> In short, it was held forth as being a most justifiable ground for a new war.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the in∣terrupti∣on of the English Logwood cutter.</NOTE> An incident of the like kind that happened about the same time, gave them still a more pro∣mising handle for clamour. The reader, in the preceding part of this history, has seen in what manner the right which the English had to cut logwood, in the bay of Campeachy, has been ascer∣tained by treaty. It is certain that the court of Spain has been generally too remiss in the instruc∣tions
<PB N="365" REF="3730"/>
given to their governors, concerning the ob∣servation<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> of treaties negotlated with the English in Europe; and that this omission has been often at∣tended with fatal effects to both nations. After the peace of Fontainebleau was concluded, the English settlers on the bay of Honduras began to cut log∣wood in the month of April, according to the 16th article of that treaty: but upon the 22d of Fe∣bruary 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>64, an order came from Don Joseph Ro∣sado, commandant of Baccabar, obliging them to desist, and to confine themselves to Balis. Upon this the English joined in a petition to the gover∣nor of Jamaica, under whose protection they are, setting forth, ▪that the petitioners being ordered to withdraw from every other settlement, and retire to Balis with their effects, a total stagnation of busi∣ness hath ensued; the commanders of ships, who have disposed of their cargoes to the petitioners, seeing no possibility of payment, refuse any longer to supply them with provisions; that having now no plantations of their own to maintain themselves and families, they see no possible means of preserv∣ing themselves from famine; that having no legal authority for settling disputes among themselves, they are reduced to a state of anarchy and confu∣sion, in which the injured can have no redress."</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">in the Bay of Cam∣peachy,</NOTE> Upon enquiry it was found, that the suspension complained of, had been in consequence of a let∣ter, of the 29th of December, written to Joseph Maud by Phillipe Remires d'Estines, captain-gene∣ral of Jucatan, who had arrived at Campeachy the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of the same month. The pretext was, that it was necessary to do something for securing the log∣wood
<PB N="366" REF="3740"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> trade to the English, and preventing the Spaniards from being imposed upon, by pretenders to the rights of the British subjects. To obtain this end, Don Remires insisted upon obliging, in consequence of a stipulation between the two crowns, the logwood-cutters either to be furnished with the royal schedule, which Spain had expedited to this end, or with the licence of the king of Eng∣land, for the aforesaid effect; and which was un∣known before his arrival.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">which is removed by the Spani∣ards.</NOTE> Governor Littelton, in consequence of the log∣wood-cutters petition, sent an agent from Jamaica, to enquire into the state of the case; and, if pos∣sible, to settle matters. This agent found that the bay-men, by order of the Spanish governor, were limited twenty leagues up the south-side of the new river; and, if catched on the north-side, to be arrested, and their negroes seized. In the river Balis, and four leagues to the southward of its mouth, they were to be allowed free liberty, without inter∣ruption; but if discovered to be any further to the southward, they subjected their effects to confiscation.</P>
<P>It is not to be dissembled that the proceeding of Remires against the logwood-cutters, before they had the necessary information to enable them to conform themselves to his will, was at least cap∣tious; so that he was in fact obliged to pre∣tend, that the logwood-cutters, instead of con∣fining themselves to cutting, which was all they were entitled to by the 17th article of the treaty, had extended themselves, and gathered fruits as in their own country, without waiting for any settle∣ment of limits. Whatever may be in this, it is
<PB N="367" REF="3750"/>
certain that Remires exceeded his authority. The<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> English ambassador at the court of Madrid made complaints of his conduct, and the reply of the Spanish ministry was "that they have not receiv∣ed any advices from that governor relative to this affair; but that it is certain the catholic king has given positive orders to his governor of Jucatan to abide by, and observe the 17th article of the last treaty of peace; and that he will not approve of the conduct of his subjects who act in contraven∣tion to it. That it is the intention of his catho∣lic majesty, that no one shall impede the English in their cutting logwood in the stipulated places; and he will disapprove of his governors and minis∣ters, whenever they act to the contrary, and renew the most strict orders to that effect."</P>
<P>This answer, tho' very explicit, was far from stopping the mouths of the opposition-writers. They called out for a Cromwell to head them; and were even guilty of forgeries, that they might introduce encomiums upon that usurper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As a proof of this, the reader will please to accept, from the publications of that time, the following letter from Oliver Cromwell to car∣dinal Mazarine, on his refu∣sal to deliver up Dunkirk ac∣cording to treaty. "Thou traitor, Mazarine, if thou re∣fusest to deliver up Dunkirk into the hands of Lockit, my friend and counsellor, whom I have sent with full power to receive it, by the eternal God I will come and tear thee from thy master's bosom, and hang thee at the gates of Paris." <BIBL>O.

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> given to the sufferers, nor any punishment to be inflicted on the offending governor. In short, they called out for an immediate declaration of war with Spain. Some of the ministry, perhaps, thought that a more explicit answer ought to have been given; and the earl of Rochford, the British mi∣nister at Madrid, was ordered to make fresh re∣monstrances In consequence of those, new orders were dispatched to Remires the governor of Juca∣tan, in which his catholic majesty disapproved the proceedings of that governor, with respect to his majesty's subjects in the bay of Honduras; ex∣pressed his desire of giving his majesty the greatest proofs of his friendship, and of preserving peace with the British nation; and commanded Re∣mires to re-establish the British logwood-cutters in the several places from which he had obliged them to retire; and to let them know, that they might return to their occupation of cutting log-wood, without being disquieted or disturbed under any pretence whatsoever. Those orders, so far as we are enabled to judge, were punctually complied with, nor have we heard of any farther complaints on that head; and to say the truth, the whole af∣fair seems to have taken rise from the officious tyranny of an ignorant Spanish governor.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of Capt Sy∣brand.</NOTE> Another incident, which happened at this time, afforded fresh matter of clamour.

This it seems had no effect upon the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Spaniards, and the firing continued till the English ship was rendered next to a wreck; many of the crew were wounded; one of the passengers lost his arm, and the ship was carried into Carthagena. Tho' this hostility very probably arose from a mistake of the Spanish commodore; yet the English ambas∣sador remonstrated so strongly upon the head, that his catholic majesty defrayed the expence of curing the wounded English, indemnified their captain for the interruption of his voyage, and gave the pas∣senger a gratification for the loss of his arm. The spirit shewn by the English government on this oc∣casion was indeed highly laudable; but it is to be wished, for the continuance of the good under∣standing between the two nations, that his catholic majesty would, in flagrant cases, punish personally such of his governors and commanders as commit violences against the English, either through hatred or ignorance, as they are equally attended with the same inhuman effects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">En∣croach∣ments of the French in New∣found∣land.</NOTE> During those occasional differences with the court of Spain, an object of capital importance pre∣sented itself in Newfoundland, where commodore Palisser commanded the English shipping. By a sloop of war, which arrived from thence at Ports∣mouth, the French marine upon that island was re∣presented to be in a most formidable condition, and it was given out they intended to fortify St. Peter's; Mr. Palisser not being strong enough to hinder them. It seems certain, that the behaviour of a French captain of a ship of war of 50 guns, had been so very equivocal, that the sloop had been
<PB N="370" REF="3780"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> sent to England by the commodore. Upon its ar∣rival, the party in the opposition pronounced a French war to be inevitable, unless the British go∣vernment were disposed to sacrifice both Newfound∣land and Canada to their antient enemies. In the mean time, however, Mr. Palisser sent a sloop to the French governor at St. Peter's, to enquire into the truth of the reports which prevailed of the French having mounted cannon, and erected works on that island, contrary to treaty. He, in an∣swer, received assurances from the governor, that there was no more than one four-pounder mounted, without a platform, and with no other intention, than to answer signals to their fishermen in foggy weather; that there were no buildings or works erected contrary to treaty; and that the guard con∣sisted of no more than forty-seven men, and had never exceeded fifty. It farther appeared, by the commodore's letters, that there had not been, or were at that time, at the islands of St. Peter and Miquelon, more than one French ship of war of fifty guns, one frigate of twenty-six guns, and ano∣ther of less force, with two large ships en flute, the destination of one of the said ships en flute being for Cayenne, and the other for St Domingo: that none of those ships had, and the commanding of∣ficer assured the commodore none of them would, enter into any of the harbours on the coasts of Newfoundland. The commodore added, that the concurrent fishery in those parts of the said coasts, whereon the French are by treaties permit∣ted to fish, had been carried on, agreeable to the treaty, and in perfect tranquility.</P>

But fresh ac∣counts from America soon supplied them with new matter. After the conclusion of the peace, the government thought proper to send the most posi∣tive directions to their West-Indian governor and commanders of ships, for breaking off all kind of commerce between the British colonies there, and the French and Spanish settlements. Those orders, which perhaps were worded in too rigorous a man∣ner, affected not only the inhabitants of Jamaica and the Leeward islands, but all the British Ame∣rica, whose commodities used to bring them abun∣dance of gold and silver from the French and Spa∣niards, by which they were enabled to make their remittances to England. The most affecting re∣presentations on this head were sent over from the Colonies to England. They complained that all the British ships of war were now converted into guarda-costas, and their commanders into so many custom-house officers, who seized every Spanish ship or vessel which was carrying money to be ex∣changed for British commodities. I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was thought that by this rigour, the French and Dutch islands gained, in a few month, above a millions of dollars, which must otherwise have been laid our in Jamaica.

Those differences perhaps prevailed on the court of Denmark to declare the ports of two of their islands, those of St. Thomas and St. John, free for the importation of all Ame∣rican productions, on paying five per cent. duty; but all European goods were to be imported in Danish bottoms only.</P>

The diet there was so much in the in∣terest of the empress of Russia, that they declared the investiture of prince Charles of Saxony in 1738, in the dutchy of Courland, to be null and void, and acknowledged Ernest John, whom her Im∣perial majesty had restored to that government, to be the lawful duke; and that the dignity should be perpetual in his, the Biron, family.</P>
<P>About the same time a defensive treaty was con∣cluded between that empress and the king of Prus∣sia, containing a mutual guaranty of their respective dominions, and a stipulation of each furnishing the other, if attacked, with 10,000 foot and 2000 horse, or more, if needful. Neither party was to con∣clude peace without the consent of the other; both nations were to enjoy a free commerce with each other; the treaty was to be in force for eight years; and it contained a secret article for maintaining Poland in its right of free election, and to prevent all hereditary succession. This treaty, and the tran∣quil state of the German empire after the election of a king of the Romans, left his Prussian majesty
<PB N="373" REF="3810"/>
at liberty to pursue the excellent regulations which<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764▪</NOTE> he had introduced into his dominions; of which one is particularly worthy of imitation, as it obliges the proper officers to send an account once a month of the behaviour of the inhabitants of their several districts, to be signed by the clergymen of the place, and transmitted to the chamber of war and domains, who was to lay it before the king. One of the first fruits of the good understanding be∣tween Russia, Prussia, and Poland, was seen in that republic formally agreeing to give the title of em∣press to her Czarian majesty, and that of king to his Prussian, upon his engaging never to lay any claim to Polish Prussia. This was followed by the ceremony of a betrothment at Charlottenburg be∣tween prince Frederic-William, presumptive heir of the throne of Prussia, and the princess Elizabeth Christina Ulrica-of Brunswic Wolfenbuttle; but, at this time, a most unheard of tragedy in Russia awakened the attention of all Europe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tragical death of prince Iwan in Russia.</NOTE> Iwan, or John, the unhappy son of prince An∣thony Ulric, second brother to the reigning duke of Brunswic, and of Anne, daughter to Charles Leopold duke of Mecklenburgh Schwerin, and grand-daughter to Peter the Great, had, almost since his birth, continued in prison. He had been declared the royal successor to the crown of Russia; and his pretensions were so strong, that neither the empress Elizabeth, or either of her suc∣cessors thought fit to intrust him with his liberty. It has been credibly given out, that the emperor Peter III. intended to have released him, had he not been prevented by deposition and death.
<PB N="374" REF="3820"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Iwan, by the empress Catharine II. had been re∣moved from the usual place of his confinement to the casile of Schlusselburg, at the time when she was preparing to set out on a progress to Mittau, the capital of Courland, with an intention, as was reported, to be present incognito at the election of Poniatowski, king of Poland, an incident which was thought to be very interesting to her. While she was at Mittau, an account arrived of the young prince's death in the following manner. A lieute∣nant, one Mirowitz, belonging to the regiment of Smolensko, desired, out of his turn, that he might be admitted to do duty in the castle of Schlussel∣burg; which was granted him. About two in the morning, on the 15th of August, Mirowitz, all of a sudden, called up the main guard, formed it into a line, and ordered the soldiers to load with ball. Berenikoff, who was governor of the fortress, of∣fering to interpose, Mirowitz presented to him a forged order from the empress, importing, that her majesty had formed the resolution of resigning the imperial crown of Russia, and of putting it on the head of prince Iwan, whom in conscience she was obliged to acknowledge as the lawful heir and so∣vereign of Russia; and that she therefore com∣manded the governor to set the prince at liberty.</P>
<P>Iwan, when he was committed to the castle of Schlusselburg, had been put under the care of two officers, captain Wlasseiff and lieutenant Tchekin, who appear to have been veterans in the trade of murder, and to have had under them a guard ap∣propriated to the custody of Iwan's person. Their orders were never to suffer him to depart alive out
<PB N="375" REF="3830"/>
out of his confinement, however plausible the pre∣text<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> might be. The governor, upon Mirowitz producing his forged order, disputed its authenti∣city; upon which the other knocked him down with the butt end of his musket. The guard was attack∣ed by Mirowitz, but he was repulsed; upon which he ordered a piece of cannon to be brought from the bastions, and planted against his opponents. The two keepers, pretending that they could not answer for the consequences, rushed into the apart∣ment of the unfortunate prince, who seems to have been entirely ignorant of the attempt, and mur∣dered him in his bed in the most inhuman manner.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mirowitz con∣demned and be∣headed.</NOTE> To convince Mirowitz of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wan's death, they ex∣posed his body at the window, which struck Miro∣witz with such dismay, that he instantly abandoned his purpose, and surrendered himself a prisoner in∣to the hands of the governor and the two officers. This extraordinary instance of moderation was at∣tended with suitable effects. The soldiers of the garrison, who, very possibly imagined, that the order Mirowitz produced was authentic, submitted like∣wise to their governor, who sent to Panin, one of the Russian counsellors, a relation of the attempt and assassination, which was communicated to the em∣press. She immediately ordered general Weymarn to take the necessary informations on the spot, in which there was no great difficulty, as Mirowitz freely confessed all he was charged with. She then referred the whole affair to the consideration of her senate; and to make the proceeding the more solemn, she ordered them to invite to their assis∣tance the synod of the clergy, the three first classes,
<PB N="376" REF="3840"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and the presidents of all the colleges. Mirowitz, of course, was condemned to death; six of the sol∣diers who had joined him, were punished by run∣ning the gan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lope; and an officer who was privy to the design, was drowned in endeavouring to make his escape. It is said, that Mirowitz sub∣mitted to the block with great constancy and re∣signation. The court of Petersburgh soon after published a relation, by authority, of the whole affair; but it was far from being satisfactory to the public. It was generally concluded, that the or∣ders of the two keepers were to murder the prince, rather than that he should escape out of their hands, which joined with his innocence of the at∣tempt, was thought to be inhuman and barbarous.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">States of Sweden</NOTE> It happened fortunately for the government of Russia, that, at the time of this melancholy event, all its neighbours were in a profound state of tran∣quility.

The<NOTE PLACE="marg">and Den∣mark.</NOTE> king of Denmark, as usual, was employed in re∣gulations for the internal good of his country. He had, with a noble zeal for the advancement of li∣terature, sent five gentlemen, properly qualified, to make new discoveries in Egypt, Arabia, and other Eastern countries, and for collecting such curious manuscripts as could be found there, for illustrating geography and antient history. This expedition proved fatal to most of the adventurers, who died on their journey; but it was of service to literature by the manuscripts, inscriptions, and dis∣coveries which they transmitted home. In the be∣ginning
<PB N="377" REF="3850"/>
of September this year, an event of im∣portance<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> to Great Britain, because it strengthened the protestant interest in Europe, took place in Denmark by the marriage of the princess of Den∣mark with the hereditary prince of Hesse, which was solemnized with great magnificence at Copen∣hagen; after which the prince and princess set out for Hanau.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficul∣ties in the election of a king of the Romans.</NOTE> The empire of Germany was at the same time intent upon an affair of the utmost consequence to the rights of the princes who required a participa∣tion in the election of a king of the Romans. Ever since the days of the emperor Charles V. a dispute had subsi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, whether, agreeably to the constitution of the empire, a king of the Romans could be elected during the life of the reigning emperor. The point was partly settled by the treaty of Westphalia; it was afterwards unanimously agreed to in a general diet of the empire; and its contents first took place in the capitulation of the election of Charles VI. and was, on the vacancy of the Imperial throne, repeated in the following capitulations of election: It mentions three cases, which legitimate the election of a king of the Ro∣mans during the emperor's life. First, great age, or a continuing indisposition in the reigning em∣peror. Secondly, his long absence out of the Ger∣man empire. Thirdly, a critical exigency, on which the preservation and welfare of the sacred Roman empire depends. The first fruits of the good understanding so lately restored between the empress-queen and her late enemies, particularly the king of Prussia, was their agreeing upon the
<PB N="378" REF="3860"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> election of a king of the Romans, an object that some years ago had met with insurmountable difficulties, especially from the princes of the empire, upon the restoration of the tranquility of Germany in 1748. This important affair was again resumed by the court of Vienna; but tho' it met with no opposi∣tion from the electors, it was not without its dif∣ficulties. The archbishop of Mentz had convoked an electoral assembly to take the affair into consi∣deration; and the minister of the bishop of Saltz∣burgh presented a remonstrance to the Imperial ministers at the diet at Ratisbon, concerning the rights of the college of princes. The answer re∣turned was as follows: That his imperial majesty was then employed in finding out an expedient for the content and consolation of the princes of the empire, relating to the election of a king of the Romans, without prejudice to the electoral col∣lege; and consequently of such a nature as to avoid all disputes between them. This answer was far from being agreeable to many of the princes; but in March following they received an Imperial re∣script from the electoral embassadors at Franck∣fort, of their having come to a resolution to pro∣ceed to the election of a king of the Romans, on the third of that month. Upon this, the majority of the college, rather than give any farther oppo∣sition to so salutary a measure, presented their as∣sent to the chief Imperial commissary; and the arch∣duke Joseph was accordingly chosen and crowned with great solemnity, at Franckfort on the third of April.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="3870"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> At this time a treaty of marriage was on foot between the archduke Leopold of Austria and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage between Leopold of Austria and the Infanta.</NOTE> infanta of Spain; and on the 16th of February it was celebrated at the palace of Buen-Retiro by the prince of Asturias espousing his sister in the arch∣duke's name. It remains for time to discover, whether those new connections will give any addi∣tional strength to the family-compact between the two great branches of the house of Bourbon. If we are to reason by appearances, neither of those powers are inclinable at present to avail themselves of that measure, so as to act offensively against Great Britain; and any weight that the house of Austria may throw into it, can but little promote the apparent ends for which it was formed, we mean the reduction of Great Britain's influence in Asia and America, which she acquired by her extensive trade and formidable marine. The accession of the smaller branches that are in possession of the Italian states, even of Naples it∣self, can never give any uneasiness to Great Bri∣tain, when she maintains her superiority by sea in Europe; nor is it easy to conceive how it can for many years operate otherwise than defensively against Great Britain, and that too only in case any ambitious scheme should be formed by the court of England upon the continent of Eu∣rope, to the prejudice of any of the contracting parties; an event very unlikely to happen.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Famine and plague in Italy,</NOTE> The state of Italy this year was truly deplorable, especially in the kingdom of Naples and the do∣minions of the church; countries formerly cele∣brated for their fertility and salubrity. This cala∣mity
<PB N="380" REF="3880"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> was owing to a terrible famine which pre∣vailed in Italy, and reduced the inhabitants to great distress. His Catholic majesty, in pity to his former subjects, exerted himself wonderfully in their behalf, by supplying them from Spain with wheat, flour, and bisket. Those supplies, how∣ever, bore but little proportion to the numbers of the distressed objects; and tho' the pope ordered 300,000 crowns to be taken from the sacred trea∣sure deposited in the castle of St. Angelo, yet the relief it brought to his subjects was not adequate to their distresses. Large commissions for buying up corn were sent all over Europe, especially to England; and it was thought that no less than 30,000 tons were imported into the kingdom of Naples alone. This importation was so far from removing, that it encreased the miseries of the inhabitants. An infectious distemper broke<NOTE PLACE="marg">attended by a vast morta∣lity.</NOTE> out, and in less than six months above 572,000 persons died in that kingdom and a proportion∣able number in the territories of the church; nor were other parts of Italy exempted from the same terrible visitation. The numbers buried in churches threatened an immediate pestilence, and those in∣humations were prohibited. The general voice was, that the infection had arisen, or rather had been encreased, through the noxious quality of the corn which had been imported; and it is said, that this opinion was confirmed by the physicians, who had examined the corn itself; but, perhaps, prepossession operated strongly upon the judgment both of the physicians and the public. It is cer∣tain that vast quantites of grain were thrown into
<PB N="381" REF="3890"/>
the sea to prevent the infection from spreading;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and the chief blame of the fatal importation was thrown upon the English, to the great discredit of their country. An epidemical distemper, which broke out at the same time in Dalmatia (not to mention that a famine is generally accompanied by an infection) renders the cause assigned highly im∣probable; but the fury of the people admitted of no reasoning. The magistrates of Naples were obliged to give way to it, by imprisoning their corn merchants. The calamity spread to Sicily, once the granary of Europe; and the Syracusans, in a tumult, reduced the house of one of their principal magistrates to ashes, himself and family narrowly escaping with their lives. The violence of the distemper first abated in Naples and the great towns of that kingdom; and in the capital, about the middle of July, not above 100 persons buried in a day; but at last the infection gradually wore off.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the Corsi∣cans.</NOTE> Italy, at this time, enjoyed tranquility, but the Corsicans still refused to submit to the Genoese, who, finding themselves unable to subdue them, applied for that purpose to the court of France, which had formerly assisted them on the same oc∣casion. In the beginning of April, 1764, the re∣bels had laid siege to Bastia, which the Genoese not being able to raise, it had recourse to that mea∣sure. They were the more alarmed, as the Corsi∣cans had found means to fit out a number of armed vessels of force, sufficient to render the communi∣cation between Genoa and their own island very precarious. They had formed themselves into a regular government, and their aged chief, Paoli,
<PB N="382" REF="3900"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> proceeded with all the dignity and firmness of legal authority, by punishing crimes either against his government of private persons. He had coined money; he had disciplined his troops and established two councils, one for the marine, and the other for the land department. In short, they omitted no∣thing that could prove they were determined to maintain the freedom they had recovered. They<NOTE PLACE="marg">who de∣feat the Genoese.</NOTE> had defeated Matra the Genoese general, who lost above 500 men in an action at Furiani; and they had intercepted some of the Genoese store-ships. They were by no means against submitting to any of the great powers in Europe, but they in∣sisted upon terms, and these were, "A general suspension of arms; the erection of a free senate, consisting of twenty-four natives; exemptions from all taxes and other charges for twenty-one years, to give the country time to recover: that the Corsicans shall be considered as naturalized subjects in all the dominions of the prince who may at any time be chosen, declared, and acknowledged king of Corsica." The Genoese had applied to the court of Vienna for assistance, but received no favour∣able answer, as they were in no condition to reim∣burse the expences of an expedition against so brave and determined a people. The court of Eng∣land had ordered a proclamation, prohibiting its subjects from assisting them; and the other powers of Europe, his Sardinian majesty especially, seemed sollicitous to clear themselves from the suspicion of having any connections with them. But notwith∣standing all those appearances, it is more than pro∣bable that they had foreign correspondence, and

the Genoese minister presented some memorials on<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764▪</NOTE> that head, particularly one, complaining of the subjects of Holland having supplied the malecon∣tents of Corsica with warlike stores.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conven∣tion be∣tween the French and Ge∣noese.</NOTE> The first certainty of the convention concluded between the French and the Genoese, was publish∣ed in August, on the 7th of which month it was signed at Compiegne. It imported in substance, that his most Christian majesty should send seven battalions of his troops into Corsica, to stay there four years, and occupy Bastia, St. Florent, Algag∣liola, and Ajaccio; that these troops should not be engaged in the war, but only be employed in securing to the republic the possession of these places; that his most Christian majesty should fur∣nish them their pay, and bread and meat; but the island should find them fire, candle, forage, and lodging; that the republic should be at no other expence than the stipulated subsidy; that in the places, which the French troops should occupy, there should be no Genoese, and that the republic's representatives there should take cognizance only of civil affairs; that if by the presence of these troops in the island, peace should be restored, the most Christian king should be a guarantee to it; that they should be transported from France about the end of September, under convoy of two fri∣gates and two xebeques, after which these frigates

While this negociation was upon the carpet, some of the Corsican officers had been bribed by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magna∣nimity of Paoli.</NOTE> enemies of Paoli, tho' eighty years of age, to assassi∣nate him. The plot was discovered, and the con∣spirators were carried before the aged chief, who behaved towards them with amazing magnanimity. He told them, that tho' they had forfeited their lives by conspiring against him, yet they were at liberty to depart and to examine themselves, whe∣ther from that moment he deserved their enmity; and that, if they could prove a single article of a criminal charge against him, he was ready to sub∣mit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French sent to Corsica.</NOTE> The malecontents were besieging San Fiorenço, when they had the first account of the convention concluded between the Genoese and the French. They immediately raised the siege, and retired to the inland parts of the country, that they might the more securely lay the plan of their future ope∣rations. Previous to this, and to give their party the greater consistency, they renewed the military oath that was taken by Paoli and his adherents in the year 1754, and which, considering their cir∣cumstances, is drawn up with a spirit scarcely to be paralleled in history <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"We have sworn, and we call upon God to witness it, that we will all of us sooner die than enter into any nego∣tiation with the republic of Genoa, or return under its yoke.

They then resolved to

establish a military committee, to be chosen out of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> the several districts of the island, which was to in∣spect and inforce the regulations which they had agreed upon, especially those forbidding all com∣munication between the free inhabitants of Cor∣sica, and those of the places belonging to the Ge∣noese. They next resolved to prohibit the French from coming into their island on any pretext what∣ever; and that all proposals for peace with the Ge∣noese should be rejected, unless they agreed to the preliminaries proposed in the general assembly held at Casinca in 1761. Paoli by the same re∣solutions was authorized respectfully to represent to his most Christian majesty, in the name of the whole country, the injury he was doing to the free Corsicans, by sending his troops thither at the time they were on the point of driving their ene∣mies out of their island. Lastly, they resolved, that Paoli should be charged to apply to the powers in friendship with Corsica, for their mediation with his most Christian majesty, and to implore their

The public is not informed whether any such ap∣plications were ever made, but it is certain that the French court was at great pains to convince those of London and Turin, that the convention was merely defensive, and such as was entirely consistent with the laws of nations. Towards the end of November, the first division of the French troops set sail, under the marquis de Marbeuf; and by the 21st of January following▪ they were in possession of all the posts belonging to the Genoese. It remains for time to discover, whether any secret articles, which have not come to the knowledge of the public, are annexed to this convention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Poland.</NOTE> We have already mentioned the preparations making in Poland for the election of a king, and that count Poniatowski's pretensions were favoured by the empress of Russia and the king of Prussia, the two powers principally concerned in the event of the election. The courts of Vienna and Ver∣sailles could not with indifference see a prince so strongly supported raised to that throne, especially as he was personally possessed of all the virtues and qualifications necessary for reviving the antient glory of the Polish nation. France for some cen∣turies past had, with great care and industry, cul∣tivated an interest at the Porte superior to any other European power; and this policy had been of in∣finite service to her in her disputes with the house of Austria and the empire of Germany. The em∣press-queen was apprehensive of the consquences of

This opposition was headed by prince Radzivil and count Bra∣nitzki. The former was chief of one of the most illus∣trious families in Europe, and being possessed of an uncontrouled authority over his numerous vassals and dependents, could raise upon his own estates a considerable body of troops.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">by Bra∣nitzki and Radzivil▪</NOTE> Branitzki was a still more formidable opponent by the office he held of crown-general, which put him at the head of the army. The empress of Russia, to support the freedom of the election, as she pretended, had ordered a body of troops to advance to the neighbourhood of Warsaw. This gave a pretence for Branitzki and his party to allege, that no election could be free if it was over-awed by foreign troops. They were joined by the Saxon party, which, notwithstanding the death of the late elector, continued to be powerful and numerous. Tho' theywere not considerable enough to place one of their own princes upon the throne, yet they found means to dissuade several of the Palatines from entering into any formal association for chus∣ing a Piast; and thus in fact, they formed a third party, but appeared more inclinable to favour Radzivil than Poniatowski. The warmth with which animosities are carried on in Poland soon terminated in hostilities, and a sharp skirmish hap∣pened

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764</NOTE> at Posen in Great Poland between the Saxon and Poniatowski parties, in which above 400 were killed on both sides.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Po∣lish ciet assem∣bles.</NOTE> The archbishop of Gnesna, who, during the in∣terregnum convokes the diet, regulates their ses∣sions, appoints inferior officers, and acts with an authority little inferior to royal, a wise, moderate, but resolute prince, favoured the election of a Piast. The empress of Russia published manifestoes, de∣claring, that her sole intention in ordering her troops to march into Poland was to preserve the freedom of the election; that they had orders to behave in the most regular and inoffensive man∣ner, and to pay for every thing they had in the country. All those precautions restored the public to such tranquility, that on the 7th of May the diet was opened without any mischief, and the mar∣shal's staff put into the hands of prince Adam Czartorinski, cousin german to count Poniatowski, the Russian troops being drawn up in such a man∣ner as to secure the freedom of the election with∣out over-awing the electors. Notwithstanding this, several great lords in opposition to Poniatowski, put their hands upon their sabres, and withdrew from the assembly, to which count Branitzki did not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its pro∣ceedings.</NOTE> come. Those noblemen, with the counts Bra∣nitzki and Malachowski, the marshal of the pre∣ceding diet, at their head, drew up a formal protest against the validity of the diet, which they still pre∣tended could not be free while the Russian troops continued in the neighbourhood; and they accused them of having already committed several acts
<PB N="389" REF="3970"/>
that were infringements of the liberties of Poland<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and the election. Twenty-two senators and forty-five nuncios signed this protest or manifesto, which was entirely disregarded by the diet. As the Russian troops in fact had behaved in the most inoffen∣sive manner, the diet declared count Branitzki to be divested of his post of general of the crown ar∣my. He denied that the members had any pow∣er to take such a step, and he ordered his troops to rendezvouse near Lublin. The diet having in∣telligence of his intention, and that the count was daily strengthening his army with new levies, or∣dered a part of their own troops and a detachment of Russians to march after them, and to observe his motions.</P>
<P>The diet, in the mean time, proceeded to dis∣patch the business previous to the election; and such was the zeal of its members against the pro∣testants, that they resolved unanimously, `That the constitutions made against the protestants in 1717, 1733, and 1736, should be put in execution: that no protestants should possess any thing whatever, except what may belong to them by hereditary right: and that all protestants may be legally pro∣secuted, who should possess any thing contrary to the law.' This violence against the protestants was<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severities against the pro∣testants▪</NOTE> equally unjust and impolitic on the part of the di∣et, and added greatly to the strength of Branitz∣ki's party. The constitution of Poland is such, that it is almost impossible for the Poles to main∣tain it without the intervention of a foreign force. Had it not been for the Russian troops, it is proba∣ble that Branitzki and Radzivil might have stood
<PB N="390" REF="3980"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> their ground; but the Russian discipline obliged them every where to give way, without their hav∣ing any reason to complain that violence had been offered to the freedom of the diet. Branitzki retired towards Hungary, and the wise measures taken by the primate prevailed on many of the of∣ficers of the crown troops to return to their duty under prince Czartorinski, grand regimentary.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The in∣surgents defeated.</NOTE> Branitzki being thus driven to a state of despair, centered all his hopes now in being supported by the Turks, in the efforts made by prince Rad∣zivil in the field, and in those of the Imperial and French ambassadors in the diet. The Turks, how∣ever, made no motions in his favour, and the Russians, with the troops of the diet under prince Dolgorouki, kept Radzivil in such awe, that he retired towards Slonim, a little town in Lithuania. There the Rus∣sians overtook the prince, and a smart engagement ensued, in which it is said the young and beautiful princess Radzivil signalized herself in the foremost ranks, fighting by her husband's side with her sabre; and tho' their party was obliged to retire, yet they did it in good order, and the princess was received according to her rank and quality at Breslau, tho' it was publickly known his Prus∣sian majesty was far from approving of the party which her husband had embraced.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The French ambassa∣dor re∣tires from Warsaw▪</NOTE> The general unanimity of the Poles in favour of count Poniatowski, was not to be resisted by Bra∣nitzki or Radzivil, powerful as they were, and their opposition was now considered as the effects of dis∣appointed ambition. Their retreat from Warsaw had left the diet in a manner unanimous; for most
<PB N="391" REF="3990"/>
of the senators who had joined their party, were<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> now returned to their duty. The marquis de Paulmy d'Argenson, the French ambassador, seized hold of the absence of the few members who had embraced their party, to dispute the legality of the diet, and he received instructions from France ac∣cordingly. In an abrupt manner he demanded au∣dience of the primate, to which he was admitted, and both continued standing, the primate having received an intimation of his intention. The em∣bassador produced his dispatches, by which he was ordered to return to France, and to absent himself during the inter-regnum, as his master did not think it proper he should reside there with a party, and not with the republic at large, to which alone he had been sent. This speech was, in fact, a disavowal of the diet's authority, and had been pronounced in presence of many of its members, whom his high∣ness had desired to attend him on the occasion. The primate answered with great dignity, that he was sorry the ambassador's orders were of such a nature, as to prevent his treating him with the re∣spect due to his public character; but that he and the French resident, Mons. Hemin, were at li∣berty to leave Poland when they pleased. Upon some farther conference the primate treated the am∣bassador only as Mons. de Paulmy, and the ambassa∣dor addressed the primate only as archbishop. This interview, and the little ceremony with which it was carried on, was a proof what small influence the French ministry had now in a nation, where their ambassadors, in former times, used to give law,
<PB N="392" REF="4000"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> and where the will of their master sometimes go∣verned the resolutions of the diet.</P>
<P>During these transactions, the Polish male-contents found refuge and protection in the Turkish domi∣nions, where the Imperial and French ministers had been very assiduous in representing the elec∣tion at Warsaw in a light very unfavourable to the interests of the Turkish empire. The Poles now applied themselves with great assiduity to the affairs of the diet, tho' the imperial ambas∣sador had likewise withdrawn himself from War∣saw. On the 3d of September the diet consulted upon the PACTA CONVENTA, or Fundamental Compact, which they were to require their future king to ratify. Such is the attachment of the Poles to their antient usages, that, during the debate, even points of dress became serious matters. All difficulties being at last surmounted, the Russian and Prussian ministers recommended, in form, count Stanislaus Poniatowski as a proper person to fill up the throne of Poland. The election sermon was<NOTE PLACE="marg">ponia∣towski e∣lected king of Poland.</NOTE> preached by a bishop, and on the 7th of Septem∣ber he was chosen king, by the name and title of Stanislaus Augustus king of Poland, and grand duke of Lithuania. Perhaps the election of no prince was ever made upon more constitutional principles, as nothing was omitted in the Pacta Conventa that could bring back the government of Poland to its first principles, or to guard against the crown, from being elective, becoming heredi∣tary. The diet of election, tho' it lasted twelve days, and consisted of six hundred nuncios, all at∣tended with numerous retinues, passed without the
<PB N="393" REF="4010"/>
least disorder; and the ministers of the princes who<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> espoused count Poniatowski's cause were early in their acknowledgments. The letter of congratulation, written by the king of Prussia, is a master-piece of the kind; and its composition would do the greatest honour to that monarch's genius, was it not conceived in a stile more proper for a pupil than an equal <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"Your majesty must re∣flect that as you enjoy a crown by election, and not by de∣scent, the world will be more observant of your majesty's actions than of any other potentate in Europe; and it is but reasonable.

Gratitude to his people is the first great duty of such a monarch, for to them alone, (under Provi∣dence) he is indebted that he is one. A king, who is so by birth, if he acts deroga∣tory to his station, is a satire only on himself; but an elec∣ted one, who behaves incon∣sistent with his dignity, re∣flects dishonour also on his subjects. Your majesty, I am sure, will pardon this warmth. It is the effusion of the sin∣cerest regard. The amiable part of the picture is not so much a lesson of what you ought to be, as a prophecy of what your majesty will be."</NOTE>. His Polish majesty, since his election, has been recognized by all the courts that either befriended or did not oppose it, and has fully answered the high expectations that had been conceived of him while a candidate.

<P>Notwithstanding the good offices of the Imperial<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Frederie of Eng∣land elec∣ted bishop of Osna∣burg;</NOTE> court to compose the differences between his Bri∣tannic majesty and the chapter of Osnaburg, which, agreeable to the provision made by the treaty of Munster, elected his Britannic majesty's second son Frederic to be their bishop and sovereign, differ∣ences on that head were now revived. As that prince was yet in his cradle, the elector of Co∣logne, being metropolitan of Osnaburg, controverted the pretensions of the chapter of that bishopric to the administration of spiritual affairs during the mi∣nority of the prince bishop, and nominated to ex∣ercise the said administration on his part, the ho∣norary bishop of Ahausen, with the title of pontifi∣cal vicar, and the dean and canon Charles de Voge∣lius, with that of vicar general; ordering all the inhabitants and subjects of the bishopric to ac∣knowledge them as such, upon pain of eccle∣siastical censure. This claim of the elector was en∣tered rather for the form of preserving his privi∣lege as metropolitan, than from any hopes of its succeeding; but a more serious dispute succeeded between the chapter of Osnaburg and his Britannie majesty, who, as father and guardian to the prince bishop, claimed the temporal administration and<NOTE PLACE="marg">disputes thereon.</NOTE> presentation of the comitial suffrage in the diet of the empire. The Hanoverian ministry published a strong memorial on this subject, in which they brought various precedents to establish the right of
<PB N="395" REF="4030"/>
administration in his majesty's person. The chap∣ter<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> of Osnaburg distributed to the members of the diet at Ratisbon, before whom the disputes were now brought, a reply to this memorial, tending to prove, that the regency of Osnaburg belongs to the chap∣ter during the minority of the bishop, and likewise during the vacancy of the see. They pretended that in former times, the emperor, as the head of the Germanic body, had a right to provide against such minority; and that since his right was extin∣guished, the same authority had devolved upon the pope, through whom the chapter possesses it from custom, their own privilege, and the perpetual ca∣pitulation, from which it has not derogated, except∣ing that the perpetual capitulation has assured to the minor bishop a pension of 8000 crowns, and the right of retaining near the regency two of his offi∣cers, in quality of counsellors. The chapter then proceeded to destroy the parity alledged by the Hanoverian memorial to subsist between the pre∣sent and former minorities and vacancies; and to shew that they were settled under the mediation of the emperor.</P>
<P>This dispute, which in the two former reigns would have become a parliamentary consideration in England, was in this confined entirely to Ger∣many. The memorial of the chapter was answered by baron Gemmingen, the electoral minister of Brunswick, in another memorial, vindicating the principles on which the measures of his Britannic majesty were founded, when a regency was esta∣blished during the minority of the prince bishop. There the affair stands at present; but there is lit∣tle

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Smug∣gling sup∣prefled.</NOTE> As the ministry set out upon a professed princi∣ple, not only of oeconomy, but improvement, of the public revenue, they took into their consideration the best method of suppressing the practice of smuggling, which had arrived to a height that greatly affected the national finances. The num∣ber of cutters and other vessels that had been fitted out for the suppression of this pernicious practice had been attended with excellent effects, not only from the vast number of seizures they made, but as being so many provisions for deserving sea-offi∣cers upon half pay, and providing and keeping up a body of seamen for the use of the government; but they were not sufficient for the extinction of the evil. The Isle of Man, the property of which be∣longed to the duke of Athol, and was not subject to the Custom-house laws, lay so conveniently for the purposes of smuggling, that it defeated the utmost vigilance of the government, and the evil was daily encreasing, so as to be severely felt by the officers of the revenue in England. So far back as the seventh and eighth years of the reign of king George I. acts of parliament had been made for preventing such illegal and destructive practices; but they were ineffectual for that pur∣pose. The government then entered into a treaty for purchasing the property of this island, or such a right over it, as might deprive the smugglers of the haunts and conveniencies they
<PB N="397" REF="4050"/>
had for carrying on their frauds; but this expedi∣ent<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> likewise proved ineffectual for private reasons, which are foreign to this history. Upon the death of the late duke of A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hol, the treaty was renewed with greater probability of success; but in the mean while the lords commissioners of the treasury took the matter into their most serious consideration, by representing to the king and council, that the en∣deavours they had used for improving his majesty's revenue of customs, and preventing the many frauds committed, especially in the out-ports of this kingdom, were greatly obstructed by the present state of the Isle of Man, from whence a pernicious and illicit trade was carried on to the neighbouring coasts of Great Britain and Ireland, in violation of the laws of this country, and to the great detri∣ment and diminution of the public revenue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of Man purchas∣ed by the govern∣ment.</NOTE> Upon this representation, his majesty, by the advice of his privy-council, published an order, sig∣nifying his intentions, that the laws should be strictly put in execution against smuggling, par∣ticularly on the neighbouring coasts of the Isle of Man; in consequence whereof, the lords commis∣sioners of the Admiralty were to station a number of ships and cutters, under the command of dis∣creet officers, in the harbours, and on the coasts of that island, in order to carry his majesty's inten∣tions into execution; and the government of Ire∣land were likewise to give such directions for carry∣ing his majesty's intentions into execution, as to them might respectively appertain. In consequence of this proclamation, his Britannic ministers at foreign courts notified in the countries where they
<PB N="398" REF="4060"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> resided, that his majesty being determined to suppress the illicit trade carried on in the Isle of Man, would for the future pay no attention to the complaints of the merchants of any nation what∣ever, whose effects sent to the Isle of Man to evade the customs should be seized and confiscated. Those intimations were attended with suitable ef∣fects, the parliament itself entering into the views of the ministry, by authorizing them to purchase from the most noble proprietor of the island all the sovereignty in it that he could claim; and the bar∣gain being concluded, an act of parliament passed for that purpose, and received the royal assent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the German emi∣grants,</NOTE> In September this year, the public of England was presented with a new opportunity of exercising that charity which has always distinguished it from the rest of the world, even towards their enemies. An officious German colonel, pretending authority from the British ministry, engaged about six hun∣dred protestant Wurtzburghers and Palatines to emigrate from their own country, with a promise of settling them in the Islands of St. John and Le Croix in America. Being unable to perform his contract, he abandoned them after they had been shipped for England; and upon their arrival at London, they were in danger of perishing through want. About four hundred of them who had de∣frayed their passage, were suffered to come on shore, `where some of them lay (to use the words of the reverend divine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. G. A. Wachsel, minister of the German Luthera church, in A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e▪street, Goodman's-fields.</NOTE> who so compassionately

Their distresses were ag∣gravated by other severe calamities, which were represented by the reverend gentleman in his address to the public in their behalf; in which he observed, that these wretched beings would think themselves extremely happy, if the British govern∣ment would be graciously pleased to take them under its protection, to allow them for the pre∣sent some ground to lie on, tents to cover them, and any manner of subsistence, till it should be thought proper to ship them off, and settle them in any of its colonies in America; where, he doubted not, they would give their protectors and benefac∣tor constant proofs of their affection and grati∣tude for such kindness; but that they had no friend who had interest enough to intercede effec∣tually for them, or even knew the proper method of application.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who are generous∣ly reliev∣ed.</NOTE> Upon the publication of this moving address, a personage of the highest rank ordered a hundred tents to be furnished, with all necessaries, from the Tower to the miserable objects, and that the pas∣sage of all those on ship-board should be paid be∣fore night; which was accordingly done. This benevolence was attended with a bounty of three
<PB N="400" REF="4080"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> hundred pounds from the same royal hand, and ge∣nerously seconded by private charities in propor∣tion. Not an hour was lost in relieving them. Money flowed in from all hands; subscriptions were opened by public spirited gentlemen at the principal bankers and coffee-houses in the city; and it is to the honour of the present times, that above four hundred guineas (not to mention the many great and charitable donations that came by the like channels) were sent from one coffee-house. A physician of eminence, a surgeon, and a man∣midwife, attended them gratis; and their situation in a very few days became more comfortable than probably they had ever experienced in their native country. The gentlemen who had been the prin∣cipal instruments, after Mr. Wachsel, of making their case known to the public, formed themselves into a committee, and far from confining their be∣nevolence to a temporary relief, they applied themselves properly to know the royal will as to the future disposal of the emigrants. A most gracious answer was returned by one of the secre∣taries of state, that his majesty intended they should be settled in South Carolina, and had ordered they should receive one hundred and fifty stands of arms for their defence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and sent to Ame∣rica.</NOTE> In the mean time, the German colonel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>He had been a captain in the British Legion during the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e war, and being a sol∣dier of fortune, offered him∣self to the Prussian service on the conclusion of the late peace; and was told, that if he could raise a regiment, he should have the command of it. This he undertook to do; and, by making a tour through Holland, where he had formerly been an officer, acquainting himself with the subalter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> officers, and making himself agree∣able to the men, he seduced many to desert, and some to enter volunteers, with pro∣mises of good encouragement. With these and some other recruits, disbanded soldiers, and idle young fellows, he presented himself to prince <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erdinand, who recommend∣ed him to his Prussian ma∣jesty, and he received his commission; but the peace, which soon followed in Ger∣many, again reduced him to the necessity of applying else∣where, and he came over to England, and sollicited em∣ployment in the English service. This could not be granted to a foreigner, when so many natives were dismissed; but on his boasting of the num∣bers of his countrymen he could carry over to our new settlements, provided a suit∣able tract of land was allotted him, the▪ ministry was pre∣vailed upon to grant his re∣quest, and a patent was ac∣tually made out at the pro∣per offices for that purpose.</P>
<P>With this grant he return∣ed to Germany, and by the credit of it, and the advan∣tageous offers he made to some young gentlemen, who had credit with the common people, he prevailed with them to engage in the same project.

<P>There was the greater merit in this noble cha∣rity, as the poor of England at this time laboured under excessive hardships through the dearness of provisions; nor were there wanting many who blamed the charity given for the relief of the Ger∣man emigrants, while so many English were distrest for bread.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An en∣quiry in∣to the cause of the high price of provisi∣ons.</NOTE> The public outery at the dearness of provisions in a time of profound peace and after plentiful harvests was so great, that the remedy became a parlia∣mentary consideration. Some of the most consi∣derable butchers and victuallers of ships in and about London were ordered to attend a commit∣tee of the House of Commons, who sat upon this occasion in March; and they unanimously agreed, that the best beef at that time cost the vender three pence a pound, which was about one half-penny dearer than it had generally been at that time of the year. This prodigious rise brought on other enquiries, which terminated much to the same pur∣pose; and it was found that the price of burcher's meat was dearer than it had been during the heat of the late war; but the event of all the enquiries ended in fixing the causes upon the salesmen; upon which they were sent for and examined. At first, they laid the cause upon the vast increase of population within the bills of mortality, which had rendered the demand of provision excessive. This account not being satisfactory, they pretended that the rise was owing to the late scarcity of pork in the markets, which had necessarily encreased the price of every other species of animal food; be∣cause the whole demand acted upon the whole quantity of the different sorts of provisions, as up∣on one and the same subject. They complained that the wetness of the season, and the scarcity of fodder in the year 1762, with other natural causes, had reduced the quantity of fat cattle, by discou∣raging the farmers from rearing them.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="4130"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> None of those reasons, however, were found sufficient to account for the evil complained of; and the result of the inquiry was, that the scarcity was artificial, and raised by combinations, and the defect of the laws regulating the sale of cattle in the open markets. This practice, tho' endea∣voured to be stifled and concealed from the know∣ledge of the public, was an alarming consideration. It was proved that a few engros<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of cattle, either by themselves or other age<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, bought up large quantities of sheep and oxen on the road to the market, and thereby fixed the price for that day, while other persons bought up great numbers of sheep and oxen; and after they were slaughtered put what price they pleased upon them to the retail butchers; and that provisions were thus doubly forestalled. It was evident that those practices were confined to the London markets, because during the greatest scarcity of provisions in Lon∣don, they sold at a very reasonable price within thirty miles of that metropolis. Notwithstanding the great attention paid by the parliament to this important affair, yet the remedy of it was still pre∣carious; and a bill passed for enabling his majesty, with the advice of his privy council, to order the free importation of provisions from Ireland during the recess of parliament, or, as the necessity of the time may require.</P>

Upon the conclusion of the peace, the mer∣chants applied to his lordship to have the money refunded; and he made a tender of it, to the amount, as is said, of fifty thousand pounds, clear of all deductions, to the lords of the treasury, who refused to receive it, or to defend any action that might be brought for levying those duties, thinking perhaps, that however they might be warranted by custom, they were not authorized by the laws of England.

The major was far from discouraging this proposal, providing it was agree∣able to the British commander in chief in North-America; but he insisted, as an earnest of their sincerity, upon their delivering up all the English prisoners in their custody, which they immediately did, to the number of seventeen, and impeached some of the inhabitants of Montreal of instigating them to the hostilites they had committed. This agreement was the more acceptable, because about

<P>Nothing now remained for the pacification of North-America, but to reduce the Delawares, Shawanese, Hurons of Sandusky, and other In∣dians of the countries between Lake Erie and the Ohio. For this purpose, colonel Bradstreet was ordered to advance with a considerable body of men from Niagara to the countries of those savages; and colonel Bouquet set out with another body for the same purpose, from Canada, intending to carry the war through their most remote habitations, if they did not submit in time. Those vigorous measures produced the proper effects; for when colonel<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another treaty withthem conclud∣ed by co∣lonel Brad∣street.</NOTE> Bradstreet arrived at Presque Isle, in August, de∣puties from the several nations above-mentioned met him, and a peace was concluded on the follow∣ing terms: That within twenty-five days all the prisoners in the hands of the savages should be delivered up to him at Sandusky: that they should renounce all claim to the posts and forts possessed in their country by the English, who should be at liberty to erect as many more as should be thought necessary for the security of their trade, and with as much land to each fort, for raising provisions, as a cannon shot can fly over.

It was likewise provided that six of the de∣puties should remain with the colonel as hostages, and the other four, with an English officer, and one of our Indians, should proceed immediately to ac∣quaint those nations with these terms of peace, and forward the collecting of the prisoners, to be ready at the day appointed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Expediti∣on of co∣lonel Bouquet against the Dela∣wares and Shawa∣nese.</NOTE> The savages against whom Bouquet marched were more intractable. They consisted of the most bar∣barous and perfidious of the Delawares and Shawa∣nese, who had broken the ties which even bar∣barous nations hold sacred among each other. Their treachery was emboldened by their situation among woods, which they boasted were inaccessible to the English. The regular and provincial troops under colonel Bouquet, having being joined by a good body of volunteers from Virginia, and others from Maryland and Pensylvania, marched from Fort Pitt the beginning of October, and got to Tuscarowas about the 15th. The colonel's march threw them into such consternation, that after ho∣vering for some time round his army, they pro∣posed an accommodation. His answer was, that he could not treat till they had delivered up all their prisoners; and about twenty were instantly brought in by the savages, who promised to deli∣ver

Finding that no regard was paid<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> to their promises, they fixed upon the 1st of No∣vember for delivering up the whole at the Forks of the Muskingham, about one hundred and fifty miles from Fort Pitt, the center of the Delaware towns, and near to the most considerable settlement of the Shawanese. The colonel followed them with his army to the place appointed, and obliged the Delawares, with some broken tribes of savages, to bring in all their prisoners, even to the children<NOTE PLACE="marg">who are subdued,</NOTE> born of white women, and to tie or fetter those who were grown as savage as themselves, and un∣willing to leave them, and bring them bound to the camp. They were then informed that they must send off deputies to Sir William Johnson, who was impowered to impose upon them the terms by which they might have peace, but which must be ratified by all their nations: in the mean while they were to leave with the colonel a certain number of their chiefs as hostages, that no hostilities should be committed during the depen∣dence of the negotiation.</P>

This last condition was again rejected by the colonel, because no faith was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be given to their promises; and the savages, who

They then delivered to the colonel six of their chiefs as hostages, and named deputies, who were to proceed to Sir William Johnson. Those wise and resolute measures restored security to the British back-planters in North-America.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A convoy robb'd.</NOTE> Sir William Johnson purchased, at Philadelphia, a considerable quantity of English goods, which were, at the ratification of the general peace, to be distributed among the Indians at the expence of the government; and some private adventurers at the same time gave orders for a supply of the like goods to be trucked with the savages, the whole being loaded on eighty pack-horses. This great supply was intended not only to conciliate the friendship and affections of those Indian tribes, but to open again the channels of a commerce that had always proved beneficial to the English. This laudable measure was defeated by the English set∣tlers themselves, in a manner that would have dis∣honoured the most brutal tribe of the savages. While the convoy was on its way to Fort Pitt, a number of disorderly people at Cumberland Coun∣ty attacked it in the woods, killed some of the horses, and plundered all the packs. Some of those banditti being apprehended by a small party of troops which was called from Fort Loudon, were rescued by their associates in the gang, and only three were carried prisoners to the fort. It
<PB N="417" REF="4250"/>
was soon beset by the rioters, who threatened to<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> storm it and to put every man within it to the sword, unless the three prisoners in it were set at liberty.

The dis∣tance was five hundred leagues, and the current was so rapid that they could not proceed ten miles a day. When they had got about seventeen leagues up the river, ten men were killed and as many wounded, by the Indians. They attempted to land, but were prevented by a smart fire from the sa∣vages; upon which the major having before lost fifty-seven men by desertion, thought proper to return to Pensacola. Complaints of this infringe∣ment of the peace were made to Mons. d'Abbadie the French governor of New Orleans, who dis∣claimed all knowledge of the attack, and pretended to order the Indians to desist from such for the future. It seems, however, probable, that those and other hostilities committed about this time against the British subjects in America, tho' not authorized by the court of France, or any of its go∣vernors, were prompted by French agents and Jesuits, the devoted enemies of all protestants, es∣pecially English.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> In April the garrison of Halifax in Nova Scotia<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remark∣able obe∣dience of the garri∣son at Halifax.</NOTE> gave a signal proof of their obedience to military discipline. The same orders that had occasioned the Quebec mutiny, had been sent from general Gage at Montreal to major Hamilton, who com∣manded in garrison the fortieth regiment and a company of the royal artiliery at Halifax. He or∣dered his men under arms upon their respective parades, and acquainted them with the orders (to which it is probable they were no strangers) telling them at the same time, they must be carried into im∣mediate execution. The men presented a paper to their serjeant-major, which they required to be de∣livered to the major. It was penned in a man∣ner and stile that does great honour to them, both as soldiers and subjects, and seems indeed to have been drawn up by no vulgar hand. They expres∣sed their consciousness of having at all times faith∣fully discharged their duty to his majesty, "and (continued they) considering ourselves after the war in a state of banishment, when we hoped to return home, the regiment having served upwards of forty years abroad, do acknowledge that we thought it hard to pay for provisions in a country where they had always been allowed, and where necessaries are so dear; and we were sorry to be under a necessity of declining the stoppage till his majesty's pleasure was further known, which in∣dulgence the general at first promised us.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Disputes between the go∣vernor and as∣sembly of South Carolina▪</NOTE> About this time the assembly of South Carolina had such disputes with their governor, that they drew up a petition against him to the king. The lords of trade had sent to that province a number of French protestants in the silk manufactory, and re∣commended them to be settled there. This was undoubtedly a most valuable acquisition to the co∣lony; but the differences between the governor and the inhabitants for some time prevented any provision being made for the emigrants, till the common house of assembly voted them five hun∣dred pounds. In July following general Gage wrote to the governor of that province a letter, re∣commending provision to be made for the Chero∣kee and Chichasah Indians, in order to prevail on them to intercept a convoy of supplies from the French to the Shawanese, Delawares, and the In∣dians of d'Etroit, and to assist his majesty's troops going up to the Mississippi. The council some∣time before this message had rejected a tax bill, which had passed the house of assembly, for paying the debts of the province; and tho' they were not insensible of the justice and expediency of what had been recommended by general Gage, yet they made use of that rejection, as an argument for opposing his request, by alledging, that they could not consent to any encrease of the provincial ex∣pences; because the suppliers of the public, by the said rejection, must clearly perceive that their ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of payment do not so much depend on the faith and honour of their natural representatives,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the dis∣putes a∣bout the stamp du∣ties in A∣merica.</NOTE> About this time an universal spirit of dissatisfac∣tion with the mother▪country gained ground a∣mong all her colonists in America, and gave room for many dark suspicions, which the conduct of the assemblies there rather <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncreased than allayed.

In the year 1764, when certain duties were imposed upon the colonies, to be applied for their own defence, the first lord of the Treasury in Eng∣land, out of tenderness to the Americans, postpon∣ed the charging them with stamp duties, till the sense of their several assemblies could be taken, how far they were willing to make a compensa∣tion in any other form, for the revenue that such
<PB N="421" REF="4290"/>
a taxation might produce. This was so uncom∣mon<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> an instance of condescension, that the agents for the colonies residing at London thought it their duty to wait upon him as chancellor of the exchequer, and return him thanks in the name of their constituents; and he took that oppor∣tunity to inform them, that it was then in the power of the colonies, by agreeing to that tax, to establish a precedent for their being consulted for the future, before any tax was imposed upon them by the British parliament.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The colo∣nists re∣monstrate against them.</NOTE> This humanity was far from having the proper effect; for the colonists being informed of the chancellor's proposal, instead of complying, re∣monstrated; and, as we have already hinted, some of them actually sent over petitions to the king, lords, and commons, positively and directly ques∣tioning the power of the parliament, in impos∣ing any tax that could affect the properties of the colonists; and tho' some of the provinces were more moderate in their remonstrances, yet they did not instruct their agents either to agree to the duty in question, or to offer any compensation to be exempted from it. Two of the agents only said, that they were instructed to consent, that their principals should bear their proportion of the duty; but they did not venture, when questioned, to say, that they were authorized to agree for any particular sum. All imaginable methods were taken to con∣vince the colonists of their mistake before the mat∣ter came under a parliamentary consideration.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> It was unanswerably proved that the common<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a∣gainst the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answered.</NOTE> law of England could object to no tax imposed by the British parliament. With regard to char∣ters or grants of the crown, that of Pensylvania (which has been always thought to be extremely favourable to the colonists) expressly reserved to parliament the power of taxing them; and the le∣gislative assemblies of Connecticut, Massachusets Bay, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, are tied up from passing any acts that are repugnant, or not confermable, to the laws of Great Britain. The people of Maryland are the only British pro∣vincials in America, whose charter declares, "That the inhabitants shall not be subject to any imposi∣tions or taxes, but such as their house of burgesses shall consent to." But they were almost the only people in America who did not pretend to be ex∣empted from parl amentary taxation. This acquies∣cence proceeded from a rational conviction, that the exemption expressed in their charter, tho' it limited the power of the prerogative, could not limit that of the parliament, which has exercised acts of legislature, over-ruling even the common law of England, in America. This was proved by an act of parliament passed in 1733, which abrogates so much of the common law as relates to the de∣scents of freeholds in America, takes from the son the right of inheritance in the lands the crown had granted to the father and his heirs in absolute fee, makes them assets, and applies them to the payment of debts and accounts contracted by the father, without the participation of the son. The same act sets aside the fort of evidence required by
<PB N="423" REF="4310"/>
the common law, and established by every court of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> justice in America in proof of a debt, and enjoins the admission of an affidavit made EX PARTE by a person in Great Britain, before the chief magistrate of any corporation, as evidence equivalent to VIVA VOCE evidence in all courts of justice in the co∣lonies.</P>
<P>Were any farther proof of the parliament's power over the colonies wanting, the mutiny and desertion bill, which renders the troops raised in America subject to the same pains and penalties as the British, might be instanced; as the American troops never were liable to those punishments be∣fore the first year of the late war.</P>
<P>The reasoning drawn against the American taxa∣tions, because the inhabitants are not represented in the British parliament, is equally absurd and dan∣gerous, as it is certain that sixteen out of twenty parts of the people of Great Britain are not re∣presented in parliament. Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, with many other opulent and popu∣lous places in England, might urge the same plea with much better grace. As to the impracticabi∣lity or inconveniency of the British parliament taxing the American colonies, the latter argument was admitted; but as there was an indispensable ne∣cessity for the taxation, the imposing it by par∣liament was the only method that could answer the purpose, since the colonies could never agree a∣mong themselves about their several proportions of the duty, and the prerogative could not warrant the crown in insisting upon any specifical sum from each province.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Such was the state of this most important ques∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the colo∣nies.</NOTE> at a time when the British colonies were in a more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> state than they ever had experi∣enced. They owed to the merchants of London four millions sterling, and the latter were so ready and willing to give them farther credit, that some of the American legislatures (as appears by the tax, a∣mounting almost to a prohibition, we have already mentioned imposed upon the importation of ne∣groes into South Carolina) passed acts against incur∣ring such credit for the future. This unbounded confidence of the British merchants, arose from their knowing that no provincial legislature had a power to bar them from recovering their property, even in the inmost recesses of America, and that no frau∣dulent investiture could evade the justice of the English laws. Upon the whole, however divided the British parliament was in other points, all the members concu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red in not suffering the petition, which questioned their jurisdiction, to be read in the House of Commons. It was proposed on the part of the ministry, in order to mitigate matters, that the agents should join in a petition to the house, for their being heard by counsel in behalf of their respective colonies against the tax. But tho' a very favourable precedent might have thereby been established in favour of the colonies, the agents did not think themselves impowered to agree to such a petition. It remains for time to discover what effect this taxation may have in America; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is certain that the British colonists on that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are every day stretching their resentment <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their mother country as far as they can, by

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Party di∣visions.</NOTE> During the session of parliament, some of the members who were in the highest posts in the army, thought proper to dissent from the ministry, especially in the great question of the legility of gene∣ral warrants, and among others, lieutenant-general C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>had distinguished himself, or at least it was so re∣presented, in the opposition. The administration, with the chancellor of the exchequer at its head, had again and again insisted upon extirpating the prac∣tice of issuing such warrants from a secretary of state's office, and for making them illegal, while the opposition, as we have already seen, insisted upon declaring them so by a vote of one house of parliament, and the division ran so near, that the court carried the question only by fourteen voices, viz. two hundred and thirty-two to two hundred and eighteen. Had the question been decided in favour of the opposition, the monument of London was to have been illuminated in the same manner as it was in the year 1732, when the famous ex∣cise scheme was defeated, and the most triumphant rejoicings were to have been celebrated. As pre∣parations for those purposes had been openly made, they were considered as so many insults upon go∣vernment, and however the zeal of the citizens, or independent and uninformed persons might in∣fluence them, it was thought indecent in any of

Whatever may be in those allegations, it is certain that the general was dismissed from his employ∣ments, both at court and in the army. Without presuming to descend into an examination on either of the justice or merits of this dismission, it is cer∣tain that it was unpopular, and opened a wide field of accusation against the ministry. The general had been twenty-seven years in the service, and had been formed under, and approved of, by those great commanders, the duke of Cumberland and prince Ferdinand of Brunswick. His conduct in a mili∣tary capacity had been not only unexceptionable, but exemplary; and in the House of Commons he was considered as the ablest speaker of any of∣ficer in the army.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Argu∣ments in his fa∣vour.</NOTE> The dismission of lord Cobham, the duke of Bol∣ton, and the earl of Westmoreland in the late reign, was instanced by the friends of the ministry, as a precedent for that of the general; but said the friends of Mr. C. "That those officers were broken is certainly true; but with a wide and material difference from the case of general C▪ They were engaged in the most offensive and de∣clared opposition against the court, and yet their dismission was discussed in parliament, and followed by a memorable protest, signed by several great lords now living." Whether the step was constitutional,

or not, is another question; but it certainly bore<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> no resemblance to the case of Mr. C. who was in no opposition."</P>
<P>These facts, on which this reasoning was found∣ed, were strongly opposed by the administration, who pretended that the general had been personally obnoxious to the government, by exceeding the bounds even of his parliamentary capacity in op∣posing his majesty's measures, and that he had of∣ficiously interfered in the case of general warrants. The dispute is delicate, supposing what never can be admitted, that a member of parliament can be independent as an officer of the army. The gene∣neral and his friends very properly insisted upon his being as independent as any other gentleman in the House of Commons, and that he ought to be as free in giving his vote. His majesty's mini∣sters were far from disputing that principle; but they pretended that the king ought to have an equal freedom in employing whom he pleased in the departments that were in his disposal. Thus the question was balanced, but with this advantage on the side of the crown, that the heat of the party, for which the general was an advocate, was now encreased, so as to threaten a civil commotion, in which case the assistance of the military must be called in. The result is, that every military gen∣tleman, however independent his seat in parliament may be, must consider himself as dependent upon the crown, for holding his preferments in the army.</P>

The duke men∣tioned him in such favourable terms to his Britannic majesty, that he was employed to carry the ratifica∣tions of the definitive treaty to France; and when the duke de Nivernois left the court of Great Bri∣tain, he remained at London with the character, first of minister, then of minister plenipotentiary, for the affairs of France.</P>

It must be owned, that the chevalier, by this publication, exhibited both the court and fi∣nances of France in a most despicable light; and his undoubtedly contributed to the resentment of that court. The count de Guerchy had strong reasons, which we shall not here particularize, for prosecuting the chevalier with severity, and he brought against him an information in the court of King's Bench for a libel. The chevalier at first<NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of his let∣ters.</NOTE> thought himself protected by his character, but he soon found that the laws of England were superior even to the king. He wrote and printed letters to the lord chief justice Mansfield, the earl of Bute, earl Temple, and Mr. Pitt, weakly imagining that he might thereby unite both to the court and op∣position in his favour. Finding all his efforts for that purpose ineffectual, he endeavoured to interest the public in his quarrel by the following alarm∣ing declaration, which he published: "I am, says he, assured, from undoubted authority, that my enemies have resolved to carry me off by force or

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764</NOTE> stratagem. London, at this instant, swarms with officers and spies from the police of Paris, with a captain at their head; they keep about between the bridge of London and Westminster, in which, should they unhappily seize my person, they mean to transport me to Gravesend, where a small armed vessel is held in readiness to sail with me to France, the instant I am conveyed on board."</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged that the chevalier could not have fallen upon a more effectual me∣thod for prepossessing the public of England in his favour, than by the above pretext; but to add commiseration to resentment in his letter addressed to lord Mansfield, he had the following expres∣sions: "I carefully avoid every one the least in∣fringement of the laws; if the laws then were to appear armed against my liberty, ought not I to suppose it a pretence used by my enemies to get me in their power; and in this case, does not the laws authorise me to repel force by force; and should the most fatal accidents result from such a step, were these laws to condemn me, which I cannot conceive, the spirit of those laws must feel the stroke." The voice of the public certainly be-friended the chevalier, till it was discovered that his apprehensions were entirely without founda∣tion; and being found guilty of a libel against the count de Guerchy, he was forced to abscond. This drew upon him many legal censures, and the public were for some time amazed at a pompous account published in the news papers, of a private house in Scotland-Yard having been broken open by six persons to find him; but this was soon dis∣covered

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of Mr. Legge's papers.</NOTE> The death of Mr. Legge about this time raised the expectations of the public to an inconceiveable degree. He had informed his friends, that he was possessed of papers, that would set the late mi∣nister, the earl of B. and his arbitrary principles, in the most odious light; and he had even the weakness to exact from a person he had no great knowledge of, but who attended him in his dying hours, a promise that those papers should be pub∣lished after his death. The report of this spread abroad, the expectations of the publick were raised, and even an impeachment was talked of against the accused nobleman. The papers were published with a most exaggerated character of Mr. Legge, extolling him as the greatest minister, the finest gentleman, and one of the best men that this country or age had produced. The whole of this formidable charge proved to be a desire which his present m—, very possibly by lord B's in∣fluence, had, that Sir Simeon Stuart should be chosen to represent the county of Southampton, for which Mr. Legge had declared himself a can∣didate. An invasion at that time was threatened from France, and as that county may be consider∣ed as a maritime province of England, lord B. thought it neither decent nor proper, that it should be involved or divided in a parliamentary bustle at so critical a juncture; and he therefore prevailed with Mr. Legge's antagonist to drop his preten∣sions.
<PB N="432" REF="4400"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> Mr. Legge had notice of this from Mr. Martin, then secretary of the Treasury, at lord B's request; but he treated it as an idle compliment, because his interest in the county was vastly supe∣rior to that of his rival, who was then only Mr. Stuart. In the year 1769, when the general elec∣tion took place, the prince of Wales sent Mr. Legge a message, expressing his desire that he would drop all thoughts of standing for that county, and support the nomination of his royal highness in favour of the marquis of Carnarvon and Mr. Stuart. Mr. Legge pretended that he was too far engaged with the gentlemen of the county to retract, and declared his intentions to stand, which Mr. Martin, by lord B.'s desire, beg∣ged him to consider of before he went too far in opposing the inclinations of his royal highness.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and his difference with lord B.</NOTE> This intimation galled Mr. Legge so much, that from thenceforth he considered lord B. as the pernicious adviser of the prince of Wales; and on the death of his late majesty he lost his employ∣ment as chancellor of the Exchequer. Having thus given a faithful account from the papers them∣selves of this long expected charge, the reader can scarcely expect that we should dwell upon its futi∣lity, or take great pains to prove that it blasted the hopes of the party when it appeared in public. It was known that lord B. even after the general elec∣tion, had done services to Mr. Legge, and had interested himself in making up differences be∣tween him and other considerable personages in the ministry, who began to think him not to be of that importance which he assumed.</P>

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> An affair of much greater consequence to the nation than debates among statesmen at this time<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the dis∣covery of the longi∣tude.</NOTE> engaged the public attention, and this regarded the discovery of the longitude, which the parliament of England had long and generously patronized. In December 1763, Mr. John Harrison, who had for several years applied himself to that momentous study, had completed what he called a Time-keeper, and he wrote a circular invitation to twelve noblemen and gentlemen, of indisputable integrity and abilities, to meet daily at his house to examine the exactitude of this time-keeper, as it was soon to be sent to America for trial of the longitude. They accordingly agreed to compare it every day with a regulator, fixed in the same house, which, for thirty years together, had seldom been known to vary from the rate of mean solar time more than about one second in a month; and that the going of the said regulator itself should likewise be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ascer∣tained by means of an accurate instrument, also in the house, for observing the sun's transit over the meridian, as often as the weather would permit. After each comparison, both the time-keeper and regulator were sealed up by the company, and the result was, that upon the last comparison, the time-keeper was found in eight days to have gain∣ed upon the regulator, nine seconds and six-tenths of a second. To rectify those small inequalities arising from the various temperature of the air, Mr. Harrison took his time-keeper asunder, but, be∣fore he could execute his purpose, the Tartar man of war was ordered to take his son with it on board, that he might proceed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the

<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764</NOTE> ultimate trial for the longitude, which the son, Mr. William Harrison, accordingly did, after he had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovery of the longi∣tude.</NOTE> compared the time-keeper with a noted regulator. The ship sailed from Spithead, March the 28th, and met with very rough weather, especially in the Bay of Biscay, but arrived at Barbadoes on the 13th of May following. Mr. Harrison, during the course of the voyage, declared to a most surprizing degree of certainty, how far the ship was from that island. Mr. Harrison, on the 4th of June, set out in another ship from Barbadoes; and, on his re∣turn, was equally exact in his calculations, as ap∣peared by proper certificates. Upon his arrival in England a board of longitude was held, and the commissioners were so well satisfied with Mr. Har∣rison's discovery, that they gave him an immediate order to be paid one thousand pounds. But how far the commissioners may think him entitled to the whole of the premium, without any farther trial and discovery, is yet unknown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Account of the so∣ciety for encou∣raging arts, ma∣nufac∣tures, and com∣merce.</NOTE> The spirit of national improvement was not con∣fined to the parliament or public bodies, for the patriotic society for encouragement of arts and manufactures exerted themselves in a most amaz∣ing manner during the course of this year. From the first time of its institution in the year 1755 the members had expended near twenty thousand pounds premiums, for the advancement of the arts and useful discoveries. The supplying London with fish at a small expence had been for some years one of their main objects, and they had so good opinion of the capacity and integrity of Mr. Blake, one of their members, for managing that impor∣tant
<PB N="435" REF="4430"/>
matter, that they lodged two thousand pounds<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> in hand, to be by him discretionally employed in compleating his scheme, and lent him besides, upon his own security, one thousand five hun∣dred pounds; while the parliament advanced him two thousand five hundred pounds more on the same account. His scheme was, for some time, car∣ried with great vigour into execution, by construct∣ing machines for bringing fish to the London markets by land-carriage; a method which, tho' very expensive, answered so well at first, that in Fe∣bruary the society almost unanimously released him from his obligation, for repaying one thousand five hundred pounds that had been advanced him. He was not equally fortunate in his prosecution of this laudable project, occasioned, as was alledged by the combinations of the fish-mongers, who un∣dersold him; but the experiments he made were undoubtedly of infinite service to the public, and proved how practicable it is to supply the citizens of London with fish, at easier rates than they have heretofore been ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustomed to pay. The same patriot spirit discovered itself in all other proceed∣ings of the society, tho' destitute of any legal constitution. Upon the death of lord Folkstone, lord Romney was elected its president; and the num∣ber of subscribing members, (each paying at least two guineas a year) in one thousand seven hundred and sixty-four, exceeded two thousand five hun∣dred. The generous provision made by the an∣nual contributions, left no part of their plan un∣provided for; and their improvements extended to almost every branch of arts, manufactures, and

journeymen silk-weavers residing in Spitalfields<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> repaired to his majesty's palace, where they pre∣sented<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distresses of the Spital∣fields weavers.</NOTE> a petition representing the miserable condi∣tion themselves and their families were reduced to by the clandestine importation of French silks. The petitioners were considerable, not only by their numbers but their utillity; and his majesty, with the greatest affability and condescension, gave them for answer, that an affair of such consequence to the kingdom should be properly laid before the parliament, and that they might depend on his care and protection. About the same time a number of French patterns for silks were said to be handed about by the French emissaries to the London mer∣cers; and it was given out, that the latter were supplied with any pattern and to any quantity of silk manufactured in France. It does not appear<NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of the Spi∣talfields weavers.</NOTE> that those reports had really any other foundation, than that of exciting the charity of the public, which flowed in for the relief of the sufferers in plentiful streams, and was distributed to them with the ut∣most justice and impartiality. It was thought, with great justice, by many of the most judicious citi∣zens, that those distributions, however well meant, were far from answering the purposes of the cha∣rity, as it rather encouraged idleness than pro∣moted industry; and that the money might have been far better employed, if it had been be∣stowed in purchasing materials for giving work to those who were really disposed to earn their liveli∣hood in their calling. It was alledged, that a few experiments of this kind would excite in the public that noble spirit of well judged charity, which con∣sists
<PB N="438" REF="4460"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> in giving employment to industry rather than relief to idleness; and the space of a few weeks confirmed the truth of those observations. The money, during that time, was spent, and far from re∣lieving the sufferers, it served only to confirm them in their habits of indolence. The news-papers of every week were filled with accounts of their dis∣tres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and of their tumultuous applications for re∣lief, which was impossible at that time to be given them, but from private persons, whose charity be∣gan now to be exhausted, in propo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion as the clamour encreased.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">History of the rise,</NOTE> About the 14th of May the meetings of those journeymen weavers, on account of a bill, which they thought tended to their relief, being thrown out of the house of peers, began to be more nu∣merous than was consistent with the peace of civil government, and their resentment was particularly pointed at the duke of B. who, as they had been in∣formed, was a principal opposer of the bill. A num∣ber of those insurgents were so ill advised as to assemble tog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther; and, being accompanied with their wives and children, and preceded by a bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck flag as an emblem of their distrest circum∣stances, went up to St. James's to represent once more to his majesty, the hardships they suffered for want of work on occasion of the importation of French and other silks. Though both the king and the queen had gone to Richmond before they arrived at St. James's, yet so earnest were they in their soli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation, that they even followed their majesti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to those retreats which ought to be sacred from intr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion and importunity; and finding means

to introduce their grievances to the royal ear, a lord<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> in waiting from his majesty informed them, in his name, that he would do whatever lay in his power for their relief.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">progress,</NOTE> The appearance of this numerous body was so formidable to the peace of the city of London, that the lord-mayor and court of aldermen ordered the beadles of the several wards to give notice to the constables in every parish, to repair immediately to their respective watch-houses, with assistance, and there to remain till farther orders, to prevent any riots that might happen. Though the king had by this time passed a bill for laying several additional duties on the importation of wrought silks and velvets, and to encourage the silk manufacture of this kingdom, and to prevent any combinations of workmen; yet this was far from pacifying the insurgents. On the 16th of May another great body went to St. James's, where they repeated their former requests, and receiving a favourable answer, they retired to the Green-Park, where they drew round a person, one Jones, who, if not their leader, had obtained their trust and confidence, and on him they seemed to depend for advice. As their numbers now, upon the whole, were said to amount to above fifteen thousand, the moderation of Jones was very exemplary. He advised them to disperse, and dutifully to wait the result of what his majesty and the parliament intended in their favour; with which they seemed to be satisfied. It soon appeared that a number of necessitous and riotous people, who were no weavers, but pretended to be such, had mingled in the mob. There is scarcely in history
<PB N="440" REF="4480"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> an instance of so numerous a body of people, who were really distrest in their circumstances and prest with hunger, behaving with so great a deference and resignation to the will of their superiors, as those poor people did. Several of the nobility and other persons of distinction, as they passed along, heard their complaints, and testified their compassion for their sufferings, with which they seemed to be satis∣fied, till such of their number as really had bad designs, found means to inflame them against the noble duke above-mentioned; then, instead of re∣turning to their respective habitations, they assem∣bled in Bloomsbury-square, where the decency they had hitherto observed forsook them, and they be∣haved in a most riotous and audacious manner. On the 17th of the same month, their numbers, by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their riots.</NOTE> public papers, were supposed to be fifty thousand; and after being mustered, and receiving their or∣ders from officers of their own chusing, they pro∣ceeded to Westminster in three bodies. One went over London-bridge to Westminster by St. George's-fields; another by Holborn and Covent∣garden, and the third along Ludgate-hill and the Strand. When the junction of those three bo∣dies was formed in Old and New Palace▪yard and the neighbourhood, the avenues to both houses of parliament were so crowded, that it was with the utmost difficulty the members could pass to their respective assemblies. Nothing was wanting that could inspire them with compassion for the petitio∣ners, at they termed themselves. Flags of various colours, borne by women, composed of French manufactures, were displayed, and the mercers in
<PB N="441" REF="4490"/>
general were loaded with the most bitter reproaches<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> for disconraging those of England. The men wore red cockades and shreds of silk in their hats, and they stopt the carriages of the members as they were endeavouring to pass along, praying them to take pity on the poor weavers; but they behaved in all other respects with the utmost regularity, and even checked such of their own number as seemed disposed to be riotous.</P>
<P>But though this alarming body of insurgents continued still to discover no disposition to in∣sult government, yet, at the same time, their assembling, in the manner they did, required the strictest attention. The first troop of horse-guards, with a party of horse▪grenadiers and three companies of the foot-guards, all under arms, and headed by their proper officers, were ordered from the parade to Old Palace-yard, where they were drawn up in two lines before Westminster-hall, to clear the passage for the members to get to the house. In the mean time, the justices of the peace for Westminster had attended at the New Guildhall; at which place there was also a con∣ference between the chieftains of the weavers, to the number of about four hundred, their masters, and the mercers, when it was agreed by the latter immediately to recall all their contracts for foreign goods, and to set the journeymen instantly to work. This expedient in all probability would have quieted them, had not some of their false brethren suggested, while they were upon their return home, that they were insecure in their dependence upon promises; and that upon application they might be joined by
<PB N="442" REF="4500"/>

Upon which a body of them went to Bloomsbury▪square, where they pulled down the stone posts and part of the wall before the duke of Bedford's house, with the rails in the road to Fig-lane, besides ploughing up the ground in the middle of the square, and doing other damage. Those outrages being apprehended there, a party of the horse-guards were added to the foot, which had been placed there the night before: but the mob were so unruly, that they tore up the pavement to sup∣ply them with stones to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt the guards; in con∣sequence of which, much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was done, many of the sold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery were cut and wonnded, and several of the people trampled down by the horses.

In consequence of this outrage, between seven and eight o'clock, the lord mayor, attended by the sheriffs, recorder, city-marshal, and sword-bearer, with a number of peace-officers, repaired to the spot; but his lord∣ship was obliged to leave his coach in St. Paul's Church-yard, from whence he proceeded on foot to the above-mentioned mercer's shop, where the recorder told the populace, that unless they dis∣persed, the riot-act should be read. The lord-mayor being still unable to pass with his state-coach, remained in the neighbourhood to give occasional orders; and a strong party of horse,
<PB N="443" REF="4510"/>
and another of foot being sent for, the night<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> passed without any farther disorder. A court of aldermen had previously met the evening before, to consult on proper methods for preventing the ill consequences that might arise from so large a body of people daily assembling; a party of the guards from the Tower did duty all Thursday night in Moorfields; another party had been sent for the same night to Spital-fields, on account of the mob breaking the windows there of some master weavers, who were reported to have had French silks in their houses, particularly of one in Prince's-street, whose windows were entirely de∣molished from the top to the bottom.</P>

In a few days, by the management of the magistrates, co∣operating with the assurances of the master wea∣vers, tranquility was restored. One house of the legislature, however, did not think that sufficient satisfaction had been made for the insults which had been done to their members and to government in general; and certain censures were imposed for the too great lenity that had been used in suppressing such daring insults.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="4520"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> During the above insurrection an uncommon fer∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE> prevailed at court, which the necessity of appearing to act with unanimity had long stifled. Those who formed the minority in parliament, had originally accu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the acting ministers of being no better than substitutes to the earl of B. They en∣deavoured to wipe off the aspersion, by assuming every mark of independency upon his lordship, who seemed to have entirely resigned himself to the duties of a private life, and to be quite uncon∣nected with public business. This inoffensive con∣duct, however, was far from protecting his charac∣ter from the shafts of envy and malevolence, and every day produced from the press fresh informa∣tions to the public, that he still had underhand the direction of all the great movements of state, but without any particular instance of his influence be∣ing specified, otherwise than by surmize and suspi∣cion. An alarming consideration cleared up the gloom that was the necessary consequence of that want of confidence, which was visible through many of the departments of publick business. Towards the spring of the year his majesty was attacked with an illness, which tho' not dangerous, filled the public with prodigious apprehensions, which perhaps were encreased by the very means made use of to save appearances; as nothing of certainty could be gathered from the public papers, but that<NOTE PLACE="marg">Speech of the king concern∣ing a re∣gency.</NOTE> the state of his health was precarious. Upon his recovery on the 22d of April he went in state to the House of Peers, where, after giving his assent to the bills that were ready, he made a speech to both houses of parliament, in which he told them,
<PB N="445" REF="4530"/>
that the tender concern he felt for his faithful<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> subjects, made him anxious to provide for every possible event, which might affect their happiness and security. That his late indisposition, though not attended with danger, had led him to consider the situation in which his kingdoms and his fa∣mily might be left, if it should please God to put a period to his life whilst his successor was of tender years. That the high importance of this subject to the public safety, good order, and tranquility; the paternal affection which he bore to his chil∣dren and to all his people, and his earnest desire, that every precaution should be taken, which might tend to preserve the constitution of Great Britain undisturbed, and the dignity of its crown unimpaired, had determined him to lay this weighty business before his parliament; and as his health, by the blessing of God, was now restored, he took the earliest opportunity of meeting them, and re∣commending to their most serious deliberation, the making such provision as would be necessary, in case any of his children should succeed to his throne before they should respectively attain the age of eighteen years. That to this end he proposed to their consideration, whether under the present cir∣cumstances, it would not be expedient to vest in him the power of appointing, from time to time, by instrument in writing, under his sign manual, either the queen, or any other person of his royal family usually residing in Great Britain, to be the guardian of the person of such successor, and the regent of these kingdoms, until such successor shall attain the age of eighteen years, subject to the like

Such guardian is to have the case and management of the tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the person of such minor, and to execute the office of regent of the kingdom; and to be either the queen or the princess dowager or Wales, or one of the de∣scendants of the late king, usually residing in Great Britain.</P>
<P>The insertion of the name of the princess dow∣ager of Wales in this regency bill, as it was called, was particularly agreeable to the public, which, upon this occasion, discovered the most grateful sense of the high obligations the nation was under to her royal highness.</P>
<P>The council of regency for assisting the regent, is to consist of their royal highness Edward-Au∣gustus,
<PB N="447" REF="4550"/>
duke of York and Albany, William-Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, prince Henry-Frederick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Members o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the council of regency.</NOTE> and prince Frederick-William; and his royal highness his majesty's uncle, William▪Au∣gustus, duke of Cumberland, (the said prince Henry-Frederic and prince Frederic-William, to be members of the said council of regency, when they shall respectively attain the age of twenty▪one years, and not sooner) and also of the persons and officers following, viz. the archbishop of Canterbury for the time being; the lord chancel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or, or lord keeper, or the first commissioner named in any commission for the custody of the great seal of Great Britain for the time being; the lord treasurer of Great Britain, or the first commissioner in that of∣fice for the time being; the lord president of the council for the time being; the lord privy-seal for the time being; the lord high admiral of Great Britain, or the first commissioner for executing that office; the two principal secretaries of state for the time being; and the lord chief justice of the court of King's bench, or Queen's-bench for the time being. But if any of the king's bro∣ther's or his uncle shall die, during his majesty's reign, or shall be nominated regent on his demise, his majesty, by three instruments, under his sign manual, sealed and deposited as aforesaid, and re∣vocable at pleasure, may appoint some other per∣son to be of the council; and such instruments of nomination are to be produced unopened to the privy-council.</P>
<P>Members, who are appointed of the council, in vir∣tue of their dignity and office, are to be no longer of
<PB N="448" REF="4560"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> the council than they continue in such dignity or of∣fice. Great officers of state appointed of the council, are to continue in their offices in case of the descent of the crown during such minority, for six months after, unless removed by consent of the majority of the council; or upon an address of both houses of parliament. The archbishop of Canterbury and lord chief justice of the King's bench, may be re∣moved in like manner from the council; as also any other members who are not constituted such in vir∣tue of their dignities or offices. Vacancies in the council, by removal, death, or resignation, or by succeeding to the office of regent, or by death of the king's younger brothers, being under age, are to be filled up within two months by the regent and council. Nothing herein contained shall take away the right of the privy council; but the regent is impowered to summon and hold the same as usual; and members of the regency may be also of the privy council.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Case of a minor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.</NOTE> Upon the descent of the crown to a minor, the parliament then in being is to continue for three years, unless such successor shall be sooner of age, or such parliament be dissolved by the regent with consent of the council; but if there shall be no parliament then in being, which shall have met and sat, the preceding parliament is to convene and sit for three years. In cases of an equality of voices in the council, the regent is to decide. Where the consent of a majority, or one half part of the council, is made necessary to the validity of any act, the members consenting thereto, are to sign the same in the council-books. The
<PB N="449" REF="4570"/>
clerk of the council is to be appointed by the re∣gent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1765.</NOTE> and take an oath of office. All commissions, letters patent, orders, &amp;c. to set aside, or change the orders of government settled by this act, dur∣ing the minority of the successor, are declared void; and the persons concerned therein incur pe∣nalties of premunire, inflicted by the statute of pre∣munire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conclu∣sion.</NOTE> Such is the substance of this important act, the account of which we have anticipated a few months, on account of the great consequences with which it was attended; for the moment they passed, the public report was, that the ministry was unhinged. It is certain that some changes took place, but upon what principles they were effected, or what farther alterations may be still necessary for establishing the fabric of government upon a solid and a permanent plan, is yet unknown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">July 1▪ 1765.</NOTE> We have, according to the best of our abilities, exhibited in this Continuation a faithful history of the reign of George the Third to the beginning of the year 1765, and after the most attentive re∣view, we can find no reason for altering the repre∣sentation of any fact we have published. It never has been disputed, that at the time of his present majesty's accession to the throne, this kingdom was unable to support either with men or money the continuance of the war, however flattering the pros∣pect of its success might be. The countries in which it must have been carried on, are the most fatal to British constitutions of any in the globe; and an immediate supply of above forty thousand men, for sea and land forces, was required, at a
<PB N="450" REF="4580"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. 1764.</NOTE> time when the country was exhausted of inhabi∣tants, its fields uncultivated, its manufactures at a stand; and when it was found absolutely imprac∣ticable to raise five thousand recruits more for fleet or army. The national debt was swelled to the in∣credible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um of almost a hundred and thirty mil∣lion; and twenty millions more, with a most preca∣rious prospect of success, must have been the ex∣pence of another campaign. Thus every year would have swelled a debt, which the most sanguine ex∣pectation could not have found the means of dis∣charging, even by the most glorious conquests.</P>
<P>We have, we hope, with candour, stated the his∣tory of the cyder act, which was necessary for pay∣ing off part of that great sum, and given such an account of the case of general warrants, which is one of the great charges against his majesty's go∣vernment, as we flatter ourselves is not to be con∣verted by the most virulent enemy of the admini∣stration. With regard to foreign affairs, all the alle∣gations brought against the management of them, are comprehended under the head of the undis∣charged Canada bills and the Manilla ransom, both which articles are yet unadjusted. In all other re∣spects, the two great powers with whom we were at war, have fulfilled the articles of the general peace with a good faith and punctuality, of which we have few or no examples in English history.</P>
