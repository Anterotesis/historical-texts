<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The INDIAN and ORIENTAL ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>THESE islands consist of 1. The Ladrones. 2. The Japan Islands. 3. The Philippine Islands. 4. The Moluccas and Amboyna. 5. The Banda Islands. 6. The Islands of Celebes, Gilolo, Ceram, &amp;c. which surround the Moluccas and Banda Islands. 7. The Sunda Islands, as Bor∣neo, Sumatra and Java, and those that lie to the eastward of Java, Bally, Lomboe, Timor, &amp;c. 8. The Maldiva Islands. 9. The Nicobar Islands. 10. The Andeman Islands. And, 11. The Island of Ceylon.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LADRONES or MARIAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands, about twelve in number, are situ∣ated in the Pacific Ocean, in the 140°. of east
<PB N="4" REF="30"/>
longitude, and between the 12th and 24th degree of north latitude. Guam, the largest, is forty miles long, and twelve broad. The Spaniards have a fort, and a small garrison of thirty or forty men in the chief town of the same name; and most of their ships touch there in their voyage from Aca∣pulco in Mexico, to Manilla. These islands were first discovered by Magellan, in his voyage to the Spice Islands, through the South-Sea, or Pacific Ocean, in 1521. They are remarkable for pro∣ducing a fruit as big as a foot-ball, which yields a soft pulp, like the crumb of a white loaf; and therefore called bread-fruit, by seamen. Their swift-sailing sloops, called proas, which generally go twenty-four miles in an hour, is another peculi∣arity: the voyage betwixt Guam and Manilla, in the Philippine Islands, being twelve hundred miles, has been performed by them in four days. It was at the little but beautifully romantic island of Tinian, one of these Ladrones, that lord Anson first touched, after passing the Pacific Ocean, in his voyage round the world. He found great re∣freshment in it; the island, though uninhabited, abounding in cattle, fruits, and other necessaries.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The JAPAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands, which form the large and potent empire of that name, are situated on the most east∣ern verge of Asia, and consist of three large, and a number of smaller islands, lying about an hundred leagues eastward of the coasts of China and Korea, and about 130 degrees eastward of London; so that they have sun-rising, noon, &amp;c. about eight hours before us. They extend from the 30th to the 41st degree of latitude, and from the 130th to the 147th of east longitude.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="40"/>
Were South and North Britain divided by an arm of the sea, Japan might be most aptly com∣pared to England, Scotland, and Ireland, with their respective smaller islands, peninsulas, bays, channels, &amp;c. all under the same monarch.</P>
<P>The Europeans call the empire Japan, but the inhabitants Niphon, from the greatest island be∣longing to it, and the Chinese Siphon, probably on account of its eastern situation; these names sig∣nifying, in both languages, the Basis or Foundation of the Sun. It was first discovered by the Portu∣guese, some time betwixt the years 1535 and 1548.</P>
<P>Most of the islands which compose it are sur∣rounded with such high craggy mountains, and such shallow and boisterous seas, that sailing about them is extremely dangerous; and the creeks and bays are choaked up with such rocks, shelves, and sands, that it looks as if Providence had designed it to be a kind of little world by itself. These seas have likewise many dangerous whirlpools, which are very difficult to pass at low water, and will suck in and swallow up the largest vessels, and all that comes within the reach of their vortex, dashing them against the rocks at the bottom; insomuch, that some of them are never seen again, and others thrown upon the surface at some miles distance. Some of these whirlpools also make a noise terrible to hear.</P>
<P>The Chinese pretend, that the Japan Islands were first peopled by themselves; but it is more probable, that the original inhabitants were a mix∣ture of different nations, driven thither by those tempestuous seas, and at different times; and this conjecture is confirmed by the great difference ob∣servable between the present inhabitants, in regard to feature, complexion, shapes, habits, customs, and language, notwithstanding their having been so long united under one monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="50"/>
As these islands lie in the fifth and sixth climates, they would be much hotter in summer than Eng∣land, were not the heats refreshed by the winds, which continually blow from the sea around them, and to which they are much exposed by the height of their situation: this circumstance, however, not only renders their winters excessive cold, but the seasons more inconstant. They have great falls of snow in winter, which are commonly followed by hard frosts. The rains in summer are very vio∣lent, especially in the months of June and July; which, on that account, are called Sat-Suki, or Water-Months. The country is also much sub∣ject to dreadful thunders and lightnings, as well as storms and hurricanes, which frequently do a great deal of damage.</P>
<P>The soil, though naturally barren and moun∣tainous, by the industry of the inhabitants, not on∣ly supplies them with every necessary of life, but also furnishes other countries with them; pro∣ducing, besides corn, the finest and whitest rice, and other grains, with a great variety of fruits, and vast numbers of cattle of all sorts. Besides rice, and a sort of wheat, and barley, with two sorts of beans, they have Indian wheat, millet, and several other kinds, in great abundance. Their seas, lakes, and rivers, abound with fish; and their mountains, woods, and forests, are well stocked with horses, elephants, deer, oxen, buffaloes, sheep, hogs, and other useful animals. Some of their mountains also are enriched with mines of gold, silver, and copper, exquisitely fine, besides tin, lead, iron, and various other minerals and fossils; whilst others abound with several sorts of marble, and precious stones. Of these mountains, some may be justly ranked among the natural rarities of this country; one, in particular, in the great island of Niphon, is of such a prodigious height as to be easily seen
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
forty leagues off at sea, though its distance from the shore is about eighteen. Some authors think, it exceeds the famous Peak of Teneriffe; but it may be rather called a cluster or group of moun∣tains, among which are no less than eight dreadful vulcanoes, burning with incredible fury, and often laying waste the country round about them: but, to make some amends, they afford great variety of medicinal waters, of different degrees of heat; one of these, mentioned by Varenius, is said to be as hot as burning oil, and to scorch and consume every thing thrown into it.</P>
<P>The many brooks and rivers that have their sources among the mountains, form a great num∣ber of delightful cascades, as well as some dread∣ful cataracts. Among the great variety of trees in the forests here, the cedars exceed all of that kind through India, for streightness, height, and beauty. They abound in most of the islands, espe∣cially the three largest.</P>
<P>Their seas, besides fish, furnish them with great quantities of red and white coral, and some pearls of great value, besides a variety of sea-plants and shells; which last are not inferior to those that are brought from Amboyna, the Molucca, and other Eastern islands.</P>
<P>The vast quantity of sulphur, with which most of the Japan islands abound, makes them subject to frequent and dreadful earthquakes. The inhabi∣tants are so accustomed to them, that they are scarcely alarmed at any, unless they chance to be very ter∣rible indeed, and lay whole towns in ruins, which very often proves the case. On these occasions, they have recourse to extraordinary sacrifices, and acts of worship to their deities or daemons, ac∣cording to the different notions of each sect, and sometimes even proceed to offer human victims; but, in this case, they only take some of the vilest
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
and most abandoned fellows they can meet with, because they are only sacrificed to the malevolent deities.</P>
<P>With respect to religion, that of the Japanese is allowed, by all writers, to have been downright heathenism and idolatry, from time immemorial. They do not seem so much as to have any sort of notion of a Supreme Being; but believe the world to have existed from eternity, and that the gods they worship were men, or beings, that lived on earth several thousands of years, and were afterwards, for their piety, mortification, and even by their voluntary death, raised to that height of power and dignity they have ever since enjoyed. They are divided, however, into various sects; probably, according to the various nations that first settled there. One of them is called the fect of Siutto, which is that of their philosophers and moralists, whose professors, like the Chinese lite∣rati, despise all notions of public worship and po∣pular superstition. Every person here is at liberty to chuse what sect pleases him best; no compul∣sion being used by the government, or by the pa∣rents. Most of the sects believe a future state, of bliss or misery; though they are not agreed about the nature and duration of it: the generality, howe∣ver, think that it will consist in a transmigration of the soul from one body to another, more or less excellent and happy, according to their behaviour in their late state; and that this revolution will continue, as well as the world, to eternal ages. All the different sects, or at least the priests and priestesses of them, however divided in other respects, agree in regard∣ing the five following negative precepts, as abso∣lutely binding; viz. 1. Not to kill, nor to eat any thing that is killed; 2. Not to steal; 3. Not to de∣file another man's bed; 4. Not to lye; 5. Not to drink wine. From the example of their two chief
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
deities, Amida and Xaca, the Japanese have a no∣tion of its being such a merritorious thing to dis∣patch one's self, that great numbers of them em∣brace, in the most public manner, a voluntary death; either by drowning, hanging, or flinging themselves down from a precipice, or by poison, dagger, or any other quick riddance. The fol∣lowers of Xaca commonly drown themselves; but those of Amida shut themselves up in some close, confined place, where they have just room to sit, and, being immured on every side, have only a little hole to breathe through, by means of a small cane, and never cease calling on that deity, till they expire.</P>
<P>There is not a country in all the East that abounds more with temples and monasteries than this: not only cities and towns, but plains and mountains, and even deserts, swarm with them; for the priests here, like those of the church of Rome, are either secular or regular. The former live in private houses of their own, allow themselves one or two wives, and live on the income and of∣ferings made to their respective temples and deities, and are at their own liberty as to the practice of ab∣stinence, and other severities: the regulars live in communities, under their respective superiors, and lead more or less recluse and austere lives, according to their sects. Some of the monasteries contain a thou∣sand, or even more of them, who, besides a perpetual celibacy, and other mortifications, are all bound to observe the five rules before mentioned. Both secular and regular are under the government of the dairo, or high-priest, who is the head of all the religions and sects in the empire. Besides the multitude of idols in their temples, there is a great number of others set up in their other public buildings, in their piazzas and markets, streets, and even public roads.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="90"/>
The Japanese have as great variety of festivals, as of sects and deities, which it would therefore be endless to describe: they consist, in general, in the anniversary of their gods, and of their dead rela∣tions.</P>
<P>Christianity, if popery deserves that name, had once made a considerable progress in this country; but, about the year 1022, a dreadful persecution was raised against the missionaries, and all that ad∣hered to them, occasioned partly by the indiscreet zeal of the former, partly by the jealousy of the unconverted nobles, but especially of the Japanese priests, who could not, without the greatest envy and regret, behold their old religion, with all its powerful attractives of profit, popular esteem, and respect daily losing ground; but, more particu∣larly, by the policy and treachery of the Dutch, who found effectual means to undermine them. All the Christian converts were put to death; and the Europeans, except the Dutch, forbid to come within the Japanese dominions, under the severest penalties.</P>
<P>With respect to the government of these islands, it is, and has been for a long time, monarchical; though formerly it seems to have been split into a great number of petty kingdoms, which were, at length, all swallowed by one. The imperial dig∣nity had been enjoyed, for a considerable time be∣fore the year 1500, by a regular succession of princes, under the title of dairos, a name supposed to have been derived from Dairo, the head of that family. Soon after that epoch, such a dreadful civil war broke out, and lasted so many years, that the empire was quite ruined. During these distractions and confusions, a common soldier, by name Tayc∣koy, a person of obscure birth, but of an enter∣prizing genius, found means to raise himself to the imperial dignity; having, in little more than three
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
years time, by an uncommon share of good fortune and success, subdued all his competitors and op∣ponents, and reduced all their cities and castles. The dairo, not being in a condition to obstruct or put a stop to his progress, was forced to submit to his terms; and might perhaps have been condemn∣ed to much harder, had not Tayckoy been appre∣hensive lest his soldiers, who still revered their an∣tient natural monarch, should have revolted in his favour. To prevent this, he granted him the su∣preme power in all religious matters, with great privileges, honours, and revenues annexed to it; whilst himself remained invested with the whole ci∣vil and military power, and was acknowledged and proclaimed king of Japan. This great revolution happened in 1517, and Tayckoy reigned several years with great wisdom and tranquillity; during which, he made many wholesome laws and regu∣lations, which still subsist, and are much admired to this day. At his death, he left the crown to his son Tayckossamma, then a minor; but the treache∣rous prince under whose guardianship he was left, deprived him of his life, before he came of age. By this murder, the crown passed to the family of Jejassama, in which it still continues. Tayckoy and his successors have contented themselves with the title of cubo, which, under the dairos, was that of prime minister, whose office is now sup∣pressed; so that the cubo, in all secular concerns, is quite as absolute and despotic, and has as extensive a power over the lives and fortunes of all his sub∣jects, from the petty kings down to the lowest per∣sons, as ever the dairos had. The dairo resides constantly at Meaco, and the cubo at Jedo.</P>
<P>The Japanese traffic with the Chinese, Koreans, and people of Jetzo; but, of the European nations, the Dutch alone are suffered to trade with them, hav∣ing declared, as some say, after the expulsion of the
<PB N="12" REF="110"/>
Portuguese, that they were no Christians; but more probably on the merit of supplanting, and assisting in expelling the Portuguese: for it is im∣possible that the Japanese can be ignorant that the Dutch profess Christianity, as they trade to China; and we find the Japanese use as much cau∣tion in their commerce with the Dutch, as if they were really Christians:</P>
<P>At the season that the Dutch fleet is expected, the governor of Nangasaque places centinels on the hills to give notice of the approach of any ships. When they appear, a boat is sent off to every-ship, with a waiter or officer, and as soon as the ships come to an anchor, an express is imme∣ately dispatched to court, before whose return, the Dutch may not dispose of any thing. In the mean time the particulars of every ship's cargo are taken, with the name, age, stature, and office of every man on board, which is translated and printed in the Japanese language. When the express is re∣turned, the ships crew are permitted to come on shore, and are all mustered before a Japanese com∣missary; and every person is called over aloud, and made to give an account of his age, quality and office, to see if it agrees with the particulars given in by the Dutch; after this examination they are sent on board again, and the sails of the ship, with the guns, arms, ammunition and helm, are brought on shore, and the hatches sealed down by a Japanese officer; nor can they be opened, whatever the ships crew may want, without a per∣mission from the governor, who always sends a person to see what is taken out, and seal them down again; nor dare the Dutch sailors light a candle, or make any fire on board their ships, any more than on shore. The ships are allowed no communication with one another; nor is any of∣ficer or sailor suffered to go on shore, except the
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
persons who are appointed to carry the company's present to the king at Jedo or Yeddo. His ma∣jesty having accepted the present, and prepared another for the company, the Dutch officer is con∣veyed to Nangasaque under a strong guard as he came. This journey, and the transacting their mercantile affairs, usually take up about three months and a half.</P>
<P>The Dutch, who attend the king on this occa∣sion, approach him on their knees, with their hands joined together, and carried to their fore∣heads, as the Japanese governors and ministers also do.</P>
<P>While the Dutch ships lie in the road, none of the Japanese are allowed to go on board them to trade with the sailors; and those that carry pro∣visions on board, are not suffered to take any mo∣ney for them, till the permission to trade comes from court, and then they deliver in their accounts and are paid. After this the Japanese permit six persons from every vessel to come on shore, and buy and sell for themselves, and stay four days, either in Disnia, or in the city, as they see fit; when these six men return on board, six others are allowed to go on shore, and traffic in the like man∣ner, and so on.</P>
<P>The goods are generally paid in bullion, or pieces of silver of ten or five crowns value, or smaller pieces by weight; for they have no coin, except some little pieces of copper.</P>
<P>After six weeks free trade, there is no further communication allowed of between the city of Nangasaque, and the Dutch in the island of Disnia, or with the shipping, whereupon the fleet pre∣pares to return, and the factory in Disnia are con∣fined to their little island again, 'till the season of the year for traffic returns.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="130"/>
With respect to the character of the Japanese, they are generally very active, and of a quick ap∣prehension and good understanding, modest, pa∣tient, and courteous, and excelling all the Orientals in docility. They are so just in their dealings, that one may absolutely depend on their word; and, contrary to the Chinese, disdain to take the least ad∣vantage of those they deal with. They are all very industrious and labourious, and much given to study and reading. They affect a surprising neatness and decency in their eating, drinking, fur∣niture, dress, and conversation, and have an ab∣horrence to intemperance, luxury, and defamation. Drunkenness and gluttony are as much detested by the rich and poor, as cheating and dishonesty. This is the bright side of their character. On the other hand, they are represented as proud, ambiti∣ous, cruel, and uncharitable; and so insensible of the miseries of their fellow-creatures, that they will suffer them to perish, rather than relieve them. They are likewise said to be so passionate and re∣vengeful, that they will make away with them∣selves, if they cannot find an opportunity of re∣venging an affront. They allow not only of po∣lygamy, but also of fornication: but there is still a more heinous and unnatural vice laid to their charge, viz. that of sodomy, which is not only committed with impunity, both by priests and laity, but without either brand or disgrace. In their wars they are very fierce and cruel, seldom giving or asking for quarter; and when a town is taken, they commonly destroy it by fire and sword. Like the Chinese, they are so given to astrology, that they scarce undertake any thing of moment, without consulting some pretender to that art. There is a vast number of universities dispersed all over the empire, in which the bonzas preside, richly endowed, finely situated, and accommodated
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
with all the conveniences of life, as well as with large libraries.</P>
<P>The Japanese laws and punishments are severe beyond all justice, and may be justly said, like those of the Spartan Draco, to be written in blood. They have few, if any, written laws, the emperor's will being the supreme one, and next to it that of the kings and princes in their respective dominions. The very lords of every district, and even the heads of every family, have power of life and death over all that are under them, and try and condemn them, according to their will. There is scarcely any crime so small, that is not punished with death, except the offender be a petty king or prince, and even these are not always exempted. Every petty larceny, insult, detraction, cheating of any kind, even at play, a lie or prevarication be∣fore a magistrate, are all capital, as well as the more heinous crimes of treason, murder, parricide, incest, rape, adultery. Their most common way of putting criminals to death, is by crucifixion with their heads downwards, boiling in oil, tearing them in pieces by horses, or cutting them in pieces by the hangman. For the highest crimes, not only the criminal, but his parents also, brothers, and even children, are all put to death. The Japanese have but very little skill in physic and surgery. In the cure of diseases they depend much on their medicinal waters, and on certain roots and plants, particularly the root ginseng, brought from China. The operation of blood∣letting is performed by pricking the belly with a fine needle, made either of gold or silver. By this acupuncture they not only assuage, but effec∣tually cure an endemic colickly disorder common among them, and called shenki. The other diseases to which they are most liable, are the dropsy, diarrhaea,
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
small-pox, bloody flux; but the gout, stone, and gravel, are hardly known among them.</P>
<P>The Japanese are much addicted to poetry, music, and painting; the first is said to be grand as to the style and imagery, loftiness and cadence; but, like that of the Chinese, is not easily understood, or relished by the Europeans. The same may be said of their music, both vocal and instrumental, the best of which, of either kind, would hardly be tolerable to a nice European car. They are better painters than the Chinese, but much inferior to the Europeans; most of their performances in that kind, are either in water∣colours on paper, fine leather, &amp;c. or in their ja∣paning, and fine porcelain-ware. What is most to be admired in their paintings, is the singular beauty of the colours, in many of which they greatly exceed us.</P>
<P>They pretend, like the Chinese, to have been the inventers of printing from time immemorial; and their method is the same with theirs on wooden blocks; but they exceed them in the neatness of cutting them, as well as in the goodness of their ink and paper. They likewise lay claim to the in∣vention of gunpowder, are vastly superior to the Chinese in the use of all sorts of fire-arms, espe∣cially of artillery, as well as the curiousness of their fireworks.</P>
<P>Their manner of writing is much the same as that of the Chinese, viz. in columns from top to bottom, and the columns beginning at the right, and end∣ing at the left hand. Their characters were also originally the same, but now differ considerably.</P>
<P>Their language hath some affinity with the Chinese, tho' it appears from its various dialects to have been a kind of compound of that and other languages, derived from the various nations that first peopled those islands. It is not only very
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>
regular, polite, elegant, and copious, and abounds with a great variety of synonima, adapted to the nature of the subject they are upon, whether sub∣lime, familiar, or low; and to the quality, age and sex, both of the speaker and persons spoken to.</P>
<P>The Japanese are commonly very ingenious in most handicraft trades; and excel even the Chinese in several manufactures, particularly in the beauty, goodness, and variety of their silks, cottons, and other stuffs, and in their japan and porcelain wares. No eastern nation comes up to them in the temper∣ing and fabricating of scymitars, swords, muskets, and other such weapons.</P>
<P>The Japanese architecture is much in the same taste and style as that of the Chinese, especially as to their temples, palaces, and other public build∣ings; but in private ones they affect more plain∣ness and neatness than show: these last being mostly built of wood, make their cities exceeding∣ly liable to conflagrations, which, wherever they happen, generally reduce the greatest part of them to ashes, they having neither engines, nor any other method of stopping the progress of the flames. The gardens about their houses are a∣dorned with a variety of flowers, trees, verdure, baths, terraces and other embellishments. The furniture and decorations of the houses of persons of distinction, consist in japan-work of various colours, curious paintings, beds, couches, screens, cabinets, tables, a variety of porcelain jars, vases, tea-equipage, and other vessels and figures, together with swords, guns, scymitars, and other arms. Their retinues are more or less numerous and splen∣did according to their rank; but there are few of the lords who have less than fifty or sixty men richly clad and armed, some on foot, but most on horseback. As for their petty kings and princes,
<PB N="18" REF="170"/>
they are seldom seen without two or three hun∣dred at least, when they either wait on the em∣peror, which is one half of the year, or attend him abroad. The Japanese dress is much like that of the Chinese, only somewhat more elegant and neat, and most commonly of silk or cotton. They wear nothing on their heads, either winter or sum∣mer, tho' they shave themselves close all over, ex∣cept one lock, which is left hanging on the top by way of ornament; but to guard themselves from sun or rain, they always carry an umbrella in one hand; and, if rich enough, have them held over their heads by a servant. The poorer sort have instead of that, either a fan or short screen. The women of fashion, especially the young ones, adorn themselves with flowers, feathers, pearls, &amp;c. but are seldom seen abroad, or even at home, to any but those of the family, without a veil.</P>
<P>The proper colour here for festivals is black, for mourning white. Instead of rising at the approach of a superior, they set themselves down, and in∣stead of bowing or prostrating, when they salute, they stand upright. They chuse to have their teeth and nails of a shining black, and to let the latter grow to an excessive length. The chief food of the Japanese is rice, pulse, fruits, roots, herbs, eating very little flesh, and that only of such beasts as they take in hunting. Instead of knives, forks, and spoons, they make use of the same sorts of small sticks as the Chinese. Their common drink is either water or tea; but they have other liquors, some distilled from rice or wheat, others made of their grains, boiled with sugar or honey, or of fruits, or tapped from the palm, birch, and other trees.</P>
<P>After marriage, the wife is consigned to her own apartment, from whence she hardly ever stirs, except once a year to the funeral rites of her family;
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
nor is she permitted to see any man, except per∣haps some very near relation, and that as seldom as can be. The wives, as well as in China, and other parts of the East, bring no portion with them, but are rather bought by the husband of their parents and relations. The bridegroom most commonly sees his bride for the first time, upon her being brought to his house from the place of the nuptial ceremony: for in the temple where it is performed she is covered over with a veil, which reaches from the head to the feet. A hus∣band can put his wives to a more or less severe death, if they give him the least cause of jealousy, by being seen barely to converse with another man, or suffering any of them to come into their apart∣ment.</P>
<P>The Japanese, both poor and rich, make an annual procession to the sepulchres of their dead relations, with songs and music, carrying money, victuals, cloathing, &amp;c. as presents to relieve their various wants in the other world.</P>
<P>When a prince or great man dies, there are com∣monly about ten, twenty, or more youths of his houshold, and such as were his greatest favour∣ites, who put themselves to a voluntary death, at the place where the body is buried or burn∣ed: as soon as the funeral pile, consisting of odoriferous woods, gums, spices, oils, and other ingredients is set on fire, the relations and friends of the deceased throw their presents into it, such as cloaths, arms, victuals, money, sweet herbs, flowers, and other things, which they imagine will be of use to him in the other world. Those of the middle or lower rank commonly bury their dead, without any other burning than that of some odoriferous woods, gums, &amp;c. The sepulchres into which the bones and ashes of persons of rank
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
are deposited, are generally very magnificent, and situated at some distance from the towns.</P>
<P>The empire of Japan consists chiefly of the three large islands of Niphon or Hiphon, Ximo, and Xicoco, and the southern parts of the large continent of Jedzo, on the north side of the great island of Niphon.</P>
<P>The island of Niphon lies about thirty leagues east of Korea, extends from 33°. 10′. to 41°. of north latitude, and from 132½. degrees to 147½. east longitude; its length, from east to west, being six hundred and sixty miles; its breadth, from north to south, where broadest, four hundred; but, in other parts, only between an hundred and fifty and two hundred miles; and its circumference fifteen hundred.</P>
<P>The principal cities in the island are Meaco, Jed∣do, Osacca, Gurunga, and Saccai.</P>
<P>Meaco, which was formerly considered as the capital of the whole empire, and is still the resi∣dence of the dairos, stands near the middle of the southern coast. Three rivers meet in the very cen∣tre of the city, where a noble bridge is built over them; and, after a course of about twenty or thir∣ty miles, falls into the bay of Osacca. The dairo's palace is situated on the north side of the city. The number of the inhabitants is said to be near five hundred thousand. Here is a colossus of gilt cop∣per, of such a prodigious size, that being seated in a chair, eighty feet in breadth, and seventy in height, no less than fifteen men can stand on its head. Its thumb is fourteen inches in circum∣ference, and the rest proportionble; being one of the principal idols of this island. This city is the grand storehouse of all the manufactures of Ja∣pan, of all foreign and home merchandize, and the principal seat of their commerce. Here, as in most other trading cities of the East, every trade
<PB N="21" REF="200"/>
hath its own particular ward or quarter; every one under their proper officers and inspectors.</P>
<P>Jeddo, Jedo, or Yeddo, the other metropolis of Japan, is situated on the river Tonkag, at the bot∣tom of a large bay, but so shallow as to admit of no ships of any burthen coming up to the city. It is, in all other respects, the most considerable city in Japan; not only for its riches and vast com∣merce, but for its largeness and populousness, on account of the many princes, lords, and grandees, with their numerous trains and families, attending the court of the cubo, who resides here, in a palace between eleven and twelve miles in circuit. What a numerous court and retinue the emperors must constantly have in this capital, besides their guards and officers, which amount to five or six thousand men, may be guessed at by the following particulars: 1. That all the princes of the empire, whether tributary or subject, and all the grandees, nobles, governors, &amp;c. are obliged to attend so many months in the year: 2. That the eldest sons of every king, prince, and grandee, are brought up there, under the emperor's eye, and must reside, until he dismisses, or raises them to some post: 3. That their wives and children are obliged to live there all the year round, to be a kind of host∣ages; except the emperor gives them leave to go with their husbands to their own dominions or estates, during the six months in which they are not in waiting. The emperor's army, in time of peace, consists of about an hundred thousand foot, and twenty thousand horse, including his garrisons; but, in time of war, every one of the tributary princes is obliged to furnish a certain quota, which increases the former to near four hundred thousand, and the latter to about forty thousand. Their arms are muskets, bows and arrows scymitars and dagger. Of the immense revenue of this empire, some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li∣mate may be made from the pensions and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="22" REF="210"/>
paid to the governors and other officers, and the em∣peror's own particular expences, which are said alto∣gether to amount to twenty-eight millions sterling. He is, besides, possessed of immense treasures in dia∣monds, pearls, and other precious jewels: to say nothing of the vast quantities of gold, silver, rich furniture, merchandize, and other valuable com∣modities, which are stored up in his treasury and magazines. Jeddo contains an incredible number of stately palaces, temples, monasteries, and other public buildings; but the private are generally low and mean without, though neat and conve∣nient within.</P>
<P>The island of Ximo is computed to be about two hundred and ninety miles in circuit, exclusive of its creeks and bays. It is divided into nine provinces, the capitals of which are Bungo, Fiungo, Vosuma, Saxuma, Fingo, Tsi-cungo, Figen, Chicugen, and Buigen.</P>
<P>In this island also stands Nanghazak, famed for being the only place in the whole Japanese empire where the Dutch are permitted to come and traf∣fic. It stands on the western coast, at the bottom of a deep bay of its name. The haven, which lies north of the town, is long and deep, and seldom without fifty or sixty merchantmen; but the bay is difficult and dangerous, on account of the many shnoals, banks, and rocks in it. The Dutch factory is situated on a point of rock in a small island, or, as Thevenot calls it, a peninsula, named Disnia, or Desima, which is parted from the city only by a river and a wall, being about two miles in compass. Neither the Dutch merchants and sailors during their stay, which is nine months, nor the people of the factory, during the rest of the year, are allowed to stir out of the island, or to converse with any of the natives, but such as are appointed by the gover∣nor, except during the six weeks of open trade,
<PB N="23" REF="220"/>
when the Japanese come into the island, and set up their rich booths, furnished with all manner of mer∣chandize. The commodities exported from hence are rice, silk, cotton, &amp;c. wrought; fine porcelain, and Japan wares; gold and silver, tho' not in such large quantities as formerly; copper, wrought and in bars; iron, steel, and other base, and some artificial metals; variety of rich furs, mostly brought from the Land of Jetzo; tea of all sorts, much finer and better cured than that of China; some sorts of which have such an excellent flavour and taste, that they sell even above the price of gold, weight for weight: besides a great variety of medicinal herbs, roots, woods, gums, &amp;c. which, as well as their tea, are sold genuine, well dried, and pre∣served, and without the least mixture or adultera∣tion, such as are commonly practised in China. To these we may add diamonds, and other precious stones, pearls of exquisite beauty, coral, amber∣grise, &amp;c. great quantities of fine sea-shells, on which the Japanese used to set no price, till the Eu∣ropeans taught them to value them by the exces∣sive fondness they shewed for them. In exchange for those commodities, the Hollanders bring them glasses of all sorts, which are in great request in Ja∣pan, especially looking-glasses; raw and wrought silks, raw hides, hempen and woollen cloths, quick∣silver, borax, antimony, spices of all kinds, of which they make an immense gain, not only in Ja∣pan, but in all other parts of India, where they sell, perhaps, as great quantities as they import into Europe, and by them purchase the com∣modities of one country, to sell in another. They likewise import hither son sorts of sugar, musk, camphire, siampan, Brazil and other woods, calem∣bac, elephant's teeth, and a great number of small wares, which come from China, Thibet, Siam, &amp;c. china, jin-seng, and other medicinal roots, from
<PB N="24" REF="230"/>
Tartary. All these commodities are exported and imported custom free, which is the chief encou∣ragement given to the Japan commerce; but with this dreadful clause, that if any contraband goods are found on board those vessels, or the commodi∣ties be either adulterated or damaged, or any fraud or cheat be discovered in their invoices, &amp;c. they are sure to be punished with the utmost severity, no nation having such severe laws against all such abuses in trade</P>
<P>Xicoco, the last considerable island, lies between Niphon on the east, and Ximo on the west. It is almost of a square figure, divided into four pro∣vinces, and its circumference, exclusive of bays and creeks, is computed at an hundred and ninety miles. The most considerable maritime town in it, if not the metropolis of the whole island, is called Asa.</P>
<P>We shall conclude this account of Japan with just mentioning a few other curiosities, besides those we have occasionally taken notice of already.</P>
<P>Among the animal kind, we may reckon their white a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, in shape, bigness, and other particulars, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>te our common pismires. The male ducks are no less curious for their largeness, the beauty of their shape, and the variety of their colours and feathers. They have nightingales with such sweet pipes and not<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, that the curious will give twenty cobans for one of them, each coban being worth twenty-three and an half Dutch guilders. Of the Ja∣panese insects, of the flying kind, the male of that called the night fly is greatly admired for its beau∣ty. It hath four wings, two of which are transpa∣rent, and cover a pair of others, which are shining and polished, and most beautifully variegated with blue and golden lines.</P>
<P>Among the vegetable curiosities, the camphire tree is well worth our notice, which is classed among
<PB N="25" REF="240"/>
the laurel kind, and bears a berry of a purple or blackish colour. In this country the camphire is extracted by a simple decoction of the roots and wood, cut into small pieces.</P>
<P>They have several trees here, the wood of which, when sawn and polished, is so beautifully veined, and variegated with different colours and shades, representing landscapes, birds, beasts, &amp;c. that they look as if they had been painted by a skilful hand.</P>
<P>The bridges in this country are built mostly of cedar, and in general are very strong, wide, and lofty, widening on each side like two wings, and railed.</P>
<P>The Japanese are fond of large bells, but theirs are such as have no clear sound, but rather a dull heavy one. They are cast much after the same odd manner as those of China, and struck with a wood∣en clapper or hammer.</P>
<P>The famed catechu, or Japan earth, is com∣pounded of some inspissated juice, brought hither from other parts by the Dutch and Chinese, and mixed up here with some quantity of amber, the best camphire, and some other ingredients, and made into round little balls, cakes, idols, flowers, &amp;c. and then put into neat boxes, for sale and exporta∣tien. To the north of Japan lies what is called the island of Jesso, but very little is known of it; not so much as whether it is an island, or joined to the continent of Asia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands are situated in the Chinesian Sea, between 114 and 131 degrees of east long. and between 5 and 19 of north lat. about three hun∣dred miles south-east of China. The chief of them are those of Luconia or Manilla, Tandaga
<PB N="26" REF="250"/>
or Samar, Mosbate, Mindora, Luban, Paragoa, Panay, Leyte, Bohol, Sibu, Sogbu, Negros, St. John, Xo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o, and Mindanao. They were disco∣vered by Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese gen∣tleman, who had served his native country, both in the wars of Africa and in the East-Indies; parti∣cularly under Albuquerque, the famous Portu∣guese general, who reduced Goa and Malacca to the obedience of that crown. Magellan, having had a considerable share in those actions, and find∣ing himself neglected by the government of Portu∣gal, and even denied, as it is said, the small advance of a ducat a month in his pay, left the court of Portugal in disgust, and offered his service to Charles V. then emperor of Germany and king of Spain, whom he convinced of the probability of discovering a way to the Spice Islands, in the East-Indies, by the west; whereupon, the command of five small ships being given him, he set sail from Seville, on the tenth of August 1519, and stand∣ing over to the coast of South-America, proceed∣ed southward to 52°. where he fortunately hit upon a strait, since called the Strait of Magellan, which carried him into the Pacific Ocean or South-Sea, and then, steering northward, repassed the equator; after which, he stretched away to the west, across that vast ocean, till he arrived at Guam, one of the Ladrones, on the sixth of March 1521, and soon after got to the Philippine Islands, which he took possession of in the name of the king of Spain, but happened to be killed in a skirmish he had with the natives of one of them. His peo∣ple, however, arrived afterwards at the Moluc∣cas, or Clove Islands, where they left a colony, and returned to Spain, by the way of the Cape of Good Hope; being the first that ever sailed round the globe. But there was no attempt made by the Spaniards to subdue or plant the Philippine Islands until the year 1564, in the reign of Philip
<PB N="27" REF="260"/>
II. son of Charles V. when Don Lewis de Velasco, viceroy of Mexico, sent Michael Lopez Delagaspes thither with a fleet, and a force sufficient to make a conquest of these islands, which he named the Phi∣lippines, in honour of Philip II. then upon the throne of Spain; and they have ever since been subject to that crown.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of these islands consist of Chi∣nese, Ethiopians, Malays, Spaniards, Portuguese, Pintados or Painted People, and Mestees, a mix∣ture of all these. Their persons and habits resem∣ble those of the several nations whence they derive their original; only, it is observable, that the fea∣tures of the Blacks of these islands are as agreeable as those of the white people. There is not a soil in the world that produces greater plenty of all things for life; as appears by the multitude of inhabitants to be found in the woods and mountains, who subsist almost entirely by the fruits of the earth, and the ve∣nison they take. Nor can any country appear more beautiful; for there is a perpetual verdure, and buds, blossoms, and fruit, are found upon the trees all the year round, as well on the mountains as in the cultivated gardens. Vast quantities of gold are washed down from the hills by the rains, and found mixed with the sand of their rivers. There are also mines of other metals, and excellent load-stones, found here; and such numbers of wild buffaloes, that a good huntsman on horseback, armed with a spear, will kill ten or twenty in a day. The Spa∣niards take them for their hides, which they sell to the Chinese; and their carcases serve the Moun∣taineers for food. Their woods also abound with deer, wild hogs, and goats. Of the last, there is such plenty in one of these islands that the Spani∣ards gave it the name of Cabras. Horses and cows have been likewise imported into these islands, from New Spain, China, and Japan, which
<PB N="28" REF="270"/>
have multiplied considerably; but the sheep that were brought over came to nothing. The trees produce a great variety of gums; one kind, which is the commonest, by the Spaniards called brea, is used instead of pitch; of the others, some are medicinal, others odoriferous.</P>
<P>In those islands are monkies and baboons of a monstrous bigness, that will defend themselves if attacked by men. When they can find no fruit in the mountains, they go down to the sea to catch crabs and oysters; and that the oysters may not close and catch their paws, they first put in a stone to prevent their shutting close: they take crabs by putting their tail in the holes where they lie, and when the crab lays hold of it, they draw him out. There are also great numbers of civet-cats in some of the islands. The bird called tavan, is a black sea-fowl, something less than a hen, and has a long neck; it lays its eggs in the sand by the sea-side, forty or fifty in a trench, and then covers them, and they are hatched by the heat of the sun. They have likewise the bird saligan, which builds her nest on the sides of rocks, as the swallows do a∣gainst a wall; and these are the delicious birds nests so much esteemed, being a kind of jelly that dissolves in warm water.</P>
<P>The Spaniards have introduced several of the American fruits, which thrive here as well as in America; the cocoa or chocolate nut particularly, which increases so that they have no occasion now to import it from Mexico. Here is also the tree amet, from which the natives draw water; and there is likewise a kind of cane, by the Spaniards called vaxuco, which, if cut, yields fair water enough for a draught, of which there are plenty in the mountains, where water is most wanted.</P>
<P>These islands being hot and moist, produce a∣bundance of venomous creatures, as the soil does
<PB N="29" REF="280"/>
poisonous herbs and flowers, which do not kill those who touch or taste them, but so infect the air, that many people die in the time of their blossom∣ing.</P>
<P>The orange, lemon, and several other trees, bear twice a year. If they plant a sprig, within a year it becomes a tree, and bears fruit; and therefore, without any hyperbole, says our author, I may affirm, that I never saw such a luxuriant verdant soil, nor woods full of such old, large, and lofty trees, nor trees that yield more sustenance to man, in any part of the world. However these islands, besides the inconveniences mentioned above, are also subject to earthquakes, which are some∣times very fatal.</P>
<P>The whole number of them is said to be eleven hundred; but the principal, and that on which the rest depends, is Lucon, Luzon, or Luconia. The Spaniards call it Manilla, or, as it is generally written, Manila, from its capital. It had the name of Luzon from a custom that prevailed among the natives of beating or bruising their rice in wooden mortars, before they either boiled or baked it; luzon, in their language, signifying a mortar.</P>
<P>As to the situation, it is remarkably happy, lying between the eastern and western continents, and having China on the north, at the distance of about sixty leagues; the islands of Japan on the north-east, at the distance of about two hundred and fifty leagues from the nearest of them; the ocean on the east; the other islands on the south; and on the west Malacca, Patana, Siam, Cambodia, Cochin-china, and other provinces of India, the nearest at the distance of three hundred leagues.</P>
<P>The middle of this island is in the latitude 15°. north; the east point in 13°. 30′. and the most
<PB N="30" REF="290"/>
northern point in 19°. The shape of it is said to resemble that of an arm bent; the whole length being about one hundred and sixty Spanish leagues, the greatest breadth between thirty and forty, and the circumference about three hundred and fifty. As to the longitude the charts differ, some making the middle of the island to lie 113°. east from Lon∣don, and others in 160.</P>
<P>As to the climate it is hot and moist. One thing is held very extraordinary, that in stormy weather there is much lightning and rain, and that thun∣der is seldom heard till this is over. During the months of June, July, August, and part of Sep∣tember, the west and south winds blow, which they call vendavales, bringing such rains and storms, that the fields are all overflowed, and they are forced to have little boats to go from one place to another. From October till the middle of De∣cember, the north wind prevails; and from that time till May, the east and south-east, which winds are there called breezes. Thus there are two seasons in those seas, by the Portuguese called monzoens; whence our word monsoons, that is, the breezes half the year, with a serene dry air; and the ven∣davales the other half, wet and stormy. It is fur∣ther to be observed, that in this climate, no ver∣min breed upon Europeans, tho' they wear dirty shirts, whereas it is otherwise with the Indians. The days here being always of an equal length, and the weather never cold, neither their cloaths, nor the hour of dining, supping, doing business, studying or praying, are ever changed; nor is cloth worn, but only against the rain.</P>
<P>The air here being, as has been observed, very hot and moist, is not wholesome; but is worse for young men, that come from Europe, than for the old. As for the natives, without using many precautions,
<PB N="31" REF="300"/>
they live very commonly to fourscore or an hun∣dred.</P>
<P>The soil is so rich, that rice grows even on the tops of the mountains, without being watered; and this makes it so plentiful, that the Indians va∣lue gold so little as not to pick it up, tho' it lies almost every where under their feet.</P>
<P>Among the disadvantages of the island, besides frequent and terrible earthquakes, here are several burning mountains. The face of the island, how∣ever, is far from being disfigured by them, or by the consequences of their explosions.</P>
<P>The mountainers called Tingiani, have no par∣ticular place of abode, but always live under the shelter of trees, which serve them instead of houses, and furnish them with food; and when the fruit is eaten up, they remove where there is a fresh sort.</P>
<P>Here are forty different sorts of palm-trees, the most excellent cocoas, wild cinnamon, wild nut∣megs, and some say wild cloves also; ebony, san∣dal wood, and the best cassia, and in such plenty, that they feed their hogs with its fruit; all kinds of cattle, civet-cats, besides prodigious quantities of gold, amber, and ambergrise.</P>
<P>There are several sorts of people in this island, besides the Spaniards, as the Tagalians, or Taga∣leze, the Pintadoes, or painted negroes, the Ilayas, or Tinglianos, and the Negrellos. The Taga∣lians, who are thought to be Malayans by descent, are a modest, tractable, and well-disposed people. The Pintadoes, or painted negroes, are tall, strait, strong, active, and of an excellent disposition. The Tinghianos, whom some suppose to be descended from the Japanese, are very brave, and yet very courteous and humane. They live entirely on the gifts of nature; and never sleep under any other shade than that of the trees or a cave. The Ne∣grillos,
<PB N="32" REF="310"/>
who are held to be the Aborigines of the island, and are barbarous and brutal to the last degree. When they kill a Spaniard, they make a cup of his skull and drink out of it.</P>
<P>Luconia is divided into several provinces, con∣taining divers towns, the chief of which are Ma∣nila, Caceres, New-Segovia, Bondo, Passacao, Iba∣lon, Bulaw, Sersocon, or Bagatao, Lampon, Fer∣nandina, Bolinao, Playahonda, Cavite, Mindora, Caleleya and Balayan.</P>
<P>Manila, the capital, on the south east side of the island, where a large river falls into the sea, and forms a noble bay, thirty leagues in compass, to which the Spaniards have given the name of Ba∣hia, because the river runs out of the great lake Bahi, which lies at the distance of six leagues be∣hind it. In compass it is two miles, in length one third of a mile; the shape irregular, being narrow at both ends, and wide in the middle. On the south it is washed by the sea, and on the north and east by the river; being also strongly fortified with walls, bastions, forts, and batteries.</P>
<P>Manila contains about three thousand souls, who are a very motley race, distinguished by several strange names, and produced by the conjunction of Spaniards, Chinese, Malabars, Blacks, and others inhabiting the city and islands depending on it. Without the walls are large suburbs, particularly that inhabited by the Chinese merchants, called Sangleys. In proportion to the size of the place, the number of churches and religious houses is very great. Only small vessels can come up to Manila; but three leagues south of it is the town and port of Cavite, defended by the castle of St. Philip, by much the best fortress in the island, and capable of receiving the largest ships. Here stands the arsenal where the galloons are built, for which there are from three to six or eight hundred
<PB N="33" REF="320"/>
constantly employed, who are relieved every month, and while upon duty, are maintained at the king's expence. By an earthquake which happened here in 1645, a third part of the city of Manila was destroyed, and no less than three thousand people perished in the ruins.</P>
<P>In the late war, Spain having entered into en∣gagements with France, in consequence of the family-compact of the house of Bourbon, it was found expedient in England to declare war also against Spain. Whereupon a force was sent out from our East-India settlements, particularly Ma∣drass, for the conquest of the Phillippine Islands, under general Draper, and admiral Cornish, who after a siege of twelve days, took Manila, on the 6th of October 1762, by storm; but, to save so fine a city from destruction, agreed to accept a ransom, amounting to a million sterling, a part of which, it is said, is still unpaid. The Spanish viceroy re∣sides in this city, and lives in the state of a so∣vereign prince. The government is said to be one of the best in the gift of the king of Spain. When the city was taken, as above, the archbishop, who is a kind of pope in this part of the world, was also viceroy. Five large ships, loaded with the riches of the East, as diamonds from Golconda, cinnamon from Ceylon, pepper from Sumatra and Java, cloves and nutmegs from the Moluccas and Banda Islands, camphire from Borneo, benjamin and ivory from Cambodia, silks, tea, and china ware from China, &amp;c. sail yearly from hence to Acapulco in Mexico, and return freighted with silver, making four hundred per cent profit.</P>
<P>The city of Manila is governed by two alcaides; the rest of the cities and great towns have each an alcaide; and in every village there is a corrigidore. Appeals from their sentences are made to the royal court at Manila, in which there are four judges,
<PB N="34" REF="330"/>
and a fiscal, or attorney-general; each of these judges has a salary of three thousand three hun∣dred pieces of eight per annum. The viceroy is president, and, in that quality, has an income of four thousand pieces of eight, but he has no vote; yet if the judges are equally divided, the president names a doctor of the civil law, who, in virtue of his appointment, has a decisive voice. The at∣torney-general, in right of his office, is protector of the Chinese, in consideration of which he receives six hundred pieces of eight every year. As for the Indians that are in subjection, they pay tribute in the following proportions: young men from eigh∣teen, and from thence, if they continue single, to the age of sixty, pay five rials of plate by way of capitation; as single women likewise do from twen∣ty-four to fifty; married men pay ten rials. It is computed that there are within the compass of this government two hundred and fifty thousand Indians, subject to his catholic majesty, of whom two-fifths hold immediately from the king, and the rest from lords or proprietors, who pay two rials for every one for the maintenance of the forces, and the like sum for the parish priest. The royal revenue is computed at about half a million of pieces of eight, exclusive of casualties. In regard to the military establishment, the garrison of Ma∣nila consists of about eight hundred or a thousand men, and there are about three thousand more in the Philippines. The viceroy is by his office cap∣tain general, with a salary of about four thousand pieces of eight.</P>
<P>Mindanao is the largest of these islands next to Luconia, being near two hundred miles long, and one hundred and fifty broad; but it is not subject to Spain. The inhabitants are of different sorts; those of the in-land country are supposed to be the antient Pagan inhabitants, whom the Mo∣hammedans,
<PB N="35" REF="340"/>
that possess the coasts, have driven up into the mountains.</P>
<P>The air of Mindanao is not excessive hot, it is said, tho' it lies within six degrees of the equator, being refreshed by the sea-breeze on every side in the day-time. The inhabitants generally go al∣most naked.</P>
<P>The middle of the country is woody and moun∣tainous; but between the hills are rich vallies, and near the sea-coast it is generally a plain country, producing rice, and such fruits as usually grow between the tropicks. They have also the libby and sago-tree, of the pith whereof they make bread, and a great deal is exported even to Europe, being first dried and grained like seed. The plan∣tain fruit is very good and plentiful here, which is their principal food, and of this also they make their drink. Tobacco grows more plentifully in this island than in any other part of India, and abundance of gold dust is found in the sands of the rivulets. The island yields also a great deal of bees-wax, and as some say, both the clove and nutmeg-tree.</P>
<P>The midland countries, as well as the coasts, are divided amongst a great many petty princes. The sultan of Mindanao, who is a Mohammedan, is the most powerful amongst them: he resides at the city of Mindanao, which stands on the south side of the island, on a small river, two miles from the sea. The houses here, like those of Siam, are built on pillars fourteen or fifteen feet high, to secure them against the flood, which covers the flat countries five or six months of the year. He is absolute in his dominions, and has some ships of war, as well as land forces.</P>

<PB N="36" REF="350"/>
<HEAD>The MOLUCCAS, or CLOVE ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Moluccas, or Spice Islands, were not dis∣covered by the Spaniards 'till the year 1511, and then as it were by chance; for Francis Serrano, Diego d'Abreu, and Ferdinand Magellan, who had been sent to make discoveries, having been se∣parated by a storm, the first penetrated as far as Ternate, and the two latter discovered the island of Amboyna, and afterwards that of Banda.</P>
<P>These valuable islands consist, strictly speaking, of no more than five, viz. Bachiam, Machiam, Motyr, Ternate, and Tydor, from whence it is said they received their name, in the original language of the inhabitants. They are not out of sight of each other, and lie all within the compass of twen∣ty-five leagues to the south of the Philippines, in 125°. of east longitude, and between 1°. south, and 2°. north latitude.</P>
<P>They produce neither corn nor rice; but the natives make their bread of sagoe. Besides the tropical fruits, they once produced great quanti∣ties of cloves, mace, and nutmegs; but the Dutch, who are now masters of them, send people every year to root up all the plants of that kind, lest other nations should possess them, and have trans∣planted the cloves to Amboyna, which, as well as Ceram, and several others, lying to the south of those abovementioned, are reckoned among the Moluccas, taken in a large sense.</P>
<P>The five isles, properly called the Moluccas, are under the dominion of three kings, subordinate to the Dutch. Their coasts are rendered very dan∣gerous by sands and shelves. They were former∣ly subject to the Chinese; fell next under the Ja∣vanese; were in process of time subdued by the Malayans; and the Mohammedans had begun to
<PB N="37" REF="360"/>
settle in them, and convert the inhabitants to their religion, but a very little while before they were discovered by the Portuguese.</P>
<P>Ternate, the largest, is not quite thirty miles in compass; the land high, and yielding good water, but little provision, and few cattle, except goats. The island formerly abounded in cloves. Here are extraordinary fine parrots, exceeding in beauty those of the West Indies, and many birds of Para∣dise. They have also almonds, and coarse tobacco. The king, who resides in this island, was formerly sovereign over twenty-two others that lie in the great Archipelago, between Mindanao on the north; those of Bima and Corea on the south; and the terra firma of Papaos, or New Guinea, on the east; and had his tribute in gold, amber, and birds of Paradise.</P>
<P>Of the Moluccas, taken in a large sense, Am∣boyna is the most considerable, being one of the biggest of them, and the seat of the second Dutch government, next to that of Batavia. Formerly it was the seat of the governor-general; which, after the building of Batavia was transferred thither, on account of the advantageous situation of that city in the midst of all the company's settlements. It is situated in the Archipelago of St. Lazarus, be∣tween the third and fourth degree of south latitude, 145°. of longitude from the Canary Islands, and a hundred and twenty leagues to the eastward of Batavia. The fort here was taken from the Por∣tuguse by the Dutch in 1605; but they did not make themselves entirely masters of Amboyna, and the adjacent countries, till the year 1627, when they had got rid of the English also. This con∣quest put the clove trade wholly into their hands: whence the Moluccas are stiled the gold mine of the company; and so they have proved, if we consider the profit they draw from them, and how
<PB N="38" REF="370"/>
little fear there is of their being ever exhausted. To convince the reader of this, we need only observe, that a pound weight of nutmegs, or of cloves, costs the company not much above a half-penny, and every body knows at what rate they are sold in Europe.</P>
<P>This island of Amboyna is in the centre of this rich commerce; and to keep it more effectually in their hands, the company takes care to have all the clove trees in the adjacent islands grubbed up and destroyed; and sometimes when the harvest is very large in Amboyna, part of the produce there is burnt likewise.</P>
<P>Amboyna is about seventy miles in circumfer∣ence, divided into two parts, viz. a greater and lesser peninsula. The former called Hiton, is twelve leagues in length, and two and a half broad. In this the Dutch have no less than five forts, or rather strong redoubts, mounted with cannon; the other is called Leytimor, five leagues in length, and one and a half broad, which is the southern part of the island; on this stands the fort of Victoria, which is the residence of the governor, and his coun∣cil, composed of fifteen gentlemen or merchants. The fortress is a square, the ramparts mounted with sixty pieces of brass cannon, and the garrison usu∣ally composed of six hundred men. The inhabi∣tants of Amboyna are computed at seventy or eighty thousand, of which but a small number are Dutch, and this obliges them to be continually up∣on their guard, and to keep a competent number of troops in each of their forts, particularly in that of Middleburgh, which stands upon the isthmus that connects these peninsulas. There are also redoubts and garrisons in all the islands of this government.</P>
<P>The time of cutting the cloves, or the clove har∣vest, is between the middle of October and the
<PB N="39" REF="380"/>
middle of December, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, according as the fruit comes to its maturity. Some years the produce is four, five, or six times as much as in others; but, taking it at a medium for seven years, it may be well fixed at a mil∣lion of pounds; and it is computed that, one with another, this is four pounds from every bearing tree. A few days after the fruit is gathered, they collect the cloves together, and dry them before the fire on hurdles, by which means they lose the beautiful red colour they derived from nature, and change into a deep purple, or rather black, which is per∣haps occasioned by their being sprinkled with wa∣ter. It is pretended, that this sprinkling is neces∣sary to hinder the worm from getting into the fruit; but perhaps a better reason may be assigned for it, which is adding weight to the cloves. The wild clove is larger, and more spungy; the culti∣vated clove less hard, and much more aromatic in smell and taste. There are ten islands depend∣ent on Amboyna, viz. Ceram, which is the largest in the whole government; indeed larger than all the rest, taking Amboyna into the number; Ceram-Lavat, Bouro, Amblau, Manipa, Kelang, Bonoa, Oxna, Honimoa, and Noussa-Laout. It is only in Amboyna, and the three last, that cloves are now cultivated; whereas they formerly grew in all the islands, more especially in Ceram. These are the islands, the circuit of which the governor of Amboyna makes once in three years, in order to see that the company's injunctions are complied with, and that no cloves are suffered to grow.</P>
<P>It is said that the Dutch now plant coffee in Am∣boyna, and that it turns to great account. We are told also, that not very long ago, namely un∣der the government of Mr. Bernard, not only con∣siderable quantities of gold dust were found in the mountains washed down by the torrents, but even
<PB N="40" REF="390"/>
a gold mine; but whether it is now wrought, or in what condition it is, we cannot pretend to say. A kind of red wood, exceeding firm and durable, and naturally embellished in its grain with abun∣dance of beautiful figures, is also mentioned among the productions of this valuable island.</P>
<P>The English and Dutch had here once their re∣spective factories and settlements, and had by treaty agreed to divide the traffic to the spice islands be∣tween them; but the Dutch, under pretence of a plot the English were engaged in against these high and mighty usurpers, fell upon the English factors and merchants, tortured them by all the cruel methods they could invent, in order to make them confess a plot, and then put them to death. They seized upon the English shipping, expelled them from their settlements in the Banda or Nutmeg islands, which had put themselves under the pro∣tection of the king of Great-Britain, and acknow∣ledged themselves his subjects, and proceeded to massacre and extirpate the natives. This happened in a time of full peace, in the year 1622, just after a treaty was concluded between the two nations for confirming their respective rights and possessions in the East Indies; and they have continued in pos∣session of them ever since.</P>

<HEAD>The BANDA or NUTMEG ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Banda Islands are six in number, lying in the latitude of 4°. 30′. south, and in the 127°. of east longitude at the distance of about four hun∣dred and fifty leagues from Batavia. Their names are Lonthor, Pouleron, Rosingen, Pooloway, and Gonapi The first of these was called by the natives Bandan, whence the whole are now distin∣guished by the name of the Banda Isles. The largest of them is scarce twenty miles round; yet
<PB N="41" REF="400"/>
they are of infinite consequence to the Dutch, on account of the important commerce in nutmegs, which are covered by the mace; and which grow in such prodigious quantities as to enable the Dutch to supply all the markets of Europe. The nutmeg, when ripe, is pretty near the size of a walnut, and is covered with two skins or shells. The first is very tough, and of the thickness of a man's finger, which falls off of itself, as the fruit ripens: when it is candied, it has a very fine taste. The second is of a red colour, and has a very odoriferous smell: on the opening of this the fruit appears, with a little flower at the top, which is very beautiful, and in its form resembles the lilly of the valley. They gather the nuts, and dry them: but, in the first place, they are thrown into quick lime; for otherwise worms would breed, and destroy them. Here are also most of the tropical fruits, but scarce any corn or cattle.</P>
<P>Besides the islands mentioned above, there are several others in the neighbourhood, in which nut∣megs would grow, if the company did not take care to have them destroyed every year; which, at first sight, may seem extraordinary, since one would imagine, that their being thoroughly rooted out once would prevent their growing again But this difficulty is easily solved, when it is known, that there are in the islands of Banda, and at Amboyna, several sorts of birds; but more especially a kind of turtle-doves or pigeons, that, by swallowing cloves and nutmegs, and voiding them again, pro∣pagate wild trees over all these islands, which the company obliges the inhabitants to pull up and de∣stroy; and the birds also have no quarter given them in the plantations. The great nutmeg har∣vest is in the months of June and August, and in the month of November there is a kind of latter harvest, or gleaning, consisting only of such fruits as were left to ripen; but in the month of April
<PB N="42" REF="410"/>
they visit the trees again, and though the nutmegs gathered at this time are very few, yet they are by far the finest. One year with another, it is com∣puted, that in the three islands in which the Dutch allow them to grow, eight hundred thousand pounds weight of nutmegs are produced; and, if the common opinion be right, about a fourth part of the same quantity of mace. Between two and three thousand slaves are employed in attending the trees, and curing the fruit. There is a wild nut∣meg, as well as wild cinnamon, and wild cloves; but of very little value, and easily distinguished from the genuine spice.</P>
<P>There grows here, as well as at Amboyna, a sort of tree called caliputte, from whence they draw a very rich odoriferous and salutary oil.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Island of CELEBES.</HEAD>
<P>The island of Celebes, or Macassar, is situate un∣der the equator, between the island of Borneo and the Spice Islands, at the distance of an hundred and sixty leagues from Batavia. Its form is in a manner circular, and its diameter about an hundred and thir∣ty leagues. It is called, and with great reason, the Key of the Spice islands. The form of the go∣vernment here is pretty much the same as in the other islands. Since the Dutch drove out the Portuguese, they have taken care to fortify them∣selves effectually on the sea-coast, and have al∣ways a very numerous garrison at Macassar, where the governor resides; which is so much the more necessary because this island is very populous, and the people much superior to the inhabitants of the other islands. Their complexions are of a light olive, and their features regular and agreeable. They are, generally speaking, a middle-sized peo∣ple, active, brave, ingenious, courteous, and well disposed towards strangers: if well used, there are
<PB N="43" REF="420"/>
no people more faithful, or more obedient; but, if ill treated, they are very revengeful, and very seldom discover their resentment but by its effects. It is from this island that the Dutch company draw their best soldiers, who use little poisoned arrows, which they blow through a trunk.</P>
<P>This island is very fruitful, especially in rice, cotton, and opium; but it produces no spice, ex∣cept pepper; and no place is furnished with a greater variety of poisons. The natives, it is said, study which will have the most speedy operation. Their darts, when dipped in poison, give instant death: if a limb be cut off immediately after the wound is received, it will not save the patient.</P>
<P>Besides the Dutch and natives, here are many Chinese, who sail from hence, in their own vessels, into all the ports of the company's dominions, de∣riving immense wealth from their extensive com∣merce, which they manage with a dexterity pecu∣liar to themselves. The inland country is under the dominion of three different monarchs, who, happily for the company, are constantly at variance one with the other; and, if it were not for this, they might at any time drive the Dutch out of the island. The port of Jampoden, in this island, is said to be the best and most capacious in all that part of the world. About the year 1720, a gold mine was discovered in this island; but whether it is worked, and with what success, we are not able to say.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GILOLO.</HEAD>
<P>Gilolo, another large island, lying under the equa∣tor, near the Spice Islands, and possessed by the Dutch, produces much the same commodities as Celebes, and is fortified in like manner.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="430"/>
<HEAD>The SUNDA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Sunda Islands are situated in the Indian Ocean, between 93 and 120°. of east longi∣tude, and between 8°. north and 8°. south lati∣tude; comprehending the islands of Borneo, Su∣matra, Java, Bally, Lamboe, and Banca.</P>
<P>Borneo is situated under the equator, and is the largest island in the world; being eight hundred miles long, and seven hundred broad. It has the Philippines on the north, Macassar on the east, Ja∣va on the south, and Sumatra on the west. The flat country, near the coast, is overflowed most part of the year, which makes the air very unhealthful; and they build their towns upon floats in the mid∣dle of their rivers. Besides rice, cotton, canes, pep∣per, camphire, and the tropical fruits, gold is found here, and diamonds of a large size, and ex∣cellent water. The last are found in their rivers, washed down, probably, by the torrents that pour from their lofty mountains.</P>
<P>The most remarkable animal the island pro∣duces is the ouran outang, a monkey as big as a man, which some of our captains have attempted to bring over; but, being bred in so hot a climate, he dies as soon as he comes into cool weather.</P>
<P>The coast of this island is governed by Moham∣medan princes, the chief of which are those of Banjar, Masseen, and Caytongee, who reside at ci∣ties of that name, on the south-east part of the island; but the original inhabitants still remain in the mountains, and are stiled Beajus, which, in the Malayan tongue, signifies a wild man. These peo∣ple shoot poisoned darts at their enemies, as the natives of Celebes do. Banjar-Masseen is the greatest port and town of traffic in the island; and
<PB N="45" REF="440"/>
which merchants from every country visit, as much as any town in India.</P>
<P>Sumatra, which extends itself north-west and south-east, having Malacca on the north, Borneo on the east, and Java on the south-east, from which it is parted by the Straits of Sunda, is divided by the equinoctial nearly into two equal parts; ex∣tending to 6°. of latitude, north and south. It is about two hundred and fifty leagues in length, six∣ty in breadth, and five hundred in circumference, very rich and fertile; yielding not only sulphur, rice, ginger, pepper, camphire, cassia, sandal, and other woods and drugs, but also fine tin, iron, copper, silver, gold, and diamonds. It is so rich in gold, that it is supposed to be the Ophir and Gold∣en Chersonese of the antients; but what the Eu∣ropeans trade with them for chiefly is their pepper. The camphire of Sumatra is looked upon as the ve∣ry finest in the Indies, and, as the ingenious and accurate Mr. Lockyer assures us from his own knowledge, is worth half a crown an ounce upon the spot. It bears a great price in China, where they make use of it as a kind of leaven, mixing it with their own, which is a coarser kind, to which they think it gives odour and spirit.</P>
<P>Both the English and Dutch have several colo∣nies and settlements here. The chief of the British settlements are those of Bencoolen and Fort Márl∣brough, on the west coast, from whence the East-India company import more pepper than from any country in India. There are also great quantities of the best walking-canes imported from thence.</P>
<P>The natives are of a very dark swarthy com∣plexion, but not black. The coasts are possessed by Mohammedan princes, of whom the king of Achen, at the north end of the island, is the most considerable. The inland country is in possession of several Pagan princes, who have little correspond∣ence with foreigners. The animals here are much
<PB N="46" REF="450"/>
the same as those on the neighbouring continent of Malacca.</P>
<P>Java is situated south of Borneo, and south-east from the peninsula of Malacca, having Sumatra ly∣ing before it, from which it is separated by a nar∣row passage, now so famous in the world by the name of the Straits of Sunda. Authors vary as to its dimensions, but the most moderate allow it nine hundred miles in circuit. The country is mountainous and woody in the middle; but a flat coast, full of bogs and marshes, render the air un∣healthful. It produces pepper, indigo, sugar, to∣bacco, rice, coffee, cocoa-nuts, plaintains, carda∣moms, and other tropical fruits. Gold also, but in no great quantities, hath been found in it. It is di∣versified by many mountains, woods, and rivers; in all which nature has very bountifully bestowed her treasures. The mountains are many of them so high as to be seen at the distance of three or four leagues. That which is called the Blue Mountain is by far the highest of them all, and seen the far∣thest off at sea. They have frequent and very ter∣rible earthquakes in this island, which shake the city of Batavia, and places adjacent, to such a degree, that the fall of the houses is expected every moment. The waters in the road are excessively agitated, inso∣much that their motion resembles that of a boiling pot; and in some places the earth opens, which af∣fords a strange and terrible spectacle. The inhabi∣tants are of opinion, that these earthquakes proceed from the mountain Parang, which is full of sulphur, saltpetre, and bitumen. The fruits and plants of this island are all in their several kinds excellent, and almost out of number. There are abundance of forests scattered over it, in which are all kinds of wild beasts, such as buffaloes, tygers, rhinoceroses, and wild horses, with an infinite variety of serpents, some of them of an enormous size. Crocodiles
<PB N="47" REF="460"/>
are prodigiously large in Java, and are found chief∣ly about the mouths of rivers; for, being amphi∣bious animals, they delight mostly in marshes and savannahs. This creature, like the tortoise, lays its eggs in the hot sands, without taking any further care of them; and the sun hatches them at the pro∣per season, when they run instantly into the water. There is, in short, no kind of animal wanting here: fowls they have of all sorts, and exquisitely good, especially peacocks, partridges, pheasants, wood∣pigeons; and, for curiosity, they have the Indian bat, which differs little in form from ours; but its wings, when extended, measure a full yard, and the body of it is of the size of a rat. They have fish in great plenty, and very good; so that for the va∣lue of three-pence there may be enough bought to dine six or seven men. They have likewise a multitude of tortoises, the flesh of which is very little inferior to veal; and there are many who think it better.</P>
<P>It is said, that there are in the island upwards of forty great towns, which, from the number of their inhabitants, would, in any other part of the world, merit the title of cities; and more than four thousand five hundred villages, besides ham∣lets, and straggling houses, lying very near each other, upon the sea-coast, and in the neighbour∣hood of great towns: so that, upon a fair and mo∣derate computation, there are within the bounds of the whole island, taking in persons of both sexes, and of all ranks and ages, more than thirty mil∣lions of souls; so that it is thrice as populous as France, which, tho' twice as big, is not computed to have more than twenty millions of inhabitants.</P>
<P>There are a great many princes in the island, of which the most considerable are the emperor of Materan, who resides at Katasura, and the kings of Bantam and Japara. Upon the first of these
<PB N="48" REF="470"/>
many of the petty princes are dependant; but the Dutch are absolute masters of the greatest part of the island, particularly of the north coast, though there are some of the princes beyond the moun∣tains, on the south coast, who still maintain their independency. The natives of the country, who are established in the neighbourhood of Batavia, and for a tract of about forty leagues along the mountains of the country of Bantam, are imme∣diately subject to the governor-general. The company send drossards, or commissaries, among them, who administer justice, and take care of the public revenues.</P>
<P>The city of Batavia is the capital not only of this island, but of all the Dutch dominions in In∣dia. It is an exceeding fine city, situated in the latitude of 6°. south, at the mouth of the river Ju∣catra, and in the bosom of a large commodious bay, which may be considered not only as one of the safest harbours in India, but in the world. The city is surrounded by a rampart, twenty-one feet thick, covered on the outside with stone, and forti∣fied with twenty-two bastions. This rampart is environed by a ditch forty-five yards over, and full of water, especially when the tides are high, in the spring. The avenues to the town are defended by several forts, each of which is well furnished with excellent brass cannon: no person is suffered to go beyond these forts without a passport. The river Jucatra passes through the midst of the town, and forms fifteen canals of running water, all faced with free-stone, and adorned with trees that are ever green: over these canals are fifty-six bridges, besides those which lie without the town. The streets are all perfectly strait, and each, gene∣rally speaking, thirty feet broad. The houses are built of stone, after the manner of those in Hol∣land. The city is about a league and a half in
<PB N="49" REF="480"/>
circumference, and has five gates; but there are ten times the number of houses without that there are within it. There is a very fine town-house, four calvinist churches, besides other places of worship for all sorts of religions, a spin-huys or house of correction, an orphan-house, a magazine of sea stores, several for spices, with wharfs and cord∣manufactures, and many other public buildings. The garrison consists commonly of between two and three thousand men. Besides the forts men∣tioned above, there is the citadel of Batavia, a very fine regular fortification, situated at the mouth of the river, and flanked with four bastions; two of which command the sea, and the other two the town. It is in this citadel that the governor-gene∣ral of the Indies has his palace; over-against which is that of the director-general, who is the next per∣son to the governor. The counsellors, and other principal officers of the company, have also their apartments there; as have likewise the physician, the surgeon, and the apothecary. There are in it, besides, arsenals and magazines, furnished with ammunition for many years. The city of Batavia is not only inhabited by Dutch, French, Portu∣guese, and other Europeans, established here on account of trade; but also by a vast number of Indians of different nations, Javanese, Chinese, Malayans, Negroes, Amboynese, Armenians, na∣tives of the isle of Bali, Mardykers or Topasses, Macassars, Timors, Bougis, &amp;c. Of the Chinese there are, it is said, about an hundred thousand in the island; of which, near thirty thousand resided in the city until the year 1740, when the Dutch, pretending that they were in a plot against them, sent a body of troops into their quarter, and de∣manded their arms, which the Chinese readily delivered up; and the next day the governor sent another body, with orders to murder and massacre
<PB N="50" REF="490"/>
every one of the Chinese, men, women, and chil∣dren. Some relate there were twenty, others thirty thousand, that were put to death, without any manner of trial; and yet the barbarous gover∣nor, who was the instrument of this cruel proceed∣ing, had the assurance to embark for Europe, ima∣gining he had amassed wealth enough to secure him against any prosecution in Holland; but the Dutch, finding themselves detested and abhorred by all mankind for this piece of tyranny, endea∣voured to throw the odium of it upon the governor, though he had the hands of all the council of Ba∣tavia, except one, to the order for the massacre. The states, therefore, dispatched a packet to the Cape of Good Hope, containing orders to appre∣hend the governor, and send him back to Batavia to be tried. He was accordingly apprehended at the Cape; but has never been heard of since. It is supposed, he was thrown over-board in his pas∣sage to Batavia, that there might be no farther en∣quiries into the matter; and, it is said, all the wealth this merciful gentleman had amassed, and sent over before him in four ships, was cast away in the passage.</P>
<P>Besides the garrison here, the Dutch, it is said, have about fifteen thousand men in the island, ei∣ther Dutch, or formed out of the several nations they have enslaved; and they have a fleet of be∣tween twenty and thirty men of war, with which they give law to every power on the coast of Asia and Africa, and to all the European powers that visit the Indian Ocean, unless we should now ex∣cept the English: it was, however, but a little be∣fore the Revolution, that they expelled us from our settlement at Bantam. The rest of the Sunda islands are inconsiderable.</P>

<P>The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, as we ob∣served already, in our account of the Farther Pe∣ninsula of India, lie near the coast of Malacca, at the entrance of the Bay of Bengal. They afford no merchandize but provisions, and the tropical fruits, with which they supply the shipping that touch there.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The MALDIVIA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Maldivia islands are very numerous, but small, extending from 8°. of north latitude to 4°. of south, in length, consequently near two hun∣dred leagues; but not above thirty or thirty-five leagues in breadth. The most northern of them lies but fifty leagues from Cape Comorin. The Dutch, who now carry on, in a great measure, the commerce of these islands, find it extremely profit∣able; as purchasing at a very low price, and al∣most in what quantities they please, the finest caw∣ries, a kind of shells, which pass for ready money in some nations, particularly on the coast of Gui∣nea. The cocoa also of the Maldives, of which so many useful manufactures are made, and of which such high commendations are to be met with in se∣veral authors, as if it grew no where in such per∣fection as in these islands, is in reality a differ∣ent species of that fruit, which grows only in the Maldives; yet the nuts are not eatable, as is commonly reported, but medicinal, and in that re∣spect highly esteemed; more especially in the cure of fevers, and of poisons. A modern au∣thor describes it thus, from his own knowledge: "Of this tree (says he) they build vessels of twen∣ty or thirty tons: their hulls, masts, sails, rigging,
<PB N="52" REF="510"/>
anchors, cables, provisions, and firing, are all from this useful tree." It also affords them oil for their kitchen and lamps, sugar, candied sweetmeats, and a pretty strong cloth.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Island of CEYLON.</HEAD>
<P>The noble island of Ceylon, Ceylan, or Cei∣lon, called by the inhabitants Lamea, which, in their language, signifies the Terrestrial Para∣dise, is by many held to be the largest, and, beyond controversy, is one of the richest and finest in the world, yielding long pepper, fine cot∣ton, ivory, silk, tobacco, ebony, musk, crystal, saltpetre, sulphur, lead, iron, steel, copper, be∣sides cinnamon, gold, and silver, and all kinds of precious stones, except diamonds. The country also abounds with most excellent fruits of all kinds, with sea and river fish of various sorts, fowls, wild and tame; and animals, particularly elephants, much larger than in any other country of the In∣dies; tigers, bears, civet-cats, apes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The air of Ceylon, though very hot, is not∣withstanding esteemed to be tolerably whole∣some. It is situated in the Indian Ocean, near Cape Comorin, the southern promontory of the Hither India, from which it is separated by a ve∣ry narrow strait, being commonly reckoned about two hundred and fifty miles long, and two hundred broad. Towards the middle it is mountainous and woody; but has a very flat coast, well planted with groves of cinnamon trees, and cocoas. The cinnamon produced here is by far the best in all Asia. There are three sorts of it; the finest, which is taken from trees of a middling growth; a coarser sort, taken from the old ones; and wild cinnamon, which grows not only here, but in Ma∣labar, China, and, of late years, in Brasil. The na∣tives,
<PB N="53" REF="520"/>
it is said, distinguish nine or ten different kinds of it; but since the Dutch have been masters here, they propagate only the best, and prohibit all the rest. The woods that furnish this precious spice lie mostly about Colomba, the principal Dutch settlement. What is called the Cinnamon Field, comprehending the west and south coasts of the island, between Negambo, or Nejambo, and Punta di Gallo, belongs wholly to the Dutch. The best cinnamon grows in the neighbourhood of Colom∣bo and Negambo; that at Point de Galles is pret∣ty good; the rest middling. The trees multiply very fast, and almost without culture; but the Dutch, to keep up the value of cinnamon, obstruct their propagation. The tree, according to some, has three barks, but two all people agree in; and that which they strip from trees of a middling growth is the best cinnamon; neither the trees that are very young, nor those that are very old, are proper for peeling. The body of the tree, un∣der the bark, is perfectly white, and serves them for building, and all manner of uses; but has not the delicious taste or smell that the bark has. The gold and silver mines, in this island, it is said, are prohibited to be worked.</P>
<P>The Ethiopians, Egyptians, and Arabians, are sup∣posed to have traded hither before Solomon's time.</P>
<P>The Portuguese drove out the Arabs, &amp;c. and fortified the towns upon the coast, monopolizing the trade, anno 1520. The Dutch were first call∣ed in by the natives in the year 1656, to defend them against the Portuguese; and now they are almost entire masters of the island, having subdued all the coasts, and shut up the king in his capital city of Candy, which stands upon a mountain in the middle of the island; neither the king nor his subjects being permitted to traffic, or entertain any correspondence with other nations.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="530"/>
The descendants of the antient inhabitants, of whom the bulk of the people still consist, are call∣ed Cinglasses: the other inhabitants are Moors, Malabars, Portuguese, and Dutch.</P>
<P>The principal places in the island, besides Candy, are Colombo, Negambo, Punta di Gallo, Jafna∣patam, Trinkenemali, Materolo, and Scitavaca, most of which are possessed by the Dutch. Co∣lombo, where the Dutch governor resides, stands on the west side of the island, looking towards Cape Comorin, on a bay into which small vessels may enter; but cannot ride with any great safety, be∣cause it lies exposed to the north wind. Punta di Gallo, the best port in the island, and capable of receiving the largest vessels, is seated on the south-west coast.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>AFRICA.</HEAD>
<P>AFRICA, the third grand division of the globe, lies south of Europe, and west of Asia, being separated from the former by the Mediterranean, and from the latter by the isthmus of Suez, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. On the south and west it has the Southern and Atlantic Oceans; so that it may be properly stiled a vast overgrown peninsula, joined only to the continent of Asia by the isthmus abovemen∣tioned. It extends a prodigious way, not only on each side of the equator, but of the tropics like∣wise, the southern verge of it reaching quite to the 35th degree of south, and the northern almost to 37th of north latitude; whereby its outmost ex∣tent, from north to south, is almost seventy-two degrees, or about four thousand three hundred and twenty miles. From east to west it reaches still
<PB N="56" REF="550"/>
farther, viz. from seventeen west, to sixty east, or seventy-seven degrees of longitude; that is four thousand six hundred and twenty miles. It is of a triangular or pyramidical form, the base being the northern part of it, which runs along the shores of the Mediterranean, and the point or top of the pyramid, the Cape of Good Hope.</P>
<P>Its situation for commerce is certainly beyond any of the other quarters of the globe, standing as it were in the centre between the other three, and having thereby a much nearer communication with Europe, Asia, and America, than any of the other quarters has with the rest; for it lies opposite to Europe on the Mediterranean almost a thousand miles in a line east and west, from beyond Tri∣poli to Cape Spartel at the straits mouth; the dis∣tance seldom a hundred miles, no where a hun∣dred leagues, and often not twenty. It is op∣posite Asia, all the length of the Red Sea, north and south; the distance sometimes not being above five leagues, seldom fifty; and it fronts all the southern coasts of Asia, viz. the coasts of Cilicia, and those of India, tho' at a greater distance, yet much nearer than any other country. It is also wonderfully accommodated for commerce, by the interposition of islands, from Madagascar to Ma∣labar; and more particularly, by means of the alternate trade-winds which render the navigation safe, easy, and constant. Lastly, it lies opposite to America, at the distance of from five hundred to about seven hundred leagues, including the islands, with a coast of about two thousand; whereas America no where joins Europe or Asia, except perhaps by a terra incognita, and at a dis∣tance from the former of a thousand leagues, and from the latter of two thousand five hundred.</P>
<P>It is furnished with the greatest and most con∣venient navigable rivers, and perhaps with as many
<PB N="57" REF="560"/>
of them as any other of the chief parts of the globe; such as the Nile and Nubia, falling into the Mediterranean on the north; the Niger or Rio Grand, the Congo, the Zairi, and the Loango, all very large rivers, that empty themselves into the At∣lantic; the first two north, and the other three south of the line: also, the Natal, the Rio St. Esprit, the Melinda, and the Mozambo, rivers of great length and breadth, that discharge themselves into the In∣dian Ocean on the east-side of Africa. Besides these, there are innumerable others, which, though not equal to these, are yet very noble streams, fitted for navigation and commerce; and was this coun∣try blessed with a people qualified for trade and business, it might become the medium of an endless commercial correspondence. The soil is fruitful, and the air salubrious; and was a turn for industry and the arts once introduced among the natives, who are more numerous than is common∣ly imagined, there would be a greater demand for the European produce and manufactures here than from any other quarter of the globe; and as in ge∣neral they stand in great need of European commo∣dities, so they have the most valuable returns to make for them. This is not the state of trade be∣tween Europe and Asia: Europe calls for a vast quantity of goods from Asia, and Asia takes little from Europe besides money; consequently, that trade is carried on to the infinite advantage of the former, and to the great disadvantage of most, if not all the nations of the latter, draining the whole western world of its ready money, in return for its products and manufactures alone. However, in the main, this is not such a disadvantage to Eu∣rope as some are inclined to think; especially if, as some great politicians maintain, gold and silver are to be looked upon in no other light than as com∣modities to be exported and imported, except in our own coin, as freely as any other whatsoever:
<PB N="58" REF="570"/>
and if Europe, at present, contained all the gold and silver that Africa and America have ever pro∣duced, it is a question whether she could be said to be ever the richer, by reason that gold and silver would then be, as it was said of Solomon's time, as plenty as the stones in the streets, and therefore of little or no value: so that a commerce which takes off from the Europeans some part of their sil∣ver may be as necessary as any other, to keep its value in a due proportion to that of gold, which rises or falls always according to the quantity of the former.</P>
<P>With regard to the valuable returns the Africans have to make, the Europeans cannot be ignorant from that share of trade they carry on with them at present. That they abound in gold, we have not only the testimony of the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the French, as well as the English, who have settlements on the coast of Africa, but that of the most authentic historians. There is no country in the world, says Leo Africanus, richer in gold and silver than some of those in Africa; parti∣cularly Mandingo, Ethiopia, Congo, Angola, Bu∣tua, Quiticui, Monomotopa, Casati, and Mehene∣mugi. By means of settlements of strength on the continent of Africa, the Europeans might, by the exchange of their commodities, draw into their hands all the gold of those countries. Here also is a prodigious number of elephants, which would not only facilitate the inland intercourses of traffic, but also afford a very beneficial branch of commerce in the teeth of these valuable animals. In the above∣mentioned historian are numberless passages re∣lating to the mines, and shewing how easy it would be for the Europeans to carry on a very extensive trade with that part of the globe. This account of the great treasures of Africa is confirmed likewise by the Nubian geographer, who says, that the
<PB N="59" REF="580"/>
king of Guinea, the greatest city of all the coun∣tries of Negroland, has a mass of gold of thirty pounds weight, as it was naturally produced in the mines, which is perfectly pure, tough, and mal∣leable, without having been smelted or refined, by the ordinary methods, from its native ore. Father Labat has descended to a very minute specification of a great variety of rich mines, which, he says, are very shamefully worked by the negroes, by reason of their being totally ignorant of the nature of mining; and that they have never yet come to the main vein of any of their mines. Copper is the next valuable ore found in this part of the world: what plenty there is of it is not certainly known; but there is good reason to believe it is exceeding great, as it is a common saying among them, that the mountains which we call Atlas, are all copper. So fertile are the fields on the northern coast in corn, that, though they are but meanly cultivated, for want of a knowledge in agriculture, they yield an hundred fold increase. The quan∣tity of ivory, wax, gums, civet, and ostrich-fea∣thers, is such in this country, that the greatest de∣mands might be supplied without being missed; besides, with proper culture, productions might un∣doubtedly be greatly multiplied and improved in these warm climates. It cannot be doubted but the fruitful rich lands every where to be found up∣on the coasts, and within the country, particularly upon the banks of the rivers near the Gold Coast, and the Slave Coast, would produce all the richest articles of the East and West-Indies. The spices of Banda, Ternate, and Amboyna, might be produced on the rich and fruitful shores of Melinda, on the east side, or of the Slave Coast on the west; and that as easily, and to as great advantage, as where they are now, the latitude being the same, and the soil not unlike. The cinnamon also of Ceylon,
<PB N="60" REF="590"/>
the tea of China and Japan, and the coffee of Mo∣cha, it is probable, might also be raised on the same coast; from the Rio de St. Esprit, southward, to the river Natal, the soil and climate being tem∣perate, fertile, and healthy. It has been affirmed, that the sugars of Barbadoes and Jamaica, together with the ginger, cotton, rice, pepper, or pimento, the cocoa, the indigo, and every other plant which comes from these islands, might, with equal industry, be produced in as great plenty, and as good, as in America; and we are assured, that in respect to ginger, cotton, and indigo, trials have been made by the English factories on the Gold Coast of Africa, which have succeeded to admiration. Hence it appears pretty evident, that nothing is wanting to render Africa equal, if not superior in many respects, to any of the other parts of the world: for though the middle of it, lying be∣tween the tropics in the torrid zone, and under the line, is exceeding hot; yet, even in the hottest parts, it is not only habitable, but actually inhabit∣ed, and the people enjoy health and plenty, and live very agreeably, having cattle, corn, cooling fruits, shades, and rivers: as for instance, in the island of St. Thomas, under the very line; also on the Gold Coast, and in the kingdom of Benin and Angola, on the west shore; and even on the coast of Zan∣guebar, in Ethiopia, Melinda, and several of the more intemperate places on the eastern shore. But making allowance for some of the inland countries remote from the sea, which we are told are desti∣tute of water, and therefore desert, yet these are not equal to the uninhabited wastes of Europe, Asia, and America; Africa, in respect of its feel∣ing no cold, having a great advantage over the other quarters of the world, and the far greater part of it enjoying the finest and most temperate climate, as the most northern latitude does not ex∣ceed
<PB N="61" REF="600"/>
37, and the most southerly 35 degrees. It is however melancholy to observe, that a country which has ten thousand miles of sea-coast, with noble, large, deep rivers, penetrating into the very centre of the country, should yet have no naviga∣tion, nor receive any benefit from them; that it should be inhabited by an innumerable people, without knowledge of each other, correspondence, or commerce. At the mouths of these rivers are the most excellent harbours, without number, deep, safe, and calm, sheltered from the wind, and capable of being made perfectly secure by for∣tifications; but quite destitute of shipping, trade, and merchants, even where there is plenty of mer∣chandize. In short, Africa, though a full quarter of the globe, stored with an inexhaustible treasure, and capable, under proper improvements, of pro∣ducing so many things delightful, as well as con∣venient, within itself, seems to be almost entirely neglected; not only by the natives, who are quite unsollicitous of reaping the benefits which nature has provided for them, but also by the more civi∣lized Europeans who are settled in it, particularly the Portuguese. What it produces, in its present rude unimproved state, serves only to promote the happiness of others; as if not only the inhabitants had been destined by nature to be slaves to their fellow-creatures, but the very land was captive, and produced its treasures merely for the benefit of the rest of the world, and not for their own.</P>
<P>Whether, instead of making slaves of these peo∣ple, it would not be more becoming those nations that assume to themselves the name and character of Christians, to give them a relish for the blessings of life, by extending traffic into the country in the largest degree it will admit of, and introducing among them a more civilized way of life, we sub∣mit to the reader's consideration. The Dutch, by
<PB N="62" REF="610"/>
recommending their dress, and introducing their customs in the Spice Islands, have wonderfully hu∣manized the inhabitants, who were formerly as barbarous in their manners as the negroes. But, it is to be feared, this can never be brought about while the slave-trade continues to be the great object of the Europeans; for that will ever spirit up wars and hostilities among the negro princes and chiefs, for the sake of making captives of each other for sale, and thereby obstruct the civilizing the natives, and extending their trade into the inte∣rior parts of the country, which otherwise might be very practicable. To obtain a competent num∣ber of servants to work as the negroes now do, in the colonies belonging to the several European potentates who have settlements in America, does not seem at all impracticable, if proper measures and regulations were adopted for that purpose. Eu∣rope, in general, affords numberless poor distressed objects, who would be glad to be provided for in that manner; and if they were not over-worked, or tyrannically treated, as the negroes generally are, they make as good, or better, servants for the planters; and were all the Europeans upon a level, in regard to the price of labour in their colonies, they would, very probably, all find their account in laying absolutely aside the slave-trade, and cul∣tivating a fair, friendly, humane, and civilized commerce with the Africans.</P>
<P>Africa once contained several kingdoms and states, eminent for the liberal arts, for wealth and power, and the most extensive commerce. The kingdoms of Egypt and Ethiopia, in particular, were much celebrated; and the rich and powerful state of Carthage extended her commerce to every part of the then known world; even the British shores were visited by her fleets, till Juba, who was king of Mauritania, but tributary to Carthage, un∣happily called in the Romans, who, with the as∣sistance
<PB N="63" REF="620"/>
of the Mauritanians, subdued Carthage, and, by degrees, all the other neighbouring king∣doms and states. After this, the natives constant∣ly plundered, and consequently impoverished, by the governors sent from Rome, neglected their trade, and cultivated no more of their lands than might serve for their subsistence. Upon the de∣cline of the Roman empire, in the fifth century, the north of Africa was over-run by the Vandals, a barbarous northern people, who contributed still more to the destruction of arts and sciences; and, to add to this country's calamity, the Saracens made a sudden conquest of all the coasts of Egypt and Barbary in the seventh century: these were af∣terwards succeeded by the Turks; and both these being of the Mohammedan religion, whose profes∣sors carry desolation with them wherever they come, the ruin of that once flourishing part of the world was thereby compleated.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this continent, with respect to religion, may be divided into three sorts; namely, Pagans, Mohammedans, and Christians. The first are the most numerous, possessing the greatest part of the country from the tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope, and these are generally black. The Mohammedans, who are of a tawny com∣plexion, possess almost all the northern shores of Africa. The people of Abyssinia, or the Upper Ethiopia, are denominated Christians; but retain abundance of Pagan and Jewish rites. There are some other Christians upon the sea-coasts, on al∣most every side of Africa; but their number is small, compared with that of the Pagans or Mo∣hammedans. There are also some Jews on the north of Africa, who manage all the little trade that part of the country is possessed of. But it is very remarkable, that though the Carthaginians, who inhabited this very country of Barbary, had greater fleets, and a more extended commerce,
<PB N="64" REF="630"/>
than any other nation, or than all the people upon the face of the earth, when that state flourished, the present inhabitants have scarce any merchant-ships belonging to them, nor indeed any other than what Sallee, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, fit out for piracy; which are but few and small, their whole strength not being able to resist a squadron of European men of war.</P>
<P>The reasons assigned why many tracts in the in∣terior parts of Africa are either thinly or not at all inhabited, are those: 1. Their barrenness: 2. The scarcity of water, some provinces being quite desti∣tute of that necessary element: 3. Because, in some sandy parts, the wind drives the sand in such pro∣digious quantities, as sometimes to overwhelm whole caravans. 4. Because several of these coun∣tries are infested with a variety of wild beasts, as tygers, leopards, panthers, hyenas, rhinocerose's, wild asses, and crocodiles, besides a prodigious number of venomous insects and reptiles.</P>
<P>There are scarce any two nations, or indeed any two of the learned, that agree in the modern divi∣sion of Africa; and for this very reason, that scarce any traveller has penetrated into the heart of the country, and consequently we must be content to acknowledge our ignorance of the bounds, and even the names of several of the midland nations. These may be still reckoned among the unknown and undiscovered parts of the world; but accord∣ing to the best accounts and conjectures, Africa may be commodiously divided into these ten parts: 1. Egypt. 2. Ethiopia Superior. 3. Zanguebar, with Adel; all which lie on the east of Africa. 4. Monoemugi, or Monamotopa, and Caffraria, called by some the Lower Ethiopia, which lie on the south. 5. Guinea, lying on the south-west. 6. Nigritia, or Negroland, extending almost quite thro' the country from east to west, on both sides
<PB N="65" REF="640"/>
of the river Niger. 7. Zaara, or the Desert, to the northward of Negritia. 8. Bildulgerid, the antient Numidia, to the northward of Zaara. 9. The empire of Fez and Morocco, containing the north-west part of Africa. And, 10. The coast of Bar∣bary on the north, containing the territories of Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, and Barca. All these we shall describe in order.</P>

<HEAD>EGYPT.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its NAME, SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>EGYPT, called by its antient inhabitants Chemia, and by the Copts, at present, Chemi, was so named, as is supposed, from Ham, the son of Noah, being more than once stiled in the book of Psalms, the Land of Ham; but the name by which it is generally denoted in Scripture is the Land of Misraim: from whence the Arabians, and other Oriental nations, still call it Mesr; which the Greeks write Mesre, and Mestraea.</P>
<P>This country is best known to us by its Greek name, Egypt, the original of which is uncertain, and variously accounted for by authors. The most probable opinion is, that it was so called from the blackness of its soil, and the dark colour both of its river and inhabitants, attested by all relations; for such a colour is called by the Greeks aegyptios, from gyps and aegyps, a vulture, a bird of that hue; and, by the Latins, subvulturius.</P>
<P>Egypt is situated between 30 and 36°. of east longitude, and 21 and 31°. of north latitude; ex∣tending
<PB N="66" REF="650"/>
in length, from north to south, about six hundred miles; and in breadth, along the coast of the Mediterranean, from east to west, near three hundred; but, above the division of the Nile, it grows much narrower, so that, in some places, the two chains of mountains, which rise on each side of that river, leave a plain between them of less than a days journey across. It is bounded on the south by the kingdom of Sennar, and the cataracts of the Nile; on the north by the Mediterranean Sea; on the east by the Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the Isthmus of Suez; and, on the west, by the De∣sert of Barca.</P>
<P>Antiently Egypt was usually divided into the Thebais, so named by the Greeks from its princi∣pal city Thebes, and at present much the same as the Upper Egypt, properly so called, or Al-Said, the Heptanomis or Middle Egypt, and the Lower Egypt; the best part of which lay between the two arms of the Nile, and was called the Delta. The general modern division is also into the Upper, Middle, and Lower Egypt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The greatest part of Egypt lying in a valley, between high rocks and mountains on the east, and the sandy deserts of Lybia and Barca on the west, is excessive hot in some months, particularly in April and May, when they are troubled also with hot winds, by which the sand is driven about in such clouds that the people are almost blinded, and they are then more subject to diseases than during any other part of the year; but no sooner does the Nile begin to rise, and overflow its banks, than all distempers, not excepting even the plague, which generally visits them once in six or seven years, cease. The climate of Egypt must needs be
<PB N="67" REF="660"/>
very warm, from its near situation to the tropic; and it seldom rains in Upper Egypt, or any part of the inland country. They reckon two summers in Egypt; the first of which, in the months of March, April, and May, is the most unwholesome, be∣cause of the unequal weather, high and parch∣ing winds, which reign at that time; but in June, July, and August, and in their autumn and winter, the air is much cooler, the weather more constant, and Egypt one of the most pleasant and delightful countries in the world. The overflowing of the Nile, though it fertilizes the country, is yet attend∣ed with one disadvantage, that the mud, with which it overspreads the best part of the country, sends up a noisome vapour; but the heat and dryness of the climate soon puts a stop to that. It is said, there are not more than two springs in the whole country, to refresh the parched inhabitants; so that they seem to be under a necessity of build∣ing their towns on the banks of the Nile: accord∣ingly, most of them stand near the river, upon rising ground, so made by art or nature; and when the river overflows they appear like so many islands, which have communication with each other only by boats. The fertility of Egypt, and the excel∣lence of its productions and fruits, are greatly ce∣lebrated by antient writers, and by Moses himself, who must needs have been well acquainted with this country. It abounds in grain of all sorts, but particularly rice; insomuch that, as it was former∣ly the granary of Rome, it is now the country which chiefly supplies Constantinople. The most plentiful parts of Egypt are the Delta, and that pro∣vince now called Al Feyyum, supposed to be the antient Heracleotic Nome, which is the most fer∣tile and best cultivated land in the whole kingdom, containing above three hundred and sixty villages, and yielding flax, grapes, and other fruits, in abun∣dance.
<PB N="68" REF="670"/>
It fails not bearing, even in those years when the Nile's not rising to its usual height oc∣casions a scarcity in the other parts of Egypt.</P>
<P>The annual inundation of the Nile, on which the fertility of the greatest part of Egypt depends, is one of the greatest wonders of the country. Geographers inform us that it corresponds exactly with the rainy seasons between the tropics. They commence in the mountains about the beginning of May; and the water of the Nile begins to swell about the middle of it; so that there are fifteen days allowed by nature for the course of the water from Ethiopia to Egypt, which is esteemed a pret∣ty exact allowance, the distance being from the la∣titude of 13 or 15 to that of 28 or 30°. But tho' the river begins to swell in May, yet no public no∣tice is taken of it till the 28th or 29th of June, by which it is generally risen the height of six or eight pikes, a Turkish measure of about twenty-six inches; and then the public criers proclaim it through the capital, and other cities, and continue to publish, in the same manner, how much the ri∣ver increases every day, until it rises to sixteen pikes; and then they cut down the dam of the khalij, or great canal, at Bulâk, which passes thro' the middle of Al-Kahira or Cairo, and let in the water on their lands. If the river wants but an inch of this height they will not cut down the dam; because, in such case, no tribute is due to the prince for the lands that should be watered by them, the produce being then scarce sufficient to maintain the tillers. And therefore, at present, if the basha or governor of Egypt cuts the dam before the river rises to that determinate height, he is answerable for the consequence, and must pay the Turkish emperor his tribute, whether the year be plentiful or not. If the water runs to the height of twenty-three or twenty-four pikes, it is judged most favourable; but, if it
<PB N="69" REF="680"/>
exceeds that, it does a great deal of mischief, not only by overthrowing houses and drowning cattle, but also by engendering a great number of insects, which destroy the fruits of the earth. As to the continuance of the inundation, it depends, as we observed with respect to its rise, on the rains in Ethiopia, which begin to abate at the beginning of September, and cease by the beginning of Octo∣ber. Hence, about a fortnight after the rains be∣gins to abate in Ethiopia, the inundation of the ri∣ver begins to abate in Egypt; and, ten days after the rains cease in Ethiopia, the Nile is quite reduced to its antient channel in Egypt. This being the case, there can be no room any longer to doubt of the rains in Ethiopia being the cause of the inun∣dation. The khalij or canal, above-mentioned, is always opened with great solemnity, in the pre∣sence of the basha, accompanied by all the great officers, and attended by an innumerable multitude of people; this being now one of the greatest festi∣vals in Egypt, as it was in former times.</P>
<P>That they may the better judge of the daily in∣crease of the water, and the consequent plenty or scarcity of the ensuing year, the gradual rise of the water is very exactly measured, either by wells sunk, or pillars erected and divided for that pur∣pose. A very antient column, which served for that use, is yet to be seen in the castle of Old Cai∣ro, said to have been erected in the time of the em∣peror Heraclius. The present Nilomiter, or Mi∣kyas, as the Arabs call it, is in the same castle. It is a large square reservoir, round which runs a handsome gallery, sustained by twelve marble pil∣lars, which form arches, with a balustrade, for the convenience of those who look into the water. In the midst of the bason, through which passes a ca∣nal drawn from the Nile, is an octagonal pillar of white marble, divided into twenty-two equal parts.
<PB N="70" REF="690"/>
They are very careful during the inundation to ob∣serve the height of the water by the measure, and to proclaim it in the city. This work is so exactly finished, and nicely levelled, that the water in the reservoir is neither higher nor lower than that in the river. Besides this, there is another nilometer, built in an island of the Nile, between Jizâh and Al-Fosset. As the river could not of itself over∣flow the lands every where in the necessary propor∣tion, the inhabitants have been obliged, with infi∣nite labour, to cut a vast number of canals and trenches, from one end of Egypt to the other, to convey the water to every part; so that each town and village has its canal, which is opened at the proper time, and the water successively conduct∣ed to the most distant places. It is said also, that above two hundred thousand oxen are daily employed throughout Egypt in drawing water, by engines, from the canals and wells, to water the higher grounds, gardens, and fruit-trees, without reckoning the men who draw water in wicker baskets, so close and well made that not a drop runs through.</P>
<P>The Nile differing in this from other rivers, which generally carry off the heart of the land they over∣flow, by the mud and slime it brings down with it, fattens the earth, and makes it exceeding fruitful, without any manure. The Egyptians have not the laborious task of plowing, digging, or breaking the clods; but, when the river is retired, they have no more to do than to mingle a little sand with the earth, to abate its strength, after which they sow with little pains, and almost without charge. They begin to sow ordinarily in October and November, as the waters fall; within two months the ground is co∣vered with all sorts of grain and pulse; and their har∣vest is in March and April. The same piece of ground produces, the same year, three or four different
<PB N="71" REF="700"/>
sorts of grain and pulse, and of every thing that gardens afford: first they sow lettuce and cucum∣bers, then corn, and, after harvest, melons, and those sorts of pulse that are peculiar to Egypt.</P>
<P>Besides all manner of grain, peas, beans, rice, flax, hemp, melons, oranges, lemons, sugar-canes, dates, plantains, grapes, figs, and palm trees, from which wine is made, Egypt produces the richest pasture, and abounds in flocks and herds; which are turned out to graze in November, and continue at grass till the flood returns. The cows here, it is said, always bring two calves at a time, and sheep yean twice a-year, having two lambs the first time, and one the second; and a goat is often seen fol∣lowed by four kids, which she has brought in six months. The pastures in Egypt are most excel∣lent, the grass generally growing to the height of the cattle: on this they feed in winter, during which season, great numbers are driven thither from about the Euphrates. In summer, the grounds being either burnt up by the sun, or overflowed by the Nile, they are taken up, and fed with hay, beans, and barley.</P>
<P>The surprising fecundity occasioned by the over∣flowing of the Nile, we are told, reaches not only to the earth and to brute animals, but also to man∣kind; and that it hath been found, by constant expe∣rience, that the new waters make the women fruit∣ful, whether they bathe in them, or only drink them.</P>
<P>The most remarkable animals of Egypt, besides those we have already mentioned, are the crocodile, the hippopotamos, the little or land crocodile, wild oxen, camels, asses, antelopes, a large kind of ape, with a head somewhat like a dog, whence it was antiently called by the Greeks cynocephalus, the chameleon, and the Egyptian rat, called, by the antients, ichneumon.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="710"/>
The crocodiles are often killed by the natives. One way of taking them is, by a piece of flesh stuck on a hook, and let down into the river by a rope, the other end of which is fastened to a stake: when the crocodile has seized the bait, he is drawn to land and killed. Another more dangerous way is some∣times practised, by striking them, as they sleep, under the belly, with a stake armed with a bearded point of iron, and also fastened to a stake.</P>
<P>The hippopotami are common in Upper-Egypt, especially near the cataracts; but they are scarce ever seen in the Lower-Egypt. It is larger than an ox, the hinder part much like one, and its head like a horse; having thick large feet, with claws, and a tail like an elephant. It is an amphibious animal, comes out of the river, and feeds on the grass in the meadows, but is exceeding shy.</P>
<P>They have an extraordinary breed of asses here, which will perform a journey well; and the Chris∣tians, it is said, are not suffered to ride on any other beast. A traveller hires the owner of the beast, or his servant, as well as the ass, who trots after the beast, and pricks him along with a kind of goad.</P>
<P>The animal called the little or land crocodile, sup∣posed to be the scincus of Pliny, is about the big∣ness of a lizard, and has a round tail covered with scales. It is found near the Nile and the Red Sea, and usually feeds on the most odoriferous flowers. The flesh is of use in physic, great numbers of them being, for that reason, carried to Venice, and other places.</P>
<P>The Egyptian rat, called by the antients ichneu∣mon, is of the size of a cat, with very rough hair, spotted with white, yellow, and ash colour; its nose like that of a hog, with which it digs up the earth. It has short black legs, and a tail like a fox. It lives on lizards, serpents, snails, chame∣leons,
<PB N="73" REF="720"/>
rats, &amp;c. and is of great service in Egypt, by its natural instinct, hunting out, and breaking the eggs of the crocodiles, and thereby preventing too great an increase of that destructive animal. The naturalists also say, that it is so greedy after the crocodile's liver, that rolling itself in mud, it slips down his throat, while he sleeps with his mouth open, and gnaws its way out again. It is easily tamed, but must not be kept where cats are, with which it is at perpetual enmity.</P>
<P>The chameleon is a little animal, something resembling a lizard, that changes colour as you stand'to look at it.</P>
<P>Of birds there are also great numbers in Egypt, particularly ostriches, eagles, hawks, and a prodi∣gious number of water fowl, as pelicans, flamingos, or phaenicopteri, wild geese, herons, ducks, and various other sorts. Those which are peculiar to the Nile, are the ibis, the goose with golden fea∣thers, the rice-hen, or hen of Dimyat, and the sak∣sak; which last is the trochilus of the antients, ob∣served by them to be the only creature with which the crocodile is in friendship; because this bird pecks and clears his mouth of the leeches which infest it. The ibis deserves particular notice, not only be∣cause it is so peculiar to Egypt, that it pines away and dies, if carried elsewhere, but for the great use it is of in that country, by destroying the flying serpents, which the south wind brings from the deserts of Lybia, and are shaped like the water∣snakes, with wings like a bat: in the proper season of the year, these birds, in vast numbers, by a pe∣culiar instinct, go and wait on the frontiers for these serpents, and devour them as they fly, before they enter Egypt. There are two kinds of the ibis; one of a deep black, and about the bigness of a heron: this is the ibis, which kills the serpents, and is seldom found, except only in the Lower Egypt:
<PB N="74" REF="730"/>
the other is white, but has the head, neck, and ends of the wings and tail as black as the former; these are very common, and great numbers of them are often seen. The bill and legs of this bird resemble those of a stork: its usual food (besides the serpents a∣bovementioned) are snails, locusts, and other in∣sects.</P>
<P>The ostrich is very common in the deserts of Egypt, as well as those of Arabia. They are the tallest fowls we meet with any where, and will strike a blow like a horse, with their hind feet. Their backs are shaped almost like a camel's, and they run a prodigious pace, assisted by their wings, which are of little use to them in flying, for they can scarce raise themselves from the ground, and the Arabs frequently ride them down.</P>
<P>The serpent called the basilisk, or cokatrice, whose very eyes dart certain death, if we may credit the antients, is also said to be found in Egypt; but this may be supposed to be only a simile of the antient poets, to illustrate, how fatally young men are frequently allured and captivated by the eyes of some fair charmer to their destruction. The asp is another little serpent found also in this country, by whose bite the celebrated Cleopatra and her ladies chose to die, the poison operating suddenly, and throwing the party into a deep sleep; tho' some who have been wounded by it, are said to have died in a laughing fit, and others weeping.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES and ANTIQUITIES of EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>Besides the regular inundation of the Nile, and the rare animals mentioned above, there are seve∣ral other things for which Egypt is remarkable, particularly the pyramids, the mummy pits, the sphinx, the labyrinth, the lake Maeris, the cataracts
<PB N="75" REF="740"/>
of the Nile, the hatching of chickens in ovens, the papyrus, or byblus, of which they antiently made paper, the lotus, and some others.</P>
<P>The pyramids, which stand three or four leagues to the westward of Cairo, near the site of the an∣tient Memphis, are the grandest pieces of antiquity now remaining on the face of the earth. The base of the largest covers eleven acres of ground, and is five hundred feet high, measured perpendi∣cularly, and seven hundred, if measured obliquely from the bottom of the base to the top, which may reconcile the different relations we meet with of its height; tho' Dr. Shaw observes, the sands are blown up so high on the sides, that it is impossible to take the height of it exactly. There is a room in it thirty four feet long, and seventeen broad, in which is a marble chest seven feet long, which some suppose to be a coffin, in which the body of some antient king was deposited.</P>
<P>There are two others near as large as the first, and at no great distance from it, with many more dispersed about the Lybian Desert, to the amount of twenty, but most of them much inferior in bulk to these three. By whom these pyramids were built, or when, or for what end, is not yet settled.</P>
<P>The mummy pits are in the Lybian Deserts, three or four leagues distant from the three great pyra∣mids. They are subteraneous vaults of a vast extent, above thirty feet deep, having large square allies, on the sides whereof the Egyptians used to bury their dead, by setting the coffin upright in niches, after the embalmed corps was put into it. Some of the chests or coffins in which the mummies or embalmed bodies lie, are of wood, some of stone, and others only of pieces of linen cloth gummed or glued together, which are as strong the wooden ones. With these mummies are usual∣ly found the figures of birds and beasts, and little
<PB N="76" REF="750"/>
images of several sorts, some made of copper, others of stone, and others of several kinds of earth. Near the largest pyramid stands what is usually called the sphinx, which if entire, should resemble a woman in the upper part, and in the lower a lion. By this figure the Egyptians in their hieroglyphics represented a harlot; intimating the danger of being smitten by a beautiful faithless woman, whom the fond lover would probably, in the end, find as cruel and ra∣pacious as a lion. Nothing more of this figure is now discernible, but from the shoulders upwards, and yet it is near thirty feet in height. Some think it was hewn out of the rock on which it stands, and that there was never any more of it than we see at present.</P>
<P>The labyrinth is another curiosity. It lies to∣wards the Upper Egypt, near the banks of the Nile. Most part of it is under ground, formed out of a marble rock, and consisting of twelve palaces, and a thousand houses, with so many intricate turnings and windings, that it was impossible for a stranger to find his way thro', or get back again, if he had entered it without a guide.</P>
<P>The lake Maeris was dug by a king of Egypt, called by Herodotus Maeris, and by Diodorus My∣ris, whose name it afterwards received, to correct the irregularities of the Nile, by receiving the su∣perfluous waters, when the river rose too high, and supplying water for the lands, when the river failed. The inhabitants, at present, call this lake the lake of Charon. There is an isle in the mid∣dle of it, of about a league in circumference; but nothing is to be seen of the two pyramids which were built here, tho' they say there are several ruins of temples and tombs, with large figures of men and animals. The canals and ditches that were cut from the main channel, by which the lake com∣municated with the Nile, are still subsisting, and
<PB N="77" REF="760"/>
almost entire at this day, their number and struc∣ture being worthy of admiration.</P>
<P>As to the cataracts of the Nile, which both an∣tients and moderns have magnified so extravagant∣ly, telling us, that the water falls from a prodigi∣ous height, and that people are deafened with the noise of it, Dr. Shaw assures us that they are only ordinary falls of water, such as we frequently meet with on great rivers, where the stream is a little confined, and that they are navigable, so that a boat may pass them safely; but whether the Doc∣tor saw them at the height of the flood, or when the river was low, he does not inform us, and this must certainly occasion a great difference.</P>
<P>The grots in a mountain near Osyût ought not to be passed over in silence. It is said there are above a thousand of them, each more singular and beau∣tiful than another. One of them is large enough to contain six hundred horse in battle array. It is cut out of the rock by the chissel, and supported by vast square pillars of the same rock. In these grottoes various apartments have been made, and some wells sunk; and at the further end there are catacombs hollowed in the rocks, where are a great number of mummies, and tombs adorned with sculptures in basso relievo, which have been almost disfigured by the Arabs.</P>
<P>As to the reed papyrus, or byblus, called at present by the natives al-berbi, whereof the antients made their writing-paper, and from which ours took its name; it grows on the banks of the Nile, and shoots out a stalk of long strait fibres, with leaves like the blade of a sword. The way of manufac∣turing it antiently was by taking out the pith of the stalk, which they worked into a white paste or glew, and of that made the paper, almost in the same manner as we do with linen rags; but others say it was made of the inner rind of the plant. Be∣fore
<PB N="78" REF="770"/>
agriculture was improved in Egypt, this reed was of great service; for they not only used it as food, but made cloaths, boats, and domestic utensils of it; and also crowns for their gods, and shoes for their priests: but more useful inventions have set all this aside, and the plant is now en∣tirely neglected.</P>
<P>The paper of the Romans never exceeded thir∣teen fingers breath, and this was their finest and most beautiful sort. It was sleeked with a tooth or shell, and this kept it from soaking the ink, and made it glisten. The Egyptian papyrus seems even to have been known in the time of Homer; but it was not according to Varro, 'till about the time of Alexander the Great, that it began to be ma∣nufactured to any degree of perfection. Paper made of the rind of this plant was that which was chiefly used 'till the 10th century; when some body invented the making of it with pounded cotton reduced into a pulp. This method, known in Chi∣na several ages before, appeared at last in the em∣pire of the East; yet without any certain know∣ledge of the author, or the time and place of the invention. All public acts and diplomas were written on the Egyptian paper, till the 11th cen∣tury; and it is probable that linen-rag paper was invented some time in that century, as then the Egyptian paper began to be disused in the West, and that of cotton in the East. However, there is no finding an exact date to this discovery; for not∣withstanding the most diligent search of the learn∣ed antiquary Montfaucon, both in France and Italy, he could never find a book or leaf of paper, such as is now used, 'till towards the end of the 13th century.</P>
<P>The lotus grows plentifully in Egypt, especially near Rashîd or Rosetta. It is called by the inha∣bitants al-bahnin, and is a species of nymphaea or
<PB N="79" REF="780"/>
water lilly. Its leaves float on the water, and co∣ver the surface of it, producing many flowers, which were formerly wove into the crowns of conquerors. The antient Egyptians made bread of the middle or pulp dried, and likewise fed on the root, which is round, and as big as an apple. This lotus is dif∣ferent from the fruit of the same name, whereon the lotophagi lived. The Arabs at this day make a drink of the Egyptian lotus, which is very good for inward heat; and eat the stalk and heads of them raw, which are very moist and cooling.</P>
<P>Another curiosity, for which Egypt is famed, is hatching of chickens in ovens. Many thousands are so hatched here every year, the ovens in which the eggs are laid being covered and heated with horse-dung, with so temperate a warmth, and so exactly resembling that of a hen, that chickens are at length formed and hatched. Successful ex∣periments of the same kind have been made both in Italy and France; in the latter particularly by M. Baussan du Bignon, who made use of fermented tan instead of horse-dung.</P>
<P>These are the principal curiosities and antiqui∣ties in Egypt; but there are many others, especi∣ally antiquities, and that chiefly in Upper Egypt, some of which we shall take notice of in our ac∣count of the towns, but have no room to enlarge upon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the present INHABITANTS of EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>Egypt is inhabited by several different sorts of people, as Turks, Arabs, Moors, Copts, Greeks, Jews, and Franks. They differ in their stature, complexion, habits, and way of life. The Turks are tall, fair, personable men, and cloathed as in Turky. The Arabs are a swarthy, small-limbed people, and live in tents all over the country,
<PB N="80" REF="790"/>
pitched in a circular form, which kind of village they call a dowar: they lie upon mats, and the blankets they wrap about them in the day-time, serve for a covering in the night. Both Turks and Arabs rise very early, constantly attending the public devotions at break of day, again at noon, at sun-set, and at setting of the watch, when it begins to be dark. The Moors and common people, who are natives of the country, are almost as swarthy as the Arabs in this hot climate; and they are gene∣rally an ill-looked people, and very slovenly, espe∣cially the Copts. The Egyptian women, that are not exposed to the sun, have fine complexions, as well as features. All of them in general are very frugal in their diet.</P>
<P>It was from hence that the vagrant race called gypsies came, and dispersed themselves into every kingdom of Europe and Asia. They were origi∣nally called Zinganees, from their captain Zinganeus; who, when sultan Selim made a conquest of Egypt, about the year 1517, refused to submit to the Turkish yoke, and retired into the deserts, where they lived by rapine and plunder, and frequently came down into the plains of Egypt, committing great outrages in the towns upon the Nile, under the dominion of the Turks. But being at length subdued, and banished Egypt, they agreed to dis∣perse themselves in small parties, into every coun∣try of the known world; and as they were natives of Egypt, a country where the occult sciences, or black art, as it was called, was supposed to have arrived to great perfection, and which, in that cre∣dulous age, was in great vogue with persons of all religions and persuasions, they found no difficulty to maintain themselves, by pretending to tell for∣tunes and future events.</P>
<P>Jugglers, fortune-tellers, ballad-singers, and such sort of vermin, are still very common in
<PB N="81" REF="800"/>
Egypt as well as in other countries; but what seems peculiar to these of Egypt is, their dancing camels, which are taught to dance by being set upon a heated floor: this giving them a great deal of pain, they lift up their legs as if they were dancing, a fellow beating on a drum at the same time; hence, whenever the animal hears a drum, he falls a dancing. Their fortunetellers breed up birds, who are taught to carry little scrolls of pa∣per from their masters to those who come to en∣quire what luck they shall have, in which is found his good or bad fortune written, to which great faith is given.</P>
<P>The antient language of Egypt was the Coptic, which continued in use 'till the conquest of the country by Alexander the Great, who introduced the Greek among them, which continued to be spoken there above nine hundred years, that is, till the Greeks were driven out of it by the Arabs; since which the Arabesk, or vulgar Arabic hath been the common language in it; and next to that, the Turkish, modern Greek, and Coptic.</P>
<P>As to religion, the Turks, Moors, and Arabs, are Mohammedans, only it is observed, that the Moors and Arabs, who at present make up the bulk of the people, are much more superstitious and zealous in their way, than the other Moham∣medans; and have their santos or puritans among them, for whom they express an extraordinary ve∣neration; but the Turks despise these hypocrites. Many of these santos go perfectly naked about the streets, without the least rag to cover them, suffer∣ing the hair all over their bodies to grow to a great length. In this condition they visit the houses of persons of distinction, and sit down to dinner with them without any invitation, and leave their table with as little ceremony as they entered;
<PB N="82" REF="810"/>
and it is looked upon as no small blessing to a house to receive a visit from these people.</P>
<P>The antient Egyptians were the most supersti∣tious people in the world, and worshipped not on∣ly the planets, but several sorts of birds and beasts, as the crocodile, the ichneumon, the ibis, &amp;c. but the beast they most adored was a black ox, under the name of apis: nay they worshipped even in∣animate things, such as leeks and onions.</P>
<P>The Copts, who are supposed to be of the an∣tient Egyptian race, are a sort of Christians, ac∣cording to the heresy of Dioscorus, one of their antient patriarchs. It is generally held, that St. Mark first planted Christianity in this country, and was the first bishop of Alexandria, then the me∣tropolis of Egypt.</P>
<P>The jurisdiction of this bishop was settled by the council of Nice over all the churches of the diocese of Egypt, which included Lybia, Pentapolis, and Egypt properly so called; and afterwards the E∣thiopian or Abyssine churches became subject to the patriarch of Alexandria, and have ever since acknowledged a relation to him.</P>
<P>The Copts differ from the church of Rome in administering the sacrament of the Lord's supper in both kinds; and allow neither extreme unction, nor the eucharist to be administered to the sick. Neither do they agree with that church in the points of purgatory, or praying for the dead. They are however far from being orthodox Chris∣tians.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the ANTIENT HISTORY and present GO∣VERNMENT of EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>The Egyptians are certainly a very antient na∣tion, tho' far from being so antient as they make themselves, when they give us a catalogue of
<PB N="83" REF="820"/>
their princes, some of whom, according to them, must have lived several thousand years before the creation. But if, as hath been supposed by some, the Egyptians, by years, did not intend the periodical revolution of the sun, but only of the moon, their chronology in that case might be consistent enough with the scripture and truth; but otherwise, as hath been long since observed of the Chinese and other people, who run up their original so very high, it confutes itself, as no to∣lerable account or history is given us of those pre∣tended times; but on the contrary, the invention of all arts and sciences, even of agriculture, is placed about the same times as in our histories; which could not possibly have been the case, had the world been as old as they suggest, as it can not be conceived, how men could live any time in a regular society without them.</P>
<P>That this country was planted very early, and soon after the dispersion of the people at the tower of Babel cannot be disputed. Cham, or Ham, the son of Noah, is generally held to be the same with Jupiter Ammon; and Misraim his grandson, the same with Osiris, the great deity of the Egyptians; and from him, it is said, descended that race of monarchs, who had the general denomination of Pharaoh; but from whom, or how, that denomi∣nation took its rise, no satisfactory account can be given.</P>
<P>There are reckoned above sixty princes of the Iine of these Pharaohs, and they reigned, it is said, in an uninterrupted succession to the year of the world 3435, when Pharaoh Psammiticus, the se∣cond monarch of that name, was conquered by Cambyses II. king of Persia, who united Egypt to that empire, under which it remained till the reign of Darius, being upwards of a hundred years, when it revolted from that crown, and became
<PB N="84" REF="830"/>
again an independent kingdom under Amyrteus, in which state it continued about fifty years, when Ochus, king of Persia, recovered the dominion of it again; and it continued a part of that empire 'till Alexander the Great vanquished Darius, when it fell under the dominion of that prince, with the other provinces of the Persian empire.</P>
<P>After the death of Alexander, Ptolemy, the son of Lagus, or, as others insinuate, the son of Philip of Macedon, and consequently half-brother of A∣lexander, found means to mount the throne of Egypt, and render it an independent kingdom once again. His successors ever after retained the name of Ptolemy; and this line continued be∣tween two and three hundred years, the last so∣vereign being the famous Cleopatra, wife and sister to Ptolemy Dionysius, the last king, and successively mistress to Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.</P>
<P>It was Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of the first Ptolemy, who collected the Alexandrian library, said to consist of seven hundred thousand volumes, and the same prince caused the scriptures to be translated into Greek; but whether by seventy-two interpreters, and in the manner commonly related, is justly questioned. The Ptolemies sometimes extended their dominions over great part of Syria, and were frequently at war with the kings of Syria, in which they met with various success. After the death of Cleopatra this kingdom fell under the power of the Romans, and continued a Roman province 'till the reign of Heraclius, the emperor of Consiantinople; when the people, being disgust∣ed with their governor, called in Omar the third caliph of the Saracens, and submitted themselves to the Mohammedan power about the year 640. But surely the administration of the Greek emperors must have been grievous, which could induce a
<PB N="85" REF="840"/>
Christian nation to make choice of a Mohammedan for their sovereign.</P>
<P>The caliphs of Babylon were sovereigns here, till about the year 870, when the Egyptians set up a caliph of their own, called the caliph of Cairo, to whom the Saracens of Africa and Spain were sub∣ject; but the governors of the provinces, or sultans under the caliphs of Babylon and Cairo, soon wrested the civil power out of the hands of their caliphs, or high-priests, leaving them only a shadow of sovereignty.</P>
<P>About the year 1160 Assareddin, or Saracen, ge∣neral of Narradin, the Saracen sultan of Damascus, subdued the kingdom of Egypt, and usurped the dominion of it; being succeeded in the kingdom by his son Saladin, who reduced also the kingdom of Damascus, Mesopotamia, and Palestine, under his power; and about the year 1190, took Jeru∣salem from the Christians. It was this prince who established a body of troops in Egypt like the pre∣sent Janisaries, composed of the sons of Christians taken in war, and purchased of the Tartars, to whom he gave the name of Malmalukes, which signifies no more than slave. Among the forces in∣deed of the Mohammedan princes, the title of slave is very honourable, as denoting one who is entirely devoted to the service of the sovereign, and consequently is intitled to greater privileges than other subjects. The posterity of Assareddin enjoyed the crown till the year 1242, when the Mamalukes deposed Elmutan, as they had done his father Melech Assalach some years before, and set one of their own officers on the throne, whose name was Turquemenius. He, and his successors, were engaged in continual wars with the Christians in Syria and Palestine, till Araphus, the sixth sul∣tan, entirely dispossessed the Christians of the Holy Land. The ninth sultan, Melechnassar, subdued
<PB N="86" REF="850"/>
the island of Cyprus, and made it tributary to Egypt. About the year 1501, Campson Gaurus, the fifteenth sultan of the Mamalukes, entering in∣to an alliance with Ismael, the Sophi of Persia, against Selim III. emperor, and tenth king of the Ottoman family, the confederates received seve∣ral memorable defeats; and Tonombeius II. who succeeded Campson Gaurus, was deposed and murdered by Selim, and, according to some ac∣counts, hanged up at one of the gates of Grand Cairo. Gazelle, one of the grandees of the Ma∣malukes, maintained a war for some time against Selim, but was at length defeated, and Egypt made a province of the Ottoman empire. The Mamaluke sultans were always chosen by a majo∣rity of Mamalukes out of their own body, who were so jealous of the kingdom's being made he∣reditary, that they scarce ever elected the son of the preceding sultan; and if the choice ever happened to fall on such a one, they were so apprehensive of its being made a handle to introduce hereditary succession, that they never rested till they deposed him.</P>
<P>Since the Ottoman emperors have had the do∣minion of this kingdom, they have always govern∣ed it by a viceroy, stiled the bashaw of Grand Ca∣rio; but as Egypt is dwindled into several princi∣palities, the princes whereof are a sort of petty so∣vereigns in their respective territories, the bashaw transacts nothing of importance without their con∣currence. The grand seignior has never attempt∣ed to deprive these princes of their privileges, for fear of the revolt of this rich province, which is now esteemed the granary of Constantinople, as it was antiently of Rome; especially as the fertility of it is, in a great measure, owing to the right of inheritance which the Egyptians enjoy in their lands, in consequence of their being still governed
<PB N="87" REF="860"/>
by their own princes under the emperor; a right which very few of the subjects of the Porte enjoy besides. The Turkish government, therefore, takes care not to exasperate the Egyptians, by over∣loading them with taxes; so that, except what the viceroy, and his creatures, illegally extort from them, the whole revenue raised by the govern∣ment does not amount to a million of our money, of which two thirds are spent within the kingdom, and not more than one-third comes into the grand seignior's treasury.</P>
<P>The bassa of Grand Cario has a good body of janisaries, and other forces, under his command, the better to preserve the dependence of the Egyp∣tian princes on the Porte; but his policy in creating divisions among those princes, contri∣butes more to the establishment of his power than his army; and notwithstanding all the Turkish arts, those princes sometimes depose the bassa, and compel the grand seignior to send them another governor more acceptable to them. As to foreign enemies, the Egyptians have none at present; but they are frequently engaged in civil wars among themselves, or in contests with the Turkish bassas.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRAFFIC.</HEAD>
<P>The traffic of Egypt is chiefly carried on by the caravans. There is also a considerable ex∣portation from the towns situated on the Me∣diterranean, and from Suez on the Red Sea. Our Turky company have a consul at Cairo for the protection of their trade; which, besides the product of the country, consists chiefly in cof∣fee, frankinsence, gums, drugs, and other mer∣chandize, brought from Arabia, and the Eastern countries, which they export to Europe: but the ballance on the whole of the Levant trade is said to be greatly against us, or at least much less in our fa∣vour
<PB N="88" REF="870"/>
than it used to be, the French having sup∣planted us in a great measure. One of the princi∣pal manufactures of Egypt is sal-ammoniac, of the preparation of which we shall give an account af∣terwards.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular descrip∣tion of the three grand divisions mentioned above, namely, Lower, Middle, and Upper Egypt.</P>
<P>Lower Egypt, or Egypt properly so called, has the epithet of Power on account of its situation, in respect of the course of the Nile, it being the last of the three through which that river runs, and from which it discharges itself into the sea. It is bounded on the south by Middle Egypt; on the north by the sea; on the west by the desert of Bar∣ca; and on the east by the isthmus of Suez. This country is very fertile, and so well improved, that it abounds with pasture grounds, corn wine, rice, dates, senna, cassia, balm, medicinal drugs, plants, and some other valuable articles. The places of most note in this division are,</P>
<P>Alexandria, by the Turks called Scanderic, once the capitan of all Egypt, and a very celebrated city. It is well known that this city took its name from Alexander the Great, who coming to Rha∣cetis, after consulting the oracle of Jupiter Am∣mon, and being pleased with the situation of the place, ordered a new city to be built there. After the death of Alexander, the Ptolemies chose this city for the place of their resicence by which it became the metropolis of Egypt. On the shore, where the antient palace of the Ptolemies stood, are still to be seen great remains of stately build∣ings, with several pieces of porphyry, and other fine marbles. It is situated at the mouth of the Canopean branch of the Nile, where it forms a no∣ble spacious haven or bay, in the form of a cres∣cent,
<PB N="89" REF="880"/>
and which, though not very safe, is much frequented. In this bay, about nine hundred paces from the shore, lies the island of Pharos, extending from east to west, and forming two ports, one to the west, formerly called Funostus, and now the Old port; and another to the east, formerly called the Great port. and now the New. The sea has gained somewhat on the west end of the island. The famous light-house, named Pharos, from the island, stood on a rock at the east end of it, which was surrounded on all sides with water, so as to form a small separate island. Very few antient re∣mains, besides what we mentioned above, with a part of the walls, and Pompey's Pillar, are now to be seen here, having been either carried away to other places, or employed in building the present city. After the building of Alexandria, a great part of the trade from India came this way parti∣cularly what was carried on in the Persian Gulph, and on the coast of Malabar; for goods from thence, after having been brought up the Red Sea, and landed at Elam, now Suez, were conveyed from thence over land to the Nile, and then by water to Alexandria It is now little more than the skele∣ton of what it has been; but has still some trade, and is pretty populous. The discovery of the way to the East-Indies, by the Cape of Good-Hope, gave a great blow to the trade and gran∣deur of this city, as well as to that of Grand Cario, Rosetto, and Damietta. Pompey's Pillar, mention∣ed above, the finest piece of antiquity still re∣maining, stands about two hundred paces from the town: it was erected by Julius Caesar, in me∣mory of his victory over that great man, who fled hither from the battle of Pharsalia, and was mur∣dered on the Egyptian coast. The body of the pillar is one entire piece of granate marble, or some composition as durable and beautiful as marble.
<PB N="90" REF="890"/>
The height of it is seventy feet, and the circum∣ference twenty-five, with a noble capital and base, on which are several hieroglyphics.</P>
<P>The Nile formerly discharged itself into the sea by several mouths, besides two pseudo stomota, or false mouths, as they were called, which were too small to carry larger vessels: but most of these mouths have been since stopped up, and others formed; so that there are now reckoned to be above thirty channels, which carry the waters of the Nile into the sea, especially at its overflowing, the greater part of them becoming dry when the waters retire; the two chief, and indeed the only considerable arms at present, being that of Rosetta, or Rashid, to the west, and that of Damietta, or Dimyât, to the east.</P>
<P>Rosetto or Rosetta, called by the Arabs Rashîd, a healthy, pleasant, and populous city, giving name, as we observed just now, to one of the chief channels of the Nile. The chief business of the inhabitants is carrying the European merchan∣dizes, which are brought hither from Alexandria to Cairo in boats. For this purpose they have vice∣consuls and factors to expedite business, and all let∣ters and bills brought from Alexandria. Letters of consequence are conveyed by land across the de∣sert, by foot messengers, directly to Cairo. Near the city grows a great deal of the lotus.</P>
<P>Damietta, the antient Pelusium, standing on the other chief channel of the Nile, namely, that to the east, about an hundred miles from Rosetto, and about ten from the mouth of the channel. Though ill-built, it is large, antient, and populous, contain∣ing, exclusive of strangers, and a suburb on the other side of the river, inhabited by sailors and fish∣ermen, about twenty-five thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>Benalhassar, a village on the most easterly branch of the Nile, where the antient city of Bubastus is
<PB N="91" REF="900"/>
supposed to have stood, and where great ruins are still to be seen.</P>
<P>Aboasar, a village not far from the former, where the antient city Busiris is said to have stood.</P>
<P>The towns and villages between Damietta and Cairo, or Al-Kahira, lie pretty thick; and a good number of the inhabitants are employed, some in hatching vast multitudes of eggs in ovens, and rearing the chickens, and others in making great quantities of sal-ammoniac. This salt is procured from the soot which arises from the burnt dung of animals that feed only on vege∣tables; but the dung of these animals is only fit to be burnt for that purpose during the four first months of the year, when they feed on fresh spring grass, which in Egypt is a kind of trefoil or clover; for when they feed only on dry meat it will not do. The dung of oxen, buffaloes, sheep, goats, horses, and apes, at the proper time, is as fit as the dung of camels for this purpose. It is said, that even human dung is equal to any other. The soot arising from the burnt dung is put into glass ves∣sels, and these vessels into an oven or kiln, which is heated by degrees, and at last with a very strong fire, for three successive nights and days; after which, the smoke first shews itself, and, in a short time, the salt appears, adhering to the glasses, and by degrees covers the whole opening. The glasses being broken, the salt is taken out in the same state and form in which it is sent to Europe.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the Lower Egypt consists of that tract which is encompassed by the arms of the Nile, and called, from its triangular figure, the Delta. This tract, which is now the most fertile and populous in Egypt, it is said, was nothing but a standing pool, till the patriarch Joseph, by drain∣ing it of the water, and clearing it of the rushes and marshy weeds, rendered it fit for tillage. However,
<PB N="92" REF="910"/>
there are still several lakes in it, besides those that are in other parts of Egypt, affording great numbers of fish, though not or above seven or eight sorts; two or which they salt, and send large quantities to Syria, Cyprus, and Constantinople. The reve∣nue which one of these lakes alone, called Manza∣lah, brings into the Grand Signior's treasury, amounts to no less than forty thousand crowns a-year. Those who live near these lakes have great plenty of fresh fish, as the Israelites formerly had. Some Arabs divide the Deita into two parts, Al-Rif, and Al-Bahriya; the former of which, being the western part, is supposed by Bochart to be the Rachad of Scripture. In the Delta formerly, besides a great number of other celebrated cities, stood Tanis, supposed to be the Zoar of Scripture, which Moses says was built before Heb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on in Paiesline. He∣liopolis, or the City of the Sun, and commonly thought to be the On of Scripture, stood with∣out the Delta, about three miles from the river, towards the east.</P>
<P>Middle Egypt is situated between the Upper and Lower, having the former on the south, and the lat∣ter on the north, the Red Sea on the east, and the Desert of Barca on the west. Antiently it was chiefly known by the name of Heptanomis, from the seven nomes, or prefectures, into which it was divided; but, at present, by those of Bakeirah, and Benesor. It is parted into two by the Nile, on the banks of which the soil is fruitful; but sandy and barren the farther it is removed from that river. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Cairo, or Al Kahirah, the capital of all Egypt, and a very large and populous city, pleasantly situated on the Nile. It appears to have been for∣merly a place of extraordinary commerce, from the vast number of its squares, caravanseras, bazars, and other public buildings, now decayed, since the trade
<PB REF="920"/>
to the East-Indies hath been carried on by the way of the Cape of Good Hope; yet it is still famed for some manufactures, especially that of Turky carpets, and has a good trade by means of the ca∣ravans. It was founded in the year of the Hejra, or Hejira, 358, and the month of Ramadan, by Jawhar Al-Kayed, a Greek renegado and slave, omrah or general to Al Moezz Ledini'llah, the caliph of Mohdia or Mahdia, a part of Africa, so called by the Saracens from the city Mahadi. The name of Kahirah, or Al-Kahirah, given it by its founder, signifies the Victorious. The Turkish beglerbeg, or viceroy of the whole kingdom, re∣sides here in the castle, which stands on the top of a hill in the south quarter of the city, and commands a noble prospect of it and its environs. It is two or three miles in circumference, and looks like another city. There is a well in it two hundred and eighty feet deep, called Joseph's well, which, with another at Matarea, about five miles north-east of Cairo, are said to be the only ones that yield good water in the whole kingdom. At the last of these, it is reported, that the Virgin Mary, and her husband Joseph, rested, when they fled with our Saviour from Herod; and that, being very thirsty, a spring issued suddenly out of the earth for their relief. In the ruins of a noble building, which is pretended to be Joseph's hall, where he sat in judg∣ment, are shewn thirty fine pillars of Theban mar∣ble, with part of the roof, overlaid with gold and azure. Cairo is said to contain more than two millions of people. A caravan, consisting of thirty or forty thousand pilgrims, sets out from hence year∣ly for Mecca.</P>
<P>Old Cairo lies on the east side of the river, and is supposed to have been the antient Egyptian Ba∣bylon. Mr. Salmon, in his geography, mentions a holy cheat performed in a burying-place near it,
<PB N="94" REF="930"/>
on Good Friday, and the two preceeding days, an∣nually, by the Greek Christians, which some reckon among their curiosities, and others among their mi∣racles; namely, the resurrection of human bones, some say of whole limbs, and others of entire bodies, which, after they have made their appearance, re∣tire again to their graves.</P>
<P>Faiume, a considerable town, where are to be seen the ruins of the antient city of Arsinoe, which was first called the City of Crocodiles, because that animal was worshipped there.</P>
<P>Ensinel, a small town, where stood antiently the city of Antinoopolis, built by the emperor Adrian, in honour of his favourite Antinous, who, having attended him into Egypt, was here drowned.</P>
<P>In this division antiently, besides the above, and several other great cities, stood Memphis, supposed to have been built by Menes, the first king of Egypt, and for many years the metropolis of the whole kingdom; but there is not the least vestige of it now remaining.</P>
<P>Suez, a small city, from which the isthmus that joins Africa with Asia hath its name. It stands about thirty hours east from Cairo, by the road called Tauriche Beni Israel, i. e. the Road of the Children of Israel, at the bottom of the Heroo∣politan Gulph, or western branch of the Red Sea, and has about two hundred houses, and an old castle. Here also is a small haven, but so shallow that ships of any burden cannot get into it; howe∣ver, there is a good road by it, where they can ride safely, and at ease. The greatest inconvenience of the place is, that it has no sweet water nearer than four or five miles. We are even told, that there are not above half a dozen wells betwixt Cairo and Mecca, at least in the road the pilgrims go, which lies to the northward of this, and even these are bitterish and brackish. Suez was formerly a place
<PB N="95" REF="940"/>
of great trade, but since the way to the East-Indies by the Cape of Good Hope hath been discovered it hath been upon the decline. The place on the west coast of the gulph, where the Children of Is∣rael are supposed to have entered it, is called Ba∣deah, about six miles to the north of Cape Koron∣del, on the other side of the gulph, as we are informed in the above-mentioned letter from the ingenious Edward Wortley Montague, F. R. S. to Dr. Watson, containing an account of his journey from Cairo to the Written Mountains, in the Desert of Sinai. Opposite to Badeah is a strong current, which sets to the opposite shore, about south-east, with a whirlpool called Birque Pharaone, the Well or Pool of Pharaoh, being the place where his host is said to have been de∣stroyed. We are told by the same gentleman, that the Egyptian shore, from Suez to Badeah, is so rocky and steep, that there was no entering upon the gulph but at one of these two places; that it is high water in the gulph always when the moon is at her meridian height; that at Suez it flows six feet; that the spring tides are nine feet, and in the variable months, from the beginning of November to the end of April, sometimes twelve; that, from the beginning of May to the beginning of Octo∣ber, a northerly wind generally rises, and goes down with the sun, which is often very strong; that this wind never fails in these months, unless there be some violent storm; that the rest of the year the winds are variable, and, when they blow∣hard at south and south-south-east, set up the sea through the narrow Strait of Babel-Mandel, and up this western branch or gulph, through its mouth, between Gebel El-Zait on the west, and the south∣ern most point of the Bay of Tor on the east, where it is not above twelve or fourteen miles over. This wind, it is probable, hindering the water from going out, is the occasion of the extraordinary
<PB N="96" REF="950"/>
increase in the spring-tides. The same thing hap∣pens with the same winds at Venice, both gulphs running nearly in the same direction. The Egyp∣tian, Western, or Thebaic Shore, from Badeah southward, to opposite Tor on the eastern shore, is all mountainous and steep; and at Elim, the northernmost point of the bay of Tor, ends the ridge of mountains which begin on the eastern shore of this western branch at Karondel.</P>
<P>Mr. Montague tells us, that there are admirable forests of marine productions, particularly madrepo∣res, in the Heroopolitic or western branch; but not in the Elantic or eastern branch of the gulph, at least on the broad part of it below Cape Maho∣met. The name of Red Sea, however, seems to regard this part alone; for tho' the abovementioned sea productions are not found there, yet there is so great a quantity of the tube coral of a deep red, (not found in the western branch) and such rocks of it, as one may call them, that the Gedda ships fasten themselves to them, instead of casting anchor. The Red Sea is tempestuous and full of shoals. There is no harbour on the Arabian side except Tor, between Suez and Gedda, which is a day and a half from Mecca; nor is there any on the opposite coast besides Cossire, which is a very bad one: however, ships sometimes go thither, and caravans cross the country to Marshout. The ships used in the Red Sea have the helm on the out∣side, as it is supposed that in which St. Paul was pas∣senger had. They have only four sails, and no com∣pass, nor do they ever cast the lead. They sail only by day light, and from anchoring-place to anchoring∣place, and are not above two days out of sight of land from Cape Mahomet to the Arabian Main: if a gale happen, they are often lost; about one in ten every year. The antient city Heroopolis, from which the western branch or gulph takes its name, is supposed to have been situated near the
<PB N="97" REF="960"/>
north end of it, where the castle of Adgercoute, or Adjeroute now stands, and the city of Arsinoe, which is thought to have been the same as Cle∣opatris, where Suez is now; there being in that neighbourhood plain signs of an antient city. The antient cities of Myos, Albus Portus, and Berinice, stood also on the Egyptian coast of the Red Sea.</P>

<HEAD>The HIGHER or UPPER EGYPT.</HEAD>
<P>The province of the Higher or Upper Egypt, by the Greeks antiently called Thebais, from its capital Thebes, and in scripture Pathros, is bound∣ed on the east side by the Red Sea, all the way; on the north by the Middle Egypt; on the west by the desert of Barca; and on the south by Nu∣bia, and the coast of Abex. At present it is by far the least cultivated and populous of the three, but seems to have been far otherwise formerly; for there are amazing remains of antiquity in it, con∣sisting of magnificent marble pillars, obelisks, &amp;c. and those fine marble pillars and obelisks at Rome, are said to have been hewed out of the rocks in Upper Egypt. The chief of the modern places are,</P>
<P>Sayd, antiently Thebes, Hecatompylos, and Di∣ospolis, the capital of Upper Egypt, and one of the finest cities in the world, but now inconsider∣able. Here, as at many other places in this division, are vast columns of marble and porphyry, which lie half buried in the ground, and statues and obe∣lisks of a prodigious size, with hieroglyphics on them. At a place called Beban-el-Meluke, i. e. the gate or court of the kings, not far from hence, are to be seen the sepulchres of the kings of Thebes, lying in grottos, cut out of the rock in a most beautiful manner, with long rooms or galleries under the mountains. At a place in the same neighbourhood, towards Medinet-Habon, are the two colossal statues of Memnon, one of which
<PB N="98" REF="970"/>
hath been broken off at the middle, and built up with five tire of stones. Here are also the remains of two statues of black granite. One of these four is supposed to have been the famous statue of Memnon, which is said to have daily uttered a sound, as soon as it was touched by the rays of the rising sun.</P>
<P>Minio, a neat town, famous for an earthen ma∣nufacture of water-pots, or vessels, not only very curiously made, but said to give an uncommon freshness to the water, and on that account in great request all over Egypt, but especially at Cairo.</P>
<P>Mon-fa-lut, the most northern city of Al-sayd, situate on the western-side of the Nile, where the antient Lycopolis, or the city of the Wolves, is said to have stood.</P>
<P>Aboutig, a pretty large town, and bishop's see, thought to be the antient Hypsele.</P>
<P>El-berbi, a village three miles to the west of the river, where Abydus is supposed to have stood.</P>
<P>Hou, a town, where little Diospolis was former∣ly situated.</P>
<P>Amara, where the ruins of Tentyra are still to be seen, near the river Hermenthis, now Erment.</P>
<P>Esne, a town, three miles to the north-north-west of which are to be seen some ruins of Latopolis, where the fish latus was worshipped.</P>
<P>Etfou, where Great Appoullinopolis is thought to have been situated.</P>
<P>Elephantine, a considerable town in an island of that name.</P>
<P>Sciout, a large town, situate near a lake, where, as it is supposed, the antient city of Antaepolis stood.</P>
<P>Comombo, that is, the Hill of Ombo, antiently Onebos. Great ruins are seen near it. The in∣habitants of Onebos were famous for the worship of the crocodile. They fed them in their ponds, says Aelian, whereby they became so tame as to obey when they were called.</P>
<P>Gava-Kiebre, where the antient Passalus stood.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>ETHIOPIA, comprehending Nubia, Abys∣sina, Abesh or Abex, and Anian.</HEAD>
<P>The name of Ethiopia was given by the antients to all they knew of Africa to the south of Egypt, and that of Ethiopes to its inhabitants, from their swarthy or black complexions.</P>
<P>Ethiopia is bounded to the north by Egypt and the desert of Barca; to the south by Zan∣guebar and Caffraria; to the east by the Red Sea and the Eastern Ocean; and to the west by Guinea, Nigritia, and Zaara.</P>
<P>Nubia, which constitutes the first division of it, mentioned above, is bounded towards the north by Egypt; on the south by Abyssinia; on the east by the coast of Abesh or Abex; and to the west by Zaara and Nigritia. It is said to be four hundred leagues in length, and two hundred in breadth; but these dimensions cannot be de∣pended on, little being certainly known by our best historians or geographers, with respect to this and the other inland countries of Africa.</P>
<P>This country, we are told, is watered by a river that falls into the Nile, and abounds in gold, musk, sandal-wood, ivory, elephants, horses, camels, lions, and such other animals as are found in the neighbouring country of Abyssinia; but they give us not the least information with respect to its con∣stitution and government, tho' it is probable, it is
<PB N="100" REF="990"/>
divided into a number of petty kingdoms and states, because we hear so little of the inhabitants. The same uncertainty we meet with in regard to their religion; but it is probable Paganism, Ju∣daism, Christianity, and Mahommedism, have their several votaries here, as they all have in some or other of the countries that surround them.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ABYSSINIA.</HEAD>
<P>Abyssinia has now little communication with the rest of the world, the Turks having possessed them∣selves of Abex, which runs along the western coast of the Red Sea, and the rest of it being sur∣rounded with mountains. Within these it appears to be an exceeding fine country, diversified with woods and fruitful plains, well planted with palm∣trees, dates, and cedars, and watered with several noble rivers, particularly the Nile, which runs thro' the midst of it, and having first taken a circuit al∣most round its source, runs a hundred miles to the northward, and afterwards two hundred miles towards the east; then turning to the south and south-east, continues its course two hundred and fifty miles farther. In this course it forms the lake Dambea, a hundred and twenty miles in cir∣cuit. From thence it takes a semicircular sweep of five hundred miles, and then turning directly north, enters the kingdom of Egypt. This wind∣ing course not only spreads fertility all over the country, but is of great service to inland com∣merce; tho' after the Nile enters Egypt, there are so many steep falls and cataracts, that the river is no longer properly navigable for the purposes of traffic. Being swelled by the rains, which annually fall at a certain season between the tropics, it overflows all the lower grounds that border on it; and this is the case of all the rivers within the tropics, tho' the antients knew it not, and for that reason were so much at a loss to account for the periodical in∣undations
<PB N="101" REF="1000"/>
of the Nile in Egypt. Tho' the moun∣tains of Abyssinia send down prodigious torrents during the periodical rains, when the sun is verti∣cal, yet the inhabitants reap this among other ad∣vantages from them, that they furnish them with cool retreats, during the excessive heats of sum∣mer. As for the vallies, being rendered fruitful by the annual rains, they produce plenty of corn, rice, millet, dates, grapes, flax, cotton, sugar, and fruits proper for the climate. Their flax is esteemed the finest in the world; and from hence it is said the Egyptians had theirs, of which they made the fine lin∣en of Egypt, mentioned in Scripture: and had they, at this day, an opportunity of exporting the pro∣duce of their soil, this district alone, it is thought, might raise rice, sugar, and other commodities, sufficient to serve all the neighbouring countries. The Turks, who are masters of the coast of the Red Sea, tho' they will suffer no other nation to trade to Abyssinia, annually export great quantities of rice from hence, particularly at the time of the great pilgrimages to Mecca, Arabia not affording pro∣vision sufficient for their subsistence. Gold also is very plentiful here, of which the Turks get some; and had the Ethiopians an opportunity of bartering it for the merchandize of Europe, it is thought we might meet with as great plenty of it here as any where, tho' none of the gold mines are wrought at present, but only those of silver and copper. Among other precious stones, they have the largest emeralds in the world.</P>
<P>Their cattle are camels, dromedaries, elephants, oxen, sheep, mules, asses, all in great plenty, and very large; their wild beasts are such as are com∣mon to the rest of Africa; but what they are most famous for is, an excellent breed of horses, equal to those of Arabia; or, as some conjecture, those of Arabia are in reality bred in Abyssinia, where they abound in rich pastures. The zebra also, or
<PB N="102" REF="1010"/>
wild ass, such as that which some years ago was presented to our queen, and so much admired for its beauty, is said to be among the animals of this country, and another called by the inhabitants giratacachem, or slender tail, supposed to be the struthio camelus, or camelopardus, or panther ca∣mel mentioned by the antients. The lake Dambea is said to breed great numbers of sea-horses, which come sometimes to land, and do a deal of mischief. They are often infested with prodigious flights of locusts, or grashoppers, in this country, which cover the surface of the earth, and in a very short time devour every blade of grass to the very root. They are large and good to eat, and probably such as John the Baptist made use of for that purpose in the wilderness of Judea. Some even imagine, that they are the shelaw, which we translate quails, brought to the Israelites in the deserts of Sinai. In this country are also a great number of flying and other serpents, particularly one sort, which is so much of the colour of the dust or sand in which it lurks, and on which it feeds, that it is not easily avoided, tho' its sting is attended with immediate death, of the most painful and dreadful kind, both to man and beast. The winds are sometimes very terrible here, and do a great deal of mischief, as well as the rains, thunders, and lightnings.</P>
<P>The Abyssinians are of a deep black complexion, but of a good stature, and their features regular; they are not at all like the negroes of Guinea and the south of Africa, who have generally flat noses, thick lips, and very shocking countenances, in the opinion of the white people. The olive among the Abyssinians is reckoned the finest complexion, and next to that the jet black. The better sort of them are clothed in vests made of silks, stuffs, or cotton, after the manner of the Franks in Turky; but their poor people go almost naked, having
<PB N="103" REF="1020"/>
only a small piece of skin or coarse stuff, wrapped about their waists. They are said to have a great deal of vivacity and natural wit; to be of a teach∣able disposition, and fond of learning, tho' they have but few opportunities of improving them∣selves. They have no other bread but cakes bak∣ed on the hearth. They eat all manner of flesh but swine-flesh, and such other meats as were pro∣hibited to the Jews. They abstain also from things strangled, and from blood, killing their meat and draining the blood from it, as the Jews do. Their great men are above feeding themselves, but are fed by their servants with spoons. Their usual drink is mead, or metheglin, their country abound∣ing in honey. They have also liquor made of wheat or rice. The women are delivered here without any help, having nothing to do but kneel down; but easy labours are not confined to the Abyssinian women, being common to all in those hot climates, except where their recluse and seden∣tary life makes them otherwise.</P>
<P>The sovereign of this country was once abso∣lute; but the government now appears to be a republic, or rather a mixed monarchy, in which the prince's power is extremely limited by the great men, without whom the king can transact no∣thing of any consequence. As to the common people, it is not material, whether the power is lodged in the king or the grandees, for they are all slaves either to the one or the other. The king, by his own subjects, is stiled negus or king; but oftener negascha, negascht, which in their language signifies king of kings, to distinguish him from the princes and governors of provinces, who are stiled also negus. This prince pretends to be descended by lineal succession from the great Solomon, king of the Jews, by Makedda, or as Josephus calls her, Nizauce, queen of the south,
<PB N="104" REF="1030"/>
who paid him that grand visit, mentioned 2 <HI>Kings</HI> x. The king is most of the year in the field, attend∣ed by great bodies of horse and foot, while he makes a tour thro' some part of his dominions in much the same manner as the Great Mogul. It is said there are no fortresses or walled towns in the whole empire.</P>
<P>The religion of the Abyssinians seems to be a mixture of Christianity and Judaism; but they seem to adhere more to the Greek Church, than the Latin, and greatly to resemble the Copts of Egypt, both in their tenets and forms. They keep both the Jewish and Christian sabbaths, cir∣cumcise not only the males, but the females the eighth day, and baptize them a fortnight after. They reject the doctrine of transubstantiation, pur∣gatory, divine service in an unknown tongue, au∣ricular confession, the use of images in the church, celibacy of priests, extreme unction, &amp;c. They have but two sacraments, viz. baptism and the eucharist, and give the bread and cup both to clergy and laity. They have neither archbishops, bishops, nor any order superior to priests, except their abbuna, or suffragan to the patriarch of A∣lexandria, and the superiors or abbots of the se∣veral societies of monks, who have some authority over them. These monks do not live in cloisters, or convents, but every one in his own hut, form∣ing a kind of village near some church, where they perform divine service by turns: their inferior orders below the priest or presbyter, are the sub-presbyter, deacon, and sub-deacon. The monks never marry. Polygamy is prohibited by their laws, but generally practised. The king has at least a hundred wives and concubines, and every great man as many as he pleases. They have no particular funeral service, but the priests read over some passages in the psalms suitable to the occasion.
<PB N="105" REF="1040"/>
The deceased is laid in the grave without a coffin, and his relations mourn several months in rags, and a neglected dress. They rend their cloaths upon re∣ceiving ill news, and other melancholy occasions, as many of the antients did.</P>
<P>The eunuch, prime-minister of queen Candace, who was converted to Christianity, and baptised by St. Philip, is supposed to have come from this country, and to have introduced Christianity into it. Ethiopia was then a mighty empire, subject to one sovereign, who commanded the sea-coast, as well as the inland country. When the Portu∣guese missionaries resorted to Ethiopia, towards the latter end of the 15th century, they brought over a great many of the Ethiopians to their religion, and persuaded the emperor not only to acknowledge the pope's supremacy, but to admit a patriarch among them, sent thither from Rome. The go∣vernment also consented to abolish their antient rites and ceremonies, and conform entirely to the ritual of the Latin church; but many of the nobi∣lity, and governors of the provinces, with the greater part of the common people, having the greatest abhorrence of these innovations, rose in arms against their emperor, which occasioned civil wars in Ethiopia, that lasted upwards of a hundred years, wherein many thousands fell on both sides. But tho' the court, with the assistance of the Jesuits, European engineers, and some Portuguese troops, was generally victorious, yet the bulk of the peo∣ple still adhered to their antient religion; and se∣veral provinces revolted entirely from the em∣peror. However, the Ethiopian emperors conti∣nued still to profess the tenets of the Latin church, and to submit to the dictates of Rome; 'till at length the Jesuits, under pretence of maintaining the pope's ecclesiastical jurisdiction, took upon them to direct most secular affairs, treating the
<PB N="106" REF="1050"/>
prince rather as a viceroy to the pope, than so∣vereign of the country; and having erected and garrisoned several forts, were sending for European forces to maintain their usurped power, when the emperor, as well as the nobility, taking the alarm, agreed at once to abolish popery, and restore their antient religion. The Romish priests were here∣upon generally sacrificed to the fury of the peo∣ple, their patriarch very narrowly escaping out of the country with his life: and, when afterwards three Capuchins came to Squaquena on the Red Sea, from whence they sent letters to the emperor of Ethiopia to obtain leave to come into his territories again, that prince requested the Turkish bassa, who commanded on the coast, to suffer no Franks to come that way into his territories, and to send him the heads of these Capuchins. In this the bassa not only gratified him, but sent him their skins flea'd off and stuffed, that he might know them to be Franks by their colour, and priests by their shaved crowns. Thus have the Romish missionaries procured themselves to be banished out of almost every country where they have planted their religion. They have indeed by their skill in medicine and mathematics, and an artful address, insinuated themselves into the courts of many great princes; but their ill-advised advancing of the pope's supremacy to an extravagant height, together with their endeavours to controul the go∣vernment in civil as well as ecclesiastical affairs, has ever occasioned their expulsion. Thus it was in Japan, where the emperor finding them en∣croaching upon his civil authority, ordered every Christian in his dominions to be massacred, and that no Christian should ever set foot there a∣gain. This also has put a stop to their progress in China, and occasioned very severe persecutions of the Christians there; and now we find the whole
<PB N="107" REF="1060"/>
order in a fair way of being entirely suppressed in Europe, having been already expelled from Portu∣gal, France, Spain, Naples, and the dutchy of Par∣ma. As the knights templars in the 14th century, by their insolence, brought all the Christian princes in Europe to concur in extirpating them, so have the Jesuits by their restless ambition, and intermed∣dling in secular affairs.</P>
<P>As to the trade and manufactures of the Abyssi∣nians, we are told, that they have the silks, stuffs, ca∣licoes, linen, and carpets, which they use for furni∣ture or cloathing, from the Turks, by the way of the Red Sea; who take the gold and emeralds of Abyssinia in return for their merchandize, with some fine horses. The brokers or merchants, be∣tween the Turks and Abyssinians, are Jews, Ara∣bians, or Armenian Christians; for few or none of the natives trade, or travel abroad. The Jews also are said to be the only weavers and smiths amongst them; and as for other handicrafts, such as carpenters, taylors, and shoemakers, every man breeds up his children to the trade or profession that he uses himself. There are particular families whose business it is to make trumpets, horns, &amp;c. and those several trades, like the casts or tribes in the East-Indies, live separately, and do not intermix with any other trade or tribe, either by marriage or otherwise. When the Portuguese first found the way to Abyssinia, the shores of the Red Sea were open; but now the Turks keep such a strict guard there, that it is difficult for any other people to have access to them.</P>
<P>All that we have to add concerning Abyssinia is, that the sons of the emperor succeed according to their seniority, as do those of the nobility who have estates in fee; but the rest of the peo∣ple have no inheritance of their lands, nor can dispose of their estates or effects but by the per∣mission
<PB N="108" REF="1070"/>
of the emperor, or their respective lords. The Persians give the former the title of pat sha, the disposer of kingdoms, which is the highest title known in Asia, and equal to that of emperor in Europe. But every one of these princes, at his ac∣cession to the throne, assumes a particular title: one stiles himself the pillar of faith; another, the Vir∣gin's incense; and another, the beloved of God, sprung from the stock of Judah, the son of Da∣vid, the son of Solomon, &amp;c. The arms of the emperor are a lion rampant, holding a cross, with this motto, <HI>Vicit leo di tribu Judah,</HI> i. e. The lion of the tribe of Judah overcame.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ABEX or ABESH, and ANIAN.</HEAD>
<P>Abex or Abesh, and Anian, are bounded on the north and west by Egypt and Abyssinia; on the east by the Red Sea, and the Indian, Ethiopic, or Eastern Ocean; and on the south by Zanguebar; extending from the fifth degree of north latitude to the twentieth.</P>
<P>Anian lies upon the Eastern Ocean. It is a barren sandy desert, and excessive hot, containing scarce any towns, and very few people, except some Arab tribes, that live in camps; and these, in all parts of Africa, are of a tawny complexion, but not black. The chief place of it is Adea.</P>
<P>The Turks are masters of the coasts of Abesh, to the northward of Anian, and keep strong garri∣sons in Suaquem and Arquico, which are the two principal ports, and about an hundred and fifty miles distant from each other. The country is said to be a populous fruitful tract, abounding with plenty of most things.</P>

<HEAD>ZANGUEBAR.</HEAD>
<P>Under the name of Zanguebar may be included all the rest of the eastern coast of Africa, extending
<PB N="109" REF="1080"/>
from 5°. north to 28°. south, and comprehending the countries of Magadoxa, Melinda, Mombaza, Quiloa, Mosambique, and Sofala. All the people upon this coast are either in alliance with, or subject to the Portuguese.</P>
<P>Magadoxa is a barren country, affording scarce any merchandize, or cattle, unless a good breed of horses, which the natives, a mixture of Pagans, Mohammedans, and Christians, sell to the Portu∣guese, who dispose of them again to the Arabs.</P>
<P>Melinda, tho' it lies near the equator, is exceed∣ing pleasant, fruitful, and healthful, being frequent∣ly refreshed with showers, and fine sea breezes. The city of the same name, and the capital of the Por∣tuguese dominions in this part of the world, is situated in two degrees and an half south latitude, on an island at the mouth of a river also of the same name. It is a large populous place, well built, and has a good harbour, commanded by a strong citadel. It is said, the inhabitants of the city, and the little island on which it stands, do not amount to less than two hundred thousand souls, a great part of whom are Christians. The public buildings, consisting of seventeen churches, nine religious houses, the governor's palace, the maga∣zine, and town-hall, exceed any thing of the kind that is to be found in Africa. The warehouses are stocked with all sorts of European goods, with which the Portuguese trade with the natives for gold, elephants teeth, slaves, ostrich feathers, wax, senna, aloes, civet, ambergrease, and frankincense. The country produces also rice, millet, sugar, and fruits; and the Portuguese export great quantities of rice to their other settlements, besides what they use themselves.</P>
<P>Mombaza, taking its name from its capital, lies to the south of Melinda, and is much of the same nature with respect to its soil, produce, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="1090"/>
Quiloa lies to the south of Mombaza, and is said to enjoy a fruitful soil, but an unwholesome air. A considerable part of the country consists of an island. The king, we are told, pays a tribute in gold to the Portuguese, amounting to the value of an hundred thousand crusadoes per annum. Excel∣lent sugars are produced here; but the Portuguese seek not to improve them, on account of the un∣healthfulness of the climate. Most of the people of Quiloa are idolaters, and the rest Mohammedans.</P>
<P>Mosambique lies south of Quiloa, taking its name from the chief town, which is situated on an island, at the mouth of a river of the same name, in 15°. south latitude. The island is thirty miles in circumference, and very populous, though the air is said to be very hot, and the soil in general dry, sandy, and barren; yet they have most of the tro∣pical fruits, with black cattle, hogs, and sheep. There is a kind of fowl here, both the feathers and flesh of which are black, insomuch that, when they are boiled, the broth looks like ink; and yet their flesh is very delicate, and good food. The town of Mosambique is regularly fortified, and has a good harbour, defended by a citadel, with several churches and monasteries. The Portuguese ship∣ping, to and from India, touch here for refresh∣ments. As the island abounds in cattle, the Portu∣guese slaughter and salt up a great deal of beef, which they afterwards send to the Brasils, or sell to the European shipping. They also barter Eu∣ropean goods with the natives for gold, elephants teeth, and slaves. There is another town, called Mongale, situated also on an island, and garrison∣ed by the Portuguese, being their chief magazine for European goods. The gold they receive from the natives is found near the surface of the earth, or in the sands of rivers; no gold mines, or at least very few, being at present wrought in Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="1100"/>
Sofala lies south of Mosambique. From the mouth of the river of the Holy Ghost to Cape Co∣rientes, the land is very level, barren, and desert; but from that cape to the mouth of the river Cu∣mena, the country is both fruitful and populous. The coast is very low, and mariners discover their approach to it not so much by their sight as smell, because it abounds with fragrant flowers. The inhabitants assert, that their gold mines yield a∣bove two millions of metigets per annum, each amounting to about twelve shillings sterling; that the ships from Zedein and Mecca carry off above two millions a-year, in time of peace; and that the governor of Mosambique, whose office lasts but three years, has above three hundred thousand crowns revenue, exclusive of the soldiers pay and the king of Portugal's tribute. From hence Mo∣quet concludes, that this is the Ophir whither Solomon sent ships, every three years, from Ezion∣geber, to fetch gold; Eziongeber being thought by many to be the town now called Suez, at the bottom of the Heroopolitan gulph of the Red Sea. This conjecture is supported by several edi∣fices that seem to have been built by foreigners: some think it is also confirmed by the authority of the Septuagint, in which Ophir is translated by the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, Sopheira; and since liquids are of∣ten put for one another, Sopheira does not differ much from Sofala: besides, Thomas Lopez, in his Indian voyage, relates, that the inhabitants of this country boast, that they have books which prove that, in the time of Solomon, the Israelites made a voyage thither, every third year, to fetch gold. The inhabitants of Melinda, Mombaza, and Quiloa, come to this country in little boats, called zambues, with stuffs of blue and white cottons, silk stuffs, yellow and red ambergrease, which they exchange here for gold and ivory; and the natives sell them again to the people of Monomotopa, who give
<PB N="112" REF="1110"/>
them gold in return, without weighing it. It is said, when the Sofalese see ships coming, they light up fires, to signify that they shall be welcome. The capital city here, and the only one of note, is also called Sofala. It stands on a river of the same name, about six leagues from the sea-coast. The Portuguese have been masters of it ever since the year 1500, and have built a strong fortress. Their chief trade consists in ambergrease, gold, slaves, and silk stuffs. There are also some mines lying to the south of the town that are said to be worked. Sofola is a country of great extent, but little known to any Europeans except the Portuguese, who appear to be wiser in relation to the conduct of their trade in Africa than any other of the European potentates; for, not content with erecting a few forts and facto∣ries, they have settled upon the continent in great numbers, and brought the natives to clothe them∣selves according to the European mode; which has created a very considerable and profitable com∣merce to them.</P>

<HEAD>MONOEMUGI.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Monoemugi has Zanguebar on the east; Monomotopa on the south; Motam∣ba and Makoka on the west; and Abyssinia on the north, and partly, as it is supposed, on the west, though its boundaries that way cannot be exactly ascertained. It is of great extent, being di∣vided into several lesser kingdoms or principalities; as those of Mujaco, Anzico, Gingiro, Cambate, Alaba, and Monoemugi Proper.</P>
<P>Mujaco borders eastward on Congo, and the in∣habitants of the latter travel to the former for ele∣phant's teeth.</P>
<P>In Anzico the people do not till the ground, nor have they any property or settled habitation, but, like
<PB N="113" REF="1120"/>
the Arabs, wander from place to place, and subsist by plunder. They traffic with the kingdom of Angola, exchanging slaves for salt, glass beads, silk, knives, and other wares.</P>
<P>Gingiro is a very potent kingdom. The king's state is extraordinary great. It is said, that he ne∣ver goes abroad, or gives audience, after sun-rising, alledging, that two suns ought not to appear at once; and when he buys any thing of foreign mer∣chants, he pays them in slaves, which he takes at plea∣sure from any family, without contradiction; and yet, it seems, his palace is no better than a cottage.</P>
<P>Cambate, we are told, pays some acknowledge∣ments to the emperor of Abyssinia, which, howe∣ver, are only voluntary.</P>
<P>Alaba is a large kingdom, inhabited by a cruel people, called Galas. The prince is said to be a Mohammedan; but many of his subjects are idola∣ters of the worst sort, offering human sacrifices to their idols, and sparing none that dare travel through their country.</P>
<P>Monoemugi Proper abounds with gold, silver, copper mines, and elephants. The natives clothe themselves in silks and cottons, which they buy of strangers, and wear collars of transparent amber beads, brought them from Cambaya, which serve also for money; gold and silver being too com∣mon, and of little value among them. The mo∣narch always endeavours to be at peace with the princes round about him, to keep open the trade with Melinda, Mombaza, and Quiloa, on the east, and with Congo on the west, from all which the black merchants resort hither for gold. This country affords also abundance of palm-wine, and oil, and such great plenty of honey, that above one half of it is lost, the blacks not being able to consume it. The air is generally very unwhole∣some, and excessively hot, which is the reason that no Europeans venture to travel into this country:
<PB N="114" REF="1130"/>
besides, some of the tribes that inhabit it are said to be cannibals.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MONOMOTOPA.</HEAD>
<P>Monomotopa, another inland country in this part of Africa, has the maritime kingdom of Sofa∣la on the east; the mountains of Caffraria on the west; the river del Spiritu Santo on the south; and the river Cuama on the north, which parts it from Monoemugi. The air of this country is said to be very temperate, and the soil fertile, being wa∣tered by several rivers, on the banks of which grow many fine trees and sugar-canes, without any culture. The inhabitants are rich in black cattle, which they value more than gold; but have no beasts of burden, excepting elephants, of which they have abundance, as appears from the great quantity of ivory brought from hence. Here are many gold mines, and the rivers that run through their veins carry a great deal of gold-dust along with their streams. The emperor of Monomo∣topa drinks nothing but mead, or palm-wine, per∣fumed with musk and amber. None but perfumed flambeaux are burnt before him. He never stirs out of his palace, but they kill a beast, and, whilst he steps over it, his courtiers make loud acclama∣tions, and observe the motions of the entrails of the victim, that the priests may better tell his ma∣jesty's fortune. He commonly wears by his side a hedging-bill with an ivory handle, and two arrows in his hands. He has above a thousand wives; but one only is queen, and her eldest son heir to the crown. The inhabitants, we are told, go na∣ked, from the waist upwards; but about their waists they wear a piece of coloured cloth, and put their privities into a gourd bottle, especially when they go abroad, and are afraid of being stung by
<PB N="115" REF="1140"/>
some venemous insects. Persons of quality wear over their other garments hides, with long tails hanging down to the ground. White is the mourn∣ing of this country. No man appears before the emperor, or the great men with whom he has any business, without a present.</P>
<P>The arms of the inhabitants are a bow and ar∣row, darts, poignards, cutlasses, and sabres. We are told, there is a warlike sort of women here, who, like the antient Amazons, cut off their left breasts, that they may shoot their arrows with more freedom. They carry the same arms as the men, and shoot backward, while they pretend to be retiring, like the Parthians of old; but, when their pursuers are near, they face about upon them, and kill all that oppose them. It is said, the Monomotopans have a barba∣rous custom of cutting off the privy members of the prisoners they take in war, and making chains of them for their wives. When, upon a trial, it ap∣pears doubtful whether the person charged is guil∣ty or not, they make use of a liquor, which if any one drinks without harm, he is accounted inno∣cent; but if he vomits, they reckon him guilty.</P>
<P>Monomotopa is divided into seven provinces or petty kingdoms, vassals to the emperor. Manica, situated to the south of the river del Spiritu Santo, is the capital town.</P>

<HEAD>CAFFRARIA.</HEAD>
<P>Caffraria is a very large country, extending from Cape Negro, on the coast of Africa, in 15°. 30′. south latitude, to that of Good Hope, at the ex∣tremity of Africa towards the south, near 20°. or twelve hundred English miles; from the Cape of Good Hope to the mouth of the river del Spiritu Santo, on the eastern coast, in about 25°. south la∣titude, or eight hundred and fifty miles; and from
<PB N="116" REF="1150"/>
the same cape almost to the equinoctial line, about 29°. or one thousand seven hundred and forty miles. Its greatest breadth, from Cape St. Tome to the mouth of the above-mentioned river, is about nine hundred miles; but from the tropic of Cancer up to the equinoctial line, being pent in, its breadth is not much above six hundred miles. It has Congo or Lower-Guinea, with the kingdom of Binguela, on the north-west; Monomotopa on the north-east, from which it is separated by the river del Spiritu Santo; and on the north, where it extends almost to the equator, Monoemugi. On the other sides, it is bounded by the Indian and At∣lantic Oceans. Martiniere observes, that Caffraria is not properly the name of any particular country; and that there is no nation called Caffres, that be∣ing an opprobious appellation given by the Arabs to all those who are not of the Mohammedan reli∣gion. It is derived from the Arabic word Cafir, which signifies an infidel or unbeliever. The Por∣tuguese, taking the name in a more general sense, call all those nations of Africa Caffres who have, or or seem to have, no knowledge of a deity.</P>
<P>Caffraria may be divided into the kingdom of Mataman, the country of the Hottentots, Terra de Natal, and Terra de Fumos.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MATAMAN.</HEAD>
<P>Mataman is bounded on the north by the king∣dom of Benguela; on the east and south by the ri∣ver Bravahul; and on the west by the Ethiopic Ocean. It extends from Cape Negro, in south la∣titude 16°. 30′. to the mouth of the river Bravahul, beyond the tropic of Capricorn, in south latitude 24°. so that its greatest length, from north to south, is about four hundred and fifty English miles: but its greatest breadth, from west to east, is not a∣bove two hundred and sixty. All along the sea∣coast the air is excessive hot, the land barren and
<PB N="117" REF="1160"/>
sandy, and the harbours bad and little frequented; but two hundred miles to the west of Cape Negro, the climate is pretty temperate, and the soil fruit∣ful, producing a great variety of provisions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTRY of the HOTTENTOTS.</HEAD>
<P>The Country of the Hottentots is bounded on the north-west by part of the river Bravahul; on the north it extends to the tropic of Capricorn; on the north-east the river del Spiritu Santo parts it from the empire of Monomotopa; on the east and south it has the Eastern Ocean; and on the west the Ethiopic Ocean.</P>
<P>The air of this country would be excessive hot, especially in the vallies, if it was not for the vast Southern Ocean, from which the wind blows al∣most on every side; and they are scarce ever free from storms a week, which raise the waves of this extensive ocean to so vast a height, that they are, in a literal sense, frequently mountains high, such as we never see in this part of the world. But, though these storms are troublesome, they make the country very healthful. If they happen to have a calm of any duration, all the people are troubled with the head-ach; but many rich ships have been cast away by these storms upon the coast, where there are hardly any harbours. The Dutch at the Cape sometimes lose whole fleets, as they lie at anchor before the town, and they are forced to moor their guardship with strong chains, instead of cables.</P>
<P>Caffraria is a mountainous country, but the soil, at least about the Cape of Good Hope, is exceed∣ing fruitful. Of the mountains, there are three near the Cape, very high; viz. the Table Moun∣tain, the Sugar-Loaf, and James Mountain, or the Lion's Rump. The top of the first is always covered with a cap of clouds before a storm: the second takes its name from its form.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="1170"/>
It does not appear that there are any navigable rivers here; but a great many brooks and rivulets descend from the mountains, and render the vallies exceeding fruitful: one of these, descending from the Table-Mountain, runs through the company's garden at the Cape. A great part of the inland country is said to be over-run with woods and forests.</P>
<P>Among the wild beasts in Caffraria are lions, tigers, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, elks, ze∣bras, and porcupines. There is also an animal, called by the Dutch a sea-cow; but it always feeds on grass ashore, according to Kolben, and only runs to the sea for its security. The head re∣sembles that of a horse more than a cow, and it seems to be the same with the Egyptian hippopo∣tamos.</P>
<P>Another animal, called by the Dutch the stink∣bingsern, seems to be peculiar to the Hottentot country, and to have obtained its name from the stinking scents it emits from its posteriors, which are such that neither man nor beast can bear them. This is the creature's best defence when it is pur∣sued: the very dogs will desert the chace, rub their noses, and howl, when the beast evacuates; and a man is perfectly stifled with the nauseous stench.</P>
<P>The shin-bones of the lion, it is said, are as hard, and as solid as flint, atter they are dried, and used in the same manner to strike fire with. When he falls upon a man or beast, he first knocks them down with his paw, and deprives them of all sen∣sation, before he touches them with his teeth, roaring most terribly at the time he gives the mortal blow.</P>
<P>The elephants of this part of Africa are very large, their teeth weigh from sixty to one hun∣dred and twenty pounds, and their strength is scarce to be conceived. One of them being yoked to a ship, that was careening at the Cape,
<PB N="119" REF="1180"/>
fairly drew it along the shore. They are from twelve to fifteen feet in height, and some say a great deal more; the female is much less than the male, and hath its breasts or dugs between its fore∣legs: their usual food is grass, herbs, and roots, and the tender twigs of trees and shrubs: they pull up every thing with their trunk, which serves as a hand to feed themselves with; they also suck up water with it, and empty it into their mouths.</P>
<P>The rhinoceros is something less than the ele∣phant, but of equal if not greater strength; at least the elephant runs away and avoids him, whenever he discovers him. With his rough prickly tongue he licks the flesh off the bones of an animal. The African rhinoceroses are said to have two horns, or horny substances, on their nose or snout.</P>
<P>The elk has a fine slender neck, and a beautiful head, not much unlike that of a deer.</P>
<P>European asses are common at the Cape; and as for the zebra, or wild ass, many people in Eng∣land have had an opportunity of seeing that beau∣ful one presented some years ago to the queen.</P>
<P>The Dutch have replenished their settlements at the Cape with European hogs, as well as those of the Indian black breed, without bristles, whose bellies almost touch the ground.</P>
<P>There is a species of eagles here, called dung∣birds, which, if they find an ox or cow laid down, will fall upon it in great numbers, and having made a hole in the belly of it with their bills and talons, will perfectly scoop out the inside of it, and leave nothing but a bare skeleton covered with the hide.</P>
<P>With respect to the natives of this country, cal∣led Hottentots, they are of a middling stature, and well made, seldom either too fat or lean, and scarce ever crooked; they disfigure their children them∣selves, by flatting and breaking the grisles of their
<PB N="120" REF="1190"/>
noses, looking on a flat nose as a beauty; their eye-brows are large, their eyes black, their lips thick, their hair like that of the negroes, short, black, and curled; and they have exceeding white teeth. They resemble the negroes also pretty much in colour, after they have taken a great deal of pains with grease and soot to darken their na∣tural tawny complexions.</P>
<P>They besmear their bodies with grease and soot, perhaps to appear blacker, and often twist the guts of beasts and fowls about their legs and arms in the manner of bracelets, and some say they occa∣sionally make use of them for food. Upon their heads they wear some shells, and on their bodies a mantle of sheep skin with the woolly side out∣wards in summer, and inwards in winter, and a∣nother piece like an apron hanging before from the navel, generally of catskin, with the hairy side outwards. This garment serves the man for his bed at night, and this is all the winding-sheet or coffin he has when he dies. If he be the captain of a village, or chief of his nation, instead of a sheepskin, his mantle is made of tyger-skins, wild catskins, or some other skins they set a value upon. The reason they alledge for besmearing their bodies, and wearing greasy sooty caps on their heads, is to keep them cool.</P>
<P>The principal ornaments, both of men and wo∣men, are glass or brass beads, with little thin plates of glittering brass, and mother of pearl, which they wear in their hair, or about their ears. Of these brass and glass-beads strung, they also make necklaces, bracelets for the arms, and girdles, wearing several strings of them about their necks, waists, and arms. There is another ornament pe∣culiar to the men, and that is the bladder of any wild beast they have killed, which is blown up and fastened to the hair, as a trophy of their valour.
<PB N="121" REF="1200"/>
Soon after their children are born, they lay them in the sun, or by the fire, and rub them over with fat or butter, mixed with soot; and they continue to do so almost every day themselves after they are grown up.</P>
<P>Their huts are very mean, and so is their fur∣niture, consisting only of two or three earthen pots to dress their victuals in, which are usually herbs, flesh, shell-fish, or milk. When they make but∣ter, they put the milk into some skin made in the form of a soldier's knapsack, the hairy-side in∣wards; and then two of them taking hold of it, one at each end, they whirl and turn it round, 'till it is converted into butter, which they put up for anointing themselves, and their caps and mantles, for they never eat any. Since the arrival of the Dutch among them, they are become very fond of tobacco, wine, brandy, and other spirituous liquors.</P>
<P>Tho' the Hottentots are extremely lazy, indo∣lent, and nasty, yet they are generally healthy, and live to a great age; but this must be understood of those who keep to the diet of their country, and drink no wine, brandy, or other strong li∣quors: for such of them as drink these liquors shorten their days, and suffer under diseases before unknown. Even the victuals of the Dutch, dres∣sed and seasoned after the European manner, are very pernicious to the Hottentots.</P>
<P>Both men and women always wear a little greasy bag about their necks, in which they carry a knife, if they have one, with a pipe and some tobacco, or ducha, which is a sort of wild hemp, which they eat and smoak, as they do tobacco. In this bag they also carry a piece of wood burnt at both ends, as an amulet against witchcraft. Many of these pouches are old gloves, which they have procured from the Europeans.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="1210"/>
The Hottentots are pretty good mechanics; they make their own spears, darts, bows, and other weapons; they make also ivory rings, and brace∣lets for their arms of elephants teeth; and every family make their own earthen vessels. Their traffic is very inconsiderable, having no money or medium of trade; they barter their cattle with the Dutch for wine, brandy, tobacco, and cutlery ware: but tho' they see the Dutch build good houses, plant vineyards, and cloath themselves de∣cently, it is observed, that they still adhere to their old customs, and will not imitate the Dutch in any thing, not so much as in planting grapes, tho' they are so fond of wine and brandy, that one of them will turn a spit for a Dutchman half a day for a draught of sour wine, or a dram of brandy.</P>
<P>The weapons of the Hottentots are javelins, darts, or spears and arrows, which they poison, when at war. With these weapons they perform wonders of dexterity, both in the chace and in war. No people on earth, it is said, shew such a quickness of eye, and sureness of hand in the use of them. If a Hottentot, in the chace of a hare, deer, or wild goat, comes but within thirty or for∣ty yards of them, away flies the javelin, and down falls the creature, generally pierced quite thro' the body. When they take their aim at a mark, a beast, or a single enemy, either with a dart or arrow, they skip and dance from side to side, and brandish, and whirl it about in such a manner, that one would take their whole action for idle flourish, and not imagine they were aiming at any thing.</P>
<P>Every Hottentot nation has its king or chief, called konquer, whose authority devolves upon him by hereditary succession. This chief has the power of making peace and war, and presides in all their councils and courts of justice; but then his authority is said to be limited, and that he can
<PB N="123" REF="1220"/>
determine nothing without the consent of the cap∣tains of the several krails or villages, who seem to be the Hottentot senate. The captain of the krail, whose office is hereditary also, is their leader in time of war, and chief magistrate in time of peace; and, with the head of every family, determines all civil and criminal cases within the krail. Murder, adul∣tery, and robbery, they constantly punish with death. If a majority condemn the criminal, he is executed on the spot: the captain first strikes him with a club, and then the rest of the judges fall upon him and drub him to death. In civil causes also, the matter is determined by a majority of votes, and satisfaction immediately ordered the in∣jured party out of the goods of the person that appears to be in the wrong. The whole country is but one common, where they feed their cattle promiscuously, moving from place to place to find water, or fresh pasture. In every krail there is a physician or two well skilled in the botany, surgery, and medicine, of the Hottentots. They are chosen out of the sages of the krail, and perform without fee or reward. They have great skill in the vir∣tues of their herbs, and cup and handle a lancet well. If a patient dies under their hands, they always affirm that their remedies have been render∣ed ineffectual by witchcraft.</P>
<P>With regard to the religion of the Hottentots, the Portuguese, who were the first Europeans that visited the Cape, reported, that the Hottentots had no religion, because they found neither temples nor images among them; but we have now the fullest evidence, that they believe in God, or the Supreme Being, who made the heavens and the earth, as they have declared to several missionaries, who lived among them. They stile him the God of Gods, and believe he is endued with all imagin∣able perfections: but they never address them∣selves
<PB N="124" REF="1230"/>
directly to him, but to certain genii or de∣mons, whom they look upon as mediators for them to the Supreme God: and it is probable, they look upon the moon as one of those inferior intelligences, for they assemble at the new-moon, prostrate them∣selves before it, and dance the whole night; and by several expressions shew their dependence on this inferior deity, from whom they expect good weather and fruitful seasons. They worship also those that have had the reputation of saints and heroes, and pay their devotions to an imaginary evil spirit, like the Indians, whom they believe to be the author of all the calamities that they suffer; and to him they sacrifice sheep and oxen, as well as to their saints. They certainly believe a future state, by sacrificing and offering up their prayers to departed saints; for this would be the greatest absurdity, if they did not suppose, that the soul survived the body. Their removing their huts to different ground, when any one dies, shews, that they are apprehensive, that the dead man may re∣turn again, and give them some disturbance; and that departed souls chiefly haunt the places where they died: a piece of superstition which prevails every where almost.</P>
<P>There is no getting the better of the invincible reluctance the Hottentots have to adopt the Eu∣ropean manners and customs. For this reason the Dutch missionaries, with all their endeavours, have not been able to convert a single Hottentot. Van∣der Stel, a governor of the Cape, having procured a Hottentot infant, took care to have him brought up in the principles of the Christian religion, and the manners and customs of Europe. He cloathed him richly, had him taught several languages, and the boy's progress perfectly corresponded with the attention bestowed upon him. The governor, big with expectations from his pupil's capacity,
<PB N="125" REF="1240"/>
sent him to the Indies with a commissary-general, to be employed in the company's affairs; but the commissary dying, he returned to the Cape, and in a visit he made to some of his relations a few days after his arrival, took the strange resolution of ex∣changing all his European finery for a sheep's skin. In this new dress he returned to the fort, loaded with a bundle containing the cloaths he had thrown off, and presenting himself before the governor, accosted him him thus: "Be so kind, Sir, as to take notice, that I for ever renounce this apparel. I likewise for ever renounce the Christian religion. It is my firm resolution to live and die in the reli∣gion, manners, and customs of my ancestors. All the favour I ask from you, is to leave me the col∣lar and hanger I wear; I shall keep them for your sake." These words were scarce out of his mouth, when he took to his heels, and was out of sight, nor did he ever appear among the Europeans a∣gain.</P>
<P>The Hottentots frequently expose their female children in their forests to be starved or devoured by wild beasts, as they do their fathers and grandfa∣thers, when they become decrepid and useless; but this is not with the consent of their magi∣strates, or chief men of the place. Notwithstand∣ing this their barbarity to their female children, they have the greatest abhorrence to their being desected and cut in pieces, as they are sometimes by the European surgeons: they imagine this is done with a design to use their flesh in magic and witchcraft, and therefore watch the corpse of the deceased sometime after it is buried.</P>
<P>The Hottentots allow of poligamy, and also of divorce, upon a reasonable complaint. Fortune is very little considered in their marriage; the man's father usually gives him a cow, and a few sheep, and the woman's father the like, on their marriage;
<PB N="126" REF="1250"/>
and the relations and friends of the married couple assist them in building a house, or rather a hut: a fat ox is killed upon the occasion, and a wedding dinner provided suitable to their circumstances. The men form a circle in the area of the krail, and the women assemble in another circle. The bride∣groom sits down in the middle of the men's circle, and the bride in that of the women's; after which, the priest comes into the circle, and pisses upon the bridegroom; from thence he goes to the women's circle, and pisses upon the bride, which is esteem∣ed the greatest honour that can be done them; after which the married couple receive the congra∣tulations of the company, wishing they may live long and happily together; that they may have a son before the end of the year; that he may prove a brave fellow, an expert huntsman, and the like. The meat being served up in earthen pans, the company fall to, and having neither knives nor forks, make use of their teeth and claws, pulling it to pieces, and eating as voraciously as so many dogs, having no other plates or napkins, than the corners of the stinking mantles they wear, and sea∣shells usually serve them instead of spoons. After dinner, they sit smoaking and talking merrily on the occasion, 'till towards morning, when the bride steals away, and the bridegroom after her, and then the company disperse. There is no dancing on the occasion, nor strong liquor, these people sel∣dom drinking any thing besides water and milk. The woman has not been married many days be∣fore she is set to work, and treated little better than a slave; all the business without doors and within is done by their wives; the more of which therefore a man has, the richer he is.</P>
<P>Our English seamen, who have touched at the Cape, could never be reconciled to the Hottentots, but always considered them as the nastiest and most
<PB N="127" REF="1260"/>
brutal people in the world. This is chiefly owing to their ill smell, occasioned by their greasing themselves continually; yet this is not a custom peculiar to the Hottentots, being used by most of the negroes on the coast of Guinea. It is true, that the latter, generally speaking, make use of oil, which is less offensive; but when they cannot get that, like the Hottentots, they content themselves with such grease and kitchen-stuff as they can pro∣cure from the Europeans who trade with them. This custom prevails likewise in the East Indies, particularly on the Malacca coast, but more espe∣cially in the islands; as for instance, at Sumatra, where the natives grease themselves as much, and smell to the full as strong as the Hottentots. The Javanese likewise practise the same; and so do the people of the Philippines, and of the Spice-islands; but then they commonly make use of cocoa nut oil, which is far from being disagreeable.</P>
<P>This custom of anointing is not altogether un∣known to the Americans, tho' generally speaking, they rather affect painting their bodies, either by way of ornament, or to make them appear more terrible to their enemies; or perhaps from the same cause, that the Indians and Hottentots are said to anoint themselves, namely, to defend their naked bodies against the excessive heat or cold of the weather. That anointing also was much practised by the antient Jews, Greeks and Romans, is well known to all who have any knowledge of their manners and customs.</P>
<P>As to the Cape of Good Hope, where the Dutch have their settlements, it was first discovered by Bartholomew Diaz, in the year 1493, when John the second was on the throne of Portugal. Diaz having met with stormy weather in doubling the Cape, thought fit to call it Cabo Formentoso, that is the tempestuous cape; but the king, who from
<PB N="128" REF="1270"/>
other lights he had received, was enabled to form a right judgment of the importance of this discovery, stiled it Cabo del buena Esperanza, or the Cape of Good Hope, which name it hath retained ever since; for he saw that the passage was open, and that there wanted but one voyage more to finish what they had so much desired, viz. the finding a direct passage by sea to the East Indies. It lies in latitude 34°. 15′. south, and longitude 20°. 10′. east of London, and is now justly esteemed one of the most important places in the hands of the Dutch East-India company. Tho' it is certain that the profits they draw from it are not comparable to those arising from some of their settlements in the East Indies, yet it would be impossible to carry on their trade to the East Indies, if they were not possessed of this place; because at the Cape, and only at the Cape, they can meet with fresh water, and other refreshments, in their out∣ward and homeward bound passages, which are ab∣solutely requisite, especially for such as are eaten up with the scurvy, who seldom fail to be recover∣ed by the helps they meet with here.</P>
<P>Tho' the Portuguese first discovered the Cape, and it had been often visited both by them and the English before the Dutch took possession of it, yet neither thought it worth the keeping, and it had been actually fifty years in the hands of the Dutch, before they judged it capable of any improve∣ments.</P>
<P>During that time, they only touched in their voyages to and from the East Indies, to traffic for provisions. For this purpose they went from time to time in bodies up into the country, and having thrown up a small fort near the harbour, they se∣cured themselves, and their purchases in the night∣time, 'till they could put them on board. After this manner the Dutch used the Cape from 1600, to 1650, when their fleet anchoring before it, for
<PB N="129" REF="1280"/>
the usual purpose, M. Van Rebeck, a surgeon be∣longing to it, after having been some time on shore, conceived in his mind the plan of almost all that has been since done. He observed, that the coun∣try was plentifully stocked with cattle; that the soil was rich; that the natives were tractable, and the harbour commodious and improveable; in a word, he saw that it was highly adviseable for the Dutch to make a settlement there. Accordingly in his pas∣sage home he digested his thoughts in writing; and having laid his scheme before the directors, they not only approved it, but fitted out immedi∣ately a squadron of four large ships, laden with every thing requisite for putting it in execution, giving the sole command to Van Rebeck, with instructions drawn from his own papers. This man laid the basis of his new establishment in equity; he purchased the country he resolved to settle in from the natives, and gave them for it such goods as they chose, to the amount of fifty thousand florins: he did not oblige them to re∣move, nor did he put the least constraint upon their freedom. When they were disposed to work, he paid them; when they were sick, he relieved them. As they had not the use of letters, there could be no written agreement between them; he took no advantages of this: he performed his promises punctually, by which the natives came to have a confidence in the Dutch. It quickly appeared, that his notions were perfectly well founded, and that the country was every way capable of improve∣ment. Every thing being settled with the natives to the satisfaction of both parties, the governor be∣gan to raise a fort, with dwelling-houses, ware∣houses, and an hospital for the reception of the sick. To this fort he added proper bulwarks, to secure himself against any attacks of the Europeans. But in process of time, settlers multiplying very fast,
<PB N="130" REF="1290"/>
and trade increasing greatly, one of the governors, whose name was Bax, took notice, that the compa∣ny's storehouses, which were without the fort, would soon be too small to receive all the company's mer∣chandize at the Cape: he judged likewise, that there was a necessity for augmenting the garrison, since all the trading nations in Europe saw, and began to envy the Dutch, the advantages they made of the Cape; and that therefore, it might justly be apprehended, that one or other of those na∣tions would attempt to wrest it from them. These things he represented to the court of directors, and proposed to them the erecting a new fort on a more advantageous situation. This was accord∣ingly done, and from time to time has been so augmented, that at this day it is a very strong and statlely building, and provided with all manner of accommodations for a garrison. It covers the har∣bour, and is of admirable defence towards the country; and the company's storehouses for mer∣chandizes are very large and commodious. The fort and town are both situated on the side of a plain three leagues in extent, at the bottom of the three hills we mentioned at the beginning of this description, namely the Table-hill, the Lion-hill, and another, by some called Sugar-loaf-hill, by others the Devil's hill, and by others the Windmill-hill. The first, tho' very high, is very fertile, and has several fine springs of water on its top, as clear as crystal, and of a very delicate taste. It is also adorned with stately trees, groves, and arbours; and the beauty, variety, and fragrancy of the flowers, that grow in great plenty on its tops and sides, are not to be expressed, says Kolben, being more delight∣ful to the eye, and more odoriferous than any he ever met with in Europe. On Lion-hill, which is separated from the former by a valley, is a hut
<PB N="131" REF="1300"/>
for the shelter of two men posted there by the go∣vernor, to give notice, by signals, to the fortress at the Cape, of the appearance of any ship making in. Windmill-Hill, which is the lowest of the three, yields excellent pasture, both for great and small cattle. The bay before the town is very fine and large, being of an oval form, about nine miles in circuit, and capable of holding an hundred sail of large ships, very commodiously. The houses of which this town is composed are exceeding neat, yet not above two stories high, because of the furious south-east and north-west winds that sometimes blow here. This is the sixth government bestowed by the Dutch East-India company. The governor is always one of the council of the Indies, and has likewise a council to assist him in the administration. There is such an abundance of all sorts of provisions at the Cape, that notwithstanding the vast annual de∣mand, both by outward-bound and howeward∣bound ships of all nations, never any scarcity arises, but all ships meet with the succours they expect, at a moderate rate. In order to have a just notion of the great importance of this place, it will be proper to observe, that, in the space of a year, at least forty outward bound ships touch there from Holland alone, and in these there cannot be less than eight or nine thousand people. The homeward-bound ships from the Indies cannot be fewer, in the space of a year, than thirty-six, and on board these there are usually three thousand souls; not to speak of foreign vessels that likewise put in here, and have also all kinds of refreshments. This must appear very extraordinary, when one considers what vast quantities such numerous fleets must require. But this is not all; these ships do not enter the port, and sail again directly, but continue there for some time, insomuch that there are always ships in the road, except in the
<PB N="13$" REF="1310"/>
months of May, June, and July, when it is dan∣gerous on account of the north-west wind, that blows with the utmost violence during three months. In the company's garden here are the most deli∣cious fruits of Asia and Europe, growing within squares of bay hedges, so high and thick that the storms coming off the ocean can prejudice them but little; and these hedges afford a most refresh∣ing shade in the hot season. In this garden is also a fine grove of chesnut-trees, which the sun can∣not penetrate. Here also we meet with peaches, pomegranates, citrons, lemons, and oranges, with the apples and pears of Europe intermixed, all ex∣cellent in their kinds; and here we see the crimson Japan apples, which, intermixed with the green leaves, appear exceeding beautiful. Here also grows the Indian guava. They have scarce any fruit-trees, the natural product of the country, at least such as the Europeans care to taste of; tho' the Hottentots eat some of them. Three or four sorts of almond-trees have been brought hither, which bear fruit once in three years, and, as they have large plantations of them, yield the Dutch considerable profit. The ananas or pine apples, a most delicious fruit, is also planted in this garden. Here we meet with four sorts of camphire trees, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best whereof was trans∣planted from Borneo, the other three from Su∣matra, Java, and Japan; the leaves, being rubbed between the fingers, smell strong of camphire. It was a great while before they raised any considera∣ble vineyards. They carried thither the first vine∣stocks from the banks of the Rhine, and from Per∣sia, in small parcels, which grew pretty well, and furnished them with grapes for eating; but they did not pretend to make any quantities of wine, till a certain German taught them to take the prun∣ings of their vines, and cut them in small pieces, and plant them in fields plowed up for that purpose,
<PB N="133" REF="1320"/>
by which means they were soon furnished with as many stocks and plants as they had occasion for; and now there is scarce a cottage in the Cape set∣tlement but has its vineyard, which produces wine enough for the family. Their plants of all sorts are larger and sweeter than those of Europe; the head of a cabbage, at its full growth, weighing thirty or forty pounds; and the head of a cauliflower as much, the seeds whereof are brought from Cy∣prus and Savoy: their melons also are of an ex∣ceeding fine flavour, and larger and wholesomer than those of Europe; and are raised without glasses or hot-beds, their summers being excessive hot, and their winters moderate: their potatoes are very large, weighing from six to ten pounds; these they brought from India, and they are ex∣ceeding good. In December all their grain is ripe, and our Christmas is the height of their harvest. In January they tread out their corn in the fields; and in February the farmers carry it to the compa∣ny's magazines, where they receive ready money for all they do not use themselves. They sow al∣most all manner of grain but oats and lentiles.</P>
<P>For the civil and ecclesiastical government of this colony, and the administration of justice, there are eight colleges at the Cape; viz. a grand coun∣cil, a court of justice, a petty court of assaults, &amp;c. a court of marriage, a chamber of orphans, an ec∣clesiastical council, a common-council, and a board of militia; by means of all which, this colony is well regulated and governed.</P>
<P>The company have now a vast territory here, the soil of which is fruitful, the climate wholesome and pleasant, the country wonderfully improved, and daily improving, and this in the way most to their advantage, that is, by agriculture, vineyards, and feeding of cattle, so that their provisions and their people increase in the same proportion; and this
<PB N="134" REF="1330"/>
colony, in the space of a few years, will become, or rather is already become, so populous, and the people, from their manner of living, so vigorous and hardy, that they are not only secure from any attempts that other nations might make, but are also in a condition to furnish supplies of well sea∣soned and serviceable men, for the protection of any of their settlements in the Indies, in case of emergencies.</P>
<P>The Dutch colonies or settlements in this coun∣try at present are principally four: the first is that at the Cape, where are the grand forts and the capi∣tal city; the second, is the Hellenbogesh; the third, the Drakenstein; and the fourth, the Wave∣rish colony. The company has likewise bought, for the future increase of the people, all that tract of land called Terra de Natal, lying between Mosambic and the Cape, for which they paid in toys, commodities, and utensils, to the value of thirty thousand guilders. There are some Europeans, or at least descendants from Europeans, who are settled upwards of three hundred leagues from the coasts. Of the peasants, there are some in very happy circumstances, hav∣ing, besides large and well cultivated plantations, great quantities of sheep and cattle. Of the colo∣nies above-mantioned, that called Drakenstein, at eight leagues distance from the Cape, is entirely composed of French refugees, who have there a large tract of country, well cultivated. They are allowed churches, ministers, and inferior magis∣trates, of their own nation.</P>
<P>Besides the standing forces here, the Dutch, in case of an attack, could draw together at least five thousand militia, well armed and disciplined; every peasant knowing whither to repair in order to range themselves under his proper standard. There is usually one guardship, and that moored with strong chains, the road being very unsafe, and sub∣ject
<PB N="135" REF="1340"/>
to frequent storms. The Dutch generally im∣port their slaves from the neighbouring island of Madagascar, for they never make slaves of the Hottentots, but live in a friendly correspondence with them; so that it is probable they would assist in the defence of the country, if ever it should be invaded.</P>
<P>The Hottentots, so far as they have been yet dis∣covered, consist of seven different nations, all com∣prehended under the general name of Hottentots. Part of them have submitted themselves, and are therefore stiled the Company's Hottentots. The Dutch send annually about fifty or sixty persons to trade with these people, who purchase their cattle, and give them in exchange arrack, tobacco, hemp, and such garden-seeds as they have occasion for; by which means a good understanding is pre∣served.</P>
<P>Of all the seven Hottentot nations, that of the Caffres is represented by the Dutch writers as the most fierce, savage, and uncivilized; but whe∣ther these people are man-eaters, as we are also told, there is some reason to doubt.</P>
<P>This settlement is said to have cost the Dutch a million of florins per ann. for twenty years, that is, altogether, two millions sterling; and at present the revenues arising from the tenths of the profits which the government reserves out of all the lands they grant to privateplanters, and from the customs and excises, and from the sale of goods at the Cape, does little more than balance the charges they are at in fortifying and garrisoning their towns and forts, in defraying the ordinary and extraordinary expence of the civil, military, and ecclesiastical establishments, and maintaining an hospital for dis∣eased seamen, together with the necessary expence of their ships, outward and homeward bound; for, though this is a very plentiful country, they have
<PB N="136" REF="1350"/>
few or no commodities proper for exportation, ex∣cept wine, which is equal to any in Europe, and of which they have great variety. The principal ad∣vantage this country is of to the Dutch is the supply∣ing their fleets with provisions, to and from India.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TERRA DE NATAL.</HEAD>
<P>Terra de Natal, which, as we observed above, has been purchased by the Dutch, was so called because the Portuguese discovered it on the day of our Saviour's nativity. It lies between the latitude of 30 and 33°. south. On the north it is bounded by the river Dellagoa; on the south by a chain of moun∣tains; on the east by the Indian Ocean; but how far backwards it extends we cannot pretend to say.</P>
<P>That part of the country which lies towards the sea is said to be flat, and woody; but within land are many hills, intermixed with pleasant vallies, plains, groves, and savannahs, which are well wa∣tered by the river of Natal, and other lesser streams. Elephants are so plenty here, that they are seen feed∣ing together, mornings and evenings, in herds of a thousand or fifteen hundred, in the savannahs or meadows; but in the heat of the day they retire in∣to the woods. They are very peaceable, if not mo∣lested. Here are also great numbers of buffaloes, bullocks, deer, hogs, conies, lions, tigers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>They have an odd way here of catching tur∣tles or tortoises: taking a living sucking fish, or remora, and fastening a couple of strings to it, one at the head and another at the tail, they let it down into the water, on the turtle-ground; and when they find that the fish has fastened itself to the back of a turtle, as it will soon do, they then draw it and the turtle up together. This way of fishing, it is said, is also used at Madagascar.</P>
<P>One of the ornaments of the Caffres, who are the natives of this country, is a piece of cow-hide,
<PB N="137" REF="1360"/>
made like a tail, which is fastened behind them, and reaches from their waist to the ground. When they are a little fuddled, and their music playing, they will skip about, and shake their tails, in a very di∣verting manner.</P>
<P>Mr. Kolben says, the Caffres do not anoint or grease their bodies, as the other Hottentots; that they have nothing of the Hottentot stammering, or manner of utterance; and that they sow a sort of Turkish corn, and brew with it; whereas the other Hottentots neither sow nor brew.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TERRA DOS FUMOS.</HEAD>
<P>Terra dos Fumos seems to be only a small part of the country stiled, in a large sense, Terra de Na∣tal. It extends from the mouth of the river De∣lagoa to that of Rio de Ladroon, or the River of the Robbers. The Europeans have no settlement for trade here, and the Caffres, who inhabit the country, have neither towns, villages, nor any set∣tled dwellings.</P>
<P>To the north of the country of the Hottentots is the Land of Mozumbo Acalunga, which has the kingdom of Mataman on the west; the Hot∣tentot Country on the south; Monomotopa on the east; and the province of Ohila on the north.</P>
<P>Farther north is the kingdom of Abutua, or Bu∣tua, which is said to be rich in gold mines. Dap∣per says, that this province, which he calls Toro∣ca or Toroa, begins to the south of the Mountains of the Moon, and extends northwards to the river Maginca, having the river Bravagul on the west. This country, we are told, abounds with gold, sil∣ver, and precious stones.</P>
<P>Towards the north-east of Abutua we find the kingdom of Chicova, which is said to contain many silver mines.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="138" REF="1370"/>
<HEAD>GUINEA.</HEAD>
<P>The vast region known by the name of Guinea is divided into the Upper and Lower, the latter of which is also called Congo. These two together, reckoning from Cape Togrin, near the mouth of the river Sierra Leoni, in 9°. 18′. of north latitude, to Cape Negro, in 16°. 45′. of south latitude, ex∣tend about two thousand five hundred miles along the sea-coast, and many more, if we reckon all the turnings, windings, and bays. As for its inland extent, it is not easy to ascertain it.</P>
<P>All this country lying between the tropics, the air is excessive hot, especially from the beginning of September to the end of March, which, with the coolness of the nights, the frequent thick, stinking, sulphureous mists, and the periodical rains, when the flat country is all overflowed, makes it very unhealthy, especially to Europeans, to whom it is generally fatal. The winds on the coast of Guinea Proper set from west to east, directly contrary to the trade∣winds, except in the rainy season, between the ver∣nal and autumnal equinox, when they have vio∣lent storms of wind, with terrible thunder and lightning; and these winds blowing from the south, the shipping on the coast at this time are in great danger of being wrecked; and, even in the calmest weather, there is always such a surf beating upon the shore, that it is very difficult and dange∣rous landing. As to the face of the country, a variety of hills, vallies, woods, and plains, are seen all along the coast, intermixed with bogs and morasses.</P>
<P>The animals of Guinea are the same as those of Caffraria; but their grain is different. Here is no wheat; but plenty of Guinea grain, rice, maiz,
<PB N="139" REF="1380"/>
or Indian corn. There are no grapes here; but the palm-tree affords them wine, and their cocoa-nuts a pleasant drink. Here are also oranges and le∣mons, plantains, pomegranates, tamarinds, pine∣apples, and other tropical fruits.</P>
<P>Of forest-trees they have a great variety, which grow to a prodigious height and bulk; some of them being excellent timber, and having a very beautiful grain.</P>
<P>Their metals are gold, copper, and iron. The gold is found by the natives in the sands of their rivulets in dust; sometimes they meet with large pieces, but there are no gold mines open, and pos∣sibly there may be no mines of that metal. As it is found washed down into the brooks and rivulets in every place our people bring it from, it seems probable that it lies pretty near the surface. There is plenty of salt on the Guinea coast, which they make by letting the salt water into shallow pans in the dry season, and the sun exhaling the water, the salt is left at bottom.</P>
<P>Besides gold, ivory, and slaves, this country af∣fords indigo, wax, gum-senega, gum-tragant, and a variety of other gums and drugs. These articles may be had in most parts of this extensive coast, but chiefly in Proper Guinea.</P>
<P>Of mountains in Guinea, the most remarkable are those of Sierra Leoni. The principal capes are those of Cape Blanco, Cape Verd, Cape Leon, Cape St. Ann's, Cape Palmas, and Cape Three-Points, Cape Formosa, Cape Monte, Cape St. John, Cape Lopas, Cape Lede, and Cape Negro. The chief bays are the Cyprian or Cintra Bay, and the Bite of Guinea. Of the rivers, the most considerable are thoe of Coanzo and Ambrisi, the Zaara, the Lunde, the Cameron, the Formosa, the Volta, the Sierra Leon, and the Sherbro. All these run from east to
<PB N="140" REF="1390"/>
west, (except the Volta, which runs from north to south) and fall into the Atlantic.</P>
<P>The natives of Guinea, descended from the ori∣ginal inhabitants, are all negroes, well known by their flat noses, thick lips, and short woolly hair, though there are among them many camps or vil∣lages of Arabs, who are of a tawny complexion; and there is a mixed breed of Mulattoes, proceed∣ing from the commerce of the Portuguese and na∣tives, who are almost as dark as the negroes.</P>
<P>As to their habits, the common people have ge∣nerally only a cloth about their middle; but peo∣ple of condition have another over their shoulders, and are adorned with abundance of rings, and bracelets of gold, ivory, or copper: the arms, legs, and a great part of the bodies of the men are naked, but the women are veiled, when they go abroad.</P>
<P>The Europeans tell us, that the natives have ge∣nerally more wit than honesty, frequently mixing their gold with base metal; but there is reason to suspect, that the little tricks and cheats they use in trade have been taught them by the Christians with whom they traffic; and if the women are lewd, they are not worse than those that accuse them, who first tempt them to incontinence, and then reproach them for it.</P>
<P>Every family almost in Guinea make their own tools and utensils: they are all smiths, car∣penters, and masons, building their own houses or huts, which are, indeed, of very slight materials; and, till the Europeans brought them hammers, &amp;c. one stone served them for an anvil, and ano∣ther for a hammer. The women manage all the husbandry, as well as their domestic affairs: they dig, sow, plant, and bring in the harvest, while the husband looks on; so that the more wives a man has, the richer he is said to be in this country; and
<PB N="141" REF="1400"/>
some negroes on the coast make money by letting out their wives; and, indeed, they make little dif∣ference between their wives and their slaves.</P>
<P>The small-pox is as fatal to the negroes as the plague, and worms are an epidemical distem∣per; not those in the stomach and bowels, but a species that are found between the skin and the flesh, and give the patient extreme pain, till they are drawn out, which is an operation that some∣times takes a month to perform; for, if they at∣tempt to draw it out too hastily, the worm breaks, and rots in the flesh, or breaks out in another place. Some negroes have nine or ten of these worms in their skin at once, and the Europeans are not entire∣ly free from them. A greedy ravenous appetite is also reckoned among the diseases of the Guinea negroes; and the venereal disease is often fatal to them, having no effectual methods of cure of their own; nor are the wounds they receive in the field of Mars less dangerous than the other, especially if the bones are shattered; for they can cure only or∣dinary flesh wounds, which they do by applying poultices of herbs. The negroes are seldom long∣lived, tho' they are generally healthful, while they live.</P>
<P>The distempers the Europeans are subject to on this coast are, fevers, fluxes, and cholics, which are occasioned by indifferent water, and bad air; their settlements lying near the coast, where the fogs and steams arising from the ooze and salt marshes, and the stinking fish the natives dry on the beach, corrupt the air, and render it fatal to fo∣reigners. The most temperate men find it diffi∣cult to preserve their health; but a great many hasten their death by their intemperance, or negli∣gence, exposing themselves to the cold air in the evening, after a very hot day. This sudden change,
<PB N="142" REF="1410"/>
from one extreme to the other, has often very bad effects in hot climates.</P>
<P>As to religion, the natives generally acknow∣ledge one Supreme Almighty Being, that created the universe; and yet pay him no manner of wor∣ship or adoration, never praying to him, or giving him thanks for any thing they enjoy. They be∣lieve he is too far exalted above poor mortals to take any notice of them, and therefore pray to a multitude of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> deities, of which there are some common to whole nations; and yet every man has a god of his own chusing besides.</P>
<P>In Guinea there are some sovereign princes, whose dominions are very extensive, rich, power∣ful, and themselves arbitrary, limited by no laws, or any other restraint; and there are many others, to whom the Dutch and other Europeans have given the name of kings, whose dominions do not ex∣ceed the bounds of an ordinary parish, and whose power and revenues are proportionably mean.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>UPPER-GUINEA.</HEAD>
<P>The most general division of Upper-Guinea is into three parts, Malagueta, Guinea Proper, and Benin.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MALAGUETA.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Malagueta is generally known under the name of the Grain Coast, from the para∣dise grain, or Guinea pepper, called malagueta in Spanish, which grows here in great plenty.</P>
<P>The chief place frequented by the Europeans on this coast is Sherbro, the capital of a petty king∣dom of the same name. Sherbro river is naviga∣ble for canoes a great way up, and the main article of trade there is cam-wood. Near the mouth of this river is York-Island, on which the English had
<PB N="143" REF="1420"/>
once a factory, and good fort, now in ruins. Ano∣ther island here, called Farellons, abounds with poultry, rice, potatoes, bananas, and orange and lemon trees.</P>
<P>About twenty-five leagues distant from the mouth of the river Sherbro, to the south-east, is Cape Monte. This part of the country is very populous, and the negroes extremely industrious, particularly in planting rice, and boiling salt.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GUINEA-PROPER.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Guinea-Proper extends from Cape Palmas to the river Volta, about an hundred and fifty leagues along the sea coast, which bounds it to the south. It has the kingdom of Benin on the east; Gago and Melli, on the north; and Malagueta on the west. The Europeans divide it into two parts, the Tooth and the Gold Coast; the former extending from Cape Palmas to the river Sueira da Casta, eighteen miles west of the river Mancha, by some called Rio-Cobre, and Auke∣ber; and the latter from thence to the river Volta.</P>
<P>The Tooth, Ivory, or Quaqua Coast, is so call∣ed from the great plenty of elephants teeth found there. According to Dapper, the inhabitants of this coast, though they seem the most barbarous and savage people of all Guinea, are really the most civilized and the most reasonable, and pass for such among their neighbours. When they come to trade with any ship, they take some water into their hands, and let a few drops of it fall into their eyes, which is a kind of oath, by which they intimate, that they would rather lose their eye-sight than cheat those they trade with. They are no less averse to drunkenness than to fraud; and though their country produces numbers of palm-trees, yet they drink no palm-wine, but only a certain liquor call∣ed
<PB N="144" REF="1430"/>
bordon, or tombo-wine, which they mix with water. Their chief manufactures and trade consists in cotton habits, which are called Quaqua gowns, and are made of five or six breadths sewed toge∣ther. One of the fundamental laws of this coun∣try is, that every one is obliged to continue all his life-time in the condition in which he was born; so that one whose father was a fisherman, for in∣stance, can never become any thing else but a fish∣erman, and so of all other trades and professions.</P>
<P>The Gold-Coast had its name given it by the Portuguese, from the immense quantity of that pre∣cious metal it produces: the same reason has made all the other nations of Europe retain the same ap∣pellation. According to the best charts, founded upon the latest observations, the situation of the Gold-Coast is between 4°. 30′. and 8°. north lati∣tude, and 16°. and 18°. 4′. of longitude, begin∣ning at the river Ankobar, and extending to the Rio Volta, that is, about an hundred and thirty leagues, from west to east. The beginning of the Gold-Coast, however, is placed by many at Rio de Suiero da Costa, near Isnui, that being the first place where gold is found; and the end at Lay, in the country of Lampi, three or four leagues from Akra, because there the gold is procured but acci∣dentally, from a people called Amaho, inhabiting the more distant interior country.</P>
<P>This coast contains a variety of different king∣doms and states, viz. Adomir, called likewise Sa∣ku, and Avina; Axim; Ankobar; Adom, like∣wise called Little Inkassan, or Warshes; Jabi, or Jabs; Commendo, or Guaffo: Fetu; Sabo; Fan∣tin; Ackron; Agonna, or Anguirra; Amra, or Aquambus; Lubbade; and Ningo, or Lampi. Each of the above divisions, provinces, or king∣doms, have one, two, or more towns or villages
<PB N="145" REF="1440"/>
on the sea-coast, between or under the European forts and settlements. Eight of them are real mo∣narchies, having their own proper kings, who, be∣fore the arrival of the Europeans, were called cap∣tains; the rest are republics, governed by magis∣trates, who are subject to the laws, and periodical changes. Upon the river Cobre or Ankobar, and in the country of that name, which is properly the first country of the Gold-Coast, there are a number of towns, in the three provinces of Ankobar, A∣borrel or Abocro, and Eguira. The first is a mo∣narchy; the two latter republics. For a number of years the Dutch had a fort at Eguira, and their gold trade, besides what they drew from the neigh∣bouring countries, was very considerable, this can∣ton having its own proper mines; but lost all their footing in the country by a quarrel with the negroes.</P>
<P>Eight leagues east of Cape Apollonia stands the town of Axim, the canton of which produces a pro∣digious quantity of rice, water-melons, ananas, ba∣nanas, cocoas, oranges, lemons of two different kinds, with abundance of other fruits, and vegeta∣bles of all sorts. As to the maize, or Indian corn; it is neither plentiful nor good, by reason of the hu∣midity and moisture of the soil. So continual is the rain here, that, according to a proverb of the country, it rains eleven months and twenty-nine days in the year. The natives export rice to all the kingdoms of the coast, bringing home millet, yams, potatoes, and palm-oil. Axim produces likewise great numbers of black cattle, sheep, goats, and tame pigeons, as well as other fowls. The whole country is well cultivated, and filled with populous villages, some on the sea-side, others farther up the country, all of them rich and beautiful. The natives maintain a constant traf∣fic in gold with the Europeans. Axim, or A∣chombona, the capital, stands under the cannon of the Dutch fort, called Fort St. Anthony,
<PB N="146" REF="1450"/>
which is one of the pleasantest establishments in Guinea; but that advantage is greatly diminished by the humidity of the air, and unhealthiness of the climate, particularly in the rainy seasons. This fort was taken from the Portuguese in the year 1642. The garrison is usually composed of twen∣ty-five white men, and an equal number of ne∣groes, under the command of a serjeant. It is maintained at the expence of the West-India com∣pany; and, when well furnished with stores and provisions, capable of making a long defence, against any number of negroes. The situation of the fort is east of the river Axim, which the Por∣tuguese call Rio Manco, a river navigable only by canoes, but rich in gold dust, washed down by the stream from the inland countries.</P>
<P>At Mount Mansore, which is the first point of Cape Tres Puntas, or Three Points, three leagues east of Fort St. Anthony, is the Dutch factory, called Fredericsburgh, mounting forty-six pieces of cannon, on four batteries, which formerly belonged to the Prussians. The climate here is as healthy as any in Guinea, and the surrounding country rich and well cultivated. Besides the great quantity of gold found in the rivers, the inhabitants carry on a con∣siderable trade in ivory and slaves, besides the pro∣fits arising from the salt made by the women for their amusement.</P>
<P>Cape Tres Puntas, of which we have made fre∣quent mention, had its name given it by the Portu∣guese, from its being composed of three points or eminences, projecting into the sea. Each of these hills is cloathed with beautiful woods, which are seen a great way off at sea. Upon the shore of the two bays, between them, stand the three villages of An∣kora, Akron, and Dickscove. Near Ankora is a Dutch settlement, called Fort Dorothea. Dicks∣cove stands two miles to the east of Dorothea, and
<PB N="147" REF="1460"/>
belongs to the English, who are charged with deal∣ing much in false gold there; the imitation being so artful, that it is hardly possible for strangers in the trade to distinguish the false from the pure and genuine.</P>
<P>Eight leagues east of Ankora begins the king∣dom of Anta. The land here is well watered, and the vallies rich and extensive, producing rice in abundance, maize of the best sort, sugar canes, yams, and potatoes, the largest on the whole coast.</P>
<P>The Dutch have a settlement here, called Bour∣try, on the banks of a river of the same name. The situation is extremely pleasant, and the most healthy on the coast. On both sides of the ri∣ver are seen infinite numbers of monkeys, apes, tigers, wild cats, some elephants, with cows, horses, sheep, hogs, and all kinds of birds. Toko∣rari, or, as the English call it, Tokarado, is a village near Bourtry, the inhabitants of which have the reputation of building the best canoes of any in Guinea. Six miles from Bourtry stands Sukon∣da, a rich and pleasant village, much noted for the clemency and healthfulness of the air. Here both the English and Dutch have factories, and the factors of both nations have constant opportunities of each other's company, when they happen to live in har∣mony and friendship; an advantage of inestimable value to rational and social beings, placed in this barbarous and ignorant country. It is remarkable, that the natives of this coast are ever harrassed with a fames canina, boulimy, or insatiable appe∣tite, arising, as some imagine, from the liberal use of krisca, a kind of wine common in this place. At Sama, one of the largest towns on the whole coast, situated on the pleasant river of St. George, not far from Sukonda, to the east, the Dutch have a fort, called Fort St. Sebastian. A little farther east lies the country of Jabi or Jabbah, which
<PB N="148" REF="1470"/>
extends quite to that of Commendo called also Commany, Komany, Aguesto, and Guaffo. The di∣mensions of the latter are about five miles along the sea-coast, and about as many up the country. It produces but little rice; yet are the valleys no less fertile than agreeable, and the hills covered with wood, which affords the most delightful prospect. At the village of Little Commendo both the English and Dutch have factories. The former, according to Smith, next to Cape Coast, is the principal for∣tification the English have in Guinea, at least on the Gold-Coast. The Dutch fort, called Woden∣bourgh, is but a musket-shot off; but the advan∣tages arising from so near a vicinity are lost by the quarrels and jealousies that almost continually sub∣sist between the two nations. The principal com∣modities for which there is a demand by the negroes of Commendo are, glass beads, brass bells, buttons, long linen cloths, and woollen stuffs. The former they send up the country; the latter they keep for their own consumption. When they are at war with neighbouring nations, trading thither for slaves is profitable; for they hurry to dispose of their prisoners, to save the expence of maintaining them: a ship arriving, on such an occasion, is sure of compleating her cargo in a few days. The negroes of Commendo are infamous for adulte∣rating their gold.</P>
<P>The next country to the east is the kingdom of Fetu, which is said to be an hundred and sixty miles in length, and near as much in breadth, be∣ginning at Mount Jago, or the river Sel, and ter∣minating at Mount Mafro, or Mountfort. This country is extremely well situated for European settlements, by reason of the neighbouring trading kingdoms, and the conveniency and cheapness of living. Three miles from Wodenburg stands the Dutch fort of La Mina, or St. George Elmina,
<PB N="149" REF="1480"/>
in the centre of the Gold-Coast. It is beyond con∣tradiction one of the most compleat on the coast, and very commodiously situated for the purpose of trade, and the protection and security of the trader. The garrison is composed of an hundred white men, and an equal number of free negroes, in the pay of the company. Near it is another fort, on a hill, called Conradsbourg.</P>
<P>Nine miles from Elmina is Cape Coast, the chief English settlement in Guinea. The name is thought to be a corruption of Cabo Corso, the antient Portu∣guese appellation. The cape on which the fort stands is formed by an angular point, washed on the south and east by the sea. The Portuguese settled here in 1610; but were dislodged, a few years af∣terwards, by the Dutch. In 1664 it was demolish∣ed by admiral Holmes, after his expedition against Fort Witsin, at Taberari. In 1665 De Ruyter, with a squadron of thirteen men of war, attacked all the English settlements along the coast, ruined the factories, and took, burnt, and sunk all the shipping of the English company; but, after all his endeavours, he was frustrated in his attempts on this fort, although, at that time, it had not re∣covered the damage done it by Holmes. The treaty of Breda having confirmed Cape Coast to the English, and the king granting a new charter in 1672, the directors applied all their attention to fortifying and rendering commodious this their chief possession. It is now large, strong, and com∣modious, well furnished with artillery and warlike stores, and commanding an extensive beautiful prospect. There are, however, some neighbouring hills, by means of which it would be no difficult matter for an enemy greatly to embarrass and an∣noy the fort. The soldiers at Cape Coast are lodged in the best barracks of any upon the coast of Guinea, and receive their pay daily in gold-dust.
<PB N="150" REF="1490"/>
Here are also convenient apartments for the slaves, who, in this particular, are treated with great hu∣manity, with forges for smiths, sheds and work∣houses for carpenters and other mechanics, toge∣with a convenient public kitchen, for the use of the settlement. In Barbot's time, there was a school for the instruction of negro children, to initiate them in reading, writing, and the principles of the Christian religion: whether it still remains, is what we cannot take upon us to affirm. A little way from the gate is a prison for murderers, traitors, and other criminals, convicted of capital crimes; where they are detained till an occasion offers for sending them over to England, to take their final trial. Finally, there is cut in the rock, beneath the platform, a large vault for the confinement of slaves that are purchased for exportation. It is di∣vided into a number of cells, and well contrived, to prevent their revolting, or forming conspira∣cies. The cistern for preserving their rain-water, by which the fort is chiefly supplied, is capable of hold∣ing four hundred hogsheads. They have no water besides this, but what is brought at a considerable distance. The trade here is chiefly in gold-dust and slaves; the former being returned to Europe, laid out in trade, or the purchase of slaves for the West Indies. The chief beauty of this place is the gardens, which are eight miles in circumference, all that space going by this name that is planted with trees. There the soil is fertile, producing e∣very sort of fruit that is to be found in warmer climates, as lemons, oranges, citrons, guavas, mangoes, plantains, bananas, pine-apples, tama∣rinds, cucumbers, water-melons, cocoa-nuts, cin∣namon, and every kind of sallads and roots. It is believed the cinnamon tree would grow here to great perfection, if properly cultivated.</P>
<P>There are many barren mountains in the king∣dom of Fetu; but the valleys are in general fer∣tile
<PB N="151" REF="1500"/>
and rich, except round Cape Coast, where the land is dry and sterile. The fish here are excellent and abundant; the fowls, especially the Muscovia ducks, good and cheap; the mutton and goats flesh lean and insipid, beef scarce, and pigeons in great plenty. Three quarters of a mile from the cape are two other small forts; one called Philip's Tower, and the other Fort-Royal, or Queen Ann's Fort.</P>
<P>Next to Fetu lie the small kingdoms of Sabu and Fantin. The first produces an amazing quan∣tity of Indian corn, potatoes, yams, bananas, o∣ranges, lemons, and other fruits; besides palm-oil, with which it supplies the countries of Akra and Axim. In this little kingdom the English have a fort, on Queen Ann's Point, about a mile from Fort Royal, and two miles from Mawri, or Mou∣ra, where the Dutch have a fort, called Fort Nas∣sau. The chief trade of this place consists in crude gold-dust, with which canoes every day arrive from all the sea-port towns.</P>
<P>The English and Dutch have each their separate forts in Fantin, and the former have three small lodges besides. The English sort is at Anamaboa, or Jemisia, which is said to be a handsome large town. The country about Anamaboa is populous, and exceeding rich in gold and slaves, and all the ne∣cessaries of life; but more particularly in corn, which they sell in large quantities to the Europe∣ans. In the woods of this country are found the most beauiful paroquets in the world, and an in∣finity of other birds.</P>
<P>The Dutch fort, called Fort Amsterdam, stands about a cannon-shot from Great Cormantin, a large populous town, situated on a high hill.</P>
<P>The natives of Fantin are represented as a hardy, bold, intrepid people, and surprizingly artful in debasing and counterfeiting the precious metal.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="1510"/>
Next to Fantin lie the kingdoms of Acron Agonna, and Aquamboe. The first extends along the sea-coast, from Fantin to the mount called Monte del Diabolo, or the Devil's Mountain. The only European settlement in this kingdom is that of the Dutch at the village of Apam, called Leydsaamkeyd, or Patience. Harts, hares, par∣tridges, and pheasants, with various other kinds of wild-fowl and quadrupeds, are here in great abun∣dance and perfection.</P>
<P>The country of Agonna begins at the Devil's Mount, stretching along the coast to the village of Anonsa, on the frontiers of Aquamboe or Acra, a space of sixteen miles. According to most au∣thors, it is rich in mines; but none of them ap∣pear to have been ever opened. At the village of Simpa, or Winiba, the English have, or at least once had a small fort; and the Dutch have ano∣ther at Barku. The country is, in general, plea∣sant and fertile. The language, which hitherto is the same all along the Gold-Coast, it is said, begins here to change; first into a different dialect, and, a little further, into a quite different language.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Aquamboe, which is one of the greatest monarchies on the coast of Guinea, being bounded on the east by the river Volta, on the west by Agonna, and extending for the space of twenty miles along the sea-coast, and about two hundred into the inland parts. That part of it which lies on the sea-coast is called Acra. The English, Dutch, and Danes, have each a fort here. That of the English is called Fort James, that of the Dutch Creveceur, and that of the Danes Chris∣tainsburg. The last is the only one the Danes possess on this coast. Here is a great trade in gold and slaves; the number of the latter being at least equal to what is disposed of on the whole coast be∣sides, not excepting Anamaboa.</P>

<PB N="153" REF="1520"/>
<HEAD>BENIN.</HEAD>
<P>Benin, which makes the third division of Up∣per-Guinea, has the Gold-Coast on the west; Ga∣go, Biafara, with the Desert of Sith, on the north; Mujaac and Makoko on the east; and part of Congo, with the Ethiopic Ocean, on the south. It is commonly divided into two parts, viz. Why∣dah and Ardah, which constitute what is called the Slave-Coast, and Benin-Proper.</P>
<P>The country called by the English Whydah, by the Portuguese Juda, and by the Dutch Fida, is bounded on the west by the river Volta; on the south by the Gulph of Guinea; on the east by the kingdom of Ardah; and on the north by the king∣dom of Dahomy. Whydah is allowed by all who have been there to be one of the most delightful countries in the world. The great number and variety of tall, beautiful, and shady trees, which seem as if planted in fine groves for ornament; the verdant fields every where cultivated, and no otherwise divided than by those groves, or pretty little villages, encompassed by a low mud-wall, and scattered over the face of the whole country, conspire to afford the most delightful prospect that imagination can form. There is neither mountain nor hillock to hinder ones prospect, the whole country being a fine, easy, and almost impercepti∣ble ascent, for the space of forty or fifty miles from the sea; so that from any part of this kingdom one may have a prospect of the sea, and the farther you go from it the more beautiful and populous the country is, which nevertheless yields no gold; but what they have here is brought from Brazil by the Portuguese, to purchase slaves.</P>
<P>The natives of this country are said to be the most polite negroes in Guinea, and very industri∣ous, but unacquainted with arms: hence it was,
<PB N="154" REF="1530"/>
that they made but a poor defence against the king of Dahomy, when he attacked and subdued them, about the year 1724, and afterwards loaded them with heavy taxes. They worship several sorts of deities. Among these is a large beautiful kind of snake, which is inoffensive in its nature; the sea, and tall trees.</P>
<P>Though this country in general be very fine, yet it is very unwholesome, and has become more so since the king of Dahomy conquered it, as the lands have not been near so well cultivated as they were before that revolution.</P>
<P>The king had commonly about four or five thousand wives, the great men commonly about three or four hundred, and others forty or fifty. When the king's wives went into the field to work, which they did daily in large companies, they used to cry out, when they saw a man, "Stand clear;" upon which, the man fell flat on the ground, till they had passed him.</P>
<P>The king was feared and reverenced by his sub∣jects as a demi-god; they always appeared in his presence kneeling, or prostrate on the ground. When they attended him in the morning, they prostrated themselves before the gate of the palace, kissed the earth three times, and, clapping their hands together, made use of some expressions, that looked more like the adoration of some deity than compliments paid to an earthly prince; and they even trembled at the sight of him. No person whatever was permitted to see his majesty eat, or to know in what part of the palace he slept, except his wives, who were his life-guards, and were fre∣quently sent on embassies, and employed in exe∣cuting such commands and sentences, as seemed much more proper for men; such as punishing criminals, pulling down their houses, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="1540"/>
When the king went abroad, five or six hun∣dred of his wives used to attend or run before him. He had not, it is said, a single man in his train.</P>
<P>From the multiplicity of wives, it is not uncom∣mon for a man to have two hundred children liv∣ing at once, or to have half a dozen born to him in one day; for they never cohabit with any of their wives when pregnant or menstrous: be∣sides, the more children a man has, the richer he is or may be, as he can dispose of them all at pleasure, except his eldest son.</P>
<P>Both men and women go with their heads shorn and uncovered, though the sun is scorching hot; but in other respects are cloathed, the latter howe∣ver, so loosely, that the wind often discloses their natural beauties, which, the men say, was a fashion invented by the women for a certain purpose. Circumcision is used here; but often not till the child is four, five, or even eight years old.</P>
<P>The negroes here, and the kingdom of Benin, live much better than those on the Gold-Coast. Here they eat beef, mutton, and fowls, and are very hospitable to strangers, as well as to their own countrymen; but, on the Gold-Coast, millet boil∣ed to the consistence of bread, is their common food, or else potatoes, yams, and other roots, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the room of it, well drenched in palm or cocoa-nut oil, and to this they sometimes add boiled herbs, and half-dried stinking fish; for they always let them lie on the beach till they stink. On the Gold-Coast they have also a dish called malaget, which is a mixture of ground corn and palm oil, boiled together. Garden beans, and other pulse, with plantains, bananas, and other fruits, roasted in the ashes, likewise serve them for food. All over the Guinea-Coast, they are too apt to drink to excess. In the morning they drink drams, and
<PB N="156" REF="1550"/>
palm-wine in the afternoon. Even the chiefs of their great towns, or kings, as the Dutch call them, will meet the meanest of their subjects in the market-place in the evening, and, forming a circle on the ground, drink to great excess, being attended by their women, who are no less addicted to drunkenness than the men, whose conversation is usually as smutty as that of a drunken crew of sail∣ors; nor does this at all shock the modesty of the negroe females, who maintain their ground, and sit drinking and smoaking with the men till morn∣ing. Besides their palm-wine, they have strong beer, made of millet; few or none of them drink∣ing water, which is esteemed the most unwhole∣some of all liquors on this coast.</P>
<P>The two principal places in Whydah are, that which gives name to the kingdom, and Sabec, where the English, French, and Portuguese, have forts and factories.</P>
<P>Adjoining to Whydah are several petty king∣doms, as Cato, Little and Great Popo, and Qua∣hoe, all, except the last, lying on the coast; but it does not appear that there are any European fac∣tories in them, though they trade in slaves. Qua∣hoe is said to abound also in gold, which the in∣habitants carry through Aquamboe to Acra.</P>
<P>Ardrah, or Ardah, a considerable kingdom, has Whydah on the west; the Gulph of Guinea on the south; and Benin Proper on the east; but how far it extends northward, or on what country it borders, we are not told. At Jackin, in this king∣dom, about forty miles from the mouth of the ri∣ver Volta, is an English factory.</P>
<P>The country of Dahomy, whose king conquered not only the kingdom of Whydah, as we observed above, but also that of Ardah, in 1724, is situated to the north of the Slave Coast, and extends a vast
<PB N="157" REF="1560"/>
way inland. The trade of the natives is chiefly in slaves, and some gold.</P>
<P>Benin Proper has part of the Gulph of Guinea, and the Slave Coast, or Ardah, on the west; part of Gago, and Biafara, or Brafera, on the north; Mujac and Makoko on the east; and Congo on the south. Its extent, from west to east, is about six hundred miles; but that from south to north is not yet ascertained. The country abounds with wild beasts, as elephants, tigers, leopards, bears; and with game, as harts, hares, partridges, pigeons, turtle-doves, &amp;c. The soil also produces a great variety of trees and plants, as orange, lemon, and especially cotton trees, with pepper, but not in such quantities as in the East-Indies. The natives here are generally good-natured and civil, and are easily managed by those who know their way. Few of them are laborious or industrious, unless it be those who are miserably poor: the others lay the whole burden of their work on their wives and slaves, whether it be tilling the ground, spinning of cotton, weaving of cloth, or any other handicraft; whilst they, if they have but the least stock, apply themselves to merchandize alone.</P>
<P>There are three persons here, called great lords or great men, who have the whole management of affairs under the king, and are always near his per∣son. If a woman is delivered of a boy, he is pre∣sented to the king, as properly and of right be∣longing to him; and hence all the males of the land are called the king's slaves. About a fort∣night after birth, both males and females are cir∣cumcised. The men here marry as many wives as their circumstances will allow them to keep. Menstrous women are obliged, while in that condi∣tion, to reside in a separate house; but as soon as that is over, and they have washed themselves, they are restored to their former state. A son,
<PB N="158" REF="1570"/>
after his father's death, if he likes any of his wives, besides his own mother, he takes them home, and uses as his own, especially if they have not had children. If a man surprizes his wife in the act with her gallant, he is entitled to all his ef∣fects, which he may immediately seize, and enjoy as his own. The king never appears abroad but once a year, on a great festival, called the Coral∣feast, which happens in May. The natives, who are merchants and traders, are obliged to carry themselves very cautiously; for, if they should be represented to the governors as great dealers, and rich, they would infallibly accuse them of some crime or other, in order to get possession of their ef∣fects. As to religion, they believe there is a God; the efficient cause of all things; yet are guilty of gross idolatry. Their sabbath happens every fifth day, when the great sacrifice cows, sheep, and goats; whilst the commonalty offer dogs, cats, and chickens, or whatever their money will reach to.</P>
<P>Benin, which gives name to the empire, and is the king's residence, is situated on the river For∣mosa, about sixty miles from its mouth. Mar∣kets are continually kept in this city for cat∣tle, cotton, elephants teeth, and European wares. The inhabitants are all natives, foreigners not being permitted to live in it. The principal in∣habitants do not concern themselves in trade, but leave all to their wives, who go to all the circum∣jacent villages, to trade in all sorts of merchandizes, and are obliged to bring the greatest part of their gains to their husbands. All the male-slaves here are foreigners; for the inhabitants cannot be sold for slaves, and only bear the name of the king's slaves: nor is it allowed to export any male-slaves that are sold in this country, but females may be dealt with according to every one's pleasure.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="1580"/>
About fifty miles from the mouth of the For∣mosa stands Areba, a common trading place for the Europeans. Here the Dutch have a factory.</P>
<P>On an island in the middle of the Formosa, and not far from its mouth stands Agatton, a place of some trade, several considerable fairs or markets be∣ing held in it.</P>
<P>About twenty miles from Benin, to the south, stands Awerri, the capital of a kingdom of the same name, whose king is independent of that of Benin.</P>
<P>In the Gulph of Benin lie several islands, one of which, called the Prince's Isle, is held by the Por∣tuguese, who have a strong fort on it. It yields them vast quantities of provisions, with which they victual their ships, and also supply foreigners. There are several other large rivers that fall into the Bite or Gulph of Benin or Guinea, besides Formo∣sa. At Cape Formosa, the trade consists in ele∣phants teeth, wax, and honey.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LOWER-GUINEA.</HEAD>
<P>Lower-Guinea, or Congo, has Upper-Guinea, or the kingdom of Benin, on the north; the Ethi∣opic Ocean on the west; the kingdom of Mata∣man, and part of Caffraria, on the south; but its boundaries east, and north-east, are not yet ascer∣tained. Along the coast, it extends from Capo Lopo, in the first degree of south latitude, to Cape Negro, in about the middle of the seven∣teenth degree of the same latitude, that is, about nine hundred and ninety English miles.</P>
<P>This large country is watered with many rivers, and would be very fruitful, if better cultivated; but nothing can conquer the laziness of the ne∣groes, who, for the most part, chuse rather to live in want, than give themselves the trouble to get a
<PB N="160" REF="1590"/>
comfortable livelihood. The mountains abound with the most precious metals, as gold, silver, and copper; but none but the iron mines are wrought, and that chiefly for the sake of arms. The southern coasts of Congo, Angola, &amp;c. are under the domi∣nion of the Portuguese: no other nation has set∣tlements there; but other Europeans are suffered to traffic with that part of the coast for negroes.</P>
<P>Lower-Guinea, or Congo, is commonly divided into Loango, Congo-Proper, Angola, and Ben∣guela.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>LOANGO.</HEAD>
<P>Loango is the most northern part of Congo in general, having Benin on the north; Makoko on the east; Congo-Proper on the south; and the Ethiopic Ocean on the west.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are very black, well-shaped, and of a mild temper. The men wear long petticoats, from the waist downwards, and have round their waist a piece of cloth, half an ell or a quarter broad, over which they wear the skin of a leopard, or some other wild beast, hanging before them like an apron. On their head they wear a cap made of grass, and quilted, with a feather a-top of it; and on their shoulder, or in their hand, they carry a buffaloes tail, to drive away the muskettos. The women's petticoats are made only of straw, about an ell square, with which they cover their privities, but leave the greatest part of their thighs and but∣tocks bare: the rest of their body is quite bare, except that on their legs they wear little strings of beads made of shells, and small bracelets of ivory on their arms. They anoint themselves with palm-oil, mixed with a kind of red wood, re∣duced to powder.</P>
<P>This country abounds with poultry, oxen, cows, sheep, goats, elephants, tigers, leopards, civet-cats,
<PB N="161" REF="1600"/>
and other animals; so that here are great quantities of elephants teeth, and fine furs to be traded for.</P>
<P>The capital city, where the king resides, is cal∣led Loango or Banza-Loangeri, and in the lan∣guage of the negroes, Boaric. This city is situ∣ated in 4° and a half, south lat. a league and a half from the sea coast. It is a pretty large city, shaded and adorned with bananas, palm, and other trees. The king, who resides in a large palace in the middle of it, has about one thousand five hundred concubines. If any of them is surprised in adultery, she and her paramour are instantly conveyed to the top of a very high hill, whence they are hurled down headlong from the sleepest place.</P>
<P>Every man marries as many wives here as he pleases, who are obliged to get their husbands livelihood, as is the practice all along the African coast inhabited by blacks. The women therefore cultivate the land, sow and reap, while the lazy husbands loiter away their time in idleness.</P>
<P>The king's revenue consists in elephants teeth, copper, and a kind of petticoats made of palm∣tree leaves, and called lavogus: he has whole store houses full of these lavogus; but his greatest riches consist in slaves of both sexes.</P>
<P>On every festival the king appears in public in the large square before his palace, where the great men of the kingdom dance and caper be∣fore him, to do him honour. The moment they come to the entrance of the square, they pros∣trate themselves on the ground, and then rising again, they advance dancing towards the king, and being near his person, sit down on the ground.</P>

Christianity, or rather popery, had once made a great progress in this kingdom; but what the state thereof is at present we cannot pretend to say.</P>
<P>To the west of Loango lies the kingdom of An∣zico, and the country of the Jagas or Jagos, the in∣habitants of which, if we will credit Dapper, are man-eaters; and human flesh is sold in their sham∣bles, instead of beef and mutton.</P>
<P>Congo-Proper is bounded on the north by the river Zaire; on the east by a ridge of mountains, and the kingdom of Matamba; on the south by Angola, from which it is parted by the river Dande; and on the west by the Ethiopic or Atlantic Ocean. Its extent along the sea-coast, from the mouth of the river Zaire to Cape Dande, is about sixty leagues; but how far it reaches to the eastward, seems not to be well ascertained.</P>
<P>It is watered by several rivers, the chief of which is the Zaire above mentioned, otherwise called the Great River of Congo. This river is very large, but not navigable above twenty or twenty-five miles up, by reason of the rocks and falls in it. The produce of the country is much the same as that of Loango. The revenues of the king arise from the tribute paid by the lords of the several provinces, who are his vassals; and consist in sim∣bes or little shells, which serve instead of money, both here and in several other parts of Africa, mil∣let, and cattle. Some of the vassals are so generous as to make the king a present of a couple of goats, besides the tribute-money; but others give him only some fruit, or a little palm-wine, nuts, and oil.</P>
<P>Before the Portuguese came into this country, the people were immersed in the grossest idolatry. They worshipped snakes, goats, tigers, and other wild beasts, imagining, that the homage they paid them would hinder them from doing them any harm. Birds, plants, and trees, and even skins of animals,
<PB N="163" REF="1620"/>
stuffed with straw, were objects of their worship: but though most of the negroes here do outwardly profess and conform to the Roman catholic reli∣gion, yet the greatest part of them are still idola∣ters in their hearts, and secretly worship their own false gods. They who live near churches, and in the sight of the Portuguese, get themselves married by a priest, but they will not take the trouble to go far for that blessing; and even they who are mar∣ried by a priest, according to the ceremonies of the church, do not fulfil their engagements, for they take as many concubines as they can maintain.</P>
<P>The principal place in Congo-Proper is Banza Congo, i. e. the Chief Town of Congo, as the na∣tives call it; but the Portuguese call it San Sal∣vador. The Europeans in this city, it is said, are above four thousand; and they have introduced into it all sorts of arts and trades. Here are neither fleas, muskettos, nor bugs; but, instead of them, a vast number of ants, which are very troublesome.</P>
<P>Angola has Congo Proper on the north; Ma∣lemba, or Majemba, on the east; Benguela on the south; and the ocean on the west. Though the Europeans call this country Angola, its true name is Dombo. It is watered by several rivers, the chief of which are the Dande and the Coansa, and is very fruitful in maiz and millet. The in∣habitants differ but little from those of Congo in manners, dress, and religion.</P>
<P>The capital of the kingdom, called Loanda, is seated near the sea-shore, in 8°. 30′. south latitude, and has a good harbour. It is said to contain about three thousand houses belonging to Eu∣ropeans, and is the usual residence of the Roman catholic bishop. The Jesuits, before their late ex∣pulsion from the dominions of Portugal, are said to have had above twelve thousand slaves here. Over against the town lies a small island, on the sand of which are gathered those shells called sim∣bis
<PB N="164" REF="1630"/>
or zimbis, which serve instead of current coin with negroes. The right of gathering them the king of Portugal has reserved to himself.</P>
<P>Benguela has Angola on the north; the coun∣try of Jaga Casanji on the east; the kingdom of Mutapan on the south; and the ocean on the west. The coast begins near the mouth of the river Coan∣sa, or at Cape Ledo, and extends to Cape Negro, about four hundred and thirty miles. The coun∣try in general is exceeding fruitful, yielding maiz and millet, with orange, lemon, banana, and other trees, black cattle, hogs, iron, &amp;c. The Por∣tuguese have settlements at Old Benguela, Maniki∣congo, and other places.</P>
<P>To what hath been already said in relation to the African trade, in our description of England and elsewhere, we shall here only add a few general ob∣servations, for the farther information and gratifi∣cation of our readers.</P>
<P>In 1730 the African company, as they were nei∣ther obliged nor in a condition to maintain the sorts and castles at their own sole cost and charge, the trade being then free and open, petitioned the par∣liament, and obtained for that purpose ten thousand pounds. This sum was annually continued to them, except for two or three years, till 1751, when an act was made, in consequence of which the company ceased to be a corporation after the tenth of April 1752, and their sorts, castles, and all their other possessions in Africa, were vested in a new company of merchants; but the trade, by virtue of this act, and that of the twenty-third of George II. being laid open to all his majesty's subjects, the parliament allow this company ten thousand pounds per annum for the support of the forts and castles for the public service.</P>
<P>The exports from England to Africa, at present, consist of annabasses, arrangos, rough amber, brass
<PB N="165" REF="1640"/>
of all sorts, blankets, bays, bells, amber-beads, crystal, coral, and all other beads, broad-cloth, boy∣sadoes, carpets, camblets, copper of all sorts, cot∣ton, stuffs of all kinds, worsteds, damasks, drug∣gets, earthen-ware, fringe, flint, fire-steels, fuzees, muskets, carbines, blunderbusses, pistols, gunpow∣der; a variety of silks, calicoes, and drugs, from the East-Indies; fine hats, felt hats, handkerchiefs, hollands, iron bars, wrought iron, knives, scissars, hardware of all sorts, lead bars, sheets, and shot; liquors, as arrack, brandy, beer, rum, malt spirits, wines, long-ells, looking-glasses, medicines, paper, padlocks, pewter, perpetuanoes or ranters; provi∣sions, as pickled beef, pork, butter, cheese, bread, flour, biscuits, suet, vinegar, oil, sugar, raisins, currants, spices; tobacco, shalloons, Silesia linen, and all German, Scotch, and Irish linen cloths, sealing wax, swords of all sorts, hangers, scymitars, cutlasses, soap, slops, tallow, slate, and marble; trimmings, as lace, buttons, gold and silver thread, mohair buttons, silk thread, buckram and tapes, ticken, striped hollands and striped linens; Welsh plains, coats, waistcoats, breeches, drawers, shifts, shoes, slippers, stockings, perukes, wool-cards, all coarse woollen cloths, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The returns, as the reader must have observed from our description, consist but of three capital articles, viz. slaves, ivory, and gold. This com∣merce was formerly much more advantageous than it is now; for these commodities were then pur∣chased not only at low rates, but those rates were paid in trifles and toys, such as knives, scissars, kettles, glass beads, and cawries; but the traders and adventurers, by their strife, envy, and folly, by endeavouring to supplant one another, by under-selling and over-bidding, have taught the negroes the value of their own goods, and the cheapness of ours, and thereby to supplant
<PB N="166" REF="1650"/>
both, by holding up the price of their own produc∣tions, and running down those which we carry them for sale. Thus that gainful commerce, once superior to all others, as carrying out the meanest of all articles, and bringing home the richest, has been long upon the decline; so that we have been said to buy, even the gold, sometimes too dear. But all this while there is not the least use made of the land; the fruitful soil remains waste and uncultivated, a vast extended country, pleasant vallies, the banks of charming rivers, spacious plains, capable of im∣provement and cultivation to infinite advantage, remain barren and untouched. The late peace, and the cession of Senegal, with some prior regula∣tions, it is to be hoped, will have a happy effect in recovering, improving, and extending the African trade.</P>
<P>As the Portuguese are masters of such extensive territories in Africa, (for they are possessed of the west coast as well as of the eastern, from the tro∣pic of Capricorn to the equator, and three or four degrees farther north, and have a multitude of lit∣tle African princes under their dominion, whose subjects they furnish with the woollen manufactures of Great-Britain, having made proselytes of many of them, and taught them to cloath themselves as the Europeans do) they export more slaves from thence to America than any other nation. The English, French, and Dutch also export a great many; but the Spaniards, who are possessed of the best part of America, and want slaves most, have no settlement on the Negro or Guinea Coast, but are forced to contract with some other European nation to furnish them with negroes, which busi∣ness was performed, for a short time, by the South-Sea company; but the French, if we are not mis∣taken, have the chief benefit of it at present.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="1660"/>
Some imagine, that the gold mines of Africa are in the power of the Europeans, but in this they are mistaken; no Europeans have access to the mines of Africa, and few have ever seen any, though we have it upon the best authority, that some parts of the coast, as well as the interior country, afford mines, if the negroes would permit them to be open∣ed. The negroes esteem their gold mines sacred, and of consequence cut off the Europeans from all communication with them; a maxim founded upon true policy and self-defence, knowing how short a time they would enjoy them, if once the Europeans got footing. The precious metal is generally found in three different kinds of places. The first is in vallies, situated between mountains: here the negroes, knowing by certain marks where the gold is, dig pits, and separate it from the ad∣hering earth. The second is in and about rivers and falls of water, which, rushing down from the mountains, wash away large quantities of earth, and with it the precious metal. The third method of finding gold is on the sea coast, and at the mouths of rivers and rivulets, as at Axim: no sooner a heavy shower of rain falls, than those places are visited by hundreds of negroe women naked: each of these is furnished with a small tray, which they fill with earth, and wash repeatedly, till the gold is freed from the earth, and falls, by its specific weight, to the bottom. Some, in a whole day, may perhaps not find sixpence worth, while others are so successful as to make pounds. The gold thus dug or found is of two sorts: the one is called gold∣dust, which is as fine as flour, and most valued, both in Africa and Europe; the other kind consists of pieces of different sizes, some weighing not two∣pence, others perhaps thirty guineas; but these last are scarce: however the negroes affirm, that, in the inland countries, pieces weighing two hun∣dred
<PB N="168" REF="1670"/>
are found. These solid lumps are called mountain-gold, and, when melted, touch better than the dust if pure, which it seldom is.</P>
<P>The negroes have a variety of methods to so∣phisticate the precious metal. One is casting it in∣to pieces of different forms, called fitiches, mixed with a half, or a third part, of silver and copper: these fitiches are cut into small bits by the negroes, to the value of three farthings each, which serves for the current coin of the country. Another me∣thod of adulteration is by casting pieces of gold in such a manner that the external crust, about a line thick, shall be pure, while the inside consists wholly of copper, perhaps of iron. Another method, which they sometimes practise to deceive Europeans, is by a powder of coral or copper filings, tinged so exactly like gold that only scales can discover the cheat.</P>
<P>There are a sort of red and white beans used as currency on the Gold-Coast. Of the red beans, spotted with black, called danbays, each is equal to a Dutch stiver. The white beans, with black spots, called jacoes, pass often for four stivers; but they are less current than the others. In Bos∣man's time, the Europeans carried off from the Gold-Coast about twenty-three tons of gold in a year, or two hundred and thirty thousand pounds, allowing three marks, or twenty-four ounces, to an hundred. Of this the English African company ex∣ported twelve hundred marks, and the English in∣terlopers a thousand, and sometimes two thousand.</P>
<P>The Portuguese were the first Europeans that discovered the south-west coast of Africa, in the fif∣teenth century, and obtained a grant from the pope in 1442, of all countries discovered, or to be disco∣vered, to the south and east of Cape Bajadore, which lies on the west side of Africa, in twenty-se∣ven degrees, odd minutes, of north latitude: where∣upon
<PB N="169" REF="1680"/>
the Portuguese built forts, and settled colonies upon the western coast of Africa, and enjoyed the sole trade thither, and to the East-Indies, for upwards of an hundred years; but the English and Dutch, and other protestant powers, calling in question the pope's authority to dispose of all Pagan countries, in the sixteenth century sent their fleets to the coast of Guinea, and erected forts there. The Dutch, in particular, made themselves masters of the fort of St. George del Mina, the capital of all the Portu∣guese settlements on that coast, and at length drove them entirely from the coast of Proper-Guinea. In the reign of king Charles II. they also made themselves masters of several of the English forts upon the coast of Guinea; but these, excepting that to which they have given the name of Fort Amsterdam, they were afterwards obliged to re∣store, and they still remain in our possession.</P>

<HEAD>NIGRITIA, or NEGROLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Nigritia, or Negroland, the next country to Guinea towards the north, lies between 18°. of west and 150°. of east longitude, and between 10 and 20°. of north latitude, the great river Ni∣ger running through it from east to west. It is bounded by Zaara, or the Desert, on the north; by unknown countries on the east; by Guinea on the south; and by the Atlantic Ocean on the west. The Europeans have several settlements on the branches of the rivers Niger or Sanaga, and Gambia, espe∣cially near their mouths. A great many different nations inhabit the banks of the rivers; some Pa∣gans, some Mohammedans, of different languages, and independent of one another. The country is fruitful, especially along the rivers, abounding in rice, Guinea grain, and Indian corn, where it is cultivated; and with cocoa-nuts, plantains, pulse,
<PB N="170" REF="1690"/>
palm trees, and tropical fruits; nor is it destitute of cattle, and a variety of other animals, particu∣larly such as are found in Guinea.</P>
<P>The river Sanaga is thought to be the same with that called by antient geographers the Niger; but it hath not yet been determined whether the Gam∣bia be a distinct river, or only a branch of the Ni∣ger. As far as Europeans have been able to trace them hitherto, they appear to be different rivers. According to the information of the Mandingo ne∣groes, who, among all the blacks, are the most ad∣dicted to travelling and traffic, the former has its source from the lake Maberia, in the kingdom of Tombut, which is little more than half way to that of the Nile; but the informations of these negroes with respect to it cannot be depended upon, nei∣ther have they gone far enough back to be certain as to its real source. Thus much however is cer∣tain, that the Niger or Sanaga is a very large ri∣ver, and of great extent, especially if we should suppose, according to the opinion of the best mo∣dern geographers, that it has its source in the kingdom of Gorhan, not far from the confines of Upper-Ethiopia; for then it will cross almost the whole country of Africa, where it is widest. As the Europeans call it Niger, the natives call it Wed, or Huid Nijar, i. e. the Black River, or the River of Senegal, and the Arabs the Nile of the Nigritians; this last nation considering it as a branch of the Nile, or rather the Nile and the Niger, as two branches of the same river. The entrance into it is narrow and somewhat difficult, by reason of its immoveable bar and sandy shoals, as well as the several islands at the mouth of it, and the several canals and marshes that clog it; but, after sailing up eight or ten leagues, it is found broad and deep, and fit to carry large vessels; and, except about five or six leagues on each side, above
<PB N="17$" REF="1700"/>
the mouth, which is sandy and barren ground, in all the rest, as far as the lake Maberia, the banks are covered with stately fruit-trees and villages, and the country, in general, well watered and ve∣ry fertile; for, like the Nile, it overflows for many leagues, and enriches the land to a great de∣gree; though the inhabitants, for want of skill and industry, do not reap all the advantages that they otherwise might. The people however, on both sides, live as near as they can to it, and feed great herds of cattle, and sow large and small millet, the former of which we call Turky wheat, in great quantities, and with great increase. Upon the banks of the river, in the kingdom of Fulis, and near a lake called by the French Panier Fouli, is a large forest of fine ebony, great quantities of which are cut down, and carried off in floats down the river, and sold very cheap. If the river fails of overflowing at its usual season, a great scarcity, if not a downright famine, never fails to ensue in the adjacent country; and even when it overflows re∣gularly, it breeds such vast flights of grashoppers and insects as quite darken the air, and frequently eat up all the product of the earth, in which case, the only remedy the people have is to kill those in∣sects, and eat them, which they do either by pound∣ing them in leathern bags, and boiling them with milk, or, which is reckoned the more delicious way, by frying or broiling them over a light blaze, in a frying-pan full of holes, through which the fire burns their wings and legs, and leaves the rest of the body sufficiently roasted to be eaten as a dainty, which they look upon as very wholesome and nou∣rishing.</P>
<P>As the Niger receives many considerable rivers in its course, which swell it high enough to be able at all times to carry vessels of good burthen, so it splits itself into several branches, which uniting
<PB N="172" REF="1710"/>
again, form very large and fertile islands, well filled with towns, villages, and inhabitants. It passes also through several lakes, and over divers cataracts. After having run from east to west, during a prodigious long course, it turns at last short to the south, at a league and a half distance from the Western Ocean, leaving but a very nar∣row tract between it and the sea, into which it opens its way in lat. 15° 55′. after having run about twenty-five leagues from north to south. Its mouth is sometimes half a league broad; but is shut up, as we observed above, by a bank of quicksand, called the bar of Senegal, where the water is so shallow, that it is very difficult and dangerous to pass over it. The bar is formed by the mud and sand which the river brings with it, during the inundation, and which the sea continually drives back upon the shore. This would effectually exclude all shipping, had not the violence of the current, and the weight of the waters, made two openings or channels, which are called the passes of the bar. The largest is commonly not above one hundred and fifty or two hundred fathoms broad, and about ten feet deep, so that none but barks of forty or fifty tons can get through this channel. The other is so narrow and shallow, that it is passable for canoes only. These channeis are not always in the same place; for the river, as it is more or less swelled, and its current more or less rapid, opens those passes sometimes in one place, and sometimes in another. The bar itself also often shifts its place, so that the island of Sanaga, or Senegal, is at one time four leagues distant from it, and at another no more than two. It is this bar only which hinders ships of four or five hundred tons to go up the river.</P>
<P>Among other Islands in the river, is that of Sa∣naga, or Senegal, which is now possessed by the
<PB N="173" REF="1720"/>
English, having been taken from the French during the late war. It lies about fifteen miles from the mouth of the river, being about one mile and a quarter in length from north to south, and almost half a mile broad from east to west. The soil is composed of a bed of loose sand, productive of nothing but what is forced by art and the richest manure: notwithstanding which it contains three thousand inhabitants, whose principal food is fish and maiz. This sort of corn grows in great plenty almost all over the country. The river on the east side is said to be three hundred and eighty fathoms broad in the dry season, and on the west two hundred and ten. The water of the wells that are dug here is always brackish, and so is that of the river in the dry season; but when it is swelled by the rains, the water is sweet and whole∣some.</P>
<P>To the north-east, east, and south-east of this island, the country, as far as it is known, is over∣run with woods and marshes; the Sanaga, Gam∣bia, and Sherbro, which by some are looked upon as branches of the same river, passing through it in their way to the Atlantic ocean. During the rainy months, which begin in July, and continue to October, they lay the whole country under water; and, indeed, the very sudden rise of these rivers is incredible to those who have never been within the tropics, and are unacquainted with the violent rains that fall there. At Galam, nine hun∣dred miles from the mouth of the Sanaga, the waters rise one hundred and fifty feet perpendicular from the bed of the river. At the island of Sene∣gal, the river rises gradually, during the rainy sea∣son, above twenty feet perpendicular over part of that flat coast, which of itself so freshens the water, that ships lying at anchor at the distance of three leagues from its mouth, generally make use of it,
<PB N="174" REF="1730"/>
and fill their water there for their voyage home. When the rains are at an end, which usually hap∣pens in October, the intense heat of the sun soon dries up those waters, which lie on the higher parts, and the remainder forms lakes of stagnated waters, in which are found all sorts of dead animals. These waters every day decrease, till at last they are quite exhaled, and then the effluvia that arise are almost unsupportable. At this season the winds blow so very hot from off the land, that they may well be compared to the heat proceeding from the mouth of an oven, and they bring with them a smell that is quite intolerable. Their ef∣fects upon wolves, tigers, lions, and other wild beasts, are such, that they are seen to resort to the river, keeping their body under water, and only their snout above it, for the sake of breathing. The birds likewise are seen to soar to an immense height, and to fly a vast way over the sea, where they continue till the wind changes, and comes from the west. It may seem surprizing, that a part of the world so unwholesome as this should yet be so populous; but the wonder will cease when it is known, that the greatest pride among the men consists in the number of their wives, so that every one takes as many as he can maintain; some six, others eight, and others, twelve at a time.</P>
<P>One of the most considerable articles of com∣merce, and the chief inducement to Europeans for settling here, is the gum Senega, so denominated from the river; the forests on the banks thereof abounding with this gum, which pretty much re∣sembles the gum Arabic. Dyers, and other arti∣ficers, consume the greatest quantities of it. The French, before the late war, when they were in pos∣session of this part of the African coast, from Cape Blanco to the river Gambia, about four hun∣dred miles in extent, engrossed this valuable trade
<PB N="175" REF="1740"/>
wholly to themselves. Hence it is, that this coast, notwithstanding its unhealthiness, and roads so dangerous for shipping, hath nevertheless been eagerly contended for by the English, French, Dutch, and Portuguese. All strove to settle here in their turns, that by being masters of the Se∣negal rivers, they might be also masters of the gum trade; a trade, which seems a light matter in itself, but is, in effect, very considerable, whe∣ther we regard the price the natives sell the gum for, which is very moderate; the great demand for it, and its usefulness; or, lastly, the quantity of European merchandizes it takes off ready wrought; the vent of which makes manufactures spread, money circulate, and so finds work for abundance of hands, which is the main end of commerce.</P>
<P>The mouth of the river Gambia lies in 13°. 20′. north latitude, and in 16°. of longitude west of London. It is formed on the north side by Bar∣rah Point, and on the south by Banion Point, being about four miles over. This river, as we observed al∣ready, is generally supposed to be a branch of the Niger; for the Mundingo negroes affirm, that the Niger, having run from its spring to a place called Baracota, divides itself there into two branches; one of which, running southward, is called Gam∣bia, which, after a pretty long course, loses or seems to lose itself, in a marshy lake, full of weeds and reeds, so thick and strong that it is impassable; af∣terwards, coming out of that lake, it appears again a fine deep river, such as it is seen at Baràcanda, whither the Europeans go to trade with the Mun∣dingo merchants.</P>
<P>The English, Portuguese, and French, have set∣tlements on this river. The principal English set∣tlement is in a small island, called James's Island, which lies about ten miles from the rivers,
<PB N="176" REF="1750"/>
mouth, where it is at least seven miles wide. There is also a considerable factory at Gyllifree, a large town on the north bank of the river, near James's Island; and another higher up the river at Joar, in the kingdom of Barsally. The chief set∣tlement of the French is at Albedra, between the river's mouth and James's Fort.</P>
<P>The sides of the river Gambia are, for the most part, flat and woody, for about a quarter of a mile inland; and within that are pleasant open grounds, which they use for their rice, and, in the dry sea∣son, serve the cattle for pasture. The country more inland is generally very woody; but near the towns there is always a large space of clear ground for corn. The soil is mostly sand, with some clay, and a great deal of rocky ground. Near the sea, and the lower part of the river, no hills are to be seen; but high up the river are some lofty moun∣tains. The property of all the palm and cocoa-trees are vested in the petty kings; insomuch that no one dare cut any leaves, or draw any wine from them, without their previous knowledge or consent. The ciboa-tree is very much like the palm-tree, and grows to a great height: the leaves which grow on the top are very useful for covering of houses, and the natives extract wine out of it exactly in the same way as out of the palm-tree.</P>
<P>The languages generally spoken along the Gam∣bia are the Mundingo, a bastard sort of Portuguese, and the Arabic: the second is chiefly used by the Europeans, and the last by the Pholeys, and most of the Mohammedan tribes.</P>
<P>The chief trade here is in gold, slaves, elephants teeth, and bees-wax. The gold is of a very good quality, and finer than sterling gold. The slaves are either prisoners taken in war, or persons condemned for crimes, or stolen. Stealing is very common here; and, since the slave trade has been used, all punish∣ments
<PB N="177" REF="1760"/>
are changed into slavery. The English ne∣ver buy any person that they suspect has been sto∣len, without sending for the chief men of the place, and consulting with them about the matter. Ivo∣ry or elephants teeth, by the natives called mor∣phel, is got either by hunting and killing the beasts, or picked up in the woods: whoever kills an elephant has liberty to sell him, and his teeth. The larger the teeth, the more valuable the ivory. Some of them are white, others yellow; but the difference of colour makes no difference of price. A great deal of bees-wax is made and sold about the river: that which is clearest from dirt is best. It is tried by boring through the cakes, which are from twenty to an hundred and twenty pounds weight. Some gum-dragon is also brought from this country, which comes from a tree called pau de sangue, or blood-wood. Upon wounding this tree, drops like blood ooze out of it, which run into lumps, and are dried in the sun.</P>
<P>Between thirty and forty leagues to the south of Senegal river lies Cape Verd, or the Green Cape, so called from the vast number of trees upon it, which are always green; whereas most of the other capes are dry, sandy, and barren. It is the most western point of Africa: the islands in the Atlan∣tic Ocean, to which it gives name, lie upwards of three hundred miles from it. Not far from the shore here is the island of Goree, which the English took from the French in the late war, but restored at the peace. It is small and barren, without any wood, or water, but what the inhabitants pre∣serve in cisterns; but its situation, harbour, and good anchoring all round, render it very considera∣ble for those nations that have any settlements on that part of the African coast.</P>
<P>Among the nations inhabiting Negroland, the most considerable, of those at least that are known
<PB N="178" REF="1770"/>
to the Europeans, are the Floops, Pholeys, Jol∣lifs, and Mundingoes. The last are said to exceed all the other negroes in wit, civility, and industry; and next to these are the Pholeys: both these na∣tions are Mohammedans.</P>
<P>Before we close our account of this part of Africa, it will not be amiss to take notice of a tree of a new genus which grows in Senegal, and may justly be accounted the largest vegetable in nature. The real name of this tree is baobab; the Jolliffs, or Oualoffs, natives of the country, call it goui, and its fruit boui; but the French call it calabassier or the calabash-tree, and the fruit pain de singe, or monkey's bread. The baobab will not grow but in a very hot climate: it delights in a sandy and moist soil, especially if this soil is free from stones, that might hurt its roots; for the least scratch they re∣ceive is soon followed by a caries, which communi∣cates itself to the trunk of the tree, and infallibly destroys it. The trunk of this singular tree is not very high, not exceeding twelve or fifteen feet from the roots to the branches; but several have been seen by Europeans seventy-five and seventy-eight feet round, that is, from twenty-five to twenty-seven feet in diameter. The first branches extend almost horizontally, and being very thick, and about six∣ty feet in length, their own weight bends down their extremities to the ground; the centre branches rise perpendicularly, but so as to make a sheling; and the tree, being thus regularly rounded, its trunk is absolutely hidden, and it appears as an hemispherical mass of verdure, of about an hundred and twenty, an hundred and thirty, or an hundred and forty feet in diameter.</P>
<P>The roots of the baobab are answerable to its size in all respects; and to the branches above there is a correspondent number of radical branches be∣low. The leaves are about five inches long, and
<PB N="179" REF="1780"/>
two broad, and pointed at both extremities. They adhere three, five, or seven, but most commonly seven, in the manner of a fan, on a common pedi∣cle, much like those of the chesnut tree. After the falling of the petals and stamina, the ovary, as it ripens, becomes an oblong fruit, pointed at both extremities, fifteen or eighteen feet long, and five or six broad. The seed is of a shining brown co∣lour, nearly of the figure of a kidney-bean, five lines in length, and three in breadth, and the pulp that surrounds them is easily reduced to a powder, brought hither from the Levant, and known, for a long time, by the very improper name of terra lemnia; being sold by the Mandingoes to the Arabs, and by them distributed through all the Levant.</P>
<P>Besides the caries mentioned above, this tree is subject to a kind of mouldiness, that gets into the whole ligneous body, and without changing the texture of its fibres, softens it so, that it has no more consistence than the ordinary pith of trees, and is easily overturned by a moderate blast of wind.</P>
<P>The real country of the baobab is Africa, and particularly the western coast of that part which extends from the Niger to the kingdom of Benin. The growth of it is very rapid in the first years suc∣ceeding its birth, but diminishes afterwards very considerably; and, though the proportion of this diminution is not certainly known, it is certain, that the latter growth of the baobab proceeds with an extreme slowness; and that such of those trees as have arrived at the above-mentioned bulk, might have first appeared out of the earth not long after the Universal Deluge. The baobab, as all other plants of the malvaceous tribe, has an emollient virtue, capable of maintaining in the body an abun∣dant transpiration, and of opposing the too great heat of the blood: hence its leaves, either reduced to powder, or by way of decoction, are found of
<PB N="180" REF="1790"/>
great efficacy in preserving from or mitigating the heat of urine, and hot fevers, which often attack foreigners at Senegal, during the month of Sep∣tember. The fresh or newly gathered fruit is not less useful than its leaves; its pulp is eaten, which is subacid, and agreeable enough; by mixing its juice with water, and a little sugar, a liquor is made, attended with the best effects in all hot af∣fections, and in putrid or pestilential fevers; lastly, when the fruit is spoiled, the negroes make excel∣lent soap of it, by burning it, and mixing its ashes with the oil of the palm-tree, that begins to be rancid.</P>
<P>Another and very singular use is made of the trunk of this tree by the natives. As the caries, to which it is subject, often makes it hollow, they en∣large those cavities, and form a sort of chambers out of them, where they hang the dead bodies of those to whom they are unwilling to grant the ho∣nour of burial: those bodies dry there perfectly, and become real mummies, without any other pre∣paration. The greatest number of the bodies so dried is of the Guiriots, who are their jugglers, poets, and musicians, and have a sort of inspection over feasts and dances. On account of this kind of superiority of talents, they are regarded as for∣cerers, and ministers of the devil, and consequently dreaded by the other negroes, who think that their bodies would draw down a malediction upon the earth or water should that receive them: hence it is, that they hide and dry them in the hollow trunks of the baobab.</P>

<HEAD>ZAARA.</HEAD>
<P>This vast inhospitable region, which is rightly named by the Arabs Sara, Zara, but more proper∣ly Zahara, which signifies a Desert, stretches itself
<PB N="181" REF="1800"/>
from the Atlantic Ocean on the west, to the Desert of Barca and Nubia on the east; that is, from the eighth degree of west to the twenty-sixth of east longitude; and from Biledulgerid on the north, to Negroland on the south; or from the fifteenth de∣gree of latitude quite to the tropic of Cancer, and even beyond; so that it will be about four hun∣dred or five hundred miles in breadth, from north to south; and above fifteen hundred in length, from east to west. The river Niger is its boundary to the south. It was known to the antients by the name of Libya Interior, or Libya Deserta; and is supposed to have been then inhabited by the Getuli. At present it is mostly inhabited by Arabs, who, for the generality, are an ignorant, brutish, and savage people, who lead a wandering life, and live chiefly on the milk of their flocks, with a little barley-meal, and some dates. The poorer sort go naked, except the females, who commonly wrap a clout about their middle, and wear a kind of bonnet on their head; but the wealthier sort have a kind of loose gown, made of blue callicoe, with large sleeves, that is brought them from Negroland. Both sexes are very swar∣thy; the men tall and thin, but the women fat and lusty. When they move from one place to ano∣ther for fresh pasture, water, or prey, most of them ride on camels, which have generally a sort of saddle between the bunch and the neck, with a string or strap run through their nostrils, which serves for a bridle; and, instead of spurs, they use a sharp bodkin. Their tents or huts are covered with a coarse stuff, made of camels hair, and a kind of wool or moss that grows on the palm trees. These Arabs live here, under the government of their sheiks or cheyks, as in Arabia, Egypt, and other places.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="1810"/>
So destitute of water and provisions is most part of this country, that many of the camels which form the caravans that travel from Moroc∣co to Guinea, are laden with water and necessaries. It is also terribly infested with scorpions, vipers, and other venemous reptiles and insects, as well as lions, tigers, and such like fierce animals. At some particular seasons, there are seen flights of locusts, which soon devour all the little verdure they have. Besides these Arabs, there is a people here, who live in settled habitations, and are more civil and hospitable, carrying on a kind of com∣merce with strangers. The religion of both is a kind of Mohammedism. The chief commodi∣ties here are their camels and other cattle, their dates, and the fat and feathers of their ostriches. Gold-dust also is said to be found in some parts of it. When the water that is carried on the camels backs through these deserts happens to fail, they commonly kill the camels themselves, and drink the water they find in their stomachs; it being the nature of that animal, whenever he finds a suffi∣ciency of that element to drink enough at one time to serve him a whole fortnight.</P>
<P>In the province or desert of Azaoad are two tombs, with inscriptions, importing that the un∣happy persons there interred were, the one a wealthy merchant, and the other a poor carrier, who both died with thirst. The former had given a thousand ducats to the latter for a cruise of water.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>BILEDULGERID.</HEAD>
<P>This country hath its name from the Arabic Biled-el-gerid, signifying the Land of Dates, be∣cause it abounds with that kind of fruit more than any other territory in Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="1820"/>
This country, which was antiently called Nu∣midia, is said to be almost of a square form, ex∣tending itself above eighty leagues every way, or from 28°. 30′. to 32°. 50′. of latitude; and from 5°. 30′. to 11°. 50′. of east longitude. It is bound∣ed on the east by a ridge of high mountains, which part it from the kingdom of Tripoli and part of Gadamis; on the south by Zaara; on the north by the dominions of Tunis; and on the west by those of Algiers.</P>
<P>The whole country of Biledulgerid is very moun∣tainous, sandy, and barren, except some parts of it that are quite covered with large thick forests of palm-trees, which yield vast quantities of dates. Formerly, however, it was tolerably fruitful, when it was possessed by an industrious people; but the Mohammedans, who are now masters of it, taking no care to cultivate the soil, it produces little more than Zaara. The climate is hot and unhealthy, and the people lean, and of a swarthy and shrivelled complexion. Notwithstanding the plague is so frequent in Barbary, it is said, it is scarcely ever heard of here, any more than the small-pox. The inhabitants are a mixture of antient Africans and wild Arabs; the former living in a kind of towns and villages, and the latter in tents, rambling from place to place. One of the chief diversions of the natives is the hunting of ostriches, which are said to be as high here as a man on horseback: they eat their flesh, barter their feathers for corn and other things they want, use their fat or oil as a me∣dicine, make pendants for their ears of their ta∣lons, and turn the skins into knapsacks. Besides the flesh of ostriches, and dates, they eat also the flesh of goats and camels, and drink their milk. Some of them own no superior, others have their sheiks or lords, and others are subject to, or at least
<PB N="184" REF="1830"/>
tributary to the neighbouring states of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>BARBARY.</HEAD>
<P>The vast region included under the name of Barbary, is bounded on the north by the Mediter∣ranean Sea, which divides it from Europe; on the east by Egypt; on the south by Zaara, and Bile∣dulgerid; and on the west by the Atlantic or Wes∣tern Ocean. Its utmost extent from east to west, that is, from cape None, on the most western coast of Morocco, to the confines of Egypt, is almost 37°, that is from 10° of west, to 26½ of east lon∣gitude, or about two thousand two hundred miles. As for its breadth from north to south, it is very unequal, in some parts not above 6 or 7°; and where widest, as from Cape None to Tangier, not above 10°; but we must observe, that most geographers have given it a greater extent both ways, by including the creeks and windings.</P>
<P>Barbary is, next to Egypt, the most fertile, trad∣ing, and populous part of Africa. The soil abounds with plenty and variety of grain and fruits, espe∣cially citrons, oranges, dates, figs, olives, grapes, pomegranates, and almonds, in all which the inha∣bitants drive a considerable trade, as well as in co∣ral, Morocco leather, Barbary horses, and other commodities. The air is healthy though hot, being tempered by constant breezes from the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The coast of Barbary was probably first planted by the Egyptians. The Phenicians afterwards sent colonies thither, and built Utica and Carthage. The Carthaginians soon became powerful and wealthy by trade, and finding the country divided into a great many little kingdoms and states, either subdued them, or made the princes tributary, who
<PB N="185" REF="1840"/>
being weary of their yoke, were glad of the op∣portunity of assisting the Romans in subduing Carthage. The Romans remained sovereigns of the coast of Barbary, till the Vandals, in the fifth century, reduced it under their dominion. The Roman or rather the Grecian emperors hav∣ing some time after recovered the coast of Bar∣bary from the Vandals, it remained under their do∣minion, till the Saracen caliphs, the successors of Mahomet, made an entire conquest of all the north of Africa in the seventh century, and divided the country among their chiefs, of whom the sove∣reign of Morocco was the most considerable, pos∣sessing the north west part of the country, which, in the Roman division, obtained the name of Mau∣ritania Tingitana, from Tingis or Tangier the ca∣pital, and is now stiled the empire of Morocco, comprehending the kingdoms or provinces of Fez and Morocco. The emperors of these territories are almost always at war with the Spaniards and Portuguese. In the eighth century their ancestors made a conquest of the greatest part of Spain; but after the loss of Granada, which happened about the year 1492, they were dispossessed of this country; and Ferdinand and Isabella, who were then upon the throne of Spain, obliged them ei∣ther to renounce their religion, or transport them∣selves to the coast of Africa. Those who embraced the latter alternative, to revenge themselves on the Spaniards, and supply their necessities, confederated with the Mohammedan princes on the coast of Barbary, and having fitted out little fleets of cruis∣ing vessels, took all the Spanish merchant ships they met with at sea, and being well acquainted with the country, landed in Spain, whence they car∣ried off multitudes of Spaniards, and made slaves of them. The Spaniards hereupon assembled a fleet of men of war, invaded Barbary, and hav∣ing
<PB N="186" REF="1850"/>
taken Oran, and many other places on the coast of Algier, were in a fair way of making an entire conquest of the country. In this distress the African princes applied to the famous Turkish rover, Barbarossa, desiring his assistance against the Christians. He readily complied with their request, but had no sooner repulled their enemies than he usurped the government of Algiers, and treated the people who called him in as slaves; as his brother Heyradin Barbarossa afterwards did the people of Tunis; and a third obtained the govern∣ment of Tripoli by the same means. In these usur∣pations they were supported by the grand seignor, who claimed the sovereignty of the whole coast, and for some time they were esteemed the subjects of Turkey, and governed by Turkish bashas or viceroys; but each of these states, or rather the military men, at length took upon them to elect a sovereign out of their own body, and rendered themselves independent of the Turkish empire. The grand seignor now has not so much as a basha or officer at Algier; but the dey acts as an absolute prince, and is only liable to be deposed by the sol∣diery that advanced him. Tunis also and Tripoli have now entirely shaken off that dependence, which ever since the days of the famous Barba∣rossa, for above two hundred years, they had on the Turkish empire.</P>
<P>A seraskier, who was lately sent by the porte to Algier, to demand twenty years tribute, which was then due, was answered by the dey, that he was firmly resolved not only to refuse to discharge the arrear, but also to pay any tribute for the future: that the state of Algier was absolutely free and in∣dependent of the Porte; that it stood in no need of the Porte's protection; and that he the seraskier might return to Constantinople with that answer. The seraskier was not more fortunate in the execu∣tion
<PB N="187" REF="1860"/>
of his commission to the rest of these states on whom he had demands of the same nature, and received answers from them all nearly to the same purpose. We do not find that the Porte took any measures in consequence of this refusal, either to inforce the demand, or to resent the contempt shewn to its authority, though it was then at peace with all its neighbours.</P>
<P>These states still continue to plunder and harrass the Spaniards, having never been at peace with them since the loss of Granada. They make prizes also of all other Christian ships, that have Spanish goods or passengers on board, and even those that have not, unless they have purchased peace of them. The Turks of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, are an abandoned race, consisting of pirates, banditti, and the very refuse of Turkey, who have been forced to leave their several countries, to avoid the punishment of their crimes.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular descrip∣tion of the several kingdoms usually comprehend∣ed under the name of Barbary, viz. Morocco and Fez, Algier, Tunis, Tripoli, and Barca, all which, except the first, lie along the coast of the Mediterranean.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOROCCO EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This empire, comprehending the kingdoms of Mo∣rocco and Fez, answering nearly to the Mauntania Tingitanea of the antients, is bounded by the medi∣teranean sea on the north; by the river Malva, or Mullooïah, as it is called by the Moors, which divides it from Algier on the east; by Biledulgerid on the south; and by the Atlantic ocean on the west; being about five hundred miles in length from south to north, and two hundred broad from east to west.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="1870"/>
The air of this country, though hot and dry, is pleasant and healthy, the winds from the sea and Mount Atlas refreshing the inhabitants in the hot∣test season.</P>
<P>As to the soil, it is neither so mountainous, sandy, or barren, as many other parts of Africa, but produces, or would produce, if duly cultivated, vast quantities of corn, wine, and oil: no county affords better wheat, barley, or rice; both the French and Spaniards fetch these from the Barbary coast, when they have a scarcity at home; and our garrisons of Gibraltar and Port-Mahon are often supplied with provisions from thence. The plains of Fez and Morocco are well planted with olives, and there are no better grapes for making wine in the world, as the Jews at Tetuan experience; though the cultivation of vines is not encouraged among the Mahommedans, in consequence of the precept in the Coran, forbidding the drinking of wine. Here are also other fruits, as dates, figs, raisins, almonds, apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, with plenty of roots and herbs, hemp, flax, sugar, ho∣ney, and wax; but they have not many forest trees, and scarce any good timber; possibly their soil is not proper for timber, or they take no care to pre∣serve it, having little occasion for any.</P>
<P>The animals of this part of Africa, whether wild or tame, are much the same we meet with to the southward, except the elk, the elephant, and the rhinoceros, which no travellers pretend to meet with in the empire of Morocco; and as they want these, so they have some others not to be found in the South of Africa, particularly camels, dromedaries, and that fine breed of horses, called barbs, which, for their beauty and swiftness, can scarce be paralleled in the world. Nor are their horses to be admired only for their beauty and
<PB N="189" REF="1880"/>
speed, but their use in war, being extremely ready to obey their riders upon the least sign, in charging, wheeling, or retiring; so that the trooper has his hands very much at liberty, and can make the best use of his arms.</P>
<P>As to mountains, the chief are that chain which goes under the name of Mount Atlas, and runs the whole length of Barbary, from east to west, passing through Morocco, and abutting upon that ocean, which separates the eastern from the wes∣tern continent, and is from this mountain called the Atlantic Ocean. This mountain, as the poets feigned, sustained the universe; hence we see Atlas represented with the world upon his shoulders, and descriptions of the globe, or sets of maps dignified with the name of Atlas. Dr. Shaw, however, as∣sures us that this chain cannot stand in competition either with the Alps or Appennines for height. Near the streights stands the mountain antiently called Abyla, and now, if we are not mistaken, by our countrymen stiled the Apes hill.</P>
<P>The principal rivers, besides the Malva, or Mulvia above mentioned, which rises in the deserts, and running from south to north, divides Morocco from the kingdom of Algiers, are the Suz, Om∣mirabih, Rabbatta, Larache, Darodt, Sebon, Gueron and Tensift, which rise in Mount Atlas, and fall into the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>The chief capes are Cape Threeforks, on the Miditerranean, Cape Spartel, at the entrance of the straits, Cape Cantin, Cape None, and Cape Rajador, on the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>Of the bays the most considerable are, the bay of Tetuan, in the Mediterranean, and the bay of Tangier, in the strait of Gibraltar.</P>
<P>There are some mines of very fine copper in this empire; but, if there are any of gold and
<PB N="190" REF="1890"/>
silver, as some writers tell us, they have never been opened, as far as we can find.</P>
<P>The traffic of the empire by land, is either with Arabia or Negroland: to Mecca they send cara∣vans, consisting of several thousand camels, horses, and mules, twice every year, partly for traffic, and partly upon a religious account; for numbers of pilgrims take that opportunity of paying their de∣votions to their great prophet. The goods they carry to the East are woollen manufactures, very fine Morocco skins, indigo, cochineal, and ostrich feathers; and they bring back from thence, silk, muslins, and drugs. By their caravans to Negro∣land, they send salt, silk, and woollen manufactures, and bring back gold and ivory in return, but chiefly negroes; for from hence it is, that their emperor chiefly recruits his black cavalry, tho' there are also great numbers born in the country; for they bring those of both sexes very young from Ne∣groland, the females for breeders, and the males for soldiers: as they grow up, the first carry a mus∣ket, and serve on foot, and after some time are preferred to be cavaliers: and as they have no other hopes or dependence but the favour of the empe∣ror, they prove much the most dutiful and obse∣quious of all his subjects, and indeed, support his tyranny over the rest. The caravans always go strong enough to defend themselves against the wild Arabs in the deserts of Africa and Asia; tho' notwithstanding all their vigilance, some of the stragglers and baggage often fall into their hands: they are also forced to load one half of their camels with water, to prevent their perishing with drought and thirst in those inhospitable deserts; and there is still a more dangerous enemy, and that is the sand itself; when the winds rise, the caravan is per∣fectly blinded with dust; and there have been in∣stances
<PB N="191" REF="1900"/>
both in Africa and Asia, where whole cara∣vans, and even armies, have been buried alive in the sands. There is no doubt also, but both men and cattle are sometimes surprised by wild beasts, as well as robbers, in those vast deserts; the hot winds also, blowing over a long tract of burning sand, are equal almost to the heat of an oven, and destroy abundance of merchants and pilgrims. If it was not for devotion, and in expectation of very great gains, no man would undertake a jour∣ney in these deserts; great are the hazards and fa∣tigues they must of necessity undergo; but those that go to Mecca assure themselves of paradise if they die, and have uncommon honours paid them at home, if they survive. People crowd to be taken into the Eastern caravans; and the gold that is found in the South, make them no less eager to undertake that journey.</P>
<P>The natives have hardly any trading vessels, but are seldom without some corsairs. These, and Eu∣ropean merchant ships, bring them whatever they want from abroad; as linen and woollen cloth, stuffs, iron wrought and unwrought, arms, gun∣powder, lead, and the like: for which they take in return, copper, wax, hides, Morocco leather, wool (which is very fine) gums, soap, dates, al∣monds, and other fruits.</P>
<P>The coins of this empire are a fluce, a blan∣quil, and ducat. The fluce is a small copper coin, twenty whereof make a blanquil, of the value of two-pence sterling. The blanquil is of silver, and the ducat of gold, not unlike that of Hungary, and worth about nine shillings. Both these pieces are so liable to be clipped and filed by the Jews, that the Moors always carry scales in their pockets to weigh them; and when they are found to be much diminished in their weight, they are re∣coined by the Jews, who are masters of the mint,
<PB N="192" REF="1910"/>
by which they gain a considerable profit; as they do also by exchanging the light pieces for those that are full weight. Merchant's accompts are kept in ounces, ten of which make a ducat; but in payments to the government, it is said, they will reckon seventeen one-half for a ducat.</P>
<P>With respect to religion, the inhabitants of Mo∣rocco are Mohammedans, of the sect of Ali; and have a mufti, or high priest, who is also the su∣preme civil magistrate, and the last resort in all causes ecclesiastical and civil; and the rest of their clergy, who perform divine service in their mosques, are the only judges in their provinces and great towns, except in matters of state, and military af∣fairs, of which the great officers and governors take cognizance, and sometimes also controul the civil magistrate, imprisoning arbitrarily, and putting men to death without any trial or form of justice. They have a great veneration for their hermits, and for idiots and madmen; as well as for those, who by their tricks have got the reputation of wiz∣zards; all whom they look upon as inspired persons, and not only honour as saints, while they live, but build tombs and chapels over them when dead; which places are not only devoutly visited by their devotees far and near, but are esteemed inviolable sanctuaries for all sorts of criminals, except in cases of treason.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the natives are zealous Mo∣hammedans, they allow foreigners the free and open profession of their religion, and their very slaves have their priests and chapels in the capital city. Here, as in all other Mohammedan countries, the Alcoran and their comments upon it, are their only written laws; and tho' in some instances, their cadis, and other civil magistrates, are controuled by the arbitrary determinations of their princes, bashas, generals, and military officers, yet the lat∣ter
<PB N="193" REF="1920"/>
have generally a very great deference and regard for their laws. Murder, theft, and adultery, are commonly punished with death; and their punish∣ments for other crimes, particularly those against the state, are very cruel; as impaling, dragging the prisoner thro' the streets at a mule's heels, till all his flesh is torn off; throwing him from a high tower upon iron hooks; hanging him upon hooks till he dies; crucifying him against a wall; and, indeed, the punishment and condemnation of cri∣minals, is, in a manner, arbitrary. The emperor, or his bashas, frequently turn executioners; shoot the offender, or cut him to pieces with their own hands, or command others to do it in their presence.</P>
<P>The emperor exercises an uncontroulable power over the lives and fortunes of his subjects. The authority of the mufti, indeed, by their law, is said to be superior to his; and that if he was to be summoned before the latter, even by the meanest of his subjects, he must submit. But the danger of such an attempt, which would only bring death and destruction to the plaintiff, is of itself sufficient to deter them from it, were those pontiffs less the emperor's creatures, than they commonly are.</P>
<P>The public revenue here arises chiefly from the taxes upon all possessions of the subject, and from a poll-tax of a ducat and a half on every head, a twelfth of all the grain, a tenth of all the cattle and goods, besides many other duties, which are oc∣casional and arbitrary. To these we may add an annual tax of six crowns per head on all the male Jews, from the age of fifteen years and upwards; besides other imposts, which he lays on them at his will and pleasure. The Christians also are forced to pay dear for the liberty of trading in his dominions, over and above the duties upon goods imported or exported. The presents also, that are made him by Christian princes to obtain his friendship or alliance,
<PB N="194" REF="1930"/>
or redress for their trading subjects, make no in∣considerable part of his incomes. Add to all these the share he has in the prizes that are made, which is a fifth, if the prize was made by a private ves∣sel, and one half, if made by his ships of war, tho' the whole charge of the latter is defrayed by his alcaids or governors. All the slaves belong to him, only he allows fifty crowns a head for such as did not fall to his share. His whole revenue, or∣dinary and extraordinary, is computed at five hun∣dred quintals of silver, each worth three hundred and eighty five pounds sterling; if the revenue of a monarch can be computed, who is continually plun∣dering his subjects. As to his military forces, it is computed that the black cavalry and infantry, do not amount to less than forty thousand men, and the Moorish horse and foot may be as many. His naval force consists commonly of a few frigates and row-boats.</P>
<P>In regard to the character of the Moors, they are said to be a covetous unhospitable people, intent upon nothing but heaping up riches, to obtain which they will be guilty of the meanest things, and stick at no manner of fraud.</P>
<P>The Arabs also, who are almost as numerous as the Moors, have always had the character of a pil∣fering generation.</P>
<P>The people who inhabit the hills, and who have the least to do with the court and with traffic, are much the honestest people among them, and still retain a good share of liberty, the government using them rather as allies, than subjects, lest they should entirely disown their authority.</P>
<P>The Moors, however, with all their bad qua∣lities, are observed to be very dutiful to their pa∣rents, their princes, and superiors. A plurality of wives is allowed here, as in other Mahomme∣dan countries; nor do they confine themselves
<PB N="195" REF="1940"/>
to women, but keep boys, as they do in Turky. The woman who commits adultery is punished with death; but it is not difficult for them to ob∣tain a divorce, if ill used.</P>
<P>The dead are carried to the grave in their usual dress, the priests singing before them, <HI>La illa All illa, Mahomet Resoul Alla,</HI> i. e. God is a great God, and Mahomet his prophet.</P>
<P>The Moors, or natives of the country, are of much the same complexion as the Spaniards on the opposite shore; but such multitudes of negroes have been brought from Guinea, that you see almost as many black as whitepeople, especially about Me∣quinez, where the court resides. The habit of a Moor is a linen frock or shirt next his skin, a vest of silk or cloth tied with a sash, a pair of drawers, a loose coat, his arms bare to the elbow, as well as his legs, sandals or slippers on his feet, and some∣times people of condition wear buskins: they shave their heads, and wear a turban, which is ne∣ver pulled off before their superiors, or in their temples; they express their reverence both to God and man by pulling off their slippers, which they leave at the door of the mosque or palace, and, when they attend their prince in the city, they run bare foot after him, if the streets are ever so dirty. Their turbans are of fine silk, or fine linen. The habit of the women is not very diffe∣rent from that of the men, except that they wear a fine linen cloth or caul on their heads, instead of a turban, and their drawers are much larger and longer than the men's. The women also, when they go abroad, have a linen cloth over their faces, with holes in it for their eyes, like a mask.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Morocco lies on the most western verge of Barbary, and is bounded, on the north, by the kingdom of Fez, from which it is parted by the Ommirabih, or Marbea; on the south, by the
<PB N="196" REF="1950"/>
river Sus and Mount Atlas, which divide it also, on the east from Biledulgerid, and on the west, by the Atlantic ocean; its utmost extent, from north to south, being somewhat above three degrees, and from east to west about five. It is divided into seven provinces, viz. those of Morocco Proper, Hea, Sus, Dacala, Tedla, Hascora, and Gazula.</P>
<P>Morocco, which gives name to the kingdom, and is its capital, stands on a fertile and delightful plain, about six leagues from Mount Atlas, on the river Tansft or Goudet, and the ruins of the an∣tient Boccanum Homerum. It was formerly a very large and splendid city, but now above one∣third of it lies waste, and many of its noble mosques, baths, and other structures have been demolished by the wars, though there are still three of the former standing. The royal palace here is like a little town or fortress, inclosed with a high wall, and a large ditch, and flank∣ed with high towers, and other works. The common houses are mostly of mud, plaistered over, and flat at the top. The Jews live in a se∣parate quarter by themselves, which is walled in. About half a league from the palace is the royal bower, called Montsomac, where is a prodi∣gious number of lemon, olive, and other trees; and near the bower is a park, where elephants, lions, stags, and other creatures are kept for the diversion of the court.</P>
<P>The other towns worth mentioning are Tendest, Taradant, Messa, Aguer, Azamor, Mazagan, Al∣medina, and Tefza.</P>
<P>Tendest is the capital of the province of Hea, or Haha, and stands within land.</P>
<P>Taradant, the capital of the province of Sus, stands two miles south of Mount Atlas.</P>
<P>Messa stands near the mouth of the river Sus, at the foot of Mount Atlas.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="1960"/>
Aguer is situated in the same province, on the western side of the river, near the cape, to which it gives name.</P>
<P>Azamor, the capital of the province of Ducala, stands on the gulph, to which it gives name, at the mouth of the Ommirabih, or Amarbea.</P>
<P>Mazagan, which the Portuguese took possession of after their abandoning Saffi, and which they have been lately obliged to surrender to the Moors by capitulation, stands on the sea-coast, about six leagues east of Amazor. The walls are built after the modern manner, of stone and mortar. The sea incloses it on one side, and a deep ditch, without the walls, on the others; and a very deep well supplies it with sweet water.</P>
<P>Almedina is the capital of the inland province of Hascora or Escura. Its name signifies, The City, in the Arabic. There is another of the same name in the province of Ducala, between Azamor and Sallee.</P>
<P>Tefza, the capital of the province of Tedla, or Tedela, stands on the side of Mount Atlas, being rich and populous, and surrounded by a marble wall.</P>
<P>Five miles from the sea coast, near Cape Ozem, in the province of Hea, lies the island of Modo∣gar, supposed by some to be the Erythrea of the antients, where is a garrison of about two hundred men, to guard the gold and silver mines in the ad∣jacent mountains.</P>
<P>On the coast of Morocco are also the towns of Santa Cruz and Saffi; the one at the mouth of the river Suz, and the other at that of the river Gondet.</P>

<HEAD>The Kingdom of FEZ.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Fez is bounded by the Me∣diterranean on the north; by the Atlantic Ocean on the west; on the south by the river Ommirabih, or Marbea, which separates it from Morocco; and on the east by a line, drawn from the Mulva, or Mulvia, to the great Mount Atlas, which divides it on that side from the kingdom of Algiers. It made antiently the western part of Mauritania Tingitana, and is rather larger than Morocco, extending from east to west, about two hundred and seventy miles, where broadest, that is from from 1°. 20′. to 7°. west longitude; and is pretty near of the same extent from south to north, as ly∣ing between 18°. and 36°. of latitude. It is also much richer and more fertile than Morocco in all sorts of grain, fruit, cattle, wax, and would be still more so, if it was duly cultivated; but such is the indolence of the natives, who are contented with a bare sufficiency for themselves, and have no incli∣nation, but rather a dislike, to the sending any grain out of the kingdom, that a great part of its rich lands lie waste and neglected.</P>
<P>This kingdom is divided into the seven provinces of Fez Proper, Temesna, Asgar, Habat, Errif or El-Riffe, Garet or Alcaia, and Chaouz or Chaus. Some geographers make only one province of As∣gar and Habat, under the name of Algarbe.</P>
<P>The principal places in Fez Proper are Fez, the capital of the whole kingdom, Mequinez, and Sale, Sala, or Sallee.</P>
<P>Fez, supposed to be the antient Volubilis, stands on a river of the same name, in latitude 33°. 58′. and west longitude 4°. 25′. about twenty-eight leagues south from the Mediterranean, thirty-three east from the Atlantic Ocean, and near two hundred
<PB N="199" REF="1980"/>
and sixty north-east of Morocco. It is very large, be∣ing computed to contain three hundred thousand in∣habitants, and a great number of mosques, baths, caravanseras, palaces, seraglios, colleges, warehouses, magazines, and other magnificent structures. The streets swarm with men of all professions, and with merchants of all sorts; this place being esteemed the general magazine of Barbary, to which all sorts of goods are brought, and exchanged, and sent in∣to the other provinces to be exchanged for those of the country. The goods exported are leather of several sorts, particularly that called marroquin or morocco leather, the manufacture of the country; skins, hides, wool, ostrich feathers, copper, dates, al∣monds, figs, raisins, olives, wax, honey, horses, silks, of their own manufacture, a sort of cotton and flax cloth of the same, indigo, cochineal, variety of cali or pot-ash for soap, gold ducats, &amp;c. &amp;c. of all which the Jews, who are here above five thousand, are the chief brokers. The inns, excepting those where the Christians resort, are mere brothels, where the most wicked and unnatural crimes are perpetrated with impunity; the landlords entertaining in them a set of the most impudent catamites, who are even per∣mitted to go about the streets, and, by their effe∣minate voices and behaviour, to entice strangers to their beastly and abominable stews. The emperor has a palace here; but his chief residence is at Me∣quinez, situated about thirty miles west of Fez, on the river Subu or Sabour, and supposed to be the antient Gilda. It is surrounded by fine parks and olive-grounds, and contains much the same number of inhabitants as Fez. The royal palace stands higher than the city, and is about three miles in compass, surrounded with strong walls. This city is also the residence of the mufti, or high-priest, and there is a particular quarter for the Jews, who are very numerous, both in the city and province.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="1990"/>
Sallee, the antient Sala, is situated on the At∣lantic Ocean, at the mouth of a river, called Ba∣ragrag or Burregreg. The harbour here, though the best in the whole empire, and the rendezvous of the corsairs, or Sallee rovers, as they are called, is almost dry at low, and has not above twelve feet at high water, together with a very inconvenient bar. All the merchandizes imported pay a tenth of their value to the government; but the prin∣cipal wealth of the place arises from its piratical trade. The Sallee rovers, though but small ves∣sels, are crowded with men, and sometimes take valuable prizes. There are no merchant ships here, nor any where else in the empire belonging to the Moors, nor is any foreign trade carried on by them in their own bottoms. And indeed it seems a happiness, that all the Morocco dominions do not afford one tolerable harbour. Better ports might be an inducement to increase their naval force, and consequently to become a greater annoyance; but no flourishing fair trade could be expected under a government so despotic, oppressive, and rapa∣cious. The land is judged capable of producing a hundred times more than the inhabitants can consume, yielding three crops a year; yet, ex∣cept within about three leagues of a town, it has no proprietor. Those who have a little money are afraid to let it out upon interest, left they should be reputed wealthy, and consequently become a prey: for this reason they bury it, with any fur∣niture they have of value, nothing being seen in their houses but a mat or two to lie on, and a few ordinary things. The tyranny of the government is said to be the motive of the Arabs continuing a wandering life, lest, by living in fixed habitations, they should forfeit all property and liberty by the rapaciousness of the officers.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="2000"/>
The capital of the province of Tamesna is Ra∣bat, situated at the mouth of the Gueron, or Bur∣regreg, and supposed to be the Opidum of Pto∣lemy.</P>
<P>In the province of Asgar the principal places are Larache and Alcas-quiver.</P>
<P>The first, supposed to be the Lixus of Ptolemy, and the Lixa of Pliny, is situated on the Atlantic Ocean, at the mouth of a river of the same name, thirty-three leagues north west from Fez. It has a small harbour, and is strongly fortified, having been in the hands of the Spaniards for near one hundred years.</P>
<P>Alcas-quiver is situated also on the Atlantic, near the river Larache, and was once possessed by the Portuguese.</P>
<P>In the province of Habat the most remarkable places are Arzilla, Tangier, Ceuta, and Tetuan.</P>
<P>Arzilla, the antient Zilia or Zelis, was long held both by the Spaniards and Portuguese. It stands on the Atlantic, about eleven leagues from the mouth of the Straits of Gibraltar, and thirty-three north-west from Fez.</P>
<P>Tangier, formerly Tingis, from which the pro∣vince was stiled Tingitania, or Mauritania Tingi∣tana, stands on a bay not far from the strait of Gib∣raltar. In 1662, this town belonged to the Portu∣guese, at which time it was given to our king, Charles II. upon his marriage with the Infanta of Portugal; but he, growing weary of the charge of keeping it, caused it to be blown up and destroyed in 1684: ever since, it hath been only a poor fish∣ing town. Between Arzilla and Tangier lies Cape Spartel.</P>
<P>Ceuta, antiently Septa, Arx Septensis, or Exilissa, stands eastward of Tangier, near the straits mouth, and at the foot of a mountain, called by the antients Abyla or Abyle, and one of Hercules's Pillars, and now Ape's Hill. It is well fortified, hath a good
<PB N="202" REF="2010"/>
harbour, and is a bishop's see, suffragan to that of Lisbon. The Spaniards have been long in posses∣sion of it; but the Moors keep it constantly blocked up. Near it is the famed mountain with seven summits, the Septem Fratres of Mela, and the Heptadelphi of Ptolemy.</P>
<P>Seven leagues south of Ceuta, on the same coast, is the town of Tetuan or Tetegin, situated on the river Cus, about three miles from the sea, and in a spacious plain, abounding with orchards, gardens, walks, &amp;c. It contains about thirty thousand in∣habitants, of which five thousand are Jews, and is surrounded with a low mud wall, and a ditch, in many places filled up. The chief strength of the place consists in a garrison of fifteen hundred foot, and four hundred horse. It is said to be one of the handsomest and pleasantest towns in Barbary, com∣manding a fine prospect of the sea and neighbour∣ing country: the inhabitants also are said to be more courteous than in the other towns. The basha's palace here is very magnificent. On one of the adjacent eminences is a burying-ground, adorned with such a number of cupolas and pyra∣mids, that it looks like a city by itself.</P>
<P>The chief place in the province of Errif is Go∣mer, or Valez de la Gomera, which some suppose to be Ptolemy's Aira. It stands on the coast of the Mediterranean, over-against a small rocky island, called Pennon de Velez, where the Spa∣niards keep a garrison.</P>
<P>In the province of Garet the most considerable place is Melilla, situated on the Mediterranean, at the bottom of a bay called by mariners Entre-fol∣cos. Its antient name of Russadirum was changed into Melilla, from the great quantity of honey its territory affords. It is a considerable town, with an indifferent harbour. Near it is a large lake, which has a communication with the sea; and a
<PB N="203" REF="2020"/>
town, called Casasa, which stands on and gives name to a cape, antiently called Metagonitis, or Metagonium, hard by the river Mulucha.</P>
<P>The chief town of the inland province of Chaus, or Cuz, is Dubdu, situated on the declivity of a hill, twenty leagues south of Melilla.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of ALGIER.</HEAD>
<P>Algier, the next most powerful state on this coast, is bounded on the east by Tunis; on the west by the kingdom of Fez; on the north by the Mediterra∣nean; and on the south by the Desert of Biledulge∣rid; extending from west to east, or from the river Tivunt to the Guadalbarbar, or Zaine, above four hundred and fifty miles; and from about an hun∣dred and fifty miles to forty in breadth. It com∣prehends the antient Mauritania Caesariensis, with a part of Numidia Proper, called also formerly the Country of the Massyli, and Terra Metagonitis.</P>
<P>The air of this country is healthful and tem∣perate; neither too hot in summer, nor too sharp and cold in winter. The winds are ge∣nerally from the west-by-north to the east: those from the east are common at Algier, from May to September, at which time the wester∣ly winds take place, and become the most fre∣quent: the southerly winds, which are usually hot and violent, are not frequent at Algier; they blow sometimes for five or six days together, render∣ing the air so excessively suffocating, that, during their continuance, the inhabitants are obliged to sprinkle their floors with water. It is seldom known to rain in this climate, during the summer season; and in most parts of the Sahara, or Desert, on the south of Algier, they have no rain at all.</P>
<P>The sea-coast of great part of this country is mountainous and rocky; but the inner Mediter∣ranean
<PB N="204" REF="2030"/>
parts are diversified with a beautiful in∣terchange of hills and plains, which grow less capable of culture, in proportion as they ap∣proach the Sahara. In many places, for several leagues together, nothing is to be seen but a soli∣tary desert, in others, fruitful districts abounding in corn, fruit and pasture. These last enjoy a constant verdure; for in February the trees begin to bud, and in April they show their fruit in full growth, which are mostly ripe by May. The grapes are fit to gather in June, and the figs, peaches, nectarines, apricots, olives, nuts, &amp;c. in August. There is but one kind of wheat and barley cultivated in this country; in some districts, where they have a command of water during the summer season, the natives cultivate rice, Indian corn, and particularly a white sort of millet, which the Arabs call drah, and prefer to barley for the fattening of their cattle: oats are not cultivated at all by the Arabs, the horses of this country feeding altogether upon barley. The Moors and Arabs continue to tread out their corn, after the pri∣mitive custom in the East; after it is trodden out, they winnow it by throwing it up into the air with shovels, lodging it afterwards in matramores or sub∣terraneous magazines. Besides the fruit mentioned above, here are great numbers of palm, plum, cherry, mulberry, apple, pear, pomegranate, and olive trees, with prickle pears, and walnuts, but no filbert, gooseberry, or currant trees. Besides the horse, the mule, the ass, and the camel, used for riding and carrying burdens, Dr. Shaw men∣tions another animal, called the kumrah, a little serviceable beast of burden, begot betwixt an ass an a cow, being single hoofed like the ass, but having the tail and head, except the horns, like a cow, and a skin sleeker than that of an ass. Among
<PB N="205" REF="2040"/>
the wild beasts are the lion and the panther; the tyger is not a native of Barbary.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of Algier are the Wed el Ki∣beer, antiently called Ampsaga; the Wed el Dsahab, or river of gold; Wed el Hammam, twenty miles to the west of Constantina; Wed el Sigan, fifteen miles to the south west from Physgech; Sei-bouse, the Armua of Pliny; the Ma-fragg, Ptolemy's Rubricatus, falling into the sea, four miles east of Sei-bouse; the Zaine, which bounds this kingdom to the east; the Mansoureah, antiently called Sesaris; the river of Boujeiah, antiently Nissava, Esser, an∣tiently Serbetis, a large river, the western branch of which is called Shurffa, and the eastern Wed el Zeitoune, i. e. the river of Olives, from the vast quantity of that fruit produced in the adjacent territory; the Hameese, supposed to be the antient Savus; the Wed el Meilah, the Flumen Salsum of the antients; the Major, Tafna and Shelliff.</P>
<P>The principal mountains are those branches of Mount Atlas on the south, extending from east to west, Jibbel Auress, or Evress, the Mons Audus of Ptolemy, and Mons Aurasius of the middle age; that called Thambes, extending itself as far as Tabraka; the Wannashreese, containing mines of lead; the mountains of Trara, and El Callah, and others of less note.</P>
<P>The principal capes or promontories are those called by the Moors Ashoune Monker, Nackos, Ras Hunneine, or Mellack, Sebba Rous, or Seven Capes, Ras el Hamrah, or the Red Cape, Cape Mobra, the antient Hippi promontorium. Ashoune∣maunker is supposed to be the Vabar of Pto∣lemy; the Nackos, or Cape Tennes, the Pro∣montorium Apollinis, and Ras Hunneine, or Mel∣lack, or Cape Hone, the Promontorium Magnum. Add to these Cape Fegula, Cape Falcon, Cape
<PB N="206" REF="2050"/>
Ivy, Cape Cambron, Cape Bugia, and Cape Metafaz.</P>
<P>The principal curiosities in this kingdom are, a bridge of Roman workmanship, over the river Booemah; the rich lead mines in the mountains Beni Boo-Taleb; the lukewarm springs bubbling up within a large square basin, sixteen leagues to the east of Constantina, supposed to be the Aquae Calidae, or Aquae Tibelitanae of the antients; the ruins of a Roman city, called at present Casser, to the northward of the mountain, named Jibbel Afroone; the rivulet of salt water, which glides through the valley Dammer Cappy, i. e. Iron Gate; the large salt-pits five miles to the southwards of Arzew; the Jibbel Miness, an entire mountain of salt; the Hammam, or Bath of Merega, antiently Aquae Calidae, Colonia, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The chief bays are those of Marsilquiver, Oran, Algier, and Bugia.</P>
<P>As to the government of Algiers, it is in reality an absolute monarchy; for though the dey some∣times assembles a divan, consisting of the chief officers of the state, and of the Janissaries, and de∣mands their advice in matters of importance, yet he acts by his sole authority, whenever he pleases: yet he is elective, his son never inheriting by de∣scent, and the election is by the army. Those who have no relation to the army are excluded from any share in the election. There are frequently several candidates named upon a vacancy, and when they have fixed upon one, they all cry out Alla barick, God prosper you, and shower down his blessings upon you; and whether the person is willing to accept the honour or not, he is imme∣diately invested with the caftan, or robe of sove∣reignty; then the cadi is called, who declares, that God has vouchsafed to call him to the govern∣ment
<PB N="207" REF="2060"/>
of that kingdom; and that he is to main∣tain his subjects in their liberties and properties, exhorting him to employ his utmost care for the prosperity of his country, and duly to administer justice and it is said he actually sits adminis∣tering justice from five in the morning till noon, and from one till four; hearing and determining all causes, that are brought before him, without any associates or assistants, but four secretaries. His judgements are arbitrary, except in cases re∣gulated by the Coran, and there lies no appeal from his tribunal; but as the military men not only elect, but depose, or put him to death, when∣ever they apprehend he does not consult their in∣terest, he is obliged to be very cautious in every decree he makes. The want of success also, in any instance, seldom fails to occasion a rebellion; and then it is well if the dey is not sacrificed to the fury of the soldiery, and another elected, in whose hands they may hope their affairs will prosper better.</P>
<P>The whole force of Algiers consists in about six thousand Turks and Cologlies, who are employed either in garisoning towns, in manning their cruisers, or forming three flying camps, that are sent out every summer under the command of the provin∣cial viceroys. To the Turkish troops we may join two thousand Moorish horse and foot, yet these, though kept in constant pay, being hereditary ene∣mies to the Turks, are not much depended on. The method therefore that is used to keep this large and populous kingdom in obedience, is chiefly by fomenting the disputes and divisions, that always subsist among the Arabian tribes and princes; for were the Arabs to lay aside their quarrels, and act in concert, they would soon be able to rid themselves of the Turks.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="2070"/>
These Arabs live here under tents, as they do almost every where else. None of them follow any regular trade or employment; but their whole life is one continued round of idleness and diver∣sion; when no pastime calls them abroad, they do nothing all the day but loiter at home, smoke their pipe, or repose themselves under some neighbour∣ing shade. They have no relish at all for domes∣tic pleasures, and are rarely known to converse with their wives, or play with their children; what they value above every thing, and place their highest sa∣tisfaction in, is riding and managing their horses. The Arab women make the cloathing and furniture for their family, particularly their Hykes, or woollen blankets, and the webs of goats hair for their tents.</P>
<P>The greatest part of the Moorish women would be reckoned beauties even in Britain; their chil∣dren certainly have the finest complexions of any nation whatsoever. The boys indeed, by wearing only the tiara, are exposed so much to the sun, that they quickly attain the swarthiness of Arabs, but the girls keeping more at home, preserve their beauty till they are thirty, at which age they are usually past child bearing. It sometimes happens, that one of these girls is a mother at eleven, and a grand-mother at two and twenty.</P>
<P>The Algerines are great pirates, and reckoned the most formidable of all Africa. They are ex∣tremely avaricious and cruel to those that fall into their hands, especially to the Christians.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Algier is divided into eighteen provinces, but there are but few towns in it of any note even along the sea-coast, except the ca∣pital, which gives name to it, and is supposed to be the antient Icosium. The Arabs, who have abolished all the Roman names, call it Al Gezir, or the Island, on account of a small one that lies opposite to its mole, and that hath been corrupted
<PB N="209" REF="2080"/>
into Algier. It stands on the declivity of a hill, so that the houses rise one above another, by which means they have a full view of the sea. The walls are twelve feet thick, flanked with towers and bastions, and surrounded with a wide ditch. The houses are built in a very different manner from those in Europe, and are only one story high; they have no gardens behind, but only on the tops, which are covered with earth; nor have they any chimnies, the fires being made in large earthen pots, placed near the door to let out the smoke.</P>
<P>Of all the buildings of the city the dey's palace, which stands in the heart of it, is the largest and noblest. Here are also about sixty public baths, some of them finely paved with marble; upwards of a hundred mosques, mostly situated along the sea-side; plenty of taverns and cooks shops, kept generally by Christian slaves; a great num∣ber of public fountains, and magnificent tombs. The mole or harbour, and the small island lying opposite to it, are defended by several forts, one of which called the imperial castle, commands the whole city and harbour. The great men let their beards grow; but the rest shave both head and face, leaving only a pair of whiskers, and a lock on the head, by which they fancy they will be drawn up to Paradise. We are told there are above eighteen thousand gardens about the city, with summer houses, and other accommodations, and plenty of all sorts of fruit. The Christian slaves are very numerous, not only in this city, but all over the kingdom, the corsairs continually bringing fresh supplies of them. The country seats in the neigh∣bourhood are little white houses, shaded by a va∣riety of fruit trees, and ever-greens, and well sup∣plied with water from many rivulets and fountains. According to Dr. Shaw, the town, when he was there, contained about two thousand Christian slaves,
<PB N="210" REF="2090"/>
fifteen thousand Jews, and a hundred thousand Mo∣hammedans, with a few renegadoes.</P>
<P>The greatest commerce of the Algerines con∣sists in the merchandize which they obtain by pyratical plunder of the Christians over the whole Mediterranean, and part of the ocean. Above two thousand shops are kept in the two Bazars by foreigners. The marine here is so strong, that they fit out every year upwards of twenty vessels, hav∣ing three or four hundred men each on board.</P>
<P>Of the other towns the chief are Constantina, antiently Cirta, standing about thirty leagues from the Mediterranean; Gigeri, situate on the sea∣coast, about forty leagues east of Algiers; Bugia, the antient Saldae, standing on the same coast, be∣tween Gigeri and Algier, and giving name to a bay; Tenez, the capital of a province, about two miles from the sea, between Oran and Algier; Sargel, about fifteen miles from the sea, between Tenez and Algier; Mostagan, on the sea-coast, at the mouth of the river Shelif, twenty miles east of Oran; Mazagran, a strong town with a large con∣venient port, not far from Oran; Mazalquiver, a small town, supposed to be the Portus Magnus of Ptolemy, having a very spacious haven situate some miles west of Oran, and belonging to the Portu∣guese; Oran, a strong town, supposed by some to be the Colonia Unica of the Romans, standing a hun∣dred and fifty miles west of Algier; Tremecen, an∣tiently Timisii, a large and well fortified town not far from the sea; Sgigata, or Stora, the Rusicada of Ptolemy, at the eastern extremity of the gulph, to which it gives name; Tagoeite, a small port, the antient Sulluco, or Collops Parvus of Ptolemy; Bona, called by the Moors Blaid el Aneb, or Town of Jujebs, from the plenty of them gathered in the neighbourhood, standing on a gulph, called antiently the gulph of Hippo, from the city of

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of TUNIS.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, a part of the once celebrated republic of Carthage or Africa Propria, is bound∣ed on the east by Tripoli; on the west by the river Guadilbarbar, which parts it from Algier; on the south by Biledulgerid, properly so called; and on the north by the Mediterranean, extending from east to west almost sixty leagues, and from south to north about a hundred and five.</P>
<P>The soil is barren and sandy, except towards the west, where it is pretty fertile, being watered by several rivers, as the Guadilbarbar, the Me∣jerdah, antiently Bagadras, or Baragada, the Ha∣meese, the Myski-anah, the Miliana, antiently Catada, and the Gabbs, antiently Triton.</P>
<P>Besides some smaller ones, here is a large lake, called Shibkah el Lowdeah, or the lake of Marks, from a number of trunks of palm trees that are placed at proper distances, to direct the caravans. This lake extends itself near twenty leagues from east to west, and is interspersed with several dry spots, or islands: one of these, though uninhabited, is of a considerable extent, and well stocked with date-trees.</P>
<P>Some of the vallies of Tunis are very fruitful, pro∣ducing corn, oil, and grapes; and no country is more proper for the culture of silk, as abounding in mul∣berry
<PB N="212" REF="2110"/>
trees. Among their animals they have a pro∣digious number of camels, and fine horses.</P>
<P>The mountains are some branches of Atlas, that run through a great part of it.</P>
<P>The principal bays are those of the antient Car∣thage, the bay of Tunis, and the gulphs of Sidra and Guletta; and the capes those of Biserta, Car∣thage, Bona, Mezurat, and Rozatim, Cape Blanco, and Cape Zibeeb.</P>
<P>Among the principal curiosities and antiquities are to be ranked the Hammam Leef, a noted bath, very much resorted to by the citizens of Tunis; the hot bath, with some ruins, at the Creek of Gurbos, the Aquae Calidae of Livy; the Salt Lake near Tobulba, the Stagnum Salinarum of Hirtius; the Jibbel Had-diffa, an entire mountain of Salt, situated near the eastern extremity of the lake of Marks, whose salt is as hard and as solid as stone, and of a reddish or purple colour; the lead ores at Jibbel Ris-sass, near Hammam Leef; the ruins of Carthage, and other antient cities. Among those of Carthage, there still remain some of the spacious cisterns or reservoirs of water, which was brought out of the country, about thirty miles, by arched aqueducts, part of which are still remain∣ing, being thirty-five feet high. The city stood on a peninsula, and on an elevated situation, and there∣fore was very easily fortified; but there is no fresh water near it, which was the reason that they were obliged to fetch it at so great a distance. About fifty miles also to the south of Tunis, there is still remaining a Roman amphitheatre, whereof four parts in five are yet entire; it is of an oval figure, three stories high, and would contain thirty thousand spectators. In this kingdom lies part of those sandy tracts, called antiently the greater and the lesser Syrtis.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="2120"/>
As to manufactures, there were scarce any here formerly, the inhabitants supplying themselves in a great measure with what they wanted by their pira∣cies, but now they apply themselves much more to trade. The Europeans, who are at peace with them, export from hence corn, oil, wool, soap, dates, ostrich feathers, and skins; but the natives, till of late, got more by the labour or ransom of the slaves they took, than by any other article.</P>
<P>The religion, customs, and government are much the same as in Algier, only here the grand signior has a basha, who is some check upon the dey, and has a small tribute paid him. The dey is chosen by the divan.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Tunis is divided into the summer and winter circuits, containing eight provinces, five of which are maritime, and three inland, be∣sides some small islands in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>The capital, which gives name to the whole king∣dom, stands, or at least the greatest part of it, on a rising ground, on the western banks of a lake which goes by the same name, near the mouth of the Miliana, and in full prospect of the gulph of Guletta, and the island of Zowa-more. Tunis, some time since was noted for its corsairs, but of late the inhabitants have applied themselves more to trade, and are now become the most ci∣vilized and polite people of Barbary. It is com∣puted to contain ten thousand families, and three thousand shops, where they sell linen and woollen cloth. The Europeans who drive the greatest trade hither are the Venetians and Genoese. A great part of the inhabitants, both within and without the city, are employed in the manufacture of linen, which is the finest in all Africa; those turbans, called tunicis, so highly esteemed by the Turks and Moors, being made of it. The bagnios here are very commodious and elegant. Dr. Shaw

tells us, that there are no less than fifteen thousand licensed harlots in the city, exclusive of their concu∣bines. The ruins of Carthage lie about fifteen miles to the north west. The French consul's house here is lofty, spacious, richly furnished, and of modern ar∣chitecture. The magazines, warehouses, and dwell∣ings of the Christian merchants, are in a suburb towards the sea. The territory about the city is well cultivated, and produces great variety of fruit, as lemons, oranges, pomegranates, olives, &amp;c. and wheat; but the last is very dear, and eaten only by the rich. There is a kind of herb, called harix, which if eaten to the quantity of a bare ounce, will exhilerate a man a whole day, and therefore comes dear. A sort of mad, or rather rascally fel∣lows here, who go about the street bare headed, and without shoes or stockings, are held in great vene∣ration by the Mohammedans. The women are handsome, and those of fashion go richly dressed and adorned, but with their faces veiled. As they have no windows in the fronts of their houses, an European, when in the streets, is apt to fancy, that he is walking between two dead walls.</P>
<P>The lake or bay of Tunis, reckoned one of the most commodious in the Mediterranean, is joined to that of Guletta, by a narrow passage, which, with two castles that command it, makes it also very safe.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of TRIPOLI.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, containing the antient Regio-Syrtica, with a part of Cyrenaica, is bounded on the north by the Mediterranean; on the east by Barca; on the south by Sahara, or the Great Desert; and on the west partly by Tunis, and partly by Biledulgerid. It extends upwards of a thousand miles along the coast.</P>
<P>The climate, the people, their government, reli∣gion, and customs, are much the same here as in Tunis; for here is a dey or bey, who is a kind of doge or chief, as well as general of the whole na∣tion, under the protection of the Grand Seignior, whose basha collects an annual tribute, but has no∣thing to do in appointing the dey, who is chosen by the Turkish soldiers, and deposed by them, whenever they do not approve his administration. These Turkish soldiers, who govern this extensive country, are not more than three or four thousand, though they have a great many hundred thousand Moors and Arabs under their jurisdiction.</P>
<P>As to the soil, this country is one of the richest in Barbary; the vallies, where cultivated, producing corn, grapes, olives, dates, silk, and all manner of fruits and plants proper to a warm climate.</P>
<P>Some branches of Mount Atlas extend to this country; but we hear of no rivers of any note, ex∣cept that called Capes, which rises in the sandy de∣sert to the south, and, after dividing this kingdom from that of Tunis, falls into the Mediterranean. In this kingdom lie most of those parts of the coast antiently called the Greater and Lesser Syrtis.</P>
<P>The Turks of Tripoli, like those of Algiers and Tunis, are an abandoned race, consisting of pirates, banditti, and the very refuse of Turkey, who have
<PB N="217" REF="2160"/>
been forced to leave their country to avoid the pu∣nishment of their crimes; and do not differ in any respect from those of Algiers and Tunis, only they are not so powerful as the Algerines.</P>
<P>Tunis is divided into four principal provinces or districts, namely, those of Tripoli, properly so call∣ed, Essab, Messellata, and Mezerata, in each of which are some large, trading, and populous cities, especially on the coast, where, besides several manu∣factures, the inhabitants carry on the piratical bu∣siness to great advantage to themselves, though to the great hazard and loss of most of the European nations trading to the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>Tripoli, the metropolis of the whole, stiled Tri∣poli of Barbary, to distinguish it from another in Asia Minor, stands on the sea, where it opens itself in form of a crescent, in a sandy barren ground. It is inclosed with good walls, and, though not large, is very populous; but the streets are narrow and irregular, and the houses low, dark, and mean, flat on the top, and receive most of their light from the door. The Franciscan friars have a handsome church and convent here, and a good hospital, which is very necessary in a place where the plague rages so frequently and furiously. The town is surrounded with fine pleasure houses, gardens, or∣chards, &amp;c. all cultivated by poor Christian slaves, to whom they hardly allow a sufficient quantity of bread and water to support life.</P>
<P>The principal of the antient cities in this country were, Cyrene, the metropolis, Arsinoe or Teuchira, Berenice, Ptolemais or Barce, and Apollonia, from whence the best part of it was named Pentapolis. Cyrene stood at some distance from the Mediterra∣nean; but the rest along the coast.</P>
<P>Under the government or bashaship of Tripoli is the kingdom or country of Barca, containing the antient Marmarica, with a part of Cyrenaica. It
<PB N="218" REF="2170"/>
is bounded on the east by Egypt; on the south by part of Biledulgerid; on the west by Tripoli; and on the north by the Mediterranean; extending from Cape Roxaltin on the west, to Alexandria on the east, that is, about an hundred and sixty miles; and upwards of two hundred from north to south; but is little else but a vast, wild, and sandy desert, scarce a town, or cultivated spot of ground, being to be found in it. It was antiently famed for the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and contains those places called antiently the Greater and Lesser Ca∣labathmos.</P>
<P>We shall here add a few reflections, extracted from different authors, in relation to these pirati∣cal states.</P>
<P>The Mohammedans, wherever they are esta∣blished, especially those of them who partake of the genius and disposition of the Turks, have very little inclination to the arts of industry. This evidently appears in the inhabitants of those parts we have been describing on the African coast. Being a ra∣pacious and tyrannical people, hating and disdain∣ing all industry and labour, and neglecting all cul∣ture and improvement, they naturally and necessa∣rily became thieves and robbers; and, when they were no longer able to plunder and destroy the fruitful plains of Valentia, Granada, and Andalu∣sia, they fell to roving upon the sea. They built ships, or rather took them from others, and ra∣vaged the neighbouring coasts, landing in the nights, surprizing, and carrying away the poor country people into slavery. This was their first occupation, and this naturally made pirates of them; for, not content with mere landing and plundering the coasts of Spain, by degrees, being grown powerful and rich, and made bold and audacious by their success, they armed their ships, and began
<PB N="219" REF="2180"/>
to attack, first the Spaniards upon the high seas, and then all the Christian nations of Europe, wherever they could find them. Thus this detest∣able practice of roving and robbing began. What mischief hath been brought upon the trading part of the world by these nests of pirates, how power∣ful they are grown, how the most powerful Chris∣tian maritime powers are obliged meanly to make their court to them, and purchase a liberty to trade unmolested, by frequent presents of great value, is well known to all.</P>
<P>Would the maritime powers unite, and join their fleets and forces, to deliver themselves from the insolence of these rovers, to secure their coasts from insults and descents, their ships from cap∣ture, and the persons and goods of their subjects from slavery, violence, and rapine, they could hard∣ly fail of success; and were the sea-coast towns to be distributed among the united powers, accord∣ing to the share they had in the conquest, and to be peopled with colonies of industrious Christians, the good effects would be soon and sensibly felt; for, if the commodities and productions of these coun∣tries are so considerable, while under the govern∣ment of the most indolent and barbarous people in the world, how may we suppose they would be mul∣tiplied and improved by the application and indus∣try of the Europeans. It may also reasonably be supposed, that the Moors being driven up into the country, (for we do not propose the extirpating them, but only the putting it out of their power to annoy trade, by removing them from the sea-coast) and being obliged to seek their subsistence by ho∣nest labour, would greatly add to these products; and that from the numbers that would be induced by the advantages of the country, to go over and settle in it, a large consumption would arise, and every new settlement would be a new market for
<PB N="220" REF="2190"/>
the sale of those manufactures which had little or no vent there before. As these and many other ad∣vantages would attend such an enterprize, besides de∣livering Europe from the depredations of power∣ful thieves, and its commerce and navigation from the rapine of a merciless crew, who are the ruin of thousands of families, and, in some sense, the re∣proach of Christendom, it cannot be thought un∣worthy of the princes and powers of Europe; and it is to be hoped, for the honour of the Christian name, will some time or other be undertaken, and carried effectually into execution.</P>

<HEAD>The AFRICAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>OF the African Islands, some lie in the East∣ern or Indian Ocean, and some in the Western or Atlantic. We shall begin with those in the In∣dian Ocean, the chief of which are Zocotora, Bab-el-mandel, Madagascar, the Comorra Islands, Bourbon, and Mauritius.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ZOCOTORA.</HEAD>
<P>This island, by some believed to be the Diosco∣rides of Pliny and Ptolemy, is situated in east longtiude 53°. north latitude 12°. thirty-four leagues east of Cape Gardefoi, on the continent of Africa, and sixteen from the continent of Arabia. It is about eighty miles long, and fifty-four broad, and has two very good harbours, where ships used formerly to put in sometimes, when they lost their passage to India. It is a populous plentiful coun∣try,
<PB N="221" REF="2200"/>
yielding most of the fruits and plants that are usually found within the tropics, together with frank∣incense, gum-tragacanth, and aloes; and is under the government of a prince or sultan, who was for∣merly tributary to the xerifs of Arabia, and now pro∣bably to the Porte. The inhabitants are Moham∣medans, and of Arab extraction. They trade to Goa, whither they carry aloes, frankincense, amber∣grease, cive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, dragon's blood, rice, dates, and co∣ral, which are transported from thence over many parts of India, and to all the kingdoms in Europe. The climate is exceeding hot, yet there are some lofty mountains in the island, whose tops are always covered with snow.</P>
<P>Two very unnatural customs prevail among the inhabitants; for parents generally give away their own children, and adopt those of others in their stead; and the sick are often buried, or otherwise dispatched, before they have breathed their last: the last, indeed, is not unfrequently the request of the dying person. Though they are Mohamme∣dans, yet they worship the sun and moon, the lat∣ter especially, when at the full and new. They are said to be deceitful, lazy, and cowardly; but inge∣nious, particularly in the camboline manufacture, which is a beautiful stuff, formed out of such coarse materials as goats hair.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BAB-EL-MANDEL.</HEAD>
<P>Bab-el-mandel, or the Port of Affliction, former∣ly called the island of Diodorus, is situated at the entrance into the Red Sea, under 12°. 50′. north latitude, about four miles both from the Arabian and Abyssinian shores. It is about five miles in circumference, and important on no other account than its situation, as it produces neither fruits, roots, grain, or herbage.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="2210"/>
The small islands of Suachin and Barbora lie not far from it; of which the former is barren, but the latter yields excellent pasturage, and abounds in cattle.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MADAGASCAR.</HEAD>
<P>This island, the largest in the world, called by the natives Madecasi, or, according to Thevet, Albargro, by the Persians and Arabians Sarandib, and by the Portuguese Ilha de San Leoranzo, or Island of St. Laurence, extends in length, from north-north-east to south-south-west, near a thou∣sand miles; and about three hundred where broad∣est; being situated between 43 and 51°. of east longitude, and between 12 and 26°. of south la∣titude, three hundred miles south-east of the con∣tinent of Africa.</P>
<P>The whole coast is divided by rivers; and there are many bays and gulphs, with good roads and har∣bours. It abounds in corn, cattle, fowls, and all manner of animals and vegetables foundon the con∣tinent of Africa; and affords an agreeable variety of hills, valleys, woods, and champaign. Great quan∣tities of iron and steel are found throughout this island, which their artificers forge and purify with less difficulty and labour than Europeans. Their method is this: they reduce the ore, as brought from the mines, into powder, place it upon burning coals between four stones, which are clayed round for the purpose, and, by continual blowing underneath, with bellows made in the shape of gun-barrels or water pumps, the ore runs in less than an hour; whence the metal being afterwards extracted, by great heat, is formed into bars of three or four pounds weight. It is confidently affirmed, that the island has also mines of gold and silver, and of a white metal, much like British tin. The rivers and
<PB N="223" REF="2220"/>
brooks are rich in various kinds of precious stones, in crystals, topazes, granates, amethysts, eagle-stones, emeralds, sapphires, hyacinths, jaspers, and blood∣stones, called by the natives rhahamanga, and by physicians haematites, cornelians, and touch-stones.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are of different complexions and religions; some white, some negroes, some Moham∣medans, some Pagans. The whites, and those of a tawny complexion, who inhabit the coasts, are descended from the Arabs, as is evident from their language and their religious rites; but here are no mosques, temples, nor any stated worship, except that they offer sacrifices of beasts on particular oc∣casions; as when sick, when they plant yams or rice, when they hold their assemblies, circumcise their children, declare war, enter into new-built houses, and bury their dead. The country is di∣vided among a great many petty princes, who are continually at war with one another, as upon the continent; selling their prisoners or slaves to the shipping which touch there, and taking cloath∣ing, utensils, and other necessaries, in return. The French had once some settlements upon the island; but, at present, neither they nor any other Euro∣pean nation have any, though, it is thought, the French will attempt to establish themselves here a∣gain, if the other maritime powers do not interfere.</P>

<HEAD>The COMORRA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands are situated between 41 and 46°. of east longitude, and between 10 and 14°. of south latitude, at an equal distance from Mada∣gascar and the continent of Africa.</P>
<P>Joanna, the chief, is about thirty miles long, and fifteen broad, and affords plenty of provisions, and such fruits as are produced between the tro∣pics. East-India ships, bound to Bombay, usually touch here for refreshment. The inhabitants are
<PB N="224" REF="2230"/>
negroes of the Mohammedan religion, and enter∣tain our seamen with great humanity and hospi∣tality.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ISLE of BOURBON.</HEAD>
<P>The Isle of Bourbon, called also Mascarin, Mas∣carenhas, St. Apollonion, stands about three hun∣dred and seventy miles east of Madagascar, under 21°. 30′. south latitude. Its form is oval, thir∣teen leagues in length from east to west, and ten in breadth from south to north. There are many good roads for shipping round Bourbon, particu∣larly on the north and south sides; but hardly a single harbour where the ships can ride secure a∣gainst those hurricanes which blow during the mon∣soons. Indeed, the coast is so surrounded with blind rocks, sunk a few feet below the water, that coasting along-shore is at all times dangerous. On the southern extremity is a volcano, which conti∣nually throws out flames, smoke, and sulphur, with a hideous roaring noise, terrible in the night to mariners.</P>
<P>The climate here, though extremely hot, is healthy, being refreshed with cooling gales, that blow morning and evening, from the sea and land: sometimes, however, terrible hurricanes shake the whole island, almost to its foundation; but generally without any other bad consequence than frighten∣ing the inhabitants. The island abounds in brooks and springs, and in fruit, grass, and cattle, with ex∣cellent tobacco, (which the French have planted there) aloes, white pepper, ebony, palm, and other kinds of wood, and fruit-trees. Many of the trees yield odoriferous gums and resins; among the rest, benzoin of an excellent kind, and in great abundance. The rivers are well stocked with fish, the coast with land and sea tortoises, and every part of the country with horned cattle, as well as hogs
<PB N="225" REF="2240"/>
and goats. The hogs live much on turtle, which, it is said, give an extraordinary flavour, richness, and delicacy to their flesh. Ambergrease, coral, and the most beautiful shells, are found upon the shore. The woods are full of turtle-doves, paro∣quets, pigeons, and a great variety of other birds, equally beautiful to the eye, and pleasant to the pa∣late.</P>
<P>The French first settled here in the year 1672, after they had quitted the island of Madagascar. They have now some considerable towns in the island with a governor; and here their East-India ships touch, and take in refreshments.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MAURICE ISLAND, or MAURITIUS.</HEAD>
<P>This island was so called by the Dutch, who first touched here in 1598, in honour of the prince of Orange. It stands in 21°. south latitude, and is of an oval form, about an hundred and fifty leagues in circumference, with a fine harbour, capable of holding fifty large ships, secure against any wind that blows, and an hundred fathoms deep at the en∣trance.</P>
<P>The climate is extremely healthy and plea∣sant. The mountains, of which there are many, and some so high, that their tops are covered with snow, produce the best ebony in the world, besides various other kinds of wood of value, two of which greatly resemble ebony in quality; one red, the other yellow as wax. The woods abound with such numbers of birds, and so tame, that they may be taken by one's hand. The island is watered with several pleasant rivers, well stocked with fish; and though the soil is none of the most fruit∣ful, yields plenty of tobacco, rice, fruit, and
<PB N="226" REF="2250"/>
seeds, a great number of cattle, deer, goats, and sheep. It was formerly subject to the Dutch; but is now possessed by the French.</P>
<P>There are a great many more small islands about Madagascar, and on the eastern coast of Africa; but not worth mentioning.</P>
<P>The chief of the African islands in the Western or Atlantic Ocean, are those of St. Helena, As∣cension, St. Matthew, St. Thomas, Anaboa, Prince's Island, Fernando Po, Cape Verd, Cana∣ry, and Madeira Islands.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SAINT HELENA.</HEAD>
<P>St. Helena, or St. Helen's Island, is said to have been first discovered by the Portuguese, on the fes∣tival of the empress Helena, mother of the em∣peror Constantine the Great; for which reason, they called it by her name, which it still bears. It is situated in west longitude 6°. 30′. and in 16°. south latitude, one thousand two hundred miles west of the continent of Africa, and one thousand eight hundred east of that of South-America.</P>
<P>It is a rock in the middle of the ocean, very high and steep, about twenty miles in circumfe∣rence, and only accessible at the landing-place, which is defended by batteries of guns. The land∣ing place is a small bay, like a half-moon, scarce five hundred paces wide, between the two points. The English plantations here afford potatoes and yams, with plantains, bananas, grapes, kidney-beans, and Indian corn: of the last, however, most part is de∣stroyed by the rats, with which the island is pester∣ed; so that the flour they use is almost wholly im∣ported from England, and, in a scarcity, they gene∣rally eat yams and potatoes, instead of bread.
<PB N="227" REF="2260"/>
They have great plenty of hogs, bullocks, poul∣try, ducks, geese, and turkeys, with which they supply the sailors, taking, in exchange, shirts, drawers, or any light cloaths, pieces of callico, silks, muslins, arrack, sugar, &amp;c. The air is serene and temperate, and the complexions of the natives as fair and fresh as in England. The East-India com∣pany are proprietors of the island, which was given them by king Charles II. soon after it was taken from the Dutch by admiral Monday, in 1672. There are about two hundred families upon it. The East-India ships take in water and fresh provi∣sions here, in their way home; but the island is so small, and the wind so much against them outward∣bound, that they very seldom see it then; and if a ship overshoots the island, and falls to leeward, it is very difficult to recover it.</P>
<P>The company's affairs here are managed by a governor, deputy-governor, and store-keeper, who have standing salaries allowed by the company, be∣sides a public table, well furnished, to which all commanders, masters of ships, and eminent pas∣sengers are welcome. The company allow also a minister here an hundred pounds a-year, besides the gratuities he receives from the inhabitants. All things are dear to strangers, except roots and lemons. Their chief grain is kidney-beans, from eight to twelve shillings a bushel. A small ox is sold for six pounds, and turkeys for a dollar a-piece. The company allows the soldiers salt meat: both they and the mechanics may earn a great deal of money by their labour. The inhabitants are supplied with flour, and some other articles, twice a month, out of the company's store, at six months credit.</P>

<HEAD>The ISLAND of ASCENSION.</HEAD>
<P>This island is situated under the 7°. of south la∣titude, 17°. west from London, and six hundred miles north-west of St. Helena. It is a mountain∣ous barren island, about twenty miles round, and uninhabited; but has a safe convenient harbour, where the East-India ships generally touch to fur∣nish themselves with turtle, which are very plentiful here, and vastly large, some of them weighing above an hundred pounds a-piece.</P>

<HEAD>The ISLAND of SAINT THOMAS.</HEAD>
<P>This island is situated under the equator, in 8°. east longitude. The air is said to be unwhole∣some, but the soil very fruitful; yielding wheat, wine, millet, rye, barley, melons, cucumbers, figs, ginger, red parsnips, cabbages, French turnips, lettuce, radishes, sage, beet, parsley, &amp;c. There is a mountain in the centre of the island, whose top is almost constantly covered with a cloud, which moistens the trees, and makes them drop water enough for the sugar-canes; and it is observed, the higher the sun ascends above the horizon, the more moisture comes from the cloud. It is about an hundred and eighty miles in circumference, and has a harbour towards the continent, with a small town, named Pavoasan.</P>

<HEAD>ANABOA,</HEAD>
<P>Is a small island, situate near the coast of Loanga, in east longitude 9°, and north latitude 1°.

Here are also lemons, ci∣trons, nuts, figs, Turkish corn, and millet, with oxen, cows, hogs, goats, pidgeons, poultry, and plenty of fish. The island yields also a vast deal of cotton.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CAPE VERD ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands are so called from a cape of that name on the African coast, over against which they lie, at the distance of three hundred miles, be∣tween 13°. 50′, and 17°. 50′. north latitude, and between the twenty-second and twenty-fifth degree
<PB N="230" REF="2290"/>
of longitude west from London. Many of them are only barren rocks. St. Jago, Bravo, Fago, Mayo, Banavista, Sal, St. Nicholas, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Santa Cruz, and St. Antonio, are the most considerable: they are subject to the Portuguese. The air, generally speaking, is very hot, and in some of them very unwholesome. They are inhabited by Europeans, or the descend∣ants of Europeans and negroes.</P>
<P>St. Jago, where the Portuguese viceroy resides, is the most fruitful, best inhabited, and largest of them all; yet it is mountainous and has much barren land in it. Its produce is sugar, cotton, some wine, and several different sorts of excellent fruits. St. Jago, which is the capital, and the re∣sidence of the viceroy and governor, lies on the south side of the island. Baya, situate on the east side, has a good port, and is seldom without ships, those outward bound to Guinea or the East Indies, from England, Holland, and France, often touching here for water and refreshments. Here are some of the prettiest green monkies, with black faces, to be seen any where.</P>
<P>In the island of Mayo, a great deal of salt is made by the heat of the sun from the sea water, which, at spring tides, is received into a sort of pond, formed by a sand-bank, which runs along the coast for two or three miles. Our nation drives a great trade here for salt; and has commonly a man of war to guard the ships and barks, that come to load with it, of which, in some years, there are not less than a hundred. It costs nothing ex∣cept for raking it together, wheeling it out of the pond, and carrying it on asses to the boats, which is all done at a very cheap rate. Several of our ships come hither for a freight of asses, which they carry to Barbadoes, and our other plantations. The inhabitants of this island, even the governor
<PB N="231" REF="2300"/>
and priests, are all negroes, and speak the Portu∣guse language. The negro governor expects a small present from every commander that lades salt, and is glad to be invited aboard their ships.</P>
<P>The island Sal, as its name implies, is full of salt ponds, where the water naturally congeals into salt. At St. Vincent the Portuguese load hides.</P>
<P>In some of these islands are great numbers of Guinea hens, such as we have now very com∣monly in England, and flamingos, a large fowl, much like a heron in shape, but bigger, and of a reddish colour: they feed and build their nests in shallow ponds, where there is much mud, which they scrape together, making little hil∣locks, like small islands, tapering from the bot∣tom to the top, in which they leave a small hol∣low to lay their eggs in; and when they either lay their eggs or hatch them, they stand all the while, not on the hillock but close by it, with their legs on the ground and in the water, resting themselves against the hillock, and covering the hollow nest upon the top of it with their rump. There are also two species of fruit in these islands, which seem to be peculiar to them: one of them is called a custard apple, and the other a papah: the custard apple is as big as a pomegranate, and almost of the same colour, with the inside full of a sweet soft pulp, resembling a custard the most of any thing both in colour and taste. The papah is a fruit about the bigness of a musk-melon, which it also much resembles both in shape and colour; when ripe, it is sweet, soft, and luscious; and even while green, being boiled and eaten with salt pork and beef, it serves instead of turneps, and is much esteemed.</P>

<P>These islands antiently called Insulae Beatae, or Fortunatae, i. e. the happy or fortunate islands, are seven in number, situate between twelve and nineteen degrees of west longitude, and between twenty-seven and twenty-nine of north latitude, about a hundred and fifty miles south west of Mo∣rocco. Their names are Palma, Hierro, Gomera, Teneriffe, Gran Canaria, Fuerte Ventura, and Lan∣zarote. Palma, and Hierro lie most to the West: their soil is rich; they have good pasture ground, produce excellent wine, sugar, &amp;c. and abound in fruits. They have each of them a town of the same name. The first is seven leagues long, six broad, and twenty-two in circumference; the latter ten leagues long, seven broad, and twenty-six round. Hierro has a commodious haven; and Palma a volcano, that emits vast quantities of sul∣phureous matter, as we learn from Juan Nunez de Pena. On the western point of the former, most mo∣dern geographers place the first meridian. Gomera, situate to the south of Palma, is very fruitful, af∣fording plenty of grain, apples, sugar, and wine, with pasture for numerous herds of cattle. It takes up twenty-two leagues in compass, and has a considerable town of the same name, besides a very capacious harbour. Teneriffe, to the east of Hierro, is said to be sixty miles long. In it there is a famous mountain called the Peak of Te∣neriffe, frequently covered with snow, which ren∣ders it probable that this island was Pliny's Ni∣varia, and Ptolemy's Ninguaria. The Peak is an ascent of about fifteen miles, and five in per∣pendicular height. We are told, when these islands were discovered by M. Jean de Bitancourt, a French gentleman, for Don Juan, king of
<PB N="233" REF="2320"/>
Castile, in 1405, the inhabitants of Teneriffe were under several kings, who lived in caves; and that they kept the bodies of their ancestors dried like mummies. The towns in it are St. Christo∣pher de la Laguna, Santa Cruz, Rotava, or Oro∣tava-Rialego, and Garachico.</P>
<P>Canaria, or Gran Canaria, had the same name among the antients, as we learn from Pliny, so that it is probable, it was not given by the Spa∣niards, as some writers suggest; as likewise, that some knowledge of it has been retained all along from the Roman times, since the name assigned it by the Romans has been preserved to the present times. It is eleven leagues broad, twelve long, thirty-eight in compass, and about thirty from Cape Bosador on the coast of Africa. Its situa∣tion is east of Teneriffe, and its capital city Palma, Palmes, or Canaria. In fertility it equals, at least, if it does not exceed any of the others.</P>
<P>Fuerte Ventura, lies east of Gran Canaria, and about twenty-five leagues from the coast of Africa. It is likewise fruitful, and has four towns, Tara∣fala, Lanagala, Pozzo Negro, and Fuerte Ven∣tura.</P>
<P>Lanzarote, lying north of the former, and in all points answering to the rest, has three towns, Lanza∣rote, Puerto de Naos, and Puerto de Cavallos.</P>
<P>Though these seven are the principal islands that go under the name of the Canaries, yet there are several others in the neighbourhood of less note; as the Isla de los Lobos, situate between Fuerte Ventura, and Lanzarote; Salvatica, lying further towards the north west; add to these Roc∣ca, Gratiosa, Santa Clara, and Aagranza, on the north of Lanzarote. They are all subject to the king of Spain, and Canaria is the See of a bishop, subject to the metropolitan of Seville. Canaria for∣merly produced a sort of dates, and pine apples,
<PB N="234" REF="2330"/>
in considerable plenty, according to Pliny. In the rivers also of these islands grows the plant papy∣rus, as in the Nile, if the same author may be cre∣dited. From the custom of preserving the bodies of their ancestors, in the manner above mentioned, it seems probable, that the antient inhabitants of Teneriffe were either a colony of the Ethiopi∣ans, or descended from the first progenitors of that people. The Canaries abound with those little beautiful singing birds that bear their name, and are now so common and so much ad∣mired in Europe; but their wild notes in their native land far excel those in a cage or foreign clime. Of the rich wines, which from hence ob∣tain the name of Canary, no less, it is said, than ten thousand hogsheads are annually exported to England in time of peace.</P>
<P>The island of Hierro or Ferro, which has nei∣ther river, spring, fountain, nor well, was form∣erly, we are told, supplied with water, by means of a particular sort of tree, each of which yielded a large quantity in the night, when a cloud always hovered over them; but the inhabitants now save rain water in cisterns, and for common use filtrate brackish water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The MADEIRA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The three islands called the Madeiras, are situate under the seventeenth and eighteenth degrees of west longitude, and between thirty-two and thirty-three degrees of north latitude, about a hundred miles north of the Canaries, and as many west of Sallee in Morocco. The chief of them, from which the rest derive the general name of Maderas, or Madeiras, is about seventy-five miles long, sixty broad, and a hundred and eighty in circumference. Though it seems to have been known to the antients, yet it
<PB N="235" REF="2340"/>
lay concealed for many generations; and was at length discovered by the Portuguse, commanded by Don Juan Zarco, and Don Tristano vaz, in 1519. Others maintain that one John Machin, an Eng∣lishman, discovered it in the year 1344. Be that as it will, the Portuguese took possession of it in the year above mentioned, and are still almost the only people inhabiting it. The name Madera, or Madeira was derived from the vast store of wood with which it was stocked, the Portuguese, at their first landing, finding it little better than a thick forest. In order, therefore, to render the ground capable of cultivation, they set fire to this wood, which, ac∣cording to their writers, occasioned a conflagration of seven years continuance. It is now very fertile, producing in great abundance, the richest wine, su∣gar, the most delicious fruits, especially oranges, lemons, and pomegranates, together with corn, honey, and wax. It abounds also with boars and other wild beasts, and with all sorts of fowls, be∣sides numerous groves of cedar trees, and those that yield dragon's blood, mastic, and other gums. The air of Madeira is more temperate than that of the Canaries, yet so warm, that there is here a perpetual spring, and fruit or blossoms through∣out the whole year. The lemons here are vastly large, and even the European fruit trees thrive exceedingly. The inhabitants of this island make the best sweetmeats in the world, and succeed won∣derfully in preserving citrons and oranges, and in making marmalades and perfumed pastes, which exceed those of Genoa, whatever the Italians may pretend. The sugar they make is extremely beautiful, and smells naturally of violets. This, it is said, was the first place in the West where that manufacture was set on foot; but the Portuguese not finding it so profitable as at first, have pulled up the greatest part of their sugar canes, and
<PB N="236" REF="2350"/>
planted vineyards in their stead, which produce several sorts of excellent wines, as that which bears the name of the island, malmsey, and tent, of all which the inhabitants make and sell prodi∣gious quantities. No less than twenty thousand hogsheads, it is said, are yearly exported, the greatest part to the West Indies, especially to Barbadoes; Madeira wine not only enduring a hot climate better than any other, but being even improved, when exposed to the sun, in the barrel, after the bung is taken off.</P>
<P>Of the two other islands one is called Porto Santo, which lies at a small distance from Madera, and under the jurisdiction of the same bishop and governor. It is only eight miles in compass, but the soil is extremely fertile, producing in particular the best honey and wax in the world. The other, called by the Spaniards, Isla Desierta, i. e. the Desolate Isle, is inconsiderable, being not only bar∣ren, but of a very small extent.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>IF we consider commerce, industry, and labour, as necessary to the opulence and happiness of society, we cannot but regard the disco∣very of the vast continent of America, and the in∣finity of wealthy islands with which it is sur∣rounded, as one of the most important conse∣quences of the happy discovery of the compass, and the improvement in navigation. Without a knowledge of the West Indies, the intercourse with the East would be of little advantage to Eu∣rope; it might even be pernicious, by drain∣ing it of the gold and silver: whereas we now purchase the commodities of the latter, not only with European manufactures, but with the silver dug in the mines of Potosi. To her pos∣sessions in Chili, Peru, Mexico, and the Antilles, Spain owes all her opulence. Great Britain hath, by means of her colonies on the continent of Ame∣rica,
<PB N="238" REF="2370"/>
and her islands in the West Indies, raised herself to her present astonishing and much envied height of grandeur and importance. The very existence of Portugal depends in a great measure upon her possessions in Brazil; even the barren Canada, and Cape-Breton, were fruitful of bles∣ings to France, while in her possession, by pro∣moting her trade and navigation, not to speak of the benefits arising to her at present from Guada∣loupe, St. Domingo, Martinico, and St. Lucia. The intercourse with Surinam, and the Spanish main, and the islands of St. Eustatia, and Cura∣sao, have brought great wealth into Holland. In a word, every nation in Europe have made attempts to obtain some establishments in a country fraught with all these commodities, which the progress of science, of luxury, and refinement, has rendered almost essential to existence.</P>
<P>The trade of Great-Britain is much indebted to her colonies, though it has been purchased at a vast expence of blood and treasure. The trade to these colonies is in fact a foreign commerce, carried on and conducted under the direction of the mother country; accordingly we find, that in proportion as the several crowns of Europe cherish their plantations, while at the same time they keep them in a just subordination and dependence, they acquire a large share of maritime strength, establish a more fruitful nursery of seamen, gain a more con∣siderable fund of wealth, and promise fairer for the superiority of the sea. How much then are the disputes that at present subsist between Great Britain and some of her colonies to be regretted by all who wish well to both? However, to insist on the im∣portance to Europe of the gold of Chili and Brasil, of the silver of Peru, the sugar, indigo, and coffee of the Antilles, the furs of Canada, the fish of Newfoundland, the tobacco of Virginia
<PB N="239" REF="2380"/>
and Maryland, the precious stones, balsams, gems, drugs, dying woods, and other commodities, of the islands and continent of America, would not only be foreign to our design, but repeating what has been hackneyed by every political writer since they were first discovered.</P>
<P>America was so called from Americus Vespucio, a Florentine by birth, who, in 1497, was sent to improve the discoveries made by Columbus. The prodigious magnitude of this continent, the mul∣titude and extent of its provinces, the diversity of its climates, inhabitants, and languages, its distance from Europe, its being over-run with vast forests, lakes, and mountains, interspersed with large rivers, inhabited, in a great measure, by rude uncivilized savages, have been the cause that it is still but im∣perfectly known; though great advances have been made of late towards a more full and com∣pleat discovery, especially in regard to North-Ame∣rica, where exact surveys have been made of many large tracts on the great inland lakes and rivers, little known before. This continent reaches, at least what has been hitherto discovered, from latitude 78°. north, to latitude 56°. south, that is, an hundred and thirty-four degrees; which, taken in a streight line, amount to upwards of eight thousand and forty miles in length. With regard to breadth, it is very irregular, being in some places three thousand six hundred and ninety miles, and in others, as at the isthmus of Darien, or Panama, not above sixty or seventy. The boundaries ascribed to it are the lands about the pole on the north; the Atlantic Ocean, which separates it from Europe and Asia, on the east; another vast ocean on the south; and the Pacific Ocean, usually called the South Sea, which di∣vides it from Asia, on the west.</P>
<P><PB N="$40" REF="2390"/>
This vast country was not discovered till the year 1492, when the enterprizing genius of Co∣lumbus prompted him to make the bold adventur∣ous attempt, which was crowned with success. The honour, however, of this discovery, has been claimed by all the maritime nations of Europe. The Spaniards tell us, that Columbus received his lights from Captain Aldres, their countryman, who had been cast away on the coasts; and the French, say he had them from Betincourt, who first discovered the Azores. It would be a difficult matter to de∣termine this contest: but it appears, that our claim to the discovery of this New World is prior to that of the Spaniards, whose pretensions seem to be the best grounded: for no one can dispute the authenticity of those vouchers, whereby it appears, that Sebastian Cabot, a Venetian, a man no less enterprizing or less skilled in navigation, than Columbus himself, was sent by our Henry VII. a year before the dis∣covery of Columbus; and that having first disco∣vered Newfoundland, he sailed along the coast as far as Florida.</P>
<P>This quarter of the globe, besides the name of America, is sometimes also distinguished by that of the New World, and the West Indies. The European nations, who have the largest settlements or possessions in it, are the Spaniards, English, and Portuguese; and next to them, the French, Dutch, and Danes; but most of these settlements are only in the islands, and along the coast, the far greater part of the interior country being as yet in the possession of the natives. How or whence America was first peopled, cannot be ascer∣tained; but if the north of Asia is joined to Ame∣rica, as seems highly probable, it is most likely to have been from thence, especially as the natives of these parts still bear a great resemblance to one
<PB N="241" REF="2400"/>
another in many respects: besides it is possible some ship or ships might have been blown over to it from the coast of Africa or Europe, after they first ventured into the ocean from the Mediterranean; or perhaps even from the Ethiopic or Eastern Ocean, and as they had not the use of the compass would not attempt to cross such a wide sea again; but the wild beasts that are found here must have gone thither by land, and not in ships, or across the ocean.</P>
<P>The various tribes of the native Americans, as far as we are yet acquainted with them, are found to bear a wonderful likeness, both in their persons and manners; for they have all coarse black hair on their heads, but none on any other parts of their bodies, not even on their faces, except those in the country called Labrador, in North America, who have not only thick bushy beards, and hair on other parts of their bodies, but eat also raw flesh, and go cloathed both in summer and winter; in all which re∣spects they differ from the others, and are therefore supposed to have a different origin. Several voyagers also mention a people at the other extremety of the continent, about the straits of Magellan, of a gigantic stature; and these accounts have been confirmed by the honourable commodore Byron and his crew, who lately returned from the South Sea in the Dolphin man of war.</P>

<HEAD>NORTH AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>IN describing the several countries of America, we shall begin from the north and proceed regularly southward, according to the rule we have observed in treating of the other quarters of the globe.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>NEW BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<P>New Britain, or the country lying round Hud∣son's Bay, and commonly called the country of the Esquimaux, comprehending Labrador, New North and South Wales, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Is bounded by unknown lands about the pole on the north; by the Atlantic Ocean and Baffin's Bay on the west; by the bay and river of St. Laurence and Canada on the south; and by unknown lands on the west.</P>
<P>There are very high mountains in this country towards the north, which being perpetually covered with snow, and the winds blowing from thence three quarters of the year, are the chief occasion of that excessive cold which is found on this continent, beyond any thing that has been known on the eastern continent, under the same parallels of la∣titude. The winter generally sets in in September, and continues till June; during most of that time the snow lies very deep upon the ground, and the rivers are frozen eight or nine feet thick. The lands near the south end of the bay produce large timber, and plenty of herbage, and no doubt would produce corn, if cultivated. The country about Fort Nelson is a low marshy soil, producing juniper, birch, poplar, a small wood of the
<PB N="343" REF="2420"/>
spruce or fir kind; but little other herbage, besides moss; neither corn nor pasture is to be expected in the north, where the earth, even in summer, remains frozen six feet deep, and the mountains are perpetually covered with snow. The soil of the south coast of Hudson's Straits, known by the name of Terra de Labrador, is much of the same nature as that on the western side of the bay. Ter∣ra de Labrador is of a triangular form, extending from the fiftieth to the sixty-third degree of lati∣tude, and from the fifty-first to the seventy-ninth degree of longitude, west from London. The in∣land parts of this country are but little known, and are inhabited by certain tribes of Esquimaux In∣dians, the most untamed and untractable people in America. They were first discovered by the Danes, but no settlement has ever been made in their country. They have no settled habitations; nor do we know of any villages or towns among them: they are thought to be so numerous, that they can bring thirty thousand fighting men into the field; but though mischievous, untamable, and treache∣rous, they are excessively cowardly. Sometimes, in the night-time, they will cut the cables of ships, that they may enjoy their wrecks in the morn∣ing.</P>
<P>The only commodities they trade in, are furs, which they exchange for knives, scissars, pots, kettles, and the like hardware; but if an Euro∣pean ship should suffer them to come on board in too great numbers, they will, if they can, mas∣ter the crew, and plunder the vessel. The food of these and the other Indians about Hudson's Bay, and indeed all over America, is chiefly what they take in hunting and fishing; for here is a great variety of land animals, besides fish and fowl: among the first are the moose deer, elks, stags, rein-deer, bears, tygers, buffaloes, wolves, foxes, beavers, otters, lynxes, martens, squirrels, wild cats, and
<PB N="244" REF="2430"/>
hares: of the feathered kind are geese, ducks, bustards, partridges, and many other sorts: of fish, whales, morses, seals, cod, a white fish, pre∣ferable to herrings, &amp;c. and in the rivers and fresh waters, pike, perch, carp, and trout. The foxes, hares, and partridges turn white in winter; the last are as large as hens. There have been taken or killed at Port Nelson, in one season, ninety thou∣sand partridges, and twenty-five thousand hares.</P>
<P>The principal settlements belonging to our Hud∣son's Bay company at present are, Forts Churchill, Nelson, New Severn, and Albany, on the west side of the Bay; and they had formerly Forts Charles and Rupert, at the bottom of the Bay. The English in these factories kill beef, pork, mutton, and venison at the beginning of winter, and these are preserved by the frost six or seven months, free from putrefaction: geese also, partridges, and other fowls, killed at the same time, are hung up with their feathers and guts, yet hold good all the winter. In lakes and standing waters, which are not ten feet deep, the water is frozen to the bottom, and the fish killed; but in waters of greater depth, and rivers near the sea, the fish are caught all the winter by cutting holes in the ice, to which they come for air. As soon as they are taken out of the water, they are immediately frozen and stiff, but may be thawed again by being immersed in cold water; and thus it is that the salt provisions are thawed and freshened here: the meat is let down through a hole in the ice into the water, and in a little time it becomes soft and pliable, as if it never had been frozen, and eats very well; whereas roasted or boiled, while frozen, it will be spoiled, and eat as if it was rotten. There is no want of food about Hudson's Bay at any time of the year. In April come the geese, bustards, and ducks, of which they kill as many as they please. About
<PB N="245" REF="2440"/>
the same time they take great numbers of rain∣deer, and these do not return to the north till July or August. In summer they also take pike, trout, carp, and other fish; and in the beginning of winter, all manner of wild fowl return again.</P>
<P>A thousand Indian men, and some women, in a∣bout six hundred canoes come down usually to Port Nelson to trade with the English. Many of them come from far distant countries, and are much delayed in their voyages, by being obliged to go on shore every day to hunt for provisions; for their canoes are so small, holding only two men, and a pack of beaver skins, that they cannot carry much provision with them. These Indians are of a tawny complexion, and not so fair as those in Labrador, nor of such large robust bodies; but much more gentle, and tractable. In sum∣mer they wear scarce any cloaths, but anoint themselves with bears grease, or the oil of seals, which it is said, prevents their being stung by musketos, or bit by bugs, or any other insects; but those in Labrador go always cloathed. In win∣ter the southern Esquimaux Indians cloath themselves with beaver skins, which they oil and grease in the same manner as they do their own skins in summer, which prevents the cold penetrating them, and have a kind of buskins on their legs, and shoes of deer skins: they use also beaver skins and furs for their beds and covering in the night. The Indians of all sorts, inhabiting the country about Hudson's Bay, lead a wandering life, seldom re∣maining more than a week or two in a place; and most of their time is spent in hunting and fishing.</P>
<P>The Hudson's Bay company, it is probable, do not find their trade so advantageous now as it was before we got possession of Quebec, when they enjoyed the fur trade, almost without a rival, at least in respect of the British dominions; whence
<PB N="246" REF="2450"/>
their profits must have been very great, especially as they availed themselves to the utmost of their exclusive charter, and made the poor Indians pay very dear for every thing they wanted of them.</P>
<P>This company, which does not consist of above nine or ten merchants, obtained their first char∣ter from Charles II. in the year 1669, by which the sole property of all the lands, trade, royal fishery, and mines, within Hudson's Straits, not actually possessed by any Christian prince, was vested in them.</P>
<P>According to Mr. Dobs, who has given the best account of Hudson's Bay, it may be esteemed from 51° to 65°. north latitude, and from 78° to 95°. west longitude from London. The whole of its extent, in length, may be about six hundred miles, and its northern boundary may be reckoned at Davis's Straits, the country to the north of that being claimed by Denmark. The dimensions at the en∣trance of the Straits are variously represented. At Re∣solution Island they are said to be twelve or thirteen leagues wide, but others make it not half so wide. As to the Straits themselves, they are said to be a hun∣dred and twenty leagues in length; the shores on both sides being inhabited by a most savage race. At the mouth of the Straits lies Resolution Island, and in the Straits themselves lie the islands Charles, Salisbury and Nottingham; and Mans∣field Island is situated in the mouth of the Bay. On the other side of Hudson's Straits, to the north of Labrador, lies what is called the North-Main, which is bounded on the east by Davis's Straits, on the north by Baffin's Bay, and on the west by a nameless strait.</P>
<P>The country lying round Baffin's Bay goes by the name of Prince William's Land; but we know no∣thing more of it. To the south of Prince Wil∣liam's Land lies New North Wales, which has on its
<PB N="247" REF="2460"/>
south New Denmark, and on its west another land, but both of them unknown. Several islands lie on the coast of Labrador, without the Bay: of these the chief is Newfoundland. The country from Button's Bay southward and eastward, as far as La∣brador, is called New South-Wales. In Hudson's Bay are a great many lesser bays, as James's Bay, Button's Bay, Baffin's Bay, Sir Thomas's Bay, Roe's Bay, Welcome Bay, Wager Bay, Rankin's Inlet, Hope's Bay, Brigg's Bay, Cumberland Bay, Repulse Bay, &amp;c. The chief capes in and about the Bay are Cape Charles, on the Strait of Belleisle, Cape Desire, at the entrance of Hudson's Strait, Cape Henry, Cape James, and Cape Worsenham, near the entrance of Hudson's Bay, Cape Henrietta Maria, Cape Look Out, and Cape Hope, on the west and south west part of the Bay, Cape Dobbs, Cape Com∣fort, and Cape Assumption, on the north part of the Bay. There are innumerable lakes, bogs, and morasses all over those vast tracts lying round the Bay, which being covered with ice and snow great part of the year, as well as the mountains, render the air excessive cold, especially when the wind sits north-west. It seems to be as cold in fifty-two de∣grees of north latitude on the western continent, as it is on the eastern in sixty-two. A great many rivers fall into the Bay, particularly on the west and south sides, as Churchill River, Nelson's River, New Se∣vern River, Albany River, and Moose River. Nel∣son's river is the largest and finest in the Bay; Prince Rupert's and Sluda rivers lie on the east side of the Bay. There are forts and factories at the mouths of all the rivers, except Prince Rupert's and New Severn River.</P>
<P>The eastern shores of this country were first dis∣covered by Sebastian Cabot, for Henry VII. king of England, in the year 1498. They were after∣wards visited by Davis, and other British mariners. Mr. Hudson made four voyages thither, between
<PB N="248" REF="2470"/>
the years 1607 and 1611; in the last of which, his men forced him and eight more into a boat, and left them to starve in the bottom of the Bay, and they were never heard of more.</P>
<P>Sir Thomas Button pursued the discovery in 1612, and captain James in 1631, in hopes of finding a north-west passage to China. Captain Gilham sailed to the bottom of the Bay in 1667, and at his return his owners procured a patent for planting this country. The first English gover∣nor who went thither was Charles Batley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who built a fort on Rupert River, calling it Charles Fort, and soon after settled another factory at Nel∣son River. In the year 1684, the chief English factory was at Albany River, with a fort erected for its defence. The French invaded our settlements, and took Fort Rupert and Albany, in July 1686, though we were then at peace with France; but in king William's war, in 1693, the English recover∣ed their settlements again. During the war in queen Anne's reign, the French reduced all our settlements, except Albany; but were obliged to restore them again at the peace of Utrecht, and the company have remained in possession of them ever since; and now, that we are masters of all Ca∣nada, they have nothing to apprehend from that quarter.</P>
<P>To convince our readers of what we advanced above concerning the gains of the company, and there usage of the Indians, we shall here insert the standard or regulation formerly prescribed by them for their goods bartered on the southern part of the Bay. Guns, one with another, ten good skins, that is, winter-beaver; twelve skins for the biggest sort, ten for the mean, and eight for the smallest: pow∣der, a beaver for half a pound: shot, a beaver for four pounds: hatchets, a beaver for a great and small one: knives, a beaver for six great ones, or
<PB N="249" REF="2480"/>
eight jack-knives: beads, a beaver for half a pound: laced coats, six beavers for a good one: plain coats, five beavers for a red one: coats for women laced, two yards, six beavers: coats for women plain, five beavers: tobacco, a beaver for one pound: powder-horns, a beaver for a large one and two small ones: kettles, a beaver for eve∣ry pound: and looking-glasses and combs, two beavers.</P>
<P>It is said, that the annual exports, before the late peace, were only about three thousand pounds value, and their half-yearly sales about twenty-five thousand pounds. They were then supposed to be at the charge of one hundred and twenty servants a year, and about an hundred and twenty men on board the two or three annual ships, which they sent to the bay. Their imports are deer-skins, cas∣torum or beaver-stone, feathers, whale bone, and blubber; but beaver-skin is two thirds of the whole. The beaver-skins are worth from three shillings and sixpence to five or six shillings a pound.</P>

<HEAD>CANADA.</HEAD>
<P>This country, of which the British arms made an entire conquest in the late war, is bounded on the north by New-Britain; on the east by New-Scotland, New-England, and New-York; on the south by the Apalachian and Cherokee mountains, or the Great Lakes; and by unknown lands on the west.</P>
<P>The country being extensive, the climate and soil cannot but be very various. All that part now inhabited by the French and English, and which lies mostly along the great river St. Laurence, is, generally speaking, excessive cold in winter, though hot in summer, as most of those American tracts are that do not lie too far to the northward. The
<PB N="250" REF="2490"/>
rest of the country, as far as it is known, is full of large woods, marshes, lakes, mountains, and rivers, which render it still colder. The lands, however, especially in the interior parts, and about the lakes and rivers, are said to be generally fertile, and capable of producing wheat, barley, rye, with many other sorts of grain, fruits, and vegeta∣bles; tobacco, in particular, thrives exceedingly, and is much cultivated. Here are plenty of stags, elks, deer, bears, foxes, martens, wild cats, ferrets, weasels, squirrels of a large size and greyish hue, hares, and rabbits. The southern parts also breed great numbers of wild bulls, deer of a small size, divers sorts of roebucks, goats, wolves, &amp;c. The marshes, lakes, and pools, swarm with otters, beavers, or castors, of which the white are highly valued, be∣ing scarce, as well as the right black kind. The beaver of Canada is an amphibious quadruped, which could live out of the water, if it had convenient bathing places. They are generally not quite four feet in length. Their colours are different, black, brown, white, yellow, and straw-colour; but it is observed, that the lighter their colour, the less quantity of fur they are cloathed with, and live in warmer climates. The flesh of the beaver is a most delicious food, when it is parboiled, to take away a disagreeable relish which it has naturally. Besides the fur, the beaver produces the true casto∣reum, which is contained in bags in the lower part of the belly, different from the testicles: the value of this drug is well known. The furs of the beaver are of two kinds, the dry and the green; the dry fur is the skin before it is applied to any use; the green are the furs that are worn, after being sewed to one another, by the Indians, who besmear them with unctuous substances, which not only render them more pliable, but give the fine down, that is manufactured into hats, that oily qua∣lity
<PB N="251" REF="2500"/>
which renders it proper to be worked up with the dry fur. Both the Dutch and English, since Charlevoix wrote, have found the secret of making excellent cloths, gloves, and stockings, as well as hats, from the beaver-fur. The musk rat is a di∣minutive kind of beaver, which it resembles in every thing but its tail, which is like that of a common European rat, and its testicles afford a very strong musk. The elk is of the size of a horse or mule; its feet and legs resemble those of a stag's, its neck and withers are covered with long hair, and it has a head about two feet long. His antlers resemble those of a doe. Many extraordinary me∣dicinal qualities, particularly for curing the falling∣sickness, are ascribed to the hoof of the left foot of this animal. Its flesh is very agreeable and nou∣rishing, and its colour a mixture of light grey and dark red. They love the cold countries; and when the winter affords them no grass, they gnaw the bark of trees. There is a carnivorous animal here, called the carcajou, of the feline or cat kind, with a tail so long that Charlevoix says, that he has twisted it several times round his body. Its body is about two feet in length, from the end of the snout to the tail. It is said, that this animal, winding himself about a tree, will dart from thence upon the elk, twist his strong tail round his body, and cut his throat in a moment. The buffaloe of Canada is much larger than that of Europe; but their appearance is much alike. His body is covered with a black wool, which is highly esteemed. The flesh of the female is very good; and the buffaloe hides are as soft and pliable as Chamois leather, but so very strong, that the bucklers which the Indians make use of are hard∣ly penetrable by a musket ball. The Canadian roebuck is a domestic animal, but differs in no other respect from those of Europe. Wolves are
<PB N="252" REF="2510"/>
scarce in Canada, but they afford the finest furs in all the country: their flesh is white, and good to eat, and they pursue their prey to the tops of the tallest trees. The black foxes are greatly esteemed, and very scarce; but those of other co¦lours are more common; and some on the Upper Mississippi are of a silver colour, and very beautiful. They live upon water-fowls, which they decoy within their clutches by a thousand antic tricks, and then spring upon them, and devour them. The Canadian poll-cat has a most beautiful white fur, except the tip of his tail, which is as black as jet. When pursued, he lets fly his urine, which, it is said, infects the air for a quarter of a league round; for which reason, he is called by the inhabitants the devil's brat, or the stinkard. Charlevoix says, the common marten's skin is worth a crown, and the brown ones seven shillings. The Canadian wood-rat is of a beautiful silver colour, with a bushy tail, and as big again as the European: the female carries under her belly a bag, which she opens and shuts at pleasure; and in that she places her young, when pursued. There are three sorts of squirrels: that called the flying squirrel will leap forty paces and more, from one tree to ano∣ther. This little animal is easily tamed, and is very lively, except when asleep, which is often the case; and he puts up wherever he can find a place, in one's sleeve, pocket, or muff: he first pitches on his master, whom he will distinguish amongst twenty persons. The Canadian porcupine is less than a middling dog: when roasted, he eats full as well as a sucking pig. The hares and rabbits differ little from those in Europe, only they turn grey in winter. There are two sorts of bears here; one of a reddish, and the other of a black co∣lour; but the former is the most dangerous. Some
<PB N="253" REF="2520"/>
of the rivers breed a kind of crocodile, that differs but little from those of the Nile.</P>
<P>The meadow-grounds in Canada, which are well watered, yield excellent grass, and breed vast num∣bers of great and small cattle: and where the ara∣ble land is well manured, it produces rich crops. The mountains abound with coal-mines, and some, we are told, with silver and other metals; though we have not heard of any great advantage made of them as yet.</P>
<P>The lakes are both large and numerous: the prin∣cipal are Lake Superior, Michigan, those of the Illinois and Hurons, Lake Erie, Lake Ontario, Frontenac, or Oswego, Lake Champlain, and Ti∣miscaining, besides others of a smaller size. Lake Superior, or the Upper Lake, which is situated the farthest north, is reckoned one hundred leagues in length, and about seventy where broadest, and hath several considerable islands in it; the chief of which are, the Royal Isle, Pont Chartrain, Mau∣repas, St. Anne, St. Ignatius, Hoequart, and Mi∣nong. A considerable trade is now carried on by barks and canoes through some of these lakes, par∣ticularly Ontario, Erie, and Champlain, most of the forts being situated on them.</P>
<P>The whole country abounds with large rivers, which it would be endless to enter into a detail of; the principal are those of St. Laurence, the Out∣tauais, St. John's, Seguinay, Désprairies, and Trois-Rivieres. You enter the bay of St. Laurence be∣tween Cape de Retz, on the island of Newfound∣land, and the North Cape, on that called the Royal Island, or more commonly Cape Breton. After doubling Cape Rose, or Rosieres, you enter the ri∣ver, which runs north-east and south-west. At the mouth of the river the cold is intense, and the sea boisterous. The river itself, at its opening, is about thirty leagues in breadth; and towards the south lie the bay and point of Gaspey. Below this
<PB N="254" REF="2530"/>
bay is a steep rock, which has obtained the name of the Bored Island, from an aperture in its middle, through which a sloop may pass with her sails up. At a leagues distance from the Bored Island lies the island Bonaventure; and at a league distance from that the island Miscon, which has an excellent har∣bour, and is eight leagues in circumference. A sprin of fresh water spouts up to a considerable height in the offing, not far from this island. The next object that presents itself in the river St. Law∣rence is the island Anticosti; and the current set∣ting strongly in upon it, renders the navigation here extremely dangerous, in case of a calm, espe∣cially as the island is lined with breakers. This island is narrow; but lies in the middle of the river, and extends about forty leagues, from narth-east to south-west. The French have repre∣sented it as absolutely good for nothing: its coasts, however, are well stored with fish. After passing this island, the navigation becomes more tolerable; but still great precaution must be used. The mounts Notre Dame and Lewis lie on the larboard side: near the latter are some French plantations. The next point is Trinity Point, which must be avoided with great care. A little higher are the Paps of Montani, so called from the appearance of the mountain, situated about two leagues from the shore. The land in the neighbourhood is said to be not only unprofitable, but frightful; be∣ing covered with rocks, sands, and impenetrable thickets: it contains, however, plenty of game. On the other side the river, and advancing two leagues into its bed, lies the shoal of Mani∣couagu, which is the most dangerous in the river: it is named from a river that falls from the mountains of Labrador, and otherwise called the river of St. Barnabas, and the Black River. From this to Green Island the navigation is
<PB N="255" REF="2540"/>
slow and uncertain, and the shores uncomfortable and uninhabited. Somewhat higher lies the river Saguenay, which carries ships twenty-five leagues above its mouth, where is an excellent harbour, called Tadoussac; in sailing from which, great care must be taken to avoid the Red Island, which is a dangerous rock of that colour, whose surface is equal to the water, and often proves fatal to shipping. About fifteen leagues distance, that is, midway between Quebec and Tadoussac, lies the isle of Coudres, where the passage of the river is dangerous, without a fair wind; in particular, there is a whirlpool, that must be carefully guard∣ed against. Next appears the Bay of St. Paul, where the plantations on the north shore be∣gin: they consist of valuable woods of pine-trees, among which are red pines, which are esteem∣ed very beautiful; here likewise is a fine lead mine. About six leagues above this is a very high promontory, which terminates a chain of moun∣tains that reach above four hundred leagues to the westward, and is called Cape Torment: round the anchoring place here lie a number of islands, a∣mong which is that of Orleans, which forms a most beautiful prospect. It is about fourteen leagues in circumference, and populous, as pro∣ducing excellent wheat, and fine fruits. It forms two channels, of which the south is the most navi∣gable: here the water becomes drinkable; for it is brackish at Cape Torment, though it is an hun∣dred and ten leagues from the sea. The higher up the river, the flux of the tide diminishes, and the reflux increases, and twenty leagues above Quebec the tide is not perceptible; but indeed the tides in this river, as well as the currents, vary greatly, according to the seasons, and the positions of the lands. It is very large and deep, and con∣tains
<PB N="256" REF="2550"/>
several islands, all the way from Quebec to Lake Ontario, whence it issues.</P>
<P>Of the Mississippi we shall give some account, when we come to Louisiana, to which it more pro∣perly belongs, and of which the greater part is now included in the province of West Florida.</P>
<P>Father Charlevoix is of opinion, that the Cana∣dian fishery, if properly improved, would be more likely to enrich that country than the fur trade. Besides a great variety of other fish in the lakes and rivers, particularly that of St. Lawrence, are sea∣wolves, sea-cows, porpoises, the lencornet, the go∣berque, the sea plaise, salmon trouts, turtles, lobs∣ters, the chaourasou, sturgeon, the achigau, and the gilthead. The sea-wolf, so called from its howl∣ing, is an amphibious creature. His head resem∣bles that of a dog: he has four very short legs, of which the fore ones have nails; but the hind ones terminate in fins. The largest are said to weigh two thousand pounds, and are of different colours. Their flesh is good eating; but the profit of it lies in its oil, which is proper for burning, and currying of leather. Their skins make excellent coverings for trunks, and though not so fine as Morocco lea∣ther, they preserve their freshness better, and are less liable to cracks. The shoes and boots made of those skins let in no water, and, when properly tanned, make excellent and lasting covers for seats. The Canadian sea-cow is larger than the sea-wolf, but resembles it in figure. It has two teeth of the thickness and length of a man's arm, that, when grown, look like horns, and are very fine ivory, as well as its other teeth. Some of the porpoises of the river St. Lawrence are said to yield a hogshead of oil, and of their skins are made waistcoats, which are excessively strong, and musket-proof. The lencornet is a kind of cuttle fish, quite round,
<PB N="257" REF="2560"/>
or rather oval: there are two sorts of them, which differ only in size; some being as large as a hogs∣head, and others but a foot long: they catch only the last, and that with a torch: they are excellent eating, roasted, boiled, or fricasied; but they make the sauce quite black. The goberque has the taste and smell of a small cod. The sèa-plaise is excellent eating; and they are taken with long poles, armed with iron hooks. The chaourasou is an armed fish, resembling a pike; but is covered with scales, that are proof against a dagger: some of them are above five feet long, and about the thickness of a man's thigh: this fish is said even to catch and devour birds; in order to which, he con∣ceals himself among the canes or reeds, in such a manner that nothing is to be seen besides his weapon, which he holds, raised perpendicularly, above the surface of the water: the fowls, which come to take rest, imagining the weapon to be only a withered reed, make no scruple of perching upon it; but they are no sooner alighted, than the fish opens his throat, and so suddenly makes at his prey, that it rarely escapes. The Indians pretend their teeth are a soverign remedy against the tooth ach, and that, by pricking the part most affected with one of them, the pain instantly vanishes. The stur∣geon is both a fresh and salt-water fish, from eight to twelve feet long, and proportionably thick: the smallest have a flesh of a most delicate grain, and are excellent eating. The achigau, and the gilt-head, are fish peculiar to the river St. Law∣rence.</P>
<P>The forests of Canada are not so well stocked with birds as its rivers are with fishes. They con∣tain two kinds of eagles; the largest of which have a white head and neck, and prey upon hares and rabbits, which they carry up to their nests; but
<PB N="258" REF="2570"/>
the other are grey, and prey on birds and fishes. The falcons, goshawks, tercels, are the same as in Eu∣rope: the partridges are grey, red, and black, with long tails, which they spread out as a fan, like a turkey-cock, and make a very beautiful appear∣ance. Woodcocks are very scarce in Canada; but snipes, and other water-game, are plentiful. A Canadian raven is said by some writers to eat as well as a pullet, and an owl better. Blackbirds and swallows are birds of passage here, as well as in Europe, and three kinds of larks are found here, one species little different from European ones. No fewer than twenty two different species of ducks are to be met with in Canada; and a great number of swans, turkeys, geese, bustards, teal, water-hens, cranes, and other large water-fowl; but always at a distance from houses. The cranes, of which some are white, and light grey, are said to make excellent soup. The Canadian wood-pecker is a beautiful bird. The thrushes and gold-finches here differ little from those of Europe. The chief Canadian bird of melody is the white-bird, which is a kind of ortelan, very shewy, and remarkable for announcing the return of spring. The fly-bird is thought to be the most beautiful of any in na∣ture; with all his plumage, he is no bigger than a cock chafer, and he makes a noise with his wings like the humming of a large fly: his legs are like two needles, and from his bill, which is of the same thickness, a small sting proceeds, with which he pierces the flowers, and thereby nou∣rishes himself with the sap: the female has nothing striking in its appearance; but the male is a perfect jewel, having on his head a small tuft of the most beautiful black, his breast red, his belly white, his back, wings, and tail green, like that of a rose-bush; specks of gold scat∣tered all over the plumage, add greatly to its beauty; and an imperceptible down produces the
<PB N="259" REF="2580"/>
most delightful shadings that can be imagined Rattle-snakes are found in Canada, some of them as thick or thicker than a man's leg: when he moves, his tail, which is covered with rows of scales, rattles, whence he has his name. His bite is mor∣tal, but an herb grows wherever this reptile is found in this country, called the rattle-snake's-plant, which is an infallible antidote to the poison of his bite, by chewing it, and applying it in the nature of a plaister to the wound. The rattle-snake seldom bites passengers, unless he is provoked or trod upon. The Indians, however, pursue them, and greatly prize their flesh, which they eat.</P>
<P>The forests of Canada present a most beau∣tiful and awful appearance, and contain vast variety of trees, among which are two sorts of pines, the white and the red; four sorts of firs; two sorts of cedar and oak, the white and the red; the male and female maple; three sorts of ash-trees, the free, the mungrel, and the bastard; three sorts of walnut-trees, the hard, the soft, and the smooth; vast numbers of beech trees, and white wood; white and red elms; and poplars. The Iroquois hollow the red elms into canoes, some of which, made out of one piece, will con∣tain twenty persons. About November the bears and wild cats take up their habitations in the hol∣low elms, and remain there till April. Here are also found cherry-trees; plumb-trees; the vine∣gar tree, the fruit of which, being infused in wa∣ter, produces vinegar; an aquatic plant, called atoca, the fruit of which may be made into a con∣fection; the white thorn; the cotton-tree, on the top of which grow several tufts of flowers, which, when shaken in the morning, before the dew falls off, produce honey that may be boiled up into su∣gar, the seed being a pod, containing a very fine kind of cotton; the sun-plant, which resembles a marigold, and grows to the height of seven or
<PB N="260" REF="2590"/>
eight feet; Turkey corn; French beans; gourds melons; cappillaire; and the hop-plant.</P>
<P>Canada, while possessed by the French, exclusive of Louisiana, was divided into the provinces of Canada Proper, and Sanguenay; the former of which, lying towards the south-west, was subdi¦vided into thirteen districts; and the latter, lying towards the north east, into six; all, or most of them, taking their names from the principal settle¦ments or forts in them.</P>
<P>Canada Proper, before the late war, was said to be inhabited by an hundred and eighty thousand French, who lived in affluence, being free from all taxes, and having full liberty to hunt, fish, fel¦timber for fuel or building, and to sow and plan as much land as they could cultivate. Their great hardship was the winter cold, which is there s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excessive from December to April, that the greates<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rivers are frozen over, and the snow lies common¦ly two or three feet deep on the ground, though I extends no farther north than 48°. of latitude.</P>
<P>The principal places in this province are Mon¦treal and Trois Rivieres.</P>
<P>The former stands on an island in the river S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Laurence, which is ten leagues in length, and al¦most four in breadth, at the foot of a mountain which gives name to it, about half a league from the south shore. While the French were in possession of Canada, both the city and island of Montre belonged to private proprietors, who had im¦proved them so well, that the whole island we become a most delightful spot, and produce every thing that could administer to the con¦veniencies of life. The town, since it hath been in the hands of the English, hath suffered ex¦tremely by fires. When reduced by general An herst, it was of an oblong form, well peoples
<PB N="261" REF="2600"/>
and surrounded by a wall, flanked with eleven re∣doubts, which served instead of bastions. The streets were well laid out, and the houses built in a very handsome manner. The ditch was about eight feet deep, and of a proportionable breadth, but dry. Here was also a fort or citadel, the bat∣teries of which commanded the streets of the town, from one side of it to the other. These fortifications have been much improved by the English. The town itself is divided into two parts, the upper and the lower; in the last the merchants and men of business generally reside. Here likewise, before the peace, was the place of arms, the royal magazines, and the nunnery hospital. The upper town, howe∣ver, contained the principal buildings; such as the palace of the governor, the houses of the chief of∣ficers, the convent of Recollects, the Jesuit's church and seminary, the free-school, and the parish church. The governor's palace is a large fine building. Be∣sides a general hospital, the neighbourhood of this city contains many elegant villas; and all the ve∣getables of Europe grow in it. In short, when it fell into the hands of the English, all the banks of the river from thence to Quebec, were but one continued village, adorned with fine plantations, and gentlemen's seats at proper distances. The inland trade of this town and the rest of Canada, while they were possessed by the French, were with the Indian natives: they sent to the West-Indies racoon, fox, and beaver fur, skins of deer, and other branches of the peltry trade; and Indian corn, with what they call lumber, or wood. Their wine, brandy, cloth, linen, and wrought iron, came from Europe; and the native Indians took from them toys and trinkets of all kinds, duffil blankets, guns, powder, ball, kettles, hatchets, tomohawks, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>randy, and tobacco. There was then a species of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aders called coureurs des bois, who carried on a
<PB N="262" REF="2610"/>
trade with rations unknown to all the world besides, In June a fair was held at Montreal, to which In∣dians resorted from the distance of a thousand miles, with peltry, and other Indian commodities; and the French from all parts of Canada. This fair sometimes lasted for three months. The resort of savage nations to it was incredible; and great dis∣orders and tumults often happened; the Indians being so fond of brandy, that they sometimes for a dram gave the coureurs des bois all they had in the world. In the neighbourhood of the island, on which the town stands, is a great number of others, particularly that called the Isle of Jesus, which is about eight leagues in length, and two in breadth. There are also several lakes; among others that of St. Louis, and that formed by the opening of the river des Outaouais, or the Great River, into the river St. Laurence. On the banks of the last of these rivers likewise, not far from Mon∣treal, are two villages of Iroquois Christians; one called Sault St. Louis, and the other La Montaigne.</P>
<P>The town called Trois Rivieres, or the Three Rivers, has its name from three rivers, which join their currents about a quarter of a mile below it, and fall into the great one of St. Laurence. It is much resorted to by several nations that come down those rivers to it, and trade with it in various kinds of furs; and the country about it is pleasant, and fertile in corn, fruits, &amp;c. A great number of handsome houses stand on both sides the rivers. This town gives name to a district, and stands about thirty leagues up the river St. Laurence from Quebec.</P>
<P>The other places of most note in this province are Gaspé, St. Jean Isle, Miscou Isle, Richelieu Isles, Isle Conti, St. Francois, Notre Dame des Ang<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, St. Alexis, St. Michael, St. Joseph, Forts Frontenac, Niagara, near which is the famous fall, Fort Detroit, Michilachimenac, and many others.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="2620"/>
The province of Seguinay takes its name from the river so called, which issues from the lake of St. John, and falls into that of St. Laurence at Ta∣doussae, about thirty leagues below Quebec. This river is the boundary of the province on that side.</P>
<P>Quebec, the capital, not only of this province but of all Canada, and an episcopal see, is situated at the confluence of the rivers St. Lawrence and St. Charles, or the Little River; and on the north side of the former, near Cape Diamond, about one hundred and forty leagues from the sea, or from Cape Rose or Rosieres. The river St. Lawrence here is not above a mile in breadth, though not less than four or five leagues between it and the Isle of Orleans. It is built on a rock, partly of marble and partly of slate. The haven, which lies opposite the town, is safe and commodious, and about five fathom deep. Before the city was taken by the English, it is said to have made a ve∣ry fine appearance. Among the principal edifices were, the episcopal palace; the cathedral; the fort or citadel, which was the residence of the governor-ge∣neral; the house and church of the Recollects; the church of the Urseline nuns, in which is the tomb of Monsieur Montcalm, who commanded the French, and was killed at the battle of Quebec, in which also fell that young hero Wolfe, who commanded the English; the sumptuous college of the Jesuits; the intendant's house, the king's magazines, &amp;c. The city is divided into the upper and lower, and was well fortified when the English laid siege to it. The fort or citadel stands on the brink of the rock, and is a fine work: a pretty large espla∣nade, and a gentle declivity, the whole making a very fine platform, lies between the fort and the summit of Cape Diamond. About half a quar∣ter of a league towards the country lies the Hospi∣tal-General, which is the finest house in all Canada.
<PB N="$64" REF="2630"/>
The harbour is flanked by two bastions, that are raised twenty-five feet from the ground, which is about the height of the tides at the time of the equinox. In short, the fortifications of Quebec, at the time it was taken by the English, were as complete as the best engineers in the world could render them; and if it had not been for the amazing good fortune, and the more amazing in∣trepidity, of the British troops, they might have bid defiance to all the power of Europe. When Charlevoix was at Quebec, he reckoned the inha∣bitants not to exceed seven thousand; but they were certainly above double that number, when it was conquered by the English.</P>
<P>About three leagues from Quebec, before the war, was a most awful place of retirement, which excited in all who approached it, sentiments of reverence and sacred horror, which were more increased by the company of its inhabitants, who were Hurons, or wild Indians, converted to Chris∣tianity, simple in their manners, and fervid in their devotions, though of a tribe the fiercest and most untractable of all the American sa∣vages. They had a chapel built upon the same model as that of the famous holy house of Lo∣retto in Italy, and therefore it was called the Huron village of Loretto. Between Quebec and Mon∣treal, in sailing up the river St. Laurence, the eye is entertained with beautiful landscapes, the banks being in many places very bold and steep, and shaded with lofty trees, and in others crowd∣ed with villages, of which there are also many on the islands, wherewith the channel of the river is in∣terspersed. After passing the Richlieu islands, the air becomes so mild and temperate, that the travel∣ler thinks himself transported into another climate. Of the other places in this province, the most con∣siderable are Silleri, Tadoussac, Port-Neuf, Beau-Port,
<PB N="26$" REF="2640"/>
St. Anne, St. Nicholas, Port-Cartier, Che∣cheque dec and Necouba.</P>
<P>The different tribes of Indians in Canada are al∣most innumerable. It is not our intention, nor indeed in our power, to trace out all these; many of them are hardly known, even by name, to Eu∣ropeans. Some of them, mentioned in the most early accounts, are now not to be found; for those barbarians often carry on wars to the extermina∣tion of one another. The most considerable tribes at present are, the Iroquois, the Hurons, Miamis, Nokes, Oumamis, Outagamis, Sakis, Illinois, Ou∣baches, Otters or Loutres, Savannois, Sioux, Assini∣boils, and Christinaux. The last seven live to∣wards the north-west, about the rivers Missouri and Oubache, and about Lake Superior, and Assini∣boil. To the north of the island of Montreal the country is thinly peopled; but a few villages be∣longing to the old inhabitants are to be met with, among which are those belonging to the Nepis∣sings, so called from a lake of that name, who are the true descendants of the Algonquins, and still preserve the purity of that language. The French established some ports on the banks of Lake Supe∣rior, where they traded with the Christinaux and Assiniboils. In short, a traveller can know very little more of this country than a man may learn by an inspection of the map. He may wander one thousand miles on the banks of the finest lakes and rivers in the world, without meeting with a human creature; and those he does meet with are generally so stupid, so cruel, so barbarous, or shy, that they scarcely deserve that denomination. Most of them appear to be void of all notions of agriculture, and subsist by fishing and hunting; and they daily decrease in populousness, though they commonly allow themselves a plurality of wives: few of their tribes contain above six thousand
<PB N="266" REF="2650"/>
souls, and many of them, not two thousand. These barbarians are cloathed chiefly with skins, but in different forms: those who are most admired and esteemed among them, and consequently have the greatest authority, are such as distinguish themselves either as hunters or warriors. They are all very su∣perstitious, most of them having confused notions of a good and evil genius, and believing the sun to be the great Divinity of the world. Many of them also believe transmigration, and that the deceased are fond of the same exercises and enjoyments in the other world that gave them delight in this.</P>
<P>In all the vast extent of Canada, there are but three radical or mother tongues, the Siouse, the Algonquin, and Huron. As to the first, it is impossible to say, how far it extends; and neither French nor English are much acquainted with those who speak it. By an acquaintance with the other two, a man may travel fifteen hundred leagues in this country without an interpreter; for though he may visit above a hundred different nations, each of which has a particular idiom, yet he can make himself understood by all; even among the Indians of New England and Virginia. The Siouse, as far as the Europeans are acquainted with it, is rather a hissing than an articulation of words; but the Huron language has great energy, pathos, and elevation, and the Algonquin excels in smoothness and elegance.</P>
<P>By the capitulation granted to the French, when this country was reduced, both individuals and com∣munities are intitled to all their former rights and privileges: the Roman Catholic is still to con∣tinue the established religion, but the king of Great-Britain succeeds to all the powers and prerogatives of which his most Christian majesty was possessed. Since Canada became a colony of Great Britain, it
<PB N="276" REF="2660"/>
has been divided into the three governments of Quebec, Montreal, and Trois Rivieres.</P>
<P>The French, before the late war broke out, it is said, imported from Canada, including Louisiana, in beaver, seventy-five thousand pounds; in other furs, forty thousand pounds; in deer skins, twenty thousand pounds; total a hundred and thirty-five thousand pounds; while the English, in the same articles, imported only to the amount of about ninety thousand pounds.</P>

<HEAD>NOVA SCOTIA.</HEAD>
<P>Nova Scotia, or New Scotland, by the French called Acadie, is bounded by the Bay of St. Law∣rence and the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by the same ocean, and New England to the south; by the River St. Lawrence, on the north; and by Canada on the west; being computed to be five hundred miles in length, and four hundred in breadth. It had the name of Nova Scotia from Sir William Alexander, a Scotchman, and secre∣tary to king James I. who had the first grant of lands in it.</P>
<P>By the twelfth article of the treaty of Utrecht, all the province of Nova Scotia, or L'Acadie, with all its antient boundaries; also the city of Port-Royale, now called Annapolis Royal, with all its dependencies in lands, islands, and other par∣ticulars, together with the dominion, property, and possession of the said islands, lands, and other rights, by treaty or otherwise obtained, was ceded in per∣petuity to the crown of Great-Britain. To this was subjoined an exclusion of the subjects of France from fishing on the coast of Nova Scotia, or within thirty leagues, beginning from Cape Sable, and stretching along to the south-west. A regiment was then sent over to take possession of Annapolis,
<PB N="268" REF="2670"/>
the capital, but no provision was made to plant the rest of Nova-Scotia, till the year 1749, when about three thousand English families, under the command of governor Cornwallis, were sent thi∣ther, and erected the town of Halifax, in Che∣bucto Bay, and since that several other embarka∣tions have been made. In the late war, one of the disputes between Great-Britain and France was about the boundaries of Nova-Scotia, which the British commissaries demonstrated to extend to the river St. Lawrence on the north, by several treaties between the two nations: whereas the French in∣sisted, that only part of the peninsula was ceded to Great Britain; but it is to be hoped, this dispute hath been finally decided by the event of the last war. As the French, who were settled in Nova-Scotia, without regarding the oaths they had taken to the king of Great Britain, had constantly ad∣hered to France, it was thought fit, upon the last reduction of it, to remove them from thence, and disperse them in the rest of the British plantations.</P>
<P>Writers differ no less about the quality than the extent of this country; some describing it as scarce fit for the residence of the most barbarous savages, while others extol its fertility. Baron La Honton, a French writer of credit, many years resident in the country, tells us, that it abounds with little rivers, the entrance of which affords anchorage for the largest vessels, that they are full of salmon, and that most of the gulphs and rivers, with which they communicate, yield great plenty of cod. He further observes, that almost every part of Acadia produces, or is capable of pro∣ducing, corn, fruit, pease, and other pulse; that the four seasons of the year are easily distinguished; that the winter is very severe for three months; that the country yields excellent timber for masts;
<PB N="269" REF="2680"/>
and, upon occasion, for building any kind of ship∣ping. The baron also affirms, that Nova-Scotia is admirable for hunting, and speaks of it, in general, as a fine country, the air pure and salubrious, the climate tolerably moderate, and the water light and pellucid. With this gentleman the intelligent Charlevoix agrees, alledging it abounds with all the necessaries of life, and that the inhabitants may live very comfortably without much fatigue. Here is abundance of feathered game, such as par∣tridges, ducks, teal, widgeons, and bustard; the latter flock in such crowds to the banks of the rivers, and all the ponds, in the month of April, that their eggs alone are sufficient to subsist the inhabitans for that season; and yet, notwithstand∣ing the extraordinary consumption of these eggs, it is not perceivable that the species is diminished. At the close of March the fish begin to spawn, when they enter the rivers in such shoals as are incredible. Herrings come up in April, and the sturgeon and salmon in May. Here are also mul∣titudes of deer, beaver, otters, and some other quadrupeds, highy valued for their furs; and one of the finest cod fisheries in the world upon the coast. Though the winters are severe, yet they are very supportable, in consequence of the great plenty of fuel; and as the timber is not only fit for building, but also yields pitch and tar, and the soil is proper for hemp and flax, all manner of na∣val stores may be had here.</P>
<P>A great part of this country consists of the penin∣sula that is formed by the Bay of Fundy, Chenig∣to, and Green Bay; all the coast of which, from Cape Sable on the west, to Cape Canso on the east, is lined with shoals or sands. Besides the bays a∣bove-mentioned, there is a great number of others all along the coast, particularly those of Gaspé,
<PB N="270" REF="2690"/>
Chaleurs, and Chedibucto, on the north-east; the Bay of Islands, Chebucto, and La Here, on the south; and the Bay of Annapolis on the south side of the Bay of Fundy. In these bays, and other parts of the coast, are many fine roads and ha∣vens. The chief capes are those of Rosieres and Gaspé on the north-east; Capes Portage, Ecou∣menac, Tourmentin, Port, Epis, Fogery, and Can∣so, on the east; Capes Blanco, Vert, Theodore, Dore, la Heve, and Negro, on the south; Cape Sable, and Cape Fourche, on the south west. The rivers and lakes are very numerous. Of the for∣mer, the most considerable are those of St. John, Passamagnadi, Penobscot, and St. Croix, which run from north to south, and fall into the Bay of Fundy; and those of Risgouche, and Nipisiguit, which run from west to east, and fall into the Gulph of St. Laurence, and that of Chebucto, that falls into the Atlantic. Of the latter, those called Keseben and Freneuse are very large; but there are many that have not yet received any particular names. As to the tribes of Indians in Nova-Scotia, the most considerable, or at least those that are best known, are the Itchemins, Souriquois, and Mick∣macks.</P>
<P>The country is said to be divided into twelve districts, each of which annually elects a deputy, who must be approved by the governor and coun∣cil. This deputy is regarded as a kind of agent, or sollicitor for the district, who reports its situa∣tion, from time to time, to the government; but they have not yet, we believe, any legislative or executive power. The most considerable places in this infant colony are, Halifax, Annapolis, Canso, St. John's, Minnes, and Chenigto.</P>
<P>Halifax is situated on Chebucto Bay, having a communication with all parts of the province, either by land-carriage, the sea, or navigable ri∣vers,
<PB N="271" REF="2700"/>
with a fine harbour, where a small squadron of ships of war lies during the winter, and in sum∣mer puts to sea, under the command of a commo∣dore, for the protection of the fishery, and to see that the articles of the late peace relating thereto are duly observed by the French. The river Chi∣bucto is three miles broad at the town, near which is a small town called Dartmouth, a Dutch town, with an extensive common, corn fields, and conve∣niencies for drying and curing fish. The number of the inhabitants is said to be about ten or twelve thousand, who live very comfortably by the trade they carry on in furs and naval stores, and by their fisheries. Here the governor and council resides, and a considerable garrison is kept. The town is also well fortified. The present governor is lord Wil∣liam Campbell, third son of his grace the duke of Argyle.</P>
<P>Annapolis stands on the east side of the Bay of Fundy. Though but a small place, it has a noble harbour, capable of containing a thousand vessels at anchor, in the utmost security. Here also is a fort and garrison.</P>
<P>St. John's is a new settlement at the mouth of a ri∣ver of that name that falls into the Bay of Fundy on the west side.</P>
<P>Canso is situated on an island at the east end of the peninsula, near the Strait of Fronsac, which divides Nova-Scotia from Cape Breton. It may in time become a place of importance, on account of the excellent fishery in its neighbourhood, espe∣cially as the French have it not in their power now, as formerly, to disturb the fisheries, and encroach on the territories of the province, which has a prospect of enjoying peace many years, if it is not inter∣rupted by the Indians.</P>
<P>Les Mines or Minnes, and Chenigto, lie to∣wards the bottom of the Bay of Fundy, on the east side, but are inconsiderable.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="2710"/>
The most valuable appendage of Nova-Scotia is the Cape Sable Coast, along which is one continued range of cod-fishing banks, and excellent harbours, though the impenetrable fogs, which for one part of the year obscure this country, render it of less utility to commerce and navigation.</P>

<HEAD>NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>New-England, comprehending the colonies of Massachusets Bay, New-Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Providence Plantation, is situ∣ated between 67 and 73°. of west longitude, and between 41 and 45°. of north latitude; bound∣ed by Canada on the north-west; by Nova-Scotia or Acadia on the north-east; by the Atlantic O∣cean on the east and south; and by the province of New-York on the west; being three hundred miles long, and from one hundred to two hundred broad.</P>
<P>In New-England the summer is warm, but of short duration. For the space of two months the sky is perfectly clear, which renders the country so healthy, that it is reported to agree better with British constitutions than any other of the Ameri∣can provinces. The winters are long and severe, the wind often boisterous, and the air extremely sharp, but not intolerable. Naturalists ascribe the early approach, the length and severity of the win∣ters, to the large fresh-water lakes lying to the north-west of New-England, which being con∣stantly frozen over from the beginning of Novem∣ber to June or July, occasion those piercing winds which prove so fatal to mariners on this coast. Towards the sea the land is generally low, and frequently marshy; but as you advance into the country, it rises into hills, and on the north-east becomes altogether rocky and mountainous. Round
<PB N="273" REF="2720"/>
Massachuset's Bay the soil is black, and rich as in any part of England; and the first planters found the grass above a yard high, but rank, for want of mowing. The uplands are less fruitful, being for the most part a mixture of sand and gravel, in∣clining to clay.</P>
<P>The fruits of Old-England come to great perfection here, particularly peaches and apples. Here are also all kinds of esculent plants, pulse, and corn; but Indian corn or maiz, which the natives call weachin, is the most cultivated, and was the only kind known on the first arrival of the Europeans. This corn is of several colours, red, white, yellow, black, green, &amp;c. and the diversity frequently appears not only in the same field, but in the very same ear, though white and yellow are the most common. Each ear, at a medium, pro∣duces about two hundred and forty grains, which is an astonishing increase. This corn the Indians boil till it is tender, and eat with fish, fowl, or flesh, as bread. Sometimes they bruise it in mortars, and then boil it; but the most usual method is to dry the corn high, without burning it, then to beat it in mortars into fine meal, and sift it, which the Indi∣ans either eat dry, or mixed with water. The English bake it in the same manner as flour; but the best food made from it is called samsi, be∣ing steeped in water for near half an hour, beat in a mortar, then sifted, boiled, and eaten with milk, or butter and sugar, like rice, which is not only an agreeable, but a wholesome strengthening diet. The English also brew good strong been from it.</P>
<P>New-England abounds in excellent timber, oak, ash, pine, fir, cedar, elm, cypress, beech, walnut, chesnut, hazel, sassafras, samach, and other woods used in dying or tanning leather, carpenters work, and ship-building; yet such was the destruction
<PB N="274" REF="2730"/>
made in the forests, that a law passed to prevent the waste of woods, by inflicting penalties on those who cut down trees of a certain kind, before they were arrived at a specified growth and age. The oaks here are said to be inferior to those of Old-England; but the firs are of a prodigious bulk, and furnish the royal navy of England with masts and yards; and they draw from these and other trees, pitch, tar, rosin, turpentine, gums, and balm: the soil also producing hemp and flax, a ship may be built and rigged out with the produce thereof; and ship building is actually a considerable em∣ployment in this country.</P>
<P>There is no where a greater abundance and va∣riety of fowl than in New-England; as geese, ducks, turkies, hens, partridges, wigeons, swans, herons, heathcocks, pigeons, &amp;c. nor is the fea∣thered kind in greater plenty than the quadrupeds, more immediately necessary to human subsistence and convenience. All kinds of European cattle thrive here, and multiply exceedingly: the horses of the province are hardy, mettlesome, and ser∣viceable, but small. Here are also elks, deer, hares, rabbits, squirrels, beavers, otters, monkies, racoons, sables, bears, wolves, foxes, ounces, and a variety of other tame and wild quadrupeds; some of which are imported into Great-Britain as foreign curiosities. But the most extraordinary of these animals is the mose, or moose deer; the black species of which, Mr. Josselin tells us, is about twelve feet high, with four horns, and broad palms, some distant near twelve feet from the tip of one horn to the other. His body is about the size of a bull; his neck resembles a stag's; his tail is somewhat longer; and his flesh extremely grateful. The light coloured moose, called wampoon by the Indians, is of a smaller stature, and much more common than the black The rattle-snake is ano∣ther natural curiosity of New-England, though not
<PB N="275" REF="2740"/>
peculiar to it. Its length is about four or five feet' and its poison mortal in a few hours, unless proper remedies are applied; but it seldom attacks any human creature, without provocation.</P>
<P>The seas round New England, as well as its ri∣vers, abound with fish, and even whales of several kinds, viz. the whale-bone whale, the spermaceti whale, which yields ambergrease, the fin-back∣ed whale, the scrag whale, and the bunch whale, of which they take great numbers, and send besides some ships every year to fish for whales in Greenland. The bone of the New-England whale, however, is said to be too brittle, and not so serviceable as that of Greenland. A terrible creature, called the whale-killer, from twenty to thirty feet long, with strong teeth and jaws, persecutes the whale in these seas; but afraid of his monstrous strength, they seldom attack a full grown whale, or indeed a young one, but in companies of ten or twelve.</P>
<P>The principal rivers here are Connecticut, Thames, Patuxet, Merrimack, Piscataqua, Saco, Casco, Kennebeck, Penobscot, or Pentagonet. The most remarkable bays and harbours are those formed by Plymouth, Rhode Island, and Provi∣dence Plantations; Monument Bay; West Har∣bour, formed by the bending of Cape Cod; Boston harbour; Piscataqua; and Casco bay. The chief capes are Cape Cod, Marble Head, Cape Anne, Cape Netick, Cape Porpus, Cape Elizabeth, and Cape Small Point.</P>
<P>The trade of New-England consists of various articles. At the mouth of the river Penobscot there is a mackarel fishery, from which the inha∣bitants supply Barbadoes, and other British islands in America. They likewise fish for cod in winter, which they dry in the frost. Their salt works are upon the improving hand; and, it is said, they will soon have salt enough to serve themselves. Rich mines of iron, of a most excellent kind and temper,
<PB N="276" REF="2750"/>
have been discovered in New-England, and, if im∣proved, in a short time they may supply Great-Britain, without having recourse to the northern nations for that commodity; especially as the par∣liament, to encourage the undertaking, allows both pig and bar iron to be imported duty-free. Besides mackarel and cod, they send to Surinam and Curassou belonging to the Dutch, and to Bar∣badoes and the other British islands, biscuit, meal, salt, provisions, sometimes cattle and horses, planks, hoops, shingles, pipe-staves, butter, cheese, grain, oil, tallow, turpentine, bark, calf-skins, tobacco, apples, cyder, and onions; and of these merchan∣dizes Barbadoes takes annually to the value of an hundred thousand pounds sterling. From Barba∣does, and those other islands, they bring in return sugar, cotton, ginger, and various other commo∣dities. From Europe they import wine, silks, woollen cloth, toys, hardware, linen, ribbands, stuffs, laces, paper, houshold furniture, husbandry tools of all kinds, cord ge, hats, stockings, shoes, and In∣dia goods, to the value of above four hundred thou∣sand pounds sterling. In short, there is no British manufacture that serves the purpose of luxury or ornament, which the people of New-England do not import. They also send ships to the Bay of Honduras for logwood, which they transport to Europe; as they do sugar from the West-Indies, and fish from Newfoundland. Their money is chiefly paper-currency, or what they call province∣buls, which is attended with many inconveniencies. The two last wars with France and Spain intro∣duced abundance of hard money.</P>
<P>Their inland trade, besides masts, yards, and provisions of all kinds, consists chiefly of furs, and the skins of beavers and martens. The furs and skins are brought in by the Indians, especially those on the rivers Penobscot and St. John; the former
<PB N="277" REF="2760"/>
bringing bear and elk skins, and the latter beaver and otter skins. Both also send in marten skins; those of the former, one year with another, three thousand, and those of the latter double that number. Before the year 1743, their shipping is said to have con∣sisted of a thousand sail, besides fishing smacks. Ship-building, as we noted above, is likewise very advantageous to this colony, and continually in∣creases with their trade.</P>
<P>Their manufactures are chiefly coarse linen, and woollen cloth for their own use, hats, paper, sugar∣baking, and distilling. The disputes that have, for some time, unhappily subsisted between Great-Bri∣tain and her colonies, have put them upon attempt∣ing to supply themselves with other manufactures, with a view to compel the mother country to yield to their demands: but they ought to be very cau∣tious how they provoke the government and par∣liament of Great-Britain, as it would be easy for these, without landing a single man upon the con∣tinent, to bring them into the most deplorable situ∣ation, by ruining their trade; though, it must be owned, this could not be done without at the same time hurting the mother country.</P>
<P>With regard to religion, before the year 1740, the province of Massachuset's Bay contained above one hundred English congregations, besides thirty assemblies of Indian Christians; but of all these congregations, not above three or four followed the forms of the church of England. Every par∣ticular society among them is independent of all other ecclesiastical jurisdiction; nor does there lie any appeal from their punishments or censures. Their church government admits of synods; but those synods have no power to enforce their own acts, or to establish any thing coercive. All they can do is to deliberate on general matters, which are to be laid before the several churches, who have
<PB N="278" REF="2770"/>
power to reject or approve of them, as they see proper. The magistrates have power to call a sy∣nod upon any particular exigency, and even to give their opinion in it. The ministers of Boston de∣pend entirely on the generosity of their hearers for support; a voluntary contribution being made for them, by the congregation, every time di∣vine service is celebrated. Every town of fifteen families is obliged to maintain a school for reading and writing, and, of an hundred families, a gram∣mar school, for the instruction of youth; besides which, there are four colleges. They have no holidays, but that of the annual election of the magistrates of Boston, and the commencement at Cambridge. Though the independents who first transported themselves hither, rather than conform to the church of England, complained of the go∣vernment here for not allowing a toleration, yet they permitted no other sect or denomination of Christians but themselves, to have any share of the governments they erected there; and were so far from allowing a toleration to those that differed from them, that they hanged several quakers. It is not long since they suffered any member of the church of England to have a share in the ma∣gistracy, or to be elected a member of the com∣mons, or house of representatives; and there are not more than two or three admitted at this day into their councils. Those of the church of Eng∣land do not amount to a fourth part of the inhabi∣tants of this colony.</P>
<P>With respect to the government of New-Eng∣land, it is observed by Mr. Dummer, that by the new charter granted to the Massachusets by king William III. the appointment of a governor, lieu¦tenant governor, secretary, and all the officers of the admiralty, is vested in the crown; that the power of the militia is wholly in the hands of the
<PB N="279" REF="2780"/>
governor, as captain-general; that all judges, justices, and sheriffs, to whom the execution of the law is intrusted, are nominated by the governor, with the advice of the council; and that the go∣vernor has a negative on the choice of counsellors, peremptory and unlimited; and that he is not obliged to give a reason for what he does in this particular, or restrained to any number; that au∣thentic copies of the several acts passed by this co∣lony, as well as others, ought to be transmitted to the court of England for the royal approbation; but if the laws of this colony are not repealed within three years after they are presented, they are not repealable by the crown after that time; and that no laws, ordinances, elections of ma∣gistrates, or acts of government whatsoever, are valid, without the governor's consent in writing.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this, the people have still the greatest share of the power in this colony; for they not only chuse the assembly, but this assembly, with the governor's concurrence, chuse the coun∣cil, equivalent to our house of lords: but whe∣ther the governor still depends on the assembly, as he did not many years ago, for his annual support, we cannot say; it is probable he does not, other∣wise Sir Francis Barnard, the late governor, would have been obliged to study popularity more than he did.</P>
<P>There were originally three sorts of governments established by the English on the continent of America, viz. royal governments, charter govern∣ments, and proprietary governments.</P>
<P>A royal government is properly so called, be∣cause the colony is immediately dependent on the crown, and the king remains sovereign of the co∣lony: he appoints the governor, council, and officers of state, and the people only elect the re∣presentatives, as in England: such are the govern∣ments
<PB N="280" REF="2790"/>
of Virginia, New-Hampshire, New-York, New-Jersey, and both Carolinas; though the Ca∣rolinas were once proprietary governments.</P>
<P>A charter government is so called because the company, incorporated by the king's charter, were in a manner vested with sovereign authority, to establish what sort of government they saw fit; and these charter governments have generally thought fit to transfer their authority to the popu∣lace; for in these governments, or rather corpora∣tions, the freemen do not only chuse their repre∣sentatives, but annually chuse their governor, coun∣cil, and magistrates, and make laws, without the concurrence, and even without the knowledge of the king; and are under no other restraint than this, that they enact no laws contrary to the laws of England; if they do, their charters are liable to be forfeited. Such are the governments of Rhode-Island and Connecticut, in New-England, and such was that of the Massachusets formerly; but from what has been said above, it appears now to be different from, or rather a mixture of, both.</P>
<P>The third kind of government is the proprietary, properly so called, because the proprietor is invest∣ed with sovereign authority: he appoints the go∣vernor, council, and magistrates, and the repre∣sentatives are summoned in his name, and by their advice he enacts laws, without the concurrence of the crown; but, by a late statute, the proprietor must have the king's consent in the appointing a governor, when he does not reside in the planta∣tion in person, and of a deputy-governor, when he does; and all the governors of the plantations are liable to be called to an account for mal-adminis∣tration by the court of King's Bench. The only proprietary governments now in being are those of Maryland and Pensylvania.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="2800"/>
The general assembly of New-England, in con∣currence, impose taxes, makes grants, enacts laws, and redresses public grievances of every kind. It consists of the magistrates, and a certain number of representatives, who form two chambers, so nearly resembling our lords and commons, that the concurrence of the majority of both is necessary before any bill can be presented to the governor for his assent. Every town, if it contains thirty∣two burgesses, can send two representatives to par∣liament; if twenty, one; but Boston nominates four.</P>
<P>The laws of the greatest consequence in this colo∣ny are those specified by Mr. Dummer. "There has been (says he) from the beginning, an office erected by law in every county, where all conveyances of land are entered at large, after the granters have ac∣knowledged them before a justice of peace; by which means no person can sell his estate twice, or take up more money upon it than it is worth. Provision has likewise been made for the security of life and property, in the election, of juries, who are not returned by the sheriff of the county, but are chosen by the inhabitants of the towns; and this election is under the exactest regulation that human prudence can suggest for preventing cor∣ruption." The same author observes, "That sheriffs in the Plantations are comparatively but little officers, and therefore not to be trusted like ours. Redress in the New-England courts of law is very quick and cheap, all processes are in English, and no special pleadings or demurrers are admitted; but the general issue is always given, and special matters brought in evidence, which saves time and expence; and in this case a man is not liable to lose his estate for a defect in form, nor is the merits of the cause made to depend on the niceties of clerkship. By a law of the coun∣try,
<PB N="282" REF="2810"/>
no writ may be abated for a circumstantial er∣ror, such as a slight misnomer, or any informality; and by another law it is enacted, that every at∣torney taking out a writ from the clerk's office shall indorse his surname upon it, and be liable to pay the adverse party his costs and charges, in case of non-prosecution and discontinuance, or that the plaintiff be non suited, or judgment past against him: and it is provided in the same act, that if the plaintiff shall suffer a nonsuit by the attorney's mislaying the action, he shall be obliged to draw a new writ without a fee, in case the party should see fit to receive the suit. For the quicker dispatch of causes, declarations are made parts of the writ, in which the case is particularly set forth. If it be a matter of accompt, the accompt is annexed to the writ, and copies of both left with the de∣fendant, which being done fourteen days before the sitting of the court, he is obliged to plead di∣rectly, and the issue is then tried. Nor are the people of New-England oppressed with the infi∣nite delays and expence that attend proceedings in Chancery. But as in all other countries, England only excepted, <HI>jus</HI> and <HI>oequum</HI> are held the same, and never divided; so it is here, a power of chancery being vested in the judges of the courts of com∣mon law as to some particular cases, and they make equitable constructions in others. The fees of officers of all sorts are settled by acts of assembly at moderate prices."</P>
<P>The laws here are very severe against quakers. To bring one in, is a forfeiture of an hundred pounds; to conceal one, forty shillings an hour; to go to a quaker's meeting, ten shillings; to preach there, five shillings. If a quaker be not an inhabitant he is subject to banishment, and if he returns, death. Vagrant quakers to be whipped, branded with the letter R on the left
<PB N="283" REF="2820"/>
shoulder, and banished; if they return, death. No person can be arrested, if there are any means of satisfaction; nor imprisoned, unless there be a concealment of effects. Adultery is death to both parties.</P>
<P>This, and some of the other colonies on the con∣tinent, have ventured of late to dispute the au∣thority of the parliament of Great-Britain to lay taxes upon them; and this, in particular, hath pro∣ceeded so far in their opposition, that the govern∣ment hath been obliged to order several regiments and ships of war to Boston, to enforce due respect and obedience to the legislature; but it is to be hoped, that these differences will soon be amicably adjusted.</P>
<P>More than twenty years ago it was computed, that New-England contained about three hundred thousand souls; of which about sixty thousand were effective men, from sixteen to sixty years of age: that of these, the Massachusets Bay in particular, contained thirty thousand; the colony of Connecticut, fourteen thousand; Rhode-Island, and Providence Plantation, seven thousand; New-Hampshire, five thousand; and the province of Maine, four thousand. Their militia forms a consi∣derable body of men; that of the Massachusets only consisting of six regiments of foot, and fifteen troops of horse, of an hundred men in each troop. In the year 1748, the colony of New-England raised, armed, and transported to Cape Breton four thousand men, who took Louisbourg, which proved an equivalent, at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, for all the successes of the French upon the continent of Europe; and in the late war they contributed considerably to that exten∣sion of territory in North-America, that will in time make the crown of Great-Britain, if it has not already, the most powerful of any in the world.
<PB N="284" REF="2830"/>
In the whole colony are twenty-seven fortified places, upon eleven navigable rivers; but the con∣quest of Canada, and the forts among the Indians, garrisoned by his majesty's troops, will render these less necessary than formerly.</P>
<P>The Massachusets colony received its name from the Indians, who inhabited these parts when the English first came hither. Its boundaries are, the colonies of Connecticut and New-York on the west; the ocean on the east and south; and Merri∣mack river on the north. It is subdivided into the provinces of Plymouth, Massachuset Proper, and Maine.</P>
<P>The province of Plymouth, which is the most southerly, runs along the coast an hundred miles, from Cape Cod to Cape Manchester; and is near fifty broad, from Monument Bay to Sectuati. It is divided into the counties of Bristol, Plymouth, and Barnstaple, taking their names from the chief towns of each, of which Bristol is large and po∣pulous, having a commodious harbour, and the best trade in New-England next to Boston.</P>
<P>On the coast of this province lie several other islands, particularly Rhode-Island, Elizabeth Island, Martha's or Martin's Vineyard, and Nantucket, in which are several towns or villages of christianized Indians.</P>
<P>Massachusets Proper is bounded by New-York on the west; by Plymouth and Connecticut on the south; New-Hampshire on the north; and by Massachusets Bay on the east, and contains the counties of Suffolk, Middlesex, and Essex, all of them situate on Massachusets Bay. The capi∣tals of those three counties are Boston, Cambridge, and Salem.</P>
<P>Boston is not only the chief town of the county of Middlesex, but of all New-England, and even
<PB N="285" REF="2840"/>
of the whole British empire in America. It stands on a peninsula at the bottom of Massachusets Bay, about eight miles from its mouth, and is well for∣tified. The approach to the harbour by shipping is narrow; but within it there is room enough for five hundred sail to lie at anchor, in a good depth of water. On one of the islands of the Bay stands Fort William, the most regular fortress in the British Plantations: no ship can approach the town, without passing directly under the guns of the fort. About two leagues from the city is a light-house, erected on a rock, which, in time of war, makes signals to the castle, and the castle to the town. At the bottom of the Bay, which is spacious enough to contain the whole royal navy, is a pier, near two thousand feet in length, with a row of merchants warehouses on the north side. The city lies in the shape of a half-moon round the harbour, and is said to contain near thirty thousand inhabitants; being in length about two miles, and in some places near three quarters of a mile broad. Here are ten churches of all denominations, a fine town∣house, five printing-presses, and several booksellers shops. Here also the governor resides, the ge∣neral assembly and the chief courts of judicature are held, and here are transacted the affairs of the whole province. There is a market every Thurs∣day, and fairs for three days together, beginning on the first Tuesday in May, and the last Tuesday in October. Upon the whole, Boston is the most flourishing place of trade and commerce in Ame∣rica, above six hundred ships having been laden here in a year, for Europe and the British Planta∣tions, with lumber, beef, pork, fish, &amp;c. The neck of land which joins the peninsula on which the city is built to the continent, it is said, is not above forty yards wide.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="2850"/>
Cambridge stands on the north branch of Charles River, six or seven miles north-west from Boston. Here is a sort of an university, consisting of two colleges, called Harvard College, and Sloughton Hall, which is pretty well endowed, and has a tolerable library, with a president, five fellows, and two professors, one of mathematics, and another of divinity.</P>
<P>Salem stands on a plain between two rivers, on each of which it has a harbour, eighteen miles north of Boston. It is noted for building ships, especially fishing-smacks, and drives a good trade to Barba∣does and the Sugar Islands.</P>
<P>The province of Maine, which constitutes the third province of the Massachusets colony, is but of a small extent, compared to the other two. The inland part of it is mountainous and barren, but near the coast and rivers it is tolerably fruitful in corn and pasture. New-York is the most con∣siderable place in it. There are several other consi∣derable towns in the Massachusets colony, be∣sides those we have mentioned.</P>
<P>The government of New-Hampshire is bounded by Kennebeck river on the east; Merrimack on the west; Massachusets Bay on the south-east; Canada on the north-west; and Nova-Scotia on the north-east. The most considerable towns in it are Portsmouth, Dover, Piscataqua, Exeter, and Hampton, all lying on the river Piscataqua. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in building of ships, and the fishery.</P>
<P>The colony of Connecticut is bounded on the west by New-York; by Rhode Island on the east, with part of the Massachusets colony, which last it has also on the north; and on the south is separated
<PB N="287" REF="2860"/>
from Long Island by an arm of the sea. It is said to be about one hundred miles in length, and about seventy in breadth. Connecticut River, which is one of the largest in New-England, runs through the heart of the province, and is navigable above forty miles for large vessels, and much farther for small ones. This colony abounds in metals, and naval stores, especially timber, and has many good ports. Upwards of forty years ago the inhabitants were computed at thirty thousand. The colony is divided into four counties, and its chief towns are Newhaven, Hertford, and New-London.</P>
<P>Newhaven stands upon the coast, and has a college for academical learning, called Yale Hall, pretty well endowed, and furnished with a good library.</P>
<P>Hertford is a handsome populous town, situated on the banks of Connecticut River.</P>
<P>New-London is a town of good trade, situated on the west side, and near the mouth of the river, called Thames.</P>
<P>The colony of Rhode-Island comprehends, be∣sides the island, a district on the continent, called Providence Plantation. The island, which is about fifteen or sixteen miles long, and about four or five broad, is called the Paradise of New-Eng∣land, for the fruitfulness of the soil, and the tem∣perateness of the climate. A great trade is carried on in it to the sugar-colonies with butter, cheese, horses, sheep, beef, pork, tallow, &amp;c. The chief town is Newport, situated on the south-west part of it, and having a good harbour, defended by a regular fort.</P>
<P>Providence Plantation, which lies opposite to Rhode Island, and is about twenty miles square, has two large thriving towns, near the mouth of
<PB N="288" REF="2870"/>
the river Patuxel; one of which is called Provi∣dence, and the other Warwick.</P>
<P>The colony of Rhode-Island took its rise in the following manner:</P>
<P>About the year 1639, it seems the presbyterians or independents at Boston were divided into two sects; one of which was for the covenant of grace, and the other for that of works. The latter of these being the most powerful, to convince their oppo∣nents of their love of good works, banished them from Boston; upon which, the other had the grace to go to Rhode Island, and lay the founda∣tion of a new settlement.</P>
<P>There was no attempt to settle New-England till the reign of king James I. who, by letters patent dated the 10th of April 1606, erected two compa∣nies, empowering them to send colonies to Virgi∣nia, as all the north-east coast of America was then called. One of those companies was called the Plymouth company, who for some time traded on∣ly with the natives of North-America, or New-Virginia, for furs, and fished upon the coast. About the year 1619, some dissenters of the inde∣pendent persuasion, who were uneasy at being re∣quired to conform to the church of England, hav∣ing purchased the Plymouth patent, and obtained another from King James to send colonies to North-Virginia, now New-England, embarked an hundred and fifty men on board a ship, which sailed from Plymouth the 6th of September 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod, in New-England, on the 9th of November following, where they built a town, by the name of New-Plymouth. The Indians were too much engaged in war among themselves to give these strangers any disturbance; and, luck∣ily for them, Massasoit, prince of the Massachusets nation, entered into an alliance, offensive and de∣fensive,
<PB N="289" REF="2880"/>
with the English, by whose assistance he hoped to make a conquest of the Narraganset na∣tion, with which he was then at war. He also consented to acknowledge the king of England for his sovereign, and made a cession of part of his country to the new planters: several other princes followed his example. Ships arriving every day with planters and provisions, the colony soon be∣came well established, when differences arising up∣on account of religion, had like to have been of very bad consequence. The independents, who were the most numerous, not allowing a toleration to any other sect or persuasion, several of the ad∣venturers removed to other parts of the country, and others returned home, whereby the colony was so weakened, that if the Indians had not been en∣gaged in a civil war, the English would infallibly have been driven out of the country. In the mean time, another set of adventurers purchased, in 1627, a grant of the Plymouth company of all that part of New-England which lies between the rivers Merimack and Charles, and, to strengthen their title, procured a grant of it from king Charles in 1628. This new company fitted out six ships, with three hundred planters, furnished with live cattle, and all manner of stores and provisions. In 1630 they built Boston, on the Massachusets Bay. The same year king Charles granted part of the county of Connecticut to the earl of Warwick, which was afterwards purchased of that earl by Wil∣liam lord viscount Say and Seale, Robert lord Brook, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Charles Fiennes, John Pym, and John Hampden, esquires, gentlemen at that time disaffected to the government, who de∣signed that plantation as a place of refuge, in case they had not succeeded in their opposition to king Charles; and they were once upon the point of transporting themselves thither with the chief of
<PB N="290" REF="2890"/>
their party, being in doubt whether they should carry their point in the senate: even Cromwell, it is said, was once on board, in order to have transported himself to New-England; and there appears to have been a proclamation published in 1627, prohibiting people to transport themselves without licence, whereby Cromwell, Sir Arthur Haselrig, Mr. Hampden, and several more, were prevented going; but prevailing afterwards against the crown, they sold their interest in those plan∣tations to others. Another set of adventurers planted New-Hampshire, and others, Providence and Rhode-Island; the last being chiefly composed of quakers, driven out of the Massachusets colony by the independents, who had long persecuted them, and even hanged some of them, for not conforming to their sect Thus all the provinces of New-England were planted and well peopled within the space of twenty years, reckoning from the arrival of the first colony at New-Plymouth, during which time they were very little interrupted by the Indians; but the English colony of Connecticut beginning to erect fortresses, and extend their settlements to the westward, without leave of the natives, the In∣dians were alarmed, apprehending they should in time be dispossessed of their country, and enslaved by these foreigners. The Sachem Metacomet therefore, to whom the English gave the name of Philip, the son of Massasoit, who first entered into alliance with the English, observing the danger his country was in, and that the English now no longer acted as allies, but tyrannized over his peo∣ple, and had in a manner deprived him of his au∣thority, dispatched messengers privately through all the tribes of the Indians, inviting them to take up arms in defence of their country, which they did, and succeeded in several engagements at first; but their prince Philip being killed by a musket∣shot,
<PB N="291" REF="2900"/>
the English at length prevailed. Great num∣bers of the Indians were massacred, and others were driven out of their country, and joined the French in Canada, who promising them protecton, and frequently assisting them in their inroads upon the British settlements, it is not to be wondered at, that they continued so much attached to the French, while they had any footing in North-America.</P>
<P>We shall here give some account of the Iroquois, the most powerful tribe of Indians in all North-America, and the most attached to the English. They are divided into many nations, of which five are more eminent than the rest, possess a large extent of country at the back of the colonies of New-Eng∣land, New-York, Pensylvania, and the Jerseys, about the lakes Ontario, Erie, and Huron. Each of them have a large village belonging to them, which are said to contain altogether about fourteen thou∣sand souls, that is, according to their way of reckon∣ing, fifteen hundred fighting men, two thousand old men, four thousand married women, two thou∣sand unmarried, and four thousand children. They speak much the same language, and form a kind of commonwealth; for a general assembly is held every year, composed of deputies from each na∣tion, where all matters that concern the whole bo∣dy are decided, and their union ratified by a ban∣quet, wherein they drink out of the cup, and smoke out of the calumet, of the Five Nations. The last of these, which is no other than a kind of pipe, the bowl of which is made of a soft red marble, and the stem of some kind of reed, of a good length, is looked upon by most of the Indian na∣tions in North-America as so sacred, that when a treaty, whether of peace or alliance, &amp;c. hath been solemnly ratified by the deputies of the respective nations smoaking out of it in their turns, the in∣fringement of it is accounted an act of the most
<PB N="292" REF="2910"/>
atrocious and dangerous nature, and such as can∣not fail to draw down the most dreadful punish∣ments upon the authors. Each nation hath its own calumet, which is commonly longer and larger, and more or less adorned with feathers, and other trinkets, according to their dignity or precedence. It is seldom or never used, but to ra∣tify leagues, treaties, and such like public acts.</P>
<P>When two nations are engaged in a war with one another, and one of them sends the calumet to the other, it may indeed be rejected; but if they accept of it, they are immediately obliged to lay down their arms on both sides, and come to a treaty; which, if agreed to, the pipe is lighted, and smoaked by the deputies; if not, it is sent back, and hostilities commenced.</P>
<P>They have some Indian corn and beans, as also water-melons, pompions, &amp;c. which are very large, sweet, and of a fine flavour; but they are too lazy to give themselves much trouble about cultivating the ground, and live chiefly by hunting and fish∣ing.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>NEW-YORK and the JERSEYS.</HEAD>
<P>New-York is bounded on the south and south∣west by Hudson's and Delaware rivers, which di∣vide it from the East and West Jerseys, and Pen∣sylvania; on the east and north-east by New-Eng∣land; and on the north-west by Canada. Its extent from north to south, that is from Sandy-Hook, in latitude 40°. 30′. to the supposed Canada line, in the parallel of 45°. is three hundred and thirteen English miles; but its extent from east to west is various, being in some places eighty-eight, in others one hundred, and in others stretching as far as Lake Erie, and from thence along Lake Erie, and the communicating great run of water from Lake Erie to the Lake Ontario, Oswego, or Ca∣taraqui,
<PB N="293" REF="2920"/>
and along that lake to the aforesaid Cana∣da's supposed line. Oswego Fort or trading place, situated upon the Lake Ontario, Cataraqui, or Os∣wego, in lat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. lies two hundred miles from Al∣bany to the north-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st; and Montreal lies north-by∣east of Albany above two hundred and twenty miles.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have Delaware river on the south and west; The Bay on the south-east; the Atlan∣tic Ocean on the east; and New-York on the north; extending in length, along the sea-coast and Hudson's river, from south to north, one hundred and forty miles; and about eighty where broadest. The south part of New-York and the Jerseys are low flat countries, and exceeding fertile; but as∣cending twenty or thirty miles up Hudson's river to the north, the country is rocky and mountainous, and covered with wood, where it has not been cleared by the planters. The air and seasons in these colonies are much the same as in New-England.</P>
<P>The chief rivers, besides those of Hudson and Delaware, are Mohawk river, Onandago, Raritan, and Maurice rivers. The extensive lakes of Cham∣plain, Ontario, and Erie, lie on the frontiers of the province of New-York to the north-west. The capes are those of Cape Mary, on the east en∣trance of Delaware river; Sandy Point, near the entrance of Raritan river; and Mountang Point, at the east end of Long-Island. That island, and another called Staten Island, belong to the pro∣vince of New-York. The first, which the Dutch call Nassau, is about one hundred and twenty miles long, from east to west; but no more than ten, at a medium, in breadth. The eastern part of it was settled from New-England; but two thirds of it is a barren sandy soil. Staten Island is about twelve miles in length and six in breadth, and is inha∣bited by Dutch and French, as well as English.

<PB N="294" REF="2950"/>
Tantucket or Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Elizabeth islands, formerly belonged to New-York; but were by the new charter of Massachusets Bay, granted at the Revolution, annexed to that colony.</P>
<P>As to the produce and commodities of New-York and the Jerseys, they consist of horses, pipe-staves; pork, beef, and fish, salted and barrelled up; oil of whales and sea-calves, skins and furs, iron and copper; all sorts of grain, as wheat, rye, pease, beans, oats, barley, buck-wheat, Indian corn, In∣dian pease, and beans; tobacco, pot-ashes, and wax, which they export to the West-Indian islands, not excepting the French and Dutch, and to Eng∣land, Old Spain, Africa, and Portugal; import∣ing, in return, rum, sugar, molasses, negroes, salt, and wine; and from Great-Britain, in particular, houshold goods, cloathing of all kinds, hardware, tools, and toys. They traffic also with the log∣wood-cutters in the Bay of Honduras, and with the Spanish settlements, exchanging the manufactures of Europe for treasure, which they send to England as merchandize. Their dried and salted fish are sent chiefly to Spain, Portugal, Italy, and other countries of Europe, whither they also send great quantities of timber. Their trade with the Indians consists but in a few articles: they receive of the natives chiefly skins and furs of their wild beasts, for which they give them cloathing, arms, ammu∣nition, rum, and other spirits, in return. The fa∣cility of the voyage from New-York to England, and the West-Indies, has been of infinite service; for, by the lowness of the freight, they purchase furs at a very cheap rate for strouds (a woollen ma∣nufacture established at Stroud in England) and other woollen goods, all which are sure of a ready vent with the Indians. Bristol is the chief place in England which the colonists of New-York trade
<PB N="295" REF="2960"/>
with; and they generally perform two voyages in a year with so much safety, that the insurance upon shipping, in time of peace, is no more than two per cent. Near twenty years ago, it was computed that the imports of this colony from England amounted annually to about an hundred and fifty thousand pounds. All kinds of black cattle are more numerous here than in any European coun∣try; and they have a breed of excellent horses. The Jerseys, both East and West, are also in a very flourishing condition. Their paper currency, which several years ago amounted to upwards of sixty thousand pounds, has more credit than that of ei∣ther Pensylvania or New-York; for the Pensylva∣nia bills are not received at New-York, nor those of New-York at Pensylvania, but the New-Jersey bills circulate through both these provinces. Be∣fore the peace of Utrecht, the inhabitants of the Jerseys were computed at sixteen thousand; but at present they amount to near seventy thousand. They are excellent corn countries; and, it is said, produce more wheat than any of the other colo∣nies, of which, and other grain, they dispose of con∣siderable quantities to New-York and Pensylvania. By employing negroes, as their neighbours do, in cultivating the lands, they have of late more than doubled their value; and they now work a copper mine, and manufacture iron ore into pigs and bars. They likewise raise some flax and hemp.</P>
<P>New York and the Jerseys, as we observed al∣ready, are royal governments. That of New York is administered by a governor, who has his commission under the broad seal of England. The legislative power and authority is lodged in the governor and the council, who are twelve in num∣ber, appointed by the king, but are filled up by the governor, and twenty-seven representatives elect∣ed by the people. In other respects, the govern∣ment
<PB N="296" REF="2970"/>
is as conformable to the laws of England, as that of a colony can be. The administration of the government is in the governor and council, of whom five is a quorum; and upon the death or absence of the governor, the first in nomination of the council is to preside. The people chuse their representatives, the numbers of whom are fixed by the crown, and these representatives have much the same privileges as the members of the British parliament.</P>
<P>In the civil government of New Jersey we find there are three negatives. 1st, That of the go∣vernor, who is likewise vice-admiral and chan∣cellor of the province. 2d, That of the council, which, with the governor, forms a court of error and chancery. 3d, Of the house of representa∣tives, twenty of whom serve for counties, and the remaining four for the two towns of Perth-Amboy and Burlington. This house, though no court of judicature, has the privilege of enquiring into the mal-administration of the courts of justice.</P>
<P>Sir William Franklin, knt. is governor of Jer∣sey; and the earl of Dunmore, a Scotch peer, hath been lately appointed governor of New-York.</P>
<P>New-York, including Long-Island and Staten-Island, is divided into ten counties, namely, Rich∣mond, Suffolk, Queen's-County, New-York-Coun∣ty, Chester, King's-County, Orange, Duchess, Ulster, and Albany; which last five counties are said to be all inhabited by Dutch, or such as are of Dutch extraction.</P>
<P>The principal towns in these are, New-York, Kingston, and Albany, on the continent; and Jamaica, Bedford, Southampton, Richmond, and Jersey, in Long-Island, which contains the coun∣ties of Richmond, Suffolk, and Queen's-County.</P>
<P>New-York, antiently called Amsterdam, stands in Manahattan island, which is twelve miles long, and two or three broad, lying at the mouth
<PB N="297" REF="2980"/>
of Hudson's or the Iroquois River. It is not very large, but few cities in Europe can vie with it in regularity and neatness. The trade of the inhabi∣tants is carried on by water carriage, and ships of five hundred tons may come up to the wharfs of the city, and be always afloat. Hudson's river, where it runs by New-York, is above three miles broad, and proves a noble conveyance for the goods of the counties of Albany, Ulster, Dutchess, Orange, and King's, to that city. It contains six markets, said to be better supplied with all kinds of provisions, than any in Europe. The town and harbour are defended by forts and batteries. Twelve years ago the horses kept here were com∣puted at five thousand. The principal edifices are the Town-house, the Council-house, where they hold their general assemblies and courts of justice, the English church, the Meeting-houses of all sorts, the Free-school, and public Library. Here is also a Printing-office. The town is governed by a mayor and alderman, and such other officers as our corporations.</P>
<P>Kingston is a pretty, populous, well-built town, ninety miles up the river, where the Aesopus from New Jersey falls into it.</P>
<P>Albany is one hundred and forty three miles up the river, and but five below the place where it is parted into two branches. It consists of between three and four hundred families, who are mostly of Dutch extraction, and has a strong fort and gar∣rison for its defence, as being situated on the fron∣tier of the province. It is not, however, the most distant settlement, for there is a place called Sche∣nectady, sixteen miles above, on a river that runs into Hudson's.</P>
<P>New-Jersey is divided into East and West-Jersey. East-Jersey is again divided into four counties, viz. those of Monmouth, Middlesex, Essex, and Ber∣gen;
<PB N="298" REF="2990"/>
and its principal towns are Elizabeth-town, Perth - Amboy, Shrewsbury, Newark, Middle∣ton, and Brunswick.</P>
<P>Elizabeth-town lies in the county of Essex, op∣posite to the west side of Staten-Island. The greatest part of the trade of the province is carried on here.</P>
<P>Perth Amboy lies in the county of Middlesex, near the mouth of Delaware river, as it runs into Sandy-hook-bay, which is never frozen, and ca∣pacious enough to contain five hundred sail.</P>
<P>Shrewsbury is a considerable town, and the most southern of the province. About thirty thousand out-plantation acres are annexed to it.</P>
<P>Newark stands in Essex county, and has about fifty thousand acres annexed to it; but a part of them remains still to be cultivated.</P>
<P>Middleton lies twenty-six miles south of Pisca∣taqua. Between it and Shrewsbury is an iron∣work.</P>
<P>A college was established at Brunswick October 22, 1746, by governor Belcher. The trustees of this college are generally Presbyterians, and it is governed by a president.</P>
<P>As to West-Jersey it has never yet, as far as we know, been divided into counties. Burlington, which lies in an island in the middle of Delaware river, opposite to Philadelphia, is the capital of the province, the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts and assembles of the pro∣vince being held there. The town being com∣modiously situated for trade, is well built, and has a town-house, with two bridges over the river.</P>
<P>West-Jersey has an easy communication by the river Aesopus with New-York, and with Mary∣land by another river, which comes within four miles of Chesapeak-Bay.</P>
<P>The Iroquois, which inhabit the north-west part of the province of New-York, are the bravest
<PB N="299" REF="3000"/>
and most formidable people of North-America; though the French, whose constant enemies they were, have represented them as the most barba∣rous savages. Under the greatest disadvantages, the want of education, and even letters, they dis∣played a noble genius. The Romans never disco∣vered a greater love for their country, or a greater contempt of death in the cause of liberty, than these people do; and they are exceeding benevolent and hospitable. Every nation of the Iroquois is a distinct republic, governed by their sachems, or civil magistrates, in time of peace; and by their warriors, or captains, in their wars: but their chiefs never resolve on, nor execute any thing of importance, without consulting the heads of their tribes. They acknowledge a supreme Being, whom they stile the Preserver of the universe; and they believe a future state of rewards and punishments: but have very obscure indistinct notions of it, and seem to think the rewards of the good will consist in the enjoyment of those pleasures they were most fond of in this life. They imagine dreaming to be nothing but a sally of the soul out of the body, and taking a trip into that happy land; and if the dream be unpleasant, they at∣tribute it to some obstruction, enemy, or accident it hath met with in the way. They are very strict in observing the oaths which they swear to each other, especially those which their warriors make of standing by one another to the last, and which they keep to such a degree, as to hazard their lives to rescue the bare carcase of their fallen brethren. They commonly make a kind of feast over the grave, and put into it wheat, tobacco, and every thing they think the deceased may want in the o∣ther world. The women are commonly so pro∣lific, that it is a wonder to see one from sixteen to fifty, who is not either pregnant or suckling; yet
<PB N="300" REF="3010"/>
they do most of the drudgery, as grinding the wheat, fetching of wood, water, and the like. The children are often so stubborn, that if they are found fault with, the girls will dispatch themselves with some poisonous weed, and the boys with a gun. The business of the men is hunting, going to war, building their huts, felling of timber, till∣ing the ground, and the like. They commonly sow a field with beans one year, and the next with Indian wheat.</P>
<P>The boys employ their time mostly in fowling, catching of sables, and other such creatures, with gins; and the girls in going into the fields and woods, to gather chesnuts and other fruits. They never fight pitched battles; but their manner of carrying on war is by ambuscade and surprize, by accidental skirmishes, and sudden irruptions into houses and villages, to carry off, plunder and destroy all they can. They are very fond of bath∣ing; and whilst the weather permits, men, women, and children will go often in a day to that diver∣sion. They generally put the prisoners they make in war to the most excruciating and lingering deaths. Many of these and other Indians have been brought to the profession of Christianity, and baptized, espe∣cially in the neighbourhood of our settlements, se∣veral catechists being always maintained for that purpose by the colonies, and the society for pro∣pagating Christian knowledge. Some of them at∣tain a tolerable knowledge of Christianity; and we have lately seen in London an Indian, who preached in several dissenting meeting-houses in and about town, and collected considerable sums for conti∣nuing and extending the laudable design of con∣verting these poor savages.</P>
<P>While the French were masters of Canada, the Jesuits, from political views, were very zealous and active in propagating their superstition among the
<PB N="301" REF="3020"/>
Indians, and met with too great success: even at present, these Popish Indians are not well affected to the English; but, it is to be hoped, the French in Canada will not now be suffered to attempt any thing of that kind, and that our people will not be so negligent in this respect as formerly, as the con∣verting of the Indians is the surest way of attaching them to our interest.</P>
<P>The church of England is established here, and in all the royal governments in British America; but all modes of Christianity, not detrimental to society, are tolerated, the Roman Catholic ex∣cepted.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>PENSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>This colony, which had its name from the fa∣mous quaker William Penn, son of Sir William, commander of the English fleet in Oliver Crom∣well's time, and in the beginning of Charles the Second's reign, who obtained a grant of it in the year 1679, is bounded on the east by Delaware bay and river, and the Atlantic ocean; on the north by the country of the Iroquois, or five nations; and on the south and west by Maryland. Its extent, from north to south, is about two hundred miles; but its breadth varies greatly, from fifteen, and even less, to near two hundred.</P>
<P>The air in Pensylvania is sweet and clear. The fall, or autumn, begins about the 20th of October, and lasts till the beginning of December, when the winter sets in, which continues till March, and is sometimes extremely cold and severe; but the air is then generally dry and healthy. The river De∣laware, though very broad, is often frozen over. From March to June, that is, in the spring, the weather is more inconstant than in the other seasons. In the months of July, August, and September,
<PB N="302" REF="3030"/>
the heats would be almost intolerable, if they were not mitigated by frequent cool breezes. The wind, during the summer, is generally south-west; but in the winter, blows for the most part from the north-west, over the snowy frozen mountains and lakes of Canada, which occasions the excessive cold during that season.</P>
<P>As to the face of this country, towards the coast, like the adjacent colonies, it is flat, but rises gradu∣ally to the Apalachian mountains on the west.</P>
<P>The chief rivers are three, Delaware, Sasqua∣hanna, and Skoolkil. The Delaware, rising in the country of the Iroquois, takes its course southward, and after dividing this province from that of New Jersey, falls into the Atlantic ocean between the promontories or capes May and Henlopen, form∣ing at its mouth a large bay, called, from the river, Delaware Bay. This river is navigable above two hundred miles. The Sasquahanna rises also in the country of the Iroquois, and, running south thro' the middle of the province, falls into the bay of Chesapeake, being navigable a great way for large ships. The Skoolkil has its source in the same country as the other two, and also runs south, al∣most parallel to them; till at length turning to the eastward, it falls into the Delaware at the city of Philadelphia. It is navigable for boats above one hundred miles. These rivers, with the numerous creeks and harbours in Delaware Bay, capable of containing the largest fleets, are extremely favour∣able to the trade of this province.</P>
<P>As to the soil, produce, and traffic of Pensylva∣nia, we refer the reader to what we have said on these heads under New-York and the Jerseys, which is equally applicable to this province; and, if there is any difference, it is on the side of this province. They have some rice here, but no great quantities; and some tobacco, but it is not equal
<PB N="303" REF="3040"/>
to that of Virginia. From the premiums offered by the society of arts in London it appears, that the soil and climate of this province are looked upon as proper for the cultivation of some species of vines. The trade carried on from hence and the other colonies to the French and Dutch islands and Surinam, is not at all to the advantage of Old England, and very destructive to the sugar colo∣nies; for they take melasses, rum, and other spi∣rits, with a great many European goods, from these foreigners; carrying them horses, provisions, and lumber in return, without which the French could not carry on their sugar manufacture to that ad∣vantage they do.</P>
<P>New-York, the Jerseys, and Pensylvania, were discovered, with the rest of the continent of North America, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, by Sebastian Cabot, for the crown of England; but Sir Walter Raleigh was the first adventurer that attempted to plant colonies on these shores, in the reign of queen Elizabeth, and, in honour of that princess, gave all the eastern coast of North Ame∣rica the name of Virginia. Mr. Hudson, an Eng∣lishman, sailing to that part of the coast which lies between Virginia and New-England, in the begin∣ning of the reign of James the First, and being about to make a settlement at the mouth of Hud∣son's river, the Dutch gave him a sum of money to dispose of his interest in this country to them: in the year 1608 they began to plant it, and, by virtue of this purchase, laid claim to all those countries which are now denominated New-York, New-Jersey, and Pensylvania; but there remaining some part of this coast which was not planted by the Hollanders, the Swedes sent a fleet of ships thither, and took possession of it for that crown; but the Dutch having a superior force in the neighbourhood, compelled the Swedes to submit to
<PB N="504" REF="3050"/>
their dominion, allowing them, however, to enjoy the plantations they had settled. The English not admitting, that either the Dutch or Swedes had any right to countries first discovered and planted by a subject of England, and part of them at that time possessed by the subjects of Great Britain, under charter from queen Elizabeth and king James the First, king Charles the Second, during the first Dutch war, in 1664, granted the countries of New York, the Jerseys, and Pensylvania, of which the Dutch had usurped the possession, to his brother James, duke of York; and Sir Robert Carr be∣ing sent over with a squadron of men of war, and land forces, and summoning the Dutch governor of the city of New-Amsterdam, now New-York, to surrender, he thought fit to obey the summons, and yield that capital to the English: the rest of the places in the possession of the Dutch and Swedes followed his example, and these countries were con∣firmed to the English by the Dutch at the next treaty of peace between the two nations. The duke of York afterwards parcelled them out to under proprietors; selling, in particular, to Wil∣liam Penn the elder, in 1683, the town of New∣castle, alias Delaware, and a district of twelve miles round the same; to whom, his heirs and assigns, by another deed of the same date, he made over all that tract of land from twelve miles south of Newcastle to the Whore-hills, otherwise called Cape Henlopen, now divided into the two counties of Kent and Sussex, which, with Newcastle district, are commonly known by the name of the Three Lower Counties upon Delaware River. All the rest of the under-proprietors, some time after, surrendered their charters to the crown, whereby New-York and the Jerseys became royal govern∣ments; but Penn retained that part of the country which had been sold him by the duke of York,
<PB N="305" REF="3060"/>
together with what had been granted to him be∣fore in 1680-1, which now constitutes the pro∣vince of Pensylvania. As soon as Penn had got his patent, he began to plant the country. Those who went over from England were generally dis∣senters and quakers, whose religion is established by law here, but with a toleration of all other pro∣testant sects. The Dutch and Swedes, who were settled here before Mr. Penn became proprietor, chusing still to reside in this country, as they did in New-York and the Jerseys, obtained the same privileges as the rest of his majesty's subjects; and their descendants are now, in a manner, the same people with the English, speaking their language, and being governed by their laws and customs. Mr. Penn however, not satisfied with the title grant∣ed him by king Charles II. and his brother, bought the lands also of the Indians for a va∣luable consideration, or what they esteemed such, (though twenty miles were purchased, at first, for less than an acre about Philadelphia would cost now) paying them in cloth, tools, and utensils, to their entire satisfaction; for they had not hands to cultivate the hundredth part of their lands, and if they could have raised a product, there was nobody to buy: the purchase, therefore, was all clear gain to them; and, by the coming of the English, their peltry trade became so profitable, that they soon found their condition much altered for the better, and are now as well cloathed and fed as the European peasantry in many places.</P>
<P>Pensylvania, at present, is one of the most flourish∣ing colonies in North-America, having never had any quarrel with the natives. Whenever they desire to extend their settlements, they purchase new lands of the sachems, never taking any by force; but the Indians now set a very high price upon their lands, in comparison of what they did at first, and
<PB N="306" REF="3070"/>
will hardly part with them at any rate. In an es∣timate of the proprietary estate of the province, published above a dozen years ago, we find, that the proprietaries, who alone can purchase lands here from the natives, had bought seven millions of acres for no more than seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling, which the proprietaries afterwards sold at the rate of fifteen pound for every hundred acres. The Indian council at Onandago, however, disapproved of their deputies parting with so much land; and, in the year 1755, obliged the proprie∣taries to re-convey great part of the same to the Indians.</P>
<P>A dispute subsisted a long time between the proprietaries of this province and Lord Baltimore, proprietary of Maryland, about the right to certain lands, which was at last amicably adjusted, though greatly in favour of the Penns. There were also, some years since, violent disputes between the pro∣prietaries and the assembly, the former alledging, that their private estate ought to be exempted from all taxes; but whether the matter is yet settled, or not, we cannot pretend to say.</P>
<P>About the year 1704, there happened some al∣teration in the constitution of the province. It has now a governor, council, and assembly, each with much the same power and privileges as in the neighbouring colony of New-York. The lieutenant-governor and council are appointed by the proprietors, Thomas and Richard Penn, with his majesty's approbation; but if the laws enacted here are not repealed within six months after they have been presented to the king for his approba∣tion or disallowance, they are not repealable by the crown after that time.</P>
<P>Pensylvania is divided into seven counties, four of which are called the upper, and three the lower. Of the upper, viz. Buckingham, Philadelphia,
<PB N="307" REF="3080"/>
Chester, and Lancaster, the three first are the lands included in king Charles the Second's grant, and designed Pensylvania; the lower, viz. those of Newcastle, Kent, and Sussex, were called No∣va-Belgia, before the duke of York sold them, as we observed above, to Mr. Penn. The upper counties end at Marcus Hook, four miles below Chester town, where the lower begin, and run a∣long the coast near one hundred miles. Each of these counties has a sheriff, with a quarterly and monthly session, and assizes twice a-year. Though some parts of the colony are not yet compleatly planted and inhabited, yet it is said to have con∣tained, many years ago, upwards of one hundred thousand souls.</P>
<P>Philadelphia, the capital of the colony, situated in 40° 30′. north latitude, is one of the most beau∣tiful and regular cities in the world, being an ob∣long of two miles, extending from the river De∣laware to the Schuylkill, with the east end fronting the river Delaware, the west the river Schuylkill, and each front a mile in length. The river Dela∣ware, as we observed already, is navigable from the sea for large vessels above two hundred miles, and that of Schuylkill as far as Philadelphia. Everyman in possession of one thousand acres has his house ei∣ther in one of the fronts, facing the rivers, or in the high street, running from the middle of one front to the middle of the other. Every owner of five thousand acres, besides the above-mentioned privilege, is entitled to have an acre of ground in the front of his house, and all others may have half an acre, for gardens and court yards. Every quar∣ter of the city forms a square of eight acres, and, almost in the centre of it, is a square of ten acres, surrounded by the town-house, and other public buildings. The high street is one hundred feet wide, and runs the whole length of the town: pa∣rallel
<PB N="308" REF="3090"/>
to it run eight other streets, which are crossed by twenty more at right angles, all of them thirty feet wide, and communicating with canals from the two rivers, which add not only to the beauty, but the wholesomeness of the city. Ships of four or five hundred tons may come up to the key, which is two hundred feet square, and furnished with all the conveniences for ship-building, as well as for loading and unloading goods. Though the whole of this magnificent plan hath not yet been carried into execution, a considerable progress hath been made towards it. The town-house is so stately, spacious, and regular, that it would make a figure in any capital of Europe. The other public build∣ings are, the court-house, two quakers meeting-houses, one church of England, one baptist meet∣ing, one Dutch Lutheran church, one Dutch Cal∣vinist church, one Moravian church, one mass∣house, the quakers school-house, the city alms∣house, the quakers almshouse, the hospital, prison, and work-house.</P>
<P>The noblest institution, however, in the pro∣vince of Pensylvania, is the academy established in this city, which, by the public encouragement it has already, and may hereafter receive, bids fair, in time, to rival the brightest seminaries of learning in the mother-country, especially in a reign so be∣neficent as the present is to literature. Dr. Smith, who is at the head of this academy, raised a very considerable sum for it lately, both in England and Scotland, having obtained a brief for that purpose in regard to England, and recommendation of a collection all over Scotland, by the general assem∣bly of the church thereof.</P>
<P>Among the several sects in Philadelphia, that of the Moravians is none of the least considerable. The wildness and extravagance of this sect are well known all over Europe; but though they have a
<PB N="309" REF="3100"/>
chapel here, with a small organ, their principal set∣tlement is about fifty or sixty miles from hence. The similarity of practice between them and the quakers, in some points, makes them fond of re∣siding in Pensylvania: like the quakers, they de∣cline carrying arms in their own persons, yet con∣tribute chearfully to the military establishment for the defence of their settlements and country. Their zeal for the conversion of the Indians is incredible, exceeding, if possible, that for which the Jesuits were formerly so noted; and they have per∣suaded not a few of these savages to come and live with them, and conform to them. About the year 1748, they sent to Greenland or Davis's Straits, at their own expence, a ship, with a wooden church, ready framed, for the use of the inhabitants of that country, which produces no timber; and when the ship returned to Philadelphia, it brought two men and a young woman, natives of Green∣land, who had been converted there by the Mora∣vian missionaries. The same Moravians had then also a mission at Berbice and Surinam, from whence two converts likewise came to Pensylvania. The Pensylvanian Moravians have almost the same in∣dulgence shewn them by the legislature of Great-Britain, excepting in criminal cases, as the quakers have; and their abstemious manner of living ena∣bles them to carry on the handicrafts they profess at a cheap rate; nor are they without some men of learning and academical education among them. Their chief settlement is called Bethlehem.</P>
<P>In the county to which Philadelphia gives name are several other towns, of which the most conside∣rable are, German Town, so called because most of the inhabitants are of that nation, or descended from such as were, Frankfort, Abington, Dublin, Radnor, Amersland, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="3110"/>
Of the other towns in the province the most considerable are, Bristol, Falls Town, and Penns∣bury, in the county of Buckingham; Chester Town, Chichester, and Marcus Hook, in the coun∣ty of Chester; Newcastle Town, Haverford-west, Merioneth, and St. George, in the county of New∣castle; Dover, Cranebrook, Marden, Mespelli∣ven Plantations, in the county of Kent; Lewis, in the county of Sussex; Lancaster, in the coun∣ty to which it gives name: and fourteen miles from Lancaster, on the frontier part of the county, is a small town, called Ephrata, lying between two small hills, in the most delightful situation that can well be imagined, as if nature had created it for the indulgence of contemplation. This town is inhabited by a sect called Dumplers, or Dunk∣ards, and one, perhaps, of the most harmless and extraordinary that has appeared since the institu∣tion of Christianity. A German hermit, who set∣tled on the spot where Ephrata is now built, was the founder of this extraordinary sect. The fame of his solitude inspired some of his countrymen with curiosity, and the simplicity of his life, with the piety of his conversation, induced them to join, and imitate him. A people who leave their na∣tive country to enjoy liberty of conscience, can bear all subsequent mortifications. The Germans of both sexes, who joined the hermit, soon accus∣tomed themselves to his way of thinking, and con∣sequently to his manner of living; industry be∣came part of their duty, and divided their time with devotion. Their gains are thrown into one common stock, which supplies all their exigencies, private as well as public: their females are clois∣tered up by themselves in a separate part of the town, the situation of which is delightful, and screens them from the north wind. It is triangu∣lar, and fenced round with thick rows of apple,
<PB N="311" REF="3120"/>
beech, and cherry trees, besides having an orchard in the middle. The houses, which are of wood, are mostly three stories high; and every person has a separate apartment, that he may not be dis∣turbed in his devotions. The women never see the men but at public worship, or when it is ne∣cessary to consult upon matters of public oecono∣my; and the number of both may be about three hundred. Their garb is the most simple that can be well imagined, being a long white woollen gown in winter, and linen in the summer, with a cape, which serves them for a hat, like that of a capu∣chin behind, and fastened round the waist with a belt. Under the gown, they wear a waistcoat of the same materials, a coarse shirt, trowsers, and shoes. The dress of the women is the same, only instead of trowsers, they wear petticoats, and when they leave their nunnery (for such it is) they muf∣fie up their faces in their capuchins. The diet of the Dunkards consists of vegetables; but it is no principle with them to abstain from animal food, only they think that such abstinence is most agree∣able to a Christian life. This temperance emaci∣ates their bodies, and, as the men indulge their beards to grow to their full length, gives them a hollow, ghastly appearance. Their beds are no better than benches; a little wooden block serves them for a pillow; and they celebrate public wor∣ship twice every day, and as often every night. But though such modes of life appear absurd and im∣practicable, the Dunkards are far from being ex∣travagant. Their chapel is very decent; and they have, upon a fine stream, a grist-mill, a paper-mill, an oil-mill, and a mill for pearl-barley, all of them most ingeniously constructed by themselves: they have even a printing-press; and they are, espe∣cially the nuns, extremely ingenious in working, and in embellishments, which they perform with a
<PB N="312" REF="3130"/>
variety of beautiful colours, with gilding, in imi∣tation of the initials in antient manuscripts; and they stick them up, by way of ornament, in their churches and cells. By those different manufac∣tures, the public stock of this ascetic people is well supplied, as no denomination of Christians can be their enemies, their religious tenets being mingled with the absurdities of all. Notwithstanding the two sexes live separate from one another in their town, yet the Dunkards are far from being averse to matrimony. In that case, the parties must in∣deed leave the town; but they are supplied out of the public fund with whatever is necessary for their settling elsewhere. This they generally do as near as they can to Ephrata, to which they send their children for education. The Dunkards administer baptism by dipping or plunging, but to adult per∣sons only: they hold free-will, and think that the doctrine of original sin, as to its effect upon A∣dam's posterity, is absurd and impious: they dis∣claim violence, even in cases of self-defence; and suffer themselves to be defrauded or wronged, ra∣ther than go to law: they are superstitious to the last degree in observing their sabbath; and all their prayers and preachings, during their worship, are extempore: humility, chastity, temperance, and other Christian virtues, are commonly the subjects of their discourses; and they imagine, that the souls of dead Christians are employed in converting those of the dead who had no opportunity of knowing the gospel: they deny the eternity of hell's torments; but believe in certain temporary ones, that will be inflicted on infidels, and obstinate per∣sons, who deny Christ to be their only Saviour; but they think, that at a certain period all will be admitted to the endless fruition of the Deity. A people whose principles are so harmless, and whose practice is so simple and virtuous, cannot be
<PB N="313" REF="3140"/>
otherwise than happy upon earth. Among themselves they know nothing but harmony and mutual af∣fection; every one chearfully performs the task of industry assigned to him, and their hospitality to strangers is unbounded; but their principles lead them to take nothing in recompence.</P>

<HEAD>MARYLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded to the west by the A∣palachian mountains; to the east by Chesapeak Bay, and the Northern Ocean; to the south by Patowmack River; and to the north by Dela∣ware Bay; lying between 37°. 50′. and 40°. north latitude, and extending about one hundred and forty miles in length, and one hundred and thirty∣five in breadth. It had the name of Maryland from Henrietta Maria, daughter of Henry IV. of France, and queen to king Charles I. of England, who granted it by patent to Cecilius Calvert, lord Baltimore, anno 1632.</P>
<P>The air of this province is said to be excessive hot some part of the summer, and equally cold in winter, when the north-west wind blows; but the winters are not of more than three or four months duration, and in these they have seldom one month of bad weather: all the rest, they are happy in a clear air and bright sun, and are scarce ever troubled with fogs. In this, and in all the other colonies, the air continually acquires a greater degree of salubrity in proportion as the land is cleared, and the country inhabited.</P>
<P>Maryland may be divided into the low lands, next the sea, and the hilly country, lying towards the Apalachian mountains. It is watered by in∣numerable springs, forming a great many fine ri∣vers, of which the chief are Patowmack, Pocomo∣ac, Patuxhent, Severn, Cheptouk, Sassafras, and
<PB N="314" REF="3150"/>
Wicomocca rivers, and that of St. George. These and other rivers, capable of receiving large ships, with the numerous bays and creeks that indent the land on every side, give the seamen an opportunity of bringing their vessels up to the planters doors. The chief bays are those of Chesepeak and Dela∣ware, and the most noted cape that of Henlopen, at the entrance of Delaware Bay. The bay of Chesepeak divides the province into two parts; of which one lies on the east, and the other on the west.</P>
<P>The chief commodity is tobacco, of which it is said to have exported annually, many years ago, upwards of thirty thousand hogsheads, each hogshead seven hundred pounds weight. This commodity forms the medium of currency of Maryland, being re∣ceived in debts and taxes; and the inspector's notes for tobacco, delivered to him, are transfera∣ble. It is said, that an industrious man can ma∣nage six thousand plants of tobacco, and four acres of Indian corn. The tobacco of this pro∣vince, called Oroonoko, is stronger than that of Virginia; and, though not much liked or used in England, yet, in the eastern and northern parts of Europe, it is preferred before the sweet scented to∣bacco of James and York rivers, in Virginia. Another considerable commodity of Maryland is pork, of which large quantities are exported, salted and barreled; the woods containing vast droves of wild swine, which are generally of a small size. Good land in Maryland yields about fifteen bushels of wheat an acre, or thirty bushels of Indian corn; but the grain is said to be very subject to the wee∣vil. Great quantities both of hemp and flax are raised in this province, and the mountains yield abundance of iron ore, which is run into pigs, and refined into iron. Maryland oak is not great∣ly esteemed for building large ships, but is very
<PB N="315" REF="3160"/>
proper for staves, and small craft. Their black walnut is very proper for joiners work; and they have likewise poplars, cedars, chesnuts, and other woods, with most of the different species of grain and fruits, both of Europe and America.</P>
<P>The planters, generally speaking, live in farms dispersed all over the country, chiefly near the banks of rivers, or on the sea-coast. They seem to have an aversion here, as well as in Virginia, to reside in towns, or rather they find it more conve∣nient for the management of their plantations; and as the situation of the province has all along secured it, in a great measure, from the incursions and ravages of the Indians, they have not found it necessary to baulk their inclinations. Though the province is far from being well peopled, the in∣habitants are computed at about eighty thousand, exclusive of the negroes, who are very numerous. No planter can plant more than six thousand plants of tobacco per negro, besides raising some barrels of corn. The weekly allowance to each negro is a peck of Indian corn, and some salt. Besides the manufactures we have mentioned, a kind of wool∣len cloth is made here, and a wax extracted from the fruit of what they call the wax-tree, being a kind of myrtle, which, when mixed with tallow, makes candles. They likewise make excellent cyder for their own drinking; but they suffer the grapes, of which they have vast quantities in the woods, to rot upon the ground, though it is thought, if pro∣perly cultivated, they would yield a thin whole-some wine.</P>
<P>The commodities imported into Maryland con∣sist chiefly of wines, from Madeira, Fyal, and France; of rum, from Barbadoes; of slaves, from Africa; and of malt, beer, linens and woollens, furniture, utensils of every kind, and indeed most
<PB N="316" REF="3170"/>
of the elegancies and conveniences of life, from England.</P>
<P>Maryland was discovered in the year 1606, when Virginia was first planted, and for some time was esteemed a part of Virginia, till king Charles I. in 1632, granted all that part of Virginia which lay north of Patowmac river to the lord Baltimore, of the kingdom of Ireland, and his heirs. The Baltimore family were deprived of the government of this province during the civil wars in England, but recovered it again at the Restoration; and they still remain proprietors. The estate enjoyed by them here is the most considerable of any sub∣ject of Great-Britain abroad; for, besides their plantations, they have certain revenues granted to them by several assemblies, as a duty on each hogshead of tobacco, and other incomes, which, with the sale of lands, uncultivated and unpur∣chased, must amount, at present, to a very conside∣rable sum yearly.</P>
<P>The first adventurers having been Roman ca∣tholics, followed by many families of that persua∣sion, who came over from England to avoid the penal laws, many of the planters still profess that religion: however, the church of England is esta∣blished here, and churches have not only been built, but parishes allotted to them with annual stipends to the ministers; every Christian male six∣teen years old, and negroes male and female, above that age, paying forty pounds of tobacco, which is levied by the sheriff, among other public burdens, and yields about one hundred pounds sterling, at a medium, to each.</P>
<P>Maryland contains above a dozen counties, in which the chief places are Annapolis, St. Mary's, Dorchester, Williamstadt, Harrington, Warring∣ton, Calverton, Piscataway, Bristol, Baltimore, A∣bington, Masterkout, St. Michael, and Bolingbroke.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="3180"/>
Annapolis was formerly called Severn, but re∣ceived its present name in 1694, when it was made a port town, and the residence of a collector and naval officer. The county-court was removed hi∣ther in 1699, and ever since it has always been the chief seat of justice, and held to be the capital of the province. Here is a free-school, as well as in several other places of the province. The present lieutenant-governor is Robert Eden, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>VIRGINIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded on the south by Ca∣rolina; on the north-east by the river Patowmack, which divides it from Maryland; on the east by the Atlantic Ocean; and on the west by the Apalachian mountains; extending about two hun∣dred and forty miles in length, and two hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>The air and seasons here depend very much upon the wind, as to heat and cold, dryness and moisture. The north and north-west winds are very nitrous, piercing cold, and clear, or else stormy; the south-east and south, hazy and sultry hot. In winter they have a fine clear air, and dry, which renders it very pleasant. Their frosts are short; but sometimes so very sharp, that they will freeze the rivers over three miles broad. Snow falls sometimes in pretty large quantities, but rarely lies above a day or two. Their spring is about a month earlier than in England; in April they have frequent rains; in May and June, the heat increases; and the summer is much like ours, being mitigated with gentle breezes, that rise about nine o'clock, and decrease and increase as the sun rises or falls. In July and August these breezes cease, and the air becomes stagnant and sultry hot; in September the weather generally
<PB N="318" REF="3190"/>
changes suddenly, and heavy rains fall, and then the inhabitants are generally very sickly. It is to be observed, however, that here, and in all our other colonies, as the cultivation and population of them advances, the air grows better, to which the cutting down of the woods greatly contribute.</P>
<P>As to the face of the country in Virginia, it is ge∣nerally low and flat towards the sea-coast, and for an hundred miles up the country; so that there is hardly a hill or stone to be seen, except here and there some rocks of iron ore, and some banks of a kind of pe∣trified oyster-shells. The whole country, before it was planted, was one continued forest, interspersed with marshes, which in the West-Indies they call swamps. No country now produces greater quan∣tities of excellent tobacco, and yet the soil is ge∣nerally so sandy and shallow, that after they have cleared a fresh piece of ground out of the woods, it will not bear tobacco past two or three years, un∣lelss cow-penned, and well dunged.</P>
<P>The forests here yield oaks, poplars, pines, ce∣dars, cypresses, sweet myrtles, chesnuts, hickery, live oak, walnut, dog-wood, elder, hazel, chinka∣pins, locust-trees, sassafras, elm, ash, beech, with a great variety of sweet gums and incense, which distil from several trees; pitch, tar, rosin, turpen∣tine, plank-timber, masts, and yards. Virginia yields also rice, hemp, Indian corn, plenty of pas∣ture, with coal, quarries of stone, and lead and iron ore.</P>
<P>Of spontaneous flowers there are a great variety here, particularly the finest crown-imperial in the world, and the cardinal-flower, so much extolled for its scarlet colour; almost the whole year round the plains and valleys are adorned with flowers of one kind or another. In this country also is found the tulip bearing laurel-tree, which has the
<PB N="319" REF="3200"/>
pleasantest smell in the world, and keeps seeding and blossoming several months together.</P>
<P>Silk grass grows spontaneous in many places; the fibres of which are as fine as flax, and much stronger than hemp. Their trees are much loftier than ours, and no underwood or bushes grow be∣neath; so that people travel with ease through the forests on horseback, and never want a fine shade to defend them from the summer heats.</P>
<P>Among other animals in Virginia are elks, but not common; red deer, in great plenty; musk rats, racoons, beavers, and wolves. As for rep∣tiles, they have lizards, with several kinds of snakes, particularly the rattle-snake. Of birds, they have several sorts of eagles, hawks, and owls. The white owl is very beautiful, all the feathers of the back and breast being white as sil∣ver, except a black spot immediately below the throat: their turkies are very large, some of them weighing forty pounds: their partridges are smaller than ours, but very well tasted: their nightin∣gales are well known in England: they have a bird called the mocking-bird, of two sorts, grey and red, esteemed the finest singing bird in the world; it has its name from imitating the notes of all other kinds of birds it hears: they have here also that beautiful little bird called the humming-bird.</P>
<P>Besides the animals that are natives of the coun∣try, most of the quadrupeds of Europe have been introduced here; such as horses, cows, sheep, and hogs, which are prodigiously multiplied, great numbers running wild in their forests, besides what they have tame in their plantations. Beef and pork are sold from one penny to twopence a pound; their fattest pullets, at sixpence a-piece; chickens, at three or four shillings a dozen; geese, at ten∣pence; and turkeys at eighteen-pence a-piece.
<PB N="320" REF="3210"/>
Fish, oysters, and wild-fowl, are the cheapest food in the country in the season; and deer are sold from five to ten shillings a piece. In February, March, April, and May, shoals of herrings come up into their very brooks; some of the size of ours, but for the most part much larger. Among many other species, they have three somewhat remarka∣ble; namely, the sting-grass, the toad-fish, and the tobacco-pipe fish. The sting-grass takes its name from a sting in its tail; the toad-fish, from its swelling monstrously when taken out of the water; and the tobacco-pipe fish, from its resem∣bling that instrument: all these are eaten. They have great quantities, in summer, of those destruc∣tive worms that eat into the bottoms of ships, wherever they find the coat of pitch, tar, or lime, worn off the timber; these worms having a kind of horn or screw in their head, with which they force a passage through any wood to which they stick.</P>
<P>Four great rivers, namely James River, York River, Rappahannock, and Patowmack, which rise in the Apalachian mountains, run through this province, or along its borders, from the north-west to the south-east, and fall into the bay of Chese∣peak. James River is generally about two miles over, and navigable at least fourscore. York and Rappahannock are not so large; but Patowmack, as we had occasion to observe before, is navigable for near two hundred miles, being generally seven miles broad, and in some places nine. The great bay of Chesepeak runs up through Virginia and Maryland, almost due north, three hundred miles, and upwards, being navigable most part of the way for large ships. The two promontories that form the mouth of the bay, are called Cape Charles, and Cape Henry.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="3220"/>
The government here is formed upon the Eng∣lish model; the governor acts as the king, the council supplies the place of a house of lords, and the house of representatives that of the com∣mons. The chief court, next to the assembly, is the general-court, held by the governor and coun∣cil, who are judges of it, and take cognizance of all causes, criminal, penal, ecclesiastical, and civil. There lies no appeal from this court, unless the matter in dispute amounts in value to above three hundred pounds; and then an appeal lies to the king and council in England. In criminal cases, there ne∣ver was any appeal; but the governor can pardon persons for any crimes except murder, and reprieve, even for that, till his majesty's pleasure is known. The governor, as representing the king, has a ne∣gative on all the acts of assembly; which he calls, prorogues, and dissolves. He calls also, and pre∣sides in the council, makes justices of the peace, and all the officers of the militia, under the degree of a lieutenant general: he issues proclamations, keeps the seal of the colony, disposes of the king's lands according to the charter, and the laws of the country: all payments out of the treasury are ordered by him, or in his name: he is vice-ad∣miral, by virtue of a commission from the admi∣ralty, and has a salary of two thousand pounds a-year, which, with an hundred and fifty pounds a-year for house rent and perquisities, may amount to near three thousand pounds. The king nomi∣nates the counsellors; but the governor fills up the vacant places of such as die, or are removed, without staying for orders from England. When the governor and deputy-governor are absent, the administration falls to the president of the coun∣cil for the time being. The council have an equal vote with the governor, in calling assemblies, disposing of the public revenues, placing and dis∣placing
<PB N="322" REF="3230"/>
officers, in votes and orders of council, proclamations, grants, and patents. The privi∣leges of the assembly-men are the same with those of the members of parliament in England, and their power much the same as that of the house of commons. The laws of Virginia are the acts of parliament and statutes of England, which extend to all his majesty's dominions in general; the sta∣tutes and acts of the assembly, which relate only to this colony, and must be sent to England to be confirmed by the king; and the orders of the king and council in England, which, in many things, have the force of laws in the Plantations.</P>
<P>There are several public officers, besides the go∣vernor, who have their commissions immediately from his majesty; particularly, the auditor of the revenue, the receiver-general, and the secretary, in whose office is kept the public records, and all deeds and other writings proved. The ecclesiasti∣cal commissary receives his authority from the bi∣shop of London. The treasurer of the province is appointed by the general-assembly, and receives the money raised by the acts of that assembly.</P>
<P>As to the forces of the colony, every freeman, that is, all that are not servants, from sixteen to sixty years of age, are enlisted in the militia, and are mustered once a year at a general muster, and four times a-year by troops and companies, in their respective counties; and they are reckoned above two thousand men; the whole inhabitants, men, women, and children, amounting to upwards of one hundred thousand, and the slaves and servants to twice that number. However, the popula∣tion of Virginia is not such as might have been expected from so antient and flourishing a colony; nor are the towns of any considerable note. This last circumstance is owing to the vast commodious∣ness of water-carriage, which every where presents
<PB N="323" REF="3240"/>
itself to the plantations of private persons, and the scarcity of handicrafts. Virginia, however, is dis∣tinguished by several magnificent public buildings▪ it still retains its original staple manufacture and commodity of tobacco; and they carry on a great trade with the West-Indies, in lumber, pitch, tar, corn, and provisions; and with Britain, in flax, hemp, iron, staves, and plank.</P>
<P>The public revenues arise from a rent reserved by the crown of all lands granted by patent, a duty of two shillings a hogshead on all tobacco ex∣ported, a duty of six-pence a head for every pas∣senger brought into the country, fines and for∣feitures, duties on foreign liquors, and on slaves and servants imported, and, lastly, money raised by acts passed in the assemblies; besides the duties laid on tobacco, in the countries that produce it.</P>
<P>As to the religion of the Virginians, the body of the people are members of the church of England, intermixed with some quakers and presbyterians. In each parish there is a church, built either with timber, brick, or stone, and decently furnished with all things necessary for the celebration of di∣vine service. In large parishes there is a chapel of ease, and sometimes two, for the conveniency of the parishioners. The ministers maintenance is settled at sixteen thousand pounds of tobacco each yearly, besides perquisites. The power of induc∣tion, upon the presentation of ministers, is lodged in the governor's hands by law. The bishop of London's commissary, whose business it is to make visitations of churches, and superintend the clergy, is allowed one hundred pounds a-year.</P>
<P>Some attempts were made by Sir Walter Ra∣leigh and others to settle colonies here, and at Ca∣rolina, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; but all of them, through neglect, proved ineffectual, till James I. by his letters patent, dated the 10th of April
<PB N="324" REF="3250"/>
1606, authorised Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Summers, Richard Hackluit, clerk, (prebendary of Westminster) and other adventures, to plant the coast of Virginia, between 35 and 45°. of north latitude. Hereupon having fitted out three small ships, they set sail from the Downs the 5th of Janua∣ry 1606, arrived in the Bay of Chesepeak, and sail∣ing up the river Powhatan, now James River, they landed on the peninsula, about fifty miles up the ri∣ver, where they built a fort, and afterwards a town, which they called James Town, in honour of king James I. This was the first town built by the Eng∣lish on the continent of America. There happened some skirmishes between the English and the natives at their landing; but the fear of fire-arms brought the latter to a pretended reconciliation, waiting, however, for an opportunity of falling upon these strangers to advantage. The fort being furnished, captain Newport, who commanded the expedition, returned to England on the 22d of June 1607, leaving one hundred and four persons in the new settlement. The garrison soon finding themselves in want of provisions, and the natives refusing to sup∣ply them with any, tho' they offered to give them the full value for them, the English found them∣selves under the necessity of plundering the coun∣try, upon which an open war ensued between them and the natives. However, fresh supplies and re∣inforcements coming over, commanded by the lord Delaware, the Indians were glad to enter into a treaty of peace, during which the English finding a great demand for tobacco in Europe, began to encourage the planting of it, in which they suc∣ceeded beyond their expectations; and at the same time Sir George Yardly, the governor, established a government, resembling that of England; and the first general-assembly met at James Town, in May 1620, and negroes were first imported into Virginia
<PB N="325" REF="3260"/>
the same year. The planters, not long after, falling out among themselves, the Indians took advantage of their divisions, and made several attempts to re∣cover their country, killing great numbers of the English by surprize These misfortunes being as∣cribed to the mal-administration of the compa∣ny, king Charles I. dissolved it in the year 1626, and reduced the government of Virginia under his own immediate direction; appointing the gover∣nor and council himself, ordering all processes and patents to be issued in his name, and reserv∣ing a quit-rent for every hundred acres of land. The planters, however, falling into factions and parties again, the Indians made a third effort to recover their lost liberties, and cut off near five hun∣dred more of the English; but they were at length repulsed, and Sir William Berkley, the then governor, afterwards made a peace with them, which continued a considerable time, during which he promoted manufactures of silk and linen, and was in all respects esteemed an excellent governor; but the act of navigation restraining the planters from sending their merchandize to foreign coun∣tries, and from receiving cloathing, furniture, or supplies from any country, but England, having created a great deal of discontent, Mr. Bacon, a popular factious gentleman, took advantage of their disaffection, and setting up for himself, drew the people into rebellion, deposed the governor, and compelled him to fly to the eastern shore of the Bay of Chesepeak; and had not Bacon died soon after, he had probably made himself sovereign of Virginia. Upon his death Sir William returned to his government, and the people to their duty; since which there have been no material alterations in the state of Virginia; but they have hitherto al∣most entirely neglected the culture of silk, wine, and every other branch of business, which the soil
<PB N="326" REF="3270"/>
and climate seemed proper for, and employed themselves wholly in planting and curing tobacco: however, it is to be hoped, that the premiums, of∣fered by the society for the encouragement of arts and manufactures in England, will be the means of procuring these more attention than has hitherto been paid to them, and they deserved.</P>
<P>The Americans on the frontiers of Virginia, ac∣cording to those who have lived among them, are of a middling stature, strait and well proportioned, with the finest limbs in the world; nor is there a dwarf or mishapen person among them. Their colour is that of copper, rendered darker by greas∣ing themselves, and being exposed to the weather. They have black eyes, and their hair is coal-black, which the men cut into several shapes, and both men and women grease so that it shines. The better sort wear a kind of coronet four or five inches broad, and open at top, composed of a sort of beads, and some a wreath of died furs; they have also bracelets on their necks and arms: but the common people go bare-headed, only they stick large shining feathers in their hair. Their cloaths are a large mantle, carelesly wrapped round their bodies, and sometimes girt closely with a girdle. The common sort only pass a piece of cloth or string round their middles, and put a piece of cloth or skin between their thighs, which turn over the string at each end. Their shoes, when they wear any, are made of an entire piece of buckskin. The dress of the women differs little from that of the men, only the better sort have more beads and bracelets. They commonly go naked as far as the navel downwards, and upwards to the middle of the thigh; their breasts are round and small, and never hang down as those of the black women on the coast of Guinea. Instead of keeping their children warm, they dip them over head and ears
<PB N="327" REF="3280"/>
in cold water, and afterwards tie them to a board, covered with somewhat that is soft, having a hole in it, through which they discharge their excrements: they keep them several months in this posture, till the limbs begin to grow strong; when they suffer the child to crawl about as well as it can. They worship the devil; pretending, if they did not pacify him, he would destroy their health, peace, and plenty. Their priests are high∣ly reverenced by them, and are great pretend∣ers to pawawing, or conjuring. The Indians al∣ways consult them, before they go on any enter∣prize. They reckon their years by winters; and divide them into five seasons, the budding time, the earing of the corn, the summer, the harvest, and the winter. The months they count by the moon. They divide the days into three parts; the rise, power, and lowering of the sun. They keep their accounts by knots on a string, or notch∣es on a stick. Their food is Indian corn, soaked and boiled in water, beavers, turtle, several kinds of snakes, broth made of deers humbles, pease, beans, &amp;c. When the English first came among them, they had no iron tools; their knives were sharpen∣ed reeds or shells, and their axes sharp stones. They felled trees by laying fire to their roots; and by fire they also hollowed them, and made ca∣noes of them. Their way of producing fire was, by rubbing one stick against another that was softer.</P>
<P>Virginia is divided into thirty-five counties, in which are above fifty parishes; but the only places that deserve the name of towns, and are worth mentioning are Williamsburgh, and James Town. The former stands in James County, between James and York Rivers, and is the seat of the go∣vernment, assembly, and chief courts. Here is
<PB N="328" REF="3290"/>
also a college, called William and Mary College, having been founded by king William, who gave two thousand pounds towards it, and twenty thou∣sand acres of land, with power to purchase and hold lands to the value of two thousand pounds a∣year, and a duty of one penny per pound on all tobacco exported to the other plantations. There is a president, six masters or professors, and other officers, who are named by the governors or visit∣ors. The college has now a pretty good income, and makes no contemptible figure. The Hon. Mr. Boyle made a very large donation to the col∣leges for the education of Indian children. Besides the college, there are some other handsome edifices here; as the state-house or capitol, the church, a magazine for arms and ammunition, a public pri∣son, a fort, a play-house, &amp;c. There is also a large square for a market-place, with a bowling∣green near it.</P>
<P>James Town stands about twenty-six miles above the mouth of the river of that name, on the north side, in a peninsula; but is little better than a village.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>NORTH and SOUTH CAROLINAS.</HEAD>
<P>The North and South Carolinas are bounded by Virginia on the north; by Georgia on the south; by the Atlantic Ocean on the east; and by the A∣palachian mountains on the west; containing all that part of North-America lying between 31 and 36°. of north latitude; and extending along the coast about three hundred and fifty miles, and from two hundred to two hundred and sixty backwards.</P>
<P>The face of these countries is low and level, for about one hundred miles west of the coast; hence they rise gradually to the Apalachian mountains,
<PB N="329" REF="3300"/>
which are about one hundred and fifty miles dis∣tant from the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>The situation of the Carolinas is such, that nei∣ther the heat in summer nor the cold in winter are very violent; yet the former is rather more trou∣blesome than the latter. They have sometimes very heavy rains, both in summer and winter, with high winds, or rather hurricanes; but it is not often that they do much mischief. The north-west wind, even in summer, blows exceeding sharp, and is apt to bring distempers on those who do not take care to guard against it; but such as expose not themselves unnecessarily to these, or the cold breezes of the evening and night after a hot day, and live regularly, for the most part enjoy a good state of health; for the weather is generally clear, serene, and pleasant.</P>
<P>The soil of these provinces is so fertile, that ve∣getables of all sorts either actually grow there, or would grow, if properly cultivated; particularly vines, wheat, rice, Indian corn, barley, oats, pease, beans, hemp, flax, cotton, tobacco, indigo, olives; orange, citron, cypress, sassafras, oak, walnut, cas∣sia, and pine trees, and white mulberry trees, for feeding silk-worms; sarsaparilla; and pines, which yield turpentine, rosin, tar, and pitch. There is a kind of tree, from which runs an oil of extraordi∣nary virtue for curing wounds, and another, which yields a balm, thought to be little inferior to that of Mecca. There are other trees, besides these, that yield gums. The Carolinas produce likewise prodigious quantities of honey, of which they make excellent spirits, and mead as good as Malaga sack. About eighty thousand barrels of rice, at a me∣dium, are produced yearly in the Carolinas, each weighing four hundred pounds; of which the greater part is exported. Besides rice, the Caro∣linians
<PB N="330" REF="3310"/>
cultivate some tobacco; but their chie trade lies in provisions; for they supply Jamaica Barbadoes, and the Leeward Islands, with beef pork, grain, pease, butter, suet, raw hides, and leather. They likewise send to the same island¦tar, turpentine, timber, masts, and furs; but the last are of an inferior kind. Maize, or Indian corn, thrives here exceedingly; but, in some other respects, the product has not been answerable to the expectation from the soil and climate. Though many parts of Carolina, especially on the sea coast, abound with vines; yet no progress worth men¦tioning has been made in producing wine. Their manufactures of silk, notwithstanding the great quantities of mulberry-trees they have, are not yet considerable; but, from some samples that have been brought over, it appears equal in quality to any we purchase from foreigners. Though cochi∣neal is said to be found here, the inhabitants seem to neglect the profits arising from that insect; and, for some years, their attention has been chief∣ly turned towards making indigo.</P>
<P>The Carolinians take from Great-Britain all kinds of woollen and linen drapery, hardware, strong beer, cyder, raisins, potters-earth, tobacco-pipes, paper, coverlids, mattresses, hats, stockings, gloves, tin ware, powder and shot, gun-flints, cordage, looking-glasses and glass-ware, thread, haberdash∣ery, and small wares. From Jamaica, Barbadoes, and the Leeward Islands, they have sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, chocolate, negroes, and silver. From New-England, New-York, and Pensylva∣nia, wheat flour, wheat being very backward in the Carolinas; and hardwares and wine, from Ma∣deira, and the other islands in the Western Ocean. The quantity of rice which Carolina produces is daily increasing, as indeed are all the other branches of its commerce; for which reason, we shall not
<PB N="331" REF="3320"/>
offer any conjectures concerning the quantity of shipping which it employs, or the benefit it is of to its mother-country. Some years ago, the pa∣per-currency of South-Carolina amounted to two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, and that of North to fifty-two thousand. The British money, that circulates among the Carolinians, is very inconsiderable; but they have French and Spanish money, in dollars and pieces of eight.</P>
<P>The English traffic here with the natives for deer, bear, and buffalo skins; for which they give them guns, powder, knives, scissars, look∣ing-glasses, beads, some coarse cloth, and duffils. These are carried on pack-horses five or six hundred miles into the country west of Charles Town; but most of the trade is confined within the limits of the Creek and Cherokee nations, which do not lie above three hundred miles from the coast.</P>
<P>The native animals here are nearly the same as those of Mexico and Florida, which we shall soon have occasion to mention; in particular, they have the urus, which the English improperly call a buf∣falo. The European cattle are vastly increased in this, as in the other plantations: the wool of their sheep is not inferior to the English. There is great plenty of poultry, and other fowls; but manual labour is remarkably dear in this country.</P>
<P>The chief rivers of the Carolinas are, Albemarle River, Pentague, Nense, Cape Fear or Clarendon River, Wateree, Santee, Ashley River, Cooper River, Colliton, Cambahee, and Savannah, which separates South-Carolina from Georgia. The ocean is so shallow near the coast, that a ship of any great burden cannot approach it, except in some few places. There has not yet been found one good harbour in North-Carolina; the best are those of Roanoak, at the mouth of Albemarle River, and Pimlico. In South-Carolina are the harbours of
<PB N="332" REF="3330"/>
Winyaw or George Town, Charles Town, and Port Royal. The chief capes are, Cape Hatteras, Cape Fear, and Cape Carteret.</P>
<P>The method of settling in this pleasant country has hitherto been, to pitch upon a void piece of ground, and either to purchase it at the rate of twenty pounds for one thousand acres, and one shil∣ling quit-rent for every hundred acres, or else pay a penny an acre quit-rent yearly to the proprietors, without purchase-money; the former method is the most common, and the tenure a freehold. The land being laid out, the purchaser builds upon it, raises stock, plants orchards, and makes such com∣modities as when sold procure him slaves, house∣hold-goods, and other conveniences; and after this is done, he may yearly increase his capital, and by industry become rich.</P>
<P>Among the Indian nations behind the Carolinas, the most considerable are the Creeks and Chero∣kees, of whom the men are generally tall, but the women little: they anoint their bodies with oil, and expose them to the sun, which occa∣sions their skins to be of a dark brown: the men paint themselves of various colours, red, blue, yellow, and black; they wear generally a girdle, with a piece of cloth drawn between their legs, and turned over the girdle, both before and behind, which looks something like breeches. The wo∣men wear a kind of petticoat to their knees: both mon and women in the winter wear mantles two yards square, which they wrap round their bodies, as the Romans did their toga, generally keeping their arms bare. They are very healthful, and have hardly any diseases, except those occasioned by drinking rum, and the small-pox; those who do not drink are exceeding long-lived. Their food, instead of bread, is Indian corn, boiled and seasoned, like hasty-pudding; and this is called
<PB N="333" REF="3340"/>
hommony: they also boil venison, and make broth of it, and eat all manner of flesh. They are a ge∣nerous good-natured people, and very humane to strangers; patient in want and pain, slow to an∣ger, and not easily provoked; but when they are thoroughly incensed, they are implacable; very quick of apprehension, and gay of temper; their public conferences shew them to be men of ge∣nius, and they have a natural eloquence.</P>
<P>Carolina was the last country in America planted by the English, after Sir Walter Raleigh's unfortu∣nate attempt to settle colonies there in the reign of queen Elizabeth. It seems to have been entirely overlooked, till the restoration of Charles II. The ministry being informed, that Carolina would pro∣duce wine, oil, and silk, and almost every thing that England wanted, procured a patent or grant to themselves, dated the 24th of March 1663, of great part of this coast; the grantees being Edward earl of Clarendon, lord-chancellor; George, duke of Albemarle, the general; William, lord Cra∣ven; John, lord Berkley; the lord Anthony Ash∣ley Cooper; Sir George Carteret; Sir William Colleton; and their heirs. These proprietors, however, did little towards planting it, until the year 1670, when lord Ashley struck out a whimsi∣cal kind of government for the colony, erecting a palatine or sovereign, with a council to be a check upon him; which involved them in perpetual quarrels, and almost destroyed the plantation, as soon as it was settled; to prevent which, they were at length obliged to sell their shares to the crown; and it is now a royal government, only the an∣cestor of the earl of Granville thought fit to re∣tain his seventh share. The present governor of North-Carolina is William Tryon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and of the South, lord Charles Greville Montague.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="3350"/>
Both North and South Carolina are divided into counties, and these again into parishes or town ships.</P>
<P>The first planters in Albemarle county, were wards the north, upon what is called Albemarle River; but most of them afterwards removed, for conveniency, to Ashley River. This county is intersected with rivers, on the banks of which dwell many Indians. South of Albemarle is Cla∣rendon county, the Indians of which are the most barbarous of any in the province. These two counties form what is properly called the govern∣ment of North-Carolina; and are in a way at pre∣sent of being greatly improved, and of rivalling, if not exceeding, South-Carolina. The tobacco which North-Carolina produces is by the inhabi∣tants sold to the Virginians, who send it to Eng∣land.</P>
<P>Craven county is inhabited, besides English, by a considerable number of French families. It lies upon the borders of Congaree or Santee River, which divides South from North-Carolina, and sends ten members to the assembly.</P>
<P>South of this lies Berkley county, containing the two fine rivers of Cooper and Ashley. Upon a neck of land, between these two rivers, stands Charles Town, the capital of the province. Ash∣ley River is navigable for ships twenty miles above the town, and for near forty for boats and petti∣augers, or large canoes. Charles Town is the great mart of the province; but no ships of above two hundred tons can pass its bar. Its neighbour∣hood may vie for beauty with any country in the world; and a little expence would make its fortifi∣cations strong, ornamental, and useful. At present it stands as fair as any city to become the capital of North-America. Some of its houses are brick, others of wood, but all of them handsome and elegant;
<PB N="335" REF="3360"/>
and the church is the most magnificent of any pro∣testant one on the continent of America. The French, the presbyterians, and the quakers, have all their several places of worship. Here the go∣vernor resides, the assembly sits, the courts of ju∣dicature are held, and the business of the province is transacted. Dorchester is another thriving town in this district.</P>
<P>South of Berkley county lies that of Colliton, the north-east parts of which are full of Indians. The two chief rivers of this county are North-Edistow and South-Edistow, the banks of which are full of thriving plantations; and on those of North-Edistow lies Wilton, or New-London, built under the direction of a Swiss gentleman, call∣ed Luberbuller.</P>
<P>Granville county is the most southerly of any in Carolina, and lies along the river Savannah. In this county is a Swiss settlement called Purrys∣burgh, and the river and harbour of Port-Royal, which is one of the finest in all America. Though it was the latest settled, on account of its neigh∣bourhood to the Spaniards, it is now the most pro∣mising of any in South-Carolina. The Vaudois, at Purrysburgh, apply themselves, with great dili∣gence and success, to the culture of silk.</P>

<HEAD>GEORGIA.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1732, a number of public-spirited gentlemen, taking into consideration the vast be∣nefit that might arise from the tract of land lying between the Savannah river and the river Alata∣maha, which is contained in Charles the Second's charter, and undoubtedly belonged to England, formed a scheme of making it subservient to many noble purposes, by erecting it into a bulwark for our southern colonies against the Spaniards; of
<PB N="336" REF="3370"/>
of producing great benefits to the mother-country but, above all, of giving employment to vast num¦bers of people who were burthensome at home to their friends and parishes; and petitioned the king for a charter, which was accordingly granted them This charter, which was dated that year, consti∣tuted them a corporation, by the name of Trus∣tees for establishing a colony in Georgia, includ∣ing all that country situated in South-Carolina, which lies from the most northern stream of the Savannah river, along the coast, to the most southern stream of the Alatamaha, and west from the heads of the said rivers respectively, in a direct line, to the South-Sea. The corporation was vested with all the necessary powers, for the term of twenty-one years from the date of the charter; particularly, to collect benefactions for fitting out the emigrants, and supporting them, till their houses could be built, and their lands cleared. General Oglethorpe, one of the trustees, a gentle∣man of unbounded benevolence and public spirit, commanded the first embarkation to Georgia, to whom the Creek nation voluntarily relinquished their right to all the lands lying between the above-mentioned rivers, which they did not use themselves. Upon this, Mr. Oglethorpe laid out the town of Savannah; and erected several forts, to cover the colony against any hostile attempts of the Spaniards or Indians. In the year 1734, a con∣siderable number of protestant Saltzburghers went over, who, with others of their countrymen, who followed, were settled in a town on the Savannah, which they called Ebenezer; and, by their habits of industry and sobriety, they soon became a consi∣derable settlement. In 1734, another embarka∣tion, consisting of three hundred men, one hun∣dred and ten women, one hundred and two boys, and eighty-three girls, arrived from England, most
<PB N="337" REF="3380"/>
of them at the public expence. In 1735, one hundred and sixty Scotch Highlanders, all able-bo∣died men, went over, and settled themselves upon Alatamaha River, sixteen miles by water from the island of St. Simon. They gave the name of Da∣rien to a small fort they built there, and that of New-Inverness to a small town they afterwards added to it. In February 1736, Mr. Oglethorpe, with about three hundred passengers on board two ships, anchored in the road of Savannah, and soon after laid the foundations of the town and fort of Frederica. Besides the private benefactions received by the trustees during the term of their charter, large supplies were granted by parliament. In 1739, a specimen of Georgian raw silk was exhibited in London, which the merchants, who dealt in that commodity, declared to be as good as any raw silk that came from Italy, and worth at least twenty shillings per pound. In 1742, about five or six thousand Spaniards and Indians invaded Georgia, from St. Augustine, in about fifty vessels of all kinds; but were repulsed by general Oglethorpe, at the head of the English forces, and a small bo∣dy of Indians, under Tomo Chichi's son. From that time it remained undisturbed, but not out of danger from the Spaniards, till the reduction of St. Augustine, and the cession not only of that town, but of all Florida, by the last peace.</P>
<P>Whatever might be the cause, it is certain, this infant colony drooped and languished from the year 1742, till Mr. Ellis was appointed governor; but under his administration, it became again of such importance, that his present majesty, upon removing him to another government, rewarded him with a handsome present of money for his ad∣ministration of that of Georgia.</P>
<P>Though some parts of Georgia are less proper for cultivation than others, it is universally allowed
<PB N="338" REF="3390"/>
to be a rich and delicious country in general, pro∣ducing Indian corn, oats, barley, potatoes, pump∣kins, melons, cucumbers, green peas, and garden∣beans, with sallading of all kinds, throughout the year. Nectarines, plumbs, and peaches grow here in great abundance, and might, by cultivation, be rendered equal, if not superior, to any in Europe. The grapes grow wild, and are ripe in June; and English apple and pear trees, and sometimes apri∣cot trees, agree with the soil. The white and black mulberry afford excellent nourishment for the silk worms, the propagation of which was one of the great inducements for settling the colony. Oranges and olives thrive, especially in the southern parts, to the greatest perfection. Their chief tim∣ber trees are oaks, of which they have six or seven kinds, pines, hickery, cedar, cypress, walnut, sassa∣fras, beech trees, and many others, for which the Europeans have no names; besides a great variety of flowering shrubs.</P>
<P>Georgia produces variety of game, from the be∣ginning of November to March; such as a small kind of woodcocks and partridges, turkies weigh∣ing from twenty to thirty pounds, turtle-doves, wild-geese, ducks, teal, widgeons, with great quan∣tities of wild pigeons; not to mention other birds, little known in Europe. In the summer-time the inhabitants kill deer, and in winter ducks. They have likewise the possom, or, as they call it, the opossom, which shuts up its young in a false belly, and are said to be excellent food, as well as racoons. Tygers are very common in this country, and bears, whose cubs eat like young pigs. Their woods abound also with wild cattle, and wolves and snakes; but none of the last are venemous, ex∣cept the rattle-snake, for the bite of which the na∣tives have a ready and infallible cure. Their rivers are pestered with sharks and alligators; but, at the
<PB N="339" REF="3400"/>
same time, their coasts are stored with trout, mullet, whitings, and a vast variety of other fish, which are both cheap and good. They have vast quan∣tities of oysters; but they are not so delicious as those of England. They have likewise clams, muscles, and very large prawns.</P>
<P>There are several islands on the coast of this co∣lony; the chief are Amelia, Cumberland, and St. Simon's Island. The first, lying seven leagues to the north of St. Augustine, is about two miles broad, and thirteen long. The second, lying about twenty-one miles south of Frederica, forms the in∣let of Amelia Sound, which it commands, by means of a fort called Fort William, and has fine springs of water. The third, lying near the northern mouth of the Alatamaha, is said to be a∣bout three miles in breadth, and forty-five in length. In the middle of this island stands Frederica, which is well fortified, and has a regular magistracy.</P>
<P>The town of Savannah lies ten miles up the river of that name, where it forms a half moon, and where ships, that draw ten or twelve feet water, may ride for a mile, within ten yards of the bank. Opposite to it is an island of very rich pasturage. The river is pretty wide, and the water fresh; and from the key of the town, you see the whole course of it towards the sea, with the island Tybec, which forms the mouth of the river; and, the other way, you see the river for about sixty miles up into the country. Savannah and Frederica are now considerable towns.</P>
<P>When the property of Carolina was purchased by his late majesty, orders were issued for building eleven towns here and in Carolina; each of which was to have a district of twenty thousand acres of land square, to be divided into shares of five acres for each man, woman, or child of one family, which was to be augmented, as the planters should
<PB N="340" REF="3410"/>
be in a condition to cultivate a larger quantity: each town was also to be formed into a parish, the extent whereof was to be about six miles round; and, as soon as the parish contained one hundred masters of families, it was qualified to send two members to the assembly of the province, and to enjoy the same privileges as any of the other pro∣vinces: the ground round each town, being mark∣ed out, was to belong in common to all the inha∣bitants, till shared out to each of them: there were to be three hundred acres of land near each town to be common for ever, without being charged with rent; and no person, by virtue of any former grant, was to take possession of any land within six miles of each town: the rent payable for every hundred acres, after ten years, was to be four shillings a-year; and to every European servant, whether male or female, fifty acres of land were also to be distributed, free of all rent, for ten years. Some progress has been made in these projected improvements. The present governor of Georgia is James Wright, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></P>

<HEAD>FLORIDA.</HEAD>
<P>Florida, which was ceded to Great-Britain by the late treaty of peace, and, including a part of Louisiana, is now divided into the govern∣ments of East and West Florida, terminates to the south on the Gulph of Mexico; to the north, on the Apalachian and Cherokee mountains, or the Great Lakes; to the east, on Georgia, the Atlantic Ocean, the Channel of Bahama, and the Gulph of Florida; and, to the west, its bound∣aries are, a line drawn along the middle of the ri∣ver Mississippi, from its source to the river Iber∣ville, and from thence, by a line drawn along the middle of that river and the Lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain, to the sea. It is of a vast extent,
<PB N="341" REF="3420"/>
stretching, it is said, near one thousand miles in length; but its breadth varies greatly, a considera∣ble part of it consisting of a peninsula, which grows gradually narrower, till it terminates in a point.</P>
<P>Florida, properly so called, was first discovered in 1497, by John Cabot, a Venetian mariner, in the service of Henry VII. King of England. It was more compleatly discovered in the year 1512 by Juan Ponce de Leon, a Spaniard, who gave it the name of Florida, because it was first seen in Easter, called Pasqua de Flores, in the language of his country; or, as Herrera alledges, because it was covered with flowers, and the most beauti∣ful blossoms.</P>
<P>A country so extensive must vary somewhat in point of air and climate; but it may, upon the whole, be called very warm, though the great heats in the southern parts are much allayed by the cool breezes from the sea; and such as are more inland, towards the north, feel a little of the roughness of the north-west wind, which, more or less, diffuses its chilling breath over the whole continent of North-America, carrying frost and snow many degrees more to the southward in these regions, than the north-east wind does in ours.</P>
<P>On the American continent the winters are cold and severe, as far as 34 or 35 degrees of north la∣titude, which is farther to the south than the Streights of Gibraltar in Europe, and vast shoals of ice are seen floating in the sea, which is frequently frozen to a small distance from the shore, in the latitude of 44 or 45 degrees north, which are the same parallels under which the southern parts of France lie. This difference in the climate may perhaps, in a great measure, be accounted for, by considering the amazing extent of uncultivated land covered with forests, and intermixed with vast lakes and marshes, over which the north wind in America blows. The air, however, is pure and
<PB N="342" REF="3430"/>
wholesome, as evidently appears from the size, vigour, and longevity of the Floridan Indians, in all which respects they far exceed the Mexicans.</P>
<P>The soil, except on the sea coast, is rich and fertile, producing frequently two or three crops of Indian corn in the year, and might, with pro∣per cultivation, be made to bear every sort of grain. Here are all kinds of timber and fruit trees, especially pines, laurels, palms, cedars, cy∣press, and chesnut trees, which grow to an ex∣traordinary length and size, and, with the oaks, afford nourishment to swine: but the wood most prized, and in greatest plenty, is the sassafras, of which considerable quantities are exported. Excel∣lent limes and prunes also grow here in great abun∣dance, with vines of various sorts, and cotton trees, hemp, flax, pulse, roots, and herbs; and there is no scarcity of game, fowl, and fish, where sufficient industry is exerted to procure these gifts of nature. The root mendihoca, of which the cassava flour and bread are made, is very com∣mon; and there is a kind of grain, like our oats, that shoots up spontaneously in marshy places, and by the sides of rivers. Of the fruits, there is one called tuna, so exquisite and wholesome, when ripe, that among the Europeans it goes by the name of the cordial julep. Excellent beef, veal, and mutton are the produce of the country, together with horses fit for draught and carriage, so cheap, that they may be purchased for the value of a crown in European commodities. The other pro∣ducts of Florida are ambergrease, cochineal, in∣digo, silk-grass; amethysts, turquoises, lapis la∣zuli, and other precious stones; copper, quick∣silver, pit-coal, iron ore, and a kind of stone-pitch, called copea, which the Spaniards used as tar for their shipping: pearls also are found on the coasts of Florida.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="3440"/>
Of the mountains, the most considerable are the Apalachian, which divide Carolina, and the rest of the British plantations, from Florida. A vast num∣ber of noble rivers pass through this country, most of which rise in the Apalachian mountains, and fall into the Gulph of Mexico, or the Atlantic Ocean. The chief are the Mississippi, the Ohio, the Coza or Coussa, and the river St. John. The Missi∣ssippi, which the French call St. Louis, is, in many respects, the finest river in the world. It runs a very long course, free from shoals and cataracts, and navi∣gable within sixty leagues of its source. The channel is every where deep, and the current gentle, except at a certain season, when, like the Nile, it overflows. Its banks are adorned with a delightful variety of meadows and groves, inhabited by a vast number of Indian tribes. What renders the Mississippi more considerable, is the number of large and navigable rivers that fall into it, both from the eastward and westward: of the first, Mr. de la Sale, in the relation he presented to count Frontenac of his voyage on that river, affirms, there are six or seven, each three hundred leagues in length; of which the most con∣siderable are, the Oubache or River of St. Jerome, the river Illinois, the Cherokee river, and the Ohio, on which stands Fort Pitt and Pittsburgh, a vast river, which runs along the back of New-York, Maryland, and Virginia: in the Indian language it signifies a fair river, and is navigable six hun∣dred miles, traversing the most beautiful and fruit∣ful countries in the world, and receiving ten or twelve rivers, besides innumerable brooks: of the rivers that fall into the Mississippi, on the west side, the chief is the Missbure. The Coza or Coussa, which the French call Mobille, is a very large river, which has its source in the Apalachian mountains, and falls into the Gulph of Mexico one hundred miles south of the town of Manhela, or Mobille. The river of
<PB N="344" REF="3450"/>
St. John is a noble navigable river, which rises also in the Apalachian mountains, and, running paral∣lel to the Alatamaha, falls into the Atlantic Ocean, not far from St. Augustine.</P>
<P>There are a great many lakes in Florida, among which those of Pontchartrain and Maurepas, men∣tioned above, are none of the least considerable.</P>
<P>The principal bays are, St. Bernard's, Ascen∣sion, Mobille, Pensacola, Dauphin, Joseph, Apa∣laxy, Spiritu Sancto, and Charles Bay.</P>
<P>The chief capes are, Cape Blanco, Samblas, Anclote, St. Augustine, and Cape Florida, at the extremity of the peninsula.</P>
<P>Louisiana, most of which was ceded to us by the late peace, and now constitutes the greater part of the government of West-Florida, bounded by the Mississippi on the west, and by East-Florida, Georgia, and Carolina, on the east; and extending from the Lake of the Illinois, or, rather, from the source of the Mississippi on the north, to the Gulph of Mexico on the south, is a very pleasant fruitful country, being watered by a number of rivers, the frequent overflowings of which contribute not a little to its fertility. Nothing is more delightful than the meadows, which are fit for seed of all kinds. In some parts, the soil yields three or four crops in the year; for the winter consists only in heavy rains, without any nipping frosts. Almost all sorts of trees which Europe affords are to be found here, besides a variety of others unknown to us, and some of them of great value; such as lofty cedars, which distil a gum that is said to excel all the noblest European perfumes; and cotton-trees, which are of a prodigious height. The whole country abounds with an infinite variety of game, fowl, cattle, and indeed every thing that life can desire. The woods and lakes, both here and
<PB N="345" REF="3460"/>
in East Florida, are full of deer, goats, lions, leo∣pards, wolves, hares, rabbits, elks, buffaloes, pan∣thers, bears, wild cats, beavers, otters, foxes, ra∣coons, squirrels, and martins. The rivers abound with fish, and also with snakes and allegators. As for the winged species, here are turkies, par∣tridges, parrots, pelicans, bustards, pheasants, pi∣geons, turtles, blackbirds, thrushes, herons, storks, cranes, snipes, eagles, hawks, swans, geese, ducks, and many others, some of which have their plumage elegantly variegated. The natives, who are di∣vided into innumerable tribes, the most considera∣ble of whom are, the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, Chickesaws, and Natches, are of an olive complec∣tion, their bodies robust, and finely proportioned: both sexes go generally naked, except only a deer∣skin round their waist. They stain their skins with the juice of plants. Their hair is black and long, and they have a method of twisting it about their heads so as to make it look very graceful. Their weapons are bows and arrows, which they manage with great dexterity: the strings of their bows are made of the sinews of stags, and their arrows are pointed with the teeth of fishes, or sharp∣ened stones. The women are very handsome, and well shaped, and withal so active, that they will swim across broad rivers with their children on their backs, or climb with surprizing agility to the tops of the highest trees. In religion, they are bi∣goted idolaters, worshipping the sun and moon, and bearing an extreme aversion to all Christians; which, indeed, is not to be wondered at, since the horrid cruelties exercised by the Spaniards on the natives of the island of Cuba, and Mexico, could not fail to excite the utmost abhorrence and dread of them in those savages, instead of recommending their religion, which could not be called Christiani∣ty, though it might be genuine popery.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="3470"/>
There are but few European settlements of any consequence, either in East or West Florida. In the former, the principal place is St. Augustine, standing on the eastern coast of the peninsula, about seventy leagues from the Gulph of Florida and Channel of Bahama, thirty south of the river Alatamaha, or Alatumacha, and forty-seven from the town and river of Savannah. It is situated in lat. 30 north, and lies along the shore, at the bot∣tom of a hill, in the form of a parallelogram, the streets cutting each other at right angles. The port is formed by an island and a long point of land, al∣most divided from the continent by a river, which falls into the sea two miles south of the town. About a mile to the northward of the town stands the castle, defended by four bastions, and pretty strong. The entrance into the port lies between the island and the point of land, and is about one mile and a quarter over, but very shallow, as is in∣deed most part of the coast of Florida.</P>
<P>The next place to St. Angustine, at least when the Spaniards were possessed of this country, was St. Matthio, situated about fifteen leagues to the north of the former, towards Georgia.</P>
<P>Mr. Rolles, a public-spirited gentleman, and member in the British parliament for Barnstaple in Devonshire, having had a grant of a tract of land in this country, hath planned a settlement upon the river St. John, to which he hath already car∣ried over a considerable number of adventurers.</P>
<P>Another settlement has been established here by one Dr. Trummel, at Mosquito harbour, not far from the Channel of Bahama.</P>
<P>In East Florida and Louisiana, the only places belonging to the English, worth mentioning, are, Mobille, and Pensacola. The first lies on the river of that name, about one hundred miles from its mouth, and seventy from the Mississippi: though but a small place, it is to be hoped, now it is in
<PB N="347" REF="3480"/>
the hands of the English, it will soon become more considerable. The soil of the neighbouring coun∣try is said to be but indifferent, and the harbour in∣convenient, yet there is an easy entrance from it into the Gulph of Mexico, and consequently an opportu∣nity of carrying on a lucrative trade with the Spani∣ards. Its situation is also advantageous for the peltry trade with the Indians, the river being large, extend∣ing far within land, and yielding, as some say, pearls, which are found in a sort of shell-fish, between a muscle and an oyster, by the antients called pinna.</P>
<P>Pensacola stands on the west side of the bay to which it gives name, about ten leagues east of Dauphin Isle, at the mouth of the river Mobille. The harbour is the best upon all this coast of the gulph, being large, safe from all winds, with four fathom water at the entrance, and seven or eight farther in. A fine river enters the bay on the east side of the harbour, which comes about one hundred miles out of the country, after being formed by the junction of two other rivers. The town is not considerable at present; but it is pro∣bable, from the commodiousness of its situation and harbour, it will soon make a better figure. Be∣sides these two small towns, the English have many forts and harbours among the Indians on the in∣land lakes and rivers.</P>
<P>New-Orleans, which was the only place of any note in Louisiana that was not ceded to the Eng∣lish by the late treaty of peace, and which the French have since yielded up to the Spaniards, is situated between the eastern shore of the Mississip∣pi and the Fish River, near the lakes Pontchar∣train and Maurepas, and about eighteen leagues from the sea. It is a pretty large handsome town, but subject to most ruinous inundations; besides, the navigation, according to Charlevoix, between it and the sea, is so very difficult, that none but small vessels and flat-bottomed boats can get up to it,
<PB N="348" REF="3490"/>
there being a shelf that lies before the mouth of the river, where there is not above ten feet water. He tells us, that the channel of it is twice as large as that of the Seine, keeping the same breadth all along; and that the stream is ra∣pid, though it be full of windings and turnings for nine hundred leagues.

<HEAD>NEW-MEXICO, including CALIFORNIA,</HEAD>
<P>New-Mexico, so called because of its being dis∣covered later than Old-Mexico, is bounded on the north by high mountains, beyond which is a coun∣try altogether unknown; by Louisiana on the east; by New-Spain on the south; and on the west by the Gulph of California, and the Rio Colorado; extending, it is said, above one hundred miles from east to west, and about nine hundred from south to north; but the twentieth part of the country, within these limits, is neither cultivated nor inhabited, either by Spaniards or Indians. As it lies in the midst of the temperate zone, the climate, in general, is very pleasant; the sum∣mers, though very warm, are neither sultry nor un∣wholesome; and the winters, though pretty sharp, are far from being insupportable, and, for the most part, clear and healthy.</P>
<P>The greatest encomiums are lavished on the fer∣tility of the soil, the richness of the mines, and the variety of valuable commodities produced in this country. It is said to be beautifully diversified with fields, meadows, rising grounds, and rivers; abounding with fruit and timber-tees, turquoises, emeralds, and other precious stones, mines of gold and silver, a great variety of wild and tame cattle, fish, and fowls. Upon the whole, we may safely
<PB N="349" REF="3500"/>
affirm, that New-Mexico is among the pleasantest, richest, and most plentiful countries in America, or any other part of the world. There are few great or navigable rivers in it: the most conside∣rable are, the Rio Solado and Rio del Norte, which, with several smaller streams, fall into the Gulph of Mexico. On the coast of the gulph are divers bays, ports, and creeks, which might be easily converted into excellent harbours, if the Spa∣niards were possessed of any portion of that com∣mercial spirit which animates the other maritime nations of Europe.</P>
<P>The Spanish writers tell us, that New-Mexico is inhabited by a great variety of Indian nations or tribes, totally unconnected with each other; but the principal are the Apaches, a brave, warlike, resolute people; fond of liberty, and the inveterate enemies of tyranny and oppression. About the close of the last century, thinking themselves ag¦grieved by the Spanish government, they made a general insurrection, and did a great deal of mis∣chief; but were at last obliged to submit, and have since been curbed by stronger garrisons. Most of the natives are now Christians. When the Spaniards first entered this country, they found the natives well cloathed, their lands cultivated, their villages neat, and their houses built with stone. Their flocks also were numerous, and they lived more comfortably than most of the other savages of America. They were so skilful in shooting, that with an arrow they could strike all the grain out of an ear of corn, without breaking it, at a considerable distance. As to religion, they were idolaters, and worshipped the sun and moon; but whether they offered human sacrifices, we are not sufficiently informed.</P>
<P>As to the number of the provinces of this coun∣try, we can advance nothing certain; some writers
<PB N="350" REF="3510"/>
making them only five, others fifteen, eighteen, twenty, and twenty-five; but adding no descrip∣tion, either of them or the towns contained in them, excepting the capital, Santa Fé, which, we are told, stands near the source of the Rio del Nor∣te, in 36°. of north latitude, and about one hundred and thirty leagues from the gulph: that it is a well built, handsome, rich town, and the seat of a bishop, suffragan of Mexico, as well as of the governor of the province, who is subordinate to the viceroy of Mexico, or New-Spain.</P>
<P>California, the most northern of all the Spanish dominions on the continent of America, towards the Pacific Ocean, was for a long time supposed to be an island; but, at last, was found to be only a peninsula, issuing from the north coasts of Ame∣rica, and extending into the Pacific Ocean eight hundred miles, from Cape Sebastian, in 43°. 30′. north latitude, towards the south-east, as far as Cape St. Lucar, in 22°. 32′. north latitude. The eastern coast lies nearly parallel with that of Mexi∣co, opposite to it; and the sea between is called the Gulph or Lake of California, or the Vermilion Purple, or Red Sea.</P>
<P>The breadth of the peninsula is very unequal; towards the north it is near two hundred miles broad, but at the south extremity it tapers away, and is scarcely fifty miles over.</P>
<P>California was first discovered to be a peninsula by Father Caino, or Kino, a German Jesuit, who landed in it from the island of Sumatra, and passed into New-Mexico, without crossing any other wa∣ter than Rio Azul, or the Blue River, about north latitude 35°. The more southern part was known to the Spaniards soon after the discovery of Mexi∣co, for Cortes discovered it in 1535; but they did not till lately penetrate far into it, contenting them∣selves with the pearl-fishery on the coast. Our
<PB N="351" REF="3520"/>
Sir Francis Drake landed there in 1578, and took possession of California, for his mistress queen Eli∣zabeth, by the name of New-Albion; the king of the country actually investing him with its sove∣reignty, and presenting him with his crown of beautiful feathers; the people too, thinking the English more than men, began to sacrifice to them, but were restrained. Though the English have never attempted to settle any colonies here, yet they seem to have a better right than the Spani∣ards, if ever they should think fit to lay claim to it.</P>
<P>Though it lies, for the most part, in the tempe∣rate zone, there are great heats in the summer on the coast, but the inland parts are very temperate; and though the winters are pretty severe, they are very healthy. The soil is various: to the westward of the river Collorado it is level and fruitful, inter∣spersed with delightful woods, cool refreshing springs and rivulets, and the most enchanting pas∣tures and meadows; but, in other places, the coun∣try is mostly wild, rugged, and barren, over-run with rocks, sands, and mountains, and without a suffi∣cient quantity of water to make them yield either corn or pasture: some of the mountains, however, yield a great variety, both of fruit and forest-trees, particularly a kind of tree, that bears a fruit called miscales, which is gathered all the year round; with fine pistachios, figs of different colours, and a tree called by the natives palo santo, which bears not only a pleasant fruit, but an excellent perfume. There is a shrub-tree named pitahaya, which bears no leaves, but a very delicious fruit, being rich and well tempered, with a grateful acid. It re∣sembles a horse-chesnut externally; but the pulp comes nearer a fig than any other fruit: in some it is white, in others yellow, and sometimes red. Here also are pompions and water-melons, of a pro∣digious
<PB N="352" REF="3530"/>
size, a pleasant sort of fruit called xicanes, grapes, with a great variety of other fruits, and no less than fourteen sorts of grain. The soil, in many places, is so rich, that the plants bear fruit three times a-year.</P>
<P>As to quadrupeds, here are deer, of which two kinds are peculiar to the country; a par∣ticular species of sheep, buffaloes, beavers or animals much resembling them, a peculiar spe∣cies of wild dogs, lions, wild cats, and many other wild beasts. The horses, mules, asses, oxen, sheep, hogs, goats, and other quadru∣peds, that have been imported hither from Spain and Mexico, multiply exceedingly. Of the two species of deer peculiar to California, that called taye by the natives is greatly esteemed, and eat with the same relish as venison by our epicures. Of the feathered kind here is a great variety; in particular, Vanegas tells us, that the coast is plentifully stocked with peacocks, bustards, geese, cranes, vultures, gulls, larger than geese, cormo∣rants, mews, quails, linnets, larks, nightingales, and many other species.</P>
<P>With respect to fish, the multitude and variety with which the Gulph of California, the Pacific O∣cean, and the rivers are supplied, is almost incredible. Salmon, turbot, barbel, skate, mackarel, pilchards, thornbacks, soals, bonettas, and many other species, are caught here, with very little trouble; together with pearl-oysters, common delicious oysters, cray∣fish, lobsters, and a variety of exquisite shell-fish. However, of the testaceous kind, the most remark∣able and abundant is the tortoise, caught in the ut∣most plenty upon the coasts. On the South-Sea coast also is a shell-fish, the most beautiful that can be imagined, being of an elegant vivid blue colour, like the lapis lazuli.</P>
<P>California affords one of the richest pearl-fisheries in the world, and is likewise thought to have mines.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="3540"/>
As to insects, they swarm here, as in most warm countries; yet they are neither so numerous or troublesome as in some, on account of the dry∣ness of the soil and climate.</P>
<P>There are two considerable rivers in California, viz. Rio Collorado, and Rio du Carmel, with se∣veral smaller streams, and fine ports, bays, creeks, and roads, both on the east and west side, which is the reason of its having been formerly so much frequented by our privateers in the South-Seas.</P>
<P>We had almost forgot to mention a species of manna found here, being a juice which exsudates from a tree, and which is as sweet as sugar, tho' not so white, and pleasant to the eye.</P>
<P>In the heart of the country there are plains of salt, quite firm, and clear as crystal, which, consi∣dering the vast quantities of fish of all sorts found here, might be of great advantage to any civilized nation that should possess themselves of the coun∣try.</P>
<P>There is a great variety of savage tribes in Ca∣lifornia. Those that live on the east side of the peninsula are said to be great enemies to the Spa∣niards; but, in the other parts, they seem to be ve∣ry hospitable to all strangers. The inland coun∣try, especially towards the north, is populous. The Indians, in most respects, resemble those we have already taken notice of in other parts of A∣merica. They have a great many absurd, ridicu∣lous customs, opinions, and superstitions. They go almost naked, and pay great deference to their priests, who also pretend to be magicians and phy∣sicians. All their houshold-furniture and property consists of the implements of fishing and hunting, or war, in which most of their time is spent. Ex∣cept in the two great empires of Mexico and Peru, where there was a greater intercourse and union, and consequently more art and ingenuity, more inven∣tion,
<PB N="354" REF="3550"/>
policy, and refinement, all the other nations of America differ only in the modes of barbarity; being nearly similar in capacity and disposition. Even among these savages, a love of ornament prevails more among the women than the men; this is a female weakness that seems common to all countries. Here the women are set off with pearls, and all the other splendid trinkets, which nature affords, or their ingenuity can invent. Father To∣raval tells us, that the Californians display great ingenuity in their nets: "I can affirm, (says he) that of all the nets I ever saw in Europe and New-Spain, none are comparable to them, either in whiteness, the mixture of colours, or the strength and workmanship, in which they represent a vast variety of figures."</P>
<P>It is but lately that the Spaniards had any settle∣ment on this peninsula; and what they have is on∣ly a village, near Cape St. Lucar, at the south end of it, which they call California. The Manilla ships touch here sometimes, in their course to Acapulco; and the place is likely to become consi∣derable in time, in consequence of the pearl-trade carried on with the natives.</P>
<P>There are many small islands on the coast of this peninsula, both in the South-Sea and the Gulph; and it is observed, that Capt. Dampier proposed seeking a north-west passage, by doubling Cape Blanco, at the northern extremity of California.</P>
<P>The Jesuits, before their suppression, were taxed with the design of laying the foundation of an in∣dependant hierarchy and empire here, as well as in Paraguay.</P>

<HEAD>OLD-MEXICO, or NEW-SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>Old-Mexico, or New-Spain, lies between 7°. 30′. and 30°. 40′. north latitude; and is bounded on
<PB N="355" REF="3560"/>
the south-south-east by the Isthmus of Darien, or Panama; and on the north-west by New-Mexi∣co; the North and South Seas washing it on both sides. Along the Pacific Ocean it stretches above two thousand miles, and the coast towards the North Sea cannot extend less than one thousand six hundred miles; but the breadth is very unequal. Towards the north-west it is said to be between six and seven hundred miles over, while, towards the south-east, the breadth does not exceed sixty miles. It is governed by a viceroy, and divided into the three audiences of Guadalajara, Mexico, and Guatimala; the first of which contains the provinces of Cinaloa, Culiacan, Chiamettan, Xa∣lisco, Guadalajara Proper, Xacatecas, and New-Bis∣cay; the second, those of Mechoacan, Mexico Proper, Panuco, Tlascala, Guaxaca, Tabasco, and Yucatan; and the third, those of Chiapa, Soconus∣ca, Guatimala Proper, Varapaz, Honduras, Ni∣caragua, Costa-Rica, and Veragua.</P>
<P>Though the greater part of Mexico lies within the torrid zone, yet the air is temperate and healthy. As you approach the equinoctial, it necessarily grows hotter; but in no place is the atmosphere heated to such a degree as to render the climate in∣supportable. This arises from the land and sea breezes, which blow alternately; and the great number of lakes and rivers, the vapours from which cool the air, and render it mild, soft, and pleasant. The greatest heats are during the months of February, March, and April, when the sun is seldom obscured by clouds, and the waters are dried up in such a manner, that it is difficult to meet with any in many places. The rainy season begins towards the close of April, and continues un∣til the month of September; being always pre∣ceded by tempests or tornadoes, thunder, light∣ning, and hurricanes, when the wind blows almost
<PB N="356" REF="3570"/>
from every point of the heavens, increasing daily in fury till the month of June, at which time the rain falls as if a second deluge were to ensue. No country under heaven abounds more with grain, delicious fruits, roots, and vegetables; many of which are peculiar to it, or at least to America. Of these the most remarkable are, bamboes, man∣groves, and logwood, which grow on the coasts; red and white cotton-trees, cedars, blood-wood, and maho, of which the natives make ropes and cables; light-wood, of which they make floats, being as light as cork; white-wood, the cabbage∣tree, the calabash, cacao, and venella, which the Spaniards call bexuco or bainilla; plantains, ba∣nanas, pine-apples, sapadillo, avogato pear, mam∣mee, mammee-sapota, grape, prickle, bibby, and other curious fruit-trees; besides which, the Spa∣niards have introduced most of the European fruits. Mexico also produces the poisonous man∣chineel apple, gourds of a prodigious size, melons, silk-grass, tamarinds, and locust-trees; the little, black, white, and borachio sapotoe trees, the last of which takes its name from the inebriating quality of the fruit. To these we may add the grenadillo de China, creeping-plant, and the may-hey, which furnishes the natives with thread for linen and cord∣age, and also a balsam and liquor, which, when fer∣mented, is as pleasant and strong as wine: from this too is distilled a strong spirit, not unlike brandy.</P>
<P>Other valuable productions of New-Spain are, co∣pal, aninie, tacamahaca, caranica, liquid amber, and oil of amber. Balsam of Peru is also found in Mexi∣co, guiacum, china-root, sarsaparilla, and the root mechoacan, which are well known to druggists and apothecaries, and of excellent use in a variety of distempers. Besides the maiz or native grain of Mexico, the Spaniards have introduced the use of barley, wheat, pease, beans, and other grain;
<PB N="357" REF="3580"/>
pulse, roots, and vegetables, which are now com∣mon in every province. Rice grows abundantly, and flourishes extremely, on account of the long wet seasons. Trees are all the year in leaf, blos∣som, or fruit; and every month in the year presents an appearance of spring, summer, and autumn, al∣together.</P>
<P>The most remarkable animals of New-Spain are, the pecarree, a little black short-legged animal, that has some resemblance of a hog, but his navel grows on his back; the waree, like the former, but some∣thing less; the opossum; the moose-deer; the guanoe, of the shape of a lizard, but as big as a man's leg; the flying-squirrel, which has a small body, and a loose skin, which he extends like wings, and is born up by the wind a considerable time; the sloth, which is about the bigness of a spaniel, and feeds on the leaves of trees, but is so long of get∣ting down one tree and up another, that he grows lean on the journey; the armadillo, so named from his shell, resembling armour, in which he can in∣close himself; the racoon, pretty much resembling a badger; the ounce, or tyger-cat; beavers; the manatee, a kind of fish, as big as an ox, and excel∣lent eating; five or six species of tortoises; the gar-fish, which has a sharp bone at the end of his snout like a spear; and the paracood, a fish about an ell long, and well tasted, but unwholesome at some seasons.</P>
<P>Of the feathered kind, the most remarkable are, the macaw, the quam, the curasoe, the cardinal, and the humming-bird.</P>
<P>Among many other reptiles and insects are, the rattle-snake, the migua, and the cochineal-fly. The mi-gua is an insect so small that it cannot easily be discerned, and usually strikes into a man's legs. If it is let alone, it will get deep into the flesh, where it lays a great many nits or eggs, which increase to
<PB N="358" REF="3590"/>
the bigness of a pea; and, if the part is scratched, it immediately festers, and endangers the loss of a limb. The cochineal fly is bred in a fruit, that grows on a shrub about five feet high: when the fruit opens, these insects take wing, and hover a little while over the tree, and then fall down dead on the sheets that are spread for them.</P>
<P>There are some high mountains on the western coast of New-Spain, near the Pacific Ocean, most of which are said to be vulcanos. Several rivers rise in these mountains, and fall some into the Gulph of Mexico, and some into the South-Sea, on both of which there are several capes and bays. Among the bays on the gulph, are those of Cam∣peachy and Honduras.</P>
<P>The principal commodities of New-Spain are, wool, cotton, sugar, silk, cochineal, chocolate, fea∣thers, honey, balsams, drugs, dying woods, salt, tallow, hides, tobacco, ginger, amber, pearls, pre∣cious stones, jasper, porphyry, exquisite marble, and gold and silver.</P>
<P>The gold and silver mines are found in the rocky barren parts of the country. There are several, it is said, of the former; and no fewer than a thou∣sand of the latter. Gold is also found in grains, or dust, in the sands of rivers and torrents. Who∣ever discovers a mine of gold or silver, is at liberty to work it, paying the king a tenth of the pro∣duct, and limiting himself within fifty yards round the place upon which he has fixed. All the silver and gold, dug or found in grains, is entered in the royal exchequer; and it is reported, that, not∣withstanding great quantities are run and conceal∣ed, no less than two millions of silver marks, weigh∣ing eight ounces each, are entered yearly, out of which they coin seven hundred thousand marks, into pieces of eight, half pieces of eight, quarter∣pieces, rials, and half-pieces; the value of the lat∣ter being about three-pence sterling.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="3600"/>
The people of Mexico, and the rest of the Spanish West-Indies, are prohibited trading with any but the subjects of Spain; nor are foreigners suffered to visit their coasts. The traffic of Mexi∣co is one of the richest and most extensive in the world; for they trade with the Philippine Islands, near the coast of China, through the South-Sea or Pacific Ocean; with Peru and Chili, through the same sea; and with Old-Spain, and the Spanish islands and settlements on that side, through the North-Sea and Atlantic Ocean; all which trades are held lawful. There is also a very considerable smuggling, or clandestine trade, carried on by the Spaniards and Indians in America, with the Eng∣lish, French, and Dutch.</P>
<P>The whole of the trade between Old-Spain and the Spanish dominions in America, is carried, on by annual ships, usually divided into three classes, the flota, the register ships, and galleons.</P>
<P>The flota is a fleet of three men of war, and fourteen or fifteen merchant-ships, from four hun∣dred to one thousand tons burthen: they are loaded almost with every sort of goods which Europe produces for exportation; all sorts of wool∣lens, linens, silks, velvets, laces, glass, paper, and cutlery; all sorts of wrought iron, watches, clocks, quicksilver for the use of their mines, horse∣furniture, shoes, stockings, books, pictures, milita∣ry stores, wines, fruits, &amp;c. so that all the trading part of Europe are highly interested in the cargo of this fleet. Spain itself sends out little more than the wine and fruit; this, with the freight and commissions to the merchant, and the duty to the king, is almost all the advantage which that king∣dom derives from her commerce with the Indies. This fleet is fitted out at Cadiz, and destined for La Vera Cruz, situated on the gulph in the king∣dom of Mexico: they are not permitted to break
<PB N="360" REF="3610"/>
bulk, on any account, till they arrive there. When all the goods are landed and disposed of at La Ve∣ra Cruz, the fleet takes in the plate, precious stones, cochineal, indigo, cocoa, tobacco, sugar, and hides, which are the returns for Old-Spain. From La Vera Cruz they sail to the Havannah, which is the place of their rendezvous, where they meet the gal∣leons. These are another fleet, which carry on all the trade of Terra-Firma, by Carthagena; and of Peru, by Panama and Porto-Bello; in the same manner as the flota serves for New-Spain. When the flota arrives at the Havannah, and joins the galleons and register-ships, which assemble at the same port from all quarters, some of the clean∣est and best sailing vessels are dispatched to Old-Spain, with advice of the contents of these several fleets, as well as with treasure and goods of their own, that the court may judge what indulto or duty is proper to be laid on them, and what convoy is necessary for their safety.</P>
<P>Register-ships are sent out by merchants at Cadiz and Seville, when they judge that goods must be wanted at any particular ports in the West-Indies. Their way is, to petition the council of the Indies for a licence to send a ship of three hundred tons burthen, or under, to that port: they pay for this licence forty or fifty thousand dollars, besides pre∣sents to the officers, in proportion to the con∣nivance necessary to the design; for though the licence runs only to three hundred tons at most, the vessel fitted out is seldom less than six hundred. This ship and cargo are registered at the pretended burthen: it is required too, that a certificate be brought from the king's officer at the port to which she is bound, that she does not exceed the size at which she is registered; all this passes of course. These are what they call register-ships, and by these the trade of Spanish-America has been carried
<PB N="361" REF="3620"/>
on principally for some years past; which practice has been thought as much to the prejudice of their trade, as it is contrary to all their former maxims for carrying it on.</P>
<P>The fleet which is called the galleons consists of∣eight men of war, of five hundred tons each, de∣signed principally to supply Peru with military stores; but, in reality, laden not only with those, but with every other kind of merchandize, on a private account, so as to be in too weak a condi∣tion either to defend themselves, or to protect others. Under the convoy of these are twelve sail of merchant-ships, not inferior to the galleons in burthen. This fleet of the galleons is regulated in much the same manner as the flota; and is destined for the exclusive commerce of Terra firma, and the South-Sea, as the flota is for that of Mexico.</P>
<P>As soon as this galleon fleet arrives at Car∣thagena, expresses are dispatched to Porto-Bello, and to all the adjacent towns, but particularly to Panama, that they may get ready all the treasure, which is deposited there, to meet the galleons at Porto-Bello; at which place all that are con∣cerned in the various branches of this extensive trade assemble. There is no part of the world, where business of such great importance, is ne∣gociated in so short a time; for sometimes in a fortnight the fair is over. During the fair, heaps of wedges and ingots of silver are thrown about upon the wharfs, as things of no value. The display of gold, silver, and precious stones, on one hand, and of the curious workmanship of the va∣rious ingenious fabrics of Europe on the other, is truly astonishing.</P>
<P>The whole trade between the East-Indies and Spanish America, is carried on by one great gal∣leon, which arrives at Acapulio on the South Sea, from the Phillipine Islands, in the month of De∣cember.
<PB N="362" REF="3630"/>
They see no other land in the whole voyage of three thousand leagues, which they per∣form in five months, than the little Ladrones. The ship is laden with all the rich commodities of the East, as cloves, pepper, cinnamon, nutmegs, mace, tea, china, Japan wares, callicoes, plain and painted muslins of every sort, silks, precious stones, rich drugs, Persian carpets, benjamin, camphire, ivory, and gold dust; all which amounts to a pro∣digious value, this one ship having more riches in it than some whole fleets. At the same time the rich ship from Lima comes in, which is computed to bring no less than two millions of pieces of eight in silver, or four hundred and fifty thousand pound sterling. Several other ships from the different ports of Chili and Peru, meet upon the same oc∣casion; and besides the traffic for the Philippine commodities, there is very large dealing for every thing, which these countries have to exchange with one another, as well as for all sorts of European goods. The fair at Acapulco lasts sometimes for thirty days. As soon as the goods are disposed of, the galleon prepares to set out on her voyage to the Philippines, with her returns, chiefly in silver; but with some European goods, and other commo∣dities of America. We speak here as though there were but one vessel in the trade with the Phi∣lippines, and in fact there is only nominally one trading vessel, the galleon itself, of about two thousand tons; but another attends her commonly, as a sort of convoy, which generally carries such a quantity of goods as, in a great measure, disables her from executing that office. The galleon has often one thousand people on board, either interest∣ed in the cargo, or merely as passengers; and there is no trade in which so large profits are made, the captain of the vessel, the pilot, the mate, and even the common sailors, making in one voyage what,
<PB N="363" REF="3640"/>
in their several ranks, may be considered as easy fortunes. The Jesuits, before their suppression, are said to have had the profits of this ship to sup∣port their missions.</P>
<P>New-Spain produces a vast quantity of sugar, especially towards the Gulph of Mexico, and about Guaxaca and Guatimala; so that here are more sugar mills than in any other part of Spanish A∣merica; but the sugar is chiefly consumed in the city of Mexico and the monasteries, in chocolate, sweetmeats, preserves, and confectionary wares; a great deal also is sent from Guaxaca, Guatimala, and other provinces, to Mexico and Panama, and from thence is conveyed by sea to Lima, Guaiaquil, and Baldivia. There is a great trade also in goods manufactured of cotton, and in indigo and cochineal. It is said, the people of Nicaragua and Honduras employ three hundred thousand mules and horses, to carry corn, sugar, cocoa, &amp;c. into the inland provinces, and particularly to the city of Mexico. When the galleons come to Vera Cruz, the number of carriages, men and horses, mules and asses, employed to carry the treasure of the country, with the tobacco, sugar, and other pro∣ductions of Guatimala and Guaxaca, to Vera Cruz, is incredible. The carriage also of the European goods, that come by the galleons, back again to the different parts of the kingdom, is a considera∣ble article of trade; the silver alone brought from Zacatacas is said to employ six thousand mules.</P>
<P>By an article of the last treaty of peace, the king of Spain gives up all claim or right to mo∣lest the English in cutting logwood in the bays of Campeachy and Honduras.</P>
<P>New-Spain is at present inhabited by a mixed people; consisting of the native Indians; the Spa∣niards, and other Europeans; the unmixed de∣scendants of the Spaniards, who are called Creoli;
<PB N="364" REF="3650"/>
the Mestizos, or issue of the Spaniards by Ame∣ricans; the Mestiches, or the issue of such issue; the Terceroons des Indies, or the children of the last, married to Spaniards; and the Quarteroons dez Indies, whose descendants are allowed the same privileges as true Spaniards. The negroes are likewise pretty numerous, being imported from the coast of Africa for various purposes, and many of them admitted to their freedom. The issue of an European and a negro constitutes another distinc∣tion, called Mulatto; besides which, there is a mixed breed of negroes and Indians, which is generally deemed the lowest rank of the people.</P>
<P>There are some tribes of Indians, both in the open country and the mountains, that still preserve their freedom; but most of them are subject to the Spaniards, and have embraced the popish re∣ligion. Among the free Indians are those on the Mosquito shore, where the English have a go∣vernor, and some settlements; these Indians being implacable enemies to the Spaniards, but firm friends and allies to the English. Great numbers of Indians are employed by the Spaniards in work∣ing their gold and silver mines.</P>
<P>These natives in general are tall, clean, well pro∣portioned, and handsome: their complexion is a deep olive, and both sexes have long, black, lank, coarse hair on their heads; but they suffer none on the other parts of their bodies. Some tribes look upon flat noses as a great beauty. Almost all the Mexicans paint their bodies with the figures of va∣rious birds and beasts, and anoint them with oil or fat. Some tribes are cloathed; but the men of others go almost quite naked. The Mexicans, in general, have their noses, lips, ears, necks, and arms, adorned with pearls and other jewels, or trinkets, made of gold, silver, or some other metal. The free Indians are said to be a brave, generous,
<PB N="365" REF="3660"/>
humane people, except in the article of human sa∣crifices; but the others are become cruel, treache∣rous, cowardly, mean, thievish, and altogether vi∣cious. Though the free Indians discover a great veneration for the sun and moon, they have no image of them, but a great many of human form. They cultivate but little soil, and live chiefly by hunting and fishing. Besides all the domestic of∣fices, the women spin, weave, and dress cotton and linen cloths, for their own and their husbands apparel.</P>
<P>As to the Spaniards of Mexico, Gage tells us, that he was amazed to find the clergy, both secular and regular, rivaling the quality in their dress and luxurious way of life; they drank, they gamed, they swore, they wenched, and made a jest of their vows of poverty, getting money enough, many of them, to return to Old-Spain, and purchase bishop∣rics. It is frequent, he says, for a priest, who has but an ordinary cure in Mexico, to lay up ten or twelve thousand crowns in ten years; and to live plentifully all the time, and be in a manner adored by the common people.</P>
<P>As to the laity, he says, there is not a more bi∣gotted, or a lewder people on the face of the earth: a present to the church wipes off the odium of the greatest crimes; and the way the people are in∣structed in their religion here, as in Old-Spain, is by plays and theatrical entertainments in their churches.</P>
<P>Few are so unacquainted with history, as not to know that America, or the New-World, was first discovered by Columbus, a native of Genoa, to∣wards the fifteenth century. Among the other discoverers and conquerors, after Columbus, was Hernando Cortez, who embarked for the island of Hispaniola, anno 1504, and from thence went to Cuba, and had a great share in the reduction of that island: whereupon Diego Velasquez, the go∣vernor,
<PB N="366" REF="3670"/>
made choice of him to command the forces intended to invade the empire of Mexico. Cor∣tez sailed from St. Jago de Cuba, on the 18th of November 1518, and touching at the Havannah, he sailed again from thence the 10th of February, and arrived at the island of Cozumel, near the coast of Jucatan, a few days after, where he mustered his forces, consisting of five hundred and eight foot, sixteen horse, and one hundred and nine seamen, besides his two chaplains.</P>
<P>He sailed from Cozumel the 4th of March 1518, and having doubled Cape Catoch, he continued his voyage to the mouth of the river Tabasco, in the Bay of Campeachy, where he landed, defeated the Indians, and took the town of Tabasco, after which he embarked his forces, and sailed to St. John de Ulva, where landing his forces, he receiv∣ed an embassy from Motezuma, the emperor.</P>
<P>Cortez soon after burnt his ships, and began his march for the capital city of Mexico, and coming to Tlascala, the 23d of September 1519, he was joined by that people, who were at war with the Mexicans. While Cortez remained here, he re∣ceived another embassy from Montezuma, inviting him to his capital; but Cortez, pretending this was a treacherous design, fell upon the subjects of Montezuma, and cut several thousands of them in pieces; at which the emperor was so terrified, that he offered to resign himself to the general's plea∣sure, and accordingly opened the gates of his capi∣tal to Cortez, who arrived there the 19th of No∣vember 1519.</P>
<P>Not long after, Cortez seized the person of the emperor, and made him his prisoner, and his offi∣cers proceeded to plunder the city; whereupon there happened a general insurrection of the na∣tives, who drove the Spaniards out of the city; and Montezuma, it is presumed, was murdered by
<PB N="367" REF="3680"/>
the Spaniards, when they found they could not carry him off alive; for he was never heard of af∣terwards.</P>
<P>Cortez, having received a reinforcement of Spa∣niards from Europe, returned towards Mexico a∣gain, and invested that city by land, as well as wa∣ter, making himself master of it the 13th of Au∣gust 1521; in which siege, it is said, one hundred thousand Mexicans were destroyed.</P>
<P>The rest of the provinces of this empire submit∣ted to Cortez, soon after the surrender of the capi∣tal: they were used, however, with that barbarity, that Cortez was sent for over to Spain, to give an account of his conduct; but he carried treasure enough with him to purchase his peace, and get his commission of generalissimo confirmed. At his return he sent some ships to the Spice Islands, in the East-Indies, but the Portuguese drove them from thence; he also attempted to make further discoveries in the South-Seas, but was unsuccessful in both attempts: whereupon he went over to Spain again, whither so many complaints of his oppression and cruelty followed him, that he was not suffered to return to Mexico again; but re∣mained a kind of a prisoner at large in the court of Spain till his death, which happened on the 2d of December 1545, in the sixty-second year of his age. His body was sent over to Mexico, and in∣terred in the cathedral of that city.</P>
<P>The principal cities in New-Spain are, Mexico, the capital; Granada, in the province of Nicaragua; Puebla de los Angelos, and Vera Cruz, in the pro∣vince of Tlascala; Guadalajara, Honduras, and Guatimala, in the provinces so called; Campeachy, in the province of Jucatan or Yucatan; and Aca∣pulco, in that of Mexico Proper.</P>
<P>Mexico stands in the midst of the great lake of its own name, in latitude 19°. 40′. about one hun∣dred
<PB N="368" REF="3690"/>
and seventy miles west of the Gulph of Mex∣ico. In point of regularity, it exceeds all the cities in the universe; the streets being so streight, and exactly disposed, that from any part of the town the whole is visible. The want of gates, walls, and artillery, together with the five great causeways leading to the city, renders Mexico extremely re∣markable. All the buildings are convenient; but the public edifices, especially the churches and con∣vents, are magnificent. The income of the grand cathedral amounts to near eighty thousand pounds sterling per annum, out of which the archbishop has fifteen thousand pounds, besides vast sums aris∣ing from perquisites. The number of the inhabi∣tants is computed at three hundred thousand, who are said to draw annually from the mines above ten millions of money, without reckoning the vast sums secreted, in order to defraud the king of his rights; yet, with these almost incredible treasures, the people may be reckoned poor, as most of them live beyond their fortunes, and terminate a life of profusion in the most wretched indigence. What most strikes the eye of a traveller here is, the vast quantity of jewels, gold and silver plate, and toys, exposed to sale in the streets, together with the most valuable commodities of Europe and Asia.</P>
<P>Acapulco stands in 17°. north latitude, on a bay of the South-Sea, about two hundred and ten miles south-east from Mexico. The haven is large and commodious, and the entrance se∣cured by a flat island running across, at each end of which is a deep channel, sufficiently broad for the greatest vessels. The only inconvenience is, that ships must enter by the sea-wind, and go out by the land-breeze, which seldom fail to succeed each other alternately; so that they are frequently blown off to sea, after repeated attempts to make the harbour. The town is large, but ill-built; a
<PB N="369" REF="3700"/>
great part of it consists of warehouses. The cli∣mate is said to be exceedingly unhealthy, and earth∣quakes very common. During the fair, after the arrival of the annual Lima and Manilla ships, the town is so crouded with strangers, that great num∣bers are obliged to pitch tents in the neighbour∣hood for their accommodation. It is supposed, that the Manilla galleon carries off from Acapulco at least ten millions of dollars, in return for the goods she brought thither, and for the payment of the Spanish garrisons in the Philippine Isles.</P>
<P>Vera Cruz, or Ulva, stands on the Gulph of Mexico, about seventy leagues from the capital. It is very strong, both by nature and art, being the great mart of all the Spanish trade in the North-Sea; and has a safe, commodious, though not ca∣pacious harbour. The air is so unhealthy, that no Spaniards of distinction make their constant residence in it. A prodigious trade is carried on here, not on∣ly with Mexico, but by Mexico with the East-In∣dies; and also with Old-Spain, Cuba, Jucatan, Pe∣ru, and all the interior part of the Spanish domi∣nions. After the arrival of the flota and galleons from Old-Spain there is a great fair, which conti∣nues almost till their departure. The warehouses are constantly full of the commodities and manu∣factures of Europe, Asia, and America.</P>

<HEAD>SOUTH-AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS vast peninsula, extending itself from the Isthmus of Darien to Cape Horn, in the form of a triangle, goes by the general name of Peruviana, although all the countries included within it do not acknowledge the dominion of the crown of Spain. The heart of the country hath not yet been reduced: the Portuguese are in pos∣session of a large tract, and some other nations have found means to establish themselves on the coast. On one side the Spanish territories reach no farther than from the North Sea to the equinectial, and commence again at Rio de la Plata on the other, the fine country of Brazil occupying the middle space; and from the River of Plate quite to the Straits of Magellan, the Spaniards rather claim than possess a real dominion. Indeed, the terri∣tories already in their hands are of such extent, and afford such vast treasures, that they have no temp∣tations to make either conquests or discoveries; and the Portuguese are much in the same situation. Hence there is a vast tract of interior country, stretching for near two thousand miles from east to west, and above one thousand from south to north, still possessed by the natives, and little known to any European nation; but which, there is great reason to believe, is infinitely rich in gold, silver, gems, drugs, fruits, cattle, corn, and many other commodities.</P>
<P>The Spanish dominions in South-America are under two governors, stiled viceroys and captain∣generals, subordinate to whom are several au∣diences, as those of Panama, Terra-Firma, Chu∣quisaca, Quito, Lima, Los Charcas, and Chili, consisting each of a president and a certain number
<PB N="371" REF="3720"/>
of counsellors, appointed by the king, with the in∣ferior officers dependent on them. Commonly the viceroys and presidents hold their authority for se∣ven years, and the inferior magistrates for three or four; though the viceroys have power to renew their commissions, upon their exhibiting proofs of their having faithfully discharged their duty. No∣thing, however, is more certain, than that most of them look upon their commissions as a kind of harvest, that will occur but once in their life; and therefore lose no opportunity to make the most of it, by fleecing and oppressing the people. The stated appointments of the viceroys are not very great; that of the viceroy of Peru, notwithstand∣ing the great dignity of the employment, is no more than forty thousand pieces of eight per an∣num; but then they have occasional salaries and perquisites, which exceed all computation; for this reason, these employments are usually bestowed on favourite noblemen of broken fortune, who, by this means, soon lay up sufficient resources for new scenes of luxury and dissipation.</P>
<P>We now proceed to the particular description of the countries contained in South-America.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>TERRA-FIRMA.</HEAD>
<P>Terra-Firma, otherwise called New-Castile or Castilla del Oro, is bounded by the North-Sea (part of the Atlantic Ocean) on the north; by the same sea and Guiana on the east; by the country of the Amazons and Peru on the south; and by the Pacific Ocean and Veragua on the west. It lies between sixty-two and eighty-three degrees of west longitude, and between the equator and twelve degrees of north latitude; being upwards of twelve hundred miles in length from east to west, and eight hundred in breadth from north to south. It had the name of Castilla del Oro from the quanti∣ties
<PB N="372" REF="3730"/>
of gold found in the district of Uraba and other parts; and was first discovered by the celebrated Columbus, in his third voyage.</P>
<P>The climate is neither pleasant nor healthy; the inhabitants, one part of the year, being scorched by the most intense and burning heat, and the other almost drowned with perpetual floods of rain, pour∣ing from the sky with such violence as if a general deluge was to ensue.</P>
<P>In so large a tract of country, the soil must ne∣cessarily vary. Accordingly in some parts, it is a barren sand, or drowned mangrove land, that will scarce produce any kind of grain; in others, it yields Indian corn, balms, gums, and drugs, al∣most all manner of fruits, as well of Old as of New-Spain, sugar, tobacco, Brazil wood, and several kinds of dying woods; a variety of precious stones, particularly emeralds and sapphires; venison, and other game. The plantations of cacao, or choco∣late nuts, in the district of the Caraccas, are esteem∣ed the best in America. The mountains abound with tygers, and, according to some, with lions, and great numbers of other wild beasts. The ri∣vers, seas, and lakes, teem with fish, and also with alligators; and the bowels of the earth were once furnished with the richest treasures, now almost ex∣hausted. The same may be said of the pearl-fishe∣ries on the coast, which are far from being so pro∣fitable now as formerly.</P>
<P>Terra-Firma is a very mountainous country. Terra-Firma Proper, in particular, consists of pro∣digious high mountains, and deep vallies, flooded more than half the year. The mountains in the provinces of Carthagena and St. Martha, accord∣ing to Dampier, are the highest in the world, be∣ing seen at sea two hundred miles off: from these run a chain of hills, of almost equal height, quite through South-America, as far as the Straits of Ma∣gellan, called the Cordilleras des Andes. The
<PB N="373" REF="3740"/>
province of Venezuela also, and district of the Ca∣raccas, the most northerly parts of South-America, are almost a continued chain of hills, separated by small vallies, pointing upon the coast of the North-Sea. A chain of barren mountains, almost impas∣sable, runs through the province of Popayan, from north to south, some whereof are volcanos; but, towards the shores of the Pacific Ocean, it is a low country, flooded great part of the year.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of Terra-Firma are the Darien, Chagtre, Santa Maria, Conception, Rio Grande, or Magdalena, Maricaibo, and Oroonoko.</P>
<P>The most considerable gulphs or bays, whether on the South or North Seas, are the gulphs of Darien, Triesto, Vinezuela, and Paria or Andalu∣sia; the bays of Panama, St. Michael, Portobello, Guaira, Curiaco, Carthagena, and Sino. The chief capes are, Samblas Point, Cape Canoa, Cape del A∣gua, Swart Point, Cape de Vela, Cape Conquibacoa, Cape Cubelo, Cape Blanco, Cape Galara, Cape Three Points, and Cape Nassau; all on the north shore of Terra-Firma.</P>
<P>Terra-Firma contains the provinces of Terra-Firma Proper or Darien, of Carthagena, St. Mar∣tha, Rio de la Hacha, Venezuela, Comana, New-Andalusia or Paria, New-Granada, and Popayan.</P>
<P>Terra-Firma Proper lies in the form of a crescent, about the spacious bay of Panama, being the isth∣mus which joins South and North-America; and extending in length, between the two seas, three hundred miles, but in breadth, where the isthmus is narrowest, only sixty. Here are found gold mines, gold sands, and fine pearls; and though the land is generally rough, there are some fruitful vallies, watered by rivers, brooks, and springs. The chief places are, Panama and Porto Bello.</P>
<P>Panama stands, according to those excellent astronomers Don Juan and Antonio Ulloa, in lati∣tude
<PB N="374" REF="3750"/>
8°. 57′. 48″. ½ north, upon that capacious and beautiful bay to which it gives name. In 1737, it was entirely consumed by fire; but hath been since rebuilt with elegant houses, but not magnificent. It is strongly fortified and garrison∣ed, and the walls mounted with large cannon. Here is the residence of the governor of the pro∣vince, and the seat of a royal audience, with a conve∣nient harbour, well secúred against storms by a number of surrounding islands. Both the road and whole coast abound in a great variety of excellent fish. At the bottom of the sea are found numbers of pearls, and the oysters in which they are found are remarkably delicious. This kind of fishery is of great advantage to the inhabitants of all the islands in the bay; and there are few persons of substance about Penama, who do not employ at least a part of their slaves in it. The slaves thus em∣ployed must be expert swimmers, and capable of holding their breath a long time. During the season, eight, ten, or twenty of them set out, un∣der the command of an officer, in a boat, from the islands, where they have huts built for their lodgings, to such parts of the bay as are known to produce pearls, and where the depth of the water is not above ten, twelve, or fifteen fathoms. Here they come to an anchor; and the negroes, having a rope fastened round their bodies, and the other end to the side of the boat, take with them a small weight to accelerate their sinking, and plunge into the water. On reaching the bottom, they take up an oyster, which they put under the left arm; the second they hold in their left hand, and the third in their right; with these three oysters, and sometimes another in their mouth, they rise to breathe, and put them in a bag. When they have rested them∣selves a while, they dive a second time; and thus continue till they have either compleated their task, or their strength fails them. Every one of these
<PB N="375" REF="3760"/>
negro-divers is obliged daily to deliver to his mas∣ter a certain number of pearls; so that, when they have got a sufficient number of oysters in their bag, they begin to open them, and deliver the pearls to the officer, till they have made up the number due to their master; and if the pearl be but formed it is sufficient, without regard to its be∣ing small or faulty. The remainder, however large or beautiful, are the negro's own property; nor has the master the least claim to them, the slaves being allowed to sell them to whom they please, though the master generally purchases them at a very small price.</P>
<P>Besides the toil of this fishery, from the oysters adhering strongly to the rocks, the negroes are in no small danger from some kinds of fish, which either seize them, or run against them so violently as either to kill them, or crush them against the bot∣tom. Every negro, to defend himself against these animals, carries with him a sharp knife, with which the fish being struck, immediately flies off. The officers keep a watchful eye on these voracious creatures, and, on discovering them, shake the ropes fastened to the negroes bodies, that they may be upon their guard. Many, on the diver's being in danger, have thrown themselves into the water, with the like weapon, to assist in his defence; but all their dexterity and precaution frequently have not been sufficient to protect the diver from being devoured by these fish, or losing a leg or an arm by their bite.</P>
<P>Some of the pearls are sent to Europe; but the greatest part of them are carried to Peru, where they are universally worn by all persons of rank.</P>
<P>Porto-Bello stands in 9°. 34′. 35″. north lati∣tude, close to the sea, on the declivity of a moun∣tain, which surrounds the whole harbour. This
<PB N="376" REF="3770"/>
harbour is so large, deep, and safe, that Columbus, who first discovered it, gave it the name of Porto-Bello, or the Fine Harbour, which is now com∣monly used to denote the town. The number of the houses is about one hundred and thirty, most of them of wood, large and spacious, forming one long street along the strand, with other smaller ones crossing it. The governor of the town is al∣ways a gentleman of the army, subordinate to the president of Panama; but having under him the commandants of the forts that defend the harbour. At the east end of the town, on the road to Pana∣ma, is a place called Guinea, where all the negroes of both sexes, whether slaves or free, have their ha∣bitations. This place is very much crouded when the galleons are here; most of the inhabitants of the town quitting their houses entirely, for the sake of letting them; while others content themselves with a small part, in order to make money of the rest. The Mulattoes, and other poor families al∣so, remove either to Guinea or to cottages already erected near it, or built on the occasion. Great num∣bers of artificers likewise, who flock to Porto-Bello from Panama, to work at their respective callings during the fair, lodge in Guinea for cheapness. Towards the sea, in a large tract between the town and Gloria castle, barracks are erected, in most of which the ships crews keep stalls of sweetmeats, and other kinds of eatables, brought from Spain; but at the conclusion of the fair, when the ships put to sea, all these buildings are taken down, and the town returns to its former tranquillity and empti∣ness. In 1739, the harbour was defended by a castle and two forts, which were all demolished by Admiral Vernon, who, with six ships only, made himself master of this port. The country about Porto-Bello is over-run with mountains and impe∣netrable forests, except a few vallies, in which are
<PB N="377" REF="3780"/>
some scattered farms. Among the mountains that surround the harbour, one distinguished by the name of Capiro, and its superior loftiness, is a sort of barometer to the country, by foretelling every change of the weather. Its top is always covered with clouds, of a density and darkness seldom seen in those of the atmosphere. When these clouds thicken, increase their blackness, and sink below their usual station, it is a sure sign of a tempest; while, on the other hand, their clearness and as∣cent as certainly indicate the approach of fair wea∣ther. These changes are very sudden and fre∣quent here. The summit of the mountain is scarce ever clear from clouds; and, when it hap∣pens, it is only, as it were, for an instant. Except in the time of the fair, all the inhabitants of Porto∣bello do not amount to three thousand, half of whom are Indians, Mulattoes, or negroes; the Spaniards of any substance not chusing to reside in a place so extremely unhealthy, and fatal even to the lives of the natives. Ulloa tells us, that the cattle brought hither from Panama or Carthagena, lose their flesh so fast in the best pastures, as to become scarce eat∣able: he assures us also, that neither horses or asses are bred here. The heat, indeed, is excessive, and the torrents of rain so dreadful, sudden, and impetuous, that one not accustomed to them would imagine a second deluge was a coming. These torrents also are accompanied with frightful tempests of thunder and lightning, the awfulness of the scene being heightened by the repercussions from the mountains, and the shrieks and howlings of multitudes of monkeys of all kinds, which inha∣bit the surrounding woods.</P>
<P>Fresh water pours down in streams from the mountains, some running without the town, and others crossing it. These waters are very light and
<PB N="378" REF="3790"/>
digestive; qualities which in other countries would be very valuable, but are here pernicious, pro∣ducing dissenteries, which the patient very seldom survives. However, these rivulets, formed into reservoirs, serve the purposes of bathing, which is here found to be very conducive to health.</P>
<P>As the forests almost border on the houses of the town, tygers often make incursions into the streets during the night, carrying off fowls, dogs, and other domestic animals, and sometimes even chil∣dren have fallen a prey to them. Besides the snares usually laid for them, the negroes and mulattoes, who fell wood in the forests of the mountains, are very dextrous in encountering them; and some, for a slender reward, even seek them in their re∣treats.</P>
<P>The town of Porto-Bello, which is thinly inha∣bited by reason of its noxious air, the scarcity of provisions, and the barrenness of the soil, becomes, after the arrival of the galleons, one of the most populous towns in the world. He who had seen it quite empty, and every place wearing a me∣lancholy aspect, would be filled with astonishment, to see the bustling multitudes in the time of the fair, when every house is crowded, the squares and streets encumbered with bales of merchandize and chests of gold and silver, the harbour full of ships and vessels, some loaded with provisions from Carthage∣na, and others with the goods of Peru, as cocoa, Jesuits bark, Vicuna wool, and Bezoar stones; and this town, at all other times detested for its deli∣terious qualities, becomes the staple of the riches of the Old and New World, and the scene of one of the most considerable branches of trade in the universe. Formerly the fair was limited to no par∣ticular time; but as a long stay in such a sickly place extremely affected the health of the traders,
<PB N="379" REF="3800"/>
his catholic majesty transmitted an order that the fair should not last above forty days, and that, if in that time the merchants could not agree on their rates, those of Spain should be allowed to carry their goods up the country to Peru; and accord∣ingly, the commodore of the galleons has orders to re-embark them, and return to Carthagena; but otherwise, by virtue of a compact between the merchants of both kingdoms, and ratified by the king, no Spanish trader is to send his goods, on his own account, beyond Porto-Bello. The English were formerly allowed to send a ship annually to this fair, which turned to great account; and, whilst the assiento contract subsisted, either with the English or the French, one of their principal fac∣tories was at Porto-Bello.</P>
<P>In the year 1695, the Scotch parliament passed an act for creating a company to trade to Africa, and the East and West Indies, under his majesty's letters patent, which the company obtained. The design was so plausible that it induced several Eng∣lish and Hamburgh merchants to engage deeply in the adventure, in consequence of which divers ships were equipped, and a body of forces raised to plant a colony on or near the isthmus of Darien. The territory which the adventurers took possession of was near the north-wes point of the gulph. Here they built the fortress of New Edinburgh, and denominated the surrounding country Cale∣donia. The Indian princes being then at war with the Spaniards, joyfully received the Scotch, in hopes of being able to expel the Spaniards by their assistance. For some time the new colony flourished extremely; but their good fortune soon met with a check from the jealousy of the English East India company, and the complaints of the court of Madrid. The former complained of a violation of their charter, and the latter of a vio∣lation
<PB N="380" REF="3810"/>
of the treaties subsisting between Spain and Great Britain. Accordingly the English parliament interposed, and addressed king William to vacate the charter granted to the Scotch company. The Scotch defended their rights with all the arguments of reason and justice; but the influence of their adversaries was too powerful, and all measures, the most iniquitous, base, and tyrannical, were taken to ruin the infant settlement. The Hamburghers were prevailed on to withdraw their subscriptions; the merchants of London were threatned with the ministerial displeasure, and orders were sent to the English plantations to deny the colonists all pro∣visions and assistance. In a word, such was the power of faction, and private interest, that the na∣tion was robbed of the benefit of one of the most useful establishments ever projected, the advantages of which must have appeared in the most sensible manner, whenever a rupture happened between England and Spain; for while the Isthmus re∣mained in the possession of the colony, the Spanish treasures must have been detained in America.</P>
<P>The province of Carthagena is neither rich, fer∣tile, nor populous: it produces indeed some valu∣able gums, balms, and drugs, but no mines of gold and silver, nor any great quantity of corn or cattle.</P>
<P>Carthagena, the metropolis of the province, is not only a fine opulent city, but a strong fortress, situate in 10° 25′ 48′ ½ north latitude, and in the longitude of 30° 19′ 36″ from the peak of Teneriffe, on a sandy island, called a peninsula by most wri∣ters. The harbour lies between the island and the main, and the entrance is at the south-west end; the other passage, called Bocca-chica, having been filled up by order from the court of Spain, since the unsuccessful attack made upon the town in the year 1741, by admiral Vernon and general
<PB N="381" REF="3820"/>
Wentworth. To the eastward the town has a com∣munication, by means of a wooden bridge, with a large suburb, called Xexemani, built on an∣other island, which is joined to the continent by a bridge of the same materials. The fortifications both of the city and suburbs are constructed in the modern fashion, and built with free-stone; and, in time of peace the garrison consists of ten compa∣nies of seventy-seven men each, besides the militia. The city and suburbs are well laid out, the streets streight, broad, uniform, and well paved. The houses are built of stone or brick, with balconies and lettices of wood, which is more durable in this cli∣mate than iron, the latter being soon corroded by the acrimonious quality of the nitrous atmosphere. The city is populous, though most of the inhabi∣tants are the descendants of the Indian tribes; but it is by no means opulent, compared with many other cities in South America, the country producing no mines; and even the money for paying the sa∣laries of the governor and inferior officers, and the garrison, coming from Santa Fè and Quito. Yet there are many persons who have acquired large fortunes by commerce, whose houses are splendid, and who live in every respect with great magnifi∣cence. At a small distance from the suburb of Xexemani, on a hill, is a fort called St. Lazaro, commanding both the city and suburbs, and afford∣ing a very extensive and agreeable prospect over the sea and land.</P>
<P>The government of Carthagena was indepen∣dent of any other till the year 1739, when the viceroy of New Granada was appointed. It ex∣tends about fifty-three leagues, from west to east, and eighty-five from south to north, containing several fruitful vallies, called by the natives Savan∣nahs, in which are many settlements of Europeans, Spanish Creoles, and Indians. The bay of Cartha∣gena is the first place in America at which the gal∣leons
<PB N="382" REF="3830"/>
are allowed to touch; and the public sales on these occasions, though far short of those at Porto-Bello, are very considerable. The traders of the inland provinces of Santa-Fe, Popayan, and Quito, lay out not only their own stock, but also the monies intrusted to them by commissions, for several sorts of goods, and those species of provi∣sions which are most wanted in their respective countries. The two provinces of Santa Fe and Po∣payan have no other way of supplying themselves with the latter, than from Carthagena. Their traders bring gold and silver in specie, ingots, and dust, and also emeralds; for, besides the silver mines at Santa-Fe, which daily increase by fresh dis∣coveries, there are others, which yield the finest emeralds; but the value of these gems being now fallen in Europe, and particularly in Spain, the trade in them is, by necessary consequence, greatly declined. All these mines produce great quantities of gold, which is carried to Choco, and there pays one-fifth to the king, at an office erected for that purpose.</P>
<P>The climate of Carthagena is excessive hot; yet the inhabitants commonly enjoy a good state of health, and generally live to a great age. The diseases that make the greatest havock here, espe∣cially among the Europeans, are a species of the vomito prieto, or black vomit, called chapoteado, and the leprosy. The latter is so frequent, that an hospital hath been erected for patients labouring un∣der that loathsome distemper. At Carthagena like∣wise that painful tumour in the muscles of the legs and thighs, occasioned by the entrance of the dracuncula or Guinea worm, so common on the coast of Africa, and in some of the West India islands, is extremely troublesome, especially to the natives. There is another insect called nigua, peculiar to this coun∣try and Peru, where it is called pigue, so extreme∣ly
<PB N="383" REF="3840"/>
small as scarce to be visible to the naked eye, which breeds in the dust, and insinuates itself into the soles of the feet, the toes, and the legs, pierc∣ing the skin with such subtilty, that there is no be∣ing aware of it before it has made its way to the flesh. They cause an extreme pain, especially when they have penetrated deep, as they sometimes do, quite to the bone; and then the incision is not on∣ly attended with exquisite torture, but much trou∣ble, and real danger.</P>
<P>Proceeding towards the south, the next province we meet with is Santa Martha, which extends in length about two hundred miles, and in breadth, from east to west, one hundred and forty. It is full of mountains, some of which are so high that they are covered with snow; but abound not only with gold, but with emeralds, sapphires, jasper, and marble of an exquisite vein and polish. There are also salt mines in the province.</P>
<P>The capital, which gives name to the province, and is the see of a bishop and the residence of the governor, is a middling town, situated on a branch of the Rio Grande, and having a direct communi∣cation with the North Sea.</P>
<P>On the southern frontier of Santa Martha lies the little province of Rio de la Hacha. The country is pleasant, tolerably healthy, and exceeding fruitful, having a pearl fishery on the coast, and mines of jas∣per and chalcedony within land. Rio de la Hacha, the capital, is a small place at the mouth of the river, about one hundred and twenty miles from Santa Martha.</P>
<P>The province of Venezuela, including the dis∣trict of Caraccas, lies on the North Sea. It is very large, populous, and fertile, yielding plenty of grain, fruits, cocoa, sugar, and tobacco, and feed∣ing great flocks of sheep and black cattle; but labours under a scarcity of fresh water. Venezu∣ela
<PB N="384" REF="3850"/>
or Cora, the capital, stands on the North Sea, being the see of a bishop, and the residence of the governor.</P>
<P>Maracaibo is a considerable town upon the lake of that name.</P>
<P>Caraccas, which gives name to a district, is a large wealthy town within land. In the same dis∣trict is also Porto-Cavallo, a sea-port town. A great contraband trade is carried on by the English and Dutch on this coast, in spite of all the vigi∣lance of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>Beyond the province of Venezuela lies that of New-Andalusia, which, including the districts of Comona and Paria, is of great extent. The pro∣duce of this country chiefly consists in dying-drugs, gums, medicinal roots, Brazil-wood, sugar, tobac∣co, and some valuable timber, the interior parts being woody and mountainous; but interspersed with fine vallies, that yield corn and pasturage.</P>
<P>Comana, or, as some writers call it, New-Cordu∣ba, the capital, stands about nine miles from the North-Sea. The town of St. Thomas is generally set down as the capital of New-Andalusia, though it is certainly situated without the limits thereof, in the jurisdiction of Surinam, near the mouth of the great river Oronooko.</P>
<P>New-Granada, called sometimes Santa-Fe, and Castella del Oro, is an inland province of great extent, beautifully diversified with mountains and valleys. The mountains contain gold, silver, and emeralds, and the vallies produce corn, cattle, roots, and fruits, with great quantities of guaiacum, balms, gums, drugs of various kinds, with other rich articles of commerce. Santa Fe de Bogata, the capital not only of this province, but of all Terra Firma, and the seat of the viceroy, of the royal audience, and an archbishop, is a large, populous, opulent, and well built city, situated on the banks
<PB N="385" REF="3860"/>
of a lake, with altars at stated distances, higher than the houses, on which, as on the arches, may be seen amazing quantities of the richest wrought plate and jewels. Ulloa observes, that the ostenta∣tion and emulation of the inhabitants of Quito, in their funerals, is so extraordinory, that they may be said to toil, scheme, and endure the greatest la∣bour and fatigue, merely to enable their successors to lavish honours upon a carcase insensible to all pa∣geantry.</P>
<P>Of the other towns in Quito, the principal are Guiaquil and Paita.</P>
<P>Guiaquil is a considerable town, at the mouth of the river from which it takes its name. The com∣merce here consists chiefly in cocoa, timber, salt, horned cattle, mules, hides, tobacco, wax, Guinea∣pepper, drugs, and a kind of cotton, called loua de ciebo, so extremely fine that no method of spinning it hath hitherto been invented. The Guiaquil is here about two miles over, and the navigation of it performed by small vessels, canoes, and balzas or rafts, which the Indians steer with surprizing dexte∣rity.</P>
<P>Paita is a small sea port, that was taken by com∣modore (late lord) Anson, in 1741. The soil round Paita is sandy and barren; for, besides the total want of rain, there is not so much as a small rivulet near it; so that the inhabitants are obliged to fetch that necessary fluid from Colan, a town on the same bay, at the distance of four leagues.</P>
<P>The natives of Terra-Firma and Quito have ne∣ver been thoroughly subdued, and probably never will, as they are not only a gallant, warlike people, but have almost impregnable fastnesses to retire to, and bear an inveterate hatred to the Spaniards. On the Isthmus of Darien they have lank, coarse, black hair, which generally hangs down to the mid∣dle of their back. Their natural complexion is a
<PB N="386" REF="3870"/>
copper colour, or orange-tawny; and their eye-brows are naturally as black as jet. They anoint themselves all over with oil, to render their skins smooth, sleek, and supple. Both men and women paint their bodies with the figures of men, beasts, birds, trees, and the like: the women are the painters, and their chief colours are red, yellow, and blue, which are very bright. They wear no cloaths, only the women have a clout, that is tied before and behind, by a string, round their middles. The men go quite naked, without so much as a clout; but they have a piece of silver or gold plate, in the shape of a half-moon, hanging over their mouths, and pinching the bridle of their nose with its points. The women have rings in the gristles of their noses, which hang over their mouths; but these, in both sexes, are chiefly worn on some public occasions, and they always take them off at meals. Besides these, the men, women, and children wear strings or chains of teeth, shells, beads, and the like, which hang down from the neck upon the breast. She must be a poor woman who has not fifteen or twenty pounds weight of these strings; but they do not wear them when in their houses. The women take care of the plantations; and the men build the houses or huts, and go a hunting or fishing. Their arms are bows, arrows, lances, and daggers, or great knives; and many of them of late use fire-arms, which they purchase of the Eu∣ropeans. When a woman is brought to bed, ano∣ther takes her and her child to the river, and washes them. The child, after the first month, is laid upon a board, as in Virginia and Carolina. Some writers tell us also, that besides the dark complec∣tioned Indians, there are some of a pure milk-white, without the least tincture of red; having also the hair of their head and eye-brows white, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, short, milk-white down upon their bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="387" REF="3880"/>
The cruelties and ravages committed by Pedro∣rias and others, who first reduced these provinces under the crown of Spain, almost exceed belief. Pedrorias and his successors did not destroy less in Terra-Firma only, than eight hundred thousand people; and plundered the country of several mil∣lions of gold. The governor and his officers, eve∣ry day, invented new torments, to make the Indians discover their gold; some they racked, others they burnt by inches, till they expired in torments. Many thousands were destroyed on the coast of New-Andalusia, by being obliged to dive for pearls beyond their strength. It was a common thing to cut off the noses of men and women in sport, and give them to the dogs. They kept packs of great mastiffs, on purpose to hunt and tear in pieces the Indians; and would often kill an Indian without any offence given, and lend a brother Spaniard a quarter of a man, as one would lend a neighbour a quarter of pork or mutton, to feed their dogs.</P>
<P>The greatest prince of the country, named Ba∣gota, from whom the capital city was afterwards called Santa Fé de Bagota, after he had brought in a prodigious quantity of gold, by dispatching ex∣presses to every part of his dominions, was so tor∣tured, to make him produce more, that he expired under the hands of his merciless persecutors.</P>

<HEAD>PERU.</HEAD>
<P>Peru, formerly a powerful empire, extended from 60 to 81°. of west longitude, and from the equator to the 25°, of south latitude, that is, near two thousand miles from north to south, and about five hundred, where broadest, from east to west; being bounded by Popayan on the north; by the Cordilleras des Andes, which separate it from the country of the Amazons and Paraguay or La Plata,
<PB N="388" REF="3890"/>
on the east; by Chili, and La Plata, properly so called, on the south; and by the Pacific Ocean, or South-Sea, on the west; but the province last described on the north, is now under the viceroy of Santa Fé de Bagota, and not of Peru; the latter, however, presides over a vast extent of country; viz. the rest of Peru, Jucatan, Paraguay, and Chili.</P>
<P>The coast of Peru, along the Pacific Ocean, is a high bold shore. About thirty miles within land, is a chain of mountains, called the Sierras; and beyond these, about eighty miles, are prodigious high mountains, called the Cordilleras des Andes, which, with the Sierras, run the whole length of South-America, upwards of three thousand miles. The upper parts of them are always covered with snow, and the air is so pure and subtle that it is not fit for respiration; accordingly, there are no ani∣mals upon them, wild or tame. It never rains in that part of the country which lies near the sea∣coast, unless within three or four degrees of the equator, which lie within the province of Quito; but the country is well watered by the rivers, which fall from the Andes into the South-Sea: these they turn into their fields and gardens, and, by that means, have their vintage and harvest at what time they please, this being the only country betwixt the tropics that affords wine. The wind blows continually from the south or south-west, at sea, near the coast. The weather is bright, when the sun is in the northern signs, and hazy, when south of the equator, though no rain falls.</P>
<P>The land along the sea-shore is a dry barren sand, except in some few places. The Sierras are also barren hills; but the low grounds and vallies, at the bottom of them, are fruitful, producing al∣most all manner of grain and fruits. This part of the country is the best inhabited, being not only
<PB N="389" REF="3900"/>
the most fruitful, but the most temperate; for the sandy plains, near the sea, are excessive hot.</P>
<P>The Peruvian sheep, called pacos or huancu, are of the bigness of a stag, and resemble a camel. The body is covered with a coarse kind of wool; they are very tractable, and were formerly the only beasts of burthen among the Indians. Their flesh is very good meat, and esteemed as innocent as a chicken. Their height is from four feet to four and a half. They generally carry an hun∣dred-weight; and walk, holding their heads up, with wonderful gravity and majesty, and so regular a pace, that no beating will make them alter it. At night, it is impossible to make them move with their burthen; they lie down till it is taken off, to go and graze. Their common food is a sort of grass, somewhat like a small rush, with which all the mountains are covered. These sheep eat little, and never drink; so that they are very easily kept. Ths Spaniards use them in the mines, to carry the ore to the mills. The vicunnas are shaped much like the pacos, only they are smaller and lighter. The Spaniards call them Indian goats, because they also resemble that animal. Their wool is very fine, and much valued; besides, the bezoar stone, which is said to expel poison, and to perform many notable cures, is found in them. Their deer are much less than ours. They have not many wild beasts; and such as they have are not very fierce and dan∣gerous. The cattle imported from Europe are vastly increased; and most of them run wild, and are hunted, like other game. The Peruvians had no tame fowl, but the nuana, somewhat resembling the duck, but much larger.</P>
<P>Among their forest trees, the most valuable is the quinquina, ot Jesuits bark, which grows in the mountains of Potosi, and also in the province of Quito. It is about the size of a cherry tree, the
<PB N="390" REF="3910"/>
leaves round and indented, and bears a long red∣dish flower, from whence arises a pod, with a kernel like an almond; but neither the kernel nor the fruit have the same virtues as the bark. In the plains of Truxillo there is a sort of tree, which bears twenty or thirty flowers, all of them different, and of divers colours, hanging together like a bunch of grapes. From a tree, called maguey, they get honey, vinegar, and drink. The stalks and leaves are not only good to eat, but may be wrought like hemp; from them also they draw the thread called pica. The wood serves to cover houses; the prickles, or thorns, for needles; and the Indians use the fruit instead of soap. Sarsapa∣rilla, dragon's blood, some rhubarb, tamarinds, Camina oil, storax, guaiacum, and several sorts of gums and drugs, ananas, guavoes, patalas, bananas, and melons are produced here, besides many other fruits and vegetables. They have likewise plenty of European corn, wine, and oil, with apples, pears, figs, &amp;c. The cassavi root they make bread of here, as in other parts of America. Most of the balsam that bears the name of Peru, and proceeds from the trunk and branches of a little tree, comes from Mexico.</P>
<P>Gold is found in every province of Peru, washed down from the mountains; and there are plenty of silver mines, of which the richest are those of Po∣tosi, discovered in 1545. They consist of solid rock; and the ore is so hard that they break it with hammers, and it splits as if it were flint.</P>
<P>The quicksilver mines, near Lima, were not dis∣covered till 1567; and the Spaniards did not be∣gin to refine their silver with mercury at Potosi, till 1571.</P>
<P>All the natives of this empire now acknowledge themselves subjects of Spain, and outwardly, at least, make profession of popery, though they ge∣nerally
<PB N="391" REF="3920"/>
retain a strong inclination towards their an∣tient idolatry. Not only those that work in the mines, but all the rest in general, are treated in the most insolent, brutish, and oppressive manner by the Spaniards, both clergy and laity; only it is said, the Jesuits, before their suppression, used them much more civilly than the rest of their country∣men, and, by that means, had a great ascendency over them, and were much loved and respected by them.</P>
<P>The native Peruvians are generally of a middling stature and olive complexion: their hair, as tha of all other people between the tropics, is always black; most of them have their heads shaved, and the hair of their beards, and other parts of their bodies, is pulled up, from time to time, with tweez∣ers, whenever any appears, except that on their eye-brows and eye-lids, at least, such was their practice, when the Spaniards first settled among them; but the manners of the greater part, with∣out doubt, are much changed now, though, per∣haps, not for the better.</P>
<P>Their principal manufactures, at the above-men∣tioned period, were woollen and cotton cloths, which they wove, and dyed into all manner of co∣lours; but no man was suffered to wear a garment, cap, or turbant, of different colours, but those of the royal blood. The carpets on which they lay were made of the wool of their country sheep, or the fine hair of their goats; and their hammocks of cotton, or net-work. They had little or no trade, either with foreigners, or with one another: every family having its plantation, and almost all necessa∣ries within itself.</P>
<P>Their carpenters had no other tools than hatchets, made of copper or flint; their stone-cutters no other tools than sharp flints and pebbles; and pullies, and other engines, were entirely unknown to them;
<PB N="392" REF="3930"/>
yet, under all these disadvantages, they raised strong and magnificent edifices. Their needles were thorns, or fine bones, and their threads the sinews of animals, or the fibres of plants, or of the bark of a certain tree; scissars they had none; and their knives were flint, or copper: their combs were made of long thorns, set on each side of a piece of cane, which served for the back of the comb; and the razors they shaved their heads with were no better than sharp flints; in which operation the pa∣tient suffered so much, that there was nothing the Spaniards carried over more acceptable to them, than the razors and scissars: they had no looking-glasses; but, instead of them, the Peruvian ladies made use of a round plate of polished brass, or copper; and in this the natives of the East-Indies agree with them, having no other mirrors at this day than what they get of the Europeans. The several nations were distinguished by their head∣dresses; some wearing a kind of turbant of cotton-linen, others a single piece, others a kind of hats, and others caps in the form of a sugar∣loaf, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nothing struck them more than the blackness of the negroe-slaves that the Spaniards brought with them; they could not believe it to be na∣tural, having never seen a black in America; they desired the Spaniards, therefore, to let them make experiment, and try if they could not wash off the black paint, as they took it to be.</P>
<P>The Peruvians exceed most nations in the world in quickness of wit, and strength of judgment. Such of them as have had the advantage of mast∣ers, since the arrival of the Spaniards, have general∣ly made an extraordinary proficiency. When the Spaniards first appeared among them, they ac∣knowledged one Almighty being, maker of heaven and earth, whom they called Pacha-Camac, i. e.
<PB N="393" REF="3940"/>
the soul of the universe; but they seldom erected Temples, or offered sacrifices to him. The next object of their adoration was the Sun, to which they offered sacrifices of all sorts of cattle, especially lambs and fowls, corn, and even the best and finest clothes, all which they burnt in the place of incense, rendering their thanks and praises to the Sun, for having sustained and nourished all those things for the use and support of mankind. They had also their drink-offerings, made of Indian corn steeped in water.</P>
<P>All the priests of the Sun, that officiated in the city of Cusco, were of the blood royal. Besides the worship of the Sun, they paid some adoration to the images of several animals and vegetables, that had a place in their temple.</P>
<P>They had four grand festivals annually, besides those they celebrated every moon. The first, cal∣led Raymi, was held in the month of June, im∣mediately after the summer solstice, with great pomp and solemnity, in honour of the Sun, and in commemoration of the first inca, Manca Capac, and Caya Mama-Ocla, his wife and sister.</P>
<P>It is evident, that they believed the soul survived the body, by the sncas constantly declaring that they should go to rest, or into a state of happiness, provided for them by their God and father the Sun, when they left this world.</P>
<P>As to the Creolians here, though almost utter strangers to true religion, they are said to be super∣stitious even to a higher degree, than the Spaniards of Europe. They are very careful to say their rosary often every day, and to provide a religious habit, to die and be buried in; being persuaded, that when clad in alivery so much respected here below, they shall, without any difficulty, be admitted into heaven. They scarce know what it is to pray to God, but address themselves only to the Virgin and the saints.</P>
<P><PB N="394" REF="3950"/>
The most beggarly and meanest of the Europe. ans become gentlemen, as soon as they find them∣selves transported among the Indians, blacks, mu∣lattoes, Mestizoes &amp;c. Any good or generous ac∣tions performed by them are the effects of their vanity and imaginary nobility.</P>
<P>The Creolians are said to bear a great antipathy to the native Spaniards, of which one reason is sup∣posed to be, because they see those strangers in possession of the prime places of the state. In their outward behaviour they affect great gravity, like European Spaniards, to whom they are not in∣ferior in wit and genius, acuteness, and understand∣ing, but less active and hardy.</P>
<P>Effeminacy and sloth seem to be peculiar to the country, because it is too good; for it is ob∣served, that those who have been bread to labour in Spain, grow idle here in a short time, like the Creolians. They are sober as to wine, but eat a great deal, and after an indecent manner, sometimes all out of the same dish, and without forks.</P>
<P>In matters of love, the Creolians yield to no na∣tion, freely sacrificing to that passion, most of what they have; and though covetous upon all other occasions, they are generous beyond measure to women. There is nothing scandalous here in con∣cubinage; nay, it is a sort of disgrace not to keep mistress. It is even frequent enough to see married men forsake their wives, to adhere to mulattoes and blacks. Bastards are as much regarded as the lawfully begotten, provided they are owned by the father; and there is no disgrace inherent to that birth.</P>
<P>The clergy, especially the inferior sort, and the friars, if not much belied, exceed the laity in libertinism almost as much as they do in wealth, pride, and laziness. The Jesuits are said to have been richer here than in Mexico, in which their confiscated estates and effects were computed to a∣mount
<PB N="395" REF="3960"/>
to the immense value of seventy-seven mil∣lions of piasters, or three hundred and eighty-five millions of French livres.</P>
<P>The Creolian women, though not shut up, as they are in Spain, yet seldom go abroad by day; but at night, 'tis said, they go a courting, and those who are modestest by day, are then the boldest, their faces being covered with their veils. They are, for the most part, sprightly enough, and their complexion good, but not lasting. Those proposals, which a lover would not dare to make in another country, without the indignation of a modest woman, are so far from scandalizing here, that they are reckoned essential to gallantry: instead of taking offence at them, as indicating an ill opinion of their virtue, they return thanks, as for an honour done to them.</P>
<P>Before the appointment of a viceroy at Santa Fé in new Granada, Peru contained the three audiences of Lima, or Los Reyes, Los Charcas, or La Plata, and Quito, but now only the two former, and not even the whole of these; for, according to Don Ulloa, the audience of Los Charcas comprehends Tucuman and Paraguay.</P>
<P>The audience of Lima, or Los Reyes is bounded on the north by Quito; on the east, by the Cordil∣lera mountains; on the south, by the audience of Los Charcas; and, on the west, by the Pacific Ocean, being about seven hundred and seventy miles in length, from south to north, but of unequal breadth. The climate and soil are said to vary greatly in this audience, especially the former; and that in the compass of a few miles, in which all the vicissitudes of weather are sometimes experienced in twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Lima, the capital not only of this audience but of all Peru, is situated in a spacious and delightful valley, not far from the sea, in the latitude of 12° 2′ 31″. south. A river of the same name washes the
<PB N="396" REF="3970"/>
walls, over which there is, or was, a handsome stone bridge; for no longer ago than the year 1746, on the 28th of October, a dreadful shock of an earthquake almost entirely destroyed this city in the space of three minutes, burying in the ruins those inhabi∣tants, who, endeavouring to save their most precious moveables, had not made sufficient haste into the streets and squares At the same time, the sea re∣ceding to a considerable distance, returned with such violence, that Callao, which was the port of Lima, and all the neighbouring country were laid under water; men, women and houses being swept away with the torrent; nineteen vessels out of twen∣ty-three were sunk, and the frigate, called St. Fir∣min, was carried by the force of the waves to a great distance up the country. For the space of four months the concussions continued, with short intervals, and many of them were as violent as the first; so that before the twenty-fourth of the follow∣ing year, no less than four hundred and fifty shocks had been felt, some of them no less dreadful than the first. Above twelve thousand lives perished in the ruins of their own effects and property. It is probable it hath now, in a great measure, recovered its former splen∣dor; but how far, we cannot positively say. Howe∣ver, it is still the capital and great emporium of Peru, and the residence of the viceroy, whose government is triennial; though at the expiration of that term, the sovereign may renew his commission. He en∣joys all the pomp and prerogatives of royalty. All officers are appointed, and places filled up by him. For the security of his person, he has two corps of guards, one of horse and the other of halbardiers. The horse guards consist of one hundred and sixty, under the command of a captain and lieutenant: their uniforms are blue, laced with silver. The hal∣bardiers, in number fifty, are clad in crimson-velvet waistcoats, deeply laced with gold, and do duty in rooms leading to the royal audience chamber.
<PB N="397" REF="3980"/>
Besides these, there is another guard within the palace, of a hundred men, being a detachment from the garrison of Callao. All are occasionally em∣ployed in executing the orders of the viceroy, and enforcing the decrees of the tribunals, after they have received the royal assent; for such the con∣currence of the viceroy is esteemed, who, besides assisting at the courts of justice, and councils, gives daily audience to all degrees of persons. The supreme tribunal at Lima, called audienca, is held in the viceroy's palace, and consists of eight auditors, and a fiscal, for civil affairs. Here is also a chamber of accounts, a board of treasury, a court for the effects of persons dying intestate, and without law∣ful heirs, a council of commerce, and a tribunal of the inquisition, many convents, chapels and hospitals, with an university, in which are professors of the several sciences, and three subordinate col∣leges. The inhabitants of this city, as of all the others in Spanish America, consist of Spaniards, Mestizoes, Mulattoes, Indians, and Negroes. The Spanish families were very numerous; there having been no fewer, at a moderate computation, before the earthquake, than eighteen thousand whites in this capital, a third or fourth part of whom consisted of the chief nobility in Peru. The great kept coaches and calashes, and chaises were so common, that no family of any note was without one. The number of mules and camels was com∣puted at eight thousand, whence we may judge of the populousness of the city, and the opu∣lence of the inhabitants, who were reckoned to a∣mount to seventy thousand, including all degrees; and to expend in rich silks, laces, pearls, and jewels, above a million sterling annually. If Lima was not subject to earthquakes, it would be one of the most desirable places of abode in the world; but, unhappily, the interval between these is never of a length sufficient to obliterate the remembrance of
<PB N="398" REF="3990"/>
them: however, though frequent and sudden, they never fail to give a short warning of their approach by a rumbling noise in the bowels of the earth, which is instantly followed by dismal howlings of the dogs. The beasts of burthen too, which hap∣pen to be passing the streets, stop, and by a natural instinct throw open their legs, the better to secure themselves from falling. Lima is not only the capi∣tal of Peru and the seat of the government, but the centre of all the trade carried on throughout South-America, distributing through the provinces the va∣rious products and manufactures, both of Asia and Europe, and receiving in return the superfluities of each, to be sent either to Europe, or to other cities and towns on the continent: in particular, all the wealth of the southern provinces, being brought to Lima, is embarked on board the fleet, which sails from Callao to Panama, about the time that the galleons arrive from Europe. The proprietors of the treasure transmit it to the merchants of Lima, who traffic at the fair with this and their own stock. The same fleet, in returning, touches at Paita, where the European merchandizes of va∣lue, purchased at Porto-Bello fair, are landed, in order to avoid the delay and danger of sailing to Callao, and sent on droves of mules to Lima; but those of less value are carried thither by sea.</P>
<P>Callao, the port of Lima, lies six miles west of it. The Spaniards have no harbour to compare with this in the South-Sea, for beauty, conveni∣ence, and security; the largest vessels may lie with perfect safety in the road of Callao, the water being extremely deep, and the port screened from the winds by the island of St. Laurence, which also breaks the surges rolling from the south-west. Before the last earthquake, neither the garrison nor fortifications were considerable; and the inhabitants did not exceed four or five hundred. We may judge of the importance of this harbour, from what
<PB N="399" REF="4000"/>
we have said of the commerce of Lima. Two flotas annually sail from hence; one for Arica, near Potosi, about the end of February, which, having received the silver on board, returns in the month of March; the other for Panama, in the beginning of May, with all the treasures and merchandize of Potosi, Chili, and Peru: those of Chili are brought by the Valparaiso fleet. Besides these fleets, two ships sail annually for Acapulco, freighted with gold and silver; and the commodities they bring back are lodged in magazines here, and retailed to all the southern provinces of America.</P>
<P>The other places of any note in this audience are, Cusco, Ariquiba, Guamanga, Truxillo, Guamcha∣co, and Sangallo.</P>
<P>Cusco, the capital of the empire of Peru before the arrival of the Spaniards, and the seat of the In∣cas, stands above three hundred and twenty-six miles from Lima towards the east. It was then very large, magnificent, and populous. Here stood the famous Temple of the Sun, which was called Curiachanchi, and contained immense riches. The incas resided in a part of the citadel, the walls of which were incrusted with gold and silver, and the whole fortress was built of stones, so long that se∣veral oxen could hardly draw one of them.</P>
<P>Cusco is still a considerable town, containing about fifteen or sixteen thousand Spaniards, Creo∣lians, and Indians. The air is said to be very pure and wholesome, and the neighbouring country very pleasant and fruitful. Here are some manufactures of bays and cotton cloth, and leather; and in the adjacent mountains are gold and silver mines.</P>
<P>Arequiba stands about one hundred leagues to the south of Lima, in the valley of Quiloa, on a fine river, by which it has a communication with the sea, distant about twenty leagues. It is one of the most beautiful and pleasant towns in all Peru,
<PB N="400" REF="4010"/>
and enjoys a good air; but is very subject to earth∣quakes. A part of the silver of Potosi and Los Charcas is brought hither to be sent to Callao.</P>
<P>Guamanga is a pretty large town, one hundred and eighty miles from Lima towards the east. Here is the see of a bishop, and an university, with professors of divinity, philosophy, and law. The trade of this town consists chiefly in gilt leather, a species of pavilions for beds, confecti∣onary pastes, marmalades, jellies, preserved quin∣ces, and other articles of luxury. The air is said to be very fine and serene.</P>
<P>Truxillo is one of the principal cities of Peru, standing two hundred and fifty miles from Lima towards the north-west, and about half a league from the sea, in a sandy soil. The houses are all low, on account of the frequent earthquakes, with which all the sea coast is visited. The inhabitants carry on a prodigious trade in wine, brandy, sugar, flax, and marmalade. Guamchaco is a small port, two leagues from Truxillo, but neither safe nor commodious.</P>
<P>Sangallo is another sea-port, about twenty-six leagues to the southward of Lima, which carries on some trade.</P>
<P>The audience of Los Charcas, or La Plata, is equal in the extent of its jurisdiction to that of Lima; but many parts of it is over-run with fo∣rests and vast deserts. It is bounded by the au∣dience of Lima on the north; by Paraguay on the east; by Chili and Tucuman on the south; and by the Pacific Ocean on the west, extending from 25 to 17°. 10′. south latitude, that is five hundred and seventy miles in a strait line; but taking in the windings of the coast, above six hun∣dred miles; and from east to west, where broad∣est, about four hundred miles.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="4020"/>
The climate is various, the coasts being insuf∣ferably hot, while the inland parts are rather upon the other extreme.</P>
<P>The soil is, generally speaking, fruitful, espe∣cially in vallies among the mountains, in the in∣land parts, most of which are well watered. The principal commodities of the country are silver, gold, pimento, commonly called Jamaica pepper, which produces to the inhabitants a neat return of six hundred thousand pieces of eight annually. Throughout the whole extent of the audience are exceeding rich mines, some near the coast, and others in the inland parts.</P>
<P>The principal towns in this audience are La Plata, Potosi, La Paz, Atacoma, Arica, Ylo, and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.</P>
<P>La Plata, the capital, which had its name from the mines in its neighbourhood, stands about two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest sea-coast to the east, and seven hundred and eighty from Lima, towards the south-east. The inhabitants, including Indians, are said to exceed fourteen thou∣sand. Here is the seat of the governor of the province, of the archbishop, an university, and court of inquisition, subordinate to that of Lima; but there is a great scarcity of water.</P>
<P>Potosi, so famous on account of the rich silver mines in its neighbourhood, stands about sixty miles from La Plata to the south-east. The Spa∣niards and Creolians here are possessed of immense riches. All their cloaths are of gold and silver stuffs, and their kitchen furniture and plates of silver, which is not to be wondered at in a country where that metal is as common as copper and iron are elsewhere. They have great frosts and snows here in May, June, and July; and the neighbour∣ing country is barren and uncouth, especially the mountains, that contain the mines. The town is
<PB N="402" REF="4030"/>
said to be near two leagues in compass, and con∣sequently the largest in Peru. There are four principal mines of silver, besides other smaller ones. Notwithstanding the barrenness of the country, the town is well provided with every necessary, some provinces sending the best of their grain and fruit, others their cattle, and others their manufactures. Those who trade in European commodities, re∣sort to Potosi, as to a market, where they are sure of converting their merchandize into silver. Another species of commerce, carried on by a set of people called Aviadores, consists in exchanging coin, towards paying the necessary expences of the workmen, for ingots and pinnos. As for the article of quicksilver, it is wholly engrossed by the crown. Though the mines do not yield a fourth part of what they did formerly, yet from the wealth of the galleons, and the number of wedges and bars of silver on board, we may conclude, that the treasure extracted at this day is very conside∣rable, and would be more so, were the Spaniards as skilful in metallurgy as some other nations. From the year 1545, when the mines were first discovered, to 1574, the king's fifth is said to have amounted to seventy-six millions of pesos, or pieces of eight.</P>
<P>The discovery of the mines is said to have been owing to the following accident: An Indian, called Hualpa, pursuing some wild goats up the moun∣tains, and coming to a steep place, laid hold of a shrub to assist his ascent, which yielding to his weight, came up by the roots, and disclosed a mass of silver. At the same time he observed large lumps of the metal in the earth, which ad∣hered to the roots of the plant. With the first fruits of his discovery, the Indian, who lived at Porco, about twenty miles from Potosi, hastened home, washed the silver, and made use of it, re¦pairing,
<PB N="403" REF="4040"/>
when his stock was exhausted, to the mountain for a new supply. In course of time, an intimate friend of his observing the extraor∣dinary change in his circumstances, was desirous of knowing the cause; and urging him closely upon this head, obtained an ample discovery of the whole secret. For some time they maintained a kind of partnership; but Hualpa refusing to disclose his method of purifying the metal, so of∣fended his comrade, that he immediately revealed the whole to his master Villareal, a Spaniard, who lived at Porco.</P>
<P>Besides the silver mines near Potosi, there are many others in the audience, especially towards Chili. There are also some of gold.</P>
<P>La Paz is a considerable town, situated near the spring-head of a river, about two hundred and twenty miles from La Plata to the north-west; and one hundred and twenty-five from the sea-coast to the east. The mountains of the adjacent coun∣try are said to abound in gold, and the plains and vallies in grain, fruit trees, and fields of maiz. About thirty miles to the north-west of this town lies the lake of Titicaca, which is said to be eighty miles in circumference, and to have a communi∣cation with the lake of Paria, distant above one hundred and twenty miles to the south, and almost as large.</P>
<P>Atacoma is a small place, forty leagues up the country from Cobija, a village on the coast, where there is a small creek or harbour. Atacoma gives name to a desert of great extent, and very wild and hideous, lying between it and Copiapo in Chili.</P>
<P>Arica stands on the sea-coast, near three hundred miles from Potosi, and has a good harbour, but contains only about one hundred and fifty families. Formerly most of the silver of Potosi was shipped here for Lima, but now it is chiefly sent by land
<PB N="404" REF="4050"/>
as the safest, though most expensive conveyance. Agi, or Guinea pepper, is much cultivated near this town.</P>
<P>Ylo is a small port, at the mouth of a river, in the 18th degree of south lat.</P>
<P>Santa Cruz de la Sierra, or the Holy Cross of the Mountain, is the capital of a little province, situated about fifty-five miles from La Plata to the north east.</P>
<P>The coast of Peru, in South America, was first discovered by some ships sent from Panama, by Vasco Numes de Bilboa, in the year 1514. They returned to him with an account of the riches that country afforded: but Vasco being recalled soon after, and put to death, it was no more thought of, till Francis Pizarro, after taking a view of it himself, went over to Spain, and procured a com∣mission from the Emperor Charles V. to impower him, and two other adventurers, to make a con∣quest of it, and share the profits; whereupon Pizarro raised a body of forces, and set sail for America, where he arrived in 1530, at Nombre de Dios in Terra-Firma. Having marched his forces over land to Panama, he embarked them there again, and landing in Peru, found the Peruvi∣ans engaged in a civil war, one party defending their lawful Prince, and the other headed by an usurper, or pretender to his throne.</P>
<P>Pizarro, joining the malecontents, made him∣self master of a town called Tumbez, where he found a prodigious treasure; after that he fell up∣on the emperor, or inca, though he had sent him an embassy, offering to submit himself and his country to the dominion of the Spaniards, defeat∣ed him, made him prisoner, and not long after put him to death. Then Pizarro having received a reinforcement from Spain under Almagro, an∣other of the adventurers, marched to Cusco, the
<PB N="405" REF="4060"/>
capital, which he took possession of in October, 1532, and on the 6th of January, 1533, he laid the foundation of Lima.</P>
<P>The emperor Charles V. being informed of these conquests, granted Pizarro the viceroyship of all that part of Peru, extending from the equator four hun∣dred leagues to the southward; and to Almagro he granted all the country two hundred leagues farther south. Whereupon Almagro marched to the south∣ward, and invaded Chili, after he had, with great difficulty, passed the Andes, on which he lost most of his men. Having made some progress in the conquest of Chili, upon hearing that Pizarro had made his brother governor of Cusco, and in∣tended to dispute his right to that capital, he re∣turned to Peru, over the desert by the sea-side, which extended two hundred leagues, by which march his men suffered as much by the heat and want of water, as they had done in the moun∣tains by the cold: however, he at length arrived at Cusco, and made Ferdinando Pizarro, the go∣vernor, prisoner. Thus began a civil war between Almagro and Francis Pizarro, which continued some time with various success; but at length Al∣magro was defeated, taken prisoner, and put to death by the Pizarro's.</P>
<P>And now the viceroy Pizarro being solely pos∣sessed of the empire of Peru, extended his con∣quests farther south, sending the famous Baldivia to penetrate farther into Chili; and about the same time discovered the silver mines of La Plata and Potosi.</P>
<P>In the mean time the viceroy continuing to op∣press the Almagrians, young Almagro, the natu∣ral son of the conqueror, formed a party against him, and killed him in his palace at Lima: after which the young Almagro was proclaimed viceroy of Peru, on the 26th of June, 1540; but Vacca
<PB N="406" REF="4070"/>
de Castro, a new viceroy, arriving from Europe, defeated Almagro, took him prisoner, and be∣headed him.</P>
<P>Gonzalo Pizarro, afterwards usurping the go∣vernment, was defeated and put to death by Gasco, the president of Lima, anno 1548. This insurrec∣tion being suppressed, several commanders were sent upon new conquests, and particularly Baldivia, to endeavour to compleat the conquest of Chili. Ac∣ingly Baldivia entered upon this conquest in 1540, and founded the capital city of St. Jago in 1541. He afterwards built the town of Coquimbo, or Se∣rena; but the civil wars breaking out again in Peru, he was obliged to return thither, leaving the command of his forces to Francisco Villagra, his lieutenant, from whom the Chilisians recovered great part of their country again; and it was with difficulty that Villagra defended himself in St. Jago. Baldivia returning to Chili with a strong reinforce∣ment of troops, relieved his lieutenant, who was besieged in St. Jago, recovered the country he had lost, and built the town of Conception, Baldivia, and Imperial; but tyrannizing over the Chilisians, it occasioned a general revolt, in which Baldivia was taken prisoner, and put to death by pouring melted gold down his throat. Most of the towns he had built were taken, and the Spaniards, in a manner, driven out of Chili: however, they re∣covered the towns near the sea-coast. The Dutch endeavoured to settle colonies on this coast in the year 1643, but could not effect it. In the year 1670, Sir John Narborough was sent by king Charles II. to take a view of the coast of Chili; but on the report he made of his voyage, it was not thought adviseable to attempt to make any settlement on that side. There is a cluster of islands called the Gallipagos, lying four hundred miles west of Peru, under the equator.</P>
<P><PB N="407" REF="4080"/>
According to Ulloa, the audience of Los Char∣cas comprehends also the province of Tucuman, with Paraguay.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>TUCUMAN.</HEAD>
<P>Although the Spaniards possess only a few cities, in the extensive province of Tucuman, they have nevertheless the dominion of the whole. Ulloa ex∣presly calls it a government within the jurisdiction of Los Charcas; but neither he, nor any other writer, ascertains its exact limits, or describes the country with any degree of accuracy. It lies to the westward of Paraguay, and south of the river of Plate; but where it begins or ends we cannot precisely determine. According to the latest geo∣graphers, it does not extend beyond the 37°. of south latitude. Ulloa says it reaches from north to south, above one hundred leagues. The cities possessed by the Spaniards, are St. Jago del Estero, so called from a river on which it is situated, whose inundations greatly contribute to fertilize the adja∣cent land, St. Miguel del Tucuman, Neustra Senno∣ra de Talavara, Cordova de la Nueva, Andalusia, Rioja, and the large village of San Salvador. The two first of these are the most considerable; the two last are small, and built without order or symmetry. The chief design of the court of Madrid in maintain∣ing settlements here, is to secure a communication between the colonies on the South and North Seas; for the commodities of the country of themselves would hardly reimburse the expence of keeping garrisons: they consist chiefly in honey, wax, sugar, wine, cotton, woollen stuffs manufactured by the natives; and mules, much admired for their strength and agility, on which account, great numbers of them are exported to the other pro∣vinces of South America.</P>

<HEAD>PARAGUAY.</HEAD>
<P>Paraguay, or La Plata, is bounded by the country of the Amazons on the north; by Bra∣zil on the east; by Patagonia on the south; and by Peru and Chili on the west; extending, it is said, fifteen hundred miles in length, from north to south, and almost as much in breadth. It takes the names of Paraguay and La Plata, from the rivers so called. The land, generally speaking, is very rich and fruitful, producing plenty of wheat, and other European grain, rice, Indian corn, sugar∣canes, some vines, and whole woods of peaches, almonds, figs, &amp;c. together with cotton, indigo, pimento, ipecacuanha, a great variety of other drugs and herbs; among which is that called Paraguay, which probably gives name to the river, and is an excellent emetic, used not only by the Indians, but by the Spaniards and Portuguese, all over Peru, Chili, and Brazil. As this is the only country where it is produced, the demand for it is so great, that it would suffice alone to form a very flourish∣ing trade, were there no other article of commerce; but, besides the abovementioned, here are also vast herds of cattle, with horses, mules, sheep, and goats, hogs wild and tame, and plenty of fish, fowls, and venison. The Portuguese and Spaniards kill great numbers of the cattle merely for their hides and tallow. There is a kind of boars, whose navel is said to grow upon their backs, and whose flesh is not only very wholesome and nourishing, but of a most delicate taste. Of wild beasts, here are ba∣boons very tall and strong, lions, tygers, leopards, foxes &amp;c. some of the snakes are said to be of a monstrous size, namely twenty or thirty feet in length, and several feet round. The rivers breed great numbers of alligators and crocodiles, which
<PB N="409" REF="4100"/>
are said to be harmless, and very good to eat, especially roasted. Mines not only of iron and cop∣per, but of gold, silver, and the finest amethysts, we are told, have been discovered in this country; but whether any of them are wrought, we cannot say.</P>
<P>To the west of the great river Paraguay, are vast plains, extending some hundred miles, with very little wood upon them, and scarce a hill to be seen; but in that part of the country which lies to the east of the river, and is divided from Brazil by a ridge of mountains, where the Jesuits are said to have erected a temporal and spiritual monarchy, there is a variety of hills and valleys, woods, and plains: this part of the country is also well culti∣vated. Whether the Jesuits still maintain their authority here, since their expulsion from the domi∣nions of Spain and Portugal, we cannot positively say. But this much is certain, that, before that happened, they not only refused to submit to the edicts of those powers, but even opposed their troops in the field; which, among other causes, must undoubtedly have contributed not a little to their expulsion.</P>
<P>The chief river of this country is the Paraguay, from which it takes its name; and which, after issuing from the Laguna de Los Xarayes, in 15°. south latitude, it runs through it from north to south, and is joined by several other rivers. A∣bout the 28°. it is joined by the Paranas, and about the 30°. by the Uragua, a large river, and, near Buenos Ayres, by the river of Plate, which rises in Peru, and after its junction gives name to the river, till it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, fifty leagues below Buenos Ayres. There are also many lakes in Paraguay, the chief of which are the Xaraya, Caracoraes, and Venoras.</P>
<P>The climate of Paraguay is very little different from that of Spain; and the distinctions between
<PB N="410" REF="4110"/>
the seasons much the same. In winter, indeed, violent tempests of wind and rain are very frequent, accompanied with such dreadful claps of thunder and lightning, as fill the inhabitants, though used to them, with terror and consternation. In sum∣mer, the excessive heats are mitigated by gentle breezes, which constantly begin at eight or nine in the morning. In short, for the enjoyment of life, especially with regard to the salubrity of the air, a finer country cannot be imagined.</P>
<P>The following extracts from Charlevoix's History of this country, will not, we presume, be un∣acceptable to our readers.</P>
<P>Almost every forest of this country abounds with bees, which make their hives in the hollow of trees. There are here ten different species of these useful insects. That most esteemed for the white∣ness of its wax, and the delicacy of its honey, is called opemus, but is very scarce. The cotton∣tree is a native of the country, and grows in thickets, as in Louisiana. The Spaniards sow and use hemp in pretty large quantities.</P>
<P>Besides maiz, manioc, and potatoes, which thrive very well in several places, and in which the food of those Indians who cultivate the earth chiefly consists, there are in this country many fruits and simples not known in Europe. In par∣ticular, there are some fruits, of which the Spani∣ards make excellent sweetmeats. Some have plant∣ed vines, which do not thrive equally well in every district. Wheat has been sown in some places; but it is seldom made use of but for cakes, and other things of that kind. There are every where venomous herbs, with which some Indians poison their arrows; but the antidotes are equally com∣mon; and among others, the herb called Sparrows herb, which forms pretty large bushes, and was discovered, and obtained its name, in the following manner.</P>
<P><PB N="411" REF="4120"/>
Among the different kinds of sparrows found in these provinces, most of which are of the size of our black-birds, there is a very pretty one called Macagua. This little creature is very fond of the flesh of vipers, against whom, for this reason, he wages a continual war. As soon, therefore, as he spies one of these reptiles, he whips his head under his wing, and gathers himself up into a round ball, without the least appearance of life or motion; he does not, however, cover his eyes so entirely, but that he may peep through the feathers of his wing, and observe the motions of his game, which he suffers to approach without stirring, until he finds it near enough to receive a stroke of his bill, which he then suddenly discharges at it. The viper im∣mediately returns the compliment with another of his tongue, but the minute the sparrow finds him∣self wounded, he flies to his herb, eats some of it, and is instantly cured. He then returns to the charge, and has recourse to his herb every time the viper stings him. This conflict lasts till the viper, destitute of the same resource, has lost all his blood; as soon as the reptile is dead, the sparrow falls to work upon the carcase, and concludes the feast with a new dose of his antidote.</P>
<P>There are few countries which breed so great a number, and so many different species of serpents and such other reptiles; but there are a great many of them no way poisonous, or whose poison is any way dangerous. The Indians know these innocent though frightful reptiles, take them up alive in their hands, and make girdles of them, without any bad consequence. There are some of these creatures twenty-two feet long, and proportionably thick, that swallow whole stags, if we may believe the Spaniards, who assure us they have been eye∣witnesses to their feats this way. The Indians say, that these monsters engender at the mouth, that
<PB N="412" REF="4130"/>
the young ones tear their way into the world through the sides of their mothers, after which the strongest devours the weakest. And were it not for this disposition of Providence, Father Anthony Ruiz de Montoya, who seems to credit this account, observes, that it would be impossible to stir out of doors, without meeting with these terrible animals. Among those who are oviparous, there are some which lay very large eggs, and make use of in∣cubation to hatch them.</P>
<P>The rattle-snake, so common in several provinces of North-America, is no where more so than in Pa∣raguay. It has been observed in this country, that this reptile suffers greatly when its gums are too much distended with venom; and that, to get rid of this venom, it falls upon every thing in its way with two crooked fangs, pretty large at their roots, but terminating in a point, and, by means of a hol∣low in these fangs, pours into the wound it makes all the humour that tormented it. The effects of the bite of this and many other kinds of serpents is very sudden; sometimes the blood issues vio∣lently at the eyes, nose, ears, gums, and roots of the nails; but there are antidotes to be found every where against this poison. The most successful are, a stone to which they have given the name of St. Paul, bezoard, and a poultice of chewed gar∣lick. The very head of the animal, and its liver, which is likewise eaten to purify the blood, are equally efficacious. The surest method, however, is to begin by making an incision directly in the part that has been stung, and then apply brimstone to it; nay, this drug alone has been often found to make a perfect cure.</P>
<P>There are here, likewise, some hunting serpents, which climb up the trees to discover their prey, and from thence dart upon it when within reach, squeeze it so tight that it cannot stir, and then de∣vour
<PB N="413" REF="4140"/>
it alive at their leisure. But when they have eat up whole carcases, they become so heavy that they cannot move; and, as they have not some∣times a sufficient degree of natural heat to digest such enormous meals, would inevitably become the victims of their own voracity, did not nature suggest to them a remedy, which reason certainly would never permit them to employ. On this oc∣casion, the monster turns up his belly to the sun, whose heat makes it putrify; the worms then breed in it, and the birds coming to their assistance, feed upon a superfluity, which otherwise would most certainly kill him: the patient takes care not to let the birds go too great lengths, and, in a short time after this extraordinary operation, finds himself as well as ever. But it often happens, they say, that the skin of the serpent closes upon the branches of trees, upon which he has been in too great haste to station himself; this is a scrape, out of which he must find it a much more difficult matter to extri∣cate himself than the former.</P>
<P>Many of these reptiles live upon fish; and Fa∣ther Montoya, from whom I have taken almost all these particulars, informs us, that he happened one day to espy a huge snake, whose head was as big as a calf's, fishing on the banks of a river. The first thing that the monster did was to discharge by its mouth a great quantity of foam into the river; he then thrust his head into the water, and kept it very quiet, till a great many small fishes, attracted by the foam, had gathered about it; when, suddenly opening his jaws, he laid about him, and swallowed the fish in great numbers. Another time, the same author assures us, he saw an Indian of the tallest stature, who happened to be fishing up to his mid∣dle in water, swallowed alive by a huge snake, which the next day vomited his prey ashore, quite whole, all to the bones, which were crushed to
<PB N="414" REF="4150"/>
pieces, as if they had been bruised between two mill-stones. This monstrous species of reptiles never quit the water; and in the rapids, which are pretty common in the Parana, they are often seen swimming with a huge tail, and their head, which is likewise very large, above water. The In∣dians say, that they engender in the same manner as land animals; and that the males often attack women, as it is pretended monkeys do in some countries. One thing, however, is certain, and that is, that Father Montoya was one day called upon to hear the confession of an Indian woman, whom, while she was washing some linen on the banks of a river, one of these animals attacked, and, as she said, offered violence to her. The mis∣sionary found her stretched upon the spot, where she said the thing had happened: she told him, "She was sure she had but a few minutes to live;" and, in fact, expired almost as soon as she had finished her confession.</P>
<P>Paraguay was first discovered by Sebastian Ga∣boto, who passed from Rio de la Plata, in 1526, to the river Parana, in small barks, and thence entered the river called Paraguay. Don Pedro de Men∣doza, the first governor of Buenos-Ayres, gave Juan de Ayolos a commission, and a body of forces, to complete the reduction of it; but it was the Je∣suits who first brought a considerable part of it in∣to actual obedience. Soon after Juan de Sobras had founded the city called Nuestra Senora de la Assumption, a few Jesuits went to Paraguay, pro∣perly so called, and converted about fifty Indian families; who soon induced many others to follow their example, on account of the peace and tran∣quility they enjoyed under the direction of the fathers. They had long disdained to submit to the arms of the Portuguese and Spaniards; but the Je∣suits, by learning their language, conforming to
<PB N="415" REF="4160"/>
their manners, cultivating their minds, and incul∣cating such doctrines as were most likely to pro∣mote their views, soon acquired great authority among them, and made numerous converts, till at last, by steadily pursuing the same artful measures, they arrived at that degree of power and influence they now or lately possessed, as being in a manner the absolute sovereigns of a great part of this ex∣tensive country; for above three hundred and fifty thousand families are said to have been subject to the fathers, living in an obedience and awe border∣ing upon adoration; yet procured without any vio∣lence, or constraint. There were above threescore parishes on the banks of the rivers Paraguay and Parana, not exceeding the distance of thirty miles from each other: in each of these there was a Je∣suit, supreme in all causes, civil, military, and ec∣clesiastic, who might be regarded as a petty prince, governing not only with the sway of a sovereign, but with the influence and reputation of an oracle. He nominated the chiefs in all the different de∣partments; the cacique held of him; the general received his commission and instructions from him; and all his decisions were without appeal. The same reverend father who presided over the civil oeconomy, assisted by two others, performed also all the duties of a parish-priest; catechising the In∣dians, saying mass, exhorting, marrying, confes∣sing, imposing penance, visiting the sick, and chaunting in the churches, which are very neat and elegant. Such was the idea conveyed of the beha∣viour of these fathers by the writers of their or∣der, particularly the celebrated Muratori: fame, however, treated their characters with more severi∣ty, and accused them of pride and haughtiness, in carrying their authority to an excess, so far as to cause even the magistrates to be corrected before them with stripes, while they suffered persons of
<PB N="416" REF="4170"/>
the highest distinction, within their jurisdiction, to kiss the hems of their garments, as the greatest ho∣nour to which they could possibly arrive. To this might be added, the utter abolition of all ideas of property, which indeed was rendered useless, by the general magazines and storehouses which they established, and from which, and the herds of cat∣tle kept for the public use, they supplied the wants of individuals, as occasion required; yet it reflected on the character of the fraternity, that they pos∣sessed large property themselves, and claimed the absolute disposal of the meanest effects in Para∣guay. All manufactures were theirs; every natu∣ral commodity was brought to them; and the treasures remitted yearly to the superior of the or∣der were a proof, that zeal for religion was not the only motive that induced the reverend fathers to encounter so many difficulties, and labour so inde∣fatigably in these missions.</P>
<P>Besides the parochial or provincial governments, there was a kind of supreme council, composed of an annual meeting of all the fathers, who concerted the measures necessary for promoting the common concerns of the mission, framed new laws, correct∣ed or abolished old ones, and adapted every thing else to circumstances. It is said to have been one of the great objects of the annual councils, to take such measures as should effectually deprive strangers of all intelligence concerning the state of the mis∣sion. Hence the natives were restrained from learning the Spanish tongue; and were taught, that it was dangerous to their salvation to hold any intercourse with a subject of Spain or Portugal. But the circumstance that rendered their designs most liable to suspicion was, the establishment of a military force: every parish had its corps of horse and foot, who were duly exercised every Sunday; and it was said, the whole amounted to a body of
<PB N="417" REF="4180"/>
seventy or eighty thousand well-disciplined troops, amazingly expert in the use of firelocks and bay∣onets, and also of slings, with which they threw stones of four or five pounds weight, with astonish∣ing force and dexterity.</P>
<P>Such was the state of this country some years ago. As to its present situation, we can advance nothing positively, for want of authentic intelli∣gence.</P>
<P>The natives of Paraguay are of a moderate stature, and well proportioned, their faces flat, and rather round than oval, their complexion olive; and they have long black hair, as strong as horsehair: they formerly wore the skin of some beast over their shoulders, as a mantle, and another about the waist, but now conform to the Spanish fashions. They are a brave people, but lazy and indolent, and dull at invention; but imitate almost any thing, and are become excellent mechanics, since the Europeans furnished them with patterns.</P>
<P>Formerly they worshipped the sun, moon and stars, thunder and lightning, groves, rivers, and animals, and allowed of polygamy and concu∣binage; so that the greatest objection they had at first to Christianity was, that one man was con∣fined by it to one woman. It is said, when a young Indian woman saw a fellow she liked, she used to acquaint the missionary with it, who sent for the man and proposed the matter to him; if he ap∣proved of it, the match was made, and the priest gave them his blessing. Some of the unconverted tribes are said to fatten the prisoners they make, and to feast on them. Dead bodies among some are laid up in great pots, which, from a notion that the souls are buried with them, they take care to cover with hollow or concave lids, to pre∣vent their being stifled. The wives of the caciques, or petty princes, wear a kind of triple crown made
<PB N="418" REF="4190"/>
of straw, and their lords hang doe-skins over their shoulders; the rest wear only a piece wrapped round their middle, and hanging down to their knees. The boys and girls go quite naked. They wrap up their infants as soon as born in a tiger's skin, and give them the breast for a little while, and then a piece of half raw meat to suck. At the death of a near relation the men cut off a finger of their left hand, in token of mourning; and if it be a handsome daughter, they make a great feast and drink out of her skull. Their beds are the hides of oxen, or tygers, spread on the ground; but the people of rank use hammocks of net∣work.</P>
<P>The above-mentioned Father Charlevoix thus characterizes the savages of Paraguay. The na∣tives in general, but especially the Chaconese, and the Guaranis, are of an advantageous stature; and there have been found men among them above seven feet high. Their features differ greatly from ours; and the colours, with which they paint them∣selves, give them such an aspect, that strangers can∣not, at first sight, help being terrified a little. And, accordingly, they pretend by this means to strike a terror into their enemies. A Spanish captain, who had served with reputation in Europe, having been commanded against some Indians of Chaco, that lived pretty near Santa Fe, was so thunder∣struck with their appearance, that he fainted away. Most of the men go quite naked, all to a parcel of feathers, of different colours, hanging to a string about their waist. But at their public solemnities, they wear caps made of the same feathers. In very cold weather, they wrap themselves up in a kind of cap and cloak, made of skins pretty well dressed, and adorned with painted figures. Among some nations the women are not better covered than the men. The bad qualities common to all these
<PB N="419" REF="4200"/>
people, are ferocity, inconstancy, perfidy, and drunkenness. They are all sprightly, though very dull of apprehension in every thing that does not fall immediately under the senses. There is, pro∣perly speaking, no form of government among them; every town indeed has its cacique; but these chiefs have no authority, but in proportion to the esteem they have acquired. Several do nothing but rove from place to place with their furniture, which consists of nothing but a mat, a hammock, and a calabash. The cabins of those who live in towns, are, among several nations, no better than wretched hovels made with branches of trees, and covered with straw, or rather grass. Those who live nearest to Tucuman, are, it seems, better lodged and better cloathed.</P>
<P>Their favourite liquor is chica, of which I have already made mention. They assemble to drink it, and to dance and sing; and in these exercises they persist till they are all drunk. They then quarrel, and from words soon proceed to blows; so that their merry-makings seldom terminate without bloodshed, if not in the death of some of the guests. Several take advantage of the confusion to be revenged on their enemies. These exercises are almost peculiar to the men. The women gene∣rally withdraw, the moment they perceive the liquor begins to get the better of the men, and carry off with them all the arms they can lay their hands upon. A small matter is sufficient to breed a war between these nations; but their unconquerable inveteracy against the Spaniards easily unites them again, on the first alarm from that quarter.</P>
<P>Almost all these Indians are anthropophagites, or man-eaters, and have no other occupation but war and pillage, which they exercise with such craft and obstinacy, that they have rendered themselves formidable to their neighbours, particularly the
<PB N="420" REF="4210"/>
Spaniards, who do not chuse to engage them, even when surprized, with equal arms; their courage, in that case, changing to fury. Nay, many of their women have been known on such occasions, to sell their lives at a very dear rate, rather than surrender to the best armed soldiers. When they have re∣solved to plunder a country-seat, or village, there is no art they do not practice to lull the inhabitants into a fatal security, or get out of their way, when they have struck their blow. They will watch for whole years, the opportunity of surprizing them, without running any risk. For this purpose, they have spies abroad, who never march but by night; when they make nothing of crawling along, if re∣quisite, on their elbows, which, for this reason, are always covered with a callus. Some Spaniards have been weak enough to think, that these spies, by some magic power, asumed the forms of do∣mestic animals, in order to examine what was doing in their houses.</P>
<P>Their arms are bows and arrows, and the manca∣na, a kind of lance or javelin, made of a very hard, and very heavy wood, pretty thick, fifteen palms long, and terminating in a deer's horn, with a beard to it. This weapon they use with great strength and dexterity; and by means of a rope, to which it is fastened, draw in the man it has wounded unless he had resolution enough to pull it out They generally saw the necks of their prisoner with the jaw-bone of a fish, and then pull off hi scalp, which they preserve as a monument of their victory, and display in all their entertainments.</P>
<P>They are such bold and able horsemen, that the Spaniards will repent but once, their having so we stocked with horses all these parts of the continent Swift as these animals are, the Indians of Chac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stop them in full speed, and vault upon them, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> matter whether sideways or from behind, without
<PB N="421" REF="4220"/>
any assistance but that of their javelins, upon which they spring. They then, without stirrups or bri∣dles, without any thing in short but a halter, not only keep their seat, but turn the proud animal which way they please, and make him fly at such a rate, as to leave behind them the best mounted Spaniards. As most of them go always naked, their skin is very hard. Father Locano assures us, he has seen the head of a Mocovi, the skin of which was half an inch thick.</P>
<P>The women of Chaco prick their faces, breasts, and arms, like the Moorish women of Africa and Spain; they are very robust, bring forth with great ease, and, as soon as delivered, bathe themselves and children in the next lake or river. They are treated by their husbands with great severity, because per∣haps, they are very much addicted to jealousy, and have no manner of tenderness for their children. They bury their dead on the very spot where they expire; and plant a javelin over the grave, fasten∣ing to it the skull of an enemy, especially of a Spaniard, if they can get one. They then remove from the place, and even avoid passing it, till the deceased is totally forgotten.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Paraguay, upon the Eastern Guayra, at the first arrival of the Spaniards in that part of America, lived in towns that were pretty populous, and the caciques of which, by being hereditary and independent of one another, had a great deal of authority over their subjects. Sometimes, however, as it happens in all nations more addicted to the arts of war than those of peace, private persons acquired this rank by their valour; and not seldom by a singular facility in speaking well the language of the country, which, according to Father Montoya, who was a perfect master of it, yields in nothing to any of the finest we are acquainted with. The chief prerogatives
<PB N="422" REF="4230"/>
enjoyed by the caciques, consisted in a right to the labour of their subjects, for the purposes of agricul∣ture; and the use of their daughters, when they required it.</P>
<P>At the death of a cacique, it was lawful for one of his brothers to marry the widow; but this sel∣dom happened. In general, these Indians did not approve of such marriages between near relations; and the men among them, who have embraced the Christian religion, never marry any of their rela∣tions, even within those degrees with which the church readily dispenses. But the caciques could have more wives than one. As to their religion, they acknowledged but one God; for if they ex∣pressed any veneration for the bones of their jug∣glers, whom they had seen perform such things in their life-time, as, in their opinion, surpassed the strength of nature, they by no means considered them as divinities, though the species of worship they paid them differed but little from that which other nations pay their idols. They never, howe∣ver, offered any sacrifices to God; nor could any regular form of worship be discovered among them.</P>
<P>They reckoned their years by winters; but sel∣dom went beyond ten, without making a mistake. They judged of its being time to rise, when the Pleiades began to make their appearance above the horizon. They imagined there was a tiger and a great dog in the heavens, which devoured the sun and the moon, as often as these luminaries hap∣pened to be eclipsed; and these events greatly alarmed them. The husbands, on their wives be∣ing brought to bed, observed a rigorous fast; and neither hunted nor conversed with any one during that time, firmly believing, that the child's life de∣pended on their punctually complying with this custom. They used a kind of baptism; but au∣thors
<PB N="223" REF="4240"/>
do not give us any satisfactory account of it. But the ceremonies they observed in giving names to their new-born children, will best serve to give us a just idea of the savageness of this nation. Thinking it unlawful to perform the ceremony with∣out the death of a prisoner of war, they deferred it, till they could make one. After entertaining him plentifully for several days, and even giving him his choice of as many young girls, or grown up women as he thought proper, they cut his throat on the day appointed for that purpose, with great ceremony. As soon as he was dead, every one touched his body, or struck it with a stick; and during this operation they gave names to all the children, that had not as yet received any. This done, the body was cut up, and every family took home a piece of it to make into broth, of which every one took a mouthful, not excepting children at the breast, whom their mothers took care to make partakers of this hellish repast.</P>
<P>Their manner of receiving persons, returned from a long journey, had something very odd in it. The traveller, on entering his cabbin, im∣mediately seated himself, without uttering a single syllable; and, the next moment the women began to walk round and round him, observing, all the time, the same silence, till at last they suddenly burst out into exclamations, which were followed by a long relation of all the disagreeable events that had happened in his family, during his ab∣sence; the men, covering their faces, repeated the same things with a low voice; and this ceremony lasted a longer or shorter time in proportion to the esteem they had for the traveller. At last they all congratulated him on his happy arrival, and enter∣tained him in the best manner they were able.</P>
<P>The women, on the death of their husbands, used to throw themselves from some eminence, high
<PB N="424" REF="4250"/>
enough to cripple themselves the remainder of their lives. The Indians believed, that the soul, on its leaving the body, never wandered at any great dis∣tance from it, but kept it company in the grave, where they, accordingly, left a vacancy for it to reside in. The first who embraced the Gospel, could scarce be prevailed on to renounce this prac∣tice; and Christian women have been pretty often discovered going privately to the graves of their children and husbands, in order to sift the mould over them, as their souls, they said, would be too much burthened without this precaution.</P>
<P>When a girl was old enough to be married, they put her into the hands of a woman, who, for eight days together, employed her in most laborious tasks; fed her very ill, and withal never gave her a moment's rest. By her manner of bearing this trial, they judged if she was laborious, and other∣wise qualified to undertake the care of a family. At the expiration of this term, they cut off her hair, and declared her marriageable. It would have been criminal in a young woman to keep company with a man before she had passed through this trial; or, at least, she must have done it very privately, to escape punishment.</P>
<P>The Guaranis placed great faith in certain men, who at once acted the part of fortune-tellers and physicians, pretending to draw certain information of what was to happen from the singing of birds; and to have received from heaven the power of cur∣ing all manner of diseases. Their whole quackery, however, consisted in sucking the part affected, and then pretending to extract from it something, which they had the precaution of taking into their mouths before they went to work; but pro∣duced, with the greatest assurance, as the cause of all the patient's illness, whose imagination they greatly calmed by this stratagem. This, no doubt,
<PB N="425" REF="4260"/>
was doing a great deal. Besides, they never wor∣ried their patients with drugs and operations; so that if they did not assist nature, neither did they obstruct her; and if they did not cure, neither did they kill their patients. The Guaranis had like∣wise their conjurers, who boasted a power of killing whoever they thought proper; and had, in fact, so far bewitched numbers, as to make them believe that several had been carried off by the secret power of their incantations; so that it was sometimes enough for a man to have an enemy, to be seized with a pa∣nic, and even die of it, if he had not wherewith to bribe these impostors.</P>
<P>Paraguay is divided into several provinces, which take their names from the rivers that pass through it, and of which Paraguay and La Plata, proper∣ly so called, are the chief. Paraguay contains several towns, but none of any note besides Assump∣tion, which is situated in 25°. 11′. according to the latest observations, at the conflux of the rivers Parana and Paraguay, and is a large well built and populous city. It was built by the Spaniards, anno 1538. The territory about it is exceeding rich and fruitful, and the air so temperate, that the trees are cloathed with a constant delightful verdure.</P>
<P>La Plata sometimes denotes the whole of Para∣guay, and sometimes only a part or province of it. In the latter sense it comprehends all that country bounded on the east and south-east by the Atlantic Ocean; on the south by Terra Magellanica; on the west by Tucuman; and on the north by the provinces of Paraguay Proper, and Parana. It takes its name from the great river La Plata, first discovered, in 1515, by Juan Diaz de Solis; but denominated La Plata by Sebastian Gabato, from the great quantity of the precious metals he pro∣cured from the adjacent inhabitants, imagining it
<PB N="426" REF="4270"/>
was the produce of the country, though, in fact, they brought it from Peru.</P>
<P>This country lies between 32 and 37°. of south latitude. The climate is pleasant and healthy. Their winter is in May, June, and July, when the nights are indeed very cold, but the days moderate∣ly warm; the frost is neither violent nor lasting, and the snows very inconsiderable.</P>
<P>The country consists mostly of plains of a vast extent, and exceeding rich soil, producing all sorts of European and American fruits, wheat, maiz, cotton, sugar, honey, &amp;c. and abounding with such excellent pastures, that the beasts brought hi∣ther from Spain are multiplied to such a degree, that they are all in common, no man claiming any property in them, but every man takes what he hath occasion for. The number of black cattle, especially, is so prodigious, that many thousands of them are killed merely for their hides, every time the ships go for Spain, and their carcases left to be devoured by wild beasts and birds of prey, which are also very numerous. Sometimes, when they cannot vend their hides, they will kill them for their tongues; and those who care not to be at the trouble to fetch them from the plains, may buy them for a trifle. There is a curious account in lord Anson's voyage of the manner of hunting them on horseback; and of catching and killing them, by throwing a noose on their horns at full gallop, the horses being trained to the sport. Horses are no less numerous, and in common, like the other cattle; so that a man may have as many as he pleases for the catching, and of those that are already broke, one may buy some of the best, and of the true Spanish breed, for a piece of eight per head. Wild-fowl also is in great plenty here; partridges, in particular, are more numerous, and as large and tame as our hens; so that one may
<PB N="427" REF="4280"/>
kill them with a stick. Their wheat makes the finest and whitest of bread; and, in a word, they seem to want for nothing here, especially the na∣tives, but salt and fuel. The former the Spaniards have brought to them from other parts; and the latter they supply themselves with, by planting vast numbers of almond, peach, and other trees, which re∣quire no other trouble than putting the kernels into the ground, and by the next year, we are told, they begin to bear fruit. The return for European commodities is so great here, that it almost exceeds belief; an ordinary two-penny knife fetching a crown, and a gun of the value of ten or twelve shil∣lings, twenty or thirty crowns, and so of the rest.</P>
<P>The river of Plate, as we observed already, rises in Peru, and receives a great many others in its course, the chief of which is the Paraguay. The water of it is said to be very clear and sweet, and to petrify wood, and contains such plenty and variety of fish, that the people catch great quantities of them without any other instrument than their hands. It runs mostly to the south and south-east, and is navigable the greater part of its course by the largest vessels, and full of delightful islands. All along its banks are seen the most beautiful birds of all kinds; but it sometimes overflows the adjacent country to a great extent, and is infested by ser∣pents of a prodigious bigness. From its junction with the Paraguay to its mouth is above two hun∣dred leagues. We may form some judgment of its largeness by the width of its mouth, which is said to be about seventy leagues. Before it falls into the Paraguay, it is called Panama.</P>
<P>Nuestra Sennora de Buenos Ayres, the capital of the province, taking its name from the pleasantness of the climate, was founded in 1535, under the di∣rection of Pedro de Mendoza, at that time go∣vernor. It stands on a point called Cape Blanco,
<PB N="428" REF="4290"/>
on the south side of the Plata, fronting a small ri∣ver, in 34°. 34′. 38″. of south latitude, in a fine plain, rising by a gentle ascent from the river. Nothing can exceed the temperature of the air, the fertility of the soil, or the beautiful verdure, which overspreads the whole face of the country about this city, of which the inhabitants have an uninterrupted prospect, as far as the eye can reach. Buenos Ayres has streight broad streets, and is of a considerable extent, containing no less than three thousand houses, built mostly of chalk or brick. Here is a very handsome square, with a magnifi∣cent cathedral, and a castle, in which the governor holds his court, with a garrison of three thousand men. The Spaniards bring hither part of the treasures of Peru down the river, and ship them for Spain, with vast quantities of hides, and other com∣modities of this country. The river is here seven leagues in breadth, and navigable by any ship six∣ty leagues above the town, and no farther, by rea∣son of a cataract.</P>
<P>Within the government of Buenos Ayres are three other towns, called Monte de Video, Corri∣entes, and Santa Fé; but they are not large enough to merit a description.</P>

<HEAD>CHILI.</HEAD>
<P>The viceroyalty of Peru extends not only over those vast countries within the jurisdiction of the audiences of Lima and Los Charcos, but those also in the audience of Chili.</P>
<P>Chili, taken in a large sense, reaches from the frontiers of Peru to the Straits of Magellan, the distance being three hundred and fifty leagues. These two kingdoms are separated by the district of Atacama, which extends eighty leagues between the province of the same name, being the last of Peru,
<PB N="429" REF="4300"/>
and the Valley of Copayapu, the first in Chili. Eastward, some parts of this kingdom terminate on the frontiers of Paraguay, properly so called, though some uninhabited deserts intervene, and others on the government of Buenos Ayres, or La Plata, properly so called; though between these are the pampas, or wide extended plains. Its western boundary is the South-Sea, extending near∣ly from 27°. the latitude of Copayapu, to 53°. 30′. south. But to confine ourselves to the true extent of this kingdom, as inhabited by the Spa∣niards, it begins at Copayapu, and terminates at the large island of Chiloe, the southern extremity of which is in 24°. of south latitude; and its extent, from west to east, is the distance between the Cor∣dillera, which is here of a stupendous height, and the coast of the South-Sea.</P>
<P>Chili lying south of the equator, the seasons are al∣most opposite to those in the northern hemisphere; but the face of the country, except on the sea-coast, is beautiful, and the climate wholesome. On the east, the country is skreened by the Andes; while, from the west, the air is cooled by the most refreshing sea-breezes. Along the coast of the Pacific Ocean, they enjoy not only a fine temperate air, but a clear serene heaven, most part of the year. Sometimes, indeed, the winds that blow from the mountains are exceeding sharp in winter; but, in general, this is one of the most comfortable climates in the world, being a medium between the intense heats of the torrid zone and the piercing colds of the frigid.</P>
<P>The Andes, being covered with snow great part of the year, supply the country with innumerable rivulets, which greatly contribute to its extraordi∣nary fertility. There are many vulcanos among these mountains, and the air is so sharp and subtle, that they cannot be passed without great danger.
<PB N="430" REF="4310"/>
They run almost from one end of America to the other, beginning in Terra-Magellanica or Patago∣nia, and traversing the kingdom of Chili, the pro∣vince of Buenos Ayres, the empire of Peru, the audience of Quito, the vast region of Terra-Firma; and then, contracting themselves, as it were, for a passage, at the Isthmus of Darien, widen again, and pass through the provinces and kingdoms of Nica∣ragua, Guatimala, Costa-Rica, Mexico, and others more to the northward. In Chili they are said to be of such a vast height, that the Alps are no more than hillocks to them.</P>
<P>The soil of Chili, in general, is amazingly fertile, producing Indian and European corn, hemp, wine, fruits, and all the necessaries of life in the greatest a∣bundance and perfection. The produce of the Eu∣ropean fruit trees here is so exuberant, that the boughs must be propped, to enable them to bear the weight of the fruit. The orchards, in particular, yield great quantities of all kinds of apples. The strawberries are as big as pears, and most com∣monly red, but in some places white and yel∣low. In the gardens of the cities near the sea∣coast, they have orange-trees in bloom or fruit all the year. Olives also, and almond trees, thrive very well; and there is great plenty of the most noble and generous wines, especially the Musca∣del. The grapes are vastly large, and the trunks of the vines, in some places, as thick as a man's body.</P>
<P>This country abounds in mines of gold, silver, copper, tin, quicksilver, iron, and lead. In the countries of Coquambo and Guasco, mines of all kinds of metals are so very common, that the whole earth seems to be wholly composed of mine∣rals; and it is here those of copper are worked, of which the great guns for Peru and the neighbour∣ing kingdoms are made, with the bells of churches,
<PB N="431" REF="4320"/>
and family utensils. Neither the silver, quicksil∣ver, or leadmines in Chili are much worked, because there is plenty of silver in Peru, and little occasion for lead; and as to silver, besides the rich mines of that metal in Peru, the working of the gold mines here is more profitable and less chargeable, not to mention what is got from the natives, and washed down from the mountains by brooks and torrents. All the gold thus collected in Chili, most of which is from twenty-one to twenty-three carrats fine, is brought to Lima to be coined; and by the ac∣counts constantly taken, amounts, one year with another, to six hundred thousand dollars; but that clandestinely sent, by way of the Cordilleras, is said to be near four hundred thousand; consequently, the whole must be at least a million.</P>
<P>The other products and commodities of Chili are, cattle of all kinds, especially mules; tallow, hides, dried fish, flax, cordage, cocoa-nuts, sole leather tanned, Cordovan leather, grassa, char∣qui, and neats tongues. Of most of these articles great quantities are exported, especially to Lima and Panama; whence they receive, in return, the merchandize of the East-Indies and Europe.</P>
<P>Besides all the advantages mentioned above, Chi∣li is said to be free from venomous creatures; such as vipers, snakes, scorpions, and toads; nor are there any panthers, tygers, or other mischievous animals, except some lions of a small kind, which sometimes attack and kill sheep and goats, but fly from men. That species of hogs which have their navels on their backs, and are called pecarees, is found here. These, we are told, go in great herds, with each a leader; and that, till he is killed, it is dangerous to attack them, but that when he falls, they immediately disperse. The hair of the wild∣goats, and the wool of the sheep called guanacos, which are shaped like camels, but of a less size, are
<PB N="432" REF="4330"/>
said to be as soft and fine as silk, and used for much the same purposes.</P>
<P>We have already related, under Peru, how the Spa∣niards established themselves in this country: as the martial genius of the natives greatly retarded their conquests, so it has always been the cause why the Spanish settlements here are so disproportionate to the extent, fertility, and riches of the country. The free Indians are much more numerous than the Spaniards, who are computed at no more than twenty thousand. All the inhabitants of Chili, including Europeans, Mestizoes, mulat∣toes, and negroes, are reckoned at one hundred and fifty thousand only. Even the free Indians, it seems, now acknowledge the dominion of the king of Spain, and pay tribute to his governor; but the subjected Indians belong entirely to the Spa∣niards, living among them, and serving them in the same manner as the natives of Peru and Mexi∣co. The greater part of Chili is still possessed by the free Indians, who are rather allies than subjects of Spain, having, it is said, in the last treaty, con∣sented to acknowledge the king of Spain for their lawful sovereign, only upon condition that they were suffered to continue under the protection of their own laws and government; an engagement which it will be hazardous for the Spaniards to break, however it may counteract their great design of gaining entire possession of these countries, and thereby repairing the constant decline of wealth, and decay of the precious metals, in their other settlements. The free Indians are governed by their own chiefs, whom the Spaniards call ca∣ciques, who claim no authority, besides that of administering justice, and commanding their tribes in time of war; having neither palaces, guards, nor revenue, or any other badges of sovereign au∣thority. The Chilisians are of a middle stature,
<PB N="433" REF="4340"/>
strong built, of a tawny complexion, and have long black hair on their heads, but pluck off that on their chins or other parts of their bodies. They are tall, robust, active, and courageous, enduring fatigue, heat and cold, to admiration. Their arms are pikes, bows, arrows, and swords; and their disci∣pline much more regular than that of the other In∣dians. Their manners are very simple. They have no gold or silver, though these metals are so common in their country. All their bedding is some skins, laid on the ground; and they eat on the ground, or else on a little bench, and wipe their hands on a broom, instead of a napkin. Their food is of maiz, fruits, herbs, and what they catch by hunting and fishing. Their drink also is made of maiz toasted, steeped and boiled, or of fruits. Their furniture consists of four or five dishes, and some wooden spoons, or shells, a ca∣labash or gourd to drink out of, and a leaf of a tree or maiz, for a salt-seller. When they make bread, they set great earthen platters, full of sand upon the fire, and when hot enough, take them off, put the grains of maiz into the hot sand, stir them about, till they be toasted enough for the purpose, and then grind them between two stones. They let blood with a sharp flint, fixed in a little piece of wood, and just long enough to open a vein. Though they can neither read nor write, yet they have a peculiar way of registering events, and keeping accounts of things committed to their charge, by strings of different sizes, in which they make knots of several colours, called qui∣pos. Frezier tells us, that the knowledge of these knots is a secret science, which fathers do not re∣veal to their children, till they find their death draw near.</P>
<P>There never was a temple or idol found in this country, nor does it appear that they ever worship∣ped
<PB N="434" REF="4350"/>
any; yet they have some confused notions of a future state, for they put meat, drink, and cloaths into the coffins of the deceased, to serve them in the other world.</P>
<P>The subjected Indians are divided into little lord∣ships, consisting of a certain number of families, more or less, called commanderies, which the king of Spain gives to whom he pleases. If the Indians serve their lord, he must not only maintain them, but give each of them thirty pieces of eight a∣year. On the other hand, if the Indians are not in∣clined to live with their lord, they are excused, on condition of paying him an annual tribute of ten pieces of eight.</P>
<P>The free Indians, at present, admit Spanish mis∣sionaries among them, and shew an inclination to embrace the gospel-doctrine, to which their great∣est objection is, lest it should bring them to slavery. They enter easily into the Spanish measures, which gives great pleasure to the colonists, in hopes they may thereby bring them to submit voluntarily to the yoke, which they could not impose upon them by force.</P>
<P>The audience of Chili is divided into three pro∣vinces, viz. the provinces or bishoprics of St. Ja∣go and Conception, and the province of Chicuito, which lies beyond the mountains.</P>
<P>The principal places in the bishopric of St. Ja∣go, or Chili Proper, are St. Jago, and Valperaiso.</P>
<P>St. Jago, the capital of Chili, founded in the year 1541 by Valdivia, stands in 33°. 40′. south la∣titude, at the west foot of the Cordillera mountains, on the little river Mapocho, which gives name to a valley of great extent, and supplies the city with water, for cooling and cleansing the streets, watering their gardens, and other purposes. In the centre of the city stands the grand piazza, which, like that at Lima, is square, with a very
<PB N="435" REF="4360"/>
beautiful fountain in the middle. Here are the apartments of the governor or president, the palace of the royal audience, the town-house, the public prison, the cathedral, and many other handsome public and private buildings. The Spaniards in St. Jago, and the large suburb of Chimba on the other side of the river, are reckoned to amount to eight thousand, and the other inhabitants to about thirty thousand. Those who have acquired for∣tunes at Baldivia, Valparaiso, and Conception, re∣pair hither, to spend their days in ease and enjoy∣ment. In the neighbourhood are the gold mines of Tiltil, and the Lavaderoes, by their concerns in which many of the citizens amass vast fortunes. The royal audience residing in St. Jago, since its removal from Conception, is composed of a presi∣dent, four auditors, and a fiscal; together with an officer, who bears the title of protector of the In∣dians. Though subordinate, in some respects, to the viceroy of Peru, the determinations of the court are without appeal, except to the council of the In∣dies. The president is also governor and captain∣general of the whole kingdom of Chili, in which quality he resides one half of the year in the capital, and the other at Conception. There is a tribunal of the inquisition in this city, and the see of a bi∣shop, subordinate to the archbishop of Lima. Earthquakes have often done a great deal of da∣mage here: that of 1647 was so violent, that it al∣most overturned the whole town, and left such un∣wholesome vapours in the air, that all the inhabi∣tants died, except about three or four hundred. Another dreadful shock in 1730, laid the city in ruins.</P>
<P>Valparaiso, a small town, is situated in 32°. 15′. south latitude. The bay or harbour, tho' greatly exposed in winter to the north winds, which then blow with great violence, is much frequented by
<PB N="436" REF="4370"/>
ships from Callao and Panama. Though there is a fort here, called Castello Blanco, and other works, they are generally in a bad condition, which is the case of most of the Spanish fortifications in Ame∣rica.</P>
<P>The other places in this province worth men∣tioning are, Quintero, La Serena or Coquimbo, Guasco, and Copiapo.</P>
<P>Quintero is a small place, five leagues to the northward of Valparaiso, having a port much fre∣quented by shipping, but entirely without defence.</P>
<P>La Serena, or Coquimbo, is a small place, situ∣ated a quarter of a league from the sea, on the ri∣ver Coquimbo, in 30°. of south latitude, accord∣ing to Dampier. It had the name of Serena from the deliciousness of the climate; for here the sky is continually serene and pleasant, the winters warm, and the summer heats tempered with refreshing breezes. The soil too is said to be as fertile as the climate is delightful. Coquimbo gives name to a large bay, the mouth of which is two leagues and a half wide, and the bottom every where good. In the neighbouring country are mines of gold, silver, and copper, and also, if we can trust to some ac∣counts, of quicksilver and iron.</P>
<P>Guasco is a sea-port, but little frequented, situ∣ated on a small river of the same name, thirty miles to the north of La Serena, according to Dampier, but, according to the maps, ninety-five. The neigh∣bouring country is said to be well peopled with Spaniards.</P>
<P>Copiapo is an open town, one hundred and seven∣ty-five miles to the north of La Serena, taking its name from a river. There are gold mines directly above the town, and others at two or three leagues distance, whence they bring the ore on mules to the mills within the town. The ounce of gold
<PB N="437" REF="4380"/>
here is sold for twelve or thirteen pieces of eight, cast. Besides the gold mines, there are about Co∣piapo many of iron, copper, tin, and lead, with sal gem, saltpetre, sulphur, loadstone, and lapis lazuli</P>
<P>The province or bishopric of Conception lies to the south of that of St Jago. The most considera∣ble places in it are, the towns of Conception and Baldivia.</P>
<P>Conception, situated in 36°. 43′. 15″. south lati∣tude, at the bottom of a bay of the same name, is the oldest European Spanish establishment in Chi∣li, and the second city in point of dignity. The same earthquake that destroyed St. Jago, in 1730, laid this city also in ruins. The harbour is good, and pretty much frequented; but the fortifications of very little importance, though there is, or ought to be, a garrison of three thousand five hundred men. That the fortifications in Chili and Peru are in a ruinous condition, and the garrisons scarce half their complement, is owing to the negligence and security, but chiefly to the avarice, of the go∣vernors, who think of nothing but enriching them∣selves. The beauties of the country adjacent to this city are enchanting; and the returns of nature, for the husbandman's toil, exuberant. Some far∣mers apply themselves wholly to raising corn, others to breeding and fattening of sheep and cat∣tle; some to the breeding of horses, and others to the culture of vines and fruit trees: hence, the vallies are filled with cattle, and the fleecy kind; and so numerous is the breed of horses, that one which would cost thirty or forty pounds in the cheapest country in Europe, may be here pur∣chased for a twentieth part of the sum.</P>
<P>The peasants in the neighbourhood of Concep∣tion are remarkable for their address in the use of the noose and lance. According to Ullea with
<PB N="438" REF="4390"/>
these weapons they will combat the fiercest bull, throwing the noose so artfully, as to lay certain hold of some part of the body. When a bull is haltered, they draw the k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, at the same time giving spurs to their horses, and hamstringing him with their lances, so that the animal is taken and disabled at the same instant This dexterity in throwing the noose, and hamstringing the animal in an instant, while they ride at full speed, cannot fail of surprizing Europeans. In private quarrels also, they fight with the noose and lance; all attacks from which they are taught to parry with such dexterity, that, after a combat of an hour, it is no uncommon case to see the parties separate untouched, notwithstanding both have exerted the greatest alertness.</P>
<P>Conception is the see of a bishop, which was transferred hither at the time that the city Imperial was destroyed by the Indians. The inhabitants are numerous; the fertility of the soil, and the excel∣lency of the climate, having induced a great num∣ber of Spaniards and Mestizoes to settle here.</P>
<P>Baldivia, or, as the Spaniards spell it, Valdivia, stands about one hundred and ninety five miles south of Conception, at the bottom of a fine bay, in 39°. 36″ south latitude, on a river to which it gives name, as it takes its own from the first conqueror of this country. It is defended by four strong castles, mounting above a hundred pieces of fine brass cannon; but there is never a sufficient number of gunners and carriages, nor store of ammunition: besides, what dependence can be placed upon a gar∣rison composed of transported criminals, who are sent hither instead of being lashed to the oar on board the gallies. The inhabitants are said to amount to about two thousand. Ten large ships are employed in the trade between this port and Lima, which consists chiefly in gold, corn, hides,
<PB N="439" REF="4400"/>
and salt provisions; exchanged for slaves, sugar, chocolate, and European commodities and manu∣factures. It is said, the king of Spain allows no less than three hundred thousand pieces of eight for maintaining the garrison of the town, and keeping the fortifications in repair.</P>
<P>There are several other small places in this pro∣vince; but none of them of any consideration, ex∣cept Aranca, where they maintain a garrison of five or six hundred men.</P>
<P>The province of Chicuito, which lies on the op∣posite side of the Andes, and by some is reckoned a part of La Plata, is said to contain several towns, of which Mendoza, San Juan de la Frontera, Uto, and St. Lewis, are mentioned as the chief; but no particular description is given of them.</P>
<P>Off the coast of Chili are a great many islands, the chief of which are Chiloe, St. Mary's, Quiriquina, de la Moca or Mocha, Juan Fernandes, Tierra, and Fuera.</P>
<P>The four first lie near the coast: Chiloe, at the southern extremity of the province of Conception; St. Mary's and Quinquina, near the Bay of Con∣ception; and de la Mocha, at the mouth of the ri∣ver Imperial.</P>
<P>Chiloe is a large and beautiful island, containing a town called Castro, and surrounded with a great number of smaller islands, to which it gives name; but the other three are inconsiderable.</P>
<P>The island of Juan Fernandes, of which there is a minute description in Anson's Voyage, lies up∣wards of one hundred leagues from the continent, in 33°. 40′. of south latitude. It is about twelve leagues round, full of hills, interspersed with small pleasant vallies and savannahs, which, if cultivated, would produce any thing proper for the climate. The woods afford cabbage trees, and a variety of others; but none fit for masts. There are only
<PB N="440" REF="4410"/>
two bays in the whole island where ships may an∣chor, and these are both at the west end. When commodore Anson touched here, he found no in∣habitants, nor any other animals on it, except goats, dogs, and sea lions; but by later accounts we learn, that there is now a Spanish settlement, with a fort or forts, to command the bays or anchoring places.</P>
<P>We know nothing further of the islands Tierra and Fuera, than that they lie to the east of Juan Fernandes.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>TERRA-MAGELLANICA, or PATAGONIA.</HEAD>
<P>Terra-Magellanica, or Patagonia, comprehends all that country extending from Chili and Para∣guay to the utmost extremity of South America, that is, from 35 almost to 54°. of latitude; being surrounded by the countries just mentioned, the South and North Seas, and the Straits of Magellan, which separate it from the island called Terra del Fuego, and extend about one hundred and sixteen leagues in length, from sea to sea, but only from half a league to three or four in breadth.</P>
<P>This country had the name of Terra-Magellani∣ca from Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese officer in the service of the catholic king, who is reported to have sailed through the straits, that also bear his name, from the North to the South Sea, in the year 1510.</P>
<P>The lofty mountains of the Andes, which are co∣vered with snow a great part of the year, traversing the country from north to south, the air is said to be much colder than in the north, under the same parallels of latitude. Towards the north, it is said to be covered with wood, and stored with an inex∣haustible fund of large timber; whereas, to the southward, not so much as a single tree, fit for any mechanical purpose, is to be seen; yet there is good
<PB N="441" REF="4420"/>
pasture, and incredible numbers of wild horned cat∣tle and horses, which were first brought hither by the Spaniards, and have increased amazingly. Fresh water, we are told by some writers, is very scarce; but if that was really the case, we cannot see how the present inhabitants, and such multitudes of cat∣tle, could subsist. The east coast is mostly low land, with few or no good harbours: one of the best is Port St. Julian.</P>
<P>Patagonia is inhabited by a variety of Indian tribes, as the Patagons, from which the country takes its name, the Pampas, the Cossares, &amp;c. of whom we know very little; only it appears, from the accounts of former voyages, lately confirmed by commodore Byron and his crew, that some of them are of a gigantic stature, and cloathed with skins; but it would seem, that there are others, who go al∣most quite naked, notwithstanding the inclemency of the climate. Some of them also, that live about the Straits, if we may credit the navigators who have passed that way into the South Sea, are perfect savages; but those with whom commo∣dore Byron and his people conversed, are repre∣sented as of a more gentle humane disposition, on∣ly, like other savages, they live on fish and game, and what the earth produces spontaneously.</P>
<P>The Spaniards once built a fort upon the Straits, and left a garrison in it, to prevent any other Eu∣ropean nation passing that way into the South Sea; but most of the men perished by famine, whence the place obtained the name of Port Famine; and no people have attempted to plant colonies here ever since.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Strait is a promontory, called Cape Froisard, which is the most southerly on the continent of South-America.</P>
<P>On the coasts of Patagonia lie a great number of islands, or clusters of islands. On the west coast
<PB N="442" REF="4430"/>
are the islands Madre de Dios, Santa Trinidad, Santa Cruz, the Isles of the Chunians and Huil∣lans, the Sarmientos, and many others, to the number of eighty in all, as some say. Of those on the south coast the most considerable are, Terra del Fuego, and Staten Land. The first had its name, which signifies the Land of Fire, from the first dis∣coverers, upon their observing some great fires, supposed to be volcanos, upon it, as they passed in the night through the straits that lie between it and the continent. It is not certain whether it is a single island or a cluster of islands; or whe∣ther it is inhabited or not. The land appears to be rough and mountainous, intersected with deep narrow vallies, and watered by a great many brooks and rivers. Some tell us, that it is in∣habited, and that the inhabitants are naturally as fair as the Europeans; that they go naked, and paint thair bodies; and that those on the south side are rude, treacherous, and barbarous; while those on the opposite side are simple, affable, and perfectly harmless. The southern extremity of this island, or cluster of islands, is called Cape Horn. Staten Land is represented as an island much resembling Terra del Fuego. Betwixt these lie the straits which take their name from Le Maire, one of the circumnavigators of the globe. To the north of Staten Land, in the Atlantic Ocean, lie Falkland Islands, on which the English and French were said to have lately made settlements.</P>
<P>The Isle of Penquins, which lies near the east coast of Patagonia, is remarkable only for taking its name from a white-headed bird, as large as a goose, with which it abounds.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BRASIL.</HEAD>
<P>All that tract of country stretching along the sea-coast from the mouth of the river La Plata,
<PB N="443" REF="4440"/>
in the 35°. of south latitude, to the great river of Amazons, under the equator, that is, upwards of two thousand miles, is denominated Brazil, and subject to the crown of Portugal. It is reported to extend from east to west, or from the Atlantic to Paraguay, about nine hundred miles, though the Portuguese have no settlements in the interior country.</P>
<P>The first aspect of this country from the sea is rather unfavourable, as it appears high, rough, and unequal; but, on a nearer view, nothing can be more delightful, the eminences being covered with woods, the trees of which are most∣ly evergreens, and the vallies and savannahs with the most refreshing verdure Far within land, indeed, are high mountains, which separate it from the Spanish province of Paraguay or La Plata, and in these are innumerable springs and lakes, from whence issue abundance of rivers, that fall into the great rivers Amazon and Para∣guay, or run across the country from west to east, and fall into the Atlantic Ocean.</P>
<P>In so vast a tract, it cannot be supposed that the climate is alike, and the seasons uniform. The northern provinces, which lie towards the equator, like other countries in the like situation, are subject to great rains and variable winds, particularly in the months of March and September, when they have such deluges of rain, with storms and torna∣does, that the country is almost quite overflowed, and the air rendered unhealthful. As to the more southern provinces, there is no country between the tropics where the heats are more tolerable, or the air more healthful than this; being constantly re∣freshed with breezes from the sea, and abounding with lakes and rivers, which annually overflow their banks; and in the inland parts the winds that blow from the mountains are still cooler than those that blow from the ocean.</P>
<P><PB N="444" REF="4450"/>
This country breeds a great variety of serpents and venomous creatures; among which are, the In∣dian salamander, a kind of four legged insect, whose sting is mortal; the ibibaboka, a kind of serpent, about seven yards long, and half a yard in circumference, whose poison is instantaneously fatal to the human kind; the rattle-snake, which grows here to an enormous size; the liboya, or roebuck∣snake, which is said to be able to swallow a roe∣buck whole, with its horns, being between twenty and thirty feet in length, and two or three yards in circumference; scorpions, one sort of which are between four and five feet long; lizards, of three or four feet long; mellipides, both venomous and dangerous; and many others. The pismires here are very large, numerous, and destructive, devouring all that comes in their way.</P>
<P>Among the wild beasts of Brasil are, ant-bears; tygers or madilloes; porcupines; janonveras, a very fierce ravenous animal, somewhat like a greyhound; armadilloes; various sorts of monkeys, some of which are very large; that called by Europeans the sloth, or lazy beast; and the topirasson, a crea∣ture between a bull and an ass, but without horns, and harmless, &amp;c. The flesh of the toperasson is good, and tastes like beef. They have great plen∣ty of deer, hares, and other game, and a variety of other animals, wild and tame.</P>
<P>No country on earth affords a greater number of birds; some remarkable for their beauty, and others for their taste. Of the first sort is the humming∣bird, so called from the noise he makes with his wings, when he sucks the juices of flowers. Co∣real, who calls it colubri, says, it is not much big∣ger than a fly, and has a most melodious voice, like that of a nightingale, and near as loud. Their feathers, which way soever you turn them, appear of a different colour and hue, like those of
<PB N="445" REF="4460"/>
the sun-beams through a prism, on which account, it is not unfitly called by the natives the sun-beam. The anhima hath a horn two or three inches long growing out of its forehead, and, on that account, is called by Europeans the unicorn-bird. The toucan is of the bigness of a wood-pigeon, and of a perfect jet-black all over, except under the breast and belly, which is of a fine yellow, and a small cir∣cle of red about the neck; but what is most ex∣traordinary in this bird is, that its bill is bigger than the rest of its body, yellow without and red within, and about a span long. The guira, called by Europeans the sea-curlew, and the same with the numonius indicus, and arenata concinea, of the Latin authors, is remarkable for its often changing its native colour, being at first black, then ash-co∣loured, next white, afterwards scarlet, and last of all crimson, which last grows richer and deeper the longer the bird liveth. The cocoi, a very beautiful bird, parroquets, parrots, cuckatooś, macaws, and variety of others, are very common here. Their eat∣able fowls are turkies, very large and delicious; a sort of white hens, and other poultry; ducks, and other such water-fowl. Their bats are of a pro∣digous size. It is said, they will go into houses in the night, and if they find any persons asleep, and uncovered, they will fasten on them, and suck their blood.</P>
<P>The sea-coasts, lakes, and rivers, are stored with great plenty and variety of fish, among which is the globe-fish, called by the Latins orbis minor, from its orbicular form, which is so beset all round with sharp spikes, like those of a hedgehog, that it bids defiance to all fishes of prey. But of all the living creatures in this sea, the most remarkable is the sea-bladder, so called because it greatly resembles one, and swims on the surface of the waves. The inside is only filled with air, except about a spoon∣ful
<PB N="446" REF="4470"/>
of water, that serves to poise it. The skin is very thin and transparent, and, like a bubble raised in the water, reflects all the colours of the sky.</P>
<P>Of woods, roots, and plants, here is a vast variety. Brazil or red wood is very common here, espe∣cially in rocky and barren ground, where it often grows to a great height and considerable thick∣ness. The flowers are of a bright red, and have a strong aromatic and refreshing smell. The wood is of a red colour, hard and dry, and is used in dying red; but the red which it produces is far from being of the best kind. It is also in some cases used as a medicine, both as a stomachic and astringent. They have five different kinds of palm trees here, with some fine woods of ebony, citron, cotton-trees, mastick, besides many others, some of which distil excellent balsams, and diffuse a most exquisite fragrancy, and others yield the most delicious fruits.</P>
<P>Of the other commodities and products of Bra∣sil, the chief are ambergrease, rosin, balsams, in∣digo, sweet meats, sugar, tobacco, gold, diamonds, beautiful pebbles, chrystal, emeralds, jasper, and other precious stones, in all which the Portuguese carry on a vast trade. The mines of gold and dia∣monds were first opened in the year 1681, and have since yielded above five million sterling annually, of which sum a fifth belongs to the crown. The diamond mines are farmed at about thirty thousand pounds yearly, which is thought to be scarce a fifth of what they actually produce. The Brasil clayed sugar is much finer and whiter than that we bring home from our plantations; and their to∣bacco is also remarkably good. Of the last arti∣cle, they export great quantities to the coast of Africa; where they not only dispose of it to the natives, but even supply the vessels of other na∣tions, who are obliged to purchase it, for the con∣venience
<PB N="447" REF="4480"/>
of carrying on the gold-dust and slave trade with any tolerable advantage. The north and south parts of Brasil abound with horned cat∣tle, which are hunted for their hides, of which no less than twenty thousand are annually exported to Europe.</P>
<P>The Portuguese trade hither is so increased, that instead of twelve ships, formerly employed in the Brasil commerce, there are never fewer than one hundred sail of large vessels constantly going and returning from those colonies. The slave trade, from the multitude of slaves annually transported from Africa to Brasil must employ a great number of shipping. All the ships employed in the Brasil trade, being under the direction of the govern∣ment, have their appointed seasons for going and returning, under convoy of a certain number of men of war; nor can a single ship clear out, or set sail, except with the fleet, but by a special licence from the king, which is seldom granted. The fleets sail in the following order, and at the following stated periods: that to Rio Janeiro sets sail in Ja∣nuary; that to Bahia, or the Bay of All Saints, in February; and the third fleet to Fernambuco, in the month of March. The cargoes of these fleets, like those of the Spanish to their American colonies, consist of a variety of articles, furnished by several European nations.</P>
<P>The crown revenue arising from this colony is said to amount to two hundred thousand pounds sterling in gold, if we may credit some late writers, besides the duties and customs on merchandize im∣ported from that quarter.</P>
<P>For the better regulation of government, Brasil is divided into fifteen provinces, called capitaneas, or captainries, the whole being a principality, which gives title to the presumptive heir of the crown of Portugal. Of these captainries, eight only are an∣nexed
<PB N="448" REF="4490"/>
to the crown, the rest being fiefs, made over to some of the nobility, in reward of their extraor∣dinary services, who do little more than acknow∣ledge the sovereignty of the crown of Portugal.</P>
<P>The principal places in Brasil are, St. Salvadore, Rio de Janeiro, and Fernambuco.</P>
<P>St. Salvador, called also Cividad de Bahia, the most magnificent, populous, and opulent city of Brasil, stands in the province, and on the Bay of All Saints, (Bahia de todos los Santos) in 12°. 11′. south latitude. It is not only strong by nature, but well fortified, and always defended by a good gar∣rison. A prodigious trade is carried on in this ci∣ty, which is also the see of an archbishop, and the residence of the viceroy, who acts both in a civil and military capacity, and maintains the state and court of a sovereign prince. The air and climate are inferior to those of some of the other provinces. The streets here are crouded with negroes, men and women, quite naked, except a small clout round their middle. There are also shops, and other open places, filled with these miserable naked crea∣tures, exposed to public sale, like cattle.</P>
<P>Rio de Janeiro, a rich and populous city, stands about two leagues from the main ocean, on a bay formed by the river of the same name. It is also called St. Sebastian, having an admirable port, which is now more resorted to by the Portuguese than any other in Brasil, on account of the gold and diamonds which are found in the mountains of this and the neighbouring province of St. Vin∣cent. The Rio de Janeiro is said to have been so named by John de Solis, who first discovered it, in the month of January. The town and bay are guarded by several forts.</P>
<P>Fernambuco, Fernambucco, or Pernambuco, the chief town of the province to which it gives name, and one of the most considerable in Brasil.
<PB N="449" REF="4500"/>
It is also called Rerief, or Arrarife, from a neigh∣bouring harbour of that name, which is now the strongest in all Brasil, a number of forts being erected all round, and the access naturally so intri∣cate and dangerous, by reason of the concealed rocks, sands, and little islands about it, that the as∣sistance of a skilful pilot is absolutely necessary to avoid them. Hence the name Fernambuco would seem to be only a contraction of Inserno Boco, or the Mouth of Hell.</P>
<P>There are many more towns in Brasil, and some of them considerable; as Olinda, in the province of Fernambuco; Paraiba, St. Vincent, Tamora, or Tamarica, and Sierra, in the provinces so named; Belem, or Para, in the province of Paria; and Maragnano, in an island and captainry of that name, towards the northern extremity of Brasil.</P>
<P>About thirty miles north of the province of St. Vincent, which is the most southerly of Brasil, lies the little republic of St. Paul, surrounded by lofty mountains and thick forests. This state was ori∣ginally composed of outlaws from all the neigh∣bouring colonies, Spaniards, Portuguese, Creoles, Mestizoes, mulattoes, and negroes, who took re∣fuge on this spot, and lived at first without order, society, faith, honour, or religion; preying upon each other, and subsisting by mutual rapine, and the plunder of their neighbours; but the inconve∣niences attending this way of life, and the danger to which it exposed them, soon drove them into confederacies, and these, at last, produced a regular democracy. If they were more numerous, they would be formidable to the Portuguese colonies; but as they are not reputed above four or five thousand, and want fire-arms, they give no appre∣hensions, and consequently no attempts are made to reduce them. At present, this little community elaims entire independence; though they pay an
<PB N="450" REF="4510"/>
annual tribute to the king out of their gold mines, rather to preserve commercial benefits than to ac∣knowledge his sovereignty, being far short of the fifth of the produce of their mines. This the Brasilian government are not ignorant of; but know not how to force a people that inhabit such inaccessible mountains, and are ever fortifying those passes, which they think not to be strong enough by nature. It was the tyranny of the Brasilian go∣vernors that gave birth to this little state, which is grown now so jealous of its liberty, that no stranger is suffered to set foot within its dominions, except run-away slaves; and if these, after a full examination, are not able to clear themselves of all sinister designs, they are instantly put to death.</P>
<P>The territory of the republic is said to produce good wheat, and to be very proper for feeding cattle; and the gold mines in it are reported to be exceeding rich. Their capital, called St. Paul, we are told also, is a neat, well built, and opulent town; but all that is known of them is from the reports of negro-slaves, who have found means to make their escape from them.</P>
<P>Besides their settlements on the continent of Bra∣sil, the Portuguese have now a flourishing colony on the island of St. Catherine, though it was ori∣ginally peopled by the convicts and outlaws trans∣ported from Brasil and Portugal. This island, situated in 27°. 35′. of south latitude, is one of the most beautiful, temperate, and fertile spots in the world, extending about twenty-seven miles in length, and six in breadth. A great part of the island is over-run with thick woods, which appear perpetually green, and abound with orange, lemon, citron, guava, cabbage, and cotton trees, and game. This island yields also Indian wheat, sugar∣canes, melons, sassafras, guiacum, the best potatoes
<PB N="451" REF="4520"/>
in the world, and many other drugs, roots, and plants.</P>
<P>Of the natives in Brasil, the most considerable tribes are, the Tapuyers, and Topinamboys; of whom the former inhabit the northern, and the other the southern parts. The former are men of a good stature, of a dark copper colour, their hair black, and hanging over their shoulders; but they suffer no hair on their bodies or faces, and go almost naked, the women only concealing their pudenda with leaves, like their mother Eve. Their ornaments are, glittering stones, hung upon their lips or nos∣trils, and bracelets of feathers upon their arms: the men have also a cap or coronet of feathers.</P>
<P>The complexions of the Topinamboys are not so dark as their northern neighbours, who live nearer the line; and neither the one nor the other as those of the Africans, who lie under the same parallels. The native Brasilians are partly freemen, and partly slaves; but the negro-slaves are much more va∣lued, being of a more robust constitution, and fitter for labour.</P>
<P>The Brasilians have been represented as a savage people, devoid of all principles of religion, cruel in war, and cannibals, or devourers of human flesh; but these stories are generally looked upon as fic∣tions of the Portuguese, to justify their cruel and inhuman treatment of them.</P>
<P>It is said, they believe in certain invisible beings, the dispensers of good and evil, the rewarders and punishers of virtue and vice; and their notion with respect to a future state is, that after death they shall visit their ancestors, dwelling beyond the An∣des; but they have no temples. Their priests practise the same craft as those in more civilized nations: they make them believe, that if they bring them offerings, those invisible beings, who give them food and all the good things they enjoy, will
<PB N="452" REF="4530"/>
prosper their affairs; but if they neglect this, some dreadful calamity will overtake them.</P>
<P>As to government, they are said to have their ca∣ciques or chiefs, who administer justice to the peo∣ple in time of peace, and command them in their expeditions against their enemies; their arms be∣ing bows, arrows, wooden clubs or swords, and shields. Their towns have no walls or fortifica∣tions; and their method of carrying on war is chiefly by ambuscades, sudden unexpected attacks, and incursions.</P>
<P>The Portuguese discovered this country in the year 1500; but did not plant it till the year 1549, when they fixed themselves at the Bay of All Saints, and built the city of St. Salvador. The French also made some attempts to plant colonies upon this coast; but were driven from thence by the Portuguese, who remained in Brasil almost without a rival, till the year 1623: at that time, being under the dominion of the king of Spain, with whom the United Provinces were at war, the Dutch West-India company invaded Brasil, and subdued the northern provinces. But the Dutch were entirely driven out of Brasil in 1654: however, the West-In∣dia company still continuing their pretensions to Brasil, and committing depredations on the Portu∣guese at sea, the latter agreed, in 1661, to pay the Dutch eight tons of gold, to relinquish their claim to that country, which was accepted; and the Por∣tuguese have remained in peaceable possession of it ever since.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>AMAZONIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country obtained the name of Amazonia, or the Country of the Amazons, from the Spaniards seeing, when they first entered the river, great num∣bers of women on the banks of it with arms in their
<PB N="453" REF="4540"/>
hands; but these, it afterwards appeared, they carried only to ease their husbands, as they do the baggage in all their expeditions. The river of the Amazons is one of the largest in the world, and is said to rise in the Cordilleras, eight or ten leagues east of Quito; but, as others will have it, from the Lake Laurio∣cha, near Guanaco in Peru, increasing so, as it ad∣vances towards the Atlantic, into which it dis∣charges itself by eighty-four channels, that it is se∣veral leagues broad, and from thirty to forty fa∣thom deep, five hundred leagues from its mouths, which take in a space of fifty or sixty leagues, between Cape North, on the coast of Guiana, and Cape Laparate, on the coast of Brasil. A great many rivers fall into it on both sides, of which the Rio Negro, Xanxa, and Maranhon, are the chief, or among the chief. Taking in all the windings and turnings, it is computed to run five thousand miles, from its spring-head to its mouth; and, like all other rivers between the tropics, over∣flows the country in the rainy season.</P>
<P>Amazonia is bounded by Terra-Firma on the north; by Brasil, and the Atlantic Ocean, on the east; by another part of Brasil, and La Plata, on the south; and by Peru and Quito on the west; but little is known of it, except along the banks of the river, and the west frontiers of the Portu∣guese colonies in Brasil.</P>
<P>The celebrated M. Condamine made a voyage down the River of Amazons not a great many years ago, and has published a very entertaining journal of that adventure; to which we must refer the reader, not having room here to epitomize it.</P>
<P>Neither Spaniards, Portuguese, nor any other European nation have yet made any settlements in this country; so that the Indians remain a free people, not subject to any foreign dominion. The air is cooler here than could be well expected so
<PB N="454" REF="4550"/>
near the equator, which proceeds from the heavy rains, that occasion the rivers to overflow their banks one half of the year; and from the cloudy weather, and shortness of the days, which never exceed twelve hours. A brisk easterly wind also cools the air, which blows from the Atlantic O∣cean quite through the country, so strong, that ves∣sels are thereby enabled to sail against the stream, and perform a voyage up the River of Amazons al∣most as soon as down it, which requires eight or ten months. Here are terrible storms of thunder and lightning, during the time of the rains.</P>
<P>The face of the country is said to be very beau∣tiful, and the soil fertile, producing cocoa-nuts, ananas or pine apples, guavas, bananas, and other tropical fruits; cedar, iron-wood, so called from its weight and density, red wood, oak, ebony, logwood, and many other sorts of dying woods and drugs; together with tobacco, cotton, sugar, maiz, cassavi root, yams, potatoes, sarsaparilla, and canela, or spurious cinnamon.</P>
<P>They have store of excellent honey, balm, wild fowl, and venison, in their woods, which also abound with tigers, wild boars, buffaloes, &amp;c. The honey is exquisite, and the balm good against all wounds. Parrots are as numerous here as pigeons in Eng∣land, and as good meat. They have vast numbers of fish of all sorts in the rivers and lakes; and, among others, manatees or sea-cows, that are am∣phibious, and feed on the banks; and tortoises, of a large size and delicate taste; but the fishers must be upon their guard against crocodiles, alligators, and water-serpents.</P>
<P>The natives, like almost all the Americans, are of a good stature, have handsome features, long black hair, and copper complexions. They are reported to have a taste for the imitative arts, espe∣cially sculpture and painting, and make good me∣chanics.
<PB N="455" REF="4560"/>
Their cordage is made of the barks of trees, their sails of cotton, their hatchets of tor∣toise-shells or hard stones, their chissels, planes, and wimbles, of the teeth and horns of wild beasts, and their canoes are hollowed trees. They spin and weave themselves cotton garments; and their houses or huts are of wood, thatch, and clay. Their arms, in general, are darts and javelins, bows, and arrows, with targets of cane or fish-skins. They are such good archers, that they kill fish in the wa∣ter with their arrows, which they eat without bread or salt. The several nations are governed by their chiefs or caciques; for it is observable, that the monarchical form of government hath prevail∣ed almost universally, both among the antient and modern barbarians, as requiring a less refined policy than the republican system. The regalia by which the chiefs are distinguished are, a crown of parrots feathers, a chain of lions teeth or claws about their middle, and a wooden sword in their hand. Both sexes sometimes wear mantles of the skins of beasts, or cotton, but generally go naked. In some nations the men thrust pieces of cane through the foreskin of their pudenda, their ears, and under lips, and hang glass beads at the gristle of their noses, which bob to and fro when they speak; but in others, they wear plates of gold at their ears and nostrils. All these nations allow of polygamy, or a plurality of wives and concubines; and the women here, as in the other American nations, do the most labo∣rious work. They worship the images of their an∣tient heroes, or subordinate deities; but we hear of no temples, or orders of priests among them.</P>
<P>The Jesuits, before their expulsion from the Spanish and Portuguese dominions, are said to have made a considerable progress in convert∣ing the natives; but whether any of them still continue here, or have quitted the country,
<PB N="456" REF="4570"/>
and given place to other orders, we cannot pretend to say.</P>
<P>Several voyages have been made up and down the River of Amazon, both by Spaniards and Portuguese, who were sent to make discoveries; from whom, and the Jesuits, all our knowledge of the country is derived. Of the Spaniards, the chief are, Gonzalo Pizarro, brother of the marquis, who conquered Peru and Orellana; and of the Portuguese, Texeira.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GUIANA, or CARIBEANA.</HEAD>
<P>Guiana, or Caribeana, is bounded on the east and north by the Atlantic Ocean, and the river Oroonoko; on the south by the country of the Amazons; and on the west by the provinces of Grenada and New-Andalusia, in Terra-Firma, from which it is separated both on the west and north, by the river Orconoko. It extends above twelve hundred miles from the north-east to the south-west, that is, from the mouth of the river Oroo∣noko to the mouth of the River of Amazons, and near six hundred in the contrary direction.</P>
<P>Most geopraphers divide it into two parts, call∣ing the country along the coast Caribeana Proper, and the interior country Guiana Proper: the last is also stiled El Dorado by the Spaniards, on account of the immense quantity of gold it is supposed to contain.</P>
<P>The Portuguese, French, and Dutch, have all settlements along the coast. What lies south of Cape North belongs to the first of these nations; the coast between Cape North and Cape Orange is possessed by the natives; French Guiana, Old Cayenne, or Equinoctial France, extends from Cape Orange, about two hundred and forty miles
<PB N="457" REF="4580"/>
along the coast, to the river Marani, where the Dutch territory begins, and extends to the mouth of the Oroonoko.</P>
<P>Along the coast the land is low, marshy, and subject to inundations in the rainy season, from a multitude of rivers which descend from the in∣land mountains. Hence it is, that the atmosphere is suffocating hot, moist, and unhealthful, especially where the woods have not been cleared away. In∣deed, the Europeans are forced to live in the most disagreeable situations, and fix their colonies at the mouths of the rivers, amidst stinking marshes, and the putrid ooze of salt morasses, for the con∣veniency of exportation and importation.</P>
<P>The chief settlements of the French in Guiana are in the Isle of Cayenne, which lies a hundred miles west of Cape Orange, at the mouth of a river of the same name. It is about seventeen leagues in com∣pass, well wooded and watered, admirably culti∣vated, and extremely fertile in sugar, tobacco, maiz, herbage, and the necessaries of life; but the French fort at the bottom of the harbour is wholly sup∣plied with fresh water by rain, which is preserved in large cisterns. At the easternmost point of the island is the town and fort of St, Lewis. The town contains above two hundred houses, occupied by mechanics and tradesmen, and the fort has a good garrison. Close by the fort also is secure an∣choring for a great number of shipping, in all sea∣sons of the year. The French first established themselves in this island, and the neighbouring con∣tinent, in the year 1635, under the conduct of Mr. Bretigny, who lost his life by the hand of the na∣tives. This unlucky accident reduced the colony to the greatest distress; but they bravely defended themselves against numerous armies of Indians, till the arrival of a reinforcement. However, they
<PB N="458" REF="4590"/>
afterwards abandoned this island, and the English took possession; but the French returning, obliged them to quit it; who were, in their turn, expelled by the Dutch, under the command of admiral Binks. The Dutch held their conquest but a short time; for they were driven out by the count d'Es∣trees, the French admiral, the same year; since which time it has been held by France, though the Hollanders have made some attempts to re∣cover their loss.</P>
<P>With respect to Dutch Guiana, we shall first present our readers with a short extract of what is most curious in an account of that country, lately published by a gentleman, who resided several years at Surinam, as a physician, and then add what fur∣ther seems necessary.</P>
<P>Guiana, according to that gentleman, was first discovered by Columbus in 1498. It lies between the 7°. of north, and the 5°. of south latitude, and be∣tween the 53 and 60°. of longitude west from Lon∣don. It is bounded on the north and east by the Atlantic; on the west by the rivers Oroonoko and Negroe; and on the south by the river of Amazons.</P>
<P>It is now divided between the Spaniards, Dutch, French, and Portuguese; but except its sea-coast, and lands adjacent to its rivers, it has hitherto re∣mained unknown to all but its original natives; and even of these, it is only in the Dutch territories that foreigners have any knowledge; for those of the Spaniards, French, and Portuguese, are in∣accessible to them.</P>
<P>This country, on account of the diversity and fertility of its soil, and of its vicinity to the equator, which passes through it, affords almost all the pro∣ductions of the different American countries be∣tween the tropics, besides a variety peculiar to itself.</P>
<P><PB N="459" REF="4600"/>
Dutch Guiana was formerly the property of the English, who made settlements at Surinam, where a kind of corrupt English is still spoken by the ne∣groes. The Dutch took it in the reign of Charles the second; and it was ceded to them by treaty in 1674, in exchange for what they had possessed in the province now called New York.</P>
<P>The land for fifty miles up the country from the sea coast is flat; and, during the rainy seasons, covered two feet high with water. This renders it inconceivably fertile, the earth, for twelve inches deep, being a stratum of perfect manure: an at∣tempt was once made to carry some of it to Bar∣badoes; but the wood-ants so much injured the vessel, that it was never repeated. The excessive richness of the soil is a disadvantage, for the canes are too luxuriant to make good sugar; and, there∣fore, during the first and second crop, are con∣verted into rum.</P>
<P>There are some trees on this part, but they are small and low, consisting chiefly of a small species of palm, intermixed with a leaf near thirty feet long, and three feet wide, which grows in clusters called a Troelie; and, at the edges of running∣water, with mangroves.</P>
<P>Farther inward the country rises, and the soil, though still fertile, is less durable. It is covered with forests of valuable timber, that are always green; and there are some sandy-hills, though no mountains; in the French territories, however, there are mountains, according to the report of the Indians, for they have never been visited by any other people.</P>
<P>In this country the heat is seldom disagreeable: the trade-winds by day, the land breezes in the evening, and the invariable length of the nights, with gentle dews, refresh the air, and render it temperate and salubrious. There are two wet sea∣sons,
<PB N="460" REF="4610"/>
and two dry, of three months each, in every year; and, during more than a month in each wet season, the rain is incessant. The dry seasons com∣mence six weeks beforé the equinoxes, and con∣tinue six weeks after. The wet seasons are more wholesome than the dry, because the rains keep the waters that cover the low lands, next the sea, fresh and in motion; but during the dry season it stagnates, and, as it wastes, becomes putrid, send∣ing up very unwholesome exhalations. Blossoms, green and ripe fruit, are to be found upon the same tree in every part of the year. There are some fine red and white agates in Guiana, which remain untouched; and mines of gold and silver, which the Dutch will not suffer to be wrought.</P>
<P>Besides many trees and plants common to it with other countries, and which have been often and accurately described, Guiana produces many pecu∣liar to itself, particularly the simaraba-tree, the bark of the roots of which is esteemed a specific in dy∣sentries; the caruna, a small poisonous nut, which the Indians reduce to powder, and conceal under their nails at their meetings, when they intend to re∣venge an injury, till they can put it into the drink of their victim; the woorara, a species of the nibbees, called by the Spaniards bejucos, which are a sort of ligneous cordage, some flat, some round. The round nibbees are innoxious; the flat poisonous. The woorara is a flat nibbee, used by the Indians in a composition to poison their arrows.</P>
<P>There are some animals also peculiar to Guiana, particularly the Iaubba. This animal is amphi∣bious, and about the size of a pig four months old. The head is shaped like that of a pug-dog, and its feet are like a dog's, but it has no tail. The species of monkies in Guiana are innumerable. Perhaps their kinds multiply by a promiscuous mixture, as dogs do among us. There are bats
<PB N="461" REF="4620"/>
here twice as large as ours, and without a tail. Most people in Guiana sleep in hammocks, as more secure from serpents and poisonous insects; but this does not secure them from the bats, which approach any part of the body that is uncovered, generally the feet, open a vein, and suck the blood till they are satisfied. There is also peculiar to Guiana a large venomous toad, called the pipa. Its young are bred in the back of the male, where the female deposites the eggs.</P>
<P>There is a great variety of beautiful birds in Guiana, but most of them are common to it with some other countries, and have been often described. Several persons in the Dutch colony employ them∣selves, and their slaves, in killing and preserving birds for the cabinets of Europe.</P>
<P>Most of the fishes of Guiana also are common to it with other countries; among the rest is the torpedo, or numbing-fish.</P>
<P>Guiana abounds in serpents of various kinds. There is one sort not venomous, that measures sometimes above thirty feet in length, and three in circumference. It has a taper tail, armed with two claws, like those of a dunghill cock. Small deer have been found in their stomach. There are also some of those called amphis baena.</P>
<P>The insects of Guiana are innumerable, owing to the constant warmth and humidity of the cli∣mate; but the most remarkable are such as are well known, and have been often described.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Guiana are either natives, who are of a reddish brown, or negroes and Euro∣peans, or a mixed progeny of these in various com∣binations. The natives are divided into different tribes, more or less enlightened, and polished, as they are more or less remote from the settlements of the Europeans. They allow polygamy, and have no division of lands. The men go to war,
<PB N="462" REF="4630"/>
hunt, and fish, and the women look after domestic concerns, spin, weave, in their fashion, and look after the planting cassava and manive, the only things which in this country are cultivated by the natives. Their arms are bows and arrows, short poisoned arrows, blown through a reed, which they use in hunting, and clubs made of a heavy wood called iron wood. They eat the dead bodies of those that are slain in war, and sell for slaves those they take prisoners; their wars being chiefly undertaken to furnish the European plan∣tations. All the different tribes go naked. On particular occasions they wear caps of feathers; but, as cold is wholly unknown, they cover no part but that which distinguishes the sex. They are chear∣ful, humane, and friendly, but timid, except when heated by liquor, and drunkenness is a very com∣mon vice among them.</P>
<P>Their houses consist of four stakes set up in a qua∣drangular form, with cross poles, bound together by slit nibbees, and covered with the large leaves called troelies. Their life is ambulatory, and their house, which is put up and taken down in a few hours, is all they have to carrry with them. When they remove from place to place, which, as they inhabit the banks of rivers, they do by water in small canoes, a few vessels of clay made by the women, a flat stone, on which they bake their bread, and a rough stone, on which they grate the roots of the cassava, a hammock and a hatchet, are all their furniture and utensils; most of them however have a bit of looking-glass framed in pa∣per, and a comb.</P>
<P>Their poisoned arrows are made of splinters of a hard heavy wood, called cacario; they are about twelve inches long, and somewhat thicker than a coarse knitting needle; one end is formed into a sharp point; round the other is wound some cot∣ton,
<PB N="463" REF="4640"/>
to make it fit the bore of the reed, through which it is to be blown. They will blow these ar∣rows forty yards with absolute certainty of hitting the mark, and with force enough to draw blood, which is certain and immediate death. Against this poi∣son no antidote is known. The Indians never use these poisoned arrows in war, but in hunting only, and chiefly against monkies; the flesh of an ani∣mal thus killed may be safely eaten, and even the poison itself swallowed with impunity.</P>
<P>All the tribes of Indians in Dutch Guiana believe the existence of one supreme God, the au∣thor of nature, and of inferior beings, always dis∣posed to mischief, exactly such as our devils. They have conjurers among them, who pretend to have an intercourse with these devils, and an influ∣ence over them; and have ceremonies much like what is called paw-wawing in other parts of Ame∣rica, which has been often described: they seem rather to wish than believe a future state; and as they suffer no anxiety about the next hour, they suffer still less about the next life.</P>
<P>They bury their dead naked: when the ceremo∣ny is over they drown their sorrows in a drunken feast; and when the body has lain so long in the earth, that the flesh is supposed to be rotten. The bones are taken out and distributed among the re∣lations: this ceremony is also attended with a drunken feast. The ceremony of marriage is nothing more. Though polygamy is allowed, it is not often practised: but when the wife is grown old and disagreeable, a girl about eight years old is taken into the house, who acts as a servant in domestic employments, till about eleven, and being then marriageable becomes a wife.</P>
<P>The Indians here have no chief; yet, living in a state in which artificial wants have not produced a general opposition of interest, and where natural
<PB N="464" REF="4650"/>
wants are easily supplied, their vices are but few. Continence before marriage is not considered as a virtue; a man cares not whether the woman he marries is a virgin or not; but no injury is so sure∣ly revenged as the infidelity of a wife.</P>
<P>Nothing is cultivated here by the natives but plantains, cassava, and yams; and one month's cultivation is sufficient for all these. The men are all hunters, and they can always find game or fish, if they prefer it, without danger or toil. They dress it by boiling, either in water or in the juice of cas∣sava, and season it very high with kyan, or red pep∣per. The only set time of eating is the evening, when they return from hunting; in general, they eat whenever they are hungry. They scarce know salt; but sometimes preserve animal food by smoke-drying it. Their drink is water or a fer∣mented liquor, prepared from the plantain, called pievoree; when they have plenty of this, they are continually drunk, so that their indolence and im∣providence, by preventing a constant supply, be∣come public and private blessings.</P>
<P>As the supplying the wants of nature in so fer∣tile and delightful a country takes up but a small portion of the time, they fill up the intervals by various amusements: they bathe and swim in the rivers, in large companies, several times a day, without distinction of sex; and they swim so well, that they may almost be reckoned among amphi∣bious animals. At other times they visit each other, and are mutually entertained with the sim∣ple occurrences of their lives, and a great variety of fables, which are merry, significant, and moral. Sometimes they dance, and frequently burst into immoderate laughter; and sometimes they recline indolently in their hammocks, where they not on∣ly sleep, but eat, converse, and play, blow a kind
<PB N="465" REF="4660"/>
of rustic flute, pluck out the hair of their beards, or admire themselves in looking-glasses.</P>
<P>The women suffer nothing in child-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which is attended either with danger or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. The mother and child, immediately after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, are plunged into the water, and the next day the re∣turns to her domestic employment, as if nothing had happened. The children are fed, and during their infancy no other care is taken of them; none are sickly, or deformed: the boys, as they grow up, attend the father in hunting, and the girls assist the mother. In old age, they become wrinkled; but never either bald or grey. As they have no me∣thod of computing time to any number of years, their age cannot be ascertained; but there is suffi∣cient reason to conclude, that their lives are long.</P>
<P>In all their traffic with each other, or with Eu∣ropeans, they estimate every thing by their present want of it; they will at one time demand a hatchet, for what at another time they will exchange for a fish-hook.</P>
<P>This blameless and happy people live together upon terms of perfect equality, having no distinc∣tion but of age, or personal merit; neither have they any division of property; each amicably parti∣cipates the ample blessings of a delightful and ex∣tensive country; envy, fraud, and violence are pre∣cluded, natural desires are immediately and innocent∣ly indulged, and government rendered wholly unne∣cessary. Thus far the abovementioned gentleman.</P>
<P>The states of Holland, to whom the colony of Surinam originally belonged, made it over to the Dutch West-India company; but that company not being in a conditon to send thither the necessa∣ry supplies, made over a third part of their share to the magistrates of Amsterdam, and another third part to Mynheer Van Aarsens, lord of Sommels∣dyk. Hence this colony is the joint property of
<PB N="466" REF="4670"/>
the West-India company, the city of Amsterdam, and the lord of Sommelsdyk; but the sovereignty of it belongs to the States-General. According∣ly, of the board of directors at Amsterdam, by which this colony is governed, five are chosen by the magistrates of that city, four by the West-In∣dia company, and one by the lord of Sommelsdyk; but the governor must be approved by the States-General, and take an oath to them, as well as to the directors.</P>
<P>The colony is now in the most flourishing con∣dition; and a considerable trade is carried on in sugar, tobacco, gums, dying drugs and woods, cof∣fee, cotton, flax, and skins; not only with Eu∣rope, but the West-India islands, especially the Bri∣tish. Besides Surinam, the capital, there are no less than seven or eight inland towns belonging to the colony all rich, populous, and commercial, and about five hundred plantations.</P>
<P>Surinam, which gives name to the adjacent country for a hundred miles round, stands within the river of the same name, in 6°. 16′. north lati∣tude. The river is navigable thirty leagues up the country; and, besides other forts situated on it, has one called Zelandria two leagues from the en∣trance, with a small town called Paramairambo, near it.</P>
<P>To the north-west of the colony of Surinam lies that of Berbice, which takes its name from a river, and is also governed by directors, chosen from among the proprietors in Holland, who, in 1732, obtained a privilege from the States-General to render the navigation to this colony free, and also to levy cer∣tain duties, both on the inhabitants and ships going out or in.</P>
<P>Further to the north-west lies the river Esequi∣bo, on which the Dutch have likewise settle∣ments; but whether they form a distinct colo∣ny
<PB N="467" REF="4680"/>
from the two above-mentioned, we are not in∣formed.</P>

<HEAD>The AMERICAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING described the whole continent of America, together with the islands in the South-Sea, on the coasts of Patagonia, Brasil, and Guiana, we now proceed to the other islands not yet described; and the first that present themselves to the northward of Guiana are those commonly called the West-Indian or Sugar Islands, though not the only such, comprehending the Greater and Les∣ser Antilles, the Caribbee Islands, divided into Windward and Leeward, the Virgin Islands, the Sotoventos, Bastimentos, and other small islands; but to avoid confusion, we shall describe them as they belong to the different European nations, be∣ginning with the British.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BRITISH WEST-INDIAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>JAMAICA.</HEAD>
<P>Jamaica, the largest of all the British West-In∣dian Islands, extends from 75°. 57′. to 78°. 37′. west longitude, and from 17°. 48′. to 18°. 50′. of north latitude; being about one hundred and sixty miles in length, from Point Negril, on the west, to Point Morant, on the east; and seventy from Portland Pitch, on the south, to Gallina Point, on the north, where it is broadest; but be∣ing
<PB N="468" REF="4690"/>
of an oval form, it grows narrower towards each end. It lies near four thousand five hundred miles south-west of England, one hundred south of Cuba, and seventy west of Hispaniola, contain∣ing between four and five millions of acres.</P>
<P>With respect to the air, there is no country be∣tween the tropics where the heat is more moderate, being constantly cooled with refreshing breezes, frequent rains, and nightly dews: however, it is unwholesome, especially on the sea coast, and ex∣cessively hot in the mornings all the year round, till about eight o'clock, when the sea-breeze begins, increasing gradually till about twelve, when it is commonly strongest, and lasts till two or three, when it begins to die away till about five o'clock, when it is quite spent, and returns no more till next morning. About eight in the evening begins a land-breeze, which blows four leagues into the sea, and continues increasing till twelve at night, after which it decreases till four in the morning, when it ceases, and returns again at night. The sea-breeze is stronger at some times than at others, and more so near the coast than within land; where∣as, it is just the reverse with the land-breeze. Sometimes the sea-breeze blows day and night for a week or two. In December, January, and Fe∣bruary, the north wind blows furiously, checking the growth of the canes, and all other vegetables, on the north side of the island; but the mountains cover the south side from them. Though it often rains at other times, yet the months of May and October bring the heaviest and most lasting rains; and the east and west parts of the island, contain∣ing large tracts of inclosed ground, are more sub∣ject to storms of wind and rain, and more unwhole∣some than the south and north. The south winds bring the most rain; no rains are lasting on the south side of the island, that come from the land.
<PB N="469" REF="4700"/>
Frost and snow are never seen here; but sometimes large hail, especially on the mountains, where the air is always cooler than in the low lands. The land-wind blowing in the nights, and the sea-breeze in the day time, no ship can come into port but in the day-time, nor go out but soon after day-break.</P>
<P>The dews here are so great within land, that the water drops from the leaves of the trees in the morning as if it had rained; but there are seldom any fogs, at least in the plain or sandy places near the sea.</P>
<P>Earthquakes are very frequent in Jamaica; the inhabitants expect one every year. A re∣markable one happened in 1668, which was felt all over the island. It was observed, that the ground rose like the sea in waves, as the earth∣quake passed along; but this was nothing to that which happened at Port Royal in 1692, by which that town was almost swallowed up.</P>
<P>As to the soil, and face of the island there is a ridge of hills, called the Blue Mountains, that runs from east to west, through it, furrowed by deep gullies on the north and south sides, made by the violent rains, which sall almost every day on those mountains, the tops of which are crowned with different kinds of trees, cedar, lignum vitae, mahogany, and the like, which render them equal∣ly pleasant and profitable to the inhabitants. Se∣veral fine rivers also, stored with fish, and navi∣gable by canoes, take their rise from them. A lower ridge runs parallel to the greater, and the vallies or savannahs are exceeding level, with∣out stones, fit for pasture, and fruitful, when cleared of wood, especially on the south side of the island. After the rains, or seasons, as they are called, their savannahs are very pleasant: but, after long droughts, look quite parched and burnt up. One may ride many miles in them without meet∣ing
<PB N="470" REF="4710"/>
the least ascent. They produce such quanti∣ties of grass that the inhabitants are sometimes forced to burn it. Notwithstanding the many rivers and lakes, water in some places is very scarce, and in others so mixed with sand and se∣diment, that it is not fit for use, till purified for some days in earthen jars; and many cattle, in some years, perish for want of water. There are several salt springs in the island, which form a salt river, and several lakes. Near the sea, as at Port Royal, the well water is brackish, and un∣wholsome. Though the soil of Jamaica in ge∣neral is exceeding fertile, yet it is thought not one fourth of the sugar ground upon the island is cultivated: even the grounds lying near the ri∣vers and the sea are in many places over-run with wood, insomuch that a planter who has patented three or four thousand acres, has seldom above five hundred well cultivated. One acre, in some places, has been known to yield several hogsheads of sugar.</P>
<P>The principal vegetables and produce of the island, besides sugar and rum, are cacao, of which chocolate is made, cotton, coffee, indigo, pimento, commonly called cod or Jamaica pepper, oranges, lemons, citrons, palms, pomegranates, shaddocks, mamies, sour-sops, papao, pine apples, custard apples, star apples, prickly pears, Alicada pears, melons, plantains, and guavas; dying woods, gums, and medicinal drugs, as guaiacum, China root, sarsa∣parilla, cassia fistula, tamarinds, venellas. Jamaica also produces some tobacco, but of a coarse kind, and cultivated only for the sake of the negroes, who are fond of it; Indian and Guinea corn, with peas of various kinds, but none resembling those of Great Britain, except those which are reared with great care and tenderness in gardens, toge∣ther with cabbages and a variety of roots, par∣ticularly
<PB N="471" REF="4720"/>
cassava, of which they make bread, yams, and potatoes.</P>
<P>The woods are stored with berries; but apples, and those fruits that are more peculiar to cold coun∣tries, thrive but poorly in Jamaica. Besides the productions we have mentioned, many others may be found in the accounts of the naturalists, who have treated of the island, particularly the manchineel tree, which bears a beautiful but poisonous apple, and the wild cinnamon, which is esteemed a sovereign remedy for dispelling wind, and assisting digestion.</P>
<P>After all, the sugar cane is the glory and chief support of Jamaica. This plant is thought to have been known to the Romans, and to have been ori∣ginally a native of the Canary Islands, from whence the Spaniards and Portuguese, after they began to trade with Africa, carried it to their own countries, and also to their East and West India settlements.</P>
<P>The consumption of sugar in Great Britain, one year with another, has been computed at seventy thousand hogsheads, each containing twelve hundred weight, and all our colonies are supposed to produce, on an average, eight hundred and fifty thousand hogsheads of sugar yearly. It is computed that there are three hundred sail of ships sent every year to our sugar colonies from Great-Britain, which are navigated by four thousand five hundred sea∣men; that the frieght of the sugars brought hither amount to a hundred and seventy thousand pounds sterling per annum, and the duty, commission, &amp;c. to little less than two hundred thousand more. As to the exports from hence to our sugar colonies, it appeared by the custom-house books, in 1726, that all the British manufactures, exported to Bar∣badoes, all the Leeward Islands, and Jamaica, the latter of which generally takes as much for the Spa∣nish trade, &amp;c. as all those other islands, amounted
<PB N="472" REF="4730"/>
to two hundred and thirty-four thousand, seven hundred and eighty-five pounds, seventeen shillings, sterling. We may venture to assert, that they are a third more now.</P>
<P>The Jamaica sugar is said to be the best of all our plantations, and made with the greatest ease. There were about sixty sugar mills in Jamaica as long ago as 1670, which made about two million of pounds weight of sugar; and it is said, they now make ten times as much as they did then. The Jamaica rum is esteemed the best in the world, and is in the greatest request in England. We are told about four thousand puncheons of it are exported yearly.</P>
<P>There are few colonies in America so well stocked with cattle as this: horses, asses, and mules, are very cheap; and there would have been numbers of horned cattle, had not the inhabitants, who mind planting much more than grazing, les∣sened their stock by their inattention; so that, at present, they are supplied with beef from the British colonies on the continent, whence they have also salted pork and fish, flour, pease, &amp;c. Their sheep are large and fat, and their flesh very good; but the wool, which is long and full of hairs, is worth nothing. Beef cannot be kept many days, though it be salted, and fresh beef is ready to cor∣rupt in four or five hours. Butchers therefore al∣ways kill in the morning, just before day, and by seven o'clock the markets are over.</P>
<P>Masters are obliged to furnish their servants, both whites and blacks, with three pounds of salt beef, pork, or fish, every week, besides cassavi bread, yams, and potatoes. Here are abundance of goats, rabbits and hogs, but no hares or deer. Of wild fowl their is a great variety, as ducks, teal, widgeons, geese, turkies, pidgeons, Guinea-hens, plover, flamingo's, snipes, parrots, paroquets, and humming birds.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="4740"/>
The bays, roads, and rivers of Jamaica abound with excellent fish, of almost all the European and American kinds; but the tortoise is by much the most valuable, both for its shell and fish, the latter being accounted the most delicious, and, at the same time, the most wholesome in all the In∣dies. The manatee, or sea-cow, which is often taken in calm bays, by the Indians, is reckoned extraordinary good eating.</P>
<P>Besides these ordinary provisions, the racoon, a small quadruped, is eaten; rats are also sold by the dozen, and when they have been bred among the sugar canes, are thought, by some people, very delicious food. Snakes and serpents, and cossi, a sort of worms, are eaten by the Indians and ne∣groes.</P>
<P>The most common drink is water, or rum di∣luted with water, and punch. Great quantities also of Madeira wine are drank, that wine having this particular quality, that it keeps better in a hot place, or exposed to the sun, than in a cool cellar: cyder, beer, and ale are also brought hither from the northern colonies. It is observed that passen∣gers, when they come first to Jamaica, sweat con∣tinually in great drops, for three quarters of a year, yet they are not more dry than in England, nor even faintish.</P>
<P>This and all the other governments in the British American Islands, are royal governments. The king appoints the governor and council, and the representatives are chosen by the freemen of every parish, and those assemblies make laws, but they must be confirmed by the court of England.</P>
<P>The inhabitants are either English, or of English extraction, born on the island: Indians, negroes, mulattos, or mestize, or the descendants of them. The English, and those of English extraction, may be thirty thousand; the Indians are but few,
<PB N="474" REF="4750"/>
most of the natives having been destroyed by the Spaniards. The negroes on the island are about a hundred thousand.</P>
<P>Besides the militia there is generally a regiment of foot from Great-Britain here; and a squadron of British men of war is usually stationed at Port Royal, even in time of peace. Sir William Trelaw∣ney, Bart. is the present governor and—Forest, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> commodore of the squadron. The principal part of the revenues accruing to the crown of Great-Britain from Jamaica, is the duty arising from sugar, rum, and melasses, imported from hence, which is very considerable.</P>
<P>The religion of the church of England is the established religion in all the British islands; but there are yet no bishops; the bishop of London's commissary is the principal ecclesiastic in these islands.</P>
<P>Jamaica is divided into nineteen parishes or precincts, the chief towns in which are St Jago de la Vega, or Spanish Town, Kingston, Port-Pas∣sage, and Port-Royal.</P>
<P>St. Jago de la Vega, or Spanish Town, stands on the river Cobre, in a pleasant valley. The houses, though but one story high, consist of seve∣ral commodious apartments, all of them well fur∣nished and finished with mahogony. Here the governor and most of the principal people of the island reside, and the assemblies and courts of jus∣tice are held; in consquence of which there are many coaches and chariots belonging to it, with plays, balls, concerts, and such like polite diver∣sions; but there is only one church and a chapel. Spanish Town sends three representatives to the as∣sembly. Before the governor's house is an exchange, to which the merchants and others repair to do business. The chief inhabitants often take an air∣ing in a savannah that lies close by the town.
<PB N="475" REF="4760"/>
The night-watch, or patrole, consists of four horse and seven foot soldiers.</P>
<P>Kingston, the largest town in the island, stands on the bay or harbour of Port-Royal, ten or twelve miles south east of St. Jago, and five by water, but fifteen by land, from Port-Royal. It stands com∣modiously for fresh water, and all other conve∣niencies of life, being about a mile long, and half a mile broad, with handsome regular streets. The harbour is one of the most commodious in Ame∣rica. It is about three leagues broad in most places, and so deep that a ship of seven hundred tons may lay close to the shore. and it can safely contain a thousand sail. Its entrance is defended by Fort Charles, one of the strongest belonging to the English islands, a battery of sixty pieces of can∣non, and a garrison of regulars, maintained by the crown. The river Cobre, on which Spa∣nish Town stands, falls into this bay.</P>
<P>Port Royal, notwithstanding the calamities that have befallen it, its hot and dry situation, and the want of fresh water, stones, and grass, hath been, in some measure, rebuilt, and its commo∣diousness hath tempted many to settle on the seemingly devoted spot, and run all risks.</P>
<P>Port-Passage, or Passage Fort, is a sea-port town, seven miles south-east of St. Jago, at the mouth of the river Cobre, so called, because it is the greatest thoroughfare in the island. The fort here mounts ten or twelve guns.</P>
<P>There are several other small places and good harbours in the island, as Port Morant, Port Pedro, Port Antonio, Bluefield Bay, and the harbour of Cape Negril.</P>
<P>Jamaica was discovered by Columbus in 1493; and taken from the Spaniards by general Venables, and a squadron of men of war, under the com∣mand of admiral Penn, in 1654. They conti∣nued
<PB N="476" REF="4770"/>
however to lurk in some parts of the island several years after; but at the revolution it was so entirely reduced, that the Spaniards yielded it to the crown of Great Britain, to which it has belonged ever since; and is, doubtless, the noblest posses∣sion we have in those parts.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BARBADOES.</HEAD>
<P>Barbadoes, the most considerable of all the British sugar islands next to Jamaica, one of the chief, and most windwardly, except Tobago, of the Carib∣bees, is said to lie ninety miles south-east of Martini∣co, and seventy east of St. Vincent; between 59°. 50′. and 60°. 2′. west of London; and between 12°. 56′. and 13°. 16′. north latitude; extending twenty-five miles from north to south, and fifteen from east to west. The superficial content is about one hundred and seven thousand acres.</P>
<P>The climate is hot, especially for eight months in the year, but not unwholesome; for though there are no land breezes, there are others arising from the sea, which increase as the sun advances to, and abate as he declines from the meridian. A temperate regimen renders it as safe to live in as any climate in Europe, south of Britain; and ac∣cording to the opinion of many, as Britain itself. The days are very near equal, the sun rising about six and setting about six all the year round. The rains fall here as in other parts of the torrid zone, chiefly when the sun is vertical. The damps or dews are so great in the night, that every bit of iron will soon be eaten up with rust, if it be not in constant use. The twilights are so short here, that it is dark three quarters of an hour after sun∣set. They have sometimes hurricanes in autumn, by which the plantations suffer greatly; but they are not so frequent as in the neighbouring islands.</P>
<P><PB N="477" REF="4780"/>
Barbadoes is generally a plain level country, with some small hills; and the woods have been all cut down to make room for the plantations of sugar-canes, which now take up almost the whole island, and render it the most valuable plantation to Great-Britain, for its size, that it ever possessed. Notwithstanding the smallness of the island, its soil is different, being in some places sandy and light, in others rich, and in others spungy; but all of them cultivated, according to their several na∣tures: so that the island presents to the eye the most beautiful appearance of spring, summer, and au∣tumn, producing sugar, rum, molasses, cotton, indigo, ginger, pine-apples, guavas, plantains, oranges, lemons, citrons, limes, or dwarf-lemons, aloes, tamarinds, mangroves, calabashes, cedars, cacao and cocoa-nuts, prickled-apples, pome∣granates, papays, custard-apples, with fig-trees, mangroves, calabashes, cedars, cabbage, cassia, fistula, mastic, and bulley-trees. The citrons of Barbadoes afford the finest drams and sweetmeats; and the juice of the limes are the most agreeable souring we know of; and great quantities are now imported into Great-Britain and Ireland.</P>
<P>The inhabitants have few orchards or gardens, because they employ their lands in a more profita∣ble culture; and they can bring Indian corn from North-America cheaper than it can be sold for, when growing upon the island.</P>
<P>As for animals, here are abundance of hogs, which are much finer eating than those of Eng∣land, oxen, cows, horses, asses, goats, monkeys, and racoons, with a few sheep and rabbits; but the mutton is inferior to that of England.</P>
<P>Of wild fowl here are teals, curlews, plovers, snipes, wild pidgeons, wild-ducks, and a kind of bird called a man of war. The tame pidgeons, pullets, ducks, and poultry of all kinds, that are
<PB N="478" REF="4790"/>
bred in Barbadoes, have a fine flavour, and are accounted more delicious than those of Europe.</P>
<P>Insects are very numerous, but not venomous in Barbadoes, nor do either their snakes or scorpions ever sting.</P>
<P>The surrounding sea abounds with fish, some of which are almost peculiar to itself, as parrot-fish, snappers, and grey-cavellos, tarbums, and coney∣fish. Their mullets, lobsters, and crabs, are excel∣lent; and the green turtle, the greatest delicacy that antient or modern luxury can boast of: be∣sides the variety of eating in it, it is at once so light and nutritive, that no bad consequences are known to attend it from indigestion or surfeit, be the quan∣tity devoured ever so great.</P>
<P>This island has two streams that are called rivers on each side, with wells of good water all over it; and large ponds or reservoirs for rain∣water: and in its center it is said to have a bitu∣minous spring, which sends forth a liquor like tar; and serves for the same uses as pitch or lamp-oil.</P>
<P>It has been computed, that between twenty and thirty thousand hogsheads of sugar are exported from hence, one year with another.</P>
<P>With regard to indigo, great quantities of which were formerly exported from hence, now little or none is made; but of scraped and scalded ginger, lignum-vitae, citron water, melasses, rum, lime∣juice and fruits, they export vast quantities.</P>
<P>As to imports, they bring lumber, that is tim∣ber of all kinds, bread, flour, Indian corn, rice, tobacco, some salt beef and pork, fish, pulse, and other provisions, from the northern colonies; slaves from the coast of Africa; wine from Madeira, Tercera, and Fial, and likewise some brandy; beef and pork from Ireland; salt from Curassao; Osnaburghs, linen of all sorts, broad cloth and
<PB N="479" REF="4800"/>
kerseys, silks and stuffs, red caps, stockings and shoes of all sorts, gloves and hats, millenary ware and perriwigs, laces, peas, beans, and oats, biscuit, wine, strong beer, pale ale, pickles, candles, butter, and cheese, iron-ware for their sugar-works, leaden ware, powder and shot, brass and copper-wares, &amp;c. from Old England.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Barbadoes are reducible to three classes, viz. the masters, the white servants, and the black servants: the former are either English, Scotch, or Irish, with some Dutch, French, Portuguese, and Jews. The white servants, whe∣ther by covenant or purchase, lead more easy lives than the common day-labourers in England; and when they come to be overseers, their wages, and other allowances, are considerable. As to the black servants, it is the interest of every planter to be more careful of them than even of the white; the former, unless they should happen to be made free, with all their posterity, being his perpetual pro∣perty. Most of the negroes are employed in the field; but some of them work in the sugar-mills and storehouses; while those of both sexes, who are most likely and handy, are employed as house∣maids and menial servants. The original price of a negroe, when he comes from Guinea, is from twenty to forty pounds sterling, according to their likelihood; but when they improve in any me∣chanic, or other trade, the price rises greatly: so that four hundred pounds has been refused for a good sugar-boiler. The men are indulged in a plurality of wives. But it is ridiculous to imagine that their being converted to Christianity intro∣duces any alteration in their state of servitude. All the difference is, that a planter of any huma∣nity may shew some indulgence to a negroe, who discovers sentiment or reflexion enough, to desire to be baptized. But the truth is, the negroes, in
<PB N="480" REF="4810"/>
general, are of such dispositions, as call for the ut∣most vigilance, and the most severe discipline. They are obstinate, sullen, treacherous, and vin∣dictive; and many of them shew but few faculties that entitle them to be considered as rational crea∣tures. Plantains are the chief support of the negroes, who have various ways of dressing them; but they have every week, at stated times, an allowance of Indian corn, bread, salt-fish, or salt-pork. Every negroe family has a cabin; and adjoining to it, a small piece of ground, by way of garden, in which the more industrious sort plant potatoes, yams, and other roots, and rear live stock, which they are at liberty to eat or convert into money for their own use: and it is incredible what savings of this kind some of them make. They are fond of rum and tobacco; and they generally lay out their earnings in fine cloaths, and ornaments for them∣selves and their wives. The negroes, mulattos, and mestize slaves upon the island are computed at one hundred thousand.</P>
<P>The governor of Barbadoes has a salary of two thousand pound sterling, payable out of the four and half per cent. besides a third of all seizures. The council consists of twelve members, and the assembly of twenty-two, chosen yearly, out of the several parishes, viz. two for each, by a majority of votes. Most of the civil officers are appointed by the governor, who also collates rectors to the parishes of the island. The perquisites of them are very con∣siderable; and their stated salary about one hundred and fifty, or two hundred pounds a year; but the rectory of St. Michael's in Bridgetown is supposed to be worth seven or eight hundred pounds a year. The church affairs of Barbadoes are governed by a surrogate of the bishop's appointment. There are upon the island some Jews and Quakers, but very
<PB N="481" REF="4820"/>
few other dissenters. The present governor is William Spry, <ABBR>esq</ABBR>.</P>
<P>As to the military establishment, here are several forts, with a good train of artillery, and a militia consisting of six regiments of foot, two of horse, and a troop, called the troop of horse guard.</P>
<P>The island is divided into several precincts, and these again into parishes, in which the only place of any note is Bridgetown, situate on Carlisle bay, in the south west part of the island, and having the best, or rather the only harbour therein. It is rec∣koned the finest and largest town in all the Caribbee-Islands, if not in all the English West-India colonies, taking its name from a bridge in the east part of it, erected over the waters that come from the neighbouring marshes, after rains; but a dreadful fire lately destroyed a great part of it. It is the seat of the governor, council, and assembly; and also of the court of chancery. The governor's house is about a mile out of the town, which is not reckoned very healthy, on account of the neigh∣bouring marshes. There are several forts and bat∣teries about the town and bay, the latter of which is large enough to contain five hundred sail, and has twenty fathom anchorage, in water so clear, that one sees the bottom, but so rocky, that ca∣bles are always buoyed up with casks.</P>
<P>Here is a college, with a revenue for professors in the several sciences, to which colonel Codrington was the principal benefactor.</P>
<P>This island was first resorted to by the English in the reign of king James I. but James earl of Carlisle obtained the first grant of it in 1625, the first year of king Charles I. who parcelled it out to several adventurers, that transported them∣selves hither. They found no inhabitants, but a good breed of hogs, supposed to have been left here by the Spaniards and Portuguese, in their
<PB N="482" REF="4830"/>
voyages to the continent of America. The ad∣venturers applied themselves at first to the planting of tobacco, which not thriving as expected, they planted cotton and indigo, which yielded a con∣siderable profit; but they made little sugar till 1647, when the colonels Modiford, Drax, and Walrond, with other cavaliers, living uneasy under the usurpation, converted their estates into money, and transported themselves to Barbadoes, where they erected sugar works, and acquired very great estates; and, in the year 1650, the white inhabi∣tants of the island were increased to upwards of 30,000, with twice that number of negroes, who exercised their masters with constant conspiracies, in hopes of recovering their liberty; but not suc∣ceeding, were severely punished. King Charles II. purchased the property of the island, in 1661, ever since which time Barbadoes has been a royal government, and the colony granted a duty of four and a half per cent on their sugars, for main∣taining the forces and fortifications of the island, which amounts to ten thousand pounds per annum; but is not always applied to the purposes it was designed for, and proves an insupportable burthen on the planters, no other island having so high a duty laid on their sugars. De Ruyter, the Dutch admiral, treacherously attempted to surprize this island in 1669, in a time of peace, but was bravely repulsed.</P>

<HEAD>St. CHRISTOPHER'S.</HEAD>
<P>The Island of St. Christopher's, called by our seamen St. Kitts, lies between 17°. 10′. and 17°. 46′. north latitude, about 62°. 30′. west of Lon∣don, four miles north of Nevis, and about sixty from Antigua. Its length, from east to west, is twenty-five miles and a half; its greatest breadth,
<PB N="483" REF="4840"/>
from north to south, seven; and its circumference about seventy-five.</P>
<P>It was discovered by Christopher Columbus in his first voyage to America, who is said to have called it St. Christopher, not from his own name, but from the figure of a very high mountain in the upper part of it, which bearing a lesser on its summit, put him in mind of the picture of St. Christopher, who is represented as a giant, with our infant Saviour on his back.</P>
<P>The air is sultry, but pleasant and healthful. Some represent it as one of the most delightful islands in the world. A ridge of mountains runs through the island, the tops of which are over∣grown with palmettoes, cotton trees, lignum-vitae, but the sides and the skirts of them are very fertile. This island produces not only sugar, but to∣bacco, indigo, ginger, pine-apples, papaus, tama∣rinds, prickle-pears, two different kinds of pep∣per, with cotton, maize, gourds, water-melons, lettuce, parsley, peas, purslane, and many other vegetables. The produce of sugar is said to be fourteen thousand hogsheads per annum, at a me∣dium, the quality of which is reckoned superior to that of Barbadoes. The island, in general, is well supplied with springs and hot baths, the mountains being of a sulphureous composition. In a mountain about three miles north of Fort Charles, there is said to be a silver mine: but it is not worked. The whole land on the island, fit for sugar planta∣tion, does not exceed, it is thought, 24000 acres, and those of light sandy soil. At the south-east end are salt ponds, which yield a salt more strong and pungent than the French. They are said to make three hogsheads of sugar here to one of rum.</P>
<P>There are several forts in the island, well provi∣ded with arms, artillery, and military stores. The
<PB N="484" REF="4850"/>
inhabitants are computed at about eight thousand whites, and above eighteen thousand negroes.</P>
<P>Basseterre, the capital, is said to be a very hand∣some town. It is situated on a cape, that has a bay on each side, fit for shipping, and is secured by Londonderry fort towards the east, and by six batteries, raised at different landing places, and mounting forty-three cannon.</P>
<P>This island was discovered, as we have already observed, by Columbus in his first voyage to Ame∣rica. The Spaniards having deserted it, the English and French took possession of it in 1625, and di∣vided it between them. They lived in great amity together, till a war broke out between the two na∣tions, when the English drove the French entirely out of the island; and the country having been yielded to the crown of Great-Britain, by the treaty of Utrecht, all the French territory was sold for the benefit of the public. The lieutenant governor of this island is—Poole, <ABBR>esq</ABBR>.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ANTIGUA.</HEAD>
<P>Antigua is of a circular form, about twenty miles each way, and near sixty in circumfe∣rence.</P>
<P>It is more noted for good harbours, than all the English islands in these seas; yet so encompassed with rocks, that it is of dangerous access in many parts of it, especially to those that are not well acquainted with the coast. Of these har∣bours, the chief are, Nonesuch, St. John's, En∣glish, and Falmouth harbours, Willoughby and Carlisie bays.</P>
<P>The climate is hotter than Barbadoes, and very subject to hurricanes. The soil is sandy, and much of it overgrown with wood; but what is worse, there are but few springs, and not so much as a
<PB N="485" REF="4860"/>
single brook in the island; so that its chief de∣pendence for fresh water is on what falls from the skies; yet for all this it is a thriving plantation. Its product is much the same with that of the other Caribbee-Islands. As good Muscovado su∣gar is now made here as in any of the sugar islands, and they also have learned the art of claying it.</P>
<P>This island contains about seventy thousand acres, and produces, one year with another, about seven∣teen or eighteen thousond hogsheads of sugar, with ginger, cotton, pine-apples, plantanes, wild cinna∣mon, and other tropical fruits, and some tobacco. There is more venison here than in any other of our Caribbee islands, with great plenty of fowl and black cattle.</P>
<P>St. John's, which was lately almost destroyed by a dreadful fire, is the capital of the island, and lord Ha wley the lieutenant governor.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>NEVIS.</HEAD>
<P>Nevis is about six leagues in circumference, and lies only three or four miles south of St. Christo∣pher's. The soil is fruitful, and the staple com∣modity sugar, which serves all the purposes of mo∣ney. Here are sometimes violent rains and tor∣nadoes, as in the other islands, and the air is even hotter than that of Barbadoes. There are many remarkable insects and reptiles, as the flying tyger, the horn-fly, and fly-catcher, and a kind of snail called the soldier; and some of the lizards are of a monstrous size. The sea abounds with a variety of excellent fish, as groopers, rock-fish, old-wives, cavallies, welshmen, mudfish, wilks, cockles, lob∣sters, &amp;c. Land crabs are very common on this isle: they are smaller than sea crabs, and make little burrows, like rabbits, in the woods, towards the tops of the mountains. The only venomous creatures are scorpions and centipedes.</P>
<P><PB N="486" REF="4870"/>
They have plenty of asparagus here, and there is a tree called diddle-doo, which bears a lovely blossom of the finest yellow and scarlet colours, and is esteemed a sovereign remedy against the green sickness. The liquorice-bush runs wild along the stone walls of common fields, like the vine; but there is no lignum vitae, or iron wood, here. The butter of this island is not good, and new cheese far worse. The sheep have no horns nor wool, but are hairy and smooth skinned, and generally full of small red or black spots, resem∣bling those of a fine spaniel. They breed twice a year, if not oftener, and generally bring two, three, or four lambs at a time; and what is more ex∣traordinary, suckle them all. The rams are of a red pale colour, with a thick row of long strait red hair hanging down from the lower jaw to their breast, as far as the fore legs. The hogs, being fed with Indian corn, Spanish potatoes, and sugar-cane juice, are exceeding sweet food, white, and fat; and so are the fowls and turkies, which are fed with the same diet. The ground doves here are about the size of a lark, of a chocolate colour, spotted with a dark blue, their heads like that of a robin-red-breast, and their eyes and legs of a most pure red.</P>
<P>There are excellent game cocks and fierce bull-dogs in this isle, notwithstanding the notion that they both degenerate out of England, be∣sides large cur-dogs, but no hounds or spaniels. It is said some of their negroes eat dogs flesh.</P>
<P>In the mountain plantations they have excellent cucumbers, common lettuces, kidney beans, cel∣lery, &amp;c. In these plantations also English beans blossom, but never pod.</P>
<P>An English shilling goes here for one shilling and six-pence; and the French, Spanish, and Por∣tuguese coin bear near the same proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="487" REF="4880"/>
The fees for a funeral-sermon are three pounds, or five hundred weight of sugar; and for every christening, marriage, and burial, twelve shillings and six pence. The king gives twenty pounds out of the Exchequer to the clergy, who are sent hither by the bishop of London to vacant parishes, to defray the charges of their voyage. The only town of this island is Charles-Town, which is de∣fended by a fort of the same name; and has a re∣gular weekly market every Sunday morning.</P>
<P>The English sent the first colony to this island anno 1628. In 1690 an earthquake almost de∣stroyed their chief town. The whites are com∣puted at three thousand; and the negroes at three times that number, of whom, at least, four thou∣sand are employed in the sugar business. A few regular troops are maintained at his majesty's ex∣pence. The perpendicular height of the moun∣tain, which composes the island, is said to be a mile and a half. In the east part there is a river, which affords excellent mullets, and other fish; but there is no good harbour in the whole island.</P>
<P>Here, and in the other Caribbees, it is said, if a white man kills a black, he cannot be tried for his life for the murder; and all that he suffers is a fine of thirty pounds currency to the master, for the loss of his slave. If a negroe strikes a white man, he is punished with the loss of his hand; and if he should draw blood, with death. A negroe cannot be evidence against a white man.</P>
<P>The Nevisians are said to have three public an∣nual fasts, to implore the Divine Protection against hurricanes; and if none happen in July, August, or September, they have a public thanksgiving in October. The present lieutenant-governor is co∣lonel James Johnston.</P>

<HEAD>MONTSERRAT.</HEAD>
<P>Monserrat was discovered by Columbus in 1493. It lies twenty-five miles almost south south-east from Nevis; twenty west south-west from An∣tigua; forty north-west from Guadaloupe; and two hundred and forty from Barbadoes. It is of an oval figure; about three leagues in length; the same in breadth; and eighteen in compass. The Spaniards gave it the name of Monserrat from a fancied resemblance that it bore to a mountain of that name near Barcelona, in Old Spain; where is a famous chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin.</P>
<P>The climate, soil, and produce of Montserrat are much the same as those of the other English Carib∣bee Islands. The mountains yield cedars, the Cy∣press-tree, the iron-tree, with other woods, and some odoriferous shrubs. It is well watered and fruitful; and the planters formerly raised a great deal of indigo. The surrounding seas produce some hide∣ous monsters, particularly two, which from their re∣markable ugliness, as well as the poisonous quality of their flesh, are called sea devils. The lamanture, by some called the sea-cow, is found in this island, and generally at the entrance of fresh water rivers. According to the accounts we have of it, it is an amphibious animal; and lives mostly on herbage. Its flesh is reckoned very wholesome food, when salted; and they are so large, that two or three of them load a canoe.</P>
<P>The residence of the governor of the Leeward Islands is either upon Nevis, Antigua, Mont∣serrat, or St. Christopher's; but each of the three islands, where he does not reside, has a deputy∣governor of its own, who is appointed by the crown likewise, and who presides both over the assembly and the council; the latter of which, in
<PB N="489" REF="4900"/>
each island, is nominated by the governor general. Within the term of about twenty years there is commonly a general assembly of the councils and assemblies, or their deputies, from all the four islands, for the good of the whole. The functions of the lieutenant-governor are superseded by the governor general; the latter of whom, at present, is—Woodley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> and the former, in this island, colonel Carpenter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>BARBUDA.</HEAD>
<P>Barbuda is a small island, fifteen miles north-east of Monserrat; its length being about twenty miles, and its breadth twelve. It is the property of the Codrington family, who have the appoint∣ment of the governor. Part of the estate arising from it, amounting, as it is said, to two thousand pounds a year, with two plantations in Barbadoes, was bequeathed, in 1710, by Christopher Codring∣ton, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> governor and captain-general of Bar∣badoes, to the society for propagating the gospel, towards the instruction of the negroes, in the Ca∣ribbee Islands, in the Christian religion, and the erection of a college at Barbadoes, for teaching the liberal arts.</P>
<P>The land of this island lies low, but is fertile: the inhabitants apply themselves chiefly to the breeding of cattle, and raising provisions, with which they supply the neighbouring islands. Many of the commodities, however, which are raised in the other West India islands, may be also raised here, such as citrons, pomegranates, oranges, raisins, Indian figs, maiz, cocoa-nuts, cinnamon, pine-apples, and the sensitive plant, with various kinds of woods and drugs, such as Brasil, ebony, pepper, indigo, and the like. There are some large serpents on the island, but they are so far
<PB N="490" REF="4910"/>
from being poisonous or noxious, that they destroy rats, toads, and frogs; though the sting or bite of others are mortal, unless an antidote is applied to them in two hours. On the west side of the island is a good well sheltered road, clear from rocks and sands.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ANGUILLA.</HEAD>
<P>Anguilla, so called from its snail-like form, is about thirty miles long, and ten broad; and lies thirty miles north-west of St. Christopher's. The inhabitants, as at Barbuda, apply themselves chiefly to the breeding and feeding of cattle, planting Indian corn, and other parts of husbandry; though they still plant some sugar; and the island is, in general, said to be capable of great improvement.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>DOMINICA.</HEAD>
<P>Dominica lies between Martinico and Guade∣loupe, about eight leagues from each, being near twenty-eight miles long, and thirteen broad. Be∣fore the late peace, by which this and the two fol∣lowing were ceded to Great-Britain, it was a neu∣tral island, and served occasionally to wood and water in. Next to Canada and Louisiana, it may be considered as one of the most valuable acquisi∣tions we obtained by that peace. When it was reduced by lord Rollo towards the close of the late war, he found almost the whole windward coast settled by the French, notwithstanding it had been formally declared to be neutral by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1648. There is no commo∣dity or vegetable produced by the richest of our other islands, that may not be raised here in great abundance. The declivities of the hills may be cultivated to the very tops, so gentle is their rise;
<PB N="491" REF="4920"/>
and they often terminate in beautiful, well wa∣tered, fruitful vallies. The soil is of a black mould, and remarkably rich. It contains about thirty rivers, one of them navigable up the country for some miles. Here, as in some others of the Carib∣bees, is a sulphur mountain, and hot spring, equal in salubrity to those of Bath in England; and the fine fruits, particularly the pine-apples, are superior to any that grow on the French islands; and no better timber of every kind is to be found, than what grows in Dominica. At the north-west end of the island, is a deep spacious sandy bay, called Prince Rupert's; and well secured from the winds by mountains on all sides. There are still about three or four hundred natives upon the island. By the latest advices, it appears, that the sale and settlement of the lands in this and the other neutral islands advance very fast.—Young, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> is lieutenant governor.</P>

<HEAD>ST. VINCENT.</HEAD>
<P>This island is about twenty-four miles in length, and eighteen in breadth, lying about fifty miles north-west of Barbadoes. It is generally allowed, that St. Vincent is one of the best of all the An∣tilles Islands. The soil is excellent, as likewise the water and the woods. Tobacco, it is said, may be cultivated here to great perfection. When it was ceded by the treaty of Versailles in 1763, to Great-Britain, there was a great number of a mixed breed of the Caribbeans, or antient inhabitants, and of ship-wrecked, or run-away negroes on it. There is a fine bay to leeward, besides others. The lieu∣tenant governor is colonel Fitz-Maurice.</P>

<PB N="492" REF="4930"/>
<HEAD>TOBAGO.</HEAD>
<P>Tobago lies forty leagues south by west from Barbadoes; about thirty-five south-east from St. Vincent; forty east from Granada; and between thirty and forty from the Spanish Main. It is thirty-two miles in length, about nine in breadth, and seventy in circumference; so that it is ra∣ther larger than Barbadoes, or indeed any of our Leeward Islands: and, near the north-east extremi∣ty, lies a small island, called Little Tobago, which is two miles in length, and one in breadth.</P>
<P>The climate of Tobago is far more temperate than could be expected in an island that is but 11°. 10′. north from the equator; for the force of the sun is diminished by the sea breezes. The spice and gum-trees, with which it abounds, contribute to its salubrity. Tobago has another favourable circumstance to recommend it; namely, its lying out of the tract of those hurricanes that often prove so fatal to the other West-India islands. The north-west extremity is mountainous; but the rest of the island agreeably diversified with risings and fallings. The soil, in general, is a rich black mould proper for producing, in the greatest plenty, whatever is raised in other parts of the West-Indies. There are many springs, together with commodious bays and creeks. But the valuable trees which grow here are, perhaps, its greatest riches; for be∣sides the different kinds of wood that are found in the other West-Indian Islands, it is said, that the true nutmeg-tree, and the cinnamon-tree, with that which produces the real gum-copal, are found on this island. The fig-trees on Tobago are reck∣oned equal to those in Spain and Portugal. India and Guinea-corn, French-beans, various kinds of peas, the cushou-apple, that is both meat and
<PB N="493" REF="4940"/>
drink, and yields an excellent lamp-oil; the prickle∣apple, the banana, pomegranate, pine-apple, sweet and bitter-orange, lemons, sugar, tobacco, indigo, ginger, sarsaparilla, semper vivum, citrons, vanel∣loes, limes, guavas, plantanes, tamarinds, grapes, custard-apple, the sour-apple, the papaw-apple, mammie-apple, the yellow plum, cherries, the cocao-tree, that yields both meat, drink, and cloath∣ing; musk, cucumbers, water-melons, pomkins, gourds, potatoes, yams, carrots, turneps, parsneps, onions, cassada-root, natural balsam, balm, silk∣grass; five different sorts of pepper, the long, the cod, the bell, the round, and the Jamaica, and tea are said to be either the spontaneous production of the island, or such as may be raised by cultiva∣tion.</P>
<P>As for animals, here are wild hogs, pickerees, which resemble a hog, armadilloes, guanoes, which are of the alligator kind, Indian conies; and badgers, horses, cows, asses, sheep, deer, goats, and rabbits. No island in the world, we are told, can boast such a variety of fishes, both shell and others, particularly turtle and mullets, of a most delicious taste. Of the feathered species, there are also a great variety. Lastly, in different parts of the island are found green tar, soap-earth, with many curious shells, stones, marcasites, and minerals.</P>
<P>There were not only some natives, but also some Europeans settled upon this island, when it was by the last treaty of peace yielded up to Great-Britain.—Gwyne, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> is the lieutenant-governor.</P>

<HEAD>GRENADA, and the GRENADINES.</HEAD>
<P>Grenada lies in west longitude 61°. 40′. and north latitude 12°. thirty leagues north of New-Anda∣lusia, on the continent of Terra-Firma. It is said to be about thirty leagues in length, and in some
<PB N="494" REF="4950"/>
places fifteen in breadth. Near it is a cluster of small islands, called the Grenadines. These islands produce very fine timber, sugar, indigo, tobacco, pease, and millet; but the cocoa-tree does not thrive so well in them as in the other islands. There is a lake in a mountain about the middle of the island, that supplies it with fresh-water streams, and several bays and harbours lie round it, that might be fortified to great advantage; so that it is very convenient for shipping, not being subject to hurricanes.</P>
<P>The chief port is called Lewis, which stands on the middle of a large bay, with a sandy bottom. There were some French settlements upon this island, when it was reduced by the English in the late war. Brigadier-general Robert Melville is governor-general of Grenada, the Grenadines, St. Vincent, Dominica, and Tobago; and Francis Gore, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> is lieutenant-general and lieutenant-go∣vernor of Grenada.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>CUBA.</HEAD>
<P>CUBA extends in latitude from 20°. 20′. to the tropic of Cancer, and from 74°. to 85°. 15′. west longitude, being about six hundred and sixty miles in length, from east to west, but very narrow in proportion; for, in some parts, it is not above twelve or fourteen leagues, and, at most, but one hundred and twenty miles in breadth. It lies sixty miles to the west of Hispaniola, twenty-five
<PB N="495" REF="4960"/>
leagues to the north of Jamaica, one hundred miles to the east of Jucatan, as many to the south of Cape Florida, and commands the entrance of both the gulphs of Mexico and Florida, and the Windward Passage; so that the Spaniards, who are the only possessors of it, may, with a tolerable fleet, not only secure their own trade, but annoy their neighbours.</P>
<P>There are no winters in this island; but in July and August, when the sun is vertical, the rains and storms are great, otherwise the country would be in∣tolerably hot. The fairest season is when the sun is furthest off, and then it is hottest in the morning; for towards noon a sea-breeze springs up, which blows pretty brisk till the evening. The trade∣winds in these seas blow from the north-east. At the full and change of the moon, from October to April, there are brisk winds at north and north-west, which in December and January often turn to storms, though this is called the fair season. It is finely watered, and agreeably diversified with woods, lawns, and valleys. The soil is capable of producing, in the greatest plenty, every thing that we have mentioned to grow in other American islands; but the Cuba (commonly called the Ha∣vannah) tobacco is thought to excel that of all the world. The pine apples here are excellent, and their sugars would equal their tobacco in goodness, had they hands to cultivate their canes. The other products are, ginger, long pepper, and other spices; cassia, mastic, aloes, large cedars, and other oderi∣ferous trees; oaks, pines, palm-trees, plenty of large vines, fine cotton-trees, plantains, bananas, ananas, guavas, lemons, cocoas, and two sorts of fruit, called camilor and guanavana; the first like a china-orange, and the other in the shape of a heart, with a juice between sweet and acid. The copper mines here furnish the Spanish plantations with a
<PB N="496" REF="4970"/>
sufficiency of that metal for all their brass guns. Gold dust is sound in the sands of the rivers; but it is uncertain whether there are any gold or silver mines, the hopes of which occasioned the butchery of all the antient inhabitants, who were either un∣able or unwilling to discover them: if there are any, they are not worked. A chain of hills runs through the middle of the island; but the land near the coast is generally a level, champaign country. The interior parts lie quite uncultivated and unin∣habited; and it hath been observed, that the island contains more churches than farms more priests than planters, and more lazy bigots than useful la∣bourers.</P>
<P>Cuba has many good ports and harbours, which are of great advantage to ships for passing the gulph in safety; but there are scarce any naviga∣ble rivers. Both the coasts and rivers abound with fish, and also with alligators. There are great conveniences for making salt; but the inhabitants avail themselves very little of them. The cattle brought hither by the Spaniards have multiplied ex∣ceedingly, vast numbers now running wild in the woods, of which many are killed chiefly for their hides and tallow, that are sent to Spain. Their flesh also, being cut into pieces and dried in the sun, serves to victual ships. These cattle are often so fat, that they die through the burthen of their grease. Cuba has likewise abundance of mules, horses, sheep, wild boars, and hogs, together with wild and tame fowl, parrots, partridges, blue heads, large tortoises, quarries of flint, and several fountains of bitumen, which is used instead of pitch, as well as for medicinal purposes. Upon the whole, the island is pleasant, and its present state flourish∣ing, the Spaniards having every year for a consi∣derable time past, particularly since the taking of the Havannah, added something to its improve∣ment.
<PB N="497" REF="4980"/>
Formerly its exportations never equalled those of the small British island of Antigua. The reason of this, next to the indolence of the Spa∣niards, was the great facility with which the inha∣bitants make their money, by means of the galleons and the flota, and the very great contraband trade that is carried on here, in defiance of their laws and regulations, and even with the connivance of the government of the island.</P>
<P>It is divided into seven provinces, the civil government of which is dependent on that of St. Domingo, or Hispaniola; and as to spiritu∣als, its bishop, whose see is at St. Jago, though he commonly resides at the Havannah, is suffragan to the archbishop of St. Domingo. The east part of the island is said to be under the governor of St. Jago, and the west of the governor of the Ha∣vannah. There are many considerable towns in the island, but the two just mentioned are the chief.</P>
<P>St. Jago, which still retains the name of the ca∣pital, though now much inferior to the Havannah, stands at the bottom of a large bay, about two leagues from the sea, on the south-east side of the island. It is distinguished from St. Jago in Chili by the addition of di Cuba, as the other is by that of di Chili. Since the unsuccessful attempt made by the English under admiral Vernon and general Wentworth, the fortifications have been repaired, and the town hath recovered some degree of its former lustre, carrying on a good trade with Old and New Spain, and above all with the Canaries.</P>
<P>The Havannah stands on the north-west coast of the island, fifty leagues from Cape St. Antonio, its westernmost point; four hundred and ninety miles west from St. Jago; forty one leagues south of the Cape of Florida, the gulph of which it com∣mands, by being situated at its mouth; and two
<PB N="498" REF="4990"/>
days sail from the Straits of Bahama. The town itself, distinct from the fortifications, is about two miles in circuit, and contains about twenty-six thousand souls. Though the port is one of the finest and most secure in the world within; yet the narrowness of its passage has rendered it so difficult of access, that the galleons have been often insult∣ed and taken within sight of it, without receiving any assistance from the fortifications. The churches here are inconceivably magnificent, and rich, in plate and ornaments; the streets clean and streight, but narrow; and the houses are of stone, and make a good appearance, but are ill furnished. The inhabitants, in general, are said to be more sociable and conversible than those of the other Spanish dominions in America. The city, which is one of the richest in America, especially when the galleons are here, stands in the most fruitful part of the island on the west side, along the shore, which rounds so much that above half of it is washed by the sea, and the rest by two branches of the river La∣gida. There is a fine square, with uniform build∣ings in the middle of it. This city is of the great∣est importance to the Spaniards of all the cities in America, being the place of rendezvous for all their fleets, in their return from that quarter of the world to Spain, and lying at the mouth of the gulph of Florida, through which they are all obliged to pass. The Spaniards, therefore, not without reason, call it the Key of all the West-Indies, to lock or open the door or entrance thereto; and indeed no ships can pass that way without leave from this port. Here is always a squadron of Spanish men of war; and here, in Septem∣ber, meet the galleons, flota, and other ships, from several ports, both of the continent and islands, to the number of perhaps fifty or sixty sail, to take
<PB N="499" REF="5000"/>
in provisions and water, with great part of their lading, and for the convenience of returning to Spain in a body. A continual fair is kept till their departure, which is generally before the end of the month; when a proclamation is made, forbidding any that belong to the fleet to stay in the town, on pain of death, and, upon firing a warning gun, they all go on board. The value of the cargo is seldom less than seven millions sterling; so that it may well be imagined, a place of such import∣ance is in a condition both to defend itself, and to protect the ships that frequent it. Towards the close of the late war, this city, after a long and obstinate defence, was surrendered, with all its forts and dependencies, to his Britannic majesty's arms, by capitulation, on the 12th of August 1762; but was restored by the peace. The Spaniards have been busy, since that time, in repairing the da∣mages which the fortifications received during the siege, and adding new ones, besides taking every other precaution to secure it, for the future, from all attempts of an enemy.</P>
<P>Two leagues from the Havannah by land, but little more than a league by sea, lies the town of Guan Abacoa.</P>
<P>The other towns in the island worth mentioning are, Santa Cruz, which has a tolerable harbour, and stands about one hundred and sixty-three miles east of the Havannah; Porto del Principe, situated on the coast, about three hundred miles south-east of the Havannah; and Baracoa, situated on the north-east part of the island, and having a small harbour.</P>

<HEAD>HISPANIOLA, or ST. DOMINGO.</HEAD>
<P>Hispaniola or St. Domingo, is the largest next to Cuba of all the Antilles. It is situated fifty miles east of Cuba, and seventyof Jamaica, and is about four hundred and twenty miles long, from east to west, and a hundred and twenty broad, from north to south.</P>
<P>Though the climate is hot, yet it is not reckon∣ed unwholesome, being refreshed by breezes and rains. It is allowed to be both the most fruitful and pleasantest island in the West Indies, being di∣versified with hills and vallies, woods and rivers, producing ananas, bananas, grapes, oranges, le∣mons, citrons, toronias, limes, dates, and apri∣cots, fairer and better tasted than those of the other islands, together with whole forests of cab∣bage trees, elms, oaks, pines, acajou, and other trees, large and lofty. The other commodities are sugar, hides, indigo, cotton, cocoa, coffee, ginger, tobacco, salt, wax, honey, amber-grease, and va∣rious kinds of drugs and dying woods. Croco∣diles and alligators infest its coasts and rivers; but they abound at the same time with tortoises. The horses and herds of cattle here are said to be innumerable, and sufficient to supply most of the neighbouring colonies.</P>
<P>The island is possessed partly by the French, and partly by the Spaniards, the former being set∣tled in the north-west part, and the latter in the south: but the French have improved their set∣tlements to such a degree, and are grown so pow∣erful, that they may make themselves masters of the whole island, whenever they please. Upon the whole, however, the population of this island bears no proportion to the extent of it. The profits the French make from its products are
<PB N="501" REF="5020"/>
immense; and, according to some authors, in sugar, indigo, tobacco, and coffee, thirty years ago, their exports amounted to about one million two hundred thousand pounds sterling annually. During the last war, their exports, as appeared from the prodigious value of the ships that were taken, must have considerably exceeded that sum; and since the peace of 1763, nothing has been wanting on the part of the French, to render their settlement on St. Domingo a counterbalance for all the ces∣sions which they were obliged to make to the English by that treaty. In this they are greatly assisted by the Spaniards themselves, who, possessed of great treasures, but without industry, lavish the former to purchase from their French neigh∣bours the returns of the latter.</P>
<P>This island was the first of the Spaniards disco∣veries, and for some time the center of their commerce in America. After their conquests in Peru they slighted it, the gold found here being nothing in comparison to what they met with in that kingdom. The Buccaneers and other adven∣turers came hither afterwards, to hunt the cattle the Spaniards had imported, which were grown wild, and killed incredible numbers of them for their hides and tallow; and here they also used to victual their ships. The French, finding the island almost deserted, took possession of the north-west part of it, which they still possess; whereupon the Spaniards returned and settled, in the south part of the island again, to prevent other nations seizing that, and interrupting their navigation to the continent.</P>
<P>It is said, the consideration that chiefly induced the court of England to restore the islands of Guadaloupe and Martinico to the French by the late definitive treaty, was, that most of the inhabitants of those islands, would in that case
<PB N="502" REF="5030"/>
have removed to Hispaniola, and there, in a short time, raised more sugar than both of them pro∣duced. The French in this island were lately in arms against their governors; but as to the cause, we have no information that can be depended on.</P>
<P>The principal places belonging to the Spaniards in the island are St. Domingo, Conception de la Vega, St. Jago de los Cavalieros, Monte Chris∣to, and Porto de la Plata.</P>
<P>St. Domingo, the capital, is a large well built city, situate on a spacious harbour on the south side of the island, containing about thirty thousand in∣habitants, and defended by a castle and other works. Here is an university and a college, with a revenue of four thousand ducats, a Latin school, several con∣vents, a magnificent cathedral, an hospital, having a revenue of twenty thousand ducats, and a fine market-place in the center of the city. St. Domin∣go is also the residence of the governor-general of the Spanish Indies, and of an archbishop, and court of royal audience. The archbishop's suf∣fragans are the bishops of Conception in this island, St. John's in Porto Rico, St. Jago in Cuba, Ven∣zuela in New Castile, and of the city of Hon∣duras. The jurisdiction of the court of Royal Audience extends to all the Spanish West-Indian islands. In short, this city owes its present support to the lawyers and clergymen, whose professions oblige them to reside in it. A fine navigable river falls into the sea a little to the west of it.</P>
<P>Conception is a considerable town, and the see of a bishop, twenty leagues north of St. Domingo. St. Jago de los Cavalieros lies ten leagues north-west of Conception, and enjoys a fine air. Porto la Plata, or the Haven of Silver, stands on an arm of the sea, thirty five leagues north of St. Domingo, and Monto Christo, at the mouth of the river Ya∣guey, ten miles west of Porta de la Plata, and forty north-west from St. Domingo.</P>
<P><PB N="503" REF="5040"/>
The chief towns belonging to the French are Cape François, St. Lewis, Port Paix, Petit Guaves, and Leogane.</P>
<P>Cape St. François, situate on the north side of the island, is in a flourishing opulent condition, having a fine harbour, a brisk trade, and about eight thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>St. Lewis, or Port Lewis, stands on a small island on the south-west coast of the island, and has a good harbour with a fort, but labours un∣der a scarcity of fresh water.</P>
<P>Port Paix is a place of considerable strength, ly∣ing opposite the island of Tortuga, on the north-west coast of the island.</P>
<P>Petit Guaves, and Leogane, stand on Donna Maria Bay near Cape St. Nicholas, at the west end of the island. The former is the oldest French settlement in the island, and a place of considerable trade; and the latter is the residence of the French governor-general, and of the royal judicature, with that of the supreme council, whose jurisdiction ex∣tends from Cape Mougon to the river Artibonite.</P>
<P>There are two other small places belonging to the French called La Petite Riviere, and L'Esterre, the latter of which stands a little within land.</P>
<P>The island of Tortuga, mentioned above, had its name from the turtles with which it formerly abound∣ed. It is about six leagues long from east to west, and three where broadest. The French have a popu∣lous flourishing settlement, called Cayona, with a har∣bour in the south part of the island. It yields all the commodities found in the other West-Indian islands, together with wild boars; but has little or no fresh water. Of the other islands on this coast, the chief are Savona, and Mona, belong∣ing to the Spaniards. Hispaniola is separated from Cuba and Jamaica by what is called the Wind∣ward-passage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<PB N="504" REF="5050"/>
<HEAD>PORTO-RICO.</HEAD>
<P>Porto-Rico is parted from Hispaniola by a narrow channel, being about a hundred and twenty miles long, and sixty broad. The air here is ex∣cessive hot and unwholesome, especially during the rainy season. The island is also said to be subject to great droughts and hurricanes, and much ex∣posed to the descents of privateers. The princi∣pal commodities in which the inhabitants deal are sugar, ginger, hides, cotton thread, and raw cot∣ton, cassia, mastic, &amp;c. Their pork is excellent, and so is the flesh of their kids, but their mutton is poor dry food. They have good ship-timber, and fruit-trees, with rice and Indian corn. A num∣ber of brooks and rivers descend from the moun∣tains, which run from east to west, and are planted with woods.</P>
<P>The north part of the island, which is the most barren, is said to contain various mines, some of them of silver and gold; but it does not appear that any of them are worked, though it is con∣fidently affirmed, that gold-dust is often found in the sands of the rivers. The woods are stored with parrots, wild pidgeons, and other fowl. Eu∣ropean poultry is found here in plenty, and their coasts abound with fish. A breed of dogs, that the Spaniards brought over to hunt and tear in pieces the defenceless natives, are said to run wild in the woods near the sea-shore, and subsist upon land-crabs, that burrow in the ground.</P>
<P>This island was conquered by the earl of Cum∣berland, at his own expence, in the reign of queen Elizabeth; but he was obliged to abandon it again, having lost most of his men by sickness in the lat∣ter end of the summer, when this and all other places in these latitudes are very unhealthy.</P>
<P>Infinite pains have been taken by the Spanish government to prevent an illicit trade at this place;
<PB N="505" REF="5060"/>
but such is the convenience of its situation for that traffic, that all the severe edicts issued against it have been ineffectual.</P>
<P>The capital of the island is St. John's, situated on a small island on the north coast, within the harbour, which the Spaniards called Porto-Rico, from the treasures they found there. It is well built and populous, and the seat of a governor, as well as a bishop's see. Both the town and the entrance of the harbour are strongly fortified. The former is also joined to the Main Island by a cause∣way.</P>
<P>The other places in Porto Rico worth mention∣ing, are Port del Agnada, where the flota provide themselves with water, and other necessaries, in their voyage to Spain; and Boraba d'Inferno, famous for an excellent turtle fishery. A small island on this coast, is called Crabs-Island, from the great num∣ber of crabs found there.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>TRINIDAD.</HEAD>
<P>Trinidad is separated from the continent of An∣dalusia, in Terra Firma, by the narrow strait of Boco del Drago, eighty miles north-west of the river Oronoque. This island is the largest on the coast, being about twenty-five leagues in length, and twenty in breadth. The air is said to be un∣wholesome, but the soil fruitful, producing sugar, tobacco, indigo, cotton, ginger, and Indian corn. The number of inhabitants is very small, in pro∣portion to the extent of the island.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MARGARITA.</HEAD>
<P>Margarita, situate two hundred miles west of Trinidad, is about thirty five miles in compass. It abounds with verdant groves and pastures, fruits, and Indian corn, and was formerly highly prized
<PB N="506" REF="5070"/>
for its pearl fishery; but the rapaciousness of the Spaniards hath since destroyed that fishery; nor do pearls bear the same price now as when America was first discovered. The greatest inconveniency of the island is the want of fresh water. Since the year 1620, when the Dutch invaded the island and demolished the castle, it hath been abandoned by the natives.</P>
<P>There are many more small islands in these seas belonging to the Spaniards, such as the Gol∣den Island, Isle of Pines, the Samballas Islands, the Bastimentos, and Sotoventos, on the coast of Terra Firma, besides those in the South Sea.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The FRENCH WEST-INDIAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MARTINICO.</HEAD>
<P>MARTINICO, the most considerable of the French West-Indian islands, is situated a hundred and twenty miles north-west of Barba∣does, between the fourteenth and fifteenth degree of north latitude, being about sixty miles long, but scarce twenty broad in any place.</P>
<P>The inland part is mountainous, and many ri∣vulets fall from thence into the surrounding sea; and there are several safe and commodious har∣bours, all well fortified, with good roads for ship∣ping. The produce of the island consists of sugar, tobacco, cotton, ginger, indigo, cacao, aloes, pimento, cocoes, plantains, and other tropical fruits. The coasts abound with turtles; but the French are not so expert in fishing for them as the English.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="5080"/>
Though Martinico is generally said to be health∣ful for those that are settled upon it, yet it is certain that the vast quantity of water, which runs through it, creates a humidity which is very nox∣ious to the constitution of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the year 1700, the French settled upon the island of Martinico were computed to be fifteen hundred, besides the negroes whom they em∣ployed, and great numbers of Caribbeans, who were readmitted into the island, but were obliged to work as slaves, and to live among the French, that they might have no opportunity to form con∣spiracies and plots with their countrymen, or to associate together. Before it was subdued by the English in the last war, it could raise ten thousand white inhabitants, fit to carry arms, and above forty thousand negroes or slaves. Besides this force, some companies of regulars were always quartered in the island; so that nothing but the most notorious misconduct could have rendered the British troops masters of it with so little loss as they suffered on that occasion.</P>
<P>Martinico is not only the residence of the go∣vernor-general and intendant, but likewise of a sovereign council, which superintends all their other islands, and even the settlements on St. Do∣mingo and Tortuga. The governor-general is commonly a man of quality; and both he and the intendant, and the lieutenant-governor, are paid out of the finances of Old France. The governor of Martinico as well as Guadaloupe is paid in sugar, as, indeed, are all the other officers of the island, excepting some inconsiderable sums, that issue from the treasury of Old France. The hundred weight of sugar is rated at four livres ten sols. The go∣vernors are allowed sixty thousand pounds weight, with a pension of one thousand crowns paid in Old France. The lieutenant-governors have twenty
<PB N="508" REF="5090"/>
thousand pounds weight, and five thousand livres salary. The king's judges, attornies, and other officers, have each an allowance of six thousand weight; but the counsellors of the sovereign's council have no more than twelve hundred weight, or twelve of their negroes exempted from the ca∣pitation tax. This is a tax paid by the white men and the free negroes, who are hired servants, and consists of a hundred weight of coarse sugar a year, for each domestic or negroe, who is em∣ployed in manufacturing it; and of six livres for every other. All provisions imported into the island are subject to a duty of one per cent. in specie; and the third of all forfeitures and fines goes to the crown. Martinico owes its flourishing state to the French government having transported thither, by way of punishment, great numbers of its protestant subjects, some of whom voluntarily settled there.</P>
<P>The most considerable places in the island are St. Pierre, or St. Peter's, Fort Royal, and Trinity-town.</P>
<P>St. Pierre was built in 1665, and is a handsome town, extending along the shore, and washed by a river on each side. There is a strong fort, besides several batteries, and other works, that command both the town and road, the former of which is also walled.</P>
<P>Fort Royal lies at the distance of seven leagues by land, and nine by water from St. Pierre. It is also well fortified; but is otherwise far inferior to St. Pierre.</P>
<P>Trinity-Town is a flourishing settlement at the bottom of Trinity-Bay.</P>
<P>The harbour or bay called Cul de Sac Robert, is a very fine and safe one, being two leagues deep, and having water enough for the largest ship, with two islands at its entrance to break the force of the waves.</P>
<P><PB N="509" REF="5100"/>
The French first began to settle on this island about the year 1637.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>GUADALUPE.</HEAD>
<P>Guadalupe, so named by Columbus from its resembling those of that name in Spain, is situate in 16°. north latutude, thirty leagues north-west from Martinico. It is said to be near an hundred leagues in compass, but is cut in two by a deep gulph, or bay, on each side, and a channel called the Salt River.</P>
<P>The air of Guadalupe is preferable to that of Martinico, being more salubrious, and less sultry. Its products are sugar, coffee, cotton, bastard cin∣namon, indigo, ginger, and many other vegetables, particularly the copau-tree, from which is extracted a most excellent balsam; the milk shrub, so called from its yielding a substance like milk, when pressed, which falls little short of the capau bal∣sam; the moubane-tree, which bears a yellow plum, with which the natives fatten their hogs; and the corbary-tree, the gum of which, when hardened in the sun, becomes so translucent, that the Caribbeans wear it formed into beads and bracelets. Many of the mountains with which Gua∣dalupe abounds, are covered with wood; and no∣thing can be more verdant, or more beautifully variegated than the large fruitful plains, which lie at the bottom.</P>
<P>One of the mountains is said to emit a continual smoke, and to communicate a sulphureous taste to the neighbouring streams.</P>
<P>Such is the fertility of Guadalupe, that it hath been asserted, that if it was as well peopled, and cul∣tivated as Barbadoes, it would yield sugar enough for all Europe. One hundered thousand hogs∣heads, we are told, were exported yearly from it before the last war, when it was reduced by the English. The most remarkable bird upon the island
<PB N="510" REF="5110"/>
is that called the Devil, which is peculiar to this island and Dominica: it is a bird of passage, of the size of a pullet, and all its plumage coal black: it lives on fish, which it catches in the sea at night, being unable to bear the light in the day∣time, when flying; so that they often run against interposing objects, and fall down. After their fish-hunting in the night, they repair to a moun∣tain, called the Devil's Mountain, where they lodge by pairs in holes, like rabbits. Their flesh is good nourishing food, though of a fishy taste.</P>
<P>The island is pestered with an insect called a ravet, shaped like a cock-chafer, of a stinking smell, and preying upon books and furniture; and whatever they do not gnaw, is discoloured by their ordure: but great numbers of them are destroyed by a kind of spiders, some of which are as big as a man's fist. The bees of Guadaloupe are very different from those of Europe, being black, smaller, and without stings. These bees, instead of making combs, lay their honey in bladders of wax, about the form and size of a pidgeon's egg. The only use that is made of their wax, which is of a dark purple colour, is to secure the corks of bottles: the honey is never of a thicker consist∣ence than that of olive oil.</P>
<P>The Cul de Sacs, as the French call them, or gulphs about this island, abound with turtle, sharks, land crabs, and various other fishes.</P>
<P>One of the two divisions of the island is called Grande-Terre; and the other is divided into Capes Terre, or Cabes Terre, and Basse-Terre, which last is also the name of the capital, a considerable town, situated on both sides of Bailiff River, and well fortified.</P>
<P>This island, as well as Martinico, was reduced by the British arms in the late war; but restored by the definitive treaty of peace. The French first began to send colonies to it about the year 1632.</P>
<P><PB N="511" REF="5120"/>
Several small islands lie about it, three of which are called the Santos Xaintes, or All-Saints Islands; one the Aves, or Bird Island.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>MARIGALANTE.</HEAD>
<P>Marigalante, lying a little to the south-east of Guadaloupe, is about five leagues in length; and four in breadth. It was discovered by Columbus in his second voyage to America, anno 1493; and named by him Marigalante, or the Gallant Mary, after the name of his ship. This island abounds with tobacco, cinnamon-trees, and other products of the Caribbee Islands; and contains a great many grottos, where large crabs are found; as also several rivers, and ponds of fresh water. Along the eastern shore run high perpendicular rocks, which give shelter to vast numbers of tro∣pical birds, they being as full of holes as a pidgeon∣house.</P>
<P>Before the last reduction of it by the British arms, it manufactured about one thousand hogsheads of sugar yearly. The French began to send colonies about the year 1647.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>ST. LUCIA.</HEAD>
<P>St. Lucia, one of the islands formerly call∣ed Neutral, but by the last definitive treaty of peace, ceded in full right to France, lies two miles south of Martinico, and is about twenty-two miles in length; and eleven in breadth. It is said to be much the finest and most convenient of any of the Caribbee Islands, being diversified with hills and vallies, well watered, and furnished with excel∣lent harbours. The land is rich; but a great part of it is covered with woods, which abound in wild fowl, and yield great quantities of excellent tim∣ber. The neighbouring sea is well stored with fish.</P>
<P>There are three other small islands belonging to the French in these seas, viz. St. Martin, St. Bartho∣lomew
<PB N="512" REF="5130"/>
and Deseada, or Desiderada, i. e. the De∣sirable Island. St. Martin lies a little to the north-west of St. Bartholomew, which is ten leagues north of St. Christopher's. Deseada, situate about twenty miles from Guadaloupe, is said to produce the best cotton of any of the French Islands. It had its name from Columbus, being the first land he discovered in his second voyage to America, anno 1493. St. Martin is of no consequence; but St. Bartholomew's, tho' encompassed with for∣midable rocks, yet produces tobacco and cassava, with some excellent woods, and lime-stone.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DUTCH WEST-INDIA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dutch West-India Islands are St. Eu∣statia, Saba, Curassao, Bonaire, and Aruba. The two first are Caribbee Islands; but the three last lie off the coast of Terra-Firma. St. Eusta∣tia, situate three leagues north-west of St. Christo∣pher's, is a very well cultivated island, about three leagues in compass. Besides tobacco, the inhabi∣tants have of late years raised and exported great quantities of sugar. They also breed hogs, rabbits, goats, and all sorts of poultry. The air is whole∣some, but it is subject to terrible thunder-claps, earthquakes, and hurricanes; and there is a scar∣city of fresh-water. Before a hurricane, it is said, the birds lay themselves flat on the ground: the rain that precedes it, is always salt and bitter.</P>
<P>This island is reckoned the strongest of all the Caribbee Islands, there being but one landing place, which is commanded by a fort, and may be easily defended by a few men. The Dutch first took
<PB N="513" REF="5140"/>
possession of it in 1635; and since the treaty of Ryswick, have remained in quiet possession of it.</P>
<P>Saba is a small pleasant island, thirteen miles north-west of Eustatia. The sea is so shallow a∣bout it, that none but but sloops can come near it; nor even they, but at a small creek on the south side of the island. Most of the inhabitants are said to be shoe-makers, or dealers in shoes. There is a de∣lightful valley in the island, which produces neces∣saries for the inhabitants, with some indigo and cotton.</P>
<P>Curassao, or Curacoa, is about nine or ten leagues in length, and five in breadth; lying in 12°. 14′. north latitude; nine or ten leagues from the coast of Terra-Firma.</P>
<P>The climate is neither wholesome, nor agreea∣ble, nor the soil fruitful; yet the island is popu∣lous, and the industry of the inhabitants such, that it produces a great deal of sugar and tobacco. It is well supplied with provisions, and all other commodities from Europe, and the other Dutch settlements, in which it carries on a very lucrative and extensive contraband trade with the Spaniards in Terra-Firma. Let the Spanish governors pro∣hibit this trade never so severely, the Spaniards stand so much in need of European commodities, that they will run all hazards to obtain them. The chief town and harbour is about three leagues from the south-east end of the island. The town, for its size, is one of the fairest and finest in America, and contains every thing necessary to render it commodious and agreeable, as far as the climate and soil will permit. The other Dutch islands of Bonacre and Aruba are considerable, chiefly (which is also the case of Curassao) for their situa∣tion near the coast of Terra-Firma, which gives the inhabitants an opportunity of carrying on a
<PB N="514" REF="5150"/>
ciandestine trade with the Spanish settlements in Terra-Firma. On the south side of Bonacre is a good salt-pond, whither the Dutch sloops come for salt, which is now become a very considerable commodity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DANISH ISLANDS. ST. THOMAS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Danes are possessed of the island of St. Thomas, the chief of the Virgin Islands, which lie to the east of Porto-Rico. It has a safe, strong, and commodious harbour, which, by being open to traders of all nations, enriches the inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>The island also naturally produces most of the West Indian commodities; but is much infested with muskettoes. St. Croix, or Santa Cruz, a small island, about twenty leagues west of St. Christopher's, is under the protection of the king of Denmark; but mostly the property of some Irish gentlemen. The soil is said to be rich, producing many excel∣lent dying and other woods, proper for house and ship-building, together with oranges, citrons, granates, lemons, the mandioca root, and the papau∣tree, the fruit of which makes a most excellent sweet-meat.</P>
<P>Among the many uninhabited islands in these seas are, Anigada, Sombrero, Salt Tortuga, and Blanco.</P>
<P>The first of these is fifty miles north-west of Anguilla, and the second thirty. They both a∣bound with birds, particularly the colubri or hum∣ming-bird, of which Laet's description here differs
<PB N="515" REF="5160"/>
from that given of it elsewhere. He says, it is not much bigger than a wren, yet flies much swift∣er than any other birds, with a noise like a whirl-wind. It has feathers of all the colours in the rain∣bow, but the ends are of a golden colour, as is also the belly; its sides are of an emerald green; the neck has a circle as red as a carbuncle; the bill and legs are black as jet; its eyes like diamonds; and there is a green tuft of feathers on its crown. They live on the juice of flowers, especially those of the cotton tree, smell like amber, and build their nests, which are curiously lined with cotton down and silk, among the thick leaves of the boughs.</P>
<P>There are also painted crabs here, which are said to be very good meat. Some of them have vio∣let-coloured shells; others yellow, full of purple specks; and others tawny, with red streaks. They creep down the hills in May, consuming all the herb∣age in their way, and after going four times to the water to wash themselves, retire to the woods; but at a certain season, the females take to the sea, and there lay their eggs, which being afterwards cast ashore, and warmed by the sun, produce young ones, that creep to the woods, and as they grow bigger climb up the rocks, where the old ones keep together in vast multitudes, and so stop up the holes that they cannot be found out. They creep out of their shells through an opening at the tail, which is scarce discernible, and thus lie bare and stripped of their shells, being only covered with a thin skin, which at last grows as firm as that they left.</P>
<P>Salt Tortuga is a barren, rugged, uninhabited island, situated north-west from Margarita, in the latitude of 10°. 35′. north, and so named to distin∣guish it from the other turtle islands on the coast of America, on account of a large salt pond at the east end of it, within two hundred paces of the sea,
<PB N="516" REF="5170"/>
where merchant-ships take in ladings of salt. There is a small harbour in the island.</P>
<P>The island of Blanco lies north of Margarita, in 10°. 15′. north latitude; but is remarkable on∣ly for its turtle fishery.</P>
<P>The Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, are twelve in number. They are said to be in ge∣neral small, barren, and inhospitable; but whe∣ther any of them, besides St. Thomas, are inhabit∣ed, and by whom, we are not told.</P>

<P>THE Bahama Islands, belonging to Great-Britain, are situated in the Atlantic Ocean, to the north of the island of Cuba, and not far from the coast of Florida, stretching from the north-west to the south-east, between 21 and 27°. of north latitude. They are very numerous, and twelve of them pretty large.</P>
<P>Bahama, which is the largest, being about fifty miles in length, though very narrow, and gives name to the rest, lies twenty-five leagues from the continent of Florida. It enjoys a serene temperate air, with a fruitful soil, well watered every where with springs and rivulets.</P>
<P>Though these were the first lands discovered in America by Columbus the Spaniards never thought of settling in them. The English knew nothing of them till 16<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7, when Capt. William Sayle, being bound to Carolina, was forced among them by a storm, which gave him an opportunity of ex∣amining them carefully, particularly that which at present is known by the name of Providence. At
<PB N="517" REF="5180"/>
his return, he reported the benefit they might be of to the state; upon which, grants of them were made out to proprietors; but the government was reserved in the hands of the crown. None of them, however, are yet settled, except Providence, Lucays, and Harbour Island; which seems sur∣prizing, as they would certainly prove of the great∣est advantage to Great-Britain, if properly culti∣vated.</P>
<P>The Straits of Bahama, which the British fleet so happily cleared in the last expedition against the Havannah, are well known to navigators, for the dangers and difficulties that attend the passing them.</P>
<P>These islands lying near to Hispaniola, and to the noted port of the Havannah, in the island of Cuba, where the Spanish galleons and flota always rendezvous before they return to Europe, having the Gulph of Florida to the west, and the Wind∣ward Passage to the east of them, in time of peace they are capable of great improvement in point of trade, and have always been a good retreat for dis∣abled ships, blown from different parts of the con∣tinent of America. In time of war, the British cruizers and privateers stationed at the Bahama Islands, are more capable to obstruct and annoy the Spanish trade, homeward-bound, than any that are stationed at the rest of the British colonies in Ame∣rica. Accordingly, New-Providence, which is a very thriving colony, was of great benefit to the British trade in the late war. The chief town of the island is called Nassau.</P>
<P>Many of these islands, through the dangers at∣tending the navigation to them, are so little known, that it is uncertain whether they are inhabited or not. They are supposed to amount altogether to near five hundred; but many of them are only barren rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="518" REF="5190"/>
Of the fishes found on the coast, not a few are said to be poisonous, or at least unwholesome—Shirley, <ABBR>esq</ABBR> is the present governor of the Bahamas.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The BERMUDAS, or SUMMER ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Bermudas, or Summer Islands, are a cluster of islands lying in the Atlantic Ocean, in 32°. 20′. north latitude, about seven or eight hundred miles east from Cape Hatoras, in South-Carolina, which is the nearest land to them. They are said to be about four hundred in number, but most of them so small and barren as not to be habitable. How they got the name of Bermudas is uncertain; but the other is a corruption of Sommers, from Sir George Sommers, who was shipwrecked on them in 1609. No part of the world enjoys a clearer air or a more temperate climate, or is better furnished with plenty of flesh, fish, poultry, fruits, herbs, and roots. However, we are told by some late vovage-writers, that both the air and soil of these islands have undergone a most surprizing al∣teration for the worse, since they were first disco∣vered.</P>
<P>Formerly the Bermudas abounded with fine ce∣dars, of which there are still considerable remains, that serve for building of sloops, with the assistance of the New England white pine. Ambergrease is often found, and whales caught on this coast; and the turtle-fishing trade is of great service for the sub∣sistence of the inhabitants. The governor, it is said, has ten pounds for every whale that is caught. There is a breed of black hogs here, that are thought to have been left by the Spaniards; and a white chalk stone, which is easily chisselled, and exported for building gentlemen's houses in the West-Indies. Some tobacco is raised in these
<PB N="519" REF="5200"/>
islands, and they abound in excellent oranges and palmetto trees; but the water, except what falls from the clouds, and is preserved in cisterns, is brackish.</P>
<P>The chief island is St. George, which is not a∣bove sixteen miles in length, and three, at most, in breadth. There are three clergymen in the island, who have a handsome provision: and Dr. Bark∣ley, late bishop of Cloyne, proposed the erecting a college here, for the education of the Indians; but the design miscarried. The island takes its name from the chief town.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>NEWFOUNDLAND.</HEAD>
<P>Newfoundland is of a triangular form, and a∣bout as big as Ireland, being two hundred and eighty miles in length from north to south, and nine hundred and thirty in circumference. There is no coast in the world better accommodated with harbours all round. Those on the east and south coasts are best known, namely Bonavista, Trinity, Capelin, and Conception bays, Torbay, St. John's, Harbour, the Bay of Bulls, Fresh Water Bay, those of Bilcay, St. Mary, Placentia, Bay of Fortune, or St. Peter's, and the Bay of Despair; but the most famous and considerable is the Bay of Placentia. On the north the island is separated from Terra de Labrador, or New Britain, by the Strait of Belleisle, which runs N. E. and is about twenty-eight miles over in its narrowest part; on the west it has the Gulph of St. Lawrence, and on the south and east the Atlantic Ocean. The most western point is called Cape Rye, and the most southerly Cape Race, or Raz.</P>
<P>With respect to the climate of Newfoundland, it is intensely hot in summer, and insupportably cold in winter, from the very situation, and a variety of
<PB N="520" REF="5210"/>
natural causes. For four or five months in the winter the ground is covered with snow, frozen as hard as crystal. The southern and eastern coasts seldom enjoy a very serene sky, from their neigh∣bourhood to the Great Bank, which is almost con∣stantly covered with a thick fog; but in the north∣ern and western parts the sky is very clear, both in summer and winter.</P>
<P>With respect to the soil, it is in general a very barren country, full of bleak mountains and naked rocks. Most of the meadows and vales produce nothing but a kind of moss. Many species of timber, however, grow here in the utmost perfec∣tion, and the firs are as fit for masts as those of Nor∣way. There are said also to be some fruitful spots in it, and a kind of rye which grows naturally with out culture, and is very nourishing, with wild strawberries, and raspberrses. The island abounds with wild fowl, and with deer, hares, rabbits, foxes, squirrels, bears, beavers, wolves, otters, and other quadrupeds; and the sea is plentifully stocked with different kinds of delicious fish, be∣sides cod, the staple commodity. It is certain, however, that the inhabitants would be in the ut∣most distress for broad, and many other necessaries, but for the exports thither from the mother-coun∣try, or the continent of America, from which they have almost every thing, except fish, venison, and wild fowl.</P>
<P>The chief and almost only trade here is in fish; of which there is such plenty on the coasts of the island, that the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e would almost might be sup∣plied from it: all sorts being taken here in im∣mense quantities; but the principal fishery is of cod, wherewith at least five hundred sail of ships are laden every year, for France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, England, and other parts. The main fishery is on the great bank, and the other banks about
<PB N="521" REF="5220"/>
this island, as also along the coast. The great bank is a vast mountain under water, extending in length according to the most accurate sea-charts, from the forty-first degree of north latitude to 49°. 25′. and in breadth from 42°. 30′. to 51°. 30′. of longitude west from London.</P>
<P>The depth of water on it is from five to sixty fathom. But whatever be the figure or dimen∣sion of this bank, it is covered with a vast quan∣tity of shells, and several kinds of fish of all sizes, most of which serve for food to the cod-fish, whose number here seems to equal the grains of sand on the bank itself. Between two and three hundred vessels have loaded here annually, for two centuries, yet this vast consumption has produced no apparent diminution of their numbers.</P>
<P>The next Bank, is called the Green-Bank. The charts make it about a hundred and twenty miles long, and about fifty over where broadest: it lies off the south coast of Newfoundland. There are several other banks, but they are not considerable enough to deserve particular notice.</P>
<P>The Great Strand, or drying place for fish, which is about a league in extent, lies between two steep hills, one of which is separated from the Strand by a small rivulet, which forms a kind of lake cal∣led the little bay, abounding with salmon. The Great Strand may contain at once wherewithal to load threescore ships. There is another lesser Strand for the use of the inhabitants, who fish all along the coast. The fishing season is from spring to September. All the train oil, that comes from Newfoundland, is drawn chiefly from the livers of the cod. The principal towns are Placentia, Bonavista, and St. John.</P>
<P>The Indians of this island are said to be a gentle, mild, tractable people, easily gained by civility and good usage. They paint their bodies, and in winter
<PB N="454" REF="5230"/>
are covered with skins and furs, especially round the waist. Their stature is small, but muscular and robust, their chests full, and their faces broad, to a degree of deformity. None of the savages of this island are ever found with a beard, which is generally ascribed to a prevailing custom among them of plucking the hairs up by the roots, the moment they begin to appear; an operation in which they are very dextrous. Pilfering, cunning, and duplicity are said also to be ingredients in the character of those people; nor are they ashamed, when detected; or provoked, when obliged to make restitution. They are reported to be more rational in their religious opinions than the Indians on the continent; to have carried some arts, particularly pottery, to great perfection; and to discover some seeds of genius capable of great improvement by cultivation.</P>
<P>The first settlements were made by the English, in the year 1010, and the French were permitted to settle here in the reign of King Charles II. but were obliged to quit the island by the peace of Utrecht in 1713, only they were left at liberty to dry their nets on the northern shores. Towards the end of the late war, the French surprized the island, and took possession, by capitulation, of St. John's, on the 27th of June 1762; but in September following were compelled to leave it. By the fifth article of the definitive treaty of peace, the subjects of France have a liberty of fishing and drying on a part of the coast of the island of Newfoundland, such as is spe∣cified in the fifteenth article of the treaty of U∣trecht; also the liberty of fishing in the gulph of St. Laurence, at the distance of three leagues from all the coasts belonging to Great-Britain, and at the distance of fifteen leagues from the coasts
<PB N="523" REF="5240"/>
of the island of Cape Breton. The islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon were also ceded to them by the sixth article, to serve as a shelter for their fisher∣men; but they are not to forrify these islands. By the eighteenth article of the said peace, his catholic majesty desists from any pretensions, in favour of his subjects, to the right of fishing in the neigh∣bourhood of the island of Newfoundland.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>CAPE-BRETON.</HEAD>
<P>This island, which, from the nature of its situation, is of the utmost consequence to the British colonies and fisheries in America, lies be∣tween 45 and 57°. of north latitude, and between 61 and 62°. of west longitude, being about one hundred miles in length, and fifty in breadth. It is seperated from Nova Scotia by the narrow Strait of Canso, or Fronsac; and is about twenty leagues from Newfoundland.</P>
<P>All the northern coast is very high, and almost inaccessible; nor is it much easier to land any where on the west coast, till you come to the Strait of Fronsac; but on the south-east there are several good harbours, bays, and creeks, especially that of Louisbourg, which is one of the finest in America, being almost four leagues round, and having every where six or seven fathom water.</P>
<P>The climate here is much the same with that of Quebec, only more subject to fogs; the air, howe∣ver, seems to be pretty wholesome.</P>
<P>The island abounds with lakes and rivers, coals, and limestone; and though there are many barren spots in it, apples, pulse, wheat, and other corn, flax and hemp, are or may be raised in it. Of the timber-trees, the most common are oaks of a prodigious bigness, pines fit for masts, ash,
<PB N="524" REF="5250"/>
maple, plane, and aspin trees. There is no oc∣casion for digging deep, or draining the waters, to come at the coals here, as in other countries.</P>
<P>There are houses, hogs, oxen, sheep, goats, and poultry on the island, but game is scarce. The partridges are almost as big as pheasants, and not unlike them in the colour of their feathers. The quantities of cod and other fish on the coast is almost incredible; and there is no scarcity of whales, sea∣wolves, porpoises, and seals.</P>
<P>This island was one of our conquests in the be∣ginning of the late war; Louisbourg, its fortress, with the island of St. John, and its other appur∣tenances, having been surrendered, by capitula∣tion, on the 26th of July, 1758. It was before taken from the French, by the English, in 1745; but restored by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748. To avoid expence, and prevent the French from settling on it again, all the fortifications at Louisbourgh have been demolished.</P>
<P>There are several islands lying round Cape Bre∣ton, among which are those of St. Peter, and Ma∣dame, or Maurepas; but the chief is St. John's, the produce of which is nearly the same as that of Cape Breton, but the soil is said to be much better. This last hath lately been made a separate govern∣ment; and a town, it is said, hath been laid out in it, to be called Charlotte Town.</P>
