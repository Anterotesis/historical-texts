<HEAD>TO THE
Right Reverend Father in God
EDWARD,
Lord BISHOP of Lichfield.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">Y</SEG>OUR Fame for that celebrated
Book, call'd the <HI>Defence of
Christianity,</HI> is the Occasion of
this Dedication. I need not tell you,
what vast Reputation you have ac∣quired
by it: You have been not only
often applauded from the Press, but
have met with large Compliments and
Thanks from your Clergy for it. And
tho' Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has very untowardly
written against you, yet this is <HI>still</HI>
your Honour, that you are an <HI>Author,</HI>
not unworthy of his Regard and Notice.</P>
<P>I am, in Opinion with the Fathers,
against an establish'd Hire for the
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Priesthood, thinking it of disservice to
true Religion: But when I consider'd
the Usefulness of your Lordship's Epis∣copal
Riches and Honours to this Con∣troversy,
I almost chang'd my Mind.
Your exalted Station in the Church,
has given Credit and Authority to your
Work, which, if it had came from the
Hands of a poor Priest, had never been
so much admir'd; neither would Mr.
<HI>Scheme,</HI> I believe, nor my self, have paid
so many Respects to it.</P>
<P>For this Reason, I wish some more
of your <HI>Order</HI> would appear in this Con∣troversy,
that the World might see what
famous Men are our <HI>Bishops,</HI> and of
what Use their <HI>Hundreds</HI> and <HI>Thousands</HI>
a Year are to the Dafence of Chri∣stianity;
which, if such able Hands were
not amply hired to its Support, might
be in Danger, as certainly as, that Men
of low Fortunes must needs be Men of
poor Parts, little Learning, and slender
Capacities to write in Vindication of it.</P>
<P>Some have conceiv'd Hopes that the
great <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> from his last
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
Charge to his <HI>Clergy,</HI> will second you
in this Controversy; if so, there's no
doubt on't, but his Performance will be
commensurate to his State and Revenues.
Of his Zeal in the Controversy, he has
already given a notable Instance, when
he prosecuted the <HI>Moderator;</HI> and I
dare say, he'll vouchsafe us a more re∣markable
Specimen of his Knowledge
in it, as soon as he can spare Time for't;
and then (Oh my Fears!) he'll pay me
off for my Objection against Christ's
Resurrection, which he would have
persuaded the Civil Magistrate to have
done for him.</P>
<P>But whether the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London</HI>
seconds you or not, it's Time, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
to expect another Volume from you, in
Answer to Mr. <HI>Scheme,</HI> which, for all
the Reports that are spread of your in∣tended
Silence, I hope soon to see pub∣lish'd.
What will the People say, if that
<HI>Philisthin</HI> goes off, giving you the last
Blow in the Controversy? Nothing less
than that he has gotten the better of the
Learned <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and has re∣futed
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Christianity to the Conviction of
the Bishop himself, who would renounce
it too, but for the temporal Advantages
he enjoys by it.</P>
<P>Think, <HI>my Lord,</HI> on the Dishonour
of such Reflections, and resume Courage
against the Adversary. I look upon you
as a more sturdy Gladiator than for one
Cut on the Pate, to quit the Stage of
Battle. Tho' Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> has unluckily
hit you on a soft Place, and weaken'd
your Intellectuals for a while; yet he is a
generous Combatant, and gives you
Time to recover your wonted Strength
of Reason. At him again then, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
and fear not, in your Turn, to give him
such a Home-Thrust, as will pierce his
unbelieving Heart.</P>
<P>And when your <HI>Lordship</HI> engages him
again from the <HI>Press,</HI> I hope you'll be
more explicite for Liberty of Debate.
Through godly Zeal for <HI>Church,</HI> you un∣happily
made a Slip, in your <HI>Dedication</HI> to
the <HI>King,</HI> on the persecuting Side of the
Question, which had lik'd to have sully'd
the Glory of your whole Work. Such a
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>
grand Philosopher, as you are, should
trust alone to the Goodness of your
Cause, and the Strength of your Reason∣ings,
in Defence of it: Such a potent
Champion for Christianity, as you are,
should disdain the Assistance of any, but
of God, to fight for you. The Use of
the Civil Sword on your Side, is not only
a Disparagement to your Parts, but a
Disgrace to our Religion.</P>
<P>I know not what your <HI>Lordship</HI> may
think on't, but the Prosecution of the
<HI>Moderator</HI> was, in the Judgment of others,
more than of my self, some Reproach to
you: Because of a few slender Animad∣versions,
I made on your renown'd Book,
some think I suffer'd a Prosecution, which
you, in Honour, should have discourag'd.
I am willing to acquit you as much as
may be; and would, if I could, impute
it to your Forgetfulness, rather than your
Malice, that you step'd not between me
and Danger.</P>
<P>Whether this Discourse will be accept∣able
to your Lordship, is somewhat un∣certain;
I am afraid it will be a little
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
disgustful to your nice and delicate Taste
in Theology, which relishes nothing better
than the plain and ordinary Food of the
Letter of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Miracles: But however,
you will readily interpret this <HI>Dedication</HI>
to your Honour, and if you should make
me a large present of Gold for it, I sin∣cerely
assure your <HI>Lordship,</HI> it will be
more than I aim'd at; neither do I desire
any other Return for it, than to be en∣dulg'd
the Liberty and Pleasure to pay
my customary Respects to your Writ∣ings;
and upon proper Occasions to testi∣fy
to the World, how much I am,</P>

<HEAD>A SECOND
DISCOURSE
ON THE
MIRACLES
OF OUR
SAVIOUR, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HERE publish another <HI>Dis∣course</HI>
on our Saviour's Mira∣cles,
which I am not only
oblig'd to, by the Promise I
made in my former; but am encouraged to
it by the Reception which <HI>that</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with.
If any of our <HI>Clergy</HI> were, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>des
them, few or none could be offended at
my former <HI>Discourse,</HI> they should have
printed their Exceptions to it, and, if pos∣sible,
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
their Confutation of it, which might
perhaps have prevented me the giving
them any more Trouble of this Kind.</P>
<P>In my former <HI>Discourse</HI> I fairly declar'd,
that if the <HI>Clergy</HI> could disprove my Argu∣ments
against the <HI>Letter,</HI> and for the <HI>Spirit</HI>
of the Miracles I there took to task, I would
not only desist from the Prosecution of my
Design, but own my self an impious <HI>Infidel</HI>
and <HI>Blasphemer,</HI> and deserving of the
worst Punishment: But since they are all
mute and silent, even in this Cause, which
in Honour and Interest they should have
spoken out to, they ought not to be an∣gry,
if I proceed in it. I have given
them time enough to make a Reply, if
they had been of Ability to do it: What
must I think then upon their Silence? No∣thing
less than that my Cause is impreg∣nable,
and my Arguments and Authorities
in Defence of it irrefragable; and though
they don't professedly yield to the Force of
them; yet they have nothing to say in A∣batement
of their Strength, or it had cer∣tainly
seen the Light before now.</P>
<P>I go on then in my undertaking to write
against the literal Story of our Saviour's
Miracles, and against the Use that is
commonly made of them to prove his di∣vine
Authority and Messiaship: And this
I do, I solemnly again declare it, not for
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
the Service of Infidelity, but for the Ho∣nour
of the Holy Jesus, and to reduce the
<HI>Clergy</HI> to the good <HI>old Way,</HI> and the <HI>only
Way</HI> of proving his Messiaship, and that
is, by the allegorical Interpretation of the
Law and the Prophets. Therefore, with∣out
any more Preamble, I resume again
the Consideration of the three Heads of
Discourse, before proposed to be treated
on to this Purpose. And they are,</P>
<P>I. To shew, That the Miracles of heal∣ing
all manner of Bodily Diseases, which
<HI>Jesus</HI> was justly fam'd for, are none of
the proper Miracles of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> nei∣ther
are they so much as a good Proof
of his divine Authority to found a Reli∣gion.</P>
<P>II. That the literal History of many of
the Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as recorded by the
<HI>Evangelists,</HI> does imply Absurdities, Im∣probabilities,
and Incredibilities; conse∣quently
they, either in whole or in part,
were never wrought, as they are common∣ly
believed now-a-days, but are only re∣lated
as prophetical and parabolical Narra∣tives
of what would be mysteriously, and
more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11"/>
III. To consider, what <HI>Jesus</HI> means,
when he appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to his Miracles, as to a
Testimony and Witness of his divine Au∣thority;
and to shew that he could not
prop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly and ultimately refer to those, he
then wrought in the <HI>Flesh,</HI> but to those
mystical ones, which he would do in the
<HI>Spirit,</HI> of which those wrought in the
Flesh are but mere Types and Shadows.</P>
<P>I have already spoken, what I then
thought sufficient to the first of these
Heads; and though I could now much en∣large
my Reasons, and multiply Authori∣ties
upon it to the same Purpose; yet I
shall not do it; but only, by Way of
Introduction to my following <HI>Discourse,</HI>
say, that if it had been intended by our
Saviour, that any rational Argument for
his divine Authority and <HI>Messiaship</HI> should
be urged from his miraculous healing
Power; the Diseases which he cured,
would have been accurately described, and
his Manner of Operation so cautiously ex∣press'd,
as that we might have been sure
the Work was supernatural, and out of
the Power of Art and Nature to perform:
But the <HI>Evangelists</HI> have taken no such
Care in their Narrations of Christ's Mira∣cles.
As for Instance, <HI>Jesus</HI> is supposed
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
often miraculously to cure <HI>Lameness;</HI> but
there is no Account of the nature and de∣gree
of Lameness he cured; nor are we
certain, whether the Skill of a <HI>Surgeon,</HI>
or Nature it self, could not have done the
Work without his Help. If the <HI>Evange∣lists</HI>
had told us of Men, that wanted
one or both their Legs, (and such mise∣rable
Objects of Christ's Power and Com∣passion,
were undoubtedly in those Days
as well as in ours) and how <HI>Jesus</HI> com∣manded
Nature to extend itself to the en∣tire
Reparation of such Defects; here
would have been stupendous Miracles in∣deed,
which no Scepticism, nor Infidelity
itself could have cavill'd at; nor could I,
nor the Fathers themselves have told how
to allegorize, and make Parables of them.
But there is no <HI>such</HI> Miracle recorded of
Christ, nor any thing equal to it; so far
from it, that the best and greatest Miracles
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> which must confessedly be those
related at large, (for no Body can suppose
he did greater than those more particularly
specify'd) are liable to exception, being so
blindly, and lamely, and imperfectly re∣ported,
as that, by Reasonings upon the
Letter of the Stories of them, they may
be dwindled away, and reduced to no
Wonders, which brings me to treat again
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="13"/>
II. Second Head of my Discourse, and
that is, to shew, that the literal History
of the Miracles of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as recorded in
the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> does imply Absurdities,
Improbabilities and Incredibilities; conse∣quently
they, in whole or in part, were
never wrought, but are only related as pa∣rabolical
Narratives of what would be my∣steriously,
and more wonderfully done by
him.</P>
<P>To this Purpose I, in my former Dis∣course,
took into Examination <HI>three</HI> of the
Miracles of Jesus, <HI>viz.</HI> those, of <HI>his driv∣ing
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Tem∣ple;</HI>
Of <HI>his exorcising the Devils out of
the Madmen, and sending them into the
Herd of Swine;</HI> and <HI>Of his Transfigu∣ration
on the Mount.</HI> How well I per∣form'd
on these Miracles, which have been
admired for their literal Story, let others
judge and say.</P>
<P><HI>I now will take into Consideration
three others of</HI> Jesus'<HI>s Miracles,</HI> viz.
<HI>those, Of</HI> his healing a Woman that was
afflicted with an Issue of Blood, twelve
Years; <HI>Of</HI> his curing the Woman that
labour'd under a Spirit of Infirmity, eigh∣teen
Years; <HI>and Of</HI> his telling the <HI>Sama∣ritan</HI>
Woman her Fortune of having had
five Husbands, and living then in Adul∣tery
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
with another Man: <HI>Which are, all
three, reputedly most miraculous and ad∣mired
Stories. The two former, they say,
are Arguments of</HI> Jesus'<HI>s mighty Power;
and the latter, of his immense Knowledge:
But how little of certain Power and
Knowledge there is in any of them, ac∣cording
to the Letter, will be seen in
the sequel of this Discourse. Infidels, I
dare say, if they had not wanted Liberty,
would e'er now have facetiously exposed
those Stories. If I snatch that Work out
of their Hands, our</HI> Clergy <HI>ought to be
glad, because what I do in it, is to the
Honour of the Holy</HI> Jesus, <HI>and to turn
those pretendedly miraculous Stories into
divine Mysteries.</HI></P>
<P>In my former Discourse I gave my <HI>Rea∣ders</HI>
some Reason to expect, that in <HI>this</HI>
I would treat on some of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles,
which I there mentioned, <HI>viz. On his turn∣ing
Water into Wine at a Marriage in</HI>
Cana <HI>of</HI> Galilee; and <HI>On his feeding of
Thousands with a few Loaves and Fishes
in the Wilderness;</HI> and <HI>On his Cure of
the Paralytick, for whom the Roof of
the House was broken up to let him down
into the Room where</HI> Jesus <HI>was,</HI> &amp;c. And
I then really did design to speak to these
Miracles, but upon Consideration, find∣ing
them most ludicrous Subjects according
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
to the Letter, I forbear it at present, hav∣ing
no Inclination to put the <HI>Clergy</HI> quite
out of all Temper. If any should say,
this is Fear and Cowardice in me, I can't
help it: But, for all that, now I have the
<HI>Clergy</HI> in a tolerable good Humour for
Liberty, I'll endeavour to keep them in
it, and not disturb them by an hasty and
unnecessary Provocation of them. Who
knows not, that the <HI>Clergy,</HI> like an un∣tamed
<HI>Colt,</HI> that I have a mind to ride, may
be apt to winch and kick, and may give
me a Fall before I come at the end of my
Journey, to the Disappointment of my
Readers? They shall therefore be gently
handled and stroak'd, till they are a little
more inur'd to the Bit and Saddle: And
for their Sakes will I postpone such Mira∣cles
as are most obnoxious to Ridicule,
and at present chuse the aforesaid <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e,</HI>
that of almost any in the Gospel may be
most inoffensively treated on. I begin
then,</P>
<P>1. To speak to that Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
<NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">Matt. Ch. <HI>ix.</HI> Luke Ch. <HI>viii.</HI> Mark Ch. <HI>v.</HI></NOTE> healing a <HI>Woman diseased with an Is∣sue
of Blood, twelve Years.</HI> To please
our <HI>Divines,</HI> I will allow as much of the
Truth of the Letter of this Story, as they
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
can desire. The Fathers themselves, who
are for turning the whole History of <HI>Je∣sus</HI>'s
Life into Allegory and Mystery,
don't deny that a Woman was cured of an
<HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> after the Manner that is
here described by the Evangelists. St. <HI>Au∣gustin</HI>
says<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">Factum quidum est, &amp;, ita ut n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rratur, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tum. <HI>In Serm.</HI> Ixxvii. <HI>Sect.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> of this Miracle, <HI>that it
was done, as it is related;</HI> and I have
a greater Veneration for his Authority,
than to gainsay it. But for all that,
<HI>Infidels</HI> may and will take into Examina∣tion
the nature of this Miracle, and if
possible make little or nothing of it. And
if I do this for them, it is not to do Ser∣vice
to Infidelity, but to turn Mens Heads
to the mystical Use of it, for which it is
recorded.</P>
<P>As there is a particular Narration of
this Miracle, among the few others, that
are specified; so Reason should tell us,
that if the Letter of the Story of <HI>Christ</HI>'s
Miracles, as our <HI>Divines</HI> hold, is only to
be regarded, this is one of the greatest
that Jesus wrought, or it would not be
related by itself, but thrown into the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ump of all manner of Diseases, which
He heal'd. And how then shall we
come to the Knowledge of the greatness
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
of this Miracle? Why, there are but two
Ways to it, and they are,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> By considering the nature of the
Disease, or the lamentable Condition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the Patient before Cure. And</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> By considering the Manner or
Means by which the Cure was performed.</P>
<P>If one or both of these Considerations
don't manifest the Certainty of a Miracle,
<HI>Infidels</HI> may conclude there was none
in it.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to the nature of the Disease
of this Woman, we are much in the Dark
about it, and very uncertain of what Kind
and Degree it was. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> writing
of it, says the Woman was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that
is, <HI>obnoxious to bleeding;</HI> St. <HI>Mark</HI> and
St. <HI>Luke</HI> say of her, that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
she was in an efflux or running of
Blood. But neither one nor the other of the
<HI>Evangelists</HI> signify of what Degree her
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> was, nor from what part of
her Body it proceeded, nor how often or
seldom she was addicted to it. It might be,
for ought we know, only a little bleeding
at the Nose, that now and then she was
subject to: Or it might be an obnoxious∣ness
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
to an Evacuation of Blood by Siege
or Urine: Or it was, not improbably, of
the menstruous Kind. Any of these might
be the Case of this Woman for what's
written; and I don't find that any of our
<HI>Divines</HI> have determined of what sort it
was. But a great Miracle is wrought,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey think, in her Cure, without know∣ing
the Disease; which <HI>Infidels</HI> will say
is asserted at Random and without Reason,
in as much as it is necessary to know the
nature of the Distemper, or none truly
and properly can say, there was a great,
much less a miraculous Cure wrought.</P>
<P>But supposing this <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> proceed∣ed
from what Part of the Body our <HI>Di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines</HI>
think fit; How will they make a
grievous Distemper of it in order to a Mi∣racle?
The Woman subsisted too long un∣der
her Issue of Blood, and bore it too
well, for any to make her Case very grie∣vous.
<HI>Beza</HI><NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">On Mat. Chap. <HI>ix.</HI></NOTE> will have it, that is was
a constant and incessant Effusion of Blood
that the Woman labour'd with. But this
could not be, nor was it possible, as I
suppose <HI>Physicians</HI> will agree, for Nature
to endure it so long, or the Woman to
live twelve Days, much less twelve Years
under it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="19"/>
No more then, than some slight Indis∣position
can reasonably and naturally be
made of this Woman's Distemper. And
it would be well, if Infidels would rest
here with their Objections against it. But
what if they should say, that this <HI>Hae∣morrhage</HI>
was rather of Advantage to the
Health of the Patient, than of Danger to
her, and that the Woman was more <HI>nice</HI>
than <HI>wise,</HI> or she would never have sought
so much for Help and Cure of it? Some
<HI>Haemorrhages</HI> are better kept open than
stop'd and dry'd up; and if <HI>Infidels</HI> should
say, that <HI>this</HI> was a Preservative of the
Life of the Woman, like an <HI>Issue,</HI> at which
Nature discharges itself of bad Humours,
Who can contradict them? Nay, if they
should say <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Cure of this Wo∣man's
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> was a Precipitation of
her Death, for she died some time after it,
rather than a Prolongation of her Life,
for she lived twelve Years under it, and
was of good Strength, when she applied
to our Saviour for Cure, or she could ne∣ver
have born the press of the People to
come at him; Who can gainsay them?
It is true she was very sollicitous for a
Cure, and uneasy under her Distemper,
or she would never have spent all she had
on <HI>Physicians;</HI> which is a Sign, some
may say, that her Disease was grievous,
<PB N="13" REF="20"/>
irksome, and dangerous, as well as in∣cura<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
by Art. But <HI>Infidels</HI> will say,
not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or there are some slight cutane∣ous
Distempers, sometimes issuing with
a little purulent and bloody Matter,
that nice Women will be at a great
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ce for Relief, and are always tam∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>
and often advising about them,
though to no Purpose: And if they
should say that this was the worst of the
Case of this Woman, Who can disprove
it?</P>
<P>In short then here is an uncertain Di∣stemper
both in Nature and Degree; how
then can there be any Certainty of a Mi∣racle
in the Cure of it? Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI> the
<HI>Apothecary,</HI> accurately describes the Di∣seases
he pretends to have cured; and he
is in the right on't so to do, or he could
not recommend his Art, and aggrandize
his own Fame. So the Bodily Disease of
this Woman should have been clearly and
fully represented to our Understanding, or
we can sorm no Conception of Christ's
Power in the Cure of it. And I can't
but think that the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> especially
St. <HI>Luke</HI> the <HI>Physician,</HI> had made a better
Story of this Woman's Case, if Christ's
Authority and Power had been to be urg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
from the Letter of it. It's enough to make
us think, Christ cured no extraordinary and
<PB N="14" REF="21"/>
grievous Maladies, or the <HI>Evangelists</HI>
would never have instanced in this, that
so much Exception is to be made to. As
then, reasonably speaking, there was no
extraordinary Disease in this Woman cured,
and consequently no great Miracle wrought;
so let us now,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Consider the Manner of the
Cure, and whether any Miracle is to be
thence proved. <HI>The Woman said with∣in
her self,</HI><NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot">Matt. Ch. <HI>ix.</HI> v. 21.</NOTE> <HI>that if she could but touch
the Hem of Jesus's Garment, she should
be made whole.</HI> And I can't but com∣mend
her, at this distance of Time, for
the Power of her Faith, Persuasion, or
Imagination in the Case, which was a
good Preparative for Relief, and without
which, it's certain, she had continued
under her Disease. The Power of Imagi∣nation,
it's well known, will work Won∣ders,
see Visions, produce Monsters, and
heal Diseases, as Experience and History
doth testify. There being many In∣stances
to be given of Cures performed
by frivolous Applications, Charms, and
Spells, which are unaccountable any other
Way, than by the Imagination of the Pa∣tient.
Against the Reason and Judgment
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
of a <HI>Physician,</HI> sometimes the diseased
will take his own Medicines and find Be∣nefit.
And I don't doubt, but Stories
may be told of Cures wrought, the Ima∣gination
of the Patient helping, by as mean
a Trifle, as the Touch of Christ's Gar∣ments,
and no Miracle talk'd on for it.
Even in the ordinary, natural, and ratio∣nal
Use of Physick, it is requisite, that
the Patient have a good Opinion of his
<HI>Physician</HI> and of his Medicines. A good
Heart in the Sick, tends not only to his
Support, but helps the Operation of Pre∣scriptions.
As despair an dejection of
Mind sometimes kills, where otherwise
reasonably speaking, proper Medicines
would cure; so a good Conceit in the Pa∣tient
at other times, whether the Medi∣cines
be pertinent or not, is almost all
in all. And if Infidels should say that
this was the Case of this Woman in the
Gospel; if they should say as St. <HI>John of
Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot">Non autem Fimbria J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>su, sed ejus Cogitatio <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am salvam fecit. <HI>In Loc. Marci.</HI></NOTE> did, <HI>that her own Imagi∣nation
cured herself;</HI> and should urge the
Probability of it, because <HI>Jesus</HI> could do
no Cures and<NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">Matt. Ch. <HI>xiii.</HI> v. 58.</NOTE> Miracles against Un∣belief,
Who can help it? In this Case our
<HI>Divines</HI> must prove, that this Woman's
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> was of that kind, that no
Faith nor Fancy in herself could help her
without the Divine Power; but this is impos∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble
for them to do, unless there had been
a more certain Description of her Disease,
than the <HI>Evangelists</HI> have given of it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Divines</HI> will indeed tell us, what
I believe, that it was the Divine Power
co-operating with the Faith and Imagina∣tion
of the Woman that cured her; be∣cause
Jesus says <HI>that Virtue had gone out
of him</HI> to the healing of her: And I wish
<HI>Infidels</HI> would acquiesce here, and not
say, that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Virtue hung very loose
on him, or the Woman's Faith, like a Fas∣cination,
could never have extracted it a∣gainst
his Will and Knowledge: But what
if they should say, that <HI>Jesus,</HI> being se∣cretly
appriz'd of the Woman's Faith,
and Touch of him, took the Hint; and
to comfort and confirm her in her Conceit,
and to help the Cure forward, said, <HI>Vir∣tue
was gone out of him?</HI> This would
be an untoward Suggestion, which if In∣fidels
should make, our Divines must look
for a Reply to it.</P>
<P>It is said of the <HI>Pope,</HI> when he was
last at <HI>Benevento,</HI> that he wrought three
Miracles, which our Protestant <HI>Clergy,</HI> I
dare say, believe nothing at all of. But,
for all that, it is not improbable, but that
<PB N="17" REF="24"/>
some diseased People, considering their
superstitious Veneration for the <HI>Pope,</HI> and
their Opinion of the Sanctity of the <HI>Present,</HI>
might be persuaded of his Gift of Miracles,
and desirous of his Exercise of it; and if
they fancyfully or actually received Bene∣fit
by his Touch, I don't wonder, without
a Miracle. And what if we had been told
of the <HI>Popes</HI> curing an <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> like
this before us? What would <HI>Protestants</HI>
have said to it? Why, “that a foolish,
credulous, and superstitious Woman had
fancy'd herself cured of some slight In∣disposition;
and the crafty <HI>Pope</HI> and his
Adherents, aspiring after popular Ap∣plause,
magnified the presumed Cure
into a Miracle. If they would have us
<HI>Protestants</HI> to believe the Miracle, they
should have given us an exacter Descrip∣tion
of her Disease, and then we could
better have judg'd of it”. The Appli∣cation
of such a supposed Story of a Mi∣racle
wrought by the <HI>Pope,</HI> is easy; and
if <HI>Infidels, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who
have no better Opinion of <HI>Jesus,</HI> than we
have of the <HI>Pope,</HI> should make it, there's
no Help for it.</P>
<P>And thus have I made my Descants on
this supposed Miracle before us, and ar∣gued,
as much as I could, against the Mi∣raculousness
of it, both from the <HI>Nature</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
of the Disease, and the <HI>Manner</HI> of the
Cure of it. Whether any one shall think
I have said any thing to the Purpose or
not, is all one to me. My Design in what
I have done, is not to do Service to Infi∣delity,
but, upon the Command and En∣couragement
of the Fathers, to turn Mens
Thoughts to the mystical Meaning of the
said Miracle, which I come now to give
an Account of.</P>
<P>None of the Fathers (excepting St.
<HI>Chrysostom</HI><NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">In Locum <HI>Matt.</HI></NOTE>, who writes here more like
an <HI>Orator</HI> than a <HI>Physician</HI>) ever trouble
themselves, when they speak of this Mi∣racle,
about the Nature of the Disease,
literally, in this Woman, or the greatness
of the Cure of it; but alone bend their
Studies to the mystical Interpretation, for
the sake of which, this Evangelical Story
was written, and originally transacted.</P>
<P>Accordingly, they tell us that this Wo∣man
is a Type<NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot">Illa vero Mulier quae Fluxum Sanguinis pa∣tiebatur, Ecclesiam figurabat ex Gentibus. St. <HI>August. in Serm.</HI> lxxvii. <HI>Sect.</HI> 8.

<P>The <HI>twelve Years</HI> of the Woman's Af∣fliction
with her <HI>Haemorrhage</HI> is a typical
Number of the Church's impure State for
above <HI>twelve Hundred Years.</HI> And
whether some of the primitive Church
did not, by the said <HI>twelve Years</HI> of the
Woman, understand <HI>twelve Ages,</HI> I ap∣peal
to<NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot">Adversus Haereses. <HI>Lib. 1. Cap.</HI> iii.</NOTE> <HI>Irenaeus,</HI> to whom I refer my
<PB N="20" REF="27"/>
Readers. Accordingly this typify'd Wo∣man
of the Church, should be the same
with the Woman<NOTE N="13" PLACE="foot">Revel. Chap. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> v. 6</NOTE> in the Wilderness,
that, as St. <HI>John</HI> says, was twelve Hun∣dred
and sixty Days or Years th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stain∣ed;
and by whom many Protestants, as
well as the Fathers, understand the Church
universal. When the said twelve Hundred
and sixty Days or Years of the Church's
being in the Wilderness, did commence
or will end, is none of my Business to
enquire or ascertain. But as this Woman
in the Gospel is said after <HI>twelve Years</HI>
Affliction, to be cured of her Disease by
<HI>Jesus;</HI> so it is the Opinion of the Fathers,
that the Church universal, after <HI>twelve
Hundred Years</HI> of her Wilderness State,
will be purified and sanctified by the Gifts
of the Spirit of Christ, and enter upon a
more holy, peaceable, and happy Condition,
absolutely freed from her <HI>Issue of Blood,</HI>
which, through Persecution and War, she
has for many Ages labour'd under. It is
not my Concern to collect all the Autho∣rities
of the Fathers to this Purpose; but
only say, that if at the End of twelve Hun∣dred
and sixty Days or Years, the Church,
like the Woman, be not cur'd of her <HI>Hae∣morrhage</HI>
and mystical <HI>Wounds</HI> and <HI>Sores▪</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
if her present impure and unsound State
be not chang'd into an holy, healthy, and
peaceable one; many good <HI>Protestants,</HI> as
well as the Fathers, are mistaken, and
abundance of Prophecies of the Old and
New Testament, that have been hereunto
urged, will lose their Credit.</P>
<P>But who are meant by the <HI>Physicians</HI>
of the Woman, that have had the mysti∣cal
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> and Diseases of the
Church under Cure all this while? Who
should, but pretended Ministers, of the
Gospel? Ministers of the Gospel are not
only by the Fathers call'd metaphorically

in their Opinion, she stands in need of
them. Whether our <HI>Divines</HI> like to be

us, I much question; but it is certain
that<NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">Per hos enim Medicos, Ariolos &amp; Philoso∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s intelligere possumus, quorum persuasionibus caeteri credentes a sidei Veritate aberrantes ad Animae Sanitatem attingere non valebant. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dominic.</HI> xxiv.</NOTE> <HI>Eusebius Gallicanus</HI> expresly

same Mind too.</P>
<P>The Woman of the Gospel is said<NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Mark Ch. <HI>v.</HI> v. 26.</NOTE> to
<HI>suffer many Things of many Physicians,
and was nothing better'd, but rather
grew worse;</HI> that is, she grew worse not
in time only, but through the Use of her
<HI>Physicians,</HI> who were her<NOTE N="18" PLACE="foot">Medici Molestiam potius quam Sanitatem <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>grotan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i praebentes. <HI>Ephraem. Syri.</HI> p. 63.</NOTE> Tormen∣tors.
So the Diseases of the Church in
time have increased, for all the Use she
has made of her spiritual Physicians, <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Clergy.</HI> In every Age has the Church
been degenerating in Morals and Principles,
as any one knows, that is able to make an
Estimate of Religion in times past; and
all along have her ecclesiastical <HI>Quack
Doctors</HI> contributed to her ill State of
Health. As many Physicians with their
different Applications tormented the poor
Woman; so our many <HI>Empericks</HI> in The∣ology
with their different <HI>Schemes</HI> of
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
Church Government and various <HI>Systems</HI> of
Divinity, like so many Prescriptions for
Cure, have increased the Divisions, wid∣en'd
the Wounds, and inflamed the Sores
of the Church. And if the Woman's <HI>Is∣sue
of Blood</HI> be, according to the Fathers,
a particular Type of the Blood of the
Church, that is shed in Persecution and
War; our Theological Pretenders to Phy∣sick,
have been so far from providing and
prescribing a good <HI>Stiptic</HI> in this Case,
that they have been the Occasion of the Ef∣fusion
of much Christian Blood; there hav∣ing
been many a War and Persecution, that
these <HI>Incision</HI> Doctors, who should be all
<HI>Balsam,</HI> have been the Cause of.</P>
<P>The Woman <HI>spent all her Living,</HI> all
her yearly Income, upon her Physicians,
and as it seems to a bad Purpose; so very
great and large Revenues of the Church,
are expended on her ecclesiastical Doctors
in spiritual Physick: And to what End
and Purpose? Why, to open and widen
the bleeding Wounds of the Church,
which they should heal and salve up. It
is now about <HI>twelve Hundred Years,</HI> like
the <HI>twelve Years</HI> of the Woman, that the
<HI>Clergy,</HI> our Practitioners in Theological
Physick, have received of the Church
vast Fees, Stipends and Gratuities (for be∣fore
that time her <HI>Doctors</HI> prescrib'd free∣ly)
to take care of her Health and Wel∣fare;
<PB N="24" REF="31"/>
but unless God provide in due time
a Medicine of his own, she is likely to
continue in a diseased and sorowful Con∣dition
for all them.</P>
<P>One would think that the Woman of
the Gospel might have had more Wit than
to lay out all she was worth upon <HI>Physi∣cians</HI>
to no good Purpose; one would
think that after some Experience of them
Insufficiency to cure her, she might have
forborn feeing them, and reserved the Re∣mains
of her Estate for better Uses: So
the Fees and Revenues of the Church, af∣ter
due Experience of the Inability of her
spiritual Doctors to heal her Sores, might
have been in my Opinion better employ'd,
and the Church of Christ more out of
Danger of Wounds and Sickness, by Sin
and Error. Certain it is, that many an <HI>Issue
of Blood,</HI> through Persecution and War,
had been prevented; if such barbarous
and blood thirsty Doctors of Ecclesiastical
Physick, had never been so fee'd and hired
to take care of the Welfare of the Church,
which, for all their Spiritual Medicines,
will continue in a languishing Condi∣tion,
till heal'd by the Virtue and Graces
of the Spirit of Christ in his foresaid ap∣pointed
Time.</P>
<P>So much then to the mystical Interpre∣tation
of the Story of the Cure of the
<PB N="25" REF="32"/>
<HI>Issue of Blood</HI> in this Woman. Every mi∣nute
Circumstance of it is thus to be al∣legorized,
if need was. Whether the
<HI>Clergy</HI> will like this parabolical Explica∣tion
of it, I neither know nor care. They
have their Liberty with <HI>Atheists</HI> and <HI>Infi∣dels</HI>
to believe as little of it as they think
fit; and I hope they'll give me leave with
the Fathers of the Church to believe as
much of it as I please. But whether they
approve of this allegorial Interpretation
of this supposed Miracle or not; they must
own, that if the Church, after the fore∣said
<HI>twelve Ages,</HI> should be purified and
sanctified; if her Errors and Corruptions,
of which the Woman's <HI>Uncleanness</HI> is a
Type, should be heal'd; if War and Per∣secution,
typified by her <HI>Issue of Blood,</HI>
should then entirely cease; if all Christi∣ans
should then be united in Principle,
Heart and Affection, and made to walk in
a peaceable and quiet State, as the Wo∣man
was<NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">Mark Ch. <HI>v.</HI> v. 34.</NOTE> <HI>bid to go in Peace;</HI> if the
Church should then <HI>come behind</HI> Jesus
(which<NOTE N="20" PLACE="foot">Dei Posteriora sunt novissima tempora. <HI>Origen in Psal.</HI> XXXVI.</NOTE> is a Figure of future Time)
and rightly touch by Faith, and appre∣hend
<PB N="26" REF="33"/>
his<NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot">Vestimenta Jesu sunt Sermones &amp; Scripta Evangeliorum. <HI>Origen in Matt. Ch.</HI> xvii.</NOTE> Garments or Words of Pro∣phecy,
about which Christians have hi∣therto
been <HI>pressing</HI> and urgent; and
if the Gifts of the Spirit, like <HI>Virtue
on the Woman,</HI> should then be poured
forth upon the Church to the absolute
Cure of her present Diseases, we must, I
say, allow the Story of this Woman to
be an admirable Emblem and typical Re∣presentation;
and the Accomplishment of
it most miraculous and stupendous; and
not only an indisputable Proof of the
Power and Presence of Christ with his
Church, but a Demonstration of his <HI>Mes∣siaship,</HI>
in as much as an almost infi∣nite
Number of Prophecies of the Old
Testament, will thereupon receive that Ac∣complishment,
which hitherto, by no sha∣dow
of Reason, can be pretended to.</P>
<P>After such a mystical Healing of the
<HI>Haemorrhage</HI> of the Church, there's no
doubt on't, but the Story of this Woman
in the Gospel will be allow'd to be typical
and emblematical. In the mean time, with∣out
making a Parable of the Story of her,
I assert, there is little or nothing of a
Miracle to be made of her Cure, unless
we were at a greater Certainty about the
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
Nature of her Disease, and the Manner,
rationally speaking, of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s healing of
it. And so I pass to the Consideration
of</P>
<P>2. Another Story of a miraculous Cure
perform'd by <HI>Jesus</HI> on another Woman,
and that is on her, who<NOTE N="22" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke Ch.</HI> xiii.</NOTE> <HI>had a Spi∣rit
of Infirmity, eighteen Years, and was
bow'd together, and could in no wise
lift up herself—being bound of Sa∣tan,</HI>
&amp;c. This too, as I suppose, is with
our <HI>Divines</HI> a great Miracle, and one
of the greatest that <HI>Jesus</HI> wrought,
or it had not been specify'd, but cast
indiscriminately into the Number of all
manner of Diseases, which he heal'd.
And for the sake of the Letter, and to
please our <HI>Divines,</HI> whom I would not
offend wilfully, I will allow, that <HI>Jesus</HI>
might lay his Hands on, and speak com∣fortably
to such a drooping, stooping, and
vaporous Woman, full of Fancies of the
<HI>Devil</HI>'s Temptation and Power over her;
and she might thereupon recover, and be
afterwards of a more chearful Heart, and
erect Countenance, freed from the whim∣sical
Imagination of being <HI>Satan-ridden:</HI>
And what of all that? Where's the Mi∣racle?
<PB N="28" REF="35"/>
If the Story of such a Miracle had
been related of any <HI>Impostor</HI> in Religion,
of an <HI>Arch-Heretick,</HI> or <HI>Popish Exorcist,</HI>
our <HI>Divines</HI> would have flouted at it;
they would have told us, there was no∣thing
supernatural and uncommon in the
Event, nor any thing at all to be won∣der'd
at in it. Taking the <HI>Devil</HI> out of
this Story, and there's no more in it, than
what's common for a simple, melancholy,
and drooping Woman, to be chear'd and
elated upon the comfortable Advice and
Admonition of a reputedly wise and good
Man. And the putting the <HI>Devil</HI> into
the Story, in another Case, our <HI>Divines</HI>
would have said was only the Fancy of
the Woman, or the Device of the <HI>Mira∣cle-Monger,</HI>
to magnify his own Art and
Power▪ And if <HI>Infidels, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Ma∣hometans,</HI>
should say so of this Story of
<HI>Jesus,</HI> they would be no more unreason∣able
in their Conjectures and Solutions of
this Miracle, than we should have been in
another and parallel Case.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope,</HI> when last at <HI>Benevento,</HI> is
said to have exorciz'd a <HI>Daemon</HI> out of a
young Maid, which our <HI>Divines</HI> no more
believe than <HI>Infidels</HI> do. But it is not at
all impossible or improbable, that a young
Woman might be troubled with Vapours▪
and go droopingly upon it, whom the
<PB N="29" REF="36"/>
holy Father, of whose Prayers and San∣ctity
she had a good Opinion, might re∣lieve
with his Talk, and give another Turn
to her Thoughts and Temper: And if she
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancy'd herself before possess'd with a <HI>Dae∣mon,</HI>
or rather, if the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Partizans per∣suaded
her so, it's not unlikely to make a
Miracle on't. Just so may <HI>Infidels,</HI> with
their Descants on this Miracle before us,
reduce and lessen it: And what must we
Believers do then? Why, we must find
out a Way to ascertain the Truth and
Greatness of the Miracle, or give it up.
We must determine certainly what was the
Woman's Distemper, and how the Cure
of it by ordinary Means was impossible, or
make no more Words about it.</P>
<P>And how can we come at the Know∣ledge
of this Woman's Disease, but by
the original Words of the <HI>Evangelist.</HI>
St. <HI>Luke</HI> says, she was one <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
<HI>that had a Spirit of Weakness,</HI>
that is, was poor-Spirited and pusilani∣mous;
and if she was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>bow'd
down</HI> upon't, its no more than might be
expected of a disconsolate, melancholy and
dejected Person. Here then is the Disease
of the Woman: If it had been worse, St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> the Physician, if he was of Suffi∣ciency
in his Art, should better have ex∣press'd
himself; so as to give us another
<PB N="30" REF="37"/>
Conception of it. And if <HI>Satan</HI> had not
been brought into the Tale, whom it is
easy, by reasoning as above, to exorcise
out of it, here is a no more grievous Di∣stemper,
than what upon the comfortable
Exhortations of a wise Man may be cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.
And do what our Divines can, they can
make literally no more of this Story.</P>
<P>It is said, that for <HI>eighteen Years</HI> the
Woman labour'd under this Disease. And
she might be <HI>hippish</HI> and <HI>drooping</HI> for a
longer time, and be no less easily at last
cured. It's pity the <HI>Evangelist</HI> had not
told us how old this Woman was, when
the Distemper first seiz'd her; then we
could have made better Conjectures about
the Nature and Cure of it. If there was
any room to suppose, either from the
Words of Scripture or extra-scriptural Hi∣story,
that she was about <HI>fifty</HI> or <HI>sixty,</HI>
when she first began to droop and the
<HI>Devil</HI> got upon her Back; here had been
Scope for a most stupendous Miracle; and
our <HI>Divines</HI> might have asserted, what
no Body could have contradicted, that <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
had made an old Woman, who was
<HI>bow'd down,</HI> not only under the Weight
of <HI>Satan,</HI> but under the Burthen of se∣venty
or eighty Years, young again; and
had restored her to the Health, Vigor,
and Beauty of one of fifteen. Here would
<PB N="31" REF="38"/>
have been a mighty Miracle indeed. And
I don't doubt, but our <HI>Divines</HI> would
willingly get into such a Notion of this
Miracle, and would heartily espouse it,
but for the Offence they must needs give
to decrepid old Women, who may be out
of Conceit with themselves upon it, as if
they carried the <HI>Devil</HI> on their Shoulders,
as the Cause of their Decripedness and
Incurvity. And such an Offence would be
of ill Consequence.</P>
<P>Reasonably then speaking, there was
not much in the Disease and Cure of this
Woman. Excepting that Part, which <HI>Sa∣tan</HI>
bears, in the Story, there is nothing
wonderful in it. And supposing <HI>Jesus</HI>
might exorcise the <HI>Devil</HI> out of this Wo∣man,
or dismount him from off her
Shoulders; yet even this makes nothing
for his Divine Power and Authority, in
as much as many <HI>Exorcists</HI> among the
<HI>Jews</HI> and even among <HI>Papists,</HI> if Prote∣stants
had not more Wit than to believe it,
could do as much. And after all, I don't
believe the <HI>Evangelist</HI> intended, that our
Saviour should be had in Admiration for
the Letter of this Miracle, or St. <HI>Luke</HI>
would accurately have described the Dis∣ease,
so as to put it out of the Power of
Nature and Art to heal it, and of the
Wit of <HI>Infidels</HI> to cavil at the miraculous
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
Cure of it. Neither do I find that the
Fathers of the Church ever trouble them∣selves
about the Letter of this Story,
which is some Argument, that no great
Heed is to be given to it; but are only cu∣rious
about the Mystery, for which this
Miracle was related, and which I come
now to give an Account of.</P>
<P>As the Fathers said of the Woman with
her <HI>Issue of Blood,</HI> that she was a Type
of the Church; so they say of this Wo∣man
with her <HI>Spirit of Infirmity,</HI> that
she is a<NOTE N="23" PLACE="foot">In Muliere infirma est Figura Ecclesiae. <HI>Theoph. Antioch. in Loc.

of Weakness,</HI> which is not properly

which is the concurrent Doctrine of the

<P>But the <HI>Ruler of the Synagogue is said
to be moved with Indignation, v.</HI> 14.
at this charitable Work of <HI>Jesus,</HI> in heal∣ing
of the Woman, because it was done
on the Sabbath-Day; which in my Opi∣nion,
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
can't be literally true: Though I
am willing enough, to please our <HI>Di∣vines,</HI>
to allow as much as may be of the
Letter of this Story, yet I except against
this Part of it. <HI>Origen</HI> says, there are
some things of the Gospel related as Facts,
which were not done; and I believe this
of the Ruler of the Synagogue to be one
of them. Human Nature, I think, is not
capable of such base and unnatural Re∣sentment.
Works of Necessity, and re∣quisite
Offices of Kindness and Charity to
Man and Beast, were allow'd by the Law,
and practised by the <HI>Jews</HI> on the Sabbath:
And the Cure of this Woman, though on
the Sabbath-Day, was such an Act of Bene∣ficence
and Compassion in the Holy <HI>Jesus,</HI>
that I can't but think <HI>bad,</HI> as well as <HI>good</HI>
Men, would rather glorify God, that had
given such Power unto Man, than find
fault with it. But in the Mystery of this
Part of the Story, there is clear Sense
and Truth. Who then is this <HI>Archisy∣nagogus</HI>
or Ruler of the Synagogue, that
will be full of Indignation at the heal∣ing
of the Church of her foresaid <HI>Infir∣mity</HI>
at the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Prophecy? <HI>Origen</HI>
says that the<NOTE N="29" PLACE="foot">Contemnenda non est accurata circa Nomi∣na Diligentia ei qui voluerit prole intelligere sa∣cras Literas. <HI>In Johan. Evang. Tom.</HI> 8.</NOTE> right Interpretation of
<PB N="37" REF="44"/>
the Names of Persons and Places in Scrip∣ture
is of good Use to the mystical Ap∣plication.
Accordingly <HI>Archisynagogus</HI>
does signify the <HI>Chiefs of our Congregati∣ons:</HI>
And who should they be then but
the Clergy? And if this ben't enough
to fix this Name and Character upon them
then let <HI>Theophanes Cerameus</HI> speak here,
who says, that the <HI>Archisynagogus,</HI> is a
<NOTE N="30" PLACE="foot">Jam Archi-Synagogus adumbrat omnes Sa∣cerdotes, &amp;c. <HI>In. Hom.</HI> xii.</NOTE> <HI>Type of all Priests,</HI> who will be
against the foresaid miraculous healing of
the Church. And why will the <HI>Clergy</HI>
be mov'd with Indignation at the curing
the Church of her <HI>Infirm,</HI> and restoring
her to a <HI>sound</HI> Spirit of Prophecy? Because
as St. <HI>Augustin</HI> says,<NOTE N="31" PLACE="foot">Caluminabantur autem erigenti, qui, nisi curvi? <HI>In Serm.</HI> cccxcii.</NOTE> they are not
only <HI>bow'd down</HI> to the Letter themselves;
but because this <HI>Infirmity</HI> of the Church
will be a Reproach to them, in as much
as it is a Proof of their Apostacy and In∣sufficiency
at Prophecy; and the Cure of
it will be attended with such Consequences,
as affect their Reputation and Interests.
Who can question but the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who
are the <HI>Archisynagogus</HI> of the Text, and
who are for the Church's <HI>bending</HI> and
<PB N="38" REF="45"/>
<HI>stooping</HI> to the low Sense of the Letter of
the Scripture, will be averse to her being
rais'd, <HI>lifted up,</HI> and erected to the Con∣templation
of the sublime, anagogical,
and heavenly Sense of it? Such an Heal∣ing
and Erection of the Church will vex
them at the Heart, as it will bring <HI>Shame</HI>
and loss of Interest along with it; and
they will undoubtedly be <HI>Adversaries</HI> to
this good Work of <HI>Christ,</HI> which, upon
the Testimony of all Antiquity, is to be
done on or against the Evangelical and
great Sabbath.</P>
<P>Our Saviour is supposed to reprove the
<HI>Ruler</HI> of the <HI>Synagogue,</HI> for his <HI>Indigna∣tion</HI>
at the Cure of the Woman on the
Sabbath-Day, saying, <HI>v. 15. Thou Hypo∣crite,
doth not each one of you on the
Sabbath loose his Ox or his Ass from the
Stall, and lead him away to Watering?
And ough<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not this Woman to be loos'd
from this Bond on the Sabbath-Day?</HI>
There is Force in this Argument according
to the Letter: And the <HI>Ruler</HI> of the <HI>Sy∣nagogue,</HI>
and other <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Adversaries
hereupon, might well be <HI>asham'd</HI> for find∣ing
Fault with such a merciful and benefi∣cent

our Ministers of the Letter, of whom the

<P>But <HI>Satan</HI> is said to have <HI>v. 16. bound,</HI>

the literal Truth of which I much
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
question: But how then has <HI>Satan bound
and bow'd down</HI> the Church? This, seem∣ingly,
is the great Difficulty in the myst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cal
Application of this Story, and must be
the great Curiosity of my Readers to know
how I will acco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t for it. If the Fathers
don't help me out at this dead Lift, and
that clearly and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igibly too, I shall
abate of my Veneration for them. If they
don't tell me, and make me to apprehend,
what this <HI>Satan</HI> is, that for many Ages
has <HI>bound</HI> and oppress'd the Church after
the supposed Manner of the typical Wo∣man,
I had better have held my Peace,
and said nothing to this parabolical Mi∣racle.</P>
<P>The Writings of the <HI>Evangelists</HI> so a∣bound
with Stories of <HI>Satan, Belzebub,</HI>
the <HI>Devil,</HI> and of greater and less Num∣ber
of <HI>Devils,</HI> and of <HI>Daemons</HI> and of
<HI>unclean Spirits,</HI> more than any Histories
before, as one would think, if these Sto∣ries
were literally to be understood, that
was the Age in which Christ came, that
<HI>Hell</HI> first broke loose, and then prima∣rily
infested Mankind; and that upon the
Destruction of <HI>Judaea,</HI> and Propagation
of the Gospel, the <HI>Devils</HI> accompanied
the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Dispersion, or the <HI>Apo∣stles</HI>
in their Travels, and have been the
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
Tempters, Seducers, and Tormentors of
other Nations ever since.</P>
<P><HI>Arnobius</HI><NOTE N="33" PLACE="foot">Ante Christum in cogniti &amp; a solo sciento detecti. <HI>In Lib.</HI> II. <HI>adv. G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntes.</HI></NOTE> says, <HI>That before Christ,
Devils were things unknown to the World;</HI>
by which <HI>Arnobius</HI> must mean, either that
they were hardly talk'd of before, or that
their Nature was not understood, till
Christ inform'd us of it. In both these
Senses, I believe, <HI>Arnobius</HI> may be taken,
<HI>viz.</HI> that there was not only little Talk
of <HI>Satan</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> but less of his
Nature apprehended, before <HI>Christ</HI> by his
Parables and parabolical Miracles, rightly
interpreted, instructed us in it. And if
after Ages have departed from the true and
original Doctrine of <HI>Devils,</HI> making a
literal Story of that, which is only mysti∣cal
and cabalistical; and have formed to
themselves <HI>Ideas</HI> of hideous and horrible
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iends, <HI>Mormos</HI> and <HI>Hobgoblins,</HI> it shall

are the Notions of <HI>Divines</HI> of several
Ages past, as well as of the present. I
shall not recount them all here, much less
refute any of them. But there is an anti∣ent,
rational, and cabalistical Notion of
Hell, which I have learned of the Fa∣thers,
who signify, that the babylonish
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
and bewilder'd State of Christ's Church
may be call'd <HI>Hell,</HI> because, as the
Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> does import, it is a State <HI>with∣out
Vision.</HI> Hence <HI>Origen</HI> says,<NOTE N="34" PLACE="foot">Consequens autem est ei, qui cognoscit quae sit Hierusalem in divisione verae Haeredita<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is filio∣rum Israel, ut intelligat Sermonem de Gehenna. <HI>In Matt.

will be dignified with the Title of the
<HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> for her Peace and Visi∣on,
may understand what is meant by
<HI>Hell,</HI> and all that is written of it.</P>
<P>As then the Fathers had a cabalistical
Notion of <HI>Hell,</HI> which modern <HI>Divines</HI>
are Strangers to; so they had of <HI>Satan,</HI>
and the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Angels. I own
myself at a Loss for an express Testimony
out of the Fathers about <HI>Satan</HI> in the
Text before us; but according to their
Explications of <HI>Satan</HI> in other Places, no∣thing
more is meant by him here than,
“That furious Principle and Temper in
Man that is not only averse to Liberty
in Religion, but for binding, restraining,
and tying down the Church and Christ∣ian
People to certain Opinions and Ways
of Worship.” In such a State of Bon∣dage
has the Woman of the Church been
kept, by such a <HI>Satan,</HI> in one Order of Men
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
or other, for all Ages past. And that this is a
right and primitive Notion of <HI>Satan,</HI> I could
prove by Authorities enough. <HI>Origen</HI> tells us

Scripture, which would be Enemies to
Christ's Church; but such Kings never did,
nor would personally exist their Names,
according to Interpretation, standing only

Mankind. To the same Purpose he says

in which they will see the Opinion of the
Fathers about the <HI>Devils</HI> in the Madman,
and afterwards in the Herd of Swine; from
which let them judge, whether the Fathers
could have any other Notion of <HI>Satan</HI>
here, than what I have represented. It
is certain, and may be easily prov'd, that
by <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>Dragon</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI>
mentioned in the <HI>Revelations,</HI> nothing
more is to be understood, than a furious,
persecuting, satanical, and diabolical Tem∣per
in Man; and if what St. <HI>John</HI> writes

the other Assertions of the Evangelists and

in their Enquiries after, and Lucubrations
on Divine Truth. All the Honour that I
aim at in that Work is, by the Help of
the Fathers, to point out that anti-Chri∣stian
Principle or Temper in the <HI>Clergy</HI>
<NOTE N="44" PLACE="foot">Diaboli Forman assumimus—Leonis Per∣sonam induimus &amp; Draconis,—quando crudeles &amp; callidi sumus. <HI>Origen. in Luc. Hom.</HI> viii.</NOTE> which, for its <HI>Averseness</HI> to Liberty,

had been any Thing else than <HI>Man-averse</HI>
to the Will of God.</P>
<P>And thus have I spoken to the Miracle
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s healing the <HI>Woman of her Spi∣rit
of Infirmity, whom Satan had bound
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
and bow'd down,</HI> which, according to
the Letter, is no Miracle at all; and
some Parts of the Story are improbable
and incredible; but the mystical Comple∣tion
of it will be most prodigious, and a
Demonstration not only of Christ's Power
and Presence in his Church, but of his
<HI>Messiaship,</HI> in as much as a vast Number
of Prophecies of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> more
than can soon be collected to this Purpose,
will thereupon receive their Accomplish∣ment.
And so I come to a</P>
<P>3. <HI>Third</HI> miraculous Story of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s,
that is of his telling (<HI>John</HI> iv.) the Wo∣man
of <HI>Samaria</HI> her Fortune, <HI>of having
had five Husbands, and being then an
Adulteress,</HI> &amp;c. in which there is a nota∣ble
Miracle display'd, in the Opinion of
our <HI>Divines,</HI> that proves <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Omnisci∣ence,
or he could not so have search'd
into the Heart of this Woman, and told
her such Occurrences, that concern'd her
Life past. I thought once of transcribing
here entirely this Story; and so I would,
but that it is a long one, and might have
set some Readers, who are by this time
awaken'd to pry into the Absurdities of the
Letter, a laughing, before I had time my
self regularly to animadvert on it.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="55"/>
Whether there was any Truth at all in
the Letter of this Story, I should much
have questioned, but that some Fathers
write of it, as if they believed it literally
tho' they make a mystical and allegorical
Explication of the whole and every part
of it. And I, having a sincere Veneration
for the Fathers, will not contradict them,
(and I hope this Concession will please the
<HI>Clergy)</HI> but, for all that, can't like any
part of this Story literally, but could al∣most
wish, that the Fathers, for the Ho∣nour
of <HI>Jesus,</HI> had made the whole no
other than a Parable.</P>
<P>It's strange, that no <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Infidels</HI>
have as yet ludicrously treated this Story
to the, almost, Confutation of our Reli∣gion.
If their Tongues had not been ty'd
by the aforesaid <HI>Satan</HI> or <HI>Adversary</HI> to
Liberty, I can't think but they must have
made some pleasant Animadversions upon
it before now. If such a broken, ellip∣tical,
and absurd Tale had been told of
any other Impostor in Religion; the Wits
of our <HI>Clergy</HI> had been at Work to expose
it plentifully; and indeed there's no need
of much Wit to make this Tale nauseous
and ridiculous to vulgar Understandings.</P>
<P>I shall not myself here make all the Re∣marks
I can to the Disadvantage of this
Story: I am not as yet so disposed to make
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
Scoffers and <HI>Infidels</HI> laugh at the <HI>Clergy</HI>
for their Adherence to the Letter of it.
All I shall do now, is to make my Obser∣vations
on the two Uses, that the Clergy
very seriously put this Story to, and they
are,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> to prove the Expectation that
there was amongst the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> of a
<HI>Messiah</HI> to come; And</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> to prove <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Omniscience,
or he could not have entered into the Heart
of the Woman, and told her, that she
had had five Husbands, and was then an
Adulteress. To these two Purposes, I
find this Story urged by our <HI>Divines,</HI> and
I must needs say, as to the</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> of them; it is rightly from hence
asserted by the<NOTE N="46" PLACE="foot">Defence of Christianity, <HI>p.</HI> 8.</NOTE> <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lichfield</HI>
and others, that the <HI>Samaritans</HI> had an
Expectation of a <HI>Messiah:</HI> But why then
did not the <HI>Bishop</HI> and others, who are
now in Quest after Arguments of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Messiahship, prove him hence to be the
<HI>Messiah,</HI> because he told the <HI>Samaritan</HI>
Woman her Fortune? If this was a real
and substantial Argument to her of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
<HI>Messiahship,</HI> it ought to be urg'd by the
Clergy at this Day. The Controversy
about <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Messiahship is now on foot;
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
Why do the Advocates for it overlook this
Proof of it? Why, because, as I suppose,
they are aware, that <HI>Infidels</HI> would make
sport with it. But if <HI>Jesus</HI>'s telling the
Woman her Fortune was no real and
conclusive Argument of his being the <HI>Mes∣siah;</HI>
St. <HI>John</HI> has told us an impertinent
Tale of a simple Woman, upon whose
Credulity and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse Notions <HI>Jesus</HI> palm'd
himself as the true <HI>Messiah;</HI> and whether
he did not ill thus to banter and deceive
the Woman, let any one judge.</P>
<P>But let us here behold the Difference
amongst the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans,</HI> as to
the Expectation of a <HI>Messiah.</HI> Some of
the old <HI>Jews,</HI> like the Apostles, expect∣ed
the <HI>Messiah</HI> would be a temporal Prince,
a great Warriour and Conqueror of the
World. Others<NOTE N="47" PLACE="foot">Doctioribus inter Judaeos notissimum est.—quod Moses qui primus fuit Salvator Israe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in omni Vita &amp; Operibus suis fuerit Typus &amp; Figura ultimi Redemptoris. <HI>Christian.

<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
like <HI>Moses</HI> in all Things, and deliver his
People out of another <HI>Egypt:</HI> But here
the <HI>Samaritans</HI> expected he would be a
<HI>Conjurer</HI> and <HI>Fortune-Teller;</HI> or there is
no Sense in what the Woman said to the
Men of the City, <HI>v. 29. Come and see a
Man that has told me all that I have
done,</HI> particularly my Fortune of having
had five Husbands, and being now an
Adulteress, <HI>Is not this the Christ?</HI> What
could she mean, but that the <HI>Messiah</HI>
would be a stroling <HI>Fortune-Teller,</HI> to in∣form
People of the Events of their Lives
past and to come? And <HI>Jesus</HI> to humour
the Woman in her Conception of himself
and of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> says to her, <HI>v.</HI> 26.
<HI>I that speak unto thee, am He.</HI> Whe∣ther
our <HI>Divines</HI> like <HI>Jesus</HI> the better for
this Story of him literally, I can't tell;
but I am sure they dislike the Fortune-telling
Trade at this Day in others, and
believe it to be all Fraud, and are for pu∣nishing
stroling <HI>Gypsys</HI> for Cheats, who
practice it; and in the last Age were in∣tent
on the<NOTE N="49" PLACE="foot">See the Life of <HI>William Lilly.</HI></NOTE> Prosecution of judicial A∣strologers,
who pretended to it: And if
antient History had furnish'd us with an In∣stance
of the Punishment of a pretended
<HI>Fortune-Teller</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
they could not have found Fault with it.
Whether any Accusations were laid against
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
<HI>Jesus</HI> for such his Delusions of the People,
we know not. Evangelical History is silent,
or the <HI>Evangelists</HI> have prudently suppres∣sed
it. But I much wonder, that our
<HI>Gypsys,</HI> from this Story, don't account
themselves the genuine Disciples of <HI>Jesus,</HI>
being endu'd with the like <HI>Gifts,</HI> and ex∣ercising
no worse Arts, than he himself
practised.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Samaritans</HI> did not expect the
<HI>Messiah</HI> would be a <HI>Fortune-Teller;</HI> how
came the Thought into the Woman's Head,
that <HI>Jesus</HI> was the <HI>Messiah,</HI> because he
had told her, her Fortune? What can our
<HI>Divines</HI> say to it? Why, they must either
say, that his telling the Woman her For∣tune
was a real Proof of his <HI>Messiahship;</HI>
or that the Woman was foolish and cre∣dulous,
and drew a false Conclusion; and,
if she had not been an impudent and grace∣less
Whore, would have gone away blush∣ing,
and never have divulg'd, as the Text
supposes she did, her Shame to the Men
of <HI>Sychar,</HI> who too had but little Wit,
or they had never stir'd from their Homes,
to see such a Fortune-Teller upon the Re∣port
of a poor Whore.</P>
<P>But the Men of the City had their For∣tunes
too told them by <HI>Jesus,</HI> and they
concluded him to be the <HI>Messiah</HI> upon it;
or there is no Sense in what they <HI>v. 42. said
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
to the Woman, Now we believe not because
of thy Saying, for we have heard him
ourselves, and know that this is indeed
the Christ:</HI> What could they hear, but
their Fortunes, as the Woman had before?
And if <HI>Jesus,</HI> whose Ability at all fair
Questions in the magic Art I don't que∣stion,
did tell them their Fortunes; I hope
he had more Prudenee than to talk to them
in common of their Fornications and A∣dulteries,
which might occasion domestick
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrs, and the Breach of good Neighbour∣hood
amongst them; but if he directed
any of them to find their lost Cattle, and
help'd them again to their stolen Goods,
he did well, and they alone did amiss, to
conclude thereupon, <HI>that he was indeed
the Christ.</HI> Let our <HI>Divines</HI> now judge
whether I have not made a natural and ex∣cellent
Comment on this part of the Sto∣ry,
which relates to the Expectation and
Opinion, which the <HI>Samaritans</HI> had of a
<HI>Messiah</HI> to come. But,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From this Story literally our
<HI>Divines</HI> prove <HI>Jesus</HI>'s<NOTE N="50" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> on the Place.</NOTE> Omniscience;
and <HI>Cardiognostick</HI> Power to tell what was
in the Hearts and Thoughts of Man. But
how so? Is it because he told a Woman,
that she was an Adulteress, and had had
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
five Husbands? Where's the Consequence?
<HI>Duncan Campbel,</HI> and other <HI>Moor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elds</HI>-judicial-As<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rologers

it might be all Cheat and Fraud in

could not disprove it. If they

Circumstance in this Story, that looks very
ill upon <HI>Jesus,</HI> and is enough to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e

Art, and that is, he seems to draw the
Woman in by a<NOTE N="51" PLACE="foot">Percontando de Viro, Occasionem cepit occulta revelandi. <HI>Sancti Cyril. Alex. in Loc.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Wile</HI> to hear her For∣tune,

<P>And not only the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI>
but the Men of the City, <HI>Sychar,</HI> believ'd
<HI>Jesus</HI> to be the Messiah, <HI>v.</HI> 42, upon what
he said to themselves as well as to her:
So the Ministers of the Letter, who are
<HI>Sycharites,</HI> according to <HI>Origen</HI> and <HI>The∣ophanes
Cerameus,</HI> will be clearly con∣vinced,
and be able to convince others,
that <HI>Jesus is the Christ or Messiah,</HI> when
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
they shall hear, learn and apprehend from
the Spirit of the Law and the Prophets,
that the Church and all she has been do∣ing,
was foretold and prophecy'd of.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Disciples, <HI>v.</HI> 27. are said
<HI>to Marvel that he talk'd with the Wo∣man.</HI>
What in the Name of Wonder, li∣terally,
could be the Meaning of this?
Did they <HI>Marvel</HI> at <HI>Jesus's</HI> Condescention
to speak to a Woman, as if the Sex was
beneath his Care? Or did they <HI>Marvel</HI>
that he who was very bashful, had Cou∣rage
to speak to one? Or did they <HI>Mar∣vel</HI>
at his Conversation with a Whore, for
fear of his being tempted by her? Some
one or other of these must be the <HI>Marvel</HI>
of the <HI>Disciples;</HI> but how absurd and ri∣diculous
they all are, according to the
Letter, let a reasonable Man judge. But
mystically, the true Disciples of our Lord,
who understand the Mysteries of the King∣dom
of Heaven, will, when they are ap∣prized
of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s spiritual Conversation
with his Church, and of all the Things
that she has done according to Prophecy,
<HI>Marvel</HI> with rapturous Astonishment at
the Wisdom and Power of God in the Ac∣complishment
of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>After such a Mystical and Allegorical
Manner, is every minute Circumstance of
this Story of the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Woman to be
<PB N="62" REF="69"/>
apply'd. St. <HI>Augustin</HI><NOTE N="65" PLACE="foot">Magna quidem acta sunt Sacramenta, sed angustum Tempus est, ut omnia pertractentur. <HI>In Serm.</HI> XCI. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2.</NOTE> says there are
so many great Mysteries contai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d in it,
that they require much Time to go through
them all. I find it so, and that no less
than a Vol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me might be written of them,
out of the Fathers. B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t what I have
briefly here touch'd on, is enough to con∣vince
any one of the Absurdities of the
Letter of this Miracle, which cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted in
the telling a Woman her Fortune, and such
a Fortune, as <HI>Jesus</HI> by Craft might come
to the Knowledge of. Therefore, for the
Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> let us look upon the
whole Story as a typical and parabolical
Representation of what would be mysteri∣ously
and more wonderfully done by him.</P>
<P>And thus I have spoken to the three
Miracles, proposed to be treated on in this
Discourse. Before I enter upon my third
general Head, which is, <HI>to consider what
Jesus means when he appeals to his Mi∣racles
as to a Witness of his Divine Au∣thority;</HI>
I must take to Task some more
of his pretended Miracles, even till I have
not left him a good, credible and substan∣tial
Miracle, according to the Letter, to
appeal to. The Consequence of which
will be, that his mysterious Operations
<PB N="63" REF="70"/>
are to prove his Authority and Messiaship;
or we must give up him and his Religion
for a Piece of Fraud and Imposture</P>
<P>What Miracles will be the Subject of
my next Discourse, I can't certainly fore∣tell,
but there are many Historical as well
as miraculous Parts of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Life, that
according to the Letter, are to be call'd
into Question; such as</P>
<P>The History of his riding on an Ass to
<HI>Jerusalem.</HI> I have given some Offence on
this Point already in my <HI>Moderator,</HI> and
ought to excuse or justify my self, by calling
the Fathers to Account for laughing at the
Letter of that Story. It was an untoward
Saying of St. <HI>Jerome,</HI> that I there cited, and
suffered a Prosecution for: But it is a worse
Intimation of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> who,
if there was any literal Truth in the Peo∣ples
pulling off their Garments, and
Branches of Trees, and strewing them in
the Way of <HI>Jesus,</HI> will needs have it not re∣spectfully
but mischievously done, to make
the Colt stumble, and so dismount his Ri∣der.
And according to him it may be q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣stioned,
whether the <HI>Hosannahs</HI> of the
People were of any more Respect to <HI>Jesus,</HI>
than the <HI>Huzzahs</HI> of a <HI>Mob</HI> would be to
the Bishop of <HI>L—n,</HI> if to shew his
Meekness and Lowlyness, he should ride
upon an Ass, in his <HI>Pontificalibus</HI> thro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh
<PB N="64" REF="71"/>
this City. But I have here a momentous
Controversy to decide about the Beast <HI>Je∣sus</HI>
rode on. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> seems to say,
he rode upon both <HI>Ass</HI> and <HI>Colt</HI> together
St. <HI>Mark</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> say, he rode upon
the <HI>Colt, on which Man never before sat.</HI>
The Bishop of <HI>Lichfeild</HI> says, he rode
upon the <HI>Ass</HI> (on which Man had before
sat) and the <HI>Colt</HI> ambled after. St. <HI>Cyril</HI>
and St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> say, he rode upon the
<HI>Colt,</HI> and the <HI>She-Ass</HI> trotted after. St.
<HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangelist</HI> says, he rode upon
a <HI>Mule,</HI> or an <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Ass-like Creature of
the neuter Gender. The <HI>Jewish Cabalists</HI>
say, their <HI>Messiah</HI> was to ride on a great
huge <HI>Ass,</HI> big enough to carry him and
all true Israelites, and that the Ministers
of <HI>Antichrist</HI> would then hang an <HI>A-ss.</HI>
So do the great Doctors of the World
differ! To whom I shall decree the Prize
of Orthodoxy, I shan't foretel; but am
inclined to favour the Opinion of the <HI>Ca∣balists.</HI>
However, I shall be very grave
as well as learned on this Head: And if I
can, I will, to oblige Dr. <HI>Sherl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck,</HI> hook
in a Digression about <HI>Shilo</HI>'s <HI>binding his
Fole to the Vine, and his Asses Coli
to the choice Vine:</HI> The Accomplishment
of which <HI>literal</HI> Prophecy seems to have
been drop'd in the Providence of God, or
<PB N="65" REF="72"/>
the <HI>Dean</HI> of <HI>Chichester</HI><NOTE N="67" PLACE="foot">In his Dissertation on the Blessing of <HI>Ju∣dah.</HI></NOTE> had never
stopt at it. I will endeavour to look it up,
in some Corner of History, if it be but to me∣rit
the Praises of the <HI>Master</HI> of the <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>I must also sometime take into Consi∣deration
the Story of <HI>Jusus</HI>'s Abode in
the Wilderness, forty Days, in Compa∣ny
of the <HI>Devil,</HI> who tempted him. This
literally, as our <HI>Divines</HI> understand it, is
a Scandalous Story. The <HI>Jews,</HI> in our
Saviour's Time, said, that through <HI>Belze∣bub,</HI>
he cast out <HI>Devils;</HI> and their Po∣sterity
have asserted, that he learn'd the
Magick Art of a <HI>Daemon.</HI> This Story
gives too much Grounds for such a Suspi∣cion.
Our <HI>Divines,</HI> who should know
best, talk of abundance of Mischief, the
<HI>Devil</HI> has been permitted to do in the
World ever since; I hope it was not by
Compact and Agreement between them;
but it would have been of some Satisfacti∣on
to the Contrary, if the <HI>Evangelist</HI> had
told us expresly upon what Terms they
mett and parted. As Fables go, it is said
to the Honour of St. <HI>Dunstan,</HI> that he
took the <HI>Devil</HI> by the Nose, when he
tempted him; and if <HI>Jesus</HI> had taken him
by the <HI>Collar,</HI> and thrust him into his
<PB N="66" REF="73"/>
<HI>Dungeon,</HI> and there chain'd him, and shut
<HI>Hell-Gates</HI> upon him; I appeal to honest
plain Christians, whether such an <HI>Herc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣lean</HI>
Labour would not have pleased them
well. Ever since I read of <HI>Martin Lu∣ther</HI>'s
Conversation with the <HI>Devil,</HI> I have
had but indifferent Thoughts of his <HI>Pro∣testantism;</HI>
and unless the Fathers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
this Story before us into Mystery, Allego∣ry
and Cabalism, I shall think ill of Chri∣stianity.</P>
<P>I should also take into Examination the
Story of an Angel's appearing to the Shep∣herds,
and saying to them; <HI>Behold I
bring you Tidings of great Joy,</HI> &amp;c. If
there was any Truth literally in <HI>this</HI> Sto∣ry,
and in <HI>that</HI> of a Star's appearing to
the wise Men, there must be a great Mi∣stake
in the Report of both of them. St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Luke</HI> have both blun∣der'd.
It was the Star that appear'd to
the Shepherds by Night; and the Angel
(I speak upon Reason and Authority) that
was sent to the wise Men. What then
to do with these two Stories, and to salve
the Credit of the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> I knew
not, till the Fathers directed me to the
Use of a mythological <HI>Metamorphosis:</HI>
And then I presently learn'd the Trick
on't, to transform Stars into Angels, and
Shepherds too, or Pastors of Christ's Flock
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
(which was the Difficulty) into wise Men;
and so I made one Moral or Mistery of
the two Fables.</P>
<P>I must also some Time take to task the
Story of the <HI>many dead Bodies of the
Saints, that upon Christ's Resurrection,
came out of their Graves, and appear'd
unto many;</HI> which is too imperfectly re∣lated
to merit Credit. The <HI>Evangelist,</HI>
if he would have a reasonable Man believe
his Story, should have told us, who those
Saints were, and what Numbers of them;
and whether they appear'd to the converted
or unconverted <HI>Jews;</HI> whether they were
some of the Patriarchs and Prophets of old,
or some lately departed Disciples, who, for
all <HI>Jesus's</HI> healing Power, died in the
Time of his Ministry; and whether there
were any Women among those Saints; and
whether they appear'd naked (as <HI>Jesus</HI>
modestly did to <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> unless he
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip'd himself by <HI>Stealth</HI> into the Cloths
of the Gardener, which might be the Reason
of her Mistake, for she suppos'd she saw
the Gardener) and whether they return'd
again to Corruption, or ascended into
Heaven. For want of these specifical Cir∣cumstances,
the <HI>Evangelist</HI> has told us a
Tale, that has neither Head nor Foot to it:
and unless the Fathers mystically answer,
to Satisfaction, every one of the aforesaid
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
<HI>Queries,</HI> I'll reject this Story for mere Ro∣mance
and Imposture.</P>
<P>These and many other historical and
seemingly miraculous Stories of the Gospel,
are some time to be taken into Considera∣tion;
for I will not give this Work over,
till I have demonstrated beyond all Con∣tradiction,
that the evangelical Writings
are but the Shadow of Divine Mysteries;
and that literal Interpreters, whom<NOTE N="68" PLACE="foot">Ut Lex Um bram continet futurorum bono∣rum, quae declarantur ab ea Lege; sic etiam E∣vangelium, quod vel a quibusque vulgaribus intel∣ligi existimatur, Umbram docet Mysteriorum Christi. <HI>In Praefat. ad Johan. Evang.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Origen</HI> calls <HI>vulgar Capacities,</HI> are under
a Mistake, if they think, they understand
any Thing, as they ought, of the four
Gospels.</P>
<P>I should conclude now, as it becomes a
<HI>Moderator,</HI> with an Address to <HI>Infidels</HI>
and <HI>Apostates,</HI> the great Combatants in
this Controversy. But I have not Room
to be as large, as I would, in my Exhor∣tations
to them distinctly, so I can only
desire them to continue the Controversy
with Zeal and Vigour, not doubting but
it will end to the Honour of Jesus, the
Good of his Church, and the Happiness
of Mankind. The blessed Fruits of this
Controversy are already seen and selt in
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
the almost Cure of a most malignant Di∣stemper,
call'd <HI>Bigottry,</HI> which has been
the Bane of human Society, and in Times
past more destructive of the World than
either War or Pestilence. Go on then,
<HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Good Sirs,</HI> till the Cure is per∣fected.
And as you merit Praises and Re∣wards
for your several Labours; So I hope
you'll meet with them. The <HI>Nobility</HI>
and <HI>Gentry</HI> of the Kingdom, as I learn,
are sensibly touch'd with the Usefulness of
this Controversy; whereupon it is to be
hoped the <HI>Legislative Authority</HI> will soon
give Thanks to the great Mr. <HI>Grounds</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Scheme</HI> for their Pains in it; and not
forget to do Justice to the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI>
according to their Merits. But I can't stay
here to talk more on this Head, being
obliged to make an Epistolary</P>
<P><HI>P. S.</HI> To Mr. <HI>T. Ray,</HI> the Author of
a <HI>Discourse,</HI> call'd <HI>Our Saviour's Mira∣cles
vindicated,</HI> &amp;c. As I, <HI>Sir,</HI> enter'd
the <HI>Press,</HI> you came forth, or I might
possibly have paid more of my Respects to
you another Way. But upon mature Con∣sideration,
I found a properer Reply could
not be made to you, than is the foregoing
Discourse; which, if you are not sick of
your former Performance, will find you
some more Work. And that you may
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
write more pertinently against this Dis∣course,
than you did against my other,
I'll give you some Instructions, <HI>viz.</HI> if you
think of writing to the Purpose, you must
prove these two Things; <HI>First,</HI> that the
Fathers did not hold the Stories of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s
Miracles to be typical and figurative; and
<HI>Secondly,</HI> that <HI>Jesus</HI>'s Miracles neither
will nor can receive a mysterious and more
wonderful Accomplishment. But you have
not said one Syllable to either of these
Points; consequently have written nothing
to the Purpose against me. As for In∣stance;
In the Miracle of <HI>Jesus</HI>'s <HI>driving
the Buyers and Sellers out of the Temple:</HI>
You should prove, <HI>First,</HI> that the Fathers
don't hold that Miracle to be typical of
the future Ejection of <HI>Bishops, Priests,</HI>
and <HI>Deacons</HI> out of the Church, that
make Merchandize of the Gospel: And <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
that it was impossible that the Mi∣racle
should receive such an Accomplish∣ment.
But you have done nothing of this.
So, if you should attempt again to write
against this Discourse, as for Instance, a∣gainst
my Explication of the Miracle of
<HI>Jesus</HI>'s healing the Woman, that <HI>had an
Issue of Blood;</HI> you must prove that <HI>that</HI>
Story neither was in the Opinion of the
Fathers Typical, nor could receive a my∣stical
Accomplishment; or you may as
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
well hold your Peace. And after all, whe∣ther
your Reasonings for the Letter of
Christ's Miracles, are equal to mine against
it, let our Readers judge, who will easily
discern, that you jump over my choicest
Invectives against the Letter, as if you was
afraid of being touch'd by them.</P>
<P>As to your charging me falsly in one or
two Places, with Misrepresentations of
the Fathers, I'll expostulate that Matter
with you, when I hear that the <HI>Bishop</HI> of
<HI>London</HI> gives your Performance, the Repu∣tation
of a solid, and substantial one, by
a Change of your <HI>Cloak</HI> into a <HI>Gown,</HI>
which you seem to aim at; or you had
never so besmear'd the <HI>Bishop</HI> with your
Compliments, nor had been so mealy∣mouth'd
as to the Point of Liberty.</P>
<P>But what need you, <HI>Sir,</HI> have told the
World, that you take me for an <HI>Unbeliev∣er
of the Scriptures.</HI> If the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s
wise Prosecution of me for an <HI>Infidel</HI> had
not given you the Hint, you could never
of your self have made that Discovery.
And why did you not join the Fathers
with me in Unbelief? I thought I had
been of the same Faith with them. A
Man of your Penetration into another's
Principles, will, I suppose, from this
present going Discourse, conclude me to be
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
a downright <HI>Atheist.</HI> And what must I do
then to clear my self!</P>
<P>If you write any more, <HI>Sir,</HI> I desire
you, without making more Haste than
good Speed, to be as expeditious as yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
can; or you will not prevent my Pub∣lication
of another Discourse, like these
two, to the Honour of <HI>Jesus,</HI> to whom
be Glory for ever and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
