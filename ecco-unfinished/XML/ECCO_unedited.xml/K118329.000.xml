<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT</HI> is become an universal Complaint, that the Accounts of <HI>OXFORD</HI>, hitherto published, are full of <HI>Mistakes</HI>, and <HI>Misrepresentations.— ANTHONY WOOD</HI> was an <HI>Antiquarian</HI> and an <HI>Old Woman:</HI> Mr. <HI>SALMON</HI>, Author of the <HI>Present State of the Universities</HI>, is a <HI>Cambridge-Man:</HI> and that the Reverend Mr. <HI>POINTER</HI>, Rector of Slapton in Northamptonshire, was but little acquainted with our <HI>Academical Annals</HI>, is evident from his supposing the <HI>MALLARD</HI> of <HI>All-Souls</HI> College to be a <HI>GOOSE</HI>.</P>
<P>The judicious and ingenious Author of the <HI>Pocket Companion for Oxford</HI>, has, in some measure done Justice to this entertaining Subject: but perhaps he has <HI>copied</HI> some of his Predecessors <HI>too closely:</HI> On which Account, we are inclined to prefer the <HI>OXFORD GUIDE</HI>, as a more <HI>comprehensive</HI> and
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
<HI>original Work</HI>.—But, notwithstanding, both these Authors, like the rest, out of Neglect or Ig∣norance, have omitted, among other Curiosities, several <HI>important Particulars</HI>, equally calculated to engage the Notice, and interest the Attention of Strangers.</P>
<P>To rectify these <HI>Mistakes</HI>, but more particularly to supply these <HI>Omissions</HI>, is the Design of the following Work. And we can venture to affirm, that the Book we now offer, when bound up with the <HI>Oxford Guide</HI>, will exhibit a more <HI>complete Survey</HI> of <HI>OXFORD</HI> than any yet extant. — In a Word, that useful Performance, improved with the Accession of this <HI>necessary SUPPLEMENT</HI>, will give all the Satisfaction which an agreeable Subject can afford, or an inquisitive Curiosity can require.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Companion</HI> to the Guide, AND A <HI>Guide</HI> to the Companion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ANTIQUARIANS, in general, seem to have mistaken the etymology of <HI>Bellositum</HI>, the reputed Roman name of the City of <HI>Oxford</HI>. The Reverend Mr. <HI>Pointer</HI>, in his manuscript notes on Rishanger, who flourished in the reign of Henry the Third, writes this word <HI>Bulositum</HI>, and derives it from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>The City of Wisdom.</HI> This derivation I cannot entirely approve; but must own, that it has suggested a manner of
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
spelling the word, which, I take to be right, viz. <HI>Bullositum</HI>.—<Q>Mr. Hearne informs us, and indeed the common name <HI>Oxford</HI> implies the same, “that a part of the river <HI>Isis</HI> near the town was the most considerable <HI>Ford</HI> ”in England for the passage of <HI>Oxen</HI>.</Q> And why not likewise for <HI>Bulls?</HI>—I readily agree with that judicious author, that <HI>Oxford</HI> is never written <HI>Ouseford</HI>, or <HI>Iseford</HI>, in the Saxon annals, or in William of Newburgh; and that the ad∣jacent parish of <HI>Binsey</HI>, where the principal ford is supposed to have been, ought to be called, according to it's ancient Latin name, <HI>Busneia</HI>, BUSNEY, from the Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, an <HI>Ox.</HI> But it should be remembered, that there are many <HI>hindred appellations</HI> in and about <HI>Oxford</HI>, which conduce to illustrate and confirm my hypothesis. Need I mention <HI>Bullington</HI> Hundred, in which <HI>Oxford</HI> is situated, <HI>Bullock's Lane</HI>, and <HI>Bull∣stock Bridge?</HI> — Are not our frequent Bull baitings in <HI>Oxford</HI> standing memorials of this <HI>original</HI> Denomination? The same Antiquarian, in his learned preface to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 18, 19.</NOTE> <HI>Robert of Gloucester</HI>, has certainly given a wrong interpretation of the origin of a custom still subsisting at <HI>Oxford</HI>, which plainly regards the point in question. His words are these. <Q>“'Tis no wonder that in the
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
jollities of the first of May, formerly the cus∣tom of blowing with, and drinking in, horns, so much prevailed: which, tho' it be now generally disused, yet the custom of blowing them prevails at that season, even to this day, at Oxford; to remind the people of that part of the year, which ought to create mirth and gaiety; such as is sketched out in some old books of offices, such as the Primer of Sa∣lisbury, ”&amp;c.</Q> I leave it to the reader to draw the proper inference from this passage; and shall add, that I do not mean, by what I have advanced, to <HI>exclude</HI> Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>'s hypothesis. Why may we not suppose, by way of reconci∣ling both opinions, that the Ford was common to <HI>horned</HI> cattle in general? Nay that even <HI>Cows</HI> had more concern in this case than is commonly supposed, seems very probable from the name of the neighbouring village, <HI>Cowley</HI>.</P>
<P>Having thrown new light on a circumstance which has occasioned so much dispute, the discussion of which was a proper introduction to the ensuing history, I now proceed to a parti∣cular description.</P>
<P>It is well known, that before Colleges were established, the Students were lodged in private houses: at length places were set apart for
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
their reception, under the appellation of <HI>Hos∣pitia</HI>, or <HI>Hostels</HI>; in other words Inns, or Tip∣ling Houses; or, as our colleges are at present, <HI>Places of Entertainment</HI>. Many of these still subsist, and retain their original occupation. Modern writers, indeed, mention no more than Twenty Colleges, and Five Halls, in this ex∣tensive Seat of Learning: But from a diligent enquiry, I have discovered no less than
<LIST>
<HEAD>TWELVE HALLS, Never yet enumerated or described; namely,</HEAD>
<ITEM>TIT-UP HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CLAY HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CABBAGE HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>CATERPILLAR HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>STUMP HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>LEMON HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>FOX HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>FEATHER HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>KETTLE HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>TRIPE HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>WESTMINSTER HALL,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Lastly, to these we must add, KIDNEY HALL,</ITEM>
</LIST>
Which has been long in esteem as a noted <HI>Seminary</HI>; and has lately been re-founded by the Name of DIAMOND HALL.</P>
<P>With these HALLS we must mention a Thirteenth, formely distinguished by the name of REDCOCK HALL: This House has been
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
for some years unhappily alienated from the purposes of Literature, and is at present inha∣bited by two widow gentlewomen.</P>
<P>The notion is equally erroneous with regard to the number of our LIBRARIES. Besides those of <HI>Radcliffe, Bodley</HI>, and the private col∣leges, there have of late years been many Libraries founded in our <HI>Coffee-Houses</HI>, for the benefit of such of the Academics as have neg∣lected, or lost, their Latin and Greek. In these useful Repositories, <HI>Grown-Gentlemen</HI> are accom∣modated with the <HI>Cyclopaedia</HI>, in the most expe∣ditious and easy manner.—The MAGAZINES afford History, Divinity, Philosophy, Mathe∣matics, Geography, Astronomy, Biography, Arts, Sciences, and Poetry.—The REVIEWS, form the complete Critic, without consulting the dry rules of Aristotle, Quintilian, and Bossu; and enable the Student to pass his judgment on volumes which he never read, after the most compendious method. —NOVELS supply the place of experience, and give lectures of In∣trigue and Gallantry. — OCCASIONAL POEMS diffuse the itch of rhyming, and happily tempt many a young fellow to forsake Logic, turn <HI>smart</HI>, and commence Author, either in the Pastoral, Lyric, or Elegiac way. — POLITICAL PAM∣PHLETS teach the inexpediency of Continental
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Connections; that for the punishment of French Perfidy, we should wage perpetual war with that nation; and that our Conquests in America will raise the jealousy of <HI>all Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>As there are here Books suited to every Taste, so there are Liquors adapted to every species of reading. Amorous Tales may be perused over <HI>Arrack Punch</HI> and <HI>Jellies</HI>; Insipid Odes, over <HI>Orgeat</HI> or <HI>Capilaire</HI>; Politics, over <HI>Coffee</HI>; Divi∣nity, over <HI>Port</HI>; and Defences of bad Generals, and bad Ministers, over <HI>Whipt Syllabubs</HI>. In a word, in these Libraries Instruction and Plea∣sure go hand in hand; and we may pronounce, in a literal sense, that Learning remains no longer a <HI>dry</HI> pursuit.</P>
<P>The most ancient and considerable of these, is that in New-College-Lane, founded by the memorable Mr. <HI>Johnson</HI>. He was accordingly constituted the first Librarian, and upon his re∣tiring to the <HI>Isle of Wight</HI>, for the private pur∣suit of his Studies, was succeeded by Librarian <HI>Hadley</HI>, who, though now removed, still ac∣commodates <HI>Students</HI> on their way to <HI>London:</HI> and a <HI>female</HI> Librarian at present fills this im∣portant department with applause.</P>
<P>With regard to the <HI>Manuscripts</HI> of these Libraries, they are oblong folios, bound in
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
parchment, lettered on the plan of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Common Place Book; are written by, and kept under the sole care of the Librarian. These Manuscripts, which in process of time amount to many volumes, are carefully preserved in the <HI>Archives</HI> of each respective Library.</P>
<P>That the reader may not be surprized at our mentioning a female Librarian in <HI>Oxford</HI>, (which indeed would be less extraordinary if Fellows of Colleges were allowed to marry) it must be remarked, that the other Libraries, established on this plan, viz. <HI>James</HI>'s, <HI>Tom</HI>'s, <HI>John</HI>'s, &amp;c. are also conducted by Females; who, though properly the <HI>Sub-Librarians</HI>, have usurped the right of their Husbands in the exe∣cution of this office.</P>
<P>The SCHOOLS of this University are also more numerous than is commonly supposed; among which we must reckon three spacious and superb Edifices, situated to the southward of the High-Street, 100 feet long, by 30 in breadth, vulgarly called <HI>Tennis Courts</HI>, where <HI>Exercise</HI> is regularly performed both morning and afternoon. Add to these, certain Schools, familiarly denominated <HI>Billiard Tables</HI>, where the <HI>Laws of Motion</HI> are exemplified, and which may be considered as a necessary supplement to
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
our Courses of Experimental Philosophy. Nor must we omit the many <HI>Nine-pin</HI> and <HI>Skittle Alleys</HI>, open and dry, for the instruction of Scholars in Geometrical Knowledge, and par∣ticularly, for proving the <HI>centripetal</HI> principle.</P>
<P>Other SCHOOLS, and places of Academical Discipline, not generally known as such, may be mentioned. — The <HI>Peripatetics</HI> execute the Courses proper to their System upon the <HI>Parade</HI>. NAVIGATION is learnt on the <HI>Isis</HI>; GUNNERY on the adjacent Hills; HORSEMANSHIP on <HI>Port-Meadow, Bullington-Green</HI>, the <HI>Henley, Wycombe, Woodstock, Abingdon</HI>, and <HI>Banbury</HI> Roads. The <HI>Axis in Peritrochio</HI> is admirably illustrated by a <HI>Scheme</HI> in a <HI>Phaeton</HI>. The Doctrine of the SCREW is practically explained most evenings in the private Rooms, together with the <HI>Motion of Fluids</HI>.</P>
<P>An inquisitive observer must likewise have remarked many Public Edifices, and other Curi∣osities, too frequently, but unjustly, neglected and overlooked, which ornament our streets The first I shall take notice of, is, that formi∣dable cruciform Structure of Wood, in the <HI>Corn-Market</HI>; having three rotund apertures on the vertical, or traverse, <HI>Head-Board</HI>. — It i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> surprizing that this Edifice should have so long

<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<HEAD>This Structure formerly stood on the South Side of <HI>Carfax Conduit;</HI> from whence it was removed to the <HI>City-Hill</HI>, as a more convenient Situation, in the <HI>MAYORALTY</HI> of <HI>THOMAS MUNDAY, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR></HI> Anno <HI>M.DCC.XLIX.</HI></HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
escaped observation in a Place of Literature: An Edifice, with which the Learned, and parti∣cularly the Poets, according to Mr. <HI>Pope</HI>, have been often <HI>closely connected</HI>.</P>
<P>Nearly contiguous to this Edifice, stands another less elevated Pile, constructed of the same materials, but better calculated for <HI>Society</HI>; though instituted upon the Principles of <HI>Sobriety</HI>. In both of these respectively, as the Statute in that case directs, Offenders <HI>manibus pedibusque plectuntur</HI>. But we refer the reader to the Prints annexed, which are delineated with the utmost accury.</P>
<P>In this neighbourhood, adjoining to the East End of <HI>Carfax Church</HI>, are to be found the imperfect Traces of a Place properly de∣dicated to the MUSES, and described in our Statutes, by the familiar but forbidding deno∣mination of PENNYLESS-BENCH. History and Tradition, report, that many eminent Poets have been <HI>Benchers</HI> here. To this <HI>Seat</HI> of the Muses, we are most probably indebted for that celebrated Poem, the <HI>Splendid Shilling</HI> of Phillips: And that the Author of the PANEGYRIC <HI>on Oxford Ale</HI>, was no Stranger to this inspiring <HI>Bench</HI>, may be concluded from
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
these Verses, where he addresses the God, or Goddess, of TICKING,
<Q><L>"Beneath thy shelter <HI>Pennyless</HI> I quaff</L>
<L>"The cheering Cup." —</L></Q></P>
<P>We wish some future Genius may arise, to lament the change which Modern Barbarism has produced in this valuable Antiquity. — Nothing which formerly belonged to it now remains, except two ferocious Warriors, clad in Coats of Mail, originally placed above, to admonish the <HI>Loiterers</HI>, by their significant strokes at just intervals, of the rapid flight of Time; as is represented in the annexed Cut.</P>
<P>The original Pavement of the <HI>Classic</HI> Ground beneath, has not indeed been destroyed; but the <HI>Seat</HI> itself has been rudely torn away, and the Hospitable Covering which formerly pro∣tected the Sons of Contemplative Indigence, is at present abridged to an useless scanty <HI>Border</HI>, which looks like an <HI>Apology</HI> for the Devastation <HI>committed</HI> upon the former venerable Canopy.</P>
<P>At no very great distance, in the High-street, we find an antique COLUMN of a tetragonal construction, opposite to a venerable Gothic
<FIGURE>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
</FIGURE>
<FIGURE>
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
Building, called the <HI>Black Pot House</HI>. This Column, at present supplies the neighbouring inhabitants with Water, by means of an Engine artfully inclosed in the midst of it; and as it still retains on it's top, two distinct Heads or Bustos, has acquired the vulgar appellation of the <HI>Two-faced Pump</HI>. — Various have been the Conjectures of the Learned concerning this in∣estimable Piece of Antiquity. The late indus∣trious and indefatigable Dr. <HI>Rawlinson</HI> affirms it to have been a complete and genuine <HI>Roman</HI> PRIAPUS, but suspects that the <HI>Members</HI> have been impaired <HI>vitio Temporis</HI>. Others imagine that the <HI>double Front</HI> indicates a Statue of JANUS: But the most reasonable Hypothesis seems to be that of the truly ingenious Author of the MALLARD, who has discovered, that this Column is a just Matrimonial Emblem; as it plainly exhibits the Faces of a Man and Woman, but of a very <HI>sour Aspect</HI>, and <HI>reverted from each other</HI>. This Hieroglyphic, he con∣ceives is coeval with the University; and justly supposes, that it was here erected in the most public part of the Place, as a monitory <HI>Memento</HI> to the Gownsmen, recommending <HI>Celibacy</HI>, and a <HI>monastic Life</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19"/>Besides these curious particulars, observable in the Principal Streets, there are many others in the remote parts of the Town, which equally deserve illustration. — Science diffuses it's benign influence over the Suburbs of <HI>Oxford</HI>; in which stands a famous College, founded as early as the Conquest, where WISDOM may be truly said to preside. The Students of this House are always <HI>resident</HI>, and are lectured in ETHICS a∣lone, on the subjects of <HI>Temperance, Humility, Patience</HI>, and other Virtues proper to Students of this Class. — Before the College-Gates, is the Place, where the first Process is performed on Bodies intended for the <HI>Anatomical Lectures</HI>.</P>
<P>Westward of this <HI>College</HI> is the <HI>Dentrific Elaboratory</HI> of the celebrated <HI>Professor</HI> WEBB. The Portico is decorated with a <HI>symbolical Painting</HI>, and an <HI>explanatory Inscription</HI>. This distinguished <HI>Dentist</HI>, and <HI>Dentologist</HI>, co-operates with his Brother Professors, in the arduous and important Business, according to Mr. <HI>Paul Jullian</HI>'s phrase, of <HI>Rectifying Deficient Heads</HI>.</P>
<P>In this Quarter of the Town, the Curious are likewise invited to visit an antique Pothouse, known by the Historical Sign of <HI>Whittington and his Cat</HI>. Here that laborious Antiquarian,
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Mr. <HI>Thomas Hearn</HI>, one evening, suffered him∣self to be overtaken in Liquor. But it should be remembered, that this Accident was more owing to his Love of Antiquity than of Ale. It happened that the Kitchen where He and his Companion were sitting, was neatly paved with <HI>Sheep's Trotters</HI>, disposed in various Compartments. After one Pipe, Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>, consistently with his usual Gravity and Sobriety, proposed to depart; but his Friend, who was inclined to enjoy more of his Company, art∣fully observed, that the Floor on which they were then sitting, was no less than an original <HI>tessellated Roman Pavement</HI>. Out of respect to Classic Ground, and on recollection that the <HI>Stunsfield Roman Pavement</HI>, on which he had just published a Dissertation, was dedicated to <HI>Bacchus</HI>, our Antiquary chearfully complied: an enthu∣siastic Transport seized his Imagination; he fell on his knees, and kissed the sacred earth, on which, in a few hours, and after a few tan∣kards, by a sort of Sympathetic Attraction, he was obliged to repose for some part of the evening. His Friend was probably in the same condition: but two Printers accidentally coming in, conducted Mr. <HI>Hearn</HI>, betwixt them, to <HI>Edmund Hall</HI>, with much state and solemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21"/>As an Appendage to a Parish Church in the Northern Suburb, we find a small, but com∣modious Structure, dedicated to <HI>Hymen</HI>, whose Votaries are here kindly introduced to the Mysteries of that Deity, and receive their first Passport. The Officer to whom the care of this hallowed Edifice is committed, is an inhabi∣tant of the Neighbourhood, and, by the force of an happy Invention, has emblematically de∣corated the Entrance of his House with a <HI>Pair of Fetters</HI>.</P>
<P>Having now specified various Curiosities, entirely omitted by former Writers on this Sub∣ject, I shall proceed to rectify their Mistakes and Misrepresentations, as well as supply their other Deficiencies.</P>
<P><Q>We are told in that agreeable little History, the <HI>Pocket Companion for Oxford</HI>, “that <HI>William Fitz Alan</HI>, Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI>, left large Bene∣factions to the Society of <HI>Magdalen College</HI>, on condition of their celebrating <HI>daily Masses</HI> ”for his Soul; and the Writer justly adds, that “these <HI>Masses</HI> have been disused since the ”<HI>Reformation.</HI></Q> This sly suggestion has, at first sight, the appearance of charging the Fel∣lows of <HI>this College</HI>, in particular, with open <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to their Benefactor: Whereas he might have observed, with equal truth, that the
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
very same <HI>ungrateful</HI> neglect with regard to <HI>Masses</HI> for the <HI>Dead</HI> is, without the least <HI>scruple</HI> permitted at <HI>New College, All Souls, Trinity, Corpus</HI>, and other Colleges founded in the <HI>Times of Popery</HI>.</P>
<P>The same Author seems mistaken in his account of <HI>Christ Church</HI>, where he insinuates, that the <HI>Cathedral</HI> is turned into a <HI>Chapel</HI>. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The Cathedral Church serves as a Chapel to the College." p. 90.</NOTE> In a Place of Religious Education this indeed is somewhat alarming; however, if the Fact be true, it is well the <HI>Transformation</HI> is no <HI>worse</HI>.— In <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Time Churches suffered a still more extraordinary change, and were converted to the <HI>vilest Purposes</HI>. — May those who wish well to the University rather live to see all our <HI>Chapels</HI> turned into <HI>Churches!</HI></P>
<P>However, while we are speaking of Churches, we must do this Author the justice to declare, that his account of St. <HI>Mary</HI>'s Church is not less accurate than entertaining. Among other particulars he acquaints his Reader, that an Archdeacon of <HI>Berks</HI> gave an Organ to this Church, <HI>"to be played upon in the same."</HI></P>
<P>The History and Antiquity of <HI>Mulbery Trees</HI> is a subject on which the same Writer has em∣ployed
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
much labour. <Q>He surprizes us with a most unparalleled Anecdote of the Mulberry Tree at <HI>New College</HI>; which, after being “dia∣metrically fawn asunder at both ends, put ”forth luxuriant branches.</Q> This miraculous article of Natural Knowledge led us to examine the Age and Present State of those which he mentions at <HI>Lincoln College</HI>.— <Q>“They were planted, says he, at the expence of Dr. <HI>Fitz∣herbert Adams</HI>, Rector of the College, A. D. 1686; they are remarkably large, and are ”said to bear excellent fruit.</Q> On visiting these venerable Vegetables, within these two years, instead of this <HI>flourishing condition</HI>, I found one of them a naked Trunk, without Branches.— Nor has he done complete justice to the <HI>Lincoln Devil</HI>; for he suggests that this <HI>grotesque figure</HI> may be most commodiously seen from a spot near the said Mulberry Trees: But from an at∣tentive Survey, I have discovered, that the true Point of Sight, for contemplating to advantage, the tremendous aspect, and threatening attitude of this expressive Hieroglyphic, is from the south east Angle of <HI>Jesus College</HI>.</P>
<P>Having mentioned <HI>Jesus College</HI>, it is our Duty to remark, that a proper attention has not yet been paid to the magnificent Present
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
of the late Sir <HI>Watkins William Wynne</HI>, Bart. The <HI>Punch-Bowl</HI> given by that Gentleman to the College, contains Ten Gallons; and this Piece of Plate has, it is true, been often de∣scribed: but the <HI>Ladle</HI>, its <HI>Companion</HI>, which holds a full <HI>Winchester Half Pint</HI>, has been always unjustly, for what Reason we know not, overlooked; though it is an established custom, when Strangers visit the Bursary, where this Bowl is kept, to fill the <HI>Ladle</HI> alone to the Memory of the worthy Donor.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hearne</HI>, already mentioned with Honour in this Work, could never be prevailed on to pass through the <HI>Turl</HI>, after the unfortunate de∣molition of that venerable Arch, the Remains of a Postern-Gate, which formerly stood at its Entrance: I, though a professed Antiquarian, am not so scrupulous; but shall readily take ad∣vantage of the shortest Way, from <HI>Jesus College</HI> to <HI>Trinity</HI>. — <Q>Here the accurate Author of the <HI>Pocket Companion</HI> informs us, that the Roof of the Chapel is ornamented with a “curious ”<HI>Deceptio Visûs</HI>, or Deception of the Sight.</Q> I am apt to conjecture, that this Error is not to be imputed to the Author, but that the Information was communicated by some <HI>Trinity-Gentleman</HI>; which, it must be owned, was <HI>ungenerous</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="25"/>In his entertaining Description of the <HI>Gardens</HI> of the same College, this Topographer seems perplexed in accounting for the Existence of a large Toad, found alive in sawing asunder a massy Block of Stone, at the Time of building the Piers of the Gate. His Words are, <Q>“This Toad, for aught we know, might have been here ever since the Deluge. But this is a Point to be discussed by Naturalists, to whom ”I leave it.</Q>—As the Elucidation of a Circum∣stance of such Public Utility must be of the ut∣most Consequence, I take this Opportunity of apprising that Author, before his next Edition, that the <HI>British Musaeum</HI> contains a valuable M S. of Dr. <HI>Plott</HI>, in which among other Subjects, equally interesting, is to be found a masterly Dissertation on the Longaevity of <HI>Antediluvian Toads</HI>. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This MS. has many Drawings of Stones in an unusual Shape: And there is a whole Chapter on Stones of that Class, of which an extraordinary one is described, in his <HI>Natural History of Oxfordshire</HI>, viz.— <Q>“The <HI>Didymoides</HI> found in the Quarries of Rubble-stone, near Shotover Hill, having upon it both the <HI>Rugosity</HI> and <HI>Suture</HI> of the <HI>Scrotum:</HI>—Of which, ”out of Modesty, I have given no Sculpture.</Q></P><P>Edit. 1705. pag. 132. ch. v. §. 155.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26"/>It is vulgarly supposed, that the custom of ushering in the Boar's Head, at <HI>Queen's College</HI>, with an antient Monkish Ballad, arose from a memorable atchievement of a Taberdar of that House; who is said to have killed a Wild Boar in the forest of <HI>Shotover</HI>, by ramming <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s System of Logic down the Throat of the Mon∣ster. But the Song was, in ancient Times, a <HI>Christmas Carol</HI> all over the Kingdom; and I shall take this opportunity of inserting here an original and correct Copy of it, from Mr. <HI>Hearn</HI>'s Notes and Spicilege on <HI>William of New∣burg</HI>, together with his introductory Remarks.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Reynard the Fox</HI> was one of the first things printed in England, being done by the famous William Caxton in the year 1481. It was an admirable thing; and the Design being political, and to represent a wise Government, was equally good: So little reason is there to look upon this as a poor despicable book. Nor is there more reason to esteem <HI>The merry Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham</HI>, (which was much valued and cried up in Henry the Eighth's time, tho' now sold at Ballad Singers Stalls, the Author whereof was Dr. Andrew Borde) as altogether a Romance; a certain skilful Person having told me more than once, that he was assured by one of <HI>Gotham</HI>, that

they formerly held Lands there by such Sports and Customs as are touched upon in this book: for which reason I think particular Notice should have been taken of it in <HI>Blount's Te∣nures</HI>, as I do not doubt but there would, had that otherwise curious Author been apprised of the matter. But 'tis strange to see the Changes that have been made in the Book of <HI>Reynard the Fox</HI>, from the original Edition. I shall not give other Instances of Alterations in Old English Pieces, only I will beg leave here to give an exact Copy of the Christmas Carol upon the Boar's Head (which is an ancient Dish, and was brought up by King Henry I. with Trumpets before his Son, when his said Son was crowned) as I have it in an Old Fragment (for I usually preserve even Fragments of Old Books) of the Christ∣mas Carols printed by Wynkin de Worde, (who, as well as Richard Pynson, was ser∣vant to William Caxton) by which it will be perceived, how much the same Carol is altered, as it is sung in some places even now, from what it was at first. It is the last thing, it seems, of the book, which I never yet saw entire; and at the same time I think it proper also to add the Printer's Conclusion, for this Reason at least, that such as write about our
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
first Printers, may have some Notice of the Date of this Book, and the exact place where printed, provided they cannot be able to meet with it, as I believe they will find it pretty difficult to do, it being much laid aside about the time, that some of David's Psalms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Certaine of Davids Psalmes intended for Christmass Carolls fitted to the most common but solemne tunes, ”every where familiarly used: By William Slayter, &amp;c. 1630.</Q></NOTE> ”came to be used in it's stead.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“Thus endeth the Christmas Carolles newly em∣printed at London in the Flete Strete at the Syne of the Sonne by Wynkyn de Worde. The yere ”of our Lorde M.D.xxi.</Q></P>
<P>To this choice Carol the same Remark may be literally applied which Mr. <HI>Hearn</HI> has given us concerning an old Almanack, printed in the Year 1520, and preserved in <HI>Jesus College</HI> Library. "It is rude, and very little is to be gathered from it: YET 'TIS A CURIOSITY".<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hearn. Ibid. pag. 750.</NOTE></P>
<P>Whilst we are so near the Parish Church of <HI>St. Peter</HI> in the East, which is allowed to be the most ancient Ecclesiastical Structure in Eng∣land, we cannot help complimenting the saga∣cious Compiler of the <HI>Pocket Companion</HI>, for a genuine Discovery relating to this Parish, omit∣ted by all other Writers:— <Q>“This Parish, says he, has more to boast of than any one in Europe besides; for it contains, — two Peals of ten Bells, and one of Six; and three
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
Organs: Two of which belong to Chapels, where Cathedral Service is performed twice ”a Day, and the other to the Mother Church.</Q> — It has been insinuated, to the Prejudice of this Writer, that the circumstance of the Bells was inserted by desire of that industrious Anti∣quarian, the late <HI>Browne Willis</HI>, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who it is well known had a <HI>Passion</HI> for Bells, and had accordingly collected complete Catalogues of all the Peals throughout the Kingdom: But I have the Authority of this ingenious Writer, to assure the Public, that Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> never made any such Application, and that this curious Hint was entirely the Result of his own Discernment and Observation.</P>
<P>The same delightful <HI>Companion of the Pocket</HI> for <HI>Oxford</HI>, in his Description of the <HI>Magdalen Hieroglyphics</HI>, has omitted many curious pieces of Hieroglyphical Imagery which adorn the <HI>Outside</HI> of the College, towards the Physic-Garden. <Q>Whether these Sculptures, like those within, comprehend “an exact System of ”Mo∣rals, has not yet been determined by the <HI>Oedipus Magdalenensis</HI>.</Q> The most valuable of them seems to be a Figure near the Tower, which I take to be a <HI>Caricature</HI> of the Laughing Philosopher <HI>Democritus</HI>. Laughter is visibly and
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
strongly expressed by the Mouth, and as Milton speaks, <HI>he is holding both his Sides</HI>. It must be confessed, that the Spout between the Legs is somewhat fantastically placed; and, indeed, there are some other grotesque Circumstances, which, I suppose were introduced to conceal the Character, and give the Figure a mysterious Air, but which may yet imply some latent meaning, not obvious to the common Observer. This Representation of a <HI>laughing Philosopher</HI> seems to be properly and significantly situated at the Entrance into the Town, to admonish Strangers, and particularly the Young Student, that Science is not inconsistent with Good-Humour, and that Scholars are a <HI>merrier</HI> Sett of People than the World is apt to imagine. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a Work which professes to supply the Defects of pre∣ceding Writers, it may justly seem matter of surprise, that I should have neglected to describe and explain at large, the nu∣merous Hieroglyphics, which ornament not only this, but the rest of our most antient and considerable Colleges. It is, indeed, not less surprising, that such a Disquisition should so long have remained a <HI>Desideratum</HI> in Antiquarian Literature; and that <HI>Anthony a Wood</HI> himself, with all his Industry and Curiosity, should have said nothing more on this very material article, than, that <Q>“<HI>One</HI> Oedipus is not sufficient for the Magdalen Hierogly∣phics ”<HI>alone.</HI></Q> [Hist. &amp; Antiq. Univ. Oxon. L. ii. p. 211.] I hope the candid Reader will excuse the Omission in this place, as I am preparing for the Press a Work, entitled, OEDIPUS OXONIENSIS, or a Complete System of <HI>Oxford Hieroglyphics:</HI> by which it will be demonstrated, that our Spouts, Battlements, Parapets, Buttresses, Arches, Window-Frames, &amp;c. are preg∣nant with enigmatical Knowledge, and that the Stone Walls of <HI>Oxford</HI> afford a comprehensive <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Science</HI>.—The <HI>distorted</HI> Features, <HI>extravagant</HI> Combinations, and <HI>human</HI> Mon∣sters, which at present only serve to perplex or amuse the gazing Stranger, will, when thus severally divested of their typical Obscurity, appear to be the Work of ancient Genius and Wisdom, and be <HI>resolved</HI> into most <HI>agreeable</HI> Lessons of <HI>rational</HI> Instruction.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="32"/>I cannot take leave of the abovementioned Author's Account of our Colleges, without lamenting a very important Omission which he has injudiciously made, in a late Edition of his excellent Performance. <Q>It is in his Description of one of our largest Colleges; where he for∣merly took notice of a certain spacious Struc∣ture, which, to use his own Phraseology, “is <HI>large</HI> enough to <HI>accommodate</HI> the <HI>whole</HI> Society ”at an <HI>instant.</HI></Q> A singular and very strinking image is here conveyed to the Imagination; of which, however, we hope, Mr. <HI>Hogarth</HI> will not be so disingenuous, as to take advantage.</P>
<P>When I first planned this Work, nothing more was intended than a <HI>Supplementary</HI> Detail of those Particulars which had been
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
omitted, or misrepresented by other Writers who have professed to describe <HI>Oxford</HI>. But as it is become customary to subjoin a Descrip∣tion of the Neighbouring Seats, I find it neces∣sary to comply with the Fashion, and also to correct the Mistakes, and supply the Deficiencies of Others, in this Particular.</P>
<P>About a mile north-west of this City, stands the Seat of Mr. <HI>Potter</HI>, called MEDLEY-HOUSE, delightfully situated on the Banks of the <HI>Isis</HI>. It is elegantly built of hewn stone, having two beautiful Wings, with commodious Offices. The Front, besides the River, and a Walk shaded with Horse-Chesnuts, commands an <HI>extensive</HI> Prospect over <HI>Port-Meadow</HI>. On the North is a delightful Grove.—Mr. <HI>Potter</HI>, who, in consideration of his distinguished Eminence in that Profession, was the first <HI>Tooth-Drawer</HI> that ever <HI>retired</HI> from Business, keeps an hospi∣table House, and is always glad to wait upon his Friends.</P>
<P>Although the present Edifice be modern, yet the Antiquities of this Place are more remark∣able than is generally supposed; as will appear from the following <HI>learned</HI> and <HI>entertaining</HI> ac∣count, delivered by Mr. <HI>Hearn</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="34"/><Q>“One of the places where the Nuns [of Godstowe] used to <HI>recreate</HI> themselves was <HI>Midley</HI>, or <HI>Medley</HI>, a large House between <HI>Godstowe</HI> and <HI>Oxford</HI>. Being in the <HI>midway</HI>, it thence received the Name. In some wri∣tings, I have seen it called the <HI>Townlet</HI>, or <HI>Township</HI> of <HI>Midley</HI>: whence I gather, that there were formerly <HI>more houses</HI> than <HI>one</HI>. It belonged to Godstowe, being given to the Nunnery in King Henry the Second's Time, by <HI>Robert de Witham</HI>, who had three Daugh∣ters that were Nuns at <HI>Godstowe</HI>. This Do∣nation was afterwards confirmed by <HI>Vincent de Witham</HI>, Son to the said <HI>Robert. Vincent</HI> likewise gave lands, situated in another place, to the Nunnery; and this he did, not only upon his Father's, but upon his own account, he having two Daughters that were Nuns there. The <HI>Withams</HI> were persons of great Note and Distinction. <HI>Rosamond</HI> was well acquainted in the family, and received signal favours from it. She became acquainted there by her interest with the Nuns of <HI>Godstowe</HI>. The same acquaintance made the Family respected by King Henry the Second. It was customary for <HI>Rosamond</HI> to come to <HI>Medley</HI> with the Nuns, and <HI>much mirth</HI> passed on <HI>such occasions</HI>, the place being very <HI>pleasantly situated</HI> just
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
by the River, and care being taken that no disturbances should be given to them, when∣ever they had a mind, which in summer time was frequent, to <HI>solace</HI> themselves here. There was the more need for preventing such disturbances, because of the great Concourse of Persons that came from <HI>Oxford</HI>, and other places, to <HI>divert</HI> themselves here, it being celebrated for it <HI>pleasantness:</HI> as it has been since also a famous place for <HI>recreation</HI> in summer time: whence it is, that <HI>George Wi∣thers</HI> writes thus, in a Love-Sonnet, printed ”in the Year 1620.</Q></P>

<L>"Falero, lero, loo."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hearn, Not. &amp; Spicileg. ut supr. pag. 755, 756,</NOTE></L></Q>
<P>Whether this Place, at present be frequented by vestal Virgins, as formerly, I shall not un∣dertake to determine: However it still retains
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
its original Character, by affording the purposes of <HI>much Mirth, Recreation</HI>, and <HI>Solace</HI>.</P>
<P>We wonder Mr. <HI>Hearn</HI>, a few pages after∣wards, should affirm, that we meet with no re∣markable Monuments in the neighbouring Church Yard of <HI>Binsey</HI>, or <HI>Busney</HI>, except that of Mr. <HI>Thomas Crutch</HI>, who lately lived at <HI>Med∣ley</HI>, bore a good character, and is always spoken of by the Inhabitants of <HI>Binsey</HI> with particular respect. [Ut supr. pag. 767.]—However he has endeavoured to supply this palpable Defect, by giving some Epitaphs from the Church-yard at <HI>Headington</HI>; after which he adds,
<Q><L>"Robert Burton of Highfield lies under this Stone,</L>
<L>"Who lived at Highfield one hundred years and one.</L></Q></P>
<P><Q>“Though I have thought this Epitaph worth noting, yet it is nothing near so remarkable as that to old <HI>Daniel Jones</HI>, Clerk of <HI>Rixam</HI>, who, as he wore a very long Beard (yet no∣thing near so long as that wore by the famous Painter, <HI>John Vermeyen</HI>, born at <HI>Beverwych</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI>, in the year 1500, who was com∣monly called <HI>John with the great Beard</HI>, which he took great Pride to nourish, it being so long, that though he was tall himself, yet he could stand upright when it touched the ground; I say as old <HI>Daniel Jones</HI> had a very long Beard) so he orderded particular care to
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
be taken of it after his death, so as to be bu∣ried ”with him.</Q> Thus the Epitaph.</P>
<Q><L>"Here under lyeth among these Stones,</L>
<L>"The Beard the Flesh and eke the Bones,</L>
<L>"Of Rixam Clerk, old Daniel Jones."</L>
<BIBL>Ibid. pag. 763.</BIBL></Q>
<P><HI>Daniel Jones</HI>, as he must have derived a vene∣rable Aspect, from this comely length of Beard, so I presume there was a Gravity in his Carriage, and Solemnity in his Character, suitable to his Calling: Qualities well worthy the Imitation of our <HI>modern</HI> Parish Clerks! —But I beg pardon for this short Digression, and return to the Subject.</P>
<P>In pursuing the Course of so delightful a River, one might reasonably have expected to find many other agreeable SEATS; but being unluckily disappointed, we must conduct the Traveller, in his Way to <HI>Blenheim</HI>, to the pleasant <HI>Villa</HI> of WILLIAM IVES, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> at BEGBROOK. The House is small, but snug and commodious. The Garden, and it's Environs, are adorned with Statues; the most striking of which, is <HI>Aeneas</HI> supporting his Fa∣ther <HI>Anchises</HI>. The Prospect is terminated by <HI>Kidlington</HI> Spire.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pocket Companion</HI>, in describing the Gar∣den at <HI>Elsfield</HI>, affirms with great confidence,
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
that most of the <HI>Seats</HI> in Oxfordshire may be seen from this delightful Spot. The Prospect, I con∣fess, is extensive, various, and beautiful: But I am apt to suspect that <HI>Cumner-Hurst</HI>, and other Eminencies which bend northward, and are very opake bodies, must intercept Mr. <HI>Lenthall</HI>'s at <HI>Burford, Blandford Lodge</HI>, Lady <HI>Wheat</HI>'s at <HI>Glympton</HI>, Lord <HI>Guildford</HI>'s at <HI>Wroxton</HI>, Mr. <HI>Keck</HI>'s at <HI>Great-Tew</HI>, Mr. <HI>Page</HI>'s at <HI>North-Aston</HI>, &amp;c. — I cannot apprehend that <HI>Sherborne-Castle</HI>, the Seat of Lord <HI>Macclesfield</HI>, or Lord <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s at <HI>Newnham</HI>, are visible in the clearest Day. Nor is it agreed on all hands that Mr. <HI>Whorwood's</HI> at <HI>Holton</HI>, and Mr. <HI>Schutz</HI>'s at <HI>Shotover</HI>, are discern∣ible, even with the help of a Telescope.</P>
<P><Q>The same writer indeed, very justly remarks, that this Garden “has several Canals, and <HI>Fish∣ponds</HI>, and that it is adorned by it's learned Owner with many <HI>modern antiquities</HI> of various ”Kinds and Countries.</Q>— But as the reader cannot collect any clear or distinct Information from so general a Detail, I shall add, that one of the <HI>modern antiquities</HI> here hinted at, is a <HI>Druidical</HI> Temple, lately erected upon the plan of Dr. <HI>Stukely</HI>. This Temple may be properly stiled a <HI>modern</HI> Antiquity, on more accounts than one: it is undoubtedly a true Specimen of <HI>Druidical</HI> Architecture, but it is most unluckily
<PB N="40" REF="39" MS="y"/>
shaded by a <HI>Walnut-tree</HI> instead of an <HI>Oak</HI>. I cannot help mentioning with some concern, that such an <HI>Innovation</HI> in the Garden of a <HI>real</HI> Anti∣quarian is a <HI>bad</HI> precedent, and may be attended with pernicious Consequences: although I have been informed, that, to palliate the matter, the <HI>learned Owner</HI> has more than once inoculated this Walnut Tree with a slip of genuine <HI>Welch Mislletoe</HI>, but without Effect. — As then they are incompatible <HI>together</HI>, I would advise him either to destroy the Temple or the Tree: and by this means, in vindication of his character, the real truth would appear to the world, whe∣ther he loves <HI>Wallnuts</HI> or <HI>Antiquity</HI> best. — In a word, was any other <HI>modern</HI> Antiquarian to place a circular Series of Stones, under <HI>Jo. Pullen</HI>'s <HI>Tree</HI>, on <HI>Heddington-Hill</HI>, the inconsist∣ency would be obvious to all our <HI>young Antiqua∣rians</HI>, who constantly visit it Morning and Af∣ternoon: notwithstanding that venerable Elm, in consideration of its learned <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>anter, its Beauty, its eminent Situation, academical Connections, and other respectable Circumstances, has a fairer claim than most Trees, to be dignified with <HI>Druidical</HI> Honours, and be made the <HI>Representative</HI> of an <HI>Oak</HI>.</P>
