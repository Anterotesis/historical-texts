<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
OF
Peregrine Pickle.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He embarks for France; is overtaken by a storm;
is surprised with the appearance of Pipes; lands
at Calais, and has an affair with the officers of
the custom-house.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE had the vessel proceeded two
leagues on the passage, when the wind
shifting, blew directly in their teeth; so
that they were obliged to haul upon a wind, and
alter their course; and the sea running pretty
high at the same time, our hero, who was below
in his cabbin, began to be squeamish, and in con∣sequence
of the skipper's advice, went upon deck
for the comfort of his stomach; while the go∣vernor,
experienced in these disasters, slipt into
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
bed, where he lay at his ease, amusing himself
with a treatise on the Cycloid, with algebraical
demonstrations, which never failed to engage
his imagination in the most agreeable manner.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the wind increased to a very
hard gale, the vessel pitched with great violence,
the sea washed over the decks, the master was
alarmed, the crew were confounded, the passen∣gers
were overwhelmed with sickness and fear,
and universal distraction ensued. In the midst of
this uproar, Peregrine holding fast by the taffril,
and looking ruefully ahead, the countenance of
Pipes presented itself to his astonished view, rising
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it were from the hold of the ship. At first he
imagined it was a fear-formed shadow of his own
brain; though he did not long remain in this er∣ror,
but plainly perceived that it was no other
than the real person of Thomas, who jumping
on the quarter-deck, took charge of the helm,
and dictated to the sailors with as much autho∣rity
is if he had been commander of the ship.
The skipper looked upon him as an angel sent to
his assistance, and the crew soon discovering him
to be a thorough-bred seaman, notwithstanding
his livery-frock, obeyed his orders with such ala∣crity
that in a little time the confusion vanished,
and every necessary step taken to weather the
gale.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman immediately conceived
the meaning of Tom's appearance on board, and
when the tumult was a little subsided, went up
and encouraged him to ext himself for the pre∣servation
of the ship, promising to take him again
into his service, from which he should never be
dismissed, except by his own desire. This as∣surance
had a surprising effect upon Pipes, who,
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
though he made no manner of reply, thrust the
helm into the master's hand, saying, “Here,
you old bum-boat woman, take hold of the til∣ler,
and keep her thus, boy, thus;” and skipped
about the vessel, trimming the sails, and ma∣naging
the ropes with such agility and skill, that
every body on deck stood amazed at his dex∣terity.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter was far from being unconcerned at
the uncommon motion of the vessel, the singing
of the wind, and the uproar which he heard
above him; he looked towards the cabbin-door
with the most wishful expectation, in hope of
seeing some person who could give some account
of the weather, and what was doing upon deck;
but not a soul appeared, and he was too well ac∣quainted
with the disposition of his own bowels
to alter his own attitude in the least. When he
had lain a good while in all the agony of sus∣pence,
the boy tumbled headlong into his apart∣ment
with such noisy ruin, that he believed the
mast had gone by the board, and starting upright
in his bed, asked with all the symptoms of hor∣ror,
what was the cause of that disturbance?
The boy, half stunned by his fall, answered in a
dolorous tone, “I'm come to put up the dead-lights.”
At the mention of dead-lights, the
meaning of which he did not understand, the
poor governor's heart died within him; he shi∣vered
with despair, and his recollection forsaking
him, he fell upon his knees in the bed, and fixing
his eyes upon the book which was in his hand, be∣gan
to pronounce aloud, with great fervor,
“The time of a compleat oscillation in the cy∣cloid,
is to the time in which a body would fail
through the axis of the cycloid DV, as the cir∣cumference
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
of a circle to its diameter—” He
would in all likelihood have proceeded with the
demonstration of this proposition, had he not
been seized with such a qualm as compelled him
to drop the book, and accommodate himself to
the emergency of his distemper; he therefore
stretched himself at full length, and putting up
ejaculations to heaven, began to prepare himself
for his latter end, when all of a sudden the noise
above was intermitted; and as he could not con∣ceive
the cause of this tremendous silence, he
imagined that either the men were washed over∣board,
or that despairing of safety, they had
ceased to oppose the tempest. While he was
harrowed by this miserable incertainty, which,
however, was not altogether unenlightened by
some scattered rays of hope, the master entered
the cabbin, and he asked with a voice half extin∣guished
by fear, how matters went upon deck?
The skipper, with a large bottle of brandy ap∣plied
to his mouth, answered in a hollow tone,
“All's over now, master.” Upon which Mr.
Jolter, giving himself over for lost, exclaimed
with the utmost horror, “Lord have mercy up∣on
us! Christ have mercy upon us!” and re∣peated
this supplication as it were mechanically,
until the master undeceived him, by explaining the
meaning of what he had said, and assuring him
that the squall was over.</P>
<P>Such a sudden transition from fear to joy, oc∣casioned
a violent agitation both in his mind and
body; and it was a full quarter of an hour before
he recovered the right use of his organs. By
this time the weather cleared up, the wind be∣gan
to blow again from the right corner, and the
spires of Calais appeared at the distance of five
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
leagues; so that the countenances of all on board
were lighted up with joyous expectation; and
Peregrine venturing to go down into the cabbin,
comforted his governor with an account of the
happy turn of their affairs.</P>
<P>Jolter, transported with the thought of a speedy
landing, began to launch out in praise of that
country for which they were bound. He ob∣served,
that France was the land of politeness
and hospitality, which were conspicuous in the
behaviour of all ranks and degrees, from the peer
to the peasant; that a gentleman and a foreigner,
far from being ins<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted and imposed upon by the
lower class of people, as in England, was treated
with the utmost reverence, candour and respect;
that their fields were fertile, their climate pure
and healthy, their farmers rich and industrious,
and the subjects in general the happiest of men.
He wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld have prosecuted this favourite theme
still farther, had not his pupil been obliged to run
upon deck, in consequence of certain warnings
he received from his stomach.</P>
<P>The skipper seeing his condition, very honestly
reminded him of the cold ham and fowls, with a
basket of wine, which he had ordered to be sent
on board, and asked if he would have the cloth
laid below. He could not have chosen a more
seasonable opportunity of manifesting his own dis∣interestedness.
Peregrine made wry faces at the
mention of food, bidding him, for Christ's sake,
talk no more on that subject. He then descended
into the cabbin, and put the same question to
Mr. Jolter, who, he knew, entertained the same
abhorrence for his proposal; and meeting with
the like reception from him, went between decks,
and repeated his courteous proffer to the valet de
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
chambre and lacquev, who lay sprawling in all
the pangs of a double evacuation, and rejected
his civility with the most horrible loathing. Thus
baffled in all his kind endeavours, he ordered his
boy to secure the provision in one of his own
lockers, according to the custom of the ship;
and he would have enjoyed a pretty comfortable
booty, had not Pipes interposed, and divided the
store among the sailors, who, he thought, were
most deserving of such indulgence; so that the
skipper had the mertification of seeing his plan
miseary by his own precipitate conduct; for,
had he held his tongue, no body would have
dreamt of asking for the provision, and he would
have possessed his prize in peace.</P>
<P>It being low water when they arrived on the
French coast, the vessel could not enter the har∣bour,
and they were obliged to bring to, and
wait for a boat, which in less than half an hour
came along-side from the shore. Mr Jolter
now came upon deck, and snuffing up the French
air with symptoms of infinite satisfaction, asked
of the boatmen, with the friendly appellation of
<HI>Mes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> what they must have for transporting
them and their baggage to the pier. But how
was he disconcerted, when those polite, candid,
reasonable watermen, demanded a Louis d'or for
that service! Peregrine, with a sarcastic sneer,
observed, that he already began to perceive the
justice of his encomiums on the French; and the
disappointed governor could say nothing in his
own vindication, but that they were debauched
by their intercourse with the inhabitants of Dover.
His pupil, however, was so much offended at
their extortion, that he absolutely refused to em∣ploy
them, even when they abated one half in
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
their demand, and swore he would stay on board
till the packet should be able to enter the har∣bour,
rather than encourage such imposition.</P>
<P>The master, who in all probability had some
sort of fellow-feeling with the boatmen, in vain
represented, that he could not with safety lie to,
or anchor upon a lee-shore; our hero having con∣sulted
Pipes, answered, that he had hired his ves∣sel
to transport him to Calais, and that he would
oblige him to perform what he had undertaken.</P>
<P>The skipper, very much mortified at this pe∣remptory
reply, which was not over and above
agreeable to Mr. Jolter, dismissed the boat, not∣withstanding
the sollicitations and condescension
of the watermen, who promised to submit to the
generosity of their employer; and running a little
farther in-shore, came to an anchor, and waited
till there was water enough to float them over
the bar. Then they stood in to the harbour, and
our gentleman, with his attendants and baggage,
were landed on the pier by the sailors, whom he
liberally rewarded for their trouble.</P>
<P>He was immediately plied by a great number
of porters, who, like so many hungry wolves,
had hold on his luggage, and began to carry it
off p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ece-meal, without his order or direction.
Incensed at this officious insolence, he commanded
them to desist, with many oaths and opprobrious
terms that his anger suggested; and perceiving
that one of them did not seem to pay any regard
to what he said, but marched off with his bur∣then,
he snatched a cudgel out of his lacquey's
hand, and overtaking the fellow in a twinkling,
brought him to the ground with one blow. He
was instantly surrounded by the whole congre∣gration
of this <HI>canaille,</HI> who resented the injury
<PB N="8" REF="17"/>
which their brother had sustained, and would
have taken immediate satisfaction of the aggressor,
had not Pipes, seeing his master involved, brought
the whole crew to his assistance, and exerted
himself so manfully, that the enemy were obliged
to retreat with many marks of defeat, and me∣naces
of interesting the commandant in their quar∣rel.
Jolter, who knew and dreaded the power
of the French governor, began to shake with ap∣prehension,
when he heard their repeated threats;
but they durst not apply to this magistrate, who,
upon a fair representation of the case, would
have punished them severely for their rapacious
and insolent behaviour; and Peregrine, without
farther molestation, availed himself of his own
attendants, who shouldered his baggage, and fol∣lowed
him to the gate, where they were stopt by
the centinels, until their names should be re∣gistered.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, who had undergone this examina∣tion
before, resolved to profit by his experience,
and cunningly represented his pupil as a young
English lord. This intimation, supported by the
appearance of his equipage, was no sooner com∣municated
to the officer, than he turned out the
guard, and ordered his soldiers to rest upon their
arms, while his lordship passed in great state to
the <HI>Lion d'Argent,</HI> where he took up his lodging
for the night, resolving to set out for Paris next
morning in a post-chaise.</P>
<P>The governor triumphed greatly in this piece
of complaisance and respect with which they had
been honoured, and resumed his beloved topic
of discourse, in applauding the method and sub∣ordination
of the French government, which
was better calculated for maintaining order, and
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
protecting the people, than any constitution up∣on
earth; and of their courteous attention to
strangers, there needed no other proof than the
compliment which had been paid to them, toge∣ther
with the governor's connivance at Pere∣grine's
employing his own servants in carrying the
baggage to the inn, contrary to the privilege of
the inhabitants.</P>
<P>While he expatiated with a remarkable degree
of self-indulgence on this subject, the valet de
chambre coming into the room, interrupted his
harangue, by telling his master, that their trunks
and portmanteaus must be carried to the custom-house,
in order to be searched, and sealed with
lead, which must remain untouched until their
arrival at Paris.</P>
<P>Peregrine made no objection to this practice,
which was in itself reasonable enough; but when
he understood that the gate was besieged by an∣other
multitude of porters, who insisted upon
their right of carrying the goods, and also of
fixing their own price, he absolutely refused to
comply with their demand; and chastising some
of the most clamorous among them with his foot,
told them, that if their custom-house officers had
a mind to examine his baggage, they might come
to the inn for that purpose. The valet de cham∣bre
was abashed at this boldness of his master's
behaviour, which the lacquey, shrugging up his
shoulders, observed was <HI>bien a l' Angloise;</HI> while
the governor represented it as an indignity to
the whole nation, and endeavoured to persuade
his pupil to comply with the custom of the place.
But Peregrine's natural haughtiness of disposition
hindered him from giving ear to Jolter's whole∣some
advice; and in less than half an hour they
<PB N="10" REF="19"/>
perceived a file of musqueteers marching up to
the gate. At sight of this detachment the tutor
trembled, the valet grew pale, and the lacquey
crossed himself; but our hero, without exhibiting
any other symptoms than those of indignation,
met them on the threshold, and with a ferocious
air demanded their business. The corporal who
commanded the file answered with great delibe∣ration,
that he had orders to convey his baggage
to the custom-house; and seeing the trunks
standing in the entry, placed his men between
them and the owner, while the porters that fol∣lowed,
took them up, and proceeded to the
Douane without opposition.</P>
<P>Pickle was not mad enough to dispute the
authority of this message; but, in order to gall,
and specify his contempt for those who brought
it, he called aloud to his valet, desiring him, in
French, to accompany his things, and see that
none of his linen and effects should be stolen by
the searchers. The corporal, mortified at this
satirical insinuation, darted a look of resentment
at the author, as if he had been interested for
the glory of his nation; and told him, that
he could perceive he was a stranger in France,
or else he would have saved himself the trouble
of such a needless precaution. Indeed this ex∣pression
had no sooner escaped our young gentle∣man,
than he was ashamed of his own petu∣lance;
for nothing was farther from his prin∣ciples
than the least encouragement of ungene∣rous
suspicion.</P>

<P>HAVING thus yielded to the hand of power,
he inquired if there was any other English
company in the house; and understanding that a
gentleman and lady lodged in the next apart∣ment,
and had bespoke a post-chaise for Paris,
he ordered Pipes to ingratiate himself with their
footman, and, if possible, learn their names and
condition, while he and Mr. Jolter, attended by
the lacquey, took a turn round the ramparts, and
viewed the particulars of the fortification.</P>
<P>Tom was so very successful in his inquiry, that
when his master returned, he was able to give
him a very satisfactory account of his fellow-lodgers,
in consequence of having treated his
brother with a bottle of wine. The people in
question were a gentleman and his lady, lately
arrived from England, in their way to Paris.
The husband was a man of good fortune, who
had been a libertine in his youth, and a professed
declaimer against matrimony. He neither wanted
sense nor experience, and piqued himself in par∣ticular
upon his art in avoiding the snares of the
female sex, in which he pretended to be deeply
versed. But, notwithstanding a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l his caution and
skill, he had lately fallen a sacrifice to the attrac∣tions
of an oyster-wench, who had found means
to decoy him into the bands of wedlock; and,
in order to evade the compliments and congra∣tulations
of his friends and acquaintance, he had
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
come so far on a tour to Paris, where he intended
to initiate his spouse in the beau-monde; though
in the mean time he chose to live upon the re∣serve,
because her natural talents had as yet re∣ceived
but little cultivation; and he had not the
most implicit confidence in her virtue and discre∣tion,
which, it seems, had like to have yielded
to the addresses of an officer at Canterbury, who
had made shift to insinuate himself into her ac∣quaintance
and favour.</P>
<P>Peregrine's curiosity being inflamed by this
information, he lounged about the yard, in hopes
of seeing the Dulcinea who had captivated the
old batchelor, and at length observing her at a
window, took the liberty of bowing to her with
great respect. She returned the compliment with
a curt'sie, and appeared so decent in her dress and
manner, that unless he had been previously in∣formed
of her former life and conversation, he
never would have dreamt that her education was
different from that of other ladies of fashion; so
easy it is to acquire that external deportment on
which people of condition value themselves so
much. Not but that Mr. Pickle pretended to
distinguish a certain vulgar audacity in her coun∣tenance,
which in a lady of birth and fortune
would have passed for an agreeable vivacity that
enlivens the aspect, and gives a poignancy to
every feature: but, as she possessed a pair of fine
eyes and a clear complexion, overspread with the
glow of health, which never fails of recom∣mending
the owner, he could not help gazing at
her with desire, and forming the design of making
a conquest of her heart. With this view, he
sent his compliments to her husband, whose
name was Hornbeck, with an intimation, that
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
he proposed to set out next day for Paris, and as
he understood that he was resolved upon the same
journey, he should be extremely glad of his com∣pany
on the road, if he was not better engaged.
Hornbeck, who in all probability did not chuse
to accommodate his wife with a squire of our he∣ro's
appearance, sent a civil answer to his message,
professing infinite mortification at his being unable
to embrace the favour of his kind offer, by reason
of the indisposition of his wife, who, he was
afraid, would not be in a condition for some days
to bear the fatigue of travelling. This rebuff,
which Peregrine ascribed to the husband's jea∣lousy,
stifled his project in embrio; he ordered
his French servant to take a place for himself in
the Diligence, where all his luggage was stowed,
except a small trunk with some linen and other
necessaries that was fixed upon the post-chaise
which they hired of the landlord; and early next
morning he and Mr. Jolter departed from Ca∣lais,
attended by his valet de chambre and Pipes
on horseback. They proceeded without any ac∣cident
as far as Boulogne, where they breakfasted
and visited old father Graham, a Scottish gentle∣man
of the governor's acquaintance, who had
lived as a capuchin in that place for the space of
threescore years, and during that period conformed
to all the austerities of the order, with the most
rigorous exactness; being equally remarkable for
the frankness of his conversation, the humanity
of his disposition, and the simplicity of his manners.
From Boulogne they took their departure about
noon, and as they proposed to sleep that night
at Abbe Ville, commanded the postilion to drive
with extraordinary speed; and perhaps it was well
for his cattle that the axle-tree gave way, and the
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
chaise of course overturned before they had tra∣velled
one third part of the stage.</P>
<P>This accident compelled them to return to the
place from whence they had set out, and as they
could not procure another convenience, they found
themselves under the necessity of staying till their
chaise could be refitted. Understanding that this
operation would detain them a whole day, our
young gentleman had recourse to his patience,
and demanded to know what they could have for
dinner; the garçon, or waiter thus questioned,
vanished in a moment, and immediately they
were surprized with the appearance of a strange
figure, which from the extravagance of its dress
and gesticulation, Peregrine mistook for a mad∣man
of the growth of France. This phantome
(which by the bye, happened to be no other than
the cook) was a tall, long-legged, meagre, swar∣thy
fellow, that stopped very much; his cheek-bones
were remarkably raised, his nose bent into
the shape and size of a powder-horn, and the
sockets of his eyes as raw round the edges, as if
the skin had been pared off; on his head he wore
an handkerchief which had once been white, and
now served to cover the upper part of a black
periwig, to which was attached a bag, at least a
foot square, with a solitaire and rose that stuck
up on each side to his ear; so that he looked like a
criminal in the pillory; his back was accommo∣dated
with a linnen waistcoat, his hands adorned
with long ruffies of the same piece, his middle
was girded by an apron tucked up, that it might
not conceal his white silk stockings rolled; and at
his entrance he brandished a bloody weapon full
three feet in length. Peregrine, when he first saw
him approach in this menacing attitude, put himself
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
upon his guard, but being informed of his qua∣lity,
perused his list, and having bespoke three or
four things for dinner, walked out with Mr. Jol∣ter
to view both towns, which they had not lei∣sure
to consider minutely before. In their return
from the harbour they met with four or five gen∣tlemen,
all of whom seemed to look with an air
of dejection, and perceiving our hero and his go∣vernor
to be English by their dress, bowed with
great respect as they passed. Pickle, who was
naturally compassionate, felt an emotion of sym∣pathy;
and seeing a person, who by his habit he
judged to be one of their servants, accosted him
in English, and asked who the gentlemen were.
The lacquey gave him to understand that they were
his own countrymen, exiled from their native
homes, in consequence of their adherence to an
unfortunate and ruined cause; and that they were
gone to the sea-side, according to their daily
practice, in order to indulge their longing eyes,
with a prospect of the white cliffs of Albion, which
they must never more approach.</P>
<P>Though our young gentleman differed widely
from them in point of political principles, he was
not one of those enthusiasts who look upon every
schism from the established articles of faith, as
damnable, and exclude the sceptick from every
benefit of humanity and christian forgiveness: he
could easily comprehend how a man of the most
unblemished morals might, by the prejudice of
education, or indispensible attachments, be ingaged
in such a blame worthy and pernicious undertak∣ing;
and thought that they had already suffered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for their imprudence. He was affected
with the account of their diurnal pilgrimage to
the sea-side, which he considered as a pathetic
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
proof of their affliction, and invested Mr. Jolter
with the agreeable office of going to them with a
compliment in his name, and begging the honour
of drinking a glass with them in the evening.
They accepted the proposal with great satisfaction
and respectful acknowledgement, and in the after∣noon
waited upon the kind inviter, who treated
them with coffee, and would have detained them
to supper; but they intreated the favour of his
company at the house which they frequented, so
earnestly, that he yielded to their solicitations,
and with his governor was conducted by them to
the place, where they had provided an elegant re∣past,
and regaled them with some of the best cla∣ret
in France.</P>
<P>It was easy for them to perceive that their
principal guest was no favourer of their state
maxims, and therefore they industriously avoided
every subject of conversation which could give
the least offence; not but that they lamented
their own situation, which cut them off from all
their dearest connexions, and doomed them to
perpetual banishment from their families and
friends: but they did not even by the most distant
hint, impeach the justice of that sentence by
which they were condemned; although one
among them, who seemed to be about the age of
thirty, wept bitterly over his misfortune, which
had involved a beloved wise and three children in
misery and distress; and in the impatience of his
grief, cursed his own fate with frantic impreca∣tions.
His companions, with a view of beguiling
his sorrow, and manifesting their own hospitality
at the same time, changed the topic of discourse,
and circulated the bumpers with great assiduity;
so that all their cares were overwhelmed and for∣gotten,
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
several drinking French catches were
sung, and mirth and good fellowship prevailed.</P>
<P>In the midst of this elevation, which commonly
unlocks the most hidden sentiment, and dispels
every consideration of caution and constraint, one
of the entertainers being more intoxicated than
his fellows, proposed a toast, to which Peregrine
with some warmth excepted, as an unmannerly
insult. The other maintained his proposition with
indecent heat, and the dispute beginning to grow
very serious, the company interposed, and gave
judgment against their friend, who was so keenly
reproached and rebuked for his impolite behavi∣our,
by the gentleman whose sensibility hath been
mentioned, that he retired in high dudgeon,
threatening to relinquish their society, and brand∣ing
them with the appellation of apostates from
the common cause. Mortified at the behaviour
of their companion, those that remained were
earnest in their apologies to their guests, whom
they besought to forgive his intemperance; assur∣ing
them with great confidence, that he would
upon the recovery of his reflection, wait upon
them in person, and ask pardon for the umbrage
he had given. Pickle was satisfied with their re∣monstrances,
resumed his good humour, and the
night being pretty far advanced, resisted all their
importunities with which he was intreated to see
another bottle go round, and was escorted to his
own lodgings, more than half seas over. Next
morning about eight o'clock, he was waked by
his valet de chambre, who told him that two of
the gentlemen with whom he had spent the even∣ing
were in the house, and desired the favour of
being admitted into his chamber. He could not
conceive the meaning of this extraordinary visit,
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
and ordering his man to shew them into his apart∣ment,
beheld the person who had affronted him
enter with the gentleman who had reprehended
his rudeness.</P>
<P>He who had given the offence, after having
made an apology for disturbing Mr. Pickle, told
him that his friend there present had been with
him early that morning, and proposed the alter∣native
of either fighting with him immediately,
or coming to beg pardon for his unmannerly de∣portment
over night; that though he had courage
enough to face any man in the field in a righteous
cause, he was not so brutal as to disobey the dic∣tates
of his own duty and reflection, in conse∣quence
of which, and not out of any regard to
the other's menaces, which he despised, he had
now taken the liberty of interrupting his repose,
that he might as soon us possible, atone for the
injury he had done him, which he protested was
the effect of intoxication alone, and begged his
forgiveness accordingly. Our hero accepted of
this acknowledgment very graciously, thanked
the other gentleman for the gallant part he had
acted in his behalf; and perceiving that his com∣panion
was a little irritated at his officious inter∣position,
effected a reconciliation, by convincing
him that what he had done was for the honour of
the company. He then kept them to breakfast,
expressed a desire of seeing their situation altered
for the better, and the chaise being repaired, took
his leave of his entertainers, who came to wish
him a good journey, and with his attendants left.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Proceeds for the capital. Takes up his lodging at
Bernay, where he is overtaken by Mr. Horn∣beck,
whose head he longs to fortify.</HEAD>
<P>DURING this day's expedition, Mr. Jol∣ter
took an opportunity of imparting to his
pupil the remarks he had made upon the industry
of the French, as an undeniable proof of which
he had him cast his eyes around, and observe with
what care every spot of ground was cultivated;
and from the fertility of that province, which is
reckoned the poorest in France, conceive the
wealth and affluence of the nation in general.
Peregrine amazed as well as disgusted at this infa∣tuation,
answered that what he ascribed to industry,
was the effect of meer wretchedness; the
miserable peasants being obliged to plough up
every inch of ground to satisfy their oppressive
landlords, while they themselves and their cattle
looked like so many images of famine; that their
extreme poverty was evident from the face of the
country, on which there was not one inclosure
to be seen, or any other object, except scanty
crops of barley and oats, which could never re∣ward
the toil of the husbandman; that their ha∣bitations
were no better than paultry huts; that
in twenty miles of extent, not one gentleman's
house appeared; that nothing was more abject and
forlorn than the attire of their country people;
and lastly, that the equipage of their travelling
chaises was infinitely inferior to that of a dung∣cart
in England; and that the postilion who then
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
drove their carriage, had neither stockings to his
legs, nor a shirt to his back.</P>
<P>The governor finding his charge so intractable,
resolved to leave him in the mist of his own ig∣norance
and prejudice, and reserve his observa∣tions
for those who would pay more deference
to his opinion; and indeed this resolution he had
often made, and as often broke, in the trans∣ports
of his zeal, that frequently hurried him out
of the plan of conduct which in his cooler mo∣ments
he had laid down. They haited for a re∣freshment
at Montreuil, and about eight in the
evening arrived at a village called Bernay, where
while they waited for fresh horses, they were in∣formed
by the landlord, that the gates of Abbe
Ville were shut every night punctually at nine
o'clock; so that it would be impossible for them
to get admittance; and that there was not ano∣ther
place of entertainment on the road where
they could pass the night; he therefore, as a friend,
advised them to stay at his house, where they
would find the best of accommodation, and pro∣ceed
upon their journey by times in the morning.</P>
<P>Mr. Jolter, though he had travelled on that
road before, could not recollect whether or not
mine host spoke truth; but his remonstrance be∣ing
very plausible, our hero determined to follow
his advice, and being conducted into an apart∣ment,
asked what they could have for supper.
The landlord mentioned every thing that was eat∣able
in the house, and the whole being ingrossed
for the use of him and his attendants, he amused
himself till such time as it could be dressed, in con∣versing
with the daughter, who was a sprightly dam∣sel
about the age of seventeen; and in strolling about
the house, which stands in a very rural situation.
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
While he thus loitered away the time that hung
heavy on his hands, another chaise arrived at the
inn, and upon inquiry he found that the new
comers were Mr. Hornbeck and his lady. The
landlord, conscious of his inability to entertain this
second company, came and begged with great
humiliation that Mr. Pickle would spare them
some part of the victuals he had bespoke; but he
refused to part with so much as the wing of a par∣tridge,
though at the same time he sent his com∣pliments
to the strangers, and giving them to un∣derstand
how ill the house was provided for their
reception, invited them to partake of his supper.
Mr. Hornbeck, who was not deficient in point of
politeness, and extremely well disposed for a re∣lishing
meal, which he had reason to expect from
the savoury steam that issued from the kitchen,
could not resist this second instance of our young
gentleman's civility, which he acknowledged by
a message, importing that he and his wife would
do themselves the pleasure of profiting by his
courteous offer. Peregrine's cheeks glowed when
he found himself on the eve of being acquainted
with Mrs. Hornbeck, of whose heart he had al∣ready
made a conquest in imagination; and he
forthwith set his invention at work, to contrive
some means of defeating her husband's vigilance.</P>
<P>When supper was ready, he in person gave
notice to his guests, and leading the lady into his
apartment, seated her in an elbow chair at the up∣per
end of the table, squeezing her hand and
darting a most insi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> geance at the same time.
This abrupt behaviour he practised on the pre∣sumption,
that a lady of her breeding was not to
be addressed with the tedious forms that must be
observed in one's advances to a person of birth
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
and genteel education; and in all probability his
calculation was just, for Mrs. Hornbeck gave no
signs of discontent at this sort of treatment, but
on the contrary, seemed to consider it as a proof
of the young gentleman's regard; and though she
did not venture to open her mouth three times
during the whole repast, she shewed herself par∣ticularly
well satisfied with her entertainer, by
sundry sly and significant looks, while her hus∣band's
eyes were directed another way, and di∣vers
loud peals of laughter, signi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying her appro∣bation
of the sallies which he uttered in the course
of their conversation. Her spouse began to be
very uneasy at the frank demeanour of his yoke-fellow,
whom he endeavoured to check in her
vivacity, by assuming a severity of aspect; but
whether she obeyed the dictates of her own dis∣position,
which, perhaps, was merry and unre∣served,
or wanted to punish Mr. Hornbeck for
his jealousy of temper; certain it is, her gaiety
increased to such a degree, that her husband was
grievously alarmed and incensed at her conduct,
and resolved to make her sensible of his displea∣sure,
by treading in secret upon her toes. He was,
however, so disconcerted by his indignation, that
he mistook his mark, and applied the sharp heel
of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oe to the side of Mr. Jolter's foot, com∣prehending
his little toe that was studded with an
angry corn, which he invaded with such a sudden
jerk, that the governor, unable to endure the tor∣ture
in silence, started up, and dancing on the floor,
roared hideously with repeated bellowings, to the
unspeakable enjoyment of Peregrine and the lady,
who laughed themselves almost into convulsions
at the joke. Hornbeck, confounded at the mistake
he had committed, begged pardon of the injured
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
tutor with great contrition, protesting that the
blow he had so unfortunately received, was in∣tended
for an ugly cur, which he thought had
posted himself under the table. It was lucky for
him that there was actually a dog in the room, to
justify this excuse, which Jolter admitted with the
tears running over his cheeks, and the oeconomy
of the table was re-composed.</P>
<P>As soon, however, as the strangers could with
decency withdraw, this suspicious husband took
his leave of the youth, on pretence of being fa∣tigued
with his journey, after having, by way of
compliment, proposed that they should travel to∣gether
next day; and Peregrine handed the lady
to her chamber, where he wished her good night
with another warm squeeze, which she returned.
This favourable hint made his heart bound with a
transport of joy; he lay in wait for an opportu∣nity
of declaring himself, and seeing the husband
go down into the yard with a candle, he glided
softly into his apartment, and found her almost
undressed. Impelled by the impetuosity of his
passion, which was still more inflamed by her pre∣sent
luscious appearance, and encouraged by the
approbation she had already expressed, he ran to∣wards
her with eagerness, crying, “Zounds!
madam, your charms are irresistible!” and with∣out
further ceremony would have clasped her in
his arms, had not she begged him for the love of
God to retire, for should Mr. Hornbeck return
and find him there, she would be undone for ever.
He was not so blinded by his passion but that he
saw the reasonableness of her fear, and as he could
not pretend to crown his wishes at that interview,
he avowed himself her lover, assured her that he
would exhaust his whole invention in finding a
<PB N="24" REF="33"/>
proper opportunity for throwing himself at her
feet; and in the mean time he ravished sundry
small favours, which she in the hurry of her fright
could not with-hold from his impudence of ad∣dress.
Having thus happily settled the prelimi∣naries,
he withdrew to his own chamber, and
spent the whole night in contriving stratagems to
elude the jealous caution of his fellow-traveller.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">They set out in company, breakfast at Abbe Ville,

which he had concerted upon Hornbeck.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole company by agreement rose and
departed before day, and breakfasted at Ab∣be
Ville, where they became acquainted with the
finesse of their Bernay landlord, who had imposed
upon them, in affirming that they would not
have been admitted after the gates were shut.
From thence they proceeded to Amiens, where
they dined and were pestered by begging friars;
and the roads being deep, it was eleven o'clock
at night before they reached Chan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy, where
they found supper already dressed, in conse∣quence
of having dispatched the valet de cham∣bre
before them on horseback.</P>
<P>The constitution of Horneck being very much
impaired by a life of irregularity, he found him∣self
so fatigued with this day's journey, which
amounted to upwards of an hundred miles, that
when he sat down at table, he could scarce sit
upright; and in less than three minutes began to
nod in his chair. Peregrine, who had foreseen
<PB N="25" REF="34"/>
and provided for this occasion, advised him to
exhilarate his spirits with a glass of wine; and the
proposal being embraced, tipt his valet de cham∣bre
the wink, who, according to the instructions
he had received, qualified the Burgundy with
thirty drops of laudanum, which this unfortunate
husband swallowed in one glass. The dose co∣operating
with his former drowsiness, lulled him
so fast asleep, as it were instantaneously, that it
was found necessary to convey him to his own
chamber, where his footman undressed and put
him to bed. Nor was Jolter (naturally of a slug∣gish
disposition) able to resist his propensity to
sleep, without suffering divers dreadful yawns,
which encouraged his pupil to administer the same
dose to him, which had operated so successfully
upon the other Argus. This cordial had not such
a gentle effect upon the rugged organs of Jolter
as upon the more delicate nerves of Hornbeck;
but discovered itself in certain involuntary start∣ings,
and convulsive motions in the muscles of
his face; and when his nature at length yielded
to the power of this medicine, he sounded the
trumpet so loud through his nostrils, that our
adventurer was afraid the noise would awake his
other patient, and consequently prevent the ac∣complishment
of his aim. The governor was
therefore committed to the care of Pipes, who
lugged him into the next room, and having strip∣ped
off his cloaths, tumbled him into his nest,
while the two lovers remained at full liberty to
indulge their mutual passion.</P>
<P>Peregrine, in the impatience of his inclination,
would have finished the fate of Hornbeck imme∣diately;
but his inamorata disapproved of his in∣tention,
and represented that their being together
<PB N="26" REF="35"/>
by themselves for any length of time, would be
observed by her servant, who was kept as a spy
upon her actions; so that they had recourse to
another scheme, which was executed in this
manner: He conducted her into her own apart∣ment,
in presence of her sootman, who lighted
them thither, and wishing her good rest, returned
to his own chamber, where he waited till every
thing was quiet in the house; and then stealing
softly to her door, which had been left open for
his admission in the dark, he found the husband
still secure in the embraces of sleep, and the lady
in a loose gown, ready to seal his happiness. He
seized opportunity by the forelock, and bearing
her in his arms to the place from whence he
came, she was revenged upon the cuckold for the
uneasy life he had made her lead, and our hero
enjoyed the luscious fruits of his conquest.</P>
<P>Their guilty raptures, however, were not with∣out
allay. The opium which had been given to
Jolter, together with the wine he had drank,
produced such a perturbation in his fancy, that he
was visited with horrible dreams, and among other
miserable situations, imagined himself in danger
of perishing in the flames, which he thought had
taken hold on his apartment. This vision made
such an impression upon his faculties, that he
alarmed the whole house with the repeated cries
of <HI>Fire! Fire!</HI> and even leaped out of his bed,
though he still remained fast asleep. The lovers
were very disagreeably disturbed by this dreadful
exclamation, and Mrs. Hornbeck running in great
confusion to the door, had the mortification to
see the footman with a light in his hand, enter
her husband's chamber, in order to give them
notice of this accident. She knew that she would
<PB N="27" REF="36"/>
be instantly missed, and could easily divine the
consequence, unless her invention could immedi∣ately
trump up some plausible excuse for her ab∣sence.</P>
<P>Women are naturally fruitful of expedients in
cases of such emergency; she employed but a few
seconds in recollection, and rushing directly to∣wards
the apartment of the governor, who still
continued to hollow in the same note, exclaimed
in a screaming tone, “Lord have mercy upon
us! where! where!” By this time, all the ser∣vants
were assembled in strange attire; Peregrine
slipt on his breeches, burst into Jolter's room, and
seeing him stalking in his shirt with his eyes shut,
bestowed such a slap upon his buttocks, as in a
moment dissolved his dream, and restored him to
the use of his senses. He was astonished and
ashamed at being discovered in such an indecent
attitude; and taking refuge under the cloaths,
asked pardon of all present for the disturbance he
had occasioned; soliciting with great humility
the forgiveness of the lady, who, to a miracle,
counterfeited the utmost agitation of terror and
surprize. Mean while, Hornbeck being awakened
by the repeated efforts of his man, no sooner un∣derstood
that his wife was missing, than all the
chimera's of jealousy taking possession of his ima∣gination,
he started up in a sort of frenzy, and
snatching his sword, flew straight to Peregrine's
chamber, where, though he found not that which
he looked for, he unluckily perceived upon the
bed an under-petticoat, which his wife had forgot
in the hurry of her retreat. This discovery add∣ed
fuel to the flame of his resentment. He
seized the fatal proof of his dishonour, and meet∣ing
his spouse in her return to bed, presented it
<PB N="28" REF="37"/>
to her view, saying, with a most expressive coun∣tenance,
“Madam, you have dropped your un∣der-petticoat
in the next room.” Mrs. Hornbeck,
who inherited from nature a most admirable pre∣sence
of mind, looked earnestly at the object in
question, and with incredible serenity of counte∣nance,
affirmed that the petticoat must belong to
the house, for she had none such in her possession.
Peregrine, who walked behind her, hearing this
asseveration, immediately interposed, and pulling
Hornbeck by the sleeve into his chamber, “Gads∣zooks!
said he, what business had you with that
petticoat? Can't you let a young fellow enjoy a
little amour with an innkeeper's daughter, with∣out
exposing his infirmities to your wife? Pshaw!
that's so malicious, because you have quitted
these adventures yourself, to spoil the sport of
other people.” The poor husband was so con∣founded
at the effrontery of his wife, and this
cavalier declaration of the young man, that his
faith began to waver; he distrusted his own con∣scious
diffidence of temper, which that he might
not expose, he expressed no doubts of Peregrine's
veracity, but asking pardon for the mistake he
had committed, retired with a grim look, not
yet satisfied with the behaviour of his ingenious
helpmate, but on the contrary determined to in∣quire
more minutely into the circumstances of
this adventure; which turned out so little to his
satisfaction, that he ordered his servant to get
every thing ready for his departure by break of
day; and when our adventurer rose next morn∣ing,
he found that his fellow-travellers were gone
above three hours, though they had agreed to
stay all the forenoon, with a view of seeing the
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
prince of Conde's palace, and to proceed all to∣gether
for Paris in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Peregrine was a little chagrined, when he un∣derstood
that he was so suddenly deprived of this
almost untasted morsel; and Jolter could not
conceive the meaning of their abrupt and uncivil
disappearance, which after many profound con∣jectures,
he accounted for, by supposing that
Hornbeck was some sharper who had run away
with an heiress, whom he found it necessary to
conceal from the inquiry of her friends.</P>
<P>The pupil, who was well assured of the true
motive, allowed his governor to enjoy the triumph
of his own penetration, and consoled himself with
the hope of seeing his Dulcinea again at some of
the public places in Paris, which he proposed to
frequent. Thus comforted, he visited the mag∣nificent
stables and palace of Chantilly, and im∣mediately
after dinner set out for Paris, where
they arrived in the evening, and hired apartments
at an hotel in the Fauxbourg St. Germaine, not
far from the playhouse.</P>

into the beau monde.</HEAD>
<P>THEY were no sooner settled in these lodg∣ings,
than our hero wrote to his uncle an
account of their safe arrival, and sent another
letter to his friend Gauntlet, with a very tender
billet inclosed for his dear Emilia, to whom he
repeated all his former vows of constancy and love.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="39"/>
The next care that ingrossed him was that of
bespeaking several suits of cloaths suitable to the
French mode, and in the mean time he never ap∣peared
abroad, except in the English coffee-house,
where he soon became acquainted with some of
his own countrymen, who were at Paris on the
same footing with himself. The third evening
after his journey, he was engaged in a party of
those young sparks, at the house of a noted Trai∣teur,
whose wife was remarkably handsome, and
otherwise extremely well qualified for alluring
customers to her house. To this lady our young
gentleman was introduced as a stranger fresh
from England; and he was charmed with her
personal accomplishments, as well as with the
freedom and gaiety of her conversation: having
sat with them about an hour, she got up in order
to retire, but being earnestly intreated to favour
them with her company at supper, she promised
to gratify their desire, and told them, without any
ceremony or circumlocution, that she would
only step into the next room to make water, and
return in an instant. This frank declaration
founded so oddly in the ears of Peregrine, that he
concluded he might, without offence, take any
fort of liberty with a woman who could thus be∣have
so wide of decency and decorum; and on
this supposition, he followed her cavalierly to her
closet, where he addressed her in such palpable
terms, as he thought her character intitled him
to use. She was surprised at his confidence, which
she began to rally as a specimen of English plain
dealing, while she very deliberately executed in
his presence the intent of her withdrawing; and
he still more encouraged by this deportment,
urged his suit with such impetuosity, that the fair
<PB N="31" REF="40"/>
Burgeoise was compelled to cry aloud in defence
of her own virtue. Her husband ran immediately
to her assistance, and finding her in a very alarm∣ing
si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uation, flew upon her ravisher with such
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ury, that he was fain to quit his prey, and turn
against the exasperated Traiteur, whom he pu∣nished
without mercy for his impudent intrusion.
The lady seeing her yokefellow treated with so
little respect, espoused his cause, and fixing her
nails in his antagonist's face, scarified all one side
of his nose. The noise of this encounter brought
all the servants of the house to the rescue of their
master, and Peregrine's company arriving at the
same time, a general battle ensued, in which the
French were totally routed, the wife being in∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lted,
and the husband kicked down stairs.</P>
<P>The publican enraged at the indignity which
had been offered to him and his family, went out
into the street, and implored the protection of
the guet or city-guard, which having heard his
complaint, fixed their bayonets and surrounded
the door, to the number of twelve or fourteen.
The young gentlemen flushed with their success,
and considering the soldiers as so many London
watchmen, whom they had often put to flight,
drew their swords, and sallied out, with Peregrine
at their head. Whether the guard respected them
as foreigners, or inexperienced youths intoxicated
with liquor, they opened to right and left, and
gave them 100m to pass, without opposition. This
complaisance, which was the effect of compassion,
being misinterpreted by the English leader, he
out of meer wantonness attempted to trip up the
heels of the soldier that stood next him, but
failed in the execution, and received a blow on
his breast with the butt end of a fusil, that made
<PB N="32" REF="41"/>
him stagger several paces backward. Incensed at
this audacious application, the whole company
charged the detachment sword in hand, and after
an obstinate engagement, in which divers wounds
were given and received, every soul of them was
taken, and conveyed to the main-guard, where
the commanding officer being made acquainted
with the circumstances of the quarrel, in consi∣deration
of their youth and national ferocity, for
which the French make large allowances, set them
ad at liberty, after having gently rebuked them
for the irregularity and insolence of their conduct:
so that all our hero acquired by his gallantry and
courage, was a number of scandalous marks upon
his village, that confined him a whole week to his
chamber. It was impossible to conceal this disaster
from Mr. Jolter, who having got intelligence of
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, did not fail to remonstrate against
the rashness of the adventure, which, he ob∣served,
must have been fatal to them, had their
enemies been other than Frenchmen, who of all
nations under the sun, most rigorously observe
the laws of hospitality.</P>
<P>As the governor's acquaintance lay chiefly
among Irish and English priests, and a set of low
people, who live by making themselves necessary
to strangers, either in teaching the French lan∣guage,
or executing small commissions with which
they are intrusted, he was not the most proper
person in the world for regulating the taste of a
young gentleman who travelled for improvement,
in expectation of making a figure one day in his
own country; and being conscious of his own
incapacit, he contented himself with the office
of a steward, and kept a faithful account of all
the money that was disbursed in the course of
<PB N="33" REF="42"/>
their family expence: not but that he was ac∣quainted
with all the places which are visited by
strangers on their first arrival at Paris; and knew
to a liard what was commonly given to the Swiss
of each remarkable hotel; though, with respect
to the curious painting and statuary that every
where abound in that metropolis, he was more
ignorant than the domestic that attends for a livre
a day.</P>
<P>In short, Mr. Jolter could give a very good
account of the stages on the road, and save the
expence of Antonini's detail of the curiosities in
Paris; he was a connoisseur in ordinaries, from
twelve to five and thirty livres, knew all the rates
of a Fiacre and Remise, could dispute with a Tail∣leur
or Traiteur upon the articles of his bill, and
scold the servants in tolerable French. But the
laws, customs and genius of the people, the cha∣racters
of individuals, and scenes of polished life,
were subjects which he had neither opportunities
to observe, inclination to consider, or discernment
to distinguish. All his maxims were the sugges∣tions
of pedantry and prejudice; so that his per∣ception
was obscured, his judgment biassed, his
address aukward, and his conversation absurd and
unentertaining: yet such as I have represented this
tutor, is the greatest part of those animals who
lead raw boys about the world, under the deno∣mination
of travelling governors. Peregrine,
therefore, being perfectly well acquainted with
the extent of Mr. Jolter's abilities, never dreamt
of consulting him in the disposition of his conduct,
but parcelled out his time according to the dic∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tes
of his own reflection, and the information
and direction of his companions, who had lived
<PB N="34" REF="43"/>
longer in France, and consequently were better
acquainted with the pleasures of the place.</P>
<P>As soon as he was in a condition to appear a la
Françoise, he hired a genteel chariot by the
month, made the tour of the Luxembourg gal∣lery,
Palais Royal, all the remarkable hotels,
churches and celebrated places in Paris; visited
St. Cloud, Marli, Versailles, Trianon, St. Ger∣main,
and Fountainbleau; enjoyed the opera,
masquerades, Italian and French comedy; and
seldom failed of appearing in the public walks,
in hopes of meeting with Mrs. Hornbeck, or
some adventure suited to his romantic disposition.
He never doubted that his person would attract
the notice of some distinguished inamorata, and
was vain enough to believe that few female hearts
were able to resist the artillery of his accomplish∣ments,
if once he had an opportunity of planting
it to advantage. He presented himself, how∣ever,
at all the <HI>Spectacles</HI> for many weeks, with∣out
reaping the fruits of his expectation; and be∣gan
to entertain a very indifferent idea of the
French discernment, which had overlooked him so
long, when one day in his way to the opera, his
chariot was stopped by an <HI>embarras</HI> in the street,
occasioned by two peasants, who having driven
their carts against each other, quarrelled, and
went to loggerheads on the spot. Such a rencoun∣ter
is so uncommon in France, that the people
shut up their shops, and from their windows
threw cold water upon the combatants, with a
view of putting an end to the battle, which was
maintained with great fury and very little skill,
until one of them receiving an accidental fall,
the other took the advantage of this misfortune,
and fastening upon him as he lay, began to thump
<PB N="35" REF="44"/>
the pavement with his head. Our hero's equipage
being detained close by the field of this contention,
Pipes could not bear to see the laws of boxing so
scandalously transgressed, and leaping from his
station, pulled the offender from his antagonist,
whom he raised up, and in the English language,
encouraged to a second essay, instructing him at
the same time, by clenching his fists according to
art, and putting himself in a proper attitude.
Thus confirmed, the enraged carman sprung upon
his foe, and in all appearance would have effec∣tually
revenged the injury he had sustained, if he
had not been prevented by the interposition of a
lacquey belonging to a nobleman, whose coach
was obliged to halt in consequence of the dispute.
This footman, who was distinguished by a cane,
descending from his post, without the least cere∣mony
or expostulation, began to employ his wea∣pon
upon the head and shoulders of the peasant
who had been patronized by Pipes; upon which
Thomas resenting such ungenerous behaviour,
bestowed such a stomacher upon the officious in∣termeddler,
as discomposed the whole oeconomy
of his entrails, and obliged him to discharge the
interjection ah! with demonstrations of great an∣guish
and amazement. The other two footmen
who stood behind the coach, seeing their fellow-servant
so insolently assaulted, flew to his assist∣ance,
and rained a most disagreeable shower
upon the head of his aggressor, who had no
means of diversion or defence. Peregrine, though
he did not approve of Tom's conduct, could not
bear to see him so roughly handled, especially as
he thought his own honour concerned in the fray,
and therefore quitting his machine, came to the
rescue of his attendant, and charged his adversa∣ries
<PB N="36" REF="45"/>
sword in hand. Two of them no sooner
perceived this reinforcement, than they betook
themselves to flight; and Pipes having twisted the
cane out of the hands of the third, belaboured
him so unmercifully, that our hero thought pro∣per
to interpose his authority in his behalf. The
common people stood aghast at this unprecedented
boldness of Pickle, who understanding that the
person whose servants he had disciplined, was a
general and prince of the blood, went up to the
coach, and asked pardon for what he had done,
imputing his own behaviour to his ignorance of
the other's quality. The old nobleman accepted
of his apology with great politeness, thanking
him for the trouble he had taken to reform the
manners of his domesticks; and guessing from
our youth's appearance that he was some stranger
of condition, very courteously invited him into
the coach, on the supposition that they were both
bound for the opera. Pickle gladly embraced this
opportunity of becoming acquainted with a per∣son
of such rank, and ordering his own chariot to
follow, accompanied the count to his <HI>loge,</HI> where
he conversed with him during the whole enter∣tainment.</P>
<P>He soon perceived that Peregrine was not de∣ficient
in spirit or sense, and seemed particularly
pleased with his engaging manner and easy de∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tment,
qualifications for which the English
nation is by no means remarkable in France, and
therefore the more conspicaous and agreeable in
the character of our hero, whom the nobleman
carried home that same evening, and introduced
to his lady, and several persons of fashion who
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pped at his house. Peregrine was quite capti∣vated
by their a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able behaviour and the vivacity
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
of their discourse; and after having been honoured
with particular marks of consideration, took his
leave, fully determined to cultivate such a valu∣able
acquaintance.</P>
<P>His vanity suggested, that now the time was
come when he should profit by his talents among
the fair sex, on whom he resolved to employ his
utmost art and address. With this view he assi∣duously
engaged in all parties to which he had ac∣cess,
by means of his noble friend, who let slip
no opportunity of gratifying his ambition. He
for some time shared in all his amusements, and
was entertained in many of the best families of
France; but he did not long enjoy that elevation
of hope which had flattered his imagination. He
soon perceived that it would be impossible to
maintain the honourable connexions he had made,
without engaging every day at quadrille, or in
other words, losing his money; for every person
of rank, whether male or female, was a pro∣fefsed
gamester, who knew and practised all the
sinesse of the art, of which he was intirely igno∣rant.
Besides, he began to find himself a meer
novice in French gallantry, which is supported by
an amazing volubility of tongue, an obsequious
and incredible attention to trifles, a surprising fa∣culty
of laughing out of pure complaisance, and a
nothingness of conversation, which he could never
attain. In short, our hero, who among his own
countrymen would have passed for a sprightly en∣tertaining
fellow, was considered in the brilliant
assemblies of France as a youth of a very phleg∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tic
disposition. No wonder then that his pride
was mortified at his own want of importance,
which he did not sail to ascribe to their defect in
point of judgment and taste; he conceived a
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
disgust at the mercenary conduct, as well as the
shallow intellects of the ladies; and after he had
spent some months, and a round sum of money,
in fruitless attendance and addresses, he fairly
quitted the pursuit, and consoled himself with
the conversation of a merry <HI>Fille de joye,</HI> whose
good graces he acquired by an allowance of twenty
Louis per month; and that he might the more
easily afford this expence, dismissed his chariot and
French lacquey at the same time.</P>
<P>He then entered himself in a noted academy,
in order to finish his exercises, and contracted an
acquaintance with a few sensible people, whom
he distinguished at the coffee-house and ordinary
to which he resorted, and who contributed not a
little to the improvement of his knowledge and
taste; for, prejudice apart, it must be owned
that France abounds with men of consummate
honour, profound sagacity, and the most liberal
education. From the conversation of such, he
obtained a distinct idea of their government and
constitution; and though he could not help ad∣miring
the excellent order and oeconomy of their
police, the result of all his inquiries was self-con∣gratulation
on his title to the privileges of a Bri∣tish
subject. Indeed this invaluable birthright
was rendered conspicuous by such flagrant occur∣rences,
which fell every day almost under his ob∣servation,
that nothing but the grossest prejudice
could dispute its existence.</P>

<P>AMONG many other instances of the same
nature, I believe it will not be amiss to
exhibit a few specimens of their administration,
which happened during his abode at Paris, that
those who have not the opportunity of observing
for themselves, or are in danger of being in∣fluenced
by misrepresentation, may compare their
own condition with that of their neighbours, and
do justice to the constitution under which they
live.</P>
<P>A lady of distinguished character having been
lampooned by some obscure scribler, who could
not be discovered, the ministry, in consequence
of her complaint, ordered no fewer than five and
twenty abbés to be apprehended and sent to the
Bastile, on the maxim of Herod, when he com∣manded
the innocents to be murdered, hoping
that the principal object of his cruelty would
not escape in the general calamity; and the
friends of those unhappy prisoners durst not even
complain of the unjust persecution, but shrugged
up their shoulders, and in silence deplored their
misfortune, uncertain whether or not they should
ever set eyes on them again.</P>
<P>About the same time, a gentleman of family,
who had been oppressed by a certain powerful
duke that lived in the neighbourhood, found
<PB N="40" REF="49"/>
means to be introduced to the king, who re∣ceiving
his petition very graciously, asked in
what regiment he served; and when the memo∣rialist
answered, that he had not the honour of
being in the service, returned the paper unopen∣ed,
and refused to hear one circumstance of his
complaint; so that, far from being redressed, he
remained more than ever exposed to the tyranny
of his oppressors: nay, so notorious is the dis∣couragement
of all those who presume to live
independent of court-favour and connexions,
that one of the gentlemen, whose friendship Pe∣regrine
cultivated, frankly owned he was in pos∣session
of a most romantic place in one of the
provinces, and deeply enamoured of a country
life; and yet he durst not reside upon his own
estate, lest by slackening in his attendance up∣on
the great, who honoured him with their pro∣tection,
he should fall a prey to some rapacious
intendant.</P>
<P>As for the common people, they are so much
inured to the scourge and insolence of power,
that every shabby subaltern, every beggarly cadet
of the noblesse, every low retainer to the court,
insults and injures them with impunity. A cer∣tain
Ecuyer, or horse-dealer, belonging to the
king, being one day under the hands of a barber,
who by accident cut the head of a pimple on his
face, he started up, and drawing his sword,
wounded him desperately in the shoulder. The
poor tradesman, hurt as he was, made an effort
to retire, and was followed by this barbarous as∣sassin,
who not contented with the vengeance he
had taken, plunged his sword a second time into
his body, and killed him on the spot. Having
<PB N="41" REF="50"/>
performed this inhuman exploit, he dressed him∣self
with great deliberation, and going to Ver∣sailles,
immediately obtained a pardon for what
he had done; triumphing in his brutality with
such insolence, that the very next time he had
occasion to be shaved, he sat with his sword ready
drawn, in order to repeat the murder, in case
the barber should commit the same mistake. Yet
so tamed are those poor people to subjection, that
when Peregrine mentioned this assassination to
his own trimmer, with expressions of horror and
detestation, the insatuated wretch replied, that
without all doubt it was a misfortune, but it pro∣ceeded
from the gentleman's passion; and ob∣served,
by way of encomium on the govern∣ment,
that such vivacity is never punished in
France.</P>
<P>A few days after this outrage was committed,
our youth, who was a professed enemy to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
oppression, being in one of the first loges at the
comedy, was eye-witness of an adventure which
filled him with indignation: a tall, ferocious fel∣low
in the parterre, without the least provoca∣tion,
but prompted by the meer wantonness of
pride, took hold of the hat of a very decent young
man who happened to stand before him, and
twirled it round upon his head. The party thus
offended turned to his aggressor, and divilly asked
the reason of such treatment; but he received no
answer; and when he looked the other way, the
insult was repeated: upon which he expressed his
resentment as became a man of spirit, and desired
the offender to walk out with him. No sooner
did he thus signify his intention, than his adver∣sary,
swelling with rage, cocked his hat fiercely
in his face, and fixing his hands in his sides, pro∣nounced
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
with the most imperious tone, “Heark
ye, Mr. Round Periwig, you must know that I
am a mousquetaire.” Scarce had this awful word
escaped from his lips, when the blood forsook the
lips of the poor challenger, who with the most
abject submission begged pardon for his pre∣sumption,
and with difficulty obtained it, on con∣dition
that he should immediately quit the place.
Having thus exercised his authority, he turned
to one of his companions, and with an air of
disdainful ridicule, told him he was like to have
had an affair with a Bourgeois; adding, by way
of heightening the irony, “Egad! I believe he's
a physician.”</P>
<P>Our hero was so much shocked and irritated
at this licentious behaviour, that he could not
suppress his resentment, which he manifested, by
saying to this Hector, “Sir, a physician may be
a man of honour.” To this remonstrance,
which was delivered with a very significant coun∣tenance,
the mousquetaire made no other reply,
but that of ecchoing his assertion with a loud
laugh, in which he was joined by his confederates;
and Peregrine glowing with resentment, called
him a <HI>Fanfaron,</HI> and withdrew, in expectation
of being followed into the street. The other
understood the hint, and a rencounter must have
ensued, had not the officer of the guard, who
overheard what passed, prevented their meeting,
by putting the mousquetaire immediately under
arrest. Our young gentleman waited at the door
of the parterre, until he was informed of this
interposition, and then went home very much
chagrined at his disappintment; for he was an
utter stranger to fear and diffidence on these oc∣casions,
and had set his heart upon chastising the
<PB N="43" REF="52"/>
insolence of this bully, who had treated him with
such disrespect.</P>
<P>This adventure was not so private but that
it reached the ears of Mr. Jolter, by the canal
of some English gentlemen who were present
when it happened; and the governor, who en∣tertained
a most dreadful idea of the mousquetaires,
being alarmed at a quarrel, the consequence of
which might be fatal to his charge, waited on
the British embassador, and begged he would
take Peregrine under his immediate protection.
His excellency having heard the circumstances
of the dispute, sent one of his gentlemen to in∣vite
the youth to dinner; and after having assured
him that he might depend upon his countenance
and regard, represented the rashness and impe∣tuosity
of his conduct so much to his conviction,
that he promised to act more circumspectly for
the future, and drop all thoughts of the mousque∣taire
from that moment.</P>
<P>A few days after he had taken this laudable re∣solution,
Pipes, who had carried a billet to his
mistress, informed him, that he had perceived a
laced hat lying upon a marble slab in her apart∣ment;
and that when she came out of her own
chamber to receive the letter, she appeared in
manifest disorder.</P>
<P>From these hints of intelligence, our young
gentleman suspected, or rather made no doubt of
her insidelity; and being by this time well nigh
cloyed with possession, was not sorry to find that
she had given him cause to renounce her cor∣respondence.
That he might therefore detect
her in the very breach of duty, and at the same
time punish the gallant who had the presumption
to invade his territories, he concerted with him∣self
<PB N="44" REF="53"/>
a plan, which was executed in this manner:
During his next interview with his Dulcinea,
far from discovering the least sign of jealousy or
discontent, he affected the appearance of ex∣traordinary
fondness; and after having spent the
afternoon with the shew of uncommon satisfac∣tion,
told her he was engaged in a party for
Fountainbleau, and would set out from Paris that
same evening; so that he should not have the
pleasure of seeing her again for some days.</P>
<P>The lady, who was very well versed in the
arts of her occupation, pretended to receive this
piece of news with great affliction, and conjured
him with such marks of real tenderness, to return
as soon as possible to her longing arms, that he went
away almost convinced of her sincerity. Deter∣mined,
however, to prosecute his scheme, he
actually departed from Paris with two or three
gentlemen of his acquaintance, who had hired a
Remise for a jaunt to Versailles; and having ac∣companied
them as far as the village of Passé, re∣turned
in the dusk of the evening on foot.</P>
<P>He waited impatiently till midnight, and then
arming himself with a pair of pocket-pistols, and
attended by trusty Tom with a cudgel in his
hand, repaired to the lodgings of his suspected
inamorata; and having given Pipes his cue,
knocked gently at the door, which was no sooner
opened by the lacquey than he bolted in, before
the fellow could recollect himself from the con∣fusion
occasioned by his unexpected appearance;
and leaving Tom to guard the door, ordered the
trembling valet to light him up stairs into his la∣dy's
apartment. The first object that presented
itself to his view, when he entered the anti∣chamber,
was a sword upon the table, which he
<PB N="45" REF="54"/>
immediately seized, exclaiming in a loud and me∣nacing
voice, that his mistress was false, and then
in bed with another gallant, whom he would
instantly put to death. This declaration, con∣firmed
by many terrible oaths, he calculated for
the hearing of his rival, who understanding his
sanguinary purpose, started up in great trepida∣tion,
and naked as he was, dropt from the
balcony into the street, while Peregrine thun∣dered
at the door for admittance; and guessing
his design, gave him an opportunity of making
this precipitate retreat. Pipes, who stood centi∣nel
at the door, observing the fugitive descend,
attacked him with his cudgel, and sweating him
from one end of the street to the other, at last
committed him to the guet, by whom he was
conveyed to the officer on duty in a most dis∣graceful
and deplorable condition.</P>
<P>Mean while, Peregrine having burst open the
chamber door, found the lady in the utmost
dread and consternation, and the spoils of her
favourite scattered about the room: but his re∣sentment
was doubly gratified, when he learnt
upon inquiry, that the person who had been so dis∣agreeably
interrupted, was no other than that indi∣vidual
mousquetaire with whom he had quarreled
at the comedy. He upbraided the nymph with
her perfidy and ingratitude, and telling her that
she must not expect the continuance of his re∣gard,
or the appointments which she had hitherto
enjoyed from his bounty, went home to his own
lodgings, overjoyed at the issue of the adventure.</P>
<P>The soldier, exasperated at the disgrace he
had undergone, as well as at the outragious in∣sult
of the English valet, whom he believed his
master had tutored for that purpose, no sooner
<PB N="46" REF="55"/>
extricated himself from the opprobrious situation
he had incurred, than breathing vengeance against
the author of the affront, he came to Peregrine's
apartment, and demanded satisfaction upon the
ramparts next morning before sun-rise. Our
hero assured him, he would not fail to pay his res∣pects
to him at the time and place appointed;
and foreseeing that he might be prevented from
keeping this engagement by the officious care of
his governor, who saw the mousquetaire come in,
he told Mr. Jolter, that the Frenchman had vi∣sited
him in consequence of an order he had re∣ceived
from his superiors, to make an apology for
his rude behaviour to him in the playhouse, and
that they had parted very good friends. This
assurance, together with Pickle's tranquil and
unconcerned behaviour thro' the day, quieted the
terrors which had begun to take possession of his
tutor's imagination; so that the youth had an
opportunity of giving him the slip at night, when
he betook himself to the lodgings of a friend,
whom he engaged as his second, and with whom
he immediately took the field, in order to avoid
the search which Jolter, upon missing him, might
set on foot.</P>
<P>This was a necessary precaution; for as he
did not appear at supper, and Pipes, who usually
attended him in his excursions, could give no ac∣count
of his motions, the governor was dread∣fully
alarmed at his absence, and ordered his man
to run in quest of his master to all the places
which he used to frequent, while he himself went
to the commissaire, and communicating his sus∣picions,
was accommodated with a party of the
horse-guards, who patroled round all the <HI>environs</HI>
of the city, with a view of preventing the ren∣counter,
<PB N="47" REF="56"/>
Pipes might have directed them to the
lady, by whose information they could have learnt
the name and lodgings of the mousquetaire, who
being apprehended, the duel would not have hap∣pened;
but he did not choose to run the risk of
disobliging his master, by intermeddling in the
affair, and was, moreover, very desirous that the
Frenchman should be humbled; for he never
doubted that Peregrine was more than a match
for any two men in France. In this confidence,
therefore, he sought his master with great dili∣gence,
not with a view of disappointing his inten∣tion,
but in order to attend him to the battle, that
he might stand by him, and see justice done.</P>
<P>While this inquiry was carried on, our hero
and his companion concealed themselves among
some weeds that grew on the edge of the parapet,
a few yards from the spot where he had agreed to
meet the mousquetaire; and scarce had the morn∣ing
rendered objects distinguishable, when they
perceived their men advancing boldly to the place.
Peregrine seeing them approach, sprung forward
to the ground, that he might have the glory of
anticipating his antagonist; and swords being
drawn, all four were engaged in a twinkling.
Pickle's eagerness had well nigh cost him his life;
for, without minding his footing, he flew di∣rectly
to his opposite, and stumbling over a stone,
was wounded on one side of his head before he
could recover his attitude. Far from being dis∣spirited
at this check, it served only to animate
him the more; being endowed with uncommon
agility, he retrieved his posture in a moment,
and having parried a second thrust, returned the
longe with such incredible speed, that the soldier
had not time to resume his guard, but was im∣mediately
<PB N="48" REF="57"/>
run through the bend of his right arm;
and the sword dropping out of his hand, our he∣ro's
victory was compleat.</P>
<P>Having dispatched his own business, and re∣ceived
the acknowledgment of his adversary, who
with a look of infinite mortification observed,
that his was the fortune of the day, he ran to
part the seconds, just as the weapon was twisted
out of his companion's hand: upon which he
took his place; and, in all likelihood, an obsti∣nate
dispute would have ensued, had they not
been interrupted by the guard, at sight of whom
the two Frenchmen scampered off, while our
young gentleman and his friend allowed them∣selves
to be taken prisoners by the detachment
which had been sent out for that purpose, and
were carried before the magistrate, who having
sharply reprimanded them for presuming to act
in contempt of the laws, set them at liberty, in
consideration of their being strangers, cautioning
them at the same time to beware of such exploits
for the future.</P>
<P>When Peregrine returned to his own lodgings,
Pipes seeing the blood trickling down upon his
master's neckcloth and solitaire, gave evident to∣kens
of surprize and concern, not for the con∣sequences
of the wound, which he did not sup∣pose
dangerous, but for the glory of Old England,
which he was afraid had suffered in the engage∣ment;
for, he could not help saying, with an air
of chagrin, as he followed the youth into his
chamber, “I do suppose as how you gave that
lubberly Frenchman as good as he brought.”</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. Jolter threatens to leave him on account of his
misconduct, which he promises to rectify; but
his resolution is defeated by the impetuosity of his
passions. He meets accidentally with Mrs. Horn∣beck,
who elopes with him from her husband,
but is restored by the interposition of the British
embassador.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Mr. Jolter was extremely well
pleased at the safety of his pupil, he could
not forgive him for the terror and anxiety he had
undergone on his account; and roundly told him,
that notwithstanding the inclination and attach∣ment
he had to his person, he would imme∣diately
depart for England, if ever he should hear
of his being involved in such another adventure;
for it could not be expected that he would sacri∣fice
his own quiet, to an unrequited regard for
one who seemed determined to keep him in con∣tinual
uneasiness and apprehension.</P>
<P>To this declaration Pickle made answer, that
Mr. Jolter, by this time, ought to be convinced
of the attention he had always paid to his ease
and satisfaction; since he well knew, that he
had ever looked upon him in the light of a friend
rather than as a counsellor or tutor, and desired
his company in France with a view of promoting
his interest, and not for any emolument he could
expect from his instruction. This being the case,
he was at liberty to consult his own inclinations
with regard to going or staying; though he could
not help owning himself obliged by the concern
he expressed for his safety, and would endeavour,
<PB N="50" REF="59"/>
for his own sake, to avoid giving him any cause
of disturbance in time to come.</P>
<P>No man was more capable of moralizing upon
Peregrine's misconduct than himself; his reflec∣tions
were extremely just and sagacious, and at∣tended
with no other disadvantage, but that of
occurring too late. He projected a thousand sa∣lutary
schemes of deportment, but, like other
projectors, he never had interest enough with
the ministry of his passions to bring any one of
them to bear. He had, in the heyday of his gal∣lantry,
received a letter from his friend Gaunt∣let,
with a kind postscript from his charming
Emilia; but it arrived at a very unseasonable
juncture, when his imagination was engrossed by
conquests that more agreeably flattered his ambi∣tion;
so that he could not find leisure and incli∣nation,
from that day, to honour the correspon∣dence
which he himself had sollicited; and his
vanity had, by this time, disapproved of the en∣gagement
he had contracted in the rawness and
inexperience of youth; suggesting, that he was
born to make such an important figure in life, as
ought to raise his ideas above the consideration of
any such middling connections, and fix his atten∣tion
upon objects of the most sublime attraction.
These dictates of ridiculous pride had almost ef∣faced
the remembrance of his amiable mistress,
or at least so far warped his morals and integrity,
that he actually began to conceive hopes of her
altogether unworthy of his own character and her
deserts.</P>
<P>Mean while, being destitute of a toy for the
dalliance of his idle hours, he employed several
spies, and almost every day made a tour of the
public places in person, with a view of pro∣curing
<PB N="51" REF="60"/>
intelligence of Mr. Hornbeck, with whose
wife he longed to have another interview; and
in this course of expectation had he exercised
himself a whole fortnight, when chancing to be
at the hospital of the invalids with a gentleman
lately arrived from England, he no sooner en∣tered
the church than he perceived this lady, at∣tended
by her spouse, who at sight of our hero
changed colour, and looked another way, in or∣der
to discourage any communication between
them. But the young man, who was not so ea∣sily
repulsed, advanced with great assurance to
his fellow-traveller, and taking him by the hand,
expressed his satisfaction at this unexpected meet∣ing;
and kindly upbraiding him for his precipi∣tate
retreat from Chantilly, before Hornbeck
could make any reply, he went up to his wife,
whom he complimented in the same manner, as∣suring
her with some significant glances, he was
extremely mortified, that she had put it out of
his power to pay his respects to her, on his first
arrival at Paris; and then turning to her husband,
who thought proper to keep close to him in this
conference, begged to know where he could have
the honour of waiting upon him; observing at
the same time, that he himself lived <HI>a l'academie
de Palfrenier.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hornbeck, without making an apology
for his elopement on the road, thanked Mr.
Pickle for his complaisance in a very cool and
disobliging manner; saying, that as he intended
to shift his lodgings in a day or two, he could not
expect the pleasure of seeing him, until he should
be settled, when he would call at the academy,
and conduct him to his new habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="61"/>
Pickle, who was not unacquainted with the
sentiments of this jealous gentleman, did not put
much confidence in his promise, and therefore
made divers efforts to enjoy a little private con∣versation
with his wife; but he was baffled in all
his attempts by the indefatigable vigilance of her
keeper, and reaped no other immediate pleasure
from this accidental meeting, than that of a kind
squeeze while he handed her into the coach.
However, as he had been witness to some in∣stances
of her invention, and was no stranger to
the favourable disposition of her heart, he enter∣tained
some faint hopes of profiting by her un∣derstanding,
and was not deceived in his expec∣tation;
for the very next forenoon a Savoyard
called at the academy, and put the following
billet in his hand:</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="53" REF="62"/>
Our young gentleman was ravished at the re∣ceit
of this elegant epistle, which was directed,
<HI>A Monsr Monsr Pickhell, a la Gaddamme de Paul
Freny,</HI> and did not fail to obey the summons at
the hour of assignation; when the lady, true to
her appointment, beckoned him up stairs, and
he had the good fortune to be admitted unseen.</P>
<P>After the first transports of their mutual joy at
meeting, she told him, that her husband had
been very surly and cross ever since the adventure
at Chantilly, which he had not yet digested;
that he had laid severe injunctions upon her to
avoid all commerce with Pickle, and even threat∣ened
to shut her up in a convent for life, if ever
she should discover the least inclination to renew
that acquaintance; that she had been cooped up
in her chamber since her arrival at Paris, with∣out
being permitted to see the place, or indeed
any company, except that of her landlady, whose
language she did not understand; so that her spi∣rit
being broke, and her health impaired, he was
prevailed upon some days ago to indulge her in a
few airings, during which she had seen the gar∣dens
of the Luxembourg, the Thuilleries and
Palais Royal, though at those times when there
was no company in the walks; and that it was
in one of those excursions she had the happiness
of meeting with him. Finally, she gave him to
understand, that rather than continue longer in
such confinement with the man whom she could
not love, she would instantly give him the slip,
and put herself under the protection of her lover.</P>
<P>Rash and unthinking as this declaration might
be, the young gentleman was so much of a gal∣lant,
that he would not baulk the lady's inclina∣tions,
and too infatuated by his passion to foresee
<PB N="54" REF="63"/>
the consequences of such a dangerous step; he
therefore, without hesitation, embraced the pro∣posal,
and the coast being clear, they sallied into
the street, where Peregrine calling a Fiacre, or∣dered
the coachman to drive them to a tavern:
but knowing it would not be in his power to
conceal her from the search of the lieutenant de
police, if she should remain within the walls of
Paris, he hired a Remise, and carried her that same
evening to Villejuif, about four leagues from
town, where he stayed with her all night; and
having boarded her on a genteel pension, and
settled the oeconomy of his future visits, returned
next day to his own lodgings.</P>
<P>While he thus enjoyed his success, her husband
endured the tortures of the damned. When he
returned from the coffee-house, and understood
that his wife had eloped, without being perceived
by any person in the family, he began to rave
and foam at the mouth with rage and jealousy,
and in the sury of distraction, accused the land-lady
of being an accomplice in her escape, threat∣ening
to complain of her to the commissaire.
The woman could not conceive how Mrs. Horn∣beck,
who she knew was an utter stranger to the
French language, and kept no sort of company,
could elude the caution of her husband, and find
any refuge in a place where she had no ac∣quaintance,
and began to suspect the lodger's
emotion was no other than an affected passion to
conceal his own practices upon his wife, who had
perhaps fallen a sacrifice to his jealous disposition.
She therefore spared him the trouble of putting
his menaces in execution, by going to the magi∣strate
without any further deliberation, and gi∣ving
an account of what she knew concerning
this mysterious affair, with certain insinuations
<PB N="55" REF="64"/>
against Hornbeck's character, which she repre∣sented
as peevish and capricious to the last degree.</P>
<P>While she thus anticipated the purpose of the
plaintiff, her information was interrupted by the
arrival of the party himself, who exhibited his
complaint with such evident marks of perturba∣tion,
anger and impatience, that the commissaire
could easily perceive that he had no share in the
disappearance of his wife; and directed him to
the lieutenant de police, whose province it is to
take cognizance of such occurrences. This gen∣tleman,
who presides over the city of Paris,
having heard the particulars of Hornbeck's mis∣fortune,
asked if he suspected any individual per∣son
as the seducer of his yoke-follow; and when
he mentioned Peregrine as the object of his sus∣picion,
granted a warrant and a detachment of
soldiers, to search for and retrieve the fugitive.</P>
<P>The husband conducted them immediately to
the academy where our hero lodged, and having
rummaged the whole place, to the astonishment
of Mr. Jolter, without finding either his wife or
the supposed ravisher, accompanied them to all
the public houses in the Fauxbourg; which hav∣ing
examined also without success, he returned
to the magistrate in a state of despair, and ob∣taired
a promise of his making such an effectual
inquiry, that in three days he should have an ac∣count
of her, provided she was alive, and within
the walls of Paris.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, who had foreseen all this di∣sturbance,
was not at all surprized when his go∣vernor
told him what had happened; and being
conjured to restore the woman to the right owner,
with many pathetic remonstrances touching the hei∣nous
sin of adultery, the distraction of the unfortu∣nate
<PB N="56" REF="65"/>
husband, and the danger of incurring the re∣sentment
of an arbitrary government, which, upon
application being made, would not fail of espousing
the cause of the injured; he denied, with great
effrontery, that he had the least concern in the
matter, pretended to resent the deportment of
Hornbeck, whom he threatened to chastise for
his scandalous suspicion, and expressed his displea∣sure
at the credulity of Jolter, who seemed to
doubt the veracity of his asseveration.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this confident behaviour, Jolter
could not help entertaining doubts of his since∣rity;
and visiting the disconsolate swain, begged
he would, for the honour of his country, as well
as for the sake of his own reputation, discon∣tinue
his addresses to the lieutenant de police, and
apply to the British Embassador, who by dint of
friendly admonitions, would certainly prevail upon
Mr. Pickle to do him all the justice in his power,
if he was really the author of the injury he had
sustained. The governor urged this advice with
the appearance of so much sympathy and concern,
promising to co-operate with all his influence in
his behalf, that Hornbeck embraced the proposal,
communicated his purpose to the magistrate, who
commended the resolution as the most decent and
desirable expedient he could use, and then waited
upon his excellency, who readily espoused his
cause, and sending for the young gentleman that
same evening, read him such a lecture in private,
as extorted a confession of the whole affair; not
that he assailed him with four and supercilious
maxims, or severe rebuke, because he had pene∣tration
enough to discern, that Peregrine's dis∣position
was impregnable to all such attacks; but
he first of all rallied him upon his intriguing ge∣nius,
<PB N="57" REF="66"/>
then, in an humorous manner, described
the distraction of the poor cuckold, who he owned
was justly punished for the absurdity of his con∣duct;
and lastly, upon the supposition, that it
would be no great effort in Pickle to part with
such a conquest, especially after it was for some
time possessed, represented the necessity and ex∣pediency
of restoring her, not only out of regard
to his own character, and that of his nation,
but also with a view to his ease, which would in
a little time be very much invaded by such an
incumbrance, that in all probability would in∣volve
him in a thousand difficulties and disgusts.
Besides, he assured him, that he was already, by
order of the lieutenant de police, surrounded
with spies, who would watch all his motions, and
immediately discover the retreat in which he
had deposited his prize. These arguments, and
the frank familiar manner in which they were
delivered, but above all, the last consideration, in∣duced
the young gentleman to disclose the whole
of his proceedings to the Embassador, and pro∣mise
to be governed by his direction, provided
the lady should not suffer for the step she had
taken, but be received by her husband with due
reverence and respect. These stipulations being
agreed to, he undertook to produce her in eight
and forty hours; and taking coach immediately,
drove to the place of her residence, where he
spent a whole day and a night in convincing her
of the impossibility of their enjoying each other
in that manner; and returning to Paris, deli∣vered
her into the hands of the Embassador, who
having assured her, that she might depend upon
his friendship and protection, in case she should
find herself aggrieved by the jealous temper of
<PB N="58" REF="67"/>
Mr. Hornbeck, restored her to her legitimate
lord, whom he counselled to exempt her from
that restraint which, in all probability, had been
the cause of her elopement, and endeavour to
conciliate her affection by tender and respectful
usage.</P>
<P>The husband behaved with great humility and
compliance, protesting that his chief study should
be to contrive parties for her pleasure and sa∣tisfaction.
But no sooner did he regain posses∣sion
of his stray-sheep, than he locked her up
more closely than ever; and after having re∣volved
various schemes for her reformation, de∣termined
to board her in a convent, under the
inspection of a prudent abbess, who should su∣perintend
her morals, and recal her to the paths
of virtue, which she had forsaken. With this
view he consulted an English priest of his ac∣quaintance,
who advised him to settle her in a
monastery at Lisle, that she might be as far as
possible from the machinations of her lover; and
gave him a letter of recommendation to the su∣perior
of a certain convent in that place, for
which Mr. Hornbeck set out in a few days with
his troublesome charge.</P>

the young gentleman to return to his
native country, a resolution that was far from
being disagreeable to Jolter, who knew that the
incumbent on a living which was in the gift of
Trunnion, was extremely old, and that it would
be his interest to be upon the spot at the said in∣cumbent's
decease.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who had resided about fifteen
months in France, thought he was now suffici∣ently
qualified for eclipsing most of his cotempo∣raries
in England, and therefore prepared for his
departure with infinite alacrity, being moreover
infl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med with the most ardent desire of revisiting
his friends, and renewing his connections, parti∣cularly
with Emilia, whose heart, he by this
time, thought he was able to reduce on his own
terms.</P>
<P>As he proposed to make the tour of Flanders
and Holland in his return to England, he resolved
to stay in Paris a week or two after his affairs
were settled, in hopes of finding some agreeable
companion disposed for the same journey, and in
order to refresh his memory, made a second cir∣cuit
round all the places in that capital, where
any curious production of art is to be seen. In
the course of this second examination he chanced
to enter the Palais Royal, just as two gentlemen
alighted from a Fiacre at the gate, and all three
being admitted at the same time, he soon per∣ceived
<PB N="60" REF="69"/>
that the strangers were of his own country.
One of them was a young man, in whose air
and countenance appeared all the uncouth gravity
and supercilious self-conceit of a physician piping
hot from his studies, while the other, to whom
his companion spoke by the appellation of Mr.
Pallet, displayed at first fight a strange composi∣tion
of levity and assurance. Indeed their cha∣racters,
dress and address were strongly contrasted;
the doctor wore a suit of black, and a huge tye∣wig,
neither suitable to his own age, nor the fa∣shion
of the country where he then lived; where∣as
the other, though seemingly turned of fifty,
strutted in a gay summer dress of the Parisian cut,
with a bag to his own grey hair, and a red feather
in his hat, which he carried under his arm. As
these figures seemed to promise something enter∣taining,
Pickle entered into conversation with
them immediately, and soon discovered that the
old gentleman was a painter from London, who
had stole a fortnight from his occupation, in order
to visit the remarkable paintings of France and
Flanders; and that the doctor had taken the op∣portunity
of accompanying him in his tour. Be∣ing
extremely talkative, he not only communi∣cated
these particulars to our hero in a very few
minutes after their meeting, but also took occa∣sion
to whisper in his ear, that his fellow traveller
was a man of vast learning, and beyond all doubt,
the greatest poet of the age. As for himself, he
was under no necessity of making his own elo∣gium;
for he soon gave such specimens of his
taste and talents, as left Pickle no room to doubt
of his capacity.</P>
<P>While they stood considering the pictures in
one of the first apartments, which are by no
<PB N="61" REF="70"/>
means the most masterly compositions, the Swiss,
who sets up for a connoisseur, looking at a cer∣tain
piece, pronounced the word <HI>magnifique!</HI>
with a note of admiration; upon which Mr. Pal∣let,
who was not at all a critick in the French
language, replied with great vivacity, “<HI>Manu∣fac,</HI>
you mean, and a very indifferent piece of
manufacture it is; pray gentleman take notice,
there is no keeping in those heads upon the back
ground, nor no relief in the principal figure:
then you'll observe the shadings are harsh to the
last degree; and come a little closer this way—
don't you perceive that the fore-shortening of that
arm is monstrous—agad, sir! there is an absolute
fracture in the limb—doctor, you understand ana∣tomy,
don't you think that muscle evidently mis∣placed?
Heark ye, Mr. what d'ye call um, (turn∣ing
to the attendant) what is the name of the
dauber who painted that miserable performance?”
The Swiss imagining that he was all this time
expressing his satisfaction, sanctioned his supposed
commendation, by exclaiming <HI>sans prix.</HI> “Right,
cried Pallet, I could not recollect his name,
though his manner is quite familiar to me. We
have a few pieces in England, done by that same
sangpree; but there they are in no estimation;
we have more taste among us, than to relish the
productions of such a miserable gout. Isn't he an
ignorant coxcomb, doctor?” The physician a∣shamed
of his companion's blunder, thought it
was necessary for the honour of his own charac∣ter,
to take notice of it before the stranger, and
therefore answered his question, by repeating this
line from Horace,
<Q><HI>Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="71"/>
The painter, who was rather more ignorant of
Latin than of French, taking it for granted that
this quotation of his friend, conveyed an assent to
his opinion, “Very true, said he, a most sensible
observation! mute aye toe numbing he, (what
is't?) Deity, fable honour hate her. It is indeed
a most mute benumbing piece; and the fable
shews that the painter was very little honoured
by the deity.” Peregrine was astonished at this
surprising perversion of the words and meaning of
a Latin line, which, at first, he could not help
thinking was a premeditated joke; but upon
second thoughts, he saw no reason to doubt that
it was the extemporaneous effect of sheer pertness
and ignorance, at which he broke out into an
immoderate fit of laughter. Pallet believing that
the gentleman's mirth was occasioned by his arch
animadversion upon the work of sangpree, un∣derwent
the same emotion in a much louder
strain, and endeavoured to heighten the jest, by
more observations of the same nature; while the
doctor confounded at his impudence and want of
knowledge, reprimanded him in these words of
Homer,
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></Q></P>
<P>This rebuke, the reader will easily perceive, was
not calculated for the meridian of his friend's intel∣lects,
but uttered with a view of raising his own
character in the opinion of Mr. Pickle, who retorted
this parade of learning in three verses from the
same author, being part of the speech of Polyda∣mas
to Hector, importing that it is impossible for
one man to excel in every thing. The self-suffi∣cient
physician, who did not expect such a repar∣tee
<PB N="63" REF="72"/>
from a youth of Peregrine's appearance,
looked upon his reply as a fair challenge, and in∣stantly
rehearsed forty or fifty lines of the Iliad in
a breath; and observing that the stranger made
no effort to match this effusion, interpreted his
silence into submission; then, in order to ascer∣tain
his victory, insulted him with divers frag∣ments
of authors, whom his supposed competitor
did not even know by name; while Mr. Pallet
stared with admiration at the profound scholarship
of his companion. Our young gentleman, far
from repining at this superiority, laughed within
himself at the ridiculous ambition of the pedan∣tic
doctor, who must have been at infinite pains
in conning these detached pieces, with a view of
retailing them in company for the credit of his
genius and knowledge. He rated him in his own
mind as a meer index-hunter, who held the eel of
science by the tail, and foresaw an infinite fund of
diversion in his solemnity and pride, if properly
extracted by means of his fellow-traveller's vanity
and assurance. Prompted by these considerations,
he resolved to cultivate their acquaintance, and, if
possible, amuse himself at their expence in his
journey through Flanders, understanding that they
were determined upon the same route. In this
view he treated them with extraordinary atten∣tion,
and seemed to pay particular deference to
the remarks of the painter, who with great intre∣pidity
pronounced judgment upon every picture in
the palace, or in other words, exposed his own
nakedness, in every sentence that proceeded from
his mouth.</P>
<P>When they came to consider the murder of the
innocents by Le Brun, the Swiss observed that it
was <HI>un beau mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eau,</HI> and Mr. Pallet replied,
<PB N="64" REF="73"/>
“Yes, yes, one may see with half an eye, that
it can be the production of no other; for Bomor∣so's
stile, both in colouring and drapery, is alto∣gether
peculiar; then his design is tame, and his
expression antic and unnatural. Doctor, you<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have seen my judgment of Solomon, I think I
may without presumption—but, I don't choose
to make comparisons, I leave that odious task to
other people, and let my works speak for them∣selves.
France, to be sure, is rich in the arts,
but what is the reason? the king encourages men
of genius with honour and rewards: whereas, in
England, we are obliged to stand upon our own
feet, and combat the envy and malice of our
brethren; agad! I have a good mind to come
and settle here in Paris; I should like to have an
apartment in the Louvre, with a snug pension of
so many thousand livres.” In this manner did
Pallet proceed with an eternal rotation of tongue,
floundering from one mistake to another, until it
was the turn of Poussin's seven sacraments to be
examined. Here again the Swiss out of the abun∣dance
of his zeal, expressed his admiration, by
saying, these pieces were <HI>impayable;</HI> when the
painter turning to him with an air of exultation,
“Pardon me, friend, there you happen to be
mistaken, these are none of <HI>impayable's,</HI> but done
by Nicholas Pouseen. I have seen prints of them
in England, so that none of your tricks upon tra∣vellers,
Mr. Swish or Swash, or what's your
name. He was very much elated by this imaginary
triumph of his understanding, which animated
him to persevere in his curious observations upon
all the other pieces of that celebrated collection;
but perceiving that the doctor manifested no signs
of pleasure and satisfaction, but rather beheld
<PB N="65" REF="74"/>
them with a silent air of disdain, he could not
digest his indifference, and asked with a waggish
sneer, if ever he had seen such a number of ma∣ster-pieces
before? The physician eying him with
a look of compassion mingled with contempt, ob∣served
that there was nothing there which de∣served
the attention of any person acquainted with
the ideas of the ancients; and that the author of
the finest piece now in being, was unworthy to
clean the brushes of one of those great masters,
who are celebrated by the Greek and Roman
writers. “O lud! O lud! (exclaimed the
painter, with a loud laugh) you have fairly
brought yourself into a dilemma at last, dear doc∣tor;
for it is well known that your ancient Greek
and Roman artists knew nothing at all of the
matter, in comparison with our modern masters;
for this good reason, because they had but three
or four colours, and knew not how to paint with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> besides, which of all your old fusty Grecians
would you put upon a footing with the divine
Raphael, the most excellent Michael Angelo, Bona

and above all others, the sublime Rubens, the”
—He would have proceeded with a long ca∣talogue
of names which he had got by heart for
the purpose, without retaining the least idea of
their several qualifications, had not he been in∣terrupted
by his friend, whose indignation being
kindled by the irreverence with which he men∣tioned
the Greeks; he called him blasphemer,
Goth, Baeotian, and in his turn, asked with great
vehemence, which of those puny moderns could
match with Panaenus of Athens, and his brother
Phidias, Polycletus of Sicyon, Polygnotus the
<PB N="66" REF="75"/>
Thrasian, Parrhasius of Ephesus, sirnamed <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
and Apelles the prince of painters? He
challenged him to shew any portrait of these days
that could vye with the Helen of Zeuxis the He∣raclean,
or any composition equal to the sacrifice
of Iphigenia, by Timanthes the Sicyonian; not
to mention the twelve gods of Asclepiadorus the
Athenian, for which Mnason, tyrant of Elatea,
gave him about three hundred pounds a piece, or
Homer's hell by Nicias, who refused sixty talents,
amounting to upwards of eleven thousand pounds,
and generously made a present of it to his own
country. He desired him to produce a collection
equal to that in the temple of Delphos, men∣tioned
in the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Euripedes; where Hercules
and his companion Iolaus are represented in the
act of killing the Lernaean hydra, with golden
sickles <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, where Bellerophon appears
upon his winged steed, vanquishing the fire-breath∣ing
chimera <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; and the war of the
giants is described. Here Jupiter stands wielding
the red hot thunderbolts. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, there
Pallas dreadful to the view <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, brandisheth
her spear against the huge Enceladus; and Bac∣chus
with slender ivy rods, defeats and slays the
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or mighty son of earth. The painter
was astonished and confounded at this rhapsody of
names and instances, which was uttered with
surprising eagerness and rapidity; suspecting at
first that the whole was the creation of his own
brain; but when Pickle, with a view of flatter∣ing
the doctor's self-conceit, espoused his side of
the question, and confirmed the truth of every
thing he advanced, Mr. Pallet changed his opi∣nion,
and in emphatic silence adored the immen∣sity
of his friend's understanding. In short, Pe∣regrine
<PB N="67" REF="76"/>
easily perceived that they were false en∣thusiasts,
without the smallest pretensions to taste
and sensibility; and pretended to be in raptures
with they knew not what; the one thinking it
was incumbent upon him to express transports on
seeing the works of those who had been most
eminent in his profession, whether they did or
did not really raise his admiration; and the other
as a scholar deeming it his duty to magnisy the an∣cients
above all competition, with an affected fer∣vour,
which the knowledge of their excellencies
never inspired. Indeed our young gentleman so
successfully accommodated himself to the dispo∣sition
of each, that long before their review
was finished, he was become a particular favourite
with both.</P>
<P>From the Palais Royal he accompanied them to
the clo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sters of the Carthusians, where they con∣sidered
the history of St. Bruno, by Le Sueur,
whose name being utterly unknown to the painter,
he gave judgment against the whole composition,
as pitiful and paultry; though in the opinion of
all good judges, it is a most masterly performance.</P>
<P>Having satisfied their curiosity in this place,
Peregrine sollicited them to favour him with their
company at dinner; but whether out of caution
against the insinuations of one whose character
they did not know, or by reason of a prior en∣gagement,
they declined his invitation on pretence
of having an appointment at a certain ordinary,
though they expressed a desire of being farther ac∣quainted
with him; and Mr. Pallet took the free∣dom
of asking his name, which he not only de∣clared,
but promised, as they were strangers in
Paris, to wait upon them next day in the fore∣noon,
in order to conduct them to the hotel de
<PB N="68" REF="77"/>
Tholouse, and the houses of several other noble∣men,
remarkable for painting or curious furni∣ture.
They thankfully embraced his proposal,
and that same day made inquiry among the English
gentlemen, about the character of our hero, which
they found so much to their satisfaction, that upon
their second meeting, they courted his good graces
without reserve; and as they had heard of his in∣tended
departure, begged earnestly to have the ho∣nour
of accompanying him through the Low Coun∣tries.
He assured them that nothing could be
more agreeable to him, than the prospect of hav∣ing
such fellow-travellers; and they immediately
appointed a day for setting out on that tour.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He introduces his new friends to Mr. Jolter, with
whom the doctor enters into a dispute upon go∣vernment,
which had well nigh terminated in
open war.</HEAD>
<P>MEAN while, he not only made them ac∣quainted
with every thing worth seeing in
town, but attended them in their excursions to
all the king's houses within a day's journey of
Paris; and in the course of these parties, treated
them with an elegant dinner at his own apart∣ments,
where a dispute arose between the doctor
and Mr. Jolter, which had well nigh terminated
in an irreconcileable animosity. These gentlemen,
with an equal share of pride, pedantry and satur∣nine
disposition, were by the accidents of educa∣tion
and company, diametrically opposite in poli∣tical
maxims; the one, as we have already ob∣served,
being a bigotted high churchman, and the
<PB N="69" REF="78"/>
other a rank republican. It was an article of the
governor's creed, that the people could not be
happy, nor the earth yield its fruits in abundance,
under a restricted clergy and limited government:
whereas, in the doctor's opinion, it was an eter∣nal
truth, that no constitution was so perfect as
the democracy, and that no country could flourish,
but under the administration of the mob.</P>
<P>These considerations being premised, no won∣der
that they happened to disagree in the freedom
of an unreserved conversation, especially as their
entertainer took all opportunities of encouraging
and inflaming the contention. The first source
of their difference was an unlucky remark of the
painter, who observed that the partridge of which
he was then eating, had the finest relish of any
he had ever tasted. His friend owned that the
birds were the best of the kind he had seen in
France; but affirmed that they were neither so
plump nor delicious as those that were caught in
England. The governor considering this obser∣vation
as the effect of prejudice and inexperience,
said with a sarcastical smile, “I believe, sir, you
are very well disposed to find every thing here in∣ferior
to the productions of your own country.”
“True, sir, (answered the physician with a cer∣tain
solemnity of aspect) and not without good
reason I hope.” “And pray, (resumed the
tutor) why may not the partridges of France be
as good as those of England?” “For a very
plain reason, replied the other, because they are
not so well fed. The iron hand of oppression is
extended to all animals within the French domi∣nions,
even to the beasts of the field and the fowls
of the air. <HI>Kunessin ownoisi te past.”</HI> “Egad!
cried the painter, that is a truth not to be con∣troverted:
<PB N="70" REF="79"/>
for my own part, I am none of your
tit-bits, one would think, but yet there's a fresh∣ness
in the English complexion, a <HI>ginseekeye,</HI> I
think you call it, so inviting to a hungry French∣man,
that I have caught several in the very act
of viewing me with an eye of extreme appetite,
as I passed; and as for their curs, or rather their
wolves, (for by jingo they are more liker the one
than t'other) whenever I set eyes on one of 'em,
Aha! your humble servant Mr. son of a bitch, I
am upon my guard in an instant. The doctor
can testify that their very horses, or more pro∣perly
their live carrion that drew our chaise, used
to reach back their long necks and smell at us,
as a couple of delicious morsels.” This sally of
Mr. Pallet, which was received with a general
laugh of approbation, would, in all probability,
have stifled the dispute in embrio, had not Mr.
Jolter with a self-applauding simper, ironically
complimented the strangers on their talking like
true Englishmen. The doctor affronted at the
insinuation, told him with some warmth, that he
was mistaken in his conjecture, his affections and
ideas being confined to no particular country; for
he considered himself as a citizen of the world.
He owned himself more attached to England than
to any other kingdom, but this preference was
the effect of reflexion, and not of prejudice; be∣cause
the British constitution approached nearer
than any other, to that perfection of government,
the democracy of Athens, which he hoped one
day to see revived: he mentioned the death of
Charles the first, and the expulsion of his son, with
raptures of applause, inveighed with great acri∣mony
against the kingly name; and in order to
fanction his opinion, repeated forty or fifty lines
<PB N="71" REF="80"/>
from one of the Philippicks of Demosthenes. Jol∣ter
hearing him speak so disrespectfully of the
higher powers, glowed with indignation. He
said his doctrines were detestable and destructive
of all right, order and society; that monarchy
was of divine institution, therefore indefeasible by
any human power; and of consequence those
events in the English history, which he had so
liberally commended, were no other than flagrant
instances of sacrilege, perfidy, and sedition;
that the democracy of Athens was a most absurd
constitution, productive of anarchy and mischief,
which must always happen when the government
of a nation depends upon the caprice of the ig∣norant
hair-brained vulgar: that it was in the
power of the most prosligate member of the com∣mon-wealth,
provided he was endowed with elo∣quence,
to ruin the most deserving, by a despe∣rate
exertion of his talents upon the populace,
who had been often persuaded to act in the most
ungrateful and imprudent manner, against the
greatest patriots that their country had produced:
and finally, he averred, that the liberal arts and
sciences had never flourished so much in a repub∣lick,
as under the encouragement and protection
of absolute power; witness the Augustan age, and
the reign of Lewis the fourteenth: nor was it to
be supposed that genius and merit could ever be so
amply recompensed by the individuals, or distracted
councils of a common-wealth, as by the genero∣sity
and magnificence of one, who had the whole
treasures at his own command.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was pleased to find the contest
grow warm, observed that there seemed to be a
good deal of truth in what Mr. Jolter advanced;
and the painter, whose opinion began to waver,
<PB N="72" REF="81"/>
looked with a face of expectation at his friend,
who modelling his features into an expression of
exulting disdain, asked of his antagonist, if he
did not think that very power of rewarding me∣rit,
enabled an absolute prince to indulge himself
in the most arbitrary licence over the lives and
fortunes of his people? Before the governor had
time to answer this question, Pallet broke forth
into an exclamation of “By the Lord! that is
certainly fact, egad! that was a home thrust, doc∣tor.”
When Mr. Jolter chastising this shallow
intruder with a contempt'ous look, affirmed that
though supreme power furnished a good prince
with the means of exerting his virtues, it would
not support a tyrant in the exercise of cruelty and
oppression; because in all nations, the genius of
the people must be consulted by their governors,
and the burthen proportioned to the shoulders on
which it is laid, “Else, what follows?” said the
physician, “The consequence is plain, replied
the governor, insurrection, revolt, and his own
destruction: for it is not to be supposed that the
subjects of any nation would be so abject and pu∣silanimous,
as to neglect the means which heaven
hath put in their power for their own preserva∣tion.”
“Gadzooks! you're in the right, sir,
cried Pallet, that I grant you must be confessed:
doctor, I'm afraid we have got into the wrong
box.” This son of Paean, however, far from
being of his friend's opinion, observed with an air
of triumph, that he would not only demonstrate
the sophistry of the gentleman's last allegation,
by argument and facts, but even confute him with
his own words. Jolter's eyes kindling at this
presumptuous declaration, he told his antagonist,
while his lip quivered with resentment, that if his
<PB N="73" REF="82"/>
arguments were no better than his breeding, he
was sure he would make very few converts to
his opinion; and the doctor, with all the insolence
of triumph, advised him to beware of disputes for
the future, until he should have made himself
more master of his subject.</P>
<P>Peregrine both wished and hoped to see the dis∣putants
proceed to arguments of more weight and
conviction; and the painter dreading the same
issue, interposed with the usual exclamation of
“For God's sake, gentlemen!” when the gover∣nor
rose from table in great dudgeon, and left the
room, muttering some ejaculation, of which the
word coxcomb only could be distinctly heard.
The physician being thus left master of the field
of battle, was complimented on his victory by
Peregrine, and so elevated by his success, that
he declaimed a full hour on the absurdity of Jol∣ter's
proposition, and the beauty of the demo∣cratic
administration; canvassed the whole scheme
of Plato's republic, with many quotations from
that ideal author; touching the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: from
thence he made a transition to the moral sense of
Shastsbury, and concluded his harangue with the
greatest part of that frothy writer's rhapsody,
which he repeated with all the violence of enthu∣siastic
agitation; to the unspeakable satisfaction of
his entertainer, and the unutterable admiration
of Pallet, who looked upon him as something
supernatural and divine. So intoxicated was this
vain young man with the ironical praises of
Pickle, that he forthwith shook off all reserve, and
having professed a friendship for our hero, whose
taste and learning he did not fail to extol, inti∣nated
in plain terms, that he was the only person
<PB N="74" REF="83"/>
in these latter ages, who professed that sublime
genius, that portion of the divinity or <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
which immortalized the Grecian poets; that as
Pythagoras affirmed the spirit of Euphorbus had
transmigrated into his body, he, the doctor, was
strangely possessed with the opinion that he him∣self
was inspired by the soul of Pindar; because,
making allowance for the difference of languages,
in which they wrote, there was a surprising affi∣nity
between his own works and those of that cele∣brated
Theban; and as a confirmation of this truth,
he immediately produced a sample of each, which
though in spirit and versification, as different as
the Odes of Horace and our present laureat, Pe∣regrine
did not scruple to pronounce altogether
congenial; notwithstanding the violence he by
this sentence offered to his own conscience, and a
certain alarm of his pride, that was weak enough
to be disturbed by the physician's ridiculous va∣nity
and presumption, which not contented with
displaying his importance in the world of taste and
polite literature, manifested itself in arrogating
certain material discoveries in the province of phy∣sick,
which could not fail to advance him to the
highest pinnacle of that profession, considering
the recommendation of his other talents, together
with a liberal fortune which he inherited from his
father.</P>

<P>IN a word, our young gentleman, by his in∣sinuating
behaviour, obtained the full confi∣dence
of the doctor, who invited him to an en∣tertainment,
which he intended to prepare in the
manner of the ancients. Pickle, struck with

task being left to his care and discretion, he ac∣tually
bespoke the company of a French marquis,
an Italian count and a German baron, whom he
knew to be egregious coxcombs, and therefore
more likely to enhance the joy of the entertain∣ment.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the hour being arrived, he con∣ducted
them to the hotel where the physician
lodged, after having regaled their expectations with
an elegant meal in the genuine old Roman taste;
and they were received by Mr. Pallet, who did
the honours of the house, while his friend super∣intended
<PB N="76" REF="85"/>
the rotisseur below. By this communi∣cative
painter, the guests understood that the doctor
had met with numerous difficulties in the execution
of his design; that no fewer than five cooks had been
dismissed, because they could not prevail upon
their own consciences to obey his directions in
things that were contrary to the present practice
of their art; and that although he had at last en∣gaged
a person, by an extraordinary premium,
to comply with his orders, the fellow was so
astonished, mortified and incensed at the com∣mands
he had received, that his hair stood on
end, and he begged on his knees, to be released
from the agreement he had made: but finding
that his employer insisted upon the performance
of his contract, and threatened to introduce him
to the commissaire, if he should flinch from the
bargain, he had, in the discharge of his office,
wept, sung, cursed and capered for two whole
hours without intermission; so that his brain
seemed to have received a rude shock, and, in
all probability, he would never be his own man
again.</P>
<P>While the company listened to this odd infor∣mation,
by which they were prepossessed with
strange notions of the dinner, their ears were
invaded by a piteous voice that exclaimed in
French, “For the love of God! dear Sir! for
the passion of Jesus Christ! spare me the morti∣fication
of the honey and oil!” But this pa∣thetic
supplication having no effect upon the
physician, who in all likelihood poured in, with
his own hand, the sauce against which the coo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had objected, the same voice was heard to utter
a sort of yell, which was followed by a string <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
execrations in the French language, that gra∣dually
<PB N="77" REF="86"/>
died away, as if the swearer had been for∣cibly
conveyed into a more distant apartment.
Their ears still vibrated with the sound, when
the doctor entering, was by Peregrine made ac∣quainted
with the strangers, to whom he, in the
transports of his wrath, could not help of com∣plaining
of the want of complaisance he had found
in the Parisian vulgar, by which his plan had,
been almost entirely ruined and set aside. The
French marquis, who thought the honour of his
nation was concerned at this declaration, pro∣fessed
his sorrow for what had happened, so con∣trary
to the established character of the people,
and undertook to see the delinquents severely pu∣nished,
provided he could be informed of their
names or places of abode. The mutual compli∣ments
that passed on this occasion were scarce
finished, when a servant coming into the room,
announced dinner; and the entertainer led the
way into another apartment, where they found
a long table, or rather two boards joined toge∣ther,
and furnished with a variety or dishes, the
steams of which had such evident effect upon the
nerves of the company, that the marquis made
frightful grimaces, under pretence of taking snuff;
the Italian's eyes watered, the German's visage
underwent violent distortion of features; our hero
found means to exclude the odour from his sense
of smelling, by breathing only through his mouth;
and the poor painter running into another room,
plugged his nostrils with tobacco. The doctor
himself, who was the only person then present
whose organs were not discomposed, pointing to
a couple of couches placed on each side of the
table, told his guests, that he was sorry he could
not procure the exact <HI>triclinia</HI> of the ancients;
<PB N="78" REF="87"/>
which were somewhat different from these con∣veniencies,
and desired they would have the good∣ness
to repose themselves without ceremony, each
in his respective couchette, while he and his
friend Mr. Pallet would place themselves upright
at the ends, that they might have the pleasure of
serving those that lay along. This disposition,
of which the strangers had no previous idea, dis∣concerted
and perplexed them in a most ridicu∣lous
manner; the marquis and baron stood bow∣ing
to each other, on pretence of disputing the
lower seat, but in reality with a view of profiting
by the example of one another, for neither of
them understood the manner in which they were
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oll; and Peregrine, who enjoyed their confu∣sion,
handed the count to the other side, where,
with the most mischievous politeness, he insisted
upon his taking possession of the upper place.</P>
<P>In this disagreeable and ludicrous suspence they
continued acting a pantomime of gesticulations,
until the doctor earnestly intreated them to wave
all compl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment and form, left the dinner should
be spoiled before the ceremonial could be ad∣justed.
Thus conjured, Peregrine took the lower
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uch on the left-hand side, laying himself gently
down, with his face towards the table. The
marquis, in imitation of this pattern (though he
would have much rather fasted three days than
run the risk of discomposing his dress by such an
attitude) stretched himself upon the opposite place,
reclining upon his elbow in a most painful and
aukward situation, with his head raised above the
end of the couch, that the oeconomy of his hair
might not suffer by the projection of his body.
The Italian being a thin, limber creature, planted
himself next to Pickle, without sustaining any
<PB N="79" REF="88"/>
misfortune, but that of his stocking being tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
by a ragged nail of the seat, as he raised his legs
on a level with the rest of his limbs. But the
baron, who was neither so wieldy nor supple in
his joints as his companions, flounced himself
down with such precipitation, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is feet sud∣denly
tilting up, came in furious contact with
the head of the marquis, and demolished every
curl in a twinkling, while his own skull, at the
same instant, descended upon the side of his couch
with such violence, that his periwig was struck
off, and the whole room filled with pulvilio.</P>
<P>The drollery of distress that attended this dis∣aster
entirely vanquished the affected gravity of
our young gentleman, who was obliged to sup∣press
his laughter by cramming his handkerchief
in his mouth; for the bare-headed German asked
pardon with such ridiculous confusion, and the
marquis admitted his apology with such rueful
complaisance, as were sufficient to awake the
mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of a quietist, whose insensibility was not
utterly extinguished.</P>
<P>This misfortune being repaired as well as the
circumstances of the occasion would permit, and
every one settled according to the arrangement
already described, the doctor graciously under∣took
to give some account of the dishes as they
occurred, that the company might be directed in
their choice; and with an air of infinite satis∣faction
thus began: “This here, gentlemen, is
a boiled goose, served up in a sauce composed of
pepper, lovage, coriander, mint, rue, anchovies
and oil; I wish for your sakes, gentlemen, it
was one of the geese of Ferrara, so much cele∣brated
among the ancients for the magnitude of
their livers, one of which is said to have weighed
<PB N="80" REF="89"/>
upwards of two pounds: with this food, exquisite
as it was, did the tyrant Heliogabalus regale his
hounds. But I beg pardon, I had almost forgot
the soup, which I hear is so necessary an article
at all tables in France. At each end there
are dishes of the salacacabia of the Romans, one
is made of parsley, pennyroyal, cheese, pine∣tops,
honey, vinegar, brine, eggs, cucumbers,
onions and hen-livers; the other is much the
same as the soup-maigre of this country. Then
there is a loin of veal boiled with fennel and ca∣raway-feed,
on a pottage composed of pickle,
oil, honey and flour, and a curious hachis of the
lights, liver and blood of an hare, together with
a dish of roasted pigeons. Monsieur le baron,
shall I help you to a plate of this soup?” The
German, who did not at all disapprove of the in∣gredients,
assented to the proposal, and seemed
to relish the composition; while the marquis, be∣ing
asked by the painter which of the silly-kickabys
he chose, was in consequence of his de∣sire
accommodated with a portion of the soup
maigre; and the count, in lieu of spoon-meat, of
which he said he was no great admirer, supplied
himself with a pigeon, therein conforming to
the choice of our young gentleman, whose ex∣ample
he determined to follow through the whole
course of the entertainment.</P>
<P>The Frenchman having swallowed the first
spoonful, made a full pause, his throat swelled,
as if an egg had stuck in his gullet, his eyes
rolled, and his mouth underwent a series of in∣voluntary
contractions and dilatations. Pallet,
who looked stedfastly at this connoisseur, with a
view of consulting his taste, before he himself
would venture upon the soup, began to be di∣sturbed
<PB N="81" REF="90"/>
at these emotions, and observed with
some concern, that the poor gentleman seemed to
be going into a fit; when Peregrine assured him
that these were symptoms of extasy, and for fur∣ther
confirmation, asked the marquis how he
found the soup. It was with infinite difficulty
that his complaisance could so far master his dis∣gust,
as to enable him to answer, “Altogether
excellent, upon my honour!” And the painter
being certified of his approbation, lifted the spoon
to his mouth without scruple; but, far from
justifying the elogium of his taster, when this
precious composition diffused itself upon his pa∣late,
he seemed to be deprived of all sense and
motion, and sat like the leaden statue of some
river god, with the liquor flowing out at both
sides of his mouth.</P>
<P>The doctor, alarmed at this indecent phoeno∣menon,
earnestly inquired into the cause of it;
and when Pallet recovered his recollection, and
swere that he would rather swallow porridge made
of burning brimstone, than such an infernal m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss
as that which he had tasted, the physician, in his
own vindication, assured the company, that, ex∣cept
the usual ingredients, he had mixed nothing
in the soup but some sal armoniac instead of the
ancient nitrum, which could not now be pro∣cured;
and appealed to the marquis, whether
such a succedaneum was not an improvement on
the whole. The unfortunate petit maitre, dri∣ven
to the extremity of his condescension, ac∣knowledged
it to be a mast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly refinement; and
deeming himself obliged, in point of honour, to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ince his sentiments by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> practice, forced a
few more mouthfuls of this disagreeable potion
down his throat, till his stomach was so much
<PB N="82" REF="91"/>
offended, that he was compelled to start up of a
sudden, and in the hurry of his elevation over∣turned
his plate into the bosom of the baron.
The emergency of his occasions would not per∣mit
him to stay and make apologies for this abrupt
behaviour, so that he flew into another apart∣ment,
where Pickle found him puking, and
crossing himself with great devotion; and a chair,
at his desire, being brought to the door, he slipt
into it more dead than alive, conjuring his friend
Pickle to make his peace with the company, and
in particular excuse him to the baron, on account
of the violent fit of illness with which he had
been seized. It was not without reason that he
employed a mediator; for when our hero re∣turned
to the dining-room, the German got up,
and was under the hands of his own lacquey,
who wiped the grease from a rich embroidered
waistcoat, while he, almost frantic with his mis∣fortune,
stamped upon the ground, and in High
Dutch cursed the unlucky banquet, and the im∣pertinent
entertainer, who all this time, with
great deliberation, consoled him for the disaster,
by assuring him, that the damage might be re∣paired
with some oil of turpentine and an hot
iron. Peregrine, who could scarce refrain from
laughing in his face, appeased his indignation,
by telling him how much the whole company,
and especially the marquis, was mortified at the
accident; and the unhappy salacacabia being re∣moved,
the places were filled with two pies,
one of dormice liquored with syrup of white po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pies,
which the doctor had substituted in the room
of toasted poppy-seed, formerly eaten with ho∣ney,
as a desert; and the other composed of an
hock of pork baked in honey.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="92"/>
Pallet hearing the first of these dishes described,
lifted up his hands and eyes, and with signs of
loathing and amazement pronounced, “A pye
made of dormice and syrup of poppies; Christ
in heaven! what beastly fellows these Romans
were!” His friend checked him for his irre∣verent
exclamation with a severe look, and re∣commended
the veal, of which he himself chear∣fully
ate, with such encomiums to the company,
that the baron resolved to imitate his example,
after having called for a bumper of Burgundy,
which the physician, for his sake, wished to have
been the true wine of Falernum. The painter
seeing nothing else upon the table which he would
venture to touch, made a merit of necessity, and
had recourse to the veal also; although he could
not help saying, that he would not give one slice of
the roast beef of old England for all the dainties of
a Roman emperor's table. But all the doctor's in∣vitations
and assurances could not prevail upon his
guests to honour the hachis and the goose; and
that course was succeeded by another, in which
he told them were divers of those dishes, which
among the antients had obtained the appellation
of <HI>politeles,</HI> or magnificent. “That which smoaks
in the middle (said he) is a sow's stomach, filled
with a composition of minced pork, hog's brains,
eggs, pepper, cloves, garlick, annifeed, rue, gin∣ger,
oil, wine and pickle. On the right hand
side are the teats and belly of a sow, just far∣rowed,
fried with sweet wine, oil, flour, lovage
and pepper. On the left is a fricassee of snails,
sed, or rather purged with milk. At that end
n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt Mr. Pallet are fritters of pompions, lovage,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iganum and oil; and here are a couple of pul∣lets,
<PB N="84" REF="93"/>
roasted and stuffed in the manner of Api∣cius.</P>
<P>The painter, who had by wry faces, te∣stify'd
his abhorrence of the sow's stomach,
which he compared to a bagpipe, and the snails
which had undergone purgation, no sooner heard
him mention the roasted pullets, than he eagerly
sollicited a wing of the sowl; upon which the
doctor desired he would take the trouble of cut∣ting
them up, and accordingly sent them round,
while Mr. Pallet tucked the table-cloth under
his chin, and brandished his knife and fork with
singular address: but scarce were they set down
before him, when the tears ran down his cheeks,
and he called aloud, in manifest disorder, “Z—ds!
this is the essence of a whole bed of garlic!”
That he might not, however, disappoint or dis∣grace
the entertainer, he applied his instruments
to one of the birds, and when he opened up the
cavity, was assaulted by such an irruption of in∣tolerable
smells, that without staying to disen∣gage
himself from the cloth, he sprung away,
with an exclamation of, “Lord Jesus!” and
involved the whole table in havock, ruin and
confusion.</P>
<P>Before Pickle could accomplish his escape, he
was sauced with the syrup of the dormouse pye,
which went to pieces in the general wreck; and
as f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Italian count, he was overwhelmed by
the sow's stomach, which bursting in the fail,
discharged its contents upon his leg and thigh,
and scalded him so miserably, that he shricked
with anguish, and grinned with a most ghastly
and horrible aspect.</P>
<P>The baron, who sat secure without the vortex
of this tumult, was not at all displeased at seeing
<PB N="85" REF="94"/>
his companions involved in such a calamity as
that which he had already shared; but the doctor
was confounded with shame and vexation. After
having prescribed an application of oil to the
count's leg, he expressed his sorrow for the mis∣adventure,
which he openly ascribed to want
of taste and prudence in the painter, who did not
think proper to return, and make an apology in
person; and protested, that there was nothing in
the fowls which could give offence to a sensible
nose, the stuffing being a mixture of pepper,
lovage and assa foetida, and the sauce consisting
of wine and herring-pickle, which he had used
instead of the celebrated garum of the Romans;
that famous pickle having been prepared some∣times
of the scombri, which were a sort of tunny
fish, and sometimes of the silurus, or shad-fish:
nay, he observed that there was a third kind,
called garum haemation, made of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, gills
and blood of the thynnus.</P>
<P>The physician, finding it would be impracti∣cable
to re-establish the order of the banquet, by
presenting again the dishes which had been dis∣composed,
ordered every thing to be removed, a
clean cloth to be laid, and the desert to be
brought in.</P>
<P>Mean while, he regretted his incapacity to
give them a specimen of the alieus, or fish meals
of the ancients, such as the jus diabaton, the
conger-eel, which in Galen's opinion is hard of
dig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion, the cornuta, or gurnard, described by
Pliny in his Natural History, who says, the horns
of many of them were a foot and a half in
length; the mullet and lamprey, that were in
the highest estimation of old, of which last Julius
Caesar borrowed six thousand for one triumphal
<PB N="86" REF="95"/>
supper. He observed, that the manner of dres∣sing
them was described by Horace, in the ac∣count
he gives of the entertainment to which
Maecenas was invited by the epicure Nasiede∣nus:
<Q>Affertur squillas inter Murena natantes, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And told them, that they were commonly eaten
with the rhus syriacum, a certain anodyne and
astringent seed, which qualified the purgative na∣ture
of the fish. Finally, this learned physician
gave them to understand, that though this was
reckoned a luxurious dish in the zenith of the
Roman taste, it was by no means comparable, in
point of expence, to some preparations in vogue
about the time of that absurd voluptuary Helio∣gabalus,
who ordered the brains of six hundred
ostriches to be compounded in one mess.</P>
<P>By this time the desert appeared, and the com∣pany
were not a little rejoiced to see plain olives
in salt and water: but what the master of the
feast valued himself upon, was a sort of jelly,
which he affirmed to be preferable to the hypo∣trimma
of Hesychius, being a mixture of vine∣gar,
pickle and honey, boiled to a proper con∣sistence,
and candied assa foetida, which he as∣serted,
in contradiction to Humelbergius and
Lister, was no other than the laser syriacum, so
precious, as to be sold among the ancients to the
weight of a silver penny. The gentlemen took
his word for the excellency of this gum, but con∣tented
themselves with the olives, which gave
such an agreeable relish to the wine, that they
seemed very well disposed to console themselves
for the disgraces they had endured; and Pickle,
<PB N="87" REF="96"/>
unwilling to lose the least circumstance of enter∣tainment
that could be enjoyed in their company,
went in quest of the painter, who remained in
his penitentials in another apartment, and could
not be persuaded to re-enter the banqueting∣room,
until Peregrine undertook to procure his
pardon from those whom he had injured. Having
assured him of this indulgence, our young gen∣tleman
led him in like a criminal, bowing on
all hands with an air of humility and contrition;
and particularly addressing himself to the count,
to whom he swore in English, as God was his
saviour, he had no intent to affront man, wo∣man,
or child; but was fain to make the best
of his way, that he might not give the honour∣able
company cause of offence, by obeying the
dictates of nature in their presence.</P>
<P>When Pickle interpreted this apology to the
Italian, Pallet was forgiven in very polite terms,
and even received into favour by his friend the
doctor, in consequence of our hero's intercession:
so that all the guests forgot their chagrin, and
paid their respects so piously to the bottle, that
in a short time the Champaigne produced very
evident effects in the behaviour of all present.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XLIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Italian marquis and German baron are dis∣graced;
the painter is persuaded to accompany
Pickle to a masquerade in woman's apparel; is
engaged in a troublesome adventure, and with
his companion conveyed to the Bastile.</HEAD>
<P>THE painter, at the request of Pickle, who
had a design upon the count's sense of
hearing, favoured the company with the song of
<HI>Bumper Squire Jones,</HI> which yielded infinite satis∣faction
to the baron; but affected the delicate
ears of the Italian in such a manner, that his
features expressed astonishment and disquiet; and
by his sudden and repeated journeys to the door,
it plainly appeared, that he was in the same pre∣dicament
with those who, as Shakespear observes,
when the bagpipe sings in the nose, cannot con∣tain
their urine for affection.</P>
<P>With a view, therefore, of vindicating music
from such a barbarous taste, Mr. Pallet had no
sooner performed his task, than the count ho∣noured
his friends with some favourite airs of his
own country, which he warbled with infinite
grace and expression, though they h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not energy
sufficient to engage the attention of the German,
who fell fast asleep upon his couch, and snored so
loud, as to interrupt, and totally annul this ra∣vishing
entertainment; so that they were fain to
have recourse again to the gl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, which made
such innovation upon the brain of the physician,
that he sung divers odes of Anacreon to a tune
of his own composing, and held forth upon the
music and recitative of the ancients with great
<PB N="89" REF="98"/>
erudition; while Pallet, having found means to
make the Italian acquainted with the nature of
his profession, harangued upon painting with
wonderful volubility, in a language which (it was
well for his own credit) the stranger did not un∣derstand.</P>
<P>At length the doctor was seized with such a
qualm, that he begged Peregrine to lead him to
his chamber; and the count, tired with the
e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ernal babble of the painter, reeled towards the
sleeping baron, whom he viewed with rapture,
repeating from the <HI>Il Pastor Fido</HI> of Guarini,</P>
<Q><L>Come ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tato infermo</L>
<L>Che bramò lungamenté</L>
<L>Il vietato licor—</L>
<L>—Tal' Io! gran tempo infermo,</L>
<L>E d'amorosa sete arso, e consunto.</L></Q>
<P>Then boldly ravished a kiss, and began to tickle
him under the ribs, with such expressions of ten∣derness,
as scandalized the virtuous painter, who,
conscious of his own attractions, was alarmed
for his person, and staggered in great hurry and
discomposure into the next room, where he put
himself under the protection of our hero, to
whom he imparted his suspicion of the count's
morals, by describing the indecency of his de∣portment.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who entertained a just detestation
for all such abominable practices, was incensed at
this information; and stepping to the door of the
dining room where the two strangers were left
together, saw with his own eyes enough to con∣vince
him, that Pallet's complaint was not with∣out
foundation, and that the baron was not averse
<PB N="90" REF="99"/>
to the addresses of the count. Our young gen∣tleman's
indignation had well nigh prompted him
to rush in, and take immediate vengeance on the
offenders; but, considering that such a precipi∣tate
step might be attended with troublesome
consequences to himself, he resisted the impulse
of his wrath, and tasked his invention with some
method of inflicting upon them a disgrace suited
to the grossness of their ideas. After having re∣volved
sundry schemes of punishment, and even
consulted Mr. Pipes, who being present at the
discovery, undertook to few them up in bags,
with a reasonable quantity of ballast in each, and
throw them over the Pont Neuf into the river;
his imagination could not supply him with an ex∣pedient
to his liking, and he was at a loss how
to behave, when the landlady of the house, whom
he knew to be a dame of remarkable vivacity,
chancing to pass, furnished him with a hint, of
which he immediately took the advantage, by
begging she would do him the favour to step into
the next room, and tell the gentlemen, that he
would be with them as soon as the doctor could
be put to bed.</P>
<P>The lady very graciously undertook the office,
and entering the apartment, was so much of∣fended
and enraged at the mutual endearments of
the two lovers, that instead of delivering the
message with which she had been entrusted, she
set the trumpet of reproach to her mouth, and
seizing the baron's cane, which she found upon
the side table, belaboured them both with such
eagerness of animosity, that they found them∣selves
obliged to make a very disorderly retreat,
and were actually driven down stairs, in a most
disgraceful condition, by this exasperated virago,
<PB N="91" REF="100"/>
who loaded them with just invectives all the way,
publishing their shame, not only to those of her
own family, but likewise to the populace, who
began to crowd about the door, and in all pro∣bability
would have espoused her revenge, had not
their lacqueys, who were in waiting, conveyed
the delinquents into the Remise, and carried them
off with great expedition.</P>
<P>Peregrine was so delighted with the manner of
the chastisement they had undergone, that he
embraced the mistress of the hotel with transport,
for the spirit she had exerted; and being rendered
frolicksome with the wine he had drank, pro∣posed
that he and Pallet should go to a masquerade,
which he recollected was to be given that night.
The painter did not want curiosity and inclina∣tion
to accompany him, but expressed his appre∣hension
of losing him in the ball; an accident
which could not fail to be very disagreeable, as
he was an utter stranger to the language and the
town. To obviate this objection, the landlady,
who was of their council, advised him to appear
in a woman's dress, which would lay his com∣panion
under the necessity of attending him with
more care, as he could not with decency detach
himself from the lady whom he should intro∣duce:
besides, such a supposed connexion would
hinder the ladies of pleasure from accosting, and
employing their seducing arts upon a person al∣ready
engaged.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman, foreseeing abundance
of diversion in the execution of this project, se∣conded
the proposal with such importunity and
address, that the painter allowed himself to be
habited in a suit belonging to the landlady, who
also procured for him a mask and domino, while
<PB N="92" REF="101"/>
Pickle provided himself with a Spanish dress. In
this disguise, which they put on about eleven
o'clock, did they, attended by Pipes, set out in
a Fiacre for the ball-room, into which Pickle led
this supposititious female, to the astonishment of
the whole company, who had never seen such an
uncouth figure in the appearance of a woman.</P>
<P>After they had taken a view of all the re∣markable
masques, and the painter had been
treated with a glass of liqueur, his mischievous
companion gave him the slip, and vanishing in
an instant, returned with another mask and a do∣mino
over his habit, that he might enjoy Pallet's
perplexity, and be at hand to protect him from
insult.</P>
<P>The poor painter having lost his guide, was
almost distracted with anxiety, and stalked about
the room, in quest of him, with such huge strides
and oddity of gesture, that he was followed by
a whole multitude, who gazed at him as a pre∣ternatural
phaenomenon. This attendance in∣creased
his uneasinefs to such a degree, that he
could not help uttering a soliloquy aloud, in
which he cursed his fate for having depended up∣on
the promise of such a wag; and swore, that
if once he was clear or this scrape, he would
not bring himself into such a premunire again
for the whole kingdom of France.</P>
<P>Divers petit maitres understanding the masque
was a foreigner, who in all probability could not
speak French, made up to him in their turns, in
order to display their wit and address, and teized
him with several arch questions; to which he
made no other answer than, “No <HI>parly Francy.</HI>
Damn your chattering! Go about your business,
can't ye?” But, what most of all contributed
<PB N="93" REF="102"/>
to his torture and mortification, was a pressing
call from nature, in consequence of the Cham∣paign
he had so liberally swallowed in the after∣noon.
In the character of a woman, he neither
knew whither to retire, nor, had he known,
durst he run the risk of being discovered, in such a
situation, by the individuals of that sex; and if
he should use the privilege of a man, in his pre∣sent
appearance, he foresaw that he must subject
himself to the ridicule of the whole company;
so that he was obliged to suffer the most racking
pangs of retention, and coursed round and round
the whole place, casting many a woeful look
among the crowd in search of Pickle, against
whom he uttered innumerable execrations. At
length, however, he was compelled to yield to
the urgent dictates of necessity, and following se∣veral
gentlemen into a small adjoining room fur∣nished
for the occasion, discharged the source of
his vexation in presence of them all, crying in
his own excuse, “By your leave, by your leave.
Egad! necessity has no law.” The circum∣stances
of this operation were so extraordinary
and ridiculous, that some of those who were wit∣nesses
of it, held up their hands in token of
amazement; while others ran into the ball∣room,
and called their companions to see such
an unheard-of spectacle.</P>
<P>Among the masques that, upon this intima∣tion,
came to see the painter's attitude, was a
person of great quality, who being a little ac∣quainted
with the English language, waited till
Pallet turned about; and going up to him,
“Madam, (said he) I give you joy of your
happy pisse. It me seem, dat your vatere com
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idout grand pain.” “Yes, thank God, Mon∣sieur,
<PB N="94" REF="103"/>
(replied the painter) I never was troubled
with the stone.” “Oho! (resumed the masque)
so much de bettre. You love to ave de stone
vidout trouble, if I not mistake.” “Gad∣zooks!
my dear, you have nicked it to an hair!
That is the very case, as I hope to be saved,”
cried Pallet, bursting into a violent fit of laugh∣ter;
which divesting the Frenchman of all cere∣mony
and reserve, he began to be very free with
the supposed lady, and attempted to plunge his
hand into her bosom: but the painter was too
modest to suffer such indecent treatment; and
when the gallant repeated his efforts in a manner
still more indelicate, lent him such a box on the
ear, as made the lights dance before him, and
created such a suspicion of Pallet's sex, that the
nobleman swore he was either a male or her∣maphrodite,
and insisted upon a scrutiny, for the
sake of his own honour, with such obstinacy of
resentment, that the fictitious nymph was in im∣minent
danger, not only of being exposed, but
also of undergoing severe chastisement, for having
made so free with the prince's ear; when Pere∣grine,
who saw and over-heard every thing that
passed, thought it was high time to interpose;
and accordingly, asserted his pretensions to the
insulted lady, who was overjoyed at this proof
of his protection.</P>
<P>The affronted gallant persevered in demanding
to know who she was, and our hero as strenuously
refused to give him that satisfaction: so that high
words ensued; and the prince threatening to pu∣nish
his insolence, the young gentleman, who
was not supposed to know his quality, pointed
to the place where his own sword used to hang,
and snapping his fingers in his face, laid hold on
<PB N="95" REF="104"/>
the painter's arm, and led him to another part of
the room, leaving his antagonist to the medita∣tions
of his own revenge.</P>
<P>Pallet having chid his conductor for his bar∣barous
desertion, made him acquainted with the
difficulty in which he had been involved, and
flatly telling him, he would not put it in his
power to give him the slip again, held fast by his
arm during the remaining part of the entertain∣ment,
to the no small diversion of the company,
whose attention was altogether engrossed in the
contemplation of such an aukward, ungainly
stalking apparition. At last, Pickle being tired
of exhibiting this rareeshew, complied with the
repeated desires of his companion, and handed
her into the coach; which he himself had no
sooner entered, than they were surrounded by a
file of musqueteers, commanded by an exempt,
who ordering the coach-door to be opened, took
his place with great deliberation, while one of his
detachment mounted the box, in order to direct
the driver.</P>
<P>Peregrine at once conceived the meaning of
this arrest, and it was well for him that he had no
weapon wherewith to stand upon his defence;
for such was the impetuosity and rashness of his
temper, that had he been armed, he would have
run all risks rather than surrender himself to any
odds whatever; but Pallet imagining that the of∣ficer
was some gentleman who had mistaken their
carriage for his own, desired his friend to unde∣ceive
the stranger; and when he was informed of
the real state of their condition, his knees began
to shake, his teeth to chatter, and he uttered a
most doleful lamentation, importing his fear of
being carried to some hideous dungeon of the Ba∣stile,
<PB N="96" REF="105"/>
where he should spend the rest of his days
in misery and horror, and never see the light of
God's sun, nor the face of a friend; but perish
in a foreign land, far removed from his family and
connexions. Pickle damned him for his pusila∣nimity,
and the Exempt hearing a lady bemoan
herself so piteously, expressed his mortification at
being the instrument of giving her such pain, and
endeavoured to console them, by representing the
lenity of the French government, and the singular
generosity of the prince, by whose order they
were apprehended.</P>
<P>Peregrine, whose discretion seemed to forsake
him on all such occasions, exclaimed with great
bitterness against the arbitrary administration of
France, and inveighed with many expressions of
contempt, against the character of the offended
prince, whose resentment, far from being noble,
he said, was pitiful, ungenerous and unjust. To
this remonstrance the officer made no reply, but
shrugged up his shoulders in silent astonishment at
the <HI>hardiesse</HI> of the prisoner, and the Fiacre was
just on the point of setting out, when they heard
the noise of a scuffle at the back of the coach,
and the voice of Tom Pipes, pronouncing “I'll
be damn'd if I do.” This trusty attendant had
been desired by one of the guard to descend from
his station in the rear, but as he resolved to share
his master's fate, he took no notice of their in∣treaties,
until they were seconded by force; and
that he endeavoured to repel with his heel, which
he applied with such energy to the jaws of the
soldier who first came in contact with him, that
they emitted a crashing sound like a dried walnut
between the grinders of a templar in the pit. Ex∣asperated
at this outrage, the other saluted Tom's
<PB N="97" REF="106"/>
posteriors with his bayonet, which incommoded
him so much, that he could no longer keep his
post, but leaping upon the ground, gave his an∣tagonist
a chuck under the chin, that laid him
upon his back, and then skipping over him with
infinite agility, absconded among the crowd of
coaches, till he saw the guard mount before and
behind upon his master's Fiacre, which no sooner
set forward than he followed at a small distance,
to reconnoitre the place where Peregrine should
be confined.</P>
<P>After having proceeded slowly through many
windings and turnings to a part of Paris, in which
Pipes was an utter stranger, the coach stopped at
a great gate, with a wicket in the middle, which
being opened at the approach of the carriage, the
prisoners were admitted, and the guard returning
with the Fiacre, Tom determined to watch in
that place all night, that in the morning he might
make such observations, as might be conducive to
the enlargement of his master.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">By the fidelity of Pipes, Jolter is informed of his
pupil's fate. Confers with the physician. Applies
to the Embassador, who with great difficulty ob∣tains
the discharge of the prisoners, on certain con∣ditions.</HEAD>
<P>THIS plan he executed notwithstanding the
pain of his wound, and the questions of
the city guard both horse and foot, to which he
could make no other answer than <HI>“Anglois, An∣glois;”</HI>
and as soon as it was light, taking an ac∣curate
survey of the castle (for such it seemed to
<PB N="98" REF="107"/>
be) into which Peregrine and Pallet had been con∣veyed,
together with its situation in respect to the
river, he went home to the lodgings, and waking
Mr. Jolter, gave him an account of the adven∣ture.
The governor wrung his hands in the ut∣most
grief and consternation, when he heard this
unfortunate piece of news; he did not doubt that
his pupil was imprisoned in the Bastile for life;
and in the anguish of his apprehension, cursed the
day on which he had undertaken to superintend
the conduct of such an imprudent young man,
who had by reiterated insults provoked the ven∣geance
of such a mild forbearing administration.
That he might not, however, neglect any means
in his power to extricate him from his present mis∣fortune,
he dispatched Thomas to the doctor,
with an account of his companion's fate, that
they might join their interest in behalf of the
captives; and the physician being informed of
what had happened, immediately dressed himself
and repaired to Jolter, whom he accosted in these
words: “Now, sir, I hope you are convinced
of your error, in asserting that oppression can ne∣ver
be the effect of arbitrary power. Such a ca∣lamity
as this could never have happened under
the Athenian democracy: nay, even when the
tyrant Pisistratus got possession of that common∣wealth,
he durst not venture to rule with such
absolute and unjust dominion. You shall see now
that Mr. Pickle and my friend Pallet will fall a
sacrifice to the tyrancy of lawless power; and in
my opinion, we shall be accessory to the ruin of
this poor enslaved people, if we bestir ourselves
in demanding, or imploring the release of our un∣happy
countrymen; as we may thereby prevent
the commission of a flagrant crime, which would
<PB N="99" REF="108"/>
fill up the vengeance of heaven against the perpe∣trators,
and perhaps be the means of restoring a
whole nation to the unspeakable fruition of free∣dom.
For my own part, I should rejoice to see
the blood of my father spilt in such a glorious
cause, provided such a victim would furnish me
with the opportunity of dissolving the chains of
slavery, and vindicating that liberty which is the
birth-right of man. Then would my name be
immortalized among the patriot heroes of anti∣quity,
and my memory like that of Harmodius
and Aristogiton, be honoured by statues erected
at the public expence.” This rhapsody, which
was delivered with great emphasis and agitation,
gave so much offence to Jolter, that without
speaking one word, he retired in great wrath to
his own chamber, and the republican returned to
his lodging, in full hope of his prognostic being
verified in the death and destruction of Peregrine
and the painter, which must give rise to some re∣nowned
revolution, wherein he himself would act
a principal part. But the governor, whose imagi∣nation
was not quite so warm and prolifick, went
directly to the Embassador, whom he informed of
his pupil's situation, and besought to interpose
with the French ministry, that he and the other
British subject might obtain their liberty.</P>
<P>His excellency asked if Jolter could guess at the
cause of his imprisonment, that he might be the
better prepared to vindicate or excuse his conduct;
but neither he nor Pipes could give the smallest
hint of intelligence on that subject; though he
furnished himself from Tom's own mouth with a
circumstantial account of the manner in which
his master had been arrested, as well as of his own
behaviour, and the disaster he had received on that
<PB N="100" REF="109"/>
occasion. His Lordship never doubted that Pickle
had brought this calamity upon himself by some
unlucky prank he had played at the masquerade;
especially when he understood that the young
gentleman had drank freely in the afternoon, and
been so whimsical as to go thither with a man in
woman's apparel; and he that same day waited on
the French minister, in full confidence of obtain∣ing
his discharge; but met with more difficulty
than he expected, the court of France being ex∣tremely
punctilious in every thing that concerns
a prince of the blood: the ambassador was, there∣fore,
obliged to talk in very high terms, and
though the present circumstances of the French
politicks would not allow them to fall out with
the British administration for trifles, all the favour
he could procure, was a promise that Pickle
should be set at liberty, provided he would ask
pardon of the prince to whom he had given offence.
His excellency thought this was but a reasonable
condescension, supposing Peregrine to have been
in the wrong; and Jolter was admitted to him,
in order to communicate and reinforce his Lord∣ship's
advice, which was that he should comply
with the terms proposed. The governor, who did
not enter this gloomy fortress without fear and
trembling, found his pupil in a dismal apartment
void of all furniture, but a stool and truckle-bed;
the moment he was admitted, he perceived the
youth whistling with great unconcern, and work∣ing
with his pencil at the bare wall, on which he
had delineated a ludicrous figure labelled with the
name of the nobleman whom he had affronted,
and an English mastiff with his leg lifted up, in
the attitude of making water in his shoe. He had
been even so presumptuous as to explain the de∣vice
<PB N="101" REF="110"/>
with satirical inscriptions in the French lan∣guage,
which when Jolter perused, his hair stood
on end with affright. The very turnkey was
confounded and overawed by the boldness of his
behaviour, which he had never seen matched by
any inhabitant of that place; and actually joined
his friend in persuading him to submit to the easy
demand of the minister. But our hero, far from
embracing the counsel of this advocate, handed
him to the door with great ceremony, and dis∣missed
him with a kick on the breech; and to all
the supplications, and even tears of Jolter, made
no other reply, than that he would stoop to no
condescension, because he had committed no
crime; but would leave his case to the cognizance
and exertion of the British court, whose duty it
was to see justice done to its own subjects: he
desired, however, that Pallet, who was confined
in another place, might avail himself of his own
disposition, which was sufficiently plyable. But
when the governor desired to see his fellow-pri∣soner,
the turnkey gave him to understand that he
had received no orders relating to the lady, and
therefore could not admit him into her apart∣ment;
though he was complaisant enough to tell
him, that she seemed very much mortified at her
confinement, and at certain times behaved as if
her brain was not a little disordered. Jolter thus
baffled in all his endeavours, qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted the Bastile
with a heavy heart, and reported his fruitless ne∣gociation
to the Embassador, who could not help
breaking forth into some acrimonious expressions
against the obstinacy and insolence of the young
man, who, he said, deserved to suffer for his
folly. Nevertheless, he did not desist from his
representations to the French ministry, which he
<PB N="102" REF="111"/>
sound so unyielding, that he was obliged to
threaten in plain terms, to make it a national con∣cern;
and not only write to his court for instruc∣tions,
but even advise the council to make re∣prisals,
and send some French gentleman in Lon∣don
to the Tower.</P>
<P>This intimation had an effect upon the mini∣stry
at Versailles, who rather than run the risk of
incensing a people whom it was neither their in∣terest
nor inclination to disoblige, consented to
discharge the offenders, on condition that they
should leave Paris in three days after their enlarge∣ment.
This proposal was readily agreed to by
Peregrine, who wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now a little more tractable,
and heartily tired of being cooped up in such an
uncomfortable abode, for the space of three long
days, without any sort of communication or en∣tertainment,
but that which his own imagination
suggested.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine makes himself merry at the expence of the
painter, who curses his landlady, and breaks with
the doctor.</HEAD>
<P>AS he could easily conceive the situation of
his companion in adversity, he was unwil∣ling
to leave the place, until he had reaped some
diversion from his distress, and with that view re∣paired
to the dungeon of the afflicted painter, to
which he had by this time free access. When he
entered, the first object that presented itself to his
eye, was so uncommonly ridiculous, that he could
scarce preserve that gravity of countenance which
he had affected in order to execute the joke he
<PB N="103" REF="112"/>
had planned. The forlorn Pallet sat upright in
his bed in a dishabille that was altogether extra∣ordinary.
He had laid aside his monstrous hoop,
together with his stays, gown and petticoat,
wrapped his lappets about his head by way of
night-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap, and wore his domino as a loose morn∣ing
dress; his gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed locks hung down about
his lack-lustre eyes and taw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y neck, in all the
disorder of negligence; his grey beard bristled
about half an inch, through the remains of the
paint with which his visage had been bedaubed,
and every feature of his face was lengthened to
the most ridiculous expression of grief and dismay.
Seeing Peregrine come in, he started up in a sort
of frantic extasy, and running toward him with
open arms, no sooner perceived the woeful ap∣pearance
into which our hero had mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elled his
physiognomy, than he stopped short all of a sud∣den,
and the joy which had begun to take p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses∣sion
of his heart, was in a moment dispelled by
the most rueful presages; so that he stood in a
most ludicrous posture of dejection, like a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣factor
at the Old Baily, when sentence is about to
be pronounced. Pickle taking him by the hand,
heaved a profound sigh, and after having protested
that he was extremely mortified at being pitched
upon as the messenger of bad news, told him
with an air of sympathy and infinite concern,
that the French court having discovered his sex,
had resolved, in consideration of the outrageous
indignity he offered in public to a prince of the
blood, to detain him in the Bastile a prisoner for
life; and that this sentence was a mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gation ob∣tained
by the importunities of the British Embas∣sador;
the punishment ordained by law being no
other than breaking alive upon the wheel. These
<PB N="104" REF="113"/>
tidings aggravated the horrors of the painter to
such a degree, that he roared aloud, and skipped
about the room, in all the extravagance of di∣straction;
taking God and man to witness that he
would rather suffer immediate death, than endure
one year's imprisonment in such a hideous place;
and cursing the hour of his birth, and the moment
on which he departed from his own country.
“For my own part, (said his tormenter in an hy∣pocritical
tone) I was obliged to swallow the bit∣ter
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of making submissions to the prince, who,
as I had not presumed to strike him, received ac∣knowledgments,
in consequence of which I shall
be this day set at liberty; and there is even one
expedient left for the recovery of your freedom.
It is, I own, a disagreeable remedy, but one had
better undergo a little mortification, than be for
ever wretched. Besides, upon second thoughts,
I begin to imagine that you will not for such a
trifle sacrifice yourself to the unceasing horrors of
a solitary dungeon; especially as your condescen∣sion
will in all probability be attended with advan∣tages
which you could not otherwise enjoy.”
Pallet interrupting him with great eagerness, beg∣ged
for the love of God that he would no longer
keep him in the torture of suspence, but mention
that same remedy, which he was resolved to swal∣low,
let it be never so unpalatable.</P>
<P>Peregrine having thus played upon his passions of
fear and hope, answered, that as the offence was
committed in the habit of a woman, which was
a disguise unworthy of the other sex; the French
court was of opinion that the delinquent should
for ever forfeit the privileges and characteristic
of a man, which he had so shamefully deposited,
or in other words, be deprived of his virility; so
<PB N="105" REF="114"/>
that there was an alternative at his own option,
by which he had it in his power to regain imme∣diate
freedom.” “What! cried the painter in
despair, part with my manhood, and become a
singer? Gadzooks! and the devil and all that,
I'll rather lie still where I am, and let myself be
devoured by vermin.” Then thrusting out his
throat, “Here is my wind-pipe, (said he) be so
good, my dear friend, as to give it a slice or
two; if you don't, I shall one of these days be
found dangling in my garters. What an unfor∣tunate
rascal I am! What a blockhead, and a
beast, and a fool was I to trust myself among
such a barbarous ruffian race! Lord forgive you,
Mr. Pickle, for having been the immediate cause
of my disaster; if you had stood by me from the
beginning, according to your promise, and di∣rected
me to a proper place, where I could have
made water without being exposed, I should not
have been teized by that coxcomb who has
brought me to this pass. And why did I put on
this damn'd unlucky dress? Lard curse that
chattering Jezabel of a landlady, who advised
such a preposterous disguise! a disguise which hath
not only brought me to this pass, but also ren∣dered
me abominable to myself, and frightful to
others; for, when I this morning signified to
the turnkey, that I wanted to be shaved, he
looked at my beard with astonishment, and cross∣ing
himself, muttered his pater-noster, believing
me (I suppose) to be a witch, or something
worse. And heaven confound that loathsome
banquet of the ancients, which provoked me to
drink too freely, that I might wash away the
taste of that accursed sillikicaby.”</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="115"/>
Our young gentleman, having heard his la∣mentation
to an end, excused himself for his
conduct, by representing, that he could not pos∣sibly
foresee the disagreeable consequences that
attended it; and in the mean time, strenuously
counselled him to submit to the terms of his en∣largement.
He observed, that he was now ar∣rived
at that time of life, when the lusts of the
flesh should be entirely mortified within him,
and his greatest concern ought to be the health
of his soul, to which nothing could more effec∣tually
contribute than the amputation which was
proposed: that his body, as well as his mind,
would profit by the change, because he would
have no dangerous appetite to gratify, and no
carnal thoughts to divert him from the duties of
his profession; and his voice, which was natu∣rally
sweet, would improve to such a degree,
that he would captivate the ears of all the people
of fashion and taste, and in a little time be cele∣brated
under the appellation of the English Se∣nesino.</P>
<P>These arguments did not fail to make impres∣sion
upon the painter, who, nevertheless, started
three objections to his compliance; namely, the
disgrace of the punishment, the pain of the ope∣ration,
and the dread of his wife. Pickle under∣took
to obviate these difficulties, by assuring him,
that the sentence would be executed so privately,
as never to transpire; that the excision (as he
had learnt from Motecelli) was not so painful as
the drawing of a tooth, and that his wife could
not be so unconscionable, after so many years of
cohabitation, as to take exceptions to an expe∣dient,
by which she would not only enjoy the
conversation of her husband, but even the fruits
<PB N="107" REF="116"/>
of those talents which the knife would so re∣markably
refine.</P>
<P>Pallet shook his head at this last remonstrance,
as if he thought it would not be altogether con∣vincing
to his spouse; but yielded to the proposal,
provided her consent could be obtained. Just as
he signified this condescension, the goaler en∣tered,
and addressing himself to the supposed lady,
expressed his satisfaction in having the honour to
tell her, that she was no longer a prisoner. As
the painter did not understand one word of what
he said, Peregrine undertook the office of inter∣preter,
and made his friend believe, the goaler's
speech was no other than an intimation, that the
ministry had sent a surgeon to execute what was
proposed, and that the instruments and dressings
were prepared in the next room. Alarmed and
terrified at this sudden appointment, he flew to
the other end of the room, and snatching up an
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>then chamber-pot, which was the only of∣fensive
weapon in the place, put himself in a
posture of defiance, and with many oaths threat∣ened
to try the temper of the barber's skull, if he
should presume to set his nose within the apart∣ment.</P>
<P>The goaler, who little expected such a recep∣tion,
concluded that the poor gentlewoman had
actually lost her wits, and retreated with precipi∣tation,
leaving the door open as he went out.
Upon which Pickle, gathering up the particulars
of his dress with great dispatch, crammed them
into Pailet's arms, and taking notice that now
the coast was clear, exhorted him to follow his
footsteps to the gate, where a hackney-coach
stood for his reception. There being no time
for hesitation, the painter took his advice, and
<PB N="108" REF="117"/>
without quitting the utensil, which in his hurry
he forgot to lay down, fallied out in the rear of
our hero, with all that wildness of terror and
impatience which may be reasonably supposed to
take possession of a man who flies from castration
or perpetual imprisonment. Such was the tumult
of his agitation, that his faculty of thinking was for
the present utterly overwhelmed, and he saw no
object but his conductor, whom he followed by a
sort of instinctive impulse, without regarding the
keepers and centinels, who, as he passed with
his cloaths under one arm, and his chamber-pot
brandished above his head, were confounded, and
even dismayed at the strange apparition.</P>
<P>During the whole course of this irruption, he
ceased not to cry with great vociferation, “Drive,
coachman, drive in the name of God!” And the
carriage had proceeded the length of a whole
street, before he manifested the least sign of re∣flection,
but stared like the Gorgon's head, with
his mouth wide open, and each particular hair
crawling and twining like an animated serpent.
At length, however, he began to recover the
use of his senses, and asked if Peregrine thought
him now out of all danger of being retaken.
This unrelenting wag, not yet satisfied with the
affliction he had imposed upon the sufferer, an∣swered
with an air of doubt and concern, that
he hoped they would not be overtaken, and
prayed to God they might not be retarded by
an <HI>Embaras.</HI> Pallet servently joined in this sup∣plication,
and they advanced a few yards further,
when the noise of a coach at full speed behind
them, invaded their ears; and Pickle having
looked out at the window, withdrew his head in
seeming confusion, and exclaimed, “Lord have
<PB N="109" REF="118"/>
mercy upon us! I wish that may not be a guard
sent after us. Methinks I saw the muzzle of a
fusil sticking out of the coach.” The pain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
hearing these tidings, that instant thrust himself
half out at the window, with his helmet still in
his hand, bellowing to the coachman as loud as
he could roar, “Drive, damn ye drive! to the
gates of Jericho and ends of the earth! Drive,
you raggamuffin, you rapscallion, you hell-hound!
drive us to the pit of hell, rather than we should
be taken, and lose the treasures of virility.”</P>
<P>Such a phantom could not pass, without at∣tracting
the curiosity of the people, who ran to
their doors and windows, in order to behold this
object of admiration. With the same view that
coach, which was supposed to be in pursuit of
him, stopt just as the windows of each happened
to be opposite; and Pallet looking behind, and
seeing three men standing upon the foot-board
armed with canes, which his fear converted into
fusils, never doubted that his friend's suspicion
was just; but, shaking his jordan at the imagi∣nary
guard, swore he would sooner die than part
with his precious ware. The owner of the
coach, who was a nobleman of the first quality,
mistook him for some unhappy woman deprived
of her senses; and ordering his coachman to
proceed, convinced the fugitive, to his infinite
joy, that this was no more than a false alarm.
He was not, for all that, freed from anxiety and
trepidation; but our young gentleman, fearing
his brain would not bear a repetition of the same
joke, permitted him to gain his own lodgings,
without further molestation.</P>
<P>His landlady meeting him on the stair, was so
affected at his appearance, that she screamed
<PB N="110" REF="119"/>
aloud, and betook herself to flight; while he,
cursing her with great bitterness, rushed into the
apartment of the doctor, who, instead of re∣ceiving
him with cordial embraces, and congra∣tulating
him upon his deliverance, gave evident
tokens of umbrage and discontent; and even
plainly told him, he hoped to have heard that he
and Mr. Pickle had acted the glorious part of
Cato; an event which would have laid the foun∣dation
of such noble struggles, as could not fail
to end in happiness and freedom; and that he
had already made some progress in an ode that
would have immortalized their names, and in∣spired
the flame of liberty in every honest breast.
“There (said he) I would have proved, that
great talents, and high sentiments of liberty, do
reciprocally produce and assist each other; and il∣lustrated
my assertions with such notes and quo∣tations
from the Greek writers, as would have
opened the eye, of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st blind and unthink∣ing,
and touched the most callous and obdurate
heart. <HI>O fool! to think the man, whose ample
mind must grasp whatever yonder stars survey</HI>—
Prav, Mr. Pallet, what is your opinion of that
image of the mind's grasping the whole universe?
For my own part, I can't help thinking it the
most happy conception that ever entered my ima∣gination.</P>
<P>The painter, who was not such a flaming en∣thusiast
in the cause of liberty, could not brook
the doctor's refle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, which he thought fa∣voured
a little too much of indifference and de∣ficiency
in point of private friendship; and there∣for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
seized the present opportunity of mortifying
his p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide by observing, that the image was,
without all doubt, very grand and magnificent;
<PB N="111" REF="120"/>
but that he had been obliged for the idea to Mr.
Bayes in <HI>The Rehearsal,</HI> who values himself upon
the same figure, conveyed in these words, <HI>But
all these clouds, when by the eye of reason grasp'd,
&amp;c.</HI> Upon any other occasion, the painter
would have triumphed greatly in this detection;
but such was the flutter and confusion of his spi∣rits,
under the apprehension of being retaken,
that without further communication, he retreated
to his own room, in order to resume his own
dress, which he hoped would alter his appearance
in such a manner, as to baffle all search and exa∣mination;
while the physician remained ashamed
and abashed, to find himself convicted of pla∣giarism
by a person of such contemptible talents.
He was offended at this proof of his memory,
and so much enraged at his presumption in ex∣hibiting
it, that he could never forgive his want
of reverence, and took every opportunity of ex∣posing
his ignorance and folly in the sequel. In∣deed,
the ties of private affection were too weak
to engage the heart of this republican, whose
zeal for the community had entirely swallowed
up his concern for individuals. He looked upon
particular friendship as a passion unworthy of his
ample soul, and was a professed admirer of L.
Manlius, Junius Brutus, and those later patriots
of the same name, who shut their cars against
the cries of nature, and resisted all the dictates of
gratitude and humanity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pallet conceives an hearty contempt for his fellow-traveller,
and attaches himself to Pickle, who,
nevertheless, persecutes him with his mischievous
talent, upon the road to Flanders.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, his companion having em∣ployed
divers pails full of water, in clearing
himself from the squalor of a jail, submitted his
face to the barber, tinged his eye-brows with a
sable hue, and being dressed in his own cloaths,
ventured to visit Peregrine, who was still under
the hands of his valet de chambre, and who gave
him to understand, that his escape had been con∣nived
at, and that the condition of their deli∣verance
was their departure from Paris in three
days.</P>
<P>The painter was transported with joy, when
he learnt that he ran no risque of being retaken;
and far from repining at the terms of his en∣largement,
would have willingly set out on his
return to England that same afternoon; for the
Bastile had made such an impression upon him,
that he started at the sound of every coach, and
turned pale at sight of a French soldier. In the
fullness of his heart, he comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained of the doc∣tor's
indifference, and related what had passed at
their meeting with evident marks of resentment
and disrespect; which were not at all diminished,
when Jolter informed him of the physician's be∣haviour,
when he sent for him, to confer about
the means of abridging their confinement. Pickle
himself was incensed at his want of bowels, and
perceiving how much he had sunk in the opinion
<PB N="113" REF="122"/>
of his fellow-traveller, resolved to encourage
these sentiments of disgust, and occasionally fo∣ment
the division to a downright quarrel, which
he foresaw would produce some diversion, and
perhaps expose the poet's character in such a
light, as would effectually punish him for his ar∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gance
and barbarity. With this view, he le∣velled
several satirical jokes at the doctor's pe∣dantry
and want of taste, which had appeared so
conspicuous in the quotations he had got by heart,
from ancient authors, in his affected disdain of
the best pictures in the world; which, had he
been endowed with the least share of discernment,
he could not have beheld with such insensibility;
and lastly, in his ridiculous banquet, which none
but an egregious coxcomb, devoid of all elegance
and sense, would have prepared, or presented to
rational beings. In a word, our young gentle∣man
played the artillery of his wit against him
with such success, that the painter seemed to
wake from a dream, and went home with the
most hearty contempt for the person he had for∣merly
adored.</P>
<P>Instead of using the privilege of a friend, to
enter his apartment without ceremony, he sent
in his servant with a message, importing, that he
intended to set out from Paris next day, in com∣pany
with Mr. Pickle, and desiring to know
whether or not he was, or would be prepared
for the journey. The doctor, struck with the
manner as well as the matter of this intimation,
went immediately to Pallet's room, and de∣manded
to know the cause of such a sudden de∣termination,
without his privity or concurrence;
and when he understood the necessity of their af∣fairs,
rather than travel by himself, he ordered
<PB N="114" REF="123"/>
his baggage to be packed up, and signified his
readiness to conform to the emergency of the
case; though he was not at all pleased with the
cavalier behaviour of Pallet, to whom he threw
out some hints of his own importance, and the
immensity of his condescension, in favouring him
with such marks of regard. But by this time
these insinuations had lost their effect upon the
painter, who told him with an arch sneer, that
he did not at all question his learning and abili∣ties▪
and particularly his sk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in cookery, which
he should never forget while his palate retained
its function; but nevertheless advised him, for
the sake of the degenerate eaters of these days,
to spare a little of his sal armoniac in the next
sill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kickab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he should prepare; and bate some∣what
of the devil's dung, which he had so p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣tifully
crammed into the roasted fowls, unless he
had a mind to convert his guests into patients,
with a view of licking himself whole for the ex∣pence
of the entertainment.</P>
<P>The physician, nettled at these sarcasms, eyed
him with a look of indignation and disdain, and
being unwilling to express himself in English, lest
in the course of the altercation Pallet should be
so much irritated as to depart without him, he
vented his anger in Greek, pronouncing with
great rancour, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.
The pain∣ter,
though by the sound he supposed this quo∣tation
to be Greek, complimented his friend up∣on
his knowledge in the Welch language, and
found means to rally him quite out of temper;
so that he retired to his own chamber in the ut∣most
<PB N="115" REF="124"/>
wrath and mortification, and left his anta∣gonist
exulting o'er the victory he had won.</P>
<P>While these things passed between these ori∣ginals,
Peregrine waited upon the Embassador,
whom he thanked for his kind interposition, ac∣knowledging
the indiscretion of his own conduct
with such appearance of conviction, and promises
of reformation, that his Excellency freely for∣gave
him for all the trouble he had been put to
on his account, fortified him with sensible ad∣vices,
and assuring him of his continua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> favour
and friendship, gave him at parting, letters of in∣troduction
to several persons of quality belonging
to the British court.</P>
<P>Thus distinguished, our young gentleman took
leave of all his French acquaintance, and spent
the evening with some of those who had en∣joyed
the greatest share of his intimac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and con∣fidence;
while Jolter superintended his domestic
concerns, and with infinite joy bespoke a post∣chaise
and horses, in order to convey him from a
place where he lived in continual apprehension of
suffering by the dangerous disposition of his pu∣pil
Every thing being adjusted according to
their plan, they and their fellow-travel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs next
day dined together, and about four in the after∣noon
took their departure in two chaises, escorted
by the valet de chambre, Pipes and the doctor's
lacquey on horseback, well furnished with arms
and ammunition, in case of being attacked by
robbers on the road.</P>
<P>It was about eleven o'clock at night when they
arrived at Senlis, which was the place at which
they proposed to lodge, and where they were ob∣liged
to knock up the people of the inn, before
they could have their supper prepared. All the
<PB N="116" REF="125"/>
provision in the house was but barely sufficient to
furnish one indifferent meal; however, the painter
consoled himself for the quantity with the quality
of the dishes, one of which was a fricassee of
rabbit, a preparation that he valued above all the
dainties that ever smoaked upon the table of the
sumptuous Heliogabalus.</P>
<P>He had no sooner expressed himself to this ef∣fect,
than our hero, who was almost incessantly
laying traps for diversion at his neighbour's ex∣pence,
laid hold on the declaration; and recol∣lecting
the story of Scipio and the muleteer in
Gil Blas, resolved to perpetrate a joke upon the
stomach of Pallet, which seemed particularly well
disposed to an hearty supper. He accordingly
digested his plan; and the company being seated
at table, affected to gaze with peculiar eagerness
at the painter, who had helped himself to a large
portion of the fricassee, and began to swallow it
with infinite relish. Pallet, notwithstanding the
keenness of his appetite, could not help taking
notice of Pickle's demeanour; and making a
short pause in the exercise of his grinders, “You
are surprized (said he) to see me make so much
dispatch; but I was extremely hungry, and this
is one of the best fricassees I ever tasted: the
French are very expert in these dishes, that I
must allow; and upon my conscience, I would
never desire to eat a more delicate rabbit than this
that lies upon my plate.”</P>
<P>Peregrine made no other reply to this enco∣mium,
than the repetition of the word rabbit! with
a note of admiration, and such a significant shake
of the head, as effectually alarmed the other,
who instantly suspended the action of his jaws,
and with the morsel half chewed in his mouth,
<PB N="117" REF="126"/>
stared round him with a certain stolidity of ap∣prehension,
which is easier conceived than de∣scribed,
until his eyes encountered the counte∣nance
of Thomas Pipes, who being instructed,
and posted opposite to him for the occasion, ex∣hibited
an arch grin, that compleated the painter's
disorder. Afraid of swallowing his mouthful, and
ashamed to dispose of it any other way, he sat
some time in a most distressed state of suspence;
and being questioned by Mr. Jolter touching his
calamity, made a violent effort of the muscles of
his gullet, which with difficulty performed their
office; and then, with great confusion and con∣cern,
asked if Mr. Pickle suspected the rabbit's
identity. The young gentleman assuming a my∣ste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us
air, pretended ignorance of the matter,
observing, that he was apt to suspect all dishes of
that kind, since he had been informed of the
tricks which were commonly played at inns in
France, Italy and Spain, and recounted that pas∣sage
in Gil Blas, which we have hinted at above;
saying, he did not pretend to be a connoisseur in
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mals, but the legs of the creature which com∣posed
that fricassee did not, in his opinion, re∣sem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
those of the rabbits he had usually seen.
This observation had an evident effect upon the
features of the painter, who with certain signs of
loathing and astonishment, exclaimed, “Lord
Jesus!” and appealed to Pipes for a discovery of
the truth, by asking if he knew any thing of the
affair. Tom very gravely replied, that he did
suppose the food was wholesome enough, for he
had seen the skin and feet of a special ram-cat,
n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w flea'd, hanging upon the door of a small
pantry adjoining to the kitchen.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="127"/>
Before this sentence was uttered, Pallet's belly
seemed to move in contact with his back-bone,
his colour changed, no part but the whites of his
eyes were to be seen, he dropped his lower jaw,
and fixing his hands in his sides, reached with
such convulsive agonies, as amazed and discon∣certed
the whole company; and what augmented
his disorder, was the tenacious retention of his
stomach, which absolutely refused to part with
its contents, notwithstanding all the energy of
his abhorrence, which threw him into a cold
sweat, and almost into a swoon.</P>
<P>Pickle, alarmed at his condition, assured him it
was a genuine rabbit, and that he had tutored Pipes
to say otherwise for the joke's sake. But this confes∣sion
he considered as a friendly artifice of Pickle's
com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>assion, and therefore it had little effect upon
his constitution. By the assistance▪ however, of a
large bumper of brandy, his spirits were recruited,
and his recollection so far recovered, that he was
able to declare, with divers contorsions of face,
that the dish had a particular rankness of taste,
which he had imputed partly to the nature of the
French coney, and partly to the composition of
their sauces; then he inveighed against the infa∣mous
practices of French publicans, attributing
such imposition to their oppressive government,
which kept them so necessitous, that they were
tempted to exercise all manner of knavery upon
their unwary guests.</P>
<P>Jolter, who could not find in his heart to let
slip any opportunity of speaking in favour of the
French, told him that he was a very great stranger
to their police, else he would know, that if up∣on
information to the magistrate, it should ap∣pear
that any traveller, native or fore<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gner, has
<PB N="119" REF="128"/>
been imposed upon, or ill-treated by a publican,
the offender would be immediately obliged to
shut up his house, and if his behaviour had been
notorious, he himself would be sent to the gal∣lies,
without the least hesitation; and as for the
dish which hath been made the occasion of your
present disorder, (said he) I will take upon me
to affirm, it was prepared of a genuine rabbit,
which was skinned in my presence; and in con∣firmation
of what I assert, though such fricassees
are not the favourites of my taste, I will eat a
part of this without scruple.” So saying, he
swallowed several mouthfuls of the questioned
coney, and Pallet seemed to eye it again with in∣clination;
nay, he even resumed his knife and
fork, and being just on the point of applying
them, was seized with another qualm of appre∣hension,
that broke out in an exclamation of,
“After all, Mr. J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lter, if it sh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld be a real
ram-cat—Lord have mercy upon me! here is
one of the claws.” With these words he pre∣sented
the tip of a toe, of which Pipes had snipt
off five or six from a duck that was roasted, and
purposely scattered them in the fric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: and the
governor could not behold this testimonial with∣out
symptoms of uneasiness and r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>morse; so that
he and the painter sat silenced and abathed, and
made faces at each other, while <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he physician,
who hated them both, exulted over their afflic∣tion,
bidding them be of good c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, and pro∣ceed
with their meal; for he was ready to de∣monstrate,
that the flesh of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at was as nou∣rishing
and delicious as veal or mutton▪ provided
they could prove, that the said cat was not of the
boar-kind, and had fed chiefly on vegetable diet,
or even confined its carnivorous appetite to rats
<PB N="120" REF="129"/>
and mice, which he affirmed to be dainties of
exquisite taste and flavour. He said, it was a vul∣gar
mistake to think that all flesh-devouring crea∣tures
were unfit to be eaten; witness the con∣sumption
of swine and ducks, animals that de∣light
in carnage, as well as fish, that prey upon
each other, and feed on bait and carrion; toge∣ther
with the demand for bear, of which the
best hams in the world are made. He then ob∣served,
that the Negroes on the coast of Guinea,
who are a healthy and vigorous people, prefer
cats and dogs to all other fare; and mentioned
from history several sieges, during which the in∣habitants,
who were blocked up, lived upon
these animals, and had recourse even to human
flesh, which, to his certain knowledge, was in
all respects preferable to pork; for, in the course
of his studies, he had, for the experiment's sake,
eaten a steak cut from the buttock of a person
who had been hanged.</P>
<P>This dissertation, far from composing, increased
the disquiet in the stomachs of the governor and
painter, who hearing the last illustration, turned
their eyes upon the orator, at the same instant,
with looks of horror and disgust; and the one
muttering the term <HI>Cannibal,</HI> and the other pro∣nouncing
the word <HI>abomination,</HI> they rose from ta∣ble
in a great hurry, and running towards another
apartment, justled with such violence in the pas∣sage,
that both were overturned by the shock,
which also contributed to the effect of their nau∣sea,
that mutually defiled them as they lay.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Nor is the physician sacred from his ridicule. They
reach Arras, where our adventurer engages in
play with two French officers, who next morning
give the landlord an interesting proof of their
importance.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH Pickle enjoyed their disaster,
he was resolved to practise some invention
upon the doctor, that he might not triumph in
his revenge with impunity; and thus determined,
when Pallet had overcome the malady of his own
imagination, he imparted to him a plan of re∣prizal,
which agreeably flattered his resentment,
and was executed in this manner: as the painter
and physician lay in separate beds in the same
chamber, the former watched, till by the other's
snoring he was certified of his being fast asleep;
then moving softly to the door, where Pipes
stood ready furnished for the purpose, took a
tea-kettle full of warm water, and cautiously
conveying the spout under the cloaths of the doc∣tor's
bed, poured in the liquor, imperceptibly,
to the quantity of half a gallon, and then retired
to rest.</P>
<P>Peregrine having undertaken to rouze his fel∣low-travellers
in the morning, entered the doc∣tor's
apartment with the dawn, and waked them
both with the same hollow. The painter imme∣diately
sprung out of bed; but the physician,
finding himself drenched from head to foot, was
equally astonished and ashamed, never doubting
that he had unfortunately bedewed himself in his
fleep. This mistake he thought so inconsistent
<PB N="122" REF="131"/>
with the dignity of his character, that he durst
not venture to disclose his condition, especially
as he well knew how eagerly the company would
seize such an occasion of making merry at his
expence; and it would be impracticable to con∣ceal
it from their knowledge, if he should be ob∣liged
to get up in their presence: he therefore
lay still in the utmost perplexity and tribulation,
while his two companions, guessing his thoughts,
and rejoicing at his anxiety, sat down by his bed∣side,
and exhorted him to rise. He told them,
that having sweated profusely all night, he could
not, with any regard to his health, get up, until
he should be shifted, and the pores of his skin
regularly closed; and in the mean time, desired
they would take the trouble of seeing the horses
put to the chaises, and the reckoning adjusted;
assuring them, he should be ready to attend them
before their business could be dispatched. Our
young gentleman gave him to understand, that
Mr. Jolter had charged himself with the payment
of the bill, and the servants were now employed
about the carriages, so that he had not a moment
to lose; he therefore rung the bell for his foot∣man,
and bade him bring a clean shirt for his
master with all possible speed.</P>
<P>Ere the fellow returned, it was broad day;
and a message came from the governor, import∣ing
that the horses were yoked. The doctor's
confusion increased, he was tortured by the looks,
and baited by the importunities of his company;
and moreover, suffered the uncomfortable situa∣tion
of being steeped, as he imagined, in his own
brine. At length Peregrine, impatient of his
delay, took the privilege of a comrade, and ac∣cusing
the republican of sloth, pulled off the bed-cloaths
<PB N="123" REF="132"/>
at one snatch, and displayed him at full
length, in this opprobrious condition.</P>
<P>The painter seeing him thus exposed, lifted up
his hands, and in affected astonishment, “Lord
watch over us! (cried he) the doctor is a dead
man; sure the whole sap of his body is run out,
or have you spilt a whole dish of fillykickaby in
the bed? for it smells cursedly strong of sal ar∣moniac.”
Peregrine, in order to compleat the
physician's overthrow, shut up his nostrils with
his finger and thumb, and asked in a snuffling
tone, if he was subject to that infirmity.</P>
<P>Unspeakable were the shame and vexation of
the modern Pindar on this occasion; he was at
the same time tormented with all the pangs which
mortified vanity can feel, and agitated by all the
furies of resentment against the persons who had
detected his disgrace, and who having thus in∣sulted
him in his distress, quitted the room with a
loud laugh, leaving him to the thorny reflections
of his own pride. Nor could the painter, who
was not at all to be praised for his moderation,
abstain from certain ill-natured allusions to his
calamity, which by these means reached the ears
of the governor, from whom (of all men) he
desired to keep it concealed; so that he remained
sullen and dejected during the whole journey:
not but that he attempted to recover his impor∣tance,
by haranguing upon the Roman highways,
when Mr. Jolter desired the company to take no∣tice
of the fine pavement upon which they tra∣velled
from Paris into Flanders; but Pallet, who
thought he had now gained the ascendency over
the physician, exerted himself in maintaining the
superiority he had acquired, by venting various
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon his self-conceit and affectation of
<PB N="124" REF="133"/>
learning, and even uttering puns and conundrums
upon the remarks which the republican retailed.
When he talked of the Flaminian Way, the
painter questioned if it was a better pavement
than the Fleminian way on which they travelled:
and the doctor having observed, that this road
was made for the convenience of drawing the
French artillery into Flanders, which was often
the seat of war; his competitor in wit replied
with infinite vivacity, “There are more great
guns than the French king knows of drawn along
this causeway, doctor.”</P>
<P>Encouraged by the success of these efforts,
which tickled the imagination of Jolter, and
drew smiles (as he imagined) of approbation from
our hero, he sported in many other aequivoques
of the same nature; and at dinner told the phy∣sician,
that he was like the root of the tongue,
as being cursedly down in the mouth.</P>
<P>By this time, such was the animosity subsist∣ing
between these quondam friends, that they
never conversed together, except with a view of
exposing each other to the ridicule or contempt
of their fellow-travellers. The doctor was at
great pains to point out the folly and ignorance
of Pallet in private to Peregrine, who was often
conjured in the same manner by the painter, to
take notice of the physician's want of manners
and taste. Pickle pretended to acquiesce in the
truth of their mutual severity, which indeed was
extremely just, and by malicious insinuations
blew up their contention, with a view of bringing
it to open hostility. But, both seemed so averse
to deeds of mortal purpose, that for a long time
his arts were baffled, and he could not spirit them
<PB N="125" REF="134"/>
up to any pitch of resentment higher than scur∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous
repartee.</P>
<P>Before they reached Arras, the city-gates were
shut, so that they were obliged to take up their
lodging at an indifferent house in the suburbs,
where they found a couple of French officers,
who had also rode post from Paris, so far on their
way to Lisle. These gentlemen were about the
age of thirty, and their deportment distinguished
by such an air of insolence, as disgusted our hero,
who, nevertheless, accosted them politely in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and proposed that they should sup together.
They thanked him for the honour of his invita∣tion,
which, however, they declined, upon pre∣tence
of having ordered something for themselves;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut promised to wait upon him and his company
immediately after their repast.</P>
<P>This they accordingly performed; and after
having drank a few glasses of Burgundy, one of
them asked, if the young gentleman would, for
pastime, take an hand at quadrille. Peregrine
easily divined the meaning of this proposal, which
was made with no other view than that of sleecing
him and his fellow-travellers; for he well knew
to what shifts a subaltern in the French service is
reduced, in order to maintain the appearance of a
gentleman, and had reason to believe that most of
them were sharpers from their youth: but, as he
depended a good deal upon his own penetration
and address, he gratified the stranger's desire;
and a party was instantly formed of the painter,
the physician, the proposer and himself, the other
officer having professed himself utterly ignorant
of the game; yet, in the course of the play, he
took his station at the back of Pickle's chair,
which was opposite to his friend, on pretence of
<PB N="126" REF="135"/>
himself with seeing his manner of conducting
the cards. The youth was not such a novice
but that he perceived the design of this palpable
piece of behaviour, which, notwithstanding, he
overlook'd for the present, with a view of flat∣tering
their hopes in the beginning, that they
might be the more effectually punished, by their
disappointment in the end.</P>
<P>The game was scarce begun, when by the re∣flection
of a glass he discerned the officer at his
back, making signs to his companion, who, by these
pre-concerted gestures, was perfectly informed
of the contents of Peregrine's hand, and of con∣sequence
fortunate in the course of play.</P>
<P>Thus they were allowed to enjoy the fruits of
their dexterity, until their money amounted to
some Loui's; when our young gentleman, think∣ing
it high time to do himself justice, signified in
very polite terms to the gentleman who stood be∣hind
him, that he could never play with ease
and deliberation when he was overlooked by any
by-stander, and begg'd that he would have the
goodness to be seated.</P>
<P>As this was a remonstrance which the stranger
could not with any shew of breeding resist, he
asked pardon, and retired to the chair of the
physician, who frankly told him, that it was not
the fashion of his country for one to submit his
hand to the perusal of a spectator; and when, in
consequence of this rebuff, he wanted to quarter
himself upon the painter, he was refused by a
wave of the hand, and a shake of the head, with
an exclamation of, <HI>Pardonnez moi!</HI> which was
repeated with such emphasis, as discomposed his
effrontery, and he found himself obliged to sit
down in a state of mortification.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="136"/>
The odds being thus removed, fortune pro∣ceeded
in her usual channel; and though the
Frenchman, deprived of his ally, endeavoured
to practise divers strokes of finesse, the rest of
the company observed him with such vigilance
and caution, as baffled all his attempts, and in a
very little time he was compelled to part with
his winning: but having engaged in the match
with an intention of taking all advantages, whe∣ther
fair or unfair, that his superior skill should
give him over the Englishmen, the money was
not refunded without a thousand disputes, in the
course of which he essayed to intimidate his an∣tagonist
with high words, which were retorted
by our hero with such interest, as convinced him
that he had mistaken his man, and persuaded him
to make his retreat in quiet. Indeed, it was not
without cause that they repined at the bad suc∣cess
of their enterprize; because, in all likeli∣hood,
they had nothing to depend upon for the
present but their own industry, and knew not
how to defray their expences on the road, except
by some acquisition of this kind.</P>
<P>Next morning they rose at day-break, and re∣solving
to anticipate their fellow-lodgers, bespoke
post-horses as soon as they could be admitted into
the city; so that when our company appeared,
their beasts were ready in the yard; and they
only waited to discuss the bill, which they had
ordered to be made out. The landlord of the
inn presented his carte with fear and trembling to
one of those ferocious cavaliers, who no sooner
cast his eye upon the sum total, than he discharged
a volley of dreadful oaths, and asked if the king's
officers were to be treated in that manner. The
poor publican protested with great humility, that
<PB N="128" REF="137"/>
he had the utmost respect for his majesty, and
every thing that belonged to him; and that, far
from consulting his own interest, all that he de∣sired
was, to be barely indemnified for the ex∣pence
of their lodging.</P>
<P>This condescension seemed to have no other
effect than that of encouraging their arrogance.
They swore his extortion should be explained to
the commandant of the town, who would, by
making him a public example, teach other inn-keepers
how to behave towards men of honour;
and threatened with such confidence of indigna∣tion,
that the wretched landlord, dreading the
consequence of their wrath, implored pardon in
the most abject manner, begging with many sup∣plications,
that he might have the pleasure of
lodging them at his own charge. This was a
favour which he with great difficulty obtained;
they chid him severely for his imposition, ex∣horted
him to have more regard for his own con∣science,
as well as for the convenience of his
guests; and cautioning him in particular touching
his behaviour to the gentlemen of the army,
mounted their horses, and rode off in great state,
leaving him very thankful for having so success∣fully
appeased the choler of two officers, who
wanted either inclination or ability to pay their
bill: for experience had taught him to be ap∣prehensive
of all such travellers, who commonly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the landlord under contribution, by way of
atonement for the extravagance of his demands,
even after he has professed his willingness to en∣tertain
them on their own terms.</P>

condemned by the doctor, and defended by the go∣vernor.
They arrive in safety at Lisle, dine at
an ordinary, visit the citadel. The physician
quarrels with a North-Briton, who is put in
arrest.</HEAD>
<P>THESE honourable adventurers being gone,
Peregrine, who was present during the
transaction, informed himself of the particulars
from the mouth of the inn-keeper himself, who
took God and the saints to witness, that he
should have been a loser by their custom, even if
the bill had been paid; because he was on his
guard against their objections, and had charged
every article at an under price: but such was
the authority of officers in France, that he durst
not dispute the least circumstance of their will;
for had the case come under the cognizance of
the magistrate, he must in course have suffered
by the maxims of their government, which never
fail to abet the oppression of the army; and be∣sides,
run the risque of incurring their future re∣sentment,
which would be sufficient to ruin him
from top to bottom.</P>
<P>Our hero boiled with indignation at this in∣stance
of injustice and arbitrary power; and turn∣ing
to his governor, asked if this too was a proof
of the happiness enjoyed by the French people.
Jolter replied, that e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery human constitution
must in some things be imperfect; and owned,
that in this kingdom gentlemen were more coun∣tenanced
than the vulgar, because it was to be pre∣sumed,
<PB N="130" REF="139"/>
that their own sentiments of honour and
superior qualifications, would entitle them to this
preheminence, which had also a retrospective
view to the merit of their ancestors, in conside∣ration
of which they were at first ennobled: but
he affirmed, that the inn-keeper had misrepre∣sented
the magistracy, which in France never
failed to punish flagrant outrages and abuse, with∣out
respect of persons.</P>
<P>The painter approved of the wisdom of the
French government, in bridling the insolence of
the mob, by which, he assured them, he had
often suffered in his own person; having been
often bespattered by hackney-coachmen, justled
by draymen and porters, and reviled in the most
opprobrious terms by the watermen of London,
where he had once lost his bag, and a considerable
quantity of hair, which had been cut off by
some rascal in his passage through Ludgate, during
the lord mayor's procession. On the other hand,
the doctor with great warmth alledged, that those
officers ought to suffer death, or banishment at
least, for having plundered the people in this
manner, which was so impudent and barefaced,
as plainly to prove they were certain of escaping
with impunity, and that they were old offenders
in the same degree of delinquency. He said,
that the greatest man in Athens would have been
condemned to perpetual exile, and seen his estate
confiscated for public use, had he dared in such
a licentious manner to violate the rights of a fel∣low-citizen:
and as for the little affronts to
which a man may be subject, from the petulance
of the multitude, he looked upon them as glo∣rious
indications of liberty, which ought not to
be repressed, and would at any time rejoice to
<PB N="131" REF="140"/>
find himself overthrown in a kennel by the inso∣lence
of a son of freedom, even though the fall
should cost him a limb: adding, by way of il∣lustration,
that the greatest pleasure he ever en∣joyed,
was in seeing a dustman wilfully overturn
a gentleman's coach, in which two ladies were
bruised, even to the danger of their lives. Pallet,
shocked at the extravagance of this declaration,
“If that be the case (said he) I wish you may
see every bone in your body broke, by the first
carman you meet in the streets of London.”</P>
<P>This argument being discussed, and the reck∣oning
discharged without any deduction, although
the landlord, in stating the articles, had an eye
to the loss he had sustained by his own country∣men,
they departed from Arras, and arrived in
safety at Lisle, about two o'clock in the after∣noon.</P>
<P>They had scarce taken possession of their lodg∣ings,
in a large hotel on the Grande Place, when
the inn-keeper gave them to understand, that
he kept an ordinary below, which was frequented
by several English gentlemen who resided in
town, and that dinner was then upon the table.
Peregrine, who seized all opportunities of ob∣serving
new characters, persuaded his company
to dine in public; and they were accordingly
conducted to the place, where they found a
mixture of Scotch and Dutch officers, who
had come from Holland to learn their exercises
at the academy, and some gentlemen in the
French service, who were upon garison-duty in
the citadel. Among these last was a person about
the age of fifty, of a remarkably genteel air
and polite address, dignified with a Maltese cross,
and distinguished by the particular veneration
of all those who knew him. When he under∣stood
<PB N="132" REF="141"/>
that Pickle and his friends were travellers,
he accosted the youth in English, which he spoke
tolerably well; and as they were strangers, of∣fered
to attend them in the afternoon to all the
places worth seeing in Lisle. Our hero thanked
him for his excess of politeness, which (he said)
was peculiar to the French nation; and struck
with his engaging appearance, industriously court∣ed
his conversation, in the course of which he
learnt, that this chevalier was a man of good
sense and great experience, that he was perfectly
well acquainted with the greatest part of Europe,
had lived some years in England, and was no
stranger to the constitution and genius of that
people.</P>
<P>Having dined, and drank to the healths of the
English and French kings, two Fiacres were
called, in one of which the knight, with one of
his companions, the governor and Peregrine
seated themselves, the other being occupied by
the physician, Pallet, and two Scottish officers,
who proposed to accompany them in their circuit.
The first place they visited was the citadel, round
the ramparts of which they walked, under the
conduct of the knight, who explained with great
accuracy the intention of every particular fortifi∣cation
belonging to, that seemingly impregnable
fortress; and when they had satisfied their cu∣riosity,
took coach again, in order to view the
arsenal, which stands in another quarter of the
town: but, just as Pickle's carriage had crossed
the Promenade, he heard his own name bawled
aloud by the painter; and ordering the Fiacre to
stop, saw Pallet with one half of his body thrust
out at the window of the other coach, crying
with a terrified look, “Mr. Pickle, Mr. Pickle,
<PB N="133" REF="142"/>
for the love of God! halt, and prevent blood∣shed,
else here will be carnage and cutting of
throats.” Peregrine, surprized at this exclama∣tion,
immediately alighted, and advancing to
the other vehicle, found one of their military
companions standing upon the ground, at the fur∣ther
side of the coach, with his sword drawn,
and fury in his countenance; and the physician,
with a quivering lip and haggard aspect, struggling
with the other, who had interposed in the quarrel,
and detained him in his place.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman, upon inquiry, found
that this animosity had sprung from a dispute that
happened upon the ramparts, touching the strength
of the fortification, which the doctor, according
to custom, undervalued, because it was a mo∣dern
work; saying, that by the help of the mi∣litary
engines used among the ancients, and a
few thousands of pioneers, he would engage to
take it in less than ten days after he should sit
down before it. The North-Briton, who was
as great a pedant as the physician, having studied
fortification, and made himself master of Caesar's
Commentaries and Polybius, with the observa∣tions
of Folard, affirmed, that all the methods
of besieging practised by the ancients, would be
utterly ineffectual against such a plan as that of
the citadel of Lisle; and began to compare the
Vineae, Aggeres, Arietes, Scorpiones and Cata∣pultae
of the Romans, with the trenches, mines,
batteries and mortars used in the present art of
war. The republican, finding himself attacked
upon what he thought his strong side, summoned
all his learning to his aid; and describing the fa∣mous
siege of Plataea, happened to misq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote a
passage of Thucydides, in which he was cor∣rected
<PB N="144" REF="143"/>
by the other, who having been educated
for the church, was also a connoisseur in the
Greek language. The doctor, incensed at being
detected in such a blunder, in presence of Pallet,
who (he knew) would promulgate his shame,
told the officer, with great arrogance, that his
objection was frivolous, and that he must not
pretend to dispute on these matters with one who
had considered them with the utmost accuracy
and care. His antagonist, piqued at this super∣cilious
insinuation, replied with great heat, that
for ought he knew, the doctor might be a very
expert apothecary, but that in the art of war,
and knowledge in the Greek tongue, he was no
other than an ignorant pretender. This asseve∣ration
produced an answer full of virulence, in∣cluding
a national reflection upon the soldier's
country; and the contention rose to mutual
abuse, when it was suppressed by the admoni∣tions
of the other two, who begged they would
not expose themselves in a strange place, but be∣have
themselves like fellow-subjects and friends.
They accordingly ceased reviling each other, and
the affair was seemingly forgot; but, after they
had resumed their places in the coach, the pain∣ter
unfortunately asked the meaning of the
word Tortoise, which he had heard them men∣tion
among the Roman implements of war.
This question was answered by the physician,
who described the nature of this expedient so
little to the satisfaction of the officer, that he
contradicted him flatly, in the midst of his expla∣nation;
a circumstance which provoked the re∣publican
to such a degree, that in the temerity
of his passion, he uttered the epithet <HI>impertinent
scoundrel;</HI> which was no sooner pronounced
<PB N="135" REF="144"/>
than the Caledonian made manual application
to his nose, and leaping out of the coach, stood
waiting for him on the plain; while he (the
physician) made feeble efforts to join him,
being easily retained by the other soldier; and
Pallet, dreading the consequence in which he him∣self
might be involved, bellowed aloud for pre∣vention.</P>
<P>Our hero endeavoured to quiet the commo∣tion,
by representing to the Scot, that he had
already taken satisfaction for the injury he had
received; and telling the doctor, that he had de∣served
the chastisement which was inflicted upon
him: but the officer (encouraged perhaps by the
confusion of his antagonist) insisted upon his ask∣ing
pardon for what he had said; and the doctor,
believing himself under the protection of his friend
Pickle, far from agreeing to such concession,
breathed nothing but defiance and revenge: so
that the chevalier, in order to prevent mischief,
put the soldier under arrest, and sent him to his
lodgings, under the care of the other French
gentleman and his own companion; they being
also accompanied by Mr. Jolter, who having
formerly seen all the curiosities of Lisle, willingly
surrendered his place to the physician.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pickle engages with a knight of Malta, in a con∣versation
upon the English stage, which is fol∣lowed
by a dissertation on the theatres of the an∣cients,
by the doctor.</HEAD>
<P>THE rest of the company proceeded to the
arsenal, which having viewed, together
with some remarkable churches, they, in their
return, went to the comedy, and saw the Cid of
Corneille tolerably well represented. In conse∣quence
of this entertainment, the discourse at
supper turned upon dramatic performances; and
all the objections of Mons. de Scudery to the
piece they had seen acted, together with the de∣cision
of the French academy, were canvassed
and discussed. The knight was a man of letters
and taste, and particularly well acquainted with
the state of the English stage; so that when the
painter boldly pronounced sentence against the
French manner of acting, on the strength of
having frequented a Covent-Garden club of cri∣ticks,
and been often admitted by virtue of an
order, into the pit; a comparison immediately
ensued, not between the authors, but the actors
of both nations, to whom the chevalier and Pe∣regrine
were no strangers. Our hero, like a
good Englishman, made no scruple of giving the
preference to the performers of his own country,
who, he alledged, obeyed the genuine impulses
of nature, in exhibiting the passions of the human
mind; and entered so warmly into the spirit of
their several parts, that they often fancied them∣selves
the very heroes they represented. Whereas,
<PB N="137" REF="146"/>
the action of the Parisian players, even in their
most interesting characters, was generally such
an extravagance in voice and gesture, as is no
where to be observed but on the stage. To
illustrate this assertion, he availed himself of his
talent, and mimicked the manner and voice of all
the principal performers, male and female, be∣longing
to the French comedy; to the admira∣tion
of the chevalier, who having complimented
him upon this surprising modulation, begged leave
to dissent in some particulars from the opinion he
had avowed. “That you have good actors in
England, (said he) it would be unjust and absurd
in me to deny; your theatre is adorned by one
woman, whose sensibility and sweetness of voice
is such as I have never observed on any other
stage; she has, besides, an elegance of person
and expression of features, that wonderfully adapt
her for the most engaging characters of your best
plays; and I must freely own that I have been
as highly delighted, and as deeply affected, by a
Monimia and Belvidera at London, as ever I
was by a Cornelia and Cleopatra at Paris. You
can, moreover, boast of several comic actors who
are perfect masters of buffoonery and grimace;
though, to be free with you, I think, in these
qualifications you are excelled by the players of
Amsterdam: neither are you destitute of those,
who, with a good deal of cultivation, might ac∣quire
some degree of excellence in the representa∣tion
of tragic characters: but I shall never cease
to wonder that the English, who are certainly a
sensible and discerning people should be so much
infatuated, as to applaud and caress with the most
extravagant approbation, not to say adoration and
regard, one or two gracioso's, who, I will be
<PB N="138" REF="147"/>
bold to say, would scarce be able to earn their
bread by their talents, on any other theatre under
the sun. I have seen one of these, in the cele∣brated
part of Richard the third, which, I be∣lieve,
is not a character of ridicule, sollicit and
triumph in the laugh of the audience, during the
best part of a scene in which the author has re∣presented
that prince as an object of abhorrence.
I have observed the same person in the character
of Hamlet, shake his fist with all the demonstra∣tions
of wrath at his mistress, for no evident
cause, and behave like a ruffian to his own mo∣ther.
Shocked at such want of dignity and deco∣rum
in a prince, who seemed the favourite of the
people, I condemned the genius that produced
him, but, upon a second perusal of the play,
transferred my censure to the actor, who, in my
opinion, had egregiously mistaken the meaning
of the poet. At a ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture, when his whole soul
ought to be alarmed wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terror and amazement,
and all his attention engrossed by the dreadful
object in view, I mean that of his friend whom
he had murthered; he expresses no passion but
that of indignation against a drinking glass,
which he violently dashes in pieces on the floor,
as if he had perceived a spider in his wine; nay,
while his eyes are fixed upon the ground, he starts
at the image of a dagger which he pretends to see
above his head, as if the pavement was a looking∣glass
that represented it by reflexion: and at one
time, I saw him walk a-cross the stage, and lend
an inferior character a box on the ear, after he
had with great wrath pronounced “Take thou
that,” or some equivalent exclamation, at the
other end of the scene. He represents the grief
of an hero, by the tears and manner of a whin∣ing
<PB N="139" REF="148"/>
school boy, and perverts the genteel deport∣ment
of a gentleman, into the idle buffoonery of
a miserable tobacconist; his whole art is no other
than a succession of frantic vociferation, such as
I have heard in the cells of Bedlam, a slowness,
hesitation and oppression of speech, as if he was
troubled with an asthma, convulsive startings,
and a ductility of features, suited to the most ex∣travagant
transitions. In a word, he is blessed
with a distinct voice, and a great share of viva∣city;
but in point of feeling, judgment, and
grace, is, in my opinion, altogether defective.
Not to mention his impropriety in dress, which
is so absurd, that he acts the part of a youthful
prince, in the habit of an undertaker, and exhi∣bits
the gay, fashionable Lothario, in the appear∣ance
of a mountebank. I beg pardon for treating
this darling of the English with so little cere∣mony;
and to convince you of my candour,
frankly confess, that notwithstanding all I have
said, he is qualified to make a considerable figure
in the low characters of humour, which are so
much relished by a London audience, if he could
be prevailed upon to abate of that monstrous bur∣lesque,
which is an outrage against nature and
common sense. As for his competitor in same,
with an equal share of capacity, he is inferior to
him in personal agility, sprightliness and voice.
His utterance is a continual sing song, like the
chanting of vespers, and his action resembles that
of heaving ballast into the hold of a ship. In his
outward deportment, he seems to have confounded
the ideas of dignity and insolence of mien, acts
the crafty, cool, designing Crookback, as a loud,
shallow, blustering Hector; in the character of
the mild patriot Brutus, loses all temper and de∣corum;
<PB N="140" REF="149"/>
nay, so ridiculous is the behaviour of
him and Cassius at their interview, that setting
foot to foot, and grinning at each other, with
the aspect of two coblers enraged, they thrust
their left sides together, with repeated shocks,
that the hilts of their swords may clash for the
entertainment of the audience; as if they were a
couple of Merry Andrews, endeavouring to raise
the laugh of the vulgar, on some scaffold at Bar∣tholomew
Fair. The despair of a great man
who falls a sacrifice to the infernal practices
of a subtle traitor, that enjoyed his confi∣dence,
this English Aesopus represents, by beat∣ing
his own forehead, and bellowing like a b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll;
and indeed, in almost all his most interesting
scenes, performs such strange shakings of the
head, and other antic gesticulations, that when
I first saw him act, I imagined the poor man
laboured under that paralytical disorder, which
is known by the name of St. Vitus's dance.
In short, he seems to be a stranger to the more
refined sensations of the soul, consequently his
expression is of the vulgar kind, and he must
often sink under the idea of the poet; so that he
has recourse to such violence of affected agitation,
as imposes upon the undiscerning spectator, but
to the eye of taste, evinces him a meer player
of that class whom your admired Shakespear justly
compares to nature's journeymen tearing a passion
to rags. Yet this man, in spite of all these absur∣dities,
is an admirable Falstaff, exhibits the cha∣racter
of the eighth Henry to the life, is reason∣ably
applauded in the Plain Dealer, excels in the
part of Sir John Brute, and would be equal to
many humorous situations in low comedy, which
<PB N="141" REF="150"/>
his pride will not allow him to undertake. I
should not have been so severe upon these rivals,
had not I seen them extolled by their partizans,
with the most ridiculous and fulsome manifestation
of praise, even in those very circumstances
wherein (as I have observed) they chiefly failed.”</P>
<P>Pickle, not a little piqued to hear the quali∣fications
of the two most celebrated actors in
England treated with such freedom and disre∣spect,
answered with some asperity, that the che∣valier
was a true critick, more industrious in ob∣serving
the blemishes than in acknowledging the
excellence of those who fell under his examination.
It was not to be supposed that one actor could
shine equally in all characters; and though his
observations were undoubtedly very judicious, he
himself could not help wondering that some of
them had always escaped his notice, though he
had been an assiduous frequenter of the playhouse.
“The two players in question, said he, have,
in your own opinion, a considerable share of me∣rit
in the characters of comic life; and as to the
manners of the great personages in tragedy, and
the operation of the grand passions of the soul, I
apprehend, they may be variously represented,
according to the various complexion and culti∣vation
of different men. A Spaniard, for exam∣ple,
though impelled by the same passion, will
express it very differently from a Frenchman;
and what is looked upon as graceful vivacity and
address by the one, would be considered as im∣pertinence
and foppery by the other: nay, so op∣posite
is your common deportment from that of
some other nations, that one of your own coun∣trymen,
in the relation of his travels observes,
<PB N="142" REF="151"/>
that the Persians even of this age, when they see
any man perform unnecessary gestures, say he
is either a fool or a Frenchman. The standard
of demeanour being thus unsettled, a Turk, a
Moor, an Indian, or inhabitant of any country,
whose customs and dress are widely different from
ours, may in his sentiments, possess all the dignity
of the human heart, and be inspired by the no∣blest
passion that animates the soul, and yet ex∣cite
the laughter rather than the respect of an
European spectator.</P>
<P>When I first beheld your famous Parisian stage-heroine,
in one of her principal parts, her atti∣tudes
seemed so violent, and she tossed her arms
around with such extravagance, that she put me
in mind of a windmill under the agitation of a
hard gale; while her voice and features exhibited
the lively representation of an English scold. The
action of your favourite male-performer was, in
my opinion, equally unnatural; he appeared with
the affected airs of a dancing-master; at the most
pathetic junctures of his fate, he lifted up his
hands above his head, like a tumbler going to
vault, and spoke as if his throat had been ob∣structed
by an hair-brush; yet, when I compared
their manners with those of the people before
whom they performed, and made allowance for
that exaggeration which obtains on all theatres, I
was insensibly reconciled to their method of per∣formance,
and could distinguish abundance of me∣rit
beneath that oddity of appearance.”</P>
<P>The chevalier perceiving Peregrine a little irri∣tated
at what he had said, asked pardon for the
lib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> taken, in censuring the English
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that he had an infinite vene∣ration
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> learning, genius and taste,
<PB N="143" REF="152"/>
which were so justly distinguished in the world of
letters; and that notwithstanding the severity of
his criticism, he thought the theatre of London
much better supplied with actors than that of
Paris. The young gentleman thanked him for
his polite condescension, at which Pallet exulted,
saying with a shake of the head, “I believe so
too, Monsieur;” and the physician, impatient of
the dispute in which he had bore no share, ob∣served
with a supercilious air, that the modern
stage was altogether beneath the notice of one
who had an idea of ancient magnificence and
execution; that plays ought to be exhibited at
the expence of the state, as those of Sophocles
were by the Athenians; and that proper judges
should be appointed for receiving or rejecting all
such performances as are offered to the public.</P>
<P>He then described the theatre at Rome, which
contained eighty thousand spectators, gave them
a learned disquisition into the nature of the Per∣sona,
or mask, worn by the Roman actors, which,
he said, was a machine that covered the whole
head, furnished on the inside with a brazen con∣cavity,
that, by reverberating the sound as it is∣sued
from the mouth, raised the voice, so as to
render it audible to such an extended audience.
He explained the difference between the Saltator
and Declamator, one of whom acted, while the
other rehearsed the part; and from thence took
occasion to mention the perfection of their pan∣tomimes,
who were so amazingly distinct in the
exercise of their art, that a certain prince of
Pontus being at the court of Nero, and seei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
one of them represent a story, begged him of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
emperor, in order to employ him as an interpreter
among barbarous nations, whose language he did
<PB N="144" REF="153"/>
not understand. Nay, divers cynic philosophers,
who had condemned this entertainment unseen,
when they chanced to be eye-witnesses of their
admirable dexterity, expressed their sorrow for
having so long debarred themselves of such ra∣tional
enjoyment.</P>
<P>He dissented, however, from the opinion of
Peregrine, who, as a proof of their excellence,
had advanced, that some of the English actors
fancied themselves the very thing they represented,
and recounted a story from Lucian, of a certain
celebrated pantomime, who in acting the part of
Ajax in his frenzy, was transported into a real fit
of delirium, during which he tore to-pieces the
cloaths of that actor who stalked before him,
beating the stage with iron shoes, in order to in∣crease
the noise, snatched an instrument from
one of the musicians, and broke it over the head
of him who represented Ulysses; and running
to the consular bench, mistook a couple of se∣nators
for the sheep which were to be slain. The
audience applauded him to the skies; but so con∣scious
was the mimic of his own extravagance,
when he recovered the use of his reason, that he
actually fell sick with mortification; and being
afterwards desired to re-act the piece, flatly re∣fused
to appear in any such character, saying,
that the shortest follies were the best, and that it
was sufficient for him to have been a madman
once in his life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An adventure happens to Pipes, in consequence of
which he is dismissed from Peregrine's service.
The whole company set out for Ghent in the Di∣ligence.
Our hero is captivated by a lady in
that carriage; interests her spiritual director in
his behalf.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctor being fairly engaged on the sub∣ject
of the ancients, would have proceeded
the Lord knows how far, without hesitation, had
not he been interrupted by the arrival of Mr.
Jolter, who in great confusion told them, that
Pipes having affronted a soldier, was then sur∣rounded
in the street, and would certainly be put
to death, if some person of authority did not im∣mediately
interpose in his behalf.</P>
<P>Peregrine no sooner learn'd the danger of his
trusty squire, than snatching up his sword, he ran
down stairs, and was followed by the Chevalier,
intreating him to leave the affair to his manage∣ment.
Within ten yards of the door they found
Tom with his back to a wall, defending himself
manfully with a mopstick against the assault of
three or four soldiers, who at sight of the Maltese
cross desisted from the attack, and were taken
into custody by order of the knight. One of
the aggressors being an Irishman, begged to be
heard with great importunity, before he should
be sent to the guard; and by the mediation of
Pickle, was accordingly brought into the Hotel,
with his companions, all three bearing upon their
heads and faces evident marks of their adver∣sary’s
prowess and dexterity. The spokesman
<PB N="146" REF="155"/>
being confronted with Pipes, informed the com∣pany,
that having by accident met with Mr. Pipes,
whom he considered as his countryman, though
fortune had disposed of them in different services,
he invited him to drink a glass of wine; and ac∣cordingly
carried him to a Cabaret, where he in∣troduced
him to his comrades; but in the course
of the conversation, which turned upon the
power and greatness of the kings of France and
England, Mr. Pipes had been pleased to treat
his Most Christian Majesty with great disrespect;
and when he (the entertainer) expostulated with
him in a friendly manner about his impolite be∣haviour,
observing, that he being in the French
service, would be under the necessity of resenting
his abuse, if he did not put a stop to it before the
other gentlemen of the cloth should comprehend
his meaning, he had set them all three at de∣fiance,
dishonoured him in particular with the
opprobrious epithet of <HI>rebel to his native king and
country,</HI> and even drank (in broken French) to
the perdition of Lewis and all his adherents!
that compelled by this outragious conduct, he,
as the person who had recommended him to their
society, had, in vindication of his own character,
demanded satisfaction of the delinquent, who on
pretence of fetching a sword, had gone to his
lodging, from whence he all of a sudden sallied
upon them with the mopstick, which he em∣ployed
in the annoyance of them all without di∣stinction,
so that they were obliged to draw in
their own defence.</P>
<P>Pipes being questioned by his master, with re∣gard
to the truth of this account, owned that
every circumstance was justly represented; say∣ing,
he did not value their cheese-toasters a pinch
<PB N="147" REF="156"/>
of oakum; and that if the gentlemen had not
shot in betwixt them, he would have trimmed
them to such a tune, that they should not have
had a whole yard to square. Peregrine repri∣manded
him sharply for his unmannerly beha∣viour,
and insisted upon his asking pardon of those
he had injured, upon the spot. But no conside∣ration
was efficacious enough to produce such con∣cession;
to this command he was both deaf and
dumb, and the repeated threats of his master had
no more effect than if they had been addressed
to a marble statue. At length, our hero incensed
at his obstinacy, started up, and would have
chastised him with manual operation, had not he
been prevented by the Chevalier, who found
means to moderate his indignation so far, that he
contented himself with dismissing the offender
from his service; and after having obtained the
discharge of the prisoners, gave them a Louis to
drink, by way of recompence for the disgrace and
damage they had sustained.</P>
<P>The Knight perceiving our young gentleman
very much ruffled at this accident, and reflecting
upon the extraordinary deportment and appear∣ance
of his valet, whose hair had by this time
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dopted a grizzled hue, imagined he was some
favourite domestic, who had grown grey in the
service of his master's family, and that, of con∣sequence,
he was uneasy at the sacrifice he had
made. Swayed by this conjecture, he earnestly
sollicited in his behalf; but all he could obtain,
was a promise of re-admitting him into favour on
the terms already proposed, or at least on condi∣tion
that he should make his acknowledgment to
the Chevalier, for his want of reverence and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t
for the French monarch.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="157"/>
Upon this condescension, the culprit was called
up stairs, and made acquainted with the mitiga∣tion
of his fate; upon which he said, he would
down on his marrow-bones to his own master,
but would be damn'd before he would ask pardon
of e'er a Frenchman in Christendom. Pickle,
exasperated at this blunt declaration, ordered him
out of his presence, and charged him never to ap∣pear
before his face again; while the officer in
vain employed all his influence and address to ap∣pease
his resentment, and about midnight took
his leave, with marks of mortification at his want
of success.</P>
<P>Next day the company agreed to travel through
Flanders in the Diligence, by the advice of Pe∣regrine,
who was not without hope of meeting
with some adventure or amusement in that car∣riage;
and Jolter took care to secure places for
them all, it being resolved that the valet de
chambre and the doctor's man should attend the
vehicle on horseback; and as for the forlorn
Pipes, he was left to reap the fruits of his own
stubborn disposition, notwithstanding the united
efforts of the whole triumvirate, who endea∣voured
to procure his pardon.</P>
<P>Every previous measure being thus taken, they
set out from Lisle about six in the morning, and
found themselves in the company of a female ad∣venturer,
a very handsome young lady, a Capuchin,
and a Rotterdam Jew. Our young gentleman
being the first of this society that entered, sur∣veyed
the strangers with an attentive eye, and
seated himself immediately behind the beautiful
unknown, who at once attracted his attention.
Pallet seeing another lady uninengaged, in imita∣tion
of his friend, took possession of her neigh∣bourhood;
<PB N="149" REF="158"/>
the physician paired with the priest,
and Jolter sat down by the Jew.</P>
<P>The machine had not proceeded many fur∣longs,
when Pickle accosting the fair incognita,
congratulated himself upon his happiness, in be∣ing
the fellow-traveller of so charming a lady.
She, without the least reserve or affectation,
thanked him for his compliment, and replied with
a sprightly air, that now they were embarked in
one common bottom, they must club their en∣deavours
to make one another as happy as the
nature of their situation would permit them to
be. Encouraged by this frank intimation, and
captivated by her fine black eyes and easy beha∣viour,
he attached himself to her from that mo∣ment;
and in a little time the conversation be∣came
so particular, that the Capuchin thought
proper to interfere in the discourse, in such a
manner as gave the youth to understand, that
he was there on purpose to superintend her con∣duct.
He was doubly rejoiced at this discovery,
in consequence of which he hoped to profit in his
addresses, not only by the young lady's restraint,
that never fails to operate in behalf of the lover,
but also by the corruptibility of her guardian,
whom he did not doubt of rendering propitious
to his cause. Flushed with these expectations,
he behaved with uncommon complacency to the
father, who was charmed with the affability of
his carriage, and on the faith of his generosity
abated of his vigilance so much, that our hero
carried on his suit without further molestation;
while the painter, in signs and loud bursts of
laughter, conversed with his Dulcinea, who was
perfectly well versed in these simple expressions
<PB N="150" REF="159"/>
of satisfaction, and had already found means to
make a dangerous invasion upon his heart.</P>
<P>Nor were the governor and physician unem∣ployed,
while their friends interested themselves
in this agreeable manner. Jolter no sooner per∣ceived
the Hollander was a Jew, than he entered
into an investigation of the Hebrew tongue, in
which he was a connoisseur; and the doctor at
the same time attacked the Mendicant on the ri∣diculous
maxims of his order, together with the
impositions of priest-craft in general, which (he
observed) prevail so much among those who pro∣fess
the Roman Catholic religion.</P>
<P>Thus coupled, each committee enjoyed their
own conversation apart, without any danger of
encroachment; and all were so intent upon their
several topics, that they scarce allowed them∣selves
a small interval in viewing the desolation of
Menin, as they passed through that ruined fron∣tier.
About twelve o'clock they arrived at Cour∣tray,
where the horses are always changed, and
the company halt an hour for refreshment. Here
Peregrine handed his charmer into an apartment,
where she was joined by the other lady; and on
pretence of seeing some of the churches in town,
put himself under the direction of the Capuchin,
from whom he learn'd, that the young lady was
wife to a French gentleman, to whom she had
been married about a year, and that she was now
on her journey to visit her mother, who lived in
Brussels, and who at that time laboured under a
lingering distemper, which, in all probability,
would soon put a period to her life. He then
launched out in praise of her daughter's virtue
and conjugal affection; and lastly told him, that
he was her father confessor, and pitched upon to
<PB N="151" REF="160"/>
be her conductor through Flanders, by her hus∣band,
who, as well as his wife, placed the ut∣most
confidence in his prudence and integrity.</P>
<P>Pickle easily comprehended the meaning of
this insinuation, and took the hint accordingly.
He tickled the priest's vanity with extraordinary
encomiums upon the disinterested principles of his
order, which were detached from all worldly pur∣suits,
and altogether devoted to the eternal sal∣vation
of mankind. He applauded their patience,
humility and learning, and lavished a world of
praise upon their talent in preaching, which (he
said) had more than once operated so powerfully
upon him, that had he not been restrained by
certain considerations which he could not possibly
wave, he should have embraced their tenets, and
begg'd admission into their fraternity; but, as the
circumstances of his fate would not permit him
to take such a salutary measure for the present,
he intreated the good father to accept a small to∣ken
of his love and respect, for the benefit of
that convent to which he belonged. So saying,
he pulled out a purse of ten guineas, which the
Capuchin observing, turned his head another way,
and lifting up his arm, displayed a pocket almost
as high as his collar-bone, in which he deposited
the money.</P>
<P>This proof of affection for the order produced
a sudden and surprising effect upon the friar. In
the transport of his zeal he wrung this semi-con∣vert's
hand, showered a thousand benedictions
upon his head, and exhorted him, with the tears
flowing from his eyes, to perfect the great work
which the finger of God had begun in his heart;
and as an instance of his concern for the welfare
of his precious soul, the holy brother promised to
<PB N="152" REF="161"/>
recommend him strenuously to the pious admoni∣tions
of the young woman under his care, who
was a perfect saint upon earth, and endued with
the peculiar gift▪ of mollifying the hearts of ob∣durate
sinners. “O father! (cried the hypocri∣tical
projector, who by this time perceived that
his money was not thrown away) if I could be
favoured but for one half hour with the private
instructions of that inspired devotee, my mind
presages, that I should be a stray'd sheep brought
back into the sold, and that I should find easy en∣trance
at the gates of heaven! There is some∣thing
supernatural in her aspect; I gaze upon her
with the most pious servor, and my whole soul
is agitated with tumults of hope and despair!”
Having pronounced this rhapsody with transport
half natural and half affected, the priest assured
him, that these were operations of the spirit,
which must not be repressed; and comforted him
with the hope of enjoying the blessed interview
which he desired, protesting, that as far as his
influence extended, his wish should be that very
evening indulged. The gracious pupil thanked
him for his benevolent concern, which he swore
should not be squandered upon an ungrateful ob∣ject;
and the rest of the company interrupting
the conversation, they returned in a body to the
inn, where they dined all together; and the ladies
were persuaded to be our hero's guests.</P>
<P>As the subjects on which they had been en∣gaged
before dinner were not exhausted, each
brace resumed their former theme, when they
were replaced in the Diligence. The painter's
mistress finished her conquest, by exerting her
skill in the art of ogling, accompanied by fre∣quent
bewitching sighs, and some tender French
<PB N="153" REF="162"/>
songs that she sung with such pathetic expres∣sion,
as quite melted the resolution of Pallet, and
utterly subdued his affection: and he, to convince
her of the importance of her victory, gave a spe∣cimen
of his own talents, by entertaining her
with that celebrated English ditty, the burthen
of which begins with, <HI>The pigs they lie with their
arses bare.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He makes some progress in her affections; is in∣terrupted

for him an interview with his fair en∣slaver,
in which he finds himself deceived.</HEAD>
<P>PEregrine, mean while, employed all his in∣sinuation
and address in practising upon the
heart of the Capuchin's fair charge. He had long
ago declared his passion, not in the superficial
manner of a French gallant, but with all the
ardor of an enthusiast. He had languished, vow'd,
flattered, kiss'd her hand by stealth, and had no
reason to complain of his reception. Though
by a man of a less sanguine disposition, her par∣ticular
complaisance would have been deemed
equivocal, and perhaps nothing more than the ef∣fect
of French breeding and constitutional vi∣vacity;
he gave his own qualifications credit for
the whole, and with these sentiments carried on
the attack with such unabating vigour, that she
was actually prevailed upon to accept a ring,
which he presented as a token of his esteem; and
every thing proceeded in a most prosperous train,
when they were disturbed by the governor and
<PB N="154" REF="163"/>
Israelite, who in the heat of disputation raised
their voices, and poured forth such effusions of
gutturals, as set our lover's teeth on edge. As
they spoke in a language unknown to every one
in the carriage but themselves, and looked at
each other with mutual animosity and rancour,
Peregrine desired to know the cause of their con∣tention.
Upon which, Jolter exclaimed in a fu∣rious
tone, “This learned Levite, forsooth, has
the impudence to tell me, that I don't understand
Hebrew; and affirms, that the word <HI>Benoni</HI> sig∣nifies
<HI>child of joy;</HI> whereas I can prove, and in∣deed
have already said enough to convince any
reasonable man, that in the Septuagint it is rightly
translated into <HI>son of my sorrow.</HI> Having thus
explained himself to his pupil, he turned to the
priest, with intention to appeal to his determina∣tion;
but the Jew pulled him by the sleeve with
great eagerness, saying, “For the love of God
be quiet, the Capuchin will discover who we are!”
Jolter, offended at this conjunction, ecchoed
“Who we are!” with great emphasis; and re∣peating
<HI>nos poma natamus,</HI> asked ironically, to
which of the Tribes the Jew thought he belonged?
The Levite, affronted at his comparing him to a
ball of horse-dung, replied with a most signifi∣cant
grin, “To the tribe of Issachar.” And
his antagonist, taking the advantage of his un∣willingness
to be known by the friar, and prompted
by revenge for the freedom he had used, an∣swered
in the French language, that the judg∣ment
of God was still manifest upon their whole
race, not only in their being in the state of exiles
from their native land, but also in the spite of
their hearts and pravity of their dispositions,
which demonstrate them to be the genuine off∣spring
<PB N="155" REF="164"/>
of those who crucified the Saviour of the
world.</P>
<P>His expectation was, however, defeated; the
priest himself was too deeply engaged, to attend
to the debates of other people. The physician,
in the pride and insolence of his learning, had
undertaken to display the absurdity of the Chri∣stian
faith; having already (as he thought) con∣futed
the Capuchin, touching the points of belief
in which the Roman Catholics differ from the rest
of the world. But, not contented with the ima∣gined
victory he had gained, he began to strike
at the fundamentals of religion; and the father,
with incredible forbearance, suffered him to make
very free with the doctrine of the Trinity: but,
when he levelled the shafts of his ridicule at the
immaculate conception of the Blessed Virgin, the
good man's patience forsook him, his eyes seemed
to kindle with indignation, he trembled in every
joint, and uttered with a loud voice, “You are
an abominable—I will not call thee heretic,
for thou art worse (if possible) than a Jew; you
deserve to be inclosed in a furnace seven times
heated, and I have a good mind to lodge an in∣formation
against you with the governor of
Ghent, that you may be apprehended and pu∣nished
as an impious blasphemer.”</P>
<P>This menace operated like a charm upon all
present. The doctor was confounded, the go∣vernor
dismayed, the Levite's teeth chattered,
the painter was astonished at the general confu∣sion,
the cause of which he could not compre∣hend;
and Pickle himself, not a little alarmed,
was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to use all his interest and assiduity
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appeasing this son of the church, who at
length, in consideration of the friendship he pro∣fessed
<PB N="156" REF="165"/>
for the young gentleman, consented to for∣give
what had passed, but absolutely refused to fit
in contact with such a profane wretch, whom he
looked upon as a fiend of darkness, sent by the
enemy of mankind to poison the minds of weak
people; so that, after having crossed himself,
and muttered certain exorcisms, he insisted upon
the doctor's changing places with the Jew, who
approached the offended ecclesiastic in an agony
of fear.</P>
<P>Matters being thus compromised, the conver∣sation
flowed in a more general channel; and
without the intervention of any other accident,
or bone of contention, the carriage arrived at the
city of Ghent about seven in the evening; and
supper being bespoke for the whole company, our
adventurer and his friends went out to take a su∣perficial
view of the place, leaving his new mi∣stress
to the pious exhortations of her confessor,
whom (as we have already observed) he had se∣cured
in his interest. This zealous mediator
spoke so warmly in his commendation, and in∣terested
her conscience so much in the affair, that
she could not refuse her helping hand to the great
work of his conversion, and promised to grant
the interview he desired.</P>
<P>This agreeable piece of intelligence, which
the Capuchin communicated to Peregrine at his
return, elevated his spirits to such a degree, that
he shone at supper with uncommon brilliance, in
a thousand sallies of wit and pleasantry, to the
admiration and delight of all present, especially
of his fair Fleming, who seemed quite captivated
by his person and behaviour.</P>
<P>The evening being thus spent to the satisfac∣tion
of all parties, the company broke up, and
<PB N="157" REF="166"/>
retired to their several apartments, when our lover,
to his unspeakable mortification, learnt that the
two ladies were obliged to lie in the same room,
all the other chambers of the inn being preoccu∣pied.
When he imparted this difficulty to the priest,
that charitable father, who was very fruitful in
expedients, assured him, that his spiritual con∣cerns
should not be obstructed by such a slender
impediment; and accordingly availed himself of
his prerogative, by going into his daughter's
chamber when she was almost undressed, and
leading her into his own, on pretence of admi∣nistring
salutary food for her soul. Having
brought the two votaries together, he prayed for
success to the operations of grace, and left them
to their mutual meditations, after having conjured
them in the most solemn manner to let no im∣pure
sentiments, or temptations of the flesh, in∣terfere
with the hallowed design of their meeting.</P>
<P>The reverend intercessor being gone, and the
door fastened on the inside, the pseudo-convert,
transported with his passion, threw himself at his
Amanda's feet; and begging she would spare him
the tedious form of addresses, which the nature
of their interview would not permit him to ob∣serve,
began with all the impetuosity of love to
profit by the occasion. But, whether she was
displeased at the intrepidity and assurance of his
behaviour, thinking herself intitled to more court∣ship
and respect, or was really better fortified
with chastity than he or his procurer had sup∣posed
her to be; certain it is, she expressed re∣sentment
and surprize at his boldness and pre∣sumption,
and upbraided him with having im∣posed
upon the charity of the friar. The young
gentleman was really as much astonished at this
<PB N="158" REF="167"/>
rebuff, as she pretended to be at his declaration,
and earnestly intreated her to consider how pre∣cious
the moments were, and for once sacrifice
superfluous ceremony, to the happiness of one
who adored her with such a flame, as could not
fail to consume his vitals, if she would not deign
to bless him with her favour. Yet, notwithstand∣ing
all his tears, vows and supplications, his per∣sonal
accomplishments and the tempting oppor∣tunity,
all that he could obtain, was an acknow∣ledgment
of his having made an impression upon
her heart, which she hoped the dictates of her
duty would enable her to erase. This confession
he considered as a delicate consent; and obeying
the impulse of his love, snatched her up in his
arms, with intention of seizing that which she
declined to give; when this French Lucretia,
unable to defend her virtue any other way,
screamed aloud; and the Capuchin, setting his
shoulder to the door, burst it open, and entered
in an affected extasy of amazement. He lifted
up his hands and eyes, and pretended to be thun∣derstruck
at the discovery he had made; then, in
broken exclamations, professed his horror at the
wicked intention of our hero, who had covered
such a damnable scheme with the mask of religion.
In short, he performed his cue with such dexte∣rity,
that the lady believing him in earnest,
begg'd he would forgive the stranger, on account
of his youth and education, which had been tainted
by the errors of heresy; and he was on these
considerations content to accept the submission of
our hero, who, far from renouncing his expec∣tations,
notwithstanding this mortifying repulse,
confided so much in his own talents, and the con∣fession
which his mistress had made, that he re∣solved
<PB N="159" REF="168"/>
to make another effort, to which nothing
could have prompted him but the utmost turbu∣lence
of unruly desire.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He makes another effort towards the accomplishment
of his wish, which is postponed by a strange ac∣cident.</HEAD>
<P>HE directed his valet de chambre, who was
a thorough-paced pimp, to kindle some
straw in the yard, and then pass by the door of
her apartment, crying with a loud voice that the
house was on fire. This alarm brought both la∣dies
out of their chamber in a moment, and Pe∣regrine
taking the advantage of their running to
the street door, entered the room and concealed
himself under a large table that stood in an unob∣served
corner. The nymphs, as soon as they
understood the cause of his Mercury's supposed
affright, returned to their apartment, and having
said their prayers, undressed themselves and went
to bed. This scene, which fell under the obser∣vation
of Pickle, did not at all contribute to the
cooling of his concupiscence, but on the contrary,
inflamed him to such a degree, that he could
scarce restrain his impatience, until by her snor∣ing,
he concluded the fellow-lodger of his Amanda
was asleep. This welcome note no sooner sa∣lu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
his ears, than he crept to his charmer's bed∣side,
and placing himself on his knees, gently laid
hold on her white hand, and pressed it to his lips.
She had just begun to close her eyes, and enjoy
the agreeable oppression of slumber, when she
was roused by this rape, at which she started,
<PB N="160" REF="169"/>
pronouncing in a tone of surprize and dismay,
“My God! who's that?” The lover, with the
most insinuating humility, besought her to hear
him; vowing that his intention in approaching
her thus, was not to violate the laws of decency,
or that indelible esteem which she had engraven
on his heart; but to manifest his sorrow and
contrition for the umbrage he had given, to pour
forth the overflowings of his soul, and tell her
that he neither could nor would survive her dis∣pleasure.
These and many more pathetic pro∣testations,
accompanied with sighs and tears, and
other expressions of genuine grief, which our
hero had at command, could not fail to melt the
tender heart of the amiable Fleming, already pre∣possessed
in favour of his qualifications. She sym∣pathized
so much with his affliction, as to weep
in her turn, when she represented the impossibi∣lity
of her rewarding his passion; and he seizing
the favourable moment, reinforced his sollicita∣tions
with such irresistible transports, that her re∣solution
gave way, she began to breathe quick and
deep, expressed her fear of being overheard by
the other lady, and with an ejaculation of “O
heavens! I'm undone:” suffered herself, after a
faint struggle, to be overpowered by her admirer,
who made a lodgment upon the covered way of
her bed, under the curtain of the counterscarp;
and in all probability, would have in a few mo∣ments
made himself master of the place; when
her honour was secured for the present, by a
strange sort of knocking upon the wainscot, at
the other end of the room, hard by the bed in
which the female adventurer lay. Surprised at
this circumstance which interrupted our assailant's
operations, the lady begged him for heaven's sake to
<PB N="161" REF="170"/>
retreat, else her reputation would be ruined for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver: but when he represented to her, that her
character would run a much greater risk, if he
should be detected in withdrawing, she consented
with great trepidation to his stay, and they listened
in silence to the sequel of the noise that alarmed
them. This was no other than an expedient of
the painter, to awaken his Dulcinea, with whom
he had made an assignation, or at least inter∣changed
such signals as he thought amounted to a
firm appointment. His nymph being disturbed
in her first sleep, immediately understood the
sound, and true to the agreement, rose, and un∣bolting
the door as softly as possible, gave him
admittance, leaving it open for his more commo∣dious
retreat.</P>
<P>While this happy gallant was employed in dis∣engaging
himself from the dishabille in which he
had entered, the Capuchin suspecting that Pere∣grine
would make another attempt upon his
charge, had crept silently to the apartment, in
order to reconnoitre, lest the adventure should be
atchieved without his knowledge; a circumstance
that would deprive him of the profits he might
expect from his privity and concurrence. Finding
the door unlatched, his suspicion was confirmed,
and he made no scruple of creeping into the
chamber on all-four; so that the painter having
stript himself to the shirt, in groping about for
his Dulcinea's bed, chanced to lay his hand upon
the shaven crown of the father's head, which by
a circular motion, the priest began to turn round
in his grasp, like a ball in a socket, to the sur∣prize
and consternation of poor Pallet, who hav∣ing
neither penetration to comprehend the case,
nor resolution to withdraw his fingers from this
<PB N="162" REF="171"/>
strange object of his touch, stood sweating in the
dark, and vented ejaculations with great devotion,
till the friar tired with this exercise, and the pain∣ful
posture in which he stooped, raised himself
gradually upon his feet, heaving up at the same
time the hand of the painter, whose terror and
amazement increased to such a degree at this un∣accountable
elevation, that his faculties began to
fail; and his palm in the confusion of his fright
sliding over the priest's forehead, one of his fin∣gers
happened to slip into his mouth, and was
immediately secured between the Capuchin's teeth,
with as firm a fixure, as if it had been screwed in
a blacksmith's vice. The painter was so much
disordered by this sudden snap, which tortured him
to the bone, that forgetting all other considera∣tions,
he roared aloud, “Murder! fire! a trap,
a trap! help, christians, for the love of God help!”
Our hero confounded by these exclamations,
which he knew would soon fill the room with
spectators, and incensed at his own mortifying
disappointment, was obliged to quit the untasted
banquet, and approaching the cause of his mis∣fortune,
just as his tormentor had thought proper
to release his finger, discharged such a hearty slap
between his shoulders, as brought him to the
ground with hideous bellowing, then retiring un∣perceived,
to his own chamber, was one of the
first who returned with a light, on pretence of
having been alarmed with his cries. The Ca∣puchin
had taken the same precaution, and fol∣lowed
Peregrine into the room, pronouncing <HI>Be∣nedicite,</HI>
and crossing himself with many marks
of astonishment; and the physician and Jolter
appearing at the same time, the unfortunate
painter was found lying naked on the floor, in
<PB N="163" REF="172"/>
all the agony of horror and dismay, blowing up∣on
his left hand, that hung dangling from the el∣bow,
like a boy who had burnt his fingers, in
attempting to snatch roasted chesnuts from the
fire. The circumstance of his being found in
that apartment, and the attitude of his affliction,
which was extremely ridiculous, provoked the
doctor to a smile, and produced a small relaxa∣tion
in the severity of the governor's counte∣nance;
while Pickle, testifying surprize and con∣cern,
lifted him from the ground, and enquired
into the cause of his present situation. Having,
after some recollection, and fruitless endeavours
to speak, recovered the use of his tongue, he
told them that the house was certainly haunted
by evil spirits, by which he had been conveyed
(he knew not how) into that apartment, and
afflicted with all the tortures of hell; that one
of them had made itself sensible to his feeling, in
the shape of a round ball of smooth flesh, that
turned round under his hand, like an astrono∣mer's
globe, and then rising up to a surprising
height, was converted into a machine that laid
hold on his finger, by a snap, and having pinned
him to the spot, he continued for some moments
in unspeakable agony, till at last the engine seem∣ed
to melt away from his finger, and he received
a sudden thwack upon his shoulders, as if dis∣charged
by the arm of a giant, which overthrew
him in an instant upon the floor. The priest
hearing this strange account, pulled out of one
of his pouches a piece of consecrated candle,
which he lighted immediately, and muttered cer∣tain
mysterious conjurations. Jolter, imagining
that Pallet was drunk, shook his head, saying,
he believed the spirit was no where but in his
<PB N="164" REF="173"/>
own brain. The physician, for o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, conde∣scended
to be a wag, and looking towards one of
the beds, observed, that in his opinion, the
painter had been misled by the flesh, and not by
the spirit. The fair Fleming lay in silent asto∣nishment
and affright; and her fellow-lodger, in
order to acquit herself of all suspicion, exclaimed
with incredible volubility, against the author of
this uproar, who (she did not doubt) had con∣cealed
himself in the apartment, with a view of
perpetrating some wicked attempt upon her pre∣cious
virtue, and was punished and prevented by
the immediate interposition of heaven. At her de∣sire,
therefore, and the earnest sollicitation of the
other lady, he was conducted to his own bed,
and the chamber being evacuated, they locked
their door, fully resolved to admit no more visi∣tants
for that night: while Peregrine, mad with
seeing the delicious morsel, snatched (as it were)
from his very lip, stalked through the passage,
like a ghost, in hopes of finding some opportu∣nity
of re-entering, till the day beginning to
break, he was obliged to retire, cursing the ideo∣tical
conduct of the painter, which had so un∣luckily
interfered with his delight.</P>

political dispute with his mistress, whom he of∣fends,
and pacifies with submission. He prac∣tises
an expedient to detain the carriage at Alost,
and confirms the priest in his interest.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT day, about one o'clock, after hav∣ing
seen every thing remarkable in town,
and been present at the execution of two youths,
who were hanged for ravishing a whore, they
took their departure from Ghent, in the same
carriage which had brought them thither; and
the conversation turning upon the punishment
they had seen inflicted, the Flemish beauty ex∣pressed
great sympathy and compassion for the
unhappy sufferers, who (as she had been inform∣ed)
had fallen victims to the malice of the accu∣ser.
Her sentiments were espoused by all the
company, except the French lady of pleasure,
who, thinking the credit of the sisterhood con∣cerned
in the affair, bitterly inveighed against
the profligacy of the age, and particularly the
base and villainous attempts of man, upon the
chastity of the weaker sex; saying, with a look
of indignation directed to the painter, that for
her own part, she should never be able to mani∣fest
the acknowledgment she owed to providence,
for having protected her, last night, from the
wicked aims of unbridled lust. This observation
introduced a series of jokes, at the expence of
Pallet, who hung his ears, and sat with a silent
air of dejection, fearing that through the male∣volence
of the physician, his adventure might
<PB N="166" REF="175"/>
reach the ears of his wife. Indeed, though we
have made shift to explain the whole transaction
to the reader, it was an inextricable mystery to
every individual in the diligence; because the
part which was acted by the Capuchin, was
known to himself alone; and even he was ut∣terly
ignorant of Pickle's being concerned in the
affair; so that the greatest share of the painter's
sufferings were supposed to be the exaggerations
of his own extravagant imagination.</P>
<P>In the midst of their discourse on this extraor∣dinary
subject, the driver told them, that they
were now on the very spot where a detachment
of the allied army had been intercepted and cut
off by the French; and stopping the vehicle, en∣tertained
them with a local description of the
battle of Melle. Upon this occasion, the Flemish
lady, who since her marriage had become a keen
partizan for the French, gave a minute detail of
all the circumstances, as they had been repre∣sented
to her by her husband's brother, who was
in the action; and this account, which sunk the
number of the French to sixteen, and raised that
of the allies to twenty thousand men, was so dis∣agreeable
to truth, as well as to the laudable
partiality of Peregrine, that he ventured to con∣tradict
her assertions, and a fierce dispute com∣menced,
that not only regarded the present que∣stion,
but also comprehended all the battles in
which the duke of Marlborough had commanded
against Lewis the fourteenth. In the course of
these debates, she divested that great general of
all the glory he had acquired, by affirming, that
every victory he gained, was purposely lost by
the French generals, in order to bring the schemes
of madam de Maintenon into discredit; and as a
<PB N="167" REF="176"/>
particular instance, alledged that while the citadel
of Lisle was besieged, Lewis said, in presence of
the Dauphin, that if the allies should be obliged to
raise the siege, he would immediately declare his
marriage with that lady; upon which, the son
sent private orders to marshal Boufflers to surren∣der
the place. This strange allegation was sup∣ported
by the asseverations of the priest and the
courtezan, and admitted as truth by the gover∣nor,
who pretended to have heard it from good
authority: while the doctor sat neutral, as one
who thought it scandalous to know the history of
such modern events; and the Israelite, being a
true Dutchman, listed himself under the banners
of our hero, who in attempting to demonstrate
the absurdity and improbability of what they had
advanced, raised such a hue and cry against him∣self,
and being insensibly heated in the alterca∣tion,
irritated his Amanda to such a degree, that
her charming eyes kindled with fury, and he saw
great reason to think, that if he did not fall upon
some method to deprecate her wrath, she would
in a twinkling sacrifice all her esteem for him,
to her own zeal for the glory of the French na∣tion.
Swayed by this apprehension, his ardour
cooled by degrees, and he insensibly detached
himself from the argument, leaving the whole
care of supporting it on the Jew, who finding
himself deserted, was fain to yeild at discretion;
so that the French remained masters of the field,
and their young heroine resumed her good hu∣mour.
And let the circumstances of this conten∣tion
warn the reader, against all disputes with fe∣male
politicians; unless he is desirous of incur∣ing
their animosity and implacable resentment;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in matters of state, they are all, to a wo∣man,
<PB N="168" REF="177"/>
enthusiasts, who believe that all those who
differ from them in opinion, are in a state of re∣probation;
and, far from laying any stress upon
probability, in the articles of their faith, like be∣lievers
of another class, disdainfully reject the
evidence of reason, and trust to the revelation of
their own fancy.</P>
<P>Our hero having therefore prudently submit∣ed
to the superior intelligence of his fair en∣slaver,
began to be harrassed with the fears of
losing her for ever, upon their arrival at Brussels,
and set his invention at work, to contrive some
means of indemnifying himself for his assiduities,
presents, and the disappointment he had already
undergone, before they should reach that city:
on pretence of enjoying a freer air, he mounted
the box, and employed his elocution and gene∣rosity
with such success, that the driver under∣took
to disable the Diligence from proceeding
beyond the town of Alost for that day; and in
consequence of his promise, gently overturned it,
when they were about a mile short of that bait∣ing
place. He had taken his measures so dis∣creetly,
that this accident was attended with no
other inconvenience than a fit of fear, that took
possession of the ladies, and the necessity to which
they were reduced, by the declaration of the
coachman, who, upon examining the carriage,
assured the company that the axle-tree had given
way, and advised them to walk forward to the
inn, while he would jog after them at a slow
pace, and do his endeavour that the damage
should be immediately repaired. Peregrine pre∣tended
to be very much concerned at what had
happened, and even cursed the driver for his in∣advertency,
expressing infinite impatience to be
<PB N="169" REF="178"/>
at Brussels, and wishing that this misfortune
might not detain them another night upon the
road; but when his understapper, according to
his instructions, came afterwards to the inn, and
gave them to understand, that the workman he
had employed, could not possibly refit the ma∣chine
in less than six hours, the crafty youth af∣fected
to lose all temper, stormed at his emis∣sary,
whom he reviled in the most opprobious
terms, and threatened to cane for his misconduct.
The fellow protested, with great humility, that
their being overturned was owing to the failure
of the axle-tree, and not to his want of care or
dexterity in driving; though rather than be
thought the cause of incommoding him, he would
inquire for a post-chaise, in which he might de∣part
for Brussels immediately. This expedient
Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kle rejected, unless the whole company could
be accommodated in the same manner; and he
had been previously informed by the driver, that
the town could not furnish more than one ve∣hicle
of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. His governor, who was quite
ign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rant of his scheme, represented that one
night would soon be passed, and exhorted him to
bear this small disappointment with a good grace,
especially as the house seemed to be well pro∣vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed
for their entertainment, and the company
so much disposed to be sociable. The Capuchin,
who had found his account in cultivating the ac∣quaintance
of the young stranger, was not ill-pleased
at this event, which might, by protract∣ing
the term of their intercourse, yield him some
opportunity of profiting still further by his libe∣ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty:
he therefore joined Mr. Jolter in his ad∣monitions,
congratulating himself upon the pro∣ject
of enjoying his conversation a little longer
<PB N="170" REF="179"/>
than he had expected; and our young gentleman
received a compliment to the same purpose from
the Hebrew, who had that day exercised his gal∣lantry
upon the French coquette, and was not
without hope of reaping the fruits of his atten∣tion,
his rival, the painter, being quite disgraced
and dejected by the adventure of last night. As
for the doctor, he was too much engrossed in the
contemplation of his own importance, to interest
himself in the affair, or its consequences, further
than by observing, that the European powers
ought to establish public games, like those that
were celebrated of old in Greece; in which case,
every state would be supplied with such dextrous
charioteers, as could drive a machine at full
speed, within a hair's breadth of a precipice, with∣out
any danger of its being overthrown. Peregrine
could not help yielding to their remonstrances,
and united complaisance, for which he thanked
them in very polite terms, and his passion seem∣ing
to subside, proposed that they should amuse
themselves in walking round the ramparts, with
a view of enjoying some private conversation
with his admired Fleming, who had this whole
day behaved with remarkable reserve. The
proposal being embraced, he (as usual) handed
her into the street, and took all opportunities of
promoting his suit; but they were attended so
closely by her father confessor, that he foresaw it
would be impracticable to accomplish his aim,
without the connivance of that ecclesiastick,
which he was obliged to purchase with another
purse, that he offered, and was accepted as a
charitable atonement for his criminal behaviour
during the interview which the friar had pro∣cured
for the good of his soul. This benefaction
<PB N="171" REF="180"/>
was no sooner made, than the pious mendicant
edged off by little and little, till he joined the
rest of the company, leaving his generous patron
at full liberty to prosecute his purpose. It is not
to be doubted that our adventurer made a good
use of this occasion: he practised a thousand
flowers of rhetoric, and actually exhausted his
whole address, in persuading her to have com∣passion
upon his misery, and indulge him with
another private audience, without which he
should run distracted, and be guilty of extrava∣gancies,
which, in the humanity of her disposi∣tion,
she would weep to see. But, instead of
complying with his request, she chid him severely
for his presumption, in persecuting her with his
vicious addresses; and assured him, that although
she had secured a chamber for herself in this
place, because she had no ambition to be better
acquainted with the other lady, he would be in
the wrong to disturb her with another nocturnal
visit; for she was determined to deny him ad∣mittance.
The lover was comforted by this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>int, which he understood in the true accepta∣tion,
and his passion being inflamed by the obsta∣cles
he had met with in this intrigue, his heart
beat high with the prospect of possession. These
raptures of expectation produced an inquietude,
which disabled him from bearing that share of
the conversation for which he used to be distin∣guished.
His behaviour at supper was a vicissi∣tude
of startings, and reveries; and the Capu∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an
imputing this disorder to a second repulse
from his charge, began to be invaded with the
apprehension of being obliged to refund, and in
a whisper forbad our hero to despair.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The French coquet entraps the heart of the Jew,

<P>MEan while the French syren, baulked in
her design upon her English cully, who
was so easily disheartened, and hung his ears in
manifest despondence, rather than run the risque
of making a voyage that should be altogether un∣profitable,
resolved to practise her charms upon
the Dutch merchant; and had already made such
innovation upon his heart, that he cultivated
her with peculiar complacency, gazed upon her
with a most libidinous stare, and unbended his
aspect into a grin that was truly Israelitish. The
painter saw, and was offended at this correspon∣dence,
which he considered as an insult upon his
misfortune, as well as an evident preference of
his rival: and, conscious of his own timidity,
swallowed an extraordinary glass, that his inven∣tion
might be stimulated, and his resolution
raised to the contrivance and execution of some
scheme of revenge. The wine, however, failed
in the expected effect, and without inspiring him
with the plan, served only to quicken his desire
of vengeance; so that he communicated his pur∣pose
to his friend Peregrine, and begged the as∣sistance

was too intent upon his own affair, to
mind the concerns of any other person, and he
declining to be engaged in the project, Pallet had
recourse to the genius of Pickle's valet de cham∣bre,
<PB N="173" REF="182"/>
who readily embarked in the undertaking,
and invented a plan, which was executed accord∣ingly.</P>
<P>The evening being pretty far advanced, and
the company separated into their respective apart∣ments,
Pickle repaired, in all the impatience of
youth and desire, to the chamber of his charmer,
and finding the door unbolted, entered in a
transport of joy. By the light of the moon,
which shone through the window, he was con∣dected
to her bed, which he approached in the
utmost agitation, and perceiving her to all ap∣pearance
asleep, essayed to wake her with a
gentle kiss; but this method proved ineffectual,
because she was determined to save herself the
confusion of being an accomplice in his guilt.
He repeated the application, murmured a most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> salutation in her ear, and took such
other gentle methods of signifying his presence,
as persuaded him that she was resolved to sleep,
in spite of all his endeavours: flushed with this
agreeable supposition, he locked the door, in
order to prevent interruption, and stealing him∣self
un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the cloaths, set fortune at defiance,
while he held the fair creature circled in his
arms.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, near as he seemed to be to the
happy accomplishment of his desire, his hope
was again frustrated by a fearful noise, which in
a moment waked his Amanda in a fright, and
for the present engaged all his attention: his
valet de chambre, whom Pallet had consulted as
a consederate, in his revenge against the lady of
pleasure and her Jewish gallant, had hired of cer∣tain
Bohemians, who chanced to lodge at the
inn, a jack-ass adorned with bells, which, when
<PB N="174" REF="183"/>
every body was retired to rest, and the Hebrew
supposed to be bedded with his mistress, they led
up-stairs into a long thoroughfare, from which
the chambers were detached on each side; and
the painter, perceiving the lady's door a-jar, ac∣cording
to his expectation, mounted this animal,
with intention to ride into the room, and disturb
the lovers in the midst of their mutual endear∣ments;
but the ass, true to his kind, finding
himself bestrid by an unknown rider, instead of
advancing, in obedience to his conductor, re∣treated
backwards to the other end of the pas∣sage,
in spite of all the efforts of the painter,
who spurred, and kicked, and pummelled to no
purpose. It was the noise of this contention be∣tween
Pallet and the ass, which invaded the ears
of Peregrine and his mistress, neither of whom
could form the least rational conjecture about the
cause of such strange disturbance, which in∣creased
as the animals approached their apart∣ment;
till, at length, the Bourrique's retrograde
motion was obstructed by their door, which it
burst open, in a twinkling, with one kick, and
entered with such complication of sound, as ter∣rified
the lady almost into a fit, and threw her
lover into an agony of perplexity and confusion.
The painter, finding himself thus violently in∣truded
into the bed-chamber of he knew not
whom, and dreading the resentment of the pos∣sessor,
who might discharge a pistol at him, as a
robber who had broke into his apartment, was
overwhelmed with c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsternation, and redoubled
his exertion, to accomplish a speedy retreat,
sweating all the time with fear, and putting up
petitions to heaven for his safety; but his obstinate
companion, regardless of his situation, instead of
<PB N="175" REF="184"/>
submitting to his conduct, began to turn round
like a millstone, the united sound of his feet and
bells producing a most surprising concert. The
unfortunate rider, whirled about in this manner,
would have quitted his seat, and left the beast to
his own amusement, but the rotation was so ra∣pid,
that the terror of a severe fall hindered him
from attempting to dismount, and in the despe∣ration
of his heart, he seized one of its ears,
which he pinched so unmercifully, that the crea∣ture
set up his threat, and brayed aloud. This
hideous exclamation was no sooner heard by the
fair Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming, already chilled with panic, and
prepared with superstition, than, believing her∣self
visited by the devil, who was permitted to
punish her for her infidelity to the marriage-bed,
she uttered a fearful scream, and began to repeat
her paternoster with a loud voice. Her lover,
finding himself under the necessity of retiring,
started up, and stung with the most violent pangs
of rage and disappointment, ran directly to the
spot from whence this diabolical noise seemed to
proceed, and encountering the ass, discharged
such a volley of blows at him and his rider, that
the creature carried him off at a round trot, and
they roared in unison all the way. Having thus
cleared the room of such disagreeable company,
he went back to his mistress, and assuring her,
that this was only some foolish prank of Pallet,
took his leave, with a promise of returning after
the quiet of the inn should be re-established.</P>
<P>In the mean time the noise of the Bourrique,
the cries of the painter, and the lady's scream,
had alarmed the whole house; and the ass, in the
precipitation of his retreat, seeing people with
lights before him, took shelter in the apartment
<PB N="176" REF="185"/>
for which he was at first designed, just as the
Levite, arroused at the uproar, had quitted his
Dulcinea, and was attempting to recover his own
chamber, unperceived; but, seeing himself op∣posed
by such an animal, mounted by a tall,
meagre, lanthorn-jawed figure, half naked, with
a white night-cap upon his head, which added to
the natural paleness of his complexion, the Jew
was sorely troubled in mind, and believing it to
be an apparition of Balaam and his ass, fled back∣ward
with a nimble pace, and crept under the
bed, where he lay concealed. Mr. Jolter, and
the priest, who were the foremost of those who
had been arroused by the noise, were not un∣moved
when they saw such a spectacle rush∣ing
into this chamber, from whence the lady of
pleasure began to shri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. The governor made a
full ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and the Capuchin discovered no incli∣nation
to proceed. They were (however) by
the pressure of the crowd that followed them,
thrust forward to the door, through which the
vision entered; and there Jolter, with great ce∣remony,
complimented his reverence with the
pas, beseeching him to walk in. The men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cant
was too courteous and humble to accept
this preheminence, and a very earnest dispute
ensued; during which the ass, in the course of
his circuit, shewed himself and rider, and in a
trice decided the contest; for, struck with this
second glimpse, both, at one instant, sprung
backward with such force, as overturned their
next men, who communicated the impulse to
those that stood behind them, and these again to
others; so that the whole passage was strewed
with a long file of people, that lay in a line, like
the sequel and dependance of a pack of cards. In
<PB N="177" REF="186"/>
the midst of this havock, our hero returned from
his own room, with an air of astonishment, ask∣ing
the cause of this uproar, and receiving such
hints of intelligence as Jolter's consternation
would permit him to give, snatched the candle
out of his hand, and advanced into the haunted
chamber without hesitation, being followed by
all present, who broke forth into a long and
loud peal of laughter, when they perceived the
lu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icrous source of their disquiet. The painter
himself made an effort to join their mirth, but he
had been so harrowed by fear, and smarted so
much with the pain of the discipline he had re∣ceived
from Pickle, that he could not, with all
his endeavour, vanquish the ruefulness of his
countenance; and his attempt served only to in∣crease
the aukwardness of his situation, which
was not at all mended by the behaviour of the
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quette, who, furious with her disappointment,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pped on a petticoat and bed-gown, and spring∣ing
upon him, like another Hecuba, with her
nails, deprived all one side of his nose of the skin,
and would not have left him an eye to see thro',
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f some of the company had not rescued him
from her unmerciful talons. Provoked at this
outrage, as well as by her behaviour to him in
the Diligence, he publickly explained his inten∣tion
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n entering her chamber in this equipage;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, missing the Hebrew among the spectators,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, that he must have absconded
somewhere in the apartment: in consequence of
this intimation, the room was immediately
searched, and the mortified Levite pulled by the
heels from his lurking place; so that Pallet had
the good fortune, at last, to transfer the laugh
<PB N="178" REF="187"/>
from himself to his rival, and the French ina∣morata,
who accordingly underwent the ridicule
of the whole audience.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="61" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Pallet, endeavouring to unravel the mystery of the
treatment he had received, falls out of the frying
pan into the fire.</HEAD>
<P>NEvertheless, Pallet was still confounded,
and chagrined by one consideration, which
was no other than that of his having been so
roughly handled in the chamber, belonging (as
he found upon enquiry) to the handsome young
lady, who was under the Capuchin's direction.
He recollected, that the door was fast locked,
when his beast burst it open, and he had no rea∣son
to believe that any person followed him in his
irruption: on the other hand, he could not ima∣gine,
that such a gentle creature would either
attempt to commit, or be able to execute such a
desperate assault as that which his body had sus∣tained;
and her demeanor was so modest and
circumspect, that he durst not harbour the least
suspicion of her virtue.</P>
<P>These reflexions bewildered him in the laby∣rinth
of thought: he rummaged his whole ima∣gination,
endeavouring to account for what had
happened; and at length concluded, that either
Peregrine, or the devil, or both, must have
been at the bottom of the whole affair, and de∣termined,
for the satisfaction of his curiosity, to
watch our hero's motions, during the remaining
part of the night, so narrowly, that his conduct,
<PB N="179" REF="188"/>
mysterious as it was, should not be able to elude
his penetration.</P>
<P>With these sentiments he retired to his own
room, after the ass had been restored to the
right owners, and the priest had visited and con∣firmed
his fair ward, who had been almost dis∣tracted
with fear; and silence no sooner prevail∣ed
again, than he crawled darkling towards her
door, and huddled himself up in an obscure cor∣ner,
from whence he might observe the ingress
or egress of any human creaure. He had not
long remained in this posture, when, fatigued
with this adventure, and that of the preceding
night, his faculties were gradually overpowered
with slumber, and falling fast asleep, he began
to snore like a whole congregation of presbyte∣tians.
The Flemish beauty, hearing this discor∣dant
noise in the passage, began to be afraid of
some new alarm, and very prudently bolted her
door; so that when her lover wanted to repeat
his visit, he was not only surprised and incensed
at this disagreeable serenade, the author of which
he did not know; but when, compelled by his
passion, which was by this time wound to the
highest pitch, he ventured to approach the en∣trance,
he had the extreme mortification to find
himself shut out; and he durst not knock, or
signify his presence in any other manner, on ac∣count
of the lady's reputation, which would have
greatly suffered, had the snorer been waked by
his endeavours. Had he known that the person
who thus thwarted his views, was the painter,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would have taken some effectual step to re∣move
him; but he could not conceive what
should induce Pallet to take up his residence in
that corner; nor could he use the assstance of a
<PB N="180" REF="189"/>
light, to distinguish him, because there was not
a cand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e burning in the house; and besides, the
sleeper might have opened his eyes in the very
moment of his being detected by Peregrine, who
would have incurred suspicion, by appearing, at
such an hour, at that part of the inn, so remote
from his own bed-chamber.</P>
<P>It is impossible to describe the rage and vexa∣tion
of our hero, while he continued thus tanta∣lized
upon the brink of bliss, after his desire had
been exasperated by the circumstances of his two
former disappointments. He ejaculated a thou∣sand
execrations against his own fortune, cursed
all his fellow-travellers, without exception, vow∣ed
revenge against the painter, who had twice
confounded his most interesting scheme, and was
tempted to execute immediate vengeance upon
the unknown cause of his present misadventure.
In this agony of distraction did he sweat two
whole hours in the passage, though not without
some faint hope of being delivered from his ter∣mentor,
who (he imagined) upon waking, woul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
undoubtedly shift his quarters, and leave the field
free to his designs; but when he heard the cock
repeat his salutation to the morn, which began
to open on the rear of night, he could no longer
restrain his indignation, but going to his own
chamber, filed a basin with cold water, and,
standing at some distance, discharged it full in
the face of the gaping snorer, who, over and
above the surprize occasioned by the application,
was almost suffocated by the liquor that entered
his mouth, and ran down into his wind pipe.
While he gasped like a person half drowned,
without knowing the nature of his disaster, or
remembring the situation in which he fell asleep;
<PB N="181" REF="190"/>
Peregrine retired to his own door, and, to his no
small astonishment, from a long howl that in∣vaded
his ears, learnt that the patient was no
other than Pallet, who had now, for the third
time, baulked his good fortune.</P>
<P>Enraged at the complicated trespasses of this
unfortunate offender, he rushed from his apart∣ment
with a horse whip, and encountering the
painter in his flight, overturned him in the pas∣sage,
and exercised the instrument of his wrath
with great severity, on pretence of mistaking
him for some presumptuous cur, which had di∣sturbed
the repose of the inn; nay, when he
called aloud for mercy in a supplicating tone, and
his chastifer could no longer pretend to treat him
as a quadruped, such was the virulence of the
young gentleman's indignation, that he could
not help declaring his satisfaction, by telling Pallet
he had richly deserved the punishment he had un∣dergone,
for his madness, felly and impertinence,
in contriving and executing such idle schemes, as
had no other tendency than that of plaguing his
neighbours.</P>
<P>Pallet protested with great vehemence, that he
was innocent as the child unborn of any inten∣tion
to give umbrage to any person whatever,
except the Israelite and his doxy, who he knew
had incurred his displeasure. “But, as God is
my Saviour! (said he) I believe I am persecuted
with witchcraft, and begin to think that damn'd
priest is an agent of the devil; for he has been
but two nights in our company, during which I
have not closed an eye, but on the contrary have
been tormented by all the fiends of hell.” Pickle
peevishly replied, that his torments had been oc∣casioned
by his own foolish imagination; and
<PB N="182" REF="191"/>
asked how he came to howl in that corner. The
painter, who did not think proper to own the
truth, said, that he had been transported thither
by some preternatural conveyance, and soused in
water by an invisible hand: and the youth, in
hope of profiting by his absence, advised him to
retire immediately to his bed, and by sleep strive
to comfort his brain, which seemed to be not a
little disordered by the want of that refreshment.
Pallet himself began to be very much of the same
way of thinking, and in compliance with such
wholesome counsel, betook himself to rest, mut∣tering
prayers all the way for the recovery of his
understanding.</P>
<P>Pickle attended him to his chamber, and lock∣ing
him up, put the key in his own pocket, that
he might not have it in his power to interrupt
him again: but in his return he was met by Mr.
Jolter and the doctor, who had been a second
time alarmed by the painter's cries, and come thi∣ther
to inquire about this new adventure. Half
frantic with such a series of disappointments, he
cursed them in his heart for their unseasonable ap∣pearance;
and when they questioned him about
Pallet, told them he had found him stark staring
mad, howling in a corner and wet to the skin,
and conducted him to his room, where he was
now abed. The physician hearing this circum∣stance,
made a merit of his vanity, and under
pretence of concern for the patient's welfare, de∣sired
he might have an opportunity of examining
the symptoms of his disorder, without loss of
time; alledging, that many diseases might have
been stifled in the birth, which afterwards baffled
all the endeavours of the medical art. The young
gentleman accordingly delivered the key, and
<PB N="183" REF="192"/>
once more withdrew into his own chamber, with
a view of seizing the first occasion that should
present itself of renewing his application to his
Amanda's door; while the doctor, in his way to
Pallet's apartment, hinted to the governor his
suspicion, that the patient laboured under that
dreadful symptom called the hydrophobia, which
he observed had sometimes appeared in persons
who were not previously bit by a mad dog. This
conjecture he founded upon the howl he uttered
when he was soused with water, and began to
recollect certain circumstances of the painter's
behaviour for some day's past, which now he
could plainly perceive had prognosticated some
such calamity. He then ascribed the distemper
to the violent frights he had lately undergone,
affirmed that the affair of the Bastile had made
such a violent incroachment upon his understand∣ing,
that his manner of thinking and speaking
was intirely altered; and by a theory of his own
invention, explained the effects of fear upon a
loose system of nerves, and demonstrated the
modus in which the animal spirits operate upon
the ideas and power of imagination.</P>
<P>This disquisition, which was communicated
at the painter's door, might have lasted till break∣fast,
had not Jolter reminded him of his own
maxim, <HI>Venicnti occurrite morbo;</HI> upon which he
put the key to immediate use, and they walked
softly towards the bed, where the patient lay ex∣tended
at full length in the arms of slumber.
The physician took notice of his breathing hard,
and his mouth being open; and from these diag∣nostics
declared, that the liquidum nervosum was
intimately affected, and the saliva impregnated
with the spiculated particles of the virus, howso∣ever
<PB N="184" REF="193"/>
contracted. This sentence was still farther
confirmed by the state of his pulse, which being
full and slow, indicated an oppressed circulation,
from a loss of elasticity in the propelling arteries;
and he proposed, that he should immediately
suffer a second aspersion of water, which would
not only contribute to the cure, but also certify
them beyond all possibility of doubt, with regard
to the state of the disease: for it would evidently
appear, from the manner in which he would bear
the application, whether or not his horror of water
amounted to a confirmed hydropho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a. Mr. Jolter,
in compliance with this proposal, began to empty
a bottle of water, which he found in the room
in a basin; when he was interrupted by the pre∣scriber,
who advised him to use the contents of
the chamber-pot, which being impregnated with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt, would operate more effectually than pure
element. Thus directed, the governor lifted up
the vessel, which was rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with medicine, and
with one turn of his hands discharged the whole
healing inundation upon the ill-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>men'd patient,
who waking in the utmost distraction of horror,
yelled most hideously, just at the time when Pe∣regrine
had brought his mistress to a parley, and
entertained hopes of being admitted into her
chamber.</P>
<P>Terrified at this exclamation, she instantly
broke off the treaty, beseeching him to retire
from the door, that her honour might receive no
injury from his being found in that place; and
he had just enough of recollection left to see the
necessity of obeying the order; in conformity to
which he retreated, well nigh deprived of his
senses, and almost persuaded, that so many unac∣countable
disappointments must have pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeded
<PB N="185" REF="194"/>
from some supernatural cause, of which the idiot
Pallet was no more than the involuntary instru∣ment.</P>
<P>Mean while, the doctor having ascertained the
malady of the patient, whose cries, interrupted
by frequent sobs and sighs, he interpreted into the
barking of a dog; having no more salt-water at
hand, resolved to renew the bath with such ma∣terials
as chance would afford, and actually laid
hold of the bottle and basin. But by this time,
the painter had recovered the use of his senses so
well, as to perceive his drift; and starting up,
like a frantic Bedlamite, ran directly to his sword,
swearing with many horrid imprecations, that he
would murder them both immediately, if he
should be hanged before dinner. They did not
choose to wait the issue of his threat, but retired
with such precipitation, that the physician had al∣most
dislocated his shoulder, by running against
one side of the entry; and Jolter having pulled
the door after him, and turned the key, betook
himself to flight, roaring aloud for assistance. His
colleg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e seeing the door sec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed himself
upon his resolution, and exhorted him to return;
declaring, that for his own part, he was more
afraid of the madman's teeth than of his weapon,
and admonishing the governor to re-enter, and
execute what they had left undone; “Go in (said
he) without <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear or apprehension, and if any ac∣cident
shall happen to you, either from his slaver
or his sword, I will assist you with my advice,
which from this station I can more coolly and di∣stinctly
administer, than I should be able to sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,
if my ideas were disturbed, or my attention
engaged in any personal concern.”</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="195"/>
Jolter, who could make no objection to the
justness of the conclusion, frankly owned, that
he had no inclination to try the experiment; ob∣serving,
that self preservation was the first law
of nature; that his connexions with the unhappy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unatic were but slight, and that it could not be
reasonably expected, that he would run such risks
for his service, as were declined by one who had
set out with him from England on the footing of
a companion. This insinuation introduced a dis∣pute
upon the nature of benevolence and the
moral sense, which (the republican argued) ex∣isted
independent of any private consideration,
and could never be affected by any contingent
circumstance of time and fortune; while the
other, who abhorred his principles, asserted the
duties and excellence of private friendship, with
infinite rancour of altercation.</P>
<P>During the hottest of the argument, they were
joined by the Capuchin, who being astonished to
see them thus virulently engaged at the door, and
to hear the painter bellowing within the chamber,
conjured them in the name of God to tell him
the cause of that confusion, which had kept the
whole house in continual alarm during the best
part of the night, and seemed to be the immediate
work of the devil and his angels. When the
governor gave him to understand, that Pallet was
visited with an evil spirit, he muttered a prayer
of St. Antonio de Padua, and undertook to cure
the painter, provided he could be secured so as
that he might, without danger to himself, burn
part of a certain relick under his nose, which he
assured them was equal to the miraculous power
of Eleazar's ring. They expressed great curiosity
to know what this treasure was; and the priest
<PB N="187" REF="196"/>
was prevailed upon to tell them in confidence,
that it was a collection of the parings of the nails
belonging to those two madmen whom Jesus
purged of the legion of devils that afterwards en∣tered
the swine. So saying, he pulled from one
of his pockets a small box, containing about an
ounce of the parings of an horse's hoof; at fight
of which, the governor could not help smiling,
on account of the grossness of the imposition;
and the doctor asked, with a supercilious smile,
whether those maniacs whom Jesus cured, were
of the sorrel complexion, or dapple grey; for,
from the texture of these parings, he could prove,
that the original owners were of the quadruped
order, and even distinguish, that their feet had
been fortified with shoes of iron.</P>
<P>The mendicant, who bore an inveterate grudge
against this son of Aesculapius, ever since he had
made so free with the catholic religion, replied
with great bitterness, that he was a wretch with
whom no Christian ought to communicate; that
the vengeance of heaven would one day overtake
him, on account of his profanity; and that his
heart was shod with a metal much harder than
iron, which he was afraid nothing but hell-fire
would be able to melt.</P>
<P>It was now broad day, and all the servants of
the inn were afoot. Peregrine, seeing it would be
impossible to obtain any sort of indemnification
for the time he had lost, and the perturbation of
his spirits hindering him from enjoying repose,
which was, moreover, obstructed by the noise
of Pallet and his attendants, put on his cloaths at
once, and in exceeding ill humour arrived at the
spot where this triumvirate stood debating about
the means of overpowering the furious painter,
<PB N="188" REF="197"/>
who still continued his song of oaths and execra∣tions,
and made sundry efforts to break open the
door. Chagrin'd as our hero was, he could not
help laughing when he heard how the patient had
been treated; and his indignation changing into
compassion, he called to him through the key-hole,
desiring to know the reason of his distracted
behaviour. Pallet no sooner recognized his voice,
than lowering his own to a whimpering tone,
“My dear friend! (said he) I have at last de∣tected
the ruffians who have persecuted me so
much. I caught them in the fact of suffocating
me with cold water; and by the Lord! I will
be revenged, or may I never live to finish my
Cleopatia. For the love of God! open the door,
and I will make that conceited pagan, that pre∣tender
to taste, that false devotee of the ancients,
who poisons people with fillykickabies and devil's
dung; I say, I will make him a monument of
my wrath, and an example to all the cheats and
impostors of the faculty: and as for that thick-headed
insolent pedant his confederate, who
emptied my own jordan upon me while I slept,
he had better have been in his beloved Paris,
botching schemes for his friend the pretender,
than incurred the effects of my resentment.
Gadsbodikins! I won't leave him a wind-pipe for
the hangman to stop, at the end of another re∣bellion.”</P>
<P>Pickle told him, that his conduct had been so
extravagant, as to confirm the whole company
in the belief, that he was actually deprived of his
senses; on which supposition, Mr. Jolter and the
doctor had acted the part of friends, in doing that
which they thought most conducive to his reco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery;
so that their concern merited his thankful
<PB N="189" REF="198"/>
acknowledgment, instead of his frantic menaces:
and that for his own part, he would be the first
to condemn him, as one utterly berest of his wits,
and give orders for his being secured as a mad∣man,
unless he would immediately give a proof
of his sanity, by laying aside his sword, com∣posing
his spirits, and thanking his injured friends
for their care of his person.</P>
<P>This alternative quieted his transports in a mo∣ment;
he was terrified at the apprehension of
being treated like a Bedlamite, being dubious of
the state of his own brain; and on the other
hand, had conceived such an horror and antipa∣thy
for his tormentors, that, far from believing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obliged by what they had done, he could
not even think of them without the utmost rage
and detestation. He therefore, in the most tran∣quil
voice he could assume, protested, that he
never was less out of his senses than at present,
though he did not know how long he might re∣tain
them, if he should be considered in the light
of a luntic and that, in order to prove his being
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he was willing to sacrifice the re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ment
he so justly harboured against those who
by their malice had brought him to this pass:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as he apprehended, it would be the greatest

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than be guilty of such mean <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Peregrine held a consultation upon this reply,
when the governor and physician strenuously a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gued
against any capitulation with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and
pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posed that some method might be taken to

<PB N="190" REF="199"/>
where he might be treated according to the rules
of art. But the Capuchin understanding the cir∣cumstances
of the case, undertook to restore him
to his former state, without having recourse to
such violent measures: and Pickle, who was a
better judge of the affair than any person present,
opened the door without further hesitation, and
displayed the poor painter standing with a woeful
countenance, shivering in his shirt, which was as
wet as if he had been dragged through the Den∣der;
a spectacle which gave such offence to the
chaste eyes of the Hebrew's mistress, who was
by this time one of the spectators, that she turned
her head another way, and withdrew to her own
room, exclaiming against the indecent practices
of men.</P>
<P>Pallet, seeing the young gentleman enter, ran
to him, and shaking him by the hand, called him
his best friend, and said he had rescued him from
those who had a design against his life. The
priest would have produced his parings, and ap∣plied
them to his nose; but was hindered by
Pickle, who advised the patient to shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t himself,
and put on his cloaths: and this being done with
great order and deliberation, Mr. Jolter, who,
with the doctor, had kept at a wary distance, in
expectation of seeing some strange effects of his
distraction, began to believe that he had been
guilty of a mistake, and accused the physician of
having misled him by his false diagnostic. The
doctor still insisted upon his former declaration,
assuring him, that although Pallet enjoyed a short
interval for the present, the delirium would soon
recur, unless they would profit by this momentary
calm, and order him to be blooded, blistered and
purged with all imaginable dispatch.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="200"/>
The governor, however, notwithstanding this
caution, advanced to the injured party, and begg'd
pardon for the share he had in giving him such di∣sturbance,
declaring in the most solemn manner,
that he had no other intention than that of con∣tributing
towards his welfare, and that his beha∣viour
was the result of the physician's prescrip∣tion,
which he affirmed was absolutely necessary
for the recovery of his health.</P>
<P>The painter, who had very little gall in his
disposition, was satisfied with this apology; but
his resentment, which was before divided, now
glowed with double fire against his first fellow∣traveller,
whom he looked upon as the author of
all the mischances he had undergone, and marked
out for his vengeance accordingly. Yet the doors
of reconciliation were not shut against the doctor,
who with great justice might have transferred
this load of offence from himself to Peregrine,
who was, without doubt, the source of the
painter's misfortune: but, in that case, he must
have owned himself mistaken in his medical ca∣pacity;
and he did not think the friendship of
Pallet important enough to sway him to such
condescension; so that he resolved to neglect him
intirely, and gradually forget the former corre∣spondence
he had maintained with a person whom
he deemed so unworthy of his notice.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine, almost distracted with his disappoint∣ments,
conjures the fair Fleming to permit his
visits at Brussels. She withdraws from his
pursuit.</HEAD>
<P>THINGS being thus adjusted, and all the
company dressed, they went to breakfast
about five in the morning, and in less than an
hour after were seated in the Diligence, where
a profound silence prevailed. Peregrine, who
used to be the life of the society, being extremely
pensive and melancholy on account of his mishap,
the Israelite and his Dulcinea dejected in conse∣quence
of their disgrace, the poet absorpt in losty
meditation, the painter in schemes of revenge,
while Jolter, rocked by the motion of the car∣riage,
made himself amends for the want of rest
he had sustained, and the Mendicant, with his
fair charge, were infested by the cloudy aspect of
our youth, in whose disappointment each of them,
for different reasons, bore no inconsiderable share.
This general languor and recess from all bodily
exercise, disposed them all to receive the gentle
yoke of slumber, and in half an hour after they
had embarked, there was not one of them
awake, except our hero and his mistress, unless
the Capuchin was pleased to counterfeit sleep, in
order to indulge our young gentleman with an op∣portunity
of enjoying some private conversation
with his beauteous ward.</P>
<P>Peregrine did not neglect the occasion; but,
on the contrary, seized the first minute, and in
gentle murmurs lamented his hard hap in being
<PB N="193" REF="202"/>
thus the sport of fortune. He assured her (and
that with great sincerity) that all the cross acci∣dents
of his life had not cost him one half of the
vexation and keenness of chagrin which he had
suffered last night; and that now he was on the
brink of parting from her, he should be over∣whelmed
with the blackest despair, if she would
not extend her compassion so far as to give him
an opportunity of sighing at her seet in Brussels,
during the few days his affairs would permit him
to spend in that city.</P>
<P>This young lady, with an air of mortification,
expressed her sorrow for being the innocent cause
of his anxiety; said, she hoped last night's ad∣venture
would be a salutary warning to both
their souls; for she was persuaded, that her virtue
was protected by the intervention of heaven; that
whatever impression it might have made upon
him, she was enabled by it to adhere to that duty
from which her passion had begun to swerve, and
beseeching him to forget her for his own peace,
gave him to understand, that neither the plan she
had laid down for her own conduct, nor the
dictates of her honour, would allow her to re∣ceive
his visits, or carry on any other correspon∣dence
with him, while she was restricted by the
articles of her marriage-vow.</P>
<P>This explanation produced such a violent ef∣fect
upon her admirer, that he was for some mi∣nutes
deprived of the faculty of speech, which
he no sooner recovered, than he gave vent to
the most unbridled transports of passion. He
taxed her with barbarity and indifference; told
her that she had robbed him of his reason and in∣ternal
peace; that he would follow her to the
ends of the earth, and cease to live sooner than
<PB N="194" REF="203"/>
cease to love her; that he would sacrifice the in∣nocent
fool who had been the occasion of all this
disquiet, and murder every man whom he con∣sidered
as an obstruction to his views. In a
word, his passions, which had continued so long
in a state of the highest fermentation, together
with the want of that repose which calms and
quiets the perturbation of the spirits, had wrought
him up to a pitch of real distraction: and while
he uttered these delirious expressions, the tears
ran down his cheeks, and he underwent such
agitation, that the tender heart of the fair Fle∣ming
was affected with his condition; and, while
her own face was bedewed with the streams of
sympathy, she begged him for heaven's sake to
be composed, and promised, for his satisfaction,
to abate somewhat of the rigor of her purpose.
Consoled by this kind declaration, he recollected
himself, and taking out his pencil, gave her his
address, when she had assured him, that he should
hear from her in four and twenty hours at farthest,
after their separation.</P>
<P>Thus soothed, he regained the empire of him∣self,
and by degrees recovered his serenity. But
this was not the case with his Amanda, who, from
this sample of his disposition, dreaded the impe∣tuosity
of his youth, and was effectually deterred
from entering into any engagements that might
subject her peace and reputation to the rash ef∣fects
of such a violent spirit. Though she was
captivated by his person and accomplishments,
she had reflection enough to foresee, that the
longer she countenanced his passion, her own
heart would be more and more irretrievably en∣gaged,
and the quiet of her life the more ex∣posed
to continual interruption. She therefore
<PB N="195" REF="204"/>
profited by these considerations, and a sense of re∣ligious
honour, which helped her to withstand the
suggestions of inclination; and resolved to amuse
her lover with false hopes, until she should have
it in her power to relinquish his conversation,
without running any risk of suffering by the in∣considerate
sallies of his love. It was with this
view, that she desired he would not insist upon
attending her to her mother's house, when the
Diligence arrived at Brussels; and he, cajoled by
her artifice, took a formal leave of her, together
with the other strangers, fixing his habitation at
the inn to which he and his fellow-travellers had
been directed, in the impatient expectation of re∣ceiving
a kind summons from her, within the li∣mited
time.</P>
<P>Mean while, in order to divert his imagina∣tion,
he went to see the stadthouse, park and
arsenal, took a superficial view of the famous
bookseller's cabinet of curiosities, and spent the
evening at the Italian opera, which was at that
time exhibited for the entertainment of Prince
Charles of Lorrain, then governor of the Low
Countries. In short, the stated period was al∣most
elapsed, when Peregrine was favoured with
a letter to this purpose:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF you knew what violence I do my own heart,
in declaring that I have withdrawn myself for
ever from your addresses, you would surely ap∣plaud
the sacrifice I make to virtue, and strive to
imitate this example of self-denial. Yes, Sir,
heaven hath lent me grace to struggle with my
guilty passion, and henceforth to avoid the dan∣gerous
sight of him who inspired it. I therefore
<PB N="196" REF="205"/>
conjure you, by the regard you ought to have for
the eternal welfare of us both, as well as by the
esteem and affection you profess, to war with
your unruly inclination, and desist from all at∣tempts
of frustrating the laudable resolution I have
made. Seek not to invade the peace of one
who loves you, to disturb the quiet of a family
that never did you wrong, and alienate the
thoughts of a weak woman from a deserving
man, who, by the most sacred claim, is vested
with the full possession of her heart.”</P>
<P>This billet, without either date or subscription,
banished all remains of discretion from the mind
of our hero, who ran instantly to the landlord,
in all the extasy of madness, and demanded to
see the messenger who brought the letter, on
pain of putting his whole family to the sword.
The innkeeper, terrified by his looks and me∣naces,
fell upon his knees, protesting in the face
of heaven, that he was utterly ignorant and inno∣cent
of any thing that could give him offence, and
that the billet was brought by a person whom he
did not know, and who retired immediately, say∣ing,
it required no answer. He then gave utterance
to his fury, in a thousand imprecations and invec∣tives
against the writer, whom he dishonoured
with the appellations of a coquette, a jilt, an
adventurer, who, by means of a pimping priest,
had defrauded him of his money. He denounced
vengeance against the Mendicant, whom he swore
he would castrate, if ever he should set eyes on
him again: and the painter unluckily appearing
during this paroxysm of rage, he seized him by
the throat, saying he was ruined by his accursed
folly; and in all likelihood poor Pallet would
<PB N="197" REF="206"/>
have been strangled, had not Jolter interposed in
his behalf, beseeching his pupil to have mercy
upon the sufferer, and with infinite anxiety de∣siring
to know the cause of this violent assault. He
received no answer, but a string of incoherent
curses, and when the painter, with unspeakable
astonishment, took God to witness, that he had
done nothing to disoblige him, the governor be∣gan
to think in sad earnest, that Peregrine's vi∣vacity
had at length risen to the transports of
actual madness, and was himself almost distracted
with this supposition. That he might the better
judge what remedy ought to be applied, he used
his whole influence, and practised all his eloquence
upon the youth, in order to learn the immediate
cause of his delirium. He employed the most
pathetic intreaties, and even shed tears in the
course of his supplication; so that Pickle (the
first violence of the hurricane being blown over)
was ashamed of his own imprudence, and retired
to his chamber, in order to recollect his dissipated
thoughts: there he shut himself up, and, for
the second time, perusing the fatal epistle, began
to waver in his opinion of the author's character
and intention. He sometimes considered her as
one of those nymphs who, under the mask of in∣nocence
and simplicity, practise upon the hearts
and purses of unwary and unexperienced youths:
this was the suggestion of his wrath, inflamed
by disappointment; but, when he reflected upon
the circumstances of her behaviour, and recalled
her particular charms to his imagination, the se∣verity
of his censure gave way, and his heart
declared in favour of her sincerity. Yet even
this consideration aggravated the sense of his loss,
and he was in danger of relapsing into his former
<PB N="198" REF="207"/>
distraction, when his passion was a little becalmed
by the hope of seeing her again, either by acci∣dent,
or in the course of a diligent and minute in∣quiry,
which he forthwith resolved to set on <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot.
He had reason to believe, that her own heart
sould espouse his cause, in spite of her virtue's
determination, and did not despair of meeting
with the Capuchin, whose good offices he knew
he could at any time command. Comforted
with these reflexions, the tempest of his souls
subsided, and in less than two hours he joined
his company with an air of composure, and asked
the painter's forgiveness for the freedom he had
taken, the cause of which he promised hereatter

on any terms to one whose countenance supported

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine meets with Mrs. Hornbeck, and is con∣soled
for his loss. His valet de chambre is em∣broiled
with her duenna, whom, however, he
finds means to appease.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY thing having thus resumed its na∣tural
channel, they dined together in great
Tranquillity; and in the afternoon, peregrine, on
Pretence of staying at home to write letters, while
his companions were at the coffee-house, ordered a
coach to be called, and with his valet de chambre,
who was the only person acquainted with the pre∣sent
state of his thoughts, set out for the Prome∣nade,
to which all the ladies of fashion resort in
<PB N="199" REF="208"/>
the evening, during the summer-season, in hopes
of seeing his fugitive among the rest.</P>
<P>Having made a circuit round the walk, and
narrowly observed every female in the place, he
perceived at some distance the livery of Hornbeck
upon a lacquey that stood at the back of a coach:
upon which, he ordered his man to reconnoitre
the said carriage, while he pulled up his glasses,
that he might not be discovered, before he should
have received some intelligence, by which he
might conduct himself on this unexpected occa∣sion,
that already began to interfere with the pur∣pose
of his coming thither, though it could not
dispute his attention with the idea of his charm∣ing
Unknown.</P>
<P>His Mercury having made his observations, re∣ported,
that there was no body in the coach but
Mrs. Hornbeck and an elderly woman, who had
all the air of a duenna, and that the servant was
not the same footman who had attended them in
France. Encouraged by this information, our
hero ordered himself to be driven close up to that
side of their convenience on which his old mistress
sat, and accosted her with the usual salutation.
This lady no sooner beheld her gallant, than her
cheeks reddened with a double glow; and she
exclaimed, “Dear brother, I'm overjoy'd to see
you! Pray come into our coach.” He took the
hint immediately, and complying with her re∣quest,
embraced this new sister with great af∣fection.</P>
<P>Perceiving that her attendant was very much
surprised and alarmed at this unexpected meet∣ing,
she, in order to banish her suspicion, and
at the same time give her lover his cue, told him
that his brother (meaning her husband) was gone
<PB N="200" REF="209"/>
to the Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for a few weeks, by the advice of phy∣sicians,
on account of his ill state of health; and
that, from his last letter, she had the pleasure to
tell him, he was in a fair way of doing well.
The young gentleman expressed his satisfaction at
this piece of news, observing with an air of fra∣ternal
concern, that if his brother had not made
too free with his constitution, his friends in Eng∣land
would have had no occasion to repine at his
absence and want of health, by which he was
banished from his own country and connexions.
He then asked with an affectation of surprize,
why she had not accompanied her spouse? and
was given to understand, that his tenderness of
affection would not suffer him to expose her to
the fatigues of the journey, which lay among
rocks that were almost inaccessible.</P>
<P>The duenna's doubts being eased by this pre∣amble
of conversation, he changed the subject to
the pleasures of the place; and among other such
questions, inquired if she had as yet visited Ver∣sailles?
This is a public house situated upon the
canal, at the distance of about two miles from
town, and accommodated with tolerable gardens
for the entertainment of company. When she
replied in the negative, he proposed to accom∣pany
her thither immediately; but the gover∣nante,
who had hitherto sat silent, objected to
this proposal, telling them, in broken English, that
as the lady was under her care, she could not an∣swer
to Mr. Hornbeck for allowing her to visit
such a suspicious place. “As for that matter,
Madam, (said the confident gallant) give your∣self
no trouble, the consequences shall be at my
peril; and I will undertake to insure you against
my brother's resentment.” So saying, he directed
<PB N="201" REF="210"/>
the coachman to the place, and ordered his own
to follow, under the auspices of his valet de
chambre, while the old gentlewoman, over-ruled
by his assurance, quietly submitted to his autho∣rity.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the place, he handed the la∣dies
from the coach, and then, for the first time,
observed that the duenna was lame, a circum∣stance
of which he did not scruple to take the ad∣vantage;
for they had scarce alighted, and drank
a glass of wine, when he advised his sister to en∣joy
a walk in the garden: and although the at∣tendant
made shift to keep them almost always in
view, they enjoyed a detached conversation, in
which Peregrine learnt, that the true cause of
her being left behind at Brussels, whilst her hus∣band
proceeded to Spa, was his dread of the
company and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amiliarities of that place, to which
his jealousy durst not expose her; and that she
had lived three weeks in a convent at Lisle, from
which she was delivered by his own free motion,
because indeed he could no longer exist without
her company; and lastly, our lover understood,
that her governante was a mere dragon, who had
been recommended to him by a Spanish merchant,
whose wife she attended to her dying day: but
she very much questioned whether or not her fi∣delity
was proof enough against money and strong
waters. Peregrine assured her the experiment
should be tried before parting; and they agreed
to pass the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght at Versailles, provided his en∣deavours
should succeed.</P>
<P>Having exercised themselves in this manner,
until his duenna's spirits were pretty much ex∣haulted,
that she might be the better disposed to
recruit them with a glass of liqueur, they returned
<PB N="202" REF="211"/>
to their apartment, and the cordial was recom∣mended
and received in a bumper: but as it did
not produce such a visible alteration as the san∣guine
hopes of Pickle had made him expect, and
the old gentlewoman observed that it began to be
late, and that the gates would be shut in a little
time, he filled up a parting glass, and pledged her
in equal quantity. Her blood was too much
chilled to be warmed even by this extraordinary
dose, which made immediate innovation in the
brain of our youth, who in the gaiety of his ima∣gination
overwhelmed this She-Argus with such
profusion of gallantry, that she was more intoxi∣cated
with his expressions than with the spirits
she had drank; and when in the course of toying
he dropt a purse into her bosom, she seemed
to forget how the night wore, and with the ap∣probation
of her charge, assented to his proposal
of having something for supper.</P>
<P>This was a great point which our adventurer
had gained, and yet he plainly perceived that the
governante mistook his meaning, by giving her∣self
credit for all the passion he had professed. As
this error could be rectified by no other means
than those of plying her with the bottle, until
her distinguishing faculties should be overpower∣ed,
he promoted a quick circulation, and she
did him justice, without any manifest signs of
inebriation, so long, that his own eyes began to
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el in the sockets; and he found, that before his
scheme could be accomplished, he should be ef∣fectually
unfitted for all the purposes of love.
He therefore had recourse to his valet de chambre,
who understood the hint as soon as it was given,
and readily undertook to perform the part, of
which his master had play'd the prelude. This
<PB N="203" REF="212"/>
affair being settled to his satisfaction, and the
night at odds with morning, he took an op∣portunity
of imparting to the ear of this aged
Dulcinea a kind whisper, importing a promise
of visiting her, when his sister should be retired
to her own chamber, and an earnest desire of
leaving her door unlocked.</P>
<P>This agreeable intimation being communicated,
he conveyed a caution of the same nature to
Mrs. Hornbeck, as he led her to her apartment;
and darkness and silence no sooner prevailed in
the house, than he and his trusty squire set out
on their different voyages; and every thing would
have succeeded according to their wish, had not
the valet de chambre suffered himself to fall asleep
at the side of his inamorata, and in the agitation
of a violent dream, exclaimed in a voice so un∣like
to that of her supposed adorer, that she di∣stinguished
the difference at once; and waking
him with a pinch and a loud shriek, threatened
to prosecute him for a rape, and reviled him with
all the epithets her rage and disappointment could
suggest.</P>
<P>The Frenchman finding himself detected, be∣haved
with great temper and address: he begg'd
she would compose herself, on account of her
own reputation, which was extremely dear to
him; protested, that he had a most inviolable
esteem for her person; and that if he had not al∣ready
given convincing proofs of his passion, he
was disposed to do every thing in his power for her
satisfaction. These representations, mingled with
some little practical expressions of tenderness, had
weight with the duenna, who, upon recollection,
comprehended the whole affair, and thought it
would be her interest to bring matters to an ac∣commodation.
<PB N="204" REF="213"/>
She therefore admitted the apo∣logies
of her bedfellow, provided he would pro∣mise
to atone by marriage for the injury she had
sustained; and in this particular he set her heart
at ease by repeated vows, which he uttered with
surprising volubility, though without any inten∣tion
to perform the least tittle of their contents.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who had been alarmed by her ex∣clamation,
and run to the door with a view of
interposing, according to the emergency of the
case, over-hearing the affair thus compromised,
returned to his mistress, who was highly entertain∣ed
with an account of what had passed, foreseeing,
that for the future she should be under no diffi∣culty
or restriction from the severity of her guard.</P>

<P>THERE was another person, however, still
ungained; and that was no other than her
footman, whose secrecy our hero attempted to
secure in the morning by an handsome present,
which he received with many professions of gra∣titude
and devotion to his service; yet this com∣plaisance
was nothing but a cloak used to disguise
the design he harboured of making his master ac∣quainted
with the whole transaction. Indeed this
lacquey had been hired, not only as a spy upon
his mistress, but also as a check on the conduct
of the governante, with promise of ample reward,
<PB N="205" REF="214"/>
if ever he should discover any sinister or suspicious
practices in the course of their behaviour: and
as for the footman whom they had brought from
England, he was retained in attendance upon the
person of his master, whose confidence he had
lost, by advising him to gentle methods of re∣claiming
his lady, when her irregularities had sub∣jected
her to his wrath.</P>
<P>The Flemish valet, in consequence of the of∣fice
he had undertaken, wrote to Hornbeck by
the first post, giving an exact detail of the ad∣venture
at Versailles, with such a description of
the pretended brother, as left the husband no
room to think he could be any other person than
his first dishonourer; and exasperated him to such
a degree, that he resolved to lay an ambush for
this invader, and at once disqualify him from di∣sturbing
his repose, by maintaining further cor∣respondence
with his wife.</P>
<P>Mean while the lovers enjoyed themselves
without restraint, and Peregrine's plan of inquiry
after his dear Unknown was for the present post∣poned.
His fellow-travellers were confounded at
his mysterious motions, which filled the heart of
Jolter with anxiety and terror. This careful
conductor was fraught with such experience of
his pupil's disposition, that he trembled with the
apprehension of some sudden accident, and lived
in continual alarm, like a man that walks under
the wall of a nodding tower. Nor did he enjoy
any alleviation of his fears, when upon telling the
young gentleman, that the rest of the company
were desirous of departing for An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>werp, he an∣swered,
they were at liberty to consult their own
melinations; but for his own part, he was re∣solved
to stay in Brussels a few days longer. By

the opinion of his having some intrigue upon the
anvil; and in the bitterness of his vexation, took
the liberty of signifying his suspicion, and re∣minding
him of the dangerous dilemmas to which
he had been reduced by his former precipitation.</P>
<P>Peregrine took his caution in good part, and
promised to behave with such circumspection, as
would screen him from any troublesome conse∣quences
for the future: but, nevertheless, be∣haved
that same evening in such a manner, as
plainly shewed, that his prudence was nothing
else than vain speculation. He had made an ap∣pointment
to spend the night, as usual, with
Mrs. Hornbeck; and about nine o'clock hastened
to her lodgings, when he was accosted in the
street by his old discarded friend Thomas Pipes,
who, without any other preamble, told him, that
for all he had turned him adrist, he did not choose
to see him run full sail into his enemy's harbour,
without giving him timely notice of the danger.
“I'll tell you what, (said he) mayhap you think
I want to curry favour, that I may be taken in
tow again; if you do, you have made a mistake
in your reckoning. I am old enough to be laid
up, and have wherewithal to keep my planks
from the weather. But this here is the affair; I
have known you since you were no higher than
a marlinspike, and shouldn't care to see you de∣prived
of your carriages at these years: whereby
I am informed by Hornbeck's man, whom I this
afternoon fell in with by chance, as how his ma∣ster
has got intelligence of your boarding his
wife, and has steer'd privately into this port, with
a large compliment of hands, in order, d'ye see,
to secure you while you are under the hatches,
<PB N="207" REF="216"/>
and cut away your tackle, without fear or mercy.
Now if so be as how you have a mind to give
him a salt eel for his supper, here am I, without
hope of fee or reward, ready to stand by you as
long as my timbers will stick together; and if I
expect any recompence, may I be bound to eat
oakum and drink bilge-water for life.”</P>
<P>Startled at this information, Peregrine exa∣mined
him upon the particulars of his discourse
with the lacquey; and when he understood that
Hornbeck's intelligence flowed from the canal of
his Flemish footman, he believed every circum∣stance
of Tom's report, thanked him for this
warning, and after having reprimanded him for
his misbehaviour at Lisle, assured him that it
should be his own fault if ever they should part
again. He then deliberated with himself whether
or not he should retort the purpose upon his ad∣versary;
but, when he considered that Hornbeck
was not the aggressor, and made that unhappy
husband's case his own, he could not help ac∣quitting
his intention of revenge; though, in his
opinion, it ought to have been executed in a more
honourable manner; and therefore he deter∣mined
to chastise him for his want of spirit. No∣thing
surely can be more insolent and unjust than
this determination, which induced him to punish
a person, for his want of courage to redress the
injury which he himself had done to his repu∣tation
and peace; and yet this barbarity of deci∣sion
is sanctioned by the opinion and practice of
mankind.</P>
<P>With these sentiments he returned to the inn,
and putting a pair of pistols in his pocket, ordered
his valet de chambre and Pipes to follow him at a
small distance, so as that they should be within
<PB N="208" REF="217"/>
call, in case of necessity, and posted himself within
thirty yards of his Dulcinea's door. There he
had not been above half an hour, when he per∣ceived
four men take up their station on the other
side, with a view, as he guessed, to watch for
his going in, that he might be taken unaware.
But when they had tarried a considerable time in
that corner, without reaping the fruits of their
expectation, their leader, persuaded that the gal∣lant
had gained admittance by some secret means,
approached the door with his followers, who,
according to the instructions they had received,
no sooner saw it opened, than they rushed in,
leaving their employer in the street, where he
thought his person would be least endangered.
Our adventurer seeing him alone, advanced with
speed, and clapping a pistol to his breast, com∣manded
him to follow his footsteps, without noise,
on pain of immediate death.</P>
<P>Terrified at this sudden apparition, Hornbeck
obeyed in silence; and in a few minutes they ar∣rived
at the quay, where Pickle halting, gave
him to understand, that he was no stranger to
his villainous design; and told him, that if he
conceived himself injured by any circumstance of
his conduct, he would now give him an oppor∣tunity
of resenting the wrong, in a manner be∣coming
a man of honour. “You have a sword
about you, (said he) or if you don't choose to
put the affair on that issue, here is a brace of
pistols, take which you please.” Such an address
could not fail to disconcert a man of his cha∣racter.
After some hesitation, he in a faultering
accent denied that his design was to mutilate
Mr. Pickle, but that he thought himself intitled
to the benefit of the law, by which he would
<PB N="209" REF="218"/>
have obtained a divorce, if he could have pro∣cured
evidence of his wife's infidelity; and with
that view had employed people to take advantage
of the information he had received. With re∣gard
to his alternative, he declined it intirely, be∣cause
he could not see what satisfaction he should
enjoy, in being shot through the head, or run
through the lungs, by a person who had already
wronged him in an irreparable manner; and
lastly, his fear made him propose, that the affair
should be left to the arbitration of two creditable
men, altogether unconcerned in the dispute.</P>
<P>To these remonstrances, Peregrine replied, in
the stile of a hot-headed young man, conscious
of his own unjustifiable behaviour, that every
gentleman ought to be a judge of his own ho∣nour;
and therefore he would submit to the de∣cision
of no umpire what soever; that he would
forgive his want of courage, which might be a
natural infirmity, but his mean dissimulation he
could not pardon; and that, as he was certified
of the rascally intent of his ambuscade, by un∣doubted
intelligence, he would treat him, not
with a retaliation of his own treachery, but with
such indignity as a scoundrel deserves to suffer;
unless he would make one effort to maintain the
character he assumed in life: so saying, he again
presented his pistol, which being rejected as be∣fore,
he called his two ministers, and ordered
them to duck him in the canal.</P>
<P>This command was pronounced and executed
almost in the same breath, to the unspeakable
terror and disorder of the poor shivering patient,
who, having undergone the immersion, ran about
like a drowned rat, squeaking for assistance and
revenge. His cries were overheard by the pa∣trole,
<PB N="210" REF="219"/>
which, chancing to pass that way, took
him under their protection, and, in consequence
of his complaint and information, went in pur∣suit
of our adventurer and his attendants, who
were soon overtaken and surrounded. Rash and
inconsiderate as the young gentleman was, he
did not pretend to stand upon the defensive, a∣gainst
a file of musketeers, although Pipes had
drawn his cutlass at their approach, but surren∣dered
himself without opposition, and was con∣veyed
to the main guard, where the command∣ing
officer, engaged by his appearance and ad∣dress,
treated him with all imaginable respect,
and hearing the particulars of his adventure, as∣sured
him, that the prince would consider the
whole as a <HI>Tour de jeunesse,</HI> and order him to be
released without delay.</P>
<P>Next morning, when this gentleman gave in
his report, he made such a favourable representa∣tion
of the prisoner, that our hero was on the
point of being discharged; when Hornbeck pre∣ferred
a complaint, accusing him of a purposed
assassination, and praying that such punishment
should be inflicted upon him, as his highness
should think adequate to the nature of the crime.
The prince, perplexed with this petition, in con∣sequence
of which he foresaw, that he must dis∣oblige
a British subject, sent for the plaintiff, of
whom he had some knowledge, and in person ex∣horted
him to drop the prosecution, which would
only serve to propagate his own shame. But
Hornbeck was too much incensed to listen to any
proposal of that kind, and peremptorily demand∣ed
justice against the prisoner, whom he repre∣sented
as an obscure adventurer, who had made
repeated attempts upon his honour and his life.
<PB N="211" REF="220"/>
Prince Charles told him, that what he had ad∣vised
was in the capacity of a friend, but, since
he insisted upon his acting as a magistrate, the
affair should be examined, and determined ac∣cording
to the dictates of justice and truth.</P>
<P>The petitioner being dismissed with this pro∣mise,
the defendant was in his turn brought be∣fore
the judge, whose prepossession in his favour,
was in a great measure weakened by what his an∣tagonist
had said to the prejudice of his birth and
reputation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is released. Jolter confounded at his
mysterious conduct. A contest happens between
the poet and painter, who are reconciled by the
mediation of their fellow travellers.</HEAD>
<P>OUR hero, understanding from some expres∣sions
which escaped the prince, that he was
considered in the light of a sharper and assassin,
begged that he might have the liberty of sending
for some vouchers, that would probably vindicate
his character from the malicious aspersions of his
adversary; and this permission being granted, he
wrote a letter to his governor, desiring that he
would bring to him the letters of recommenda∣tion
which he had received from the British em∣bassador
at Paris, and such other papers as he
thought conducive to evince the importance of
his situation.</P>
<P>The billet was given in charge to one of the
subaltern officers on duty, who carried it to the
inn, and demanded to speak with Mr. Jolter▪
Pallet, who happened to be at the door, when
<PB N="212" REF="221"/>
this messenger arrived, and heard him enquire for
the tutor, ran directly to that gentleman's apart∣ment,
and in manifest disorder told him, that a
huge fellow of a soldier, with a monstrous pair
of whiskers, and a fur-cap as big as a bushel, was
asking for him at the door. The poor governor
began to shake at this intimation, though he was
not conscious of having committed any thing
that could attract the attention of the state; and,
when the officer appeared at his chamber-door,
his confusion increased to such a degree, that his
perception seemed to vanish, and the subaltern
repeated the purport of his errand three times,
before he could comprehend his meaning, or
venture to receive the letter which he presented.
At length, however, he summoned all his forti∣tude,
and having perused the epistle, his terror
sunk into anxiety; his ingenious fear immediately
suggested, that Peregrine was confined in a dun∣geon,
for some outrage he had committed; he
ran with great agitation to a trunk, and taking
out a bundle of papers, followed his conductor,
being attended by the painter, to whom he had
hinted his apprehension. When they passed
through the guard, which was under arms, the
hearts of both died within them; and when they
came into the presence, there was such an ex∣pression
of awful horror on the countenance of
Jolter, that the prince, observing his dismay, was
pleased to encourage him with an assurance, that
he had nothing to fear. Thus comforted, he re∣collected
himself so well as to understand his pu∣pil,
when he desired him to produce the Embas∣sador's
letters; some of which being open, were
immediately read by his highness, who was per∣sonally
acquainted with the writer, and knew
<PB N="213" REF="222"/>
several of the noblemen to whom they were ad∣dressed.
These recommendations were so warm,
and represented the young gentleman in such an
advantageous light, that the prince, convinced of
the injustice his character had suffered by the
misrepresentation of Hornbeck, took our hero by
the hand, asked pardon for the doubts he had
entertained of his honour, declared him from that
moment at liberty, ordered his domesticks to be
enlarged, and offered him his countenance and
protection, as long as he should remain in the
Austrian Netherlands. At the same time, he
cautioned him against indiscretion in the course
of his gallantries; and took his word and honour,
that he should drop all measures of resentment
against the person of Hornbeck, during his resi∣dence
in that place.</P>
<P>The delinquent, thus honourably acquitted,
thanked the prince in the most respectful man∣ner,
for his generosity and candour, and retired
with his two friends, who were amazed and be∣wildered
in their thoughts, at what they had seen
and heard, the whole adventure still remaining
without the sphere of their comprehension, which
was not at all enlarged by the unaccountable ap∣pearance
of Pipes, who, with the valet de cham∣bre,
joined them at the castle-gate. Had Jolter
been a man of a luxuriant imagination, his brain
would undoubtedly have suffered in the investi∣gation
of his pupil's mysterious conduct, which
he strove in vain to unravel; but his intellects
were too solid to be affected by the miscarriage
of his invention; and as Peregrine did not think
proper to make him acquainted with the cause of
his being apprehended, he contented himself with
supposing, that there was a lady in the case.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="223"/>
The painter, whose imagination was of a more
flimsy texture, formed a thousand chimerical
conjectures, which he communicated to Pickle,
in imperfect insinuations, hoping, by his answers
and behaviour, to discover the truth; but the
youth, in order to tantalize him, eluded all his
enquiries, with such appearance of industry and
art, as heightened his curiosity, while it disap∣pointed
his aim, and inflamed him to such a de∣gree
of impatience, that his wits began to be un∣settled,
and Peregrine was fain to recompose his
brain, by telling him in confidence, that he had
been arrested as a spy. This secret he found
more intolerable than his former uncertainty; he
ran from one apartment to another, like a goose
in the agonies of egg-laying, with intention of
disburdening this important load; but, Jolter be∣ing
engaged with his pupil, and all the people of
the house ignorant of the only language he could
speak, he was compelled, with infinite reluctance,
to address himself to the doctor, who was, at that
time, shut up in his own chamber. Having knocked
at the door, to no purpose, he peeped through
the key-hole, and saw the physician sitting at a
table, with a pen in one hand, and paper before
him, his head reclined upon his other hand, and
his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, as if he had been
intranced. Pallet, concluding that he was under
the power of some convulsion, endeavoured to
force the door open, and the noise of his efforts
recalled the doctor from his reverie. This poe∣tical
republican, being so disagreeably disturbed,
started up in a passion, and opening the door, no
sooner perceived who had interrupted him, than
he flung it in his face with great fury, and cursed
<PB N="215" REF="224"/>
him for his impertinent intrusion, which had
deprived him of the most delightful vision that
ever regaled the human fancy. He imagined,
(as he afterwards imparted to Peregrine) that
as he enjoyed himself in walking though the
flowery plain that borders on Parnassus, he was
met by a venerable sage, whom, by a certain
divine vivacity that lightened from his eyes,
he instantly knew to be the immortal Pindar.
He was immediately struck with reverence and
awe, and prostrated himself before the appari∣tion,
which taking him by the hand, lifted him
gently from the ground; and with words more
sweet than the honey of the Hybla bees, told
him, that of all the moderns, he alone was visited
by that celestial impulse by which himself had
been inspired, when he produced his most ap∣plauded
odes. So saying, he led him up the
sacred hill, persuaded him to drink a copious
draught of the waters of the Hippocrene, and
then presented him to the harmonious nine, who
crowned his temples with a laurel-wreath.</P>
<P>No wonder then, that he was enraged to find
himself cut off from such sublime society. He
raved in Greek against the invader, who was so
big with his own purpose, that, unmindful of the
disgrace he had sustained, and disregarding all the
symptoms of the physician's displeasure, he ap∣plied
his mouth to the door, and in eager tone,
“I'll hold you any wager (said he) that I guess
the true cause of Mr. Pickle's imprisonment.”
To this challenge he received no reply; and
therefore repeated it, adding, “I suppose you
imagine he was taken up for fighting a duel, or
affronting a nobleman, or lying with some man's
wife, or some such matter; but, agad! you was
<PB N="216" REF="225"/>
never more mistaken in your life; and I'll lay
my Cleopatra against your Homer's head, that in
four and twenty hours you shan't light on the
true reason.”</P>
<P>The favourite of the muses, exasperated at this
vexatious perseverance of the painter, who he
imagined had come thither to teize and insult
him, “I would (said he) sacrifice a cock to
AEsculapius, were I assured that any person had
been taken up for extirpating such a troublesome
Goth as you are from the face of the earth; and
as for your boasted Cleopatra, which you say
was drawn from your own wife, I believe the
copy has as much of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as the original.
But, were it mine, it should be hung up in the
temple of Cloacina, as the picture of that god∣dess;
for any other apartment would be disgraced
by its appearance.” “Hark ye, Sir, (replied
Pallet, enraged in his turn at this contemptuous
mention of his darling performance) you may
make as free with my wife as you think proper;
but 'ware my works, those are the children of
my fancy, conceived by the glowing imagina∣tion,
and formed by the art of my own hands:
and you yourself are a Goth, and a Turk, and
a Tartar, and an impudent pretending jack∣anapes,
to treat with such disrespect a production
which, in the opinions of all the connoisseurs of
the age, will, when finished, be a master-piece
in its kind, and do honour to human genius and
skill. So I say again and again, (and I care
not though your friend Playtor heard me) that
you have no more taste than a drayman's horse,
and that those foolish notions of the ancients
ought to be drubb'd out of you with a good
cudgel, that you might learn to treat men of parts
<PB N="217" REF="226"/>
with more veneration. Perhaps you may not al∣ways
be in the company of one who will hollow
for assistance, when you are on the brink of be∣ing
chastised for your insolence, as I did, when
you brought upon yourself the resentment of that
Scot, who, by the Lard! would have paid you
both scot and lot, as Falstaf says, if the French
officer had not put him in arrest.”</P>
<P>The physician to this declamation, which was
conveyed through the key-hole, answered, that
he (the painter) was a fellow so infinitely below
his consideration, that his conscience upbraided
him with no action of his life, except that of
choosing such a wretch for his companion and
fellow-traveller. That he had viewed his cha∣racter
through the medium of good nature and
compassion, which had prompted him to give
Pallet an opportunity of acquiring some new ideas
under his immediate instruction; but he had
abused his goodness and condescension in such a
flagrant manner, that he was now determined to
discard him intirely from his acquaintance, and
desired him, for the present, to take himself
away, on pain of being kicked for his presump∣tion.</P>
<P>Pallet was too much incensed to be intimidated
by this threat, which he retorted with great viru∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce,
defying him to come forth, that it might
appear which of them was best skilled in that pe∣destrian
exercise which he immediately began to
practise against the door with such thundering ap∣plication,
as reached the ears of Pickle and his go∣vernor,
who coming out into the passage, and
seeing him thus employed, asked if he had forgot
the chamber-pots of Alost, that he ventured to
<PB N="218" REF="227"/>
behave in such a manner, as intitled him to a se∣cond
prescription of the same nature.</P>
<P>The doctor understanding that there was com∣pany
at hand, opened the door in a twinkling,
and springing upon his antagonist, like a tyger, a
fierce contention would have ensued, to the in∣finite
satisfaction of our hero, had not Jolter, to
the manifest peril of his own person, interposed,
and partly by force, and partly by exhortations,
put a stop to the engagement before it was fairly
begun. After having demonstrated the indecency
of such a vulgar rencounter betwixt two fellow-citizens
in a foreign land, he begg'd to know the
cause of their dissention, and offered his good of∣fices
towards an accommodation. Peregrine also,
seeing the fray was finished, expressed himself to
the same purpose; and the painter, for obvious
reasons, declining an explanation, his antagonist
told the youth what a mortifying interruption he
had suffered by the impertinent intrusion of Pal∣let,
and gave him a detail of the particulars of his
vision, as above recited. The arbiter owned, the
provocation was not to be endured, and decreed,
that the offender should make some atonement
for his transgression. Upon which the painter ob∣served,
that howsoever he might have been dis∣posed
to make acknowledgments, if the physician
had signified his displeasure like a gentleman, the
complainant had now forfeited all claim to any
such concessions, by the vulgar manner in which
he had reviled him and his productions; observing,
that if he (the painter) had been inclined to re∣tort
his slanderous insinuations, the republican's
own works would have afforded ample subject for
his ridicule and censure.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="228"/>
After divers disputes and representations, peace
was at length concluded, on condition, that for
the future the doctor should never mention Cleo∣patra,
unless he could say something in her praise;
and that Pallet, in consideration of his having
been the first aggressor, should make a sketch of
the physician's vision, to be engraved and pre∣fixed
to the next edition of his odes.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine renews his inquiries about his lost Amanda,
in the course of which he is engaged in an in∣trigue
with a nun, which produces strange conse∣quences.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH this treaty was concluded at
the instances of Peregrine and his gover∣nor,
it was impossible that a lasting friendship
could subsist between the two parties, because
they entertained for each other the most perfect
contempt, which, in the course of their commu∣nication,
could not fail to minister daily food for
animosity and aversion.</P>
<P>Our adventurer's next care was to exercise all
his diligence and invention to find his lost Amanda,
who, now that he was detached from Mrs. Horn∣beck,
resumed the full possession of his thoughts.
As she would never tell him her own name, or
that of her mother, his inquiries were directed by
a personal description only; and that, in such a
populous city as Brussels, could tend but very
little to his satisfaction. He not only ordered his
valet de chambre to exert his whole address, in
order to discover the place of her abode, but this
dexterous minister, who was very well acquainted
in that city, retained half a dozen of noted pimps
<PB N="220" REF="229"/>
for the same purpose, who were directed to em∣ploy
their researches for a very handsome young
lady, of the middle stature, with fine black eyes,
and teeth as white as snow, a native of Brussels,
though married to a French gentleman, and lately
arrived from her husband's house on a visit to her
mother, who was dangerously ill.</P>
<P>Thus instructed, they put themselves in mo∣tion,
while the lover in person frequented the
court, the opera, the churches, public walks, and
every place where he thought there was the least
probability of seeing her. The description his
Mercury had given to the understrappers of gal∣lantry,
in a good measure suited several ladies in
town, whom Peregrine found means to see, in
consequence of the reports he had received; but
he could not recognize his dear fellow-traveller
among the number. At last one of his terriers
gave the valet de chambre to understand, that at
the grate of a certain nunnery, he had observed
a beautiful young creature, who resembled the
picture he had drawn, and that upon inquiry, he
found she had not taken the veil; but her mother
being lately dead, had entered as a pensionaire,
until her family-affairs could be adjusted.</P>
<P>This piece of intelligence was no sooner com∣municated
to our hero, than he flew in the ut∣most
impatience to the nunnery, and, without al∣lowing
himself to believe that this boarder could
be any other than the object of his pursuit, de∣sired
the portress to tell the young lady who was
lately admitted, that one of her relations begg'd
to speak with her at the grate. He had not waited
five minutes, when this nymph appeared; and
though he found his expectation disappointed, he
was so struck with the charms of this new figure,
<PB N="221" REF="230"/>
that his heart throbbed when she approached;
and after he had asked pardon for the liberty he
had taken, and explained the nature of his mi∣stake,
he could not help telling her, that he
thought himself fortunate in the misinformation
he had received, since it was attended with the
pleasure of seeing such an amiable young lady.
To this compliment she replied with great spirit
and good humour, that encouraged the youth to
continue the conversation, during which he pro∣fessed
himself her admirer; and when, for the
sake of decorum, he was obliged to take his leave,
earnestly begg'd he might be allow'd to repeat his
visit: and having obtained this permission, and
the knowledge of her name, returned to his lodg∣ings
in full confidence of bringing this intrigue to
a prosperous issue.</P>
<P>Nor had the young gentleman in this case over-rated
his own success: the lady happened to be
of a very amorous complexion, and her passions
being inflamed rather than mortified, by the re∣stramt
in which she lived, she was captivated by
the person of Peregrine, and his insinuating ad∣dress
had confirmed his conquest. He did not fail
to be at the grate next day, where he urged his
suit with such irresistible recommendations, that
she confessed a mutual flame, after having ob∣served,
that the circumstances of her situation
would not permit her to protract that acknow∣ledgment
in the usual form. He received this
confession with transport, as the effusion of an
ingenuous mind, that soars above all the little arts
and disguises of the sex; and intreated her to tell
him when or where he should have the happiness
of conversing with her, without the interposition
of these invidious bars.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="231"/>
She gave him to understand, that as her friends
had put her under the direction of a severe ab∣bess,
it would be impossible for her to go abroad
without the connivance of the portress, and
equally impracticable for him to gain admittance
into the convent, without running a manifest risk
of being discovered, and consequently punished
with the utmost severity.</P>
<P>When a fair lady was in the case, our adven∣turer
despised all danger, and spared no expence.
Thus informed, he studied the disposition of the
old sister who kept the keys; and in her appear∣ance
and conversation, distinguished the impla∣cable
rancour of a woman who had spent her
youth in all the mortification of detested celibacy.
She bore a most inveterate grudge to all her ju∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ors,
who still remained within the possibility of
enjoying those pleasures from which she was eter∣nal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
cut off, and observed all the young men
who appeared at the grate with the most envious
suspicion. Not even the power of all-persuading
gold could tame the spite, or soften the vigilant
asperity of this indomitable maiden.</P>
<P>Our lover tampered with her in vain; nay,
she threatened to inform the abbess of his sacri∣legious
attempt, that he might, for the future,
be excluded from the privilege of speaking to the
nuns: and, for the first time, he found the art
of corruption ineffectual. Baffled in this endea∣vour,
he conferred with his mistress about some
other means of procuring an unrestricted inter∣view;
and she, in the fertility of her invention,
proposed, that he should make it his business to
find some woman, who, by her acquaintance in
the convent, would introduce him in a female
dress, as a stranger desirous of seeing the oeconomy
<PB N="223" REF="232"/>
of the house. The expedient was wonderfully
relished by the gallant, who had immediate re∣course
to the assistance of his valet de chambre,
by whom he was next day made acquainted with
a certain good-natured gentlewoman, who, for
an handsome consideration, undertook the task.
From this good lady's wardrobe he was accord∣ingly
accommodated with a proper suit, which,
on account of his stature, was pieced for the pur∣pose:
and his mistress being previously prepared
with the knowledge of their intention, he set out
in the afternoon with his conductress, who had
interest enough to obtain his admission, on pre∣tence
of his being an English lady, just arrived
from her own country, and curious to see the me∣nage
and accommodations of a nunnery. Though
the alteration of his dress, and a pair of artificial
eye-brows, screened him from the penetrating
eye of the portress, there was something so re∣markably
singular in his make, stature, counte∣nance
and mien, that the sisters gazed upon him
as a prodigy; and he could hear them, as he
passed, asking of each other, with expressions of
astonishment, if all the women in England made
such a strange appearance.</P>
<P>Having visited the cells and chapel, his charmer
officiously offered her service in conducting the
stranger to the garden; and after having attended
them in walking several turns, invited them to
repose in a small arbour, that stood at one corner,
in the middle of a tust of trees, which rendered it
impervious to the view. The old gentlewoman
understanding the hint, accompanied the lovers
to the entrance of this grove, where she left
them, on pretence of being still unwearied with
the exercise of her legs; and their mutual raptures
<PB N="224" REF="233"/>
in this stolen interview began to rise to a very
interesting pitch, when they were alarmed by the
rustling of the leaves behind them; and turning
their eyes towards the place, perceived they were
discovered by a nun, who, either by accident or
design, had concealed herself in the thicket, until,
scandalized by their behaviour, she thought it
high time to signify her presence.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted that our hero and his
mistress were grievously disconcerted on this oc∣casion.
The lady cried she was undone, and had
almost fainted with fear, which was not at all
without foundation, considering that not only
her reputation, but even her life was at stake.
Peregrine, though he could easily have made his
escape over the garden-wall, had too much gal∣lantry
to leave his charmer and friend in such a
dangerous dilemma; and therefore, with ad∣mirable
presence of mind, advanced to the au∣thor
of his perplexity, and without any cere∣mony
or courtship, found means to make her a
party in the secret, before she could recollect her∣self
so far as to find fault with his proceeding.</P>
<P>This measure re-established the tranquillity of
the scene: the two ladies embraced as sisters, and
vowed eternal friendship on the spot; and the
young gentleman having protested that he would
share his affection between them, and practise
the same method of visiting them in a few days,
rejoined his directress, and returned in safety to
his own lodgings, being but indifferently satisfied
with the adventure of the day, by which he found
himself obliged, either to forego all correspon∣dence
with the woman he loved, or carry on an
intrigue with a person who was not at all to his
<PB N="225" REF="234"/>
liking; for the attractions of the nun were by no
means inchanting.</P>
<P>He next day appeared at the grate in his own
person, and intimated his sentiments on this subject
to his mistress, who assured him, that notwith∣standing
her behaviour to the sister, in the emer∣gency
of yesterday, she would much rather be de∣barred
of his company for ever, than enjoy it
upon the terms which necessity had obliged him
to propose. She said, the reflection on what had
passed in the grove, had inspired her with such
an unconquerable aversion for that accidental ri∣val,
that she could not think of her without hate
and indignation. She wished she had run all
risks, rather than submit to such detested partition;
and vowed with great warmth, that let the con∣sequence
be what it would, she was determined
to discover the whole affair to the abbess, if ever
he should introduce himself again, in a manner
which must subject him to the knowledge and
claim of her competitor.</P>
<P>He applauded the delicacy of her sentiments,
which he swore were exactly conformable to his
own; and promised to desist from those visits that
gave her umbrage, encouraging her to hope, that
they would find some other means of settling an
intercourse, in which she should ingross his un∣divided
attention. Such a scheme was actually
the subject of his thoughts at that time; and a
youth of his fruitful imagination, assisted with the
counsels of such a consummate politician as the
valet de chambre, would undoubtedly have brought
it to maturation, had not his aim been anticipated
by an unforeseen accident, that flowed from the
partial administration of his favour. The nun
who had been indebted to chance for his addresses,
<PB N="226" REF="235"/>
was too conscious of her own inferior qualifica∣tions,
to think she could dispute the heart of our
hero with the young lady who was previously
possessed of his affection; she knew, that her
share of his good graces was altogether casual,
and that the continuance of his assiduities must
be the effect of policy and constrained complai∣sance;
yet, even on these considerations, they were
too agreeable to be given up; and therefore she
resolved to guard her privilege with the most mi∣nute
vigilance and caution. Jealousy was the
natural consequence of these suggestions: the as∣signation
in the garden, she knew, must have been
preceded by some communication; and as there was
no other opportunity of conversing with the male
sex, except that of holding a conference through
the grate, she went to the portress, with a view
of obtaining some intelligence; and pumped the
beldame so successfully, that she learnt how her
rival had that very forenoon been favoured with a
visit by a young gentleman, whom she supposed
to be no other than their common gallant. In∣flamed
with this information, she taxed the young
lady with double dealing; and scolded with such bit∣terness,
that the other, already prejudiced against
her pretensions, could no longer contain her re∣sentment,
which she uttered in contemptuous
sneers against her personal attributes; and in the
pride of her wrath declared, that she ought not
to expect another interview with her lover in the
grove; for he was already too much satiated with
her charms to return to such a banquet, and had
rel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nquished her to the chance of meeting with
another charitable meal.</P>
<P>No tygress <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>obbed of her young was ever ex∣alted
to an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gher pitch of sury than this nun,
<PB N="227" REF="236"/>
when she found herself abandoned by her lover,
and insulted in this mortifying explanation. She
darted upon her antagonist, like a hawk upon a
partridge, and with her nails disfigured that fair
face which had defrauded her of her dearest ex∣pectation.
Nor did the rival tamely bear the
barbarity of her rage; what she wanted in strength
she supplied with spirit, and twisting her hand in
the hair of the aggressor, pulled her head with
violence to the ground. The noise of this con∣tention,
increased by the cries of the combatants,
whose tongues were more active than their hands,
brought a croud of sisters to the spot; but so
fiercely were they engaged, that they neither
minded admonitions nor threats, nor paid the
least regard to their own reputation; but on the
contrary, as if they had not known that they
were surrounded by numbers, who heard every
word that proceeded from their mouths, they
made no secret of the cause of their dispute, which,
in the precipitancy of their wrath, they divulged
with all its circumstances, to the amazement of
the by-standers.</P>
<P>At length the lady abbess arrived, and what
her authority could not accomplish, was effected
by two lay-sisters, who being summoned for the
purpose, separated the rivals, who were by this
time quite exhausted with the fatigue of the battle.
Had this mutual detection been made in any
company of females, the secret would have
hardly rested among those who heard it, much less
in a convent, where so many old maidens hap∣pened
to be present. One of these antiquated de∣votees
accordingly imparted it to the superior,
who having examined into the particulars, and
found the information true, from the rash recri∣mination
<PB N="228" REF="237"/>
of the incensed parties on their trial,
considered the affair as a very serious matter,
which affected the good order and reputation of
her convent, assembled all the sisters, and ex∣horted
them to suppress the discovery, as a cir∣cumstance
injurious to the character of the house;
laid strict injunctions on the portress, to be very
cautious for the future in the discharge of her of∣fice,
delivered over the backsliding nun to a se∣vere
penance prescribed by her ghostly father, and
that very day sent her boarder back to her rela∣tions,
with a hint of what had happened, and
an advice to dispose of her in some remote nun∣nery,
where she would be less exposed to the ma∣chinations
of her gallant.</P>
<P>Our lover, utterly ignorant of this unlucky
fray and its consequence, was confounded when
the wrinkled turnkey refused to admit him to the
grate, telling him, that his impious contrivance
had come to light; that the lewd young woman,
for whose sake he had been guilty of such a flagrant
crime, was banished from the convent; and that
if ever he should make another attempt to disturb
the tranquillity of their retreat, a formal com∣plaint
would be preferred against him to the civil
magistrate.</P>
<P>Thunderstruck with this reception, he did not
think proper to advance any thing in his own
vindication, but retreated with all convenient dis∣patch,
not ill pleased at the issue of an adventure
which might have proved not only disagreeable,
but cangerous in the highest degree. He at once
conjectured, that the mutual jealousy of the la∣dies
had betrayed the intrigue; and imagined,
that now his charmer was delivered from the re∣strictions
of a convent, she would be more ac∣cessible
<PB N="229" REF="238"/>
to his endeavours. On this supposition,
he sent his couriers upon the scout; and as he
knew her name, it was not long before he learnt,
from their artful inquiries, that immediately after
her dismission from one nunnery, she had been
entered in another at Ghent, in consequence of
the superior's advice, and in all likelihood would
be compelled to take the veil by her guardians,
who were remarkably zealous for the welfare of
her soul.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The travellers depart for Antwerp, at which place
the painter gives a loose to his enthusiasm.</HEAD>
<P>OUR adventurer thus deprived of an agree∣able
correspondence, and baffled in all his
efforts to retrieve the other object of his passion,
yielded at length to the remonstrances of his go∣vernor
and fellow-travellers, who, out of pure
complaisance to him, had exceeded their intended
stay by six days at least: and a couple of post∣chaises,
with three riding-horses, being hired,
they departed from Brussels in the morning, dined
at Mechlin, and arrived about eight in the even∣ing
at the venerable city of Antwerp. During
this day's journey, Pallet was elevated to an un∣common
flow of spirits, with the prospect of see∣ing
the birth place of Rubens, for whom he pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed
an enthusiastic admiration. He swore, that
the pleasure he felt was equal to that of a Mussul∣man,
on the last day of his pilgrimage to Mecca;
and that he already considered himself a native of
Antwerp, being so intimately acqainted with
their so justly boasted citizen, from whom, at cer∣tain
<PB N="230" REF="239"/>
junctures, he could not help believing him∣self
derived, because his own pencil adopted the
manner of that great man with surprising facility,
and his face wanted nothing but a pair of
whiskers and a beard to exhibit the express image
of the Fleming's countenance. He told them,
he was so proud of this resemblance, that in order
to render it more striking, he had at one time of his
life resolved to keep his face sacred from the razor;
and in that purpose had persevered, notwithstand∣ing
the continual reprehensions of Mrs. Pallet,
who being then with child, said, his aspect was
so hideous, that she dreaded a miscarriage every
hour, until she threatened, in plain terms, to
dispute the sanity of his intellects, and apply to
the chancellor for a committee.</P>
<P>The doctor on this occasion observed, that a
man who is not proof against the solicitations of
a woman, can never expect to make a great fi∣gure
in life; that painters and poets ought to cul∣tivate
no wives but the muses; or if they are, by
the accidents of fortune, incumbered with fami∣lies,
they should carefully guard against that per∣nicious
weakness, falsely honoured with the ap∣pellation
of <HI>natural affection,</HI> and pay no manner
of regard to the impertinent customs of the world,
“Granting that you had been for a short time
deemed a lunatic, (said he) you might have ac∣quitted
yourself honourably of that imputation,
by some performance that would have raised your
character above all censure. Sophocles himself,
that celebrated tragic poet, who for the sweetness
of his versisication, was stiled <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>the bee,</HI>
in his old age suffered the same accusation from
his own children, who seeing him neglect his
family affairs, and devote himself intirely to poe∣try,
<PB N="231" REF="240"/>
carried him before the magistrate, as a man
whose intellects were so much impaired by the
infirmities of age, that he was no longer fit to
manage his domestic concerns; upon which the
reverend bard produced his tragedy of <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
as a work he had just finished; which
being perused, instead of being declared unsound
of understanding, he was dismissed with admira∣tion
and applause. I wish your beard and whiskers
had been sanctioned by the like authority; though
I am afraid you would have been in the predica∣ment
of those disciples of a certain philosopher,
who drank decoctions of cummin-seeds, that their
faces might adopt the paleness of their master's
complexion, hoping, that in being as wan, they
would be as learned as their teacher.” The
painter, stung with this sarcasm, replied, “or
like those Virtuosi, who by repeating Greek, eat∣ing
fillikickaby, and pretending to see visions,
think they equal the ancients in taste and genius.”
The physician retorted, Pallet rejoined, and the
altercation continued, until they entered the gates
of Antwerp, when the admirer of Rubens broke
forth into a rapturous exclamation, which put an
end to the dispute, and attracted the notice of
the inhabitants, many of whom, by shrugging up
their shoulders, and pointing to their foreheads,
gave shrewd indications, that they believed him a
poor gentleman disordered in his brain.</P>
<P>They had no sooner alighted at the inn, than
this pseudo-enthusiast proposed to visit the great
church, in which he had been informed some of
his master's pieces were to be seen; and was re∣markably
chagrined, when he understood that he
could not be admitted till next day. He rose next
morning by day-break, and disturbed his fellow-travellers
<PB N="232" REF="241"/>
in such a noisy and clamorous manner,
that Peregrine determined to punish him with
some new infliction, and while he put on his
cloaths, actually formed the plan of promoting
a duel between him and the doctor; in the ma∣nagement
of which he promised himself store of
entertainment, from the behaviour of both.</P>
<P>Being provided with one of those domestics
who are always in waiting to offer their services
to strangers on their first arrival, they were con∣ducted
to the house of a gentleman who had an
excellent collection of pictures; and though the
greatest part of them were painted by his fa∣vourite
artist, Pallet condemned them all by the
lump, because Pickle had told him beforehand,
that there was not one performance of Rubens
among the number.</P>
<P>The next place they visited, was what is
called the academy of painting, furnished with a
number of paultry pieces, in which our painter
recognized the stile of Peter Paul, with many
expressions of admiration, on the same sort of
previous intelligence.</P>
<P>From this repository they went to the great
church, and being led to the tomb of Rubens,
the whimsical painter fell upon his knees, and
worshipped, with such appearance of devotion,
that the attendant, scandalized at his superstition,
pulled him up, observing with great warmth,
that the person buried in that place was no saint,
but as great a sinner as himself; and that if he
was spiritually disposed, there was a chapel of the
Blessed Virgin, at the distance of three yards on
the right hand, to which he might retire. He
thought it was incumbent upon him to manifest
some extraordinary inspiration, while he resided
<PB N="233" REF="242"/>
on the spot where Rubens was born; and there∣fore,
his whole behaviour was an affectation of
rapture, expressed in distracted exclamations, con∣vulsive
starts, and uncouth gesticulations. In the
midst of this frantic behaviour, he saw an old
Capuchin, with a white beard, mount the pul∣pit,
and hold forth to the congregation with such
violence of emphasis and gesture, as captivated his
fancy; and bawling aloud, “Zounds! what an
excellent Paul preaching at Athens!” he pulled
a pencil and small memorandum-book from his
pocket, and began to take a sketch of the orator,
with great eagerness and agitation, saying, “Egad!
friend Raphael, we shall see whether you or I
have got the best knack at trumping up an Apo∣stle.”
This appearance of disrespect gave offence
to the audience, which began to murmur against
this heretic libertine; when one of the priests
belonging to the choir, in order to prevent any
ill consequence from their displeasure, came and
told him in the French language, that such liber∣ties
were not permitted in their religion, and ad∣vised
him to lay aside his implements, left the
people should take umbrage at his design, and be
provoked to punish him as a profane scoffer at
their worship.</P>
<P>The painter seeing himself addressed by a friar,
who, while he spoke, bowed with great com∣plaisance,
imagined that he was a begging bro∣ther
come to supplicate his charity; and his at∣tention
being quite ingrossed by the design he was
making, he patted the priest's shaven crown with
his hand, saying, <HI>Oter tems, oter tems;</HI> and then
resumed his pencil with great earnestness. The
ecclesiastic perceiving that the stranger did not
comprehend his meaning, pulled him by the sleeve,
<PB N="234" REF="243"/>
and explained himself in the Latin tongue: upon
which, Pallet, provoked at his intrusion, cursed
him aloud for an impudent beggarly son of a
whore; and taking out a schelling, flung it upon
the pavement, with manifest signs of indigna∣tion.</P>
<P>Some of the common people, enraged to see
their religion contemned, and their priests in∣sulted
at the very altar, rose from their seats, and
surrounding the astonished painter, one of the
number snatched his book from his hand, and
tore it into a thousand pieces. Frightened as he
was, he could not help crying, “Fire and fag∣gots!
all my favourite ideas are gone to wreck!”
and was in danger of being very roughly handled
by the croud, had not Peregrine stepped in, and
assured them, that he was a poor unhappy gen∣tleman,
who laboured under a transport of the
brain. Those who understood the French lan∣guage
communicated this information to the rest;
so that he escaped without any other chastise∣ment,
than that of being obliged to retire. And
as they could not see the famous descent from the
cross till after the service was finished, they were
conducted by their domestique to the house of a
painter, where they found a beggar standing for
his picture, and the artist actually employed in
representing a huge louse that crawled upon his
shoulder. Pallet was wonderfully pleased with
this circumstance, which he said was altogether
a new thought, and an excellent hint, of which
he would make his advantage: and in the course
of his survey of this Fleming's performances,
perceiving a piece in which two flies were en∣gaged
upon the carcase of a dog half devoured,
he ran to his brother brush, and swore he was
<PB N="235" REF="244"/>
worthy of being a fellow-citizen of the immortal
Rubens. He then lamented, with many expres∣sions
of grief and resentment, that he had lost
his common place-book, in which he had pre∣served
a thousand conceptions of the same sort,
formed by the accidental objects of his senses and
imagination; and took an opportunity of telling
his fellow-travellers, that in execution he had
equalled, if not excelled, the two ancient painters
who vied with each other in the representation of
a curtain and a bunch of grapes; for he had ex∣hibited
the image of a certain object so like to na∣ture,
that the bare sight of it set a whole hog-sty
in an upr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar.</P>
<P>When he had examined and applauded all the
productions of this minute artist, they returned
to the great church, and were entertained with
the view of that celebrated master-piece of Ru∣bens,
in which he has introduced the portraits of
himself and his whole family. The doors that
conceal this capital performance were no sooner
unfolded, than our enthusiast, debarred the use
of speech, by a previous covenant with his friend
Pickle, lifted up his hands and eyes, and putting
himself in the attitude of Hamlet, when his fa∣ther's
ghost appears, adored in silent extasy and
awe. He even made a merit of necessity; and
when they had withdrawn from the place, pro∣tested
that his whole faculties were swallowed up
in love and admiration. He now professed him∣self
more than ever enamoured of the Flemish
school, raved in extravagant encomiums, and
proposed, that the whole company should pay
homage to the memory of the divine Rubens, by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epairing forthwith to the house in which he
<PB N="236" REF="245"/>
lived, and prostrating themselves on the floor of
his painting room.</P>
<P>As there was nothing remarkable in the tene∣ment,
which had been rebuilt more than once
since the death of that great man, Peregrine ex∣cused
himself from complying with the proposal,
on pretence of being fatigued with the circuit
they had already performed. Jolter declined it
for the same reason; and the question being put
to the doctor, he refused his company with an air
of disdain. Pallet, piqued at his contemptuous
manner, asked if he would not go and see the
habitation of Pindoor, provided he was in the city
where that poet lived? And when the physician
observed, that there was an infinite difference be∣tween
the man; “That I'll allow, (replied the
painter) for the devil a poet ever lived in Greece
or Troy, that was worthy to clean the pencils of
our beloved Rubens.” The physician could not
with any degree of temper and forbearance hear
this outrageous blasphemy, for which, he said,
Pallet's eyes ought to be picked out by owls:
and the dispute rose, as usual, to such scurrilities
of language and indecency of behaviour, that
passengers began to take notice of their animo∣sity;
and Peregrine was obliged to interpose, for
his own credit.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine artfully foments a quarrel between Pallet
and the physician, who fight a duel on the
ramparts.</HEAD>
<P>THE painter betook himself to the house of
the Flemish Raphael, and the rest of the
company went back to their lodgings; where the
young gentleman, taking the advantage of being
alone with the physician, recapitulated all the af∣fronts
he had sustained from the painter's petu∣lance,
aggravating every circumstance of the dis∣grace,
and advising him, in the capacity of a
friend, to take care of his honour, which could
not fail to suffer in the opinion of the world, if
he allowed himself to be insulted with impunity,
by one so much his inferior in every degree of
consideration.</P>
<P>The physician assured him, that Pallet had hi∣therto
escaped chastisement, by being deemed an
object unworthy his resentment, and in conside∣ration
of the wretch's family, for which his com∣passion
was interested; but, that repeated inju∣ries
would inflame the most benevolent dispo∣sition:
and although he could find no precedent
of duelling among the Greeks and Romans, whom
he considered as the patterns of demeanour, Pallet
should no longer avail himself of his veneration
for the ancients, but be punished for the very
next offence he should commit.</P>
<P>Having thus spirited up the doctor to a resolu∣tion
from which he could not decently swerve, our
adventurer acted the incendiary with the other party
also; giving him to understand, that the phy∣sician
<PB N="238" REF="247"/>
treated his character with such contempt,
and behaved to him with such insolence, as no
gentleman ought to bear: that for his own part,
he was every day put out of countenance by their
mutual animosity, which appeared in nothing but
vulgar expressions, more becoming shoe-boys and
oyster-women than men of honour and educa∣tion;
and therefore he should be obliged, con∣trary
to his inclination, to break off all corre∣spondence
with them both, if they would not fall
upon some method to retrieve the dignity of their
characters.</P>
<P>These representations would have had little effect
upon the timidity of the painter, who was like∣wise
too much of a Grecian to approve of single
combat, in any other way than that of boxing,
an exercise in which he was well skill'd, had not
they been accompanied with an insinuation, that
his antagonist was no Hector, and that he might
humble him into any concession, without running
the least personal risk. Animated by this assurance,
our second Rubens set the trumpet of defiance to
his mouth, swore that he valued not his life a
rush, when his honour was concerned, and in∣treated
Mr. Pickle to be the bearer of a chal∣lenge,
which he would instantly commit to
writing.</P>
<P>The mischievous fomentor highly applauded
this manisestation of courage, by which he was
at liberty to cultivate his friendship and society;
but declined the office of carrying the billet, that
his tendernes, of Pallet's reputation might not be
misinterpreted into an officious desire of pro∣moting
quarrels. At the sametime he recommended
Tom Pipes, not only as a very proper messenger
on this occasion, but also as a trusty second in
the field. The magnanimous painter took his

advice, and retiring to his chamber, penn'd a

<P>This resolute defiance, after having been sub∣mitted

delivered it in the afternoon; and brought for

evidently discomposed at the unexpected news of
this acceptance, and ran about the house in great
disorder, in quest of Peregrine, to beg his further
advice and assistance; but, understanding that the
youth was engaged in private with his adversary,
he began to suspect some collusion, and cursed
himself for his folly and precipitation. He even
entertained some thoughts of retracting his invi∣tation,
and submitting to the triumph of his an∣tagonist:
<PB N="240" REF="249"/>
but, before he would stoop to this op∣probrious
condescension, he resolved to try an∣other
expedient, which might be the means of
saving both his character and person. In this
hope he visited Mr. Jolter, and very gravely de∣sired
he would be so good as to undertake the of∣fice
of his second, in a duel which he was to
fight that evening with the physician.</P>
<P>The governor, instead of answering his ex∣pectation,
in expressing fear and concern, and
breaking forth into exclamations of, “Good
God! gentlemen, what d'ye mean? You shall
not murther one another, while it is in my power
to prevent your purpose. I will go directly to
the governor of the place, who shall interpose his
authority.” I say, instead of these and other
friendly menaces of prevention, Jolter heard the
proposal with the most phlegmatic tranquillity,
and excused himself from accepting the honour
he intended for him, on account of his character
and situation, which would not permit him to be
concerned in any such rencounters. Indeed this
mortifying reception was owing to a previous hint
from Peregrine, who dreading some sort of in∣terruption
from his governor, had made him ac∣quainted
with his design, and assured him, that
the affair should not be brought to any dangerous
issue.</P>
<P>Thus disappointed, the dejected challenger was
overwhelmed with perplexity and dismay; and in
the terrors of death or mutilitation, resolved to
deprecate the wrath of his enemy, and conform
to any submission he should propose; when he was
accidentally encountered by our adventurer, who
with demonstrations of infinite satisfaction, told
him in confidence, that his billet had thrown the
<PB N="241" REF="250"/>
doctor into an agony of consternation; and that
his acceptance of his challenge was a meer effort
of despair, calculated to confound the ferocity
of the sender, and dispose him to listen to terms
of accommodation: that he had imparted the
letter to him with fear and trembling, on pre∣tence
of engaging him as a second, but in reality,
with a view of obtaining his good offices in pro∣moting
a reconciliation; “but, perceiving the
situation of his mind, (added our hero) I thought
it would be more for your honour to baffle his
expectation; and therefore I readily undertook
the task of attending him to the field, in full as∣surance,
that he will there humble himself before
you, even to prostration. In this security, you
may go and prepare your arms, and bespeak the
assistance of Pipes, who will squire you in the
field, while I keep myself up, that our corre∣spondence
may not be suspected by the physician.”
Pallet's spirits, that were sunk to dejection, rose
at this encouragement to all the insolence of tri∣umph;
he again declared his contempt of danger,
and his pistols being loaded and accommodated
with new flints, by his trusty armour-bearer, he
waited, without flinching, for the hour of battle.</P>
<P>On the first approach of twilight, somebody
knocked at his door, and Pipes having opened it
at his desire, he heard the voice of his antagonist
pronounce, “Tell Mr. Pallet, that I am going
to the place of appointment.” The painter was
not a little surprized at this anticipation, which
so ill agreed with the information he had received
from Pickle; and his concern beginning to re∣cur,
he fortified himself with a large bumper of
brandy, which, however, did not overcome the
anxiety of his thoughts. Nevertheless, he set
<PB N="242" REF="251"/>
out on the expedition with his second, betwixt
whom and himself the following dialogue passed,
in their way to the ramparts. “Mr. Pipes, (said
the painter, with disordered accent) methinks the
doctor was in a pestilent hurry with that message
of his.” “Ey, ey, (answered Tom) I do sup∣pose
he longs to be foul of you.” “What!
(replied the other) d'ye think he thirsts after my
blood?” “To be sure a does,” (said Pipes,
thrusting a large quid of tobacco in his cheek,
with great deliberation.) “If that be the case,
(cried Pallet, beginning to shake) he is no better
than a Cannibal, and no Christian ought to fight
him on equal footing.” Tom observing his
emotion, eyed him with a frown of indignation,
saying, “You an't afraid, are you?” “God
forbid! (replied the challenger, stammering with
fear.) What should I be afraid of? The worst
he can do, is to take my life, and then he'll be
answerable both to God and man for the murder:
Don't you think he will?” “I think no such
matter, (answered the second) if so be as how he
puts a brace of bullets through your bows, and kills
you fairly, it is no more murder than if I was to
bring down a noddy from the main-top-sail-yard.”
By this time, Pallet's teeth chattered with such
violence, that he could scarce pronounce this
reply, “Mr. Thomas, you seem to make very
light of a man's life; but I trust in the Almighty,
I shall not be so easily brought down. Sure many
a man has fought a duel, without losing his life.
Do you imagine that I run such a hazard of fall∣ing
by the hand of my adversary?” You may,
or you may not, (said the unconcerned Pipes) just
as it happens. What then? Death is a debt that
every man owes, according to the song; and if
<PB N="243" REF="252"/>
you set foot to foot, I think one of you must go
to pot.” “Foot to foot! (exclaimed the terri∣fied
painter) that's downright butchery; and I'll
be damn'd before I sight any man on earth in
such a barbarous way. What! d'ye take me to
be a savage beast?” This declaration he made
while they ascended the ramparts; and his atten∣dant
perceiving the physician and his second at the
distance of an hundred paces before them, gave
him notice of their appearance, and advised him
to make ready, and behave like a man. Pallet
in vain endeavoured to conceal his pannic, which
discovered itself in an universal trepidation of bo∣dy,
and the lamentable tone in which he an∣swered
this exhortation of Pipes; saying, “I do
behave like a man; but you would have me act
the part of a brute. Are they coming this way?”
When Tom told him that they had faced about,
and admonished him to advance, the nerves of
his arm refused their office, he could not hold out
his pistol, and instead of going forward, retreated
with an insensibility of motion; till Pipes, placing
himself in the rear, set his own back to that of
his principal, and swore he should not budge an
inch farther in that direction.</P>
<P>While the valet thus tutored the painter, his
master enjoyed the terrors of the physician, which
were more ridiculous than those of Pallet, be∣cause
he was more intent upon disguising them.
His declaration to Pickle in the morning, would
not suffer him to start any objections when he re∣ceived
the challenge; and finding that the young
gentleman made no offer of mediating the affair,
but rather congratulated him on the occasion,
when he communicated the painter's billet, all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> efforts consisted in oblique hints, and general
<PB N="244" REF="253"/>
reflections upon the absurdity of duelling, which
was first introduced among civilized nations, by
the barbarous Huns and Longobards. He like∣wise
pretended to ridicule the use of fire-arms,
which confounded all the distinctions of skill and
address, and deprived a combatant of the oppor∣tunity
of signalizing his personal prowess.</P>
<P>Pickle assented to the justness of his observa∣tions;
but at the same time represented the ne∣cessity
of complying with the customs of the
world, (ridiculous as they were) on which a
man's honour and reputation depend. So that,
seeing no hopes of profiting by that artifice, the
republican's agitation became more and more re∣markable;
and he proposed in plain terms, that
they should contend in armour, like the com∣batants
of ancient days; for it was but reasonable,
that they should practise the manner of fighting,
since they adopted the disposition of those iron
times.</P>
<P>Nothing could have afforded more diversion to
our hero, than the sight of two such duellists
cased in iron; and he wished that he had pro∣moted
the quarrel in Brussels, where he could
have hired the armour of Charles the fifth, and
the valiant duke of Parma, for their accommo∣dation:
but, as there was no possibility of fur∣nishing
them cap-a-pee at Antwerp, he persuaded
him to conform to the modern use of the sword,
and meet the painter on his own terms; and sus∣pecting
that his fear would supply him with other
excuses for declining the combat, he comforted
him with some distant insinuations to the preju∣dice
of his adversary's courage, which would in
all probability, evaporate, before any mischief could
happen.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="254"/>
Notwithstanding this encouragement, he could
not suppress the reluctance with which he went
to the field, and cast many a wishful look over
his left shoulder, to see whether or not his ad∣versary
was at his heels; and when, by the ad∣vice
of his second, he took possession of the
ground, and turned about with his face to the
enemy, it was not so dark, but that Peregrine
could perceive the unusual paleness of his coun∣tenance,
and the sweat standing in large drops
upon his forehead; nay, there was a manifest
disorder in his speech, when he regretted his want
of the Pila and Parma, with which he would have
made a rattling noise, to astonish his foe, in
springing forward, and singing the hymn to bat∣tle,
in the manner of the ancients.</P>
<P>In the mean time, observing the hesitation of
his antagonist, who, far from advancing, seemed
to recoil, and even struggle with his second, he
guesied the situation of the painter's thoughts;
and collecting all the manhood that he possessed,
seized the opportunity of profiting by his enemy's
consternation; and striking his sword and pistol
together, advanced in a sort of trot, raising a
loud howl, in which he repeated, in lieu of the
Spartan song, part of a strophe from one of Pin∣dar's
Pythia, beginning with <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
&amp;c. This imitation of the
Greeks had all the desired effect upon the painter,
who seeing the physician running towards him,
like a fury, with a pistol in his right hand, which
was extended, and hearing the dreadful yell he
uttered, and the outlandish words he pronounced,
was seized with an universal palsy of his limbs,
and would have dropp'd down upon the ground,
had not Pipes supported and encouraged him to
<PB N="246" REF="255"/>
stand upon his defence. The doctor, contrary
to his expectation, finding that he had not flinched
from the spot, though he had now performed
one half of his career, put in practice his last
effort, by firing his pistol, the noise of which
no sooner reached the ears of the affrighted painter,
than he recommended his soul to God, and roared
for mercy with great vociferation.</P>
<P>The republican, overjoyed at this exclama∣tion,
commanded him to yield, and surrender
his arms, on pain of immediate death; upon
which he threw away his pistols and sword, in
spite of all the admonitions and even threats of his
second, who left him to his fate, and went up to
his master, stopping his nose with signs of loath∣ing
and abhorrence.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> victor having won the Spolia Opima,
granted him his life, on condition, that he would
on his knees supplicate his pardon, acknowledge
himself inferior to his conqueror in every virtue
and qualification, and promise for the future to
merit his favour by submission and respect. These
insolent terms were readily embraced by the un∣fortunate
challenger, who fairly owned, that he
was not at all calculated for the purposes of war,
and that henceforth he would contend with no
weapon but his pencil. He begg'd with great
humility, that Mr. Pickle would not think the
worse of his morals for this defect of courage,
which was a natural infirmity inherited from his
father, and suspend his opinion of his talents,
until he should have an opportunity of contem∣plating
the charms of his Cleopatra, which would
be finished in less than three months.</P>
<P>Our hero observed with an affected air of dis∣pleasure,
that no man could be justly condemned
<PB N="247" REF="256"/>
for being subject to the impressions of fear; and
therefore his cowardice might easily be forgiven;
but, there was something so presumptuous, dis∣honest
and disingenuous, in arrogating a quality
to which he knew he had not the smallest pre∣tension,
that he could not forget his misbehaviour
all at once, though he would condescend to com∣municate
with him as formerly, in hopes of see∣ing
a reformation in his conduct. Pallet pro∣tested,
that there was no dissimulation in the
case; for he was ignorant of his own weakness,
until his resolution was put to the trial: he faith∣fully
promised to demean himself, during the re∣maining
part of the tour, with that conscious
modesty and penitence which became a person in
his condition; and, for the present, implored the
assistance of Mr. Pipes, in disembarassing him
from the disagreeable consequence of his fear.</P>

<DIV2 N="69" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The doctor exults in his victory. They set out for
Rotterdam, where they are entertained by two
Dutch gentlemen in a yacht, which is overturned
in the Maes, to the manifest hazard of the
painter's life. They spend the evening with their
entertainers, and next day visit a cabinet of cu∣riosities.</HEAD>
<P>TOM was accordingly ordered to minister
to his occasions; and the conqueror, elated
with his success, which he in a great measure at∣tributed
to his manner of attack, and the hymn
which he howled, told Peregrine, that he was
now convinced of the truth of what Pindar sung
in these words, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<PB N="248" REF="257"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; for he had no sooner begun to
repeat the mellifluent strains of that divine poet,
than the wretch his antagonist was confounded,
and his nerves unstrung.</P>
<P>On their return to the inn, he expatiated on
the prudence and tranquillity of his own beha∣viour,
and ascribed the consternation of Pallet to
the remembrance of some crime that lay heavy
upon his conscience: for, in his opinion, a man
of virtue and common sense could not possibly be
afraid of death, which is not only the peaceful
harbour that receives him shattered on the tem∣pestuous
sea of life, but also the eternal seal of
his fame and glory, which it is no longer in his
power to forfeit and forego. He lamented his
fate, in being doomed to live in such degenerate
days, when war is become a mercenary trade;
and ardently wished, that the day would come,
when he should have such an opportunity of sig∣nalizing
his courage in the cause of liberty, as
that of Marathon, where an handful of Athe∣nians,
fighting for their freedom, defeated the
whole strength of the Persian empire. “Would
to heaven! (said he) my muse were blessed with
an occasion to emulate that glorious testimony
on the trophy in Cyprus, erected by Cimon, for
two great victories gained on the same day over
the Persians by sea and land; in which it is very
remarkable, that the greatness of the occasion
has raised the manner of expression above the
usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient
inscriptions.” He then repeated it with all the
pomp of declamation, and signified his hope, that
the French would one day invade us with such an
army as that which Xerxes led into Greece, that
<PB N="249" REF="258"/>
it might be in his power to devote himself, like
Leo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>das, to the freedom of his country.</P>
<P>This memorable combat being thus deter∣mined,
and every thing that was remarkable in
Antwerp surveyed, they sent their baggage down
the Scheld to Rotterdam, and set out for the
same place in a post-waggon, which that same
evening brought them in safety to the banks of
the Maeze. They put up at an English house
of entertainment, remarkable for the modesty
and moderation of the landlord; and next morn∣ing
the doctor went in person, to deliver letters
of recommendation to two Dutch gentlemen,
from one of his acquaintance at Paris. Neither
of them happened to be at home when he called;
so that he left a message at their lodgings, with
his address; and in the afternoon they waited up∣on
the company, and after many hospitable pro∣fessions,
one of the two invited them to spend
the evening at his house.</P>
<P>Mean while, they had provided a pleasure-yacht,
in which they proposed to treat them with
an excursion upon the Maeze. This being al∣most
the only diversion that place affords, our
young gentleman relished the proposal; and not∣withstanding
the remonstrances of Mr. Jolter,
who declined the voyage on account of the rough∣ness
of the weather, they went on board with∣out
hesitation, and found a collation prepared in
the cabin. While they tacked to and fro in
the river, under the impulse of a mackerel breeze,
the physician expressed his satisfaction, and Pallet
was ravished with the entertainment. But the
wind increasing, to the unspeakable joy of the
Dutchmen, who had now an opportunity of
shewing their dexterity in the management of the
<PB N="250" REF="259"/>
vessel, the guests found it inconvenient to stand
upon deck, and impossible to sit below, on ac∣count
of the clouds of tobacco-smoke which
rolled from the pipes of their entertainers, in such
volumes as annoyed them even to the hazard of
suffocation. This fumigation, together with the
extraordinary motion of the ship, began to affect
the head and stomach of the painter, who begg'd
earnestly to be set on shore: but the Dutch gen∣tlemen,
who had no idea of his sufferings, to
which they had always been utter strangers, in∣sisted,
with surprising obstinacy of regard, upon
his staying until he should see an instance of the
skill of their mariners; and bringing him on deck,
commanded the men to carry the vessel's lee∣gunwale
under water. This nicety of navigation
they instantly performed, to the admiration of
Pickle, the discomposure of the doctor, and terror
of Pallet, who blessed himself from the courtesy
of a Dutchman, and prayed to heaven for his
deliverance.</P>
<P>While the Hollanders enjoyed the reputation
of this feat, and the distress of the painter at the
same time, the yacht was overtaken by a sudden
squall, that overset her in a moment, and flung
every man overboard into the Maeze, before
they could have the least warning of their fate,
much less, time to provide against the accident.
Peregrine, who was an expert swimmer, reached
the shore in safety; the physician, in the agonies
of despair, laid fast hold on the trunk-breeches
of one of the men, who dragged him to the
other side; the entertainers landed at the bomb-keys,
smoking their pipes all the way with great
deliberation; and the poor painter must have
gone to the bottom, had not he been encoun∣tered
<PB N="251" REF="260"/>
by the cable of a ship, that lay at anchor
near the scene of their disaster. Though his
senses had forsaken him, his hands fastened by
instinct on this providential occurrence, which
he held with such a convulsive grasp, that when
a boat was sent out to bring him on shore, it was
with the utmost difficulty that his fingers were
disengaged. He was carried into a house, de∣prived
of the use of speech, and bereft of all
sensation; and being suspended by the heels, a
vast quantity of water ran out of his mouth.
This evacuation being made, he began to utter
dreadful groans, which gradually increased to a
continued roar; and after he had regained the use
of his senses, underwent a delirium that lasted
several hours. As for the treaters, they never
dreamed of expressing the least concern to Pickle
or the physician for what had happened, because
it was an accident so common, as to pass with∣out
notice; but they were very much surprized
to find, upon inquiry, that Pallet could not
swim, it being as natural for a Dutchman, as a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal-board, to float upon the surface.</P>
<P>Leaving the care of the vessel to the seamen,
the company retired to their respective lodgings,
in order to shift their cloaths; and in the evening
our travellers were conducted to the house of
their new friend, who, with a view of making
his invitation the more agreeable, had assembled
to the number of twenty or thirty Englishmen,
of all ranks and degrees, from the merchant to
the periwig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> maker's prentice.</P>
<P>In the midst of this congregation stood a
chafing-dish with l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve-c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als, for the convenience
of lighting their pipes, and every individual was
accommodated with a spitting-box. There was
<PB N="252" REF="261"/>
not a mouth in the apartment unfurnished with
a tube, so that they resembled a convocation of
Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meras breathing fire and smoke; and our
gentlemen were fain to imitate their example in
their own defence. It is not to be supposed that
the conversation was either very sprightly or po∣lite;
the whole entertainment was of the Dutch
cast, that is, frowzy and phlegmatic: and our
adventurer, as he returned to his lodging, tor∣tured
with the head-ach, and disgusted with
every circumstance of his treatment, cursed the
hour in which the doctor had saddled them with
such troublesome companions.</P>
<P>Next morning, by eight o'clock, these polite
Hollanders returned the visit, and after breakfast,
attended their English friends to the house of a
person that possessed a very curious cabinet of
curiosities, to which they had secured our com∣pany's
admission. The owner of this collection
was a cheesemonger, who received them in a
woollen night-cap, with straps buttoned under
his chin. As he understood no language but his
own, he told them, by the canal of one of their
conductors, that he did not make a practice of
shewing his curiosities; but understanding that
they were Englishmen, and recommended to his
friends, he was content to submit them to their
perusal. So saying, he led them up a dark stair,
into a small room, decorated with a few paltry
figures in plaister of Paris, two or three mise∣rable
landschapes, the skins of an otter, seal, and
some fishes stuffed; and in one corner stood a
glass-case, furnished with newts, frogs, lizzards
and serpents, preserved in spirits; a human foetus,
a calf with two heads, and about two dozen of
butterflies pinned upon paper.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="262"/>
The virtuoso having exhibited these particulars,
eyed the strangers with a look solliciting admira∣tion
and applause; and as he could not perceive
any symptom of either in their gestures or coun∣tenances,
withdrew a curtain, and displayed a
wainscot chest of drawers, in which, he gave
them to understand, was something that would
agreeably amuse the imagination. Our travel∣lers,
regaled with this notice, imagined that they
would be entertained with the sight of some cu∣rious
medals, or other productions of antiquity;
but how were they disappointed, when they saw
nothing but a variety of shells, disposed in whim∣sical
figures, in each drawer! After he had de∣tained
them full two hours with a tedious com∣mentary
upon the shape, size and colour of each
department, he, with a supercilious simper, de∣sired
that the English gentlemen would frankly
and candidly declare, whether his cabinet, or
that of mynheer Sloane, at London, was the most
valuable. When this request was signified in
English to the company, the painter instantly ex∣claimed,
“By the Lard! they are not to be
named of a day. And as for that matter, I
would not give one corner of Saltero's coffee∣house,
at Chelsea, for all the trash he hath
shewn.” Peregrine, unwilling to mortify any
person who had done his endeavour to please
him, observed, that what they had seen was very
curious and entertaining; but that no private
collection in Europe was equal to that of Sir
Hans Sloane, which, exclusive of presents, had
cost an hundred thousand pounds. The two con∣ductors
were confounded at this asseveration,
which being communicated to the cheesemonger,
he shook his head with a significant grin; and
<PB N="254" REF="263"/>
tho' he did not choose to express his incredulity
in words, gave our hero to understand, that he
did not much depend upon his veracity.</P>
<P>From the house of this Dutch naturalist, they
were dragged all round the city, by the painful
civility of their attendants, who did not quit them
till the evening was well advanced, and then not
till after they had promised to be with them be∣fore
ten o'clock next day, in order to conduct
them to a country-house, situated in a pleasant
village on the other side of the river.</P>
<P>Pickle was already so much fatigued with their
hospitality, that, for the first time of his life, he
suffered a dejection of spirits; and resolved, at
any rate, to avoid the threatened persecution of
to-morrow: with this view, he ordered his ser∣vants
to pack up some cloaths and linnen in a
portmanteau; and in the morning embarked,
with his governor, in the Treckskuyt, for the
Hague, whither he pretended to be called by
some urgent occasion, leaving his fellow-travel∣lers
to make his apology to their friends; and
assuring them, that he would not proceed for
Amsterdam, without their society. He arrived at
the Hague in the forenoon, and dined at an ordi∣nary
frequented by officers and people of fashion;
where being informed, that the princess would see
company in the evening, he dressed himself in a
rich suit of the Parisian cut, and went to court,
without any introduction. A person of his ap∣pearance
could not fail to attract the notice of
such a small circle. The prince himself under∣standing
he was an Englishman and a stranger,
went up to him, without ceremony; and having
welcomed him to the place, conversed with him,
for some minutes, on the common topics of dis∣course.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">They proceed to the Hague; from whence they de∣part
for Amsterdam, where they see a Dutch
tragedy. Visit a musick-house, in which Pere∣grine
quarrels with the captain of a man of war.
They pass through Haarlem, in their way to
Leyden. Return to Rotterdam, where the
company separates, and our hero, with his atten∣dants,
arrives in safety at Harwich.</HEAD>
<P>BEing joined by their fellow-travellers, in the
morning, they made a tour to all the re∣markable
places in this celebrated village; saw
the Foundery, the Stadthouse, the Spinhuys,
Vauxhall, and Count Bentinck's gardens, and in
the evening went to the French comedy, which
was directed by a noted Harlequin, who had
found means to flatter the Dutch taste so effec∣tually,
that they extolled him as the greatest actor
that ever appeared in the province of Holland.
This famous company did not represent regular
theatrical pieces, but only a sort of impromptu's,
in which this noted player always performed the
greatest part of the entertainment. Among other
sallies of wit that escaped him, there was one cir∣cumstance
so remarkably adapted to the disposition
and genius of his audience, that it were pity to
pass it over in silence: A windmill being exhi∣bited
on the scene, Harlequin, after having sur∣veyed
it with curiosity and admiration, asks of
one of the millers, the use of that machine; and
being told, that it was a windmill, observes with
some concern, that as there was not the least
breath of wind, he could not have the pleasure of
<PB N="256" REF="265"/>
seeing it turn round. Urged by this considera∣tion,
he puts himself into the attitude of a per∣son
wrapt in profound meditation; and having
continued a few seconds in this posture, runs to
the miller with great eagerness and joy, and tell∣ing
him, that he had found an expedient to make
his mill work, very fairly unbuttons his breeches,
and presenting his posteriors to the sails of the ma∣chine,
certain explosions are immediately heard,
and the arms of the mill begin to turn round, to
the infinite satisfaction of the spectators, who ap∣prove
the joke with loud peals of applause.</P>
<P>Our travellers stayed a few days at the Hague,
during which the young gentleman waited on the
British embassador, to whom he was recom∣mended
by his Excellency at Paris, and lost about
thirty guineas at billiards to a French adventurer,
who decoyed him into the snare by keeping up
his game; then they departed in a post-waggon
for Amsterdam, being provided with letters of in∣troduction
to an English merchant residing in
that city, under whose auspices they visited every
thing worth seeing, and among other excursions
went to see a Dutch tragedy acted; an enter∣tainment
which, of all others, had the strangest
effect upon the organs of our hero: the dress of
their chief personages was so antick, their man∣ner
so aukwardly absurd, and their language so
ridiculously unfit for conveying the sentiments of
love and honour, that Peregrine's nerves were
diuretically affected with the complicated absur∣dity,
and he was compelled to withdraw twenty
times before the catastrophe of the piece.</P>
<P>The subject of this performance was the famous
story of Scipio's continence and virtue, in restor∣ing
<PB N="257" REF="266"/>
the fair captive to her lover. The young
Roman hero was represented by a broad-fac'd Ba∣tavian,
in a burgo-master's gown and a fur-cap,
sitting smoaking his pipe at a table furnished with
a can of beer, a drinking-glass, and a plate of
tobacco: the lady was such a person as Scipio
might very well be supposed to give away, with∣out
any great effort of generosity; and indeed the
C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltiberi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n prince seemed to be of that opinion;
for, upon receiving her from the hand of the
victor, he discovered none of those transports of
gratitude and joy which Livy describes, in re∣counting
this event. The Dutch Scipio, how∣ever,
was complaisant enough in his way; for he
desired her to sit at his right hand, by the appel∣lation
of <HI>Ya frow,</HI> and with his own fingers filling
a clean pipe, presented it to Mynheer Allucio the
lover. The rest of the oeconomy of the piece
was in the same taste; which was so agreeable to
the audience, that they seemed to have shaken
off their natural phlegm, in order to applaud the
performance.</P>
<P>From the play our company adjourned to the
house of their friend, where they spent the even∣ing;
and the conversation turning upon poetry,
a Dutchman who was present, and understood
the English language, having listened very atten∣tively
to the discourse, lifted up with both hands
the greatest part of a Cheshire cheese that lay up∣on
the table, saying, “I do know vat is boetrie.
Mine brotre be a great boet, and ave vrought a
book as dick as all dat.” Pickle, diverted with
this method of estimating an author according to
the quantity of his works, inquired about the
subjects of this bard's writings; but of these his
brother could give no account, or other informa∣tion,
<PB N="258" REF="267"/>
but that there was little market for the
commodity, which hung heavy upon his hands,
and induced him to wish he had applied himself
to another trade.</P>
<P>The only remarkable scene in Amsterdam,
which our company had not seen, was the Spuyl
or musick-houses, which, by the connivance of
the magistrates, are maintained for the recreation
of those who might attempt the chastity of credi∣table
women, if they were not provided with
such conveniences. To one of these night∣houses
did our travellers repair, under the con∣duct
of the English merchant, and were intro∣duced
into such another place as the ever-memo∣rable
coffee-house of Moll King; with this dif∣ference,
that the company here were not so riot∣ous
as the Bucks of Covent-Garden, but formed
themselves into a circle, within which some of
the number danced to the musick of a scurvy or∣gan
and a few other instruments, that uttered
tunes very suitable to the disposition of the
hearers, while the whole apartment was shrouded
with clouds of smoke impervious to the view.
When our gentlemen entered, the floor was oc∣cupied
by two females and their gallants, who,
in the performance of their exercise, listed their
legs like so many oxen at plough; and the pipe of
one of these hoppers happening to be exhausted
in the midst of his sarabrand, he very deliberately
drew forth his tobacco-box, filling, and lighting
it again, without any interruption to the dance.
Peregrine being unchecked by the presence of
his governor, who was too tender of his own re∣putation
to attend them in this expedition, made
up to a sprightly French girl that sat in seeming
expectation of a customer, and prevailing upon
<PB N="259" REF="268"/>
her to be his partner, led her into the circle, and,
in his turn, took the opportunity of dancing a
minuet, to the admiration of all present. He in∣tended
to have exhibited another specimen of his
ability in this art, when a captain of a Dutch man
of war chancing to come in, and see a stranger
engaged with the lady whom, it seems, he had
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espoke for his bedfellow, he advanced, without
any ceremony, and seizing her by the arm, pull'd
her to the other side of the room. Our adven∣turer,
who was not a man to put up with such a
brutal affront, followed the ravisher with indig∣nation
in his eyes; and pushing him on one side,
retook the subject of their contest, and led her
back to the place from whence she had been
dragged. The Dutchman, enraged at the
youth's presumption, obeyed the first dictates of
his choler, and lent his rival an hearty box on
the ear; which was immediately repaid with in∣terest,
before our hero could recollect himself
sufficiently to lay his hand upon his sword, and
beckon the aggressor to the door.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the confusion and disorder
which this affair produced in the room, and the
endeavours of Pickle's company, who interposed,
in order to prevent bloodshed, the antagonists
gained the street; and Peregrine drawing, was
surprised to see the captain advance against him
with a long knife, which he preferred to the
sword that hung by his side. The youth, con∣founded
at this preposterous behaviour, desired
him, in the French tongue, to lay aside that vul∣gar
implement, and approach like a gentleman<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
but the Hollander, who neithes understood the
proposal, nor would have complied with his de∣mand
had he been made acquainted with his
<PB N="260" REF="269"/>
meaning, rushed forward like a desperado, before
his adversary could put himself on his guard; and
if the young gentleman had not been endued
with surprising agility, his nose would have fallen
a sacrifice to the fury of the assailant. Finding
himself in such imminent jeopardy, he jumped to
one side, and the Dutchman passing him, in the
force of his career, he with one nimble kick
made such application to his enemy's heels, that
he flew like lightening into the canal, where he
had almost perished, by pitching upon one of the
posts with which it was faced.</P>
<P>Peregrine having performed this exploit, did
not stay for the captain's coming on shore, but
retreated with all dispatch, by the advice of his
conductor; and next day embarked, with his
companions, in the Skuyt, for Haarlem, where
they dined, and in the evening arrived at the an∣tient
city of Leyden, where they met with some
English students, who treated them with great
hospitality. Not but that the harmony of the
conversation was that same night interrupted by
a dispute that arose between one of those young
gentlemen and the physician, about the cold and
hot methods of prescription in the gout and rheu∣matism;
and proceeded to such a degree of mu∣tual
reviling, that Pickle ashamed and incensed
at his fellow-traveller's want of urbanity, es∣poused
the other's cause, and openly rebuked him
for his unmannerly petulance, which (he said)
rendered him unfit for the purposes, and unworthy
of the benefit of, society. This unexpected de∣claration
overwhelmed the doctor with amaze∣ment
and confusion; he was instantaneously de∣prived
of his speech, and during the remaining
part of the partie, sat in silent mortification. In
<PB N="261" REF="270"/>
all probability he deliberated with himself, whe∣ther
or not he should expostulate with the young
gentleman on the freedom he had taken with his
character in a company of strangers; but as he
knew that he had not a Pallet to deal with, he
very prudently suppressed that suggestion, and in
secret chewed the cud of resentment.</P>
<P>After they had visited the physic garden, the
university, the anatomical hall, and every other
thing that was recommended to their view, they
returned to Rotterdam, and held a consultation
upon the method of transporting themselves to
England. The doctor, whose grudge against Pe∣regrine
was rather inflamed than allayed by our
hero's indifference and neglect, had tampered
with the simplicity of the painter, who was proud
of his advances towards a perfect reconciliation;
and now took the opportunity of parting with
our adventurer, by declaring that he and his friend
Mr. Pallet were resolved to take their passage in
a trading sloop, after he had heard Peregrine ob∣ject
against that tedious, disagreeable, and uncer∣tain
method of conveyance. Pickle immediately
saw his intention; and, without using the least ar∣gument
to dissuade them from their design, or
expressing the smallest degree of concern at their
separation, very coolly wished them a prosperous
voyage, and ordered his baggage to be sent to
Helvoetsluys, where he himself, and his retinue,
went on board of the pacquet next day, and, by
the favour of a fair wind, in eighteen hours ar∣rived
at Harwich.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine delivers his letters of recommendation at
London, and returns to the garison, to the un∣speakable
joy of the commodore and his whole
family.</HEAD>
<P>NOW that our hero found himself on En∣glish
ground, his heart dilated with the
proud recollection of his own improvement since
he left his native soil; he began to recognize
the interesting ideas of his tender years; he en∣joyed,
by anticipation, the pleasure of seeing
his friends in the garison, after an absence of
eighteen months; and the image of his charming
Emily, which other less worthy considerations
had depressed, resumed the full possession of his
breast. He remembred, with shame, that he
had neglected the correspondence with her bro∣ther,
which he himself had sollicited, and in con∣sequence
of which he had received a letter from
that young gentleman while he lived at Paris. In
spite of these conscientious reflections, he was
too self-sufficient to think he should find any dif∣ficulty
in obtaining forgiveness for these sins of
omission; and began to imagine, that his passion
would be prejudicial to the dignity of his situa∣tion,
if it could not be gratified upon terms which
formerly his imagination durst not conceive.</P>
<P>Sorry am I, that the task I have undertaken,
lays me under the necessity of divulging this de∣generacy
in the sentiments of our imperious
youth, who was now in the heyday of his blood,
flushed with the consciousness of his own qualifi∣cations,
vain of his fortune, and elated on the
<PB N="263" REF="272"/>
wings of imaginary expectation. Tho' he was
deeply enamoured of miss Gauntlet, he was far
from proposing her heart as the ultimate aim of
his gallantry, which (he did not doubt) would
triumph o'er the most illustrious females of the
land, and at once regale his appetite and am∣bition.</P>
<P>Mean while, being willing to make his ap∣pearance
at the garison equally surprising and
agreeable, he cautioned Mr. Jolter against writ∣ing
to the commodore, who had not heard of
them since their departure from Paris, and hired a
post-chaise and horses for London. The gover∣nor
going out to give orders about the carriage,
inadvertently left a paper book open upon the
table; and his pupil casting his eyes upon the
page, chanced to read these words: “Sept. 15.
Arrived in safety, by the blessing of God, in this
unhappy kingdom of England. And thus con∣cludes
the journal of my last peregrination.” Pe∣regrine's
curiosity being inflamed by this extraor∣dinary
conclusion, he turned to the beginning,
and perused several sheets of a diary, such as is
commonly kept by that class of people known by
the denomination of travelling governors, for the
satisfaction of themselves and the parents or guar∣dians
of their pupils, and for the edification and
entertainment of their friends.</P>
<P>That the reader may have a clear idea of Mr.
Jolter's performance, we shall transcribe the
transactions of one day, as he had recorded them;
and that abstract will be a sufficient specimen of
the whole plan and execution of the work.</P>
<P>“May 3. At eight o'clock set out from Bou∣logne
in a post-chaise: the morning hazy and
cold. Fortified my stomach with a cordial. Re∣commended
<PB N="264" REF="273"/>
ditto to Mr. P. as an antidote against
the fog. Mem. He refused it. The hither horse
greased in the off-pastern of the hind-leg. Arrive
at Samers. Mem. This last was a post and a
half; i. e. three leagues, or nine English miles.
The day clears up. A fine champain country,
well stored with corn. The postilion says his
prayers in passing by a wooden crucifix upon the
road. Mem. The horses staled in a small brook
that runs in a bottom, betwixt two hills. Arrive
at Cormont. A common post, A dispute with
my pupil, who is obstinate, and swayed by an un∣lucky
prejudice. Proceed to Montreuil, where
we dine on choice pigeons. A very moderate
charge. No chamberpot in the room; owing to
the negligence of the maid. This an ordinary
post. Set out again for Nampont. Troubled
with flatulencies and indigestion. Mr. P. is sul∣len,
and seems to mistake an eructation for the
breaking of wind backwards. From Nampont
depart for Bernay, at which place we arrive in
the evening, and propose to stay all night. N. B.
The two last are double posts, and our cattle
very willing, tho' not strong. Sup on a deli∣cate
ragout and excellent partridges, in company
with Mr. H. and his spouse. Mem. The said H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
trod upon my corn by mistake. Discharge the
bill, which is not very reasonable. Dispute with
Mr. P. about giving money to the servant: he
insists upon my giving a twenty-four sol piece;
which is too much by two thirds, in all con∣science.
N. B. She was a pert baggage, and did
not deserve a liard.”</P>
<P>Our hero was so much disobliged with certain
circumstances of this amusing and instructing
journal, that, by way of punishing the author,
<PB N="265" REF="274"/>
he interlined these words betwixt two paragraphs,
in a manner that exactly resembled the tutor's
hand-writing; “Mem. Had the pleasure of
drinking myself into a sweet intoxication, by
toasting our lawful king, and his royal family,
among some worthy English fathers of the society
of Jesus.”</P>
<P>Having taken this revenge, he set out for
London, where he waited upon those noblemen
to whom he had letters of recommendation from
Paris; and was not only graciously received, but
even loaded with caresses and proffers of service,
because they understood he was a young gentle∣man
of fortune, who, far from standing in need
of their countenance or assistance, would make
an useful and creditable addition to the number
of their adherents. He had the honour of dining
at their tables, in consequence of pressing invita∣tions,
and of spending several evenings with the
ladies, to whom he was particularly agreeable,
on account of his person, address, and bleeding
freely at play.</P>
<P>Being thus initiated in the beau monde, he
thought it was high time to pay his respects to his
generous benefactor the commodore; and ac∣cordingly
departed one morning, with his train,
for the garison, at which he arrived in safety the
same night. When he entered the gate, which
was opened by a new servant that did not know
him, he found his old friend Hatchway stalking
in the yard, with a night-cap on his head, and a
pipe in his mouth; and advancing to him, took
him by the hand, before he had any intimation of
his approach. The lieutenant, thus saluted by a
stranger, stated at him in silent astonishment,
all he recollected his features, which were no
<PB N="266" REF="275"/>
sooner known, than dashing the pipe upon the
pavement, he exclaimed, “Smite my cross-trees!
th'art welcome to port;” and hugg'd him in his
arms with great affection. He then, by a cor∣dial
squeeze, expressed his satisfaction at seeing
his old ship-mate Tom, who applying his whistle
to his mouth, the whole castle ecchoed with his
performance.</P>
<P>The servants hearing the well-known sound,
poured out in a tumult of joy; and understand∣ing
that their young master was returned, raised
such a peal of acclamation, as astonished the com∣modore
and his lady, and inspired Julia with such
an interesting presage, that her heart began to
throb with violence; and running out in the hurry
and perturbation of her hope, she was so much
overwhelmed at sight of her brother, that she
actually fainted in his arms. But from this trance
she soon awaked; and Peregrine having testified
his pleasure and affection, went up stairs, and pre∣sented
himself before his godfather and aunt.
Mrs. Trunnion rose, and received him with a
gracious embrace, blessing God for his happy re∣turn
from a land of impiety and vice, in which
she hoped his morals had not been corrupted, nor
his principles of religion altered or impaired.
The old gentleman being confined to his chair,
was struck dumb with pleasure at his appearance;
and having made divers ineffectual efforts to get
up, at length discharged a volley of curses against
his own limbs, and held out his hand to his god∣son,
who kiss'd it with great respect.</P>
<P>After he had finished his apostrophe to the
gout, which was the daily and hourly subject of
his execrations, “Well, my lad, (said he) I
care not how soon I go to bottom, now I behold
<PB N="267" REF="276"/>
thee safe in harbour again: and yet, I tell a
damn'd lie: I would I could keep afloat, until I
should see a lusty boy of thy begetting. Odds
my timbers! I love thee so well, that I believe
thou art the spawn of my own body; though I
can give no account of thy being put upon the
stocks.” Then turning his eye upon Pipes, who
by this time had penetrated into his apartment,
and addressed him with the usual salutation of
“What cheer?” “Ahey! (cried he) are you
there, you herring-fac'd son of a sea-calf? What
a slippery trick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou played your old commander!
But, come, you dog, there's my fist; I forgive
you, for the love you bear to my godson. Go
man your tackle, and hoist a cask of strong
beer into the yard, knock out the bung, and put
a pump in it, for the use of all my servants and
neighbours: and d'ye hear, let the patereroes
be fired, and the garison illuminated, as rejoicings
for the safe arrival of your master. By the Lord!
if I had the use of these damn'd shambling
thanks, I would dance an hornpipe with the best
of you.”</P>
<P>The next object of his attention was Mr. Jol∣ter,
who was honoured with particular marks
of distinction, and the repeated promise of en∣joying
the living in his gift, as an acknowledg∣ment
of the care and discretion with which he
had superintended the education and morals of
our hero. The governor was so affected by the
generosity of his patron, that the tears ran down
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s cheeks, while he expressed his gratitude, and
the infinite satisfaction he felt, in contemplating
the accomplishments of his pupil.</P>
<P>Mean while, Pipes did not neglect the orders
he had received: the beer was produced, the
<PB N="268" REF="277"/>
gates were thrown open for the admission of all
comers, the whole house was lighted up, and the
patereroes discharged in repeated vollies. Such
phaenomena could not fail to attract the notice of
the neighbourhood. The club at Tunley's were
astonished at the report of the guns, which pro∣duced
various conjectures among the members of
that sagacious society. The landlord observed,
that in all likelihood the commodore was visited
by hobgoblins, and ordered the guns to be fired
in token of distress, as he had acted twenty years
before, when he was annoyed by the same grie∣vance.
The exciseman, with a waggish sneer,
expressed his apprehension of Trunnion's death,
in consequence of which, the patereroes might
be discharged with an equivocal intent, either as
signals of his lady's sorrow or rejoicing. The
attorney signified a suspicion of Hatchway's being
married to Miss Pickle, and that the firing and
illumination were in honour of the nuptials:
upon which Gamaliel discovered some faint signs
of emotion, and taking the pipe from his mouth,
gave it as his opinion, that his sister was brought
to bed.</P>
<P>While they were thus bewildered in the maze
of their own imaginations, a company of coun∣trymen,
who sat drinking in the kitchen, and
whose legs were more ready than their invention,
fallied out to know the meaning of these exhibi∣tions;
and understanding that there was a butt
of strong beer abroach in the yard, to which
they were invited by the servants, saved them∣selves
the trouble and expence of returning to
spend the evening at the public house, and listed
themselves under the banner of Tom Pipes, who
presided as director of this festival.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="278"/>
The news of Peregrine's return being com∣municated
to the parish, the parson and three or
four neighbouring gentlemen, who were well-wishers
to our hero, immediately repaired to the
garison, in order to pay their compliments on this
happy event; and being detained to supper, an
elegant entertainment was prepared by the di∣rection
of Miss July, who was an excellent house∣wife;
and the commodore was so invigorated
with joy, that he seemed to have renewed his
age.</P>
<P>Among those who honoured the occasion with
his presence was Mr. Clover, the young gentle∣man
that made his addresses to Peregrine's sister;
and his heart was so big with his passion, that
while the rest of the company were ingrossed by
their cups, he seized an opportunity of our hero's
being detached from the conversation, and in the
impatience of his love, conjured him to consent
to his happiness; protesting, that he would com∣ply
with any terms of settlement that a man of
his fortune could embrace, in favour of a young
lady who was absolute mistress of his affection.</P>
<P>Our youth thanked him very politely for his
favourable sentiments and honourable intention
towards his sister, and told him, that at present
he saw no reason to obstruct his desire; that he
would consult Julia's own inclinations, and con∣fer
with him about the means of gratifying his
wish: but, in the mean time, begg'd to be ex∣cused
from discussing any point of such impor∣tance
to them both, and reminding him of the
jovial purpose on which they were happily met,
promoted such a quick circulation of the bottle,
that their mirth gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w noisy and obstreperous:
they broke forth into repeated peals of laughter,
<PB N="270" REF="279"/>
without any previous incitement, except that of
claret. These explosions were succeeded by Bac∣chanalian
songs, in which the old gentleman him∣self
attempted to bear a share; the sedate go∣vernor
snapped time with his fingers, and the
parish-priest assisted in the chorus with a most
expressive nakedness of countenance. Before
midnight, they were almost all pinned to their
chai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as if they had been fixed by the power
of inchantment; and what rendered the con∣finement
still more unfortunate, every servant in
the house was in the same situation; so that they
were sain to take their repose as they sat, and
nodded to each other like a congregation of ana∣baptists.</P>
<P>Next day, Peregrine communed with his sister
on the subject of her match with Mr. Clover,
who (she told him) had offered to settle a jointure
of four hundred pounds, and take her to wife,
without any expectation of a dowry. She,
moreover, gave him to understand, that in his
absence she had received several messages from
her mother, commanding her to return to her fa∣ther's
house; but that she had refused to obey
these orders, by the advice and injunction of her
aunt and the commodore, which were indeed se∣conded
by her own inclination; because she had
all the reason in the world to believe, that her
mother only wanted an opportunity of treating
her with severity and rancour: for the resentment
of that lady had been carried to such indecent
lengths, that seeing her daughter at church one
day, she rose up before the parson entered, and
reviled her with great bitterness, in the face of
the whole congregation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es his sister happily married. Visits Emilia, who
receives him according to his deserts.</HEAD>
<P>HER brother being of opinion, that Mr.
Clover's proposal was not to be neglected,
especially as Julia's heart was engaged in his fa∣vour,
communicated the affair to his uncle, who,
with the approbation of Mrs. Trunnion, declared
himself well satisfied with the young man's ad∣dresses,
and desired that they might be buckled
with all expedition, without the knowledge or
concurrence of her parents, to whom (on ac∣count
of their unnatural barbarity) she was not
bound to pay the least regard. Though our ad∣venturer
entertained the same sentiments of the
matter, and the lover dreading some obstruction,
earnestly begg'd the immediate condescension of
his mistress, she could not be prevailed upon to
take such a material step, without having first
solicited the permission of her father, resolved,
nevertheless, to comply with the dictates of her
own heart, should his objections be frivolous or
unjust.</P>
<P>Urged by this determination, her admirer
waited upon Mr. Gamaliel at the public house,
and with the appearance of great de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erence and
respect, made him acquainted with his affection
for his daughter, communicated the particulars
of his fortune, with the terms of settlement he
was ready to make; and in conclusion told him,
that he would marry her without a portion.
This last offer seemed to have some weight with
the father, who received it with civility, and
<PB N="272" REF="281"/>
promised, in a day or two, to favour him with
a final answer to his demand. He, accordingly,
that same evening consulted his wife, who being
exasperated at the prospect of her daughter's in∣dependency,
argued with the most virulent ex∣postulation
against the match, as an impudent
scheme of her own planning, with a view of in∣sulting
her parents, towards whom she had al∣ready
been guilty of the most vicious disobedience.
In short, she used such remonstrances, as not
only averted this weak husband's inclination from
the proposal which he had relished before, but
even instigated him to apply for a warrant to ap∣prehend
his daughter, on the supposition that she
was about to bestow herself in marriage, without
his privity or consent.</P>
<P>The justice of peace to whom this application
was made, though he could not refuse the order,
yet, being no stranger to the malevolence of the
mother, which, together with Gamaliel's sim∣plicity,
was notorious in the county, he sent an
intimation of what had happened to the garison;
upon which, a couple of centinels were placed
on the gate, and at the pressing solicitation of
the lover, as well as the desire of the commodore,
her brother and aunt, Julia was wedded without
further delay; the ceremony being performed by
Mr. Jolter, because the parish-priest prudently
declined any occasion of giving offence, and the
curate was too much in the interest of their ene∣mies,
to be employed in that office.</P>
<P>This domestic concern being settled to the sa∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>action
of our hero, he escorted her next day
to the house of her husband, who immediately
wrote a letter to her father, declaring his reasons
<PB N="273" REF="282"/>
for having thus superseded his authority; and
Mrs. Pickle's mortification was unspeakable.</P>
<P>That the new-married couple might be guard∣ed
against all insult, our young gentleman and
his friend Hatchway, with their adherents, lodged
in Mr Clover's house for some weeks; during
which, they visited their acquaintance in the
neighbourhood, according to custom; and when
the tranquillity of their family was perfectly esta∣blished,
and the contract of marriage executed
in the presence of the old commodore and his
lady, who gave her niece five hundred pounds to
purchase jewels and cloaths, Mr. Peregrine could
no longer restrain his impatience to see his dear
Emily; and told his uncle, that next day he pro∣posed
to ride across the country, in order to visit
his friend Gauntlet, from whom he had not heard
of a long time.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, looking stedfastly in his
face, “Ah! damn your cunning! (said he) I
find the anchor holds fast: I did suppose as how
you would have slipt your cable, and changed
your birth; but, I see, when a young fellow is
once brought up by a pretty wench, he may man
his capstans and viol block, if he wool; but he'll
as soon heave up the Pike of Teneriff, as bring
his anchor aweigh! Odds heartlikins! had I
known the young woman was Ned Gauntlet's
daughter, I shou'dn't have thrown out signal for
leaving off chace.”</P>
<P>Our adventurer was not a little surprized to
hear the commodore talk in this stile; and im∣mediately
conjectured, that his friend Godsrey
had informed him of the whole affair. Instead
of listening to this approbation of his f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, with
those transports of joy which he would have felt,
<PB N="274" REF="283"/>
had he retained his former sentiments, he was
chagrined at Trunnion's declaration, and offended
a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the presumption of the young soldier, in pre∣tending
to disclose the secret with which he had
intrusted him. Reddening with these reflections,
he assured the commodore, that he never had se∣rious
thoughts of matrimony: so that, if any per∣son
had told him he was under any engagement
of that kind, he had abused his ear; for, he pro∣tested,
that he would never contract such at∣tachments,
without his knowledge and express
permission.</P>
<P>Trunnion commended him for his prudent re∣solution,
and observed, that though no person
mentioned to him what promises had passed be∣twixt
him and his sweetheart, it was very plain
that he had made love to her; and therefore, it
was to be supposed, that his intentions were ho∣nourable:
for, he could not believe he was such a
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gue in his heart, as to endeavour to debauch
the daughter of a brave officer, who had served
his country with credit and reputation. Not∣withstanding
this remonstrance, which Pickle
imputed to the commodore's ignorance of the
world, he set out for the habitation of Mrs.
Gauntlet, with the unjustifiable sentiments of a
man of pleasure, who sacrifices every considera∣tion
to the desire of his ruling appetite; and as
Winchester lay in his way, resolved to visit some
of his friends who lived in that place. It was in
the house of one of these, that he was informed
of Emilia's being then in town with her mother;
upon which, he excused himself from staying to
drink tea, and immediately repaired to their
lodgings, according to the direction he had re∣ceived.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284"/>
When he arrived at the door, instead of un∣dergoing
that perturbation of spirits, which a
lover, in his interesting situation, might be sup∣posed
to feel, he suffered no emotion but that of
vanity and pride, favoured with an opportunity
of self-gratification, and entered his Emilia's
apartment with the air of a conceited petit maitre,
rather than that of the respectful admirer, when
he visits the object of his passion, after an ab∣sence
of seventeen months.</P>
<P>The young lady having been very much dis∣obliged
at his mortifying neglect of her brother's
letter, had summoned all her own pride and re∣solution
to her aid; and by means of a happy dis∣position,
so far overcame her chagrin at his in∣difference,
that she was able to behave in his pre∣sence
with apparent tranquillity and ease. She
was even pleased to find, he had by accident
chosen a time for his visit, when she was sur∣rounded
by two or three young gentlemen, who
prosessed themselves her admirers. Our gallant
was no sooner anounced, than she collected all
her coquettry, put on the gayest air she could as∣sume,
and contrived to giggle just as he appeared
at the room-door. The compliments of saluta∣tion
being performed, she welcomed him to Eng∣gland
in a careless manner, asked the news of
Paris, and, before he could make any reply, de∣sired
one of the other gentlemen to proceed with
the sequel of that comical adventure, in the re∣lation
of which he had been interrupted.</P>
<P>Peregrine smiled within himself at this beha∣viour,
which (without all doubt he believed) she
had affected to punish him for his unkind silence,
while he was abroad; being fully persuaded, that
her heart was absolutely at his devotion. On
<PB N="276" REF="285"/>
this supposition, he practised his Parisian improve∣ments
on the art of conversation, and uttered a
thousand prettinesses in the way of compliment,
with such incredible rotation of tongue, that his
rivals were struck dumb with astonishment; and
Emilia fretted out of all temper, at seeing her∣self
deprived of the prerogative of the sex. He
persisted, however, in this surprising loquacity,
until the rest of the company thought proper to
withdraw, and then contracted his discourse into
the focus of love, which now put on a very di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ferent
appearance from that which it had for∣merly
worn. Instead of that awful veneration
which her presence used to inspire, that chastity
of sentiment and delicacy of expression, he now
gazed upon her with the eyes of a libertine, he
glowed with the impatience of desire, talked in
a strain that barely kept within the bounds of
decency, and attempted to snatch such favours as
she, in the tenderness of mutual acknowledge∣ment,
had once vouchsafed to bestow.</P>
<P>Grieved and offended as she was, at this pal∣pable
alteration in his carriage, she disdained to
remind him of his former deportment, and with
dissembled good humour, rallied him on the
progress he had made in gallantry and address:
but, far from submitting to the liberties he would
have taken, she kept her person sacred from his
touch, and would not even suffer him to ravish
a kiss of her fair hand: so that he reaped no other
advantage from the exercise of his talents, du∣ring
this interview, which lasted a whole hour,
than that of knowing he had over-rated his own
importance; and that Emily's heart was not a
ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son likely to surrender at discretion.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="286"/>
At length, his addresses were interrupted by
the arrival of the mother, who had gone abroad
to visit by herself; and the conversation be∣coming
more general, he understood, that God∣frey
was at London, soliciting for a lieutenancy
that had fallen vacant in the regiment to which
he belonged; and that Miss Sophy was at home
with her father.</P>
<P>Though our adventurer had not met with all
the success he expected in his first visit, he did
not despair of reducing the fortress, believing that
in time there would be a mutiny in his favour;
and accordingly, carried on the siege for several
days, without profiting by his perseverance; till
at length, having attended the ladies to their
own house in the country, he began to look
upon this adventure as time mispent, and re∣solved
to discontinue his attack, in hopes of meet∣ing
with a more favourable occasion; being, in
the mean time, ambitious of displaying, in an
higher sphere, those qualifications which his vanity
told him, were at present misapplied.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He attends his uncle with great affection, during
a fit of illness. Sets out again for London;
meets with his friend Godfrey, who is prevailed
upon to accompany him to Bath; on the road to
which place, they chance to dine with a person,
who entertains them with a curious account of a
certain company of adventurers.</HEAD>
<P>THUS determined, he took leave of Emi∣lia
and her mother, on pretence of going
to London upon some urgent business, and re∣turned
<PB N="278" REF="287"/>
to the garison, leaving the good old lady
very much concerned, and the daughter incensed
at his behaviour, which was the more unexpect∣ed,
because Godfrey had told them, that the
commodore approved of his nephew's passion.</P>
<P>Our adventurer found his uncle so ill of the
gout, which, for the first time, had taken pos∣session
of his stomach, that his life was in immi∣nent
danger, and the whole family in disorder:
he therefore took the reins of government in his
own han<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, sent for all the physicians in the
neighbourhood, and attended him in person with
the most affectionate care, during the whole fit,
which lasted a fortnight, and then retired before
the strength of his constitution.</P>
<P>When the old gentleman recovered his health,
he was so penetrated with Peregrine's behaviour,
that he actually would have made over to him his
whole fortune, and depended upon him for his
own subsistence, had not our youth opposed the
execution of the deed with all his influence and
might, and even persuaded him to make a will,
in which his friend Hatchway, and all his other
adherents, were liberally remembered, and his
aunt provided for, on her own terms. This
material point being settled, he, with his uncle's
permission, departed for London, after having
seen the family-affairs established under the direc∣tion
and administration of Mr. Jolter and the
lieutenant: for, by this time, Mrs. Trunnion
was wholly occupied with her spiritual concerns.</P>
<P>On his first arrival at London, he sent a card
to the lodgings of Gauntlet, in consequence of
a direction from his mother; and that young
gentleman waited on him next morning, though
not with that alacrity of countenance and warmth
<PB N="279" REF="288"/>
of friendship, which might have been expected
from the intimacy of their former connexion.
Nor was Peregrine himself actuated by the same
unreserved affection for the soldier, which he
had formerly entertained. Godfrey, over and
above the offence he had taken at Pickle's omis∣sion,
in point of corresponding with him, had
been informed, by a letter from his mother, of
the youth's cavalier behaviour to Emilia, during
his last residence at Winchester; and our young
gentleman (as we have already observed) was
disgusted at the supposed discovery which the sol∣dier
had made, in his absence, to the commo∣dore.
They perceived their mutual umbrage at
meeting, and received each other with that ci∣vility
of reserve, which commonly happens be∣tween
two persons, when their friendship is in
the wane.</P>
<P>Gauntlet at once divined the cause of the
other's displeasure; and, in order to vindicate his
own character, after the first compliments were
passed, took the opportunity of inquiring after
the health of the commodore, to tell Peregrine,
that while he tarried at the garison, in his return
from Dover, the subject of the conversation, one
night, happening to turn on our hero's passion,
the old gentleman had expressed his concern
about that affair; and, among other observa∣tions,
said, he supposed the object of his love was
some paultry hussy, whom he had picked up
when he was a boy at school. Upon which,
Mr. Hatchway assured him, that she was a young
woman of as good a family as any in the county;
and after having prepossessed him in her favour,
ventured (out of the zeal of his friendship) to
tell who she was: wherefore, the discovery was
<PB N="280" REF="289"/>
not to be imputed to any other cause: and he
hoped Mr. Pickle would acquit him of all share
in the transaction.</P>
<P>Peregrine was very well pleased to be thus un∣deceived;
his countenance immediately cleared
up, the formality of his behaviour relaxed into
his usual familiarity; he asked pardon for his un∣mannerly
neglect of Godfrey's letter, which, he
protested, was not owing to any disregard, or
abatement of friendship, but to a hurry of youth∣ful
engagements, in consequence of which, he
had procrastinated his answer from time to time,
until he was ready to return in person.</P>
<P>The young soldier was contented with this
apology; and as Pickle's intention, with respect
to his sister, was still dubious and undeclared, he
did not think it was incumbent upon him, as
yet, to express any resentment on that score;
but was wise enough to foresee, that the re∣newal
of his intimacy with our young gentleman,
might be the means of reviving that flame which
had been dissipated by a variety of new ideas.
With those sentiments he laid aside all reserve,
and their communication immediately resumed its
former channel. Peregrine made him acquainted
with all the adventures in which he had been en∣gaged
since their parting; and he, with the same
confidence, related the remarkable incidents of
his own fate; among other things, giving him
to understand, that upon obtaining a commission
in the army, the father of his dear Sophy, with∣out
once inquiring about the occasion of his pro∣motion,
had not only favoured him with his
countenance in a much greater degree than here∣tofore,
but also contributed his interest, and even
promised the assistance of his purse, in procuring
<PB N="281" REF="290"/>
for him a lieutenancy, which he was then soli∣citing
with all his power; whereas, if he had
not been enabled, by a most accidental piece of
good fortune, to lift himself into the sphere of
an officer, he had all the reason in the world to
believe, that this gentleman, and all the rest of
his wealthy relations, would have suffered him to
languish in obscurity and distress; and, by turn∣ing
his misfortune into reproach, made it a plea
for their own want of generosity and friend∣ship.</P>
<P>Peregrine, understanding this situation of his
friend's affairs, would have accommodated him,
upon the instant, with a sum to accelerate the
passage of his commission through the offices;
but, being too well acquainted with his scrupu∣lous
disposition, to manifest his benevolence in
that manner, he found means to introduce him∣self
to one of the gentlemen of the war-office,
who was so well satisfied with the arguments he
used in behalf of his friend, that Godfrey's bu∣siness
was transacted in a very few days, though
he himself knew nothing of his interest's being
thus reinsorced.</P>
<P>By this time, the season at Bath was begun;
and our hero, panting with the desire of distin∣guishing
himself at that resort of the fashionable
world, communicated his design of going thither
to his friend Godfrey, whom he importuned to
accompany him in the excursion: and leave of
absence from his regiment being obtained, by
the influence of Peregrine's new quality-friends,
the two companions departed from London in a
post-chaife, attended, as usual, by the valet de
chambre and Pipes, who were become almost as
<PB N="282" REF="291"/>
necessary to our adventurer as any two of his
own organs.</P>
<P>At the inn, when they alighted for dinner,
Godf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey perceived a person walking by himself
in the yard, with a very pensive air, and upon
observing him more narrowly, recognized him
to be a professed gamester, whom he had for∣merly
known at Tunbridge. On the strength
of this acquaintance, he accosted the peripatetic,
who knew him immediately; and, in the ful∣ness
of his grief and vexation, told him, that he
was now on his return from Bath, where he had
been stripp'd by a company of sharpers, who re∣sented
that he should presume to trade upon his
own bottom.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was extremely curious in his
inquiries, imagining that he might learn some
entertaining and useful anecdotes from this artist,
invited him to dinner, and was accordingly fully
informed of all the political systems at the Bath.
He understood, that there was at London one
great company of adventurers, who employed
agents, in all the different branches of imposi∣tion,
throughout the whole kingdom of Eng∣land,
allowing these ministers a certain propor∣tion
of the profits accruing from their industry
and skill, and reserving the greatest share for the
benefit of the common stock, which was charge∣able
with the expence of fitting out individuals
in their various pursuits, as well as with the loss
sustained in the course of their adventures. Some,
whose persons and qualifications are by the com∣pany
judged adequate to the task, exert their ta∣lents
in making love to ladies of fortune, being
accommodated with money and accoutrements
<PB N="283" REF="292"/>
for that purpose, after having given their bonds
payable to one or other of the directors, on the
day of marriage, for certain sums, proportioned
to the dowries they are to receive. Others,
versed in the doctrine of chances, and certain
secret expedients, frequent all those places where
games of hazard are allowed; and such as are
masters in the arts of billiards, tennis and bowls,
are continually lying in wait, in all the scenes of
these diversions, for the ignorant and unwary.
A fourth class attend horse-races, being skilled in
those mysterious practices, by which the knowing∣ones
are taken in. Nor is this community un∣furnished
with those who lay wanton wives and
old rich widows under contribution, and extort
money, by prostituting themselves to the em∣braces
of their own sex, and then threatening
their admirers with prosecution. But their most
important returns are made by that body of their
undertakers who exercise their understandings in
the innumerable stratagems of the card table, at
which no sharper can be too infamous to be re∣ceived,
and even caressed by persons of the highest
rank and distinction. Among other articles of
intelligence, our young gentleman learn'd, that
those agents, by whom their guest was broke,
and expelled from Bath, had constituted a bank
against all sporters, and monopolized the ad∣vantage
in all sorts of play. He then told Gaunt∣let,
that if he would put himself under his di∣rection,
he would return with them, and lay
such a scheme, as would infallibly ruin the whole
society at billiards, as he knew that Godfrey ex∣celled
them all in his knowledge of that game.</P>
<P>The soldier excused himself from engaging in
any party of that kind; and after dinner the tra∣vellers
<PB N="284" REF="293"/>
parted; but, as the conversation between
the two friends turned upon the information
they had received, Peregrine projected a plan for
punishing those villanous pests of society, who
prey upon their fellow creatures; and it was put
in execution by Gauntlet, in this manner.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="74" TYPE="chapter">

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Godfrey executes a scheme at Bath, by which a
whole company of sharpers is ruined.</HEAD>
<P>ON the evening after their arrival at Bath,
Godfrey, who had kept himself up all day
for that purpose, went in boots to the billiard
table; and two gentlemen being at play, began
to bet with so little appearance of judgment, that
one of the adventurers then present was inflamed
with the desire of profiting by his inexperience;
and when the table was vacant, invited him to
take a game for amusement. The soldier, as∣suming
the air of a self-conceited dupe, answer∣ed,
that he did not choose to throw away his
time for nothing, but, if he pleased, would
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddle for a crown a game. This declaration
was very agreeable to the other, who wanted to
be further confirmed in the opinion he had con∣ceived
of the stranger, before he would play for
any thing of consequence. The partie being ac∣cepted,
Gauntlet put off his coat, and beginning
with seeming eagerness, won the first game, be∣cause
his antagonist kept up his play, with a view
of encouraging him to wager a greater sum. The
soldier purposely bit at the hook, the stakes were
doubled, and he was again victorious, by the
permission of his competitor. He now began to
<PB N="285" REF="294"/>
yawn; and observing, that it was not worth his
while to proceed in such a childish manner, the
other swore, in an affected passion, that he would
play with him for twenty guineas. The propo∣sal
being embraced (thro' the connivance of God∣frey)
the money was won by the sharper, who
exerted his dexterity to the uttermost, fearing
that otherwise his adversary would decline con∣tinuing
the game.</P>
<P>Godfrey thus conquered, pretended to lose his
temper, curs'd his own ill luck, swore that the
table had a cast, and that the balls did not run
true, changed his mast, and with great warmth
challenged his enemy to double the sum. The
gamester, with feigned reluctance, complied with
his desire, and having got the first two hazards,
offered to lay one hundred guineas to fifty on the
game. The odds were taken; and Godfrey
having allowed himself to be overcome, began
to rage with great violence, broke the mast to
pieces, threw the balls out at the window, and,
in the fury of his indignation, defied his antago∣nist
to meet him to-morrow, when he should be
refreshed from the fatigue of travelling. This
was a very welcome invitation to the gamester,
who imagining that the soldier would turn out a
most beneficial prize, assured him, that he would
not fail to be there next forenoon, in order to
give him his revenge.</P>
<P>Gauntlet went home to his lodgings, fully
certified of his own superiority; and took his
measures with Peregrine, touching the prosecu∣tion
of their scheme; while his opponent made
a report of his success to the brethren of the gang,
who resolved to be present at the decision of the
<PB N="286" REF="295"/>
match, with the view of taking advantage of the
stranger's passionate disposition.</P>
<P>Affairs being thus concerted on both sides, the
players met, according to appointment, and the
room was immediately filled with spectators, who
either came thither by accident, curiosity, or de∣sign.
The match was fixed for one hundred
pounds a game, the principals chose their instru∣ments,
and laid aside their coats, and one of the
knights of the order proffered to lay another hun∣dred
on the head of his associate. Godfrey took
him up on the instant. A second worthy of the
same class seeing him so eager, challenged him to
treble the sum; and his proposal met with the
same reception, to the astonishment of the com∣pany,
whose expectation was raised to a very in∣teresting
pitch. The game was begun, and the
soldier having lost the first hazard, the odds were
offered by the confederacy, with great vocifera∣tion;
but no body would run such a risk, in fa∣vour
of a person who was utterly unknown. The
sharper having gained the second also, the noise
increased to a surprising clamour, not only of the
gang, but likewise of almost all the spectators,
who desired to lay two to one against the brother
of Emilia.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was present, perceiving the
cupidity of the association sufficiently inflamed,
all of a sudden opened his mouth, and answered
their betts, to the amount of twelve hundred
pounds; which were immediately deposited, on
both sides, in money and notes: so that this was
(perhaps) the most important game that ever was
plaid at billiards. Gauntlet seeing the agreement
settled, struck his antagonist's ball into the pocket,
in a twinkling, tho' it was in one of those situations
<PB N="287" REF="296"/>
which are supposed to be against the striker. The
betters were a little discomposed at this event,
for which, however, they consoled themselves,
by imputing the success to accident; but when,
at the very next stroke, he sprung it over the
table, their countenances underwent an instanta∣neous
distraction of feature, and they waited, in
the most dreadful suspense, for the next hazard,
which being likewise taken, with infinite ease, by
the soldier, the blood forsook their cheeks, and
the interjection <HI>Zounds!</HI> pronounced with a look
of consternation, and in a tone of despair, pro∣ceeded
from every mouth, at the same instant of
time. They were overwhelmed with horror and
astonishment at seeing three hazards taken in as
many strokes, from a person of their friend's
dexterity; and shrewdly suspected, that the
whole was a scheme preconcerted for their de∣struction:
on this supposition they changed the
note, and attempted to effect their own indemni∣fication,
by proposing to lay the odds in favour of
Gauntlet; but so much was the opinion of the
company altered by that young gentleman's suc∣cess,
that no body would venture to espouse the
cause of his competitor, who chancing to improve
his game by the addition of another lucky hit,
diminished the concern, and revived the hopes of
his adherents. But, this gleam of fortune, did
not long continue: Godfrey collected his whole
art and capacity, and augmenting his score to
number ten, indulged himself with a view of the
whole fra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nity. The visages of these profes∣sors
had adopted different sha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of complexion,
at every hazard he had taken; from their natural
colour they had shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted into a sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; from
thence into pale; from pale into yellow, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch
<PB N="288" REF="297"/>
degenerated into a mahogony tint; and now they
saw seventeen hundred pounds of their stock de∣pending
upon a single stroke, they stood like so
many swarthy Moors, jaundiced with terror and
vexation. The fire which naturally glowed in
the cheeks and nose of the player, seemed ut∣terly
extinct, and his carbuncles exhibited a livid
appearance, as if a gangrene had already made
some progress in his face; his hand began to
shake, and his whole frame was seized with such
trepidation, that he was fain to swallow a bumper
of brandy, in order to re-establish the tranquil∣lity
of his nerves. This expedient, however,
did not produce the desired effect; for he aimed
the ball at the lead with such discomposure, that
it struck on the wrong side, and came off at an
angle which directed it full in the middle hole.
This fatal accident was attended with an uni∣versal
groan, as if the whole universe had gone
to wreck: and notwithstanding that tranquillity
for which adventurers are so remarkable, this
loss made such an impression upon them all, that
each, in particular, manifested his chagrin, by
the most violent emotions. One turned up his
eyes to heaven, and bit his nether lip; another
gnawed his fingers, while he stalked across the
room; a third blasphemed with horrible impre∣cations;
and he who played the partie, sneaked
off, grinding his teeth together, with a look that
baffles all description, and as he crossed the
threshold, exclaiming, “A damn'd bite, by
G—d!”</P>
<P>The victors, after having insulted them, by
asking if they were disposed for another chance,
carried off their winning, with the appearance of
great composure, though in their hearts they
<PB N="289" REF="298"/>
were transported with unspeakable joy; not so
much on account of the booty they had gained,
as in consideration of having so effectually de∣stroyed
such a nest of pernicious miscreants.</P>
<P>Peregrine believing, that now he had found
an opportunity of serving his friend, without gi∣ving
offence to the delicacy of his honour, told
him, upon their arrival at their lodgings, that
fortune had at length enabled him to become in
a manner independent, or at least to make him∣self
easy in his circumstances, by purchasing a
company with the money he had won. So say∣ing,
he put his share of the success in Gauntlet's
hand, as a sum that of right belonged to him,
and promised to write in his behalf to a noble∣man,
who had interest enough to promote such a
quick rise in the service.</P>
<P>Godfrey thanked him for his obliging inten∣tion,
but absolutely refused, with great loftiness
of demeanour, to appropriate to his own use any
part of the money which Pickle had gained, and
seemed affronted at the other's entertaining a sen∣timent
so unworthy of his character. He would
not even accept, in the way of loan, such an
addition to his own stock, as would amount to
the price of a company of foot; but expressed
great confidence in the future exertion of that ta∣lent
which had been blessed with such a prospe∣rous
beginning. Our hero sinding him thus ob∣stimately
deaf to the voice of his own interest,
resolved to govern himself in his next endeavours

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The two friends eclipse all their competitors in gal∣lantry,
and practise a pleasant project of revenge
upon the physicians of the place.</HEAD>
<P>THE same of their exploit against the sharpers,
was immediately diffused through all com∣panies
at the Bath; so that when our adventurers
appeared in public, they were pointed out by an
hundred extended fingers, and considered as con∣summate
artists in all the different species of fi∣nesse,
which they would not fail to practise with
the first opportunity. Nor was this opinion of
their characters any obstacle to their reception
into the fashionable parties in the place; but, on
the contrary, such a recommendation, which (as
I have already hinted) never fails to operate for
the advantage of the possessor.</P>
<P>This first adventure, therefore, served them as
an introduction to the company at Bath, who
were not a little surprized to find their expecta∣tions
baffled by the conduct of the two compa∣nions;
because, far from engaging deeply at
play, they rather shunned all occasions of gaming,
and directed their attention to gallantry, in
which our hero shone unrivalled. His external
qualifications, exclusive of any other merit, were
strong enough to captivate the common run of
the female sex; and these, reinforced with a
sprightliness of conversation, and a most insi∣nuating
<PB N="291" REF="300"/>
address, became irresistible, even by
those who were fortified with pride, caution or
indifference. But, among all the nymphs of this
gay place, he did not meet with one object that
disputed the empire of his heart with Emilia;
and therefore he divided his attachment according
to the suggestions of vanity and whim; so that,
before he had resided a fortnight at the Bath, he
had set all the ladies by the cars, and furnished
all the hundred tongues of scandal with full em∣ployment.
The splendor of his appearance ex∣cited
the inquiries of envy, which, instead of
discovering any circumstance to his prejudice,
was cursed with the information of his being a
young gentleman of a good family, and heir to
an immense fortune.</P>
<P>The countenance of some of his quality∣friends,
who arrived at Bath, confirmed this
piece of intelligence: upon wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, his acquain∣tance
was c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urted and cultivated with great assi∣duity;
and he met with such advances from some
of the fair s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x, as rendered him extremely fortu∣nate
in his amours. Nor was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riend Godfrey
a stranger to favours of the same kind; his ac∣complishments
were exactly calculated for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ridian of fema<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e taste; and w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th certain indi∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duals

than the delicate proportions of his com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>n.
He accordingly reigned paramount <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mong

of certain ladies, who had long undergope
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and disgust of their husbands: while
<PB N="292" REF="301"/>
Peregrine set up his throne among those who la∣boured
under the disease of celibacy, from the
pert miss of fifteen, who, with a fluttering heart,
tosses her head, bridles up, and giggles involun∣tarily
at fight of an handsome young man, to
the staid maiden of twenty-eight, who with a
demure aspect moralizes on the vanity of beauty,
the folly of youth and simplicity of woman, and
expatiates on friendship, benevolence and good
sense, in the stile of a platonic philosopher.</P>
<P>In such a diversity of dispositions, his conquests
were attended with all the heart-burnings, ani∣mosities
and turmoils of jealousy and spite. The
younger class took all opportunities of mortifying
their seniors in public, by treating them with that
indignity which (contrary to the general privilege
of age) is by the consent and connivance of man∣kind,
levelled against those who have the mis∣fortune
to come under the denomination of old
maids; and these last retorted their hostilities in
the private machinations of slander, supported by
experience and subtilty of invention. Not one
day passed, in which some new story did not cir∣culate,
to the prejudice of one or other of those
rivals.</P>
<P>If our hero, in the long-room, chanced to
quit one of the moralists, with whom he had
been engaged in conversation, he was immediately
accosted by a number of the opposite faction,
who, with ironical smiles, upbraided him with
cruelty to the poor lady he had left, exhorted
him to have compassion on her sufferings, and
turning their eyes towards the object of their in∣tercession,
broke forth into an universal peal of
laughter. On the other hand, when Peregrine,
in consequence of having danced with one of the
<PB N="293" REF="302"/>
minors over-night, visited her in the morning,
the Platonists immediately laid hold on the occa∣sion,
tasked their imaginations, associated ideas,
and in sage insinuations retailed a thousand cir∣cumstances
of the interview, which never had
any foundation in truth. They observed, that
if girls are determined to behave with such indis∣cretion,
they must lay their accounts with in∣curring
the censure of the world; that she in
question, was old enough to act more circum∣spectly;
and wondered that her mother would
permit any young fellow to approach the cham∣ber,
while her daughter was in naked bed. As
for the servant's peeping through the key-hole, to
be sure it was an unlucky accident; but people
ought to be upon their guard against such curio∣sity,
and give their domestics no cause to employ
their penetration. These, and other such re∣flections,
were occasionally whispered as secrets
among those who were known to be communi∣cative;
so that, in a few hours, it became the
general topic of discourse; and as it had been di∣vulged
under injunctions of secrecy, it was almost
impossible to trace the scandal to its origin; be∣cause
every person concerned, must have pro∣mulgated
her own breach of trust, in discovering
her author of the report.</P>
<P>Peregrine, instead of allaying, rather exas∣perated
this contention, by an artful distribution
of his attention among the competitors; well
knowing, that should his regard be converged into
one point, he would soon forfeit the pleasure he
enjoyed, in seeing them at variance; for both
parties would join against the common enemy,
and his favourite would be persecuted by the
whole coalition. He perceived, that among the
<PB N="294" REF="303"/>
secret agents of scandal, none were so busy as
the physicians, a class of animals who live in this
place, like so many ravens hovering about a car∣case,
and even ply for employment, like scu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers
at Hungerford-stairs. The greatest part of them
have correspondents in London, who make it
their business to inquire into the history, cha∣racter,
and distemper of every one that repairs to
Bath, for the benefit of the waters; and if they
cannot procure interest to recommend their me∣dical
friends to these patients, before they set
out, they at least furnish them with a previous
account of what they could collect, that their
correspondents may use this intelligence for their
own advantage. By these means, and the as∣sistance
of flattery and assurance, they often in∣sinuate
themselves into the acquaintance of stran∣gers,
and by consulting their dispositions, become
necessary and subservient to their prevailing pos∣sions.
By their connexion with apothecaries and
nurses, they are informed of all the private oc∣currences
in each family; and therefore, enabled
to gratify the rancour of malice, amuse the spleen
of peevish indisposition, and entertain the eager∣ness
of impertient curiosity.</P>
<P>In the course of these occupations, which fre∣quently
affected the reputation of our two ad∣venturers,
this whole body fell under the dis∣pleasure
of our hero, who, after divers consulta∣tions
with his friend, concerted a stratagem,
which was practised upon the faculty in this man∣ner.
Among those who frequented the pump∣room,
was an old officer, whose temper, natu∣rally
impatient, was, by repeated attacks of the
geut, which had almost deprived him of the use
of his limbs, sublimated into a remarkable degree
<PB N="295" REF="304"/>
of virulence and perverseness: he imputed the
inveteracy of his distemper to the male practice
of a surgeon who had administered to him, while
he laboured under the consequences of an unfor∣tunate
amour; and this supposition had inspired
him with an insurmountable antipathy to all the
professors of the medical art, which was more
and more confirmed by the information of a friend
at London, who had told him, that it was a
common practice among the physicians at Bath,
to dissuade their patients from drinking the water,
that the cure, and of consequence their atten∣dance,
might be the longer protracted.</P>
<P>Thus prepossessed, he had come to Bath, and,
conformable to a few general instructions he had
received, used the waters without any farther
direction, taking all occasions of manifesting his
hatred and contempt of the sons of Aesculapius,
both by speech and gesticulations, and even by
pursuing a regimen quite contrary to that which
he knew they prescribed to others, who seemed
to be exactly in his condition. But he did not
find his account in this method, how successful
loever it may have been in other cases. His
complaints, instead of vanishing, were every day
more and more enraged; and at length he was
confined to his bed, where he lay blaspheming
from morn to night, and from night to morn
though still more determined than ever to adhere
to his former maxims.</P>
<P>In the midst of his torture, which was become
the common joke of the town, being circulated
through the industry of the physicians, who tri∣umphed
in his disaster; Peregrine, by means of
Mr. Pipes, employed a country-fellow, who had
come to market, to run with great haste, early
<PB N="296" REF="305"/>
one morning, to the lodgings of all the doctors
in town, and desire them to attend the colonel
with all imaginable dispatch. In consequence of
this summons, the whole faculty put themselves
in motion; and three of the foremost arriving at
the same instant of time, far from complimenting
one another with the door, each separately essayed
to enter, and the whole triumvirate stuck in the
passage. While they remained thus wedged to∣gether,
they descried two of their brethren post∣ing
towards the same goal, with all the speed that
God had enabled them to exert; upon which
they came to a parley, and agreed to stand by one
another. This covenant being made, they dis∣entangled
themselves, and inquiring about the pa∣tient,
were told by the servant, that he had just
fallen asleep.</P>
<P>Having received this intelligence, they took
possession of his anti-chamber, and shut the
door, while the rest of the tribe posted them∣selves
on the outside, as they arrived; so that
the whole passage was filled, from the top of the
stair-case to the street-door; and the people of
the house, together with the colonel's servant,
struck dumb with astonishment. The three
leaders of this learned gang had no sooner made
their lodgment good, than they began to consult
about the patient's malady, which every one of
them pretended to have considered with great
care and assiduity. The first who gave his opi∣nion,
said, the distemper was an obstinate Ar∣thritis;
the second affirmed, that it was no other
than a confirmed pox; and the third swore it
was an inveterate scurvy. This diversity of opi∣nions
was supported by a variety of quotations
from medical authors, ancient as well as modern;
<PB N="297" REF="306"/>
but these were not of sufficient authority, or at
least not explicit enough to decide the dispute;
for there are many schisms in medicine, as well
as in religion, and each sect can quote the fathers,
in support of the tenets they profess. In short,
the contention rose to such a pitch of clamour,
as not only alarmed their brethren on the stair,
but also waked the patient from the first nap he
had enjoyed in the space of ten whole days. Had
it been simply waking, he would have been ob∣liged
to them for the noise that disturbed him;
for, in that case, he would have been relieved
from the tortures of hell-fire, to which, in his
dream, he fancied himself exposed: but this
dreadful vision had been the result of that im∣pression
which was made upon his brain, by the
intolerable anguish of his joints; so that, when
he waked, the pain, instead of being allayed,
was rather aggravated by a greater acuteness of
sensation; and the confused vociferation in the
next room, invading his ears at the same time,
he began to think his dream was realized; and,
in the pangs of despair, applied himself to a bell
that stood by his bed-side, which he rung with
great violence and perseverance.</P>
<P>This alarm put an immediate stop to the dis∣putation
of the three doctors, who, upon this
notice of his being awake, rushed into his cham∣ber
without ceremony; and each seizing an arm,
the third made the like application to one of his
temples. Before the patient could recollect him∣self
from the amazement which had laid hold on
him, at this unexpected irruption, the room was
filled by the rest of the faculty, who followed
the servant that entered, in obedience to his
master's call; and the bed was, in a moment, sur∣rounded
<PB N="298" REF="307"/>
by these gaunt ministers of death. The
colonel, seeing himself beset with such an assem∣blage
of solemn visages and figures, which he
had always considered with the utmost detestation
and abhorrence, was incensed to a most inex∣pressible
degree of indignation; and so inspirited
by his rage, that though his tongue denied its of∣fice,
his other limbs performed their function;
he disengaged himself from the triumvirate, who
had taken possession of his body, sprung out of
bed with incredible agility, and seizing one of his
crutches, applied it so effectually to one of the
three, just as he stooped to examine the patient's
water, that his tye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>periwig dropped into the pot,
while he himself fell motionless on the floor.</P>
<P>This significant explanation disconcerted the
whole fraternity; every man turned his face, as
if it were by instinct, towards the door; and the
retreat of the community being obstructed by the
efforts of individuals, confusion and tumultuous
uproar ensued: for the colonel, far from limiting
his prowess to the first exploit, handled his wea∣pon
with astonishing vigour and dexterity, with∣out
respect of persons; so that few or none of
them had escaped without marks of his displea∣sure,
when his spirits failed, and he sunk down
again, quite exhausted, on his bed. Favoured
by this respite, the discomfited faculty collected
their hats and wigs, which had fallen off in the
fray; and perceiving the assailant too much en∣feebled
to renew the attack, set up their throats
together, and loudly threatened to prosecute him
severe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y for such an outrageous assault.</P>
<P>By this time, the landlord had interposed;
and inquir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng into the cause of the disturbance,
was informed of what had happened by the com∣plainants,
<PB N="299" REF="308"/>
who, at the same time, giving him to
understand, that they had been severally sum∣moned
to attend the colonel that morning, he
assured them, that they had been imposed upon
by some wag; for his lodger had never dream'd
of consulting any one of their profession.</P>
<P>Thunderstruck at this declaration, the general
clamour instantaneously ceased; and each, in
particular, at once comprehending the nature of
the joke, they sneaked silently off with the loss
they had sustained, in unutterable shame and mor∣tification;
while Peregrine and his friend, who
took care to be passing that way by accident,
made a full stop at sight of such an extraordinary
efflux, and enjoyed the countenance and condi∣tion
of every one as he appeared: nay, even
made up to some of those who seemed most af∣fected
with their situation, and mischievously tor∣mented
them with questions touching this un∣usual
congregation; then, in consequence of the
information they received from the landlord and
the colonel's valet, subjected the sufferers to the
ridicule of all the company in town. As it would
have been impossible for the authors of this farce
to keep themselves concealed from the indefati∣gable
inquiries of the physicians, they made no
secret of their having directed the whole; though
they took care to own it in such an ambiguous
manner, as afforded no handle of prosecution.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">They distress the housekeepers of Bath, by another
mischievous contrivance. Peregrine humbles a
noted hector, and meets with a strange character
at the house of a certain lady.</HEAD>
<P>THIS adventure was attended with another
small tour, that involved almost all the in∣habitants
of Bath in a very ludicrous scene of di∣stress.
Our hero, among his other remarks, had
observed, that in this place there was no such
utensil as a jack, and that all the spits were turned
by dogs, which never failed to appear, at the
hour of employment, with surprising exactness
and regularity: so that every family depended
with great confidence upon their known punctua∣lity,
without taking the trouble to secure them
before-hand.</P>
<P>Our companions therefore, by means of their
understrappers, who employed several chairmen
for the purpose, apprehended all these useful ani∣mals,
on Saturday at night, and confined them
in an out-house, with a view of perplexing the
people with regard to their Sunday's dinner. Nor
were they disappointed in their expectations; the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>loins being spitted at the usual time, the cook∣maid
appeared at every door almost at the same
instant, and after having earnestly cast their eyes
around, they began to run about the street, and
whistle with great vehemence, ejaculating curses
between whiles against the innocent curs, that
were d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sabled from obeying the dictates of their
duty. Frivolous as this circumstance may seem
to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was here considered as a family-concern
<PB N="301" REF="310"/>
of some consequence; for the maids having com∣municated
the affair to their respective mistresses,
every house in a twinkling sent forth its master
in a night-cap, slippers, and morning-gown, in
order to find some remedy for this dreadful ca∣lamity;
and a second concert of whistling was
performed in vain. They even assembled in
committees in the street, to deliberate on this
unheard-of defection of the dogs; and having
cudgelled their brains to no purpose, returned to
their several homes, in manifest terror of losing
a favourite meal.</P>
<P>Over and above this their distraction, which
our young gentlemen in person enjoyed, they af∣terwards
understood, that the affliction in many
houses was increased, by the miscarriage of the
shifts to which they were reduced on this occa∣sion.
One master of a family, through the per∣verseness
of his servants, was obliged to under∣take
the office of turnspit in <HI>propria persona,</HI>
to the destruction of his appetite, and the danger
of his health; another being driven to the ne∣cessity
of cutting the roast into steaks, fell sick
of mortification, and had well nigh lost his wits;
and a third having contrived to suspend the sur∣loin
before the fire, in order to be twirled about
by the hand of an attendant, the pack-thread
gave way towards the end of the operation, and
the meat falling down, discharged the contents
of the dripping-pan upon his leg, which was
scalded in a miserable manner: and what added
to their vexation, about one o'clock, when the
disappointment was most severely felt, and the
misfortune irretrievable, Peregrine ordered the
prisoners to be discharged, and every kitchen was
visited by one of these quadrupeds, as if they had
<PB N="302" REF="311"/>
come on purpose to insult the distress they had
occasioned. These, and a variety of other stra∣tagems,
practised upon the objects of ridicule,
hatred and contempt, confirmed and augmented
the reputation of our adventurers, who had, by
this time, rendered themselves terrible to all sorts
of delinquents of both sexes, from the brazen∣fronted
gamester and female libertine, to the
stale maiden that deals in scandal and strong wa∣ters,
and the puny flutterer, who seems to have
resigned all pretensions to manhood. Among
those who never failed to reside at Bath, during
the season, was a certain person, who, from the
most abject misery, had by his industry and art
at play, amassed about fifteen thousand pounds;
and though his character was notorious, insinuated
himself so far into the favour of what is called
the best company, that very few private parties
of pleasure took place, in which he was not
principally concerned. He was of a gigantic sta∣ture,
a most intrepid countenance; and his dis∣position,
naturally over-bearing, had in the course
of his adventures and success, acquired a most
intolerable degree of insolence and vanity. By
the ferocity of his features, and audacity of his
behaviour, he had obtained a reputation for the
most undaunted courage, which had been con∣firmed
by divers adventures, in which he had
humbled the most assuming heroes of his own
fraternity; so that he now reigned chief Hector
of the place, with unquestioned authority.</P>
<P>With this son of fortune was Peregrine one
evening engaged at play, and so successful, that
he could not help informing his friend of his good
luck. Godfrey hearing the description of the
loser, immediately recognized the person, whom
<PB N="303" REF="312"/>
he had known at Tunbridge; and assuring Pickle,
that he was a sharper of the first water, cau∣tioned
him against any future connexion with
such a dangerous companion, who (he affirmed)
had suffered him to win a small sum, that he
might be encouraged to lose a much greater, upon
some other occasion.</P>
<P>Our young gentleman treasured up this ad∣vice;
and though he did not scruple to give the
gamester an opportunity of retrieving his loss,
when he next day demanded his revenge, he
absolutely refused to proceed, after he had re∣funded
his winning. The other, who consi∣dered
him as a hot-headed unthinking youth, en∣deavoured
to inflame his pride to a continuance
of the game, by treating his skill with scorn and
contempt; and, among other sarcastic expres∣sions,
advising him to go to school again, before
he pretended to engage with masters of the art.
Our hero, incensed at his arrogance, replied with
great warmth, that he knew himself sufficiently
qualified for playing with men of honour, who
deal upon the square, and hoped he should always
deem it infamous, either to learn or practise the
tricks of a professed gamester. “Blood and
thunder! meaning me, Sir? (cried this artist,
raising his voice, and curling his visage into a
most intimidating frown.) Zounds! I'll cut the
throat of any scoundrel who has the presumption
to suppose, that I don't play as honourably as
e'er a nobleman in the kingdom: and I insist up∣on
an explanation from you, Sir; or, by hell
and brimstone! I shall expect other sort of satis∣faction.”
Peregrine (whose blood by this time
boiled within h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m) answered without hesitation;
“Far from thinking your demand unreasonable,
<PB N="304" REF="313"/>
I will immediately explain myself without re∣serve,
and tell you, that, upon unquestionable
authority, I believe you to be an impudent rascal
and common cheat.”</P>
<P>The Hector was so amazed and confounded at
the freedom of this declaration, which he thought
no man on earth would venture to make in his
presence, that for some minutes he could not re∣collect
himself; but, at length, whispered a chal∣lenge
in the ear of our hero, which was accord∣ingly
accepted. When they arrived next morn∣ing
upon the field, the gamester, arming his
countenance with all its terrors, advanced with a
sword of a monstrous length, and putting him∣self
in a posture, called aloud in a most terrific
voice, “Draw, damn ye, draw; I will this
instant send you to your fathers.” The youth
was not slow in complying with his desire; his
weapon was unsheathed in a moment, and he
began the attack with such unexpected spirit and
address, that his adversary, having made shift
with great difficulty to parry the first pass, re∣treated
a few paces, and demanded a parley, in
which he endeavoured to persuade the young
man, that to lay a man of his character under
the necessity of chastising his insolence, was the
most rash and inconsiderate step that he could
possibly have taken; but, that he had compassion
upon his youth, and was willing to spare him, if
he would surrender his sword, and promise to ask
pardon in public for the offence he had given.
Pickle was so much exasperated at this unparallelled
effrontery, that, without deigning to make the
least reply, he slung his own hat in the proposer's
face, and renewed the charge with such un∣daunted
agility, that the gamester, finding him∣self
<PB N="305" REF="314"/>
in manifest hazard of his life, betook him∣self
to his heels, and fled homewards with in∣credible
speed, being closely pursued by Pere∣grine,
who having sheathed his sword, pelted
him with stones as he ran, and compelled him to
go, that same day, into banishment from Bath,
where he had domineered so long.</P>
<P>By this atchievement, which was the subject of
astonishment to all the company, who had looked
upon the fugitive as a person of heroic courage,
our adventurer's reputation was rendered formi∣dable
in all its circumstances; although he thereby
disobliged a good many people of fashion, who
had contracted an intimacy of friendship with the
exile, and who resented his disgrace, as if it had
been the misfortune of a worthy man. These
generous patrons, however, bore a very small
proportion to those who were pleased with the
event of the duel; because, in the course of their
residence at Bath, they had either been insulted
or defrauded by the challenger. Nor was this
instance of our hero's courage unacceptable to
the ladies, few of whom could now resist the
united force of such accomplishments. Indeed,
neither he nor his friend Godfrey would have
found much difficulty in picking up an agreeable
companion for life; but Gauntlet's heart was pre∣engaged
to Sophy; and Pickle, exclusive of his
attachment to Emily, which was stronger than he
himself imagined, possessed such a share of am∣bition,
as could not be satisfied with the conquest
of any female he beheld at Bath.</P>
<P>His visits were, therefore, promiscuous, with∣out
any other view than that of amusement; and
though his pride was flattered by the advances of
the fair whom he had captivated, he never har∣boured
<PB N="306" REF="315"/>
one thought of proceeding beyond the li∣mits
of common gallantry, and carefully avoided
all particular explanations. But, what above all
other enjoyments yielded him the most agreeable
entertainment, was the secret history of cha∣racters,
which he learn'd from a very extraordi∣nary
person, with whom he became acquainted
in this manner.</P>
<P>Being at the house of a certain lady, on a vi∣siting-day,
he was struck with the appearance of
an old man, who no sooner entered the room
than the mistress of the house very kindly de∣sired
one of the wits present to roast the old put.
This petit maitre, proud of the employment,
went up to the senior, who had something ex∣tremely
peculiar and significant in his counte∣nance,
and saluting him with divers fashionable
congés, accosted him in these words: “Your
servant, you old rascal. I hope to have the ho∣nour
of seeing you hang'd. I vow to Gad! you
look extremely shocking, with these gummy
eyes, lanthorn jaws, and toothless chaps. What!
you squint at the ladies, you old rotten medlar?
Yes, yes, we understand your ogling; but you
must content yourself with a cook-maid, sink
me! I see you want to sit. These wither'd
shanks of yours tremble under their burthen:
but you must have a little patience, old Hirco;
indeed you must. I intend to mortify you a
little longer, curse me!”</P>
<P>The company was so tickled with this address,
which was delivered with much grimace and
gesticulation, that they burst out into a loud fit
of laughter, which they fathered upon a mon∣key
that was chained in the room; and when
the peal was over, the wit renewed his attack,
<PB N="307" REF="316"/>
in these words: “I suppose you are fool enough
to think this mirth was occasioned by Pug: ay,
there he is; you had best survey him; he is of
your own family, switch me: but the laugh was
at your expence; and you ought to thank hea∣ven
for making you so ridiculous.” While he
uttered these ingenious ejaculations, the old
gentleman bowed alternately to him and the
monkey, that seemed to grin and chatter in imi∣tation
of the beau, and with an arch solemnity
of visage, pronounced, “Gentlemen, as I have
not the honour to understand your compliments,
they will be much better bestowed on each other.”
So saying, he seated himself, and had the satis∣faction
to see the laugh returned upon the ag∣gressor,
who remained confounded and abashed,
and in a few minutes left the room, muttering,
as he retired, “the old fellow grows scurrilous,
stap my breath.”</P>
<P>While Peregrine wondered in silence at this
extraordinary scene, the lady of the house per∣ceiving
his surprize, gave him to understand,
that the ancient visitant was utterly bereft of the
sense of hearing; that his name was Cadwallader
Crabtree; his disposition altogether misanthropi∣cal;
and that he was admitted into company on
account of the entertainment he afforded by his
sarcastic observations, and the pleasant mistakes
to which he was subject from his infirmity. Nor
did our hero wait a long time for an illustration
of this odd character. Every sentence he spoke
was replete with gall; nor did his satire consist
in general reflections, but in a series of remarks,
which had been made through the medium of a
most whimsical peculiarity of opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="317"/>
Among those who were present at this assembly
was a young officer, who having by dint of in∣terest
obtained a seat in the lower house, thought
it incumbent upon him to talk of affairs of state;
and accordingly regaled the company with an ac∣count
of a secret expedition which the French
were busied in preparing; assuring them, that he
had it from the mouth of the minister, to whom
it had been transmitted by one of his agents
abroad. In descanting upon the particulars of
the armament, he observed, that they had twenty
ships of the line, ready manned and victualled at
Brest, which were destined for Toul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, where
they would be joined by as many more; and
from thence proceed to the execution of their
scheme, which he imparted as a secret not fit to
be divulged.</P>
<P>This piece of intelligence being communicated
to all the company, except Mr. Crabtree, who
suffered by his loss of hearing, that cynic was
soon after accosted by a lady, who, by means of
an artificial alphabet, formed by a certain con∣junction
and disposition of the singers, asked if
he had heard any extraordinary news of late?
Cadwallader, with his usual complaisance, re∣plied,
that he supposed she took him for a courier
or spy, by teizing him eternally with that que∣stion.
He then expatiated upon the foolish cu∣riosity
of mankind, which, he said, mus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either
proceed from idleness or want of ideas; and re∣peated
almost verbatim the officer's information,
as a vague ridiculous report, invented by some
ignorant coxcomb, who wanted to give himself
airs of importance, and believed only by those
who were utterly unacquainted with the politics
and strength of the French nation.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="318"/>
In confirmation of what he had advanced, he
endeavoured to demonstrate how impossible it
must be for that people to fit out even the third
part of such a navy, so soon after the losses they
had sustained during the war; and confirmed his
proof by asserting, that, to his certain know∣ledge,
the harbours of Brest and Toulon could
not at that time produce a squadron of eight ships
of the line.</P>
<P>The member, who was an utter stranger to
this misanthrope, hearing his own asseverations
treated with such contempt, glowed with confu∣sion
and resentment, and raising his voice, began
to defend his own veracity with great eagerness
and trepidation, mingling with his arguments
many blustering invectives against the insolence
and ill manners of his supposed contradictor, who
sat with the most mortifying composure of coun∣tenance,
till the officer's patience was quite ex∣hausted;
and then, to the manifest increase of
his vexation, he was informed, that his antago∣nist
was so deaf, that, in all probability, the last
trumpet would make no impression upon him,
without a previous renovation of his organs.</P>

who favours him with a short sketch of
his own history.</HEAD>
<P>PEregrine was extremely well pleased at this
occasional rebuke, which occurred so sea∣sonably,
that he could scarce believe it accidental.
He looked upon Cadwallader as the greatest cu∣riosity
he had ever known, and cultivated the old
<PB N="310" REF="319"/>
man's acquaintance with such insinuating address,
that in less than a fortnight he obtained his con∣fidence;
and as they one day walked into the fields
together, the Manhater disclos'd himself, in these
words: “Tho' the term of our communication
has been but short, you must have perceived,
that I treat you with uncommon marks of re∣gard;
which, I assure you, is not owing to your
personal accomplishments, nor the pains you take
to oblige me; for the first I overlook, and the
last I see through: but there is something in
your disposition which indicates a rooted con∣tempt
for the world, and I understand you have
made some successful efforts, in exposing one
part of it to the ridicule of the other. It is upon
this assurance, that I offer you my advice and
assistance, in prosecuting other schemes of the
same nature; and to convince you that such an
alliance is not to be rejected, I will now give you
a short sketch of my history, which will be pub∣lished
after my death, in forty seven volumes of
my own compiling.</P>
<P>I was born about forty miles from this place,
of parents who having a very old family-name to
support, bestowed their whole fortune on my el∣der
brother; so that I inherited of my father
little else than a large share of choler, to which
I am indebted for a great many adventures that
did not always end to my satisfaction. At the
age of eighteen I was sent up to town, with a
recommendation to a certain peer, who found
means to amuse me with the promise of a com∣mission,
for seven whole years; and 'tis odds but
I should have made my fortune by my perseve∣rance,
had not I been arrested, and thrown into
the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shalsea by my landlord, on whose credit
<PB N="311" REF="320"/>
I had subsisted three years, after my father had
renounced me as an idle vagabond. There I re∣mained
six months, among those prisoners who
have no other support than chance charity; and
contracted a very valuable acquaintance, which
was of great service to me in the future emergen∣cies
of my life.</P>
<P>I was no sooner discharged, in consequence of
an act of parliament for the relief of insolvent
debtors, than I went to the house of my credi∣tor,
whom I cudgelled without mercy; and that
I might leave nothing undone of those things
which I ought to have done, my next stage was
to Westminster-hall, where I waited until my
patron came forth from the house, and saluted
him with a blow that laid him senseless on the
pavement: but my retreat was not so fortunate
as I could have wished, the chairmen and lac∣quies
in waiting having surrounded and disarmed
me in a trice, I was committed to Newgate,
and loaded with chains; and a very sagacious
gentleman, who was afterwards hanged, having
sat in judgment upon my case, pronounced me
guilty of a capital crime, and foretold my con∣demnation
at the Old Baily. His prognostic,
however, was disappointed; for no body appear∣ing
to prosecute me at the next sessions, I was
discharged, by order of the court. It would be
impossible for me to recount, in the compass of
one day's conversation, all the particular exploits
in which I bore a considerable share: suffice it to
say, I have been, at different times, prisoner in
all the jails within the bills of mortality. I have
broke from every round-house on this side
Temple-bar. No bailiff, in the days of my
youth and desperation, durst execute a writ up∣on
<PB N="312" REF="321"/>
me without a dozen followers; and the
justices themselves trembled when I was brought
before them.</P>
<P>I was once maimed by a carman, with whom
I quarrelled, because he ridiculed my leek on St.
David's day; my skull was fractured by a but∣cher's
cleaver, on the like occasion. I have
been run thro' the body five times, and lost the
tip of my left ear by a pistol bullet. In a ren∣counter
of this kind, having left my antagonist
for dead, I was wise enough to make my retreat
into France; and a few days after my arrival at
Paris entering into conversation with some offi∣cers
on the subject of politics, a dispute arose, in
which I lost my temper, and spoke so irreverent∣ly
of the <HI>Grand Monarque,</HI> that next morning I
was sent to the bastile, by virtue of a <HI>Lettre de
Cachet.</HI> There I remained for some months, de∣prived
of all intercourse with rational creatures;
a circumstance for which I was not sorry, as I
had the more time to project schemes of revenge
against the tyrant who confined me, and the
wretch who had betrayed my private conversa∣tion:
but tired, at length, with these fruitless
suggestions, I was fain to unbend the severity of
my thoughts by a correspondence with some in∣dustrious
spiders, who had hung my dungeon
with their ingenious labours.</P>
<P>I considered their work with such attention,
that I soon became an adept in the mystery of
weaving, and furnished myself with as many use∣ful
observations and reflections on that art, as
will compose a very curious treatise, which I in∣tend
to bequeath to the Royal Society, for the
benefit of our woolen manufacture; and this
with a view to perpetuate my own name, rather
<PB N="313" REF="322"/>
than befriend my country: for, thank heaven!
I am weaned from all attachments of that kind,
and look upon myself as one very little obliged to
any society whatsoever. Although I presided with
absolute power over this long-legg'd community,
and distributed rewards and punishments to each,
according to his deserts, I grew impatient of
my situation; and my natural disposition, one
day, prevailing, like a fire which had long been
smothered, I wreaked the fury of my indignation
upon my innocent subjects, and in a twinkling
destroyed the whole race. While I was employed
in this general massacre, the turnkey, who
brought me food, opening the door, and per∣ceiving
my transport, shrugged up his shoulders,
and leaving my allowance, went out, pronouncing,
<HI>Le pauvre diable! la tele lui tourne.</HI> My passion
no sooner subsided than I resolved to profit by
this opinion of the jailor, and from that day coun∣terfeited
lunacy with such success, that in less
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> three months I was delivered from the
bastile, and sent to the gallies, in which they
thought my bodily vigour might be of service,
although the faculties of my mind were decayed.
Before I was chained to the oar, I received three
hundred stripes by way of welcome, that I might
thereby be rendered more tractable, notwith∣standing
I used all the arguments in my power to
persuade them, I was only <HI>mad north, north west,
and when the wind was southerly, knew a hawk
from an hand-saw.</HI></P>
<P>In our second cruize we had the good fortune
to be overtaken by a tempest, during which the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aves were unbound, that they might contribute
the more to the preservation of the galley, and
<PB N="314" REF="323"/>
have a chance for their lives, in case of a ship∣wreck.
We were no sooner at liberty, than
making ourselves masters of the vessel, we robbed
the officers, and ran her on shore among rocks
on the coast of Portugal; from whence I hasten∣ed
to Lisbon, with a view of obtaining my pas∣sage
in some ship bound for England, where, by
this time, I hoped my affair would be for∣gotten.</P>
<P>But before this scheme could be accomplished,
my evil genius led me into company; and being
intoxicated, I began to broach doctrines on the
subject of religion, at which some of the partie
were scandalized and incensed; and I was next
day dragged out of bed by the officers of the in∣quisition,
and conveyed to a cell in the prison
belonging to that tribunal.</P>
<P>At my first examination my resentment was
strong enough to support me under the torture,
which I endured without flinching; but my re∣solution
abated, and my zeal immediately cool∣ed,
when I understood from a fellow-prisoner,
who groaned on the other side of the partition,
that in a short time there would be an <HI>Auto de
Fe;</HI> in consequence of which I would, in all
probability, be doomed to the flames, if I would
not renounce my heretical errors, and submit to
such penance as the church should think fit to
prescribe. This miserable wretch was convicted
of Judaism, which he had privately practised, by
connivance, for many years, until he had amassed
a fortune sufficient to attract the regard of the
church. To this he fell a sacrifice, and accordingly
prepared himself for the stake; while I, not at all
ambitious of the crown of martyrdom, resolved
<PB N="315" REF="324"/>
to temporize: so that, when I was brought to
the question the second time, I made a solemn
recantation; and, as I had no worldly fortune to
obstruct my salvation, was received into the bo∣som
of the church, and, by way of penance, en∣joined
to walk barefoot to Rome, in the habit of
a pilgrim.</P>
<P>During my peregrination thro Spain, I was
detained as a spy, until I could procure creden∣tials
from the inquisition at Lisbon; and behaved
with such resolution and reserve, that, after be∣ing
released, I was deemed a proper person to be
employed in quality of a secret intelligencer, at
a certain court. This office I undertook, with∣out
hesitation; and being furnished with money
and bills of credit, crossed the Pyrenees, with
intention to revenge myself upon the Spaniard
for the severities I had undergone, during my
captivity.</P>
<P>Having therefore effectually disguised myself,
by a change of dress, and a large patch on one
eye, I hired an equipage, and appeared at Bo∣logna,
in quality of an itinerant physician; in
which capacity I succeeded tolerably well, till
my servants decamped in the night, with my
baggage, and left me in the condition of Adam.
In short, I have travelled over the greatest part
of Europe, as a beggar, pilgrim, priest, soldier,
gamester, and quack; and felt the extremes of
indigence and opulence, with the inclemency of
weather, in all its vicissitudes. I have learned
that the characters of mankind are every where
the same; that common sense and honesty bear
an infinitely small proportion to folly and vice;
and that life is at best a paulty province.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="325"/>
After having suffered innumerable hardships,
dangers, and disgraces, I returned to London,
where I lived some years in a garret, and picked
up a subsistence, such as it was, by vending purges
in the streets, from the back of a pied horse; in
which situation I used to harrangue the mob, in
broken English, under pretence of being an High
German doctor.</P>
<P>At last an uncle died, by whom I inherit an
estate of three hundred pounds per annum, tho',
in his life-time, he would not have parted with a
six-pence, to save my soul and body from perdi∣tion.</P>
<P>I now appear in the world, not as a member
of any community, or what is called a social crea∣ture;
but meerly as a spectator, who entertains
himself with the grimaces of a jack-pudding, and
banquets his spleen in beholding his enemies at
l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggerheads. That I may enjoy this disposition,
abstracted from all interruption, danger, and par∣ticipation,
I seign myself deaf; an expedient by
which I not only avoid all disputes, and their
consequences, but also become master of a thou∣sand
little secrets, which are every day whis∣pered
in my presence, without any suspicion of
their being overheard. You saw how I handled
that shallow politician at my lady Plausi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le's the
other day. The same method I practise upon
the crazed tory, the bigot whig, the four super∣cilious
pedant, the petulant critic, the blustering
coward, the sawning tool, the pert pimp, sly
sharper, and every other species of knaves and
fools with which this kingdom abounds.</P>
<P>In consequence of my rank and character I
obtain free admission to the ladies, among whom
<PB N="317" REF="326"/>
I have obtained the appellation of the Scandalous
Chronicle; and as I am considered (while silent)
in no other light than that of a footstool or elbow
chair, they divest their conversation of all re∣straint
before me, and gratify my sense of hear∣ing
with strange things, which (if I could pre∣vail
upon myself to give the world that satisfac∣tion)
would compose a curious piece of secret hi∣story,
and exhibit a quite different idea of cha∣racters
from what is commonly entertained.</P>
<P>By this time, young gentleman, you may per∣ceive,
that I have it in my power to be a valu∣able
correspondent; and that it will be your in∣terest
to deserve my confidence.”</P>

<DIV2 N="78" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXXVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A treaty is concluded betwixt Cadwallader and our
hero; in consequence of which divers pleasant ad∣ventures
occur, until the young gentleman is sum∣moned
to the garison on a very interesting oc∣casion.</HEAD>
<P>HEre the Misanthrope left off speaking, de∣sirous
to know the sentiments of our he∣ro,
who embraced the proffered alliance, in a
transport of joy and surprize; and the treaty was
no sooner concluded than Mr. Crabtree began to
perform articles, by imparting to him a thousand
delicious secrets, from the possession of which he
promised himself innumerable scenes of mirth and
enjoyment. By means of this associate, whom
he considered as the ring of Gyges, he foresaw
that he should be enabled to penetrate not only
into the chambers but even to the inmost thoughts
<PB N="318" REF="327"/>
of the female sex; and, in order to ward off suspi∣cion,
they agreed to revile each other in public,
and meet at a certain private rendezvous, to
communicate their mutual discoveries, and con∣cert
their future operations. So precious did Pe∣regrine
esteem this treasure, that he would not
even make his friend Godfrey acquainted with
his good fortune, tho' the first use he made of it,
was in behalf of that young gentleman, whom
he undeceived in two very interesting particulars.</P>
<P>The soldier's addresses were, at that time,
shared betwixt two ladies, who received them
in a very different manner. By one of them he
was caress'd with marks of particular regard, and
by small favours flattered with the expectation of
supreme success; while the other treated him
with such severity and shyness, that he could
never find an opportunity or resolution to make
an unrestricted declaration of his flame. As every
woman has a confidant, to whom she pours forth
her heart on these occasions, Mr. Crabtree hap∣pened
to be present when each of them disbur∣thened
herself of her sentiments with regard to
her lover; and learned from their own confes∣sions,
that the frank lady cajoled him for the
sake of the money which he suffered himself to
lose at cards, though she had not the least in∣tention
to extend her complaisance beyond the
limits of exterior civilities; while the prude was
actually enamoured of his person, and through a
remnant of modesty avoided him for no other
reason, but because she knew herself incapable
of resisting his sollicitations.</P>
<P>Mr. Gauntlet profited by this discovery, which
was communicated to him through the canal of
<PB N="319" REF="328"/>
his friend, relinquished the mercenary coquet,
and found means to vanquish the reserve of the
other. Peregrine himself was, in like manner,
set to rights, in certain opinions he had conceived
of his own influence with particular ladies; and
as no person ever offended him with impunity,
he projected a scheme of vengeance against a re∣markable
inamorato, who to his assiduities pre∣ferred
those of a brawny fellow, that, from the
place of a private trooper in the horse-guards, had
been preferred to the rank of a lieutenant, by
the interest of a dowager lately deceased. With
this favourite did the lady make an assignation,
in the hearing of Cadwallader, who gave our
hero to understand, that he was to be received
by her woman, in the dark, at a parlour-door
that opened into a small garden, the wall of
which he could easily overleap, after the servants
should be retired to rest.</P>
<P>Peregrine, fraught with this intelligence, re∣solved
to anticipate his rival; and accordingly,
by the ministration of his companion, engaged a
couple of stout chairmen, who being posted on
the spot, seized the lover in his endeavours to
furmount the wall, and conveyed him to a place
of confinement, on pretence of supposing his de∣sign
was to rob the house. He was no sooner
secured in this manner, than Pickle, being de∣termined
to prosecute the adventure, transported
himself into the garden, and personating the lieu∣tenant,
went to the door, made the signal
which had been agreed upon, was admitted by
the attendant, conducted to her lady's apartment,
that was darkened for her reception; and having
enjoyed his revenge, with every circumstance of
<PB N="320" REF="329"/>
satisfaction, made his retreat before day, with∣out
being discovered, after having been gratified
with a valuable ring, as a testimony of her lady∣ship's affection.</P>
<P>Mean while the disappointed captive finding
himself involved in a troublesome affair, that must
end either in his own disgrace, or in that of his
mistress, whom he could not with honour expose,
employed all his art in tampering with his de∣tainers,
who pretended to have detected him as
they passed that way by accident, and who would
not listen to the terms he proposed for his release
until it was almost day; and then, by the per∣mission
of their employers, they set him at liber∣ty,
in consideration of five guineas, which he di∣vided
between them. From the time of his dis∣charge
he waited with the utmost impatience for
the hour of breakfast, and when it approached
hied him to the house of his Dulcinea, with a
view of excusing himself for the breach of punc∣tuality
he was obliged to commit.</P>
<P>He was confounded at the air of satisfaction and
complacency that manifested itself in the lady's
appearance; but believing it was no other than
affectation, to conceal her inward disquiet and
chagrin, he assumed a most dejected look, and
with many expressions of mortification recounted
the cursed accident which had disabled him from
reaping the delicious fruits of his expectation.
The nymph, who was not all subject to the vul∣gar
symptoms of confusion, hearing this circum∣stantial
detail, fixed her eyes upon the soldier's
countenance, and regarding him attentively for
some minutes; “If this declaration (said she) be
an effort of your delicacy, you may spare such
<PB N="321" REF="330"/>
ridiculous reserve for the future. When things
are come to a certain pass, such ceremony is su∣perfluous
and disagreeable. But perhaps you re∣member
your good fortune with regret, and ac∣tually
wish you had met with that adventure you
have been at such pains to feign, rather than
have enjoyed so cheap a conquest. Indeed you
was so impatient to be gone before morning, that
you seemed rather tired of your stay, than sollicit∣ous
about my reputation.”</P>
<P>The trooper, amazed and alarmed at this un∣expected
address, swore with many vulgar exe∣crations,
that he could prove he was in custody
from twelve till six o'clock in the morning; and
that he began to perceive he had been finely flung
by some rascal, who had visited her in his place.
He even hinted a suspicion, that the whole affair
had been transacted by her connivance; and be∣came
extremely rough and unmannerly in his ex∣postulations:
so that the lady, who had more of
the tygress than of the lamb in her disposition,
being exasperated at the freedom of his behaviour,
ordered him down stairs, and (to use the com∣mon
phrase) forbad him her house. He accord∣ingly
retired, not without many invectives and
threats, which he bawled aloud in his march;
while his incensed patroness, by this time sensible
that she had been the dupe of some stratagem, re∣mained
in a state of unspeakable anxiety and
mortification. Being blessed, however, with a
great share of penetration, she forthwith set it at
work; and, after some recollection, concluded
that the substitute could be no other than Pere∣grine,
who had either learned the circumstance
of the assignation from her maid, or extracted
<PB N="322" REF="331"/>
them from the vanity and indiscretion of the gal∣lant
himself.</P>
<P>Now that she had an opportunity of being ac∣quainted
with all our young gentleman's qualifi∣cations,
she did not repine at the <HI>qui pro quo</HI>
which had been played upon her, and resolved to
transfer her good graces to Peregrine, without
reserve. With this view she favoured him
with the most palpable advances and allusions,
which he would not understand, but on the
contrary, conveyed the ring to her in a letter,
written in a counterfeited character, with a feign∣ed
name, importing, that as he had reason to be∣lieve
the token was intended for another, he could
not in conscience reserve it for his own use: and
to crown her vexation, by his contrivance, every
circumstance of the story was divulged, except
the name of the person who had represented the
lover.</P>
<P>While our adventurer thus enjoyed his dispo∣sition,
he was summoned to the castle by an ex∣press
from his friend Hatchway, representing that
the commodore lay at the point of death; and in
less than an hour after the receipt of this melan∣choly
piece of news, he set out post for his uncle's
habitation, having previously taken leave of his
associate Crabtree, who promised to meet him in
two months at London, and settled a correspon∣dence
with Gauntlet, who proposed to remain at
Bath during the remaining part of the season.</P>
