<HEAD>PROLOGUE,</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mr. <HI>Betterton</HI>.</BYLINE>
<L>YOU, who in furious Factions take Delight,</L>
<L>Know, you are not to be regal'd to Night;</L>
<L>These Scenes do no one sparring Blow afford,</L>
<L>But Peace and Moderation is the Word:</L>
<L>No side, nor Man on either side, is hit,</L>
<L>We single out no Courtier, Clown, or Cit,</L>
<L>And if you're angry, 'tis all wrong, you're bit.</L>
<L>Nor let the well-bred Man, of Parts and Taste,</L>
<L>Look sharp for Dainties at a Country Feast;</L>
<L>Expect no sprightly Turns, nor Language here,</L>
<L>But rest contented with your homely Chear,</L>
<L>'Tis such as we cou'd get at <HI>Croydon</HI> Fair.</L>
<L>Our Men of Mirth have never been at Court,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Beaux,</HI> and <HI>Belles,</HI> and gentler Wits resort,</L>
<L>Biters indeed! and of the better sort.</L>
<L>To bare bambouz'ling we may chance pretend,</L>
<L>Or by the Christen Name to catch a Friend;</L>
<L>But to some happier Wit we leave to tell,</L>
<L>Of those who in true Biting most excel.</L>
<L>For that great Work old Bards shall rise again,</L>
<L>And the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Maids renew the lofty Strain.</L>
<L>Let not a Rival Writer stir up Spight</L>
<L>In you, who judge of Comedy, or Write;</L>
<L>For tho' fond Parents on their Off-spring doat,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Ideot Author loves the Brat he got;</L>
<L>Yet ours gives freely up his <HI>Petit Piece,</HI></L>
<L>And swears that you may use it as you please:</L>
<L>Nay, shou'd you take his Drolling in good part,</L>
<L>He owns this only as a youthful Start,</L>
<L>And sets no Claim up to the Comick Art.</L>
<L>So when keen Patriots pursue the Chace,</L>
<L>The shifting Statesman yields, and sues for Grace,</L>
<L>And to preserve his Carcase quits his Place.</L>

<LG>
<L>OF all the Taxes which the Poet pays,</L>
<L>Those Funds of Verse, none are so hard to raise</L>
<L>As Prologues and as Epilogues to Plays.</L>
<L>So many mighty Wits are gone before,</L>
<L>Th' have rifled all the Muses sacred Store;</L>
<L>Like Conqu'ring Armies thro' the Province pass'd,</L>
<L>Swept all, and left it ruin'd, void and waste.</L>
<L>Yet, Conscientious you can still demand</L>
<L>Large Contributions from the wretched Land;</L>
<L>Expect that we should still pursue the Theam,</L>
<L>Tho' you deny to us, what you allow'd to them.</L>

<L>Bold Satyr then you did permit to reign,</L>
<L>Satyr, that Noise and Nonsense cou'd restrain;</L>
<L>Then to be pleas'd and taught the H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arers came,</L>
<L>They got Instruction, and the Poet Fame.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Strephon</HI>'s Verse to either Sex gave Law,</L>
<L>And Charm'd the Fair, and kept the Fools in Awe.</L>
<L>But now, for Reasons to your selves best known,</L>
<L>Your Fathers Wit and Pleasures you disown;</L>
<L>Hither ye Herds of Fools securely come;</L>
<L>Prologue and Epilogue,</L>

<L>We Women think it hard, when Laws prevail</L>
<L>That take away our Privilege to rail;</L>
<L>Maids, Wives and Mistresses, assert the Cause,</L>
<L>In spight of <HI>Reforma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion</HI> and the Laws:</L>
<L>And tho' the censur'd Stage no Tales must tell,</L>
<L>Yet Visiting-Days and Tea may do as well.</L>
<L><PB REF="4"/>Henceforth, in solemn Meetings of the Fair,</L>
<L>Our own dear Sex and all their Failings spare;</L>
<L>Let no ill-natur'd She severely say</L>
<L>What hideous ill-dress'd Things she saw that Day:</L>
<L>Let envious Ugliness no more reprove</L>
<L>Her fairer Friend's successful Pow'r in Love;</L>
<L>But let each able Tongue do all she can,</L>
<L>Let Satyr be the Word, and the whole Subject Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tell of dull Knights, sad Squires, and wretched Cits,</L>
<L><HI>Displaying</HI> Poets, and brisk biting Wits;</L>
<L>Then say, what Wine, what Friends, what choice Delights,</L>

<L>Lash ev'ry Fool, of ev'ry Kind and Fashion,</L>

<P>Dear <HI>Cletimont</HI>, I have Ten Thousand Pardons to beg of you; I trespass upon your Patience at a strange rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cl.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, truce with your Compliments; and, if you please, let us come to the Matter in hand — Yon new House is my Uncle's.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cl.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He has been there with his Daughter these Three Days, —you are in love with her, have a mind to marry her; — he's a fantastical obstinate old Fellow, and resolves against parting either with her or his Mony, but to a Cox∣comb of his own chusing; who (by the way) came down in the same Coach with me to day,—so that unless we can find out some Stratagem to make an Ass of him, and a happy Man of you, poor <HI>Angelica</HI> must die a Maid, or marry the Fool, as aforesaid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Frie.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>In order to that we have already taken all measures, tho' I must own I apprehend some Difficulty in the Execu∣tion of 'em —Did the Booby Lover that came with you know you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cl.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all. —I'll assure you he's a most extraordi∣nary Person, and a Biter, as his miserable Fellow-Travel∣lers, the very Coachman, and indeed every body we met upon the Road found to their Cost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Frie.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Devil he is! That new Generation of Wags are the most insufferable Teizers!—It happens luckily e∣nough; for your Uncle has met with 'em some where or o∣ther, and I suppose has been bit to the purpose, for he raves at the very mention of the Word, swears 'tis a villai∣nous Design to corrupt all our Morality, and breed up our Youth in the Practice of early Lying; he hopes to see it made Felony by Act of Parliament.—I perceive my
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
Rival will hardly prove so formidable as we took him to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Tr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Fear nothing, Sir; Rug's the Word, all's safe. For the old Gentleman, leave him to me. This Fair-time gives his Country Neighbours a Liberty of coming to his House, tho' the Inside of it at another time is as hard to be seen as a fortify'd Place in the time of War,—but the Devil's in him if he can keep us out now:—I have engag'd two or three very pretty Fellows here of the Town to be of the Party with us, smart Dogs for the contriving part, and of most invincible passive Courage to go thro' with the Execution,—they have had the Honour to be beaten black and blue in several Adventures already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Cl.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>For the rest, the lovely <HI>Mariana</HI>, your charming Kinswoman, has engag'd a notable Limb of the Law, a Ci∣ty Sollicitor, in your Interests;—if there be any thing in his way of Roguery to do you Service you may depend upon him. My Uncle is luckily enough too in Love with <HI>Mariana</HI>, to a very ridiculous Extravagance; and when a Woman of Wit and Beauty has an old Fellow under those Circumstances, she seldom fails of a Secret to make him pliant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>But can you, who are so delicate a Lover, allow <HI>Mariana</HI> to make any Advances to this extravagant Uncle of yours?</P>

<P>Well, dear <HI>Clever</HI>, never talk, for this <HI>Croydon</HI> is a most insufferable filthy Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There's a great deal of Hurry, Dust and Noise in∣deed. And yet so there are at <HI>May</HI> Fair and <HI>Bartholemew</HI> Fair, where all the World come.—Methinks this Place is as diverting as those are, and the People are as merry here as there, tho' they are not so well dress'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dress'd! the Creatures! why, Child, Dressing's a reasonable thing—one must have a fine Wit, delicate and well turn'd, to be able to Dress.— The things that come here never think, they love Walnuts and Sack, and fat
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
Goose, and seeing of Monsters, and laughing <HI>á Gorge de∣ployeé</HI>, but they never think.—Well I am perfectly glad I have met thee.—I'll swear I believe I am the only Wo∣man of Condition here.—I'll swear I'm in the last Con∣fusion to think I could have so much Complaisance for <HI>Friendly</HI> to come hither.—I'll swear I believe you must think me furiously fond, to let him engage me in a Party so horribly upon the ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We have dropt him some where in the Crowd, and I fancy 'tis that makes you so uneasie.—Come, Madam, confess, is it not Jealousie, rather than Complaisance, en∣gages you in all <HI>Friendly</HI>'s Parties? To give the Man his due, methought he was not so very pressing for your Com∣pany hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Jealous! poor <HI>Clever</HI>! I jealous of the Fellow! I swear, Madam, you're as much mistaken, Madam, as perhaps you ever were in your Life, Madam. After all, when one is made so very much to one's Advantage, so a∣greeable, so handsom, so every thing in the World, and when one has so fine a Discernment to understand it very well one's self, Jealousie is a Passion that perhaps after all is as little troublesome as any Passion in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Madam! all the World must confess how bountiful Nature has been to you, even to the last Prodi∣gality of Gifts and Graces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, and between Friends, Child, I don't think my Person has done Nature one jot of Discredit— What do you think? ha! as long as good Faces have been in Fashion, she never finish'd one more to her Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, Madam, take your Person all together you have all the reason in the World to be satisfy'd with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my Dear, that I am, upon my Word;—for, as I was saying, I think I may, without Affectation, aver that I am handsom, rich, nay and young too, in spight of all the little insignificant World may say to the contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true—that same World is the De∣vil— the ridiculous ways they have got in that World!— You shall have 'em, when they are vex'd at their Hearts that
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
they grow old themselves, fancy that every Body else grows old in proportion as they do: You shall have 'em, because they happen'd to Dance at a Ball with a Woman, in the merry Days of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, cry, smoak the reverend Gentlewoman, tho' she has as much Cherry-colour'd Ribbon, and black Hair fruz'd out as any Toast of 'em all, and never miss'd the Front-Box of a new Play these Thirty Years.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The World is full of Impertinences— but you may take my Word for it, that I am young, very young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh dear Madam! you don't think there is any oc∣casion to convince me of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, Child, not at all as to that;—but besides now, besides all these Accomplishments, I ought to pique my self somewhat upon my Birth and Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is very hard now, as to this damn'd World again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As how, dear <HI>Clever?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As how? why that there should be such a thing as Scandal — that Virtue and Merit, like your Ladyships, should run the Gantlet thro' so many Visiting Days every Week.—Why I believe I have heard a Thousand Peo∣ple say, that you never had Father or Mother, Uncle or Aunt, Sister or Brother, that your self or any other Body knew of—nay, not so much as a Husband, tho' your Ladyship has had the Misfortune to be a disconsolate Wi∣dow for so many Years last past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This is pleasant I vow! but, dear <HI>Clever</HI>, this is particularly pleasant—the ridiculous World! as if eve∣ry Body did not know my Family.—I'd have 'em to comprehend I have Two as fine young Gentlemen as ever wore Gowns at the University —the worst of 'em, (and indeed I think that is <HI>Jeremy</HI>) the worst of'em understands <HI>Hebrew</HI> — And then my Neice at <HI>Hackney</HI> is the pretti∣est witty Creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Madam, 'tis not your Fertility is in Question, no Body can have the Impudence to dispute that part of
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
your Family—Your Posterity is all safe, but 'tis con∣cerning your Illustrious Ancestors that the Doubt is rais'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Folly to the last degree!—I swear you begin to be mighty entertaining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You'll pardon me, Madam, that I have dealt so very freely with your Ladyship—You'll allow for the Sincerity of Friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh by all means, my Dear, you wrong me to suspect the contrary—I have Wit enough to be above the little Envy of those talking things—besides I am Rich, have a Fortune, <HI>Argent Comptant</HI>, Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A Fortune!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>Clever</HI>, a Fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then I don't wonder at your being above what the World can say of you.—Positively no Body can be out of Humour that has Mony enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I think I have some kind of an Inclination to Mr. <HI>Friendly</HI>—the Man loves me to Folly;—I am pleas'd he should do so, and, in short, I intend he shall marry me within these Two Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, I wish you good Success—but the World, that has been so ill-natur'd to dispute one Hus∣band with you, may try to hinder you of another — therefore have a Care, and make sure of your Man while you can have him. — Between the Wars abroad, and the many pressing Occasions at home, Men are scarce.</P>

<P>Well, I vow, Mr. <HI>Pinch</HI>, you'll engage me ex∣treamly by this piece of Service,

<P>The Revolution?</P>

<P>Not but that mine was a meer Misfortune—The <HI>Irish</HI> Fright at that same Revolution put me into Fits, and frighted my poor Hair gray all o'the sudden.— Besides, <HI>Mariana</HI> here knows my Relations, we are all gray Ten Years sooner than other People. I come of a gray Family; don't I, my Dear? but then I wou'd n't have Mr. <HI>Friendly</HI> for many Reasons think me in Years, I know he designs having an Heir to his Family, and—</P>

Excessively loving; nay, they were but too well ac∣quainted, that's certain — I heard 'em call him by his Name—Are not you a dear Dog, says one of 'em; What, my little <HI>Jenny</HI>, quo' he; and immediately whipp'd one Arm about one, and t'other about t'other, and away they scuttled together so familiarly I warrant you.</P>

<P>A Frolick, my Dear? Ah the Devil take such Frolicks, I say. You don't know what a Concern I am in; he has put me off, with a Pretence of his catching Misfortunes (as he calls 'em) by these com∣mon Sluts, these Twenty times already; and if he should catch another Misfortune we cannot be marry'd 'till he's well again, and that will be a Month, or Three Weeks at least; besides, Surgeons are so unskilful, and such Knaves, and I am so fearful of those Matters my self.—Well Dear, my Dears, forgive me.</P>

<P>I must own, I have ill Nature enough to rejoice exceedingly at her Ladyships Vexation, she has been a standing Incumbrance upon poor <HI>Friendly</HI>'s Pleasures for these Two Years, she has watch'd him with as much Jea∣lousie and Perversness as a barren Wife.</P>

<P>To a Tittle; he's stark mad; Love and <HI>Pe∣king</HI>, that is, your Ladyship and the Emperor of <HI>Chi∣na</HI>, have turn'd his Brains—He has made a <HI>Chi∣nese</HI> Song upon you, and I left him singing it to an Oriental Kettle-Drum, as he calls it. Next to the great <HI>Cham</HI> and <HI>Mariana</HI>, I believe I have an Interest in him.</P>

<P>I suppose you have been promising largely in my Name what I am never to perform.</P>

<P>What is the Meaning of this? What does this Lady's Passion import?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh are you there, Sir? 'Tis exceeding well in∣deed! I am given to understand that you are faithless, Sir, that you are false, Sir, that you are making your Bo∣dy over, by a Marriage-Contract, to the Daughter of Sir <HI>Timothy Tallapoy</HI>, in order to defraud me, your lawful Creditor, of my natural Dues and Perquisites.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How, most exceeding fair Lady, are there Machinations against your most faithful humble Servant? Is your Relation Mr. <HI>Friendly?</HI>
<STAGE><HI>To</HI> Mariana.</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Since the Matter is out, 'tis most certainly so, my Relation is Mr. <HI>Friendly</HI>, or Mr. <HI>Friendly</HI> is my Rela∣tion, you may take it either way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir <HI>Tim.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But Madam!—</P>

<P>Ay marry does it, to thy Shame, thou Traitor!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Frie.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Look ye, for the matter of the Matrimony 'tis too true; but for the other part, I stand up for my Con∣stancy, and do aver I was never false in my Life; for my Trial I put my self upon my Country here present, and your Ladyship may go on with the Evidence as soon as you see fit.</P>

<P>Oh Wretch! do'st thou not expect the House shou'd fall down upon thee this Instant?</P>

<P>No, I trust in the Timber-work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh thou Wickedness incarnate! How often hast thou look'd upon me and smil'd, and then smil'd and look'd upon me again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Frie.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>Did n't you promise me to put me out of my Pain before to morrow; out of my Pain, I stick to that.</P>

</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Cl.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Madam, he's a most perfidious Wretch, that's certain; but since you see there is no good to be done with him, you had much better retire before you fall into a fresh Disorder; you'll only give him an occasi∣on of a malicious Grin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Clev.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Clerimont</HI> tells you true; these Rattle-headed young Fellows don't know how to value a discreet elder∣ly Passion.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sta.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, <HI>Clever</HI>, thou art certainly in the right, I'll leave him to his Flirt! Well, this is my Fifteenth Mis∣fortune of this kind since I have been a Widow— But I'll retire into the Country this Instant I'm resolv'd, and mind good Books, and making Sweetmeats and Salves, and never trust in a Man of Five and Twenty a∣gain.</P>
