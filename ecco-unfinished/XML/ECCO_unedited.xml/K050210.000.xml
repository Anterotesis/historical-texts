<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, nay good wife not so loud, or I vanish. Five and twenty years have I expos'd my organs of hearing (aye, and though I say it, without whining too) to the encounter of the toughest lungs in Westminster Hall, with no worse effect as yet, than a moderate deafness of the left ear; and a whizzing from time to time in the right, but that dear lovely, indefatigable tongue of thine, so far outdins <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he bar itself, that though a lawyer—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>A lawyer! why in that trim you look more like a client, than a lawyer, and no one, to see you in such a dress, wou'd imagine you had ever carried on a suit, in any one's name but your own. Out upon you, you are a disgrace to the profession, and had you a grain of spirit—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit! oh, there at least you wrong me, and I defy any practitioner of twice my standing to produce more instances of spirit, than I have; who exposes him∣self to the displeasure of the judges; or the censure of
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>
the courts. Shew me the man that sets the pedantic regulations of common practice more at defiance than I have done▪ hav'n't I been obliged to quit the London courts only for displaying too much spirit on a certain occasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine truly! and do you boast of your blunders, and make a merit of your disgrace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>This accident to be sure forces me to try my talents in the obscurity of rural practice; and yet since our removal to this village, though next door to Jus∣tice Mittimus, the best accustom'd Magistrate in the whole country, no favourable opportunity has offer'd; not a hare has been snar'd, or a head broke, or (what is stranger still) a single bastard born, though we have been here a whole fortnight, nay the very cattle keep out of pound, to spite me. But come have a little pa∣tience, times will mend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in the mean time, your wife is to starve, and your daughter, to lose the opportunity of settling herself in the world, by a match with one or other of the young men, who court her, and whom the pover∣ty of your appearance frighten away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to say the truth there is nothing in my dress that can bring either lovers to my daughter, or clients to myself. Mankind is govern'd by shew, and the surest way to obtain the countenance of the world is never to appear to want it. Cou'd I but once put on the appearance of business, the reality perhaps wou'd soon follow, let me see—cou'dn't I—yes I have it—I'll
<PB N="5" REF="5"/>
go, and purchase me a handsome suit of clothes im∣mediately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>A handsome suit of clothes! what, without a farthing in your pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?—in London all your handsome suits are purchas'd the same way.—What colour shall I chuse? bats▪wing—or—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no matter for the colour if you can find any one kind enough to trust you with the cloaths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to lose no time, I'll step over the way to the rich drapers, my neighbour Snarl's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs S.</SPEAKER>
<P>To neighbour Snarl's! have a care what you do there. You know his Son Charles is in love with our Harriet, and wou'd have married her before now, but for fear of his father; I wou'd not for the world you should do any thing to overthrow my daughter's hopes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear, step in and fetch my hat and gown. <STAGE><HI>Exit▪</HI> Mrs S.</STAGE></P>
<P>I have just time to slip it on; it will give me a more creditable appearance before old Snarl, and these rags of mine into the bargain.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter <HI>MRS SCOUT,</HI> with gown and hat.</STAGE>
<P>Aye, this will do.—How many sleek, spruce, demure looking gowns are there in the world, as well as this, good for nothing else, but covering things not fit to be seen. <STAGE>[Exeunt.</STAGE></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Son, I order'd you to enquire me out a Shepherd instead of that dog Sheepface; didn't I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why surely Father, you have no fault to find with Sheepface.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; only that he is a thief! an arrant thief!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>I always found Sheepface a very faithful ser∣vant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To <HI>you</HI> he may, but not to <HI>me;</HI> he has been but a month in my service, and there are fourteen of my wethers missing, now it is impossible so great a number in so short a time cou'd die of the rot, as he says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Char.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't consider what a havock a disorder sometimes makes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the help of a Doctor, I grant you, but my sheep ha! no Doctor, poor things! yet they cou'd not have made more haste if they had been prescrib'd for, by the whole faculty.—As for that dog, Sheepface, I have suspected him for sometime: but last night I caught him in the fact, and this morning I mean to bring him before Justice Mittimus; but first of all, I must know exactly, what's my loss. Reach me the ac∣count of the flock. <STAGE>(sits down)</STAGE> And if neighbour Gripe, the constable enquires for me; send him this way.</P>

<P>Save your good worship, Sweet Master Snarl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How villain, have you the impudence to ap∣pear in my sight, after the tricks you have play'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only to tell your sweet worship, that neigh∣bour Gripe has been talking to me about sheep-steal∣ing, and Justice Mittimus, and your worship, and a power of things, and so I said I wou'dn't make a se∣cret of it to my good master's worship any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your affected innocence, sha'n't save you, you rascal; didn't I catch you last night killing one of the fattest of my wethers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only to keep it from dying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kill it, to keep it from dying!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of the rot, an' please your worship. Its a secret I learnt from the doctor in our town. He cur'd most of his patients the same way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The doctor, rascal! the doctor has a license to kill from the college.—Such sheep as mine too—there was not in all England, such another breed for Spanish wool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be satisfied your worship with the blows you gave me, and let's make up matters, if its your wor∣ship's sweet will and pleasure.</P>

<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>My will and pleasure is to hang you, rascal, to hang you.</P>

<P>Consider your worship, I was married but yesterday, leave me to myself a week or two, and who knows but I may save you the trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, rascal, the gallows is the quickest reme∣dy of the two, and every bit as sure as t'other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven give you good luck of it then, if it must be so, sweet Master Snarl, I must go look for a lawyer, I see, or <HI>might</HI> will overcome <HI>right.</HI> Oh dear, that an honest man should be treated so, only for kil∣ling a few sheep to save 'em from dying. <STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE></P>

<P>I am lawyer Scout your neighbour—I am come to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am lawyer Scout, my neighbour's very humble servant; but he and I have no business toge∣ther, that I know of,—"Carried over"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll have another story to tell to-morrow, or I'm much mistaken <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>—I find Sir, upon look∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="9"/>
over my late father's papers, an account of a debt left unpaid, and I am come—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Its no business of mine; I owe no man a far∣thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I cou'd say as much for myself; but I find that <HI>my</HI> father was indebted to <HI>yours</HI> in a small balance of 50 pounds, and as a man of honor I am come home to pay it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(rising)</STAGE> My dear Sir, ten thousand pardons, for my forgetfulness. I recollect you perfectly now. Yes, you liv'd in the next village, and you and I were sworn comrades formerly. Pray Sir, be seated. <STAGE>(hands a chair.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sir, if those who are indebted to me, had a little of my punctuality, I should be a richer man than I am, but to have my name in any one's book is a thing I can't bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet the generality of people bear it very patiently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am upon thorns in a manner, while I owe one a farthing, and for that reason I am come to know when you'll be at leisure to receive the money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No time like the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, I have it at home, ready told; but as I have the management of my father's effects, only as guardian for my daughter Harriet, its proper that the other guardians shou'd be by at the payment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true Sir, then what do you think of to∣morrow at three o'clock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, but I have interrupted you perhaps. <STAGE>(rises)</STAGE> Why Sir, you do more business than all the shopkeepers in this part of the country put together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't complain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, you have such a way with you, that those who buy once, can't for the blood of them, help co∣ming to you again. A pretty bit of cloth this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>One meets in your shop, such a generosity of treatment, a politeness of behaviour, that makes it pleasanter to <HI>pay</HI> money to you than to receive it else∣where. The wool seems tolerably fine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right Spanish wool every hair of it, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I thought; now we talk of Spanish wool, if I am not mistaken, Mr Snarl, you and I went to school together formerly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, to old Ironfist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same; you were a very handsome youth I remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>So my mother always said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Egad, for old acquaintance sake, you and I must eat a bit of dinner together to-day. I have a fine goose at home, that a client sent me from Norfolk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>A goose! that's my favourite dish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>And my wife shall dress it by a family receipt. Its a treasure, that receipt's a perfect treasure. Her uncle, the late Alderman Dumpling, pass'd through
<PB N="11" REF="11"/>
the whole circle of corporation honours, and died Mayor by virtue of that receipt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! Aye!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then Mrs Scout will be happy to see you; now I think on't, I promis'd her, that you should have my custom for the future, and to make a beginning I don't care if I have the pattern of a suit of cloaths from you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very happy to accommodate you Sir; what colour wou'd you choose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Colour! why here's a pretty one enough to my mind Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very pretty indeed Sir; its an iron grey. Shall I cut off the quantity you want, to have it ready?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>To have it ready; no Mr. Snarl, pay as you go, that's my rule; pay as you go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ecod, an excellent rule it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you remember Mr Snarl, the evening we were together at the goose and gridiron?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What the evening I so roasted our curate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same; you were very severe on him. You had a world of wit.—Pray what must I pay you a yard for this cloth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir, another shou'd pay me nineteen and sixpence; but come, you shall have it at nineteen shillings.—Now I think of it. Here's your quantity ready cut.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ready cut—that's lucky indeed. <STAGE>(snatches up the cloth.)</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the price.—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poo, I never haggle with a friend; I leave all that to you. Good day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let my shopman carry it over, and bring back—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, don't take him from business. It is but a step you know, and I'd carry it twice as far to oblige you. Compliments to Mrs Snarl;—good-bye to you, good-bye. <STAGE>[Exit, <HI>Snarl</HI> follows.</STAGE></P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it, he stood my friend once when bro∣ther and I were put to trouble;—wou'd you believe it only for mending the complexion of a bald fac'd horse—but I have such a treacherous memory, I don't know how it came about, but some how or other I forgot to pay him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kate.</SPEAKER>
<P>He'll not think of that perhaps: at any rate take care not to tell him, who the plaintiff is; for I know he wou'd not on any account be concern'd against Mr Snarl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll only tell him of my master, without men∣tioning any name; and he'll think I mean the Farmer I liv'd with, when I courted you first.</P>

<P>Yes, your worship, yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the same token, one of you forgot to pay me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that was brother.</P>

<SP>

<P>The other was sick at the trial, and died some∣time after in prison.</P>

<P>So I see.</P>

<P>For all that I was sicker, nor brother! and so as I was saying, I am come to beg of your worship to speak for me before the Justice against his worship my master.</P>

<P>What the great farmer in the neghbourhood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>He lives in the neighbourhood sure enough, and your worship shall be paid to your heart's content.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me hear your case, and be sure you tell it without disguise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know then, an' please your wor∣ship, my master gives me but little wages, very small wages, indeed, and so to take amends for that, with∣out doing him any damage, I thought as how I'd best do a little business on my account with a worthy neigh∣bour, a butcher by trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what kind of business do you carry on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under favour. I hinder sheep from dying of the rot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no harm in that; how do you con∣trive—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Please your worship, I cut their throats, be∣fore they have time to catch it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very effectual remedy truly, and your mas∣ter perhaps is unreasonable enough to say you do so only to sell the carcases, and keep the money to your∣self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, your worship, and I can't bear it out of his head, because last night he saw me—I mean—I—must I tell the truth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, tell the truth here, or how shall we be able to lie to any purpose elsewhere.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth of the matter then is, that last night, after I was married, having a little leisure time upon my hands, I took a walk as far as our pens, and there as I was musing on I don't know what;—out I takes my knife, and so happening by mere accident to put it (craving your worship's pardon) under the throat of a fat wether, I don't know how it came about, but it was not long there, before the wether died all of a sud∣den as a body may say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>And there was some body looking on, the whole time, eh!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, master from behind the hedge, and so he will have it that 14 wethers, which I sav'd from catch∣ing the rot, died all along of me. And so as your wor∣ship
<PB N="15" REF="15"/>
may see, he laid such a shower of blows upon me as put the bride out of temper the whole night; but I hope your worship will stand my friend, and not let me lose the fruits of my honest industry all at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you; there are two ways of pro∣ceeding in this affair; the first won't put you to a far∣thing of expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheep.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lets try that by all means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let me come at him; I have paid for the kil∣ling, and it is but fair, I shou'd have the worth of my money, so if I am not allow'd to choak him I retract the consent I gave.</P>

by the means of conquering all such tempta∣tions henceforward.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hem!—well, it must be so then, I think; and to prevent any future abuse, I'll sell off all my sheep, and then they'll neither die of the rot, nor shall I need a shepherd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well so far I have succeeded fully▪ both for myself and client; but a cause in which we are all in∣terested remains yet to be determin'd; which we must learn from the decision of this tribunal. Whether the <HI>Village Lawyer</HI> is to be struck off the <HI>roll,</HI> or not.</P>
