<L>O might a transient spark of Genius fire</L>

Vain wish! they ask not the imperfect Lay,</L>
<L>The weak Applause her trembling accents breathe;</L>
<L>With whose pure Radiance Glory blends her ray,</L>
<L>Whom Fame has circled with her fairest wreathe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, who while seen with graceful step to tread</L>
<L>Grandeur's enchanted round, can'st meekly pause</L>
<L>To rend the Veil Obscurity had spread</L>
<L>Where his lone sigh deserted Genius draws;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To lead his drooping Spirit to thy Fane,</L>
<L>Where attic joy the social Circle warms;</L>
<L>Where Science loves to pour her hallow'd strain,</L>
<L>Where Wit, and Wisdom, blend their sep'rate charms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sure to cherish intellectual Powers,</L>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent the Readers of the following Work from
entertaining expectations respecting it which it would ill
satisfy, it is necessary to acquaint them that the Author hath
not had the presumption even to attempt a full, historical
narration of the fall of the Peruvian Empire. To describe
that important event with precision, and to display with just
force the various causes which combined to produce it, would
require all the energy of genius, all the strong colouring
of the most glowing imagination. Conscious of her utter
inability to execute such a design, she hath only aimed at
giving a simple detail of a few incidents in that affecting
and romantic History; where the unparalleled sufferings of
an innocent and amiable People afford the finest subjects for
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>
true pathos, while their climate, intirely dissimilar to our
own, furnishes new and ample materials for poetic de∣scription.</P>
<P>She offers this Poem to the Public impressed with gratitude
for the indulgence with which it hath honoured her former,
unowned Production, <HI>EDWIN</HI> and <HI>ELTRUDA;</HI> yet trembling
lest, in the temerity of a farther effort to engage its attention,
and obtain its favour, she should forfeit, by the feebleness of
a Performance inadequate to fulfil that anxious hope, all
claim to future encouragement.</P>

<L>When Death dissolves the ties for ever dear,</L>
<L>When frantic Passion pours her parting tear;<MILESTONE N="120"/></L>
<L>With all the cherish'd pains Affection feels,</L>
<L>Hangs on the quiv'ring lip that silence seals,</L>
<L>Views fondness struggling in the closing eye,</L>
