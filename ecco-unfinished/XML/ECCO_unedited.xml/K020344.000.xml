<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT's pity our <HI>English</HI> Pulpits were not fill'd up with <HI>Dr. Kennet</HI>'s, I mean, Sir, such as are of your heal∣ing Temper, Men of moderate Principles, that have a Sense of the Wounds the <HI>Protestant Interest</HI> has re∣ceived, from the Divisions of her Members: Heats and Animosities are destructive to any Community; but in the Church Fatal; for it destroys the very Nerves and Sinews of <HI>Religion;</HI> and when the Life and Power is once gone, there remains only a Name: It must needs be a me∣lancholy Thought to a serious <HI>Christian,</HI> That the <HI>Church</HI> (of which he is a Member, and it may be a <HI>Pastor)</HI> has but only a Lifeless Name; seem to be Alive, and yet Dead.</P>
<P>Though there is none (now adays) can positively deter∣mine in this Matter; yet we may safely conclude, That those that do all they can to rend and tear, to wound and destroy the Spouse of Christ, are Strangers to the <HI>Power of Godliness.</HI> There are many among us, that are con∣tented to eat their own Bread, and wear their own Appa∣rel, if they shall but hang upon, and hide themselves un∣der the Skirts of our <HI>Establish'd Church,</HI> that their Re∣proach (of being of no Church at all) may be taken away.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The Churh in the <HI>Wilderness</HI> had a mixt Multitude among them, who had the Relicks of an <HI>Idolatrous Wor∣ship,</HI> and had (doubtless) a great Hand in the Invention of the <HI>Golden-Calf,</HI> and the many and often Rebellions of that Church; for which, the Judgments of God did follow them so close, till he had utterly destroyed them from the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>No doubt, but our <HI>English Israel</HI> has cause to complain of such a mixt Multitude, that to this Day, are not fully drain'd from the Remains of <HI>Popery;</HI> I wish our fatal End may not be to Drink of the same <HI>Cup</HI> as they did; for suffering them to hang upon the Skirts of their <HI>Pretended Mother,</HI> while they take the readiest Course, to undermine her Foundation, by wrangling Contentions and Jars, by Sow∣ing the Seeds of Sedition, which is the proper Work of the <HI>Destroyer.</HI> And also the Author of these <HI>Remarks</HI> has the Confidence to say, That <HI>Church-men</HI> Condemn you, <HI>Dissenters</HI> Despise you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet you may be Confident of just the Contrary; and that God Himself has pronounc'd you Blessed, because a <HI>Peace-maker.</HI> I am not so vain, as to think, That this Defence can any ways corroborate your well-composed <HI>Sermon;</HI> but that the World may see, that Men of moderate Principles are not quite Extinguish'd: Go on, Sir, and <HI>follow Peace with all Men,</HI> and the God of Peace will give you a full Reward. I am,</P>

<HEAD><HI>Moderation Maintain'd,</HI> &amp;C.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS Unaccountable, and truly La∣mentable, That we the Inhabi∣tants of this <HI>Fair Island</HI> (the Prime of the Universe all things consider'd) should yet be so fatally Unfortunate, as to undervalue the Blessings that Heaven has plentifully bestowed upon us; We who live in a delicate Climate, and in a Land that affords us all kind of Varieties as Nature can wish for: Who are Regulated by the best Constituted Government in the habitable World; and have a Queen who is fitly adap∣ted, both by Her Inclination and Promise, to Govern us, according to our Constitution; and above all, who are blessed (in a pecu∣liar and distinguishing way and manner) with the Gospel of Peace, <HI>which is able to make us Wise unto Salvation,</HI> should yet be so averse to our own Good, as to despise all these Priviledges, and be ungrateful to the Almighty Himself, the Father and Giver of them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="5"/>
Therefore, all those that are the true Friends of our happy Constitution, cannot but necessarily concur with me in this un∣doubted Assertion, <HI>viz. That there is nothing can be more effectual towards the destroying of our Constitution, than the Heats and Animo∣sities which are fomented amongst us, by a cor∣rupt Party of Men, who make it their Work and Business, to asperse and calumniate Men of all Ranks and Degrees, not excepting the Ministerial-Function.</HI> If they do but en∣deavour to compose our Differences by Words of Moderation, or shew any Incli∣nation to Peace (which our Gospel teaches us) then the most bitter Invectives, and the most biting Sarcasms, must be the Pro∣duct of Virulent Pens. One should think the Character of some Men, (especially those that are appointed to be our <HI>Teachers)</HI> should be a sufficient Preservative from the Indignities of the worst of Men.</P>
<P>Of this pernicious Temper is that scan∣dalous Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>Remarks on a</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
<HI>Sermon,</HI> &amp;c. The Author of which has, with the utmost Malice, endeavour'd to ex∣pose and misrepresent the Reverend Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> altho' known to be a Man of Learn∣ing and singular Piety; as also in a Sphere beyond the Reach of Calumny and Disdain, which may be one Reason why he takes no Notice of such an Inconsiderate Scribler; who, by his own Confession, has not soberly and judiciously perus'd his late Sermon, but in a heat of Passion and furious Choler, has wrested his Words quite contrary to his Intention; which Fatal Error, and want of Judgment, has been a means to oblige me to offer this Vindication of that Sermon to the World.</P>
<P>The First thing that is worthy of No∣tice in his Remarks is, the Disgust that he takes at the Doctor's <HI>Title,</HI> as well as the <HI>Subject</HI> of his Sermon, endeavouring to In∣sinuate to the World, <HI>That</HI> Civil War <HI>is a Word that palliates the Crime, rather than any ways agreeable to the Solemnities of the day:</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
How this can be an Affront to any I cannot imagine; For, as yet, I never heard that <HI>Word</HI> Objected against, even by the great∣est Sticklers, on that Prince's behalf; and I dare say, the Doctor did not think, nor in the least suspect, that any could Object a∣gainst it; For in my mind, it is every whit as proper as that which the Author recom∣mends to us, <HI>viz. Rebellion:</HI> And suppose I should call it <HI>Rebellion</HI> (as the Doctor does in several places) I am sure no Body can deny, but that it was a <HI>Civil VVar,</HI> and ought properly to be so called, when Two contending Parties in the same Nation rise up in Arms, and endeavour the one to con∣quer and destroy the other: Is not this a <HI>Civil VVar?</HI> But however, the Doctor does not stick to call it <HI>down-right Rebellion,</HI> and that Party that bore Arms against their Soveraign, <HI>Rebels:</HI> But all will not please; yea, all along he extols the Name of that Excellent Prince to the highest Pinacle of Fame; and knows no other Epithet for
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
the other Party, but <HI>Rebellious Subjects;</HI> so that all he says about this, is nothing but Quibble; and it looks to me, as if he were afraid our Differences would be too soon Healed; and he seems mightily at a Loss, when he makes so much to do about an <HI>In∣significant Name;</HI> and indeed, all the rest is much the same; and how could it well be otherwise, whilst he only took a transient View of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> which is a very unjust way of Proceedure; so that by this we may (at least) guess, That he was resolv'd to Condemn it, before he had Read it; but if he had deliberately consider'd and weigh'd one part with another, he might easily have seen the Doctor's Design, which was (if possible) to stench our bleeding Wounds, to heal our Breaches, and allay our Heats and Divisions, which so much weaken the Fundamentals of our Constitution.</P>
<P>And I am persuaded, if all the Ministers that are accustom'd to preach on this Day, had taken the same Course, our Animosities
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
and Heart-burnings had been (in a great measure) very much allay'd, if not quite vanish'd e're this; which would have been the only means to promote that Peace and Union amongst us, to which Her Majesty does so affectionately invite us.</P>
<P>But, to proceed more closely to a Vindi∣cation of the Doctor's General Assertions; the First of which is, <HI>That a</HI> French <HI>Interest and Alliance was one of the leading Causes of that Day's Evil:</HI> Such a Truth that (till now) I thought no Body could deny; nei∣ther do I think that any one can read the Histories of those Times, and not readily acknowledge it: But that we may come to a right Understanding of the Matter, I think it necessary to retrospect into the lat∣ter end of the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> I. and see what was transacted in his Reign, in Relation to this Marriage; and it appears, that there were then divers Laws against the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> so called, and though they were absolutely necessary for the safety
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
of his Person, and the Peace and Prosperity of his Kingdom; therefore it is the more strange, that he himself should go about to break them, by that Marriage, notwith∣standing all the Remonstrances of his Par∣liament and Council, and the great Regret of his People, who yet had a fresh Sense of the Calamities their Ancestors had suffer'd, under the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> being resolv'd to have the Daughter of a King for his Son, and after the <HI>Spanish</HI> King had for a long time trifled with him, he at last fatally turns his Eye to <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> a Daughter of <HI>France,</HI> (tho' the States General did recommend a <HI>Protestant</HI> Lady at the same time) yet, as I said before, having settled his Looks on <HI>France,</HI> King <HI>Lewis,</HI> or rather Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who manag'd his Affairs, and the Pope, took all the Precaution that was pos∣sible, about an Affair that was of so great Consequence, to promote the <HI>Romish</HI> Reli∣gion; hoping, as indeed it prov'd, that when
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
once this Marriage was Consummated, the <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> that the Queen was to bring over with her, would propagate the <HI>Romish</HI> Faith in this Nation; and that the Descen∣dants from that Marriage, who were to be Educated by Madam their Mother till they came to the full Age of Thirteen, should in time sit upon the <HI>English</HI> Throne; which we <HI>Protestants</HI> felt to our Sorrow, in the Reign of the late King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>And in a short time, when this Unhappy Marriage was Compleated, the <HI>Ecclesiasticks</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> that belong'd to the Queen, did create a great deal of Trouble to the Inha∣bitants of this Land, by their perpetual Motion, continually running from House to House under the pretence of <HI>Conversion-work;</HI> openly boasting, that they had Con∣verted many Thousands in the little time they had been here; of which the King re∣ceived divers Complaints, as well from <HI>Protestant</HI> Bishops and Ministers, as from Masters of Families: But upon all Matters
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
that happen'd on that Subject, the Queen stept into the Breach, to prevent any Mis∣chief that was likely to fall on them.</P>
<P>But the King being continually pressed with these Clamours, resolv'd to send back those <HI>Frenchmen</HI> whom the Q. had brought along with her, which was accordingly put in Execution. The King of <HI>France</HI> (being pusht on by the <HI>Queen</HI> Mother) took this in such great Disdain, that he sent an Ambas∣sador Extraordinary to the <HI>Queen,</HI> and to make his Complaints to the King, which that Minister did so effectually, that all the <HI>French</HI> return'd to their former Posts about the <HI>Queen,</HI> and began their old Trade, of perverting the People of <HI>England,</HI> to the <HI>Romish</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>These Things, with other Calamities which accidentally happen'd at that Time, was the Cause that the Commons in Parlia∣ment assembled, presented a large Remon∣strance to the King (as may be seen at large in <HI>Ruthw. Collect.</HI> Vol. I. Fol. 619,) where∣in
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
they told his Majesty, <HI>Of the general Fear that was in his People; of the secret Working and Combination to introduce an Innovation, and change of their Holy Religion; and that their Fears and Jealousies were not meerly Conjectural, but arising out of such certain and visible Effects, as might demonstrate a true and real Cause; and that notwithstanding the good and wholsome Laws, made to prevent the In∣crease and Growth of</HI> Popery, <HI>yet that they were not put in Execution.</HI></P>
<P>Here they complain, <HI>That Letters of Stay of Legal Proceedings against them, had been procured from his Majesty; and Commissions under the Great Seal granted and executed, for Composition to be made with</HI> Popish <HI>Recusants; which they conceiv'd did amount to no less than a Toleration odious to GOD, full of Dishonour, and extream Disprofit to his Majesty; of ex∣tream Scandal and Gries to all his People, and of apparent Danger to the Present State of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
And further, <HI>They let his Majesty know, that another Ground of their Fears was the miserable Condition of</HI> Ireland, <HI>where without Controul, the</HI> Popish <HI>Religion was openly Pro∣fess'd and Practic'd, in divers Parts thereof;</HI> Popish <HI>Jurisdiction being there generally exer∣cised and avow'd; Monasteries, Nunneries, and other Superstitious Houses, Erected, Re∣edified and Replenish'd, with Men and Wo∣men of several Orders; which of what ill Con∣sequence it might prove, if not seasonably Re∣press'd, they left to his</HI> Majesty <HI>to judge.</HI></P>
<P>All which was sufficient to create Fears and Jealousies of <HI>Popery:</HI> Is it possible, that what is abovesaid should not create such an Effect upon <HI>Protestants?</HI> That <HI>Romish Priests</HI> (under the Shelter of that <HI>Queen)</HI> should go from House to House, to pervert the Peo∣ple, and carry their Children beyond Sea, to be Educated in the <HI>Popish</HI> Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Reign of that Sanguinary Woman <HI>Queen</HI> Mary, was not so far distant, but that the Fire and Faggot of her Day did
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
create in them a more than ordinary Ab∣horrence of <HI>Popery,</HI> upon which their Fears may justly be Grounded; and methinks this should allay the Heat of some Men's Passions against them.</P>
<P>To be fearless of <HI>Popery</HI> when there were such Causes, as visibly appear'd now, would have argu'd a great deal of Luke-warmness and Indifferency, towards that Holy Reli∣gion which they profess'd; and indeed, I had a better Opinion of the Nobles of this Land, for their Affection to the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, since they sent for the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> when they had any Fear of the change of it.</P>
<P>And let me tell you, it had been well if nothing had been transacted at that time, as the Doctor truly observes, either by Ton∣nage or Poundage, by Loans or Benevolen∣ces, or any thing else, but what should be done by their own Consent in a Parliamen∣tary way: The Laws of the Land are the People's Bulwarks; if they are once Invaded,
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
it's impossible, but that a free People should have Fears and Jealousies; and though the Judges declared it Legal yet that was not sufficient to allay the just Fears and Jealou∣sies of a free People.</P>
<P>Neither did it in the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign; and there was further Cause of Fears, as may be seen in the same Remon∣strance, in these Words: <HI>The Report of the strange and dangerous Purpose, of bringing in</HI> German <HI>Horse and Riders, would have turn'd our Doubts into Despair, had not your Majesty's Message comforted us, with the As∣surance of your Royal Word, that they were not intended for any Service in</HI> England, <HI>but for some other foreign Imployment; yet the sight of the Privy-Seal, by which they were to be Le∣vied, the great Sums of Money, which we found upon Examination to be paid for that Purpose, gave us just cause of Fear, that much about the same time, there was a Commission; under the Great Seal, granted unto the Lords, and others of the Privy-Council, to consider of other ways</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
<HI>for raising of Money; so particularly by Im∣positions, gave us just cause to suspect, that what∣soever was your Majesty's Gracious Intention, yet there wanted not those, that under some Co∣lourable Pretence, might secretly by this, as by other ways, contrive to change the Frame, both of Religion and Government. These Men could not be Ignorant, that the bringing in Stran∣gers for Aid, have been Pernicious to most States, but to</HI> England <HI>Fatal. And we be∣seech your</HI> Majesty, <HI>to pardon the Vehemency of our Expression, if in the Loyal and Zealous Affections we bear to your</HI> Majesty, <HI>and your Service, We are bold to declare to your</HI> Ma∣jesty, <HI>and to the whole World, That we hold it far beneath the Heart of any free</HI> Englishman, <HI>to think, that this</HI> Victorious Nation <HI>should now stand in need,</HI> of German Soldiers, <HI>to de∣fend their now King and Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>I have transcibed so much of that large Remonstrance of the Commons assembled in Parliament, to King <HI>Charles</HI> I. but three Years after that Marriage, only that
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
we may see what Fears the People had, and judge of the Causes as we please.</P>
<P>The great Distresses, and heavy Calami∣ties that came upon this good King, pro∣ceeded from that Fatal Match, and the en∣deared Affections he had to his Queen, was doubtless one Reason that hindred effectual Measures to be taken, for the Relief of the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Rochel:</HI> It is he was Guaran∣tee for the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> therefore he was under a special Obligation to relieve them; and it seems not that it was his Fault that they were not Relieved, but rather the Ministers that he Employ'd; for the sent Fleet after Fleet to their Relief, but they all return'd <HI>re Infecta,</HI> not so much as once attempting or endeavouring to give them Relief who were ready to perish for Hunger.</P>
<P>Therefore, I say, considering that the Queen was in the <HI>French</HI> Interest, notwith∣standing her abode here; and while it was so, how could it be expected, but she would do all she could to retard Succours to the
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
<HI>Protestants</HI> that had taken up Arms there, for their Rights, Liberties and Religion; That was the Reason that the Fleets were so slow in preparing, and that nothing was done when sent.</P>
<P>At last, when the terrible News was come from the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> to their Deputies at the <HI>English</HI> Court, that they were fain to feed upon Dogs, Cats, Rats, Tanned-hides, Parchments, Old-Shoes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it forced them to make an open and pressing Remonstrance to the King and his Council, wherein (after they had used the most Pathetick and Melt∣ing Expressions to hasten their Relief, and that his Majesty would discern who serv'd him faithfully, and who not) may be found these Words:</P>
<P><HI>By the Glory of Your Scepter, under the Sanctuary of which we are come to put Our∣selves, and which it hath pleased You to tender Us for Our Security, by the magnificent Title of</HI> Defender of the Faith, <HI>which obliges You to Relieve those that are Distressed for that</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
<HI>very Reason: In short, by the Faith and Word of a King, which it hath pleased You to engage for us, Permit not, Sir, our Innocent Blood to Reflect upon Your Crown, to stain it to Ages that shall succed us, and at present to cry against Your</HI> Majesty, <HI>before GOD and Man.</HI></P>
<P>But notwithstanding this Remonstrance, and the third Fleet being issued out to their Relief; yet there was nothing done to en∣deavour to break the Digue, and get Pro∣visions into the City; but at last the Town was deliver'd up, and that in sight of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, to the great Dishonour of the Nation: By this we may gather (as the Doctor truly said) That on this side the Water the <HI>French</HI> Services betray'd him, and on the other side, the <HI>French</HI> Policies were at work to destroy him; and both brought in by that Fatal Marriage.</P>
<P>That a more than ordinary Looseness and Prophaneness did over-shadow this Land at that time (especially upon the Christian-Sabbath) is evident; and if Pro∣phaneness
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
and Loosness in Morals, then Hypocrisy, and all other Evils, must neces∣sarily follow: It is not want of Charity to say (as the Doctor truly observes) That the Principles of <HI>Popery</HI> are adapted to a Loos∣ness in Morals; and that the Members of that Church are strict in nothing, but little outward Observations. And no question, but it was under the Covert of <HI>Popery,</HI> that a Declaration concerning lawful Sports, to be used on <HI>Sundays,</HI> was Published by Arch∣bishop <HI>Laud</HI>'s means, who, to Justify him∣self, procured a Warrant, without any Date at all, to be Signed by his Majesty; and this also was both a Cause and Scandal of that Evil Day which follow'd; and what ill Effects it had upon the Minds of the People, was then too Notorious.</P>
<P>Plays and Play-houses, especially the horrid Prophaneness that was used in them, was a sad Omen of the Calamites which follow'd soon after.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22"/>
I mention this of purpose, that I might have an Opportunity to write against the Plays and Play-houses of our Day; and I wish that some dreadful Judgment from the Almighty is not ready to pour down upon us, for suffering our Holy Religion to be Scandaliz'd and Redicul'd, and the Holy Name of GOD to be abominably Blas∣phem'd.</P>
<P>And upon this Account, we have cause to bless GOD, for what Her Majesty has done, in order to Regulate them; and I heartily pray to GOD, that He would in∣spire Her Majesty's Heart so as utterly to depress them, that the very Name and Remembrance of them may be Buried in Eternal Oblivion. I am glad that I have an Opportunity to Embark my Pen in this Affair, but sorry that there is so great an Occasion for it; and wish all honest Men that appear in Print, would have a fling at them; seeng the Prince of Darkness him∣self (with all the Wits of his dark <HI>Den)</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
cannot find out a more ready way to pro∣mote his Kingdom than is used in the Play∣houses; for there Religion it self is scoffed at, and the Ambassadors of it tantaliz'd; and the Name of GOD Prophan'd; and His amazing Providences, by which He can over-turn the Rocks and Mountains, and of a sudden make our Houses (which are for Shelter) to be our Graves, turn'd into Redicule and Sport: There the Devil's Kingdom is promoted in the highest De∣gree, by many Oaths and Curses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are used, to instill the pernicious Seeds of Debauchery into the Minds of Men: And we must expect, as long as these Nurseries of Sin are tolerated, that GOD will still contend with us, and that by more astonishing Providences, than yet we have either seen or felt.</P>
<P>I shall conclude, with a Word of Advice to the Disturbers of our Publick Peace: Time was, when the Dissenters were the only Men that the Church was afraid of;
<PB N="21" REF="24" MS="y"/>
but since the <HI>Revolution</HI> in Eighty Eight, there is another Generation risen amongst us that is more dangerous than the Dissen∣ters ever were, because they pretend to be the most Legitimate Sons of the Church; when in the mean time, they are her great∣est Enemies: These are they that are against the Settlement of the Crown in the <HI>Protestant Line:</HI> That are for the Church, no farther than they can advance the Inte∣rest of their Beloved Prince at St. <HI>Germains:</HI> These are they that cast Bones of Conten∣tion among us, if possible, to divide us, that they might the sooner attain their end.</P>
<P>But let me tell you, Gentlemen, and you may take it for an assured Truth, He whom you expect will never come to inherit the Imperial Crown of <HI>England:</HI> No, no, The People of <HI>England</HI> (for the most part) are so in Love with <HI>Protestanism,</HI> with their Lives Liberties and Estates, and have such an ill Opinion of <HI>Popery, Arbitrary-Power,</HI> and <HI>Wooden Shoes;</HI> of the now exploded
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
Doctrines of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> and <HI>Passive-Obedience,</HI> that they are resolved to main∣tain the <HI>Protestant Line,</HI> whatever it cost them.</P>
<P>Therefore, I advise you not to disturb our Tranquility; submit yourselves to the <HI>Government,</HI> and don't let your Minds han∣ker any longer after the Court at St. <HI>Ger∣mains;</HI> for I tell you agen, all your Hopes will be Frustrated: And if you will conti∣nue to undermine our Constitution, Know then, that you will work your own Ruin, for the <HI>Government</HI> will be supported under our Gracious Queen <HI>ANNE:</HI> But as for you, you will only be matter of Scoff and Scorn to all succeeding Generations, and your Houses will be made desolate for ever.</P>
<P>The <HI>Revolution</HI> in Eighty-Eight was the immediate Effect of the over-ruling Hand of GOD; his all-powerful Arm was most visibly seen in that Transaction, above and beyond the Expectation of the Wisest of
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
Men, neither do I think, that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> himself did suppose it would fall as it did; No, It was GOD's immediate Hand, therefore it will stand, and the Gates of Hell shall never be able to over-turn it.</P>
<P>You, who refus'd to swear to him, have had Peace and Quietness during his Reign, and none of you all suffer'd in your Liber∣ties and Properties, but those that were im∣mediately concern'd in Plotting against the Life of that Excellent Prince; yea, notwith∣standing you brought that Distinction of a King, <HI>de facto,</HI> and <HI>de jure</HI> upon our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Stage, yet he bore it patiently, and like a wise and discreet Prince, kept us in Peace during his Reign.</P>
<P>Now, suppose such a Distinction had been raised in the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> II. and I'll assure you, there was more Cause, would he have born it? You do not sup∣pose it; No, he would have made you felt the weight of his angry Arm.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="27"/>
<HI>But King</HI> William <HI>took another Method; he chose rather to govern his People with the pleasing Scepter of</HI> Peace <HI>and</HI> Love; <HI>so that the harsh Note of,</HI> This is my Pleasure, <HI>and</HI> I will be Obey'd, <HI>was never heard during his Reign; and so it continues, under the benign Reign of our</HI> Protestant <HI>Queen: What then, Gentlemen, would you have? Must the whole Nation agree to dissolve the Government for you? Nay, must Providence it self turn out of its Course for you? You must not suppose it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It was credibly Reported, That you kept private Meetings in the late Reign, wherein you used a</HI> Liturgy <HI>different from the Esta∣blish'd Liturgy of the Church: You that are in your Consciences for a Liturgy, and yet not to use that which the Church has thought fit to Establish; there is none but will Condemn you; and indeed, your separate Meetings from the Church may properly be called</HI> Conventi∣cles, <HI>from</HI> Convenire in Malum, <HI>for the ma∣ny Plots and Conspiracies against good King</HI> William, <HI>was the Consequent of those Meetings,</HI>

and I wish that no such private Cabals are now kept up, against the Soveraignty of our good Protestant Queen.</P>
<P>'Tis, indeed, a very melancholy and pensive Thought, That when any Body appears from Pulpit or Press, in favour of Mode∣ration, and thereby endeavour to restore Peace to our Languish∣ing Island, he is presently stigmatiz'd (and that by you Gentle∣men) for a Man of <HI>Whiggish</HI> Principles, and a Favourer of <HI>Dis∣senters;</HI> as if all Christian Vertues were fled from the <HI>Church</HI> to the <HI>Dissenters.</HI> I wonder you are not asham'd to scandalize that <HI>Church</HI> which you pretend to be your Mother. The Apo∣stle says, That Meekness, Temperance, Love, Long-suffering, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are the Fruits of the Spirit; then (if what you say is true) all the choice Gifts of the Spirit, are departed from the Church, and gone to the Dissenters: This is such a Disparagement to our Establish'd Church, that it is almost insufferable.</P>
<P>And, I pray, why so angry with the Dissenters? You say, Because they Detruncated a good and pious King; we all confess they did so; but must your Anger and Malice continue for ever? That Generation is almost extinct, and can you set no Bounds to your Malice, but must continue it to their Posterity, from Ge∣neration to Generation.</P>
<P>One should think they had (at least in part) atton'd for that, in the late Revolution, when our Establish'd Church was come almost to its Period; even then did the Dissenters do whatever the Church could wish for its Support; and I do not question, but the true Sons of the Church have (and will have) a grateful Sense thereof. The Church has had now full Fifteen Years Tryal of the Dissenters, and what can they lay to their Charge, in all this time? None can say, but they have behaved themselves quietly and peaceably in their respective Callings; not so much as lifting up a Finger against the Government, either in Church or State, and continue so to to do; and so long as they have their Liberty of serving GOD according to their Consciences, I dare say, they will never do the least thing, that may tend to de∣stroy the <HI>Act of Settlement;</HI> nay, they rejoyce in it, and I am per∣suaded, they will part with all that is dear to them, before they will part with the Protestant Line.</P>
<P>And why, I pray, so angry with the moderate Churchmen? You say, because they turn'd out a King of our own, and brought in a <HI>Foreigner,</HI> because it is they that forced our Beloved King to
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
Abdicate his Throne; our King, who was riding Post to <HI>Rome,</HI> and whom we advanc'd to an Arbitrary Power, by the false and dangerous Steps of Non-Resistance and Passive-Obedience: It is confess'd, they did all this, and I believe they are not asham'd to own it; and it is well for us they did so, else we had all (e're this) been Slaves to <HI>Rome,</HI> and Vassals to the <HI>French</HI> Tyrant: And I am persuaded you are sorry for nothing more, than that you see all Protestants, of what Persuasion soever, unite themselves in this, <HI>To defend the Act of the Settlement of the Crown, in the</HI> Prote∣stant Line, except your own dear selves: This is it that disturbs you; therefore it is, that you cast Bones of Contention amongst us, that if possible we should be divided, and then broken: But it is your safest Course to submit to the Government, as it is now Establish'd, by owning of it, and Swearing to it; and to return to that Church from which you have wander'd; for no doubt, but upon your return, you will be joyfully received. Take this Advice, for I am sure it will do you no harm.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Person having writ a Letter to Dr. <HI>Kennet,</HI> on his last 31st of <HI>January</HI> Sermon; which having Read, I cannot but admire at the extraordinary Gift of Raillery its Author is endow'd with: How∣ever, in his heat of Passion we may observe, That by way of Caution he reserves to himself so much Self-Interest and Pride, as to let it go Name∣less into the World, with but a bare Insinuation, of being Writ <HI>By a Gentleman.</HI> 'Tis certain, whoever our Author is, he has taken the wrong Methods to discover his Gentility, to a Person who, not asham'd of owning himself, has subscribed his Name to that Moderate Church-Sermon, which purges the Gall and Spleen of this unknown Gentleman. We may well enough suppose him to be (and I have Reason enough to believe it) a Person, who lyes under the Misfortune of being a <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> in his Heart, and, if I should examine a little further, 'tis ten to one, if a certain Friend of that Mighty Judicious Papistical Author, <HI>Heraclitus Ridens,</HI> cannot produce a Certificate of our Author's Gentility from the <HI>Marshalsea,</HI> or <HI>Queen's-Bench,—</HI> But suppose him, what he's Ambitious of, and think him a Learned and Liberal One too; and so come to examine the Particulars of his Letter.</P>
<P>In the first place, being a Stranger to the Doctor, he is mighty kind in making him a Present, by owning at the same time, that he's very in∣different whether he accepts it or not. Says he, <HI>I had rather do Violenceo</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
<HI>to my own Temper, than not Censure so persidious an Author, suitable to his D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rits.</HI> By this we may observe, the <HI>Gentleman</HI> is a Man of no better Principle than <HI>Temper,</HI> which he has done <HI>Violence</HI> to; and that those Principles which put Men upon doing <HI>Violence</HI> to Reason, spring either from the Doctrine of <HI>Infallibility,</HI> or a Loosness in Life and Morals; which too often runs a Head so far, as to lay violent Hands upon Nature it self at last.</P>
<P>But, to make an end of our Gentleman the <HI>Shortest-way,</HI> he adds; <HI>The just</HI> Scandal <HI>all good</HI> Churchmen, <HI>and</HI> Englishmen <HI>too, as well as</HI> my Self, <HI>have taken at your Sermon,</HI> &amp;c. Now, I appeal to the Publick, and ask, Whether any moderate good Clergyman, or <HI>Englishman,</HI> has so much as once appear'd in Print against the Doctor fairly, with his Name to the Book? I must confess, the Sermon has provok'd a great many Partizans of a <HI>French</HI> Interest, besides too many Hussing, Swearing, and High-flying Enemies to the true <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, in its extensive Acts of Charity, and the Rights and Priviledges of the People, to vilify and scandalize the Doctor, and spue out their Invectives against him. For my part, I know no others but such Creatures as these, which, with himself, he says very unlearnedly, have justly cast a <HI>Scandal</HI> upon him. A pretty Argument I take it against himself; wherein he insensibly owns, and con∣fesses Logically, That he, and some others, have <HI>Scandaliz'd the Doctor's Sermon:</HI> But suppose several <HI>Churchmen</HI> and <HI>Englishmen</HI> resented it, as he says, I would fain know of what Religion and Country he is. <HI>As well as my self,</HI> he adds, which Tacitly implies, That he is neither <HI>English,</HI> nor a true <HI>Churchman;</HI> and that the <HI>All</HI> he means, must be only those of the same Tribe and Gang of High-flyers, like himself.</P>
<P>After this, he runs on, and rails against the Doctor's Panegyrick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and exclaims against him, for calling the popular Commotions of that Time a <HI>Civil War,</HI> when, in the very Second Page of his Letter, he owns it as such himself; says he, <HI>I may, and do sincerely believe</HI> (the Reader is desired to observe the Harmony of this Expression) <HI>and know, That the late</HI> Civil War <HI>was en horrid</HI> Rebellion. <HI>I may, and do believe,</HI> is so bar∣barously put together, that it renders the whole Sentence Rediculous, and opposite to Sense: But our Author is a Gentleman, and it seems so far different from others, that he's void of all the necessary Qualifications requir'd in One.—</P>
<P>To proceed, He continues to exclaim against the Doctor, for making Additions to his Preached Sermon, and for leaving out several Expressi∣ons in his Printed one, which he spoke in the Pulpit. If he would have us Believe him before the Doctor, who with a Reputation above Malice, is well enough known by most People; he should have open'd himself freely to the World, that we might have been satisfied on whose Sleeve we were to pin our Faith: By this Obscurity there is too much Ground to believe, our Author's Pen was Mercenary; and that Necessity was at her the Product of this Passion, than Quality, or Zeal for the Cause;
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
so that whatever he says upon that Head, will meet with no Reception from true <HI>English</HI> Protestants, who always love to Believe with their Eyes open.</P>
<P>Further, in effect, he calls the Doctor Villain, along with that Great Man <HI>MILTON,</HI> &amp;c. thereby proving plainly, that his Principles are of the same Size and Latitude of those who drank a Health to <HI>Sorrel,</HI> re∣flecting at the same time on a Dead Monarch; Language more becom∣ing the Supporters of <HI>Billingsgate</HI> and the <HI>Bear-Garden,</HI> than one who styles himself a Gentleman! I never heard a Gentleman, in all my Life, bestow such an Epithet upon <HI>Milton;</HI> who, setting aside Republican Principles, deserves an Eternal Commemoration: 'Tis therefore rather an Honour for the Doctor to be ranked with so great a Man, than a Disparagement, as out Gentleman would Insinuate.</P>
<P>The rest of this Gentleman's Letter runs on with so many vain Repe∣titions and Scurrilous Impertinencies, that it is neither worth my while to Repeat, nor my Reader's to hear them. 'Tis enough to say, That if the Doctor had been any ways Guilty of Partiality in that Sermon, the World would have found him, else this, under another sort of Censure than this pretended Gentleman in Masquerade, has cast upon him.</P>
<P>To conclude, and come to the close of our Author's Letter, 'tis worth our while to observe what he says there with a Spirit of Rancor and Ma∣lice. 'Tis a sign he is what <HI>Englishmen</HI> had better be freed from; and that his Principles of <HI>Revenge</HI> are carried on not only against the Doctor, but to the Reverend Bishops: Says he, <HI>—The common Result is, especially with them who know how your Interest lyes, that those Reverend Prelates, who have hitherto espoused you, must be behind the Curtain.</HI></P>
<P>Which very Words manifest, that he is opposite to the present Con∣stitution of Government, which is now the best in the World, &amp; without its Continuation, <HI>England</HI> will be miserable. The spite he owes our Bi∣shops, gives us a prospect of the Affection he has, for a Government of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> and <HI>Arbitrary Power:</HI> Blessed be God, our Bishops are Men of more moderate and charitable Principles and such who have seen not long since, what dismal effects the contrary Opinions have had in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>Lastly, he is not content to Reproach the Bishops, but concludes all with Threat∣ning them thus: <HI>Thus</HI> (says he) <HI>are they innocently brought in for your Guilt, and as like to suffer still more, if they take not this Occasion to shew the utmost of their Resentments:</HI> That is as much as to say, those good Bishops who espouse you now, when time comes that we shall have a Red-hot persecuties Reign of our own, shall have a Residence in the Tower, and perhaps find a <HI>Russel</HI> or <HI>Essex</HI>'s Fate. Time may come, that we may have <HI>Popish</HI> Mass-houses, Seminaries and Nunneries, in this Kingdom; and then look out for a <HI>Godfrey</HI>'s, or <HI>Cornish</HI>'s Fate.</P>
<P>This, Reader, seem <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be the Language of this Letter-Monger, who, with all the Enemies to Queen <HI>ANNE,</HI> the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession, and present Liberty and Free∣dom of Conscience, make it their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to make us Slaves to <HI>France,</HI> and Ruin as all <HI>The Shortest Way,</HI> which God Almighty forbid <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
