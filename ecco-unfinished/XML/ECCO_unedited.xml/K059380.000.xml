<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S this Way of Writing in
Cases not much unlike this,
has been approv'd of, and
has met with great Success
in other Hands. It has been an En∣couragement
to this Ʋndertaking.</P>
<P>Historical Dialogues, it must be con∣fes'd,
have a very taking Elegancy in
them, and the Story being handed for∣ward
in short Periods, and quick Re∣turns,
makes the retaining it in the
Mind the easier, and the Impression the
more lasting, as well as delightful.</P>
<P><PB REF="3"/>
The Story represented here is capable
of such, and so many Applications to the
Cases of young People, whose Settlement
is always in View, that there will never
be a Time when the instruction will be
useless.</P>
<P>If any Body should object, that too
much is put here upon the Womans's Part,
and that a Lady cannot be suppos'd in
the midst of her Lover's Adddresses, to
take upon her, to demand such an Ac∣count
of himself as is here suggested;
that few Men will stoop to such an Exa∣mination;
and few Women venture the
Loss of their Lovers upon such a Subject.
Let such consider how small the Satis∣faction
here propos'd on the Ladies Part
is, and that no Gentleman can think
hard a Woman should be satisfy'd, whe∣ther
he is a Christian or a Heathen; a
Man of Religion or an Atheist, and
indeed, no Man of any tolerable Share of
Sense, will address himself to a Lady
<PB REF="4"/>
for Marriage, but he will take care to
anticipate her Enquiries of that Kind,
by flowing some Concern, for knowing
what she is herself.</P>
<P>The universal Neglect of this Trifle
both in Men and Women, is what this
Book is design'd to correct, and there
needs no greater Satyr upon that Part,
than the Success of the several Cases
here related; The happy Life of the
youngest Sister who came into the Mea∣sures
proposed; and the miserable Con∣dition
of the second Sister, who rashly
threw herself into the Arms of a Man
of differing Principles from her own, tho
blest with all the good Humour in the
World.</P>
<P>In these Accounts, the very great
Consequence of being equally yok'd, is il∣lustrated;
and it appears here how es∣sentail
a Share of Religion, and Har∣mony
of Principles in Religion, is to
the Felicity of Life.</P>
<P><PB REF="5"/>
To those who do not cast off all con∣cern
for themselves; who do not make
marrying be a mere Leap in the Dark,
and as the first Lady expresses it, a
rushing like a Horse into the Battle,
these things will be of some Moment.
As to those that are void of Care of these
Matters, they must go on, and pay for
their Experience, let them take heed,
and buy it as cheap as they can.</P>
<P>If the Women seem to be favoured
in this Story, and have the better Part
of the Staff put into their Hands, it
is because really the Hazard is chiefly on
their Side, and they are generally the
greatest Sufferers in the Success; but
if it were otherwise, yet, if they are
treated with more than ordinary Regard,
the Author hopes they will not lay that
Sin to his Charge.</P>
<P>The Appendix to this Work, speaks
for it self: Irreligious Servants in some
Respects, are the Plague of Families,
<PB REF="6"/>
and keep our Houses always in Disorder,
'Tis a wonderful Thing to reflect on,
that so scandalous an Evil, so easy to
be rectify'd should have gone on to such
a Degree as it has in the World; and
that Masters and Mistresses of Fami∣lies,
have not long, ago for their own
Ease, and for the Satisfaction of one
another, come to a General Law, for
the managing, the punishing, and above
all, for the recommending of Servants;
which if they should do, they would easi∣ly,
I say, bring them to know them∣selves,
and do their Duty; neither of
which is the Case among Servants at
this Time.</P>
<P>But 'tis all our own Faults; we re∣commend
Sluts, and Thieves, and
Drones, and saucy insolent Fellows,
and Wenches: I say, we recommend
them one to another, without any Con∣cern
for our Neighbour's Safety or
Peace; in a Word, to pay the Debt of
<PB REF="7"/>
Charity for those Creatures, which have
abus'd us, we forget the Debt of Justice
to one another, and betray the Confidence
which one House-keeper and Neighbour
owes to another, in one of the most essen∣tial
Articles of their Families Quiet.</P>
<P>This is all expos'd here, and tho' this
Part is very short; being but an Ac∣cident
to the other Discourses; yet, I
presume my self it will be as accepta∣ble,
and in its Kind, as useful as any
of the Rest.</P>

<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE liv'd in a Village near <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
an ancient grave Gentleman
of a good Estate, which he had
gain'd by Trade, having been bred
a Merchant, tho' of a very good
Family too; he had been a Man
in great Business, but his Circum∣stances
being easy, and his Love of a retir'd Life
increasing, with his Years, he had left off his Bu∣siness,
and taken a House a Mile or two out of
Town; he was a Widower at the Time of this
Affair, his Wife having been dead some years
before.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="9"/>
He had five or six Children, and all grown up,
but none settled in the World, tho' he had an
Estate sufficient to give them very plentiful For∣tunes.
His three Daughters were very agreeable
Women, and, which was still better, were very
sober, modest, sensible and religious young Ladies,
two 'of them especially; and as the Character of
their Father, and the Fortune he was able to give
them, recommended them very well to the World;
so they had several Gentlemen that made honour∣able
and handsome Proposals to their Father for
their Marriage.</P>
<P>I shall most carefully avoid giving any room
here so much as to guess what Opinion in Reli∣gion
they were bred up in, or whether the old
Gentleman was a Churchman or a Dissenter; and
the same Caution I shall use with all the rest of
the Persons whom I shall bring upon the Stage in
the Course of this Story: My Reason for which
every Body will understand by the Nature of the
Relation, and of the Times we live in.</P>
<P>The Father of these Ladies had been a Man al∣ways,
till now, hurried in the World; being
crowded with a vast Business, taken up with get∣ting
Money, and with growing rich; so that he
neither had much Concern for, or indeed took
any Care of the Education or Instruction of his
Children, but left them wholly to the Conduct of
their Mother. Nor was it any great Loss to the
Children, especially to the Daughters, their Mo∣ther
being a most pious, religious and virtuous
Lady, who was not only extraordinarily qualified
to instruct her Children, but gave up her whole
Time to it from their Childhood.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10"/>
A little before her Death, calling to her Daugh∣ters,
she told them among other Things, That as
to Marriage she had but two Injunctions to lay
upon them, which, as she was not likely to live
to see them settled, file would desire them to lay
down as Maxims in the Choice of their Husbands;
and which she would, as upon her Death-bed, if
her Words had any extraordinary Influence upon
them, oblige them to observe strictly, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. Never to marry any Man, what ever the For∣tune
might be, that did not at least profess to be a <HI>Re∣ligious
Man.</HI></P>
<P>2. Never to marry any Man, how religious soever he
may <HI>seem to be,</HI> if he was not of the same Principles
and Opinion in Religion as themselves.</P>
<P>And as this was but a little before her Death, so
the Daughters were more than ordinarily touch'd
with the Sense of it, and resolv'd to pursue it ex∣actly.
How they did pursue it, and the Confse∣quences
of it will be seen in the following Dia∣logues.</P>
<P>It followed some time after, that a Gentleman
of a very good Estate courted the youngest of
these Daughters; and making Very handsome Pro∣posals
to her Father, (<HI>for he offer'd to settle</HI> 600 l. per
Annum <HI>upon her</HI>) the Father was exceedingly
pleased with the Match; he being a Gentleman
thoroughly well bred; an agreeable Person, and
in a Word, nothing appearing to give the least
Reason, why he should not be as acceptable to the
Lady as he was to the Father.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11"/>
As he came thus recommended to the Father,
there appeared nothing disagreeable in it to the
young Lady; nor had she at his first Appearance
the least Exception to make against the Gentle∣man
as to his Person; Indeed, as to his Estate,
<HI>tho' her Fortune was very handsome,</HI> yet his was so far
beyond it, that there was no Comparison in the
Case; and besides all this, she had this engaging
Circumstance in the Proposal, <HI>viz.</HI> That she be∣ing
the youngest of the three Daughters, the
Gentleman had pass'd over her two eldest Sisters,
and had singled her put by his more particular
Fancy; giving her that undeniable Mark of his
Affection, <HI>viz.</HI> That she would be the Wife of his
Choice, and consequently that she would have an
uncommon Security of the Sincerity of his Love
to her.</P>
<P>The Father oppos'd his Proposal a little at first,
as a Slight offer'd to his eldest Daughters; but the
Gentleman told him, That he hop'd, if he accept∣ed
his Design of corning into his Family, he would
give him leave to take the Person his Judgment
had made choice of, and that he thought he might
be happy with: That it would be a very hard
Circumstance to him, and what he could not think
of with Patience, to marry one of his Daughters,
and be in love with another: That he was very
far from offering any Slight to the eldest, letting
them know, that happening to see the youngest
first, he found such Suitableness, and something
so agreeable in her to him, that he resolv'd to look
no farther: That perhaps, if he had seen the eldest
or the second Daughter first, it might have been
the same thing; but that as he could not answer for
the Byafs of his Fancy, so neither could he answer
it to his own Conduct, not to choose her, that was
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
from the first Moment he saw her, the only Wo∣man
in the World, that he ever thought could
make him happy.</P>
<P>Her Father could make no Return to an Answer
that had so much Weight in it, and which ap∣peared
to be so sincere; and therefore not acquaint∣ing
his eldest Daughters with the Design he had
had to propose her to him, he took occasion to talk
to them all together one Morning, as they were
drinking Chocolate; and begins merrily with them
thus:</P>

<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ELL, Girls; you little think
now, which of you all is like to
be first married. What say you,
Child? (turning to the young∣est).
I hope you are content to let your eldest
Sisters go before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, Sir; I desire both my
Sisters may go before me; for I see nothing in the
World, to make me in haste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? what's the matter that you are so
out of love with the World all on a sudden? Is it
that you think your self too good for every body,
or every Body too good for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; I am neither so vain to think
the first, or so humble to think the last; but I
desire to think of my self as I ought to think.</P>

<P>How is that pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I think I live too well to
change for the worse, and this is not an Age to
change for the better; and therefore I desire to be
as I am.</P>

<P>Why is this Age so much worse than that
that went before, pray?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir I don't know; but I am very
well satisfied, Sir, with your first Proposal, that
my Sisters may try before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; and if you go before your
Sisters, there will be no harm done, if it be to
your liking, I hope; I dare say, none of your
Sisters will be angry; <HI>at which,</HI> the two eldest
said, no, no, we shall be very glad to see it; and
so they fell to jesting with their younger Sister,
till they almost anger'd her.</P>
</SP>
<P>You are mighty difficult, <HI>says the eldest Sister,</HI>
that you fall upon the whole World, as if there
was nothing good enough for you.</P>
<P><HI>Says the second Sister,</HI> she will be as easily pleas'd
as another, I warrant her, if she was talk'd to in
earnest; upon which, notwithstanding their Fa∣ther
was present, they fell to rallying one another,
between Jest and Earnest, a little too warmly, as
follows:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may be; <HI>as my eldest Sisters</HI> teach
me, I hope they intend to set me a good Exam∣ple;
for <HI>it's their Turn first.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't know that; if a good Offer
come in your Way, you'll hardly put it off, and
say, <HI>Your Betters must go before you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>For all you are both my <HI>elder Sisters,</HI> I
question whether you understand what a <HI>good Of∣fer</HI>
means; and it may be, have consider'd it <HI>no
more than I;</HI> there's a great deal in that Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I'll explain it in a few Words; <HI>a
good Estate,</HI> and <HI>a Man you like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay; you might have stopt at the first:
it's no matter what the Man is, if the Estate be
but good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that the Example <HI>my eldest Sisters</HI> in∣tend
to set me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; and a good Example too, Child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are dispos'd to jest, Sir; but I be∣lieve
you would not be pleas'd, with such a Way
of chusing a Husband for any of your Daughters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope my Father would; <HI>I am sure I
should.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's no Token to me that you have
consider'd much of the matter, <HI>as I said before.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? What would you have besides a
good Estate? What matter is it what the Man is?
I would pass by a great many homely Defers for
a good Settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>As for the homely Defects,</HI> perhaps I may
be no nicer than you, if there was nothing else
wanting.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can be wanting, if there be Mo∣ney

<P>Nothing, I hope, when my Sister comes
to choose.</P>

<P>No; nor when you come to choose nei∣ther,
it <HI>may be.</HI></P>

<P>For my part I shall inquire for nothing

<P>What have I to do with his Religion?
He'll be a <HI>Christian,</HI> I hope.</P>

<P>And what if he should not?</P>

<P>Nay, then he may be a Heathen <HI>and he
will,</HI> what's that to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Proof of what I said before,
that you have not consider'd much of the Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, not I; but I suppose my
younger Sister has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your youngest Sister never told you so
yet: But methinks there requires very little Con∣sideration,
to say, if I ever should marry, I would
not have a Rake, a Heathen, a profligate Fellow,
a Man without Religion, purely for his Money;
if you think these Things no Objections, and are
got over such Scruples in the Case, I must tell
you, Sister, that it seems the Business has been
more in your Head than in mine, or at least to
worse purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it may be so; and then it may
follow, that when you have consider'd more of it
too, you will be of my Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>What to marry an Atheist! a Man of
no Principles! that knows neither God nor Devil?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; that, or any thing else, if you
have but a good Settlement, Child. A good Set∣tlement
will make up all those Things; you'd take
him I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister; nor for all that I could see
with my Eyes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you dont know your own Mind,
till you come to be tried; we shall see you tell a∣nother
Tale hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>2d. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I an't so fond of a Husband, whatever
my Sister is.</P>
<P>Here the Father seeing that the younger Sister
began to be a little mov'd, and unwilling they
should make a Quarrel of it, put an end to the
Discourse, and so they soon after withdrew; and
Then the Father being left with the eldest Daughter
only, went on with his Discourse thus to her.</P>

all in jest or no.</P>

in jest; if there is any thing in it, I should have
talk'd after another way<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she was very inquisitive with her Father to know if there was any thing in it or not, at which he only smil'd.</NOTE></P>

your youngest Sister married before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>O very well, Sir; I shall be very glad of
it, if it be for her good: But if I were to speak
my Mind, I should say something to it about her,
that, it may be, there may be occasion for.</P>

<P>Well; pray speak your Mind then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How do you mean, Child?</P>

<P>Nay; How can I understand you any other

<P>Sir, I mean, that my Sister will not be easily
pleas'd; she will scarce take the first that comes, I
dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; then I shall take it very ill: For I as∣sure
you, he that I mean is a very <HI>good one.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if he is a <HI>good one,</HI> it may be, she may;

your <HI>good one</HI> may be both of a sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he has a very good Estate, I'll assure
you, far beyond what she can expect.</P>

well-bred Gentleman; she cannot mislike
him; he is a most agreeable young Gentleman I

<P>That won't go a bit the farther with her
neither, <HI>I am sure.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Then he is in love with her, and has singl'd
her out from you all; she will be the Wife of his

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>She will desire <HI>something more</HI> still, Sir, tho'
the last is a thing will go very far doubtless; far∣ther
than any thing we have talk'd on yet: But
<HI>you know, Sir,</HI> my Sister is a very sober, religious
Body, and she will never marry any Man that is
not so too; tho' his Estate, his Person, his Accom∣plishments
were beyond all the rest of the World;
and this was the Reason, why I said she may be
first ask'd, and last marry'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, I can't tell, how Matters are, as to
that.</P>

<P>But, Sir, when you know her Mind in that
Case, it may prevent your receiving any Disap∣pointment,
and prevent her venturing to disoblige
you, in refusing what you may propose to her.</P>

<P>No, no; I dare say she won't refuse him;
she is not such a Fool neither.</P>

<P>Dear Sir, then I hope you know he is a
sober religious Gentleman.</P>

<P>I know nothing to the contrary, my Dear;
I suppose he is.</P>
</SP>

<P>But, Sir, it makes me anxious about it, be∣cause
you said just now, you could not tell: I hope
you will enquire farther into it before you take
any farther Steps about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Child, as to that, I dare say, she need
not be concerned; he is so good a humour'd Man,
he will never cross her in small Matters, especially
in religious Things. Child, do you think any
Gentleman can be angry, that his Wife is sober and
religious; to be sure; she may be as religious as she
Will.</P>

so concern'd about it?</P>

<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a sad Life, Sir, for a Woman to have
no Help from her Husband in Things that are
good, but only to have Liberty for herself to be
as good as she will, or rather as good as she can:
By the same Rule she may be as bad as she will,
and it may be, he will like her ne'er the better for
one, nor the worse for t'other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; he is a fine Gentleman, and professes
a great Affection for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before he has seen her, it may be, or
knows any thing of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he has seen her, but he has never
been in her Company, I know.</P>
</SP>

<P>So that I find he cares not what she is, he
chuses by her outside only.</P>

<P>But my Sister won't take him so, I can tell
him that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall take it very ill from her, if she slights
him; for I assure you, he is not to be slighted, he
has very near 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am sure, if he is not a <HI>religious Man,</HI>
she will slight him for all that; my Meaning is,
she will never <HI>have him;</HI> I suppose the will not be
rude to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If she <HI>does refuse him,</HI> she and I shall quarrel,
I assure you, and that very much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you won't, Sir: You will give her
leave to chuse to her own liking; it is for her
Life, and she must bear the Discomfort of it; no
Body, can bear it for her: Besides, Sir, you know
she was very religiously instructed by my Mother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; your Mother was a good Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you know, Sir, <HI>I suppose,</HI> what Advice
my Mother gave her upon her Death-bed, <HI>viz.

Never to marry a Man that was not religious, whatever
other Advantages might offer with him.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>And did she not give you the same Advice
too, my Dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes to be sure, and all of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and yet you heard what your Sister
said just now, <HI>viz. That she would not trouble herself
about it, so there was but a good Estate.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope my Sister would confider better,
if she came to the Question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Why, <HI>Child,</HI> would you refuse such a Gen∣tleman,
and such a Settlement as this is, that offers
now to your Sister, for such a Nicety as that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be time enough, Sir, for me to an∣swer
that Question? when I am offer'd such a one;
there's no Danger of me yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you would be wiser.</P>

<P>I hope, Sir, I should act as becomes me:

<P><HI>Yes, Sir;</HI> and more than Advice: For she

<P>Very well: that was as much as to say, <HI>she

<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, indeed, <HI>Dear Father,</HI> we never put
any such Construction upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, my Dear, you think your Sister
will not like this Gentleman do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, <HI>I cannot tell,</HI> till I know what
kind of a Gentleman he is; no, <HI>nor then neither;</HI>
for how can I tell what my Sister will like, or how
her Fancy may lead her to act against her Judg∣ment
if she should like him very well upon seeing
him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you believe she won't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he is not <HI>a very sober religious Man,</HI> I do
think she won't; <HI>if she does,</HI> she must break in up∣on
the most solemn Resolutions, that she is able to
make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, will nothing serve her but a Saint?
alas! where does she think to find him? What!
would she marry a Bishop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sir, if she should, she is not sure, she
should not be disappointed; Ministers are but
Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed. Child; nor always the best of
Men neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, where there is a Profession of
Religion, there is some Likelihood of finding the
Truth of it; but where there is no Profession,
there it cannot be. Now tho' we are not obliged
to be sure our Husbands should be Saints, yet I
believe we ought to be satisfied, that they are not
Atheists; there's a great deal of difference, Sir,
between a Friend to Religion, and an Enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; the Girls of this Age do not
much trouble their selves about Religion; they
generally let it alone, till they see what Religion
their Husbands are of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="22"/>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Father, I hope <HI>your Girls</HI> ate not of
that Sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Daughters are like other Folks Daught∣ers,
<HI>I believe,</HI> I hope they are not worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir, if that were true, then there
would still be the more Reason to take care that
they should marry <HI>religious Husbands,</HI> else they
would have no Religion at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how shall you know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must endeavour to be satisfy'd as well
as we can; if we are deceived, it may be our Un∣happiness,
but will not be our Faulty; <HI>but if we
neglect</HI> the Caution, it may be a double Misery, by
its being our Sorrow, and our Sin too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, I hope this Gentleman will
please <HI>your Sister,</HI> as well as he does me; and I
would not have her stand in her own Light; if he
is not so religious now, it may come afterwards;
the Man is a sober, well bred, ingenious Gentle∣man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can say nothing to it, Sir, unless I knew
him, I only take notice of the Principle, Sir,
on which my Sister goes, and by which I am sure
she will act in this Matter, that you may not be
disappointed, and relent it; for I know she will
not go from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll warrant you: I intend to talk with her
about it; I don't doubt but she will like him very
well.</P>
<P>Two or three Days after this Discourse the
Father brings home this young Gentleman to Din∣ner,
and after Dinner he takes occasion to talk
with his Daughter, and to tell her that, this was
the Gentleman that he had told her of, that in∣tended
to court her, and that he expected, she
<PB N="16" REF="23"/>
would <HI>think of the thing,</HI> and receive him as her
own Inclinations and his Merit should direct.</P>
<P>The Gentleman did not discourse much with
her by herself that time, having no Design to be∣gin
closely at the first View; however, he had the
Opportunity of walking two or three Turns with
her in a green Walk in the Garden, and when he
took his Leave, told her he resolv'd to wait on her
again; to which she made him no Answer for that
time.</P>
<P>The next Evening he came again, and after that
for several Evenings together, when having made
her acquainted with his Design, and laid close
Siege to her for some time, she found nothing to
object against him; for he was indeed a most agree∣able
Person, and her Father pressing her to it on
the other Hand, and letting her know, what ho∣nourable
Proposals he had made her▪ and how he
had singled her out from all her Sisters as the Ob∣ject
of his Choice, she began insensibly to find
her Affections very strongly byass'd in his Favour.</P>
<P>All this while she could make no Discovery of
any thing about Religion in him, nor so much as
whether he was well inclin'd, or perfetctly desti∣tute.
The Respect he shew'd her, and the Di∣stance
she kept him at, permitted him not to use
any loose Expressions, that might give her any
Light into his Principles; and as he afterwards
confess'd, he found her so nice in things of that
Kind, that the least dislocated Word would have
given her an Offence; and therefore he kept up∣on
his Guard a great while, till at length, when
they became more intimate, he abated his usual
Caution.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="24"/>
By this Time, as she confess'd to her Sister, she
did not only like him, but really lov'd him; and
having nothing to object against him, had given
him Reason to fee, that she design'd to have him▪
But she was under a great Concern, how to know
what he was as to Religion; and terribly afraid,
lest she should give her Affections such a loose,
that tho' she should be deceived in the main Point,
she should not be able to master herself so much
as to go back. As she was musing very seriously
upon this one Morning in her Chamber, her eldest
Sister came in to her, and began the following
Discourse with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister! How stands the World with
you now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never worse, Sister: if you do not
help me I am undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the Matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why if I have this Man, I shall be the
miserablest Creature alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! there's nothing of Religion in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you sure there is not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I am not sure; but we have con∣vers'd
this Month now, and I never heard one
Word about it, come out of his Mouth; and if I
speak a Word, he turns it off, and does it so cle∣verly,
that I can't put in another Word for my
Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant, I would find it out, if it were
my Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You could not, I am sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I would ask him point blank,
what Religion he was of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="25"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so I did; and he laugh'd at the
and said, <HI>O Child, I am a mighty good Christian.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have told him, I was afraid he
wa'n't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I did that too, in the very Words,
and still he put me off: Another time I ask'd him,
if he was not a Papist? Immediately he fell a cros∣sing
himself all over, and made himself and me
too so merry at it, that tho' I was really troubled
about it, I could not for my Life get the least se∣rious
Thing out of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you must let it go on a little far∣ther,
till you are more intimate; and till you
Come to talk of your way of Living, the Affairs
of his Family, and House, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sister, I am afraid to go on any
farther; for I must confess, I begin to have a strange
Kindness for him; and if I go any farther, I may
love him better, till my Affection may be a Snare
to me, and I may be prevail'd with to take him
without farther Enquiry, which I shall have no
Peace in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will you do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to do; I wish you
would try what you can make of him; you are
free enough with him to talk any thing of that
kind sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can be free enough, but that won't
do it; if he is too cunning for you, he will easily
be too cunning for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you think then, that 'tis a Dis∣guise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else can it be? Do you think he
guards himself so strictly against all your Attempts
for nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I thought so, I should inquire no far∣ther;
it would be a plain Discovery to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if he was a serious religious Per∣son,
he would have no Reason or Occasion to
conceal it; if he endeavours to hide himself, 'tis
for something that he would not have known, and
then I need not ask any more after it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No doubt of it: you cannot think any
other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Indeed I do think otherwise: I ve∣rily
believe it is all meer Nature, and nothing
but the height of good Humour; for I have never
put the Question down right to him, but in a kind
of jesting way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why don't you then? Why do you
trifle and dally so long with a Thing of such Con∣sequence?
You a'n't afraid of disobliging him, are
you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed; am more afraid, that his
Answer will disoblige me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; you had better have it
discours'd now, than hereafter; I would not be
backward to speak plain to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I talk never so plain, he will not give
a serious Answer; he is so merry, I cannot bring
him to talk; I beg you will see, if you can break
in upon him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come; I'll tell you what I will do,
which will be better a great deal than my talking
with him by my self: You know we shall walk all
together a while after Supper; I'll begin it before
you, and you may speak or not speak, take it in
jest or in earnest, as you find it proper.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do then; I think that will be very well.</P>

The next Evening the two Sisters and this young
Gentleman walking in the Garden, as was usual
after Supper, and talking of several indifferent
Things, a Servant brings the eldest Sister a Letter,
which made some little Stop in their Walk. She
open'd it, and read it; and he finding her Colour
change a little in the reading, stept up to her;
says he, <HI>What's the matter, Sister?</HI> (for he always
call'd her Sister) <HI>You have no bad News, I hope?
Truly,</HI> says she, <HI>one way 'tis no bad News, and another
way 'tis.</HI> And turning to her Sister, she says, <HI>Sir</HI>
James <HI>is dead.</HI> He was a little concern'd to hear
some of the Family was dead, lest it should grieve
his Mistress. But she, without any appearance of
Trouble return'd, <HI>Well, since 'tis the Disposal of Pro∣vidence,
I am not griev'd; For my Aunt is delivered
from one of the worst good Husbands, that ever a sober
Woman had.</HI> He took hold of that Word presently,
and still directing his Speech to her Sister, said,
<HI>Worst good Husband! What Mystery is that?</HI> Why tru∣ly,
says the Sister, <HI>the thing's too true:</HI> Sir <HI>James</HI>
was a very good Husband in his Humour, and in
several other Things; but my <HI>Lady</HI> had a dreadful
Life with him. <HI>Why,</HI> says he, <HI>that may be very true;
a Man may be a very good Husband in one things, and be
very unkind in another, it's owing much to the Disagree∣ment
of Tempers.</HI> The young Lady's Sister was dis∣appointed
in his Answer; for she expected he would
have inquired into the Particulars, but he put it
off, as a Thing, that did not concern him much; at
which the younger Sister look'd at her and smil'd,
which was as much as to tell her, that she had
found now, that what she had told her was true;
namely, that she would not see it easy to break in
upon him. She took the Hint, and resolved she
would try the best of her Skill, and she found it
<PB N="21" REF="28"/>
soon answer'd her End: so she returned to him
pretty smartly, <HI>No, no, Sir,</HI> says she, <HI>It was not at
all from Disagreement of Tempers in this Case,</HI> it was
worse a great deal, <HI>it was Disagreement of Principles;
for the Gentleman was of a very good Temper, I assure you:
Then if he had a good Wife,</HI> returns he, <HI>he should
have made it his first Principle to have been obliging and
good temper'd to his Wife.</HI> Alas! says the Lady, <HI>he
had no Religion, and she is the most pious religious Lady
in the World.</HI> It may be then, <HI>says he,</HI> she had
enough for her and her Husband too. <HI>Her being
religious,</HI> said she, <HI>made his Want of it an insufferable
Burden to her:</HI> Then she was co blame, sayshe,
for what need she have been uneasy at that? <HI>Not
uneasy!</HI> says she, <HI>How is it possible a religious Woman
can live comfortably with an irreligious prophane Husband!
O very well,</HI> says he again; <HI>What signifies it to a Wo∣man,
whether her Husband have any Religion or no?</HI>
I have better Thoughts of you, <HI>says she,</HI> than to
believe you speak as you think, or that you would
be understood so.</P>
<P>Her Sister had listened very attentively to all
this, and was sensibly affected with it, but had said
nothing till now, when she turned upon her Sister.
<HI>Why Sister,</HI> says she, <HI>should you think so? I hope Mr.</HI>
—<HI>says nothing but what he is very sincere in. Do
you think he has not his Religion to choose as well as other
young Gentlemen?</HI> Madam, says he, <HI>How should I
choose my Religion, that have not chosen me a Wife?</HI> Then
you are for chusing you a Wife first, <HI>says his Mistress,</HI>
and your Religion afterwards. Why, Madam,
says he, <HI>Don't all the Gentlemen in</HI> England <HI>do so too?</HI>
I don't know, what they do, <HI>says she,</HI> but I know
what they ought to do.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="29"/>
She was now too well satisfied of what she fear'd
before, and her Mind was so oppress'd with it, that
she was not able to hold; but making an Excuse
to take her Sister's Letter, and go in and tell her
Father the News of the Death of his Brother in
Law, she left her Sister to walk with her Lover,
and went up into her Chamber, and locking herself
in, she gave vent to her Passions by crying vehe∣mently
a great while: When she had recover'd her∣self,
and consider'd that she was obliged in Civility
to go down again, she composed her Thoughts,
and kneeling down, prayed to God to fortify her
Soul in the Resolutions she had always taken, never
to joyn herself to any Man, that did not acknow∣ledge
God, and profess to fear and serve him; and
in this Temper me went down to him again.</P>
<P>She was with him after that, some Hours in the
Evening, as usual; but he observ'd she was not
easy nor free: At length she told him, that up∣on
this Occasion of a Relation being dead, it was
proper for the Family, and decent to their Father,
that they should make some little Alteration in
their Conduct, and desir'd he would not take it ill,
that she retired from him sooner than she us'd to
do. This he could not object against, and accor∣dingly
he took his leave, believing that her Unea∣siness
was nothing, but the Business of her Aunt's
being a Widow, which, tho', as she said, me was
not much concern'd for, yet several things about
it, might take up her Thoughts, so as to make her
not so perfectly easy, or so good Company as she
was before.</P>
<P>But he was quite out in his Guess; for her Un∣easiness
was of another kind., and she had nothing
now lay upon her Mind, but how she should dis∣charge
herself entirely of his Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtunities, and
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
yet without being rude and uncivil to him, and
without disobliging her Father; for she was firmly
resolved in her Mind never to see him more.</P>
<P>When she had thus taken her Leave of him, she
went up into her Chamber, sending her Maid to

<P>Dear Father, do not be angry with me; 'tis
no Business of mine; I had rather say no more of
it, for I see it will put you in a Passion: But why
should you be in a Passion with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in a Passion! who can but be in a Passion
with all of you? chang'd her Mind say you! Ay;

<P>Sir, she is very much indispos'd; if you
would please to let her alone till to Morrow, she
may be better able to speak for herself, and you
may not be so much in a Passion with her.</P>

<P>Well, let her alone till Morning, then; I
suppose she'll change her Mind again by that time.</P>

<P>Well; then I'll be of the same Mind too

</SP>
<P>The eldest Sister went up, after Supper, to her
Sister's Chamber, who waited for her, impatient
enough. As soon as she came, she gave her Sister
an Account of what Discourse she had had with
her Father, and how angry he was; which, tho'
it terrified and afflicted her very much, yet it did
not move her at all, to alter her Resolutions; and
she endeavour'd, as well as she could, to furnish her∣self
with Answers to give her Father when he should
begin with her. But whether it was, that her Fa∣ther
was impatient to hear what she had to say, or
that she believing he would not meddle with it
till Morning, came unwarily in his Way, is not
material; but happening to see her the same Night,
<PB N="27" REF="34"/>
he call'd her in to him, and told her, he wanted to
speak with her.</P>
<P>He began very mildly with her, <HI>which a little
incourag'd her; for she was something surprized at his
beginning to talk, before she expected it,</HI> and taking
her by the Arm, feels for her Pulse. What's the
Matter with you. Child? says her Father; they
told me you wan't well; I think your Pulse, beats
very true.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am better, Sir, now; but I was very
much out of Order.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a little in love, my Dear, that's all, I
hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No indeed, Sir; the contrary to an Ex∣tream,
as I suppose my Sister has told you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Your Sister, Child! I can lay no Stress on
any thing she said; I cannot tell whether she was
in jest or in earnest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am very sorry, that what she said is
disobliging, and more, that it should put you into
a Passion; I hope, when you consider of it, you
will be of the same Mind with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, Child, by the same
Mind? I have recommended a Gentleman to you,
whom you can have no Objection against, and his
Estate is double to what you can expect: you told
me your self, that you had no Objection against
his Person, and he has made you his Choice, and
is in love with you above all your Sisters, what
can you desire more?</P>

<P>If it was not to my Father, I should give a

may displease you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't be displea'd with Words, so much as
I am by Actions: The Gentleman has made his
way thro' every thing, made Proposals too great
for any Father to refuse; you have entertain'd him,
shew'd him a great deal of Respect, and now to
treat him thus, and treat your Father thus, 'tis in∣tolerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>When the Gentleman and you treated of
this Matter, it was without me; I had no Know∣ledge

<P>Well, I know that.</P>

well by your Command have ordered me to marry
him the first Day, as now.</P>

<P>Well, what do you make of all this?</P>

<P>Upon frequent Visits made me, I found
nothing disagreeable in him, and shewed him as

shewed him more than became me.</P>

<P>Yes, truly, if you resolve not to have him.</P>

<P>Why should you have entertain'd him at all,
if you resolved not to have him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not for some time resolve not to have
him, till I discover'd him farther; and it was your
Command, that put me first upon the Trial, and
my Reasons against it now are good, if you please
to hear them patiently; but I'll rather bear all you
please to lay on me, than put you into Passions at
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire no Reasons, nor no Discourse; an∣swer
me the Question in short, whether you will
have him or no; it will raise my Passion less, than
your impertinent Reasons.</P>

<P>I know her Reasons well enough; he is not
Hypocrite enough for her, I suppose; if a fawn∣ing
smooth-toungu'd Fellow would come and talk
Scripture to her, she would take him presently; she
Does not know what Religion is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, if that were true, she would have
stronger Reasons for desiring a religious Husband,
than she may have now; that she might have a kind
Instructor to assist her; we have all need of Helps
that way at least; we need no prophane Husbands
to keep us back; a loose, irreligious Husband is a
dreadful Snare.</P>
</SP>
<P>This was a Night of Passion, and little was done
all the Evening by the Father but to make Work
for Repentance. He was so provoked at his
Daughter, that he made terrible Resolutions against
her, that he would never give her a Farthing, that
he would turn her out of doors; that she should go
to Service; that he would make his Will, and
whatever he left to the rest of his Children, it
should be upon Condition, that they should never
relieve her, nor own her, nor call her Sister, and
that if they did, what they had should go to his
eldest Son, and the like.</P>
<P>He was so disturbed, that he got but little Sleep
all Night, and in the Morning he was obliged to
go out of Town early to his Sister's, about 40 Miles
off, whose Husband was just dead; so that he did
not see his youngest Daughter any more, before he
went; but just as he was stepping into his Chariot,
he call'd his eldest Daughter to him, <HI>What,</HI> says he,
Child, is to be done in this Affair while I am gone?
She won't be so rude to turn him off, while I am
away, will she? <HI>Indeed, Sir,</HI> says the Daughter, <HI>I
am perplexed about it; I hnow not how it will be ma∣nagged,
<PB N="32" REF="39"/>
but I believe she will see him no more.</HI> Not see
him! says the Father, that's the unmannerliest
Thing in the World: Sure she won't be so rude
to me; she might give me the Opportunity to put
an End to it handsomly. <HI>Pray tell her,</HI> I experct it,
<HI>and</HI> I assure you, <HI>if she refuses to see him till my Return,
I'll never see her more as long as I live.</HI></P>
<P>In this Temper the Father went away: The
eldest Daughter, poor Lady, had her Heart full
with such a Message, and scarce knew how to de∣liver
it; however, upon talking farther with her
Sister the same Morning, and finding her inflexible,
and perhaps more stiff, than she thought she needed
to be, she did at last deliver it; their Dialogue was
short, but effectual, as follows,</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, what will you do in this
Matter? <HI>My Father is gone.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can I do? I think my Father is
very unkind to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Father is passionate, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>

Reasons, this is very hard! Do any Father's mar∣ry
their Daughters by Force?</P>
</SP>

<P>Why, I'll tell you what my Father <HI>says

<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, Do you think them of no

</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's true, <HI>my Dear;</HI> but consider,

my dear Mother's Words, that this can∣not
be understood of any thing but a religious Per∣son
marrying with a prophane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister; and you remember the
Charge she gave us, and the Promise we made her:
I look upon those things to be very binding in
themselves, and very sacred Engagements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are binding indeed to what is our
Duty at the same time, and they add Force to it,
otherwise the Case would differ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so I understand it; and I am sure,
Reason, Experience, and the Nature of the thing
joyn with it: what a wretched House must there
be, whether it be the Man or the Woman's Case,
where one is a Christian, and t'other an Infidel;
one devout, and the other prophane; one pious
and religious, and the other knowing or valuing
nothing that is serious? what <HI>Helps to Heaven</HI> are
such to one another! for my part, I need no wic∣ked

no ill Examples to allure me to Folly, I want all

<SP>

<P>No, I did not hear them; and I am

him or yourself Justice else; for first perhaps you
may find, that tho' he talk'd loosely then, when
he did not know perhaps, whether we were in Jest
or in Earnest, yet if you talked seriously with him
of the main Point your self, (<HI>for you know our Dis∣course
was at a Distance, and was rather a kind of civil
Raillery than Argument,</HI>) youmay find one of these
<PB N="35" REF="42"/>
two Things will happen, <HI>viz.</HI> either he will talk
seriously, and let you see, that he has a Bottom of
religious good Sentiments, which is all you ought
to insist upon, and would be a happy Discovery on
your side, or talk prophanely and be self-convicted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is more Weight in this, than in
all you have said yet; but I can never do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; let me add to it, what I was
loth to tell you, and that is, what my Father said
just now<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She tells her her Father's Words, which staggers hr Resolutions.</NOTE> when he went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Father uses me very hardly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it; but 'tis in no Body's
Power to help it; he would be the same to any
of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you advise me to do, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, if I might advise you, I would
have you see him once more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what Purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if it be only to try, whether
what he said before was in jest, or in earnest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Discovery is not worth the
Complement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, I can't say that. Would you
be contented to have it true, that he is a sober and
religiously inclined Gentleman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, with ail my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not an Estate of near 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year,
and an agreeable Gentleman, very suitable, when
it's joined with a good Christian?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and you have really not made
Trial enough, to resolve whether it be to or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="43"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would have me see him once
more, to try if I can persuade my self to be
cheated?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's unkind: would I have you to
be cheated! No, far be it from me! but I would
have you leave no Room to blame your self here∣after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You almost perswade me to let him
come to Night; but if he does, I shall be very ill∣natur'd
to him: I question, whether I shall be civil
to him, or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not my Proposal; you may do
it, and be very civil and obliging too, let the thing
take a turn which way it will; and I wish you
would try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think, I will venture then.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE young Lady, having resolved to see
her Gentleman once more, at the Per∣fuasion
of her Sister, there needed no∣thing
to be done, but to sit still till E∣vening,
when he was sure to come. It seems, she
had resolved to send a Footman to him, to tell him
she was gone out of Town for two or three Days,
and so to prevent his coming, till her Father should
tell him in general, that it could not be a Match;
and to make it good, she had ordered her Father's
Coach to be ready to carry her to <HI>Hampstead,</HI> to
an Uncle's House she had there; but on this Oc∣casion
she deferred it, and in the Evening he came,
as usual, to wait on her. It would not perhaps be
possible to set down the Particulars of the Court∣ship
of this Night, there being a great deal of Va∣riety
in it, and no body present but themselves:
But the best Account we have of it being from her
own Mouth; I have set it down, as she related it to
her Sister in the following Dialogue.</P>
<P>As soon as the Gentleman was gone, which, his
Entertainment being not much to his Mind, was
some Hours sooner than usual, she came directly to
her Sister, who was expecting her with the utmost
Impatience, tho' she did not look for her so soon
neither, as she came; the following Dialogue will
give an Idea of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="45"/>
As soon as she came to her Sister, she prevented
her thus:</P>
<P>Well, Sister, you have a nice Guess with you;
'tis all as you said, and the Business is now all done
and over.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, before I enter into Particulars,
are you pleased and satisfied?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly satisfied and pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you pleased, that you have seen
him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thoroughly pleased: I would not but
have seen him again, for any Good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it as you expected?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, just as I expected; a true Gen∣tleman,
perfectly educated, politely bred, that
knows about as much of Religion as a <HI>Parson's Horse;</HI>
that is to say, knows the Way to the Church-Door,
but scorns to debauch his Breeding with such a
clumsey thing as Religion; is more a Gentleman,
than to trouble himself with the Meannesses of
Religion, and not Hypocrite enough to pretend
to the sublimer Parts of it; one that has not been
long enough in this World, to think of the next,
nor is yet come to any Resolution about <HI>when he
shall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for it; I assure you <HI>it is,
not</HI> as I expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is <HI>as I expected</HI> I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but <HI>tho it is,</HI> I believe you are
<HI>not sorry</HI> you met him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, no,</HI> not at all, <HI>I</HI> assure you; I am
much the better satisfied, that: I have now the open
Declarations of it from his own Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me; I thought he had
had more Policy than so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="46"/>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, as I told you, he is no
Hypocrite; he is not ashamed to be believed to be,
full as bad as he is, and made no doubt but I would
like him the better for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's hard another Way; he could
not think you were so, too sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he does not think he does any
thing amiss, I assure you; and takes it ill to be
thought mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can scarce form all this in my Mind;
I wish you would tell me some of the History of
this Night's Salutation, now 'tis so fresh in your
Thoughts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart; but it will be a
long Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ist. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter for that, it will be the
more profitable, and I dare say, not the less di∣verting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, after we had been together about
half an Hour, he seemed to recollect himself, and
<HI>told me,</HI> he ask'd me Pardon, that he had not con∣dol'd
with me for the Loss of my Uncle Sir <HI>James</HI>
—; <HI>I told him,</HI> he need not, for the Loss was
not so great. <HI>He reply'd,</HI> He thought I appear'd
very much concerned at it last Night, which made
him withdraw sooner than he intended. <HI>I told him,</HI>
I was thoughtful indeed, but not so much about
that; for tho' I believed my Aunt was very sorry
for his Death, yet I thought she had no great Rea∣son;
for I was sure she lived a very uncomfortable
Life with him. <HI>He wanted then very much to know,</HI>
what I was so thoughtful about, if I was not
troubled at the Loss of my Uncle; I declin'd tel∣ling
him, but did it in a way, that I intended should
prompt his Curiosity; <HI>for I desired nothing more than
to have a fair Opportunity to tell him very plainly what
troubled me,</HI> and he soon gave it me. <HI>He told me,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="47"/>
He took himself to be so much interested in me
<HI>now,</HI> as to be concerned in all my Griefs; and he
claimed to know, if any thing afflicted me, that he
might bear his Share in it; and added something so
handsome and so obliging on that Head, that I must
acknowledge, it shook my Resolution very much,
and I had almost given over my Design; but I re∣covered
my self again in a Moment or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed you are a resolute Girl: I think
what you repeat of him was very engaging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I told him,</HI> it was natural for People to
make sudden Transitions from other People's Case
to their own, and that indeed that was the Occasi∣on
that made me so uneasy: I knew my Aunt was
a Lady of great Piety and Vertue, that every one
knew to be exceedingly religious and serious;
that on the other hand, Sir <HI>James</HI> was a mad, fro∣licksome,
merry Fellow; that neither understood
any Religion, or troubled himself about it, but
would play a thousand mad Tricks with her, be∣cause
of her strict Observation of religious Things;
and that this gave her a constant Uneasness: He
smil'd, and said, he hop'd I was not afraid of him
on that Score; for, <HI>Madam; says</HI> he, <HI>tho' I pretend
to no Religion my self, I cannot but respect them that do.</HI>
This was the first, and I think a considerable Con∣firmation
of what we had before; <HI>was it not, Sister?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry to hear it; but I'll tell you
however, there was one thing, that I observe to be
a good Foundation for Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> that he re∣spected
them that were religious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sister; but we did not end here:
I told him, I was very sorry to hear him say, <HI>he had
no Religion himself;</HI> because, as perhaps I had not a
great deal, to marry a Man that had none, would
endanger my losing what I had, and I should ra∣ther
<PB N="41" REF="48"/>
have a Husband to help me on towards Hea∣ven,
than to pull me back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he say to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, he did not doubt but I
would go to Heaven without his Help; he said
jestingly, it was a Road he had never travelled; but
I might be assured, he would not willingly pull me
back, if he did not help me on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there was something very ho∣nest
in that too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Sister; but negative Reli∣gion
is a poor Stock to begin on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it's better than a Despiser of Re∣ligion:
you ought to have acknowledged, what
good you found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Designs lay another Way; I aim'd
at a fuller Discovery, and I soon had it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, go on then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, what Tricks my Uncle used
to serve my Aunt; how he got a Book of Devo∣tions
out of her Closet once, and got a long print∣ed
Story about ducking a Scold pasted into it; and
another time got the Ballad of <HI>Chevy Chase</HI> bound
into her Psalm-Book; how when he knew she was
in her Closet at her Devotion, he would bring his
Huntsman to feed the Hounds just under her Win∣dow;
and how one Time he made a Fellow cry
Fire, <HI>and the like;</HI> as you know, Sister, he play'd
many such Pranks and would do any thing to put
her Thoughts into Disorder. <HI>He told me,</HI> tho' he
was but a young Fellow, and had not troubled his
Thoughts much about Religion, (<HI>there was another
Stab to my Affections, Sister,</HI>) yet he said he could not
bear to make a Jest of it neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but that was another word in his
Favour too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="49"/>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I reply'd,</HI> I was very sorry to hear him
own, that <HI>he had not troubled his Thoughts about Reli∣gion,</HI>
and ask'd him upon what Foundation he could
think of setting up a Family, if that was his Case?
He told me, he kept a Chaplain, and jesting told
me, he was devout enough for all the rest of the
House. I grew chagrin and dull; I told him, that
these Things had fill'd me with very sad Thoughts
about marrying, and it look'd very dismal to me;
but all I could say, could not bring him to believe
I was in earnest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe he is really very good hu∣mour'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Ay, Sister,</HI> that's true; but I look for
something farther in a Husband, or I am resolved
I'll have no Husband at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but pray go on with your Story;
what Answer did he make.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He laugh'd at me, and told me, he be∣lieved
marrying would make him mighty religious;
that he would choose a Wife first, and then choose
his Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Man was mad sure to open him∣self
so fully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I appeared then really disturb'd; and
whether he perceived it or no, I am sure the Tears
stood in my Eyes; however I struggled with my
Disorder, and told him I was very sorry then, that
it was his Misfortune to begin with one, that could
not be content to marry upon those Terms; and
hoped, when he was fully satisfied of the Reason
of such a Resolution in me, he would not take it
ill, that <HI>I would stay for him,</HI> till he had resolved
more seriously upon a Thing of so much more Im∣portance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very cunningly answer'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="50"/>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he began to think I was in earnest,
and told me, he hop'd I would not <HI>talk so,</HI> because
it might be longer than he desired to be without
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was still making the Case worse;
or it was as much as to say, he neither had any
Religion, nor intended to have any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not fail to take it so, and <HI>told him,</HI>
the longer he was without me, it might be the
better for him; but the longer he was without Re∣ligion,
I was sure would be the worse for him; <HI>and
that I wonder'd,</HI> how a Man of his Sense could talk
so. <HI>He reply'd,</HI> he had rather talk of any thing
else; for he found this Discourse did not please
me. <HI>I told him,</HI> he mistook me very much; for tho'
I confess'd it did not please me to find him to be
what I hoped he was not, that is, a Person who
pretended to no Religion; yet it pleased me very
well, that he had been so just to himself, as to let
me know it, before any Engagements had pass'd be∣tween
us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I had not known, that my Sister was
never courted before, I should have thought you
had pass'd a great many such Encounters as these.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, 'tis all new to me; but
however I knew the thing was for my Life, and
that I must speak now or never; and I was resolv'd
to put an End to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must own, you were in the right, tho'
I am persuaded I could not have said half so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you han't heard half of it yet; I
made him angry, serious, laugh, and, I think ve∣rily,
once I made him almost cry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry, I interrupted you; pray go
on then: what said he next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="44" REF="51"/>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He said, he wonder'd I could say, that no
Engagements were between us; he said, he was so
engaged to me, as he could never go back. I an∣swer'd,
that as his Engagements were from himself
so they were best known to himself; but that he
knew very well, I was under none to him. He
smil'd then, <HI>and said,</HI> he hop'd I was; I answer'd, I
had not profess'd to be engag'd; I told him, I
would not deny, that I had Respect enough for him
to have gone farther, had not such Difficulties ap∣peared
as I could never get over, and had he been
the Person he was represented; <HI>but that,</HI> as it was
I had too much Respect for my self to ruin my self
with my Eyes open, and too much Respect for
him to keep him in Suspence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would he not take that for being in
earnest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he shewed me then, that he too<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
me to be in earnest, and shewed me, that he was; in
earnest too; for he appeared warm and a little
angry; he told me, he was very sorry to be charged
with deceiving me; and ask'd, if ever he had said
any thing of himself, which was not true? For
<HI>Madam,</HI> says he, <HI>if I am not the Person I appeared to
be, I must have deceived you in something; pray what
sort of a Person did you take me for?</HI> I reply'd <HI>as warn
as he,</HI> that I wonder'd he should mistake me so
much, that I thought he did not do me Justice
that I had said indeed he was not the Person he
<HI>had been</HI> represented, but never said, that <HI>he had re∣presented</HI>
himself one way or other. Then <HI>he begg'd my
Pardon again,</HI> and told me, he had taken me wrong
that whatever came of it, he would never deceive
me; I should know the worst of him, whether I
would have him or no. <HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> said I, <HI>I am per∣suaded
you are no Hypocrite. I understand you,</HI> said he,
<HI>you think, I have used more Honesty than Discretion.
<PB N="45" REF="52"/>
No, Sir,</HI> said I, <HI>I very much approve your Honesty,
and do not blame your Discretion at all. But I do, said
he, for I find, if I could have counterfeited more serious
things than I am Master of, and feigned my self a little
religious, all had been well.</HI> I told him I would not
say, that it was not in his Power to have deceived
me; but I hope he had acted a Part much more
like a Gentleman. <HI>He reply'd,</HI> that it was hard then,
I should make so unkind a Return to him, as to
make him lose his Mistress for his Honesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really, Sister, so it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I thought the best Return
was to treat him with the same Sincerity, and that
was the Reason of the Freedom I took; that as he
told me plainly what he was, I must tell him plain∣ly,
I could not think of engaging with him any
farther, till he had thought a little of those things,
which alone could make it reasonable for him to
think of marrying. He would fain have turned it
off to a Jest, he laugh'd at me, he banter'd me,
he ask'd me how long I would <HI>stay for him?</HI> I told
him I was in no haste, <HI>He ask'd me</HI> how long I
thought I might stay, before I got a Saint to my
Mind, as the World went now? <HI>I told him,</HI> I was
but an ill Judge of Saints, and might be cheated
as <HI>wiser than I had been;</HI> but that, <HI>as I said before,</HI> I
would not fall into the Pit with my Eyes open.
<HI>He told me abruptly,</HI> he wish'd <HI>I had never seen him.</HI>
At that Word, I confess, I was a little alarm'd; how∣ever
I made <HI>no Answer,</HI> but look'd full in his Face;
I saw he was concern'd, and, as I thought, in a
kind of a Passion: When he found I look'd at him,
he repeated the Words thus, <HI>I wish with all my
Heart you had never seen me.</HI> I answer'd nothing.
He added, he wish'd <HI>he had known my Mind sooner.</HI>
I still said nothing. Then he flung himself into
my Arms, and hung about me; <HI>My Dear,</HI> says he,
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
with an inexpressible Tenderness, <HI>why are you silent?
Because,</HI> says I, <HI>I would not give you an Answer</HI> in
kind <HI>to any thing that is disobliging;</HI> he returned, it
was impossible for him to say or do any thing dis∣obliging
to me; that it was true, he wish'd <HI>I had
never seen him,</HI> and that <HI>he had known my Mind sooner;</HI>
but it was, that he might have disguised himself bet∣ter,
and not have lost me for his being so foolish∣ly
honest. <HI>Why,</HI> said I, <HI>would you have endeavoured
to have cheated me? Ay, certainly,</HI> said he, <HI>rather
than lose you; and would have done it effectually too.
Why, what would you have done?</HI> said I, <HI>Done!</HI> re∣ply'd
he, <HI>I would have been the soberest gravest young
Fellow, that ever you saw in your Life. And do you think
your self Hypocrite enough,</HI> said I, <HI>to have concealed your
self effectually. Why not?</HI> said he, <HI>Perhaps you think I
am too much a Fool for it. No, Sir,</HI> said I, <HI>I think you
are too honest for it, and of the two, 'tis much the better
on your side.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was a kind of <HI>Turn</HI> and <HI>Return</HI> be∣tween
<HI>Jest</HI> and <HI>Earnest:</HI> But how did it end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he carried it on thus a long Time,
till he put an odd Case to me, which made me put
a short End to the Discourse: We were speaking
of Fortunes, and the Grandeur of Families; at
last we came to speak of the young Duke of—
<HI>Why now,</HI> says he, <HI>if his Grace should come and court
you</HI> with the <HI>Estate and Grandeur of his Quality,</HI> the
<HI>Title of a Dutchess, &amp;c.</HI> you <HI>would not turn short upon
him as you do upon me, and say, My Lord Duke, pray
what Religion are you of? and yet he has no more Religion
than I.</HI> I told him, I thought he did not treat me
fairly; that it was saying nothing at all, to say I
would not have this Man, or that Man, who ne∣ver
made any Pretesions to me; it was enough to
me, that I would let him know, I would refuse all
the Men in the World, that should ever come to
<PB N="47" REF="54"/>
me, unless I found a Reverence of God, a Sense
of Religion, and a Profession <HI>at least</HI> of the Duty
we all owe to our Maker, had made some Impres∣sions
on them: That I might be deceived indeed
with a Hypocrite, for it was not in me to judge of
the Heart, and as the World was now stated, it was
but too probable I should; but then it should be
my Misery, not my Fault; and that since he
seemed to insinuate, that I did not act in that Af∣fair
with Sincerity; I had no better Specimen of
my Resolution <HI>than this,</HI> that tho' I was very sorry
to treat him so, who, I was satisfied had a Respect
for me; and whose Respect I acknowledged was
not disagreeable, and whose Estate and Proposals
were very much better than I had Reason to expect;
yet that upon this one single Account, I ssured
him, I neither could nor would ever discourse more
with him on this Affair; and hoped he would not
take it ill, that I was forced to be so plain with him,
before I could persuade him I was in earnest; and
having said all this, I offer'd to rise and retire, but
he held me fast in his A ms, and would not let me
stir.</P>

<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cruel Wretch! how could you talk so
to him? how did he look?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look! I confess, Sister, his Looks mov'd
me more, than all the Words he could have said in
half a year, and I shall never forget them; he
seemed strangely affected, and once or twice I saw
Tears in his Eyes; but he turned his Head away
and recover'd himself, and embark'd me in another
Discourse in spight of all I had said. <HI>Hold,</HI> says he,
<HI>you have broke one positive Promise you made me already:</HI>
I told him, I did not remember, that I had ever made
him any Promise at all. <HI>Yes,</HI> says he, <HI>you told me
just now you would stay for me, till I had made a Choice,
in Matters of Religion.</HI> I told him, I had not broke
<PB N="48" REF="55"/>
that Promise yet. Yes, <HI>he said,</HI> I had, in saying
I would never discourse more with him on this Af∣fair.
I reply'd then, that I would except that Cir∣cumstance,
tho' I thought he need not insist on it
for several Reasons: <HI>First,</HI> Because he might find
so many young Ladies abroad, who would not
trouble their Heads to make the Objection I had
done, and that there was no Occasion for him to
turn religious for a Wife. <HI>Secondly,</HI> because there
was no Appearance of his returning upon those
Terms. <HI>He said,</HI> that was more than I knew. <HI>But</HI>
pray Madam, said he, <HI>why do you lay such a mighty
Stress upon this Particular; Religion is an entire Article
by it self; my being religious or not religious need
not obstruct our Affection to one another; I am no Enemy
to Religion.</HI> I answered, that it was indeed an ac∣ceptable
Thing, as Times went now, not to find
Gentlemen Despisers and Haters of Religion, and
of all that favour'd it; but that I was assured, where
there was not a Profession of Religion, and where
God was not acknowledged, there could be no
Blessing expected; and that I should think I had
renounced God, and declared War against Hea∣ven,
if I should marry a Man, that openly acknow∣ledged
he had no Religion. He told me, he was
sorry to see me run things to such an Extremity,
that he did not think I had been in earnest, when
he in jest said, he had not thought of Religion; that
he would not urge me in a Thing, which I laid so
much Stress upon, but would wait on me again,
and hop'd to find me in another Mind, and to let
me know he was not quite so bad, as I thought him
to be. And thus we broke up.</P>

<SP>

<P>What did he go away angry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I cannot say how he was; he
seemed disturbed and uneasy, and went away wil∣linger
than I expected.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="49" REF="56"/>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, and willinger than you desired
too; I can perceive it, Sister, well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I cannot deny, but I have acted
all this by a Force upon my Affection; but I
shoud have been undone: I should never have
had any Peace, or expected any Blessing in the
Match; for as a religious Life is the only Heaven
upon Earth, if it please God to support my Reso∣lution,
I'll never sell the Prospect of it for an E∣state,
or for the most agreeable Person alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>1st. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis nobly resolved, Sister! I hope you
will be supported in so just a Resolution: But do
you think he will come no more?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>3d. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not; but if he does, I resolve
not to see him, if I can avoid it.</P>
</SP>
<P>We must now leave the two Sisters a while, and
follow the young Gentleman a little, for his Story
does not end so; he went away very much con∣cern'd,
<HI>as above,</HI> and particularly it touch'd him
very sensibly, that he should be taken for such a
Creature, that a sober, vertuous Lady, (for such he
was sure his Mistress was) should refuse him meer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
on account of his wicked Character; and that tho'
she acknowledged she had a Respect for him, she
was obliged to shun him, purely because she was
afraid of him, as a Hater of Religion, and there∣fore
dangerous to live with: It had run often in his
Mind, that she had said, she could expect no Bles∣sing
with him; and that if she married him, she
should think she had <HI>renounced God, and declared War
against Heaven;</HI> so that <HI>to be sure I am a dreadful Fel∣low,</HI>
says he, <HI>that she dares not take me, lest she should
appear to be a Confederate with one of God's Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>It then occurr'd to him, that it really was no
otherwise in Fact; that she was in the right in it
all; that he had in truth no Religion, or Sense of
<PB N="50" REF="57"/>
God, upon his Mind, nor had ever entertained
any Notions of Religion in his Thoughts, <HI>and had
told her so himself;</HI> and that therefore the young
Lady was in the right of it, and if she had any
Fund of Religion herself, had a great deal of
Reason to refuse him; that every sober Woman
ought to refuse him on the same Account; and
that she, that did not, was not fit to make him a
Wife, or at least such a Wife as he could expect any
Happiness from; that this young Lady had made
a true Judgment, and it was his Business, not to
think of persuading her to alter her Mind, <HI>which
in short must lessen his Opinion of her,</HI> but to consider
what State and Condition he was in, and what
was his first Business to do, to deliver himself out
of it, before he went to her any more.</P>
<P>He grew uneasie upon this Subject for some time,
and being perfectly ignorant of every thing call'd
<HI>Duty,</HI> having had an Education wholly void of In∣struction,
that Uneasiness increased; and not know∣ing
which way to cast his Thoughts for immediate
Direction, he grew very melancholy and dejected:
He lov'd this young Woman to an Extreme, and
that Affection was infinitely increas'd by her Con∣duct
in this Affairs and by the extraordinary Man∣ner
of her refusing him, But the Reproaches of
his Heart, as being such a Monster, that a Woman,
that even own'd she lov'd him, durst not join her∣self
to him, doubled upon him, as his Affections
for her increased.</P>
<P>He could not think of coming to her again; for
he confess'd the Reasons, which she gave for her
not daring to take him, were so just, and she had
argued them so well, that if she should abate any
thing of them, he should not have so much Esteem
for her as he had before; and yet he saw, that if
she did not, he could never expect to have her;
<PB N="51" REF="58"/>
and yet also he could not bear the Thoughts of
not having her, <HI>for all that.</HI></P>
<P>He liv'd in this uneasy Condition some Months;
his Friends perceiving him to be very melancholy,
tried many Ways to divert him, but none reach'd
his Case, or if they did, they understood not how
to advise him; for his Relations were most like
himself, People of Levity and Gallantry, being
rich and gay; a Family that dealt very little in
Matters of Religion: He had an Aunt, his Mother's
Sister, who seemed very much concerned about it;
but as she thought, all that ailed him was his being
crost in his Affection, she work'd her Thoughts
about, Night and Day to find out a Wife for him,
and so to take his Thoughts off, and turn them a∣nother
way: At length she found out a young
Lady in the City, of a very great Fortune; for she
had near 20000 <HI>l.</HI> to her Portion, and she ply'd it
so warmly with him, that he consented to treat of
it with her Friends, and his Circumstances being
such as few Fortunes would refuse, he found his
Way clear enough, and so went to visit the young
Lady.</P>
<P>It was an odd kind of Courtship you may be
sure, and he went about it accordingly; for, <HI>as
he confess'd afterward,</HI> he resolved, before he saw her,
nor to like her, or any thing she said or did; no,
nor ever to be in earnest with her upon the thing;
only to jest with and banter her, and he told his
Aunt so before hand; however his Aunt would
not take him at his Word, but would have him
wait upon her, and so he did; but he needed not
to have taken up any Resolutions in the Case, for he
was spoiled for Courtship already, at least for most
of the Ladies of the Times; he had no Relish for
any of their Conversation; it was like Musick to
one that had no Ear; all the Gayety and Flutter
<PB N="52" REF="59"/>
about them was lost upon him; his first Mistress
had treated him with such solid Reasoning, such
serious Talk, and had handled him after such a
Manner, that in short nothing but what was seri∣ous
had now any Relish with him; however, <HI>as I
have said,</HI> he resolved to put a Force upon himself
so far, as to go and see what kind of Thing his
new Mistress was, and accordingly he did go <HI>as
above.</HI></P>
<P>Bus when he had been one Evening there, and
had talk'd a little with her, he soon saw he had no
need of making Resolutions; that he was in no
Danger of being insnared by her; the Levity of
her Behaviour, the Emptiness of her Discourse, the
Weakness of her Conduct, made him sick of her
the very first Time; and when he came away, he
said to himself, <HI>Is it possible for any Man in his Senses,</HI>
to bear this Shuttlecock, that had but been one half Hour
with my other Mistress! and away he came, not plea∣sed
at all: However he went again for some time,
till at last, not finding things mend, but rather
grow worse, he was resolved he would talk a lit∣tle
with her about Religion; and as he ask'd her
one Night, <HI>what Religion she was of?</HI> she answered
him just in the very Words that he had banter'd
his other Mistress, O, says she, <HI>I am a mighty good
Christian.</HI> I believe so, <HI>thought he,</HI> just such ano∣ther
as I was, when I was ask'd the same Question,
However he conceal'd his Thoughts, resolv'd to
carry it on a little farther, and gave her a mighty
civil Answer, <HI>I don't doubt that, Madam,</HI> says he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Well,</HI> says she then, <HI>what would you have more?</HI> Nay,
<HI>nothing, Madam,</HI> returned he, <HI>I was only in jest. O,</HI>
says she, <HI>you want to know, what Opinion I am of? you see
I am no</HI> Quaker. <HI>No,</HI> says he, <HI>Madam, I am not concern'd
about your Opinion; you may easily have as much Religion
as I. Nay,</HI> says she, <HI>I han't troubled my Head much
<PB N="53" REF="60"/>
about it; I don't know what I may do, when I keep a
Chaplain.</HI> He had enough of that Discourse, and
so he turn'd it off to something else; for tho' it was
almost the Pattern of what he had done with his
first Mistress, yet it look'd with such a different
Face to him now, that, <HI>as he said afterwards,</HI> it
made his very Blood run cold within him; and
fill'd him with Horror at his own Picture, which,
he thought, now was set before his Eyes in all its
just Deformities. When he came away from her,
he said to himself, <HI>Well, now I see the true Force of
what that dear Creature argued for herself against me;
That to venture upon me, while I declared against Reli∣gion,
was to run herself into the Pit</HI> with her Eyes open,
<HI>and ruin herself by meer premeditated Choice: It would be
just so with me in this Case, if I should marry this But∣terfly,
we should even go hand in hand very lovingly to
the Devil. This will not do my Business!</HI> So he put
an end to that Affair as soon as he could, and re∣solved
to see her no more.</P>
<P>All this while he had no Assistance from either
Books, Friends, Ministers, or any Body, only the
just and natural Reflections of his own Reason: But
he was a Gentleman of polite Manners, and bred
to Conversation with Gentlemen of the best Qua∣lity,
as well as of the best Parts, so the Govern∣ment
of himself was the more easy, and he re∣strained
the Dejection of his Spirits from making
any extraordinary Discovery of it self, only that
he appeared a little more sedate, and more thought∣ful
than before: and was a little more retir'd in his
way of Living; but not so much, but that he came
often into publick Company, as before.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Time, that in promiscuous Con∣versation
at a Chocolate-house near the Court,
this Gentleman and seven or eight more being pre∣sent,
the Company fell from talking of News to
<PB N="54" REF="61"/>
talking of Religion: The Discourse began about
the Differences which had happened in <HI>France</HI> late∣ly,
and were then depending between the Pope
and the <HI>French</HI> Clergy; and of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> or Fa∣culty
of Theology, as they are called there, being
at that Time employed in drawing up a new Sy∣stem
of Divinity, or Body of Doctrine as they call'd
it; and as a Consequence, it was hinted how likely
it was, that such a strict Enquiry made by Men
of Learning and Virtue, into the Fundamentals
of Religion, should lead them at last into Pro∣testant
Principles, and break that whole Kingdom
off from the Errors and Ignorance of Popery, open∣ing
the Eyes of the People to Christian Know∣ledge.
There being some sober and sensible Gen∣tlemen
there, the Discourse was carried on very
gravely and judiciously, and the whole Company
seemed to receive it with Pleasure; when a cou∣ple
of young Beaus, who happened to be in the
Room, beginning to be tir'd with a Thing so much
out of their Way, one of them rises up on a sud∣den,
and says to the other, Come, <HI>Jack,</HI> I am
tir'd of this dull, religious Stuff; prithee let us go,
there's nothing in it: Ay, says t'other, with all
my Heart, I know nothing of the Matter: Come,
will you go to the Opera? There sat another
young Gentleman of their Acquaintance there, and
they pull'd him to come with them; No, says he,
I like this Discourse very well, 'tis worth two O∣pera's
to me: Why, says t'other, how long have
you been <HI>in Orders,</HI> pray? is such Stuff, as that, fit
Conversation for Gentlemen? Yes, says the sober
young Gentleman, I think 'tis; Pray what can
there be in religious Conversation, that is unfit for
a Gentleman? There sat an ancient Nobleman
by, talking with a Clergyman, who hearing the
young Gentleman's Reply, fell a laughing; <HI>for this
<PB N="55" REF="62"/>
Discourse put the former Subject to a Stop.</HI> On my
Word, Gentlemen, says his Lordship, Mr.—
has met with you: I don't think you can answer
his Question. Yes, <HI>My Lord,</HI> says the foolish Beau,
<HI>I think 'tis below a Man of Quality to trouble his Head
about it.</HI> Pray, Sir, says the Lord, is it below a
Man of Quality to be a Christian? O, my Lord,
says the other Beau, bantering and jesting, <HI>we are
mighty good Christians at the Opera;</HI> and turning a∣way
to his Comerade, says he, Come, come, <HI>Jack,</HI>
prithee let's go; so they went both out together,
for they did not care to ingage. Our Gentleman
listned with Pleasure to all this Discourse, till he
heard that Word <HI>mighty good Christians,</HI> and then he
reflected upon his having used that Expression to
his Misress, and how his last Lady gave him the
same Return, and he thought it was so empty, so
absurd a Turn, to a Thing of that Consequence,
that he reproach'd himself with having talk'd so
foolishly, and was asham'd to think, how like one
of these Fops he had appeared to her; and how he
had talk'd after the same senseless Way, which he
now look'd upon to be the most empty, scanda∣lous
Thing in the World.</P>
<P>When the two young Rakes were gone, the
Lord, turning to the young Gentleman that had
refused them, complemented him upon his having
given them so handsom an Answer, and having run
them both a-ground at one Enquiry. <HI>My, Lord,</HI>
said the Gentleman, <HI>if my Question run them a-ground,</HI>
your Lordship's <HI>Question quite confounded them.</HI> In∣deed,
<HI>My Lord,</HI> continued he, <HI>'tis too much the No∣tion</HI>
now, <HI>especially among Persons of Quality, that
'tis below them to be religious.</HI> My Lord said, <HI>It was
so indeed; but that he would fain ask such People, whe∣ther
they thought</HI> St. Paul <HI>was a Gentleman, or no? and
whether he did not shew as much good Breeding and good
<PB N="56" REF="63"/>
Manners, when he appeared before</HI> Agrippa, Festus, <HI>and
the Governor</HI> Sergius Paulus, <HI>as any Nobleman in Bri∣tain
could have done at the Bar of the House of Lords?</HI>
Upon this Subject his Lordship went on for half
an Hour, with a Discourse so handsome, so to the
Purpose, and yet so serious, that it highly enter∣tained
the Company; shewing how it became eve∣ry
Man of Quality to behave himself in Subjection
to the Rules given him by his Maker, as it became
every Subject to honour his Governor; how Piety
and Religion were the Glory of a Man of Quality,
and made Nobility truly illustrious; that it was so far
from being true, that Religion was not suited to
the Life of a Gentleman, that it was certain a Man
could not truly be a Gentleman without it; that
Religion was so far from being a dull flegmatick
Thing, and useless in Conversation, as was the fashi∣onable
Nation of the Town, that really no Man
could be so bright, so perfectly easy, so chearful,
so sociable, and so always in humour for Society
as a <HI>Christian;</HI> that Religion was the Beauty of
Conversation, and assisted to make it pleasant and
agreeable; that without it Company was empty,
Discourse unprofitable, Society unpleasant; and in
short, that Conversation, without a Mixture of
so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thing regarding Religion, and a due Conne∣ction
with it, was like a Dance without Musick, a
Song without Measure; like Poetry without Quan∣tity,
or Speech without Grammar; that it was a
Mistake to think Christianity received Honour
from the Dignity of the Persons who profest it;
and his Lordship said, he wonder'd to hear Men
express themselves so absurdly vain, as to say, such
a Man is <HI>an Honour to Religion;</HI> that the thing was
true only in the Reverse, and it should be said,
Religion is an Honour to such a Person; that it
was a Contradiction in the very Nature of the
<PB N="57" REF="64"/>
Thing, to say, such a Man was noble, great, honour∣able,
or a Gentleman without Religion; and it
might with every jot as much Sense be said so of a
Person who had neither Birth, Family or Manners.</P>
<P>Our Gentleman came home charm'd with this
Discourse, <HI>as indeed the whole Company were besides;</HI>
especially considering the Authority and Dignity
of the Person who spoke it; his Mind was inspir'd
with New Thoughts by it, both of Religion and
of himself; he not only saw more of the Excel∣lency
of Religion in it self, but began to see clear∣ly
it was the Ornament of a Gentleman to be a
Christian: It was with the greatest Contempt,
that he now look'd back upon the Notion he had
formerly espous'd of a Gentleman's being above
troubling himself with serious Things. How for-did
and brutish did the two Beaus appear, <HI>said he,</HI>
compared to that noble and excellent Person my
Lord—? How were they laugh'd at and de∣spis'd
by all the Gentlemen in the Company, and
look'd upon as Fellows fit for nothing, but in the
Highway to Disaster: On the other hand it oc∣curr'd
to him, how handsomly did that young Gen∣tleman
answer them? with what Modesty did he
speak, and yet boldly, in Defence of a religious
Life? and what an Honour was paid him for it, by
all the Company, and by the Nobleman in parti∣cular!
and then to think of what that Lord had
said, with what Applause it was received; how all
the Company listned to his Lordship, as to an
Oracle; how general a Consent was given to it
by all the Gentlemen; and <HI>in a Word,</HI> how agree∣able
the Conversation of the Day was, put it all to∣gether,
and yet, <HI>said he,</HI> of eleven Gentlemen in
the Room, there was not one Man among them,
except the Clergyman, who were not above me
both in Quality and Estate.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="65"/>
From all this he drew this general and happy
Conclusion for himself, <HI>viz.</HI> That he should never
be a complete Gentleman, till he became a religi∣ous
Man; and that the more of a Christian he was,
the sitter he should be for the Conversation of the
best and greatest Men in the Kingdom; and in
consequence of this Resolution he resolved to ap∣ply
himself seriously to the Study of religious
Things.</P>
<P>To avoid the usual Diversions of the Town,
while these serious Thoughts were upon him, he
resolved to retire into the Country, to a little Seat
he had in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> remote from all Conversation,
and where he had no body to talk to, but his own
Servants, or some of the Neighbourhood, who
were all his Tenants. When he found himself so
perfectly alone, it began to be a little too much
for him, and he grew very heavy, and a little hy∣pocondriack;
his Mind was opprest with the
Thoughts of his Circumstances, but dark as to the
due Enquiries he ought to have made, at length
he rouz'd himself a little with these Thoughts.</P>
<P>I talk of being religious! and being a Christian!
Why, I understand nothing of it, or how to go
about it: <HI>What is it?</HI> What is Religion? and what
is it to be a Christian? He pos'd himself with the
Questions, and knew not what Answer to give
himself, when it came thus into his Mind, Did
not that dear first Preacher (<HI>meaning the young Lady
be bad courted</HI>) tell me what Religion was? and
how she understood it, <HI>viz.</HI> a Reverence of God,
a Sense of his Worship, and Impressions of Duty
to him that made us. This certainly is Religion,
and this is to be religious: But which way must I
go about it?</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="66"/>
He was seriously musing on this Part one Even∣ing,
walking all alone in a Field near his House,
when he began to look with great Concern upon
the Want, which he felt, of an early Foundation
laid in his Mind by a religious Education. <HI>Sure,</HI>
said he to himself, <HI>we that are Men of Fortune, are
the most unhappy Part of Mankind; we are</HI> taught
nothing: <HI>our Ancestors have had so little Notion of Reli∣gion
themselves, that they never so much as thought of it
for their Children: I don't wonder they have thought it
below them; for knowing little or nothing of it themselves,
they had no other Excuse to one another for the leaving
their Children intirely destitute of it, but by pretending, it
was below their Quality.</HI> This flung him into a Re∣flection,
which raised this sudden passionate Ex∣pression,
God be merciful to me! What is become
of my Father and Grandfather! He went on then
thus, who am I! a Gentleman! I am attended by
Servants, <HI>sir'd,</HI> and <HI>worship'd,</HI> and <HI>honour'd</HI> here by
a Parcel of poor Workmen and Tenants, that think
themselves nothing to me, and are half frighted if
they do but see me; and I am in the sight of him
that made me, and in my own too, a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Mon∣ster,</HI>
a thousand times worse Creature than the
meanest of them; for I am a Wretch with a Soul,
and yet know nothing of him that gave it me; a
Soul commanded to serve and obey the God that
made it, and yet never taught to know him.</P>
<P><HI>There</HI> lives a poor Ploughman, and <HI>yonder</HI> lives a
poor Farmer, that fare hard, and work hard; How
sober, how religious, how serious are they! How
are they daily teaching and instructing their Chil∣dren!
and how were they taught and instructed by
their Parents! and there's scarce a Boy of ten years
old in their Families, but knows more of God and
Religion than I do: I have been taught nothing,
and know nothing but this, that I am under the
<PB N="60" REF="67"/>
Curse of Darkness in the midst of Light; Igno∣rance
in the midst of Knowledge; and have more
to give an account of, than a Negro of <HI>Africk,</HI> or
a Savage of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>He had wander'd so long in these Meditations,
not minding his Way, that he found Night coming
on, and he scarce knew he was so far from his own
House, till he look'd about him, when he resolv'd
to go back; so he broke off his Thoughts a while,
and made a little haste homeward; in his Way he
necessarily went by a poor labouring Man's Door,
who, with a Wise and four Children, liv'd in a
small Cottage on the Waste, where he (<HI>the Gentle∣man</HI>)
was Lord of the Manor; as he past by, he
thought he heard the Man's Voice, and stepping
up close to the Door, he perceived that the poor
good old Man was praying to God with his Fami∣ly:
<HI>As he said afterwards,</HI> his Heart sprung in his
Breast for Joy at the Occasion, and he listen'd ea∣gerly
to hear what was said: The poor Man was,
it seems, giving God Thanks for his Condition,
and that of his little Family, which he did with
great Affection; repeating how comfortably they
liv'd; how plentifully they were provided for, how
God had distinguish'd them in his Goodness, that
they were alive, when others were snatch'd away
by Diseases and Disasters; in Health, when others
languish'd with Pain and Sickness; had Food, when
others were in Want; at Liberty, when others
were in Prison; were cloathed and cover'd, when
others were naked and without Habitation; con∣cluding
with admiring and adoring the Wonders of
God's Providence and Mercy to them, who had de∣served
nothing.</P>
<P>He was confounded, and <HI>struck</HI> as it were <HI>speech∣less</HI>
at the Surprize of what he had heard: Nothing
could be more affecting to him: he came away,
<PB N="61" REF="68"/>
(<HI>for he had staid as long as his Heart could hold</HI>) and
walk'd to some distance, and there stopt, look'd
up, and round him, <HI>as he said,</HI> to see if he was a∣wake,
or if it was a Dream; at last he got some
Vent to his Thought, and throwing out his Arms,
<HI>Merciful God!</HI> says he, <HI>is this to be a Christian!</HI> what
then have I been all my Days! what is this Man
thus thankful for! Why, my Dogs live better than
he does in some Respects, and is he on his Knees
adoring infinite Goodness for his Enjoyments! why
I have enjoy'd all I have, and never had the least
Sense of God's Goodness to me, or ever once said,
<HI>God I thank thee</HI> for it, in my Life. Well might a
sober Woman be afraid of me: Is this humble Tem∣per,
this Thankfulness for meer Poverty! is this
the Effects of being a Christian! why then Chri∣stians
are the happiest People in the World! Why
I should hang my self, if I was to be reduced to a
Degree a hundred times above him; and yet here
is <HI>Peace,</HI> Ease of Mind, Satisfaction in Circum∣stances,
nay <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> which is the Excess of
human Felicity; and all this in a Man that just
lives one degree above starving: We think our
Farmers poor Slaves, who labour and drudge in the
Earth to support us that are their Landlords, and
who look upon us like their Lords and Masters;
why this poor wretch is but a Drudge to those
Drudges, a Slave of Slaves; and yet he gives God
Thanks for the Happiness of his Condition! is this
the Frame of religious People! what a Monster am
I! Then he walk'd a little way farther, but not
being able to contain his Astonishment, I ll go
back, <HI>says he,</HI> to poor <HI>William;</HI> (for he knew his
Name) he shall teach me to be a Christian; for I
am sure, I know nothing of it yet.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="69"/>
Away he goes back to the poor Man's House, and
standing without, he whistled first, and then call'd
<HI>William! William!</HI> The poor Man, <HI>his Family Worship
being over,</HI> was just going to Supper, but hearing some
body whistle, he thought it might be some Stranger
that had lost his Way, as is often the Case in the
Country, and went to the Door, where he s aw a
Gentleman stand at some distance; but not seeing
him perfectly, because it was dusk, he ask'd, who
it was, but was surpriz'd when he heard his Voice,
and knew who it was.</P>

<P>Indeed that's true, <HI>William:</HI> Alas! we that

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I tell thee, <HI>William,</HI> thy Estate's better than

<P><HI>O Sir,</HI> I hope your Worship is in a better

<P>Look you, <HI>William,</HI> I am very serious with
thee; thou knowest how I have been brought up,
for you remember my Father very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do indeed; he was a good Man to
the Poor; I was the better for him many a Day;
he was a worthy Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>William,</HI> he never took any Care of us,
that were his Children, to teach us any thing of
Religion; and this is my Case, as it is the Case of
too many Gentlemen of Estates; we are the un∣happiest
Creatures in the World, we are taught
nothing, and we know nothing, of Religion, or of
him that made us; 'tis below us, it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis great Pity indeed, <HI>and't please you,</HI> but
I know it is so too often: there's young Sir <HI>Tho,</HI>
—, your Worship's Cousin, he is a pretty
Youth, and may make a fine Gentleman; but tho'
he is but a Child, he has such Words in his Mouth,
and will swear so <HI>already,</HI> it grieves me to hear him
<PB N="67" REF="74"/>
sometimes. It's true, his Father is dead; but sure
if my Lady knew it, she would teach him better;
it's Pity so hopeful a young Gentleman should be
ruin'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>And who do you think spoil'd him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some wicked Children, that they let him
play with, I believe, or some loose Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La,</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, <HI>William,</HI> only his own Father and
Mother; I have heard his Father take him when
he was a Child, and make him speak lewd Words,
and sing immodest Songs, when the poor Child
did not so much as know the Meaning of what he
said, or that the Words were not fit for him to
speak: and you talk of my Lady! why she will
swear and curse as fast as her Coachman; how
should the Child learn any better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will,</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear, that is a dreadful Case indeed!
<HI>and't please you!</HI> then the poor Youth must be ruin'd
of Necessity; there's no Remedy for him, unless
it pleases God to single him out by his distinguish∣ing
invisible Grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why his Case, <HI>William,</HI> is my Case, and
the Case of half the Gentlemen in <HI>England;</HI> what
God may do, as you say, by his invisible Grace, I
know not, nor scarce know what you mean by
that Word; we are from our Infancy given up to
the Devil, almost as directly, as if we were put out
to nurse to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> the Gentle∣men
do not think much of Religion; I fear it was
always so; the Scripture says, <HI>Not many rich, not
many noble, are called;</HI> and <HI>it is the Poor of this World
that are rich in Faith,</HI> James ii. 5.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find it so indeed, <HI>William,</HI> and I find my
felt at a dreadful loss in this very thing; I am con∣vinc'd,
the Happiness of Man does not confist in
the Estate, Pleasures and Enjoyments of Life; if
<PB N="68" REF="75"/>
so, the Poor alone would be miserable, and the
rich Men only be blessed; but there is something
beyond this World, which makes up for all that is
deficient here: This you have, and I have not;
and so, <HI>William;</HI> you in your poor Cottage are
richer, and more happy than I am, with the whole
Manor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, <HI>If in this World only we had
Hope,</HI> the Poor would be <HI>of all Men the most miser∣able;</HI>
blessed be the Lord, that our Portion is not
in this Life. But, Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> I hope you
will not discourage yourself neither; for God has
not chosen the Poor only, rich Men have Tempta∣tions
from the World, and Hindrances very many,
and it is hard for them to enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven; but they <HI>are not shut out,</HI> the Gate is
not barr'd upon them because they are rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not how it is, <HI>William,</HI> nor which
way to begin; but I see so many Obstructions in
the Work, that I doubt I shall never get over it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not say so, I beseech you, Sir, <HI>and't
please you;</HI> the Promise <HI>is made to all;</HI> and if God
has given you a Heart to seek him, he will <HI>meet
you and bless you,</HI> for he has said, <HI>their Hearts shall live
that seek the Lord:</HI> Many great and rich Men have
been good Men; we read of good Kings and good
Princes; and if your Difficulties are great, you
have great Encouragements; for you that are great
Men, have great Opportunities to honour God,
and do good to his Church; poor Men are denied
these Encouragements; we can only sit still and
be patient under the Weight of our Sorrows, and
our Poverty, and look for his Blessing, which alone
<HI>makes rich, and adds no Sorrow to it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But tell me, <HI>William,</HI> what is the first Step
such a poor uneducated Thing as I am should Take?
I see a Beauty in Religion, which I cannot reach;
<PB N="69" REF="76"/>
I see the Happiness which thou enjoyest, <HI>William,</HI>
in an humble, religious, correct Life: I would
give all my Estate to be in thy Condition; I
would labour at the Hedge and the Ditch, as thou
dost, could I have the same Peace within, and be
as thankful, and have such an intire Considence in
God as thou hast; I see the Happiness of it, but
nothing of the Way how to obtain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> you do not know
my Condition; I am a poor disconsolate Creature;
I am sometimes so lost, so dark, so overwhelm'd
with my Condition, and with my Distresses, that I am
tempted to fear God <HI>has forgotten to be gracious;</HI> that
I am cast off, and left to sink under my own Bur∣then:
I am so unworthy, so forgetful of my Duty,
so easily let go my Hold, and cast off my Confi∣dence,
that I fear often I shall despair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you do then, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, I go mourning many a Day,
and waking many a Night; but I bless the Lord, I
always mourn after him; I always cleave to him;
I am not tempted to run from him; I know I am
undone, if I seek Comfort in any other: <HI>Alas!
whither else should I go!</HI> I cry Night and Day, <HI>Return,
return, O Father!</HI> and resolve to lye at his Foot;
and that <HI>if he stay me, yet I will trust in him;</HI> and
blessed be the God of my Hope, he does send
Comfort and Peace, tho' sometimes it is very long.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>William;</HI> and is this a disconsolate
Condition! would you change your Condition
with me that am the <HI>rich Glutton?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O do not say so of your self, <HI>and't please
you;</HI> God has touch'd your Worship's Heart, I per∣ceive,
with an earnest Desire after him; you have
a gracious Promise, that would greatly encourage
you, if you would but take it to your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="77"/>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Encourage me, <HI>William!</HI> that's impossible:
what can encourage me? What Promise is it you
talk of, that looks towards me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>and't please you,</HI> I heard you say, you
would change your Condition with such a poor
Wretch as I; you would labour at the Hedge and
the Ditch, to have the Knowledge of God and
Religion, and to be able to be thankful to him,
and have Confidence in him: This implies, that
you have a <HI>longing earnest Desire after him,</HI> and after
the Knowledge of his Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed that is true, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Then there are many comforting Scrip∣tures,
which speak directly to you, Sir,</HI> viz. Bles∣sed
are they that hunger and thirst after Righteousness, for
they shall be filled: The longing Soul shall be satisfy'd:
<HI>He will</HI> satisfy the Desires of all those that fear him, <HI>and
the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what must I do? which is the Way, an
ignorant Wretch must take?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> the Way is plain: We
must pray to him; Prayer is the first Duty, and
Prayer is the greatest Privilege we can enjoy in the
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>William;</HI> but there is a great deal re∣quired
in Prayer, that I am an utter Stranger to:
I never pray'd in my Life; no, nor I believe my
Father or Grandfather before me, <HI>William!</HI> I came
of a cursed Race, <HI>William,</HI> and I doubt 'tis en∣tail'd
upon the Family like the Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir, do not say that: the Scripture is
plain, <HI>and't please you,</HI> that the Children shall not
be punished for the Father's Transgressions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then certainly they must not tread in
their Fathers Steps, as I do exactly, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true indeed, Sir, they must not
tread in those Steps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="71" REF="78"/>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what dost talk then of Prayer being
the first Duty? Why, if that be the first Thing, I
must not begin; for how can such a Creature as I
pray to God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Spirit of God will assist those, whose
Hearts are towards him, so we must pray, that we
may be taught to pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it not a difficult Thing for a Man to pray
to God, <HI>William,</HI> that scarce ever thought of God
in all his Life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir; but who do you think put those
Thoughts into your Mind, which you now have?
and who open'd your Eyes, Sir, to see a Beauty
in Religion, as now you see? and touch'd your
Heart with such an earnest Desire after the Ways
and Things of God, as you now expresly say you
have? Do you think this is not of God, <HI>and't please
you?</HI></P>

<P>Indeed, <HI>William,</HI> I know not; it would be
a very delightful Thing to me, if I thought it was
so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without Question, Sir, <HI>it is:</HI> Man can
have no such Power; Nature prompts us to evil
Thoughts and evil Desires, and to them only; <HI>the
Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts are evil, and
only evil;</HI> if there are any good Motions, or hea∣venly
Desires in the Heart, they are all from God.
<HI>Every good Giving, and every perfect Gift comes down
from above;</HI> 'tis his Power works them, his invisi∣ble
Grace forms all holy Desires in the Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and what do you infer from thence,
<HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> if God has be∣gun
a good Work, he will perfect it; if he has
turned your Face towards him, he will lift up your
Heart to him: To pray to God is as natural to a
<PB N="72" REF="79"/>
Convert, as to cry after the Father or Mother is
to an Infant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou speakest, <HI>William,</HI> with more Clear∣ness
than ever I heard before; but 'tis a strange
Thing to me to talk of praying to God: I pray!
that, except just the common Road of going to
Church, cannot say that ever I kneel'd down to
pray to God once in all my Life! How shall I
pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's sad indeed, <HI>and't please you!</HI> I am
sorry to hear your Worship say so; Does any Crea∣ture
live and not pray to God! O dear! that's a
sad dreadful Thing in truth! but however, Sir, do
not let that hinder you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>How dost mean hinder me? what can be
said to hinder me doing what I have no knowledge
in, no Notion of, no Inclination to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>O Sir, and't please you,</HI> you mistake your
own Condition very much: Do not discourage
your self thus; you know how to pray, better than
many that make much Noise with their Devotions,
I see it plainly</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray! <HI>William,</HI> I pray! I tell thee, I never
pray'd in my Life, as I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And't please your Worship not to be an∣gry
with me for my plain Way—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, <HI>William,</HI> be plain, and speak free∣lly
; don't <HI>worship me</HI> and <HI>sir me</HI> now; talk to me, as
it I were your Neighbour or Comerade; these are
not Things to be talk'd of with C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inges and Bows:
I am a wretched, contemptible, poor, rich Man,
thou are a poor, rich, happy Christian; talk plain∣ly
the courser the better, I like it best; there will
be no Difference, <HI>William,</HI> between thee and I
hereafter, but what will be on thy side; tell me
therefore, what you mean, <HI>William,</HI> by my Praying?</P>
</SP>
<PB N="73" REF="80"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if you allow me to be plain
then, I say, you mistake your own Condition, and
thereby put off the Comfort you might receive;
I say, you do pray, and know better how to pray,
than many that appear as if they pray'd every
Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must explain your self, <HI>William,</HI> I do
not understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, those earnest Desires you have
after the Knowledge of God, and after the true
Worship of God, <HI>which is the Sum of Religion,</HI> I say,
those earneft Desires are really Prayers in their
own Nature; sincere Wishes of the Heart for Grace
are Prayers to God for Grace; Prayer it self is no∣thing
but those Wishes and Desires put into Words,
and the first is the essential Part; for there may
be Words used without the Desire, and that is not
Prayer, but a Mockery of God; but the Desires
of the Heart may be Prayers even without the
Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me a little, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> those earnest
Desires you have after Religion, and after the Know∣ledge
of God, will force you to pray first or last,
even in a verbal Prayer; they will break out like
a Flame that cannot be withheld; your Heart will
pray when you know not of it: Praying to God,
Sir, is the first Thing a Sense of Religion dictates,
as a Child cries as soon as it is born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! <HI>William,</HI> I know nothing of it; I am
such an unaccountable Wretch, God knows, I
know nothing what belongs to praying, not I;
thou fast let me see farther into it, bythat thou saidst
just now, than ever I saw or heard before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look ye, now, <HI>and't please you,</HI> I
told you it would break out, when you knew not
<PB N="74" REF="81"/>
of it, and you would pray to God besore you
were aware: Did you not pray just now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Pray!</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what did I say? I said, I know
nothing of Prayer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that was not all: What is the Mean∣ing
of those Words, <HI>Alas, William!</HI> and whence
came that <HI>Sigh,</HI> when you called your self that hard
Name? and what was the Sense of your Soul but
this, <HI>God be merciful to me, and teach me to pray; for
alas I know nothing what belongs to praying:</HI> Was not
all this praying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>William,</HI> my Heart had such a kind
of Meaning; but I cannot form the Thought into
Words, no not in my very Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's all one, Sir: God that moves the
Soul, certainly hears his own Motion; how should
he but hear it? is it not his own working! <HI>The
Preparation of the Heart, and the Answer of the Tongue,
is of the Lord:</HI> He will hear every sincere Desire,
which he forms in your Soul, whether it be con∣ceived
into Words or no; for it is the Voice of his
own Spirit and Grace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a comforting Preacher, <HI>William;</HI>
I don't wonder you enjoy such a shining Beam of
Light in your own Soul, when you have such a
Sense of Things as this; you shall be my Instru∣ctor,
<HI>William,</HI> I may call you Father rather; for
thou art better to me than ten Fathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> my Discomforts are
very great, and the Beam you speak of is very dim
in me; <HI>do not speak such Things of me;</HI> it makes me
very sad; for I know my own Darkness, I am a
poor despis'd Creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but God may make you an Instru∣ment
of Good to me, or to any one he please: I
never had thus much Instruction in my Life, <HI>Wil∣liam;</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="82"/>
you will not be backward to do good, I
hope, if it be thus cast in your Way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very glad, if such a Worm, as I
am, should be an Instrument in God's Hand to
comfort or inform your Worship, and shall praise
God for this Occasion, as long as I live; and indeed
I rejoyce, <HI>and't please you,</HI> to see your Worship in∣quiring
after these Things; I pray God increase
the Knowledge of himself in your Mind, and
comfort you with the Hope of his Presence and
Blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La. Amen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look you now, Sir, <HI>and't please you,</HI> did
you not pray then again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I joyn'd with you, <HI>William;</HI> I don't know;
but if that be praying, I think I did pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus God will move your Heart to pray
to him: and I beseech your Worship to read the
Scriptures; read them much, read them seriously,
and pray, Sir, observe this one Thing, when you
read, which I have experienc'd often, and very
comfortably; and I dare say, you and every one
that reads the Word of God, with desire of a Bles∣sing,
will experience the like, <HI>viz.</HI> When you are
reading, and come to any Place that touches you,
and that your Mind is affected with, <HI>you shall find</HI>
even whether you will or no, your Heart will eve∣ry
now and then lift it self up thus, <HI>Lord! make
good this Word to me! Lord! draw my Heart thus to thee!
Lord! help me thus to seek thee,</HI> and the like; and be
not afraid to call that Praying; for <HI>mental Petition</HI>
is Prayer as well as Words; and is, perhaps the
best mov'd Prayer, and the best exprest in the
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="76" REF="83"/>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will persuade me, <HI>William,</HI> that I both
have pray'd already, and shall again, whether I
will or no, and whether I know any thing of it or
no, and that I want no teaching.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Sir, does a Child want to be taught
to cry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will that Simile hold, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed it will, Sir: Read the Scripture; if
God's Word reaches your Heart, you will not need
to be taught to pray</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you, <HI>William,</HI> you hardly knew who
you were talking to: You talk of my <HI>reading the
Scripture;</HI> why, I'll tell thee, <HI>William,</HI> I han't a
Bible in the World, and never had one in my Life:
There's the Manor-house yonder; I question whe∣ther
God was ever pray'd to in it, or his Name
mention'd there, except prophanely, or perhaps
to swear by it, since 'twas built: why you know
as well as I, what a Family it was that liv'd in it,
when my Father purchased it; they were as much
Strangers to Religion, <HI>William,</HI> as thou art to
<HI>Greek.</HI> and <HI>Hebrew;</HI> and ours were but little better,
that came after them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, indeed, <HI>and't please your Worship,</HI> it
was so: Poor Gentlemen! they liv'd badly indeed;
very badly: Alas! Gentlemen must not be told
of it by us poor Men; but they were a sad wicked
Family, I remember it well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>William,</HI> thou can'st lend me a Bible
canst thou not? and I'll read it all over while I
stay here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and't please your Worship, I'll lend
you a Bible; I'll bring it in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, <HI>William,</HI> and come and stay with me
to Morrow; I'll make thee amends for thy Day's
<PB N="77" REF="84"/>
Work, and there's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He gives him some Money, and sends him back again.</NOTE> something for thy good Ad∣vice,
and coming so far with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank your Worship.</P>
<P>They were now come to the Manor-house, and
he was loth to detain him, because it was late, and
because he was so affected with the Discourse they
had had, that he wanted very much to be alone
again.</P>
<P>As soon as he came into his own House, he lock'd
himself into a Parlour, and began to consider with
great Seriousness all these Things, and especially
what the poor Man had said to him about praying
to God; and as his Thoughts were intent upon the
Meaning of Prayer, the Nature of it, and the Ad∣vantages
of it, at every Turn of these Thoughts
he found a secret kind of Hint like a Voice <HI>in him,</HI>
not a Voice <HI>to him,</HI> O that I could pray! O if I
could but pray as that poor Man does! How hap∣py
should I be, if I could but pray to God! and the
like: He was not aware of these Movements; they
seemed to be w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought in his Affections perfectly
involuntary and sudden; and they pass'd over with∣out
being notie'd or observ'd, even by himself, till
after a good while they returned stronger and more
frequent upon him, so that he not only perceived
it, but remembred how often his Heart had thrown
out those Expressions; when on a sudden the poor
Man's Words came into his Mind with such a
Force, as if the Man himself had been there; <HI>why
this was praying;</HI> certainly I have been praying all
this while, and knew it not.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="85"/>
Upon this Reflection, it was impossible for him
to express, <HI>as be said afterwards,</HI> what a strange
Rapture of Joy possess'd his Mind, and how his
Heart was turn'd within him; then he fell into the
same secret Ejaculations of another Kind, <HI>viz.</HI> of
Admiration, Praises, Thanksgiving, and meer A∣stonishment;
but still without speaking, otherwise
than a kind of mental Voice, sounding or inject∣ing
Words into his Mind such as these, Lord! shall
I be brought to pray to God! I that have never
been told so much as how to mention his Name!
I that have never known any thing of God, or my
self! or have been taught any thing of my Duty
to him! shall I be taught to pray! and taught by
who! by this poor despicable Creature, that, at
another time, I would not have spoken to, if he
had made me twentyBows and Scrapes! HisTongue
then was let loose, and he cry'd out, <HI>Blessed be God
that ever I came near that poor Man.</HI></P>
<P>He continued all that Evening filled with com∣forting
Reflections, and with a kind of inward
Peace and Satissaction; which, as he had never
known before, so he knew not how to describe or
relate it, or indeed how to manage it: In the Morning
he found the same Meditation and the same Light∣ness
upon his Spirits return'd, and he remembred
what the poor Man had pray'd for, for him, <HI>viz.</HI>
That he might be comforted with the Hopes of the
Presence and Blessing of God, to which his Heart
had so readily said <HI>Amen:</HI> and now he long'd for
the poor Man coming with the Bible.</P>
<P>The poor Man's was likewise mightily affected
with his Case, considering him a young Gentleman
of such a Family and Fortune; and who was so far
above him, as that, tho' he was his Landlord, he
durst never offer to speak to him in his Life, but
with the greatest Submission and Distance; how he
<PB N="79" REF="86"/>
should come to call him out, and to talk to him,
<HI>of such Things especially,</HI> and in so serious a Manner.</P>
<P>He then reflected with a serious Joy, that this
young Gentleman should be thus touch'd with a
solid Sense of Religion and good Things, <HI>for it
was easy to see, that it was not a slight or an insincere
Work upon his Mind;</HI> it rejoyc'd his Heart, that the
Heir of the Estate should be thus likely to prove a
good Man;and it presently occurr'd to his Thoughts
how great a Blessing such a Gentleman might be
to the County, to the Poor, and to the uninstru∣cted
People round him; as well by reforming their
Manners, and restraining their Vices, as perhaps by
bringing Religion to be accepted and received a∣mong
them by his Example.</P>
<P>These were some of the Thoughts he came along
with, and he pray<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to God, as he walk'd, very ear∣nestly,
that he might be made an Insrument to
bring the Soul of this Gentleman to the Know∣ledge
of God, and to bow at the Footstool of his
Redeemer as a true Penitent.</P>
<P>His Prayers were not in vain: Prayer put up
from such a Principle, and with such a Spirit, sel∣dom
is made in vain</P>
<P>He came to the Gentleman, while he was in Bed;
for he had given order to his Servants to bring him
up to his Chamber; there he deliver'd him the Bi∣ble,
and told him he hop'd he would find in it both
Encouragement and Direction in the great Work
which he was going about, and that God would
bless it to him, and would supply by his Grace all
the Wants of early Instruction, which he had so
much complain'd of.</P>
<P>He received the poor Man with a glad Heart,
made him sit down by him, and told him, God
had made him the Instrument of so much Good to
<PB N="80" REF="87"/>
him, that he could not part with him any more
while he staid in the Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William,</SPEAKER>
<P>says he, God has made you a Father to
me, and I'll be a Father to you and your Family;

God for than Bread and Water.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>And't please your Worship,</HI> I have much more
to be thankful for than that already; but if God

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your Worship mend my Condition, I
fear my Thankfulness to God should abate: when
I liv'd so near Misery and Distress, it made me
more sensible of God's Goodness, in keeping me
out of it, than I may, I doubt, when I am full.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think you will ever be unthankful,
<HI>William,</HI> that could be so full of a Sense of God's
Mercy, even in the extremest Poverty: But, <HI>come
William,</HI> I shall leave that; I have order'd my Stew∣ard

<P>Alas! I am a sorry Creature to be a Teach∣er,

</SP>

<P>here's a Text, which tells
you, what is the whole Design of a written Gos∣pel;
for what End the Life of our blessed Redeem∣er
was laid down, and his Works and Doctrine
were published to the World; and this seems to be
the first Thing we should know of the Scriptures:
For indeed it is the Sum and Substance of them.</P>

<P>Let me fee it, <HI>William.</HI></P>

<P>Here it is, Sir: <HI>These Things are written, that

<SP>

<P>That is very comprehensive indeed, <HI>William.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And here is another Passage I folded down,
lest you should ask, how you should do to believe,
it is in <HI>Mark</HI> ix. 2. 4. it is a Story of a Man, who
brings his Child to our Lord to be healed, when
possess'd of an evil Spirit: Our Lord asks him, if he
could believe: <HI>If thou canst believe, all things are
possible to him that believeth:</HI> and <HI>v. 24. The Father
cried out with Tears, Lord, I believe, help thou my Un∣belief.</HI></P>

<P>What do you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">William looks full in his Face, while he repeated the Words.</NOTE>
look at me for, <HI>William?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! I saw your very Heart; I know
you pray'd; I know you said <HI>Amen</HI> in your very
Soul to that Word: Glory be to the Grace of God,
and to the Word of God for you; the Scripture,
read with such a Heart as yours now is, will soon
<PB N="83" REF="90"/>
teach you all that you want to know, and all that
you want to do.</P>
<P>The poor Gentleman was overcome with his
Words, and could not speak for a good while;
Tears came out of his Eyes, and at last he burst
out thus; Lord! what a Creature have I been, that
have liv'd without the Teachings of the Scripture
all my Days!</P>
<P>Thus far this happy poor Man was made an In∣strument
to the restoring this Gentleman, and bring∣ing
him to the Knowledge of God, and to a Sense
of Religion; and in a word, to be a most sincere
Christian. We shall hear farther of him, after the

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E must now go back to the Family, which
we began with: The Father of the
young Ladies was gone into the Coun∣try
to visit his Sister, who was newly
become a Widow; little thinking whatever his
eldest Daughter had said to him, that his youngest
Daughter would make such short Work with her
Lover in his Absence; and that she would quite
put an end to his Courtship all at one Blow, as she
had done, before he came Home again:</P>
<P>He spent some little Time at his Sister's, to com∣fort
her, and assist her in her Affairs, after the
Lofs of' her, Husband; and particularly because her
eldest Son being of Age, and just upon marrying,
she intended to remove; the House which was the
Seat of the Family being to be sitted up for her
new <HI>Daughter in Law:</HI> Upon these Circumstances
he began the following Discourse with his Sister.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray Sister, what kind of a Lady has
my Nephew got? is he well marry'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Brother, I can hardly tell, how to
answer you that Question; I believe every body
will be better pleas'd than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sister, what is the Case, pray; that
you are so difficult?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="92"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist</SPEAKER>
<P>O Brother! the main Difficulty, that has
made me all my Days the most miserable of all
Women.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Religion I warrant you; you would
have had him have marry'd a Nun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't know why I should desire a
religious Woman to come into the Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw the like of you, <HI>Sister,</HI> you are
always a complaining; you have had one of the
best humour'd, goodest condition'd, merriest Fel∣lows
in the World for this five and twenty Years,
and yet you call your self a <HI>Miserable</HI> Woman: what
could you ask in a Husband, that you had not in
Sir <HI>James?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Brother, is this a Time for me to tell
you what I wanted in Sir <HI>James,</HI> when he is in his
Grave? I have wanted nothing in him, that a Wo∣man
could desire in a Husband; he was rich in his
Estate, a lovely, compleat, handsome Gentleman
in his Person, and held it to the last; he was the
best-humour'd Man, that ever Woman had, and kind
<HI>as a Husband</HI> to the last degree; I never saw him in
a Passion in my Life; he was a Man of good Sense
and good Learning; a Man of Honour, good
Breeding, and good Manners; none went beyond
him; all the Country knows it, and lov'd him for
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro. Very well;</SPEAKER>
<P>and yet my Sister a miserable
Woman! would not any Man laugh at you? I
think, Sister, if ever you were a <HI>miserable Woman,</HI>
it is now; because you have lost him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that's true too; I am so now, many
Ways, and some perhaps that you do not think of,
Brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you mean again; I warrant
you ha' been whining over him, to think what is
become of him now: Prithee what's that to you,
<PB N="86" REF="93"/>
or I? what can you by your Concern for him, do
in this Case, one way or other? can't you leave
him to God's Mercy, now he's gone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Brother, it is in vain to answer you;
I must leave him to God's Mercy, and so we must
leave our selves; but do you think, 'tis not an af∣flicting
dreadful Thing to me, that know how he
liv'd, and how he dy'd, to reflect upon his Condi∣tion,
if I had any Love for him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how did he live? he liv'd like a Gen∣tleman,
as he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; and that, as Times go, <HI>Bro∣ther,</HI>
is to live like a Heathen; you know well e∣nough,
what a Life I have had with him on that
only Account; you know, he was so far from hav∣ing
any Sense of Religion, or of his Maker, on
his Mind, that he made a Jest and a Mock of it all
his Days, even to the last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know he did not trouble himself much
about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he not only did not himself, but he
did not really love to have any body about him
religious: I have known many Gentlemen that
have had no Religion themselves, yet value it in
others, and value and reverence good Men; but
he thought all People Hypocrites, that talk'd of any
thing religious; and could not abide to see any
Appearance of it in the House; it was the only
Thing we had any Difference about, all our Days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I think you were a great Fool to have
any Difference with him about that: Could not
you ha' kept your Religion to your self, and have
let him alone to be as merry and as frolicksome as
he would without it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I was oblig'd to do that, you may be
sure; you know it well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="94"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I know he serv'd you many a
merry Prank about your religious doings, such as
putting every now and then a Ballad in your Pray∣er
Book, or your Psalm Book; and I think he put
the Story of <HI>Tom. Thumb</HI> once in one of Dr. <HI>Tillot∣son</HI>'s
Sermons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; 'twas two Leaves out of <HI>Don Quixot:</HI>
He did a great many such things as those to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they were all Frolicks, there was no∣thing
of Passon or ill Nature in them: Did not
he write something in the Children's <HI>Spelling-Book</HI>
once, and make them get it without Book instead
of the Lesson you had set them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, he play'd me thousand Tricks
that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, once he pasted a Receipt to make a
Tanzy or a Cake, just next to one of the Questi∣ons
of the Catechism, where your Daughter's Les∣son
was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; and every now and then he would
paste a single printed Word, that he cut out of
some other Book, just over another Word in their
Books, so cunningly, that they could not perceive
it, and make them read Nonsense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what Harm was there in all that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it shewed his general Contempt of
good Things, and making a Mock of them; other∣wise
the thing was not of so much Value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and wherein was you miserable, pray,
in all this? I don't understand you in that at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why in this, that he was not at all a religi∣ous
Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what was that to you still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first, Brother, there was all <HI>Family-Religion</HI>
lost at one Blow; there could not be so
much as the Appearance of worshiping or ac∣knowledging
the God that made us; nay, we
<PB N="88" REF="95"/>
scarce ask'd him leave to eat our Meat, but in se∣cret,
as if we were asham'd of it; Sir <HI>James</HI> never
so much as said Grace or gave Thanks at Table in
his Life, that I remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And they that do, make it nothing but a
Ceremony, and do it for Fashion-sake not that
they think it signifies any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let them do it for Fashion-sake then,
if they will, but let them do it; 'tis the most ra∣tional
Thing in the World, while we own that
God gives us our Meat, that we should ask him
Leave to eat it; and thank him for it when we have
done: But alas! this is but a small Part of the ill
Consequences of an irreligious Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what more is there? for this is no∣thing,
but what is in thousands of Families, who
pretend to Religion on all sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, all <HI>Relative Religion</HI> was lost too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro. Relative Religion!</SPEAKER>
<P>Sister, what do you mean
by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>First,</HI> mean by it, that Religion which
ought to be between a Man and his Wise; such as
comforting, encouraging, and directing one ano∣ther,
helping one another on in the Way to Hea∣ven,
assisting one another in Christian Duties,
praying with and for one another, and much more
which I could name; and which, without doubt,
passes to their mutual Comfort and Delight be∣tween
a Man and his Wife, where they are mutu∣ally
agreed in worshiping and serving God, and
walking on in the happy Course of a religious Life:
All this has been lost, and it has been a sad Loss to
me, Brother; we have all need of Helps, and it
is not every one that considers, or indeed that
knows, what Help, what Comfort, what Sup∣port,
a religious Husband and Wife are or may be
<PB N="89" REF="96"/>
to one another; this, I say, has been a sad Loss to
me I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are nice Things; but methinks if
you could not have those Helps from your Hus∣band,
you might find them in other Things, such
as Books, Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it need not be call'd such
a Loss neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis such a Loss, Brother, that if I were to
live my Days over again, I would not marry a
Man that made no Profession of Religion; no,
tho' he had ten thousand Pounds a year; and I had
but a hundred Pound to my Portion; nay, I think
I would work for my Bread rather.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay a mighty Stress upon these Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Body, Brother, that has any Sense
of the Blessing of a religious Family, must do so;
Pray, if the honouring and serving God be our Wis∣dorn,
our Duty, our Felicity, in this World, and
our way to the next, what Comfort, what Hap∣piness
can there be, where these are wanting in the
Head of the Family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better to be sure, where they may be
had, but to lay all the Happiness of Life upon it,
as if a Man or a Woman could not be religious by
themselves, without they were both so together,
I do not see that; I think you carry it too far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll convince you, that I do not carry it too
far at all; I do not say, a Man or Woman may not
be religious by themselves, tho' the Husband or
Wife be not so; but I say, all the Help and Com∣fort
of <HI>Relative Religion</HI> is lost; the Benefit and
Value of which none knows, but they that enjoy
it, or feel the Want of it; but there is another
Loss, which I have not nam'd, and which my
Heart bleeds in the Sense of, every Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that I wonder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="90" REF="97"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Children! Brother, Children! you
see I have five Children: what dreadful Work has
this want of <HI>Family-Religion</HI> made among my poor
Children!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir <HI>James</HI> did not hinder you instru∣cting
your Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not? 'tis true he did not, when they
were little; but has he not by Example and want
of Restraint encouraged all manner of Levity,
Vanity, Folly, nay, and even Vice it self in them?
Do you think Children, thus let loose to humour
their young Inclinations, and to the full swing of
their Pleasures, would not soon snatch themselves
out of the Arms of their Mother, and deliver
themselves from the Importunities of one that had
no other Authority with them than that of Affe∣ction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly there is something in that; but
I do not see, that your Children are much the
worse; there's your eldest Son, Sir <HI>James</HI> that is
now, he is a pretty young Gentleman, I hear a ve∣ry
good Character of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Brother, as Times go now with
Gentlemen, we may be thankful, neither he nor his
Brother are debauch'd or vicious; and I am thank∣ful
for it; they have good Characters for mo∣dest
pretty Gentlemen, as you say; but still, Bro∣ther,
the main Thing is wanting; I cannot be
partial to them, tho' they are my own; there is
not the least Sense or Notion of Religion in them;
they cannot say they have no Knowledge of it, I
took Care to deprive them of that Excuse, as ear∣ly
as they knew any thing: But it goes no Father;
my eldest Son will tell me sometimes, he has
as much Religion as a Gentleman of a Thousand
a Year should have; and his Brother tells me, if I
would have had him have any Religion, I should
<PB N="91" REF="98"/>
have kept our Parish Living for him, and bred him
a Parson.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are very merry with you then, I find,
upon that Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a dreadful Jest to me, Brother; I am
far from taking it merrily; you know, I was other∣wise
brought up, our Father and Mother were of an∣other
sort of People; they united their very Souls
in the Work of God, they joyn'd in every good
Thing with the utmost Affection; they lov'd the
Souls as well as the Bodies of us their Children;
the Family was a House of chearful Devotion;
God was serv'd Night and Day; and, <HI>in a Word,</HI>
as they liv'd, so they dy'd; they dropt comfort∣ably
off, and went, as it were, Hand in Hand to
Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet, Sister, you see, we that were
their Children were not all alike; there's our
Brother <HI>Jack,</HI> and our Sisters <HI>Sarah,</HI> and <HI>Betty</HI> what
can be said about them? Pray what Religion are
they of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you, what can be said, and what
will stick close to them one time or other, <HI>viz.</HI> If
they are lost, it is not for want of good Instruction,
or good Example; they cannot blame Father or
Mother; it has been all their own; Parents may
beg Grace for their Children, but they cannot give
it them; they may teach their Children good things,
but they cannot make them learn; that is the Work
of God, and Parents must submit it to him; but
when Parents do nothing; nay, rather by Exam∣ple
and Encouragement, lead their Children into
Wickedness; what a dreadful thing is that!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but our two Sisters were not led into
Wickedness; and yet, as I said, they value Religi∣on
as little as any Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="92" REF="99"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Brother, I can tell you, how my Sisters
were both ruin'd; for they were not so educated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by ruin'd? they are not
ruin'd, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I mean as to their Principles, Brother, which
I think is the worst sort of Ruin; they were ruin'd
by marrying profligate irreligious Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know, what you mean by profligate,
I think they are both very well marry'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, as you call well marry'd, and that I
call being undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray what has ruin'd <HI>Jack?</HI> for he's as
graceless a Wretch almost, as your Sir <HI>James</HI> was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Brother, just the other Extreme, he
has a wild, giddy, Playhouse-bred Wife; full of Wit,
and void of Grace, that never had any Religion,
nor knew what the Meaning of it was; <HI>this has
ruin'd him:</HI> My Brother was sober, well taught,
well inclin'd young Man, as could be desired, but
getting such a Tempter at his Elbow, instead of a
Wife to help him on to Heaven, she has led him
hood-wink'd to the Gates of Hell, and goes chear∣fully
along with him; a sad Instance, Brother, of
the Want of Family Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what's all this so what we are
upon, of Parents leading their Children into Wic∣kedness?
he was not led so by his Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you see his Children are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say that; few Parents, tho' they
are bad themselves, will prompt their Children to
be so too: that's what I have seldom seen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that has been the Case of my Fami∣ly;
and that it is, that has broke my Heart, and
gives me Cause to say, I have been the most mise∣rable
Woman alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have this Comfort still, that you
have not been the Occasion of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="93" REF="100"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; but even that does not lessers
the Gries of seeing my Children lost, and ruin'd
before my Face, and their own Father be the In∣strument to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>They cannot be said to be ruin'd; they are
very fine Gentlemen, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are ruin'd as to the best Qualification
of a Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I warrant you, they do not think so, Sister:
Religion makes us good Christians, that is confest,
but I do not see it makes a Gentleman; what is
more frequent, than to see Religion make Men
cynical, and sour in their Tempers, morose and
surly in their Conversation; they think themselves
above the Practice of good Manners or good Hu∣mour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all by the Mistake of the Thing;
'tis want of Religion, that makes Men thus; it is
in good Breeding, as it is in Philosophy; a little
Philsophy, a little Learning makes a Man an A∣theist,
a great deal brings him back, and makes him
a Christian; so a little Religion makes a Man a
Churl, but a great deal teaches him to know him∣self,
and be a Gentleman; when good Principles
joyn with good Manners, how should they but il∣lustrate
the Education, and set off the Breeding
of a Man of Quality; as it's a Mistake to say, that
Jewels should be worn by none but homely Women,
it is just the contrary; so Religion adorns Edu∣cation,
as Jewels give real Beauty a double Lustre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Notions are delicate; you are very
nice, it seems, in these Things, Sister; tho' I must
confess, I am of your Mind, when I consider it
well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let the Scripture be Judge, whether the
Rules of Life dictated by the Apostles to the Chri∣stian
Churches were not such, as not only agree
<PB N="94" REF="101"/>
well with that of a Gentleman, but indeed with
that, without which no Man can be a Gentleman;
if you look almost through all the Epistles in the
New Testament, you will find it so; I'll name you
a few.</P>
</SP>
<BIBL>Phil. i. 9, 10.</BIBL>

I could name you many other: will any Man
that reads these Rules say, they are not suitable to a
Gentleman? No, Brother, it shall ever be a Rule
to me, that the only complete Man upon Earth is
a religious Gentleman.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are wrapt up in these Notions,
Sister; I fancy you have been documenting my
Daughter; I am afraid on't, I assure you; she has
got just the same things in her Noddle, and she
has carried her Scruples to such a length, that she
had like to have refused the best Match, that ever
will be offer'd her, as long as she lives; but I believe
I rattled her out of it, when I came away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am perhaps the fuller of it, because it has
been the Ruin of my Family, and of my Children,
and I think if ever poor Woman was unhappy with
a Gentleman, that had not one had Quality in him,
it was I; Sir <HI>James,</HI> as I told you, was such a Man
for every thing else, as there are few such in the
World; but he hated Religion, and that has <HI>ruin'd
us all.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would make any one laugh to hear you
talk of being <HI>ruin'd:</HI> why are you not left happy,
easy, pleasant? is not your eldest Son a Baronet,
and has 1400<HI>l.</HI> a year? is not your second Son very
well provided for? have not your Daughters 5000<HI>l.</HI>
a-piece Fortune left them? and are not you left so
rich, you know not what to do with it all!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not speak of Ruin, as you understand
it, Brother; I think a Family without Religion is
a Family ruin'd, and that in the worst Sense, that
Ruin can be understood in; if I were to marry
again, I would not marry the best Duke in the Na∣tion,
that would not endeavour to carry me to Hea∣ven,
and to go there himself; The Command of
the Scripture is plain in it, <HI>Be not unequally yoked,
2 Cor,</HI> vi. 14. How shall a Husband, that professes
<PB N="96" REF="103"/>
no Religion, dwell with a Wife <HI>according to Know∣ledge?</HI>
I Pet. iii. 7. and what is the Reason the A∣postle
gives for this Christian Rule in marrying
but this? <HI>That your Prayers be not hindred?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Sir <HI>James</HI> did not hinder your Prayers,
Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he not? Sir <HI>James</HI> is in his Grave, and
'tis not my Part to say what he did; but 'tis the
mutual Prayers of Husband and Wife together, that's
meant in that Scripture: Do you think Sir <HI>James</HI>
ever pray'd with his Wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I believe he did not indeed, nor with
any body else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you think, that's the Life of a Chri∣stian,
or the Manner of a Christian Family, Bro∣ther?
you and I were not bred up so, and yet our
Father was a Gentleman, and wanted neither Fa∣mily
nor Fortune equal to any of them: Sir <HI>James</HI>
is in his Grave, and I have no more to say of that;
but if I were as young, as I was when I marry'd
him, and were to choose again, I would not marry
the best Nobleman in the Nation, if he was not a
religious Man; all Enjoyments in the World are
nothing without it, unless I resolved to cast off all
Religion too, and where would that end!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is just my Daughter again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, Brother, consider another thing:
how many young Women and young Men too,
who have been religiously bred, has this way of
marrying been a Snare to? that when they come
to husbands with no Religion, or to giddy, loose,
profane Wifes, they drop all their own Principles,
and become empty of all Religion too at last: you
know, how it has been with our Brothers and Sisters,
as I hinted to you before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="97" REF="104"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no arguing with you, <HI>Sister,</HI> who
have had so much Experience of it: but I tell my
Daughter, that perhaps she may convert her Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know my Niece's Case, and so I
can say little to it; but if this be it, that she re∣fuses
a Man for his being of <HI>no Religion,</HI> she is in the
right; she is a good religious Child herself, my
Sister educated all your Children very wells, and if
she marrys a Gentleman, <HI>as the Times go now,</HI> that
thinks Religion below him, and unbecoming, <HI>as
most of them do,</HI> she is undone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>So she says, and has just your Arguments;
that made me say, you had been documenting her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, Brother, not I; but I'll tell
you what I have been, I have been a <HI>Memento</HI> to
the Family; and don't doubt but my Sister might
shew them the Danger of it by their Aunt's Exam∣ple:
I Pray God, they may take the Warning: I
know she was not wanting to them in her Instru∣ction,
and in cautioning them against every thing
that was hurtful; and if she forgot this of caution∣ing
them never to marry a Man of no Religion,
then she was not that wise Woman I took her for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not who has caution'd her, nor who
has instructed her, but if I had not took it up very
warmly, she had ruin'd herself with her Nicety:
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Here he tells her the whole Story of his Daughter and the Gentleman, to the time of his coming from Home, he not knowing what had happen'd since.</HI></NOTE>I'll tell you how it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Brother, you will allow me to be
free with you; I must needs say, I think you are
in the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I expected that from you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="98" REF="105"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist</SPEAKER>
<P>I speak my Experience, Brother; I would
not force a Child's Inclination in such a Case for
the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by Inclination? she forces
her own Inclination; for her Sister says, she loves
the Gentleman, and has own'd it; and yet upon
this simple Nicety, she pretended to cross herself, af∣front
the Gentleman, and disoblige her Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will not all that convince you then,
that she acts by strength of Judgment, and upon
Principles of Conscience? if it be as you say, it is
the noblest Resolution that ever I heard of, since
the Story of St. <HI>Catharine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't tell me of your noble Resolutions,
and your fine Principles; it is a first Principle, an
original Command of God, that Children should
obey, their Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Brother, where the Parent commands
nothing that clashes with the Laws of God; but
then, Brother, our Authority ceases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am sure, this Match is for her Advan∣tage,
and I'll make her have him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a severe Resolution, and if it be a∣gainst
her Conscience, you may fail in all you re∣solve
upon; besides 'tis evident you ought not to
resolve so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What? am not I her Father! has it not been
always the Right of Fathers to give their Daugh∣ters
in Marriage? nay, to bargain for them, even
without their Knowledge: Did not <HI>Caleb</HI> promise
his Daughter <HI>Achsah</HI> in Marriage to him, that should
smite <HI>Kirjathsepher,</HI> not knowing who it should be,
or whether the Girl should like him or no, and are
there not many such Instances in the Scripture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is true, Brother: but I do not
think the Laws of God or Man give Parents that
Authority now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="99" REF="106"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you allow my Daughters to marry
who they please, without putting any Weight upon
my Consent one way or t'other; would you give
your Daughters that Liberty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Brother, you wrong me; but there is
a great Difference between your negative Autho∣rity
and your positive Authority in the Case of a
Daughter; as there is a great Difference between
your Authority in the Marriage of a Daughter and
the Marriage of a Son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know my Lady Sister is a nice Civilian:
Pray explain your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can take all your Banters patiently, Bro∣ther,
and I will explain my self, contradict me if
you can; I distinguish them thus, if your Daugh∣ter
desires to marry any Person you do not like, I
grant that you have Power by the Law of God to
forbid her positively: The Scripture is plain, you
have Power to dissolve even a Vow or Promise of
hers, to marry or not to marry at all: But if your
Daughter is not willing to marry one you may like,
I do not think, you have the same Right of Com∣mand;
for you might then command her to mar∣ry
a Person she may have an Abhorrence of, and
an Aversion to, which could not be; the very
Laws of Matrimony forbid it; she could not repeat
the Office of Matrimony at her Marriage, <HI>viz.</HI> to
<HI>love</HI> and <HI>honour him:</HI> and to promise what she knew
at the same Time would be impossible for her to
perform, would be to perjure herself, (<HI>for the Marriage
Promise is a solemn Oath</HI>) and to deceive her Hus∣band
in the grossest Manner; neither of which
would be lawful for her to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, for all your fine Harangue, I
have made her do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they marry'd then, Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="100" REF="107"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but they shall, as soon as I come
Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish her well; she is a Child that de∣serves
very well, I am sure; she is a serious, sensi∣ble
religious, Child, and will be an extraordinary
Woman; but if you force her to marry, as you
say you will, <HI>remember</HI> my Words, <HI>Brother,</HI> you
will make her miserable, as I have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, so she will; just so miserable;
she will have a good Husband, and about 2000<HI>l.</HI> a
year Estate, a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>serable Condition truly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>All that's nothing; nor will it lessen the
Misery at all to a good Woman; I am sure she had
better go to Service, or marry a good, sober, reli∣gious
Shoemaker; and I would do so my self, if I
had my Choice to make again; therfore I say it
again, dear Brother, remember my Words; if you
do it, you make her miserable, and will repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, I am not so positive neither; I
would not ruin my Child, you may be sure; but
I shall see when I come Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let me hear how it goes, when you
come Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you shall, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<P>After this Discourse he staid but two or three
Days with his Sister, and then went Home: when
he came Home, to be sure the first Question he
ask'd of his eldest Daughter was, how Mr.—
did? and if he was in the House?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the House! No, Sir, <HI>I think not.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>you think not?</HI> when was he here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, Sir, since the Evening after you
went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she has not <HI>serv'd me so,</HI> has she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="101" REF="108"/>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Serv'd you, Sir! <HI>Nay,</HI> it's he has serv'd
you so too; for he said the last time he was here,
he would wait on her again, but he has never been
here since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she must have us'd him very ill, I am
sure, he had never done so elfe; where is she?
call her down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my Sister is gone to my Aunt—'s at
<HI>Hampstead.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; finely managed I assure you!
Well, I'll manage her, and all of you, if this be
the way I am to be used.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[He is in a great Passion.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe there is nothing done to use you
ill, Sir, or to provoke you in the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is she gone out of the House for then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, you are so angry with her, when you
talk with her, that you fright her; I was afraid, last
time you talk'd to her, you would have thrown her
into Fits; and so we really all advis'd her to go
Home with my Aunt last Week, when she was in
Town, and stay there, till we could see what you
will please to have her do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! she knows what I expected she should
do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to marrying Mr.—Sir, that she can never
do; and she has talk'd it to him so handsomely, that
Sir, I assure you, he said himself he could not an∣swer
her Objections, that she had Reason for what
she did, and he could not urge it any farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why,</HI> did not you say, he promised to come
again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he did say he would wait on her again,
but he is gone into the Country, I hear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll say no more till he comes again,
then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nay,</HI> if he had come again, she had resolv'd,
she would not have seen him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="102" REF="109"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Say you so! I'll be as positive as she;
if she will see him no more, she shall, see me no more,
I'll let her know so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry Things are so; but I am sure, she
will never see him, if she never comes home more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll try that; I'll go over to <HI>Hampstead</HI> in the
Morning, I'll see what I can do with her.</P>
</SP>
<P>Her Sister was now in as great a Fright as be∣fore;
she knew the Principle her Sister went upon
was good, and she was very loth to have her thrust
by Violence into a State of Life she so abhorr'd;
and this made her take more Freedom with her Fa∣ther
than she would have done, and take more
Care of her Sister too, left her Father should bring
Her away and marry her by Force; so she sent a
Man and Horse away the same Night to <HI>Hampstead</HI>
to her Sister, to give her Notice of her Father's
Resolution to come over in the Morning, and
giving her an account of what had pass'd, advising
her to be gone out of his way some where else.</P>
<P>As the young Lady had acquainted her Aunt
with the whole Story, her Aunt was so affected
with it, and so abundantly justified her Conduct
in it, that upon this News, she told her, she would
place her at a Friend's House a little way off, and
she would undertake to talk to her Father, when
he came; and if she could not bring him to any
Reason, she would send her the next Day into the
Country to her other Aunt, the Widow, of Sir
<HI>James</HI>—; so sho sent her away in the mean
time in her own Coach to <HI>Hindon,</HI> a Village be∣yond
<HI>Hampstead,</HI> with a Maid and a Footman to at∣tend
her, till her Father was gone.</P>
<P>In the Morning (as he said he would) her Father
came to <HI>Hampstead,</HI> and as soon as he had saluted
his Sister, he asks for his Daughters; his Sister told
<PB N="103" REF="110"/>
him she was gone a little way to visit a Friend of
hers, but desired him to sit down.</P>
<P>She saw, he was disturbed and uneasy, <HI>Come Bro∣ther,
says</HI> she, <HI>be calm and moderate, and do not treat
your Child with so much Warmth; let you and I talk of
this Matter; my Niece has given me a full Account of
the whole Story.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has she so? but she shall, give me ano∣ther
Account of it, before she and I have done
yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find, Brother, you consult your Passions
only in all this Matter, and I must tell you, they
are base Counsellors; I wish you would act in cool
Blood, and consult your Reason a little too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I think I do; and I won't be instructed
by my Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, no,</HI> Brother, it's evident you act too
violently; if you consulted your Reason, I am sure
it would tell you, that you are <HI>all wrong:</HI> Did ever a
Father hurry and terrify his Children so with his
Fury and his Passions, that they are afraid to see
him, and ready to swoon when they hear he is
coming to them; and then do you consider, what a
Child this is, that you use thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I use her! she uses me I think! and abuses
me too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be patient, Brother, be patient; Passion
I tell you is an ill Counsellor; consider the Cir∣cumstances
of your Child, and hear what she has
to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by hearing? I think she
han't heard what I have to say, when she flies thus
from Place to Place, as if she was a Thief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's because you do not act like a Chri∣stian
Father; you make your self a Terror to your
Children; this dares not see you; those at Home
<PB N="104" REF="111"/>
dare not speak to you; why, what do you mean,
Brother? you did not treat them thus, when they
were little: Do you consider what they are now?
That they are Women grown, and ought to be
treated as such; and deserving Women too they
are, that the World sees; and you expose your
self most wretchedly to treat them thus: I am very
free with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I treat them? what, to provide a
Gentleman of 2000<HI>l.</HI> a year for the youngest, a hand∣some,
complete young Gentleman as any the Town
can produce, and every way unexceptionable;
nay she own'd herself he was one she could like
very well, and to have her affront him and her Fa∣ther,
and to dismiss him of her own Head, with∣out
consulting me, or staying till I came to Town!
and this after five Weeks keeping him Company,
and when she knew the Writings were drawing for
her Marriage-Settlement; is this a decent way of
treating a Father? I think you are <HI>free</HI> with me in∣deed,
to take their Pares in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Brother, suppose all this to be, just
as you relate it, yet if the young People <HI>could not
hit it,</HI> do we not always, when we make Proposals
one to another for our Children, make this Condi∣tion,
<HI>viz. if the young People can agree?</HI> and do we
not put them together to talk with one another, on
purpose that they may be acquainted, and see whe∣ther
they can like one another, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> and so did I: Has he not waited up∣on
her Ladyship, <HI>I tell you,</HI> five Weeks? was not
that Time enough to know, whether she lik'd him,
or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time enough to like or dislike, I grant it;
and she tells you plainly, she does not like, and
cannot marry him; what would you have? and as
to putting him off in your Absence, she says, she
<PB N="105" REF="112"/>
told you her Mind positively, before you went out
of Town, and would have given you her Reasons
for it; but you treated her with so little Temper,
that she had no room to speak; and at last told her
you would have none of her Reasons, but expect∣ed
she should have him; how do you answer that
<HI>pray?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew what she had to say well enough;
however I gave her till my Return to consider of
it; what had she to do to turn him off without my
Knowledge, and affront a Gentleman of his Qua∣lity?
it's an Insult upon her Father, and a Scandal
to the whole Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all answer'd by what I said before,
that she told you positively, before you went out of
Town, she would never have him, and indeed had
resolv'd then, to see him no more? for what should
a young Woman keep a Man Company for, when she
resolves not to have him? whatever you may
think, Brother, it would not have been very hand∣some
on her side; besides, I can assure you, your
Daughters are none of those Women, that do any
thing unbecoming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she did keep him Company after it,
for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never but once, that she might dismiss him
civilly, and that was meerly a Force of your own
upon her, because your Passion with her, obliged
her to do that Work herself, which you ought to
have done for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, she's an undutiful, disrespectful Crea∣ture
to me; I han't been an unkind Father to her;
but I'll let her know herself my own way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You'll consider of that, Brother, when
your Passion is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I; I am no more in a Passion now,
than I was before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="106" REF="113"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may well be indeed; because you
were then in such a Passion, it seems, as disorder'd
all your Family: is Passion a proper Weapon to
manage Children with, Brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's impossible for any Man to be thus treat∣ed
by hits Children, and not be in a Passion: In∣gratitude
is a Thing no Man can bear with Pa∣tience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But who shall be Judge between you, Bro∣ther?
for it's possible you may be in the wrong as
well as your Children; and take this with you, for
a Rule in all such Breaches, that generally those
that are. in the greatest Passion, are most in the
wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>No, no;</HI> I am sure I am not in the wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's making your self Judge, Brother; I
think you should let some judicious, sober, impar∣tial
Person hear your Child, fince you won't hear
her your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, do you think I'll have Arbitrators
between me and my Children?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope you will act the Father with them
then, and not the Madman, as (<HI>I must be plain with
you</HI>) I think you do now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I'll act the Father with them,
while they act the Part of Children with me, but
no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If God should deal so by us all, what would
become of us? think of that, Brother, when you
make Resolutions against your own Children; and
without just Cause too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you won't pretend this is without
Cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Brother, I do not see any Cause
you have to be offended with your Child; it's true,
you brought a very fine young Gentleman to court
her, and I know you were pleased with the Thoughts
<PB N="107" REF="114"/>
of such an Alliance in your Family; his Estate, his
Person, his Character, were all pleasing; but
here's che Case, your Daughter has been religiously
and vertuously educated by my Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>By your Sister only, I suppose; you might
have put that in too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Brother, I do not charge you with
the Crime of being any way concern'd in the reli∣gious
Part of their Education.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I obstruct it, or blame her for it? I
left them to her; it was none of my Business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a sad way of discharging your Duty
to your Children, Brother, in their Education:
But that's none of my Business; we will leave that
now; they have been soberly and religiously edu∣cated,
whoever, did it; and they are very sober,
religious young Women, especially this youngest
above them all; they are an Honour to your Fa∣mily,
and to the Memory of my Sister their Mo∣ther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>But none to me, <HI>I confess that.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>They will be so to you too in the End, if
you know how to make yourself an Honour to
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll make them fear me, if they won't
honour me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are hardly in Temper enough to talk
to, however let me go on; I tell you, they have
been so bred, and they so well answer their Edu∣cation,
that they are an Honour to your Family;
their Mother instill'd Principles of Virtue, Piety,
and Modesty in their Minds, while they were very
young.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I know all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray be patienc; among the rest this was
one, <HI>That a religious Life was the only Heaven upon
Earth; they were her very Words:</HI> that Honour, E∣state,

Relation, and all human Pleasures, had no
Relish without it, and neither pointed to a future
Felicity, or gave any present, <HI>at least, that was so∣lid
and valuable;</HI> and on her Death-bed she cauti∣on'd
them never to marry any Man, that did not at
least profess to own Religion, and acknowledge
the God that made him, whatever Fortunes or
Advantages might offer as to this World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>She might have found something else to do,
when she was just at her End, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, <HI>let me be free with you;</HI> she had two
bad Examples to let before them, where a want of
a religious Husband had made two Families very
miserable, tho' they had every thing else that the
World could give; and one was your own Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the other herself; I understand you,
Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be that, as the Sense of your own Conduct
directs you to think, Brother, <HI>that's none of my Busi∣ness;</HI>
she was my Sister, and therefore I say no
more of that: But these are all Digressions. The
young Women, your Daughters, thus instructed,
and thus religiously inclin'd, are grown up; you
bring a Gentleman to court one of them, who,
with all the Advantages his Person and Circum∣stances
present, yet wants the main Thing, which
she looks for in a Husband; and without which she
declares she will not marry, no not if a Peer of
the Realm courted her: <HI>Pray What have you to say to
such a Resolution,</HI> that you should oppose it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does she know who is religious, and
who not? she may be cheated soonest, where she
expects it most.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; and she has the more need to
have her Father's Assistance to judge With, and as∣sist
her in her Choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="109" REF="116"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't inquire into that Part, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I perceive you don't; she has there∣fore
the more Reason to look to herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Gentleman may be as religious as any
Body, for ought she knows; how can she pretend
to know, I say, who is religious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis easier to know who is not relijious,
than who is; but this Gentleman has been so kind
to her, and so honest, as to put it out of all doubt,
it seems; for he has frankly owned to her, that
as to Religion, he never troubled his Head about
it; that 'tis a Road he never travelled; he makes a
jest of it all, as most young Gentlemen now a-days
do; tells her, that his Business is to choose a Wife
first, and then perhaps he may choose his Religion,
and the like; is this the Gentleman you would have
your Daughter marry? <HI>Brother!</HI> is this your Care
for your Child! is it for refusing such a Man as this
that you are in a Passion with your Child! I blush
for you, Brother! I intreat you, consider what
you are a doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will never believe one Word of all this;
I am sure it can't be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfy'd, every Word of it is true, and
you may inform your self from your other Chil∣dren,
if you think it worth your while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll believe none of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not while you are in this Rage, I believe
you will not; for Passion is as deaf as 'tis blind;
but if you would cool your Warmth, and let your
Reason return to its Exercise, and to its just Do∣minion
in your Soul, then you will hear and be∣lieve
too; for when we are calm, and our Passions
laid, 'tis easy to judge by the very telling a Story,
whether it be true or no; but it is not to my Ar∣gument
whether it be true or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="110" REF="117"/>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! Pray what is to your Argument then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this, whether you are not in the
wrong, <HI>if it is true.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the wrong? <HI>in what</HI> pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to treat your Child with such Fury
and ungovern'd Passion as you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why how must Children be treated, when
they are insolent and disobedient?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even then, not with Passion and Heat,
Brother: there is no Case in the World, that can
possibly happen, which ought to make a Father
act in a Passion with his own Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>No! how must he correct them then, when
they do evil Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>All with Calmness and Affection, Brother;
not with Rage and Fury; that is not correcting
them, that's fighting with them; he must pity
when he punishes, exhort when he corrects; he
should have the Rod in his Hand, and Tears in his
Eyes; he is to be angry at their Offences, but not
with their Persons: The Nature of Correction im∣plies
all this; 'tis for the Child's Goody, that a Pa∣rent
corrects, not for his own Pleasure; he must
be a Brute, that can take Pleasure in whipping a
Child<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He sat silent here a good while, and said not a Word, his Conscience convincing him, that, she was in the right; at length he puts it off thus.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am not a correcting my Children
now, they are past that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, Brother, you are correcting now
too; there are more ways of Correction than the
Rod and the Cane; when Children are grown up,
the Father's Frowns are a Part of Correction, his
<PB N="111" REF="118"/>
just Reproaches are worse than Blows; and Passion
should be no more concerned in that Part, than in
the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are fine-spun Notions; but what is
all this to the Case in hand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, it is all to the case in hand; I am
sorry there is so close an Application to be made
of it; for if we are not to be in a Passion with
our Children, even when we havd just Reason to
correct them, and see Cause to be displeased with
them; sure we must not be in a Passion with them,
when there is no Cause for Displeasure; <HI>I say Dis∣pleasure,</HI>
for Cause of Passion with our Children
there can never be; all Passion is a Sin, and to sin
because our Children sin, can never be our Duty,
nor any Means to shew them theirs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does not the Scripture say, <HI>Be angry, and
sin not?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you would read that Scripture according
to its genuine Interpretation, it would help to con∣vince
you of all I have said: <HI>Be angry,</HI> but <HI>be not in a
Passio;</HI> to be angry may be just, as the Occasion for
it may make it necessary; but be not <HI>immoderately
angry,</HI> for that is to sin, and no Cause of Anger can
make that necessary; and therefore another Text
says, <HI>Let all Bitterness and Wrath be put away from a∣mong
you,</HI> Eph. iv. 13. these are Scriptures, Bro∣ther,
for our Conduct even with Strangers; but
when we come to talk of Children, 'tis ten thou∣sand
times more binding; we cannot be in a Pas∣sion
at any Body without Sin; but to be in a <HI>Passion</HI>
at our Children, that's all Distraction, and an Abo∣mination,
and tends to nothing but Mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a healing Preacher, Sister, I con∣fess,
there is some Weight in what you say; but
what can I do, when Children are thus provoking?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="112" REF="119"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! go Home, and consider the Case ma∣turely,
and pray to God to direct you to your Du∣ty;
if you did that seriously, you would soon see,
that your Child is not to blame, and that you are
very much in the wrong to press her in a Thing
of this Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, nay, don't say so neither; you may
say I am wrong to be so angry, but you cannot
say I am not very ill used; that I am positive in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me hear you say so, when with Tem∣per
and Calmness you have heard the whole Case;
if you will not bear to hear it from your Daughter
herself, hear it from her Sisters; and be compos'd
and impartial, and then I shall see, you will be of
another Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bro.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't promise you, I can have so much Pa∣tience
with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, till you can, you can't say, you are
doing the Duty of a Father.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here the Discourse ended, and he goes home a∣gain;
and the young Lady, thinking she had some
Encouragement from this Discourse to hope, that
he would be calmer with her, went Home too in
the Afternoon, and took care to let her Father
know iy, and see her in the House; however he
took little Notice of her for some time.</P>
<P>The next Morning he call'd his eldest Daugh∣ter
to him, and began another Discourse with her
upon the Affair thus:</P>
<P>Come Child, <HI>says the Father;</HI> now Passion is a
little over, and I am disposed, <HI>however ill I am
used,</HI> to bear it as well as I can; pray give me a
true Account of this foolish Girl your Sister and

<P>It's my Mercy, Sir, he did not; and I de∣sire

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by That, Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I have not been forc'd to disoblige
my Father, or to marry against my Mind, as my
Sister has been; two Things I know not which
are most terrible to me so much as to think of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you would not have been such a Fool
to have run into these Scruples too, would you? I
have a better Opinion of your Senses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire your good Opinion of me may al∣ways
continue; and therefore, Sir, as I am not
tried, I hope you will not put a Question to me,
that 'tis not so proper for me to answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, be easy. Child, I have a religi∣ous
Man in my Eye for you, I assure you; we
will have no need of such foolish Breaches on your
Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's time enough, Sir, to talk of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, as to your Sister: you know
when I left her, I charg'd her to entertain him till
my Return, and you know what Resolutions I
made if she did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Father, you went away in a Passion;
she had declared positively she would not have him,
and she could not think of entertaining a Gentle∣man,
after she had resolved not to have him; it
would not have been handsome: However I did
over-persuade her to see him that Night you went
away; in hopes, truly, that she might have had
some Opportunity to be better satisfied in her main
Scruple about Religion, and that she might have
got it over: But on the contrary, he made such
<PB N="114" REF="121"/>
an open Declaration of his Contempt of all Reli∣gion,
and his perfect Ignorance of any thing about
it, that I could not but wonder at it; sure he must
think we were a Family of Atheists, or else he
did it to affront her, for he could never think it
could be agreeable to any of us; and upon this
she made the same open Declaration to him, that
she could never think of joyning herself to a Man
so perfectly void of Principles; and so they parted
as it were by Agreement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it <HI>so short</HI> beween them then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Sir, there was a great deal more; they
did not Part with Disgust at all; I am persuaded
he loves her intirely, and I am sure she loves him
too; I wish she did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is she not a double Fool then, to thwart
thus both her Fortune and her Fancy, and all for
she knows not what? Had he been a sawning Hy∣pocrite,
that could have talk'd of Religion, whe∣ther
he had had any or no, she would have taken
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>She would not have been easily deceiv'd,
Sir, for she lays the whole Stress of her Life's Wel∣fare
upon it; 'tis a solid Principle with her, which
she cannot go from, and which she thinks her Fan∣cy
and Fortune, and all things in this World ought
to submit to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Well,</HI> but you say it was a long Discourse; I
don't doubt but you have heard it all, over and over:
Pray give me as full an Account of it, <HI>Child,</HI> as you
can.</P>

<P>Well, I think they are both Fools; he for

long enough before she has such an other Offer, I
dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe that is none of her Affliction, Sir;
she's only troubled at her disobliging you, which
she had no Possibility to avoid, without oppressing
her Conscience, and making herself miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see that's any of her Concern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed Sir, it is; and I am afraid she
will grieve herself to Death about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that had been any Grief co her, she would
not have acted as she has done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a terrible Case, Sir, to have so many
powerful Arguments press against Conscience; I
wonder she has been able to stand her Ground a∣gainst
them, and I am sure it lies very heavy upon
her Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by Arguments pressing
upon her Conscience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, to name no more, here is a Gen∣tleman,
who by his profest Choice <HI>of her,</HI> and ex∣traordinary
Proposals <HI>to her,</HI> has given undoubted
Testimony of his loving her very sincerely: <HI>In the
next Place,</HI> a splendid Fortune, giving her a Pros∣pect
of enjoying all that this World can offer:
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> A very agreeable Person, and one that has
by his engaging Conduct, made some Way into her
Affection; so that 'tis easy to see, she not only has
a Respect for him, but really loves him; And last∣ly,
The Displeasure of her Father, who she never
disobeyed before, and to disoblige whom is effectu∣ally
to ruin herself for this World: Are not these,
Sir, pressing Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And why do they not prevail with her then?
and why is she so wilful?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="116" REF="123"/>
<SPEAKER>Da:</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing but her Conscience; a Sense
of her Duty to God, and her own future Peace,
has upheld her Resolution; he has profess'd himself
to be a Man of no Religion, and such a one she
dares not marry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand nothing of it, nor do I see any
need to pretend Conscience in the Cafe at all;

<P>What need she trouble herself about his Re∣ligion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my Business, Sir, to give you an ac∣count
of the Fact, not to enter, into the Argu∣ment;
'tis enough that <HI>one Daughter</HI> has displeased
you already.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; well, I see she is come Home again:
I have nothing to say to her; I don't look upon
her as any Relation of mine.</P>

<P>If you don't abate something, Sir, and shew
your self a little tender of her, I believe you will
soon have but two Daughters to provide for; per∣haps
not that, for I think it will break all our
Hearts to fee her.</P>
</SP>
<P>All that his eldest Daughter could say, or that
either of his Sisters in the Country had said, had
yet no Effect upon him; but he carried it so re∣serv'd
to his Daughter, that she appeared in the
Familyas if she had not belong'd to him, and he con∣tinued
it so long, that it began to be very probable
he would never alter it; which so griev'd the poor
young Lady, that she fell very sick with it, and it
was fear'd she inclined to a Consumption; and be∣ing
very ill one Day, her Sister, who was her fast
Friend and only Comforter, desired she would go
out a little and take the Air; so they resolved to

being to perswade her to stay two or three Days

strange little Adventures befell them, which will

in the Coach going to <HI>Hampstead.</HI></P>

much, as to let it destroy you?</P>
<SP>

<P>What can I do, Sister? I support it as
well as I can, but it sinks my Spirits; 'tis too hea∣vy

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But shake it off then, Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shake it off! You talk of it as a Thing
in my Power: No, no, Sister, Effects rarely cease
till their Causes are removed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you will talk Philosophy, I
am sure Philosophy would cure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; but I am no Philosopher, I hope,
pray how would that cure me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How? that I mean by Philosophy is
Reason; tho' Women are not Philosophers, they
are rational Creatures; I think you might reason
your self out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do talk Reason, when I say Grief hav∣ing
seized upon my Spirits, and the Cause being
immoveable, while that remains so, the Effect will
be so too.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not in my Power to remove the
Cause; but yet, I think, if you would hear Rea∣son,
you might remove the Grief, which is the
Effect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo, Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you think Reasoning would do it?
pray what kind of Reasoning is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="118" REF="125"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to reason but upon the Folly, the
Madness, the Injustice, nay, the Sin, of immode∣rate
Grief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You begin warmly; pray let's hear the
Folly of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why several Things will convince you
of its being the foolishest Thing in the World:
Grief is a senseless, useless Passion; 'tis useless,
because 'tis perfectly incapable of doing any Good,
and only capable of doing Evil; <HI>Grief</HI> is in∣deed
no Passion, but a Quality, a Disease of the
Mind; which must be cur'd; 'tis an evil Spirit
that, must be cast out; besides, it is a senseless
Thing; for 'tis a Means to no End; it aims at no∣thing,
seeks nothing, endeavours nothing, only
corodes the Spirits, stagnates the very Senses, and
stupisies the Soul; and therefore Grief was anci∣ently
represented as a Viper, generated in the Li∣ver,
and preying upon the Vitals of the Man; and
when it came within a certain space of the Heart,
it had two Ways to go; if it a ascended, it quitted
the hypocondriack Vessels, and so possessing the
Brain, ended in Madness; if it descended, it pos∣sessed
the Blood, and ended, in Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray end your Reasoning; for I do not un∣derstand
it; go back to the Point proposed, what
must I do? you say, shake it off; I ask; what must
I do to shake it off? how can I shake it off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, divert your Mind; think no
more of him; turn your Thoughts to Things that
are in Being, this is now a Thing over; you should
only esteem it as a History of Things done in the
Ages past.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me, Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprize you, Child! in what?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="119" REF="126"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am both grieved and astonished, that
you should have such mean Thoughts of me, as to
think my Grief is founded upon the parting with
Mr.—: I protest to you, I am so far from hav∣ing
the least Concern of that Kind upon me, that
it is the only comfortable Reflection I have in the
Word, and I give God Thanks from the bottom
of my Soul, as often as I think of it, that I am
deliver'd from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you are sensible, that it is
better ns it is; but I know it is a great Struggle be∣tween
Principle and Affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, Sister, I am over all that;
it did not hold me half an Hour; when my Con∣science
dictated to me my real Danger the future
Felicity of my Life, the Commands of God, and
the dying Instructions of my dear Mother, Do
you think the little stirrings of an Infant-Affection
to the Man, was able to struggle with such an Ar∣my
of Convictions? God forbid! <HI>No, no;</HI> he is
to me as the most contemptible Fellow on Earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Sister, you never thought
him a contemptible Fellow, I am sure; nor he is
not so in himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, as a Gentleman he is not so; he is
a lovely Creature, and the only Man in the World
I could ever say I had any Affection for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you lov'd him; nay, and do

and your Colour changed; I could seeit
plain enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How cruel is that now, Sister! you
prompt the Affection to revive, as if you would
recall the Temptation; and assist it in a new At∣tack
upon me; I allow I loved him, and as a Gen∣tleman
so every way agreeable, I do so still; but
<PB N="120" REF="127"/>
shall I yoke my self with one of God's Enemies!
embrace one that God abhors! speak no more of
it I entreat you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's carrying it too far; you can∣not
say <HI>who</HI> God abhors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I'll put it the other way then, to stop
your Mouth: shall I yoke my self with a practical
Atheist! embrace one that rejects God, love him
that hates my Saviour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that's too far too; he told you
he did not hate Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cavil, Sister, you don't argue; I'll
give it you in Scripture Words, is he not of those
<HI>who say to the Almighty, Depart from us, we defire not the
Knowledge of his Ways?</HI> did he not openly say the same
Thing? is he not only void of the Knowledge of
Religion, but of any Desire to have any Know∣ledge
of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not take what I said ill, Sister, I
acknowledge he is indeed such a one; but still you
love him, Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, as such I abhor him; the
Thoughts of haying been but in Danger of him,
makes my Blood run chill in my Veins; shall I
marry a Profligate! a Man of no Religion! nay,
that has the Impudence to own it! No, Sister, I
rejoyce that I am delivered from him, and I never
desire to see him more as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are you really got as sar above it
as you say you are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, have not you and I often
lamented the Loss of a religious Family, even in
our own Father? the want of religious Corversa∣tion,
the want of a Father to teach, instruct, in∣form
and explain religious Things to us? Have we
not seen the dreadful Life our Aunt, <HI>my Father's
Sister,</HI> liv'd for want of a religious Husband, and
<PB N="121" REF="128"/>
the heavenly Life my Aunt here our Motber's Sister
lives, that has a picus, sober, religious Husband and
Family! and can you think I would ever be a Wife
to such another as <HI>Sir James!</HI> Besides, could I bear
to be tied to a Man that could not pray to God
for me, and would not pray to God with me?
God forbid! the greatest Estate and the finest
Man in the World should never incline me to
such a Thought! I thank God my Soul abhors it;
and 'tis the Joy of my Heart, that the Snare is
broken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is it then that opppresses
your Mind thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sister! you cannot ask me such a
Question.</P>
</SP>
<P>Just as she had said those Words, came a Gentle∣man
on Horseback, and gallopt by the Coach side,
and looking into the Coach, pull'd off his Hat to
her; but having paid his Compliment, he rode
on: The very Moment he look'd in, the eldest
Sister had dropt her Fan in the Chariot, and was
stooping down to reach it, and so did not see him;
but when she got up, looking at her Sister, she
found her look very pale.</P>

<P>One of them did: Did you not see
them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I heard some body ride by, but
my Head was down looking for my Fan: why,
who was it? 'twas not Mr.—was it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! yes it was let us go back, Sister, I
intreat you; am very ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we have a long way back, and
we are almost at <HI>Hampstead</HI> now; we had better go
to my Aunt's; we shall be there presently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well let us then, bid him drive apace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! There he is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She calls to the Coachman to drive apace, and look∣ing out of the Coach, she saw the Gentleman riding softly with only two Footmen; a little way off of the Coach.</NOTE> a little before us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he comes again to the Coach-side,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">She looks out of the Coach again.</NOTE>He is gone now a great way off.</P>
<P>They soon came to their Aunt's House; and
went in, the Coach standing at the Door: After
they had been there a Quarter of an Hour, the
Gentleman, who knew well enough where they
were, came to the House, and sent in their Foot∣man
to tell the eldest Sister he was there, and de∣sired
the Favour to speak two or three Words with
her.</P>
<P>The Servants led him into a Parlour, and the
young Lady came down to him in a few Minutes;
he told her, that before he entred into any Dis∣couise,
he must assure her of two Things; First,</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="130"/>
That his overtaking them upon the Road was
purely accidental and without the least Design,
and she might easily be satisfy'd by his Servants and
Baggage; for he was just setting out on a Journey
of above a hundred Miles, and should not return
under three Weeks at leasy: And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That
he had no Design in calling there, to move any
thing to her concerning the old Affair, but only to
have two or three Words with her relating to him∣self:
You know, <HI>Sister,</HI> says he, <HI>for I must still give
you that Name of Respect;</HI> upon what Terms your
Sister and I parted, and as I promised her I would
Wait on her again, and did not, I have been very
uneasie lest she might think I shewed her some
Disrespect, and that I took ill what she said to me;
and truly for some time so I did: She answered
coldly, That she believed her Sister had not at all
been dissatisfy'd at his not coming again. No, <HI>Ma∣dam,
says he, I believe that; by the manner of the Dis∣miss
she had given me; but howerver I would not be rude
to her whatever she thought fit to say to me;</HI> She re∣turned,
<HI>and with a little more Concern than before,</HI> that
she hop'd, however, her Sister had thought fit not
to go on with what was proposed, yet that she had
not been rude to him. <HI>No, Madam, says he, not
rude.</HI> Sir, says she, <HI>as you had offered nothing to my
Sister but what was like your self, very honourable, I am
sure she does not so ill understand berself as to offer any
thing unbecoming; to you.</HI> He return'd, <HI>with a very
obliging way of speaking</HI> that her Sister understood
herselt perfectly well, and I assure you, <HI>says he</HI> she un∣derstood
my Character better than I did my self. I do
<HI>not rightly take your Meaning.</HI> Sir, said she, my Sister
<HI>could make no Objection to your Character. Madam,</HI> said
he, you know very well upon what Foundation
your Sister alter'd her Mind, and absolutely refused
any farther Treaty with me, <HI>viz.</HI> That I was a
<PB N="124" REF="131"/>
profane, wicked, irreligious Creature: The Fact
was true, I own'd it to her, that I neither had any
Knowledge of Religion, or desired any, for which
I was a very great Brute.</P>
<P>I think you were very sincere, Sir, <HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>O Madam, said he, I do not say, I was a Brute
for owning it but I was a Brute for living in that hor∣rid
Manner, <HI>and yet</HI> thinking that any sober Woman
could entertain a Thought of having me.</P>
<P>I am very sorry, said the Lady, it happene'd so.</P>
<P>I am very glad, Madam, that she treated me so,
<HI>reply'd be,</HI> and shall love her ten thousand times
Better for it, if that be possible, than ever I did
before.</P>
<P>Says she to him again, <HI>Sir, you are pleased to ban∣ter
a little.</HI></P>
<P>No, Sister, says he, I don't banter; and my
stopping to speak with you was for this Reason; I
do not ask to speak with your Sister; but I beg you
will tell her from me very seriously, that she has
been a better Instructor to me than my Father, or
Mother, or all the Tutors and Friends I had in my
Life; she has convinc'd me, that I was a Monster,
a scandalous Fellow, that ought to have been
asham'd to pretend to a Woman that had the least
Sense of her Education, or of him that made her:
I have Reason to give Thanks to God every Day I
live, that ever I saw her Face, and that I had that
Repulse from her: Tell her I recommend it to her,
to preserve that noble heavenly Reasolution, which
she' said she had taken up, <HI>viz. Never to marry any
but a religious Man,</HI> she is undone if she breaks it.;
and tho' I am never able to deservo her, yet I shall
always think of her as the Mother of all that is or
ever will be good in me, and value the very Me∣mory
of her accordingly: He waited no Answer,
but with all possible Civility took his Leave, and
<PB N="125" REF="132"/>
his Horses being at the Door, took Horse and went
away. She waited on him to the Door, and as he
was paying his Respects to her, sitting on his Horse,
he said to her, <HI>Dear Madam,</HI> I hope you will give
your Sister a particular Account of what I have
said, to you: She answer'd, she would not fail to
do it with all the Exactness possible.</P>
<P>As soon as he was gone, she ran up to her Sister,
but before she could speak to her, her youngest
Sister cry'd out to her, <HI>Sister,</HI> before you speak3 do
not ask me to go down, for I will not see him.</P>

<P>Truly, Sister, I don't think 'tis fit you

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps that's the Reason why I resolve not to see him; won't you allow me to know my

your own Affections; I do not desire to press you,
and never did.</P>

<PB N="126" REF="133"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>As he is now, I don't know whether
you would or no; there's a strange Alteration in
him.</P>

<SP>

<P>What do you mean by an Alteration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he is quite another Man; he

<P>What Trick do you mean?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! he told me he could play the Hy∣pocrite
most nicely, and was sure he could de∣ceive
me; but it won't do; I'm prepar'd for that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure he was no Hypocrite before,
he was too plain before; and I do not see why
you should say he is a Hypocrite now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he told me he would be so; he
acknowledged he had shewn more Honesty than
Discretion before, and was sorry for it; and that if
he was to begin again, he would take just the
contrary Course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I dare say, he is no Hypocrite
now, any more than he was before.</P>

<P>I won't trust him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you may give me leave to tell the
Substancc of his Discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, do not be drawn in to lay
Snares for me; you would not be willing to have
me deceived, why should you assist in it? I desire
to hear nothing of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very disobliging, Sister, to me;
would I assist any Man to deceive you, that have
so much applauded your Resolution not to be de∣ceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, and assisted me too in withstand∣ing
the Importunities of my own Affections, or
elss I believe I had not been able to have support∣ed
<PB N="127" REF="134"/>
my Sense of Duty; and therefore I wonder
you should forsake me now.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Aunt.</HI> Child, do not press your Sister to hear any
thing; I must confess her Case is wonderful nice;
she loves the Gentleman, she does not stick to ac∣knowledge
it; she has great Scruples on her
Thoughts about her Duty to her Father, and they
all sway on the same Side; her Father frights her
with violent Words, and hard Usage, and Threat∣nings
of turning her cue of Doors; against all this
she stands single in Obedience to her Conscience,
I think we should assist her.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Madam, if my Sister was not
here, I would say a great deal more; I think she
has acted the noblest Part in its kind, that any
young Body ever did: I wish I may be able to pre∣serve
such a Resolution, if ever it should be my
Case; and I am sure I should be far from discou∣raging
her; but what I was going to tell her, was
nothing to discourage her; I wish she would let
me tell it you first.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, tell it my Aunt;
I'll<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She goes out of the Room, and the eldest Sister tells her Aunt what the Gentleman had said.</NOTE>
withdraw.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Aunt.</HI> Well, Niece, I do think of the two it
may be still better not to tell it your Sister; let us
lay it up in our Hearts; if it be true, and he is a
retormed Man, we shall perhaps hear more of him;
if not, to persuade her he is really chang'd, is but
to make her love him more, without knowing
whether he ever thinks any more of her or no, and
that can be no Service to her.</P>
<SP>
<PB N="128" REF="135"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I submit, Madam, to your Directions,
but then I break my Promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may find a Time for that too.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Discourse broke off here, and her Aunt
finding the young Lady very ill and disturb'd, de∣sired
her Sister to leave her there for a few Days,
to tell her Father, how ill she was, and that she
thought the Country might divert her a little, but
that if he desired her to come Home, she would
return whenever he pleased: Her eldest Sister did
so, but all the Answer she got was, <HI>she might stay
there for ever, if she would, he never desired to be troubled
with her any more.</HI></P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE former Dialogue having put an End
to she Courtship between the Gentle∣man
and his Mistress for the present,
and there being some Interval of Time
between those Things and the remaining Part of
the Story, that Interval is filled up with another
little Affair in the same Family, of still a nicer
Nature than the other, tho' not carried so far.</P>
<P>The Father had frequently discoursed these
Things with his eldest Daughter in the Case of her
Sister, as is to be seen in the last Dialogue, and
found by her Disconrse that she was pretty much
of her Sister's Opinion in the Matter of choosing
a Husband; But having a Gentleman in his Thoughts
for her, who had the Character of a very sober;
religious Person, he made no Question but he
should dispose this Daughter both to her Satisfaction
and his own.</P>
<P>It was with a View to this Design that he had
jesed with her in one; of then last discourse, that
he had a religious Husband in store for her, and
that he hop'd he should give her no Occasion to
play the Fool as her Sister had done.</P>
<P>In the Consequence of this he took Occasion to
tell her one Evening after Supper, that what he
had spoken in a way of Jest to her at such a Time,
was really no Jest in his own Thoughts; that he
had been spoken to by a certain Gentleman, a con∣siderable
<PB N="130" REF="137"/>
Merchant in the City, whose eldest Son
had an Inclination to pay his Respects to her; and
<HI>I assure you, my Dear,</HI> says her Father, <HI>he has the Cha∣racter
of a very sober, religious Gentleman,</HI> and I am
sure his Father and Mother are very good People;
indeed the whole Family are noted for a religious
Family, and I know no Family in the whole City
that have a better Character.</P>
<P>She made him no Answer at all, till he began
with her again, <HI>Why are you so silent, Child,</HI> said her
Father? Have you nothing to say? Methinks when
I look back upon the Disorder which the Obstinacy
of your Sister has put us all in, I would be glad to
have every Difficulty removed before-hand with you,
and therefore I speak early, that if you have
any Objections, I may hear them, and not be dri∣ven
asteawards to ask People Pardon, for ill Usage
which I have had no hand in; and I would have
you use your Freedom now, that I may take no∣thing
ill from you afterwards: And thus he press'd
her to speak.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Daughter.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in no haste, Sir, to marry; the
Times terrify me; the Education, the Manner,
the Conduct of Gentlemen is now so universally
loose, that I think for a young Woman to marry,
is like a Horse rushing into the Battel; I have no
Courage so much as to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there are a great many sober, civi∣liz'd
young Gentlemen in the World; 'tis hard to
reproach them all, because many of them are
wicked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, it is those civilized People which I speak
of; for even those who now pass for sober, are not
like what it was formerly; when you look narrow∣ly
among them, as there are in the Gross ten Rakes
to one sober Man, so among the sober. Men that
<PB N="131" REF="138"/>
are called civiliz'd Men, and whose Morals will
bear any Character, there are ten Atheists to one
religious Man; and, <HI>which is worse than all the rest,</HI>
if a Woman finds a religious Man, it is three to one
again, whether he agrees with her in Principles;
and so she is in danger of being undone even in the
best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard the like! why what are my
Daughters made of! what is nothing good enough
in the World for you! if you go all upon such Ni∣ceties,
I must never think any more of marrying
any of you.</P>
</SP>

<P>You had rather, Sir, not think of it, I
dare say, than think of seeing us miserable.</P>
</SP>

<P>Why there is not a Man on Earth can please
you, as yob have stated it.</P>
</SP>

<P>I think, Sir, I ought to nave a negative Voice,
without being obliged to dispute my Reasons with
my Father, for that's just bringing me into the

good to her, but not to you, Sir; and so you take
her Conscience of Duty to God to be a Contempt
of her Duty to you; I would not be run into the

<P>But I had better know my Case beforehand,
that I may not insist upon more than is my Right,
and offend you, Sir, in seeming to encroach upon
your Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me know then what your Demand is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="133" REF="140"/>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I think when you propose marrying to
me, the Discourse of Portion and Settlement is in
your Province, and I have nothing to do with it;
but I think I ought to be at Liberty to like or dislike
receive or refuse the Person, and that absblutely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What without shewing any Reason?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I ought, without doubt, to tell my
Father my Objections, and to give a due Force to
all the Arguments my Father may use to satisfie my
Doubts, but I ought not to be forc'd <HI>to like,</HI> even
tho' I could not maintain my Reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you capitulate with me for this Liberty
before you see this Gentleman, do you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I do not capitulate with you, but
I hope you will of your own accord grant me the
Liberty which the Nature of the Thing calls for;
that if I must see the Gentleman, I may have the
Freedom to take or refuse, if not there is no need
to see him, I may be given by a Contract, and
marry'd by Proxy, as the great People (Fools I
should say) do as well as by Treaty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I an't a going to give you, nor
to sell you; if you won't have him, you may let
him alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's all I desire, Sir; with this Addition
only, <HI>viz.</HI> that my Father will not be displeased
or disobliged, whether I take or leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't promise you that indeed Daughter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I beg of you, Sir, I may never see
him at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Very well;</HI> then <HI>it shall be so;</HI> you shall never
see him at all: I find you are all alike; you may
look out for your selves, if you will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>He rises up in a passion, and goes away, but comes in again presently.</HI></NOTE>; but it may

be, I mayn't like your choosing any more than you
will like mine.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>[Her <HI>Father returns</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder what it is you would all have me
do in such a Case as this? here is a Match propos'd
to your Sister, how she has treated me you know:
Now I have a Proposal to you, where the grand
Objection is removed; what can you desire of a
Father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I desire only, that If you think fit to
discourse such Things as these with us, we might
be able to speak for our selves without discomposing
you; we have not a Mother to stand between and
make our Objections to, and to hear our Reasons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that's true<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She weeps, and that moves him, especially speaking of their Mother.</NOTE>; it's my Loss as well as
yours: Come, let me hear, however, if you have
any Objection against the Person I propose now,
tell u me; I'll endeavour not to be warm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can have no Objection to a Man I never
saw or heard of; but I think we should have a Li∣berty
to refuse, Sir, when we come to discourse
of such a Thing with the Person; and that is all I
ask, and that we may not disoblige you if we use
that Liberty, and without that Liberty, I desire
you will be pleased never to make any Proposal at
all to me, and if ever I make one my self, I will
be content co be denied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very positive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems to be so reasonable, Sir, that I can∣not
think any Children can ask less, or any Father
think it is too hard; it is the Children that are to
feel the Consequences of the Mistake, if there be
any.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="135" REF="142"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that's true; come then if you will
talk with this Gentleman, you shall have your Li∣berty
to take him or leave him; have you any Ob∣jection
to make before-hand? if you have, let me
know it; that will prevent all Occasions of Disgust.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you please to hear me with Patience,
Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I will if I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have heard so much said by me, Sir,
in my Sister's Behalf, that you must necessarily be∣lieve
I am of the same Opinion; <HI>that is to say,</HI> That
I would not marry a Man that made no Profession
of Religion, upon any Account whatsoever, were
his Estate, his Person, his Sobriety, his Qualifica∣tions,
ever so inviting; I need not give Reasons
for this, Sir, what I have said, what my Sister and
my Aunts have said on that Account is enough; but
it is my Misfortune, Sir, to have another Scruple
beyond all that, and which the Case of my Sister
gave no Occasion to mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; then you intend to be more
troublesome than your Sister, I find.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Sir, because I give my Scruples
in beforehand, and if any thing offers to you a∣broad,
that will shock the Foundation I lay down,
I hope you will not hearken to it on my Account
and then you will have no Occasion to say I am
troublesome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well let us hear it however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, as I will never marry any Man
who does not make some Profession of Religion,
however rich or agreeable, handsome or sober he
is; so however serious or religious he is, I will ne∣ver
marry any Man, whose Principles, Opinion,
and way of Worship shall not agree with my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that your Resolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="136" REF="143"/>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope it is well grounded, Sir, and that
you will not disapprove my Reasons for it, when
you please to hear them calmly, and to bear with
my mean way of ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing? them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I was much in the right to say you
would be more troublesome than your Sister; how∣ever
you do your Sister some Kindness in is, for
this extravagant Humour makes hers look a thou∣sand
times more reasonable than it did before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Da.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's what I foresaw, Sir; <HI>viz.</HI> that I shall
remove you. Displeasure horn my Sister, and bring
it down upon my self, but I cannot help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall relieve my self against all your
Humours; I'll talk no more of settling any of you
till your Curiosity is abated.</P>
</SP>
<P>Tho' her Father seemed to give it over thus in
Discourse with his Daughter, yet he had gone far∣ther
with the Gentleman that made the Proposal,
than he had told her, and had invited the Fa∣ther
and Mother to Dinner the next Day, with an
intent that they should see and be acquainted with
his Daughters, supposing, at the same time, that
they would bring the young Gentleman with them.</P>
<P>They came to Dinner accordingly; but as the Fa∣ther
knew well enough, that the Education of their
Son was a differing Way from that of his Daughters,
and that she had declared herself so positively in
that Part, he had desired them privately, not to
bring Their Son to Dinner: When they were come
and before his Daughter was call'd in, the Father
told them how the Case stood between him and
his eldest Daughter, and that he saw no Remedy
but this, that as he had not cold her any thing of
the Design, of this Invitation, or that they were
the Family he had designed her a Husband out of,
so if they thought fit to turn their Eyes to his se∣cond
<PB N="137" REF="144"/>
Daughter, he was in hopes she would have
more Wit than to run into the ridiculous Scruples
of the eldest: They presently agreed, that it was
not at all reasonable to force the Inclination of the
young Lady; that they saw no room to bring the
Opinions in Religion together, in their Children,
their Opinions at that Time differing extremely,
and their Son being as positive, they believed, as
his Daughter; so they laid, with all their Hearts,
if their Son could fancy their second Daughter as
well, it should be the same thing to them: How∣ever
the Mother of the young Gentleman ask'd
him if he would give her Leave to enter into Dis∣course
with his Daughter upon the Subject of her
Scruples; he told her with all his Heart, for he
would be glad to have her change her Mind; be∣cause
as on the one hand he should be very well sa∣tisfy'd
to bring them together, so he really thought
her Notions were empty and simple, and should be
glad she was made wiser; but then, Madam, <HI>says
he,</HI> you must not discover the real Design, for if
you do, she will be backward to speak freely; she
agreed to that, and so this private Discourse ended,
and his Daughters being introduced, and the usual
Ceremonies pass'd, they went to Dinner, the
young Ladies knowing nothing of the Design of
their being invited.</P>
<P>The Father and Mother were charm'd at the
Conduct of the young Woman; her Person and
Manner; the Modesty of her Behaviour, and a∣bove
all, the Politeness and Pertinence of her Dis∣course;
and something happening to be said about
marrying, the Father falls to rallying his Daughters
upon their Nicety in that Point; that nothing would
serve them but religious Men: There's my Daughter
—<HI>says he,</HI> (pointing to his youngest) I think
nothing will do for her but a Parson; she refused a
<PB N="138" REF="145"/>
Gentleman of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year t'other Day, because
he was not religious enough for her.</P>
<P>No, Madam, says his daughter, my Father
means, because he had <HI>no Religion at all;</HI> hardly so
much as a Coach-horse; for a Goach-horfe often
knows the way to the Church-door.</P>
<P>That alters the Case quite, said Madam: Why,
Sir, says she, you would not have married your
Daughter to a Brute! A Man without Religion is
a worse Bruce than a Horse! for the Horse obeys
the Dictates of Nature, but an Atheist acts against
Reason, Nature and common Sense: I would not
marry a Child of mine to a Man of no Religion, if
he had ten thousand Pound a year.</P>
<P>Well, says he, there's my Daughter—(point∣ing
to his eldest) she goes farther; she is not satis∣fy'd
with a religious Husband, but she must have
one of her own Opinion in Religion, that goes to
Church where she goes to Church, and worships
just as she worships; I don't think she will ever be
pleased while she lives.</P>
<P>Madam, says the eldest, I expected my Father
would be upon my Bones next: My Father talks
of my Opinion, as if I was something that no bo∣dy
else is; as if I was one of the new Prophets, or
of some strange singular Opinion, something mon∣strous
in Religion; <HI>all I say</HI> is, that as I profess nothing
but what <HI>I think</HI> is light, and what thousands agree
with me in: if ever I do marry, <HI>as I suppose I never
shall,</HI> why should I not choose to have my Husband
and I of the same Opinion, that we may serve God
together.</P>
<P>Madam, says the old Lady, your Father does
but jest with you; he can never oppose so reason∣able
a thing as that; I must confess, I think it is
much to be desired; I will not say, but there is a
<PB N="139" REF="146"/>
Possibility of doing well without it; it may not be
a Sin, but I own, it is better if it can be so.</P>
<P>I am sure 'twould be a Sin in me, <HI>says the Daugh∣ter,</HI>
because it would be against my Conscience.</P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>says the other,</HI> that's true; and you
are very much in the right to insist upon it, if it
be so; and no doubt your Father will be far from
offering; any thing that may seem to be a Violence
upon your Conscience.</P>
<P>I offer Violence, Madam! <HI>says the Father,</HI> nay, they
are above that, they take upon them to say, I
will, and I won't, to their Father; I assure you they
are past my offering Violence to them.</P>
<P>In nothing, Madam, but this crabbed Business
of marrying, <HI>says the Daughter,</HI> and there indeed we
do take some Liberty with my Father.</P>
<P>Well Sir, says the old Lady, you must allow Li∣berty
there; Marriage is a Case for Life, and must
be well consider'd; and the young Ladies are to
bear it, fall it how it will, you know,, <HI>for better or
worse;</HI> they had need be allowed some Liberty there.</P>
<P>Besides, Madam, says the youngest, all the Li∣berty
we cake is in Negatives only; we don't offer
to take any body that my Father don't like, only
we don't care to take such as we don't like our
selves.</P>
<P>The old Gentleman then put in; upon my Word,
Sir, <HI>says he,</HI> I think your Daughters are in the right;
for certainly, tho' we may refuse to let them marry
where they may choose, yet I can't think we should
deny them the Liberty to refuse what we may offer,
or else we may as well give them in Marriage, as
was done in old Days, and never let them see one
another.</P>
<P>The eldest Sister turn'd her Head towards her
Father at this, but said nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="147"/>
I understand you, <HI>Betty,</HI> says her Father; but
she said nothing still; and the old Lady, finding
the Discourse pinch'd a little hard, begun some o∣ther
Talk, and soon after, the Men withdrawing,
left the Ladies together.</P>
<P>When the Men were gone; Hark ye, says the
old Gentlewoman, I was willing to break off the
Discourse just now, because I was afraid it was of∣fensive
to your Father, but pray let me talk a little
more to you; I fully approve the Resolution of
your youngest Sister, but methinks yours is a little
uncharitable, <HI>speaking to the eldst.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was very much obliged to you Ma∣dam,
for breaking off the Discourse, for my Father
is passionate, and is sometimes so out of Temper
with us upon those Points, that we are greatly
grieved at it, and particularly that he will not give
us Leave to speak.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure it has almost broke my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry for it; for indeed I
think yours is nothing but what every Woman that
is a Christian ought to think herself obliged to;
what dreadful Doings must there be, when a reli∣gious
Woman marries a Wretch that is a Despiser
of God? a Christian to be link'd to an Infidel!
one that serves God to be joyn'd to one of God's
Enemies! and then to love such a Man too! The very
Thought is enough to fill one with Cunfusion!
Take it which way you will, it is equally dismal.
<HI>First,</HI> To be marry'd to him and <HI>not love</HI> him, that's
a Hell upon Earth! and to love him! one that we
must reflect on as a Limb of the Devil! a Son of
Perdition! to embrace one that God abhors? to
have the Affections bound to one that God hates!
what Contradictions are these! what Horror must
fill the Soul while they live! and what dreadful
<PB N="141" REF="148"/>
Thoughts must crowd into ones Mind, if such a
Man should come to die before us! Dear young
Lady, says she, you are happy that you could de∣fend
your self against such a Proposal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, your Charge upon me
is a lirtle hard: I think the Arguments are as strong
almost in my Part as my Sister's, tho' they are of
another Nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I can't say so, Madam: it is true,
there is something to be said in your Case, but no∣thing
so essential as in the other; and, as I said,
methinks it looks as if you wanted Charity: I hope,
Child, you do not think all Opinions but your own
are fatal to be profess'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam, not at all; I hope there
are good People of all Persuasions; but if I did
not think my own best, how could I answer the
cleaving to it my self?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you are right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, Madam, tho' in Charity I ought
to allow others to be good Christians, and that I
should, and do keep up a friendly Correspondence
with them who dissent from my Judgment in reli∣gious
Matters, yet there is a great deal of Diffe∣rence
between Charity to them, and Union with
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have studied the Point thoroughly I
perceives; I understand you perfectly; pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, in Discourse with my Father,
I could never use my Freedom, or obtain Leave to
propose my Scruples, with the Reasons of them;
but I hope you will allow me Liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam, for I am
glad to enter into so curious a Debate with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Religion, Madam, without Doors <HI>is
one thing,</HI> Religion within Doors <HI>is another:</HI> in the
Town among my Acquaintance, and in the Neigh∣bourhood,
<PB N="142" REF="149"/>
a due Charity to every one is what I
think the Christian Principle calls for, and I con∣verse
freely with good People of every Opinion,
extending Charity to all <HI>in lowliness of Mind, esteeming
every one better than my sef:</HI> But <HI>within doors the Case
alters;</HI> Family-Religion is a sociable Thing, and God
should be worship'd there with one Heart, and with
one Voice; there can be no Separation there with∣out
a dreadful Breach both of Charity and Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You start a new Thing to me indeed, and
it is somewhat surprizing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be true, Madam that there
may be divers Opinions in a Nation, without breach
of Charity, but I believe it is impossible it should
be so in a Family,, without breach of Affection:
what Union, what Oneness of Desires, what per∣fect
Agreement (without which a Man and Wife
can never be said to discharge the Duty of the Re∣lation)
can there be, where there is a diversity of
Worship, a clashing of <HI>Opinions,</HI> and an Opposi∣tion
of Principles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Child, you carry it too high; if
they differ <HI>in Principles</HI> indeed, there is something
to be said; but we are talking of a Difference in
Opinion only, where the Fundamentals may be the
same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I recall the Word <HI>Principles</HI>
then, and joyn with you to confine it to <HI>Opinion</HI>
only; But 'tis the same thing; the Union can never
be perfect, while the differing Sentiments of things
leave room for Disputes between them: For Ex∣ample,
Madam; the differing Forms of Worship;
one will pray by a Book only, the other without
a Book wholly; this is as light a Difference as can
be spoken of: But how shall God be wotship'd with
the united Voice and Affections of the whole Fa∣mily
even in this Case? what Helps will two such
<PB N="143" REF="150"/>
Relations be to one another, in praying to God ei∣ther
by themselves or with their Families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word you sensibly affect me
now with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not enough, Madam, that they
being sincerely religious a part, and shall worship God
in their own separate Way, tho' better so than not
at all; but the Zeal, the Affection, the uniting
their Hearts in their Worship, their praying with
and for one another; this alas! is all lost: Then say
it be in the publick Worship, there they make a wo∣ful
Separation; God, that has made them one, is
serv'd by them as two; God has joyn'd them to∣gether,
and they part asunder in their serving him;
God has made them one, and yet they cannot wor∣ship
him as one; how does this consist, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see you are full of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>In their publick Worship, Sacraments
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> neither one Heart or one Voice goes with
their Worship: Tho' they communicate in the same
Ordinance, they set up two Altars; one worships
here, and one there; and tho' their Faces are both
set Heaven-wards, perhaps they turn back to back
as soon as they go out of then Doors co the pub∣lick
Worship of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very clear in it indeed, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is nor all, Madam; there are se∣veral
Family Circumstances besides these, which
make a Union of Opinion absolutely necessary:
As first, Family-Worship, a Thing without which
Families, however privately and separately devout,
are coupled with Heathens, Jer. x, 25. <HI>Pour ouact thy
Wrath upon the Heathen, and upon the Families which
call not upon thy Name:</HI> Whatever there may be in
publick Worship, there should always be an exact
Harmony in private; and how can this be, where
either of them distents tram the Manner? if there
<PB N="144" REF="151"/>
is a Discord in the Manner, there can beno Con∣cord
in the Performance, no Union in the Affe∣ctions;
in a Word their <HI>Prayers will be hindred,</HI> and
who would be thus unequally yoked?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expected you would name that Scrip∣ture,
tho' it is certain that was spoken principally
to those who married with Unbelievers, which is a
different Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Madam, but to come to another
Case: Suppose the Husband and Wife we are speak∣ing
of have Children, what Foundation of Eter∣nal
Schism is there in the Family? some of the
Children adhere to the Father, some to the Mo∣ther;
some worship <HI>in this Mount,</HI> and some no
where <HI>but at Jerusalem;</HI> some go with the Father,
some with the Mother; some kneel down with
the Father, some with the Mother; till, as they
grow up, they really learn not to kneel down at
all: Family-Education, united Instruction, Cau∣tion,
Example, they are all dreadfully mangled
and divided, till in the End they come to nothing;
and the Children grow our of Government, past
Instruction, and are all lost. These, Madam, are
some of the Reasons I would have given my Father
(if he would have had Patience with me;) why in
his late Proposal he said he had to make, I desired
that I might be at Liberty to choose by my own
Principles, and not at random, as too many do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Madam, do you not allow, that if
both Parties are sincerely pious and religious, they
may make Allowances to one another, and make
Conscience of hindring and pulling back one ano∣ther
in the Duties of Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Madam, as to that, two Things
offer to my View, for I have often considered
them both: First, The more sincere in Religion
either of them are, the more fixt in Principle and
<PB N="145" REF="152"/>
Opinion, it is likely they will be, and the farther
from making Abatements to one another; and es∣pecially,
Secondly, In the great Article of educa∣ting
and instructing their Children; for what ten∣der
Mother, that having fixt her Opinion, as she
thinks, in the belt Manner and Way, could bea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
not to have her Children brought up in the same
Sentiments of Religion, which she thinks most
agreeable to the revealed Will of God? and the
more consciencious and religious she was, the more
steadily she would cleave to it as her Duty; and
the like of the Man: So that here would be a con∣stant
Heart-burning and Uneasiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Madam, I think your Reasons good,
and you guard them so well with such self-evi∣dent
Conclusions, that I cannot think your Father
can desire you to break thro' them: If you think it
will be for your Service, I'll mention it again to
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you do, Madam, I desire to be ab∣sent;

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old La.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone for that.</P>
</SP>
<P>When the old Lady had done this Conversation,
she began to call for her Husband and the Father;
so the young Ladies withdrew: When she was
come to them, she applied herself to the Father
and her Husband in a few Words.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon my Word, <HI>says she to her Husband,</HI> this
young Lady has more Religion in her than all of
us, and a clearer Sight into the particular Parts of a
religious Life, than any that ever I met With before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, says the Father, have you had a
Battle with my Betty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="146" REF="153"/>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, upon my Word, we have had no Bat∣tel;
I have not been able to open my Mouth a∣gainst
one Word she says; she is able to run down
a whole Society of Doctors in these Points; I am a
perfect Convert to all she says, and tho' I wish from
my Soul my Son had such a Wife, yet I would not
for the World they should come together at the
Price of putting the least Violence upon such no∣ble
Principles, so solidly establish'd, and so firmly
adher'd to; and I defy all Mankind to confute her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Husband.</SPEAKER>
<P>You prompt my Curiosity; I wish you
could tell us a little of the Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>A little! I can easily repeat it to you; 'tis
impossible I should forget it: But it may be you,
Sir, <HI>turning to the Father,</HI> may not care to hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; I would very willingly hear it,
tho' I did not care to hear it from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she gives them a full Account of all the Dis∣course above.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard any thing more solid, and
intimating a thorough Sense of Religion in
my Life; I wish my Son and she were both of the
same Opinion then; for a Woman of such Prin∣ciples
can never be fatally mistaken in Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I would never give her Opportu∣nity
to explain her self thus with me; but I as∣sure
you I am so mov'd with it, that I will never
offer to impose upon her again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you see, Sir, it was an Error to be
so angry with your Child, as not to hear her; I
fear you have done so with both of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I have; but I see now I have been
wrong to them both; and indeed more to my
youngest Daughter, than to my eldest; for she
<PB N="147" REF="154"/>
refused the Gentleman because he really had no
Religion at all, and yet I was in a violent Passion
with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that was hard indeed; for if there
be all this to be said, why a Woman should not
marry a Man of a different Opinion in Religion,
there must be much more to be said why she should
not marry one that despises Religion; and this in∣deed
I said to your youngest Daughter, applauding
her Conduct, tho' I did not know that you had
used her hardly on that Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would be obliged to you, Madam, to let
me know what Discourse you had with her too, for
that Affair is frill depending.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart; my Discourse was
not long—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She repeats what she had said to the youngest Daughter.</NOTE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, you are right, the thing
is so indeed; but he was a pretty Gentleman, and
had a very noble Estate, and I was mightily pleas'd
with the Thoughts of the Match, and that made
me more passionate with the Child, than I should
othewise have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how came she to know he was such a
one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, his own Folly too; he told her so
directly, in so many Words; own'd he had not trou∣bled
his Head about Religion, and did not intend
it; made a Banter and Jest of Religion in
general; told her, it was a Road he had never
travel'd, and that he intended to choose a Wife first,
and then pehaps he might choose his Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay then, either he had no Conduct, or
no Affection for her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="148" REF="155"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>as to the last; he not only profest a great
deal of Affection, but chose her out from the rest;
and you know she is the youngest, (for I designed
my eldest for him) and made her the particular
Mistress of his Choice; and I verily believe lov'd
her very well; nay, the Girl cannot deny but she
had a Kindness for him; and indeed he is a most
lovely Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has acted a noble Part indeed; and
the more Affection she really had for him, the
more of a Christian she has shewn in her Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would say indeed, if you knew all
her Conduct, and knew the Person too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be not improper, I should be glad to
know, the Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, I should be loth to name him to
his Prejudice; and if you think it will be so, I
hope you will let it go no farther.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I promise it shall never go out of my Mouth
without your Leave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is young Mr.—a Gentleman, I
believe you have heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heard of him! we know him intimately
well: But I am surpriz'd at it, upon an Account
that I believe will surprize you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is true, that Gentleman had no
Religion: Poor Gentleman! he came of a most
unhappy Stock; there never was any Religion in
the Family; but yet this may be said of him, he
was a modest, sober, well-behav'd Gentleman;
you never heard an ill Word out of his Mouths nor
found any indecent Action in his Behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; and I thought that a great
Matter, as the Youth go now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I can tell you more News than that of
him, he is become the most pious, serious, religious
Gentleman in all the Country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="149" REF="156"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>You surprize me indeed now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you 'tis no Copy of his Counte∣nance;
'tis known, and he is valued and honour'd
for it by all the Gentlemen round him, and he be∣haves
himself with so much Humility, so much se∣rious
Gravity, that, in short, 'tis the Wonder and
Surprize of all that know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, How long has this Alteration appear'd
in him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>About three Months I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I with you had told my Daughter this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was impossible I should have brought
such a Thing in, that knew nothing of the Cir∣cumstance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if you had, she would not have be∣lieved
a Word of it; on the contrary, she would
have taken it all for a Trick of mine, and that I
had invited you hither on purpose to bring such a
Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wife.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me alone for that against another time;
I hope you will give the young Ladies Leave to re∣turn
this Visit; I design to invite them to come
and see me.</P>
</SP>
<P>Upon this Foot the Discourse ended for that
Time, and all Thoughts of the Match for the eld∣est
Daughter with the Son of that Gentlewoman
being laid aside for the present, the old Lady, at
parting, in a very, friendly Manner invited the
young Ladies to her House, and they promised to
come, and the Father said aloud he would come
and bring them.</P>
<P>It was not long before the young Ladies put
their Father in mind of his Appointment; for be∣ing
mightily pleased with the old Gentlewoman,
they had a great Mind to pay the Visit, that the
Acquaintance might be settled. Their Father ap∣pointed
<PB N="150" REF="157"/>
the next Day, but being interrupted just
at the Time he intended to go, he caused them to
go without him and send the Coach back for him
to come after them when his Business was done.</P>
<P>While they were here, the good old Gentlewo∣man,
who entertained them with great Civility,
diverted them with every thing she could think of;
and after abundance of other useful Chat, they
fell to talking the old Stories over again, about
religious Husbands, and the Necessity there was to
have both Husband and Wife joyn their Endea∣vours
to propagating Family - Religion: The
youngest Daughter repeated her Mother's Maxim;
Madam, says she, it was a Rule my Mother gave
us at her Death, and which I see so much Weight
in, that I desire to make it the Foundation, upon
which I would build all my Prospects of Happi∣ness,
<HI>'viz.</HI> That a religious Life is the only Heaven upon
<HI>Earth:</HI> I have added some other things to it since,
which my own Observation directs me to, but
which I believe you will allow to be in their De∣gree
just such as these, <HI>viz.</HI> That a religious Fa∣mily
is one of the greatest Comforts of a religious
Life, That where both Husband and Wife are not
mutually, at least, if not equally religious, there
can never be a truly religious family; That there∣fore
for a religiously inclined Woman to marry an
irreligious Husband, is to entail Persecution upon
herself as long as she lives. The old Lady reply'd,
I find, Madam, as young as you are, you have
studied this Point very well. Indeed, Madam,
<HI>said the eldest Sister,</HI> my Sister has had occasion for
it; for she has been hard put to it, what with the
Offers of an extraordinary Match, my Father's
violent Passion, and, <HI>among our selves, Madam,</HI> not
a little the Importunity of her own Affections,
that for my Parr, I must confess, I wonder she has
<PB N="151" REF="158"/>
been able to stand her Ground; They are three
powerful Arguments, I acknowledge, <HI>said the old
Lady,</HI> Pray, Madam, as far as it may be proper,
let me know something of the Manner; you need
not mention Persons; I am not inquisitive on that
score, I assure you: If my Sister give me Leave,
Madam, says the eldest, <HI>the youngest said she left her
at Liberty,</HI> Why then, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> My Fa∣ther—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she gives her an Abridgement of the whole Sto∣ry, but without the most extravagant Part of her Fa∣ther's Passion, that it might not reflect upon him.</NOTE></P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> I will not say all my
Thoughts on this surprizing Story, because your
Sister is here, for 'tis a Rule with me never to
praise any one to their Face, or reproach any
behind their Backs; but it is an extraordinary Sto∣ry
indeed; and turning to the youngest Sister, she
said to her very seriously, <HI>I pray God fortify you,</HI> Child,
<HI>in such Resolutions,</HI> and <HI>grant that you may have the
true End of them fully answer'd; that if ever you do
marry, it may be to a Man as uncommonly serious, pious
and sincere as you have been inimitably resolute in refusing
such great Offers, for the Want of it.</HI> Then turning to
her eldest Sister, say she, This surprizing Story puts
me in mind of a Story which a very good Man and
an old Acquaintance of ours told me the o∣ther
Day, and which they say has just now hap∣pen'd
to a young Gentleman that he knows in the
Country, it's a pretty way off too, but he told us
his Name, I believe my Husband knows the Name,
and I tell you the Story for your Sister's Encou∣ragement;
who knows, but she may be a means
by such unexampled Conduct as this of hers is, to
<PB N="152" REF="159"/>
bring the Gentleman she has had upon her Hands
to some Sense of his Condition.</P>
<P>There is a Gentleman in that Country of a very
good Family; and of a very great Estate, but
young, and a Batchelor I think he said; he is not
above six and twenty, and has between two and
three thousand, a year, a most accomplish'd well∣bred
Man, a handsome charming Person, and
every thing that could be said of a Man, to set him
out, he said of him: He had indeed been of a Fa∣mily,
<HI>he said</HI> that had been eminently wicked, so
that the very Name of Religion had scarce been
heard of among them for some Ages; and <HI>young
Master,</HI> said my Friend, could not well be said to
be worse than his Father and Grandfather, that
went before him.</P>
<P>However it happen'd, it seems that he went to
<HI>London, I think,</HI> says she, <HI>my Friend said 'twas last
Winter,</HI> and when he came back he was strangely
melancholy and dejected, and quite alter'd in his
Conversation; instead of riding abroad and visit∣ing
the Gentlemen, and receiving Visits from them,
he shun'd all Company, walk'd about his Gardens
and Woods all alone till very late in the Night,
and all his Servants wonder'd what ailed him; that
one Night they were in a great Fright for him,
knowing he was out on Foot, and alone; when,
about ten a Clock at Night he came in with a poor
honest Country Fellow with him, that liv'd almost
three Mile off; that the next Day he took that
poor Man home to his House, and sent for his
Wife and Children, who all liv'd in a poor Cot∣tage
on the Waste, and provided for them; gave
the poor Man a Farm Rent free for twelve Years,
which always went for 22 <HI>l.</HI> a year, with a good
House, and lent him a Stock for manuring it too,
and, made Him Bailiff of the Manor; and in short,
<PB N="153" REF="160"/>
made a Man of him: Whereupon every body said,
that the Esquire had been in some great Danger or
other, and the poor Man had saved his Life; and
when some body happen'd to say as much to him
one Day, he answer'd <HI>yes,</HI> that poor Man had done
more than saved his Life <HI>for he had saved his Soul.</HI></P>
<P>It seems this poor labouring Wretch, tho' mise∣rable
to the last Degree, as to this World, was yet
known co be a most religious serious Christian, and,
a very modest, humble, but knowing and sensible
Man, and he had been discoursing good Things
with him, and from that time forward the poor
Man was scarce ever from him; that it was observ'd
by some of the Servants, that the next Morning
after the poor Man came Home with him, he came
again and brought a Bible with him, which was left
in the young Gentleman's Chamber, and that this
poor Man and he were often lock'd up an Hour or
two together every Day; that next Market-Day
the poor Man went to the next Market Town upon
some Business for the Gentleman, and brought
Home a new Bible, and several other religious
Books, and that his Master was continually reading
them; In short, our Friend tells us, <HI>says she,</HI> that
he is become the most sober, religious Christian,
that for a Man of his Fortune and Quality has ever
been heard of, and that he is admired by all the
Country for it.</P>
<P>I tell you this Story, Madam, turning to the
youngest Sister, to confirm you in your Resolution,
and to let you see, that there are some religious
Gentlemen in the World still, and that the Gen∣tlemen
may be ashamed, when they pretend to say
Religion is below their Quality; for, <HI>my Friend says,</HI>
that this Gentleman is with his Religion also the
humblest, sweetest temper'd Creature in the World,
ready to do good Offices to the poorest of the
<PB N="154" REF="161"/>
County, and yet mannerly and agreeably pleasant
With the Greatest, and his Family is a little Pattern
of Vertue to all round them.</P>
<P>Ay, Madam, <HI>says the eldest,</HI> 'tis such a Gentle∣man
my Sister would have: But, <HI>says her Sister,</HI>
where are they to be found? I never expect it:
Pray, Madam, says the eldest Sister, in what Part
of the World does this <HI>Black Swan,</HI> this unheard
of nonsuch Thing of a Gentleman live? I really
forget the Place, Madam, <HI>says the old Lady,</HI> but 'tis
somewhere in <HI>Hampshire.</HI></P>
<P>She perceiv'd <HI>at that Word</HI> both the young Ladies
chang'd a little, and look'd at one another; so she
turn'd her Discourse off to some other Subject, and
left them in the dark as to the Name of the Gen∣tleman;
for she perceived they both guess'd at it,
or suspected it.</P>
<P>When they had taken their Leave, and the two
Sisters were in the Coach coming Home, <HI>says the
eldest Sister to the other,</HI> Did you observe Mrs, B—s
Story of the Gentleman in <HI>Hampshaire?</HI> Yes; said
the other, I did; and I believe you fancy 'tis the
same Person. we know of: It's very true, <HI>says the
eldest,</HI> I did think so all the while she was telling
the Story; and I expected she would name him,
but I was loth to ask her his Name: I am glad you
didn't, <HI>says the other,</HI> for I know no Good it can be
to me, to hear it one way or other now he is gone.
Why would not you be glad to know that he was
really such a one as she has described, <HI>says the eldest?</HI>
Yes truly for his own Sake I should, <HI>said her Sister;</HI>
but 'tis nothing to me now; I had rather never
have him mention'd at all to me, upon any Occa∣sion
whatever.</P>
<P>After they were come Home, their Father, who
being engaged all the while, had sent the Coach
back for them, with an Excuse for his not coming,
<PB N="155" REF="162"/>
was very inquisitive to know of them what Dis∣course
they had had, and his eldest Daughter telling
him one Story and another Story, he would cry,
<HI>Well, was that all?</HI> for he expected she had broke
the Thing to them: No, says the eldest, she told
us a strange Story in Hampshire; and with that re∣peated
the Passage above Word for Word. Her
Father took no notice of it at that Time, but two
or three Days after, as they were at Supper, he
says to his eldest Daughter, <HI>Betty,</HI> says he, <HI>Who do
you think the Gentleman in</HI> Hampshire <HI>is, that Mrs.
B—told you the Story of?</HI> I cannot tell, says she;
Pray who was it? Even as I thought when you
told of it, <HI>said her Father, for I had heard something of
it before;</HI> it's no body else but Mr.—the same
your wise Sister there thought fit to treat with so
much ill Manners.</P>
<P>Nay, Sir, says the eldest, do not say my Sister
treated him with <HI>ill Manners;</HI> for he owns the con∣trary
to that <HI>himself;</HI> but how are you sure of it,
Sir, that it is he? Why I have had the Story, <HI>says
her Father,</HI> from her Husband, who is greatly af∣fected
with, and he named his Name to me, not
knowing in the least that I knew any thing of him</P>
<P>Truly, <HI>says the eldest,</HI> I am very glad of it for
his Sake, but it does not signifie a Farthing to her
now; for if he was to come to her again to Mor∣row,
with all his Sobriety and Reformation about
him, she would have nothing to say to him.</P>
<P>Why so, Child, <HI>says the Father?</HI> Did you not
own she lov'd him? Yes, says the Daughter, be∣fore
she come to know what a Creature he was.
Well then, says her Father, if that be removed,
and he is become another Man, she will love him
again; for she had no other Objection against him,
had she? No, Sir, says the Daughter, she had no
other Objection, but she will never believe him,
<PB N="156" REF="163"/>
let his Pretences to Religion be what they will<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Why so, <HI>says the Father?</HI> Because, Sir, he cold her
that if he had known her Mind, he would
have pretended a world of Reformation and Reli∣gion,
and that he did not doubt but he could be
Hypocrite enough to cheat her.</P>
<P>Nay, if he has been so foolish, I know not what
to say to it, says the Father; let it rest as it is; if
she will not have him, whether he be religious, or
not religious, then the Objection of his being not
religious, was a Sham and a Cloak, and she stands
out in meer Obstinacy against her own Interest,
purely to affront her Father; let her so on, till she
comes to be convinced by her own Misfortune, I'll
meddle no more about it.</P>
<P>The eldest Sister sail'd not to relate this Story
very particularly to her Sister, who very gravely
musing on the Particulars, answer'd her Sister thus,
after several other sober and religious Expressions.</P>
<P>Dear Sister, says she, this Thing has been Af∣fliction
enough to me, but my Father's Conduct
has always made it double; because he cannot talk
of it without Resentment and Unkindness: If it
be really so, that this is the Gentleman Mrs. B—
told us the Story of Yesterday, I should rejoyce;
nay, tho' I am loth to be cheated, and what he
said of playing the Hypocrite with me, has made
me the more backward to give Credit to Outsides,
yet were I sure it was a real Work of God in him,
and that he was become a religious Gentleman,
you know I have Affection enough to rejoyce on
my own Account, and to entertain him after an∣other
Manner than before: But yet two Things
make it still remote from me, <HI>First,</HI> That I have no
Demonstration of the Truth of the Fact: And,
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That if it is so, he has made no Step to∣wards
me, and perhaps never may; and you know,
<PB N="157" REF="164"/>
Sister, <HI>continued she,</HI> 'tis no Business of mine till he
does.</P>
<P>Why that's true, <HI>says the eldest Sister,</HI> but what
must be done then?</P>
<P>Done, <HI>says she,</HI> let it alone; let it rest, till we
hear something or other of it in the ordinary way
of such things.</P>
<P>But what must we do with my Father? <HI>says the
eldest</HI> for for he is always talking to me about ic.</P>
<P>Do! <HI>says the other,</HI> give the same Anfwer to him
from me, as I do to you.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>says the eldest,</HI> I am sure he will never rest
till he brings it about again, for he is strangely in∣tent
upon it.</P>
<P>Let that be as pleases God, I will be wholly
neuter, <HI>says the youngest Sister.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after this Discourse, the Father, hav∣ing
some occasion for his Health, went down to
the <HI>Bath,</HI> and taking all his Daughters with him,
they continued there some Months, in which Time
they contracted an intimate Acquaintance with a
Lady and her two Daughters, who came thither
from <HI>Hampshire:</HI> The old Lady had been a Widow
of a Gentleman of Quality, by whom she had
had two Daughter, but was now married to an
eminent Clergyman in the Country where she
liv'd; and they were all together at the <HI>Bath,</HI> and
lodg'd in the same Apartments with these Ladies.</P>
<P>It happen'd one Day after Dinner, talking free∣ly
together about marrying religious Husbands and
Wives, the eldest Daughter, as what is always
much upon the Mind, will be in. Proportion much
upon the Tongue, insisted in Discourse, upon the Mi∣sery
of unequal Matches, and how unhappy it was,
either to Husband or Wife, when a religious, pious
sincere Christian, whether Man or Woman, was
married to another who had no Sense of Religion,
<PB N="158" REF="165"/>
and she gives a long Account of a Relation of
their Father's, but without naming their Aunt, how
good a Husband she had in all other Respects, how
comfortably and pleasantly they liv'd, but only for
that one Thing; and then she told them (still with∣out
naming any Body) how many odd Tricks Sir
<HI>James</HI> serv'd his Lady, and the like.</P>
<P>Well, Madam, <HI>says the old Clergyman,</HI> I can tell
you such a Story of a Lady in our County, as I
believe you never heard the like, I do not know
the Woman, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> but I know the Gen∣tleman
intimately well, and have had a great deal
of religious Conversation with him upon the Oc∣casion
I shall tell you of.</P>
<P>He courted a young Lady, <HI>says the Dector,</HI> but
whether she liv'd in our Country, or the City, or
Where, he is perfectly mute, only that he often
tells her Christian Name; and seeing he seems re∣solved
to conceal her Person, no body will be so
rude to press him on that Head.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> is of a very good
Family, has a noble Estate, a comely Person, and
a compleat courtly Education, and till this happen'd,
was almost always at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>His Mistress must be little less than an Angel in
human Shape, by his Descrtption, but that we give
no heed to; for, Madam, <HI>says the old Doctor,</HI> you
know Men in Love give themselves a Liberty that
way: But however, after all Things were agreed,
and the Writings drawing, it seems, she threw him
off intirely, and refused him meerly because she
found he was a Man of no Religion.</P>
<P><HI>Says the eldest Sister,</HI> How could she know that,
Sir? he was not so foolish to tell her so himself, I
suppose.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="166"/>
Yes, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> he did: Why then, <HI>says the
Sister,</HI> I suppose he was very indifferent whether
his had her or no. Indeed, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> one
would think so, <HI>and I said so to him;</HI> but he told me
that it was so far horn that, that he had taken up
his Resolution never to have any other Woman, if
she were the richest, best and most beautiful Crea∣ture
alive.</P>
<P>Then perhaps the Lady has a superiour Fortune
to him besides her other Qualifications, <HI>says the
Sister.</HI> No, just the contrary, <HI>says the Doctor.</HI> But,
Mad m, <HI>says he,</HI> I'll tell you the History of this
Gentleman, it it is net too long for you, 'tis a
Story cannot, be unprofitable to any one to hear,
especially <HI>to you Ladies,</HI> who have taken up such
happy Resolutions about marrying none but religi∣ous
Husbands. <HI>The Ladies bow'd,</HI> in Token they
desired him to go on with his Story. <HI>So the Doctor
ment on.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing touch'd this Gentleman so near, <HI>says he,</HI>
after be was gone from his Misrress, as to reflect
what kind of a Wretch or Monster he was, that a
vertuous young Lady, and one who he had Reason
to believe had no dislike of him, should be afraid
to marry him for fear of being ruin'd, and that she
should think if she took him, she declared War a∣gainst
Heaven, and renounc'd all Pretensions of
Duty to her Maker—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here he related the whole Story, his Talk, with him∣self, the Discourse at the Chocolate house, his Retreat into the Country, his happening to hear the poor Countryman at Prayer, his Conversation with him upon the Way, and
his Conduct afterward, all in the Manner as related be∣fore;</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="167"/>
We must suppose the Sisters to have <HI>much less</HI>
Sense of Religion than they were known to have;
and particularly less Sense of the Case it self, in
which it was easy to know they were nearly con∣cerned,
if they were not very much moved with
the Particulars of this Story; and no sooner had the
Doctor finish'd his Relation, with some very hand
some Reflections upon it; but the Sisters long'd
to withdraw, to compare their own Thoughts
together, <HI>where they could do it with Freedom.</HI></P>
<P>But the eldest Daughter, who, tho' perhaps her
Curiosity was not greater than her Sister's, yet as
her Courage was greater, and her Concern in it
less, she was resolved to get the Name of this Gen∣tleman,
if possible, accordingly, at length, she ask'd
the Doctor, if the Name of this Gentleman was a
Secret? No, Madam, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> the whole
Neighbourhood know the Story in general, and it
is nothing at all to his Dishonour. No indeed, Sir,
<HI>says she,</HI> but just the contrary; and if it was other∣wise,
I would not have ask'd his Name. Indeed,
Madam, <HI>says the Doctor,</HI> his Name is no Secret; it
is Mr.—the eldest Son of Sir <HI>Thomas—,</HI> by
whom he enjoys an Estate of 2000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, and
after his Uncle, who is very old, he has near a
thousand pound a year more intail'd upon him.</P>
<P>The two Sisters had heard too much to hold
any longer, <HI>the younger especially,</HI> who pretending
some Indisposition, withdrew, and her Sister soon
after: When her Sister came to her, she said, <HI>Well,
Child, what do you say to this Story?</HI> There's no room
to think there can be any Design in this old Gen∣tleman,
or any Hypocrisy in the Particulars, it they
are true.</P>
<P>Her Sister said never a Word, but she found she
had been crying, and that she was still too full of
it to speak; so she let her alone a while, till, after
<PB N="161" REF="168"/>
after some time, fetching a great Sigh, which gave
her Passions some Vent, <HI>says the youngest,</HI> Why,
what do you say to it? I say to it! <HI>says the eldest
Sister,</HI> I can say neither less or more to it than what
the two Disciples said to one another, going to
<HI>Emmaus,</HI> about our Saviour's Discourse to them, af∣ter
he was gone, <HI>Did not our Hearts burn within us
when he talked to us?</HI> I am sure mine did, <HI>says she,</HI>
Ay, and mine too, <HI>says the youngest:</HI> But it's all
nothing to me, now. Nay, says the eldest Sister,
if all the Story be true, it may be something to
you still; for you see, <HI>the Doctor says,</HI> he is resolv'd
to have no Body else. I give no heed to that, <HI>says
the youngest Sister,</HI> for the Tables are quite turn'd
now between us, and he ought to <HI>refuse me now,</HI>
for the very same Reason that I <HI>refused him before;</HI>
for I have not Religion enough for such a Convert
as this, I am sure, any more than a Man without
any Notion of a Deity, had Religion enough for
me. Well, well, says her Sister, let Providence,
which brings all things to pass its own Way, work
as he fees sit; I dare say, <HI>as my Aunt said,</HI> we shall
hear more of it.</P>
<P>They had very little Discourse at that Time but
what ended thus: But the eldest Sister had a great
mind her Father should hear the Story too, if pos∣sible
before they left the Place, and she resolved
to take an Opportunity to bring it about, it she
could; but she was happily prevented by the For∣wardness
of her Father to complain of his Daugh∣ter's
Nicety on all Occasions; for in Discourse with
the Doctor and his Lady, the young Ladies on both
sides being absent, he took a Liberty to exclaim ve∣hemently,
how foolish one of his Daughters had
been, and how she had obstinately cast off a Gen∣tleman
of such and such Qualifications, <HI>as before.</HI>
My Dear, says the Doctor's Lady to him, Pray
<PB N="162" REF="169"/>
tell Mr.—the Story you told die young Ladies
Yesterday: With all my Heart, said the Doctor,
so he repeated the whole Story.</P>
<P>The Father was exceedingly surprized at the
Particulars, but more when <HI>the Doctor</HI> told him the
Name of the Gentleman; However? he held his
Tongue, as it happen'd, and did not let the Doctor
know how near it related to his Family; but in the
Evening, taking his Opportunity, he calls his eldest
Daughter to him, <HI>Hark ye,</HI> Betty, says he, <HI>Did the
Doctor tell you a Story t'other Day of a Gentleman in</HI>
Hampshire? Yes, Sir, says she: <HI>And was your Sister
by?</HI> says he Yes, Sir, says she: And <HI>do you know
that this is the same Mr.—that we know of?</HI> says her
Father: Yes, Sir, says she, he told us his Name: <HI>Well,</HI>
and <HI>what does your Sister say to it?</HI> says he: She says
little, Sir, <HI>says his Daughter;</HI> but she cannot but be
mov'd with it, for 'tis a surprizing Story. <HI>I dare say,</HI>
says her Father, <HI>I shall hear of him again;</HI> she won't
turn him off again, I hope; I am sure she does not
deserve him now. She says so herself, <HI>says the
Daughter,</HI> That he ought to refuse her now, for
the same Reason that she refused him. <HI>Well,</HI> says
the Father, <HI>we shall certainly hear of him again, I am
fully persuaded;</HI> he will have no Rest till he comes
to see for her again.</P>
<P>A few, Weeks after this they returned to <HI>London,</HI>
and the eldest Sister being impatient to see her
Aunt, and to give her some Account of these
Things, they went both away to <HI>Hampstead:</HI> When
they came thither, file failed not to give her Aunt
a particular Account of all these Passages, as well
that which had happen'd at their Visit to the Mer∣chant's
Lady in <HI>London,</HI> as what had happen'd at
the <HI>Bath;</HI> all which, but especially the last, were
wonderfully surprising and agreeable to their Aunt.
<HI>Well, Niece,</HI> says the Aunt to the youngest Sister,
<PB N="163" REF="170"/>
<HI>what do you think of all these things?</HI> I can say little
to them, Madam, says she; I am glad, For his sake,
that God has open'd his Eyes. But is it no Satis∣faction
to you, <HI>Child, says her Aunt,</HI> that you have
been so far the Instrument of it? <HI>Alas! Madam,
says she,</HI> I the Instrument! I have been none of the
Instrument, not I. Yes, yes, <HI>replies her, Aunt,</HI> you
have, and he acknowledges it too: And turning
to the eldest Sister, <HI>says she,</HI> I think, Child, now
you may perform your Promise, and tell your
Sister what he said to you when he call'd here as
he went out of Town. Yes, Madam, <HI>says she,</HI> so
I think too<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she gives her Sister a full Accounts of what he had said, as before.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I think you might have told me this before, <HI>says
the younger Sister.</HI> Nay, Sister, <HI>reply'd she,</HI> Did you
not take me short, and forbid me telling you any
thing, and withdraw out of the Room, and bid
me tell it my Aunt? Why that's true, I did so, <HI>says
she again,</HI> and I have been so confus'd, that I know
not when I do well, and when I do ill: Indeed,
Niece, <HI>says her, Aunt,</HI> I also obliged her not to tell
you; for I concluded, if there was any thing in
it, we should hear of it again, and if we did not,
it could do you no Service.</P>
<P>While they were talking thus, a Coach stopt at
the Door, and a Servant brought word their Fa∣ther,
and another Gentleman with him, was below
Stairs.</P>
<P>It will be necessary here to leave this Part a while,
and bring forward the Story of the young Gentle∣man,
as far as it is needful to the Coherence of
Things, the Story also will be very short.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="171"/>
The young Gentleman having, as has been said,
taken his new Tutor, the poor Countryman, into
the House with him, received so much Assistance
from his Advice, and had daily such Instruction in
religious Things, from, the wholsome plain Coun∣sels
of this humble poor Creature, that the Benefit
of them soon appeared in his Conversation, and
his Reformation soon became visible in the gene∣ral
Course of his Life, he kept Company with
the soberest, gravest, and most religious Persons
that ho could find; he kept a most sober, regular,
reformed Family, and seeming to resolve, to reside
pretty much there, for the better Government of
his Family, he took in a young Minister of an ex∣traordinary
good Character to be his Chaplain, and
caused every Servant who appeared disorderly or
vicious to be put away out of his House.</P>
<P>These, as the natural Consequences of a sincere
Work upon his own Mind, were the visible Product
of that blessed Change, and indeed an agreeable
Evidence of the Sincerity of it; but they were
far from being the Sum of Things; for, in a word,
he proved to be a most pious sincere Christian in
all his Ways; and as this was attended with a na∣tural
Sweetnefs in his Disposition, Modesty and
Generosity in his Manner, and an excellent Tem∣per,
free from all manner of Pride or Hypocrisy,
it made him perfectly agreeable to all sorts of Peo∣ple
I those who were not like him valued and ho∣noured
him, and the sober, religious Part of Men
were delighted in him beyond expressing.</P>
<P>He went on thus for near two year, liv'd gene∣rally
in the Country, and if he came to <HI>London,</HI>
as Occasion requir'd, yet it appeared that his
Choice was rather for the Country, especially, be∣cause
he could not be long from his faithful As∣sistant
the poor Countryman, who was upon all
<PB N="165" REF="172"/>
Occasions, as we may say, Clerk of the Closet to
him, and with whom he kept up a most religious
but secret Conversation, and had Retirements with
him, which none were acquainted with but them∣selves.</P>
<P>But in all this Enjoyment of himself and the retir'd
Life he had now plac'd his Delight in, he found
something still wanting too, as well to complete his
Happiness here, as to forward his Progress in things
of an eternal and durable Nature, and he began to
say to himself, that he had robb'd himself of much
of his Comfort, in neglecting so long to have the
Assistance of that blessed Creature, who God had
made the first Instrument to touch his Mind with a
Sense of good Things.</P>
<P>These Thoughts dwelt upon his Heart a great
while, and he found himself very uneasy: It oc∣curr'd
to him, that certainly, as it had pleased God
to make that young Woman give him the Alarm,
and strike his Soul with the first Sense of his
wretched Condition, he had certainly furnish'd
her for his farther Assistance, and made her capa∣ble
of giving him farther Help, Light and Direc∣tions
in his Duty? and that he stood in the Way
of his own Comforts all the while he was without
her; nay, that he seemed to reject the Instrument
by which God had done him so much Good, with∣out
inquiring whether God had designed her for
his farther Benefit or no.</P>
<P>He reflected how suitable a Disposition she was
of in religious Things, to the Design he had of
keeping up a religious Family, and how admirable
a Wife, a Mother, a Mistress, such a Lady must
needs be to him, and his whole House; who now
saw the Truth of that excellent Sentence she had
after repeated to him, <HI>viz. That a religious Life was
the only Heaven upon Earth.</HI> He discoursed all these
<PB N="166" REF="173"/>
Things with his faithful Counsellor poor <HI>William,</HI>
who pressed him by all the Persuasions he could use
to go and make her his own; for it was the only
Fear <HI>William</HI> said he had for him, that he would
marry some Lady, who having been brought up in
the usual Levity of the Times, would pull him
backward, rather than forward him in his religious
Resolutions.</P>
<P>With these Thoughts he resolved to go to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and apply himself immediately to his former
Mistress, and obtain her for his own, if possible;
but was exceedingly disappointed, when he found
she and her Father, and all the Family, were
gone to the <HI>Bath.</HI></P>
<P>However he waited, and hearing of their Re∣turn,
he went immediately to make his Visit, with∣out
any Ceremony: When he found she was abroad,
he fell to work seriously with her Father; he told
him, that the last Time he was there, he had in∣deed
promised to wait on her again, but had not
yet clone it, for which he was come now to ask
her Pardon, and to give her the Reason of it, and
hoped he would give him Leave to fee his Daugh∣ter
again, notwithstanding what had past. Her
Father told him he had received an Account how
his Daughter had us'd him; that he was in the
Country when it happen'd, otherwise he should
have concern'd himself to have secured him better
Treatment; that he had resented it so already to
his Daughter, that he had scarce been in Speaking-Terms
with her since; that as to his Promise of
coming again, he believed she was convinc'd that
she had no Reason to expect it, seeing no Gentle∣man
would care to be ill us'd twice upon the same
Occasion. The young Gentleman answer'd, That
she was very forry he should resent any thing from
his Daughter on his Account; that he was surpriz'd
<PB N="167" REF="174"/>
to hear him say she had ill us'd him; that upon his
Word she had not done or said the least unbecom∣ing
thing to him; that he was even then when she
did it, fully convinc'd of the Reasonableness of
what she had said, and ten times as much, <HI>if that
were possible,</HI> of the just Motives she had to say it to
him; that if she had done less, she would have
acted from meaner Principles than he knew she was
the Mistress of, and that her Reasons were so good,
and she so well maintain'd them, that he had nei∣ther
then, or now, the least thing to offer against
them, and that his Business was not now to answer
her Arguments, but to see if he could comply bet∣ter
with the just Demands she then made, than he
could before.</P>
<P>The Father answer'd with a great many Compli∣ments
and Excuses, and such like Discourses; but the
Gentleman found that he neither relish'd the Reason
of his Daughter's Refusal, or was affected at all with
all he could say to convince him how he had taken
it; and Modesty forbidding him to go farther in
any Declaration about religious Matters, especi∣ally
where he found there was no Taste of it, he
declin'd saying any more about it, but turn'd his
Discourse to desiring another Interview with his
Daughter upon the Terms of former Proposals,
which the Father consenting to, they went toge∣ther
in the young Gentleman's Chariot to <HI>Hamp∣steads,</HI>
where the young Ladies were, and this was
the Gentleman, who, as I observed, was come to
the Door with their Father, just as they were above
talking of him with their Aunt.</P>
<P>I had given an Account before, that they heard
a Coach stop at the Gate, and that a Servant
brought up word, that, their Father and another
Gentleman was below stairs: But they were sur∣priz'd,
you may be sure, when the eldest Sister,
<PB N="168" REF="175"/>
going down first, comes running up stairs again,
with the News, in short, that it was Mr.—,
and that their Father had brought him.</P>
<P>The Aunt, unwilling her Niece should appear
in any Disorder, says to her, <HI>Come, Child, you two
shall stay a little, and let me go down first,</HI> which the
younger Sister was very glad of. It was easy to
perceive, and the Passages already related will al∣low
us to suppose, that altho' it was some Surprize
to the young Lady to have him come thus sudden∣ly
and abruptly upon her, having not prepar'd her
Thoughts, or resolv'd upon what Reception to
give him, and not having the least Intimation from
her Father upon what Account he came, yet that
she was not alarm'd <HI>as she us'd to be;</HI> the Scruples of
her Conscience were all answer'd; her Jealousies
of his Hypocrisy were over; and her Affection
had little or nothing to struggle with now, unless
she might doubt his Resentment of Things past, and
whether he came upon the old Account, or rather
to perform his Promise, and make a Visit of Cere∣mony
only: However, she beg'd her Sister to speak
to her Aunt, that they might stay at her House,
and that she might receive his Visits there, because
then she would have her Aunt to advise and con∣sult
with, on every Occasion, and then that she
would put off their being left together that Night,
that she might consider Things a little, and know
the better how to receive him.</P>
<P>Her Sister went down, and sending for her Aunt
into another Room, proposed the first to her; let
me alone, <HI>Niece,</HI> for that, <HI>says she:</HI> So the other
went up to her Sister, and soon after the Father
calling for his two Daughters, they went down in∣to
the Room. It was easy for her at first sight, to
perceive that <HI>her Lover</HI> was not at all alter'd in his
Affection to her; that he did not come to her with
<PB N="169" REF="176"/>
Resentment, or with Ceremony; for he flew to
her, took her in his Arms, and told her, he came
to see if she had Goodness enough to pardon his
not keeping his Word with her, in coming to wait
on her again, and also to claim her Promise <HI>of stay∣ing
for him:</HI> He spoke this so softly, as not to be
heard by the Company, and without expecting any
Answer, turn'd about to pay his Respects to her
Aunt; in doing which, he told her, he hop'd she
would give him Leave to wait upon her Niece ac
her House.</P>
<P>The Aunt took the Hint, and turning to the
Father, Brother, says she to him privately, I think
if you would let my Niece stay here some time,
and let the Gentleman come to wait on her here,
I would take care to prevent such little Scruples as
you know interrupted that Affair before, and you
will the sooner bring it to an End, according to
your Mind. With all my hearty says, the Father;
if we had done so before, I believe she had not
play'd the Fool as she did.</P>
<P>Upon this, turning themselves to the Company,
<HI>she says aloud,</HI> Niece, <HI>I don't intend to lose your Com∣pany
thus;</HI> I suppose if this Gentleman designs to
visit you, he won't think it a great way to come to
<HI>Hampstead,</HI> which, now the Roads are so good, is
not above an Hour's driving; and I hope we shall
not make his Entertainment so ill, as to make him
weary of coming hither. Her Niece said, that
must be as her Father pleased to direct; <HI>I know that
says her Aunt;</HI> and therefore I have got your Fa∣ther's
Consent already. They bow'd both to her
in Token of Assent, and Night coming on, her
Father talk'd of going away; so he cold her he
would take another Opportunity to wait on her,
which was what she had desired. And thus ended
their first Meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="177"/>
They had scarce din'd the next Day, but, as he
had said, he came to visit her, and they had the
whole Afternoon to themselves, and from that
Day they began to understand one another so well,
that in a few Weeks Matters began to draw to a
Close. But because some Part of their Discourse is
necessary to finish the former Account, and may be
as useful as it is entertaining, I shall give some
of the Particulars, as they occurr'd in Discourse
between her and her Aunt and Sister, upon this
Occasion: As she had advis'd with her Sister and
Aunt upon every Particular, and especially with
her Sister, from the first of it; so she made no Scru∣ple
to give them a full Account of Things as they
past. It was one Morning, after the Gentleman
had been above a Week in his new Addresses, that
coming into her Aunt's Dressing-room, she found
her Sister there drinking Coffee with her Aunt,
and her Sister began with her thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, you us'd to be free with
<HI>a body,</HI> and tell one now and then, how things went
with you; now we hear nothing from you; what
is it all to be a Secret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Niece, you ought not to press your
Sister to give an account of such Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>When she wanted Advice, <HI>Madam,</HI> she
was open enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>For my Part I wish her as well as I do my
own Children; but I cannot desire her to give any
Account of such Things, unless she wants Advice
in any thing, and then she's a Judge of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Madam, if I have not told any
thing, or every thing, both to you and my Sister,
it has not been by way of Reserve; I am ready to
give you a full Account of all you desire; for there
is nothing passes between us, that need be con∣ceal'd
<PB N="171" REF="178"/>
from you that are so near to me: As for my
Sister, I told her every Passage before; and as for
you, Madam, did I not desire to be here, that I
might consult and advise with you, and have your
Directions in every Step? and I have wonder'd
you never ask'd about it before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>The chief Thing I want to know is,
how you find him as to the grand Affair of Reli∣gion,
and whether you think him a Hypocrite,
or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's what I am curious about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am but an ill Judge of Sincerity, es∣pecially
in a Case where my Inclinations, you
know, are partial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you were the nicest Creature a∣live
before, Sister; and yet, you know, your Af∣fections
were the same way then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Niece, what can you say to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, my Sister takes it quite wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I take you wrong, Sister?
Did you not conclude him to be an Atheist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I never said he was a Hypocrite;
If he had been no honester than he was politick,
I had been effectually deceived; for it was too
true, as he said, if he had talk'd a little religiously,
nay, if he had not openly profest his Contempt
of all Religion, he had cheated me, and I had ne∣ver
made any Objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; you are right, Cousin: But
how stands it now? are all the Stories you told
me you heard at the <HI>Bath</HI> about him true, or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, I believe they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you but at believe still? I would
have had the bottom of them all out by this time;
what have you been about all this while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="172" REF="179"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, we have spent all the Time al∣most
about the great Difficulty of judging whether
he is sincere, or a Hypocrite; and we are scarce
got through it yet, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I think my Sister is mad:
What kind of Confession of Principles do you in∣sist
on pray? I hope you don't set up to examine
the Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You run all upon Mistakes with me,
Sister; the Dispute lies just the other Way, I am
for allowing him to be sincere, but he will not grant
that I have any Reason to do so; he says, that I
ought to believe he is a Hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, <HI>Niece,</HI> let us have the whole Story
of it? we shall then know how to judge of it to∣gether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam; you know
he came to me last Tuesday Night, when you first
left us together: After some Compliments, he re∣peated
what he had said before, that he came to ask
my Pardon for not coming again, as he had said
he would: I told him, I did not expect him to
come again; and if I was to believe the Opinion
of other People, I had used him so rudely, that
it was not reasonable to think that any Gentleman
that was so treated, would ever have come again,
unless it was to affront me. He wonder'd, <HI>he said,</HI>
who could pretend to say so; for <HI>he assur'd me,</HI> he
not only never said I us'd him ill, but never
thought so, and certainly I would not say so to
any body; for he was persuaded, <HI>he said,</HI> I did nei∣ther
do it on purpose to use him ill, or believe it
was ill Usage. <HI>I told him,</HI> he did me a great deal
of justice, to say I did not act on purpose to af∣front
him; but that I could not but say I thought
I had used him a little too rudely for all that; and
that if he thought so too, I was very ready to take
<PB N="173" REF="180"/>
this Opportunity to ask him Pardon, without so
much as naming the Necessity I was in on other
Accounts for doing what I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were very courtly in that Particular,
Niece; pray what did he say to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, I had nothing to ask him
Pardon for, and assured me he had not been gone
half an Hour from me, before he was convinc'd of
the Justice of all I had said, and how much Reason
I had to refuse him upon the Nicety which I had
refused him upon: He added, that he had a
thousand times since reproach'd himself with the
Folly of his own Conduct at that Time, or that
he could think it could recommend him to any
Woman of Vertue and Sense, to boast of having
no Thought or Sense of Religion: <HI>For,</HI> Madam,
says he, <HI>had you taken no Notice of it, I should of
Necessity have concluded in a quarter of art Hour after,
that you had no Sense of Vertue or Religion your self.</HI>
Why what if I had not, <HI>said I?</HI> I had been but the
more suitable to you, and you must have lik'd me
the better for that. He return'd, No, Madam,
<HI>just the contrary;</HI> for tho' I own I had not thought
of Religion my self, yet had any Woman told me
so of herself, I should presently have said, she was
no Match for a Gentleman; for no Man can be
so void of Sense, as well as of Religion, as not to
know that a Woman of no Religion, is no Woman
fit to make a Wife of: <HI>And this,</HI> says he, convinc'd
me that you were in the right to refuse me on that
Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a very ingenious Confession, I con∣fess;
the Truth of it is so convincing, that I wish
all the young Women, who have their Settlement,
in View, would reflect seriously on this Point, that
however wicked Men are, they are always willing
to have sober, religious and vertuous Wives; and
<PB N="174" REF="181"/>
'tis very rarely, that the worst Rake in Nature, if
his Senses are in Exercise, desires to have a Wife
loose like himself; but pray go on, <HI>Niece.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He told me, he was not gone a quarter
of an Hour from me, but this Reflection struck
with Horror upon his Mind; what a dreadful Crea∣ture
am I! sure I am a horrid srightful Wretch!
that a Woman of Sobriety and Religion was afraid
to venture to take me, for fear of being ruin'd;
and that she should think she declared War against
Heaven, and joyned herself to one of God's Ene∣mies:
He was going on, but I found his Speech
stop'd of a sudden; at which I was a little surpriz'd,
and ask'd him if he was not well: He said yes,
and endeavour'd to hide the little Disorder he was
in, and went on: He then told me, that I had
been really very just to him, and he had Reason to
thank me for it; and that he had desired my Sister
to express his Mind fully on that Account, which
he hop'd she had done. <HI>I told him,</HI> I could not
now enter upon an Apology for what I had said to
him <HI>so long ago;</HI> that if i treated him rudely or se∣verely,
I was very sorry; <HI>but that</HI> what I did was
occasion'd <HI>as be knew very well,</HI> upon his making
such open, Declarations, <HI>and such as I thought he re∣ally
had no Occasion for,</HI> concerning his Aversion to,
and Ignorance of all Religion; and that it was
really a dreadful thins to think of marrying on
such Terms; <HI>He reply'd,</HI> that if I had said less than I
did, he must: necessarity, <HI>when he came to his Senses,</HI>
have had a meaner Opinion of me than he had; and
that it was really the Reproaches that I had given
him, and the excellent Reasons I had given him,
for my Resolutions of rejecting him, that had now
brought him back to me, and had made him resolve to
have no Woman on Earth but me, <HI>if I would but
revoke the Resolutions I had taken against him;</HI> for no∣thing
<PB N="175" REF="182"/>
less than so much Religion and Vertue could
ever make him happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was sincere in this, I assure you,
Niece, it was a high Complement upon Religion,
as well as upon your Conduct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him, that as the Reason I had for
using him so was thus approved by himself, he
bound me to preserve the same Resolution on the
Hazard of his having a lefs Efteem for me. <HI>Hle
confess'd that was very true;</HI> unless he could convince
me the Cause Was removed, <HI>which he saw no hopes of,</HI>
and that was the Reason that he came to visit me
again, with so little Encouragement, that he knew
not what to think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he mean by that? why
sure then all we have heard must be false, and he is
the same Man as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was greatly startled at his Words, and
look'd steadily at him, but could judge nothing
from his Countenance: But it grew late, and he
took his Leave, falling into some other cursory
Talk, <HI>and left me,</HI> I confess, <HI>in the greatest Confusion
of Thoughts imaginable;</HI> for I was dreadfully afraid
he would declare himself to have no Sense of Re∣ligion
on his Mind still; and then I was in a worse
Condition than at first, having thus admitted a se∣cond
Treaty with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought, Child, you was a little per∣plex'd
a Tuesday Night; but I took it to be only
a little Thoughtfulness more than ordinary, which
is usual on such Occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he came again the next Night, he
made a kind of an Apology for having left me in
more Disorder than he us'd to do: <HI>For to tell you
true,</HI> Madam, says he, <HI>I was not able to go on with
what I was saying to you,</HI> neither am I now, <HI>says he,</HI>
seeing I am come to wait on you, <HI>and yet have ef∣fectually
<PB N="176" REF="183"/>
shut the Door against my self.</HI> I told him I
did not perhaps rightly understand him, unless he
would explain himself; Why, <HI>says be,</HI> I have first
tolds you sincerely, how abiolutely I approve the
Resolution you took against me, and yet own'd,
and <HI>do still,</HI> that I am no way able to convince you
that the Cause is removed. I told him, that I
thought he was not just to himself; and that the
same thing, whatever it was, that had Power to
convince him that I was under a Necessity to refuse
him on that Occasion, would certainly assist him to
remove the Cause. <HI>He turn'd short upon me,</HI> but,
Madam, <HI>said he,</HI> did I not make Conditions with
you, that whenever I talk'd of it, you should take
me for a Hypocrite? and did I not declare posi∣tively
to you, that I would deceive you if I could?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I know what he meant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, so did I too, but he run it up so
high against himself, that I could not answer a
Word, unless I would have turn'd the Tables, <HI>as it
were,</HI> against my self, and courted him, by telling
him how well I was satisfied of his Sincerity; so
that, in short, I was quite puzzled: For what
could I say to a Man that did as it were bid me be∣lieve
him to be a Hypocrite?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had a nice Case before you, Cousin;
pray what said you to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him <HI>very coldly,</HI> I was under a Ne∣cessity
of believing every thing he said, because he
had been so sncere with me all along; and I beg'd
him therefore not to tell me seriously <HI>now</HI> that he
was a Hypocrite; and that the Cause of my re∣fusing
to talk with him before was not removed:
that I hop'd it was otherwise, but should despair of
it, if it came from his own Mouth; and that if I was
assur'd from his own Mouth, that he came to de∣ceive
me, he must needs know I had nothing else
<PB N="177" REF="184"/>
to do, <HI>but to act as I did before,</HI> which he had
own'd I had Reason for. No, Madam, <HI>says he,</HI>
I do not say, I desire to deceive you; but, I say,
that having told you I would, you ought to believe
I design it; and I see no room to convince you
that I am not a Hypocrite, seeing I promis'd you
I would be so; and I know not whether I dare tell
you. that I am not so even in the best of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could have put an End to all this
Nicety in two Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you will tell me the easier, how I
shall do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I would have told him, that tho'
I had not so much Concern for him to busy my
self to inquire after his Conduct, yet I had not so
little, as not to be glad to know by other Hands
than his own, that he was no Hypocrite, and that
I rejoyc'd for his Sake to hear, that his Eyes were
open'd to that which could alone make him the
happiest Man alive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I must at the same time have told
him, that my Scruples were all over about him;
which was as much as to tell him I would have him
whenever he pleas'd to take me, but I han't learn'd
that way of talking yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Niece, and if you had, after so
long Acquaintance, and so much pressing, I do
not think you could have charg'd your self with
being forward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, you will the better like
what has happen'd since, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart; then pray go on, <HI>my
Dear.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Madam, this took up the first
three or four Nights of our Discourse: The
Night before last he, began a little more seriously,
and came closer to the Thing it self: He told me,
<PB N="178" REF="185"/>
he had made himself very melancholy with me the
two last Times he was with me; for he thought,
that instead of courting me to have me, he had
taken a great deal of Pains to court me to refuse
him again: I told him, I thought so too; and that
I confess'd I had been a little concern'd about it,
because I could by no means understand him: He
told me it proceeded from the just Reflection he
made on his foolish Discourse two Years ago, <HI>viz.
That he wish'd he had counterfeited religious Discourse;
and that he would certainly have cheated me if he could,
and did not doubt but he could have done it effectually.</HI> Those
Words, he faid, flew in his Face, when he went
to say any thing seriously to me; and persuaded
him that I would believe he was only counterfeit∣ing
serious Things on purpose to deceive me: I an∣swer'd,
he might reproach himself with those
Things, but I did not lay any Stress on them; for
I believed he had too much Honesty, whether it
proceeded from Religion or no, so offer to deceive
me in a Thing, in which he own'd so ingenuously I
was right. Then he told me, with the greatest
Affection in his Discourse that ever I saw in my
Life, that he must confess, as he had said before,
that my rejecting him, as I had done, had made Im∣pressions
on his Mind quite disferent from what he
had before; but that he found it the hardest thing
in the World to express what had happen'd to him
on that Account; and the Thoughts of those things
that had taken up his Mind since that; only this
he would own to me, that I was in the right; that
he had most notoriously exposed himself to me, and
that he had perfectly the same Opinion now of those
Things, which I had before, <HI>viz. That a religious Life
was the only Heaven upon</HI> Earth; but he could go no
farther, he said, nor could he answer for himself,
how far such Thoughts might carry him, or ex∣press
<PB N="179" REF="186"/>
to me the Particulars that had lain upon his
Mind about them; and how far what he had said
would satissy me, he did not know. I told him, I
hop'd he did not think, I set up for a Judge of the
Particulars; that my Objection before lay against
a general Contempt of all Religion; that it was
my Terror to think of marrying an Enemy to God,
one that had no Sense of the common Duty we
all owe to him that made us; but that I never pre∣tended
to expect a Confession of Faith from him,
or any Man, in such a Case: <HI>He told me,</HI> he thought
it required more Assurance than he was Master of,
to talk any thing of himself that way, at least till
there was more Intimacy between us; That he
thought religious Things talk'd of in that Manner
received an Injury from the very Discourse, and
that it was next door to boasting of them, which
was the worst kind of Hypocrisy; and if he could say
no more of himsself but this, he hop'd I would take
it for a suffcient Testimony of the Alteration of
his Thoughts, <HI>viz.</HI> That he loved me for the Ho∣nour
I paid to Religion, and for that Steadiness
which had made me refuse him before. I told him,
I saw his Difficulty, and that I would abate him
the Trouble of entring into Particulars, which I
found he was too modest to relate, and which
however I was not quite a Stranger to; and that I
desired we might speak no more of a Thing which
I knew it was difficult for him to be free in: He
blush'd as red as Fire, when I said I was not a
Stranger to the Particulars which he declined to
express, and said not one Word for a good while.
I told him, I knew it was a Point that could not
come easily from a Man's own Mouth; that I did
not desire it, and would make him easy, so far as
to tell him I was satisfy'd he was no Hypocrite,
and hop'd he would give himself no more Trouble
<PB N="180" REF="187"/>
about it. He took me in his Arms, and told me
very affectionately, that I had said that of him, that
he would give all the World to be able to say of
himself; that however he hop'd to be beholding to
me for more than that; and as I had given him
the first View of the Beauty of a religious Life,
he expected a great deal more from my Assistance
and Example, in pursuing the Steps of it. <HI>I told him,</HI>
that I begg'd of him we might avoid all religious
Complements, for they were the oddest things in
Nature; that he quite mistook me, <HI>that it was not</HI>
because I thought my self capable of guiding in
religious Matters, that I insisted on the Necessity
of not marrying a Man void of Religion, but
from a due Sense of just the contrary, <HI>viz.</HI> The
Want I should be in of being guided and assisted
in religious Things upon all Occasions my self:
That it would be a fatal Mistake the other way, and
greatly to my Disadvantage, to have him expect
more from me than he would find; and that on the
contrary I thought I had now so much less Reli∣gion
than he, that he ought to refuse me now, for
the same Reason that I refused him before.</P>
<P>This is the Sum of our Affair, and thus it stands,
only with this Addition, that he told me a very
pleasant Story, which happen'd at a Chocolate-house
near the Court, which is so useful, as well as
diverting, that I cannot but relate it to you<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she tells them the Story of the two Beaus and the Lord discoursing of the Suitableness of a religious Life to the Life of a Gentleman.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Thus far, I think, contains all the useful Part of
this Story, only adding, that it was not long after
this, both the Agreement and Settlement being
all in Readiness, the Father and all Friends
assenting, they were married; and lived afterwards
the happiest Couple that can be imagin'd; having
a sober, regular, well-govern'd Family, a most
pleasant, comfortable, agreeable Conversation with
one another, suitable in Temper, Desires, Delights,
and, in a Word, in every Thing else; and, which
made them compleatly happy, they were exemplar
in Piety and Virtue to all that knew them.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E have seen the happy Conduct of the
youngest of the three Daughters of
the Gentleman, whose Family this
Book began with; and the comfortable
Success of it: The second Daughter
from the Beginning acted upon other Principles,
or rather indeed upon no Principles at all; and her
History may perhaps be no less fruitful of Instruc∣tion
than the other, tho' something more tragical
as to her own Part of it.</P>
<P>She had declared to her Sister, as appears in the be∣ginning
of her Story, that she would not trouble her∣self,
when it came to her Turn, what Religion the
Gentleman was of, or whether he had any Religion,
<PB N="184" REF="190"/>
or no, if she had but a good Settlement; and now
we shall see her be as good as her Word.</P>
<P>Her Father, whose Character I have sufficiently
spoken to already, having had for many Years a
considerable Trade into <HI>Italy,</HI> where he once liv'd;
there came an <HI>English</HI> Gentleman to visit him, who
had formerly been Cotemporary with him, and
long been his Correspondent or Factor there, <HI>viz.</HI>
at <HI>Leghorn;</HI> and who being grown very rich, was
come to <HI>England,</HI> resolving to settle here. There
were some Accounts, it seems, depending between
them, which they had appointed a Day to settle
and balance, in order to exchange Releases, which
being all finish'd in the Morning, the Father of
these Ladies takes his Factor into his Coach, and
carries him Home to Dinner with him, where the
old Gentleman entertain'd him very handsomly,
and where he had an Opportunity to see the two
Maiden Daughters; for the youngest, who had
been marry'd some time, was gone into <HI>Hampshire</HI>
to her Country-Seat with her Husband.</P>
<P>This <HI>Leghorn</HI> Merchant no sooner saw and con∣vers'd
a little with the young Ladies, but he took
a Fancy to the youngest, and from that time re∣solv'd
to make her his Wife. It was not long, be∣fore
he let them know his Mind, and having made
very handsome Proposais to her Father, he (<HI>the Fa∣ther</HI>)
received him with a Frankness suitable to their
long Intimacy and Acquaintance, and told him,
with all his Heart, if his Daughter and he could
agree.</P>
<P>Before I bring them together, it is proper to the
Relish of the Story, to take a little Notice of the
Characters of the two young Persons, of whose
Story we ought to have a general Idea, that we may
not be left to gather it up slowly among the Par∣ticulars.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="191"/>
The young Lady was very sober, virtuous to
the nicest Degree, extremely well bred, and won∣derfully
good-humour'd; she was likewise a very
lovely, beautiful Person, the handsomest of the
three Sisters beyond all Comparison: As to Reli∣gion,
she had a very good Foundation of Know∣ledge,
and had done nothing to make it be sup∣posed
she was not truly religious in Practice; but
she was not altogether so grave and serious as her
elder Sister; much less was she so devout and strict
as her younger Sister that was married, as might
be observ'd from what pass'd between them at first:
Her Temper was sprightly and gay, and tho' she
govern'd herself so, that she gave every one room
to see, that she was one that had a true Sense of
Religion at bottom, and a Fund of good Princi∣ples
and good Notions in her Mind, yet she was
young and merry, and did not tye herself up so
severely in such Things as her Sisters had done;
which, tho' it was no Part of her Happiness in the
Affair before her, yet it render'd her very agree∣able
to her Father; and particularly, it made the
Affair with this Gentleman much easier to her Fa∣ther,
and he had much less Trouble with her, than
he had had with her two Sisters.</P>
<P>The Gentleman was, as I have observ'd, an
<HI>Italian</HI> Merchant, a very handsome, agreeable Per∣son,
perfectly well bred, having liv'd abroad, and
seen a great deal of the World: He was also a Man
of excellent Parts and Sense, talk'd admirably well
almost to every Thing that came in his Way; spoke
several Languages; and in short, was not a com∣plete
bred Merchant only, but much of a Gentle∣man;
and to all this was to be added, that he was
very sober, grave, and oftentimes, as occasion of∣fer'd,
his Discourse upon religious Affairs discover'd
him to be very serious and religious: As to his
<PB N="186" REF="192"/>
Estate, it was not very well only, but extraordi∣nary;
he was indeed a little too old, having liv'd
abroad about 22 Years, and was about so much a∣bove
twenty, which was the Age of the Lady:
However, as this was an Advantage in many other
Ways, in his Judgment and Experience in the
World, the Father made no Scruple at all of it,
nor did his Daughter inquire much after it.</P>
<P>In a Word, having been introduced to the young
Lady, she must have been a Woman of much more
Nicety and Scruple than she profess'd herself to be,
if she had dislik'd any thing in his Person or Cir∣cumstances;
and therefore having kept her Com∣pany
for some Weeks, Things began to draw to∣wards
a Close, when one Evening after the Gentle∣man
had been with her, and was gone away, her
eldest Sister and se happened to meet; and the
following Dialogue between them may farther ex∣plain
the Case.</P>

<P>Nay, hold, Sister; don't say so nei∣ther;
without doubt her Occasion was very
just; and you have the same Obligation upon you,
but I hope you have not the same Occasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what you mean by Obligation;
I have no Obligation at all upon me, as I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do you say so, Sister? I mean
the Obligation, which is upon us all from the Charge
my Mother gave us upon her Death-bed, about
our marrying religious Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I look upon what my Mother said to be
good Counsel, which we should give its due Weight
to; but I do not take it to be a Command that
binds me absolutely in Duty to my Mother's Word;
Duty certainly ends when Death separates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not whether it does, or no,
Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you are too superstitious that way,
Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but suppose it to be but as <HI>Ad∣vice,</HI>
yet it has a double Force with it: <HI>First,</HI> as it
came from a tender, dear and most affectionate
Mother, who not only most passionately lov'd us,
but had an excellent Judgment to direct her to give
us the best Counsel: And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> as our own
Judgment and Consciences must testify with her,
that what she enjoyn'd us to observe, is the most
reasonable necessary Thing for us to do that can be
imagin'd for our own Advantage, and as well for
our Happiness here as hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You lay a greater Stress upon it than I do,
I confess: If my Mother had been alive indeed, I
should have thought my self oblig'd to be guided
by her Directions, and her Injunctions would have
<PB N="189" REF="195"/>
been positive Commands; but then she would have
been able to judge of particular Circumstances, and
would have given her Advice accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her Advice to us was therefore
suited to her present State of Absence, and went
no farther than to a Cafe described by its own Cir∣cumstances,
and which nothing can alter, because
the Obligation supposes the Circumstance; and
where the Circumstance is not, the Obligation
ceases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk so learnedly, I want an Explana∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, you don't want an Expla∣nation
I am sure; but you are disposed to lay it all
aside, as a Thing you have no need of; however,
I'll explain my self in a Word speaking: Our Mo∣ther
warn'd us against marrying Men of no Reli∣gion,
<HI>that is,</HI> Men that made no Profession of a
Reverence to God and his Worship; this Want of
a religious Profession is the <HI>Circumstance</HI> which I
speak of; if the Circumstance does not appear,
the Advice ceases; for our Mother knew we could
not judge of Sincerity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; so then if a Man tells me he is re∣ligious,
it's well enough, whether he speaks Truth
or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What need we talk of this; I hope
you have an Assurance of the contrary in Mr.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not I, indeed; what Assurance can I
have? He seems to be a sober Man, that's all I
know of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I would know more of it
however, if I were you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I do know something more of it too,
now I think of it; for we were talking of such
Things one Night, when we happen'd to mention</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Robert</SPEAKER>
<P>—, and he spoke of him with a great
<PB N="190" REF="196"/>
deal of Indignation; he said he was a horrid Athe∣istical
Wretch, and that he could not bear his
Company; for he was always making a Jest of
sacred Things, bantering all Religion in such a
Manner, that no sober Mind could abide it with∣out
Horror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there is something in that, I
assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I take it for a plain Declaration, that
he has a just Reverence for Religion, as my Sister
took the contrary in her Lover for a Declaration of
his having no Religion at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, he told her he <HI>had not,</HI> in so ma∣ny
Words, and that he had not troubled his Head
about it, and did not intend to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, and this Gentleman has told me
he has; for he owns he has so much Regard for
Religion, that he cannot hear it ridicul'd and ban∣ter'd
without Horror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is something, I confess, in gene∣ral:
But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what? What would you have me do?
Must I examine his Principles and Opinions? Shall
I ask him to say his Catechism? If I should talk on
that Fashion to him now, what a kind of a cateche∣tical
Wife will he think I shall make; he'll think I
shall be a Schoolmistress rather than a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; tho' you are so pert with
your Sister forsooth, you need not be so with him,
I hope, nor need I tell you how to manage such a
Point; but I warrant you I would find it out, what
his Opinion was, one way or another; why he
may be a Papist for ought you know yet of him;
some of them are very religious in their Way, and
speak very reverently and seriously of Religion in
general.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="191" REF="197"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let him be a Papist and he will, I am sure
I can never ask him such a Question; but how∣ever
I am pretty well satisfied of that too; for I
heard him say once, he had been at Church; and
another time, accidentally speaking about Religion,
he declared he wa a Member of the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> as by Law establish'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you are an easy Lady; a little
Matter satisfies you; I should pretently have said,
I hope, Sir, you mean the Protestant Church of
<HI>England?</HI> Why you do not imagine, the Roman
Catholick think the Popish Church is the only
Church of <HI>England</HI> that is establish'd by Law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Sister, you take all the World to be
Hypocrites and Cheats; I never can suspect any
Gentleman, that bears the Character of an honest
Man, would set up to impose upon me with such
equivocal Speeches; why I never heard such a vile
Distinction in my Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you not? why then I have; I
have heard, that in King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second's Time
People in general were deluded with that very Ex∣pression
in all their publick Speeches, Proclamati∣ons,
Declarations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> promising always to pre∣serve
and maintain the Church of <HI>England</HI> as esta∣blish'd
by Law, and that yet all that while they
meant the Popish Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are remote Things, Sister, from my
Part; I have no Mistrust; I am honest my self,
and I suspect no body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a thing of Moment, Sister; I
would be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I; I have no room to suspect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you do not answer the Obliga∣tion
you were under to my Mother's Desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I do; for I think I have good Reason
to believe him a very serious religious Gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="192" REF="198"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know my Mother engaged us
to examine Particulars, and not to marry any Man,
how religious soever he seemed also, unless he was
of the same Opinion in Religion with ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that I think my Mother went too far,
Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Mother gave us a great many Ex∣amples
of the Misery, that has followed in the rela∣tion
of Husband and Wife, by reason only of Dif∣ferences
in Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must be where there was but little Reli∣gion
on either Side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know that neither; you and
I know some Families, more than one or two,
where they are all at Daggers draw about Opinion,
and the Families are ruin'd as to their Peace, and
yet both are very religious too, nay zealous in their
Way; and the more the Zeal, the more the Strife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be Zeal, but there is no Cha∣rity
then; and what's any Religion without Cha∣rity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but because Charity does not al∣ways
keep pace with Religion, and every one is
apt to think themselves in the right, and to reproach
the Sincerity of those that differ from them; there∣fore
our Mother earnestly press'd us to make that
Point sure, before we fixt our Choice for our
Lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a fine Thing to talk of, but hard to be
followed; what have I to do with his Opinion?
and what can I say to him, if he tells me he is of
one Opinion, and should be of another? you, nor
no young Body alive, can prevent being impos'd
upon, if a Man finds it for his Purpose to deceive
us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="193" REF="199"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, you trample upon all
Caution; you are one of them that seem perfectly
indifferent whether you are deceived or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, I am not willing to be deceiv'd
you see; I have had a general Discovery of his be∣ing
a Man religiously inclined, that has a Reve∣rence
for the Worship of God, and the Being of
God; nay, you cannot but remember how the
other Night at Supper he discours'd very gravely,
and I assure you, to me it was very agreeably, a∣bout
the Men of the Town first pretending to be
Atheists, and to deny the Being of a God, and the
next Minute prophanely swearing by his Name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this is true, and clears you from
the first Scruple; so far I may grant you are with∣in
my Mother's first Injunction, not to marry a
Man that does not profess to be religious in gene∣ral;
but that is but one Part, what say you to the
other, Not to marry any Man, however professing
himself to be religious, that is not of the same
Opinion with your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will carry every thing up to the Ex∣tremity;
but however I have a Way for that too;
and you shall not charge me with slighting my
Mother's Advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Way have you got? I doubt 'tis
but an odd one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if he will not be of my Opinion, I'll
be of his Opinion, and so we will agree one way,
if we can't t'other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's boldly said, and I must own to
you, signifies you are yet to choose in your own
Opinion: Pray what if he should be a Roman Ca∣tholick,
as I hinted before? you know he has liv'd
in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="194" REF="200"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well if he should be a Christian Catholick,
I am a Catholick Christian, so we need not fall
out <HI>for all that.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perswade my self you are not so in∣different
as you make your self, or else (which I
hope rather) you are jesting with me, or you talk
thus upon a Supposition, that you are sure he is a
Protestant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well you are in the right there too; I can∣not
entertain such Thoughts of him; besides my
Father told me he was a Protestant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is our Misfortune, Sister, that my
Father does not much concern himself about those
things; he leaves us to our Fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is that our Misfortune say you? I do
not see it, I confess; for I think 'tis our Business to
choose for our selves; and I observe where Fathers
are so very strait-lac'd, and confine their Children to
such and such Particulars in the Husbands or Wives
they shall choose, their Children generally choose
without much Regard to those Injunctions, or else
fly directly in the Face of them, and go quite
contrary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You argue, Sister, from the Practice
to the Duty, as if because Children do not regard
the Care and Concern of their Parents in their
Marriages, therefore they ought to do so; and that
it was not the Duty of Parents to Direct them, or
to concern themselves about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not inquire what is the Duty of Pa∣rents;
I am speaking of what is the Practice of
Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you do not justify that Practice, I
hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, <HI>take one time with another,</HI> Children
do as well, when they trust to their own Directi∣ons,
I mean when they choose with Judgment:
<PB N="195" REF="201"/>
Pray what would become of us, if we were just to
follow our Father's Direction? you know he would
direct us to take the first that comes, if he lik'd but
the Settlement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a wrong way of arguing, Sister,
that because our Father neglects it, therefore Chil∣dren
are not the better for such Parents as do their
Duty, and that shew a just Concern for the religi∣ous
Happiness of their Children, in se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tling them
in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see much Difference, I say, but
sometimes one do as well as the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, there is this Difference, Sister,
that where the Parents act right, the Children are
seldom ruin'd, unless it be by their own wilful Ob∣stinacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And sometimes Children are ruin'd, let the
Parents do their best; nay, sometimes the Parents
themselves know not what to direct.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may as well say, that because
Doctors die no body should take Physick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one has Eyes to choose for themselves;
I don't think the Proverb has any Weight in this
Case, that <HI>Love is blind;</HI> Folks may easily see the
Difference between a religious Man and an Atheist
without their Parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is a Matter of such Weight, and
so irrecoverable when done, that we ought to see
with as many Eyes as we can; and a careful reli∣gious
Parent is a good Scout to look out for us, a
good Pilot to steer us, and a good Counsellor to
advise us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't see the Want of it, perhaps, so much
as you do; I see sometimes the very Mistake of the
Parent is the Cause of the Ruin of the Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="196" REF="202"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess I do see the Want of it,
and I think it is a sad thing to be left so as we are,
without the Guide of our Parents, for all that;
and if we in particular should be ruin'd by it, our
Father would have small Satisfaction in his own
Conduct: 'Tis such Management makes Children
slight their Father's Directions as they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, our Father does kind Things for us
another way however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't desire to reflect upon my Father,
but if his Care was as much employ'd in choosing
religious Husbands for us, (since he will have us
marry) as it is in getting Portions for us; we should
find the Advantage of it much more to his future
Satisfaction and our own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must take the more Care of it our
selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that is the Point I am upon; I
wish you would do so then, Sister; for it is your
Case that I am upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have done it, I think; I see no room to
object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can say no more, Sister; you are re∣solv'd,
I see, and must go on; but you will buy
your Experience at a terrible Price; and if upon
the Trial you should be mistaken, you will think
of this Discourse hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! I would enter into a serious Dis∣course
of religious Matters with him; I would
know how we were to live together, whether as
Heathens, or as Christians; I would find out his
Principles, if he has any, or find out that he has
none: This is not catechising him, nor is there any
thing indecent in it: You are not asham'd to in∣quire
into his Estate, and make Provision for your
self out of it by a good Joynture; and will you be
<PB N="197" REF="203"/>
asham'd to inquire after that, which is of ten thou∣sand
times the Consequence! Sure you can never
go on hoodwinkt at all Hazards thus in that Part
that is for the Happiness of your Life, Soul and
Body; besides, had you not our Sister's Example
before you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I tell you, it is clear to me, that he
is a Man that has a Sense of Religion upon his
Mind; I gave you an Instance of it in his Detestation
of Sir <HI>Robert</HI> and his Practices: If my Sister could
have had but so much Satisfaction as that, she would
never have refus'd my Brother—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrong my Sister, I assure you;
she did not come so far indeed, because she came
to a clear Discovery that he had no Religion at all,
which was the first Point; but I can assure you, if
she had got over that Point, she would have en∣quir'd
farther; for 'tis a poor Satisfaction that is
founded upon Negative Religion only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we expect to search into Positives, as the
World goes now, I think we put a Hardship upon
our selves, that we are not oblig'd to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But certainly it is our Business to do it,
if we expect to live happily; for there are a great
many Men now a-days that are not Atheists, and
that abhor bantering of Religion, or making a jest
of sacred Things; and yet have nothing at all in
them that is sit to be call'd Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am not to examine the Inside; a
small deal of Hypocrisy will conceal the Heart;
if he be not a religious Man, the worst will be his
own, I cannot find it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, I should not say so much,
but that methinks you do not attempt to find it
out; you do not inquire after it; I do not find you
have exchange'd fix Words upon the Subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="198" REF="204"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I tell you what he said about Sir <HI>Ro∣bert</HI>—gave
me a good <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpression of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sister! you are soon satisfied; you
would not be so easy in the matter of his Estate;
it seems you will trust your Soul upon lighter Se∣curity
than you will your Portion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why; Sister, you won't take it upon
his Word that he has an Estate, or that you shall
be provided for; but you must have his Estate ap∣pear,
your Part be settled, and the Land bound to
you; it is not enough for him to say, I have such
and such a Revenue by the Year, and you shall
have such a Part of it if I die before you; but you
will have it under Hand and Seal, so that he shall
not be able to go back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and should I not do so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; but I allude only to it, and
observe how less anxious you are, how much easier
satisfied, how sooner secure, about the main Article
that constitutes the Happiness of your Life, and of
your Family, if ever you have one, than about
your Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You run this Matter up to a strange Height,
Sister, as if all my Felicity consisted in this one
Question, Whether my Husband be a religious Man
or no? nay, as if it consisted in his being of the
same Opinion in Religion as I am of, as if I could
not be religious, tho' my Husband was not so; or,
in a Word, as if I could not go to Heaven with∣out
my Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, it is you run it too high;
I do not say you cannot go to Heaven without
your Husband; or you cannot be religious without
your Husband, but I do say you cannot go com∣fortably
thro' the Journey thither without him, or
he without you; A Woman is to be a Helpmeet,
<PB N="199" REF="205"/>
and a Man is to be the same; Now a Husband will
be a sorry Help to a Wife, if he is not a Help in
the religious Part of her Life; and a sorry Help
indeed in the religious Part, if he has no Sense of
it himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you he has a Sense of it, and an
Affection to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but it will hold in the other Part
of the Question too▪ Suppose he has, yet if his
Sense of Religion is not the same with, or agree∣able
to your Sense of it; if he thinks you are go∣ing
the wrong Way, and you think he is going the
wrong Way, one pulls this Way, and the other
pulls that Way, in Religion; what will this come
to in the Family, Sister? Have you consider'd
that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I have consider'd it very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld, Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt not, Sister; I doubt you have
only consider'd of it so, as to resolve not to consider
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have consider'd it so far, as to see that I
can do nothing in it any farther; I cannot enter
into a Debate about Principles; tell him what my
Opinion is, and ask him what his Opinion is, and
try beforehand whether they agree or no; I tell
you I don't think 'tis my Business, any more than
the talking to him of our Settlement; that's the
Father's Part to do; sure my Father won't bring a
Heathen to me!</P>

<P>It is true, and that is our Misery, that, as
I said before, we have not a Father to concern
himself in that Part for us; but I do not think it is
such an improper Thing for you to do: Sure I
could some way or other bring it in, that I would
make some Guess at him; why you have never
offer'd at it in the least, neither has he shewn you
any thing of it; I do not so much as find that he
<PB N="200" REF="206"/>
has ever gone to Church with us, since he has ap∣pear'd
here so publickly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why no, that's true; and I wonder'd he
did not indeed, especially last Sunday, when he
din'd with us; but he made an Excuse that I
thought was sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and would not I have laugh'd at
him at Night, and ask'd him if ever he us'd to go
to Church? or whether he went to Church that
Sunday or no?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so I did; and he told me he was o∣bliged
to go that Day to wait upon the Marquis <HI>de
Monteleon,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Spanish</HI> Ambassador! why then he
was obliged to go to the Popish Chapel with him
too; for the Ambassador never fails at that time of
Day; I'll lay a hundred Pound he went to Mass
with him; there's a Clue for you, find out that
now, and your Business is done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, you are strangely possess'd with
Mr.—'s being a Papist have you any particu∣lar
Notion of it? you perfectly fright me about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; I must consess I have not
the least Ground for it; I won't do him so much
Injustice; but if I were in your Case, I would be
satisfy'd about it; I would ask him down-right in
so many Words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not ask him such a Question for an
hundred Pound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I would not marry him without
asking him, for ten thousand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why if I should, and he were really a Pa∣pist,
do you think he would be such a Fool to tell
me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he may be so honest as not to
deny what he is not asham'd of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="201" REF="207"/>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should hate him the Moment he confess'd
it, not for being a Papist, but for shewing he had
so little Concern for me, as to venture to own it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that you think he ought rather to
deny his Religion, and disown his Principles, than
venture your Displeasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should think he was very indifferent, whe∣ther
I was displeased or no, or that he presumed
upon my being so engaged to him, that I could not
go off, either of which I should take for an unsuf∣ferable
Insolence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you would have him conceal his
Principles, and discover them when you could not
help your self; pray which would be the greater
Insult?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You strive to push me into a Streight, but
I have a Medium again that delivers me from the
Necessity on either side, and that is to shake off the
Suspicion; and seeing you have no real Ground for
it, I cannot see why I should terrify my self with
a meer Jealousy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I have no Ground to suppose
him a Papist; but I would never marry any Man
in the World, without knowing what his Principles
are; 'tis no Satisfaction to me to say he is not an
Atheist, he is not a prophane Despiser of Religion;
Negatives are a poor Foundation, Sister, to go up∣on
in a Case of such Consequence; if he is of any
Religion, he should tell it me, or I would have no∣thing
to say to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I told you, he said in particular, that
he was of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as by Law esta∣blish'd</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why first, Dear Sister, I told you that's
nothing but what any Papist may say, even with∣out
a Dispensation; but however it seems he did
not say that, but in way of Discourse to other
<PB N="202" REF="208"/>
People; he did not say so seriously, in Answer to
any Inquiry of yours, or to give you Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's true; I have not desired any Sa∣tisfaction
of him; for I take those Casual Occasi∣onal
Discoveries of himself to have more of Na∣ture
in them, and to be less liable to Suspicion,
than a formal studied Answer to a jealous or doubt∣ing
Question; and I have many Reasons for my
Opinion too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that may be true; but I cannot
think that such occasional cursory Speeches can
have solid Foundation enough to satisfy you in a
thing of such Moment; and I think I have the
Testimony of the Fathers of our Reformation on
my Side, who, without doubt, saw in it the great
Weight that lies on this Part, <HI>viz.</HI> Of the Advan∣tage
and Necessity that there is, that Husband and
Wife should be of the same Opinion in Religion
one with another; when they appointed with the
Office of Matrimony, that the Communion be gi∣ven
to the marry'd Couple at every Wedding; that
it might appear, not only that they both made a
Profession of the Christian Religion, but that they
both agreed in the Profession of the same Princi∣ples,
and joyn'd together in the same Communion
with the Reform'd Protestant Churches, and with
one another; and I think this is enough to convince
you of the Justice of our Mother's Injunctions,
that we should not marry any Man, how religious
foever he was, unless he was of the same Opinion
in Religion with our selves; or, as I observ'd above,
that, as was the Custom, the Man and the Wife
might communicate together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take that to be done principally to prevent
Protestants marrying with Papists, and to discover
the Fraud, if there was any; you see that Practice
is left off now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="203" REF="209"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know it is left off, since other and les∣ser Differences among Protestants have made mu∣tual
Communion more difficult; but I think the
Reason of the Thing remains, <HI>viz.</HI> That every
Couple should know what Communion they are
of, and should be always, if possible, sincere and
without Constraint, of the same Communion with
one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think 'tis left off because it is not
thought to be of so much Moment, as they thought
it of then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eid. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is then, because Religion it self
is less in Fashion than it us'd to be, which indeed
is too true; also Marriages are now wholly taken
up with Mirth and gay Things, but in those Days
Matrimony seems to have been understood, <HI>as it
really is in it self,</HI> a solemn and serious Thing; not
to be ventur'd on rashly, consider'd of slightly, or
perform'd with Levity and Looseness; 'tis a Trans∣action
of the greatest Weight, attended with Cir∣cumstances
of the greatest Importance, and Con∣sequences
of the utmost Concern to our Welfare
or Misery; The Happiness of Life, the Prosperity
of Families, and indeed the Interest of the Soul is
exceedingly dependent upon the good or bad Con∣duct
of both Parties in this great Affair; and to
run headlong upon it, is rightly compar'd to a
Horse rushing into the Battel, and argues a miser∣able
Thoughtlessness of what is before us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, you terrify me with talking
thus; what is it you would have me do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have you take some Measures,
such as Opportunity will not fail (in your Conver∣sation
with this Gentleman) to present you with,
that you may know not only <HI>negatively,</HI> that he is
no Hater and Despiser of God and Religion, but
<HI>positively</HI> what his Principles in Religion are; you
<PB N="204" REF="210"/>
may go as far further as you see room for it, but
less than this you can never be satisfied with; and
can never answer it to God, to your self, to your
Mother's dying Injunctions, nor to your Children,
if you should have any, to venture upon marrying
him without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Mr.—heard your Discourse, he
would think you very much his Enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he was in his Senses, he
would think
me very much his Friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, quite the contrary, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, <HI>My Dear,</HI> let me ask you one
Question; for I must own to you this is one of my
great suspicions; has he inquir'd nothing after your
Religion, the Profession you make, or the Opi∣nion
you are of? Has he ask'd you no Question about
it neither?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not a Word, he knows better; he knows
I should give him but a short Answer, if he should
ask me any thing about my Religion; what do you
think I'll be catechiz'd already? No, no; it is not
come to that neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is one of the strongest Grounds
of Suspicion to me, and assures me that he has very
little Regard to Religion in general; that he can
pretend to marry you, and know nothing whether
you are a Heathen or a Christian; an Atheist or a
religious Person, a Papist or a Protestant; the Man
can have no great Value for Religion, that is so
little concern'd whether his Wife have any, or no;
for I take the Thing to weigh as much on one side
as on the other, where there is any serious Consi∣deration
at bottom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed we have had no Discourse about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems you are pretty well agreed;
<HI>that is to say,</HI> that neither of you trouble your Heads
<PB N="205" REF="211"/>
about it: I must confess, I think it will be a dread∣ful
Match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so? I tell you I have a Way to pre∣vent
all the Mischief you fear, and that is, as I
told you before, I am resolved we will agree; for
if he is not of my Opinion, I will be of his Opi∣nion,
and so we will never have any Strife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose you cannot do this; for I
take all that for loose Talk: For <HI>Example,</HI> suppose
he should be a Papist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't so much as suppose such a Thing; I
wonder you can suggest it of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem to be very much in the Fashi∣on
of our City Ladies, Sister; I am sorry for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Fashion's that, Sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why of reserving their Choice of Prin∣ciples,
till they see what Principles their Husbands
shall be of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is it not a very obliging Custom, Sister,
in the young Ladies? I think the Gentlemen owe
them a great deal for so much Complaisance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There seems to be something of Fore∣cast
in it I consess, <HI>viz.</HI> that they may be in a Po∣sture
to take any thing that offers; but there is
nothing of serious Religion in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there is a great deal of good Humour
in it; and it takes off the Occasions of religious
Disputes afterward, which I take to be the worst
kind of Family Breaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is not a Concurrence of Principles
before-hand a much better Way? Especially consi∣dering
that the Enquiry is made during a State of
Distance, and while there is a Power of prevent∣ing
the Mischiefs of being unequally yok'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I am persuaded there never was such
a Thing done, except by my stiff formal Sister;
Did ever a young Gentleman, when he came to
<PB N="206" REF="212"/>
court his Mistress, examine her, to know her Prin∣ciples,
and ask her what Religion she was of? Or
did ever young Lady, when she was courted by
any Gentleman, set up to catechize him upon the
Articles of his Creed, except, <HI>as I say,</HI> my surly
Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me answer that Question with a
Question, Sister; Did ever a young Lady, that had any
Regard to Religion, and the future Happiness of
her Life, suffer herself to be courted two Months
by a strange Person coming out of <HI>Italy,</HI> from the
very Bowels of Superstition, and the very King∣dom
of Popery, and go on with him even to draw∣ing
of Writings, and never know what Religion
he was of, or whether he had any Religion, or no,
except that she had heard by Accident that he was
not an Atheist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, must take him <HI>for better</HI> and <HI>for worse,</HI> you know; I'll make the best of him I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very sorry that I can't prevail
with you to prevent your own Misfortunes, when
it is so easy to be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You propose what I cannot so much as
mention to him; I tell you it would be the rudest
Thing; I'm sure, if he should do so to me, I should
spit in his Face, and bid him go and look for one
that was religious enough for him; sure never any
such Thing was done in the World!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder you can talk so, Sister! Do
you not remember the Passages about Mr.—,
when he courted my Cousin—? Did he not
enter into a most serious pretty Discourse with her
about Religion, when we were all at Table with
them? and don't you remember we all said, <HI>ay,
and you too, Sister,</HI> when you heard it? That he did
it with so much Modesty, and so handsomely, that
nothing could be more becoming; and did not
<PB N="207" REF="213"/>
you, <HI>as well us I,</HI> call her a thousand Fools for pre∣tending
to be disgusted at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she took ill his publick Manner of do∣ing
it, which I think was wrong too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I find you don't know, or don't re∣member
the rest of the Story; she exposed herself
to the last Degree by resenting it: The Case was
this, The Gentleman had courted her some Weeks,
and lik'd her, <HI>nay lov'd her,</HI> very well; but was
greatly perplexed to find out what Taste of Reli∣gion
his Mistress had; he was loath to fall point
Blank upon her with the Question, just as you say
in your Case, yet he was not willing to be satisfy'd
with a second-hand Relation neither; but one Day
when we were all together at my Cousin's, the
young Gentleman supp'd there, and after Supper
her Mother and he and I entering into a Discourse
together of several Matters, at last we began to
talk of Religion, and particularly of religious
Matches, when we were agreeably surpriz'd to
hear him talk for near half an Hour wholly upon
that Subject; you were not there just when he
talk'd of it, but we all gave you an Account of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was not there; I supp'd at <HI>London</HI> that
Night, and came to you the next Day, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You did so; but it would have pleased
you to have heard him talk; he began with the
Meaning and Nature of Religion, how it consisted
chiefly in Natural Duties, the Effects of the Know∣ledge
and Acknowledgement of a God governing
the World, to whom we ow'd the Homage of our
Lives, and of all we enjoyed, and must account
for the Use or Abuse of them then he observ'd
how pleasant and agreeable a religious Life was,
how it was Religion alone that made Life happy,
Families pleasant, Society agreeable, and Relati∣ons
<PB N="208" REF="214"/>
comfortable; how miserably some Families were
brought up for want of it; how beautiful it was to
see an Unity between Relations in Matters of that
Nature, and how dreadful the Strise was in Fami∣lies
where it was otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where was she all the while?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>She sate just by him, and he held her
by the Hand all the while: He went on then to
tell us a great many pleasant Stories of Families
that he had known; How in some the Husband
was religious and the Wife atheistic and prophane;
and in others the Wife was religious, and the Hus∣band
rakish, loose and profiigate; and how miser∣able
the one made the Life of the other: Then he
gave himself a loose to talk of the constant, never-failing
Felicity of Families where there was a Har∣mony
in religious Things between Husband and
Wife; and then to try her, <HI>I suppose,</HI> or perhaps to
prevent her thinking he pointed his Discourse at
her, he turn'd to her, and smiling, <HI>My Dear,</HI> says
he, <HI>if there be any Defect on that Account between you
and I, 'twill be on my side; but I hope to be help'd forward
by you.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was a kind of a Wheedle, rather than
a serious Turn in his Talk; and I suppose she took
it so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, she took it otherwise, I assure
you; for he might easly- see she was not pleased;
however he went on, and told us a long Story of a
Couple that were marry'd, and were both very
religious, and yet, said he, they never had any
Happiness any Agreement, or any practical Reli∣gion
in the Family; this put me upon Enquiry in∣to
the Circumstances of it: <HI>Why, Madam,</HI> says he,
<HI>one was of one Opinion in Religion,</HI> and <HI>one was of an∣other;
both of them were tenacious of their</HI> own Opi∣nion,
<HI>and censorious of the</HI> other; One <HI>went to one
<PB N="209" REF="215"/>
Place to worship, and</HI> One <HI>to another;</HI> One <HI>pray'd to
God in one part of the House,</HI> and <HI>One in another. Why,</HI>
says I, <HI>they pray'd to the same God, I hope; sure Cha∣rity
might have taught them to have pray'd together!</HI>
So far from that, Madam, <HI>says he▪</HI> that <HI>they not only
never pray'd with one another, but I believe they scarce
ever pray'd</HI> for <HI>one another in their Lives, but look'd up∣on
one another as</HI> Heathens and Publicans, <HI>and such
as God himself would not hear.</HI></P>
<P>This was a sad Family, Sir, <HI>said I;</HI> but I hope
there are very few such in this Nation, where Re∣ligion
is so heartily espous'd. Truly, Madam, <HI>says
he,</HI> it may teach us what Occasion there is for us
to seek out for religious Wives, and to take Care to
be agreeable Husbands to them, when we have
them: And here he said a great many handsome
Things indeed of the little Concern Men gene∣rally
took upon themselves either to marry religi∣ous
Wives, or to see that the Opinions of those
they mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied were not too much shocking with
their own; and especially that when Men had re∣ligious
Wives, or Women had religious Husbands,
they did not study, as much as lay in them, on both
sides, to bring their Opinions to agaee with one
another, bearing with one another, yielding as
much as possible to one another, and the like; that
as the Scripture said, <HI>their Prayers</HI> might <HI>not be hin∣dred.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well and was this the Discourse that she
did not like?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure her Mother and I lik'd it;
but she behaved herself so simply about it the next
Day, that gave him a Surfeit of her Religion, and
he declin'd her afterwards upon that very Account;
for as he told me since very seriously, she disco∣ver'd
such a Temper at that Time, such a general
<PB N="210" REF="216"/>
Dislike of a religious Life, and of a regular Family
that made him particularly afraid of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, he should have gone, if he was
so nice; I should have lik'd his Discourse no bet∣ter
than she did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you say so, sister? when
you cannot but remember you did like it when
you heard of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have thought it was too publick
tho', and that it was a kind of forcing me to a Ne∣cessity
of giving an Account of my Opinions, whe∣ther
I would or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what you would have done, I
know not; but I think no Woman in her Senses
could have dislik'd such a Principle as he went up∣on;
it plainly shew'd her that he was a Man that
placed the principal Felicity of his Life upon hav∣ing
a religious Wife, a religious Conversation in
his Family, and a religious Government of it as it
increas'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that to the Purpose? She would
have had him without it, and he might have talk'd
of it afterwards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, she would have had him with∣out
it, that was her Folly; but he was resolv'd he
would not have her without it; and that was his
Wisdom; and there was an absolute Necessity for
him to try before-hand what he had to expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I would not have been try'd by him;
he should e'en have gone, I say, and taken a Fool
for his own finishing, where he could have found
her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and he did go; and you know
he marry'd afterwards a very sensible, sober and re∣ligious
Woman, and they are a very happy Family
as any I know; whereas our foolish Cousin, you
<PB N="211" REF="217"/>
see, has marry'd a Rake; a Fellow of no Religion:
and is as miserable almost as it is possible for a Wo∣man
that has a good Estate to be made in this
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, and how do you bring this
Story down to my Case? I hope I am not going to
marry a Rake, <HI>as she has done;</HI> if I thought it was
so, I would soon clear my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Sister, I do not say so; but
there are many kinds of Husbands to make a sober
Woman miserable, besides Rakes, <HI>that I assure you;</HI>
nor was it upon that Account that I told you the
Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What about differing in Opinions you
mean? I must confess, I think, Sister, you are too
nice in that Case, and run it up, I say, too high:
I can give many Instances where such Matches do
<HI>very well.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Pretty well,</HI> you should have said; and
I know where you are a-going to name a Family;
I suppose you mean our Cousin <HI>Martha</HI>—and
Friend <HI>James—;</HI> one a strict Church-woman,
and the other a Quaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose I did mean those; they live
very comfortably, and love one another very well.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you have nam'd them, be∣cause
I would argue from the best Example you
can give: I allow they live as well as 'tis possible
for two of so wide and irreconcileable Principles
to do, and it is owing to a world of good Humour,
Affection and Charity in both of them; but if you
think there is not something wanting between
them, which ought to be between a Man and his
Wise, something essential to what we call Happi∣ness,
something they would give half their Estate
to have, and the Want of which robs them of the
sweetest part of Relation, and of the best and most
<PB N="212" REF="218"/>
solid Comfort of a married Life; or if you think
that they are not both sensible of it, you are great∣ly
mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not converse much with them, not I,
but I know they are a very loving Couple, and
every body takes notice of it, and admires them
for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I go on where I was speaking,
let me take notice to you, that your very last Words
now are an Argument on my Side: It is true, they
are admir'd for their kind and pleasant way of liv∣ing
with one another, and <HI>why is it!</HI> but because
it is so seldom, so rare, so wonderful indeed, to
find two of differing Opinions agree so well, that
all People wonder at these two; and shall any
young Woman, that values her Peace, and lays
any Stress upon the Happiness of an Agreement
with her Husband, venture upon such a Circum∣stance,
in which it must needs be next to a Miracle
if she has any such Happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't know but there may be many
more such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but I'll keep to your own Example,
and I will convince you, Sister, that even in these
two, who are happy to a Miracle, yet there is an
Exception to their Felicity; and tho' they love
entirely, and that Love covers a Multitude of Things,
yet, I say, they find something wanting, which
other People have, and something that they would
be glad to have; and I have had frequent Occasi∣ons
in serious Discourse with her, to hear her speak
her Mind freely to me in this very Case; particu∣larly
I will give you one Example of it, <HI>viz.</HI> One
Sunday Morning, when I went to Church with
her, O! said she to me, <HI>Cousin,</HI> if I could but get
this dear <HI>Jemmy</HI> of mine to go to Church with me!
Well, <HI>says I,</HI> what then? What then! <HI>says she.</HI> Why
<PB N="213" REF="219"/>
then I should be the happiest Woman upon Earth▪
Methinks 'tis the melancholiest Thing, <HI>continued
she:</HI> to go alone to the Worship of God, and the
Man that I love, and is to me as my own Soul,
won't worship with me; it breaks my Heart; it
quite takes away all the Comfort of my Life: A
while after this, as we walk'd along the Street to
go to Church, she fetch'd a deep Sigh: <HI>What's the
matter with you,</HI> said I, <HI>Cousin?</HI> The Matter Cousin!
<HI>says she;</HI> Look there, <HI>you'll see what's the Matter:
There's Mrs.—with her Husband and all her Chil∣dren,
going, hand in hand, to serve God together; they
live a heavenly Life;</HI> while we! <HI>tho' we love one ano∣ther
better than they do a great deal, yet live like two
Strangers</HI> on the Sabbath-day, <HI>whatever we do all the
rest of the Week:</HI> Now what think you of all their
apparent Affection to one another, Sister? will
that make up the Loss?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>They live very comfortably for all that; and
their Love makes up all those Intervals in their Sa∣tisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I'll tell you <HI>how comfortably they
live;</HI> I assure you, tho' they are Patterns to the
whole World for extraordinary Affections, and their
Love is so uninterrupted, that it does make up a∣bundance
of other Things, yet here, I say, it
makes up no Intervals, I can assure you of it; nay,
I think verily that Affection which it is confess'd
they have one for another, and for which they are
both so admir'd, makes it the wors<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; at least it
makes it the more grievous to bear; and the Part
I am telling you will prove it; pray let me go on
with it: I came back with her and din'd, and af∣ter
Dinner honest <HI>James</HI> takes up his Gloves and
his Cane, and came and kiss'd her, and prepares
to go to the Quakers Meeting: She could hold
no longer then, but burst out into Tears; he was
<PB N="214" REF="220"/>
extremely anxious to know what ail'd her, but she
could not speak; she was unwilling to grieve him,
and unwilling to say any thing that was unkind:
he press'd her a long time, and said a thousand
tender kind Things, that I hardly expected from
him; but that made her cry the more▪ <HI>At last,</HI> I
said to him smiling, I know what troubles her, but
you won't relieve her: <HI>Won't I?</HI> says he a little mov'd,
<HI>Why dost thee say so? I would let out my Blood to do her
any good; and she knows I will stick at nothing to do for
her.</HI> Why, says I, you won't serve God with her:
Won't I! says he; Yes I would with all my Heart,
if she would let me. This I found laid a Founda∣tion
for some Dispute about their Principles, but
she wisely avoided that, and I perceived it, so I
put it off: <HI>I dare say,</HI> says I, <HI>she would give all she
has in the World you would but go to Church with her
now;</HI> at that she burst out, tho' full of Tears, <HI>Ay,</HI>
says she, <HI>I would give him back my Jointure with all my
Heart.</HI> He took her in his Arms, and with all the
tenderest and kindest Expressions that he was capa∣ble
of, endeavoured to pacify her, and put an End
to it, as a Thing they could not dispute of without
Unkindness, and therefore better to be avoided;
but it took up the whole Afternoon to restore them
to one another, and she neither went to the Church,
nor he to the Meeting, and yet here was nothing
but Kindness and Affection between them all this
while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never heard any thing of this before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have heard a great deal more
from her, and from him too; tho' she loves him to
an Extremity, and to give him his due, he merits
all her Affection, yet as she is a very sober, religi∣ous
Woman, she is ready to break her Heart to
think sometimes what a Life she lives, she can
scarce ever talk to me of any thing else, I having
<PB N="215" REF="221"/>
been something more intimate with her on those
Occasions than ordinary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What has she to complain of? Has she not
a kind Husband? and does he not give her all the
Liberty and Freedom in the World? Does she not
go as fine, and dress as well as she pleases? Does
he not keep her a Coach, and give her Leave to
give her own Liveries, and go where, and do what
she will? Does she not live like a Queen? what
can she complain of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Case, in a word, Sister, is the
very Case our dear Mother warn'd us of; and it is
not hard to tell you what she has to complain of; she
is a very sober religious Woman, that serves God
Night and Day with a Sincerity and Devotion not
easy to be found among Women, <HI>as the World goes
now,</HI> and I'll tell you what grieves her, and what
she complains of: Her Husband is as religious too
in <HI>his Way</HI> as she is <HI>in hers;</HI> but as there is no Har∣mony
or Concurrence in their several Principles
and Ways of Worship; so there can be no publick
stated Family-Worship; he does not joyn with her,
nor she cannot joyn with him, so all the Thing
call'd Family Religion, the Glory of a married
State, and the Comfort of Family-Society is in∣tirely
lost; the Servants are left ungovern'd, the
Children unguided; and there again is her Grief
doubled, she has four little young Children; it is
true, he is a Man of too good a Humour to deny
or restrain her in the Education of her Children;
but it is a sad Thing to her to be obliged to instruct
and caution her Children against the Practice of
their Father, whose Life ought to be their Pattern,
and his Practice their Example. O Sister! if ever
you come to look into such a Condition with a
feeling Sense of it, as your own, you will find, it
is not all the Tenderness of the most affectionate
<PB N="216" REF="222"/>
Husband in the World can make up the Loss o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
these Things: On the other hand, he has his Dis∣satisfactions
too; he is as sad on the account of
her Difference from him, as the is for his Diffe∣rence
from her; so that in short the Unhappiness is
mutual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>They should have consider'd and prevented
these Things beforehand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, Sister; and that's the Rea∣son
of all my Discourse to you; that's my Propo∣sal
to you, and the Reason why I press you so
much to come to a Certainty in these Things; you
will have sad Reflections hereafter, when 'tis past
Remedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not so nice in the Point; I told you
my Remedy for it; if he can't come up to me;
I can come up to him; I am sure he is no
Quaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hear you, Sister; you make light of
it now: I believe he is no Quaker, but he may be
worse; and you are not sure he will equal that
Quacker in goodness of Humour, Kindness and Affection,
the want of which, I must tell you, will
make the want of the other be so much the worse
to bear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I must run the venture of it, I think,
'tit gone too far to break off now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not been persuading you to break
it off, Sister, you mistake me; I am only arguing
or rather persuading you to inform your self of
Things, and know before hand what you are go∣ing
to do, that you may not run into Misery blind∣fold,
and make your Marriage be, <HI>as old</HI> Hobbs <HI>said
of his Death, A Leap in the Dark.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think all Marriage is a Leap in the Dark,
in one Respect or another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="217" REF="223"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, if it be so, it should not
be so in Matters of Religion, in whatever other
Case it is so; that should be clear, whatever is
doubtful; that should be examined into, and per∣fectly
discover'd, whatever is omitted; the Mi∣stakes
in this are fatal to both Sides, and often ir∣retrievable,
and the Consequences dismal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is all a Hazard, and that among the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, Sister; I am firm in my Opi∣nion;
you and I have often argued it when you
have seemed to be of my Mind: It is true, there is
a Hazard in every Part of the Change of Life; we
risque our Peace, our Affection, our Liberty, our
Fortunes, but we ought never to risque our Reli∣gion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I am not running the risque of my
own Religion, tho' I do not know his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes truly in some measure, Sister, you
do, and your own Words acknowledg'd it just now;
Did you not say, that if he would not be of your
Opinion, you would be of his? And is it not of∣ten
that we see young Women change their Opi∣nions,
nay, change the very Principles of their
Religion, in Compliance with their Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and is it not very well to do so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If their Principles were ill founded be∣fore,
they do well to change them to be sure; but
is it not oftner that they rather abandon Principle
than exchange it; lose their Religion than increase
it? for you cannot suggest, that all the Women
who have chang'd their Opinions in Compliance
with their Husbands were wrong before, and have
chang'd for the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is better so far, that it takes away the
Foundation of Family-Breaches, which you speak of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="218" REF="224"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is a sad Exchange if it be
wrong; for the Woman then exchanges the
Peace of her Conference for Peace with her Hus∣band;
loses her Religion, and gives up her Princi∣ples
instead of exchanging them for better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be some Compliance sure, with∣out
intirely abandoning Principle; you propose no
Medium between right and wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why take our Cousin we were speak∣ing
of, or her Husband the Quaker, let them stand
for the Example: Suppose her in Compliance with
him, for you know she has Affection enough to do
any possible thing to oblige him, should turn Qua∣ker,
would she not retain a Sting in her Soul, that
would destroy all her inward Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what to say to that; Quakers
are Christians I hope?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I won't enter into that; I'll allow them
to be Christians too; but take it of him as well as
of her: Suppose him to change then, and come
over to her, then it would be the same in him,
which is all one to the Case in hand: Pray where
is the Felicity of such a Match? where one or o∣ther
is supposed to act without Conscience, or a∣gainst
Conscience, all their Days, for Conjugal
Peace, and to sacrifice Principle to Affection: Are
not these still invincible Arguments for what I am
persuading to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scarce know what you are persuading to,
not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you do, Sister, very well; how∣ever
I'll repeat it as often as you say so: I am urg∣ing
the absolute Necessity of young People com∣paring
their religious Principles and Opinions be∣fore
Marriage; and seeing that they agree, at least
so far as to lay no Foundation of a religious Breach
in the Family after Marriage; that they may wor∣ship
<PB N="219" REF="225"/>
God together, joyn in Family Precepts, and
support Family-Religion; that they may agree in
their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nstructions to their Children, and joyn in
setting them Examples; that there may be no Dis∣putings
or dividings against one another, but a mu∣tual
Harmony in the propagating their own eter∣nal
Interests, and that they may go hand in hand
the true Way to Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And cannot this happen to them without a
Settlement of Circumstances before-hand, that we
must capitulate about Religion, as we do about
Joyntures and settle Principles as we do Fortunes,
always before-hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it may not or cannot happen so,
I will not say; but if you will take the World at
large, as it is now stated, between those that have
no Religion at all, and those who differ from
others; you must allow, Sister, it is a Lottery of a
thousand Blanks to one Prize, and who that values
their own Peace, would venture the odds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I shall venture for all that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then either you have no Principle
now, Sister, or it's ten to one but you give it up
when you are marry'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you may be mistaken in both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am, there is a Third, which I was
a going to add, but restrained it in respect to you,
in which I believe I shall not be mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us have it however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will have it then, it is this,
That (to repeat the former) either, as I said, you
have no Principle now, or will give up your Prin∣ciples
when you are marry'd, or will be very mi∣serable
in a continual Family Strife to maintain
them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It must all be ventur'd, Sister; I see no
Remedy now; there's no going back at this time
of Day.</P>
</SP>
<P>After this Discourse, the eldest Sister, seeing her
resolute, gave it over, and the young Lady was as
good as her Word; for she put it all to the ven∣ture,
as will appear in the following Dialogue.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE young Lady mentioned in the fore∣going
Dialogue is now to be view'd in
another Station of Life: She was not
altogether so thoughtless of her Circum∣stance,
or so unconcern'd as she seemed to be by
her Discourse to her Sister, about what was before
her, but she had not the Conduct or Resolution of
her Sisters to carry her thro'; however she did take
one Step sufficient to leave a sad Example of a
Father perfectly unconcern'd about the religious
Settlement of his Children, and making the Good

Money; his whole Care was for the Settlement,
and the Estate, not inquiring into the Principles of
the Person; and therefore his Answers are as silly
for a Father, as her's were for a Wife, <HI>viz.</HI> That
he <HI>dare say</HI> the Gentleman was a <HI>very sober good Man,</HI>
that he had known him a long time, <HI>and did not que∣stion</HI>
but he was a Protestant, <HI>and the like;</HI> in a
<PB N="225" REF="231"/>
word, the Girl test it all to her Father; and the
Father, perfectly indifferent as to Matters of Reli∣gion,
left it out of his Inquiry; and thus they were
marry'd in a few Weeks after, and abundance of
Mirth and Jollitry they had, which cover'd all the
Appearances of other Things for a great while.</P>
<P>At length, the Lady went Home to her House
in the City, which was magnificently furnish'd;
among other rich Furniture, the Rooms were
exceedingly stor'd with a noble Collection of very,
fine Paintings, done by the best Mafters in <HI>Italy:</HI>
The Part of <HI>Italy</HI> where this Gentleman had liv'd,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI>'s Country, being parti∣cularly
eminent for choice Pictures: It happen'd
after she had been sometime at Home, had settled
her House, and had finish'd the Decorations of
her Rooms, that her Husband bringing some very
fine Pictures Home, which were newly arrived
from <HI>Italy,</HI> had, among others, three very choice
Pieces hung up in their Bed-chamber, whereof one
being a Picture of the Crucifixion, extremely va∣luable
and fine, he contriv'd to have hang'd up by
the Bedside.</P>
<P>His Wife, not us'd to such Things, perfectly ig∣norant
of the Design, nor at all acquainted with
the Use made of them in Popish Countries, took
no manner of notice of it at first, taking it to be
only brought in there, as it was a most noble piece
of Painting, and that her Husband thought it was
the best Thing he could grace her Chamber with:
It happen'd her two Sisters came together some time
after, <HI>as is usual,</HI> to see her House, and to see the find
Collection of Paintings, which they had been told so
much of; and after some time, their Sister and
their new Brother led them thro' all the Apartments,
which were indeed extreme fine: the Brother in
Law, as what he took great Delight in, made it his
<PB N="226" REF="232"/>
Business to tell them the Design of the several Pic∣tures,
what Places or fine Houses such and such re∣presented,
what Stories and what Faces others were
drawn for, and the like; and being his Wife's
Sisters, he treated them with all the Freedom and
Kindness imaginable.</P>
<P>When they came to the Crucifixion, which
hung by the Bedside, he told them, there was one
of the finest pieces of Painting in <HI>England;</HI> told
them the Name of the Painter that had drawn it,
who, he said, was one of the best Masters in <HI>Italy;</HI>
and I'll assure you, Sister, says he, this is counted
a fine Thing in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>But why must it hang in your Bed-chamber,
Brother? says the other marry'd Sister, not suspecting
any thing;; for her eldest Sister had not told her
any thing of what she had said to her Sister. O
Madam, says he, they always have these Things in
their Bed chambers in <HI>Italy</HI> on a religious Account.
Well, says the Sister, but as we do not make use of
them that Way, methinks they are better any where
else. Why, Sister, says he, our Bed-chambers are
Places where we are, or ought to be most serious.
Why, says she again, but we that are Protestants
do not make a religious Use of them. Not so much
perhaps, says he, as the Romans do; but I cannot
say but they may be useful to assist Devotion. Not
at all▪ says the Sister: At least, Madam, says he,
they can be no Disadvantage to us; we want all
possible Helps in our Adorations. We have the
Promise of the Spirit of God to assist us, says the
Sister Very warmly, and need no idolatrous Pic∣tures.
He saw she was tart, and seemed to be for∣ward
to dispute, which he avoided; so he called
them to took on another Picture, and that pass'd
off the Discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="233"/>
After they had gone through several Apartments▪
and had admired the fine Paintings, as indeed they
well deserved, they came to his Closet; he would have
avoided going in, and told them it was in Confu∣sion,
and not worth their seeing; but his Wife
having told them it was her Husband's Closet, they
would not be denied: When they went in, they were
surprized with the most charming Pictures that their
Eyes had ever beheld, with abundance of Rarities,
which their new Brother, being very curious, had
pick'd up in his Travels; and in a little Room on one
side of his Closet, upon a Table cover'd with a Carpet
of the finest Work they had ever seen, stood a Pix
or Repository of the Host, all of Gold, and above
them an Altar-piece of most exquisite Painting:
He was indeed jealous of being betray'd by these
Things, but there being none but the Ladies, who
had never seen such Things before, and knew no∣thing
by the Form, they retired without so much
as discovering what it was, and as for his Wife, she
was so perfectly ignorant, that she was easily im∣posed
upon.</P>
<P>They pass'd from this Place to the other side of
the Closet, where was abundance of very fine
Pieces; but here the eldest Sister could not forbear
observing that all the Pictures on that whole side of
the Room were religious Pieces, and tho' still,
without much Suspicion, she said to him, I ob∣serve,
Brother, you Gentlemen that have liv'd in
<HI>Italy</HI> are so in love with the Popish Customs, that
you are always full of these Church Paintings;
here's nothing but Representations of Christ and
the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in one Shape or another, in every
Room in your House: She went on jestingly for
some time, till she came to the upper end of the
Room to a Picture which hung just over an easy
Chair, and which had a Curtain drawn over it;
<PB N="228" REF="234"/>
he thought she would not have let her Curiosity
out-run her good Manners, and so did not appre∣hend
her opening it; but she made no Scruple of
offering to fling back the Curtain, but soon found
it would not run back, being, as she found after
wards, to draw up in Festoons with Pullies; How∣ever
she discoverd, by what she had done, that
the Picture was the same with that in the Bed∣chamber,
<HI>viz.</HI> a large Crucifix, or Picture of the
Crucifixion.</P>
<P>She said no more, but hasten'd to view what was
farther to be seen, yet so as that it was easy to dis∣cover
that she was in no little Disorder. Her Sister
that came with her discover'd it first, and ask'd
what ail'd her; then the new-marry'd Sister, whose
House she was in, came to her with the same Que∣stion;
she own'd to them she was not very well,
and that presently gave her an Excuse to withdraw
into the Womens Apartment, where she had some
Room to recollect herself: However she took care
not to give the least Cause to suspect what ail'd her;
till she got an Opportunity, when no body was
in the Room with her but her youngest Sister, (she
who was first marry'd) and then she burst out into
Tears, and taking her Sister about the Neck, with
the greatest Passion imaginable, O my Dear Sister!
says she, this poor Child is utterly undone: Un∣done!
says her Sister, what do you mean? I think
she is nobly marry'd: O Sister! I tell you she is
undone! the Man's a Papist! Some body came in∣to
the Room just as she had said this, so that her
Sister had no Time to ask her any farther, and she,
to prevent it, added, <HI>I'll tell you more by and by;</HI> so
they pass'd it over.</P>
<P>You may be sure it was, after this a very uneasy
Hour that the two Sisters spent in the Ceremonies of
their Visit, both longing earnestly to be at Liberty
<PB N="229" REF="235"/>
to talk together▪ one to disburthen her Mind,
which was oppress'd with what she had formerly
suspected, and now found confirm'd; and the other
to hear the Particulars of what she was so surprized
at.</P>
<P>It was not long before they got away, and as
soon as ever they were in their Coach, the marry'd
Sister said, <HI>Dear Sister, you have so surpris'd me with
what you told me just now, that I thought every Minute
an</HI> Hour, till I got away, that I might talk about it; I
intreat you what makes you talk as you do?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sister! I am too well satisfy'd of it;
I am sure 'tis so; I suspected it all along, before
they were marry'd, but now lam convinc'd of it;
I am as sure of it, as if I had seen him at High
Mass<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she tells her what she had observ'd upon his Picture and Crucifixes.</NOTE>.</P>

<SPEAKER>Marr'd Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you surprize me again, you

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>indeed I did, though I own I know
no Reason why I did so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why did you not warn her of it?
she ought to have known it, certainly she would
never have marry'd him if she had known it; that
was very unkind, not to warn her of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did very plainly tell her my Suspici∣ons,
but as I had no Ground to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asten it upon him,
it made very little Impression upon her, nor could
I really say it was so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I would have prest her to a so∣lemn
Inquiry into it; you might have prevented
her Ruin, if you had done it in Time; now she
<PB N="230" REF="236"/>
is undone indeed, if it be as you say, and there is
no Room to prevent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot think I had so little Con∣cern
for her, as not to tell her my Suspicions, and
to use all the Arguments I was capable of, to per∣suade
and prevail with her to enquire into his Prin∣ciples;
for I know too well what the dwelling
twenty Years in <HI>Italy</HI> might do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she recites to her the Particular of the whole Dialogue foregoing, between her and her and her younger Sister.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Child! she is ruin'd indeed; she
has leap'd headlong into it, in spight of good Ad∣vice;
and her Ruin is of her own procuring: But
what will you do now, Sister? will you let her
know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; I won't be the Messenger
of her Sorrows; she'll find it out soon enough;
the Thing will discover it self too soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, what does my Father say
to it? Does he know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sister, my Father gives
himself very little Trouble about such Things; I
dare say he never enquir'd into it, or concern'd
himself about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does he know any thing of it now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I do not know; but I know that
after I had prest her so earnestly about it; she did
mention it to my Father once at a distance in their
Discourse, as that she did not question but he was a
good sober Man, or else he (<HI>her Father</HI>) would not
have recommended him; and added, I hops he is
a Protestant, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, what said my Father to that
Part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="231" REF="237"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He answer'd after the same slighty way
as these do who make the main part none of their
Care: Yes, yes, Child, a Protestant! I dare say
he is; he was always a Protestant when I was in
<HI>Italy</HI> with him, and every body knows he is a Pro∣testant;
you need not question that I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Child! she had no sincere Con∣cern
upon her about it; if she had, she would not
have been put off in a Matter of so much Moment,
with a bare Supposition; taking it for granted, or
<HI>I dire say</HI> 'tis so, without enquiring into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too true; she has not made it
much her Concern, and I am so much the more
afraid for her now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Afraid for her! say you, what are
you afraid of her turning Papist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes, I am: You know I told
you what an Answer she gave me to that very
Point several Times, <HI>viz.</HI> That if he would not be
of her Opinion, she would be of his; that if he
was a Christian Catholick, she was a Catholick
Christian, and they would have no Strife about
that, and the like; and yet that is not all my Con∣cern
neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I fear more the Insinuations and
Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lilty of his Tongue, his unwearied Sollicitation,
the powerful Motives of a Man perfectly Master of
the Art of Persuasion; and that the more Sweet∣ness
he has in his Temper, for he is really of a
most engaging Disposition, the more Influence his
Words will have on her, to win her over to
Error, not meerly in Complaisance to him as her
Husband, but by her not being able to answer his
Reasniongs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="232" REF="238"/>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, 'tis hard to resist the Force
of those Persuasions, the Reasons for which we
cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id our Hands of by Argument; and one is
apt to think one ought to comply with what we
cannot confute; otherwise the Papists will tell us,
we are Protestants we know not why; <HI>a Jew</HI> may
tell us we are Christians, we know not why; and
an Atheist may tell us we are religious, we know
not why; <HI>and so on.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sist. And that which is worse, there is no
breaking the thing to her; to talk to her of it, is
to anticipate her Misfortunes; perhaps he designs
to conceal it from her for good and all, and at least
it may be a great while before he discovers it; and
all that Time she will be happy in not thinking
herself so miserable as she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow you, it is not fit to mention it
to her first; and yet I am afraid if she finds it out,
she will endeavour to conceal it from us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt so; and by that Means we are
perfectly deprived of all Opportunity of assisting
her, or endeavouring to fortify her against the
Insinuations of any to turn her to Popery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I think we should break it to my
Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to say to that; I am
afraid his Indifference in the Thing should be a
Means to discover it to her, and bring some In∣convenience
or other with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see any Danger of that; but
I think 'tis fit he should know it on many Ac∣counts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge, I think he should know
it, if it were possible to engage him not to disclose
it; but unless it can be done so, I would not have
any hand in telling it him upon any Account
whatever.</P>

<P><PB N="233" REF="239"/>
While they were in this Dilemma, and doubtful
what to do in it, as to telling their Father; they
were delivered from it, by their Father himself, as
will appear in the following Discourse: As soon as
they came Home, their Father began with them,
for he was more impatient to open his Mind to
them, than they were on the other hand doubtful
about consulting with him upon this unhappy Case;
both Sides being therefore willing to talk of it,
they could not want an Opportunity; and the
Father after Supper began it with his new-marry'd
Daughter thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Betty,</HI> you have been to visit your
Sister in her new House I find; How do you like
Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mar. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, she is nobly marry'd to be sure;
she has a House like a Palace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is the finest Paintings that
ever I saw in my Life; he has laid out vast Sums
sure in Pictures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>He always had the finest Collection of Paint∣ings
of any Merchant in <HI>Loghorn;</HI> he is a great Lo∣ver
of Art, and has a nice Judgment, which are
the two only Things that can make buying so ma∣ny
Pictures rational; for his, Pieces are so well
chosen, that he may sell them when he pleases for
above a thousand Pounds more than they cost.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like his Fancy to Pictures very well;
but methinks I don't admire his having so many
Crucifixes and Church-pieces among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the Custom in <HI>Italy,</HI> Child; all People
have them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, because they make a religious
Use of them; but I think Protestanrs should not
be so fond of them, who make no such Use of
them; it looks so like Popery, that if the Mind
<PB N="234" REF="240"/>
was not furnish'd against them, it seems to give a
Lift that way; and then I observe he hangs them
all just as they do; his Crucifixes and Passion-Pic∣tures
hang all by the Bedside, his Altar-pieces just
at the upper end of the Room&gt; or on the East-side;
I cannot imagine why Protestants, if they will
have the Pictures, should just hang them in the
same Places, and mimick the Catholicks in the Ap∣pearances,
as long as they do not make the same
Use of them.</P>
</SP>
<P>This Discourse touch'd their Father to the Heart,
and, as he said afterwards, he could hardly forbear
Tears; but he held it in a little longer, and reply'd,
that it was only the Custom of the Country, and
they might think no Harm in it; and so being
willing to put by the Discourse, he turns again to
his marry'd Daughter thus:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Child, how do you like your new
Brother? for you never saw him before, or at least,
never to converse with him.</P>

liv'd in <HI>Italy</HI> not to discover it, as soon as he see his

<P>And was you in an inner Room that you

beyond it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir; we were both there, but
we saw nothing there more than ordinary, only still
more Church-Pieces, as that of the Passion, the
Salutation, the Ascension, and the like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is because you have not been us'd to such
Things, Child; why it is his Oratory; it is a little
consecrated Chapel, and there stands an Altar and
an Altar-piece over it, with a Crucifix, and the
Ascension painted above that, on either side there
are fine rich Paintings, one of the Baptism, and
another of the Assembly at the Feast of <HI>Penticost,</HI>
and the Holy Ghost descending in flaming Tongues,
<PB N="236" REF="242"/>
and the like: But that is not all, for upon the Al∣tar
is a Pix of pure Gold, covered with a piece of
Crimson Velvet, which is the Repository, as they
call it, of the Host.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, Sir, he would let you see
these Things, if he designed to conceal his Profes∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was all by Accident; for when I was in
his Closet, he was called hastily down, and his Wife
let me into those two Rooms; but alas! she knows
nothing of the Meaning of them, she only takes
them to be fine <HI>Italian</HI> Rarities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I do not wonder at that, for I
understood them no more than she does; and yet,
my Sister knows, I presently entertained the same
Opinion of his Religion as you do now, but it was
from a Picture of the Crucifixion that hung by his
Bedside with a Curtain over it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Child, yours are Suspicions, mine is a

<P>Nay, it is then out of doubt, it seems,

<P>My Dear, she came to me, and question'd

<P>I assured her so much of its being my Opi∣nion,

again left it all to me, and depended upon me;
and it is I that have betrayed and deluded her: In
short, I have sold my Child, and the Peace of her

undone her; it is all owing to my being unconcer∣ned

so.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But▪ Sir, notwithstanding all this Dis∣course,
(for she told me every Word from time to
time) I urg'd her a great many Times, and told her
my Thoughts; for I suspected him from, the begin∣ning,
and I laboured to convince her, that she ought
to see with her own Eyes, and to talk plainly and
openly to him of it.</P>

<P>Did she not tell you that her Father had as∣sured
her he was a Protestant, and that she trusted
to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was more just to you, Sir, than to
say that you assured her of it, but she repeated your
very Words, that you said, <HI>you believed it,</HI> and <HI>dare
say he was;</HI> and I told her plainly, that it was evi∣dent
from your Words, that you only spoke your
Opinion, and that she ought not therefore to call
that a positive Assurance to be depended upon:
Indeed, Sir, I was very plain with her; she has no
body to blame but herself I told her<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here she repeats all her former Discourse with her Sister.</NOTE>.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has herself indeed been no blame for want
of Reflection upon your seasonable Persuasions, <HI>My
Dear,</HI> and you acted a faithful Part to her: But
had I been as faithful to her, who was obliged in
Duty to have done it, and on whom she depended,
as you were, who had no Obligation but from
your Affections, I had delivered my Child from
Ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say, Sir, you had delivered
her; she seem'd resolved to have him, her Eyes
were dazled with the gay Things she expected, and
unless you had positively refused your Consent, I
fear Religion had not Hold enough of her Thoughts
to have ballanc'd her Love of Vanity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I have been perfectly careless of it, and
have not done the Duty of my Place; I ought to
have not only informed and advised her, but to have
inquired into the Circumstances of the Person my
self, and have restrained her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="239" REF="245"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for her, but I think you re∣flect
on your self too severely, Sir; to be sure you
did not know that he was a Papist, neither had you
any Suspicion of it, but she had; for I put the
Suspicion into her Head, and earnestly press'd her
to satisfy herself about it from himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dear, I have been always too careless
in these Things: I remember the Case of your
Sister here, and cannot but reflect how when in a
Passion I told her it was none of my Business, my
own Heart struck me with Reproach; for I knew
it was my Duty: I wish this poor Child had been
as strict and as nice in that Matter as her Sister was,
tho' I took it ill then, I see now she was in the right
of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You afflict your self, Sir, for a Case
that issued well; and where, if you were in the
wrong, there were no had Consequences; whereas
in this Case, where the bad Consequences have
happen'd, you are no way the Cause, 'tis all her
own doing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as it is an Affliction to me, and that you
may be sure it is, Providence seems to shew me my
Sin, by my Punishment; I acknowledge I was in
the wrong before, and it is not owing to my
Prudence or Concern that your Sister was not
ruin'd; Besides, every Father that has a due Concern
for the Souls of his Children, will certainly inquire
narrowly into the Principles as well as Morals of
the Persons they match them to.</P>
</SP>
<P>In a word, their Father afflicted himself so much
and so long upon this Matter, that his two daugh∣ters
were obliged to drop their Concern for their
Sister, and apply all the Skill they had to comfort
their Father: He was so overwhelmed with it, that
it threw him into a deep Melancholly, and that in∣to
<PB N="240" REF="246"/>
to a Fit of Sickness, which, tho' he recover'd, yet
he did not in a long time thoro'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y enjoy himself; al∣ways
charging and reproaching himself with having
ruin'd his Child, having regarded nothing but the
outside of Things, and referring all her Happiness
to a plentiful Fortune, and a gay extravagant way
of Living.</P>
<P>This went on some time; the eldest Daughter,
who was left with the Father, managed Things so
prudently, that no Notice of these Things were
taken in the Family, and. her Father readily agreed
with both his Daughters, that it was by no means
proper to let their Sister know what they had dis∣covered;
concluding, that whenever she discover'd
it herself, she would come Home with a sad Heart,
and make her Complaint to them fast enough.</P>
<P>But they were all mistaken in their Sister; for
tho' she discover'd the Thing, and liv'd a melancholy
Life with her Husband upon that Occasion, yet in
eight Year that she liv'd with him, she never com∣plained,
or made her Sorrows known to any of her
Relations, but carried it with an even steady Tem∣per
and bore all her Griefs in her own Breast, as
shall be seen at large in the next Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE new marry'd Couple, of whom we
have been speaking, liv'd in all the Splen∣dor
and Greatness, that the highest de∣gree
of private Persons admits of, and
which a Family possess'd of an immense Wealth,
could be supposed to do; he was not only very
rich when he marry'd her; as might be supposed
by the noble Furniture of his House, and his very
valuable Collection of Pictures and Rarities, and
the like, of which mention has been made, but as
he fell privately into a great Affair of remitting
Money by way of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Genoa,</HI> for Supply of
the <HI>French</HI> Armies in <HI>Italy,</HI> he got that way a pro∣digious
Sum of Money; and yet acting only by
Correspondents at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> he was liable to no
Resentment or Objections from the Government
here.</P>
<P>After he had lived thus about eight Years, and
in that Time had six Children by this young Lady,
he died; she had four of her six Children living:
But their Father, after having in vain tried all the
Persuasions, Arguments and Intreaties (for he was
too good a Husband, and too much a Gentleman
to use any other Methods) to bring his Wife over to
the Roman Church, left her however under
<PB N="242" REF="248"/>
this terrible Affliction, that having disposed of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
vast Estate in a very honourable Manner, as wel
to her, as to her Children, yet he took the Educa∣tion
of her Children from her, leaving them to the
Tuition of Guardians to bring them up in the Ro∣man
Religion: Nor was this the Effect of his Un∣kindness
to her; for except in Disputes about these
Things, they never had any Difference worth the
Name of a Dispute in their Lives; and at his Death
he left to her own Disposal above six times the
Fortune she brought him; but this of his Children
was a meer Point of Conscience to him, which he
could not dispense with: This was an inexpressible
Grief to her, and that such, and so heavy, as it is
impossible to represent it in this narrow Tract, so
as to say how far it afflicted her, or what ill Con∣sequences
attended it; the Drift and Design of
this Work also lying quite another Way, <HI>viz.</HI>
to shew the Manner of Life, which naturally attends
the best Matches, where the religious Principles of
the Husband and Wife are not the same.</P>
<P>The eldest Sister was now marry'd also, and
marry'd very happily and comfortably; the Princi∣ples
as well as Practice of her Husband not only
concurr'd entirely with her own, but answer'd
in a most agreeable Manner to the Character which
was given to her Father of him, <HI>viz.</HI> That he was
a Person truly religious.</P>
<P>Their Father, now grown old, had been a true
Penitent for his Mistakes in the past Conduct of his
Children; and had fully made up his want of Care
in his middle Daughter's Match, by his Difficulty
in being pleased for his eldest: She needed no Con∣cern
for, or to shew any Nicety in examining into the
Person, for her Father was so very nice for her, that
scarce anything could please him; he rejected seve∣ral
very good Offers, meerly on account of religious
<PB N="243" REF="249"/>
Principles, and put them off without so much as
naming them to his Daughter, till at last fixing
upon a Merchant in. the City, who both for So∣briety,
Piety, Opinion in Religion, and Estate
suited every way both his own Desires and his
Daughter's Judgment, the Match, under such
Circumstances was soon made; The uninterrupt∣ed
Felicity this young Lady enjoyed, in having the
best Husband, the best Christian, and the best tem∣per'd
Man in the World, all in one, made
her the happiest Woman alive, and indeed recom∣mended
the Caution she had always used in her
Choice, by its Success.</P>
<P>Her Father liv'd with this Daughter, when
he was in Town, but otherwise liv'd in <HI>Ox∣fordshire,</HI>
with his own Sister, the Lady—
Widow of Sir <HI>James</HI>—, of whom mention is made
in the first Part of this Work: He lived very easy,
having thus seen his Family all settled; for his two
Sons were very well fix'd abroad, the one at Leg∣hor,
and the other at <HI>Cadiz;</HI> and he might really
be said to have no Affliction in the World but that
of his middle Daughter; who, tho' by far the rich∣est
and most prosperous in Circumstances, and lived,
in the most Splendor of all the rest, yet he esteemed
really miserable, and so indeed in one; Sense she was.</P>
<P>He was at Dinner one Day at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is eldest Daugh∣ter's
House, his youngest Daughter being casually
there also, when, while they were at Table, Let∣ters
came from the <HI>Bath,</HI> where his middle Daughter
was gone with her Husband, to acquaint them, that
her Husband, after an Indisposition of no more than
five Days, was dead: It surpriz'd, them all; for they
had not so much as heard that he was ill; and his
Distemper being a Pleurisy, it was exceeding vio∣lent,
and carried him off very quick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. When their
Father read the Letter, he was extremely surpriz'd,
<PB N="244" REF="250"/>
and rising up from the Table hastily, <HI>Poor Child!</HI>
said he, <HI>God has delivered her, but it is by a sad Stroke:</HI>
His Daughters got up from Table terribly frighted,
when they saw the Disorder their Father was in,
not knowing what the Matter was; but he per∣ceiving
it, turned about suddenly, and said, <HI>Your
Sister—is a Widow,</HI> and threw down the Let∣ter:
At this they sat down again all surpriz'd, and
Indeed sensibly afflicted; for, excepting his Reli∣gion,
which was not all that while made publick,
he was a most obliging Relation to them all.</P>
<P>I purposely pass over here the Incidents that
may be supposed to happen in the Family on so sad
an Occasion; such as the Lady's coming up from the
<HI>Bath,</HI> the Concern of the Father and Sisters to
comfort her; the Disposal of herself, and the Ma∣nagement
of her Affairs, hastning to the main Sto∣ry,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Account she gave of her Life past, and
of what she had gone thro' in the eight past Years of
her marry'd State upon the particular Occasion of
her Husband's being of a differing Religion.</P>
<P>It was some Months after her Husband's Death,
and when all her Affairs were in a settled Posture,
that she went to divert her Thoughts a little, and
unbend her Mind from the Sorrows she had been
under, <HI>for she was a sincere Mourner for her Husband;</HI>
I say, it was tome Months after his Death, that
her younger Sister having invited her down to her
Seat in <HI>Hampshire,</HI> she went thither, and her Fa∣ther
and eldest Sister, at her Request, went all
with her.</P>
<P>Here, upon casual discoursing of things past, her Fa∣ther
who was almost ever bemoaning his Neglect in
exposing his Children, threw out some Words,
which first gave her to understand that both he and
her Sisters knew her Husband was not a Protestant,
at which she seemed very much surpriz'd: But as
<PB N="245" REF="251"/>
she found it was known, and that however it was
still so far a Secret, as that it had gone no farther
than their own Breasts, she was soon made easy;
she then made, Confidence of it, earnestly intreating
them that it might go no farther, which they wil∣lingly
promised for her Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But this open'd the Door for Variety of Confe∣rences
among them, as particularly her Sisters told
her, how they discover'd it first, and afterwards
their Father and repeated all the Discourses they
had had about it, and how, and for what Reason
they had resolved never to mention it to her, un∣less
she spoke first of it; concluding that perhaps
he might conceal it from her, and they would
be very loth to discover a Thing to her, which
they knew could have no other Consequence at that
Time, but to ruin and afflict her: Alas Sister! says
she, I discover'd it within a Fortnight after I came
Home.</P>
<P>Ay! <HI>says her youngest Sister,</HI> you had a good Go∣vernment
of your self to refrain unbosoming to
some of us; especially considering my Sister here,
(<HI>meaning her eldest Sister</HI>) had been so serious with.
you upon that very Head before you were married.</P>
<P>Dear Sister, <HI>says the Widow,</HI> to what purpose is it
for any Woman, when she is marry'd, to complain
of her Disappointments, which she knows she can∣not
mend?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, <HI>my Dear,</HI> but who is there can
deny themselves that Ease to their Grief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! complaining is but a poor Ease to
such Sorrows; 'tis like Sighing, which relieves
the Heart one Moment, and doubly loads it the
next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, seeing you had so intire a
Mastery over your self in that Part, and you
brought the Dominion of your Reason over your
<PB N="246" REF="252"/>
Passions, to so perfect an Exercise, which is what
I confess I must admire you for; I say, seeing you
master'd your self so well that way, I am oblig'd
to think, you master'd your self as well within
Doors; and with good Conduct perhaps you made
it no Inconv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nience to you: I with you would let
us hear how you manag'd, that we may see; per∣haps
difference of Opinion may be so manag'd as
to make no Breaches in a Family, and it might be
as well as if it had been otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no! Sister, don't fancy so: Our dear
Mother was wiser than so, and you were all wiser
than I, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay so much Stress upon it as you did; I
am a Convert now to my Mother's Instructions,
tho' it be too lace to help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Mr.—and you liv'd mighty easy;
you were always mighty well with one another I
thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was impossible to be ill with him, he was
of so excellent a Temper: But this makes my Case
perfectly instructing to others, and proves effectu∣ally,
that no Goodness of the Disposition, no Ex∣cess
of Affection, no prudent Compliances, tho'
they make the Case rather better than worse, can
yet make up, no not in the least, or any way ba∣lance
the inexpressible Deficiency that such a
Breach in religious Matters makes in a Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, <HI>my Dear,</HI> I see it now, with a sad
Heart, but it was far from any of my Thoughts
then; you owe all the Mise<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of it to my Neglect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I dare say, you did not mistrust it; I
remember you said, he had always been a Protestant
when you was at <HI>Leghorn,</HI> and that you knew he
was b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>my Dear;</HI> but it was my Business to
have inquir'd farther into it; I might easily have
known it, if I had inquir'd; for several Merchants
<PB N="247" REF="253"/>
told me afterwards of it, but I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid no Stress upon
it; <HI>in short,</HI> I did not consider the Consequences.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no need to afflict your self now,
Sir, about it; my Sister is deliver'd another way,
Sir, and the Thing is over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I am a warning to all Parents, that have
the Good of their Children at Heart; never to
make light of such Things, but search them to the
Bottom: and the more their Children depend upon
them, the greater is their Obligation to be very
careful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Sister is deliver'd from it all now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a sad Deliverance, Sister; and it's a
dreadful Case to be so marry'd, as that the Death
of a Husband should be counted a Deliverance;
and especially of a good Husband too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do believe he was a good Husband indeed,
that one Particular excepted; but that was a terri∣ble
Circumstance, and would have made the best
Husband in the World a bad Husband to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Child, and so it did to me in some
Cases, tho' he was otherwise the best humour'd
Man, and the best Husband imaginable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No question, there was some Uneasiness at
first, but it seems you got over it; I wish you
would tell us, Sister, how you manag'd the first
Discovery between you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sister, the Uneasiness was not so
much at first, as at last, and had we liv'd longer to∣gether,
it must of Necessity have grown worse,
especially as the Children grew up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed there you might have come to
clash in Matters very essential to your Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Might have clash'd do you say! indeed,
Sister, we must have clash'd: It was unavoidable,
it could not be, that I could be easy to have the
<PB N="248" REF="254"/>
Children bred Papists, or that he could have been
easy to have them bred, <HI>as he called it,</HI> Hereticks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was impossible indeed; and the more
you were both settled and serious in your Opinions,
the more impossible it would be for you to yield
that Point to one another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you know, Sister, Mr.—was a
very serious grave Man; and I assure you, in his
Way he was very devout; and this made his yield∣ing
to me sometimes to be very difficult to him; he
had very strong Struggles between his Principles
and his Affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, it is always so where there are
differing Opinions between a Man and his Wife;
the more zealous and consciencious they are in
their several Ways, the more difficult it is for them
to yield those Points up to one another, which Kind∣ness
and Affection may incline them to give up:
But pray give us a little Account of your first Dis∣putes
about these Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a sad Story, Sister, and will bring ma∣ny
grievous Things to remembrance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be very unwilling to impose so
irksome a Task upon you; but I think it will be
very instructing to us all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it was not much above a Fortnight
after we came Home, as I observed to you, before
I discover'd it, and the Manner was thus: I won∣der'd
that every Sabbath day my Spouse contriv'd
some Excuse or other to avoid going to Church
with me; I had taken some Notice of it, before we
went Home, but the second Sabbath-day I took up∣on
me to desire him to go; he seem'd not to deny
me, and went into the Coach with me, but pre∣tended
a sudden Thought, that he was oblig'd to
go up to St. <HI>James</HI>'s; and having very civilly hand∣ed
me ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Coach, and gone with me into
<PB N="249" REF="255"/>
the very Place, made a light Bow, when I could
not stand to persuade, and went back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did he take the Coach too, and leave
you to come Home on Foot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; he never shew'd me so little Re∣spect as that; he went but as far as <HI>Temple-Bar</HI>
in the Coach, and sent it back, charging the Coach∣man
to go and wait for his Mistress, which he did:
This however troubled me a little, and I began to
be uneasy, tho' I knew not for what.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>my Dear,</HI> did nothing occur to your
Thoughts, as it did to ours, about his Pictures, his
Crucifixes, Altar-pieces, and such Things?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not at all: I had heard my Father say
it was the Fashtion in <HI>Italy;</HI> and it being so remote
from my Thoughts to imagine any thing of what
was the real Case; I had indeed no Thoughts at
all about it, till the following Affair alarm'd me. I
was with him one Day in his Closet and viewing
his fine Things, the Pictures, Imagery, and other
Rarities, of which he had abundance; and some
Pieces of Antiquity, that are of very great Value,
he was mighty busy, and pleas'd in shewing me
Things, and telling me what they were; for then
they were as new to me almost, as they were to
you; at last I went into the little Room within
his Closet, and look'd upon all the fine Things
there; where you know, Sister, there are abun∣dance
of valuable Pieces of Paintings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed 'tis a charming Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon the Table there flood two fine Silver
Candlesticks guilded, with large Wax-Candles in
them: My Dear, <HI>says I,</HI> like an innocent Fool,
these Candlesticks are very fine, I think they are
much fine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than any we have about the House. My
Dear, says he, if you had rather have them in your
Closet, than to let them stand here, they shall be
<PB N="250" REF="256"/>
removed: No, my Dear, <HI>said I,</HI> if we should want
them upon an extraordinary Occasion, 'tis but
borrowing them of you; We said no more of that
them, but the next Day he sent me in from a Gold∣smith's
in <HI>Drury-Lane</HI> two Pair of Candlesticks larger
and finer than these, of very curious Workman∣ship,
and all the high emboss'd Work double-gilt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you had no need to grutch him those
he used in his Closet any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; But to go on: After I had
done speaking of the Candlesticks, I laid my Hands
upon a large Piece of Crimson Damask, which
seemed to cover something that flood upon the
Table, and standing up about seven or eight Inches
high in the middle, look'd as if there were several
Things together; and going to rurn it up, I said,
what is under here, <HI>my Dear?</HI> but added with a
Smile, and chinking nothing of the matter, <HI>may I
look?</HI> Me smil'd a little, but laying his Hand upon
it too, said, I had rather not, <HI>my Dear;</HI> they are
Things I brought from <HI>Italy,</HI> but nothing of Orna∣ment.
Well, well, says I, let it lye; I don't de∣sire
to look, not I, and immediately turn'd to look
at a Picture that hung near me, and all this while
I was so dull as to perceive nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Curiosity was not much it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Innocence suspects no body; but a strange
Turn in his Countenance gave me an Alarm, which
I was not aware of; for there was a visible Hurry
and Confusion in his Face, when he laid his Hands
upon the piece of Damask to prevent my taking it
up; and on a sudden, when I so easily and uncon∣cernedly
pass'd it off, all that chagrin went off of
this Countenance in a Moment, and he was as
bright and as good-humour'd again as ever; and
this made me think afterwards that there was some∣thing
in it more than usual.</P>

<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must have been very dull if you
not, seeing you, perceived such a double Altera∣tion,
and this would have heightned my Desire to
inquire father into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Per haps it did so too in me; but I saw
evidently he was concern'd, and why should I
make him uneasy? I could have pass'd a hundred
such Things by, and have restrain'd my Curiosity
while I had no Suspicion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but what was this to the Case? it
seems here was no Discovery then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, here was a Discovery too, as it pre∣par'd
for further Observation: I told you, that the
next Day he sent me Home two pair of Candle∣sticks,
which were indeed very fine, and as I was
admiring them, I desir'd to have the other fetch'd
down to compare them with; upon which he made
some Difficulty, and said, he could not trust a Ser∣vant
to go into his Closet alone, where Things of
Consequence lay about; but, <HI>my Dear,</HI> says he, we
will go up and match them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that Reason was just enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so; and I went up with him into
his Closet, but not into the inner Room; but I
observ'd just when he stept in, he made an extraor∣dinary
low Bow towards that Place where the
Candlesticks stood: Indeed I took no notice of it
at first, for I verily thought he had stoop'd for some
thing, but when he carry'd the Candlesticks in again
he did the same, and that gave me some Thought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Sist</HI> That was a Discovery indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No really it was as not yet; for as I was a per∣fect
Stanger to any of their Popish Ceremonies, I
scarce understood it when I was told: But how∣ever
it gave me some Idea of this being an extra∣ordinary
Place, tho' I did not know what; and I
very▪ innocently ask'd him this foolish laughing
<PB N="252" REF="258"/>
Question; My Dear, you are mighty mannerly to
your empty Rooms, you bow as if the King was
there; he put it off with a Smile, and an Answer
that was indeed according to <HI>Solomon, Answer a
Fool in his Folly,</HI> My Dear, says he, 'tis our Custom
in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was no Fool; what he said was
very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, even all this while, and farther, I was
still blind; for a little while after I push'd into the
same Place with him, not out of Curiosity, but
meerly by Chance; but tho' the piece of Crimson
Damask say upon the Table, yet there was nothing
under it, nor did he make any Bow as before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo, Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Dear, there was no need of it then;
for to be sure the Idol was remov'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, however, as that was more than I
knew, it caus'd all my former Hesitations and Ob∣servations
to vanish, till they were renewed again
upon the following Occasion: He was taken ill
one Evening, in a Manner that alarm'd me very
much, and we were oblig'd to get him to Bed with
all speed; but just as he was undressing by the
Bedside, he started up in a kind of a Rapture, and
pulling a String which drew back a Curtain, he
cast up his Eyes towards a Picture that hung there,
and said some Words which I did not understand,
and I perceive he cross'd himself two or three
times on the Breast, and then stept into Bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>To one, that had liv'd in <HI>Italy,</HI> this had been
no Novelty at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I understand it well enough now,
but I did not then; however it was so plain then,
that it needed no Explanation to me; but it was
such a Surprize to me, that I thought I should
have fainted; my Heart sunk within me, and with
a Sigh, said I to my self, O Lord! I am undone! I
<PB N="253" REF="259"/>
thought I had spoke so softly, that nothing could
have overheard me; but yet so unhappy was my
Passion, that he heard the last Words, and raising
his Voice, <HI>My Dear,</HI> says he hastily, what's the
matter? what art thou undone for? I made him
no Answer, which increas'd his Eagerness to know
what ail'd me, but I declin'd it: At last, he pres∣sing
me still, I answer'd, My Dear, excuse me for
the present, I am a little frighted, with which he
rings a little Bell, that I us'd to ring for my Wo∣man,
and she being but in the next Room, came
running in; I bad her fetch me a little Bottle out
of my Closet, and taking a few Drops, rather by
a Counterfeit Illness than a real, put an end to his
Inquiry, and got him to sleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should e'en have charg'd him with it
downright, and have rav'd at him for a Rogue, that
had cheated and deluded me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sister, I did not do so; I was op∣press'd
with the Terror of it, and the Disappoint∣ment;
but my Affection stept in the way of all
Resentment; I lov'd him tenderly; and besides, it
was not a time for it; for he was really very ill,
and thought he should have dy'd; it was a Spice or
Taste of the same Distemper that did at last kill
him, for it was a Pleurisy; and after he had slept
a little, he wak'd again in such a Condition, that
frighted all the House, and we were forc'd to fetch
a Surgeon out of his Bed to let him Blood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sis</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that reliev'd him I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes it did; but I name it to tell you a Cir∣cumstance
which attended it; We had in the House
an old Man, an <HI>Italian,</HI> whom he always kept in the
Counting-house to copy his Letters, and translate his
<HI>Italian</HI> Accounts, and for such other Business as he
imploy'd him in and they call'd him Doctor:
The Surgeon we had sent for, being in Bed, did
<PB N="254" REF="260"/>
not come time enough, and he grew black and
desperately ill, which frighted me exceedingly; and
when he saw I was under a Surprize, he made
Signs (<HI>for he could not speak to be understood, he was so
Bad</HI>) to call up the old <HI>Italian:</HI> When he came into
the Room, he held out his Arm, and pointing at
it with his Finger, every one might understand that
he meant he should let him blood, upon which,
immediately the old Man call'd for things proper,
and I found he had a Launcet in his Pocket; I ask'd
him if he had been us'd to it, he said, yes, Madam,
I have let him blood several times before now: In
a word, he open'd a Vein, and it gave him Ease,
and he recover'd soon after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll lay a hundred Pound then, that Doctor
is a Priest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, he is so; and I knew it quickly
after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>And after he knew that you understood it,
did he not besiege you with his Discourses and Im∣portunities,
my Dear, to turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No really; at least not so, as I believe is usual,
he frequently let fall some Words about it, but with
great Modesty; for he was really a very good sort
of a Man, exceeding retir'd and devout; very man∣nerly
and respectful; he spoke once at Table, (for
sometimes my Spouse would ask me to let him sup
with us) and we had been talking very chearfully,
when the Doctor said something in <HI>Italian</HI> to his
Master, but gave me plain Reasons to know, that he
desired I should know what he said; upon which
my Spouse said to me, My Dear, what do you
think the Doctor says? I don't know, but I am
sure 'tis about me; Yes, says he, so it is; and he
says, I must tell you what it is, or else you will think
he is unmannerly to speak any thing in a Language
you do not understand; Well, pray, <HI>said I,</HI> what is
<PB N="255" REF="261"/>
it he says? What Pity it is, <HI>said my Spouse,</HI> such a fine
Genius as my Lady Wife is should not be within
the Pale of the Catholick Church? While my
Spouse was telling me this, he look'd very earnestly
at him, to observe when he repeated the Words,
and just as he had repeated them, the good old Fa∣ther
lift up his Eyes, and said some Words softly,
but with great Appearance of Serioustess, which,
it seems was, to pray co Christ to convert me;
and my Spouse looking very seriously too, cross'd
himself and said <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was dangerous Work indeed, Sister;
for the more serious they were in it, the more it
would have affected me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed so it did me; I answer'd to I Hus∣band,
My Dear, I hope I am; and if I thought I was
not, I would not sleep till I was; at which the
Doctor, my Spouse repeating the Words to him
shook his Head, and said, <HI>No, no!</HI> signifying, that
to be sure I was not; and added, he hop'd God
would hear his Prayers for me; but this was the
most that ever he offer'd that way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that was nothing, but what any Man
who thought himself in the right, might do, and
very modestly too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed he always kept himself rather at a
greater distance than we desired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but pray go back to the Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I told you my Husband recover'd from
his Illness, but it was otherwise with me; for be∣ing
now fully satisfy'd that my Spouse was a Papist,
it cast me down to that degree, and overwhelm'd
my Spirits, that I was scarce able to bear it, and
especially for want of some body to lodge my
Thoughts with, and open my Soul to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="256" REF="262"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did you not charge him with it
point blank? Did he not perceive your Disorder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did to be sure, and press'd me with the
utmost Tenderness and Importunity, to let him
know what griev'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and I should have told him of it in
his Ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, you are too tender a Wife
your self, not to know, that where there is a sincere
Affection, even the highest Resentment expresses
it self in the softest Terms: I could afflict my self
freely, but I could not think of afflicting him; and
tho' I do acknowledge I thought my self ill treated,
yet I could not use him ill in return.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, tell us what you said to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when he press'd me to let him know
what disturb'd me, I told him, I had rather bear my
Grief than complain to him; that I was too sen∣sible
he knew what I meant; when I said I was un∣done;
and I beg'd him not to oblige me to blame
him, for not having been just to me i Why, <HI>My
Dear, says he,</HI> why are you undone, if your Opini∣on
in Religion and mine may differ? Must it af∣fect
our Love? Cannot we be dear to one another
without entring into Disputes of that kind? Yes,
said I, my Dear, I know better than to enter into
Disputes with you; but I must reckon my self un∣done
for all that: Tears stopt my very Breath for
a while, for this was an open Acknowledgment of
his Profession; and I would fain have flatter'd my
self so much, as to hope there was yet some room
to have thought my self mistaken: When he saw me
so overwhelm'd, he came to me, and took me in
his Arms, and said all the kind things it is possible
to think of, to pacify me: My Dear, says he, tho'
you may think this a Grief to you, expert to have
it made up abundantly, by all that it is possible for
<PB N="257" REF="263"/>
Man to do to oblige you; and indeed if all the af∣fectionate
Things a Man could say or do, could
make it up, it was made up to me; if it was pos∣sible
for a Man to do any thing to make a Woman
forget her Disappointment, he did it; and this
from a Man too, who had a perfect Understand∣ing
of every thing that could oblige and engage
the Affections: In a word, no Man could do
more, or Woman desire more, to make up the
Loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, and pray tell me, did
it do? was it fully made up to you? Is it possible
that two can be happy in the Condition of Man
and Wife, where Opinions in Religion differ?
You have had the Experience of it to be sure in
its best Fortune, with all the Advantages imagin∣able:
Now be plain, and tell us, is it possible the
conjugal Felicity can be compleat? Was our dear
Mother in the right or no, Sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sister, you put hard upon me,
because I know I too much slighted my Mother's
Injunctions; and I remember I jested with you a∣bout
it, but I have paid for the Experiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Sister,</HI> those things are forgotten
long ago; I did not intend to reflect upon them;
but I ask upon a serious Account, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Sister, I must acknowledge it
is impossible: I say again, I find by sad Experi∣ence,
it is impossible: No Kindness, no Tender∣ness,
no Affection can make it up; the Condition
can never be happy, God faithfully served, Chil∣dren
rightly educated, the Mind perfectly easy, or
the Duty of the Relation faithfully performed,
where the Opinions in Religion differ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of Opinion also, that it would
have been the same, tho' your Differences had not
been so great as that of Papist and Protestant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="258" REF="264"/>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, all one! for we never entred into
the Question about our Principles; I resolv'd it
from the beginning, to avoid bringing on any thing
that might be unkind or disoblging between us,
and he approv'd it, and did the same for the same
Reason; so that I never, after the first Discourse, so
much as inquired what his Opinion was; it was
sufficient to have the Grief that we could not wor∣ship
God together, either abroad or at home; we
could not think of one another with Charity, but
as deceived Persons, out of the way of eternal
Felicity, out of God's Blessing and Protection;
we could not look upon one another but with
Sighs and sad Hearts: Again, we could never con∣verse
with one another upon religious Subjects,
for we could not enter upon the least serious thing,
but it lead us into Contradictions and wild distrac∣ted
Notions, which we were immediately forc'd to
take the Help of our Affections to suppress, that
we might not break out into Indecencies to one
another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, and what became of your
smart Answers to my Sister—, when she and
you talk'd of these Things, viz. That if he was
not of your Opinion, you would be of his; that
if he was a Christian; Catholick, you was a Catho∣lick
Christian and so you would have no Differ∣ence
about that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Sister, I was young, and did
not consider what I said; and besides, I did not in
the least suspect what my Sister suggested; and yet
so far I have kept up to it, we have, by the help
of abundance of good Humour on his side, and a
great deal of Love on both fides, avoided Differ∣ences
and Disputes upon that Subject: But alas'
Sister, that's but a Negative, and it can only be
said we did not quarrel <HI>which is a great deal to say
<PB N="259" REF="265"/>
too;</HI> but what's this to a happy Life? How was
our Family guided, our Children educated, and
how would they have been educated, if he had
liv'd? and how was God worshipp'd? he and his
Priest at their Mass in the Oratory or Chappel; I,
and my little unhappy Babies in my Chamber and
Closet, where I mourn'd over them continually,
(rather than pray'd over them) to think that some
time or other they should be snatch'd from me,
and brought up in Popery; nor would it have
been much otherwise, If he had been of any other
irreconcileable Opinion; for, as I told you before,
tho' I knew his Opinion, I never ask'd it; for any
Opinion, where there is not a Harmony in wor∣shipping,
a joyning in publick Prayer to God, and
in joynt serving him in our Families, is the same
thing, only not in the same Extreme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but you had no private Breaches a∣bout
it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never; we carefully avoided it; But
this is but an Evidence of the dreadful Consequen∣ces
of such Marriages in general; for where is there
a Couple that can say, <HI>as we could,</HI> that they
have had no Jars about it? And what Breaches
have religious Differences made in Families?
But if the Happiness is so little, and the evil Con∣sequences
so many, even with a Husband so ex∣quisitely
kind and obliging, and where a Woman
cannot say she has any one other thing to com∣plain
of, what must be the Case in other Families?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sister, you hint that the longer you
liv'd, the worse those Differences grew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it was impossible, Sister, but as we
grew forward, these things must have come more
in our way: We have four Children, and Mr.—
was not a Man so indifferent in his Religion, as to
be more careless about the Souls of his Children, that
<PB N="260" REF="266"/>
I assure you; and tho' he left them entirely to
my Management, when they were little; yet he
would hint sometimes, that he hop'd I would leave
them free, when they grew up, to choose for them∣selves,
as God should inlighten them; and that at
least we should both stand neuter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could you say to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I could not tell how far I could
promise that, for if I thought my self in the right
way to Heaven, I could but ill answer it to him
that gave me my Children, to stand still and see
them go wrong, and not endeavour to persuade
them (at least) to choose better for themselves: He
told me, that was an Argument just as strong on
his side, as it was on mine; and he added smiling,
How shall we do then to agree, <HI>my Dear,</HI> when it
comes to that? I hope we shall not love less than
we do now. I told him, I had a great many me∣lancholy
Thoughts about it; and thus at last we
were always fain to drop the Discourse; but to this
Hour I cannot conceive how we should have done
to have divided our Childrens Instruction between
us, if he had liv'd to see them grown up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my Dear, God has otherwise order'd
it; and I hope the Children wilt have the Benefit
of a good Instruction now without that Inter∣ruption.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, I perceive you do not know
their Case yet, and this is a remaining Grief to
me that I have not mention'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that, Child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, by his Will he has appointed
the old Priest, who I nam'd above, to be Tutor
to my two Sons, and has settled his Estate so, that
unless the Trustees bring them up Roman Catho∣licks,
a great deal of the Estate goes from them; so
that I am to be robb'd of my Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="261" REF="267"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am surpriz'd at that; why I never heard
a word of it! and what has he done with his two
Daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has left them to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you know this before, Child? Had you
any Discourse about it before he died?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, as much as the Violence of his
Distemper would admit; I intreated, I perswaded,
I argued, as much as Tears and my oppressed
Thoughts would allow me; for I thought my
Heart would have burst while I talk'd to him, to
see his Condition, whom I lov'd as my own Soul;
and to think what was to befal my Children, you
can hardly conceive what a Time it was to me; it
wounds my very Spirit to look back upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>it was a very bitter thing no doubt: But
what said he to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He beg'd of me not to importune him:
He told me, it was far from being an Unkindness
to me, but his Conscience oblig'd him to it, and
he could not die in Peace, if he did not, as far as
in him lay, provide for the Souls of his Children.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if it was Conscience, how came it
to pass he did not do the like by his Daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he said, he thought I had a right to
their Government as a half of the Family; for,
my Dear, says he, we are Partners; but, says he,
I intreat you, and as far as I am able to do it,
injoyn you to it, let the poor innocent Babes be
reconcil'd to the Church, and brought up in the
Catholick Faith; and I hope you will in God's
due time embrace it your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was you able to say to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I bless God I made no Promise about my
Children s nor indeed was I able to speak to him
for Grief; for he was in such Agonies, that my
Heart could not hold to stay by him; and the
<PB N="262" REF="268"/>
next Morning he died, and now I am a dreadful
Example of the miserable Condition of a marry'd
State, where Principles of Religion differ, tho'
with the best Husband in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my Dear, do not afflict your self now
about your Sons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not afflict my self, Sir! is that possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, they shall not be bred up Papists
I'll assure you, for all what he has done to bring
it to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! Sir, they will be taken away from
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; nor shall they be taken away
from you neither; our Law gives you a Right to
the bringing up your own Children, and as for
the Doctor, I'll ingage he shall give you no Di∣sturbance;
he knows his own Circumstances, and
I'll take care that he shall take it for a Favour to be
conceal'd here, and leave all to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then the Estate will go from my Chil∣dren
too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not, neither; but if it should, you
have enough for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that is none of my Care; let me
but keep them from a Wrong Education, I'll wil∣lingly
leave that Part to fall as it will.</P>

<P>Only by all that he could ever devise;
<HI>except, as I said before,</HI> for I must do that Justice to
his Memory, that he never offer'd any thing that
was rough, or threatning, or limiting, or unkind;
but all the contrary to the highest Extreme.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the Effect of his extraordinary
good Breeding, and his being so much a Gentle∣man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="263" REF="269"/>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that altogether, Sister, tho' that might
joyn; but it was the Effect of an excellent Dis∣position,
and of an inexpressible Affection to me in
particular; for otherwise he was the most zealous
Man in his Way that ever was heard of, and
thought every body an Enemy to him, that would
not be of his own Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he never go about to bribe you to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sister! very frequently; and that with
all the Subtilty of Invention in the World; for he
was always giving me Presents upon that very Ac∣count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Presents to a Wife! what do they signify?
'tis but taking his Money out of one Pocket, and
putting it into the other; they must all be ap∣prais'd,
Child, in the personal Estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has been quite otherwise with him in∣deed,
Sir; for he has made it a C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause in his Will,
that all the Presents he gave me shall be my own,
to bestow how I please; besides all the rest that he
has left me more than he was oblig'd to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they seem to be considerable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has, first and last, given me above
3000 <HI>l.</HI> in Presents, and most of them on this very
Account; but one was very extraordinary, I
mean to that purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose that is your Diamond Cross?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so; he brought it home in a little
Case, and coming into my Room one Morning
before I was drest, hea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing I was alone, he told
me smiling and very pleasant, he was come to say
his Prayers to rne: I confess I had been a little out
of humour just at that time, having been full of
sad Thoughts all the Morning about the grand
Point, and I was going to have given him a very
unkind Answer; but his Looks had so much Good∣ness
and Tenderness always in them, that when I
<PB N="264" REF="270"/>
look'd up at him, I could retain no more Resent∣ment:
Indeed, Sister, it was impossible to be an∣gry
with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might well be in Humour indeed,
when he brought you a Present worth above six
hundred Pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I had not seen the Present, when
what I am telling you; past between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I ask Pardon for interrupting you
pray go on where you left off, when he told you
he was come to say his Prayers to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told him I hop'd he would not make an
Idol of his Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was that the ill-natur'd Answer you
were about to give him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed; I was a going to tell him, he
need not worship me, he had Idols enough in the
House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That had been bitter and unkind
indeed; I hope you did not say so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I did not; nor would I have said
so for a thousand Pound; it would have griev'd
me every time I had reflected on it afterwards as
long as I had liv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so very apt a Return, I dare say I
should not have brought my Prudence to have
master'd the Pleasure of such a Repartee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, 'tis a sorry Pleasure that is
taken in grieving a kind Husband; besides, Sister,
as it was my great Mercy that my Husband strove
constantly to make his Difference in Religion as
little troublesome and offensive to me as possible,
it would very ill have become me to make it my
Jest; it had been a kind of bespeaking the Unea∣sinesses
which it was my Happiness to avoid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="265" REF="271"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you had more Temper than I should
have had, I dare say; but I must own you were
in the right; Come, pray how did you go on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he answer'd, he hop'd he worship'd
no Idols but me, and if he err'd in that Point,
whoever reprov'd him, he hop'd I would not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true too; besides, 'tis not so
often that Men make Idols of their Wives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, while he was saying this, he pulls
out the Jewel, and opening the Case, takes a small
Crimson String that it hung to, and put it about my
Neck, but kept the Jewel in his Hand, so that I
could not see it; and then taking me in his Arms,
sit down, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> which I did upon a
little Stool, then he kneeled down just before me,
and kissing the Jewel, let it go, saying something
in <HI>Italian,</HI> which I did not understand; and then
looking up in my Face, Now, my Dear, says he,
you are my Idol.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, 'tis well he is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, how can you say such Words
to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would certainly have conquer'd
you at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the tenderest and most engaging Tem∣per,
the sincerest and warmest Affection in Nature
could have done it, he would have done it, that's
certain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I make no doubt but they are the
most dangerous Weapons to attack a Woman's Princi∣ples;
I cannot but think them impossible to resist;
Passion, Unkindness, and all sorts of conjugal Vio∣lence,
of which there is a great Variety in a mar∣ry'd
Life, are all nothing to them; you remember,
Sister, some Lines on another Occasion, but very
much to the Case.
<Q><L>Force may indeed the Heart invade,</L>
<L>But Kindness only can perswad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="266" REF="272"/>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant that 'tis difficult to resist the Influ∣ence
of so much Affection, and every thing that
came from so sincere a Principle, and to a Mind
prepossess'd with all the Sentiments of Tenderness
and Kindness possible to be express'd, made a deep
Impression, but I thank God I stood my Ground.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, you would not have stood it
long I am perswaded; and this is one of the great
Hazards a Woman runs in marrying a Man of a
differing Religion, or a differing Opinion from her
self, <HI>viz.</HI> that her Affection to her Husband is her
worst S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are; and so that which is her Duty and
her greatest Happiness, is made the most dangerous
Gulph she can fall into; well might our dear Mo∣ther
warn us from marrying Men of different Opi∣nions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, I acknowledge it; my
Love was my Temptation; my Affection to my
Husband went always nearest to stagger my Reso∣lution;
I was in no Danger upon any other Ac∣count.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but pray go on about the Jewel;
what said you to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, Sister, I'll be very plain with you:
When he kiss'd the Jewel on his Knees, and mut∣ter'd
as I tell you, in <HI>Italian,</HI> I was rather provok'd,
than oblig'd; and I said, I think you are saying
your Prayers indeed, my Dear; tell me what are
you doing? what did you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I should have been frighted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, let me confess to you, fine
Presents, flattering Words, and the affectionate
Looks of so obliging, so dear, and so near a Rela∣tion
are dreadful Things, when they assault Princi∣ples;
the glittering Jewel had a strange Influence,
and my Affections began to be too partial on his
Side: O let no Woman that values her Soul ven∣ture
<PB N="267" REF="273"/>
into the Arms of a Husband of a differing
Religion! the kinder he is, the more likely to
undo her; every thing that indears him to her,
doubles her Danger; the more she loves him, the
more she inclines to yield to him; the more he
loves her, the stronger are the Bonds, by which he
draws heri and her only Mercy would be to have
him barbarous and unkind to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed a sad Case, where to be miser∣able
is the only Safety; but so it is no doubt, and
such is the Case of every Woman that is thus un∣suitably
match'd; if her Husband is kind, he is a
Snare to her; if unkind, he is a Terror to her;
his Love, which is his Duty, is her Ruin, and his
slighting her, which is his Scandal, is her Pro∣tection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was my Case, dear Sister; such a Jewel!
such a Husband! How could I speak an unkind
Word? Every thing he did was so engaging, every
thing he said was so moving, what could I say or
do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; and that makes me say, he
would have conquer'd you at last.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I can't tell what he might have done
if he had liv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but to the Jewel: What said you
to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I stood up and thank'd him, with a kind
of Ceremony; but told him, I wish'd it had been
rather in any other Form. Why, my Dear, says he,
should not the two most valuable Forms in the
World be plac'd together? I told him, that as he
plac'd a religious Value upon it, he should have it
rather in another Place; He told me, my Breast
should be his Altar; and so he might adore with.
a double Delight; I told him, I thought he was
a little prophane; and since I did not place the
<PB N="268" REF="274"/>
same Value upon it, or make the same Use of it,
as he did, I might give him Offence by meer Ne∣cessity,
and make that Difference which we had
both avoided with so much Care, break in upon
us in a Case not to be resisted. He answer'd, No,
my Dear, I am not going to bribe your Principles,
much less force them: Put you what Value you
think fit upon it, and give me the like Liberty: I
told him, I hop'd I should not undervalue it as his
Present, if he did not overvalue it upon another
Account. He return'd warmly, My Dear, the
last is impossible; and for the first 'tis a Trifle;
give it but Leave to hang where I have plac'd it,
that's all the Respect I ask you to show it on my
Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, that was a Favour you would not
deny if a Stranger had given it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, you are a Stranger to the Case;
if you had seen what was the Consequence of it,
you would have been frighted, or perhaps have
fallen quite out with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot imagine what Consequences
you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, first of all, he told me, that now
he would be perfectly easy about my Salvation,
and would cease to persue me with Arguments or
Intreaties in religious Matters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could he mean by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why he said, he was sure that blessed Form
that hung so near my Heart, would have a miracu∣lous
Influence some time or other, and I should be
brought Home into the Bosom of the Catholick
Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I should have ventur'd all that,
and have slighted the very Thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot imagine what Stress he laid on
it; now he said, every good Catholick that saw me
<PB N="269" REF="275"/>
but pass by them, would pray for me; and every
one in particular would exorcise me by the Passion
of Christ out of the Chains of Heresy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>What said you to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I put it off with a Smile, but my Heart
was full, I scarce knew how to hold; and he per∣ceived
it easily, and broke off the Talk a little; but
he fell to it again, till he saw the Tears stood in my
Eyes, when he took me in his Arms, and kiss'd
me again, kiss'd my Neck where the Cross hung,
and then kiss'd the Jewel, repeating the Word
<HI>Jesu</HI> two or three times, and lest me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was all Superstition, Sister, I should
not have born it, I would have thrown the Jewel
in his Face, or on the Ground, and have set my
Foot upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, you would not have done so
I am sure; neither was it my Business to do so;
my Business was not to quarrel with my Husband
about his Religion, which it was now too late to
help, but to keep him from being uneasy about
mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not have had so much Patience;
I would not have liv'd with him I do not think it
had been my Duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Sister, that's expresly contrary to the
Scripture, where this very Case is stated in the
plainest Manner imaginable, <HI>The Woman that hath a
Husband which believeth not, if he will dwell with her,
let her not leave him.</HI> I Cor. vii. 13.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true indeed; I spoke rashly,
Sister, in that; but it was a Case, I confess, I do not
know what I should have done in it; I would not
have wore it then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That had been very disobliging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="270" REF="276"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have oblig'd him to have forborn
his little idolatrous Tricks then, and used them on
other Occasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That had been to desire him not to be a
Roman Catholick: Why, in foreign Countries, that
are Popish, as I understand, they never go by a
Cross, whether it be on the Road, or on any
Building, but they pull off their Hats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they do, my Dear, and often kneel
down, tho' it be in the Dirt, and say over their
Prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to tell you how many At∣tacks
I had of that kind when I wore this Jewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt it; especially if he brought
any Strangers into the Room: How did you do,
Child, when the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ambassador din'd at
your House? Had you it on then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, my Spouse desired me to put it
on, and I could not well deny him: But I did not
know how to behave; for the Ambassador and all
his Retinue paid so many Bows and Homages to
me, or to the Cross, that I scarce knew what to
do with my self, nor was I able to distinguish their
good Manners from their Religion, and it was
well I did not then understand <HI>Italian,</HI> for, as my
Dear told me afterwards, they said a great many
religious things that would have given me Offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those things are so frequent in <HI>Italy,</HI> that
the Protestant Ladies take no notice of them, and
yet they all wear Crosses, but sometimes put them
out of sight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did so afterwards; I lengthen'd the String
it hung to, that it might hang a little lower, but
it was too big, if it went within my Stays, it
would hurt me, nor was it much odds to him;
for if he saw the String, he knew the Cross was
there, and it was all one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="271" REF="277"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did he use any Ceremony to it after
the first Time?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Always, when he first came into any Room
where I was, he was sure to give me his Knee
with his Bow, and kiss the Cross as well as his
Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should never have born it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You could never have resisted it any more
than I, for I did what I could; but his Answer
was clear, My Dear, says he, take no notice of
me, let my Civilities be to you; take them all to
your self, I cannot shew you too much Respect;
believe it is all your own, and be essy with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could he bid you believe, what you
knew to be otherwise: why did you not leave it
off, and reproach him with the Difference.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, I did so for Months together:
But then he doubled his Ceremonies, and told me,
I only mortify'd him then by obliging him to re∣verence
the Place where once the blessed Figure
had been lodg'd, as the holy Pilgrims worship'd the
Sepulchre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was too hard for you every way, Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and would have been too hard for you
too, if you had had him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is my Mercy that I had him not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it was my Mercy too, that as I had
him, I had less Inconvenience with the unhappy
Circumstance, than I must have had perhaps with
any other Man of his Principles in the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, only this I must add, <HI>viz.</HI>
that those engaging Ways would certainly, first or
last, have brought you to Popery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Sister; but I cannot say when
I seriously reflect on it, how far I might have been
left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="272" REF="278"/>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dear, let me ask you a Question or
two about that: I know the first Method they
take in such Cases is, to let you see that you have
been mistaken in your Notions about Popery;
that the Difference is not so great as has been sug∣gested
to you; that we are all Christians; that we
worship the same God, believe the same Creed,
expect eternal Life by the Merits of the same Sa∣viour,
and the like; and by this Method they
bring us at first not to have such frightful Ideas of
the Roman Catholick Religion as we had before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; and this I had frequently in
Discourse; and, I confess, such Discourse had some
Effect on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It lessen'd the Aversion you had to
them no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true, they became not so frightful to
me as before; but they had another Argument,
which my Dear often us'd to me, and it was this;
<HI>My Dear, says he,</HI> all your own Divines, and all
that have written on these Subjects, own, that a
Roman Catholick is in the way of Life; that a
Papist, as you call us, <HI>may be sav'd;</HI> that it is pos∣sible
for us to go to Heaven; our Church have no
room to believe so of the Protestants; Why if you
may go to Heaven among us, should you not joyn
with us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what Answer I should have
to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what your Answer would have
been, but I'll tell you what mine was; I told him,
I did not know but it might be so; and I was wil∣ling
to have as much Charity as I had Affection
for him; but as for my self, I was sure I could not
go to Heaven that Way, because I must act against
my own Light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="273" REF="279"/>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the true Answer indeed: What
could he say to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he told me, he would pray for me,
that I might be farther inlightned; and he did not
doubt but to prevail; I thank'd him, and told him,
I would do the same for him; and that tho' per∣haps
it might not be with so strong a Faith, I was
sure it would be with as earnest a Desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you stood your Ground nobly,
Sister; but 'tis a Mercy to you, that your Perse∣verance
was tried no farther; 'tis a dreadful thing
to have so dangerous an Enemy so near one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, there lay my Danger; for I must
own, Words spoken with so much Tenderness have
a singular Effect, and sink deeper on the Mind
than others, especially where the Affection is so
mutual as it was with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sister, do you think in time his
Tenderness, and his affectionate way of treating
you would not have abated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I often fear'd it, but indeed I never found
it; sometimes I suggested it to him, that I fear'd
it; and one Day I told him, that <HI>if I did not turn,</HI>
I was afraid <HI>he would:</HI> He guess'd what I meant,
but would have me explain my self: Why, My
Dear, says I, when I reflect what your Thoughts
are about Protestants, that they are out of the
Pale of the Church, and in a Condition that they
cannot be saved, I cannot but apprehend, that if
I do not come over to your Opinion, your Love
to me will abate, and at last turn into a stated A∣version
and Hatred: How can you love an Object
which you think God hates? My Dear, says he,
taking me very affectionately in his Arms, I will
prevent all your Fears, by telling you, that <HI>were
what you mention possible,</HI> it could not be, till I utter∣ly
despair'd of your being ever brought over to
<PB N="274" REF="280"/>
the Church; and I shall never be brought to be∣lieve,
but God will open your Eyes first or last;
and besides my earnest Desire to persuade you and
win you to embrace the true Religion, will teach
me to do it by all the Tenderness and Love that it
is possible for me to shew you; for to be unkind to
you, would be the way to drive you farther off;
But be it as it will, I can never abate my Affection
to you; and, <HI>my Dear,</HI> says he, (with the most o∣bliging
passionate Air of Concern that it was pos∣sible
to shew,) that I hope, to love you tender∣ly
and violently is not the way to keep you at a
distance from the Church, but rather to draw you,
to engage you, and let you see, that Peace, Love
Joy, Charity, and all the Vertues of a Christian,
are to be found among us; and not that we are
Furies and Tyrants, as we have been represented;
and when he had said this, holding me still in his
Arms, he kiss'd me several Times, and went on:
My Dear, says he, let God alone to change your
Heart his own way; I'll never take any Method
but that of loving you sincerely and most passio∣nately
while I live, and praying for you even af∣ter
I am in Heaven; while he said this, I saw such
an inexpressible Tenderness in his Countenance,
and every Word came from him with such Passion,
that I could not hold from Tears: But he had not
done yet, for while he held me in one Arm, he
put his other Hand in his Pocket, and taking out
his Pocket-book, he bad me open it; I open'd it,
and there drop'd out a loose Paper doubled pretty
thick, which I took up, and went to put it in a∣gain:
Take that Paper, my Dear, says he, and
put it up; you shall have a Pledge for the Conti∣nuance
or my Affection to you, whether you
change your Opinion or no: I open'd it, but
<PB N="275" REF="281"/>
could read very little of it, for I had but newly
begun to learn <HI>Italian:</HI> What is it, my Dear? said
I: It is, said he, an Assignment on the Bank of
<HI>Genoa</HI> for 2000 Ducats a year, and it shall be made
over to your Father in Trust for you, and to who∣ever
you will bestow it after you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sister, I would never tell this Story
to any Protestant Lady, that was in the least danger
of marrying a Roman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Child, if her Story be told with it,
I think it may be told to Advantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may teach them indeed to pray, <HI>Lead
us not into Temptation.</HI> Well, Sister, I must repeat
what I said before to you, tho' it does grieve you;
'tis your great Mercy that he is dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>O do not speak such a Word, Sister, it
wounds my very Soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prayanswer me this short Question then,
would you marry such another Papist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's not such another upon Earth, Sister
and besides, how can you name the Word? That's
the unkindest thing you could think of; I must
break off the Discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not call it unkind; I do not mean it
the way you take it: Suppose Things at the re∣motest
distance you can, or suppose it to be any
other body's Case, would you advise any other
Person that had such an Offer, I say, would you
advise them to marry such another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, not to be a Princess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am answer'd; and I must own, I should
take them for distracted if they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unless the Lady resolv'd to turn Papist;
and if that, she would do best to do it before-hand,
openly and avowedly, that she might not be under
<PB N="276" REF="282"/>
the Reflection of doing it on a worse Account,
viz by Compulsion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after you have said so many Things
of him, that are enough to recommend him, not to
the Affection, but even to the Admiration, of any
one; what can you say to persuade any young
Woman not to think that you were very happy in
him, and that consequently they would be so with
such another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sister! do not suggest that I was happy
with him; I had as few happy Hours, as it was
possible for any one to have, that ever had a good
Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you convince any one of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sister, it is plain to any one that
knows wherein the Happiness of Life consists; It's
true, I wanted nothing; I liv'd in the abundance
of all things; I had the best humour'd Husband
on Earth, and one that lov'd me to an Extreme;
which had not our Case indeed call'd for so much
Affection another way, would have been a Sin;
for, in a word, he sum'd up all his earthly Felicity
in his Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were to give that Account to the
Gentlemen of this Age, they would say you were
writing the Character of a Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter for that; it was his Mercy
and mine too; for if it had been otherwise, we
had been the miserablest Creatures alive; it
was bad enough as it was; and all that knew him,
will grant that he was no Fool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what do you think then would have
been the Consequence, if, <HI>as you say,</HI> he had lov'd
you less? Wherein must you have been miserable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="277" REF="283"/>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sister, if his abundant Affection had
not closed every Debate with Kindness, whither
must we have run? If he had not check'd all the
Forwardness of his religious Zeal for converting
me, by his Love to me, to what Severity in our
mutual Reproaches should we have gone on! in a
word, Sister, I must have turn'd, or turn'd out of
Doors; I must have been a Papist, or we must
have parted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sister, you know there's Mr. <HI>P</HI>—
and his Wife are in the very same Case, and yet
they agree well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Dear Sister,</HI> How can you name them! He
is a Papist, and she is a Protestant, and when the
Name is taken away, it is hard to tell whether ei∣ther
of them have any Religion or no, nor do
they care one Farthing which way either goes;
People that can live easy without Religion, may
live easy with any Religion; that is not the Case
we are speaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is a Difference there, I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if, Sister, a religious Life be <HI>the only
Heaven upon Earth,</HI> as we have been taught to be∣lieve,
tell me, <HI>if you can represent such a Case to your
self,</HI> what must it be for two to live together, who
place their Happiness really in such a Life as we
call religious, but differ so extremely about what
Religion to build it upon? That agree in the gene∣ral
but not in the Particulars; that aim mutually at
the End, viz. <HI>going to Heaven,</HI> but turn Back to
Back as to the way thither? Can a religious Life
be form'd between such as these! and if not, then
they are mutually deprived of that Heaven upon
Earth, which, <HI>as you and I agree,</HI> is alone to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in a religious Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="278" REF="284"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; but then in such a Case the
Enjoyment must be reserved and singular, and a
Woman must keep her Religion to herself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will allow her then to be depriv'd
at once of all social Religion, of all Family-Reli∣gion,
and by Consequence of all the Comfort of a
religious Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay that is true, and I am not speaking
for it; but asking your Experience, whether with
so tender a Husband, as you had, it might not be o∣therwise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Sister, his Tenderness, <HI>as I said be∣fore</HI>
was my great Mercy, as it made him beat
with my Obstinacy, <HI>as he called it:</HI> Had he had the
same Tenderness, and been indifferent in his Prin∣ciples,
I might have turn'd him; but had he want∣ed
that Tenderness, and yet been as zealous in his
Religion as he was, he must have turn'd me, or I
must have liv'd a dreadful Life with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find he was a mighty religious Man in
his way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the greatest degree imaginable devout,
and very serious, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, tho' he was mistaken in his Princi∣ples,
yet he was the more sober, the more honest,
and every way the better prepared to be a good
Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>His Devotion made him, without doubt,
the better Man: But if it had not been for the
Restraints of his Affection, it had certainly made
him the worse Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that in this Question of marrying a
Man of a different Opinion in Religion, you
suppose, that the more devout and serious the
Person is in his way, the worse Husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="279" REF="285"/>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without question it is so: The Zeal in
their own Opinions makes them always uneasy and
impatient with their Wives, teazing and baiting
them with impertinent Disputes, and even driving
them by force of restless Importunities, (which, by
the way, is the worst sort of Persecution) into a
Compliance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in that Part: But, Sister,
you say, that even when your Husband's Love
was your Protection from these Importunities, you
were yet unhappy, and could not be able to lead
a religious Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sister, I did not say so; I said we
could not have a religious Family; all social Reli∣gion
was lost; mutual Help and Assistance in Re∣ligion
were wanting; publick worshipping God in
the Family as a House, could not be set up; Edu∣cation
and Instruction of Children was all de∣stroy'd;
Example to Servants and Inferiours all
spoil'd; nothing could be of Religion, but what
was meerly personal and retir'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There indeed you are right, Niece.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you, Madam, from my Experi∣ence,
that next to the having the Husband and
Wife be religious, or at least religiously inclined,
they that would have a religious Family, should
take as much Care as possible to have religious Ser∣vants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree with you in that, my Dear, with
all my Heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is impossible to preserve the necessary
Rules of a religious Family without it, or to have
a due Regard shewn to the Orders which must be
given on that Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="280" REF="286"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, Child, I go farther than that; I in∣sist,
that our Servants ought to be so chosen, as to
be of the same Opinions too in Religion as our
selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not so much consider'd that Part in∣deed;
but I believe, Madam, the Reasons for it
are very good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a great deal to say to that Part from
my own Experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so have I too, Madam, from what
I have seen in some Families of my Acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have seen enough of it in my little Fami∣ly,
to make me resolve, that while I have a Fa∣mily,
and can keep any Servants, I will entertain
none but such as worship God the same way as I
worship him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did so before you took them, I
hope you mean so, Sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed I do mean so too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must put in an Exception Niece, there,
in behalf of poor ignorant Creatures, that may
come into a Family untaught, and are willing to
be instructed in Things that are good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not what to say to that Part, be∣cause
I am but ill qualified for a Schoolmistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, we will discourse of this by it self,
<HI>Niece,</HI> for I have a great deal to say upon that
Subject</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in the mean time, Child, let us go on
where we left off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was as much Religion in our House,
as it was possible there should be, in our Circum∣stances;
for both of us desired it in general, and
pursued it in particular, only we could not joyn in
the Manner; and it was a perfect Scene of Con∣fusion,
to see how Religion was carry'd on among
<PB N="281" REF="287"/>
us; the Servants were some Papists, some Prote∣stants,
some Pagans; for we had three <HI>East-Indian
Blacks</HI> and one <HI>Negro</HI> among our People: The
Christian Servants were every now and then toge∣ther
by the Ears about perswading the Negro to
turn Christian, and be baptiz'd, but could not bear
to think which sort of Christian the poor Creature
should be; one of our Men, an <HI>Italian,</HI> would
have him be a Papist, and the other would have
him be a Protestant; and the poor Negro was so
confounded between them, that he could not tell
what to do: The Negro was a sensible inquisitive
Fellow, and had by meer asking Questions on
both sides, gotten a great deal of Knowledge of
Religion; but was meerly stop'd in his Search af∣ter
farther Particulars by the impertinent Quarrels
of those Servants who pretended to instruct him:
Both told him he must believe a God, a future
State, a Heaven, a Hell, a Resurrection to Life,
or to Death, and that he must be saved by a Re∣deemer:
They agreed exactly in their Description
of the Joys of eternal Life, the Torments of Hell,
and particularly they had joyned in giving the poor
Negro a frightful Apprehension of Hell, as the
Reward of his doing wickedly, and of the Devil as
a Tempter, an Enemy and Tormentor; so that the
poor Fellow would pray to God very heartily to
save him from Hell, and to keep him from the
Devil.</P>
</SP>
<P>But when these poor ignorant Fellows began to
instruct him how to worship God, and who to look
to as his Redeemer and Saviour; to talk to him
about reading the Scriptures, and such Things,
they fell out to the last Degree; the <HI>English</HI> Foot∣man
told the <HI>Italian</HI> he was an Idolater, and that
was worse than a Heathen; that <HI>Negum,</HI> (<HI>for so the
poor Negro was called</HI>) was as good a Christian as he,
<PB N="282" REF="288"/>
for tho' he did not worship in the Name of Christ,
yet as he, (<HI>the Italian Footman</HI>) worship'd a piece of
Wood for a Saviour, Christ would not accept him;
and it was as bad as <HI>Negum</HI>'s worshipping a Hob-Goblin,
or any Thing else. The <HI>Italian</HI> told him,
he was a Heretick, and his Religion was no Reli∣gion
at all; that he was an Enemy to God, and
to the Church; and told <HI>Negum,</HI> that if he be∣liev'd
what that Fellow said, the Devil would take
him away alive. They had many Quarrels about
it; but one Day above the rest they came to that
height, that they fell to fighting; it seems, the
rest of the Servants had parted them before their
Master or I heard of it; but as we were both walk∣ing
together in the Evening in our Garden, we by
meer chance saw the Negro in the Kitchin-Garden
crying: His Master saw him first, and called him
to us; and the Fellow came with a Book in his
Hand, but terribly afraid his Matter should be
angry.</P>
<P>What's the Matter, <HI>Negum?</HI> says his Master;
and so they began to talk.</P>
<P><HI>Negro.</HI> No muche Matter, Sir, no muche.</P>
<P><HI>Master.</HI> Why you were crying, <HI>Negum:</HI> What
did you cry about? Has any Body beat you.</P>
<P><HI>Neg.</HI> No muche cry, no beate me.</P>
<P><HI>Ma.</HI> What then; <HI>Negum?</HI> What Book have you
got there?</P>
<P><HI>Neg.</HI> Indeede me no go away<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Kneels down.</NOTE>, Sir; me no go
if me be Christian<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Fellow, it seems, was afraid his Master would
think if he turn'd Christian, he would be baptiz'd, and
so think himself free; and he kneeled down to his Master,
to beg him not to be angry.</NOTE> no indeede.</P>
<SP>
<PB N="283" REF="289"/>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, thou shalt be a Christian, <HI>Ne∣gum,</HI>
if thou hast a Mind to it; God forbid any
body should hinder thee: What Book's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bible-Book: me reade this Book to be
Christian.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you understand the Languages; read
them both: But, poor Fellow, thou hast got but
two sorry Teachers.</P>
</SP>
<P>When he gave the Books back to him, and bad
him read them both, he turn'd to me; My Dear,
<HI>says he,</HI> thefe Fellows pretend to instruct this poor
Negro in the Christian Religion, when they can't
agree about it themselves I am sure; upon which
<HI>Negum</HI> makes his Master a Bow, and puts in his
Word.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeedè, they no agree; they sighté
just now about teachè me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeedé they fightè just now; they no
teache me, <HI>one say,</HI> me go to the Devil <HI>t'other
say,</HI> me go to the Devil; they no teachè me to go
<PB N="284" REF="290"/>
away from the Devil; they make me no know
what I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And was that it you cry'd about, <HI>Negum?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeedè, me cry to go to the Devil;
me would go away from the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must pray to God to keep you from the
Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed, me do pray God keep away
the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must pray to God to teach you too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neg.</SPEAKER>
<P>God teachè mè! No, <HI>Augnstino teachè me!</HI>
No, <HI>William</HI> teachè me! God teachè me, how that?</P>
<P>Here my Spouse found, how the Case stood, and
turning to me, My Dear, <HI>said he,</HI> these Fellows
will quarrel continually about this poor Man, and
so in the End he will be brought rather to abhor
the Christian Religion in general, than to turn
Christian at all, white one pulls him one way, and
one another: Now what Course must you and I
take? I cannot pretend to desire him to be made
a Protestant, I am sure you won't desire him to be
a Catholick; and so the poor Fellow must be lost:
<HI>I told him,</HI> it was a critical Case, in which I knew
not how to act; but as they were his Servants in
particular, and shat he brought this <HI>Negro</HI> out of
<HI>Italy</HI> with him, I thought they were to be at his
Disposal and Direction rather than mine: My
Dear, <HI>said he,</HI> there is nothing mine but what is
yours; don't shift it off so, but tell me what shall
I do? I confess I trembled when he said so; for I
was afraid some Debate would fall in between us,
in Consequence of the Case; however I answer'd
him thus; My Dear, you determined before for
me, what you might be sure would be my
Thoughts; but what can I determine about your
Servants? Well, my Dear, says he, I'll do as <HI>So∣lomon</HI>
<PB N="285" REF="291"/>
did in the Case of dividing the Child; I'll
shew you that I am the truest Lover of his Soul,
I mean of us two, for rather than he should not
be taught to worship God at all, let him be taught
the Way of the Country where we are; if we
divide, as our two Men have done, he will not
be taught at all.</P>
<P>Upon this Principle he acted, and consented I
should act in it as I saw Cause; upon which, I
sent the Negro down to a Country Tenant we
have in <HI>Essex,</HI> upon pretence to learn to plow and
sow, and do Country Work, and there I kept
him near a Twelvemonth; at the same time the
Farmer being a very sober religious Man, and
having a Hint from me what to do, this poor Ne∣gro
is become a very sensible religious Fellow, has
been baptized now two years ago, and I think
verily is an excellent Christian.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did he run away, or claim his Free∣dom
upon his being baptized?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No not he; but I gave him his Freedom,
when his Master died, and gave him Wages, and
he is an extraordinary Servant I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Husband strained a Point of Religion
there, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you see what Principle he did it
from he law the Fellow was in a Protestant
Country, and would either be a Protestant at last,
or nothing at all; and he rather chose he should
be a Protestant, than remain a Heathen, or lose
all desire of being a Christian, for, sayshe, God
can inlighten him farther by a Miracle, when he
pleases; and then having been taught the general
Notions of Religion, he would be the easier
brought to embrace the true Church; but if he
continues a Heathen, he will have no Knowledge
at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="286" REF="292"/>
<SPEAKER>Eld. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you would not have shewn
the same Charity for his Church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, I did not shew so much Zeal
for the Soul of the poor Negro, as I think I ought
to have done, or so much Charity, as he did;
but had other Thoughts at that time to take me
up: However, Sister, to bring this back to the
first Discourse, you see by this how fatal in a Fa∣mily
Difference in Principles is within the same
House, and had he not been by ass'd by an extra∣ordinary
Temper, as well as by an uncommon
Charity, we had been the most miserable Couple
on Earth so that, in short, there is not one Part
of a Woman's Life in such a Circumstance that is
not dreadfully embarrass'd, if she has any Sense
of her own Principles, or her Husband any Sense
of his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you not think then, that there may
be a Case of some kind or other, in which a Man
and a Woman may be happy together, tho' there
be a difference in Opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, I do not think there is: I do
not think you can name a Case, in which it is
possible to say with Truth, that they can be hap∣py;
that is, that there is not some Interruption to
their Happiness on that very Account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is, supposing them to be both relgi∣ously

<P>Nay, that need not be supposed; for we
go upon our Mother's old Principle, that without
a religious Family there can be no Happiness of
Life: If they are as I said before, indifferent a∣bout
Religion, then there is no Happiness at all
in our sense or Felicity, and if they place their
Happiness in pursuing their Duty, as every true
Christian must, there must be some of that Hap∣piness
<PB N="287" REF="293"/>
wanting, where they cannot worship God
together, and go hand in hand to Heaven.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Yo. Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Sister, I was always of that
Mind, but I am exceedingly confirmed in it by
your Experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wid.</SPEAKER>
<P>You were happy in your early cleaving to
this Principle, and I miserable in neglecting it;
may both our Examples be directing to those that
come after us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Children, blessed be God for the
Experience of both: Let us end this Discourse,
for it makes me melancholy, that have had a very
unhappy Pare in both your Cases. In yours, my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speaking to the Youngest.</NOTE>, I violently endeavoured to force you to be
miserable; and in yours, my Dear<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Speaking to the other.</NOTE>, I intirely
omitted the Concern I ought to have had upon
me, to present your making your self so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not afflict your self, Sir, about that
now: blessed be God we have both got it over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fa.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it does afflict me for all that; and let
all Fathers learn from me, how much it concerns
them, if they wish well to their Children, either
to their Souls or Bodies, to establish religious
Families in their Posterity, and to prevent their
Children marrying, if possible, either where there
is no Religion, or no Agreement in Opinion about
it; for in either Case they are sure to be made
miserable.</P>

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the latter Part of the last, Dis∣course
we left the Aunt and the
Widow Sister, who had marry'd
the Roman Catholick Gentleman,
entring upon a Discourse about the
Inconveniencies of entertaining ir∣religious
Servants; and also of en∣tertaining
of Servants of differing Persuasions and
Opinions in Religion, one from another, or of dif∣ferent
Opinions from the Family they serv'd in.
The Ladies put off the Discourse of that Affair
for another Time, the Aunt being willing to en∣ter
into a more particular Conversation about it,
This caused several very entertaining Discourses
<PB N="290" REF="295"/>
mong them at several times, some of which, I
hope, may be useful to be made publick. for the
Direction of other Families, and for the Encou∣ragement
of all Masters or Mistresses of Families,
who desire to promote good Government and re∣iligious
Things among their Children and Servants,
and particularly in such a Time as this, when 'tis
known that Servants are less apt to submit to Fa∣mily
Regulations, and good Houshold Govern∣ment
than ever.</P>
<P>The two Ladies being at their Aunt's House,
which was at <HI>Hampstead,</HI> as I have observed, their
Aunt had a little Squabble with one of her Maids
upon the following Occasion: The Maid had, it
seems, been out in the Afternoon of a Sabbath-day,
and staid longer than the usual time of being
at Church h and her Lady, who otherwise had
known nothing of it, happen'd unluckily for the
Wench to be just in the way when she came in,
that is to say, the Lady chancing to go down the
Back-stairs, which was not ordinary for her to do,
meets her Maid drest in her best Cloaths, and
just going up to undress herself; and this Rein∣counter
between the Mistress and the Maid, pro∣duc'd
the following Dialogue.</P>

<P>It would have been a Trifle, <HI>Mary,</HI> if it had

<P>No, <HI>Mary,</HI> you are much mistaken there;
I think I am oblig'd to inquire whether my Ser∣vants

their Time a Sabbath-days: Besides, <HI>Mary,</HI> 'tis a

you are but just come Home; I desire to have

<P>I am not asham'd to tell where I have been,

I did not think you would have troubled your self

<P>Well, <HI>Mary,</HI> then I make it now; for they

<STAGE>Here her Mistress left her, seeing she began to talk
a little saucily, and she had no mind to vex her∣self,
or put herself in any Passion with her.</STAGE>
<P>The Wench a little heated with the Reproof
her Lady had given her, and vex'd that she was
caught, for she did net expect to see her Mistress
on the Back-stairs, went up and undress'd her, and
hearing another of the Maids in the next Room,
she goes to her, and there give a full Vent to her
Passion, railing heartily at her Mistress, and at
Religion, and at every thing that came in her
way. The following Discourse will give some
pare of their Talk: She knocks at the Door, and
calls to her Fellow-Servant thus; <HI>Betty,</HI> open the
Door, I want to speak with you; so <HI>Betty</HI> let her
in, and she begins;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Betty.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not I: Who have you had a Lecture
from?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no body but my Mistress: I wonder
what Business she had upon the Back-stairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Back-stairs! Why did you meet my Mistress
upon the Back-stairs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, I met her there; or rather, she
met me there, as ill Luck would have it; for I
was but just▪ come in, and was coming up to
undress me, but she caught me; I would I had
been a Mile off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what did she say to you? Was she
angry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, angry! I never had such a Rattle
from her fined came into the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was the Matter? What was it for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>For! for nothing, I think; but forsooth
she would needs know where I had been, and
whether Iliad been at Church, or no: What has
she to do with it, whether I go to Church or no?
'Tis nothing to her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>O that was only because you was but just
come in, and it was so long past Church-time, I
suppose, that made her suspect you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suspect me! What do you mean by that?
I do nothing to be suspected, not I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say you do; I say that made her
suspect you had not been at Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, she need not trouble her Head with
her Suspicions of me; I told her I had not been
at Church; I told her I had been to take a Walk
with a Friend as far as <HI>Highgate.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you? That's more than I dare do; if
I make a slip now and then, I am in such a Hurry to
<PB N="296" REF="301"/>
get back just as Church is done, that it takes
away all the Pleasure of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't trouble my Head with it; if I have
a mind to take a Walk, as long as she don't want
me, what need she trouble her self; I shan't be
so much afraid of her not I; as long as 'tis only a
Sunday and my Work is done too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then I can assure you my Mistress and
you will not agree long together; for if she knows
it, she won't keep you an Hour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, she may do as she will for that; I
told her plainly where I went, and that I thought
she had nothing to do with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you so, <HI>Mary?</HI> Then I suppose she told
you her mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, and I told her my mind too: I
won't be tied up to her religious Trumpery, not
I; if I do her Work what has she to do with
what Religion I am of, or whether I have any
Religion, or no? 'tis no Business of hers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Mary,</HI> I cannot go that Length nei∣ther:
I think my Mistress may concern herself
with that; for it she is religious herself, she may
desire to have her Servants be so too; and there∣fore
if I do make a Breach sometimes, I always
do it so, as not to be found out; and I have had
such good Luck, that my Mistress has never
caught me yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well she has caught me; and if it be a
fine Day next Sunday, she shall catch me a∣gain,
if she has a mind to it; I won't be ty'd
to go to Church but when I please; I love Liber∣ty:
Besides; this is about Religion, <HI>Betty,</HI> and so
'tis Liberty of Conscience; you know I love Li∣berty

<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are witty upon it, <HI>Mary:</HI> Pray what
do you call Liberty of Conscience?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! that I should have Liberty to go to
Church, or not to go to Church, as I think fit,
and when I please; is not that Liberty of Con∣science?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>Mary,</HI> I think that is Liberty without
Conscience; for 'tis a Liberty in what we should
not do; that can never be Liberty of Conscience,
<HI>Mary.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well; then let it be Liberty with∣out
Conscience; 'tis the Liberty I love; and I see
no Harm in it: Why you acknowledge you do
so your self don't you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, so I do sometimes; but I can∣not
say 'tis as it should be; I cannot say as you do,
that there is no Harm in it; 'tis a Fault, I know
that; and I don't do it very often; and when I
do, as I told you, I take care not to have it known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, then you are worse than I;
for you believe 'tis a Fault, and yet you do it:
Now I don't think 'tis a Fault at all, if I did,
it may be, I would not do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't believe you can say with a safe

only are harden'd a little more than I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; <HI>and you are even with me;</HI> for
you are a little more of a Hypocrite than I, and
for ought I see that's all the Difference between
us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>Mary,</HI> your Reproof is bitter; but
perhaps 'tis too true; and I shall learn so much
from you, that I shall take more care how I do a∣gain
what my own Conscience convinces me is a
Fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="298" REF="303"/>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and I may go on, because I have
more Impudence than you, I suppose, that's what
you mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say so; I believe you know 'tis a
Fault as well as I do, but you are a little more
us'd to those Things, it may be, than I have been.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am as I was bred, and so, it may be, are
you; I was never taught to lay much stress upon
these Things, and so I never trouble my self a∣bout
them.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Mary,</HI> I am glad you think I have
been taught better.</P>

<P>Why as well as you have been taught, I
find you can take a Walk in the Fields a Sunday as
well as I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I tell you again, I don't do it and
think there's no Harm in it, as you do; and I
think you have touch'd me so Home with your
Reproof, that I resolve never to do so again while
I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what's all this to my Mistress and me?
What has she to do with it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Mary,</HI> my Mistress is a very pious
religious Lady, and she thinks herself bound to call
her Servants to an Account how they spend their
Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, so she may for all the Week-days, for
that's her Time, but Sunday's my own, she has
nothing to do with that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I assure you my Mistress will not allow that
Doctrine; she thinks she has as much to do with
you a Sunday as any other Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk of my Mistress being a religious
Lady, why so she may be, for ought I know; and
I think we have so much Religion at Home, we
need not go abroad for it; Does not the Chap∣lain
teaze us twice a day with his long Prayers,
<PB N="299" REF="304"/>
and reading of Chapters; I am sure he has made
me neglect my Business many times to come in to
Prayers; but I give them the slip sometimes, and
if I did not, they would have many a good Dish
of Meat spoil'd, so they would.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a merry Girl, <HI>Mary,</HI> when you
talk of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I don't understand it; I know no∣thing
of the Matter; I come to do my Business,
and mind the Kitchen; if their Dinners are not
well dish'd up, they may find fault, and I should
take some Care to mend it; but talk to me about
Religion, 'tis time enough hereafter, let them let
me alone to my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my Mistress will satisfy you, that she
is obliged, while she keeps you for a Servant, to
see that you serve God as well as you serve her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>O dear! let them serve God themselves bet∣ter
first; I don't see that any of them have any
more regard to their Prayers and their Chapters
than I have that stay away, but only for Form
sake, and it may be for the Credit of employing a
Chaplain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, do not say so neither; I can assure
you my Mistress is a very pious religious Lady, and
you cannot say otherwise I am sure, and so are all
the young Ladies too, they are like her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so; and yet I have seen them all
asleep at Prayers many a time, when I am sure
they had not so much more need to be sleepy than
I had, that work hard, nor so much neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes they may be heavy, but that is
not often; and I suppose you cannot say they
were ever all asleep together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis no matter for that, they do the same
at Church; and pray what's the difference between
my going to the Fields to take my Pleasure a Sun∣days,
<PB N="300" REF="305"/>
and their going to Church <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take their
Ease? between my washing my Dishes, while the

at Prayers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Moll,</HI> thou art very malicious to take
notice of such Things, and they are Faults to be
sure, but there is a vast Difference in them too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus: That tho' they may sometimes
drop asleep, 'tis not always; and they do it but
seldom; you it seems make the t'other a Prac∣tice,
and do it always; then if they do sleep some∣times
at Church or at Prayers, they don't pretend
to say there is no Harm in it, they must ac∣knowledge,
they ought not to do so, but you
have the Impudence to say, when you spend your
Time in the Fields, or perhaps worse, there is no
Harm in it: Now there's a great deal of difference
between doing a Thing which they acknowledge
to be wrong, and doing what is really wrong,
and justifying it as if it was right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, let them do what they will, and
let me do what I will; I don't meddle with them,
let them let me alone, can't they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it may be my Mistress thinks she ought
to govern her Servants in religious Things, as
well as in her House-Affairs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why let her think what she will, and do
what she will, I will have my own Way, I shall
mind nothing they say to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's none of my Business, <HI>Mary;</HI> you
must do as you will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; and 'tis none of her Business neither,
I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say that, <HI>Mary;</HI> I think, if you
were a Mistress, and kept a great many Servants,
as our Mistress does, you would talk otherwise
<PB N="301" REF="306"/>
and do otherwise too, or else you would soon
have a House fall of Whores and Rogues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know what I should do then, nor
do I trouble my Head with it; for I am never
like to be tried with it; but if I was a House∣keeper,
and kept Maids, I would take care they
should do my Business, and that would keep them
from making such a disorderly House as you speak
of; as for their Religion, I should not trouble
my self about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I would trouble my self about
that too, I assure you, if I were a Mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why what would you do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why if I had a Chaplain or a Husband
that kept up good Orders in his House; I would
take care my Servants should always attend at
Prayers; and on Sundays I would take care they
should all go to Church, and come Home again
too when Church was done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would! and if I was your Maid, you
would make me come in to Prayers every Night
and Morning would you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I would, or you should not live with
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and if I did come in, I should on∣ly
laugh at you all when I did, and make a jest
of your Chaplain or your Husband, and so would
other Servants too; Don't you see we do so here?
An't we always a making Sport at our poor dull
Thing call'd a Champlain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I can't say but I see it, but I never
joyn with you in it; for I think there's no jest at
all in it; and as for the poor good Man himself,
I know he sees it, and 'tis a great Trouble and
Discouragement to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="302" REF="307"/>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what is such a Fellow good For, but
to be gam'd and made Sport with? Does he think
we take him for any thing but a religious Merry
Andrew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must think however my Mistress takes
him otherwise, and thinks it her Duty to keep him,
and to have good Orders in her House; and it
does not become us that are Servants to mock at
such Things; no Matter or Mistress that knew
their Servants mock'd at God's Worship in their
House, ought to keep those Servants an Hour
longer in their Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you would make me come to Church
if I was your Cook, would you <HI>Betty?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I don't say I would make you go to
Church, but you should either go to God's Wor∣ship,
or go about your Business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well but what if I were a Dissenter, and
did not like your Way, or did not care to go to
your Church? Or what if you were a Dissenter,
and I did not like to go to the Meeting-house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly <HI>Mary,</HI> in general, I say if that
were the real Case, I would not constrain you,
provided I was satisfy'd you went but somewhere;
but your Dispute with my Mistress is between go∣ing
somewhere and no where, not between serv∣ing
God in this Manner or that Manner, but be∣tween
serving God some Way or other, and serv∣ing
him no Way at all, and that alters the Case
mightily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as to the Matter of coming to Pray∣ers
at Home, it would be the same thing; for if
I were a Church-woman, and my Mistress a Dis∣senter;
or I a Dissenter, and my Mistress of the
Church; I a Quaker, and my Mistress a Roman
Catholick; or my Mistress a Quaker, arid I a Ca∣tholick,
it would be all the same thing; there
<PB N="303" REF="308"/>
would be the same Dislike and Contempt of what
was done in the House; I should no more like
the Crosses and the Masses of the Papists, the Yea
and Nay of the Quakers, and reading Prayers of
the Church, or Ex tempore Prayers of the Pres∣byterian,
if I was of the other Opinion, than I
now like any of them, while I declare I under∣stand
none of them; and so all their Family-do∣ings
would be but a jest to me, and I'll make a
jest of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this is too true; and therefore I must
own, that if I were a Mistress of a House, I would
always have my Servants go to the same Place, to
serve God, as I did my self, or I would not keep
them; whether I went to the Church, or to the
Meeting-House; to the Quakers Meeting, or to
the Mass-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you be the better? They
would but make a jest of you still; they would
be not the more of your Opinion for forcing them
to go where you went.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mistake me much; I mean they should
be such as by Choice went to worship so before
they came to me, and that declared their Opini∣on
to be so when I hir'd them; for otherwise, I
grant that compelling them afterwards would be
nothing at all, or perhaps worse than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if an honest plain Wench like
me came to be hir'd, that knows nothing at all of
Religion, and troubled not herself about it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why such a one, when I ask'd her whe∣ther
she went to this or that Place, would say yes
to any of them as I happen'd to be my self, and
so I might be deceived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well and what would you do then, when
you found her out, and met her on the Back∣stairs,
<HI>Bess,</HI> as my Mistress has done by me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="304" REF="309"/>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I should do just as my Mistress has
done with you, enquire about it, and when I found
you a reprobate prophane Wench, and a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy one
too, as it seems you acknowledge you have shown
your self to Day, I should e'en give you warning to
mend your Manners, or provide your self, as it
seems my Mistress has done too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty Story! so I am come to make my
Complaint to you to fine purpose; for it seems
you think me in the wrong all the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed so I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if I had came to you to be hir'd,
and you had ask'd me my Opinion about Religion,
and I had answer'd you, that I had not had ma∣ny
Thoughts about it, that all Opinions were a
like to me; that when I did go any where, I
would go where you would have me go, and the
like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, <HI>Mary,</HI> I must own I should not like
it at all; neither I believe, should I hire you at
all; I should be afraid to take such a stupid De∣spiser
of God and Religion into my House, you
should e'en go without a Mistress of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and you might go without a Ser∣vant
too of me; for I can tell you there are Mi∣stresses
enough in the World that never ask the
Question either before or after, nor care whether
their Servants serve God or the Devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, <HI>Mary,</HI> and that is one Reason, why
so many of us Servants are of the same kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ma.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I don't doubt however bat I
shall get a Place among them, and not be questi∣on'd
about going to Church: I go to Service to
work, not to learn my Catechism; I understand
my Cookery, what is it to them whether I under∣stand
Religion, or no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="305" REF="310"/>
<SPEAKER>Bet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look you, <HI>Betty,</HI> I don't learn my
Catechism any more than you, and yet I do not
like my Mistress the worse, I assure you, for taking
Care that her Servants should go to Church, and
not caring to keep those that are Despisers of Re∣ligion.
I think 'tis a Pity any Lady that is religious
should not have religious Servants about them.</P>
</SP>
<P>They had another Dialogue upon this Subject
afterwards: But it had too much Passion in it to
merit a Place in this Account; for the Case was
this; <HI>Betty</HI> gave her Lady an Account of some
Part of <HI>Marry</HI>'s Discourse, particularly that of ma∣king
a Jest of her Chaplain, and of her calling
the Family to Prayers; upon which her Mistress
turn'd her out of her House, giving her a Month's
Wages instead of a Month's Warning, as one not
fit to be allow'd to stay in her Family; and <HI>Mary</HI>
fell upon her Fellow Servant for that Part, in a
great Rage: <HI>Betty</HI> told her in so many Words,
she thought her self obliged to mention it, tho'
it was not till her Mistress having heard that they
had discours'd together, made her promise to give
her a full Account of all that had pass'd between
them, and if she had not done it faithfully, would
have put them both away together</P>
<P>These two short Dialogues or Disputes about the
Maid's rambling on the Sabbath-Day, was the
Reason why the young Lady's Aunt was willing
to discourse again with her Neice upon that Sub∣ject;
and accordingly meeting together some Time
after, they renewed their Discourse about Servants
in the following manners.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think <HI>Neice,</HI> when you and I talk'd last,
we were upon the Subject of taking religious Ser∣vants;
I want to hear what you have to say upon
<PB N="306" REF="311"/>
that Head; for I think there is really much more
in it than most People imagine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Madam; it is what I lay a great
Stress upon; and tho' I have not had much Occa∣sion
to complain in the few Years I have kept
House; yet I have seen so much of it in my Mo∣ther's
Time, and since that in other Families, and
a little in my own, that I am resolved whatever
Shift I make, I will have no Servants, but such as
at least, have a common Reverence for Religion
and for Religious Persons in a Family. To be sure
I will never have any Scoffers and Mockers of Re∣ligion
if I can help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the World goes now, Child, it will
be very hard to find such; for Religion is so much
made a Jest of among Masters, that it is hard to
find any Servants that do not jest at it too, and
mock and slight all those that have any Regard
to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my Case, Madam, exactly; but
there is another Mischief in it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another mischief, Child! there are in∣numerable
Family Mischiefs in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so, Madam. But this is one par∣ticular
Case, and which I have the greater Reason
to take Notice of, because a certain Lady, an Ac∣quaintance
and Neighbour of mine has had a great
deal of that Kind. And indeed in a particular
manner with her Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Lady is that? Pray do I know her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had some Discourse with her, Ma∣dam,
if I remember right, the last Time you did
me the Favour to dine with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it very well; and we talk'd a
little upon that very Subject; I mean, how rude
and insolent Servants were grown at this Time;
<PB N="307" REF="312"/>
but I think we had not much Talk of their being
irreligious and profane.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Madam, she had a Servant, whom they
call'd <HI>her Woman;</HI> for she was one to whom she
entrusted every Thing, and who was like a House∣keeper;
and all the Servants were, as it were,
under her: She was a very good Sort of a Body
indeed, in the House; and as that Lady, if you re∣member,
was very lame, so she could not stir about
to look much after her Servants her self, and trust∣ed
all to this Woman.</P>
</SP>
<P>She was a sensible Woman, had the knowledge of
almost every Thing in the World: and talk'd ad∣mirably
well; had a World of Wit and Humour,
very mannerly and well behav'd, sober and mo∣dest
enough; In short she was an excellent Servant.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You give her an extraordinary Character,
Neice, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a Word, Madam, she had every Thing
about her, that could be desir'd in a Servant hut
Religion; and of that she was as entirely empty
as you can imagine possible for any Creature in
the World co be, that had ever heard of God or
Devil, or had liv'd among Christians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay Neice, you say she was not an igno∣rant
Body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, Madam, she was so far from
being ignorant, that she was able co deceive any
Body: She would talk of religious Things as well,
and argue upon them strongly, enough to delude
any Body; and this made it the worse, for she
was such a human Devil, that she made use of a
fluent Tongue and of an uncommon▪ Wit▪ not to
talk religiously, but to mock and make a Jest of
Religion, and of all those that had any Regard
for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="308" REF="313"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was a dangerous Body indeed! Pray
Was she a Maid or a Wife? for she is not very
young, it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She had never been marry'd, Madam, but
I think, was engaged to a Man whom my Spouse
sent to <HI>Italy:</HI> And they are to be marry'd when he
comes back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say she is a sober Woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Madam, I dare say she is. But her
wicked, prophane, and atheistical Behaviour is e∣nough
to poison a whole Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why does the Lady your Friend enter∣tain
such a one in her House?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has such a Subtilty in her Conduct,
and behaves so cunningly, that her Mistress does
not perceive it; at least she does not think her so
bad as she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what says her Husband to it? Does
he know it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Madam, he knows more of it than
she does; for the Men Servants tell him of it,
and give him a particular Account sometimes of
Passages which they observe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he don't trouble himself about it:
For the Men do not often value these Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Madam, just the contrary; for
he is a very sober religious Gentleman, and keeps
very good Orders in his House, and 'tis a very
great Disturbance to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And has he spoken of it to his Wife?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes Madam, he has very often, and told
her such Particulars as are very essential to the
Good of the Family; and such too as almost car∣ry
their own Evidence with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does she say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="309" REF="314"/>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not indeed how she manages;
but I know that her Husband and she have had
more Words about it, than about all other matters
put together, since they were marry'd; and some∣times
it grows high, and they are very warm and
even angry about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she seems to be a good sensible re∣ligious
Lady: How can she take such a Creature's
Part, especially against her Husband?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, First of all she pretends that she
does not believe it; that the other Servants rival
her the Favours she receives, and her Mistress's parti∣cular
Kindnesses, and do it out of a malicious Design;
then she says she has examin'd her, and she finds
she clears her self of much of the Charge, and
makes the rest appear to be trifling, and not worth
Notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But perhaps <HI>Neice,</HI> it really may be so too,
and the other Servants may make Things worse
than they are, for the Reasons you mention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice</SPEAKER>
<P>But Madam, it is otherwise in Fact; for
the Truth is, this Wench or Woman, manages all
the Servants so effectually, that in short, if any
of them are religiously enclin'd when they come,
she makes them asham'd to be so, when they
come to Her, for she makes such a Mock of Re∣ligion,
and such a Jest of going to Church, or
going to Prayers in the Family, that she laughs
them out of their Religion, and in a Word, they
all turn Reprobates like her self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can this be, and her Lady not know
it, or hear of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very well Madam, for as I told you, she
is an excellent Servant, and the more her Mistress is
loth to part with her, the harder she is to be∣lieve
these Things of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="310" REF="315"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Neice, her Husband you say, knows
it; sure she will believe him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But she alledges he knows it but by Hear∣say
from the rest of the Servants, who she says
hate her, and therefore falsly accuse her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But does he know nothing from his own
Knowledge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam, he knows too much; for
the unwary Creature let him over-hear her one
Evening, making her Jeers, and flout at him to
some of the Servants, but behind his Back, for his
calling them all to Prayers; and not only so, but at
some Expressions which he had used some Time or
other, which she pretended were Nonsence, and
others trifling, and the like, as the Redundancy
of her Wit gave her Room to banter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was very unhappy indeed, and the
worse that he should know it too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it was, Madam; for it made the
poor Gentleman decline performing his Duty for
some Time, and made a very great Breach be∣tween
him and his Lady, which is hardly quite
made up yet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, she wanted to have him
continue to go on with his Duty, and to pray
in his Family as he us'd to do: He declar'd he
could not do it while that Creature was to be
there; that it was a Restraint to him, and he
could not perform when he knew there was one
in the Place who made a Scoff and Jeer at him
for it. She alledg'd he ought to perform his Du∣ty
for all that; and that it was a Piece of the
Devil's Craft, contrived to interrupt the Worship of
God in his Family, and that he ought to disre∣gard
it entirely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="311" REF="316"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I think, he was very much in the
wrong in that Part, for he certainly ought not
to have omitted his Duty upon so mean an Obje∣ction
as that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, and he owned it; but said
it was a Difficulty upon him, a Restraint to him
in the Performance of his Duty, and that she
ought to remove it for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>He ought to have consider'd that the less
of Religion was to be found in his Servants, the
more Reason he had to pray For them, and with
them, that he might perhaps be the Occasion of
Good to them, and of bringing them to the Know∣ledge
and Love of Religion, which would be an
Advantage he ought to be thankful for, and think.
it a Blessing to his House if it happened so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She did argue just so to him, Madam: But
he return'd it so strong upon her, that she ought
as far as lay in her, to remove every Difficulty that
lay in the Way of his Duty; that it was much
more forcible as to her; for he told her, that if
she granted, that the Difficulty was a Snare laid in
his Way by the Devil, she ought at the same time
that she told him it was his Duty to resist it, do all
she could possible, or that lay in her Power, to
remove the Occasion; otherwise she made her
self accessary to the Temptation, and assistant to
the Devil, in laying a Snare for her Husband, and
much of the Sin wou'd lie at her Door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a great deal in that; I confess,
and I think she ought to have yielded immediate∣ly.
Pray, what did she say to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She insisted, that the Charge was false;
that her <HI>Woman</HI> deny'd it, and as I said before, that
it was a malicious Design of the other Servants; but
in short, the Business was, that she was very loth to
<PB N="312" REF="317"/>
part with tier <HI>Woman,</HI> who, as I said before, was a
very good Servant, and useful to her divers Ways.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you said, that he heard something of
it himself. Surely she would believe him then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she could say nothing to that in∣deed,
but she put it off as well as she could, with
telling him, she wou'd tell her Woman of it, and
take Care she should do so no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That seemed to be Trifling, because it
was in a matter of such Consequence as ought
not to be trifled with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was so: But he went yet further; he
entreated her, he begg'd of her to take away a
Thing so irksom, from him, and which was so
much a Hindrance to his Duty: He told her, that
had a Servant been a meer ignorant untaught Crea∣ture,
he should have had no Difficulty upon him,
but rather it would be an Encouragement to do
his Duty, in Hopes of being an Instrument of
opening their Eyes: But for a Mocker at Religi∣on,
and one that not only despis'd Religion it
self, but mock'd at others for it; This made the
Case differ exceedingly, and he knew not how
to get over it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would not such Arguments as those
move her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, not so much as they should have
done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, what was the Consequence of
it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Madam, the Consequences were
bad many Ways. For <HI>First,</HI> it kept the Lady and
her Husband in very ill Terms with one another
for near two Years; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> That unhappy
Creature banter'd all the other Servants of the Fa∣mily
out of the little Religion they had, and in∣deed
made them all like her self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where did it end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="313" REF="318"/>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, besides this, it broke and put
an End to all good Order and to the Worship of
God in the Family; I mean to all Family-Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What dreadful Work was that? What! and
does it continue so still?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Madam. Her Husband, who is a
very religious Gentleman, could not content him∣self
with living in that Manner with his Family,
and not being able to prevail with his Wife to part
with her <HI>Woman,</HI> he took so much upon him, as to
force her out of the House, <HI>that is to say,</HI> he put
away the whole Set of Servants in the Family;
for they were all made alike at last, and took all
new People at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did the Lady take it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Madam, I cannot say she took it
so well as I wish for her Sake, she had: For tho'
her Husband and she are very religious sober and
good People, yet I cannot but say, it has broken
very much in, upon their Tempers and Affection
one to another, and there is not all the Harmony
between them, that there us'd to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And all long of one graceless irreligious
Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis very true Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, as you say, ruining the Morals
of the rest of the Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray how did that appear among them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, in the first Place she made
all religious Things her Jest; turn'd all that was
said to them at Church, or in the Family, that
had any thing serious in it, into Banter and Ridi∣cule,
and laugh'd them out of every thing that
look'd like Religion. She represented Religion to
be a meer Piece of State-Policy and Priestcraft,
contrived between the Clergy and the Statesmen,
<PB N="314" REF="319"/>
only to subject the World to their Management:
The Ministers and Servants of Jesus Christ set a∣part
for the Altar, and whose Business it is to
preach Salvation to a loft World, by a glorious
but crucify'd Redeemer, she despis'd with the low∣est
or last Degree of Contempt; calling them Mer∣canaries
and Tradesmen, the Church their Idol,
and the Pulpit their Shop, where they sold what
they call'd the Word of God to <HI>who bid most,</HI> and
such like horrid and blasphemous Stuff. When the
honest Servants would have gone to Church with
their Master and Mistress, she would carry them
away into the Fields, or to make some Visit or
other, and continually turn them off from what
was religious to something of Levity and Diver∣sion,
as a more suitable Work for the Sabbath-Day;
and still when she had brought them to
break in upon Conscience, and to prophane the
Sabbath-Day, she would fall foul of Religion for
laying the Burthen of Rules upon the Liberties of
the World; and all she did or said, was with a deal
of Wit, and by way of Sarcasm, as sharp and as
clean as if she had been a Philosopher, or a Do∣ctor
in Theology.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was the more dangerous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was so indeed; for she had the
Tongue of a <HI>Syren;</HI> 'twas neatly hung, but hel∣lishly
employ'd; for she delighted in making every
Body as bad as her self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Story is very good; let me tell you
another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be glad to hear it, Madam. But

<HEAD>DIALOGUE. II.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Evening the Lady and her Neice
taking a Walk in the Garden, had a
farther Conversation upon the same
Subject, and the Neice said to her
Aunt, <HI>which began the Dialogue;</HI> Madam, When we
left off our Discourse in the Morning, you were
pleased to say at the End of my Story of an irre∣ligious
profane Wench that my Neighbour Mrs.—had
been troubled with, that you would tell
me a Story of another.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did so Child: It is of a Family that
lives at<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">She points to a House that could be seen over the Garden-Wall.</NOTE> that House just over-the way in the
Back-Lane. The People are Dissenters; the Gen∣tlewoman
is a very sober religious good Sort of a
Person indeed; and her Husband is a very grave
religious Man also. They endeavour to take Ser∣vants
of their own Perswasion as much as they
can; but that is sometimes very difficult to do;
and she has indeed had very bad Luck that way.
However, this Gentlewoman, as she told me her
self, having Occasion to hire a Maid-Servant; I
forget whether she was Cook or Chambermaid, or
what else, for they kept three or four: But after
<PB N="317" REF="322"/>
she had agreed in every Thing else, me ask'd her
Maid that (was to be) what Religion she was of?</P>
</SP>
<P>Madam, says the Maid blushing, (for she look'd
mighty sober) that is a Question I don't under∣stand
very well.</P>
<P>Why says the Mistress, I hope you are a Prote∣stant;
I don't mean whether you are a Papist or
no.</P>
<P>Yes, Madam, says the Maid, I think I am a
Protestant.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says the Mistress,</HI> do you but think so
then? I doubt you don't chink much about it.</P>
<P>Not so much as I should do, Madam, <HI>says the
Maid,</HI> and look'd very simply and innocently at
the Discourse.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not expecting, <HI>it may be,</HI> to be ask'd
such Questions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I believe not; for they are Questi∣ons
that I think, none of us ask so much as we
should do, when we hire Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Servants value themselves so much now,
that they would take it as out of the way to be
ask'd about these Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if I have any Servants, they shall
all be ask'd such Questions, and answer them too,
or they shall be no Servants to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of the same mind, Madam, if I can
possibly find Servants that will submit to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Child, if they won't submit before they
are hired, to tell me what Religion they are of;
what are they like to submit to, after they are
hir'd about Religions or any thing else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why really Madam, I have had two or
three that made a great deal of Difficulty to do
it, and thought it very much out of the Way to
have me ask 'em about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="318" REF="323"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you take them after that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, yes I did take two of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were they good for any Thing when
you had them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed they were good for very little I
must confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be possible indeed, that a Wench
may be a good Servant, that is not a good Chri∣stian;
but I must acknowledge it is but very sel∣dom
that it proves so; but when a good Servant is
a good Christian too, such a one is ten times the
more valuable for a Servant, as well as for her
Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Madam: But what shall we say,
that some that are good Christians, are nevertheless
not good Servants; nay, there is a kind of a Scandal
upon those we call religious Servants; that they
are generally saucy, reserv'd, and value themselves
too upon it, always making Conditions with you,
and claiming Times and Liberties on Account of
religious Affairs, which are neither proper for the
Work of Religion, and perhaps not employ'd so
when granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That brings me back to the Story I was
telling you, at least to one Part of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry I interrupted it then. Pray
Madam, go on with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you that Gentlewoman my Neigh∣bour
ask'd the Wench about her Religion, and
how modestly she answer'd. However her Mi∣stress
put an End to that kind of Discourse, and
said, <HI>Look ye, Sweet Heart,</HI> I shall not chatechise
you too far; the Question is, whether you have
been bred to the Church, or the Meeting-house,
for I'll tell you before-hand, we are all Dissenters,
and go to the Meeting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="319" REF="324"/>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was too open, she might have first
heard what the Maid said of her self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; she was willing to let her
know first, and see what Answer she would give
to it, not doubting but that if she gave an Answer
not founded upon Principle, she should find it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, perhaps she would be any
thing to get a good Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to that, she made her self Judge of it
from her Answer, which was very honest indeed,
tho' not to her Mistress's Satisfaction at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, if it was honest, why
should it not satisfy her Mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas an Answer which discover'd the
unhappy Consequences of divided Families, and
shows much of the Necessity of what we have
had so many Dialogues about, in the Case of your
self and your Sisters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, about Husbands and Wives being
of the same Opinion, Madam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. She told her Mistress, that her Father
went to the Meetings, and her Mother went to
the Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that to the Question of what
Religion or Opinion she was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my Dear, she ask'd her what she
was bred to, and it was a proper Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; and so between both, I
suppose she was bred to be indifferent to either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my Dear; 'twas worse than that; and
her Mistress took it immediately; for she turn'd
pretty quick upon the Wench? and so Sweet∣heart,
<HI>says she,</HI> I suppose you were bred between
them, to go neither to one, nor t'other.</P>
</SP>
<P>Yes Madam, <HI>say the Maid,</HI> sometimes I went
to one, and sometimes to t'other.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="325"/>
And sometimes no Whither, <HI>says the Mistress.</HI></P>
<P>My Father and Mother were poor People,
Madam, <HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>Poor People, <HI>says the Mistress,</HI> what then Child?
They might have carry'd you to serve God with
them, one where or other; their Poverty did not
hinder that.</P>
<P>That's true, Madam, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays the <HI>Maid,</HI> but they
could not agree about it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>So in short, the poor Girl was left, be∣tween
them without any Government or Instru∣ction;
I suppose that must be the Case: A sad
Example of a Family, where the Husband goes
one way, and the Wife another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay so it was: However she answer'd up∣on
the whole, that she was very willing to go to
the Meeting, since her Mistress desir'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was to say, she was perfectly in∣different
in the matter, and it would have been
the same Thing to her if her Mistress had been a
Church-woman, or a Roman-Catholick, or a Jew,
or any Thing, or nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her Mistress did not take it so; but
seem'd satisfied, that she agreed to go to the Meet∣ing,
and so took her into the House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray Madam, what came of it? how
did she prove?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, just as a poor uneducated ignorant
Creature would prove. She went with them to
the Meeting, but pretended to the Servants she
did not like it, and she had rather go to Church:
So her Mistress taking an Opportunity of talking
with her again one Day, told her what she had
heard in the House of her, and ask'd her if she had
said, that she did not like going to the Meetings,
but had rather go to Church, and she said, that
indeed she did say so, but she meant nothing of
Harm.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="321" REF="326"/>
Well, <HI>says her Mistress,</HI> I never desire to offer
Violence to any Servant's Conscience; if you had
rather go to Church, you shall go to Church, tho'
you know what you said to me, when I hir'd you,
that you were very willing to go to the Meeting.</P>
<P>That was very, true, she said, and she had not
said otherwise now; but she said only, that she
had rather go to Church: However, if she pleas'd
she would stay at home.</P>
<P>No, no, says the Mistress, I'll have no staying
at home; I will have all my Servants go to the
publick Worship of God <HI>somewhere;</HI> staying at
home may be as much a mis-spending the Sab∣bath-Day,
as going abroad for Pleasure: There∣fore
go to Church, <HI>Betty,</HI> says her Mistress, by
all means; I am not so much against going to
Church, as to think that they do not serve and
worship God there: By all means, if you dop not
care to go to the Meeting, go to Church; 'tis
certainly your Duty to go somewhere, and mine
to oblige you to it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was spoken like a Woman of very
good Principles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is a very good Sort of a Person I as∣sure
you; and generally governs her self upon
good Principles, Principles of Justice and of Cha∣rity,
which is a great Part of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, pray what follow'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why she went to Church, as she said;
but in a little while her Mistress began to suspect
her, and once or twice she betrayed her self, and
discover'd among, the Servants that she had been
rambling about, but had not been at Church at
all: Upon this Suspicion her Mistress told her one
Day very calmly, that she had some Reason to
suspect, that her saying she had rather go to Church
<PB N="322" REF="327"/>
than to the Meeting, was not a sincere Dislike of
one, or approving of one, more than of the other
but really a Project of her own to have the Li∣berty
of spending the Sabbath-Day no where; that
is to say, in running about as she had been suffered
to do, when she was at home with her Father
and Mother.</P>
</SP>
<P>She reply'd with some Confidence, that indeed
it was not so; and began to be more positive
about her having been at Church, than her Mi∣stress
desir'd she should be, because she knew she
told her what was false: However she run on,
told hee Mistress a Lye or two, which she knew
to be so; and insisted that she desired to go to
Church, because she lik'd to serve God, in that
Way, better than the other; so her Mistress let
it pass for that Time, and she went to Church as
usual, that is to say, went where she pleas'd for
some Time.</P>
<P>At last she was trapp'd accidentally, and could
not get off any manner of way; for going ramb∣ling
for her Pleasure, with some of the Neigh∣bouring
Servants, Men and Maids together, (for
by this Time she had got a Gang like her self,)
and going to cross the Road about a Mile from
the Town, a young Citizen that was spending the
Sabbath-Day on Horse-back, as she was spending
it on Foot, I mean in Pleasure, coming just up
at that Minute, his Horse started at something, I
know not at what, and giving a Spring forward, run
against the poor Wench, beat her down, and rid
over her; then run away with the Man, and
threw him off a little farther, and hurt him too
very much.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what became of the poor Girl?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="323" REF="328"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, she was more frighted than any
thing else; but she had a Kick or Bruise by the
Horse on her Knee, or the Horse trod or her
Knee, she could not well tell which; but by
that means, she was lam'd, and could not get home
till about 8 a clock at Night, when her Mistress
coming to the Knowledge of it, sent the Coach for
her, and brought her home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there was a full Discovery in∣deed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay so there was; for the Neighbour's
Servants that were with her own'd where they
had been, and with who; and told honestly that
they had been at a Cake-house to be merry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was no Crime perhaps in the Families
where they liv'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, none at all; or at least, no Notice
was taken of it, especially since they were only
with Neighbours, and <HI>as they call'd it,</HI> was in no
bad Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did she do with her Maid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, her Maid was the same; she was sorry
for a while, and pretended she would never go
abroad for Pleasure again of a Sabbath-Day: But
that held but a little while; she was the same
again a little while after: So her Mistress resolv'd
to part with her, for she two or three times en∣ticed
the other Servants to go abroad with her,
and still when they had been miss'd, the Answer
was, they went to Church with <HI>Betty;</HI> and then
if <HI>Betty</HI> was ask'd, she would lie very readily too,
and say yes. At last this camie out coo, and <HI>Betty</HI>
was call'd to an Account for it, and when she
could deny it no longer, then she would own it,
but promise to alter it, and do so no more: At
length her Mistress, who was in a little Strait still,
and loth to put any Force upon the Wench a∣bout
<PB N="324" REF="329"/>
going to the Meeting, told her she could
not bear these Things, and gave her Warning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was Time to part with her when she
found she spoil'd the rest of the Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but the Wench, very loth to leave
good Place, came to her Mistress, and begg'd her to
let her stay, and she would go the Meeting, and
then she Should be sure she did not ramble any
more on the Sabbath-Day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>So that 'twas plain she would serve God
any way for a good Place, and that was what I
said of her, as soon as I heard her first Answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But her Mistress acted upon another Prin∣ciple
still, and she refus'd her: No, says she, <HI>Mary,</HI>
you declar'd in the House that you used to go to
Church; that you did not like the Meetings, and
that you had rather go to Church: Now, I will
not have any body forc'd from going to Church
to please me; if you had been one that was bred
to go the Meeting, I had been better pleas'd, be∣cause
I have been so brought up my self; but if
you choose to go to Church because you like to
serve God after that manner better than in the
Way I go, God forbid I should put any Force
upon you; I doubt not, but you may serve and
worship God very acceptably either way; but if
you go to the Meeting which you do not like,
only to keep your Place which you do like, 'tis
plain to me you will worship God no where, for
you cannot be said to worship God in a Way you
do not like.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was too nice, I think, and talk'd to
an ignorant Wench in Language that she did not
understand; she might e'en ha' let her gone any
where; for 'twas plain she would serve God no
where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="325" REF="330"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, she acted her own Principles how∣ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what did she do with the Maid then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why she made her a new Proposal Look∣ye
<HI>Betty,</HI> says her Mistress, if you will go to
Church honestly, and satisfy me that you do so,
and that you do not, under a Pretence of going
to Church, go abroad and spend your Time idly,
I shall be easy; for this was all the Reason why at
first I ask'd you where you went, and told you I, ex∣pected
you should go with me; not that I am a∣gainst
any Body's going to the Church, but because
I desire they should serve God, and not ramble
abroad. <HI>Betty</HI> promised heartily; Ay, but says
her Mistress, how shall I be satisfy'd of the Per∣formance?
<HI>Betty</HI> stood hard to have her Word be
taken for it; but that would not do, because she
had broke her Promise before, and had told some
Lyes too about the other Servants going to Church
with her as above. Well <HI>Betty, says her Mistres,</HI> I'll
put you in a Way to satisfy me effectually: You
know the Clark of the Parish lives but just by and in
your Way to the Church; his Wife is a very sober
good Woman, and I know never fails going to
Church, if she be well: Now, if you will go eve∣ry
Sunday with her, I'll answer for it, that if you
are not there, she will be true to me, and so kind
to you, as to tell me of it, and this shall sa∣tisfy
me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Clark's Wife was so faithful to be
trusted it was right, but that was a doubtful thing;
for she would be loth, I reckon, to ruin the poor
Wench for failing now and then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, the Short of the Story was this;
<HI>Betty</HI> was <HI>Betty</HI> still; an ill Habit and Want of
Principle led her away; she seldom came to Church,
and the Clark's Wife would not lie for her, and
<PB N="326" REF="331"/>
so at last her Mistress turn'd her away; and thus I
think all Servants Men and Maids should be serv'd,
would the Matters and Mistresses do their Duty;
and if this was universally practis'd, Servants would
serve God and their Mistresses too, better than
they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>They would so indeed, and for Want
of it, they serve neither God nor their Mistresses.
'Tis a want of a religious Regard to the Well-ordering
of Servants that makes them as they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, But I have another Story to tell
you of the same Gentlewoman; for after, this she
took a Servant that she thought must necessary be
religious; for she was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bred to the Meetings from
her Infancy: But it seems she was not of the same
Sort as her Mistress; But she told her where she
used to go, and capitulated for Liberty to go to the
same Meeting still. This her Mistress readily con∣sented
to, not doubting but that one that was under
such Obligations, would certainly be careful to do
her Duty; and when she mentioned to the Maid
that she was very ready to yield to her going where
she said she went, that she only desir'd to be satis∣fy'd
that her Servants did really go where they said
they went the Maid seem'd a little surpriz'd, that she
should be thought capable of so wicked a Thing
as that, and so stopp'd her Mistress's Mouth with
her Character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, then I hope she had one
to her mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the same Time her Husband had a
Man-Servant, who was a very religious devout
Fallow, and he was a Churchman: He truly con∣ditioned
that he would be at Liberty to go to
Church, which upon their being satisfy'd that he
was really a well-meaning sober and serious Fel∣low,
they easily consented to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="327" REF="332"/>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought you said they insisted on their
Servants going to worship God where they did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you they desir'd it, but that it was
chiefly that they might be sure to have orderly
Servants; and that they did observe the Lord's
Day, and worshipped God in some Place, or other,
not mispending the Sabbath; otherwise they were
Persons of a large Charity, and of a true Chri∣stian
Temper to those from whom they differ'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but to return to their Servants,
how did they prove?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only the worst that ever was heard of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! both of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, both of them. The Wench was
saucy, rigid, censorious; took upon her to find
Fault, that her Master and Mistress, who were
chearful and good temper'd People, were not se∣rious
enough; she would not come in to their
Family Worship, because she said, 'twas sorrily per∣form'd
and she did not like it: When her Mistress en∣tertain'd
any Friends, she did not like it, 'twas wick∣ed,
and it was loose and extravagant, and had too
much Luxury in it, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She should have been Mistress, and not
Maid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her Mistress told her so indeed one Day,
when over-hearing some of her Talk by Accident.
She call'd her to her, and speaking something
angrily to her, <HI>Jane, says she,</HI> answer me one Que∣stion,
What did I hire you for? <HI>Jane</HI> was a little
surprized at first, not understanding the Question,
and said nothing; till her Mistress repeated the
Question by way of Explanation thus, <HI>Jane Pray
did I not hire you to do my Work, and to be my Servant?</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Yes Madam, says <HI>Jane.</HI></P>
<P>Well then, <HI>says her Mistress,</HI> Pray do your Bu∣siness,
and behave like a Servant, as becomes you,
<PB N="328" REF="333"/>
or remove and provide your self, and when I wan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
a Schoolmistress to teach me how to behave in
my Family, I'll send for you.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was right; that was acting like a
Mistress; pray, what said <HI>Jane</HI> to it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was confounded, and struk dumb at
first, but her Mistress explain'd it to her after∣wards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>But pray, what was she for a Servant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! a most extraordinary accomplish'd
Slattern, and a surly, heavy, unmannerly Crea∣ture,
that, look'd always as it she thought her self
fitter to be a Mistress, than her that was so; did
every Thing with Reluctance, awkwardly and dis∣respectful,
and yet wilful, and above being taught,
dull to the last Degree, but scorn'd Reproof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly she had more of the Pretence
to Religion than of the Reality; for Christianity
teaches us to fill up every Relative Duty with
equal Exactness, and with a suitable Diligence and
Application.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why to bring my Story to a Point,
she had the Outside of Religion only: Whether
she took it up with a Design to deceive, or whe∣ther
she deceived her self, and fell from what she
at first profess'd, I know not; but she fell quite
off from Religion it self at last, and adding to
that some Follies, which I choose to say nothing
of, my good Neighbour turn'd her off, and got
rid of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>There she was cheated in her own way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was so, and I told her of it; but she
answer'd me with a Saying which I have often
made use of before, and that with, relation to my
self; <HI>I am never,</HI> said me, <HI>in so much Danger to be cheat∣ed,
as when People pretend to be religious; for then I
<PB N="329" REF="334"/>
think they dare not do such Things as I am afraid of.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Second Sister came into the Room,
and finding what Discourse they were engag'd in,
after her Respects paid to her Aunt, and to her
Sister, she desir'd they would go on with their Dis∣course,
for that she knew the Subject, and it was
what she came on purpose to have her Share in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was telling your Sister, how a Lady of
my Acquaintance was cheated with two religious
Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Second Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard the last Part, and she was
a nice one indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I have not told you one half of her
Behaviour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but Madam, how did it fare
with the Man-Servant? how did he behave?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why every Jot as ill another way: When
he should be at hand to be call'd, and when his
Master wanted him on any Occasion, he was gone
to Church to Prayers; and when Prayers were
done, he would often fall in as he came home at
a certain Alehouse that unhappily stood in the Way
home, and I think once or twice came home
drunk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine Things indeed for a conscienci∣ous
Wretch! These were religious Servants it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hold Neice!</HI> Religion, No, nor any Pro∣fession
or Opinion in Religion is not alter'd
one way or other, by the Mistakes and Miscar∣riages
of those that make a Profession of it. The
Eleven blessed Apostles were not at all the worse,
or is the memory of them co be the less reverenc'd
for the twelfth being a Devil; nor must we ex∣pect
that all our Servants should be Saints, when
they are what we call religious: All People have
<PB N="330" REF="335"/>
Failings, Religion does not always change
Tempers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we should expect they should
be Christians and Servants too. Religion ne∣ver
takes away good Manners or privileges Ser∣vants
from observing the due space which Nature
has put between the Person to be serv'd, and the
Person serving.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great Thing I insist upon ta∣king
religious Servants for, is that they may be
Examples in a Family, of Sobriety, quiet Submis∣sion,
Diligence and Seriousness to their Fellow-Servants;
that they, may be Encouragers, not Hin∣derers
of God's Worship in the House; that the
whole Family may chearfully unite in serving
God, and in all religious Orders; and if any ig∣norant
untaught Creature is taken into the House,
they may be instructed and led by the Hand into
the proper Duties of a Christian; that all the
House may be a Class of Christians, doing their
Duty in their respective Places, both from a Prin∣ciple
of Justice and of Charity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But 'tis very rare, Neice, to find what you
speak of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so Madam: But then, since it
is not probable we should always find such, all that
I insist on in the mean Time, is, that we should
take Care, as near as possible, to take those that
are well enclin'd, and well educated, not Ene∣mies
to all Religion, not such as make a Mock
of worshipping their Maker, or observing his Rules;
such I would dot entertain at all, on any Account
whatsoever; they would be a continual Offence in
a sober Family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there are some that may be in
the middle way, no Enemies to Religion, not
mockers at all sober Things, and yet not much
<PB N="331" REF="336"/>
stor'd with serious Thoughts, not void of Princi∣ple,
or void of Modesty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is true, there are some such, and
I know not what to say to such, I would rather
have them than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like those but little better, I
would have neither of them if I could help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, that they always discover a
Coldness and Backwardness to every good Thing,
and secretly despise the most serious Things as well
as the other; but good manners restrains them a
little from insulting the Family. I do not like
such, I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they may be better born with
Madam, than the first sort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but your Sister here is so far from
approving that sort; that even if they were se∣riously
religious, she would not entertain them
if they were of a different Opinion; she is of the
same Notion with my Cook Maid, that I told
you the Story of, that all differing Opinions in
Religion, will in such Creatures as them, despise
and contemn those that differ, from them, and ei∣her
hate or make a Jest of one nother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Sister, it may be, is grown rigid
that way, from the Disaster of her Family with
respect to her Husband and her self: But in car∣rying
it so far then, she will make it almost impossi∣ble
to have any Servants at all, but such as we
bring upon our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no matter for that? I am posi∣tive
in it with, respect to a Family's Peace, and
the Harmony of religious Worship in a Family;
it is all destroy'd and lost by these little Difficul∣ties,
and as long as there are Servants to be had,
and I could pay Wages, I would change 500 Ser∣vants,
till I found one so my Purpose; nor should
<PB N="332" REF="337"/>
any Fitness for my Business, or any Goodness of
Humour in a Servant, prevail with me to keep
her, if she wanted the main Article of Religion, and
the same Opinion of Religion too with my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid Child, you would change
500 indeed then, before you would be fitted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, I hope I am not of
such strange Principles and Opinions, that no bo∣dy
can be found of those Opinions but me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Dear; but Servants have rarely
any Notions of those Things, or enter far into them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Madam, I would venture it,
for I would no more entertain those who differ'd
from my Opinion in Religion, than I would en∣tertian
those that had none at all; for the Diffe∣rence
in Opinion in Servants, has more mis∣chiefs
in it sometimes, than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant it would be very well to have Ser∣vants
of the same Opinion in Religion with our
selves, but it cannot be always so; the first and
main Point that I have made my Rule, has been to
have Servants that are religiously enclin'd in ge∣neral
and that are willing tat be instructed;
these having a modest sober Behaviour in the
main are more easily brought to comply with re∣ligious
Things in the Family, whether they are
the same way that they were first inclin'd to or
not; such as these are often brought by good
Examples in the House, to be of the same Opi∣nion
with our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such, are indeed a great Tye up∣on
Masters and Mistresses of Families to take
Care that we recommend the Profession we
make of Religion by a good Example; for Ser∣vants
are not likely to turn to our Opinion, or
embrace with us the Pare which we take in Religion
when they see us not prcatise the Things we pre∣tend
<PB N="333" REF="338"/>
to teach, and not winning them to our O∣pinion
by a Conversation becoming Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, <HI>Neice,</HI> and would Ma∣sters
and Mistresses keep upon their Minds a sense
of what Influence their Conduct may have up∣on
their Servants; how they may be the means
of bringing them to a serious embracing of Reli∣gion,
or to a greater Levity and Indifference than
it may be they had before, as they see a good
or ill example in those they serve, we should have
much better Matters and Mistresses than we have,
and more religious Servants too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very true, find it were to be
wish'd it were well observ'd. But since it is not
always so, I cannot reconcile it to common Rea∣soning,
that we should take Servants of any Prin∣ciples
or Opinion in Religion, but such as we pro∣fess
our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it can be avoided.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly it may be avoided if we
Will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would except such as being ig∣norant
and untaught, profess themselves willing
to come into religious Families, that they may be
guided into good Things by Teaching and Exam∣ple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do except such; for such are
to be moulded this way or that, as Providence
casts them into religious or irreligious Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>We agree in that Part exactly; and in
deed were I to chuse, I would rather take a Ser∣vant,
who being ignorant in religious matters,
was yet sober and willing to be instructed; I say
much rather than take one fixt in his or her reli∣gious
Opinion, and that Opinion differing from
my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="334" REF="339"/>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed Madam, I am positive in that
Point; I cannot go from it: I would not take one
that differ'd from me in Opinion in Religion by
any means; no, upon no Account at all; it is
attended with nothing but Confusion in the Fa∣mily:
I would almost as soon take a loose profane
Wretch that own'd no Religion at all: I have seen
so much of it, and found such Inconveniences in ha∣ving
religious Quarrels and Differences in the Fa∣mily
by it, that I think 'tis unsufferable: I told
you the Story of our poor Negro that would
turn Christian: We had one Servant a Papist, and
he would have the Boy a <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick; ano∣ther
would have him be a Church of <HI>England</HI> Pro∣testant,
and another would have had him been a
Presbyterian; 'twas a Reproach even to the Name
of Christian, to hear how one told him he would
be damn'd if he was this, another told him he
would be damn'd if he was that, and the t'other
told him he would be damn'd if he was either of
them, and so of the rest; so that the poor Boy
was almost distracted among them, as I told you
at large before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without entring into Examples, I grant
'tis very pernicious, and a great Obstruction to
Family-Religion, and that many ways.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were there a Spirit of Peace and
Charity always to be found where there was an
outward Appearance of Religion, it would be quite
otherwise; but that is not our Case in this Age:
You see Madam, what was the Case in your Neigh∣bour's
Family, where the religious Servants, I
mean appearingly religious, were the worst Ser∣vants,
and the worst Christians they could have
met with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not bring those Examples to lessen
the Value of good, serious, religious Servants;
<PB N="335" REF="340"/>
but to hint to you the Danger there is (among
those that call themselves such) to find Hypocrites,
and also to note that Religion does not always
make a good Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It ought to do so, and would do so,
if the Rules of Christianity were faithfully ob∣served.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it is not always so, and therefore, as
I say, I would not take a Servant that was not
religious, or religiously enclin'd; so I do not say,
that I would not for the Sake of their being seri∣ous
and religiously enclin'd, take a bad Servant;
for Religion does not always qualify a Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Madam, Religion does not make
them good humour'd, cleanly, active, diligent and
mannerly, and the like; it will make them faith∣ful
and honest, that is inseparable,, but there is
many a good Christian that makes a bad Ser∣vant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I know some of them expect we should
bear with all the rest, for being what they call
religious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And perhaps are not so at Bottom
neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that sort of them are generally o∣therwise,
and put on an Appearance of Religion
only to disguise themselves the more dextrously,
and these are the religious Servants that I am
aptest to be deceiv'd by, but there are some of
the other too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis one of the worst Parts of a Hy∣pocrite,
I think, when they study to cover a vi∣tious
Life with the Mask of Religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I think too, that it is soonest disco∣ver'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may indeed, be sooner discover'd
than other Disguises, because the Levity is apt to
<PB N="336" REF="341"/>
break out at proper Intervals, in spite of the ut∣most
Caution: But the Mischief is often done
first, when the Discovery it too late to prevent
it; and therefore upon the whole, there is a great
Risque in taking Servants, that we are not very
well assur'd of, one way or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope you do not argue for
being indifferent in the Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; very far from it; but I
own, tis a Critical Case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it be as Critical as it will, 'tis
absolutely necessary to be be taken Care of, if we
will have religious Servants. 'Tis a sad Thing to
have the Master or Mistress praying in one Part
of the House, and the Men and Maids swearing
or railing, or laughing and jeering in another
Part of it. Next to having the Matter and Mi∣stress
religious, it is essential to a religious Family,
to have the Servants religious too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be possible to find such.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>They must be found religious, or
be made so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis but course Work to new-mould
a Servant: As you find them, you have them ge∣nerally.
Most of the Servants of this Age are
too far gone to be brought back, and not hum∣ble
enough to be meddled with, I mean as to In∣struction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say so; I am thankful that I
can say, that I have had a loose wicked it religious
Servant or two, who by taking some Pains with
them, have been brought to be very serious and
very religious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they have thank'd God for your
bettering them by your Instruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they have, I assure you <HI>Neice.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="337" REF="342"/>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But they were originally of a doci∣ble,
tractable Temper then, which is very rare
among Servants. But Madam, allow, you could
take that Task upon you, and your Application
had success, you would not expect that every
Mistress like you, should set up for an Instructor of
their Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; but it is not so hopeless a thing
however, as you may imagine; for if a Girl has
any Modesty, she cannot but listen a little to the
Instruction of those that wish her so well, and that
have so little Obligation upon them to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why Madam, an untaught Wench
that is modest and willing to be instructed, I take,
as I said before, to be among the Number that
are fit to be taken; The very Example of a religi∣ous
Family, will make her Religious also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Dear, you touch us all there, and
that upon a nice Point too; it must be confess'd
that it is because there are so few religious Fami∣lies,
that there are so few religious Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, Madam; but on the
other hand, loose prophane irreligious Servants are
a great Hindrance to the setting up a religious
Family. Those I am utterly against.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that is the Reason, Child, that I say
they should not be taken into our Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And should be turn'd out again as
soon as discover'd, and that without any Certi∣ficate
given them of their good Behaviour, or
without giving them what we call a good Cha∣racter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot deny them a Certificate,
Child, when they have not wrong'd or robb'd
us, the Law requires that of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="338" REF="343"/>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then Madam, the Certificate
should mention that I dismiss'd such a Man, or
such a Maid, for being a prophane irreligious Per∣son,
or for breaking the Sabbath-Day, or for not
going to Church when ordered to go there, or
for going abroad to be merry, when they should
have been at Church, and such like, as the case
may happen to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own there is a great deal of Reason to
do so; but we are apt to think it hard to do so,
and that it is taking a poor Servant's Livelyhood
from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we should consider too, how
much harder it is to push a profligate Wretch in∣to
a sober Family, under the Recommendation
or a false Character. We cannot say we do Justice
to our Neighbour, or do as we would be done
by: For still I go back to what we both said be∣fore,
that irreligious Servants are a great Hin∣drance
to Matters and Mistresses in setting up
religious Rules and Exercises in their Families.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and a great Discouragement in car∣rying
them on, when they are set up, and for
both those Reasons I would advise all my Friends
to take no Servants that had not some Sense of
Religion upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I joyn heartily with my Sister in
her Opinion, if such Servants can be had; But
what then must be done when we get irreligious
and prophane Creatures into our Houses, and
cannot help it; or find them so, when we ex∣pected
the contrary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do! my Dear! the case is plain; we
must not let Servants laugh us out of our Reli∣gion:
We must go on in the Way of our Du∣ty,
and set up the Worship of God in the House;
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
and as often as we find the Servants flout at it,
or contemn it, return the Contempt upon them∣selves,
and turn them out, but go on to perform
the Duty: Turn them all away, that pretend to
behave irreverently, or pretend to mock or scoff
at it; I say, turn them all away, and let it be
the standing known Rule in the Family, that all
the Servants that come may hear of it as soon
as they converse in the House; then they will
know what they have to trust to, and will be∣have
accordingly. 'Tis omitting our Duty in our
Families, not our performing it, that makes Servants
mock. When they see us religious to Day, and
wicked to morrow, they may well scoff; but
where serious Religion is steddily maintain'd in
a Family, it commands that Awe and Reverence
of Servants, that they grow religious of course.
Thus one good Family breeds good Servants for
another, and the good Examples of a sober Fa∣mily
makes the Servants all sober.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge all that: But I have not
practis'd that Part indeed, of turning them away
for their irreligious prophane Carriage when dis∣cover'd.
I have endeavour'd to get religious Ser∣vants,
but When I have found them otherwise, I
have not turn'd them off, which indeed I should
have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you are wrong, my Dear; for
why not put away a Coachman, or Chamber∣maid,
as well for being wicked as idle, for being an
Offender against Heaven, as well as for being an
Offender against our selves? I think the Rea∣soning
is every way as good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may hold in many cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Neice,</HI> I think it will hold in all
cases; and I can give you some Instances where
<PB N="340" REF="345"/>
it has been very happily practis'd, and where
Servants knowing it before, have behav'd much
the better on that Account: But 'tis late now;
we will talk of that Part another Time.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE. III.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG> Few Days after this Lady and her two
Neices had discours'd this Point, about
Servants, the Aunt and both her Neices,
that is to say, the eldest of the Sisters
and the Widow had another Dialogue upon the
Subject of giving a Character to Servants, and
the Justice that was to be done in it on one side
and on the ether, on the following Occasion.</P>
<P>The Eldest Sister had taken a very Scoundrel
idle Jade of a Servant, and that too after having
receiv'd a very good Character of her from a Gen∣tlewoman
with whom she had liv'd before; and she
complain'd heavily of the Injustice of it, and that
she had been abus'd by the said Gentlewoman,
and was telling her Tale to her Aunt, which in∣troduc'd
the following Dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find Child, you lay all the Fault of
your being disappointed upon the Wench's for∣mer
Mistress; you don't seem to say the Maid
her self has deceived you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Madam,</HI> I am deceiv'd both
ways; but I blame the Maid's former Mistress
most.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so? Did not the Maid pretend to
otherwise than you find her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="342" REF="347"/>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Madam,</HI> that is true; but I did
not expect so much from a Maid when she came
to be hir'd: I did not expect she should tell me
her own Faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but on the other hand, you did
not expect she should tell you she was able to
do what she did not understand, or should under∣take
what she was no ways qualified to perform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that's true Madam: But she
was willing to get into a good Place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to do it she must bs allow'd to
introduce her self by a Parcel of Lies and Shams,
and pretend to be what she has no Pretence to,
I think that as bad as any of the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I join with my Aunt in that Part.
I think the Law should have provided some Pu∣nishment
for Servants, that give themselves Cha∣racters
they do not deserve, as well as for other
Pieces of Dishonesty; for in short, it is a down
right Fraud, a Cheat and a Piece of Dishonesty,
intolerable; for Example, a Cook comes and
hires her self to me, to serve as such, and when
she has undertaken the Business, it appears she
understands nothing of Cookery, and has never
been any thing but a middle Maid to wash and
scrub the Rooms and the like; or a Chamber∣maid
offers her self, and tells me she knows how
to make Manteaus, cut Hair, clear-starch, and
the like; and when it comes to the Trial, ac∣knowledges
she does not understand any of them,
or only this, and not that, as it happens; why
should not this Maid be punished as well as she,
that pretending to be honest, proves a Thief?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>No Child; she does deserve to be ill
us'd; but the Case differs as to a Thief; for she
is punish'd, not for pretending Honesty, and de∣ceiving
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
me in her Character, but for her actual
Theft and robbing me of my Goods.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Madam,</HI> then the Punishment
should differ too. I do not say she should be
hang'd, but I think she should be punish'd how∣ever
some Way or other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have Ways to punish such a
Servant, and all Servants too, if all Mistresses
would but be just to themselves and to one ano∣ther.
We might make up the Deficiency of the
Law in that Case to our selves very easily, and
the Want of doing our selves Justice is the Thing
I complain of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>How would you make it up?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Madam,</HI> whenever any such
Servant came to me, I would be sure to turn her
away again with all the Resentment that her Be∣haviour
requir'd, and when she sent any future
Mistress to me for a Character, I would do her
Justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You should say Sister, that you
would do the Gentlewoman Justice who came
to enquire of you about her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly you put it right there, <HI>Sister.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed <HI>Madam,</HI> that is the Foundati∣on
of all the Grievance we are under about Ser∣vants,
that we make no Conscience of doing one
another Justice when we make Enquiries after
the Character of one anothers Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why we are loth to hinder poor
Servants; for to take away their Character is to
take away their Bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may say the same of a Thief, or
a House-breaker, when we find them in our Houses
or Gardens, and take them even in the very Fact:
We are loth to ruin them for it; that it was Ne∣cessity
forc'd them to do what they did, and if
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
we have them committed, they will be hang'd
or transported; nay the Argument is stronger,
because the Injury done may have been trifling,
and the Punishment there is Lois of Life, which we
may be loth to be concern'd in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You carry the Case a great deal too
high Sister; I cannot think they are alike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly Sister, I think 'tis much the
same; but of the two here is the greater Obli∣gation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I take your Notion right, <HI>Neice;</HI>
the Obligation is this; If I take the Thief, and
give him up to the Law he is undone, and his
Life must pay for it; and 'tis a sad Thing for
me to let a poor Fellow be put to Death or trans∣ported
for robbing me of a Trifle. But on the
other Hand I am to consider (1.) I am oblig'd
by the Law to do it; that, it is not I that put him
to Death, but the Laws of his Country and his
own Crime is the Cause of it; and I am an Of∣fender
against that very Law, and in some sense
a Confederate with him, at least an Encourager
of him in his Crime if I omit it: But which is more
than that, (2.) by (my perhaps unreasonable)
and indeed unjust Compassion, I become, ac∣cessary
to all the Robberies he shall be guilty
of after it; because if I had done as the Law di∣rected
me, I had put him out of a Condition to
rob or injure any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have fully explain'd my Mean∣ing
<HI>Madam,</HI> and I take the Case to be the same; I
by no means do as I ought, or as the Law directs, if
when my Neighbour taking a Servant after me,
and coming to me for a Character of her, I de∣cline
speaking the Truth of her, ay and the whole
Truth too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="345" REF="350"/>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then no Servant would get a Place
as Servants are now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then <HI>Neice,</HI> they would be more hum∣ble
and careful how they behave.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a nice Case, and we ought to
take great Care then, that we do net injure
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, we ought to do them
no Wrong; but we do the Person that is to take
them an irreparable Wrong if we recommend an
ill Servant to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, we break another Law that you have
not thought of yet; for we do not do in it as
we wou'd be done by, which is the great Chri∣stean
Rule.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not only so, <HI>Madam,</HI> but we do as
we wou'd not be done by; for would any of us
if we go to enquire of a Servant, be told she was
honest when she Was a Thief? that she was neat
when she was nasty; tite when she was a Slat∣tern;
diligent when she was idle; quiet when she
was saucy; and modest when she was, it may be,
a bold Hussy? <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I observe indeed, there is a general Back∣wardness
in People whenever we go to enquire
about a Servant. A Mistress cannot be suppos'd
to recommend earnestly, because it is to be granted,
that she parted with the Servant for something or
other. But she is therefore on the other Hand
shy and backward, and will say nothing or but
little of the real Character of the Servant, be∣cause
forsooth, she would not hinder her of a Place;
and indeed I would be very loth my self to ruin
a poor Girl, because I did not like her; but I
do think, as you say <HI>Neice,</HI> we Mistresses are too
<PB N="346" REF="351"/>
backward to be free with one another in such
Cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would not only answer the End,
<HI>Madam,</HI> as to the Law part, but it would bring
Servants back to be Servants again, as they us'd
to be, and as they ought to be; for really they
can hardly be call'd Servants now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish it was with us, in the Case
of our Maids, as it is with the Gentlemen in the
Case of their Men Servants, <HI>viz.</HI> that we should
be oblig'd to give Certificates to our Maids when
they went away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why even then, the Case would be
the same; for if the Form of the Certificate was
not settled too by the Act of Parliament, we
should sign any Thing they desir'd of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay Sister, that would be our
Faults.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, so it is our Faults now, Child, if
we give them wrong Characters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not say we should give wrong
Characters; but I should be loth to say the ut∣most
of a poor Servant, and so prejudice every
body against her; perhaps what she did amiss
with me, she might mend with another, and per∣haps
what might hot please me, another might
bear with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will put an End to all that im∣mediately,
Sister: I do not mean that I should
enter into a long Accusation of a Servant, and
give the History of her Life; or that I would blast
her for Trifles, or give her an ill Name for not
suiting exactly to my Temper. But I speak in
capital essential Articles, such as denominate a
Wench a good or a bad Servant, and I'll <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell
you a Case; when I went to a Lady my self to
<PB N="347" REF="352"/>
enquire about a Chambermaid who I had sent to
me by another Person.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was the Person that sent or re∣commended
her? Did she know her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was an honest well-meaning
poor Woman that us'd to help me to Maids when
I wanted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, I suppose did not know much
of her, of her own Knowledge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>No <HI>Madam,</HI> but the Maid gave me
an Account where she had liv'd last, and I went
to the Lady, and told her I came to enquire of
such a Maid-Servant, who, <HI>as she had said,</HI> had
liv'd with her. Yes, she told me she had liv'd
with her.</P>
</SP>
<P>Pray how long did she live with you, Ma∣dam?
<HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>Pray <HI>Madam,</HI> how long does she say she liv'd
with me? <HI>says she.</HI></P>
<P>Almost a Year, <HI>Madam, says I;</HI> I think it want∣ed
but a Month or thereabouts; at which she
made a kind of a Hum, and said nothing for a
while.</P>
<P>Now I did not like the Way of answering my
Question with a Question; for I thought she
might have told me positively how long the Maid
had liv'd with her, and left me to judge whe∣ther
she had spoke Truth, whereas, by returning
the Question upon me, she kept it in her own
Breast to accuse or excuse her. So I turn'd it
short upon her. I hope, <HI>Madam, said I,</HI> You will
be so plain with me, as to let me know whether
she says true or not.</P>
<P>Yes, yes? <HI>Madam, says she.</HI></P>
<P>This surpriz'd me again; for this had a double
meaning as plain as could be, and it was impos∣sible
to know whether she meant, Yes, that it
<PB N="348" REF="353"/>
was as the Maid had said, or Yes, that she would
let me know whether the Maid had said true
or no. So I stopp'd a while to give her Time
to go on, and explain her self; but finding she
did hot, I repeated my Question. Pray <HI>Madam,
says I,</HI> be pleas'd to let me know exactly how
long she liv'd with you.</P>
<P>Why <HI>Madam, says she,</HI> not quite a Year; the
Maid says true in that.</P>
<P>I was far from being satisfy'd with that Kind
of Answer, the manner of drawing out her
Words shewing me plainly, that the Wench had
lyed. However, lest I should quarrel with her
too soon, and so have no more out of her, I
dropp'd it and ask'd her some other Questions.</P>
<P>Pray <HI>Madam, says I,</HI> is she a good Workwo∣man?</P>
<P>Yes, yes, <HI>says she,</HI> she does her Work well e∣nough.</P>
<P>This was all Equivocation again. Any body
would have understood by my Question that I en∣quired
if she was good at her Needle, but she would
not take it as I meant it, and put it off with an
Answer which might be true, if the Wench knew
but how to make a Bed, or sweep a Room; so
I explain'd my self and said, <HI>Madam,</HI> by a good
Workwoman I mean at her Needle, I hope you
understand me.</P>
<P>Truly <HI>Madam, says she,</HI> I think she is well e∣nough,
I never put her to much of that Kind, ha∣ving
other Hands in the House.</P>
<P>Well, there she came better off with me a lit∣tle
than before, but still all this gave me no Cha∣racter
of the Maid, so I went on.</P>
<P>Pray <HI>Madam, says I,</HI> What do you say to her
Honesty? she is honest, I hope.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="354"/>
I have no Reason to tax her Honesty, <HI>says she,</HI>
she never wrong'd me of any Thing that I know
of; I charge her with nothing.</P>
<P>Even this was but a very indifferent Way of
vouching for a Girl's Honesty, and if she was real∣ly
honest, she was not just to her.</P>
<P>Well <HI>Madam, says I,</HI> may I ask you what was
the Occasion of your parting with her.</P>
<P>O <HI>Madam, says she,</HI> we parted indeed; she and
I could not agree; I am passionate and pretty
troublesome, and my Maid and I could not hit it,
but she may do very well with another. Perhaps
other Mistresses may not be so humersome and
difficult as I am; she may do very well; I assure
you, she knows how to please any body but me;
she told me so her self.</P>
<P>I was indeed provok'd now, and answer'd <HI>Ma∣dam,</HI>
you are pleas'd to give your self some hard
Words; but I beg you will allow me to say, I
did not come for a Character of the Maid's Mi∣stress,
but a Character of the Maid; and I doubt
by your Discourse, you are willing to recommend
your Maid's Character at the Expence of your
own.</P>
<P>She only smil'd at me when I said thus, and
said again, she was very difficult and ill to please;
but <HI>Betty</HI> might do very well with another.</P>
<P>I press'd her again to let me know what she
parted with her Maid for, but still she shuffled me
off, and gave me the cunningest evasive Answers;
<HI>Betty</HI> her self could not have put me off with
half the Dexterity as her Mistress did; so I made
my Honours as if I was going away.</P>
<P><HI>Madam, says I,</HI> You are exceeding tender of
your Maid; but I cannot say, you are equally just
to a Stranger, that you see resolv'd to depend up∣on
your Word for the Character of a Servant.
<PB N="350" REF="355"/>
However. I shall take it the Way I hope you
intend it, namely, that tho' it may not be for
the Girl's Advantage to have the Particulars of
her Behaviour told; yet you would have me un∣derstand
by it, that her Conduct will not bear
a Chaacter, and that you would not have me
venture upon her, and I shall take your Advice.</P>
<P>At this she seem'd concern'd, as if me had ex∣pected
that her awkward Way of talking of the
Wench had satisfy'd me, and that I did not un∣derstand
her, and as I offer'd to go, Pray <HI>Madam,
says she,</HI> don't say so; <HI>Betty</HI> may make you a
very good Servant; I am sorry you mould take
me so; the Maid may do very well in another
Place, tho' me might not suit me.</P>
<P>I observ'd in the Drawing-Room to the Room we
sat in there sat a Gentleman reading in a great Book;
and every now and then he look'd off of his Book
when his Wife (for it was her Husband) spoke, as if
he was surpriz'd at what she said, and as the Folding
Doors stood wide open, so that the Rooms were
as it were, let both into one, he heard all we
said, and I perceiv'd that as he look'd off of his
Book when his Wife spoke, so he almost laugh'd
out right when I spoke.</P>
<P>At last, as if he was not able to hold any lon∣ger,
he clapp'd up the Book pretty hard, and
threw it by, and came forward into the Room
we were in, and making me a very low Bow as
he pass'd, he offer'd to go out, when his Lady
stept up to him, and said something softly which
he answer'd softly, and with abundance of good
Humour in his Face laid to his Wife, my Dear,
I will not interrupt you; upon which I offer'd
to go away; By no means <HI>Madam</HI> said he, my
Business is of no moment. So taking hold of
his Wife's Hand, he as it were turn'd her to∣wards
<PB N="351" REF="356"/>
me, and at going away, my Dear, says he;
don't hold the Lady in Suspense about your Maid,
for I hear that is the Business; let her have a
true Character of her; you would be glad to be
dealt plainly with your self: His Wife smil'd
but said nothing at first, but presently turning to
him, and all in a pleasant good Humour, she gave
him a little Tap on the Arm with her Hand,
Do you give a Character of her if you think I
han't done it well. Must I says he, Why then
<HI>Madam,</HI> says he to me, with my Wife's Leave,
she is a damn'd Jade, a horrid Scold, a Liar, and
tho' she has, I believe, stollen nothing from us,
was a Thief in the Place where she came last from,
which we heard of since, and for that very thing
my Wife turned her away.</P>
<P>I made him a Cursy, and told him I was great∣ly
oblig'd to him for so much Sincerity, and
found his Lady had been only tender of the Maid's
Character, but had not at all recommended her.
Why <HI>Madam,</HI> says he, my Wife was cheated in
this Wench, only by the People she liv'd with
before giving her ambiguous Answers, and speak∣ing
as favourably of her as they could, and that
is the Ruin of us all, adds he, in taking Ser∣vants.</P>
<P>But Sir, says I, the Lady she liv'd with before
did your Lady a great deal of Wrong if she knew
her to be what you say she was in her Service.</P>
<P>I don't know <HI>Madam,</HI> how 'twas for that: I
never meddle with these Things, says he, but I
believe my Wife was not so nice in her Inquiries
as you are; or if she was, she was easier to be
cheated in their Answers?' and 'tis the Ladies
being thus backward to give just and plain Ac∣counts
to one another, that is the Reason that
such a wretched Gang of Wenches run from
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
House to House, and get Places, and behave in
them as they do. Would the Ladies, <HI>says he,</HI> be
just to one another, speak plain and honestly,
and give the Creatures such Characters as they
deserve, they would take Care to deserve better
Characters, and not behave so insolently and so
saucily as they do. This Jade, <HI>Madam,</HI> says he,
that you come to inquire of, has insulted and
taunted her Mistress two or three Times at
such a Rate, that I have been forc'd to send a
Footman into the Room to bring her out by
Head and Shoulders, for Fear her Mistress should
be frighted, and yet she is so good to that Slut,
that she cannot find in her Heart to speak the
Truth of her.</P>
<P>My Dear, <HI>says the Lady,</HI> I have not said any
Thing but Truth of her.</P>
<P>No, my Dear, <HI>says he,</HI> I do not mean so, but
you have not laid all the Truth of her.</P>
<P>Well, my Dear, <HI>says she again,</HI> I was not upon
my Oath.</P>
<P>Why, that is true too, Child, <HI>said he,</HI> but you
are upon your Honour, and that is Equivalent
to an Oath; and it would be hard to have this
Lady left to take such a Devil into her House,
meerly for Fear of injuring the Wench; why
you would injure the Family you suffer to take
her, much more than the Maid. Let her go seek
her Fortune where no body, knows her, and
there she may have Time to mend her manners,
and come to Town again.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Neice,</HI> this Gentleman was your In∣structor.
I think 'tis just his Language that you
speak; only I think you did not talk so mode∣rately
quite as he does.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And very good Language too, <HI>Ma∣dam,</HI>
'tis for want of this Gentleman's Rule that
<PB N="353" REF="358"/>
we have any saucy insolent idle Servants in the
World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would make Servants more cau∣tious
of their Behaviour I confess: But then Si∣ster,
it would put it into the Power of Mistres∣ses
to ruin poor Servants when they pleas'd, and
even when there was no good Cause; the Bread
of a Servant would depend upon the Breath of a
Mistress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no good in this World
without a Mixture of Evil; no Convenience
without its Inconvenience; but the Damage that
way, if it should be so at any Time is infinitely
less than the Mischief to Families which comes
by the Insolence and Wickedness of Servants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>May, by the universal Degeneracy of
Servants, you might have said; for even those
we call good Servants at this Time are quite dif∣ferent
Things from what they were in former
Times, ay, even since I can remember.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Madam,</HI> but I could propose a
Remedy even against that Part which my Sister
objects against, of doing Servants wrong; for I
do not deny that some Mistresses may injure
their Servants, and there ought to be no Wrong
on either hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have known a Mistrese refuse to
give a poor Servant a Character, only because she
was unwilling to part with her, and yet at the
same Time use her ill too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such Things may happen, I do not
deny that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have also known a Mistress injure
a Servant by her Partiality in Favour of other
Servants, and give a Maid an ill Character when
she has not deserv'd it, by the meer Reproaches
rais'd on her by others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="354" REF="359"/>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not possible to reckon up all
the Cases in which a Mistress may injure a Ser∣vant;
tis true, and there can no Rule be set so
exact, as that no Body shall be oppress'd: But I
have two Things to say;
<Q><P>1. All the Injustice that can be suppos'd to
happen that Way, is not equal to that
which Mistresses and Families now suffer
from the Insolence and Baseness of Ser∣vants;
and therefore the Remedy is to be
be and the letter Evil chosen.</P>
<P>2. There may be methods directed by the
Law, that in such Cases where Mistresses
have nothing Capital to charge upon a
Servant, they shall be obliged to give them
Certificates of their Behaviour.</P></Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often thought of that; but un∣less
the Form of that Certificate be settled and
adjusted by that very Act of Parliament, the
Mistresses will just write what they, please, and
when they are prejudic'd against a Servant, will
say nothing in their Certificates that shall do
them any Service, or recommend them at all to
any one else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those must be very malicious Peo∣ple
that will go that Length with a Servant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>But such People there are, and such
perhaps always will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, there may be a Remedy for
that too, for there may be two or three several
Forms of Certificates directed by the Law; one
Voluntier, and full to all the Behaviour of a Ser∣vant,
and the other to her Honesty and Sobrie∣ty
only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="355" REF="360"/>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then Child, no body would take a
Servant that had only your Second Rate Certi∣ficate;
they would presently say, her Mistress had
given no Character but what she could not help.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think, <HI>Madam,</HI> that all Ser∣vants
would content themselves with what you
are pleas'd to call my Second Rate Certificate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come let us hear what kind of Certifi∣cate
it is if you are Lawyer enough to draw it up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not Lawyer enough to draw it
up in Form; but it should be to this Purpose,
<HI>Madam.</HI></P>
</SP>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Certificate.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>A. B.</HI> do hereby certify that the
Bearer hereof <HI>M. B.</HI> liv'd with
me as a Chambermaid one Year
and a Quarter, ending the
Day of last, during which
Time she behav'd her self honestly,
modestly and dutifully as became
a Servant.</P>
<CLOSER>Witness my Hand.
<SIGNED>A. B.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly Neice, a Servant that could
not deserve so much Character as that, no body
ought to take.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="356" REF="361"/>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well <HI>Madam,</HI> and a Servant that
did deserve so much Character as that, no Mi∣stress
ought to deny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Sist.</SPEAKER>
<P>But suppose, Sister, a Mistress would
maliciously deny it, as I said before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then the Maid mould have the
same Remedy as she has for her Wages, <HI>viz.</HI>
complain to a Justice of Peace, that in Case upon
the Mistress being heard, if she could not give
sufficient Reasons and Proof of the Fact for which
she refusd such a Certificate, the Justice should
sign the Certificate to the Maid, intimating that
having heard all that could be alledg'd, he did
not find there was sufficient Cause for refusing
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Neice, and what was your first Rate
Certificate pray, that you call this the Second?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why <HI>Madam</HI> when a Mistess may
have a Kindness for a Servant, and is willing to
give her an extraordinary Recommendation, she
may add, that she is a very good Needlewoman,
or that she is a very good Cook, that she was
not only faithful but diligent, and so in other
Cases: But as I said, I believe any Servant will
be contented with the Second, which is suffici∣ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Niece.</SPEAKER>
<P>I agree that the giving such Cer∣tificates
would put an End to these Enquiries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which oftentimes leave us in the
dark as much as we were before they are made,
nay and sometimes more a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is our Fault indeed, that we will
not with Freedom and Plain ness acquaint one
another what we are to expect from the Maids
we hire; and 'tis presuming upon this charitable
Disposition of Mistresses, that Maids behave so
saucily as they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="357" REF="362"/>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if any of my Maids go from me,
I tell them plainly before hand what they are to
expect of me, and what Kind of Character I
shall give them, if they lend any body to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>First Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what Effect has it upon them?
Are they the better for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I'll tell you what Effect it had
upon one of my Maids. I had told her my
mind very roundly one Day upon Occasion of
something I did not like, and truly my Maid
turn'd very short upon me, and told me she was
sorry she could not please me, and hop'd I would
provide my self then; I told her, that she should
not say, she could not please me, but that she
would not please me.</P>
</SP>
<P>She answer'd very pertly, that it was <HI>as I would,
I might take it which Way I pleas'd.</HI></P>
<P>Very well, says I, <HI>Mary,</HI> you are very tart with
me. I hope when you tend your next Mistress
to me for a Character, you will expect to hear
those very Words again.</P>
<P>Why, wou'd I be so barbarous <HI>said she,</HI> to rip up
Words that pass'd in Anger, and give them for the
Character of any Servant?</P>
<P>No <HI>Mary,</HI> says I, you should not say, will I be
so barbarous; you mould say, would I be so ho∣nest,
as to give a Character of you from your
own Mouth. Depend upon it, <HI>Mary,</HI> says I, I
shall not be so unjust to any Mistress to conceal
a Thing of that moment from them; why it
would be doing them the greatest Injury in the
World.</P>
<P>She stood still a good while, and said nothing;
but as she saw me looking at her, as if I expected
an Answer, the Girl fell a crying, run to me,
and offering to kneel to me, begg'd my Pardon,
and told me she hop'd I would allow her to re∣call
<PB N="358" REF="363" MS="y"/>
her Warning, for she was resolv'd she would
live with me till she had deserv'd a better Cha∣racter.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor Girl! I should have told her she
might go when she would then, for she had de∣serv'd
a better Character just then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not say so to her, but I would
not let her kneel; and I told her I would not
insist upon her Warning; for as long as she be∣hav'd
so to me, I believ'd I should never put her
away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but did she mend afterward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed she was a very good Servant
before, only a little hasty and impatient of Re∣proof;
but she prov'd the best Servant after it
that any body ever had. She is with me still.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aunt.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is certainly so, if we gave fair bold
and just Characters of them, and it once came
to be the Custom or general Usage among Mi∣stresses,
Servants would quickly carry it after ano∣ther
Manner; at least they would take care to
part upon as good Terms as they could with their
Mistresses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sec. Neice.</SPEAKER>
<P>And we should not cheat one ano∣ther
as we do now, in giving Characters to the
vilest Creatures that fall in our Way.</P>
