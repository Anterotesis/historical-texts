<HEAD>KILKENNY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county is bounded on the south by the county of Waterford; on the north by the Queen's county; on the west by the county of Tipperary; on the east by the counties of Wex∣ford and Catherlogh; and on the north-west by Up∣per Ossory. The greatest length of this county from north to south, is forty miles, the breadth from east to west, twenty, and it contains ten baronies. It is one of the most healthful, pleasant, and po∣pulous counties of Ireland; for it is said to have all the elements in perfection. The members sent by it to parliament are sixteen, viz. two for the county, two for Kilkenny, and two a-piece for Irish-town or St. Kennis, Gowran, Thomastown, Callan, In∣nistiock, and Knocktopher. This county is di∣vided, as it were, into two parts, by the river Neor or Nura, which has its source in those lofty
<PB N="4" REF="30"/>
mountains called the Slieu-bloom or Blandine∣hills.</P>
<P>Kilkenny, the capital, takes its name from the cell or church of Canic, who was an eminent her∣mit in this country. It is the seat of the bishop of Ossory, which was translated from Agabo, in Ossory, about the end of Henry II's reign, by bishop O Dullany. The city is divided into the English and Irish towns. The English town is much the newer and most considerable; the other, (which is also called St. Kennys, or Canics, from the cathedral dedicated to that saint, which stands upon an eminence, where there is a most de∣lightful prospect) being only a kind of suburbs. Both together make one of the largest, most wealthy, populous, and trading towns in the king∣dom. Here are barracks for a troop of horse and four companies of foot, and a well endowed free∣school, called the college. The supreme council of the rebels under the pope's nuncio sat at Kil∣kenny during the time of the general massacre. The city is pleasantly situated on the Neor, a navi∣gable river that discharges itself into the harbour of Waterford. It is said of Kilkenny, that its air is without fog, its water without mud, its fire without smoke, and its streets paved with marble. The two latter are, indeed, matter of fact; for they have, in the neighbourhood, a kind of coal that burns from first to last without smoke, and pretty much resembles the Welsh coal. Most of the streets also are actually paved with a very good sort of black marble, of which they have large quarries near the town, which takes a fine polish, and is beautifully intermixed with white granite. The air too is good and healthy, though not re∣markably clearer than in many other parts of the kingdom. Here is the antient seat of the Ormond family, which is an ornament to the city; and the
<PB N="5" REF="40"/>
neighbouring country is well cultivated and very fertile.</P>
<P>About two miles from this city, in the neigh∣bourhood of the park-house of Donmore, formerly occupied by the duke of Ormond, are a number of caves as curious, perhaps, as any mentioned in history, except those of Antiparos in the Archi∣pelago: we shall present the reader with a descrip∣tion of them taken on the spot, and sent us by an ingenious gentleman of Dublin. "After a difficult descent of about one hundred feet, the entrance into this subterraneous world is gained. The ap∣pearance of the first cavern is uncommonly awful, and gives rise to an idea of a Gothic structure, grand in ruin. The solemnity of this place is not a little encreased by the gaiety of those scenes that present themselves on every side, previous to our entering it. The floor is uneven, and stones of various sizes are promiscuously dispersed upon it. The sides are composed of ragged work, in some parts covered with moss, and in others curiously frosted; and from the roof, which is a kind of arch, several huge rocks project beyond each other, that seem to threaten instant ruin. The circum∣ference of this cave is not less than two hundred feet, and its height about fifty. Here is a small but continually dropping of water from the ceil∣ing, and a few petrifactions resembling icicles. This place has its inhabitants; for immediately on entering into it, you are surprized with a confused noise, which is occasioned by a multitude of wild pigeons. Hence there is a passage towards the left, where, by a small ascent, a kind of hole is gained, like, but larger, than the mouth of an oven, which introduces to a place, where, by the help of candles, day-light being entirely excluded, a broken and surprising scene of monstrous stones, heaped on each other, chequered with various
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
colours, inequality of rocks over-head, and an in∣finity of statactical stones, presents itself. Nature, one would imagine, designed the first cave as a preparative for what remains to be seen; by it the eye is familiarized to uncommon and awful ob∣jects, and the mind tolerably fortified against those ideas that result from a combination of ap∣pearances, unthought of, surprising, and mena∣cing. The spectator flatters himself that he has nothing to behold more awful, nor any thing more dangerous to meet, than what he finds in the first cavern, but he soon discovers his mistake; for the bare want of that light which dresses na∣ture with gaiety is alone sufficient to render the second far more dreadful. In the first he fancies ruin frowns upon him from several parts; but in this it is threatened from a thousand vast rocks rudely piled on each other, that compose the sides, which seem bending in, and a multitude of no smaller size are pendent from the roof in the most extraordinary manner: add to this, that by a false step one would be dashed from precipice to precipice. Indeed, it would be matter of much difficulty, or rather impracticable, to walk over this apartment, had not nature, as if studious for the safety of the curious, caused sorts of branches to shoot from the surface of the rocks, which are re∣markably smooth, very unequal, and always damp. These branches are from four to six inches in length, and nearly as thick. They are useful in the summits of the rocks to prevent slipping, and in the sides are ladders, whereby to descend and ascend with tolerable facility. This astonish∣ing amfractuous passage leads to a place far more curious than any of the rest, On entering into it, one is almost induced to believe himself situated in an antient temple, decorated with all the expence of art; yet, notwithstanding the beauty and splen∣dour
<PB N="7" REF="60"/>
that catches the eye on every side, there is something of solemnity in the fashion of the place, which must be felt by the most ordinary spectator. The floor, in some parts, is covered with a crystal∣line substance; the sides, in many places, are in∣crusted with the same, wrought in a mode not un∣like the Gothic stile of ornament, and the top is almost intirely covered with inverted pyramids of the like elegantly white and lucid matter. At the points of these statactical streets are perpetually hanging drops of pellucid water, for when one falls, another succeeds. These pendent gems contribute not a little to the glory of the roof, which, when the place is properly illuminated, appears as if formed of the purest crystal. Here are three extraordinary and beautiful congelations, which, without the aid of a strong imagination, may be taken for an organ, altar, and cross. The former, except when strictly examined, appears to be a regular work of art, and is of a considera∣ble size; the second is of a simple form, rather long than square; and the third reaches from the floor to the roof, which must be about twenty feet. These curious figures are owing to water that fall from the upper parts of the cave to the ground, which coagulated into stone from time to time, until at length it acquired those forms which are now so pleasing; or to an exsudation or ex∣tillation of petrifying juices out of the earth; or perhaps they partake of the nature of spar, which is a kind of rock plant. The former seems to be the most probable supposition, as these figures, in colour and consistence, appear exactly like the icicles on the top, which are only seen from the wet parts of the caverns; and in this place there is a greater oozing of water, and a much larger number of petrifactions than in any other. When this curious apartment has been sufficiently ex∣amined,
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
the guides lead you for a considerable way through winding places, until a glimmering light agreeably surprizes. Here the journey of above a quarter of a mile, through those parts, is ended: but, upon returning into the first cavern, the entrance into other appartments, less curious indeed, but as extensive as those we have described, offers itself. The passages into some of those are so very low, that there is a necessity of creeping through them: by these we proceed until the noise of a subterranean river is heard, but farther none have ventured.</P>
<P>Gowran is a considerable town and corporation, with a strong castle. It had formerly walls, and gave title of baron to the lord Cutts, but now to the earl of Upper-Ossory.</P>
<P>Thomastown. The Irish name of this town is Bala-mac-Andan, and both it and the English name are derived from the founder Thomas Fitz-Anthony, an Englishman, who lived in the reign of Henry III. and whose descendants were long lords of it. It stands also on the river Nure, or Neor, is fortified, and reckoned the second town of the county.</P>
<P>Innistiock, or Ennesteog, is a considerable town on the banks of the Neor.</P>
<P>St. Kenny's, alias Irish-town, Callan, Knockto∣pher, and Ballyragget, are small places.</P>
<P>Castlecomer, a village famous for its coal-pits, gives the title of viscount to the earl of Wandes∣ford, and Killaghy that of baron to the earl of Tyrconnel.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WEXFORD, or WEISFORD.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Wicklow on the north; St. George's-channel on the south and south-west; and part of Catherlogh and Kilkenny on the west.
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
Its greatest length is about forty-seven miles, breadth about twenty-seven, and contains eight baronies. The air is good, but the soil various. In some places it is coarse and poor, in others fruitful both in corn and grass. The county sends eighteen members to parliament; namely, two for the county, and two for each of the boroughs of Wexford, New-Ross, Ennescorthy, Feathard, New∣borough, Bannow, Clomines, Taghman.</P>
<P>Wexford, or Weisford, the capital of the coun∣ty, is a large, antient town, at the mouth of the Slane, the first place the English got possession of when they invaded Ireland in 1170, and is now much frequented by strangers in summer, on ac∣count of a chalybeate spring near it. Here is a very good harbour for vessels of considerable burden, and barracks for two companies of foot, with a very antient castle still standing. Both Wexford and Waterford give title of earl to the Talbots, earls of Shrewsbury, in England.</P>
<P>New-Ross had antiently walls, with a cathedral and bishop; but the see was afterwards united to that of Cork. Here are barracks for a troop of horse, and a key, to which ships of good burden come up the river, formed by the conjunction of the Nure and Barrow, and called the river of Ross. This town is still a place of considerable trade, but was antiently larger and more populous than it is at present.</P>
<P>Duncannon. Here are barracks for three com∣panies of foot, with a strong fort upon the river Barrow, which it commands so entirely, that no ship can get to Ross or Watersord out of the reach of its guns. On the extremity of the neck of land that shoots here into the sea is a tower, called Hook-tower, and a light-house for the direction of mariners. This place gives title of viscount to the earl of Besborough.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="90"/>
Feathard stands on the same river as Duncannon; and has a harbour for ships.</P>
<P>Enniscorthy, a small town, stands at the con∣flux of the Urrin and Slane, and has barracks for two companies of foot.</P>
<P>Fernes, a small place, had formerly a castle, and is now the see of a bishop, to which Leighlin has been united since the year 1600.</P>
<P>Newborough, alias Gorey, is a small town, giving title of baron to the earl of Cholmondeley, an English peer.</P>
<P>Bennow, Clomines, and Taghman, are all small places.</P>
<P>In this county is the barony of Shelburn, which belongs, and gives title of earl, to the family of Petty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of CONNAUGHT.</HEAD>
<P>On the south and south-east, it is separated from Munster by the Shannon; by the same river from Leinster on the east; on the west it is bounded by the main ocean; and on the north and north-west by the province of Ulster, and a part of the wes∣tern ocean. Its length is about one hundred and thirty-miles, its breadth about eighty-four, and its circumference about five hundred. According to Templeman it contains an area of six thousand and seventy-two square miles. It is divided into six counties, and three hundred and sixty-six parishes, in which are one archbishopric, two bi∣shoprics, seven market-towns, and twelve boroughs that send members to parliament. Of the four provinces in Ireland, this is the most mountainous and barren, the least cultivated and enclosed, the thinnest of inhabitants, and these inhabitants the
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
most ignorant and unpolished, being many of them Roman catholics equally blind, bigotted, and su∣perstitious. "If there are any wild Irish to be found, says the intelligent author of the Hibernia Curiosa, in any part of the kingdom, it is in the western part of this province, where they have the least sense of law and government, and where the haughty and tyrannic landlords have almost depo∣pulated the country by their oppressive measures. The will and pleasure of the chiefs, as in the High∣lands of Scotland, is absolute law to the poor inha∣bitants that are connected with them, who live in the most abject slavery under their petty sovereigns." Grazing is the chief employment of the peasants. Immense numbers of sheep and bullocks are bred in this province, particularly in the counties of Clare and Gallway. All over the kingdom, but especially in this province, the lands are let in small parcels of twenty or thirty pounds a year, at third, fourth, and fifth hand from the first proprietor. Hence it comes to pass, that the landlords, first and subordinate, obtain all that is made of the land, and the tenants, for their labour, get poverty and potatoes. This province abounds in horses, game, venison, honey, and hawks; it is also well sup∣plied with fish, having many convenient bays and creeks on the coast, and several rivers, parti∣cularly the Shannon, Moy, Suck, Drosos, and Gyll. Its foreign trade, however, is very incon∣siderable. The air of the province was formerly indifferent on account of the bogs and woods, but is now much altered for the better. The names of the counties in this province are Thomond, or Clare, Gallway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligoe, and Leitrim, of which in order.</P>

<PB N="12" REF="110"/>
<HEAD>THOMOND, or CLARE.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is called by the Irish Towown, and was antiently reckoned a part of Munster, has the county of Gallway on the north; on the east and south is parted by the Shannon from Tipperary, Limeric, and Kerry, in Munster; and on the west is bounded by the ocean. It is about forty miles in length, thirty-eight in breadth, and contains about four hundred and twenty-eight thousand one hundred and eighty-seven acres, divided into nine baronies, in which are two market-towns and one parliamentary bo∣rough, namely Ennis, which sends one member to parliament, and the county another. The latter gives also the title of earl to a branch of the family of Obrian, as Inchiquin does to another branch.</P>
<P>Ennis is the county-town, and by much the best in it, standing about two miles from Dublin, on a lake formed by the Shannon, and has a market.</P>
<P>Killaloe, a bishop's see, with the privilege of a fair and market, stands on the Shannon, and was once much more considerable than at present. The bishop, in Latin, is called episcopus Laonensis, or Ladensis. His diocese, since that of Roscree was united to it, about the end of the twelfth century, is very large, containing an hundred parish churches, besides chapels. A little to the south of this town is a ridge of rocks, which run quite a-cross the river Shannon, and stop all navigation further up.</P>
<P>Kilfernora, or Kilkennerag, though at present an inconsiderable place, was formerly a bishop's see, which is now united to the bishopric of Clon∣fert.</P>
<P>Clare, standing on a creek of the Shannon that is full of islands, gives the title of baron to a branch of the family of Nugent, and name to the
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
county, of which it was once the capital. It took its name from Richard and Thomas de Clare, younger sons of the earl of Gloucester, to whom Edward I. gave the county; and who built several towns and castles in it, one in particular here, to which they gave their name. At this place are barracks for two companies of foot, and a seat of the earl of Thomond.</P>
<P>Bunrotty is a little town near the Shannon. It had antiently a castle, and a seat of the earls of Tho∣mond, to whom it belongs.</P>
<P>Bryan's-bridge, Six-mile-bridge, Newmarket, and Corofin, are small places: the first has bar∣racks for a troop of horse.</P>
<P>Kilmurray, in this county, gives title of viscount to the family of Needham.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GALLWAY.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the south by Tho∣mond; on the north and north-east by Mayo, Meath, and Roscommon; on the west by the main ocean; and on the east and south-east by part of Roscommon, King's-county, and Tipperary, from which last it is parted by the Shannon. It is the largest county but one in Ireland, extending in length eighty-two miles, in breadth forty-eight, and containing thirteen baronies, in which are about seven hundred and seventy-five thousand five hundred and twenty-five acres. Both the air and soil of this county are in general good; and if the latter is any where bad or indifferent, there is plenty of limestone wherewith to improve it. It is pretty fertile in corn, pasture, and cattle, espe∣cially in the south and east parts, where it is best inhabited. On the west side it has many bays, rocks, and islands, among which is one called Ar∣ran, that gives title of earl to the family of Gore.
<PB N="14" REF="130"/>
This county sends eight members to parliament, namely, two for itself, and two for each of the bo∣roughs of Gallway, Athenree, and Tuam.</P>
<P>Gallway is not only the capital of the county, but the second or third town in the kingdom. It is seated near a noble bay, which running above thirty miles up into the country from the western ocean, has many harbours and roads on every side; and is sheltered by several isles at its mouth, between which are broad and deep channels called sounds. It is a very neat, strong, and flourishing city; and be∣ing admirably situated for a trade not only to France and Spain, but also to the West-Indies, has a set of as substantial merchants and shopkeepers, as any city in the three kingdoms of its extent. The buildings, both public and private, are generally of stone, and handsome. The harbour is about two miles from the city, to which the goods are brought in lighters. Here are barracks for two companies of foot. The city is walled, and was once the see of a bishop, but is now within the archbishopric of Tuam. It carries on a very con∣siderable herring fishery, and is almost the only place upon this coast that has any foreign trade. Lough-Corrib, at whose fall into the bay the city stands, is of great length but not above five miles in breadth. Cambden tells us that it contains, in∣cluding those in the bay, three hundred islands co∣vered with grass and pines. Gallway gives the title of viscount to the family of Moncton.</P>
<P>Tuam has been the see of an archbishop ever since the beginning of the sixth century; and tho' now but a poor place, was once a famous city. It gives the title of viscount to the family of Wen∣men.</P>
<P>Athenry contains barracks for three companies of foot. This place was antiently walled, and more considerable than it is at present. It gives title of
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
baron to the earl of Louth, of the name of Ber∣mingham.</P>
<P>Clonfert, though the see of a bishop, is but a poor decayed place.</P>
<P>Aghrim, where in 1691 general Ginkle obtained a great victory over the Irish and French, killing seven thousand, and taking about six hundred and fifty of them, together with the French general St. Ruth, prisoners, is little better than a village, but has a castle, and gives the title of baron to a de∣scendant of general Ginkle.</P>
<P>Eyres-Court is a pretty little thriving town.</P>
<P>Gort is only a small town.</P>
<P>Portumna, Headford, and Loughrea, are small places, having barracks each for a troop of horse.</P>
<P>Clanricarde, in this county, gives the title of earl, and Dunkellyn that of baron, to the antient family of De Burgh, which now has precedence of all the other earls of Ireland.</P>
<P>Hatley gives the title of baron to the family of St. George; Headford, or Headfort, that of vis∣count to the family of the name of Taylor.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MAYO.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the south and south-east by the county of Gallway; on the north-east by Sligoe; by Roscommon on the east; and by the sea on the west and north. It is fifty-eight miles long, and forty-four broad, containing seven hundred and twenty-four thousand six hundred and forty acres, which are divided into nine baronies. There is but one borough in the county, namely, Castlebar, which sends two members to parliament. As it has the sea on one side, and abounds in lakes, the air is moist and cold, especially upon the mountains, where the soil also is poor and coarse; but in the other parts there is good pasturage, with herds of cattle and deer, honey, fish, hawks, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="150"/>
Among the other lakes and rivers in this coun∣ty abounding with fish, particularly salmon, is Lough-Mask, a lake eleven miles long, and five broad. Hereabouts were formerly seated the Gal∣loglasses, a people descended from the Scots of the western isles, who used to fight in coats of mail with two-edged battle axes.</P>
<P>Mayo stands on the borders of Sligoe, at the mouth of the river Moy, or Mayo, and was once a bishop's-see; but the bishopric hath been annex∣ed to Tuam. It is still the county-town, tho' much decayed, and gives the title of viscount to the family of Bourke.</P>
<P>Killala stands on a large bay of the sea, in the north corner of the county. It is but a small town, tho' a bishop's-see, in the barony of Tyrawley, which gives the title of baron to the family of O Hara.</P>
<P>Castlebar, the only parliamentary borough in the county, contains barracks for a troop of horse, and stands on a little river, which falls into Lough-Conn.</P>
<P>Foxford, a small town, stands on the river Moy, and has a good market.</P>
<P>Ballinrobe, Newport, Minsla, are small places.</P>
<P>Clan-Morris, the name of a barony in this coun∣ty, gives the title of viscount to the earl of Kerry.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROSCOMMON.</HEAD>
<P>This county is of great length, but narrow; bounded on the west by the river Suc; on the east by the Shannon; on the north by the Curlew mountains; on the south and south-east by the King's county, with part of Gallway. Its length is thirty-five miles, and its breadth twenty-eight. It contains three hundred and twenty-four thou∣sand three hundred and seventy acres, divided into
<PB N="17" REF="160"/>
six baronies, in which are two market-towns, and three parliamentary boroughs; so that the county <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nds eight members to parliament, viz. two for each of these boroughs, and two knights for the shire. The air of the county, both on the plains and mountains, is healthy. The soil yields plenty of grass, with some corn, and feeds nume∣rous herds of cattle. The Curlew mountains on the north are very high and steep, and till a road, with great labour and difficulty, was cut through them were unpassable.</P>
<P>Roscommon, which gives name to the county, and title of earl to the family of Dillon, tho' not large, is both a parliamentary borough and the county town.</P>
<P>Athlone, which we described in West-Meath, stands partly in this county.</P>
<P>Elphin is the see of a bishop, but otherwise of little account.</P>
<P>Abbey-Boyle, where was antiently a famous monastery, is a small townstanding on the lake Key, near the borders of Sligo. It has a good market, and sends members to parliament.</P>
<P>Castlereagh stands on the road between Ros∣common and Killala. It is a thriving little town, and has a good market.</P>
<P>Tulsk is the third parliamentary borough, but otherwise of little note.</P>
<P>Ballina-Sloe, a small town, but remarkable for one of the largest beast or stock-fairs in the king's dominions, which continues a week. The toll of the fair, which is kept twice a-year, in the spring and at Michaelmas, is worth to the possessor, on an average, six hundred pounds per ann. and yet it is only a penny a-head for bullocks, and six pence per score for sheep. The most distant parts of the kingdom are chiefly supplied from this fair.</P>

<HEAD>SLIGO.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the north and north∣west by the sea and the river Trobis, which issues from Loch-Erne, in Ulster; by the county of Leitrim on the east; Mayo on the west; and a part of that county and Roscommon on the south. It is divided from Leitrim and Roscommon by the Curlew mountains, and the river Suc, extend∣ing thirty-five miles in length from north to south, and thirty-three in breadth from east to west, and contains about two hundred and forty-one thou∣sand five hundred and fifty acres, divided into six baronies. It sends four members to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two for the shire∣town of Sligo. The air on the mountains of this county is much more wholesome than in the plains and vallies, which are full of bogs. As to the soil in the lower parts, where they are free from lakes and fens, it is good, and fit either for grazing or tillage.</P>
<P>Sligo, the capital, and only parliamentary bo∣rough of the county, stands on a bay, to which it gives name as well as to the county. Tho' not large, it is pretty populous, and has an old castle; but its trade is inconsiderable, notwithstanding its harbour is so deep, that ships of two hundred tons burden can come up to the key.</P>
<P>Achonry, now but a mean place, was once more considerable, and a bishop's-see, since united to that of Killala.</P>
<P>Coloony also is but a small place.</P>
<P>In the hill, or rather rock of Corren, in this county, many strange caves and recesses have been discovered. They are called the Giants∣houses, and supposed to be the work of the Danes.</P>

<HEAD>LEITRIM.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded by Donnegal - bay on the north; by Longford in Leinster on the south-east; by Sligo and part of Roscommon on the west and south-west; and by the counties of Fermanagh and Cavan in Ulster on the east and north-east. Its length is forty-four miles, and its breadth eighteen; but it is much indented on all sides. It contains about two hundred and six thousand eight hundred and thirty acres, divided into five baronies, and sends six members to par∣liament, viz. two for the county, and four for James-town and Carrick. The air is cold and sharp, but wholesome. It is a very bleak moun∣tainous country, but noted for grazing vast herds of cattle, of which there have been upwards of one hundred and twenty thousand head in it at one time.</P>
<P>Leitrim, which stands near the Shannon, gives name to the county, and title of baron to the earl of Harborough. It is the best town in the county, tho' much decayed, and is neither the shire∣town, nor sends members to parliament.</P>
<P>Carrick and James-town are both small places. The former is the shire-town.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of MUNSTER,</HEAD>
<P>Called in Latin Momonia, and in Irish Mown, is the most southerly of Ireland, bounded on the south by the Vergivian sea; on the west by the Atlantic ocean; on the north by the river Shan∣non, which parts it from Connaught; and on the east by the Irish sea. Its length is about one hun∣dred and thirty miles, but its breadth is very un∣equal,
<PB N="20" REF="190"/>
from sixty-eight miles to one hundred and twenty, and its circumference, including the windings, above six hundred miles. This pro∣vince, with the county of Thomond in Connaught, formed a petty kingdom before the English in∣vaded and conquered Ireland. The air of the province is temperate and healthful: as to the soil, the plains and vallies, where properly culti∣vated, are fruitful both in corn and grass, but the mountains are bleak and barren. The northern parts, being the most level and fertile, are the best improved and inclosed. Vast numbers of cat∣tle are fed in the province, which is also well sup∣plied with fish, especially cod and herrings. The counties contained in it are those of Waterford, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary, in which are fifty-two baronies, twenty-six boroughs that send members to parliament, seven market-towns, one archbishopric, five bishoprics, and eighty pa∣rishes.</P>

<HEAD>WATERFORD.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the west by the county of Cork; on the south by the ocean; on the north by the river Sure, which parts it from the county of Tipperary and Kilkenny; and on the east by its own haven, which parts it from the county of Wexford. Its greatest length, accord∣ing to some, is forty-six miles, but according to others, only thirty-eight; and its breadth twenty∣four. It contains two hundred and fifty-nine thou∣sand acres, and six baronies. The members it sends to parliament are two knights for the shire, and two burgesses a piece for Waterford city, Lismore, Dungarvan, and Tallagh.</P>
<P>Waterford, standing upon the river Sure, was first built by certain pirates of Norway, and hath been a bishop's-see ever since the year 1096,
<PB N="21" REF="200"/>
when these pirates, who had embraced christianity∣sent Malchus, a Benedictine monk of Winchester, to be consecrated their bishop by Anselmn, arch∣bishop of Canterbury. Till it was eclipsed by Cork, it was accounted the second city in the kingdom for trade, wealth, and populousness, being situated on a fine harbour, defended by Duncannon fort on the east side. The soil, how∣ever, about it is barren, and the air thick. Many considerable privileges have been conferred upon it by the kings of England, as a reward for its constant fidelity, since it was first reduced by Richard, earl of Pembroke. During the Irish rebellion it was in the hands of the rebels, who often made excursions from it, and committed great outrages; but Oliver Cromwell reduced it in 1650. The popish party got possession of it also in 1689, and held it till after the battle of the Boyn. Here is a fine cathedral; but the houses are generally of timber, and make but a mean ap∣pearance. The city drives a great trade, particu∣larly with England, and ships of burden come up close to its fine key. Waterford haven extends near eight miles and a half from south to north, almost in a strait line, all the way deep and clear, and but little encumbered with rocks or sand. The city and its liberties make a distinct county. There is a citadel on the west side, and on the east a block-house and store-house. "What detracts from the figure and appearance, says the author of the Hibernia Curiosa, of much the greater number, even of the largest towns of Ireland, of which this is one, is the dirty entrances, and the long strings of despicable huts, or cabbins, that most of them are pre∣faced with, the inland towns especially, into which one is generally introduced thro' a line of fifty or one hundred of those habitations of pover∣ty
<PB N="22" REF="210"/>
and oppression, on either hand; a whole street of which might be built for one hundred and fifty pounds, the materials and workmanship together of many of them not being worth twenty shillings: even the metropolis itself, on several of its most public entrances, is not without this disgraceful deformity, that at one view exhibits the wretched∣ness of the tenants, and the mean spiritedness of the landlords, who too generally for their own, and the reputation of their country, impose the building the houses on their lands upon a set of people, whose abilities will not enable them to employ any better materials than clay and straw." Waterford, jointly with Wexford, or Weisford, gives the title of earl to the earl of Shrewsbury in England, and is the county town.</P>
<P>Dungarvan has a castle and walls, gives title of viscount to the earl of Cork and Orrery; but tho' it stands on the sea, and has a tide-haven, it is a place of no great consequence or trade.</P>
<P>Lismore is an inland town upon the river Broad∣water, or Black-water, and was once the see of a bishop, which hath been annexed to that of Waterford ever since the year 1363. Here is a fine seat and park, which belonged to the late earl of Cork and Burlington, with a cathedral, free-school, and alms-house: but the town is now upon the decline.</P>
<P>Tallow, or Tallagh, is situated in a pleasant fertile vale near the river Black-water, which, be∣ing navigable from hence to Youghall, renders it a place of good trade. James I. made it a cor∣poration.</P>
<P>Cappaquin stands near Lismore on the Black∣water, and is noted for a victory over the popish rebels in 1642. Here are barracks for a troop of horse, and a good market. Vessels of consi∣derable
<PB N="23" REF="220"/>
burden may sail up to Cappaquin, where the river is twelve feet deep at low water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CORK.</HEAD>
<P>This county is the largest in the kingdom, con∣taining near a million of acres, plantation measure, divided into fifteen baronies. It is bounded on the east by the county of Waterford; by Kerry and the ocean on the west; Limerick on the north; and the Vergivian-sea on the south and south∣east. Including Desmond, it is eighty-five miles in length, and fifty in breadth; but is very un∣equal both ways. Tho' a considerable part of the county is boggy, mountainous, and barren, yet, by the industry of the inhabitants, it is pretty well cultivated and improved, and contains several good towns and harbours. The rivers with which it is watered, and the sea, supply it with plenty of fish. Besides the two knights of the shire, and two members for the city of Cork, it sends two to parliament for each of the following boroughs, viz. Youghall, Kingsale, Bandon∣bridge, Moyallow, Baltimore, Cloghnikilly, Char∣leville, Castlemartyr, Middleton, Rathcomuck, and Doneraile. This county, which in Latin is denominated Comitatus Corcagiensis, is the most populous and considerable of any in Ireland, next to that of Dublin.</P>
<P>Cork city is much the largest and most popu∣lous in the kingdom, next to the capital. It is en∣compassed not only by walls, but also by the chan∣nel of the river Lee, over which it has bridges on all sides. Cork is an episcopal see, and a city of great trade, situated fifteen miles up the river. Though smaller vessels can come up to the key, yet the larger generally ride at a place called Pas∣sage. The city, together with its liberties, makes
<PB N="24" REF="230"/>
a county, and is governed by a mayor, aldermen, and sheriffs. It has the most trade of any town in the kingdom, particularly in beef, butter, and tallow, of which great quantities are exported to France, Holland, Flanders, and the colonies; and many ships bound to the West-Indies put in here to victual. It had several abbeys formerly, and has now many handsome public structures, par∣ticularly a cathedral, custom-house, and two gates, one on the north and the other on the south. In the rebellion in 1641, it made a gallant defence against the rebels under the earl of Inchiquin; but fell afterwards into their hands, and was held by them till Cromwell recovered it. The rebels also got possession of it in 1690, but it was retaken by the duke of Marlborough. Five miles below Cork, the channel of the river is divided into two by an island, on which are several villages. "Cork, says the author of the Hibernia Curiosa, has the greatest trade of any in the kingdom, next to Dublin; and, indeed, is in the best situation for commerce. Its exports of beef and butter appear to be greater than those of any town in the king's dominions. The quantity of beef that is killed here from Michaelmas to Christmas is amazing; for three or four months at this time, a stranger would imagine it was the slaughter-house of Ire∣land. Cork is nearly as large as Bristol, but infi∣nitely better situated as to its navigation, at the bottom of a large, capacious, well sheltered bay or cove. A considerable part of the city is situ∣ated upon a flat, that was originally a morass, which, by the industry of the inhabitants, hath been raised several feet. Here continual additions are making to the many spacious streets already built. But what contributes greatly to the beauty as well as convenience of this part of the town and its trade, is the channels that are carried thro' most
<PB N="25" REF="240"/>
of the principal streets; so that merchandize of every kind can be brought by water to, or ship∣ped from the very warehouses of the merchants, who reside chiefly in this lower and modern part of the city, in houses really magnificent and su∣perb, that at the same exhibit the wealth of their owners, and are an ornament to the town. A large and elegant theatre hath been lately built here, in which dramatic performances are exhibited by a company from Dublin, during the summer va∣cation at the capital. Cork, indeed, may very justly be esteemed the most flourishing city in Ire∣land. The houses, in general, are well built, but the streets are many of them too narrow. Its churches are unexceptionably the neatest and the most elegantly finished of any in the kingdom for the number it contains." This city and Orrery, the name of a barony in this county, give both the title of earl to the noble family of Boyle.</P>
<P>Kingsale stands at the mouth of the river Bann, or Bandon, and is reckoned the third town in the kingdom, and only inferior to Cork in point of trade. Vast quantities of provisions are shipped off from hence to Flanders, Holland, France, and the West-Indies. The port indeed is barred, but ships of any burden may get over the bar at high∣water. On a point of land, called the old head of Kingsale, is a light-house to guide ships in the night to the mouth of the river. The town is neat, well built, wealthy, and extremely well for∣tified with lines and outworks. About two miles below the town are two strong forts, one on each side the river, which secure it against all attempts by sea. In 1601, eight thousand Spaniards landed here to join the rebels; but, upon finding that they had been defeated by the lord-deputy, ba∣ron Montjoy, they took possession of this town, which they were obliged, however, after an ob∣stinate
<PB N="26" REF="250"/>
defence, to surrender by capitulation, and to quit the island. Kingsale gives the title of baron to the very antient family of Courcy.</P>
<P>Rosse is now but a village; but was at one time more considerable, when it had a good harbour, now barred up, and was the see of a bishop, since united to Cork. It gives the title of earl to the family of Parsons.</P>
<P>Bandon-bridge was fortified formerly with walls and several castles, which were demolished by the French and Irish in 1690. The inhabitants are said to amount to about three thousand, all pro∣testants. As it stands on both sides the river Ban∣don, the two divisions are joined by a bridge, whence it takes its name.</P>
<P>Baltimore, a small borough, giving the title of baron to the family of Calvert, has a safe com∣modious haven on the sea, but very little trade.</P>
<P>A little to the southward, near the coast, lies Cape Clear, an island so called from its cape. Some ships of war are generally stationed here in time of war, to guard the coast against privateers: besides, here is a castle on the island, under whose cannon ships often come to anchor, it standing very conveniently for all such as are bound from Ireland to the southward, or vice versa.</P>
<P>Youghall is a pretty good town, with a conve∣nient harbour at the mouth of the Broad or Black∣water.</P>
<P>The other parliamentary boroughs are but small places, as are also Cloyne, the see of a bishop, Bantry, Skibbereen, Dunmanway, Macromp, Butte∣vant, Kanturk, Castleyons, Curryglass, Kilworth, Michelstown, Fermoy, Inniskean, Inishannon, Timoleague, Newmarket, Ballyclogh, Annagh, Douglas, Kilmeedy, and Charles-fort. Most of them, however, have barracks for a troop of horse or a company of soot. Charleville gives the
<PB N="27" REF="260"/>
title of earl to the family of Moore; Middleton and Doneraile those of viscounts, the first to the family of Broderick, and the other to that of St. Leger. Buttevant gives the title of viscount, and Barrymore that of earl to the family of Barry. Grandison gives the title of earl to the family of Villiers; Carberry that of baron to the family of Evans; Dunamore to the family of Hawley; Al∣tham to the earl of Anglesey; and Burton to the earl of Egmont. Desmond, a district in this county, which was formerly a county of itself, gives the title of earl to the family of Fielding.</P>
<P>On this coast, besides Youghall-bay, and the havens or bay of Cork, Kinsale, and Baltimore, are those of Dunmanus and Bautry, both very large. The last divides the county of Cork from that of Kerry.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>KERRY.</HEAD>
<P>This county has that of Limerick on the north; the Atlantic ocean on the west; and the county of Cork on the south and east. Desmond, which was once reckoned a county palatine, under the earls of Desmond, descended from one of the an∣tient petty Irish kings, makes a part of this coun∣ty; the rest of it lies in the county of Cork. The greatest length of the county of Kerry is about sixty miles, and breadth forty-seven. It contains about six hundred and thirty-seven thousand acres, divided into eight baronies, and sends eight mem∣bers to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two for each of the following boroughs, Dingle, Tralee, and Ardfert. The air of this county is wholesome, but sharp; and the soil of some parti∣cular spots fruitful both in corn and grass; but great part of the county is mountainous, dreary, barren, and almost uninhabited.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="270"/>
Tralee, Trally, or Trailey, the county-town, stands on a bay of the same name, and is a thriv∣ing corporation.</P>
<P>Ardfert was once the see of a bishop, now united to that of Limerick. The town stands near the sea, and has a harbour for small vessels.</P>
<P>Dingle is a walled town, standing on one of the largest bays in Ireland, where it has a good har∣bour. Here are also barracks, and one of the best markets in the county.</P>
<P>Castlemain stands on the river Mana, where it has a harbour, and gives the title of viscount to the family of Tilney.</P>
<P>Aghadoe, once a bishop's see, is now united to Limerick.</P>
<P>Smerwic, Castle-Island, Lixnaw, Listowell, and Kilarney, are small places.</P>
<P>This last gives name to a lake, one of the most beautiful, perhaps, in the world. This lake, which may not improperly be distinguished into three, the upper, lower, and middle, excepting one nar∣row valley on the south, thro' which a river runs into the upper lake, is surrounded with one con∣tinued range of lofty mountains, rocks, and pre∣cipices, the immense declivities of which are co∣vered with woods intermixed with ever-greens, from nearly their tops down to the verge of the lakes; add to this the number of rivulets cascad∣ing from channels skirted with trees of every kind down the sides of these enormous mountains, some of them to the height of a hundred yards. Over the lake are dispersed a great number of islands of very different extent, and all of them of any size, one only excepted, which is inhabited by an innumerable sight of rabbits, beautifully orna∣mented with trees of every kind, with a most de∣lightful intermixture of ever-greens, as box, holly, yew, and the arbutus, or strawberry-tree. Hol∣lies of a prodigious magnitude are found here,
<PB N="29" REF="280"/>
some of above two feet diameter in the body of the tree. The arbutus grows in great plenty and per∣fection on many of the islands; the largest of them are about six or seven inches in diameter, and fifteen or twenty feet high. They appear in their greatest beauty and perfection about November. There is a most enchanting prospect from some of the surrounding mountains, particularly from a very lofty one called the Turk, because its white chalky top looks like a Turkish turban. On the very summit of one of the Mangerton mountains, in the neighbourhood, is a small round lake, of about a quarter of a mile diameter a-cross the top, called the Devil's Punch-bowl. From the surface of the lake to the top of the sides of this vast concavity or bowl, may be about three hundred yards; and when viewed from the circular top, it really has a most astonishing appearance. The depth of it, doubtless, is vastly great, but not, as the natives of it pretend, unfathomable. The discharge of the superfluous waters of this bowl, thro' a chasm or gap into the middle lake, forms one of the finest cascades in the world, visible for above one hundred and fifty yards. The Devil's Punch∣bowl, as it is called in our maps, by the natives in the neighbourhood, is termed Poulier infrin, that is, the hole of hell. The echoes among the hills in the southern and more enclosed parts of the great lake, but especially in the winding, deep, and intricate valley leading from the lower to the upper lake, are equally delightful and astonishing. There are some cannon placed in the most advan∣tageous situations by the lord Kenmare, a Roman catholic nobleman, on purpose for the entertain∣ment of travellers, who generally provide them∣selves with ammunition for loading them. The reports, on the discharge of these cannon, resem∣ble the nearest of any thing in nature a most vio∣lent peal of thunder rolling among the mountains.
<PB N="30" REF="290"/>
Here also musical instruments, especially the horn and trumpet, afford the most delightful and ra∣vishing entertainment to the ear; and to a sports∣man nothing can equal the spirit and elevating joy of a stag-hunt among the woods and mountains about the lake of Kilarny, where the cry of the hounds, the harmony of the horns resounding from the hills on every side, the universal shouts of joy along the valleys, and from the sides of the mountains, re-echoing from hill to hill, and from rock to rock, gives the highest satisfaction and delight that can possibly arise from the chace. The stag is rouzed from the woods that skirt the lake, in which there are many of them that run wild by nature, like deer in an eastern forest, and are pro∣perly enough called wild stags. The gentlemen who attend the hunt are generally in boats on the lake, during the diversion; for to follow it by land, either on foot or horseback, is impracti∣cable. In some of the high craggy inaccessible rocks that surround the lakes, eagles are sometimes known to build, but their number is not conside∣rable. There is, indeed, one most stupendous and frightful rock, the front of which, to the water, is a most horrible precipice, called the eagles nest, from its being seldom without a nest of them upon its top. On the eastern side is a rich and fertile plain for two or three miles, thro' which descends a river into the lower lake; and thro' a valley at the west end, the whole collection of waters discharge themselves into the sea. On the north east side stands the town of Kilarny, in a delightful situation; and, in the summer∣time, from the number of visitors to the lake, is a very chearful lively town, being as much the fashion in Ireland to visit this lake at that season, as it is elsewhere to go to drink the waters at the public spas, or to bathe in the sea. In the neigh∣bourhood
<PB N="31" REF="300"/>
of the lake are a great many seats and villas, and the remains of an old abbey, spacious even in its ruins, and well deserving the notice of a traveller, together with those of the antient city of Ahadoe, particularly of the cathedral on the top of a hill, and an old castle on the island of Ross, which make a very agreeable contrast to the verdant beauties around. Pearls of great value are sometimes found about the lake; sal∣mon also are caught in great plenty and perfec∣tion, and sold at the moderate price of one penny per pound. The fishery is the property of the earl of Kenmare, to whom also belongs a great part, if not the whole, of the lake, with its beau∣tiful islands. The bowels of the peninsula, be∣tween the upper and lower lakes, are fraught with mines of copper; and even silver, it is said, hath been extracted from them. They are prodigiously deep, and have been worked a great way under the lake. As we cannot spare room here for a more particular description of this most delight∣ful spot, this earthly paradise, as it may justly be called, we must refer the curious reader to the Hibernia Curiosa, where he will find it described in a very minute, lively, and elegant manner.</P>
<P>The Blasques are small rocky islands on the coast of this county, one of which, called Valen∣cia, gives the title of viscount to the earl of An∣glesey, and has a village, fort, and harbour.</P>
<P>Mare, or Kilmare bay, is of great extent, run∣ning up many miles into the land.</P>
<P>This county gives the title of earl, Clanmorris that of viscount, and Lixnaw that of baron, to the family of Fitzmorris.</P>

<HEAD>LIMERICK.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the south by the county of Cork; on the north by the river Shan∣non, and a part of the county of Tipperary; on the west by Kerry; and on the east by Tipperary. It is about forty miles in length, twenty-seven in breadth, and contains about three hundred and seventy-five thousand three hundred and twenty acres, divided into eleven baronies. It gives the title of viscount to the earl of Clanbrassel of the name of Hamilton, and sends eight members to parliament, namely, two for the county, two for the city of Limerick, and two each for Kilmallock and Askeyton. The air and soil of this county is good, most part of it being pretty level. The mountains lie towards the west, and the highest, called Knock-patrick, i. e. St. Patrick's-hill, af∣fords a very fine prospect of the sea, the Shannon, and the adjacent country. This county is well inhabited, and abounds in corn and cattle.</P>
<P>Limerick, which gives name to and is the capital of this county, and the see of a bishop, is a very strong handsome town. It is called in Irish Loum∣nagh, and stands upon the Shannon, which is na∣vigable for ships of burden almost up to the city, though situated about sixty miles from its mouth. The city consists of two towns, the upper and lower both strongly fortified with walls, castles, bastions, and bulwarks, with draw-bridges upon the river. Here is a fine cathedral, and barracks for twenty-two companies of foot. Limerick held out three months against Oliver Cromwell's army; but famine and the plague compelled it at last to submit. In 1691, king William, to get possession of the town, and put an end to the Irish war, was fain to grant a very favourable capitulation not
<PB N="33" REF="320"/>
only to the town itself, but to the whole popish party throughout the kingdom. Here are some considerable merchants; but the trade is not so great as might be expected.</P>
<P>Askeaton, Adare, Rathkeal, Newcastle, Hos∣pitall, Bruff, and Kilfinan, are all small places.</P>
<P>Askeaton stands on the Shannon, and Adare on the river Mage, near where it falls into the Shannon.</P>

<HEAD>TIPPERARY.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the west by that of Limerick and the river Shannon; on the east by the county of Kilkenny; on the south by the counties of Cork and Waterford; and on the north and north-east by King's-county and the ter∣ritory of the antient O Carrols. It extends about sixty miles in length, thirty-six in breadth, con∣taining five hundred and ninety-nine thousand five hundred acres, divided into fourteen baro∣nies, in which are several market-towns and bo∣roughs. It sends eight members to parliament, viz. two for the county, two for the city of Cashel, and two for each of the boroughs of Clonmell, Fethard, and Thurles. The north part of it is mountainous and cold; but in the south the air is milder, and the soil much more sertile, producing plenty of corn, and good pasture for the numerous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep with which it abounds. The north part is called Ormond, and for a long time gave the title of earl, and af∣terwards of marquis and duke to the noble family of Butler, descended from a sister of Thomas a Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, till, at the accession of George I. the last duke was attainted of high treason, and died abroad. In that part of the county, the family had great prerogatives and privileges granted them by Edward III. An∣other
<PB N="34" REF="330"/>
district in this county was antiently called the county of the Holy Cross of Tipperary, from a famous abbey in it stiled Holy Cross, on account of a piece of Christ's cross that was said to be pre∣served there. This abbey and district enjoyed also special privileges in former times. The remains of the abbey, or rather the spot where it stood, are still held in great veneration and much resorted to by the Roman Catholics.</P>
<P>Cassel, or Cashel, the chief town of this coun∣ty, was made the see of an archbishop by pope Eugenius III. The cathedral stands without the city, upon an eminence, whence there is an agreea∣ble prospect. On the ascent to it is a great stone, at which it is said every new king of Munster used to be proclaimed. The city is now in a de∣clining state, having suffered much by war. It gives the title of viscount to the family of Bulkeley.</P>
<P>Clonmell, or Clomel, stands on the borders of the county of Waterford, and on the banks of the Sure. Here are barracks for two troops of horse, and a good market. The town is walled, neat, and populous, and has a strong gaol and court-hose, being the county-town. When it was besieged by Cromwell, the archbishop came with an army to raise the siege, but was defeated by Oliver, and hanged.</P>

<P>Thurles, seated on the Sure, is also a small place.</P>
<P>Emley, or Awn, where was formerly a bishop's see, which hath been united to Cashel since 1568. The town stands on the river Glason; and is said to have been once large and populous. A branch of the family of Fairfax takes the title of viscount from it.</P>
<P>Carrick on Sure. The dukes of Ormond, to whom this town gave the title of earl, as well as
<PB N="35" REF="340"/>
Ossory, had formerly a fine seat and park here. It is a handsome town with barracks for a troop of horse, and, to distinguish it from the other town of the same name, is commonly stiled Carrick on Sure. The right honourable Somerset Hamilton Butler now takes the title of earl from hence, and that of viscount from Ikerrin, a barony in this county.</P>
<P>Tipperary is a market-town, and was formerly the chief of the county, to which it gives name, but is of little note at this time.</P>

<P>The winters here are long and severe, and the autumns often wet and stormy; but the air is tolerably wholesome, being purified by frequent

high winds. The soil is fruitful in corn, flax, hemp, fruit, hops, and pasturage. Prussia also abounds with cattle, a good breed of horses, sheep, deer, and game. Wild beasts, such as bears, wolves, lynxes, wild boars, and foxes, are not uncommon. It is well supplied with fish from its lakes and rivers; and on the coasts of the Baltic are found great quantities of amber, in which are often inclosed leaves, minerals, flies, spiders, gnats, ants, fishes, frogs, drops of water, pieces of wood, and grains of sand; whence it is evident, that it was once in a fluid state. It is generally found on large trees buried in the ground, and is thought to be formed of an oil coagulated by vitriol. A great deal of it, washed off the trees by the waves in stormy weather, is found upon the sea-shore. It yields a revenue to the ground of about twenty∣six thousand dollars per annum. In this country is also found a sort of manna, and a kind of worm or insect, of whose eggs is made the beautiful red colour called St. John's-blood. For fuel there is plenty of wood and pit-coal. The woods also sup∣ply the inhabitants with wax, honey, pitch, &amp;c. The country is for the most part champaign and level, with several good ports on the Baltic, and carries on a considerable trade; in consequence of which the people live better here and in Po∣lish Prussia than in any other province of Poland. A great deal of glass is made in this country of the ashes of wood, and the largest sort of pebbles. The principal rivers of the country are the Vistula, the Pregel, the Memel, or Mammel, the Passarge, and the Alle, which, with the lakes and canals, afford great conveniences for transporting mer∣chandize; but sometimes do a great deal of da∣mage by their inundations.</P>

<P>The name of this country is thought to be a contraction of Porrussia, i. e. a country bordering on Russia; Pom, in the old Prussian language, sig∣nifying
<PB N="39" REF="380"/>
near, or hard by. In the thirteenth cen∣tury the knights of the Teutonic order made a conquest of the whole country, in which they committed the most inhuman barbarities; for in∣stead of converting, which they pretended was their view, they extirpated the natives, and placed the Germans, their countrymen, in their stead. In the year 1454, one half of Prussia revolted from the knights, and put itself under the protection of Poland. This occasioned an almost continual war betwixt that country and the Order till 1525, when, by a treaty concluded at Cracow, it was a∣greed, that Albert, margrave of Brandenburg, the thirty-fourth and last master of the order, should have the eastern part, under the title of a duchy, and that it should descend to his and his brother's male heirs, as a fief of Poland; but in 1657 the elector Frederic-William had the sove∣reignty of it confirmed to him and his heirs, on condition of its returning to the Poles, in case of the failure of heirs male. In 1701 it was raised to a kingdom by the elector Frederic, who was soon after acknowledged as king of Prussia by all the other christian powers.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORDER of KNIGHTHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>The elector Frederic, on the day of his coronation at Konigsberg, instituted the order of the Black∣eagle. The ensign is a cross of gold like that of Malta, enamelled with blue, which is worn at the end of a broad orange coloured ribbon, passing over the left shoulder. The motto is Suum cuique. The number of the knights is thirty, besides the sovereign, who is always grand master.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT, TAXES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The government of Prussia, under the king, is vested in a council, which superintends the affairs of the whole kingdom, political, civil, ecclesiastical, and feudal. Subordinate to this high college are a war and demesne chamber, and several tribunals of justice. The taxes are very heavy in this country, and their produce very considerable. With respect to the military establishment, the king keeps a large body of well disciplined troops here, as in all his other dominions. Every regiment has a particular district assigned it, the young men of which being registered in case of necessity, may be ordered to march, and join the regiment. According to a division of Prussia it consists of three parts, called Samland, Natangen, and Oberland, each of which are again divided into jurisdictions, or go∣vernments. Another division is into the German and Lithuanian departments; the former of which contains two hundred and eighty parishes, and the latter one hundred and five. The prin∣cipal places in both are as follows.</P>
<P>Konigsberg, the capital of the whole kingdom, seated in 54°. 43′. north latitude, on the river Pregel, over which it has seven bridges, is about eighty-four miles from Dantzic, contains about sixty thousand inhabitants, and is well for∣tified. This city was founded and named Konigs∣berg in honour of Ottocarus, or Premislaus I. king of Bohemia, in 1255, when that king came to the assistance of the Teutonic knights against the Pagan Samlanders. It is well built, and con∣tains a great number of stately houses, both pub∣lic and private, consisting properly of three towns, formed by so many branches of the river, with their respective suburbs. The names of these
<PB N="41" REF="400"/>
three parts are, the Alstadt, or old town, the Lobenicht, and Kneiphoff. The college here was founded in the year 1544 by the margrave Al∣bert, and has thirty-eight professors, exclusive of tutors. In the city and suburbs are a great many gardens, public and private. The town-house is a stately building, and so is the exchange. Here also is a magnificent palace, of which the greater part was built by the abovementioned Albert. It is very large, and is the place where most of the public offices, courts, and colleges are held. Its gardens and parks are great embellishments to it. The citadel, called Frederic's-burg, built in the year 1657, is a regular square surrounded with broad ditches, and the river Pregel. Near the palace is the Collegium Fredericianum mentioned already. This city was formerly a Hanse-town, and its trade is still very considerable. In the year 1752, near five hundred ships arrived in this port. Besides the hospitals and alms-houses, here is a charitable fund, from which above eight hundred people receive weekly pensions. The harbour is very good, and always full of shipping.</P>
<P>Pillau is a strong town, with a fine harbour, at the mouth of the bay or lake, called the Fresche-Haff, thirty miles west of Konigsberg. It is a place of good trade, and the larger vessels consign∣ed to Konigsberg deliver and take in their car∣goes here, the Fresche-Haff not having a sufficient depth of water to carry them up to Konigsberg. The town and harbour are defended by a strong fort, well planted with cannon. The peninsula in which they stand is so pleasant and fertile, that it is called the Paradise of Prussia. In the village of Wogram, not far from hence, the sturgeons are boiled and packed up, and caviar made of their roes, of which the greater part is exported to England.</P>

<P>Marienwarden, in Latin Insula Mariana, a well built town not far from the Vistula, and on the frontiers of Pomerania, in a pleasant country. The cathedral and palace here are stately Gothic structures, especially the former. Here are salt∣works, with a magazine for corn and forage, and a considerable trade. In 1709 the czar Peter the Great had an interview with Frederic I. king of Prussia, at this place, and in 1734 king Stanislaus retired to it from Dantzic.</P>
<P>Holland, a handsome well fortified town, near the river Weeske, with a castle, and free fishery on the Drausen lake. Here also are salt-works, and a magazine for corn and forage. Not far from hence are several fine seats belonging to count Dohna, and other noblemen.</P>
<P>Mohrungen, a little but well built and fortified town on the lake, which takes its name from it.</P>
<P>Memel, a well fortified town, with a harbour on the bay or lake called the Curische-Haff, eighty miles from Konigsberg, one hundred and forty-six from Dantzic, and two hundred and twenty-three from Warsaw. It is a place of some trade, great quantities of flax, linseed, thread, and hemp being annually exported from hence. Here also is some

soap-boiling and brewing, with a royal magazine, salt-factory, and a strong citadel.</P>
<P>Tilset, the largest and most wealthy town in Prussia next to Konigsberg, stands on the river Memel, and carries on a great trade, especially with Konigsberg. In the neighbouring country, which is very fertile, great numbers of cattle are bred, and excellent butter and cheese made. Here also is a salt factory, and a castle.</P>
<P>Insterburg, a considerable town at the conflux of the Angerap with the Inster, carries on a considerable trade in beer and corn, and the num∣ber of its inhabitants is about three thousand. Here is a castle, a granary, and salt-factory, with a high court of justice.</P>
<P>Gumbinnen, a well built town on the Pisse. Here is a good cloth manufacture, and a royal magazine. The war and demesne offices are also kept here.</P>

<HEAD>POLAND, Including LITHUANIA and COURLAND.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BOUNDARIES, EXTENT, and CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS large kingdom is bounded towards the south by Moldavia, Transylvania, and Hungary; to the north by Prussia, Livo∣nia, and Russia; to the west by Silesia, Branden∣burg, and Pomerania; and to the east by Russia and Little Tartary. Its extent from east to west is about eight hundred miles, and from north to south about five hundred and sixty. It was an∣tiently a part of Sarmatia Europea.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is cold in the north, but temperate in the other parts of the kingdom, both in summer

and winter, and the weather in both more settled than in many other countries. The face of the kingdom is, for the most part, level, and the hills but few. The Crapack or Carpathian mountains, separate it from Hungary on the south. The soil is very fruitful both in corn and pasturage, hemp, and flax. Such is the luxuriance of the pastures in Podolia, that it is said one can hardly see the cat∣tle that are grazing in the meadows. Vast quan∣tities of corn are yearly sent down the Vistula to Dantzic, from all parts of Poland, and bought up chiefly by the Dutch. The eastern part of the country is full of woods, forests, lakes, marshes, and rivers, of the last of which, the most consi∣derable in Poland are, the Vistula, Nieper, Nies∣ter, Duna, Bog, Warta, and Memel. The me∣tals found in this kingdom are iron and lead, with some tin, gold, and silver; but there are no mines of the two last wrought at present. The other products of Poland are most sorts of pre∣cious stones, oker of all kinds, fine rock-chrystal, Muscovy glass, talc, alum, saltpetre, amber, pit∣coal, quick-silver, spar, sal-gem, lapis calaminaris, and vitriol. In Lesser Poland are salt-mines, which are the chief riches of the country, and bring most money into the exchequer. In the woods, which consist mostly of oak, beech, pine, and fir-trees, besides the more common wild beasts, are elks, wild asses, wild oxen, or uri, lynxes, wild horses, wild sheep with one horn, bisons, hyaenas, wild goats, and buffaloes. In the meadows and fenny ground is gathered a kind of manna; and the kermes-berries produced in this country are used both in dying and medicine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PREROGATIVES of the NOBILITY.</HEAD>
<P>The inhabitants consist of nobles, citizens, and peasants. The first possess great privileges which they
<PB N="46" REF="480"/>
enjoy partly by the indulgence of their kings, and partly by antient custom and prescription. Some of them have the title of prince, count, or baron, but no superiority or pre-eminence on that account over the rest, which is only to be obtained by some public post or dignity. They have the power of life and death over their vassals; pay no taxes; are subject to none but the king; have a right to all mines and salt-works on their estates; to all offices and employments, civil, military, and ec∣clesiastic; cannot be cited or tried out of the kingdom; may chuse whom they will for their king, and lay him under what restraints they please by the Pacta Conventa; and none but they and the burghers of some particular towns can pur∣chase lands. In short, they are almost entirely in∣dependent, enjoying many other privileges and prerogatives besides those we have specified; but if they engage in trade they forfeit their nobi∣lity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE and STATE of LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The Polish tongue is a dialect of the Sclavonic: it is neither copious nor harmonious. Many of the words have not a single vowel in them; but the High Dutch and Latin are understood and spoken pretty commonly, tho' incorrectly. The language in Lithuania differs much from that of the other provinces. True learning and the study of the arts and sciences have been little at∣tended to in Poland, till of late they began to be regarded with a more favourable eye; and to be not only patronized, but cultivated by several of the nobles and others, both laymen and ecclesias∣tics.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="47" REF="490"/>
<HEAD>CLERGY and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>There are two archbishops in the kingdom, viz. those of Gnesna and Leopol, and about a dozen bishops. The archbishop of Gnesna is always a cardinal, and primate of the kingdom, of which, during an interregnum, and in the king's absence, he is also regent. The prevailing religion is po∣pery; but there are great numbers of Lutherans, Calvinists, Greeks, who are called Dissidents, and by the laws of the kingdom were intitled to tole∣ration; but were much oppressed till very lately, that by the powerful intercession of the empress of Russia, and the protestant powers, they have obtained a confirmation of all their religious rights, with additional privileges, under the guaranty of the said powers. In consequence, however, of the confederacies that have been formed by the male-content party, who opposed the elevation of count Poniatowski to the throne, and the resolutions of the last diet in regard to the Dissidents, the king∣dom is now a scene of anarchy, bloodshed, and confusion. These calamities are, in a great mea∣sure, owing to the persecuting intolerant spirit of the popish clergy, joined to the bigotry of their blind deluded followers, who plunder and destroy all who are not of their party, especially the Dissi∣dents. These confederates have also prevailed up∣on the Turks to declare war against the Russians; so that there is no likelihood that the troubles and calamities of this unhappy kingdom will soon be at an end. The Jews are indulged with great privileges, and are very numerous in Poland; and in Lithuania, it is said, there are a multitude of Mahometan Tartars. We may judge of the num∣bers of Jews in this country by the produce of
<PB N="48" REF="500"/>
their annual poll-tax, which amounts to near fifty∣seven thousand rixdollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>There are few or no manufactures in the king∣dom, if we except some linen and woollen cloths and hardwares; and the whole trade is confined to the city of Dantzic, and other towns on the Vistula or Baltic.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY and CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Poland, like most other countries, was origi∣nally divided into many small states or principali∣ties; but since the year 1309, it has been subject to one sovereign. Miecislaus I. who ascended the throne in the year 964, and was the most conside∣rable of the Polish princes at that time, became a convert to christianity, and prevailed on many of his subjects and vassals to follow his example. In 1386, Jagello, great duke of Lithuania, em∣braced Christianity, and afterwards married Hed∣wig, queen of Poland, whereby the great duchy was added to the Polish dominions. The kings of Poland were antiently hereditary and absolute; but afterwards became elective and limited, as we find them at this day. In the reign of Lewis, towards the end of the fourteenth century, several limitations were laid on the royal prerogative. In
<PB N="49" REF="510"/>
that of Casimir IV. who ascended the throne in 1446, representatives from the several palatinates were first called to the diet, the legislative power, till then, having been lodged in the states, and the executive in the king and senate. On the de∣cease of Sigismund Augustus, it was enacted by law, "That the choice of a king for the future should perpetually remain free and open to all the nobles of the kingdom;" which law has according∣ly been hitherto observed. The king, in conse∣quence, is elected by the clergy and gentry in the plains of Warsaw, and after his election is obliged to sign an instrument, by which his power is cir∣cumscribed within very narrow bounds; so that he is only a sort of president of the senate, which, in his absence, can meet and consult without him. The diets are either ordinary or extraordinary. The former meet every second year, the latter upon extraordinary occasions, when summoned by the king. They sit but six weeks, and one dissent∣ing voice prevents their passing any laws, or coming to any resolution on what is proposed to them from the throne. The senate is composed of the primate, the archbishop of Llemberg, fifteen bishops, fifteen palatines and castellans, and one hundred and thirty laymen, consisting of the great officers of state, the palatines, and castellans. Be∣sides these officers, who are members of the senate, there are the starostas, who are a sort of governors and judges of their respective starosties or districts; but some of them have no jurisdiction. The pala∣tines and castellans, besides being senators, are also a sort of lord-lieutenants and deputy-lieutenants in their respective palatinates. There are not only general diets, but also provincial diets, or dietines, held previous to the general diets. When the no∣bility enter into an association, either during an interregnum, or while the king is living, it is
<PB N="50" REF="520"/>
called a confederacy. Every third diet is held at Grodno, in Lithuania. Among the king's royal prerogatives the chief is, that he has the disposal of most of the dignities, offices, and the royal demesnes: but none of the officers are account∣able to him, nor can they be displaced by him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The king's revenue, which amounts to about one hundred and forty thousand pounds, is all clear to himself, for he pays no troops, not even his own guards; but all the forces are paid by the republic, as well as the officers of state. The public revenues arise chiefly from the crown-lands, the salt-mines in the palatinate of Cracow, antient tolls and customs, particularly those of Elbing and Dantzic, the rents of Marienburg, Dirshau, and Rogenhus, and of the government of Cracow and district of Niepoliomicz.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORDER of KNIGHTHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>The order of the White Eagle was instituted by Augustus II. in the year 1705. Its ensign is a cross of gold enamelled with red, and appendant to a blue ribbon. The motto, Profide, rege et lege.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The standing forces of Poland are divided into the crown-army and that of Lithuania, consisting of horse and foot, and amounting to between twenty and thirty thousand men. These troops are mostly cantoned on the crown-lands, and in Po∣land are paid by a capitation or poll-tax; but in Lithuania other taxes are levied for this purpose.
<PB N="51" REF="530"/>
Most of the foot are Germans. On any sudden and imminent danger, the whole body of the no∣bility, with their vassals, are obliged to appear in the field on horseback, and the cities and towns furnish a certain number of foot soldiers, with car∣riages, and military flores; but for want of proper arms, provisions, subordination, and dis∣cipline, and by being at liberty after a few weeks to return home, this body has proved but of little advantage to the republic. Dantzic is the only place in the Polish dominions that deserves the name of a fortress. Foreign auxiliaries are not to be brought into the kingdom, nor the national troops to march out of it, without the consent of the states.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PERSONS, HABITS, and CHARACTER of the POLES.</HEAD>
<P>The Poles are personable men, and have good complexions. They are esteemed a brave, honest people, without dissimulation, and exceeding hos∣pitable. They cloath themselves in furs in winter, and over all they throw a short cloak. No people keep grander equipages than the gentry. They look upon themselves as so many sovereign princes, have their guards, bands of musie, and keep open houses; but the lower sort of people are poor ab∣ject wretches, in the lowest state of slavery. The exercises of the gentry are hunting, riding, dancing, vaulting, &amp;c. They reside mostly upon their estates in the country, and maintain themselves and fa∣milies by agriculture, breeding of bees, and grazing.</P>
<P>As to the curiosities and antiquities of Poland, we shall take notice of the principal of them in our description of the places in or near which they are found.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="540"/>
We now proceed to a more particular descrip∣tion of Poland and Lithuania.</P>
<P>Both Poland and Lithuania are divided into pro∣vinces, and those again into palatinates. In our particular description therefore we shall give a short account of the principal places in each pala∣tinate of the two grand divisions, beginning with those of Great Poland, which, in a large sense, comprehends Great Poland properly so called, Cu∣javia, Masovia, and Polish Prussia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PROVINCE of GREAT POLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, properly so called, contains five palatinates, viz. Posnania, Kalish, Siradea, Lic∣zyza, or Lenczicz, and Rawa.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>PALATINATE of POSNANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Posen, a handsome, but not very large city, on the river Warta, one hundred and thirty-five miles south of Dantzic, and one hundred and forty-three west of Warsaw, is thought to be inferior to no city in Poland, except Cracow. It is the see of a bishop suffragan of Gnesna, and is defended by a double wall, a deep moat, and a castle, which stands on an island in the Warta. The principal structures are the cathedral and other churches, the convents, the bishop's palace, the academy, or gymnasium, the Jesuits-college and town-house. The suburbs are pretty large. There are three great fairs kept in this city much resort∣ed to by the German traders. Most of the inha∣bitants are papists, intermingled with a conside∣rable number of Jews, who have great privileges here as well as in the rest of Poland. The burgh∣ers of this city enjoy considerable immunities.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="550"/>
Fraustadt, in the Polish language Ushowa, is a handsome town on the borders of Silesia. It has great privileges, and most of the inhabitants are Germans and Lutherans. The trade carried on here in cattle and wool is considerable. Near this town the Swedes obtained a great victory over the Saxons in 1706.</P>
<P>Lissa, by the Poles called Lezno, stands about ten miles from the former. It is a handsome po∣pulous town, and a great part of the inhabitants are protestants, who carry on a good trade.</P>
<P>Ravitz, a small but regular built town, inha∣bited mostly by German protestants. A conside∣rable trade is carried on in cloth, which is the chief manufacture of the place.</P>

<HEAD>PALATINATE of KALISH.</HEAD>
<P>Kalish, which gives name to this palatinate, is a large town on the river Prosna, twenty miles east of Silesia, and one hundred and thirty-three west of Warsaw and north-west of Cracow. It is the residence of a palatine and a castellan, contains a fine Jesuits-college, and is surrounded by a brick wall and towers.</P>

who is primate of all Poland, perpetual legate o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the holy-see, first senator and first prince of the kingdom. He has his marshal, cross-bearer, and chancellor, crowns the king and queen, and in the king's absence, or during the vacancy of the throne, is regent till a new king is chosen. His marshal is a senator, and carries a staff before him, with which he salutes none but the king. He visits no ambassadors, tho' they visit him. He can reverse all the proceedings in any of the bishops courts, and it is death to draw a sword in his pre∣sence. A golden cross is carried before him when he goes to the diet, or the king; and when he sits his chaplain holds it behind him. During the in∣ter-regnum, the revenues of the crown belong to him, and he may coin money in his own name. When he sits down to table, there are al∣ways drums beating and trumpets sounding, both within and without. The gates of the cathedral are of Corinthian brass. It contains a vast treasure of rich vestments, and vessels of gold and silver. The canons must all be of noble birth.</P>

<P>Kruszwica is a small town on the lake of Goplo, in which a castellan resides, and a court of judica∣ture is held. The famous king Piast, from whom all the kings, and even candidates for the crown, who are natives of Poland, are called Piasts, was at first a burgher of it. Its castle stands on an island in the lake, and its collegiate church in the suburbs.</P>

<P>Warsaw, the capital of the palatinate and province, and indeed of the whole kingdom, stands on the Vistula, almost in the centre of the kingdom, and in 52°. 14′. north latitude, and 21°. 37′. east longitude, one hundred and fifty-four miles south-east of Dantzic, one hundred and thirty-three north of Cracow, and three hundred north of Vienna. Here the king usually keeps his court in a large square palace, standing amidst de∣licate gardens and groves; and at this place are held the general diets, where there is such a con∣course of people, that great numbers of them are obliged to live in tents. The city is large and populous, contains a great many churches, pa∣laces, and convents, both within and without the walls, and is pretty well fortified. Here is also a stately castle, an arsenal, and a curious wooden bridge over the river. Count Zaluski's library, said to contain two hundred thousand volumes, was opened in 1746. The ordinary diets are held at the royal palace; but during the inter∣regnum in a field, not far from the city, near the village of Wola. Goods are brought to the city by the Vistula, and other rivers, and sent from thence to Dantzic. Baron Polnitz, who spent some time in this city, says, he observed the same politeness here as at Paris; that the ladies are amiable, witty, and sprightly, and passionately fond of music and plays. Near this city are two royal palaces, viz. Viasdow, pleasantly situated on the Vistula, and Villanow, where, in 1732,

<P>The only place worth mentioning is the town from which the palatinate derives its name, standing on the Vistula, fifty miles north-west of Warsaw. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan of Gnesna, and the residence of a palatinate, castellan, and starosta. Besides the cathedral, it contains several other churches and monasteries well endowed. The dean, or provost of the chapter, has the title of prince of Sielun, of which district he is a kind of sovereign. The town has a good trade by its river, and is defended by a castle. It is also the seat of the provincial court of judicature, and has also a college of Jesuits.</P>

<HEAD>POLISH PRUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>Polish Prussia, commonly called Royal Prus∣sia, to distinguish it from Ducal Prussia, which is now a kingdom belonging to the king of Prussia, and of which we have already given an account, was formerly a distinct political state, having no other connexion with Poland, except that of a perpetual alliance, and of being under the same sovereign; for when the inhabitants put themselves under the protection of Cassimir IV. in 1466, it was expresly stipulated that Prussia should have nothing to do with the republic of Poland:
<PB N="59" REF="610"/>
but that the king should alone, and personally, or∣der and determine all matters relating to the for∣mer; and to that end should often come among them and hold general diets. This political constitution hath since undergone great altera∣tions, and, excepting some few particular rights and privileges, Prussia is on much the same footing as the other provinces, which are all a sort of dis∣tinct states, having power to make laws, which, however, must not be contrary to the general laws of the republic, enacted by the diet, or ge∣neral assembly of the states. Dantzic and some other towns of Polish Prussia have particular pri∣vileges, and are governed by their respective ma∣gistrates. Prussia is upwards of fifty miles in length; but its breadth varies from forty-eight to eighteen. It is bounded by Pomerania, Poland, Ducal Prussia, and the Vistula. The south part, except about Dantzic, is barren, tho' level and open; but the rest is over-run with mountains, lakes, and woods: the lakes yield plenty of fish; and the woods, honey and wax, game, wild boars, and roe-bucks. There are also some heaths in it of great extent. The inhabitants are a mixture of Poles and Germans. With respect to religion, the protestants were, and still are, very numerous here, tho' no pains have been spared to make them con∣verts to popery, either by persecution and oppres∣sion, or more gentle and alluring methods. The deputies of Prussia assist at the election of the king of Poland, who, after his coronation, takes an oath to maintain the people in their rights and pri∣vileges. The king can determine nothing of mo∣ment without the concurrence of the states, or the senate, which is composed of the bishops of Erm∣land and Culm, the three palatines of Culm, Ma∣rienburg, and Pomerellia, and their respective cas∣tellans, three vice-treasurers, who represent the nobility, and two counsellors from the cities
<PB N="60" REF="620"/>
of Thorn, Elbing, and Dantzic, who are nomi∣nated by the king. The bishops, palatines, and castellans, are also members of the senate of Po∣land, to the general diets of which the nobility and the three large towns send deputies. For∣merly, indeed, the Prussian senate and diets had no connection with the Polish: but in 1569, a part of the senate of Prussia was admitted into that of Poland, and the states of the former were com∣pelled to appear at the general diet of the king∣dom. When a general Prussian diet is summoned, it is held alternately at Marienburg and Graudenz, and previous to it, provincial diets are held in every palatinate. The cities and towns pay two shillings for every bushel of malt which they brew, and every hide of land in the country is rated at a Polish guilder: other taxes are some∣times imposed. The Prussians are not obliged to go upon any military expedition out of the pro∣vince, and the burghers of Thorn have the privi∣lege of purchasing lands. The three principal cities have the privilege of coining gold and silver pieces of various sorts, having the king's head on one side, and their respective arms on the reverse. The tribunal at Peterkau is the last resort for the nobility; but appeals lie from the magistrates of the three great towns above-mentioned to the royal assessorial court. The towns in Prussia are divided into great and small: the great are Dantzic, Thorn, and Elbing; the small compre∣hend all the rest, except such as belong to the two bishops. From them an appeal lies, first, to the starostas, and then to the king.</P>
<P>Polish Prussia consists of four provinces, viz. Little Pomerania, or Pomerellia, Culmerland, or the palatinate of Culm, the prefecture, or palati∣nate of Marienburg, and Emmerland.</P>

<HEAD>PALATINATE of POMERELLIA.</HEAD>
<P>This palatinate had antiently princes of its own; afterwards it belonged to the princes of Great Po∣land; then to the knights of the Teutonic order; and, at last, in the year 1466, it fell under the dominion of the republic of Poland. It has a pa∣latine and four provincial judges, lies mostly in the diocese of Cujavia, and contains five circles and starosties. The most considerable places in it are</P>
<P>Dantzic, or Dantzig, the metropolis, standing on a branch of the Vistula, about four miles above where it falls into the Baltick, one hundred and fifty-four miles north-west of Warsaw, and two hun∣dred and fifty-six north of Cracow, in 54°. 20. north latitude, and 19°. 7′. east longitude. It is hard∣ly credible how often this city has changed masters in the competitions for the crown of Poland, and on other occasions, and what sums have been ex∣torted from it. It is large, populous, and rich, and carries on a vast trade, being the chief mart and magazine of Poland, and one of the greatest granaries in the world; so that whole fleets of ships come hither every year to load with corn alone. It consists of the old and new town, with their suburbs, has a fine harbour, a great number of ships, and many valuable privileges. Among the last are those of coining money, gathering am∣ber, and sending representatives to the general diets of Poland and the Prussian senate. It is well fortified; but being commanded by two hills on the south-west, it cannot stand a long siege. Among the public buildings, St. Mary's church, the town-house, the arsenal, the exchange, the square of St. Dominic, the Jesuits college, and the granaries, are the chief. It is computed that three hundred and sixty-five thousand lasts of Po∣lish
<PB N="62" REF="640"/>
wheat are shipped from hence one year with another. Hither Poland sends its commodities for exportation, and from hence is chiefly supplied with those of other countries. Among the latter are great quantities of herrings, both Scotch and Dutch. The exports and imports consist of a variety of articles, and furnish a vast deal of business and wealth to the city. One half of the port∣customs belongs to the king. But tho' the town be under the protection of Poland, it is governed by its own magistrates in form of a republic. These magistrates determine all criminal causes without appeal, and all civil causes not exceeding one thousand livres. The inhabitants, who are com∣puted at two hundred thousand, are mostly Ger∣mans and Lutherans, with a mixture of Calvinists and papists. The city maintains a constant garri∣son of two hundred soldiers. One of the suburbs is called Scotland; and the Scots have great pri∣vileges, in consideration of their gallant defence of the town under one of the family of Douglas, when it was besieged by the Poles. It is said there are upwards of thirty thousand pedlars of that nation in Poland, who travel some on foot, and some with three, four, or five horses. In king Charles II's time, they were about fifty-three thousand: in that reign, Sir John Denham and Mr. Killigrew were sent to take the number of them, and to tax them by the poll, with the king of Poland's licence, which having obtained, they brought home ten thousand pounds sterling, besides their charges in the journey. Here is a Lutheran college, with seven professors, and one teacher of the Polish language. The library belonging to the city is said to be a very good one. One of the mills on the Radaune, a small river that runs through the city, formerly yielded four thousand three hundred pounds per annum to the state, besides what it
<PB N="63" REF="650"/>
brought the proprietors; but at present its pro∣duce is not so considerable. It has eighteen wheels. Without the city is shewn the place where the Russians bombarded it in the year 1734; and likewise the large tomb, in which a thousand men, who were killed on that occasion, were interred. The jurisdiction and territory of the city are of great extent. At the mouth of the Vistula, which is defended by several forts, is a good harbour be∣longing to Dantizc. Its territory consists mostly of islands formed by the Vistula and Motlau.</P>
<P>Oliva, a convent and village about five miles north-west of Dantzic, on the Baltic, whose monks are of the Cistercian order. Their church is very magnificent, especially the inside of it. The con∣vent was founded in the twelfth century, and is noted for the peace concluded there in the year 1660, between the Poles and Swedes. It has the privilege of gathering amber on the sea∣coast.</P>

<HEAD>CULMERLAND, or the PALATINATE of CULM,</HEAD>
<P>Contains eight starosties, and lies wholly in the diocese of Culm. The principal places in it are</P>
<P>Culm, which gives name to it and the bishopric, stands on the Vistula, one hundred and sixty miles south of Dantzic, and is the capital of the pro∣vince. It is a large city, tho' thinly inhabited. It was formerly a Hanse-town and free; but hath since lost its commerce, is greatly decayed, and sub∣ject to the bishop. The laws antiently prescribed for the government of this town are still much esteemed and respected all over Prussia. It con∣tains two monasteries and a nunnery. The bishop resides at Culmensee, a small town about five miles from hence.</P>
<P>Thorn, the most antient city in Prussia, and the first in rank of the three great towns, stands on the Vistula, eighty-four miles from Dantzic, and ninety-three north-west from Warsaw. It is said to be the handsomest and best built town in all Prussia, the streets being much broader, and the houses statelier than at Dantzic. Its name is sup∣posed to be derived from the German word Thor, signifying a door or gate, because the Teutonic knights, by building it, opened to themselves a door into Prussia. This supposition seems the more probable from the device on the city seal, which is a gate thrown open. In the year 1454 this city, in conjunction with the rest of Polish Prussia, threw off the oppressive yoke of the Teutonic knights, and put itself under the pro∣tection of Poland, on condition, that it should enjoy its antient rights and privileges, which are still equal, and even superior to those of Dantzic. In particular, it has the right of coining money, of chusing its magistrates, of determining both
<PB N="65" REF="670"/>
civil and criminal causes, the last without appeal, of sending representatives to the general diets, and of purchasing fiefs and estates, which last pri∣vilege otherwise belongs to the nobility alone, and many others. Notwithstanding, it is now greatly declined from its former prosperity, and its trade is at a low ebb. The German and Polish languages are said to be spoken here in the greatest purity. The territory of the city is of considerable extent. At a village about six miles from the city, all persons who come to it may drink as much beer as they please, gratis. The town is defended by a double wall and moats. The wooden-bridge over the Vistula here is said to be the longest and the most expensive in Europe, half an hour being required to walk from one end of it to the other, and one third of it being every year carried off by the rapidity of the current and the shoals of ice; for the piles being driven into a quick-sand, it is not capable of resisting any violent shock. It con∣sists properly of two bridges, the island Bazar di∣viding it in the middle. The stadthouse is reckon∣ed the stateliest in Europe next to that of Am∣sterdam. Great quantities of soap and ginger∣bread are made here and exported. The aspara∣gus that grows wild hereabouts, is not inferior to that which is cultivated elsewhere. The famous astronomer Copernicus was born here in 1472, and died in 1543 at Frauenburg. The town-gar∣rison consists of only one company. The Luthe∣ran college has five professors, with a teacher of the Polish language, a fine library, and printing∣house. The tumult occasioned by a popish procession in the year 1724, and the horrible exe∣cutions and proceedings in consequence thereof, at the instigation of those execrable villains the Je∣suits, and the false depositions of their partizans, are too well known to be here insisted on. The
<PB N="66" REF="680"/>
inhabitants are mostly Lutherans, with a mixture of Papists, Calvinists, and Jews. The leaning tower in this town is much admired; for though the outside is built obliquely from the ground, so that it seems ready to fall, yet the floors and ciel∣ings within are perfectly horizontal, and the walls perpendicular to the horizon. In the university library two of Cicero's epistles are said to be pre∣served on wax.</P>

<HEAD>PALATINATE of MARIENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This palatinate contains three werders, or islands, formed by rivers, which produce plenty of corn and grass, and breed great numbers of cattle. The air is pretty good, and the inhabitants, who are mostly Lutherans and papists, enjoy considerable privileges. The woods, which harbour fierce wolves, being but few, the common fuel is turf, straw, or stubble. The principal places belonging to this district are</P>
<P>Marienburg, which gives name to it, and is a well built town on the Nogat, a branch of the Vis∣tula, over which there is a great wooden bridge. It is eighteen miles south-west of Elbing, twenty-five south-east of Dantzic, and seventy-two north of Thorn. The inhabitants are mostly Roman catholics. It was formerly the chief city of the Teutonic knights, and the residence of their grand∣master. In the castle are kept the revenues of
<PB N="67" REF="690"/>

<P>Elbing, on a river of the same name, which comes from the lake Drausen, and falls here into the Frische-Haff, is thirty-five miles from Dantzic, eighteen from Marienburg, and one hundred and thirty-three from Warsaw. It is a large handsome city, the metropolis of the palatinate, and a place of considerable trade. The streets are narrow, and the houses and fortifications old fashioned. The church of St. Nicholas is said to be the largest and handsomest in all Prussia. Its principal commerce is in sturgeon, butter, cheese, and corn. The inhabitants are a mixture of Luthe∣rans, Papists, and Calvinists. Some companies of the crown-army of Poland are quartered here; but the burghers keep guard at the gates, and in the suburbs is a detachment of Prussians. It was formerly a Hanse-town, and is now the second of the three great Prussian cities. It lies in the dio∣cese of Ermland; but in civil affairs is subject to the king only.</P>

of the Vistula and Redawa, one hundred and twenty-seven miles from Breslaw, one hundred and thirty five south-west from Warsaw, one hundred and seventy-three north from Buda, one hundred and eighty-five north-east from Vienna, two hun∣dred and fifty south from the Baltic, six hundred and eighty north-west of Constantinople, and seven hundred and twenty west of Moscow, in 50°. 8′ north latitude, and 20°. 16′ east longitude. It is very populous, and the largest and best built town in Poland. The castle contains the king's pa∣lace, the cathedral, with some other churches and dwelling-houses, and is defended by walls, towers, and bastions. It is so large, that it has the appearance of a town. This being the place of the king's coronation, the regalia are kept in the cathedral, and there also the kings are interred. The bishop of Cracow is the first in the kingdom, duke of Saveria, and often a cardinal. His re∣venues are larger than those of his metropolitan the archbishop of Gnesna, and amount to about forty thousand dollars per annum. The cathedral is de∣dicated to St. Stanislaus, who was formerly bishop of this see, and was murdered by Boleslaus II. at the altar, because he took the liberty to admonish and reprove him; for which reason the king and nobles walk in procession to his shrine the day be∣fore the coronation, with a view to expiate the crime, and often make very costly offerings. Masses are said without intermission, day and night, in the church. On the other side the river close to the bridge is the Casimercz, which is a fort and suburb to Cracow, and contains the university, consisting of eleven colleges, to which the gram∣mar schools of the city are subordinate. The in∣habitants of this city have the liberty of purchasing estates, and a voice in choosing the king; as have also Warsaw, Posnau, Vilna, Lemberg, Thorn,
<PB N="70" REF="730"/>
Elbing, and Dantzic; at least all these have the latter privilege; and Cracow, Vilna, Lemberg, and Lublin the former, besides many more common to them all. There are two other suburbs of Cracow, called Kleparz and Stradomo. No appeal lies from the city-council but to the king. The city is much declined from what it was formerly, and its trade is now inconsiderable; yet it is full of gentry, and a wealthy clergy, and the seat also of the supreme court of judicature, the palatine, and castellan. The number of the religious houses in the town and suburbs are very great. In the neigh∣bourhood are salt-mines, which yield a great re∣venue, and contain salt of four different sorts. Near the town also on the Vistula stands the Bene∣dictine convent of Tineeck, one of the chief in Poland; for to it belong five towns, and one hun∣dred villages. The salt mines and works are said to employ about seven hundred men, and to yield about six hundred thousand quintals of salt annu∣ally. The subterraneous passages and galleries are very spacious. In many of them altars, chapels, and chambers have been hewn out of the rock; in others there are warehouses and stables. In some places huge columns have been left standing to support the rock. These mines belong to the king, and are generally farmed. The nobility of Great and Little Poland are allowed a certain quantity of salt for their families for about a third of what it costs the king. The mines have more than once taken fire, and continued burning a long time.</P>

<HEAD>LITHUANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS extensive country was united to the republic of Poland in the year 1501. It is called by the natives Letwa, and has Great Po∣land and Russia on the west; part of Muscovy on the east; Livonia, the Baltic sea, and part of Muscovy on the north; Red Russia, Volhinia, and Podolia on the south; and the Ukraine on the south-east. Its length is said to be about three hundred and sixty, and its breadth three hundred
<PB N="77" REF="800"/>
and forty miles; but it is much indented both ways. Lithuania was antiently over-run with wood, and there are still many forests in it, which yield a great deal of honey, wax, pitch, tar, and timber; and abound with wild boars, buffaloes, elks, wild horses, wild asses, uri, and woodcocks. The lakes also are numerous and well stored with fish: but the air, by reason of these forests and lakes, is said to be thick and foggy. The country produces a great deal of buck-wheat and other corn, the pastures are luxuriant, and the flocks and herds numerous: so that, nothwithstanding agriculture is much neglected, provisions are exceeding cheap, but money so scarce, that ten per cent is the com∣mon interest. The principal nobility have large estates, and live in great pomp and splendor, ge∣nerally retaining some hundreds of those that are poor, in quality of domestics. The established religion is popery; but Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews, Turks, Greeks, and Socinians are very humerous. Lithuania was governed by its own dukes till it was united to Poland, towards the end of the fourteenth century, when the great duke Jagello married Hedwig, the dowager of Lewis, king of Poland and Hungary. It had even dukes after that, but they were subordinate to the king; and at this day, though one diet serves for both countries, yet each has its peculiar laws, customs, dialect, and privileges. In a diet held at Lublin in 1569, it was more closely united to Poland than it had been before, and it was enacted, that both countries, for the future, should form but one state under the same prince. As to their courts of justice, the tenth part of what is ad∣judged in all real actions goes always to the judge's box, and is immediately paid in court; and inper∣sonal actions he claims half the damages given. A no∣bleman is only fined for murder, as in Poland. The
<PB N="78" REF="810"/>
common people here, excepting the burghers in the royal towns, and the Germans, are slaves, and, in many places, the ignorant vulgar still retain some remains of idolatry. The poor people have only Mondays to themselves; and if their lords have occasion for them even on that day, the peasant must work for himself on Sunday. If any of them is condemned to death by his lord, he must execute himself, or suffer greater cruelty. The dialect is a language of the Sclavonic, and they speak here, as in Poland, a barbarous kind of Latin. Lithua∣nia is divided into nine palatinates. Another di∣vision is into Lithuania, properly so called, and Li∣thuanian Russia. Some also comprehend under it Samogitia and Courland, which is a fief of Po∣land.</P>
<P>Lithuania, properly so called, contains the pa∣latinates of Wilno and Trockie. In that of Wil∣no the principal places are</P>
<P>Wilno, or Vina, which gives name to it, and is the capital both of it and the great dutchy. It is very large, and stands seventy miles from Grod∣no, one hundred from Mittaw, one hundred and fifty-two from Koningsberg, one hundred and thirty-one from Riga, two hundred and seventeen from Warsaw, and two hundred and thirty-five from Dantzic. Here is a castle, a ruinous royal palace, an arsenal, and upwards of thirty popish churches, besides a Greek, a Lutheran, a Calvi∣nist, and a Tartarean church, with a Jewish syna∣gogue. A dreadful fire happened here in 1748, destroying a great part of the town, since which it has not yet recovered its former grandeur. This and other fires would not have been so fatal, if a great part of the city had not been built of wood, as is the case of most towns both in Poland and Li∣thuania. It is the see of a bishop, and has a Je∣suits college, in which the sciences are taught by
<PB N="79" REF="820"/>
several professors. A high-court of judicature, a provincial diet, and court of justice, are held in this city. The magistrates are ennobled by their office, so that their children can purchase estates. The inhabitants are a mixture of Poles, Russians, Germans, Tartars, Lithuanians, Jews, Turks, and other nations. The suburbs are as big as the town, and full of the like timber cottages, consist∣ing of one room, common to the family and their cattle. The trade of the place is chiefly carried on by foreigners. The houses of the poor people are so smoaky, and they eat so much garlic and onions, that half of them are blind before they grow old. If a foreigner is murdered by a native, the latter, it is said, pays only a fine. The lon∣gitude of this city is 25°.38′. east, and the lati∣tude 54°.46′. north.</P>
<P>Braslaw, a large town near a lake, contains a Greek abbey, is the seat of a provincial diet, and gives name to a district.</P>

Every third year a general diet is held at this place. None of the streets are paved, except two or three. In 1753 almost the whole town was consumed by fire.

<P>IS a duchy which antiently belonged to Lithua∣nia. There are a great many mountains, woods,

lakes, and rivers in it. The woods swarm with bees, and there are some good corn and pasture lands in the duchy; which also gives title to a bishop, and has an upper starosta, or palatine, and a castellan. It contains a great many small towns, but none of them worth mentioning, except Wor∣nic, or Miedniki, where the bishop resides; and Rosenie on the river Dubista, where the provin∣cial diet and court of judicature are held. The pea∣sants are said to be very rude and boorish; and in the deserts to be still strangers to Christianity, and little better than savages. Instead of bread, it is said, they use green turnips, which grow wild with∣out sowing. They live to so great an age, that it is no rarity to see persons a hundred, or an hundred and twenty years old. They have generally but one room for themselves and cattle.</P>

<HEAD>COURLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS duchy, which by the natives is called Kur, or Cur-semme, i. e. a trace of land pro∣jecting into the sea, is bounded on the south by Sa∣mogitia; on the north by the gulph of Riga and Livonia; on the west by the Baltic; and on the east by Lithuania, properly so called. It is about two hundred miles in length; but the breadth is very unequal, being in some places eighty, in others forty, and in others still less. As to the soil, a great part of the country consists of woods and swamps; but when drained, it is very fruitful, yielding plenty of grain, flax, and pasture. It is also well supplied with fish, iron-ore, minerals, quarries of stone, chalk, stucco, timber, and mi∣neral springs. Here also, on the coast of the Baltic, amber is found. What the inhabitants can spare
<PB N="84" REF="870"/>
of these and other commodities are carried to Riga, Libau, Windaw, and Memel, to be transported beyond sea. They have cattle and horses in abund∣ance, and one of their methods of husbandry is to let the water remain upon a piece of low ground for two or three years, and then to drain it, when it is become so soft and fat, that it requires but an easy plowing, and bears good crops for three years after which it is again laid under water. With regard to religion, the two principal sects are the Lutherans and Papists; the others are Calvinists Greeks, and Jews, who are also tolerated, but ex∣cluded from all public employments: as to Arians Socinians, Arminians, and Anabaptists, they are not allowed to settle in the duchy. The inhabi∣tants are mostly composed of Germans and Lat∣tonians, or Livonians, the latter being a sort o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slaves to the former. The nobility have great pri∣vileges, especially the old; for they are distin∣guished into the old and new, of which the former only are capable of the employments of the state but neither have a seat in the diets of Poland. They have an unlimited power over their wretched vas∣sals, which extends even to life and death. The duke is patron of some of the churches, and the nobility of others. When the defence of the country requires it, the nobility are obliged to ap∣pear on horseback under the duke, but not to march beyond the frontiers. They are extremely jealous of and watchful over their privileges Courland being a fief of Poland, when a new king of that country is elected, he is obliged to send an envoy for investiture. He has all the regalia allowed to sovereign princes of Germany; coins money in his own name, and has sovereign jurisdiction; but in some extraordinary cases, the nobility may ap∣peal to the court of Poland. He keeps a court with all the state officers as other princes, and with
<PB N="85" REF="880"/>
his nobility is able to raise eighteen thousand men. He summons a diet of the states as-often as occasion requires; upon which they elect deputies, and send them instructions to the diet at Mittaw. In 1558, Ketler, the last great master of the Teutonic knights in Livonia, was made hereditary duke of Courland by the king of Poland, on con∣dition of his quitting Riga and Livonia, and hold∣ing the duchy in fee of that crown. His descend∣ants continued in possession of it till 1737, when Ferdinand, the last of that family dying, Courland chose the count Ernest Biron, a native, and cham∣berlain to her czarish majesty Anne Iwanowna, who was afterwards invested by the king of Poland; but in 1740 he was banished with all his family to Sibe∣ria, where he continued till lately, when he was re∣stored by the present czarina. During the banish∣ment of the duke, the revenues, which arise chiefly from demesnes, were entirely in the hands of the Russians. These demesnes are so large, that it is said they make above a third part of the whole duchy; so that the duke, if he is disposed, may amass great wealth, or keep a very handsome court. The ordinary judges here are the four cap∣tains, superintendents, or bailiffs, two for Courland, and two for Semigallia. From these an appeal lies to the high council, in which the duke sits in person; and from thence, if the sum contested is above six hundred florins, to the king of Poland. The criminal causes of the nobility are also tried by the high-council; but an appeal to the king in some cases lies also in regard to these. Disputes be∣tween the duke and the nobility are decided only by the king in person. The towns are generally under the jurisdiction of their own magistrates. Every two years a diet is held at Mittaw, to which every parish sends representatives. The duchy is divided into three parts, viz. Courland, properly
<PB N="86" REF="890"/>
so called, Semigallia, and the district of Pilten. In the first of these the principal places are</P>
<P>Goldingen, a small town, with a castle on the river Windaw, in which the dukes sometimes reside. Near it is an iron-work and copper flatting mill.</P>
<P>Windaw, a considerable town with a good har∣bour at the mouth of a river of the same name, a hundred and ten miles west of Mittaw, has some trade in pitch, tar, wax, &amp;c. but is much declined from its former prosperity, when the Li∣vonian grand-master resided, and the states of Cour∣land assembled here.</P>
<P>Libau, a timber-built town, forty-two miles north of Memel. It has a good road and harbour, and the greatest trade of any place in the country. Here the duke's ships are usually built, and a court of admiralty held. In the neighbourhood is a fresh∣water lake. Here it is said above an hundred and fifty ships in a year load with hemp, linseed, and naval stores.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SECOND DIVISION, or SEMIGALLIA.</HEAD>
<P>The most considerable places are Mittau, the capital of the whole duchy, the seat of its diets, and the residence of the duke. It stands on the river Aa, thirty-two miles south of Riga, and above two hundred and ninety north of Warsaw. It is pretty large; but neither well built, fortified, nor inhabited. Here a magnificent palace was be∣gun by duke Ernest John; but upon his banish∣ment the building was discontinued, which, it is probable, hath been resumed since he recovered his liberty. Under it, in a vault, are deposited the remains of many of the dukes in coffins of fine copper, curiously decorated. In the town are ma∣ny gardens and open places, together with two Lu∣theran,
<PB N="87" REF="900"/>
one Calvinist, and one popish church. The longitude of it is 25° 23′ east, and the latitude 56° 26′ north.</P>
<P>Scelburg, a small town and castle on the river Duina, which was the see of the bishop of Semi∣migallia, before the archbishopric of Riga was founded.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The THIRD DIVISION, or District of PILTEN,</HEAD>
<P>Lies in Courland, properly so called, and was antiently called the diocese of Courland. It takes its name from an old castle, near which is a small town on the river Windaw. The bishop of Sa∣mogitia stiles himself now also bishop of Pilten.</P>
<P>There is another small town called Hasen∣poth, and a promontory called Domesness, on which are two beacons, wherein a large fire is kept burning all night, from the first of August to the first of January.

<DIV2>
<HEAD>TURKEY in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Turks are of a Scythian or Tartarian original, having been antiently seated be∣twixt the Black and Caspian seas. The ap∣pellation of Turk, which signifies sublime and pre-eminent, was first given them in the mid∣dle ages as a proper name. They were little known till the eighth century, when they made inroads up∣on Georgia, and plundered that country. In the year 844, they penetrated as far as Armenia Major, where they fixed themselves, and from them that country obtained the name of Turcomania. About the year 1000, the sultan of Persia, who at that time was hard pressed by the caliph of Babylon on one side, and the Indians on the other, invited them into his service, and, by their assistance, en∣tirely defeated his enemies: but Tangrolipix, who commanded the Turks, not having been re∣warded, as he expected, there arose such a misun∣derstanding between these new allies, that it occa∣sioned
<PB REF="920"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD><HI>An Accurate Map of</HI> TURKEY in EUROPE with HUNGARY, TRANSILVANIA and LITTLE TARTARY</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="89" REF="930"/>
a war, wherein Tangrolipix defeated Ma∣homet, the Persian sultan, killed him in the field, and thereby became sultan of Persia. The Turks, when they came into Persia, were Pagans; but by conversing so long with the Saracens, many of them were now become Mahometans; and Tan∣grolipix, upon his accession to the Persian throne, professed himself a Mahometan, probably to en∣gage his new subjects the more readily to submit to his government. He afterwards marched a∣gainst the caliph of Babylon, whom he defeated: but attempting the conquest of Arabia, he did not meet with the like success; whereupon he turned his arms towards Natolia or the Lesser Asia, and made a considerable progress in the conquest of that county. Another swarm or hord of Tartars breaking into Lesser Asia, under shah Solyman, dis∣possessed the former of a great part of it. Otho∣man grandson of Solomon, from whom the Turkish empire derives the name of Othoman, added greatly to the conquests of his grandfather, and first took the title of emperor. From him the present grand signior deduces his pedigree. His successors, with a few checks and interruptions, continued conquering, till they extended the empire to its present limits.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the CONSTITUTION and GOVERNMENT of the Turkish EMPIRE, and the SERAGLIO.</HEAD>
<P>The grand signior, or emperor of the Turks, is re∣strained by no laws or compacts, the government being purely monarchical: but if the emperor indul∣ges not the humours of the people, and especially of the mutinous Janizaries, he is in danger not only of being deposed, but also of being put to death. Those who have offices under the govern∣ment he squeezes, disgraces, and puts to death, upon the least suggestion of their disaffection, or
<PB N="90" REF="940"/>
misconduct, without giving them an opportunity of answering for themselves, they being looked upon as more immediately his slaves: but others seem to enjoy almost as great a degree of security both in their persons and properties, as the subjects of other absolute monarchies. Indeed in all such there is a gradation of governors and officers, of which the higher fleece and oppress those below them, and the lowest make reprisals upon the common people. In the succession to the empire, no regard is paid to age or birth-right, the Turks thinking it sufficient, if in their elections, they keep to the Othoman family. Women are excluded from the throne. The emperors council is either ordinary or extraordinary. The first, meeting every Sunday and Thursday, consists of the great officers of state, and is called the Galibe Divani. To the other, which is called Ajack Divani, are summon∣ed all the great persons and officers of the empire, and even the oldest and most experienced soldiers. The sultan hears what passes from an adjoining chamber. At the head of the ministry is the grand vizir, who is, as it were, his lieutenant-ge∣neral, with whom he divides, or rather to whom he leaves the care of the whole empire, he being entrusted not only with the finances, with foreign affairs, and the administration of justice in civil and criminal matters, but also with the conduct of the war, and the command of the armies. Great and dangerous as this charge is, there have been men who have executed it with safety and success, both in peace and war, and have died quietly in their beds; but that is not the case with most of them, it being the usual policy of the emperors to shelter themselves from the clamours of the people, by throwing the whole blame of any male-administration upon him, and giving him up to the public resentment. His income, without
<PB N="91" REF="950"/>
any breach of probity, may amount to 600,000 dollars, exclusive of presents and other perquisites. Notwithstanding his high dignity, his palace is open to every one, and he gives audience to the meanest of the poor. When the sultan names a grand vizir, he puts into his hand the seal of the empire, and when he honours him with the com∣mand of an army, he takes out one of the plumes of his own turban at the head of the troops, and delivers it to him, to place it in his own. The other great officers of state are the kaimakan, or vizir's deputy, not to be confounded with the governor of Constantinople, who is also called kaimakan; the vizirs of the bench, or bassas of three horse-tails, because three horse-tails are car∣ried before them when they march, and who sit in the divan or courts of justice with him; the kadinlasquiers, or chief justices of provinces; the beiglerbegs, or viceroys, of which the chief are those of Romelia, Natolia, and Damascus; the ordinary bassas, or governors of towns and districts under the beiglerbegs; the reis effendi, or lord chancellor and secretary of state; the tef∣terder or high treasurer; the aga of the Janizaries; the aga of the Spahis; the aga of the Siluds, &amp;c. The chief officers of the seraglio are the kislar∣agasi, who is superintendant of the women, and has the command of all the black eunuchs; the capi aga, who has the command of all the white eunuchs, and to whom all petitions to be presented to the prince are delivered. Both these are also eunuchs, and of the same complexion as those of whom they have the command. Besides the wo∣men and eunuchs, there are in the seraglio the ichoglans and azamoglans, mutes, dwarfs, and buffoons. The ichoglans are young men bred up in the seraglio, not only to serve about the prince, but to fill in time the first posts of the empire.
<PB N="92" REF="960"/>
The azamoglans are trained up there for inferior employments.</P>
<P>No children are admitted into the seraglios of Constantinople, Pera, or Adrianople, till they are first reviewed and approved of by the grand signior. They are generally the most beautiful, well made, and sprightly, that can be met with. They are first taught, after being circumcised, silence and a modest humble behaviour. Then they are instruct∣ed in the Mohammedan religion, to speak and write the Turkish language, and afterwards the Persian and Arabic. As they grow up, they are taught manly exercises, and whatever is thought requisite to qualify them for state-employments: but they are seldom preferred out of the seraglio until the age of forty.</P>
<P>The ladies of the haram are a collection of young beautiful virgins, either the presents of go∣vernors, purchased, or captives taken in war; most of them being the children of christian parents. They are taught music, dancing, and other accomplish∣ments, and furnished with the richest cloaths and ornaments. Some of them frequently play and dance before the grand signior, while others divert him with their conversation. They have a great many female slaves to wait on them, but are scarce ever suffered to go abroad, except when the grand signior changes his place of residence; when a troop of black eunuchs convey them to the boats, which are enclosed with lattices: and when they go by land, they are put into close chariots, and signals made at certain distances, to give notice, that none may ap∣proach the road through which they are to pass.</P>

<P>The Turks are generally robust and well∣shaped, of a good mien, and patient of hard∣ships,
<PB N="93" REF="970"/>
which render them fit for war. They shave their heads, but wear their beards long, except the military, and those in the seraglio, who wear only whiskers. They cover their heads with a white linen turban of an enormous size, and never pull it off but when they sleep. None but Turks must presume to wear a white turban. Their breeches, or drawers, are of a piece with their stockings; and they have slippers instead of shoes, which they pull off when they enter a temple or house. They wear shirts, with wide sleeves, not gathered at the wrists, and over them a vest tied with a sash; their upper garment being a loose gown, something shorter than the vest.</P>
<P>The women's dress pretty much resembles that of the men, only they have a stiffened cap with horns, something like a mitre, on their heads, in∣stead of a turban, and wear their hair flowing down. When they go abroad, they are so wrapped up, that their faces cannot be seen.</P>
<P>The Turks sit, eat, and sleep, according to the custom of the East, on sophas or cushions, mattras∣ses, and carpets. Rice is their most general food, and coffee their common drink. Their most usual salutation is to bow the head a little, laying the right hand on their breasts; but to persons of rank, they stoop so low as to touch the border of their vest. The women are kept under a rigorous confine∣ment. They have generally delicate skins, regular features, black hair and eyes, with an admirable chest. Many of them are complete beauties. Their cleanliness is extraordinary; for they bathe twice a week, and suffer not the smallest hair, or the least soil, to be upon their bodies. As to the qualities of their minds, they are said to want neither wit, vivacity, nor tenderness; and to be exceeding amo∣rous. It is no doubt for this reason, that the men
<PB N="94" REF="980"/>
never suffer their wives faces to be seen, not even by the dearest friend they have in the world.</P>
<P>There is no need of much wit to behave one's self well here; for a good mien and gravity supply the place of merit in the East, and much gaiety would spoil all. Not that the Turks want wit; but they speak little, and pride themselves in sincerity and modesty more than eloquence. The Turks use no unneces∣sary words, whereas the Greeks talk incessantly. Though these two nations are born under one cli∣mate, their tempers are more different than if they lived in the most distant countries. The Turks make profession of candour and faithfulness, and are a charitable good-natured people, jealousy ex∣cepted, and very sober. On the other hand, they are extremely proud, insolent, indolent, superstitious, and covetous. They are also much addicted to un∣natural lusts; and despise all other nations in gene∣ral, especially those which are not of their religion. The common appellation that they give christians is that of dogs. An uniformity runs through all the actions of the Turks, and they never change their manner of living. They seem to have no kind of genius for the improvement of the arts and sciences, though they live under the influence of the same heaven, and possess the same countries as the antient Grecians did. They generally loiter away their time, either among the women in the haram, or in smoaking, or taking opium; and though they herd together, you will observe as little conversation among them as amongst so many horses in a stable. They seldom travel, or use any exercise or rural sports; and discover little or no curiosity to be informed of the state of their own, or any other country: but Turkey, after all, is not without men of parts, probity, and honour; nor benevolent, liberal, conversible, and ingenious people. They behave very commendably to their
<PB N="95" REF="990"/>
slaves and servants, and frequently better than the Christians do to theirs. There are no hereditary governments, or titles of nobility in Turkey; and indeed the commonalty there enjoy the greatest liberty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE and LEARNING of the TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>The languages spoken in Turkey in Europe are the Turkish and Tartarian, which have a great affinity to one another; the modern Greek, which differs widely from the antient; the Sclavonian, and Walachian. The Arabic is the language of the learned. Learning is at a very low ebb among the Turks: however, they have some schools, col∣leges, and academies; but they are on a very dif∣ferent footing from those among us. Not many years since, a printing house was set up at Constan∣tinople, where books of all kinds were allowed to be printed, except on matters of religion. The most ingenious musselmen employ themselves in reading the Alcoran and the commentators upon it, to which almost all their learning is confined. Some of them amuse themselves with poetry, in which they are said to succeed very well. Others Turks delight in music, and spend the whole day in playing upon an instrument, without being tired, though they only repeat the same tune. It is said, there are a great many manuscripts in the Turkish, Arabian, and Persian languages, among the Turks; but it is not to be supposed that they contain any very deep, solid, ingenious, or useful learning.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The Turkish regular troops are the Spahis and Timar-spahis, who are light horse. The latter, who have estates in land assigned them, instead
<PB N="96" REF="1000"/>
of pay, are obliged to bring a certain number of slaves into the field with them. The tributary princes of Moldavia and Walachia, and the Crim Tartars, are also obliged to send auxiliaries. But the flower of the Turkish army consists of the Janizaries, who amount to about forty thousand, and are all infantry. They have particular pri∣vileges, being subject to no jurisdiction but that of their aga, or commander. Their pay is three aspers a day, besides victuals, and a suit of cloaths every year. They are all lodged at Constantinople together in a sort of barracks, having been educated in the seraglio, and trained up to the exercise of arms from their infancy. Besides the Janizaries, there is another body of foot, called Capis. The whole Turkish army, regulars and irregulars, amounts to above three hundred thousand men. Besides the true Janizaries, or Janizaries of the Porte, and in actual pay, there are great numbers all over the empire, who procure themselves to be registered in this body, in order to be intitled to their privileges. The bachelors only are capable of bearing offices in the barracks or chambers at Constantinople. When any of the Janizaries are disabled in the service, they have an allowance for life. To distinguish them, they wear a cap of a particular make. The emperor's guards are composed of them, and they are feared and respected every where, though they carry only a cane in their hand; for arms are not delivered to them but when they take the field. The chief commanders of the army are distinguished by two or three horse-tails car∣ried before them. The Turkish navy is not so considerable as might be expected in such ex∣tensive dominions, situated on several seas, and abounding in commodious harbours. By their neg∣lecting navigation and foreign commerce, they can never find sailors to man a great fleet; and those
<PB N="97" REF="1010"/>
they have are unskilful, as well as their pilots and officers. If they would apply themselves to navi∣gation, and make the most of their situation and advantages, they could not fail to become a very formidable maritime power. Their navy generally consists of about forty large ships, exclusive of gal∣lies. In time of war they hire or buy merchant ships, and others are sent them from Algiers, Tu∣nis, and Tripoli. The captain-bassa, or admiral, is the second officer in the empire, the grand-vizir being the only officer above him. His power is absolute, when he is out of the Dardanelles; and not only the sea-officers, but all the governors of the maritime provinces, receive orders from him. The pilots are mostly Greeks, and the captains renegadoes. The captain-bassa sails round the Ar∣chipelago, in summer, to collect the capitation∣tax, and learn the state of affairs in those parts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenues of the empire are paid either into the public treasury, or into the sultan's private treasury. The former, called by the Turks Deitul∣mali Muslimim, i. e. the public money of the Musselmen, is not to be touched but on the most pressing exigency of the state. The other the sultan may dispose of at pleasure. Prince Canti∣mer says, in his time, twenty-seven thousand purses, amounting to thirteen million and a half of crowns, were annually returned to both treasuries; arising from the produce of the customs, demesne lands, the capitation or tax paid by every subject of the empire who is not of the Mahometan religion, the annual tributes paid by the cham of the Crim Tar∣tars, the princes of Moldavia, Walachia, the little republic of Ragusa, and part of Mingrelia; toge∣ther with half a million of money out of a million
<PB N="98" REF="1020"/>
and an half levied annually in Egypt. These are the fixed revenues: but vast sums are also raised by the confiscations of the estates and effects of the bassas and other officers, and from the estates of Turks dying without male-issue.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The manufactures and commodities of Turkey are silks, carpets, goat's hair, wool, camel's-hair, cotton yarn, dimity, burdets, waxed-linen, sha∣green-skins, blue, red, and yellow Morocco-leather, coffee, rhubarb, turpentine, storax, gums, opium, galls, mastic, emery, lemnian-bole, pomegranate∣shells, sponges, dates, almonds, wine, oil, figs, raisins, mother of p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl, boxwood, saffron, &amp;c. These are exported in large quantities by the se∣veral European trading nations, who import their own goods, and purchase those of the country. The inland trade is carried on chiefly by the Jews and Armenians; and even the Turks send mer∣chandise, both by land and water, from one part of the empire to another▪ but not to foreign chris∣tian countries. No nation is more advantageously situated for traffic than the Turkish, having the na∣vigation of the Black-sea, the Levant, and the Red-sea, and consequently greater opportunities of importing the rich merchandizes of the East, and distributing them all over Europe, than any maritime power: but they never attempt distant voyages, and have but few merchant ships, both their imports and exports being chiefly made in foreign bottoms. Tyre, Sidon, and Alexandria, which once commanded the navigation and trade of the world, are in their possession, but make no figure in commerce at this day: and well it is for the Christians that the Turks are such an indolent generation; for their situation and vast extent of
<PB N="99" REF="1030"/>
empire would enable them to monopolize the trade of the world, if they attended to it. Seve∣ral European Christian nations have envoys and residents at Constantinople, and consuls in other ports. In this empire there is a great traffic in the human species, not only male slaves, but beau∣tiful young girls, being publickly bought and sold.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>The gold coins of Turkey are the altines or ducats, and the zechinos. The former are worth about seven shillings and six-pence a-piece, and the latter about nine shillings.</P>
<P>The silver coins are the asper, worth three half∣pence, the para four-pence halfpenny, the grosh about three-pence, the krip about eleven-pence, and the solola about two shillings and two-pence farthing. A purse is equal to one hundred and eight pounds six shillings and eight-pence.</P>
<P>Gold and silver coins of all countries go for their value.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Turks are of the Mahometan religion, the principles of which are: that Mahomet was sent by God, who dictated to him the Coran, by which they are enjoined to believe in God, in his-angels, his scriptures, and prophets, especially the Coran and Mahomet, in the resurrection and day of judg∣ment, and in God's absolute decrees both of good and evil; to observe the prescribed ablutions be∣fore their devotions; to pray at the appointed times with their faces towards Mecca; to give alms; to fast in the month of Ramadan or Ramazan; to go once in pilgrimage to the caaba, or house of God at Mecca, either personally or by proxy; to ab∣stain
<PB N="100" REF="1040"/>
from strong liquor, games of chance, pro∣phesying with arrows, certain foods, as blood, pork, or any beast dying with sickness, killed by a wild beast, a fall, or a stroke; from wor∣shipping idols, usury, and some superstitious and Pagan practices. Polygamy is allowed of, and so are divorces. The Mahomedans are divided into two great sects, viz. Ali and Omar. The Turks are of the latter, and the Persians of the former. Their places of worship are called mosques. The chief ecclesiastic is the mufti, whose office is of great dignity. The Turkish monks are called dervises, and their priests imans. A mola is a sort of archbishop; a cadalisquer, who is also a layman, may be compared to a patriarch; and a cadi to a bishop. Islam signifies the doctrine of Mahomet; and Moslemen, or Moslem, the pro∣fessors thereof. The fast of Ramadan is followed by a season of festivity, called the Beiram. The Christians and Jews residing among the Turks en∣joy full liberty of conscience. It is a mistake that the Mahomedans believe that the women have no souls; or that if they have, they will not be pu∣nished or rewarded in the next life. Mahomet had too great a respect for the fair sex to teach such a doctrine: and there are several passages in the Coran which affirm, that women will be rewarded or punished in the next life according to their be∣haviour in this. Tho' the Mahomedans tolerate all religions, yet they encourage and reward none but the disciples of their own. They allow no churches to be built on new foundations, or the rebuilding of those which are decayed, without extorting an extravagant fine from the poor people for the liberty of building them.</P>

<HEAD>TITLES of the EMPEROR and EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P><Q>The emperor's title runs thus: “We the ser∣vant and lord of the most honoured and blessed cities, the venerable houses and sacred places, be∣fore which all nations bow; of Mecca, which God delights to honour; of the resplendent Medina, and the holy city of Jerusalem; of the imperial and desirable cities of Constantinople, Adrianople, and Bursa, emperor; also of Babylon, Damascus, of the fragrant paradise, and the incomparable Egypt; of all Arabia, Aleppo, Antioch, and many other highly celebrated and memorable places, cities, and faithful vassals, emperor; emperor of emperors, the most gracious and all-powerful sul∣tan, &amp;c.”</Q></P>
<P>The empire is stiled the Ottoman kingdom or empire, the Ottoman Porte, the Sublime Porte, the Sublime Sultanian Porte, &amp;c. The appella∣tion of Porte is said to be derived from the large gate built by Mahomed II. at the entrance of the seraglio at Constantinople; though the Orientals, in general, call a royal palace the king's porte or gate.</P>
<P>Having given a general account of the origin, religion, constitution, government, manners, &amp;c. of the Turks, we now proceed to a particular description of that part of the empire called Turkey in Europe.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TURKEY in EUROPE</HEAD>
<P>Is of great extent, and comprehends many coun∣tries, some entirely subject to the Porte, and others dependent upon and tributary to it. It is bounded southward by the Mediterranean; north∣ward by Croatia, Sclavoniá, and Transylvania;
<PB N="102" REF="1060"/>
eastward by Poland, Russia, and Asia; and west∣ward by the Adriatic and Dalmatia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sclavonia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, which by some are in∣cluded in Turkey, shall be described after Hungary, as be∣longing mostly to the house of Austria and the Venetians.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Turkey in Europe in general is very healthful, but the plague is often brought from Egypt, and carries off great numbers; the Turks from custom, and the belief of predestina∣tion, taking little pains to guard against it. The provinces are universally fruitful, though with some difference. All the necessaries of life are equally cheap and good, and would be much more so, were not many tracts suffered to lie waste, and the rest badly cultivated. The chief rivers of Turkey in Europe are the Save, the Danube, the Niester, the Nieper, the Don, and Theis, which falls into the Euxine or Black-sea. Turkey in Europe is not so populous as might be expected; which is attributed to war, pestilence, polygamy, and the avarice and tyranny of the go∣vernors. The inhabitants vary still more than the countries, consisting of Turks, Greeks, Arme∣nians, Servians, Bosnians, Bulgarians, Walachians, and Tartars, with no inconsiderable number of Jews.</P>
<P>In describing the particular countries contained in Turkey in Europe, we shall begin with Roma∣nia, as it contains the capital and seat of the Empire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROMANIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country is supposed to have had its name from the Romans, when the seat of the empire
<PB N="103" REF="1070"/>
was removed from Rome to Constantinople. The Turks call it Rumuli, being antiently a part of Thrace. To the north it is bounded by mount Haemus; to the south by the Archipelago; to the west by Macedonia and the river Strymon; and to the east by the Black-sea, the Strait of Con∣stantinople, the sea of Marmora, or the Propon∣tis, and the Hellespont. Its length from Constan∣tinople to the extremity of Macedonia is about two hundred and eighty miles, and its breadth a∣bout one hundred and eighty. The chief rivers are the Maritz, antiently called Hebrus, the Nes∣sus, or Nestus, and the Strymon, which fall in∣to the Archipelago, or Aegean-sea. The level part of the country towards the sea is pleasant, and fruitful in corn, pasture, and rice; but that which lies among the mountains Haemus, Rhodope, Pangaeus, and Orbelus, is cold and barren. In the mountains are mines of silver, lead, and alum; but almost entirely neglected. The Turks re∣duced this country towards the middle of the fif∣teenth century, and have held it ever since. The beiglerbeg of Romania is the chief in Europe, and has an income of about twelve thousand crowns per annum. The Greeks and Jews are very nu∣merous in this province, which is governed by three sangeacs under the beiglerbeg, and contains the following places of note:</P>
<P>Constantinople, the capital of the whole Turk∣ish empire, and the residence of the grand signior, is very pleasantly and advantageously situated, for it stands on a point of land, that is washed by the sea of Mamora on the south, and the Thracian Bosphorus, or Strait of Constantinople, on the east and north. In consequence of this situation it has a most charming prospect, and a communication by water with most parts of the empire. It was antiently called Byzantium, and afterwards Con∣stantinople,
<PB N="104" REF="1080"/>
from Constantine the Great, who transferred the seat of the empire hither from Rome. The Turks now call it Istampol, and the Greeks Istampoli, or Stampoli. The former have been in possession of it ever since the year 1453, when it was taken after a siege of fifty-four days. It stands in lat. 41°. 0′. long. 28°. 40′. east, being about six hundred and ninety miles from Vienna towards the south-east, nine hundred and fifty south-west from Moscow, and fourteen hundred and thirty-five south-east from London. The canal or strait, which separates it from the Lesser Asia, is about a mile broad. It is of a triangular figure, and of great extent, including the suburbs. Tho' the appearance it makes from without is very grand, yet the streets are narrow, dark, steep, ill paved, and slippery, and most of the houses low, mean, and beggarly, being built of wood and mortar, but crowded with inhabitants. The finest buildings are either without the city near the har∣bour, or within, where it is most thinly inhabited. The fortifications are old, and not capable of making any great resistance against an army. The gates are in number twenty-two, of which six are towards the land, and the rest towards the sea. The bagnios, bazars, seraglios, and the mosques, with their menarets, or high slender spires, make a fine appearance at a distance, especially at the entrance of the canal of the Black-sea. The houses being mostly of wood and mud, the fires, which frequently happen, make dreadful havock among them; the soldiers, it is said, sometimes setting them on fire for the sake of pilfering. When a fire breaks out, to prevent the whole city from being devoured by the flames, the only remedy they have is to blow up a great number of houses. The mosques, of which there are seven stiled royal, are very handsome edifices. They
<PB N="105" REF="1090"/>
stand every one single, within a spacious in∣closure, planted with lofty trees, and adorned with delightful fountains. The Turks suffer not a dog to enter the mosques, and no one presumes to hold discourse in those inclosures, or do the least irreverent action. The harbour lies to the north of the city, and is both convenient and spacious. The river Lycus falls into it on the north-north-west. Abundance of tunny fish are caught in it. They were called by the antients palamides, and are frequently represented on the medals of Byzantium with the heads of the emperors Caligula, Claudius, Caracalla, &amp;c. If the Turks would apply themselves to naviga∣tion, they might make themselves very formida∣ble by sea, for they have the best harbours in the Mediterranean; and from the Red-sea they might carry on a trade with all parts of the East-Indies, without doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The only wind to which the port of Constantinople is exposed is that from the east, which occasions a terrible noise and confusion, especially when it happens in the night. At the point of the triangle, near the canal and harbour, stands the seraglio, which is a mile and a half round, being rather a collection of palaces than one single building. From the main entrance, which by the Turks is called Capi, i. e. the gate or port, the Turkish empire takes its name. Be∣low the palace, on the declivity of a hill, are the gardens, lying where it is supposed Old Bizantium stood; from whence there is a view of the de∣lightful coast of the Lesser Asia, and the seraglio of Scutari. In the seraglio, properly so called, is the hall or chamber where ambassadors have their audiences, which is of amazing magnificence, especially the throne, and the ne plus ultra both of them and all other foreigners. A man's curio∣sity
<PB N="106" REF="1100"/>
might cost him dear, should he proceed far∣ther. Within the bounds of this seraglio are the grand signior's apartments, the women's apart∣ments, the mint, the infirmary, the kitchens, the stables, the treasury, the great council chamber, where the divan is held; the old seraglio, in which the wives of the deceased sultans are shut up, the apartments for the eunuchs, and other officers, the pages or ichoglans, and the azamoglans, who are employed in the most sordid offices of the se∣raglio. It is said forty thousand cart-loads of wood for fuel, and forty thousand oxen for provi∣sion, are yearly consumed in it, besides two hun∣dred sheep daily, one hundred lambs, or goats, according to the season, ten calves, two hundred hens, two hundred pair of chickens, one hundred pair of pidgeons, and fifty green geese. Among the mosques, the most magnificent is that of St. Sophia, once a christian church: it is said, in many respects, to excel that of St. Peter's, at Rome. It is built in the form of a Greek cross on an eminence, and in the clear is two hundred and fifty-two feet long, and two hundred and twenty-eight broad. The dome, which covers almost the whole structure, rests outwardly on four prodigious large towers, which have been added of late years to support it. The grand signior goes every Friday to it; but a christian is seldom or never admitted. It is adorned with a profusion of marble, porphyry, and Egyptian granite; but there are no pictures or statues in it or the other mosques. The royal mosques require such immense sums for their support, that, it is said, they consume one third of the land-revenue of the empire. We are told that the annual in∣come of St. Sophia alone amounts to thirty-two thousand pounds sterling. These revenues are ap∣propriated to the keeping up the buildings, paying
<PB N="107" REF="1110"/>
the salaries of the officers of the mosque, provid∣ing food for the poor, who come to the gate at certain hours, maintaining the hospitals that ad∣join thereto, educating and breeding up scholars in the law of Mahomet, relieving indigent trades∣men and the like; the rest goes into the treasury of the mosques, which is kept in the castle of the seven towers, and which the grand signior cannot in conscience touch, but upon urgent occasions, when their religion is at stake. There are a great many Greek and Armenian churches in the city, with two or three for the Roman catholics, and one for the Lutherans, which was built by the Swedes, with the consent of the Porte. There are some noble antiquities in and about Constanti∣nople, particularly the antient Hypodrome, called by the Greeks Atmeidan. At the south end of the city is the castle of the seven towers, to which an eighth was added not many years ago. It is a prison for state criminals, as the Tower of Lon∣don is with us. The bazars, or bezesteins, are large square buildings covered with domes, and stored with all manner of merchandizes, where the Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Armenians, meet for traffic. Not far from the old and new bazars is the slave-market, where slaves of both sexes, in∣cluding a number of beautiful young girls, bought up chiefly by the Jews in Gircassia, Georgia, Greece, and elsewhere, are publicly exposed to sale. Such of them, both men and women, to whom nature has been sparing of her charms, are set apart for the vilest services; but such girls as have youth and beauty, pass their time very agreeably, only they are often forced to turn Ma∣hometans. The Jews, who are the greatest dealers in this traffic, to make the female slaves sell the better, take great care of their education, and teach them to dance, sing, and play on various
<PB N="108" REF="1120"/>
instruments, and every accomplishment that can inspire love. Those whom their destiny places in the seraglio are not always the most fortunate: it is true, a poor shepherd's daughter may come to be a sultaness; but great numbers are entirely ne∣glected by the sultan. After his death they are shut up for the rest of their days in the old sera∣glio, which the Turks call Esqui Serai, and which is surrounded by a wall two miles in compass, within which are lodgings and gardens. There, unless some bassa courts them, they pine them∣selves away, bewailing the death of the sultan, or that of their children, whom the new sultan often causes to be strangled. The gate of this se∣raglio is always guarded by Capigis and Janizaries. Here, and all over Turkey, are harans or pub∣lic inns, where travellers of whatever religion or country may lodge three days gratis; and in not a few, they are provided with food. The pa∣lace of the Greek patriarch stands on a hill not far from the harbour, near the patriarchal church, dedicated to St. George. The Janizaries, who, as we observed before, amount to about forty thousand, are lodged within the imperial palace, in fifty-two odas or chambers. It is said there are two thousand bostangis, or gardeners, employ∣ed to take care of the gardens of the seraglio, and yet they do not excel in beauty and neatness. The city and suburbs are affirmed to be twenty∣four miles in circumference, and the number of inhabitants about a million, of which more than half are Greeks and Armenians. The plague often makes a dreadful havock among them, vi∣siting them generally once a-year. The hypo∣drome, or running-place for horses, which we mentioned above, is an oblong square, four hun∣dred paces long, and one hundred wide. It is
<PB N="109" REF="1130"/>
adorned with three beautiful antique pillars, two of marble, and one of brass. Of the marble, one is called the hieroglyphical pillar, being en∣graven on the four sides with many odd figures or hieroglyphics. A foreigner, taking a Janizary with him, may walk all over the city without the least insult or molestation. The environs are ex∣tremely pleasant, especially along the Strait, being covered with towns, villages, seats, gardens, meadows, vineyards, and woods. The suburbs are those of Ejup, or St. Job, Galata, Cassun Bascha, St. Demetrio, Pera, and Tophana. The first is on the west side of the city, the second on the side of the harbour opposite to Constantinople, with Cassun Bascha, St. Demetrio, and Pera, ad∣joining to it. Tophana lies directly fronting the imperial palace. Galata is chiefly inhabited by Christians and Jews, and is the handsomest suburb of the whole city. It is pretty well fortified with walls, towers, and moats. A much greater de∣gree of liberty is found in Galata than is expe∣rienced throughout the whole Ottoman em∣pire. Taverns are tolerated in it, to which the Turks themselves resort to take a chearful glass. There are also several Greek and Roman catholic churches and convents in it, with the merchants warehouses, a fine fish-market, and the dersana or dock. The situation of Pera is perfectly charm∣ing, and the air healthy; from it you have a view of the whole coast of Asia, and of the grand sig∣nior's seraglio. Here most of the christian en∣voys reside. The foreign merchants also have their houses in Pera, promiscuously with the Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Turks. The seraglio here is running to decay. Topana takes its name from the arsenal or foundery for cannon here, which in Turkish is called by that name. The Turks cast very good cannon; but their artillery is quite
<PB N="110" REF="1140"/>
plain, and without the least ornament. Constanti∣nople and its suburbs are well supplied with water, conveyed thither at a vast charge over hills and valleys by aqueducts. On the strait, where the Black Sea communicates with the Sea of Marmora, are great numbers of fine setas; among these is Besiktasch, the usual summer residence of the emperor and his women. In the neighbourhood is a strong castle commanding the entrance of the strait from the Black Sea, and opposite to it, in Natolia, is another. At a little distance also is a place called Belgrade from its beauty and plea∣santness. It lies high, has a good air, is shaded with abundance of woods, watered with many springs, stored with several sorts of game, and accommodated with small villages at convenient distances. Here the grand signior has kioskes, or small pleasure houses, which he sometimes vi∣sits. The foreign ministers have also their places of retirement here. At the issue of the Black-sea, is a lighthouse for the safety of mariners, and near it are the remains of Pompey's pillar, and of Ovid's tower.</P>
<P>A very late traveller makes the following re∣marks upon the city of Constantinople, and the manners and customs of the Turks: "Constan∣tinople, says he, is one of the largest cities in the world, and is said to contain seven or eight hundred thousand people, and would be still fuller of inhabitants if the government would admit it. It is built on very unequal ground, and the streets are consequently the same: they are paved; and though not so clean as those at the Hague, are not so dirty as those were in London. The houses are built of wood and plaister; they make no great appearance without, but are con∣venient and sometimes very rich within: most of them command fine prospects to the sea. There
<PB N="111" REF="1150"/>
are no carriages for the transportation of goods in this city; porters are the general vehicles made use of, except for timber and heavy loads, they use horses, and tie the boards on their backs. Most things come to the city from the Black and White Seas by water. The inhabitants are ex∣tremely clean and well dressed, especially the Turks, in gay colours and the cleanest turbans: each per∣son here is distinguished by his cloaths; and the variety of different shaped turbans denote the si∣tuations of the different wearers. The women in the street wear robes of green, red, yellow, blue, which cover intirely their under-dress, which is very rich; they wear a piece of muslion on their head, as far as the eye, and another on their chins, to the top of the nose, so that their eyes only are uncovered: they walk much about the streets, and the boats and the canal are full of them. The market-places and large streets in the city of Con∣stantinople are almost covered over with sheds; the merchandize is set forth in the neatest manner, but the dust among such a number of people be∣ing confined, is exceeding troublesome. The number of boats in the canal is very great, they are the best built I ever saw, and the rowers in∣comparable. They have much difficulty to avoid running against each other. The gulf is near a mile across; the shore on each side the canal looks beautiful, with the villages thereon, which reach ten or twelve miles, almost as far as Bujukdere, the usual country residence of the Frank ministers. The streets in this city are free from disturbance. There sits a Turk, with a twisted stick in his hand, on a little carpet, at the corner of most of the streets, who, together with his companions, im∣mediately assemble on any occasion that is necessa∣ry. The police of this city is, in many respects,
<PB N="112" REF="1160"/>
beyond that of any other. Provisions are always in great plenty, very cheap, and very good. This proceeds from its being the duty of the grand vizir himself, the first person in the empire after the grand signior, and who certainly is the first subject on earth in eminence and power, to visit, in the different parts of the city, the markets and shops, which he does generally every month or oftener; at which time he is followed, at a distance by his officers, whom he precedes, dressed like a private man, enquires into the prices of provision and examines their value; if he finds them bad, over-rated, or deficient in weight or measure, then he assumes the magistrate, calls to his attendants, and punishes immediately the offenders very se∣verely, but seldom with death. The late grand vizir invented a new punishment for the bakers who sold bad bread, or such as was deficient in weight: he caused them to be hung up by the shoulders at their own doors for a considerable time. There are few physicians, fewer apothecaries, and no surgeons here; the inhabitants therefore know little of the horrid mischiefs occasioned by a certain disease we labour under in great cities."</P>
<P>Adrianople, called by the Turks Edrene, is a large city on the river Maritz, one hundred and ten miles from Constantinople towards the north∣west. It had the name of Adrianople from the emperor Adrian, by whom it was repaired in the year 122. Before that it was called Uscudama. The Turks first took it from the Christians in the year 1360. The river Caradare, or Arde, here falls into the Maritz. Hard by the city is an im∣perial palace, or seraglio, in which the sultan, with his court, sometimes resides, especially in time of war, and when the plague rages at Con∣stantinople. Adrianople is the seat of a Greek
<PB N="113" REF="1170"/>
bishop, contains some very magnificent mosques, stands in a very fertile country, and, by means of its rivers, carries on a very considerable traffic. The houses are said to be mostly low, built of wood and clay, and some of bricks, and the streets so dirty, that a man must wear boots in winter. The number of the inhabitants are computed at about one hundred thousand. The wine, pro∣duced in the neighbouring country, is reckoned the best in Turkey. Here is a fine bazar, called Ali Bassa, half a mile long, furnished with all sorts of rich goods, and kept by Turks, Greeks, Ar∣menians, and Jews. Sultan Selim's mosque is an edifice of surprising magnificence On a hill with∣in the city is a murada, or monastery, of Turkish monks. The city is governed by a mola-cadi, who has an absolute sway, both in civil and cri∣minal matters. Both Constantinople and Adri∣anople lie in the sangiakship of Byzea, which ex∣tends from the east of mount Haemus to the sea of Marmora.</P>
<P>Philippoli, a pretty large town, situated on the western bank of the Maritz, which carries boats hither, and thereby supplies the town with all ne∣cessaries and conveniencies. It stands ninety miles from Adrianople to the north-west near mount Haemus, is the see of a Greek archbishop, and took its name from Philip, the father of Alexan∣der the Great, by whom it was founded. Mr. Paul Lucas says, this is the only town in Turkey where he saw a steeple with a clock that strikes the hours. The Turks first made themselves masters of it in 1360.</P>
<P>Basartschiek is a noted town among the Turks, delightfully situated on the Maritz. It is clean, well-built, and carries on a great trade.</P>
<P>Mustapha-Bascha-Kiupri, a town on the Maritz, takes its name from a beautiful bridge, built by
<PB N="114" REF="1180"/>
Mustapha Bascha, which consists of twenty arches, and cost two hundred thousand rix-dollars.</P>
<P>Kirk-Ecclesie, a town twelve leagues from A∣drianople, inhabited chiefly by Jews. It was antiently called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or forty churches, from the number of christian churches it contained. The above four towns lie in the sangiakship of Kirkeli, on the north side of mount Haemus.</P>
<P>Gallipoli, a considerable town, with a spacious harbour, seated on that celebrated strait antiently called the Hellespont, which divides Europe from Asia, and is several miles broad, being now called the strait of Gallipoli, or the Dardanelles. It is about ninety miles from Constantinople towards the south-west. The chief employment of the inha∣bitants is said to be making arrows. The doors to the Greek and Jew houses are not above two feet and a half high in this and many other towns in Turkey, to prevent the Turks, in their frolicks, from coming on horseback into the houses, where they would commit a thousand outrages. Its pre∣sent name is a corruption of its antient one of Calliopolis, which it is said to have had from Cal∣lias, prince of the Athenians, by whom it was founded. In consequence of its situation, its trade is very considerable. It gives name to a sangiakship, in which lies the peninsula, antient∣ly called the Thracian Chersonesus. This pe∣ninsula is inhabited chiefly by Greeks, the de∣scendants of the antient Thracians. In the same sangiakship are situated Trajanopoli, Demotica, and Astrizza, with one of the castles called the Dardanelles.</P>
<P>Trajanopoli stands on the Maritz, thirty-three miles from Adrianople to the south, taking its name from Trajan, who repaired it. It is now a small town, but the see of a Greek archbishop.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="1190"/>
Demotica stands also on the Maritz, and is the residence of a Greek bishop. Charles XII. king of Sweden, spent some time in it in the year 1713.</P>
<P>Astrizza, now a mean place on the Archipelago, was antiently called Abdera, and was one of the most celebrated cities in the world. Here Demo∣critus the philosopher was born, who put out his eyes, that he might the better exert his mind in sublime contemplations. Protagoras, the philo∣sopher, was also a native of this place. The an∣tient inhabitants were very subject to frenzy and lunacy, which occasioned the proverb <HI>Abderitica mens,</HI> to denote a lunatic. Of the castles called the Dardanelles, two stand on each side, as you enter from the Archipelago, the canal or strait antiently called the Hellespont, and now the strait of Gallipoli, the canal of the Dardanelles, the Arm of St. George, and by the Turks Boghers, or the strait of the White-sea. Two others stand as you enter the sea of Marmora, from this strait. The four castles are mounted with cannon, and garri∣soned. All ships coming from Constantinople are searched at the two last; those that come from the Archipelago at the two first of these castles, which are above four miles asunder; but the others at Sestas and Abydas, near the sea of Marmora, or the Pro∣pontis, are only about three quarters of a mile. The antient towns of Sestos and Abydas, supposed to have stood at a little distance from the last of these castles, where the strait is narrowest, was famous for the loves of Hero and Leander, and for Xerxes's bridge. The sea of Marmora, called antiently the Propontis, has its name from an island in it. Its greatest length is about one hundred and fifty miles, and its greatest breadth about forty-five.</P>
<P>There are several other towns in Romania, be∣sides these we have described, as Jetiman, Selivrea,
<PB N="116" REF="1200"/>
Heraclea, Rodosto, Burgas, &amp;c. Jetiman lies near mount Haemus, Selivrea, Heraclia, and Rodosto on the sea of Marmora, and Burgas not far from Constantinople. Heraclea, antiently a large city, and called Perinthus, is now a mean place.</P>

<HEAD>BULGARIA.</HEAD>
<P>Bulgaria is bounded to the south by mount Haemus, which separates it from Romania; to the north by the Danube; to the east by the Black∣sea; and to the west by Servia. Its greatest length from east to west is about two hundred and eighty miles, and its breadth from north to south about one hundred and eighty. It was antiently called the Lower Mysia, but its modern name it had from the Bulgarians, who came from Asiatic Sarmatia. Towards the middle of the sixteenth century it was subdued by the Turks under Amurath II. It is now a part of the great government under the beiglerbeg of Rumelia, and is divided into four smaller governments under their respective san∣geaks. The country is very mountainous; but has many rich and fruitful vallies, producing plen∣ty of corn, wine, and pasturage. There are many mineral waters both hot and cold in the mountains, and in that called Wetozcha are iron mines; but the chief product of the country is cattle. Vast numbers of eagles breed in the neighbourhood of the town of Babadoge, where the archers all over Turkey supply themselves with feathers for their arrows. The principal rivers are the Danube and Ischar. The inhabitants of Bulgaria are mostly of the Greek church, with a mixture of Turks and Jews. Their language is a dialect of the Scla∣vonic. The places of most note in the country are,</P>
<P>Sophia, a pretty large populous town on the Ischa, or Bojane, one hundred miles from Adri∣nople,
<PB N="117" REF="1210"/>
and two hundred and seventy from Constanti∣nople to the north-west. The inhabitants call it Treditza. The name of Sophia it is said to have had from the wife of the emperor Trajan, who built it out of the ruins of the antient city of Sar∣dica. It is one of the greatest thoroughfares in Turkey, since all those that travel from Constan∣tinople for Venice, Ragusa, and Hungary, must necessarily pass thro' it. Here the beiglerbeg of Ru∣melia resides, tho' the air is said to be unwholesome; and the Greeks, Jews, and Armenians carry on a considerable trade. It has no walls, and the streets are narrow and dirty, being paved only in the foot∣ways.</P>
<P>Nicopoli, a large town on the Danube, two hundred and twenty miles from Adrianople to∣wards the north, is said to have been built by the emperor Trajan, after the victory he had gained over the Dacae. It is noted in history for the first defeat of the Christians by the Turks in 1396.</P>
<P>Silistria, a large fortified town, and a bishop's see, on the Danube, sixty-six miles from Nicopoli to the east, and two hundred and sixty from Con∣stantinople to the north-north-west, was antient∣ly called Dorostulus. Very few of its inhabi∣tants are Turks. Near it are some remains of the wall which the Grecian emperors built against the inroads of the Barbarians.</P>
<P>Tomiswar, or Tomis, a town on the Black-sea, twenty miles to the south of the nearest mouth of the Danube, for the Danube discharges itself into the Black-sea by seven months. Some take it to be the antient Tomi, Tomis, Tomea, or Tomos, once the capital of Lesser Scythia, and the place of Ovid's exile; but others place it at Baba, ten miles to the north of Tomiswar.</P>
<P>Preslaw, a considerable town, antiently called Mercianopolis, from its having been built by Trajan, in honour of his sister Marciana.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="1220"/>
In this country among the hills stands an antient monument erected by Trajan, and for that reason called Trajan's-gate. It consists of two stone-pil∣lars, with an arch over them, representing a gate. It appears to have been a very stately structure, but is now greatly defaced. Along the Danube lies a district called Dobrudsche, whose inhabitants are remarkable for their hospitality. They are of Tartarian extraction, and called Pschkias. When a traveller passes through any of their villages, all the inhabitants of both sexes come out to salute him, intreating him in the civilest manner to take up his lodgings with them, and partake of what God has been pleased to bestow. If he accepts the invitation, he is entertained for the space of three days, together with his horses; his fare consisting of honey, eggs, and bread baked under the embers, but of a very fine sort.</P>
<P>There are several other towns in this province, besides those we have described, as Mesembria, Dionysiopoli, Varna, Prostiwitza, or Istropolis, Klessura, Zelezna, Copelowatz, Widen, a strong place on the Danube, and antiently called Vimina∣cium, Samcova, Scharkioi, Lescovita, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SERVIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country was antiently called Moesia Supe∣rior or Prima, and inhabited chiefly by the Dar∣dani, whence it was also called Dardania. It had its present name of Servia from the Servians, a people of Sarmatia Asiatica; and that of Rascia from the river Rasca. It is bounded on the south by Albania and Macedonia; on the north by the Danube, which parts it from Hungary; on the east by Bulgaria; and on the west by Bosnia. Its greatest length is said to be about seventy miles, but its breadth is very unequal, being in some
<PB N="119" REF="1230"/>
places thirty miles, in others no more than fif∣teen. The air is temperate and healthful; and the soil would be exceeding fruitful, and produce corn, wine, and pasture in abundance, if duly cultivated. The country is well watered with rivers, and di∣versified with plains, woods, and hills, the last of which are said to contain rich mines; but none of them are worked. The inhabitants breed great numbers of horses, and manufacture abundance of cotton. The language of the Servians is a dia∣lect of the Sclavonic, approaching pretty near to that of Russia. As to religion, they are mostly Greeks, with a mixture of Jews, Papists, and Ma∣hometans. The Jews and Greeks manage the trade, and live in the cities, and the Turks in the boroughs and fortresses. This country was united to Hungary by a perpetual compact, and govern∣ed by a ban, till it was conquered by sultan Maho∣met II. since which time it has been subject to the Turks. It is divided into four sangiakships, and contains the following places of some note.</P>
<P>Belgrade, in Latin called Alba Graecorum, and by the Turks Nandor Fejervar, is seated at the conflux of the Save and Danube, on the fron∣tiers of Hungary, about two hundred and fifty miles from Vienna to the south-east, and four hundred and fifty-five from Constantinople to the north-west. It is a large populous city, and strong both by nature and art, being fortified with a castle or citadel, and a double wall, flanked with a prodigious number of towers. It is very advantageously situated for trade; for there are several other rivers besides the Danube and Save at no great distance from it: and a great trade is carried on here by Turkish, Jewish, Greek, Hungarian, Armenian, Sclavonian, Aus∣trian, and Ragusan merchants. There are two large bezesteins or bazars, a stately karavanserai,
<PB N="120" REF="1240"/>
or public inn, and a college for young students in the town. In 1717, the Hungarians and Aus∣trians took it from the Turks; but in 1739 were obliged to evacuate it, though not till they had first demolished all its outworks, leaving nothing standing but the old walls, and some fortifications inseparable from them.</P>
<P>Pasarowitz, a small town on the Morau, about thirty miles from Belgrade towards the east. Here a peace was concluded in 1718 between Charles VI. and Achmet III.</P>
<P>Fetislan, called in the Servian or Rascian tongue, Kladowo, is a considerable town on the Danube.</P>
<P>Nissa, a pretty strong town on the river Nissa, from which it takes its name, is one hundred miles from Belgrade towards the south-east, and seventy from the Danube to the south. The houses here, as in all other Turkish towns, are very small, low, and built only of wood and mortar.</P>
<P>Uscup, Scupi, Scopia, a large and well built town, at the foot of mount Orbilus, on the river Vardan, or Apius, fifteen miles from Nissa to the west, eighty-three from Sophia to the north-west, ninety-five from Belgrade to the south-east, and seventy-five from the Danube to the south. It is a place of considerable trade, especially in tanned leather. In the neighbourhood of this town is an aqueduct carried over a valley between two hills, and supported by two hundred arches. There is also a fine bridge of twelve arches over the Var∣dan.</P>
<P>There are several other smaller towns and for∣tresses in this province which we have not room to particularize.</P>
<P>The Danube, which constitutes its northern boundary, has some remarkable curiosities in it with∣in the limits of this province, particularly those
<PB N="121" REF="1250"/>
called Tsachtali, and the Iron-gate; the first is a cataract, and at the other the river is pent up be∣tween two mountains. The large plain or heath of Cassova, called by the Turks, Rego Mezo, and thought to be the Campus Merulae, lies on the frontiers of Servia towards Bulgaria. It is famous for some bloody battles fought on it be∣twixt the Turks and Christians. Dr. Brown says, the tomb of Amurath I. emperor of the Turks, who was killed there, is still to be seen upon it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BOSNIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country and Servia make what is pro∣perly called Turkish Illyricum, to distinguish it from Hungarian Illyricum, containing Croatia, Sclavonia, and Dalmatia. It is bounded on the north by the river Save, which separates it from Sclavonia; on the south by a chain of mountains which part it from Dalmatia; on the east by the Drino; and on the west by the Verbas; the for∣mer of these rivers dividing it from Servia, and the latter from Croatia. It is said to be fifty miles long from north-west to south-east, and about twenty miles broad from north to south. It was antiently that part of Pannonia called Inferior, and took its present names of Bosnia and Rama from the rivers Bosna and Rama. Its air, soil, produce, language, and inhabitants, are much the same as those of Servia. Like Servia also, it was formerly united to Hungary, and go∣verned by a prince or despota; but in 1465, the Turks made themselves masters of it; when Ste∣phen V. last king of Bosnia, was taken by Maho∣met II. who caused him to be flead alive. It is under the government of a beiglerbeg and three sangiaks, and the following are its principal places.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="1260"/>
Banialucka, a strong town near a lake of the same name, on the borders of Dalmatia. Here the beiglerbeg of Bosnia resides.</P>
<P>Jaitzo, a strong town in Lower Bosnia, near the confines of Croatia, was formerly the capi∣tal of the kingdom, and the seat of its kings.</P>
<P>Orbach, a considerable town in Upper Bosnia, on the river Drino. It is the capital of the san∣giakship to which it gives name.</P>
<P>Serajo, or Seraglio, now reckoned the chief town of all Bosnia, is a place of good trade, and stands on the river Bosna, in Lower Bosnia, thirty miles from Banialucka.</P>
<P>The other towns in this province worth men∣tioning are, Verbosania, Dubitza, Prisrendi, Swornick, or Zwornick, and Strebernick. There are some silver mines near the last that are worked.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WALACHIA, properly so called, or WALACHIA beyond the MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>This country is bounded on the north partly by Moldavia, from which it is separated by a vast chain of mountains and the river Sereth, and part∣ly by Transylvania; on the east and south by the Danube; and on the west by part of Hungary and Transylvania. It is of a triangular form, and its length about three hundred and fifty miles; but its breadth is very unequal, not exceeding, however, at most two hundred miles. The Turks call it Cara Bogdiana, i. e. Black Bogdiania, to distinguish it from Moldavia, which they call Bogdiana.</P>
<P>The air of Walachia is temperate, and the soil very fruitful in corn, wine, fruits, and pasture, where duly cultivated; but there are but few of the inhabitants, comparatively speaking, who ap∣ply
<PB N="123" REF="1270"/>
themselves to husbandry. The country, how∣ever, abounds in cattle, and is noted for an excel∣lent breed of horses. Wood is so scarce that they are obliged to use hemp and cow-dung dried, for fuel. The mountains are said to be rich in metals, but there are no mines worked. A mineral salt is found in the country, which is as hard as mar∣ble, and of a purplish colour; but when well pounded it becomes white. The principal rivers that water this province are, the Aluta, the Ja∣bonitz, and the Sereth, or Strech, which, with many smaller ones, discharge themselves into the Danube. The christian religion, according to the Greek church, is professed in Walachia, and the patriarch of Constantinople is their metropo∣litan; but the common people are wretchedly ig∣norant, and even the learning of the clergy seldom goes beyond reading and singing well. Great numbers of Mohammedans and Jews live inter∣mixed with those of the Greek religion.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Walachia, being generally de∣scended from the old Roman colony settled there by Trajan, their language is a barbarous Latin intermixed with Turkish and Sclavonian. It is like that jumble of languages called the Lin∣gua Franca, which is understood almost all over the East, and particularly along the coast of the Mediterranean. The persons of rank among the Walachians, are so fond of the Italian lan∣guage, that they apply themselves to it more than to their mother tongue; and generally send their sons to study at the university of Padua. The waywode, prince, despot, or hospodar of Wa∣lachia, is a vassal of the Ottoman Porte, paying a yearly tribute to it of about sixty thousand du∣cats, and furnishing a body of troops in time of war. The Turks often depose him for no other reason but because another offers a larger tribute.
<PB N="124" REF="1280"/>
The trade of this country consists chiefly in corn and wine, which they export to Russia and Po∣land, and in hides, wax and honey; they also send beef dried in the sun, pulse, and butter, to Constantinople. The trade is chiefly carried on by Armenians, Jews, Saxons, Hungarians, and Ragusans. The houses here are built only with timber and straw, cemented together with reeds, with which this country abounds. Walachia is divided into two parts, denominated Walachia on this and the other side the river Aluta. The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Tergovisto, or Terves, the capital of the country, where the waywode has a fine palace. It stands on the river Jalonitz, in a marshy ground, about sixty miles from the Danube to the north, and has a good trade, with some fortifications.</P>
<P>Buckerest, a pretty strong town and an archie∣piscopal see, on the Dembrowitz, thirty miles from Tergovisto to the south-east, and forty from the Danube to the north. Here is a sort of aca∣demy or university, and the usual residence of the waywode.</P>
<P>Langenau, or Campolungo, a pretty good town on the other side the Aluta, in the eastern part of the country.</P>
<P>There are several other towns in Walachia, as Baja, Orsowa, old and new, Bakow, or Brastkow, Rebnek, Jalonitza, Braila, Krajova, Tschernetz, &amp;c. On the Danube, within the limits of this country, are to be seen some remains of a bridge, in all probability that which the emperor Trajan laid over it, in order to attack Decebalus, king of the Dacians.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="125" REF="1290"/>
<HEAD>MOLDAVIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country takes its name from the Moldau, which runs through it. It is also watered by the Pruth, the Sereth, Neister, or Dneister, being bounded to the south by Walachia; to the north by Poland; to the east part by the Ukraine, from which the Neister, or Tarla, divides it, and part∣ly by Bessarabia; and to the west by Transylvania. Its greatest length from south to north is about two hundred and forty miles, but its breadth va∣ries from one hundred and fifty to eighty. Former∣ly it had the name of Bogdania, from a chief named Bogdan, who brought a colony hither from Transylvania in the twelfth century. It is said the Turks still call it by that name. This is in general a mountainous barren country; but there are some fertile spots in it, producing-corn, wine, pulse, honey, wax, &amp;c. Great numbers of horses also are bred in it. The air is said to be whole∣some, but sharper than that of Walachia. Most of the inhabitants are of the Greek church, with a mixture of Mahometans, Papists, &amp;c. The prince or waywode of Moldavia, like that of Wa∣lachia, is stiled hospodar, and is tributary to the grand-signior, who deposes him when he pleases. The chief towns are,</P>
<P>Jassy, the capital, and residence of the waywode, stands on the river Pruth, eighty miles from Bender, to the north-west. Before the year 1753 it was a considerable town, and pretty well forti∣fied, but was then entirely destroyed by fire. In what condition it is at present we cannot say.</P>
<P>Choczim, or Chotzen, a strong town on the Dniester, near the borders of Podolia, one hun∣dred and ten miles from Jassy towards the north.</P>
<P>Soczowa, or Sotschowa, formerly the capital of
<PB N="126" REF="1300"/>
the country, but at present a tolerable town on the river Sereth, sixty miles from Jassy towards the north-west.</P>
<P>The other towns worth mentioning are, Huszi, or Huz, on the Pruth, where a battle was fought in 1711, betwixt czar Peter I. and the Turks; Faltschii, near which the antient city of Jaipheli is supposed to have stood; Soroka, on the Dniester; Czudno and Herlow on the Pruth; Galatsch on the Danube, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>BESSARABIA.</HEAD>
<P>Bessarabia, called by the Turks Budziack, or Budzack, is a small country on the Black Sea, be∣tween the Danube and the Dniester. The inhabi∣tants are called the Budriak, or Budziack, Biel∣gorad; and Ackerman Tartars, from the chief∣towns; and sometimes White Hordes, from their inhabiting the banks of the Dniester, whose wa∣ters are turbid and whitish. Most of them rove from place to place, and live on the flesh of their oxen, horses, cheese, and milk, particularly that of mares. The only places in the country worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Bender, which in the Turkish language signi∣fies a pass, a strong town on the Dniester, up∣wards of one hundred miles from its mouth. It is remarkable for being the place where Charles XII. of Sweden resided from the year 1709, when he was defeated at Pultowa, to 1710, when the Turks were obliged to use force to get rid of him.</P>
<P>Akerman, or Bielgorad, i. e. the white town
<PB N="127" REF="1310"/>
or castle, seated near the Black-sea and the mouth of the Dniester.</P>
<P>Budriack, on the Dniester, near the ruins of Tyras or Ophiusa.</P>
<P>Kili, a strong town, seated at the mouth of the northern branch of the Danube. The other towns are Cauchan, Palanka, and Parkara.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OCKZAKOW TARTARY, or the Country be∣twixt the Dniester and the Dnieper.</HEAD>
<P>This country is inhabited only near the sea, and along the banks of those rivers. The rest of it is called Dzike-pole, or the desert places, be∣ing quite waste. Near the Dnieper live the Sietsch Cossack<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or the Haydamacks. The only place in it worth mentioning is Ockzakow, situate at the mouth of the Dnieper. It was antiently called Ordessus. The Turks at present call it Kaahleh Ozi, i. e. the fortification of the Dnieper. The Russians, under count Munich, took it by assault in 1737, when it was well fortified; but next year evacuated it, after demolishing the works.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Country betwixt the NIEPER and the DON.</HEAD>
<P>This country is inhabited by the Lesser Nogay Tartars, who are dependent partly on the cham of the Crim Tartars, and partly on Russia. They seldom apply themselves to agriculture, but wan∣der about in hords, and live chiefly on horse-flesh. The religion they profess is Mahometism, though in other respects they are justly denomi∣nated Barbarians; yet their hospitality far exceeds that of the most civilized Christian natives.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="1320"/>
In that part of this vast tract subject to the cham, and under the protection of the Turks, the most remarkable place is Kinburn, a fortifica∣tion on the east side of the Nieper, opposite to Ockzakow.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The CRIMEA.</HEAD>
<P>The country at present distinguished by this name was antiently called Chersonesus Taurica. The Turks call it Kiram Athasi, i. e. the Crim Island. It is surrounded on all sides by the Black∣sea, and the sea of Azoph, except where the isthmus joins it to the continent. The soil of this country is in many parts very fertile, and would, if cultivated, produce plenty of corn, wine, &amp;c. but the Tartars, who live chiefly on horse-flesh, milk, and cheese, despise agriculture, or leave it to their slaves and strangers. Their religion is Mahometism. The country was an∣tiently inhabited by the Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns, successively; and there were some Greek colonies along the coast, of which the town of Bosphorus was the most considerable. Since the Crimea became dependent on the Turks, it hath often been invaded and laid waste by the Russians. The prince, by whom it is governed under the Porte, stiles himself sovereign cham of Lesser Tartary, &amp;c. though in reality he is a vassal of the Porte, and must take the field, when summoned, with a body of auxiliaries. The eldest son, or presumptive heir to the cham, has the title of sultan Galga; the second prince is called Or Beg, i. e. the lord of Or, or Perecop; and the third Naradin Beg, &amp;c. The principal places in the peninsula are,</P>
<P>Perecop, a fortified place on the isthmus, which joins the peninsula to the continent. This
<PB N="129" REF="1330"/>
town hath always been reckoned the key to the whole peninsula, for the greater security of which a ditch hath been dug across the whole isthmus. Perecop hath been often besieged, and taken by the Russians.</P>
<P>Koslow, a pretty strong town, with a fine har∣bour, and considerable trade, stands on the coast of the sea of Azoph, on the western side of the peninsula.</P>
<P>Bakschisarai, an open town on the west side of the peninsula, near the sea, is the residence of the chan, and inhabited by Tartars, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews. The chan's palace is large, but irregular.</P>
<P>Karasbazar, a large town, but all the buildings, except the mosques, are of wood. In the year 1737, the Russians laid it in ashes.</P>
<P>Kersch, or Gersch, a considerable town near the strait formerly called Bosphorus, and now the straits of Caffa, which it commands. It is walled, has a castle with seven towers, a good harbour, twenty-two mosques, and as many Greek churches Its antient names were Ponti∣capeum and Bosphorus.</P>
<P>Kaffa, a large trading sea-port town, situate on the east side of the peninsula, and gives name to the strait betwixt the Black-sea and that of Azoph. It was antiently called Theodosia. The trade here is chiefly in slaves, brought from Cir∣cassia, Mingrelia, and the Crim. The inhabitants are mostly Christians, with a mixture of Turks, Jews, &amp;c. The town is said to contain five or six thousand houses, and is always well garrisoned.</P>

<HEAD>GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>Greece, as is well known to the learned, was antiently the most celebrated region in the world,
<PB N="130" REF="1340"/>
surpassing all others in arms, arts, and sciences. Its antient name was Hellas, which the Latins changed into Graecia. It comprehends at present Macedonia, Albania, now called Arnaut, Epirus, Thessaly, now Janna, Achaia, now Livadia, the Peloponnesus, now Morea, together with the islands on its coast, and in the Archipelago. The continent of Greece is seated betwixt the 36th and 43d degrees of north latitude; and be∣tween the 19th and 27th degrees of longitude, east of London. To the north it is bounded by Bulgaria and Servia, from which it is divided by a ridge of mountains; to the south by the Medi∣terranean sea; to the east by Romania and the Archipelago; and to the west by the Adriatic, or gulph of Venice. Its length is said to be about four hundred miles, and its utmost breadth about three hundred and fifty. The air is extremely temperate and healthy, and the soil fruitful, though badly cultivated, yielding corn, wine, delicious fruits, and abounding with cattle, fowls, and venison. As to religion, Christianity was planted in Greece soon after the death of our Sa∣viour, and flourished there for many ages in great purity; but since the Greeks have been subject to the Turkish yoke, they have sunk into the most de∣plorable ignorance, in consequence of the slavery and thraldom under which they groan, and their religion is now greatly corrupted. It is indeed little better than a heap of ridiculous ceremonies and absurdities. The head of the Greek church is the patriarch of Constantinople, who is chosen by the neighbouring archbishops and metropolitans, and confirmed by the emperor or grand vizir. He is a person of great dignity, being the head and director of the eastern church. The other patriarchs are those of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria. Mr. Tournefort tells us, that the patri∣archates
<PB N="131" REF="1350"/>
are now generally set to sale, and be∣stowed upon those who are the highest bidders. The patriarchs, metropolitans, archbishops, and bishops, are always chosen from among the Ca∣loyers or Greek monks. Before the patriarchs receive their patents and the caftan, which is a vest of lindsey-woolsey, or some other stuff, pre∣sented by the grand signior to ambassadors and other persons newly invested with some consi∣derable dignity, they are obliged to make large presents to the vizir, &amp;c. The income of the patriarch of Constantinople is said to amount to no less than one hundred and twenty thousand guilders, of which he pays the one half by way of annual tribute to the Ottoman porte, adding six thousand guilders besides, as a of present, at the feast of Bairam. The next person to a bishop among the clergy is an archimandrite, who is the director of one or more convents, which are called mandren; then comes the ab∣bot, the arch-priest, the priest, the deacon, the under-deacon, the chanter, and the lecturer. The secular clergy are subjected to no rules, and never rise higher than high-prest. They are al∣lowed to marry once, but it must be with a virgin, and before they are ordained. They have neither glebe nor tythes, but depend on the perquisites that arise from their office, and seldom preach but in Lent. The Greeks have few nunneries, but a great many convents of monks, who are all priests, and, students excepted, obliged to follow some handicraft employment, and lead a very austere life. The Greeks deny the supremacy of the pope, and abhor the wor∣ship of images; but have a multitude of pictures of saints in their churches, whom they pray to as mediators. Their fasts are very severe. They believe also in the doctrine of transubstantiation,
<PB N="132" REF="1360"/>
and that the Holy Ghost does not proceed from the Son. They admit not of purgatory, says Mr. Thevenot; but yet they allow a third place, where they say the blessed remain, in expec∣tation of the day of judgment. At mass they consecrate with leavened bread, and commu∣nicate under both kinds, as well laicks as priests, and as well women and children as men. When they carry the sacrament to the sick, they do not prostrate themselves before it, nor expose it to be adored: neither do they carry it in procession, or have any particular feast in honour of it. Baptism is performed among them by plunging the whole body of the child thrice into water. Immediately after baptism, they give it confirmation and the com∣munion; and seven days after that, it undergoes the ceremony of ablution. When a priest is married, among other ceremonies, the bride∣groom and bride drink each two glasses of wine; then the glass is given to the priest, who merrily drinks off the rest of the wine, and breaking the glass, says, So may the bridegroom break the virginity of the bride. As to the character of the modern Greeks, they are said to be very covet∣ous, hypocritical, treacherous, great pedirasts, and at the same time revengeful to the highest degree; but very superstitious. They are so much despised by the Turks, that they do not value even a Greek who turns Mahometan. The Turks are remarkable for their taciturnity: they never use any unnecessary words; but the Greeks, on the contrary, are very talkative and lively. The Turks generally practise what their religion enjoins, but the Greeks do not; and their misery puts them upon a thousand mean shifts and scan∣dalous practices, authorized by bad example, and perpetuated from father to son. The Greek
<PB N="133" REF="1370"/>
women have fine features and beautiful com∣plexions: their countenances still very much resemble those of the antient Greek statues. The Greek language is now so much corrupted and altered by the mixture of foreign words, that it differs extremely from the antient, being little understood by the present inhabitants, not even the priests, who are in general very illiterate.</P>
<P>We now proceed to the Description of the se∣veral Provinces of GREECE, beginning with</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>MACEDONIA.</HEAD>
<P>The present boundaries of Macedonia are the river Nessus, or Nestus, to the north; Thessaly and Epirus to the south; the Archipelago to the east; and Albania to the west. It is of a very irregular figure. The air is clear, sharp, and wholesome, and the soil, for the most part, fer∣tile, producing corn, wine, and oil. The coun∣try abounds also in rich pastures, fine cattle, woods, and venison. Here too are many rivers and mountains. Of the former the principal are the Varder, antiently Axius; the Platamone, an∣tiently Aliacmon; and the Vistriza, formerly Erigion. The Strymon also passes through part of Macedonia. Of the latter, the most remarka∣ble are Mount Athos and Pangaeus. Formerly Pangaeus was noted for very rich gold and silver mines. Athos, now commonly called Monte Santo, from the great number of monks and hermits that live here in convents, cells, and grottos, is said to be about eleven stadia in height, that is, two miles and three fourths of a mile. Pliny says the shadow of this mountain, before the setting of the sun, at the summer solstice, ex∣tends
<PB N="134" REF="1380"/>
as far as the market-place of Myrrhina in the isle of Lemnos, which is upwards of fifty miles distant. It stands on a peninsula running out into the Aegean sea, and is, in reality, a ridge of mountains. The monks and anchorites lead very austere lives, their usual food being vegeta∣bles, dried olives, figs, fruit, cheese, and some∣times fish. Most of them follow trades, or cul∣tivate vine-yards and olive-yards. There are upwards of twenty convents upon the mountain, and a town called Kareis, inhabited also by monks, and the residence of a Turkish aga, under the bostangi bascha. These are all surrounded with strong walls, flanked with towers, and well planted with artillery to defend them against the invasions of pirates. The monks pay yearly above twenty thousand dollars to the sultan and bascha, which they raise by alms, and the liberal contributions of Russia and the princes of Mol∣davia and Walachia. Macedonia was antiently a kingdom, and some of its kings were very fa∣mous, particularly Alexander the Great, who raised his country to the highest pitch of glory and grandeur, extending his dominions from the Danube to the Indus, and from the Black to the Red Sea.</P>
<P>The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Salonichi, or Salonica, antiently Thessalonica, and now the metropolis of Macedonia, stands at the bottom of the gulph to which it gives name, called antiently Sinus Thermaicus, two hundred and sixty miles from Constantinople, and is a place of great trade, large, and well fortified. In the neighbourhood of it, towards the west, runs the river Verdar. It is extremely populous, but most of the houses are low, and the streets narrow. A Turkish basha resides here, and also a catholic and Greek archbishop. There are still remaining
<PB N="135" REF="1390"/>
many monuments of its antient grandeur, as tri∣umphal arches, churches, now converted into mosques, and antique fragments with inscriptions. In the church of St. Demetrius are said to be above a thousand pillars of jasper, porphyry, &amp;c. The Greeks have here thirty churches, and the Jews thirty-six large synagogues, besides several smaller ones, and two colleges for the education of their youth. St. Paul preached here, and wrote two epistles to the inhabitants. The trade of the city is carried on chiefly by the Jews. Some say it had the name of Thessalonica from Thessa∣lonica, sister of Alexander the Great, and wife of Cassander, who rebuilt, or at least repaired and enlarged it; but, according to others, from a victory obtained here by Philip, the son of Amyntas, over the Thessalians. The Turks, under sultan Amurath, took it from the Ve∣netians in 1313, and have possessed it ever since.</P>
<P>Emboli, antiently Amphipolis, and a fa∣mous Athenian colony, but now a desolate place on the river Strymon, which, about six miles lower, falls into the gulph of Contesta, formerly the Sinus Strymoniacus. It is about sixty miles from Salonichi, towards the north-east.</P>
<P>Janitza, a small town near the ruins of the an∣tient Pella, which was once the capital of Mace∣donia, and where Alexander the Great was born. It stands where the Verdar, or Axius, falls into the gulph of Salonichi, antiently called Sinus Ther∣maicus, twenty-five miles west of the city of Sa∣lonichi.</P>
<P>Aedessa, or Aegaea, once the capital of Mace∣donia, but now inconsiderable, stands on the river Vistrizza, antiently Erigonius.</P>
<P>Veria, antiently called Beraea, and mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="1400"/>
Ochrida, Achrida, or Giustendil, antiently Lychnidus and Lychnidia, a large trading town on the bay of the same name.</P>
<P>Chitro, or Sitron, antiently Pydna, on the bay of Salonichi.</P>
<P>Philippi, a village standing near the ruins of the antient celebrated city of that name, where Bru∣tus and Cassius were defeated by Octavius and Mark Anthony. One of St. Paul's epistles was addressed to the christians of Philippi.</P>
<P>There are some other places, but not worth notice.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ALBANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Albania, or Arnaut, comprehends the old Gre∣cian Illyricum and Epirus. The first of these is sometimes called Upper-Albania, and the other. Lower-Albania. Upper-Albania is bounded by Epirus on the south; by Macedonia on the east; by the gulph of Venice on the west; and on the north-east and north by a chain of mountains, call∣ed Monte-Negro, or the Black-mountains, which divide it from Macedonia, and partly from Servia and Dalmatia. Its greatest length from north to south is about one hundred and ninety miles, and its breadth from east to west ninety-six. The soil is fruitful, especially towards the north, producing flax, cotton, wood, was, and salt. The inhabi∣tants are tall and strong, and make good soldiers, but have scarce any notion of learning among them. The two Albanias were the dominions of the famous prince George Castriot, commonly called Scan∣derbeg, who opposed for many years the whole Turkish power with a small army, and gained twenty-two battles over them. It was at last reduced by Mahomet II. whose successors have held it ever since. As to religion, the inhabitants are mostly
<PB N="137" REF="1410"/>
of the Greek church, or that of Rome, with a mixture of Mahometans, Jews, &amp;c. The rivers most worthy our notice are the Bojana, the Sio∣mini, in Latin Paniasus, the Chrevasta, in Latin Apsus, the La Pollonia, in Latin Laous, Aeas, Aous, the Moraca, which falls into the Lago di Scutari, antiently called Labeatus Lacus, &amp;c. The principal towns are,</P>
<P>Scutari, Scudari, or Scodra, on the river Bo∣jana, near the lake to which it gives name, eighteen miles from the gulph of Venice to the north-east, and seventy-five from Ragusa to the south-east. It is large, well fortified, and was antiently the seat of the kings of Illyricum, as it is now of a beiglerbeg and archbishop. A considerable trade is carried on here.</P>
<P>Dolcigno, called by the antients Ulcinium and Olchinium, has a good harbour and a strong castle on the Adriatic, twenty miles from Scutari to the south-west. Its inhabitants are noted for their piracies.</P>
<P>Durazzo, antiently Epidamnus, and Dyrra∣chium, a small town on the coast of the gulph of Venice, thirty-five miles from Scutari towards the south. It has a pretty good harbour and castle. Here antiently passengers usually embarked for Italy, and landed at Brundusium; as those that were bound to Greece took shipping at the latter, and landed at the former.</P>
<P>Alessio, antiently Lyssus, on the river Drino, two miles from its mouth, and sixteen from Scu∣tari to the south. Here the valiant Scanderbeg died and was buried.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LOWER-ALBANIA,</HEAD>
<P>Otherwise called Epirus and Canina, is bound∣ed on the north by Upper-Albania; by Thessaly
<PB N="138" REF="1420"/>
on the north-east; Achaia on the south; and the Ionian Sea on the west. It is from the south-east to the north-west above one hundred miles in length, and from west to east above sixty miles in breadth. The soil is good, especially on mount Chimera. The mountains of most note are those antiently called Acroceraunia-juga and Ceraunii-Montes, from their being often torn by thunder, and mount Pindus. The former divided Lower from Upper Albania, and are now called Chimera; the latter divided it from Thessaly, and was called Mezzovo, or at least the chain of which Pin∣dus is a part. The river Achilous, now called Aspropotamo, Aspri, or Catochi, parts it from Achaia. It was to this country that Italy owed its first apricots, which, on that account, were called mala Epirotica. It was brought under the Turkish yoke by sultan Amurath II. The places of any note in this country are,</P>
<P>Larta, a large and well peopled town on a bay of the same name, belonging to the Venetians. The river Achiron, now called Delichi, is said by some writers to discharge itself into the bay of Arta, antiently called Sinus Ambracius.</P>
<P>Delphino, the best town in the province, stands near mount Pindus, and is the residence of the Turkish governor.</P>
<P>Chimera, at present a mean place, tho' once a strong town, and noted for its warm baths, stands thirty-five miles from Corfu to the north.</P>
<P>Butrinto, antiently a considerable city, but now a small place. It belongs to the Venetians, and stands on a lake of the same name, over against the island and town of Corfu.</P>
<P>Prevese, a town with a harbour belonging to the Venetians. Nicopolis, founded by Augustus after the battle of Actium, is supposed to have stood hereabouts.</P>

<HEAD>THESSALY, or JANNA.</HEAD>
<P>This province has on the east the Aegean sea and the gulph of Salonichi; on all the other sides it is surrounded with high mountains, which se∣parate it on the north from Macedonia, on the west from Epirus, and on the south from Achaia, now Livadia. It is said to be about one hundred miles from east to west, and ninety from south to north. The air of Thessaly is very healthful, and the soil exceeding fertile, producing oranges, citrons, lemons, pomegranates, grapes of a delicious sweetness, excellent figs, melons, al∣monds, olives, cotton, &amp;c. Here are also large buffaloes, and a breed of good horses, for which the country was antiently no less famous than for the skill of its inhabitants in horsemanship. In this country stand the celebrated mountains Olympus, Pelion, and Ossa. The first is now called Lacha, and the second Petras. Here are also the plains of Pharsalia, the delightful vale of Tempe, and the transparent Peneus, now called Salampria. Deucalion, famous for the flood that happened in his time by the overflowing of the Peneus, was king of Thessaly, and cotemporary with Cecrops, king of Athens. The most re∣markable places in this province are,</P>
<P>Larissa, or Larsa, the capital, called by the Turks Genisahar, or Jeng-ischahir. It stands on the river Peneus, twenty-two miles from its mouth, and sixty-eight from Salonichi towards the south. Over the river is a beautiful bridge of nine arches. The town, though much decayed from its antient grandeur, is still a considerable place, and the see of a Greek archbishop. Mr. Paul Lucas, who was at Larissa in 1706, says, that there were then above two hundred Jewish
<PB N="140" REF="1440"/>
families in it, most of them bankers, and extreme∣ly rich; that the principal branch of its trade is in Russia leather; and that the English have a consul there, who carries on, for the account of his nation, a traffic in corn, loading therewith several vessels in a-year. Here the celebrated Achilles was born.</P>
<P>Tornovo, antiently Tricca, a large city about thirty-seven miles to the north-west of Larissa.</P>
<P>Janna, a well inhabited town, which at pre∣sent gives name to the country, stands about sixty miles from Larissa to the north-west, and al∣most on the spot where Cassiope formerly stood.</P>
<P>The other towns in this province worth men∣tioning are,</P>
<P>Licostomo, antiently Scotusa, on the river Pe∣neus, twenty-two miles below Larissa to the west.</P>
<P>Farsa, or Pharsa, antiently Pharsalus, situated ten miles from Larissa to the south, and famous for the battle fought in its plains between Pom∣pey and Caesar.</P>
<P>Demetriada, or Demetrius, thirty miles from Larissa to the south.</P>
<P>Vola, or Vollo, antiently Pegasa, or Pegasae, about twenty miles from Larissa towards the south.</P>
<P>Armiro, antiently Eretria, situated on the gulph of Armiro, or Volo, formerly called Sinus Pelasgycus, or Pegasicus.</P>
<P>Zeyton, antiently Thebae, or Thebae Thessa∣licae, on a gulph to which it gives name, fifty miles from Larissa to the south. The river Agrio∣mala, antiently called Spirchus, falls into the bay of Zeyton.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="141" REF="1450"/>
<HEAD>ACHAIA, now LIVADIA.</HEAD>
<P>Livadia, antiently Achaia, and Hellas, or Greece, properly so called, is bounded on the north by Epirus and Thessaly, from which it is divided by mount Oeta, now Banina, and by the Euripus, now the straight of Negropont; on the east by the Archipelago; on the south by the gulph of Engia, or Egina, the isthmus of Corinth, and the gulph of Lepanto; and on the west by the Ionian sea and part of Epirus. Its extent is about one hundred and thirty miles from south-east to north-west; but its greatest breadth is not above thirty six miles. It is in general a mountainous country, but neither unpleasant nor unfruitful. The principal mountains are Oeta in Beotia, where is the famous pass of Thermopyae, not above twenty-five feet broad, and Parnassus, Helicon, and Cythaeron in Phocis, which were sacred to Apollo and the Muses, and consequently much celebrated by the poets. The rivers of most note are, the Sionapro, antiently the Achelous, the Cephissus, the Ismenus, and Asopus. Liva∣dia is at present divided into Livadia, properly so called, Stramulippa, and the duchy of Athens. The most remarkable places in it are,</P>
<P>Lepanto, antiently Naupactus, and at present reckoned the capital of Livadia. It stands on that formerly called the gulph of Corinth, and now of Lepanto, opposite Patras, in the Morea. It has a small harbour, and some trade in leather, oil, tobacco, rice, barley, wheat, and furs. The wine here is the best in Greece, and the neigh∣bouring country extremely pleasant and fertile. To defend the entrance into the gulph there are two castles, one on each side, called the Darda∣nelles. The memorable sea-engagement called
<PB N="142" REF="1460"/>
the battle of Lepanto, in which the Venetians, commanded by don John of Austria, obtained a most signal victory over the Turks, was fought on the second of October, 1571.</P>
<P>Livadia, antiently Libadia, or Lebadia, is now a large populous town on the gulph of Lepanto, twenty-five miles from the city of that name to the east. Its trade consists in woollen stuffs and rice. In old times it was celebrated for the ora∣cle of Trophonius, which was in a cavern in a hill above the town. It now gives name to the pro∣vince. Five or six miles from it to the east, is a large lake, to which it also gives name. The wa∣ters of that lake, and the many torrents that fall into it from the mountains, with which it is sur∣rounded, have no other outlet but by subterra∣neous passages, or channels under the moun∣tains.</P>
<P>Setines, antiently the celebrated city of Athens, captial of Attica, though greatly fallen from its antient splendor, is still a considerable city, con∣taining about ten thousand inhabitants, three parts of whom are christians. Both within and without the town are many remains of its former gran∣deur, which proclaim the great perfection of Athe∣nian sculpture and architecture. The principal of them are the temples of Jupiter Olympius and Minerva. The last is now converted into a Turkish mosque, and reckoned the finest piece of antiquity in the world. This city fell under the dominion of the Turks in the reign of Mahomet II. in 1455. The Greek inhabitants are still dis∣tinguished by their sagacity and wit, which, as well as the healthiness of the people, is ascribed to the extraordinary goodness and serenity of the air. The spacious harbour, antiently called Pyraeus, and now by the Greeks Porto Drago, and by the Italians Porto Leone, is still much resorted
<PB N="143" REF="1470"/>
to. It stands thirty-five miles from the isthmus of Corinth to the east, and is the seat of a Greek archbishop, of a Turkish aga, waywode, cadi, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The other places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Megara, now a mean place, not far from the Golfo de Engia.</P>
<P>Castri, antiently Delphi, and noted for the temple and oracle of Apollo, ten miles from Li∣vadia.</P>
<P>Lepsina, formerly Eleusis, and Stibes, or Stives, antiently Thebes, all now inconsiderable places.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PELOPONNESUS, or MOREA.</HEAD>
<P>The Peloponnesus, or Morea, as it is now called, is a large peninsula, joined to the conti∣nent of Greece by the isthmus of Corinth, which, where narrowest, is not above four or five miles over, and was antiently famed for the Isthmian games, celebrated there in honour of Apollo. Its present name of Morea is thought to be derived from morus, a mulberry-tree, on account of the great number of mulberry-trees it produces. It has the gulph of Lepanto on the south; that of Patras on the north-west; the lonian sea on the south-west; the sea of Candia on the south; the Aegean sea on the east; and the gulph of Engia on the south-east. Its greatest length east and west is one hundred and twenty miles, and its greatest breadth south and north about on hundred and fifteen. Excepting the mountain∣ous parts, it is very fertile, producing corn, wine, oil. and most delicious fruits. The chief rivers are the Carban, antiently the Alpheus; the Pirnaza, antiently the Panisus; the Eurotas, now called Basilipotamo, i. e. the king's river; and the Inachus, now Planizza. Here also is the
<PB N="144" REF="1480"/>
brook or river of Styx, which the poets, on ac∣count of the remarkable coldness of its waters, and other qualities, made one of the rivers of hell. It flows from a lake antiently called Phi∣neus. Another remarkable lake is that formerly called Stymphalis, noted for the many ravenous birds that frequented it. The Morea is divided into four districts, viz. Saccania, or Romania Minor, Braccio de Mania, or Tzakonia, Belve∣dere, and Chiarenza, or Clarenza. The most noted mountains are Cyllene, Arcadia, the highest in all Peloponnesus; Menalus, also in Arcadia; and Nonacris, according to Pliny; Minthe, now Olino; and Taygetus, consisting of three ridges, at the foot of one of which stood Sparta. In the year 1715, the Turks made themselves masters of the whole Morea, expelling the Venetians, and have ever since been in pos∣session of it. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Corinth, or Corinto, by the Turks called Ge∣reme, antiently one of the finest cities of Greece, stands within the isthmus, near that called the bay of Corinth, which is part of the gulph of Lepanto. It looks now much more like a village than a town or city, yet is the see of a Greek archbishop. A mile from the town to the south∣ward, on a high craggy hill, stands the castle, whose walls are about two miles in compass, and from which there is one of the finest prospects in the world; for on the right-hand one beholds the Saronic gulph, or gulph of Egina, with all the little islands strewed up and down within it, and some of those of the Archipelago: on the left-hand appear the gulph of Lepanto, or Corinth, with a range of mountains to the north of it, and the isthmus to the south, as far as Athens. That called Corinthian brass is said to have been pro∣duced by the melting and mixing of a vast num∣ber
<PB N="145" REF="1490"/>
of statues and images of gold, silver, and brass, when the city was burnt down by the Ro∣man general A. Luc. Mummius. The singular decorations of the pillars, cornices, and pedestals, in its antient stately edifices, gave rise to the ap∣pellation of the Corinthian order. There were many christians here in St. Paul's time, as ap∣pears from the epistles addressed to them by that apostle. Incontinency was so much in vogue, and prostitutes so much esteemed in it formerly, that not only marks of honour and respect were bestowed on them, but public prayers were offered to Venus for their preservation and increase. Its present low state is partly owing to its being so much exposed to the descents of the Corsans. In consequence of its situation betwixt the Ionian and Aegean seas, on each of which it had a har∣bour, and from which it derived the epithet of Bimaris, it antiently carried on a vast trade, and became very rich and powerful, and at the same time, as usual, luxurious, dissolute, proud, and insolent; whereby, at last, its grandeur was laid in the dust.</P>
<P>Patras, in Latin Patrae, a small town about thirty-eight miles from Corinth to the west, near the gulph which lies between the coast of the Morea, and the island of Cefalonia, and to which it gives name. It is the see of an archbishop, and has a castle. Here was antiently a temple dedicated to Diana, with an altar on which hu∣man sacrifices used to be offered. The whole number of the inhabitants, Turks, Jews, and Greeks, is said to be about four or five thousand souls. Their trade consists in raw-silk, leather, honey, wax, cheese, and currants.</P>

<P>Belvedere, seated on the spot where the antient capital of Elis stood, on the banks of the river Peneus, forty miles from Patras to the south-west.</P>
<P>Modon, antiently Mathone, a considerable town on the southern shore of the Morea, over-against the isle of Sapienza. It is the residence of the governor of the Morea, and a bishop's see; hath also a harbour, and a pretty good trade.</P>
<P>Coron, one of the strongest and most consi∣derable places in the Morea, seventeen miles from Modon towards the east, on the south side of a gulph, to which it gives name. It was antiently called Corone, and its trade consists in fruits, grain, oil, and silks.</P>
<P>Navarin, antiently Pylus, a fortified town on the sea, about seven miles from Modon to the north west. It has some trade, with two castles, and one of the best and most capacious harbours in the Morea.</P>
<P>Malvesia, the antient Epidaurus, seated on the eastern coast of the Morea, near the mouth of the Golfo de Neapoli. It is very strong, has a pretty good harbour, and is noted for the luscious wine, called from the town, Malvoisia, or Mal∣voisie, whence we have formed our name Malm∣sey</P>
<P>Misitra, the antient Lacedemon or Sparta, situ∣ated on the river Eurotas, or Basilipotamo, thirty miles from its mouth. The town consists of two spacious streets, and several cross ones, which are very narrow. It has a strong castle on the top of
<PB N="147" REF="1510"/>
the mountain, antiently called Taygitus, and is the see of an archbishop. There are some remains of the temple of Minerva, Helena, Hercules, Venus Armata, and of the portico built in memory of the victory gained by the Greeks over the Persians at Plateae. Here is an hospital the best endowed of any in Turkey; provisions are daily distri∣buted to the poor, and the sick are extremely well taken care of: Moors, Turks, Jews, and Christians, are all equally welcome here; even dogs and birds have their allowance. There are two karavanserais for travellers in Mischa. On the north side of the town is a hill covered with vineyards, which, it is said, were propagated from the vine planted by Ulysses, when he went to Lacedemon in search of Penelope. Not far hence is a district surrounded with mountains, and inhabited by a people called Mainotte, from Maina, the chief place in it, who are said to be the descendants of the antient Lacedemonians, and so brave, that they have never been con∣quered, or made tributary to the Turks.</P>
<P>Langanico, supposed to be the antient Olym∣pia, near which were celebrated every fifth year the Olympic games, and where was a fine temple of Jupiter Olympus, with a grove dedicated to him, and a colossal statue of him, reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world, is now dwindled into an inconsiderable place, seated on the river Alpheus, ten miles from Belvedere to the south. From the games antiently celebrated, the compu∣tation of time in Greece by Olympiads took its rise.</P>
<P>Napoli di Romania, in Latin Neapolis, antiently Nauplia, a strong town, with a good harbour, and a considerable trade in corn, wine, oil, silks, cotton, and tobacco. It is at the extremity of a gulph, now named from it, and antiently called
<PB N="148" REF="1520"/>
Argolicus Sinus, thirty-six miles from Corinth to the south. The other places in the Morea worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Argos, formerly a splendid city, but now a mean place, on the river Najo, or Inachus.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Islands on the Coast of GREECE, in the ARCHIPELAGO, and LEVANT Seas.</HEAD>
<P>OF these islands there are many so small, that they are hardly worth mentioning. Of such we shall take little notice; but confine our attention chiefly to the more considerable, begin∣ning from the north with those belonging to the Venetians, on the coast of Greece.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CORFU,</HEAD>
<P>Antiently called Phaeacia and Corcyra, lies near the mouth of the Adriatic-sea, on the coast of Albania. It is about one hundred and twenty miles in circumference, and to take its present name from the antient castle of Corypho, which was so called from its being built on a sharp pointed hill, styled in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is a very healthy and well inhabited island, containing two cities, and above one hundred villages, some of them pretty large, populous, and wealthy. The soil is not the same all over the island, the southern part being barren, mountainous, and destitute of water; but the northern very fertile in all kinds of delicious fruits, excellent wine, grain, olives, &amp;c. Its two cities are Corfu and Cas∣sopo, which is the Cassiope of the antients. The Venetians have been in possession of it ever since the year 1386; and as it is esteemed the key of the Adriatic, they constantly keep a fleet of gal∣lies and other ships in the harbour of Corfu, which is one of the strongest places on all these coasts. The garrison consists of ten thousand
<PB N="150" REF="1540"/>
men, and the governor, or proveditore, has the command of all the other Venetian isles on this coast. The island furnishes Venice with vast quantities of salt and cedar, besides its other pro∣duce. It is governed, like the other islands subject to Venice, by a balio, proveditore, capitano, and castellano, who are noble Venetians; as is also the archbishop, who is primate and metropolitan of all these islands. The gardens of Alcinous, king of Phoeacia, are much celebrated by Homer in his Odyssey.</P>
<P>Betwixt Corfu and Cephalonia lie several small islands, as Pachsu and Antipachsu, antiently Paxi, or Paxae; Curzolari, formerly the Echi∣nades, among which Strabo reckons Dulichium, once a part of Ulysses's dominions; Val de Com∣pare, the antient Ithaca, noted for being the country of Ulysses; and Santa Maura, antiently called Niritis and Leucas, and noted for a mag∣nificent temple of Venus.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CEPHALONIA</HEAD>
<P>By most geographers is said to be larger than Corfu, being about one hundred and thirty, or one hundred and forty miles in circumference. It is very fruitful in red wines, Muscadel grapes, currants, oil, citrons, oranges, pomegranates, and grain; and abounds in a variety of rare me∣dicinal plants and flowers, from which they pre∣pare several liquors of the finest flavour. Most of the trees bear twice a year, namely in April and November. The principal places in it are Cephalonia, Argostoli, and Asso. The first is the capital, and a bishop's see; the second is the principal port of the island, and the residence of the proveditore, or governor; and the third a strong sortress. The island is very mountainous,
<PB N="151" REF="1550"/>
and inhabited chiefly by Greeks, who pay a tri∣bute to the republic.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ZANTE,</HEAD>
<P>Formerly called Zacynthus, lies about twelves miles south of Cephalonia. It is reckoned about fifty miles in circumference, and to contain above fifty thousand inhabitants. Zante, the capital, is said to have about twenty-five thousand souls. The island is very subject to earth∣quakes, and almost every where environed with mountains. It produces plenty of strong wines, currants, melons, raisins, oil, figs, and corn, with which and salt a great trade is carried on. The inhabitants are mostly Greeks. The English and Dutch have a factory and consul here. Raisins and currants are very fine and cheap in this island, and great quantities of them are exported, especially to England. The me∣lons and peaches also are in high request, of a prodigious bigness, and exquisite flavour. All ships coming from the Levant perform quarantine at this island, as well as at Venice. Near Chiari, a sea-port town, are two springs of fresh and clear water, which throw up pieces of real pitch. The people are said to get about one hundred barrels of it one year with another, which they use to pay their ships and other vessels with. The ladies here, when they go abroad, wear all black masks.</P>
<P>South from Zante, on the coast of the Morea, lie two clusters of small islands, the one called an∣tiently Strophades, from their supposed circumvo∣lution, and now Strivali; the other Le Sapienze, and formerly the Sphagi islands.</P>

<HEAD>CERIGO,</HEAD>
<P>Formerly called Cythera, and consecrated to Venus, lies betwixt Candia and the Morea, and belongs to the Venetians. It is rocky and moun∣tainous, producing little corn, wine, or oil; but abounding in sheep, and fowl, both wild and tame. Its circumference is about sixty miles, and its principal town lies on the south side of the island.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CANDIA,</HEAD>
<P>Called antiently Crete and Hecatompolis from its hundred cities, is one of the largest islands in the Mediterranean, being about two hundred miles long and sixty broad. Its situation is very advantageous, lying about fifty miles from Cape St. Angelo in the Morea, and about four hundred from Egypt and Natolia, or the Lesser Asia. The air was so wholesome and temperate, that it was formerly on that account called Macaronesus, i. e. the Fortunate Island; but the south wind is now said to be dangerous, and often suffocates people in the open air. As to the soil, a great part of it is barren, rocky, and mountainous; but the vil∣lages are full of vine-trees, olivet-rees myrtles, laurels, oranges, lemons, intermingled with other fruits, and corn fields. Also silk, wool, honey, and wax, abound here; as well as game, wild fowl, and tame animals of all kinds: but there are no stags, rabbits, or wild beasts. Their wines, both red and white, are of an exquisite flavour. The inhabitants are a mixture of Turks, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians; but a great part of the country lies waste. There are no considerable rivers in the island; Lethe is one of the largest streams. Above half the island is taken up with
<PB N="153" REF="1570"/>
barren mountains, the largest of which is mount Ida, covered a great part of the year with snow. The only thing it produces is the tragacantha, or buck∣thorn, famous for its gum. The quince-tree was originally brought from Cydonia, in this island, to Italy, and, on that account, was called by the Romans Malus Cydonia. Crete was once a king∣dom, and Minos one of its most celebrated kings and lawgivers. The antient Cretans were very expert at the bow and sling; and even those of the present times are said to be very fond of archery. As to morals, they had but a very indifferent character in former times. St. Paul quotes this passage from one of their own poets: "The Cre∣tans are always liars, evil beasts, and slow bellies." They are stigmatized by other authors for their lasciviousness, and their want of honour and pro∣bity. The present race, as Mr. Tournefort in∣forms us, are not quite so bad: he says there are no beggars, pickpockets, cut-throats, nor robbers in the island; but that the Turks there are mostly renegadoes, a profligate set of men, who get nothing more in exchange for their religion than the privilege of wearing a vest, and of be∣ing exempt from the capitation-tax, which is not above five crowns a-year. In 1644 the Turks made a descent here; and after besieging Candia the capital twenty years, reduced the whole island, except a few forts, which were afterwards taken. They have ever since been in possession of it, and govern it by a beiglerbeg. We now proceed to describe the principal places.</P>
<P>Candia, the capital, standing on the ruins of He∣raclea, supposed to be the same with Matium, is situated on a bay of the sea, about the middle of the north side of the island. It suffered so much by the long siege in the last century, that it is now little better than a desert, excepting the
<PB N="154" REF="1580"/>
market-place, and a few streets about it, where the principal inhabitants live. In the time of the Venetians it was well peopled, flourishing in trade, and very strong. It had once a good har∣bour, but it is now almost choaked up, and only navigable for boats. With regard to the above∣mentioned siege, the Turks invested the town in the beginning of the year 1645; the garrison held out till the latter end of September 1669, and surrendered at last upon honourable terms, after they had been stormed fifty-six times. The Venetians lost upwards of eighty thousand men, and the Turks above one hundred and eighty thousand, during the siege. The inhabitants now consist of Greeks, who have an archbishop, Jews, Turks, Armenians, and a few French families, with a vice-consul, and some capuchin friars. The Turks are mostly soldiers of the garrison. About five or six miles from this city, towards the south, lies Mount Ida, now called Psilonti, and at the foot of it a little hill, in which is the famous labyrinth, which seems to be a work of nature, and only a vast subterraneous cavern, branching out into a thousand intricate windings. When travellers visit it, they always provide themselves with guides and torches, otherwise they would be in great danger of losing their way. The place is quite dry; not the least water-fall, congelation, nor drain to be seen. Tho' this is generally supposed to be the antient Cretan laby∣rinth, yet it is far from being satisfactorily proved.</P>
<P>Canea, a pretty good town, standing, as is ge∣nerally supposed, on the ruins of the antient Cy∣donia, and on the northern coast. The port would be a good one if it was not too much ex∣posed to the north-wind. The houses here, as every where else in the Levant, are very indiffe∣rent;
<PB N="155" REF="1590"/>
the best are but two stories high, of which the first, that is the ground-floor, serves for a parlour, ware-house, cellar, and stable. The neigh∣bouring country is very pleasant, being adorned with forests of high olive trees, diversified with corn fields, vine-yards, flower-gardens, and delightful streams, shaded with myrtle and laurel. The olives never die in Candia, because it never freezes in that island.</P>
<P>Retimo, antiently Rethymna, or Rethymnia, stands on the north coast, twenty-six miles from Candia to the west. It has a citadel and a har∣bour, in which men of war used formerly to be laid up, but at present there is hardly depth enough for small craft.</P>
<P>Gorlyna, antiently a most famous city, but now only a village, about six miles from Mount Ida, and not far from Candia, remarkable for its stately ruins still visible. Among these ruins runs a small river or brook, which can be no other than the antient Lethe. The plain of Mes∣soria in this neighbourhood is so exceeding fertile, that it is justly accounted the granary of the whole island.</P>
<P>Spina-longa, a fortress situated thirty miles from Candia towards the east, on a gulph to which it gives name, otherwise called the gulph of Mirabel, where is the best harbour in the whole island.</P>
<P>Settia, a fortified town on the northern coast, forty-three miles from Spina-Longa, antiently Cythaeum.</P>
<P>Grossus, an antient city, where Minos kept his court, and where the tomb of Jupiter is said to have been, is supposed to have stood about the middle of the island, twenty-four or thirty miles from Candia, towards the east.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="1600"/>
There are several small islands lying about Can∣dia, viz.</P>
<P>Gotzo, formerly Gaudos, and Claudos, now belonging to the order of Malta.</P>
<P>Gaiduronisia-Christina, antiently Letoa.</P>
<P>Standia, formerly Dia.</P>
<P>Scarpanto, the antient Carpathus.</P>
<P>Stampala, formerly Astypalex, where was once a town and the celebrated temple of Apollo.</P>
<P>Namphio, whose inhabitants are all Greeks, and which abounds in fine springs of water, honey, wax, and partridges.</P>
<P>Santorin, i. e. Sant-Erini, from St. Irene its patroness. This island was antiently called Calista, or the handsome island.</P>
<P>Thera is about thirty miles to the north of Can∣dia, and nearly thirty-six in circumference. Tho' it consists entirely of pumice-stone, with a thin surface, yet it is very fertile in barley, wine, cot∣ton, and produces also some wheat. The inha∣bitants are about ten thousand, and all Greeks; but some of them are of the Latin, and many of the Greek church. According to the accounts of the antients it rose in a violent earthquake out of the sea, which is here of such depth that it is un∣fathomable.</P>
<P>Several small isles in its neighbourhood have in like manner since emerged from the sea.</P>

<HEAD>ISLANDS in the ARCHI∣PELAGO.</HEAD>
<P>THE many large and small islands in this sea were comprized by antient geographers under two general names. Those which form a kind of circle round Delos were called Cyclades; but those which lie farther off, and are scattered all over the Archipelago, had the name of Spo∣rades, i. e. The Scattered Islands. Of the most remarkable in these divisions, and also of Cyprus and Rhodes, we shall here give a short account, be∣ginning with the Cyclades, which lie between Can∣dia on the south and Negropont on the north.</P>
<P>Policandro, lying about twelve miles from San∣torini towards the north-west, is a small rocky island, about eight miles in compass. All the in∣habitants live in a village three miles from the sea-side, in which are two convents and three well built churches. From the castle, which stands on a high-hill, one may see all the isles of the Archipelago. The produce of the island is barley, cotton, sheep, and fowls; and its manufactures, bread, stuffs, and cheese. Both men and women are said to be courteous to strangers, especially the latter, who are very handsome.</P>
<P>Milo, antiently Melos, a small island, about sixty miles in compass, but well peopled and cul∣tivated, with one of the largest and most commo∣dious havens in the Mediterranean. It is every where mountainous, except a fine plain of six or seven miles in length, in the midst of which is the city of Mello, or Milo, the capital of the island. Both the Latins and Greeks have a bishop and ca∣thedral here; but the numbers of the former bear
<PB N="158" REF="1620"/>
no proportion to that of the latter. A great part of the island may be compared to a spongy, po∣rous rock, impregnated with iron, alum, and sul∣phur, which being heated by the friction of the sea-water, occasion those violent earthquakes to which it is subject. On the coast are many grot∣tos or caves incrusted with a variety of salts of different colours, and others so full of sulphur, and so hot, that there is no entering them. The iron mines here are very advantageous, and the soil very fertile, yielding plenty of grain, exqui∣site fruits, especially grapes, melons, and figs; with honey, flesh, fowl, game, and fish: but the air is none of the most wholesome. There are se∣veral hot baths and springs, and one that is purga∣tive, in this island, which belongs to the Venetians.</P>
<P>Argentiere, formerly Cimolis, is a small island near Milo, rocky and mountainous, but contain∣ing some silver mines, which, however, are said to be entirely neglected. There is but one village in the island, inhabited chiefly by women, who subsist by their commerce with pirates and corsairs. Cimoli-earth is a kind of clay found here, and used for washing and bleaching of linen.</P>
<P>Siphanto, or Siphno, formerly Siphnus, Mero∣pia, and Acis, lies towards the north-east of Ar∣gentiere, and is thirty-six miles in circuit, accord∣ing to Mr. Thevenot. There are several good harbours in it, together with five or six villages, inhabited mostly by Greeks, a castle, four con∣vents of monks, two of nuns, and above five hundred chapels. It is one of the most fruit∣ful and best improved islands in the Archipelago, yielding corn, excellent water, fruit, wild fowl, and poultry, and enjoying a very wholesome air. There were formerly rich gold and lead mines; but if there are any now, they are not worked. The grapes here are very well tasted, but the wines
<PB N="159" REF="1630"/>
are somewhat harsh. Of marble and granite, figs, onions, wax, honey, sesamum, cotton, oils, and capers, there is plenty in this isle. The manufac∣tures are straw hats and callicoes. It produces only a small quantity of silk, but it is very good.</P>
<P>Paros is one of the least of the Cyclades, situate between the islands of Naxia and Milo. It is well cultivated, yielding corn, cattle, barley, wine, pulse, sesamum, cotton, and game. There are some good roads and harbours in it, several vil∣lages, a great many churches and chapels, and no less than sixteen monasteries. The chief town is Parechia, built on the ruins of the antient Paros, in the walls of which are fine marble columns ly∣ing at length; and all over the town are architraves, pedestals, and other exquisite pieces of carved mar∣ble, the remains of antient Paros. This island was formerly dedicated to Bacchus on account of the excellent wines it produced. Every one knows how famous the white Parian marble was of old, and those inimitable statuaries, Phidias and Praxi∣tiles, who were natives of this isle, and who gave life, in a manner, to all the statues they wrought, some of which became the objects of divine wor∣ship. Those valuable marbles with Greek inscrip∣tions, called the Arundelian marbles, because they were purchased in the year 1667, by the earl of Arundel, and afterwards presented to the university of Oxford, were brought from this island. On them are engraved the most noted Greek epochs from the reign of Cecrops, the foun∣der of the Athenian monarchy, to Diognetes, the magistrate, that is to say, during a course of above three hundred years. The Panagia, or Madonia, without the town of Parechia, is said to be the largest and most splendid church in the Archipelago.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="1640"/>
Antiparos, lying about two miles from Paros to the west, is a rock, about sixteen miles in circuit, inhabited by about sixty or seventy Greek families, who live altogether in a village, a mile from the sea. The produce of it is chiefly barley, and its port is navigable only for boats. Here is a great curiosity, namely a natural and very deep grotto, in which a great variety of figures have been formed by the vegetation of the stones, which are of a white transparent chrystalline kind of marble.</P>
<P>Naxia, antiently Naxos, five miles from Pa∣ros to the east, and about eighty in circumference, is the most fertile island in the Archipelago, yielding orange, olive, lemon, cedar, citron, pomegranate, fig, mulberry, and apple-trees, with excellent wine. The inhabitants, who are partly of the Greek and partly of the Latin church, amount to about eight thousand, inhabiting be∣tween forty and fifty villages, and one town, which stands on the south side of the island, and is de∣fended by a castle. There is no good port in Naxia; yet they carry on a considerable traffic in barley, wine, figs, cotton, silk, flax, cheese, salt, oxen, sheep, mules, and oil. Some of the moun∣tains also yield emery. There are several monas∣teries both Greek and Latin here, not a few churches.</P>
<P>Nio, antiently called Ios, from the Ionians, its first inhabitants, is nine miles from Naxia to the south, and about forty in circumference. It pro∣duces scarce any thing but corn; but has some convenient harbours, and its inhabitants are reckon∣ed good seamen. In this isle is said to be Homer's tomb. That famous poet passing from Samos to Athens, put in at Ios, and died in the port.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="1650"/>
Amorgo, or Morgo, antiently Amorgos, lies to the east of Nio, and is about thirty-six miles in compass. It yields oil enough for its inhabitants, and plenty of corn and wine. There are some good harbours, with a small town, and a large convent in the isle.</P>
<P>Delos, which stands in the centre of the Cy∣clades to the north of Paros, is not above seven or eight miles in circuit. This isle, though now deserted, was antiently the most resorted to of any, on account of its being the place of Apollo's and Diana's nativity, to whom most magnificent tem∣ples were erected, public festivals instituted, priests, sacrifices, and choirs of virgins maintained at the expence of all the Grecian cities on the continent, as well as of the islands in the Archipelago.</P>
<P>Mycone, lying near Delos, to the east, is thirty-six miles in circuit. It has a town of the same name on the west of the island, containing about three thousand souls. The inhabitants are said to be the best sailors in the Archipelago, and carry on a good trade, especially in wine and hides, having above one hundred barks, besides forty or fifty saicks. The island yields barley enough for the inhabitants, with abundance of figs and some olives; but there is a scarcity of water, especially in summer. Of churches and chapels here is a great number, with several monasteries. The dress of the women in this island is very remarka∣ble, and as different from that of the other islands as that of those islanders is different from the dress of the other European ladies. Their heads are adorned with lively coloured turbans; their gar∣ments are a short white shift plaited before and behind, which reaches to their knees; they have white linen drawers, and red, green, yellow, or blue stockings, with various coloured slippers.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="1660"/>
Tine, formerly Tenos, or Tinos, Hydrussa, Ophiusa, is very populous, and produces excel∣lent fruit, wine, and silk. It is about thirty-five miles in compass, and is parted from Andros only by a small channel of about a mile in breadth.</P>
<P>Andros, which lies between Tenos and Negro∣pont, about one hundred and twenty miles in circuit, is a very pleasant isle, well watered, and planted with orange, lemon, citron, fig-trees, &amp;c. It yields also wine, oil, silk, barley, and some wheat. Besides a town of the same name with the island, there are twenty-six villages, two of which are inhabited by Albanians. Port Gau∣rio is the best in the whole isle. The inhabitants are all of the Greek persuasion.</P>
<P>Zia, or Zea, the antient Ceos, or Cos, lying to the south-west of Andros, takes its name from the ruins of a small town which stands near the remains of the antient Carthaea. The harbour lies to the north-west, and is capable of receiving the largest ships. The island is fruitful and well cultivated, abounding in barley, wine, silk, cat∣tle, and velani, which is the fruit of a species of oak, much used by dyers and tanners. It yields also lead like that of Siphanto, and chalk like that of Briancon in Dauphine. The ruins of other cities besides those of Carthaea are still vi∣sible here. The Greeks have many churches and chapels, and several monasteries in this isle.</P>
<P>Joura, antiently Gyarus, Gyara, or Gyarae, is a barren desolate isle, lying to the east of Zea, and about twelve miles in compass. Hither the Romans used to banish delinquents.</P>
<P>Thermia, antiently Cythnus, Ophiusa, and Dryopis, lies to the south-east of Zea. Its soil is very good, yielding barley, wine, honey, figs, wax, silk, with some wheat and cotton, but hardly any cil. There are two villages in it, one of
<PB N="163" REF="1670"/>
which gives name to the island. Both contain about sixteen thousand souls, all of the Greek re∣ligion, except about a dozen Latin families, se∣veral monasteries, and a great many churches and chapels. There are also two good harbours in the island, with many hot springs, from which it had the name of Thermia.</P>
<P>The islands described above are the chief of the Cyclades. Of the others the most considera∣ble are the following:</P>
<P>Engia, or rather Aegina, antiently Oeone and Myrmidonia, lies in the gulph to which it gives name, antiently called Sinus Saronicus, from the river Saron, about ten miles from the coast of the Morea. It is about thirty miles in circumference, and fruitful in corn, cotton, honey, wax, and al∣monds; but has no harbours, and only one half∣ruined town, which gives name to the island. From its castle, which stands high, is a very beautiful prospect. Its antient inhabitants were so industrious, that they were stiled myrmidons, i. e. ants.</P>
<P>Colouri, antiently Salamis, lies towards the bottom of the gulph of Engia, about a mile from the promontory of Attica, called Amphiala. It is about fifty miles in compass, and has a spacious harbour on the west side. Of the three villages in it, one is called Colouri and gives name to the island. Near the ancient city of Salamus, The∣mistocles obtained a great victory over the Per∣sians. There is another small island in the gulph, now called Porus, and antiently Calabraea. It is about eighteen miles in compass, and inhabited by Albanians. It was to this isle that the great orator Demosthenes was banished. The gulph of Aegina, in which these isles lie, is said to be thirty-six miles broad at its mouth, and sixty in depth of length.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="1680"/>
Negropont, antiently Euboea, stretches along the eastern coast of Achaia or Livadia, from which it is separated by a narrow channel, called the Euripus. It is about ninety miles long, and twenty-five broad in the widest part, producing corn, wine, oil, fruit and cattle in great abundance. It is thought to have been formerly joined to the con∣tinent of Greece by an isthmus, as it is now by a bridge near the capital. The Turks made them∣selves masters of this island in the year 1470, un∣der sultan Mahomet II. The tides in the Euripus are sometimes regular, and at others irregular, according to the age of the moon. From the three last days of the old moon to the eighth day of the new moon, and from the fourteenth to the twentieth inclusively, they are regular; but on the other days they are irregular, flowing twelve, thirteen, or fourteen times in twenty-four hours, and ebbing as often. The only places in the island worth our notice are, Negropont and Castel Rosso. The first, called by the Greeks Egripos, stands on the south-west coast of the island, and the narrow∣est part of the strait, near where Chalcis was an∣tiently situate. The town is walled and inhabited only by Turks and Jews, who, with the christians in the suburbs, are said to amount to about fifteen thousand; but the christians are much more nu∣merous than the infidels. The captain-bassa, or admiral of Turkey, who is also governor of the city, the island, and the adjacent continent of Greece, resides here; and the harbour, which is very safe and spacious, is seldom without a fleet of gallies, ready to put to sea against the pirates and the Maltese. A part of the bridge, betwixt the city and the coast of Greece, consists of a draw∣bridge no larger than just to let a galley pass through.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="1690"/>
Castel Rosso, antiently called Carystus, or Ca∣ryste, is a considerable city, with a good harbour at the foot of Mount Oche, fifty-five miles from Negropont to the south-east. A little to the north-east of it, is the cape antiently called Ca∣phareum, and now Capo Figarea, which is so sur∣rounded with rocks that it is dangerous for ships to come near it. The most southern point of this island is called Capo d'Oro, or Capo Chimi.</P>
<P>Scyro, antiently Scyros, lies about twenty-five miles from Negropont towards the north-east, and was so named from its barren rugged rocks. It is about sixty miles in circumference, having a little town of the same name with it, a safe harbour, several villages, and some quar∣ries of marble. Pallas was antiently patroness of this island, and had a magnificent temple in it.</P>
<P>Stalimene, antiently Lemnos, lies in the north part of the Aegean sea, over-against the strait of the Dardanelles. It is of a square form, and each side about twenty-five miles. Here is plenty of corn and wine; but the commodity for which the island is most noted, is the mineral earth called <HI>terra lemnia,</HI> and <HI>terra sigillata,</HI> from a seal the Turks put upon every piece that is sold to fo∣reigners; it is said to have great virtues in heal∣ing wounds, expelling poisons, stopping fluxes, &amp;c. It is found in a particular mountain. A certain quantity is dug up every year, and put into hair-bags, some of which are sent to the grand signior, and the rest marked with his seal, or with these two words, <HI>tin imachton,</HI> that is, the sealed earth, and sold by the sangiack, or his deputy, to the inhabitants and foreign merchants. The sangiack must account to the sultan's treasury for the money produced from it, and the inhabi∣tants are capitally punished if they clandestinely dig, use, or sell any of it. The chief town, now
<PB N="166" REF="1700"/>
of the same name with the island, but antiently called Myrina, stands on the western shore; and oppo∣site to it, on the eastern, is Cochino, formerly Hephestias. The island was heretofore sacred to Vulcan, whom the inhabitants worshipped as their patron. According to the poets he fell into it when he was kicked out of heaven by Juno for a deformed brat, and was lamed in his fall, whence he was called Limnius. There are two high mountains here that are volcanos, and probably gave occasion to the fable and worship of Vulcan.</P>
<P>Samondrachi, antiently Samothrace, i. e. the country of the Thracians, lies not far from the coast of Romania, to the north of Lemnos. It is about twenty miles in circuit, and pretty well cultivated. The town, of the same name with the island, stands on a high mountain command∣ing a prospect of its spacious harbour. Certain deities, called Cabiri, were held in high venera∣tion here in antient times.</P>
<P>Embro, or Lembro, antiently Imbros, lying be∣tween Samondrachi and Stalimene, is mountain∣ous and woody. Of the four villages in it, one bears the same name as the island.</P>
<P>Thassus, or Thasos, a small island to the west of Samondrachi, in the gulph of Contessa. There is a small town of the same name with the island on the north side of it. Here is excellent wine and marble, and antiently there were rich gold mines.</P>
<P>Macronisi, that is, the Long Island, lies be∣tween Joura and Zea. It is barren and uninha∣bited, and was antiently called Helena, Macris, and Cranae.</P>
<P>Syra, formerly Syros, lies between Zea and Delos. The inhabitants are mostly Roman ca∣tholics. The town of Syra has a good harbour, and near it are the ruins of the antient Syros.

The island is fertile, producing plenty of wheat, barley, wine, figs, cotton, and olives.</P>
<P>Serpho, or Serphanto, antiently Seriphus, lies near Thermia to the south. It abounds in mines of iron and load-stone, and produces great quan∣tities of onions, but little else. Hither the Ro∣mans used to banish the vilest malefactors.</P>
<P>Sikino, a small island near Nio, produces plenty of figs, and the best wheat in the Archipe∣lago. There is a little town of the same name with the isle.</P>

<HEAD>ISLANDS on the COAST of LESSER ASIA.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may describe the islands lying on those seas all together, we now proceed to the rest of them, notwithstanding they are gene∣rally reckoned a part of the Lesser Asia, as being situate on the coasts thereof.</P>
<P>We shall take them, or at least the most con∣siderable of them, as they lie from north to south, beginning with</P>
<P>Tenedos, which lies about two leagues from the coast of the Lesser Phrygia, over-against the ruins of Old Troy. The Turks call it now Bos∣chiada, or Boschiadasi, i. e. the barren island. It is indeed very rocky, but contains many val∣leys, with one pretty large town of the same name with this island, inhabited mostly by Greeks, and having a harbour defended by two castles. It was behind this island that the Greeks retired, when they made a feint of abandoning the siege of
<PB N="168" REF="1720"/>
Troy. Under the Roman emperors of the east, it was made a repository of corn, brought from Alexandria for Constantinople. They pretend here to shew the tombs of Marpesia, queen of the Amazons, and of that renowned hero Achil∣les. The Muscadine wines produced here are greatly extolled.</P>
<P>Lesbos, or Mytilene, now called by the Greeks Metelin, and Metelino, is a large island, south∣ward of Tenedos, over-against the coast of Ly∣dia. It is but thinly inhabited, though in gene∣ral pretty fruitful, producing plenty of corn, wine, fruit, especially the best figs in the Archipe∣lago, and abounding in cattle, and a breed of small, but strong, swift horses. Several of the mountains are covered with pines and other trees. There are about ten thousand Turks, and twice as many Greeks, on the island.</P>
<P>Castro, or Castri, the capital, antiently Myti∣lene, is situate on the east side of the island, and hath an excellent harbour, defended by a strong castle, in which is kept a constant garrison. In many parts of the island are still to be seen broken columns, chapiters, bases, friezes, &amp;c. of the finest marble, curiously wrought, and interspersed with inscriptions. There are several other good harbours and creeks in the island, besides that of Castro; but they are mostly haunted by the pi∣rates that infest those seas, notwithstanding there are gallies continually cruising against them. The chief trade of the island is in grain, wine, fruits, butter, cheese, and pitch. The tribute paid yearly to the grand signior is computed at eighteen thousand piastres. The inhabitants are so fleeced by their Turkish masters, that they are generally poor, and their houses low and meanly built. Of this isle Theophrastus and Phanios, disciples of Aristotle; Pittacus, one of the seven
<PB N="169" REF="1730"/>
wise men; and Sappho, the poetess, were na∣tives: as was also the famous Arion, said to have charmed the dolphin with his music. Epicurus read lectures here, and some say Aristotle; but notwithstanding so many philosophers and great men had resided among them, the natives, it seems, were a very profligate race, and remark∣able for their lewdness.</P>
<P>Chios, now Scio, and by the Turks Saki-sa∣duci, said, among other places, to have given birth to Homer, lies to the south of Lesbos, over∣against the coast of Ionia, and in the same lati∣tude with Smyrna. It is about one hundred miles in circumference, and though mostly mountain∣ous and stoney, is said to be very populous, and to produce plenty of corn, wine, oil, honey, fruits of all sorts, variety of gums, especially that called mastich, which issues from the lentisk-tree, and yields a vast profit to the inhabitants. The ma∣nufactures are chiefly those of silk. The Greeks are said to enjoy greater privileges here than any where else in the grand siegnior's dominions, and to be generally rich, and remarkably gay and merry. The women too are counted very handsome, witty, and extremely good-natured. The town of Scio is about two miles in circuit, adorned with pleasant gardens and orchards, neat houses, churches, and monasteries, but is neither lightsome, nor well paved. The port, though none of the best, is the rendezvous of all the ships that sail to Constantinople, or go from thence to Syria, Aegypt, &amp;c. The castle, or citadel, stands close to the sea, and has a garrison of four hundred men. Both town and castle lie on the east side of the island, about twelve miles from the Asiatic shore. There are about thirty villages besides, inhabited mostly by Greeks. All the mastich that is gathered is delivered to the grand
<PB N="170" REF="1740"/>
signior's officer at a certain price, and either sent to Constantinople, or sold to the merchants. Be∣sides other uses made of it, some chew it, and others mix it with their bread. The Turks in the island are computed at ten thousand, the Latins at two thousand, and the Greeks at near one hundred thousand. It is said to pay to the grand signior double tribute of any other in the Archi-Pelago. Near the town of Scio is a monastery of Greek monks or caloyers, whose revenue is said to amount to fifty thousand crowns a-year, out of which they pay five hundred per annum capita∣tion tax. The Turks look upon the Sciots as a fool∣ish kind of people, and it is a common saying among them, that it is as impossible to find a wise Sciot as a green horse. The Sciots are said to have been taught the culture of the vine by Oenepion, the son of Bacchus. Virgil and Horace mention the red wine made here as the best in Greece. The wine most esteemed is that of Mesta, whence the antients had their nectar. The inhabitants of the first rank pay ten crowns a-head per annum to the Porte, the next three crowns, and the mean∣est people two and a half. In this isle, were born Ion the tragic poet, Theopompus the historian, and Theocritus the sophist. The Chiots pretend that Homer was born here; and shew a place which they call Homer's school at the foot of mount Epos.</P>
<P>Samos is situated near the coast of the Lesser-Asia, forty miles south-east of Chios, and almost opposite to Ephesus. It is about thirty miles long, and fifteen broad, producing, tho' moun∣tainous, excellent Muscadine wine, silk, oil, fruits, honey, saffron, fine wool, a fine sort of onions and garlic, several minerals and drugs, a fine red bole, emery, oker, and a black insipid earth of great use in dying. A chain of mountains, con∣sisting
<PB N="171" REF="1750"/>
of white marble, but covered with a staple of good earth, runs thro' the island. Here are great remains of antiquity, particularly of the an∣tient city of Samos, and Juno's temple, patroness of the isle. Notwithstanding the fertility of the island, the inhabitants, who are only about twelve or fourteen thousand, are so oppressed by the Turks, and so infested with pirates, that they are very poor, and the greatest part of the land lies uncultivated. The capitation-tax amounts to a∣bout six thousand four hundred crowns, and the aga, who collects it, generally extorts the same sum, besides making himself heir to every Greek that dies without male issue, and seizing on all but the gardens, which are given to the daughters.</P>
<P>The chief town, or rather village, of the island, is that of Samo, called by the Turks Sussan. It stands on the south-east side, and has a good haven, but little frequented, by reason of the pirates that are continually hovering about the isle.</P>
<P>Vati, a poor town, consisting only of three hundred houses, meanly built, is the residence of the French vice-consul, and has the best harbour in the whole island.</P>
<P>Cora, another mean place, stands on the south side of the island, near the ruins of the antient Samos.</P>
<P>Juno, and Samia, the sybil, are said to have been natives of this island, as well as Pythagoras and Polycrates.</P>
<P>Icaria, now Nicaria, lies to the south of Scio. It is about seventy miles in compass, rocky, moun∣tainous, and has not so much as a tolerable harbour, consequently little commerce. The inhabitants, who are computed at about three thousand, are very poor. They breed a great number of sheep
<PB N="172" REF="1760"/>
and goats; the flesh of the latter has an exquisite flavour, from the aromatic plants they feed on, and is the principal food of the inhabitants. The isle is well supplied with fuel and water, but yields little corn; and that little the inhabitants grind in hand-mills, and bake on flat stones. It is said they commonly row along the coast in their long boats quite naked, and approach nearer the antient Greeks in their dialect than any of the other islands.</P>
<P>Patmos, Pathmos, Palmosa, now Patmosa, or Patino, a small island lying ten miles south-west of Nicaria, is one of the barrenest in the Archipe∣lago, without trees or herbage, or even a river or spring that is not dry in summer; but here are many convenient ports, which, however, are little frequented, except by corfairs. The mo∣nastery of St. John in the isle is a kind of citadel, built on the top of a high rock, and surrounded with stout walls, and high irregular towers. The building called the hermitage of the Apocalypse, depending on the convent, has a very mean ap∣pearance. It is situated also on a rock, between the monastery and port de la Scala. On the left of it is the grotto of St. John, the entrance of which is about seven feet high, with a square pillar in the middle. On the top they shew a cleft in the solid rock, thro' which they tell you the Holy Ghost dictated the Revelations that St. John wrote during his banishment, which happened in the reign of Domitian in the year 95. The monks in the monastery of St. John are about one hundred in number, who have a revenue of six thousand crowns per annum. Out of a parti∣cular veneration for St. John the Turks allow them the use of two bells. The women are said to be pretty, affable, and kind, and to exceed the men in number twenty to one.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="1770"/>
Claros, now Calamo, lies near Patmos, and is about forty miles round, but very mountainous. It was formerly dedicated to Apollo. There are two sea-ports in it, with a small town and castle of its name.</P>
<P>Leros, now Lera, or Oleron, a small isle on the north-west side of Claros, furnishes the neigh∣bouring country with aloes; but in other respects, is neither fertile nor populous, having but one small town, with a few straggling villages and monasteries.</P>
<P>Coos, Cos, now called by the Italians Lango, or Isola-longa, and by the Turks and Greeks Stanchio, lies about eighty miles south of Samos. Its circuit is about seventy miles, and its soil fruit∣ful, diversified with mountains and vallies, and yielding good pasture, rich wines, olives, with other fruit and timber trees, particularly turpen∣tine and cypress, besides a great variety of medi∣cinal, and other plants. Mr. Thevenot speaks of a cypress tree here of such vast extent, that two thousand men might shelter themselves under it. On the east side of the island is a town of the same name with it, large, well built, fortified, and inhabited. It has also a commodious haven, defended by a stout castle. Ships that go to and from Constantinople to Syria, Egypt, &amp;c. general∣ly touch here. About twelve miles from it, on the opposite coast, is a very strong castle, called Bodron. This isle was the birth-place of Hippo∣crates, the great physician, and of Appelles, who made the statue of Venus so much admired among the antients. In order to render that statue as perfect as possible, he is said to have assembled all the women of the island, and to have united all their finest features and lineaments in this one exquisite piece.</P>

Astipalea, now Stampala, lies to the south-west of Cos, about forty miles from the coast of Ana∣tolia.

Formerly there was a famous temple of Apollo in it.</P>
<P>Carpathus, now Scarpanto, lies far out at sea, between Crete and Rhodes. It is mountainous and barren, but has fine quarries of marble. There is only one town in it, which has the same name as the island, with a good haven. This isle formerly gave name to the Carpathean sea.</P>

<HEAD>RHODES</HEAD>
<P>Is about twenty miles south-west of the continent of the Lesser Asia, being about fifty miles long and twenty broad. It was antiently an island of great fame, particularly for its commerce, skill in navigation, maritime laws, and naval power. The air is serene and wholesome, and the soil fruitful, yielding good wine, fruit, and all man∣ner of provisions but corn, which is imported from the neighbouring continent. The knights of St. John of Jerusalem were a long time masters of this island, namely, from the year 1308 till the year 1523, when the Turks under Solyman the Magnificent reduced it, and obliged the knights to retire to Malta. It is now well inhabited, and makes as considerable a figure as the Turkish ty∣ranny will permit any place to do that is fallen under its yoke.</P>
<P>The city of Rhodes, capital of the island, stands on the north-east side of it. It is a handsome city, though much decayed from its antient lustre,
<PB N="175" REF="1790"/>
having a commodious port, its streets wide, strait, and well paved, one in particular with marble, and bazars or markets well furnished, with a triple wall and a castle, but both old and ruinous. A squadron of gallies is always kept here, com∣manded by a bey, to cruise against the corsairs. Here is also a dock and an arsenal, some handsome mosques and churches, the old palace of the grand-master, and the houses of many of the knights. At the mouth of the harbour stood an∣tiently that famous Colossus of brass, esteemed one of the wonders of the world, one foot being placed on one side of the harbour, and the other foot on the other side, so that ships passed between its legs. The face of the Colossus represented the sun, to whom it was dedicated. The height was one hundred and thirty-five feet, and it held in one hand a light-house for the direction of mari∣ners. Its thumbs were so large, that two men could hardly embrace them. The Rhodians were once the most considerable naval power in the Mediterranean, and instituted laws for the regu∣lation of navigation and commerce, called the Rhodian laws, by which maritime causes were decided in all the provinces of the Roman em∣pire. The neighbourhood of Rhodes is ex∣tremely fertile and pleasant, and the town itself is a common mart for all the merchandizes of the Mediterranean, and in particular for soap, cam∣blets, tapestry, wine, wax, cotton, raisins, silks, &amp;c. The inhabitants, notwithstanding, are so oppressed, that they are in general very poor.</P>

<HEAD>CYPRUS</HEAD>
<P>Is situated in the Levant-sea, opposite to the coast of Syria and Palestine, from which it is not above thirty miles distant; being about one hun∣dred and sixty long, and forty-six broad where widest. It is supposed by some to have obtained the name of Cyprus, from the great number of Cyprus trees in it; but by others from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, copper, on account of some mines it had formerly of that metal. Richard I. king of England, made a conquest of this isle, ann. 1101, in his way to the Holy Land, and gave the royalty of it to Guy of Lusignan, then titular king of Jerusalem. The Venetians possessed themselves of it anno 1480; but were dispossessed about the middle of the 16th century by the Turks, under whose yoke it hath ever since groaned. The air is excessive hot and sultry in summer, insomuch that it sometimes dries up all the springs. At that season also the country is much infested with lo∣custs, which sometimes devour all their corn and fruit. The soil, where duly cultivated, is very fruitful, producing corn, wine, oil, cotton, wool, silk, and a great variety of gaine. There is a bird, about the size of a lark, of which great quantities are caught, especially in the months of September and October. Some thousand bar∣rels of these, pickled with vinegar and salt, are sent every year to Venice, and sold for ready money. Their best wines are produced at the foot of mount Olympus. They had formerly sugar-canes, but they have been all destroyed by the Turks. There are no considerable rivers in the island. Of its mountains the most noted is Olympus, which is of an extraordinary height and extent. Their manufactures are chiefly those of wool,
<PB N="177" REF="1810"/>
cotton, and silk. The wool is said to be the best in all the East. The traffic of the island is very considerable, consuls from most European nations residing there. While Cyprus was in the hands of the Christians it was well peopled, having eight hundred or one thousand villages; but it is so thinly inhabited at present, that half the lands lie uncultivated. The present inhabitants are Turks, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, with some few Latin Christians, Cophts, Maronites, and Nestorians, who have all the free exercise of their religion, and their separate churches. Christia∣nity was planted here by St. Paul, and his con∣stant companion Barnabas. The last of these is said to have been a native of the island, as also the famed poet Asclepiades, the philosophers Zeno, Apollonius, Xenophon, Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis, and other great men. The island was antiently dedicated to Venus, from thence called Venus Cypria, and Dea Cypri. The inha∣bitants, like the deity they worshipped, are re∣presented as having been very lewd and lascivious; insomuch that the women esteemed it an act of religion to prostitute themselves to foreigners. The government of Cyprus at present is vested in a beiglerbeg, who has under him five sangiacs, forty ziamets, and one thousand sixty-seven tima∣riots. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Nicosia, the metropolis, and seat of the vice∣roy, as it was formerly of its kings. It was an∣tiently called Leucosia, and was once very large, but is now reduced to a circuit of about three miles. However, it is still a handsome town, and the see of a Greek archbishop, standing in a good air, and a fruitful soil; but the fortifications have been long neglected. There are some hand∣some mosques and churches here.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="1820"/>
Larneza, a commodious sea-port on the south side of the island. A French and Venetian consul reside at this place, together with seve∣ral English, Dutch, and other merchants. The chief commodities laden at this place are cotton, cotton - yarn, and coarse wool for quilts and mattrasses.</P>
<P>Famagusta, antiently Salamis, is a fair city and sea-port on the eastern coast of the island, seven∣teen miles from Nicosia. It has a stout castle, and some other fortifications, in good repair. The harbour, tho' not spacious, is safe and com∣modious. This city held out a siege of ten months against Solyman II. The Greeks and other Christians are only permitted to keep shop here in the day-time, and at night are obliged to retire to some of the neighbour∣ing villages. The adjacent country is very fertile and pleasant. It had antiently a no∣ble temple dedicated to Jupiter, in which they offered human sacrifices every fast-day of the year.</P>
<P>Ciernes, antiently Ceraunia, is a small half∣ruined sea-port town, on the northern coast, two miles from Nicosia. Its castle is the only fortress of note on the northern coast. About nine miles from it is a stately Greek monastery; and at about half that distance a magnificent edifice, called the palace of the sun.</P>
<P>Baffa, antiently Paphos, is now a poor sea∣port town on the western coast of the island, near the cape of its name.

the northern or southern situation of these parts, partly from their proximity or distance from the sea, and partly from the nature of the soil and ex∣ternal figure. In general, in the middle of the country, the weather is settled, temperate, and serene; in the north it is colder, more variable, and boisterous; and in the south much warmer, especially in winter. As the air, so the soil dif∣fers exceedingly. In the north it is generally barren, producing but little corn or fruit; but the countries watered by the Rhine, Neckar, and Danube, are fruitful, and produce plenty both of corn and wine. Saxony is also a delicious coun∣try and a rich soil. So great is the extent of Ger∣many, and so various the soil, that there are very few vegetables, minerals, metals, or animals, that may not be found in some part or other of it. It yields grain of all kinds, as common wheat, Tur∣key-wheat, buck-wheat, rye, spelt, barley, oats, peas, beans, vetches, lentils, chiches, millet; be∣sides manna, hemp, flax, hops, anise, cummin, tobacco, madder, woad, saffron, carthamus, or bastard-saffron, acorns, truffles, and potatoes, with a variety of other excellent roots, medicinal and pot-herbs. As to fruits, it produces apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, chesnuts, almonds, olives, medlars, figs, peaches, apricots, oranges, lemons, citrons, filberts, nuts, walnuts, together with wine, of which the Rhenish and Moselle, the Franconian, Neckar, Kocher, and Muscadel wines are the best. In Austria too grows an ex∣cellent wine. Germany abounds also with honey, butter, and cheese, horses, oxen, cows, sheep, and goats. Of wild and tame fowls there is also great plenty and variety, such as turkeys, pi∣geons, geese, and ducks, storks, spoonbills, wild geese, wild ducks, swans, bustards, pheasants, woodcocks, partridges, grouse, snipes, larks,
<PB N="182" REF="1870"/>
fieldfares, ortolans, quails, falcons, herons, hawks, &amp;c. For the chace, there are deer, roes, boars, hares, rabbits, chamous, and wild goats, bears, wolves, lynxes, foxes, wild cats, badgers, mar∣tens, &amp;c. In Moravia, a species of leopards and beavers are found. The numerous rivers, brooks, lakes, and ponds in Germany, abound in fish of various sorts, as sturgeons, shads, salmon, pikes, carp, trout, lampreys, perch, roach, barbel, jacks, eel-pouts, eels, crabs, and many other species. Germany is pretty well supplied with turf for fuel, besides coal and wood. It was antiently a very woody country; and there are still large forests remaining, which yield oak, beech, pine, white and red fir, alder, ash, birch, lime-tree, asp, or black poplar, larch, plane-tree, chesnut, olive, walnut, and mulberry-trees.

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, and LAKES.</HEAD>
<P>The principal mountains are those of the Alps, which divide Germany from Italy; but there are many chains and single mountains in other parts of the country, though inferior to these. In several of the mountains are remarkable caverns, grottos, and cavities, in which are found a great variety of figures of drop-stone, or petrified water. The chief rivers of Germany are, 1. The Danube, called antiently Ister, which rises in the Black Forest in Suabia, runs through Suabia and Bavaria to Ra∣tisbon, then to Vienna, and after dividing Hun∣gary into two parts, continues its course south∣east to Belgrade in Servia, proceeding still east through Turkey, it falls at last into the Euxine or Black Sea by several channels; being so wide and deep from Vienna to Belgrade, that fleets of men of war have engaged on it. There are several whirlpools and cataracts in it, particularly in its passage through Turkey, which interrupt the na∣vigation to the Black Sea. It runs a course of two thousand miles or thereabouts, taking in all its windings. The rivers which fall into it on the south side are the Iller, or Iser, the Leck, an∣other Iser, which falls into it opposite Decken∣dorf, the Inn, the Ens, the Drave, the Save, and the Morava. On the north, the Regen, the Neb, the Theysse, the Alauta, and the Pruth. The hausen, in Latin <HI>antaceus,</HI> the largest kind of river-fish, is taken in the Danube. 2. The Rhine, which rises in the country of the Grisons, and runs north to the lake of Constance, then west to Basil, afterwards north between Suabia and Al∣sace;
<PB N="184" REF="1890"/>
then passing through the Palatinate, the electorate of Cologn, and the dutchy of Cleve, at last enters the Netherlands, five miles below Cleve, where it is very broad and swift; but the navigation of it is interrupted by several cataracts, one particularly at Shaffhausen in Switzerland, where the whole river falls seventy-five seet. Its course, including windings, is about six hundred miles. Its fish are sturgeon, two sorts of lampreys, the prickly pike, the Rhine carp, and the barbel. Chrystal i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> found in it sometimes, and also parti∣cles of gold. The rivers which fall into it are the Neckar, the Maine, the Lhon, the Roer, and the Lippe. It is generally one quarter, and in some places half a mile broad, and from one and a half to six or seven fathoms deep. It is naviga∣ble for four hundred miles to Basil in Switzerland. Passengers are carried on it at the rate of five or six miles for a penny. 3. The Elbe rises on the con∣fines of Silesia, runs north-west through Bohemia, Saxony, and Brandenburg, and then, dividing the king of Great Britain's German dominions from Holstein-falls into the German-sea, about seventy miles below Hamburgh, receiving in its passage the Moldau, the Egar, the Sala, the Havel, the Il-menau, and the Stor. It brings ships of good burden up to Hamburgh with the flood, especially if the wind is westerly, and within a mile of it at low-water. Its fish are salmon, sturgeon, carp, roach, bream, and alander, with many others. The tide runs in it ten miles above Hamburgh, where ships of four hundred tons and upwards ride at anchor. 4. The Oder runs from south to north through Silesia and Brandenburgh; then passing by Stetin, and dividing Eastern from Western Po∣merania, falls at last into the Baltic, between the islands of Usedom and Wollin. In this river are many sand-banks which interrupt its navigation.
<PB N="185" REF="1900"/>
Among its fish are salmon and sturgeon. Canals are cut between this river and the Elbe, which very much promote the trade of the electorate of Brandenburg. It runs a course of about three hundred miles. 5. The Weser rises in the moun∣tains of Thuringen, runs through Hesse and Westphalia, and falls into the ocean forty miles below Bremen. It runs about two hundred and fifty miles, and abounds in fish. Large ships loaded cannot come further than Brake or Els∣fleth, about fourteen miles below Bremen. The other rivers of any note are, the Spree, the Pene, the Ems, the Moselle, and the Saar. There are also in Germany many small and great inland lakes, as that of Constance and Bregenz, between Sua∣bia and Switzerland; Chiemsee, or the lake of Ba∣varia; the Zerknitzer-see in the dutchy of Car∣niola, whose waters often run off and return again in an extraordinary manner. In some of the lakes and rivers are found pearls, among which the milk white Bohemian kind are much valued.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to commerce, Germany enjoys great advantages: for it not only borders on the German ocean, the Baltic, and the gulph of Ve∣nice, but is watered by many navigable rivers, and situated in the heart of Europe; consequently the inhabitants can commodiously export their su∣perfluities, and import what they want of the commodities and manufactures of other countries. The goods exported from Germany are, corn, to∣bacco, horses, lean cattle, butter, cheese, honey, syrup, wine, in particular the Rhenish and Mo∣selle, the former of which has its principal staple at Cologn, linen, woollen, stuffs, yarn, ribbands, silk and cotton stuffs, Nuremberg wares, goat∣skins,
<PB N="186" REF="1910"/>
wool, all sorts of wood, particularly for ship-building, iron-plates, and stoves, cannon, ball, bombs, granadoes, tin-plates, steel-work, copper, brass wire, porcelain, earthen ware, mirrors, glasses, beer, Brunswic mum, tartar, smalt, zaffer, Prussian blue, hogs bristles, printers ink, and many other things. The French buy up great numbers of horses in Germany to remount their cavalry. Towards the middle of the thirteenth century, se∣veral towns upon the German ocean and the Bal∣tic entered into a league for the security and pro∣motion of their trade and navigation, and were therefore called Hanse-towns. Tho' this league hath long since ceased to operate in regard to se∣veral of these towns, in consequence of the decay of their trade, yet Hamburgh, Lubeck, and Bre∣men, are still called the Hanse-towns, and a league actually subsists between them, under the name of which they conclude treaties of commerce with soreign powers. Hamburgh is the chief town of trade in Germany, and next to it are Francfort on the Maine, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Vienna, Fiume, and Trieste, which last is a free port. There are great annual fairs at some towns in the empire, as at Francfort on the Maine, at Leipsic, at Bruns∣wic, Francfort on the Oder, Naumburg, and Mentz. A new trading company to Asia hath been lately established at Embden, by the king of Prussia. The imports of the Germans consist of a great variety of articles. In particular from Eng∣land, they import woollen manufactures, tobacco, sugar, ginger, East-India goods, tin, and lead; but several of the German princes having prohi∣bited some particular sorts, and others all our woollen manufactures, the balance of trade is much against us with Germany.</P>

<PB N="187" REF="1920"/>
<HEAD>INVENTIONS and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The Germans are excellent mechanics and chy∣mists. By them was the use of guns and gun∣powder invented about the year 1330; and print∣ing, either by them or the Dutch, about the year 1450. A great many manufactures were intro∣duced among them by the French refugees after the revocation of the edict of Nantz. They make at present velvets, beautiful silks, rich stuffs, half silks, variety of woollen stuffs and cloths, fine and coarse linen, ribbands, lace, checkt linen, yarn, and thread, Silesia linen, bombazin, canvas, fustian, table-cloths, ticking, fine and coarse woollen hose, caps, gold and silver galoon embroidered work, fine hats, tapestry, and Spanish rough and smooth leather. They excel also in printing cottons, in dying, and in making beautiful mirrors, glass ware, fine lacquered works; and the porcelain of Misnia in Saxony is thought to ex∣ceed even that of China. The manufactures of paper, tobacco, snuff, and bleached wax, are very considerable; and also of clock-work, guns, and locks, as well as tin-plates, and white iron. Their artificers at Nuremberg are said to surpass all others in the manufactures of steel, iron, brass, wood, alabaster, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>The emperor, electors, most of the princes of the empire, divers prelates, abbesses, counts, ba∣rons, and imperial cities; nay, many mediate princes, that is, such as, in temporalities, have another superior besides the emperor, many towns, and some of the gentry, who are favoured with that privilege by the emperor, or have an∣tiently
<PB N="188" REF="1930"/>
been in possession of it, and all such as have gold and silver mines, enjoy the privilege of coin∣ing money as far as the quantity they yield: some however, have the privilege of coining only small money; but others a larger species either of sil∣ver or gold. Yet there are only three or four mints allowed in each circle, unless an estate of the empire has mines of its own, and wants to erect a mint near it. By the laws of the empire the coin of each circle ought to be examined year∣ly, and all the money of the empire ought to be according to one and the same standard, which at present is that of Leipsic. The money of most nations in Europe goes here near its value. The most common German silver coin is a rixdollar, which is worth about four shillings and sixpence, but in some places only three shillings and sixpence. A German florin, or guilder, is worth generally about half a crown, and a gold ducat about nine shillings. A crown, in specie, is equal to an Eng∣lish crown, but a crown current only to three shillings and sixpence. The German coin, in general, is neither true sterling nor due weight, being more clipt, it is thought, than any other coin in Europe. This, with the great variety of money that is current here, is no small disadvan∣tage to trade, and sinks also the value of estates. A German mark is one shilling and sixpence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>The language of the Germans is High-Dutch, of which there are so many dialects, that the peo∣ple of one province scarce understand those of an∣other. Latin and French are the most useful languages for a foreigner travelling in Ger∣many, every servant almost in their inns under∣standing something either of the one or other of
<PB N="189" REF="1940"/>
these. Both High and Low-Dutch are very harsh and disagreeable to a delicate ear; but the Ger∣mans, for that reason, call them noble and manly. They extend very far; for they are spoken, with some variation, in Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Holland, and Flanders; and all these are dialects of the old Teutonic: which is also the ground∣work of the English, introduced by our Saxon ancestors.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to religion, the empire is pretty equally divided between papists and protestants. The latter are again divided into Lutherans and Cal∣vinists, or Reformed. The inhabitants of Austria and Bavaria are generally papists; those of Meck∣lenburgh, Holstein, Brandenburgh, Saxony, and Pomerania, Lutherans; the Hessians, and the people in the south of Franconia, Calvinists. In the rest of the empire, particularly in Suabia, West∣phalia, and the Circle of the Lower-Rhine, there is a mixture of all these sects. The king of Prus∣sia and his court are Calvinists; tho' his subjects are generally Lutherans, as well as those of the elector of Saxony. The two last electors, for the sake of the crown of Poland, professed themselves papists. According to Irenaeus, Christianity was in a flourishing state in Germany about the middle of the second century. It is certain, however, that a great part of the country was utterly unac∣quainted therewith, till about the end of the se∣venth and beginning of the eighth centuries. Un∣der Charlemagne, in the eighth century, it was pretty well established. His son Lewis, being a weak bigotted prince, was excessively profuse in founding and endowing cloisters and churches. By degrees, and by various arts, in the dark ages, the popes got into their hands almost the entire
<PB N="190" REF="1950"/>
management of every thing relating to the church and ecclesiastics, both secular and regular; nay, they even claimed a power not only to controul, but to depose princes, to absolve their subjects from their allegiance, and dispose of their domi∣nions as they thought fit. The tyranny and usur∣pations of the popes, and the monstrous corrup∣tions and abuses that had crept into, or been in∣troduced, from worldly views of power and gran∣deur, into the antient doctrine and discipline of the church, made all that were capable of any re∣flexion among the laity, and every honest man a∣mong the clergy, earnestly wish for a reformation, which was at last boldly attempted by a native of this country, Dr. Martin Luther, in the sixteenth century. The states of the empire that embraced the reformation, from their protesting in 1529 a∣gainst the conclusion of the diet at Spire, by which all innovations in religion, till the decree of a future council could be obtained, were declared unlaw∣ful, obtained the name of Protestants. A religious war soon after broke out, which was extinguished in some measure in 1552, by the peace of Passau, and more compleatly by that ratified at Ausburgh in 1555, by which a full toleration and liberty was granted to the protestants. This was farther confirmed and explained by the treaty of Westpha∣lia in 1648. By virtue of these conventions, no other religion but the Roman catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed, was to be introduced into, or to∣lerated in the Holy Roman Empire. Some other sects, notwithstanding, in some places, actually enjoy the free exercise of their religion. Such of the above persuasions as existed in any state in the year 1624, are still to be allowed; but it lies in the breast of the respective sovereigns, whether they will tolerate any that had neither public nor private exercise in the country in the year above∣mentioned.
<PB N="191" REF="1960"/>
The power of the protestant states over their catholic subjects, in regard to religion, is the same as that which the catholic states have over their protestant subjects. Each party is obliged to allow the other the free exercise of their religion in their dominions, provided they were in possession of it in the year 1624. In the Roman catholic countries here, as well as elsewhere, the clergy are in a great measure independent of the civil power; but in the protestant states, the supremacy is vested in the sovereign. Lastly, the protestant, or evangelic body, have mutually agreed, that whenever, for the future, a Luthe∣ran lord of a country shall turn to the reformed church, or obtain a country of that persuasion, or <HI>vice versâ,</HI> that in that case he shall leave his sub∣jects the free exercise of their religion, with their whole form of church and school-discipline, and all other privileges whatsoever.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the learning of the Germans, there is no where a more general taste for reading, especially in the protestant countries, nor are more books any where written and printed than among the Germans. No people apply themselves more closely to their studies, and the Hebrew is in no country so generally learnt, or better understood. Printing is encouraged to a fault; every man of letters is an author; they multiply books without number, millions of thesises and disputations are annually published; for no man can be a graduate in their universities who has not published one disputation at least. In this country there are thirty∣six universities, of which seventeen are protestant, seventeen Roman catholic, and two mixed; besides a vast number of colleges, gymnasia, pedagogies,
<PB N="192" REF="1970"/>
and Latin schools. There are also many academies and societies for the promoting the study of natu∣ral philosophy, the belles-lettres, antiquities, &amp;c. as the imperial Leopoldine academy of the Naturae Curiosi; the academy of sciences at Berlin, at Got∣tingen, at Erfurth, at Leipsic, at Duisburgh, to which we may add the Latin society of Jena. Of the public libraries, the most celebrated are those of Vienna, Wolfenbuttel, Hanover, Got∣tingen, Weimar, and the council-library at Leip∣sic. The Germans have written largely upon the Roman and canon laws. Stahl, Van Swieten, Storkh, Hoffman, and others, have contributed greatly to the improvement of physic; Ruvinus and Dillenius of botany; Heister of anatomy and surgery; Neuman, Zemmermann, Pott, and Marg∣graf, of chymistry. In philosophy, natural and moral, the reputation of Leibnitz, Wolfius, Puf∣fendorf, Thomasius, Otto van Gueriche, and Kep∣ler, is great. Germany has also produced good political writers, geographers, and historians: but they seem to have no great taste or capacity for works of wit and entertainment, as poetry, plays, romances and novels, or what is called the belles∣lettres; but they have had some good critics and antiquarians. They have one great defect, how∣ever, in all their writings, namely, that they are extremely prolix, dry, and voluminous, and know little or nothing of that valuable art, in which many nations excel, namely, of enlivening their performances, and mixing the dulce with the utile. With respect to the fine arts the Germans have acquitted themselves tolerably well. Ger∣many has produced some good musicians, painters, architects, sculptors, and engravers. They even pretend to have been the first inventors of en∣graving, etching, and mezzotinto; as well as of gunpowder, guns, and printing. For the im∣provement
<PB N="193" REF="1980"/>
of some of these arts, academies have been established in some parts of Germany: at Vienna in particular and Berlin are academies for painting, sculpture, and architecture: at Dresden and Nurenberg are academies for paint∣ing; and at Augsburgh is the imperial Franciscan academy of the fine arts.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION of the EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>In the first centuries after the birth of Christ, Germany was divided into several petty states, which had no common supreme head. After the dissolution of the western empire, the Franks, a German nation, subdued a great part both of Gaul and Germany: and about the year 800, Charlemagne, the son of Pepin, king of France, founded a new empire in the West, consisting of great part of Germany, France, Italy, and part of Spain. But about the year 880, the princes and states of the empire discarded the French Carlovinian race, and elected Arnulph, the son of Carolomon, king of Bavaria, their emperor. The dignity of emperor had been hitherto hereditary, but limit∣ed by the diets, which had been first introduced by the northern nations that overturned the Roman empire. At last under Henry IV. who was put under the ban by the pope, and upon that deposed by the states, the right of election was established by papal management, and from that time has been constantly maintained. Henry VI. attempted in vain to make the crown heredi∣tary in his family. The race of the house of Au∣stria began with Rodolph of Hapsburg, who was elected emperor in the year 1273. Charles IV. at the diet of Nurenberg in 1356, formed the wholesome regulations for the election of an em∣peror, which are to this day known and observed
<PB N="194" REF="1990"/>
under the name of the golden bull. In the year 1448, the celebrated Concordat between the empe∣ror Frederic III. and certain spiritual and tempo∣ral estates of the empire, and pope Nicholas V. was settled. This emperor was duke of Austria; and his posterity, notwithstanding the empire is elective, have had the address to continue it in their family for three hundred years, namely, to the year 1740, when they lost it only for want of an heir male in the family; but the Austrian fa∣mily are now again in possession of it, the present emperor being the grandson of the emperor Charles VI. by his eldest daughter Maria Theresa, mar∣ried to Francis I. late emperor, and grand-duke of Tuscany, who was born duke of Lorrain. In the reign of the emperor Frederic III. the court now called the chamber of Witzlar was established, and the empire was divided into ten circles. His successor Charles V. first swore to a capitulation. In his time Mexico and Peru were conquered, whereby he became sovereign of much larger ter∣ritories, and much richer, than any prince before him ever enjoyed. His brother Ferdinand estab∣lished the aulic council. It was inserted for the first time in the capitulation of the emperor Mathias, grandson of Ferdinand, that the electors for the future should be intituled to elect a king of the Romans, with or without the consent of the em∣peror. In the reign of Ferdinand III. an end was put to the religious wars that began in the reign of Charles V. in consequence of the reformation, by the treaty of Westphalia. In the reign of his son Leopold, the diet of the empire was opened at Ratisbon in the year 1663, where it still con∣tinues, and the imperial chamber of justice was removed from Spire to Witzlar. This emperor conferred on Ernest Augustus, of Brunswick Lu∣nenburgh, the ninth electoral dignity. His son
<PB N="195" REF="2000"/>
Charles VI. having no male heirs, settled his he∣reditary dominions on his eldest daughter the arch-duchess Maria Theresa, which settlement was confirmed by the diet of the empire, and guaran∣tied by most of the powers of Europe. In 1742, Charles VII. elector of Bavaria, was chosen em∣peror, by the suspension of the vote of Bohemia; and after his death Francis I. grand-duke of Tuscany. To him succeeded his eldest son Fer∣dinand, the present emperor, who had been king of the Romans in his father's life-time.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the EMPEROR and his PREROGATIVES.</HEAD>
<P>The empire is elective, and the laws of the empire require no other qualifications in a candi∣date, but that he be <HI>justus, bonus, et utilis,</HI> without any limitation in regard to religion, nation, state, or age. But as the popish electors are more in number than the protestant, a Roman catholic prince is always chosen. The election is at Franckfort on the Maine, within three months after the former emperor's death. The electors appear either in person or by their envoys; and if an elector absent himself, the election, notwith∣standing, is valid. Before the day of election, all foreigners are ordered to depart the town. Whoever has more than half the voices of the college for him, is elected; and an elector may even give his vote for himself. When the elec∣tion is over, the person elected, or his plenipoten∣tiary, must immediately subscribe and swear to the capitulation of election: but if the person elected is not present in person, he must swear to it himself before he is crowned, and before he can take upon him the government; which, till then, belongs to the vicars of the empire. His coronation, for which he appoints a day himself,
<PB N="196" REF="2010"/>
is always performed in the place where he was elected; tho' both election and coronation ought to be in the city of Aix-la-Chapelle. He then takes a general oath of a ruler, and among other things promises all due veneration to the pope and church. The emperors used formerly to be crowned by the popes till the reign of Charles V. but from that time the papal coronation has been dispensed with. However, immediately upon his entering upon the government, he testifies his veneration to the pope by an embassy. The title of the emperor runs thus: N. by the grace of God, elected Roman emperor (imperator) at all times augmenter of the empire (semper Augu∣stus) in or of Germany king. Then follow the titles of the hereditary imperial dominions. The states of the empire give the emperor the title of most illustrious, most powerful, and most invinci∣ble Roman emperor; the last of which is omitted by the electors. The emperor is looked upon by all other crowned heads and states in Europe as the first European potentate, and as such prece∣dence is given him and his ambassadors. He is the supreme head of the German empire; but his power in the administration thereof is very li∣mitted. With respect to ecclesiastical matters, his prerogative consists principally in the right of the first petition <HI>(jus primari arum precum)</HI> by virtue of which, in all foundations and cloisters of the em∣pire, he may, once during his administration, con∣fer a benefice on any person qualified for it by the statutes; and on that of a panis brief to each foundation or cloister in the empire, by virtue of which, such foundation is obliged to admit into it the person who has obtained the emperor's brief, and there provide him, during life, with meat, drink, cloaths, and other necessaries. With
<PB N="197" REF="2020"/>
respect to temporal matters, he can create princes, dukes, marquisses, counts, barons, knights, &amp;c. raise countries and territories to a higher rank; be∣stow arms, and grant letters of respite and pro∣tection, securing a debtor against his creditor; establish universities, fairs, and markets; em∣power any person to adopt another, and to assume a title from his estate; erect any place into a sanc∣tuary; confer majority on minors; legitimate children born out of wedlock; confirm the con∣tracts and stipulations of the members of the em∣pire; remit oaths extorted from them; invest such as possess fiefs of the empire, and decide in feudal matters relative thereto, &amp;c. but he cannot grant to any person privileges detrimental to the rights of the immediate sovereign of that person. He can also grant exclusive privileges for printing particular books, and for new invented machines, &amp;c. He appoints most of the officers, civil and mi∣litary, of the empire, except such as are hereditary, as the great chancellor, treasurer, &amp;c. but these are only honorary. In antient times the emperor had considerable domains and incomes in the empire; but almost all these have been successive∣ly mortgaged and alienated, so that at present the certain revenues of the emperor are very in∣considerable: but then, as he has the disposal of most offices, the creation of princes and noblemen, is entitled to all confiscations and forfeitures, and invests the several princes in their estates, besides those that hold fiefs of the empire in Italy, the profit of these articles may amount to a large sum. He has also some offerings from the Jews, and the free-gifts of the order of knights of the empire. A successor in the empire is frequently chosen by the electors during the life of the emperor, who is stiled king of the Romans. He is elected and crowned in the same manner as the emperor, has
<PB N="198" REF="2030"/>
title of majesty, takes precedence of all other kings in Christendom, and succeeds of course at the emperor's death.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the DIET.</HEAD>
<P>The diet of the empire consists of the emperor, the nine electors, the ecclesiastical and secular princes, and the deputies of imperial cities. The electors are divided into spiritual and temporal. The spiritual electors are the archbishops of Mentz, Triers, and Cologne; and the secular, those of Bohemia, Palatine, Brandenburgh, Saxony, Bavaria, and Hanover. The spiritual electors are such of course as soon as they are chosen to their sees by their respective chapters. In the reign of Henry IV. the right of election is said to have been introduced. Till the peace of Westphalia there were only seven electors, when an eighth was added; and, in 1692, a ninth, in favour of the illustrious house of Brunswick Lunenburgh, now in possession of a much higher and infinitely more valuable dignity, viz. the crown of Great Britain. The spiritual are stiled by the emperor, Highly wor∣thy nephews; the temporal, Most illustrious un∣cles. By the other members of the empire, the spiritual, who were not born princes, are stiled, Your electoral grace; but such as were, and also the temporal electors, have the appellation of, Your electoral serenity. Foreign kings stile the temporal electors, and those of the spiritual, who
<PB N="199" REF="2040"/>
were princes born, Brothers. The spiritual are also stiled, Highly and most worthy; and the tem∣poral, Most illustrious.</P>
<P>The elector of Mentz is arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman empire in Germany, and director of the electoral college. This prince notifies the death of an emperor to his co-electors, appoints the diet of election, administers the oath to the electors, or their envoys, collects their voices, proclaims the election, anoints the elected empe∣ror, and either he, or the elector of Cologne, crowns him. He hears all grievances, and other matters, before the different colleges of the em∣pire. He names a vice-chancellor of the empire, who takes an oath to him, as well as to the em∣peror. He appoints all officers for the chancery of the empire, has supreme jurisdiction over them, as also the inspection of the archives of the em∣pire, and the protection of the post-office; in consequence of which his counsellors pay no postage.</P>
<P>The elector of Treves is the arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman empire in Gaul, and the king∣dom of Arles; but this at present is only a bare title. At an election of the king of the Romans he has the first voice, and before the election takes the oath of the elector of Mentz.</P>
<P>The elector of Cologne is arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman empire in Italy. At an election of a king of the Romans he has the second voice, and he crowns the emperor, when the coronation is at Aix-la-Chapelle, and in the archbishopric of Cologne.</P>
<P>The king and elector of Bohemia is arch-cup∣bearer of the Holy Roman empire, precedes all the temporal electors whatsoever, and has the third voice in the electoral college.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="2050"/>
The elector of Bavaria is arch-sewer of the Holy Roman empire. At the coronation he carries the monde before the emperor, ranks next to Bohe∣mia, places four silver dishes, weighing twelve marks, on the imperial table, and serves up the first course.</P>
<P>The elector of Saxony is arch-marshal of the Holy Roman empire. He also, when there is no emperor, is one of the vicars of the empire. At the diets, and on other solemn occasions, he carries the sword of state before the emperor; and, at the coronation, he rides into a heap of oats, and fills a silver measure with that grain. During the holding of the diets, he has jurisdiction over all electoral and other officers of the states of the empire, as also in criminal matters. When the see of Mentz is vacant, he holds the directory of the diet, and the right of protection over the imperial city of Mullhausen, and all trumpeters throughout the Roman em∣pire.</P>
<P>The elector of Brandenburgh is arch-chamber∣lain of the Holy Roman empire, carries the sceptre before the emperor, which he bears also in his coat of arms; presents the emperor with water in a silver bason in order to wash himself; may pro∣ceed with respect to his fiefs, principalities, and lands, as with allodial estates; and, at his own pleasure, impose new tolls, and erect mills on all rivers.</P>
<P>The elector Palatine was formerly arch-sewer, but since the treaty of Westphalia arch-treasurer. This house has the right of protection over all the braziers of a large district, and throughout all Germany is protector of the order of St. John; can raise nobles and gentlemen to the degree of counts, and has the right of venery, by virtue of which, all illegitimate persons, and others
<PB N="201" REF="2060"/>
of foreign countries, who within a year and a day have no succeeding lord, may be made bondsmen in such places as are subject to his jurisdiction: so that they must bind themselves to the duties of the electorate, and to the payment of a certain tribute and mortuaries.</P>
<P>When the elector of Bavaria was put under the ban of the empire in 1706, the Palatine recovered the office of arch-sewer, and the elector of Bruns∣wic Lunenburg obtained the office of arch-trea∣surer, by which he still stiles himself, till another suitable arch-office be conferred on him. He en∣joys the alternate succession in the bishopric of Os∣naburgh, together with some other rights and pri∣vileges.</P>
<P>Without the privity of these electors, the em∣peror can do nothing with regard to leagues and wars of the empire, alienations and mortgages of lands belonging to it, &amp;c. At their investiture they pay no fees, and a new elected emperor must immediately confirm their privileges and dignities. The diets are held by the emperor, with the con∣sent of the electors; and, at their desire, each elec∣tor enjoys a right of appointing two chamber∣court assessors, and their electorates have an unli∣mited privilege, <HI>de non appellando.</HI> They may meet together, and hold what are called electoral diets. A subject may be guilty of treason against them; and their whole electorates descend to their first-born. By the imperial capitulation, their envoys are to take place of princes in person.</P>
<P>Next to the electors are the princes of the em∣pire, who are also partly spiritual and partly tem∣poral. The spiritual are archbishops, bishops, abbots, provosts, abbesses, the masters of the Teutonic order, and of St. John; but of these, some have each a voice, and others vote by col∣leges.
<PB N="202" REF="2070"/>
The temporal princes are dukes, mar∣quisses, counts, viscounts, barons, of which, as among the spiritual, the higher have single voices, but the lower vote by colleges.</P>
<P>Not only all those princes who have seat and voice in the diet, but many others, are vested with sovereign power in their respective territories, or at least are under very few restraints. They are, indeed, more free and absolute than some crowned heads; but still they are subject to the general laws of the empire, and sworn not to en∣gage in any wars or alliances to the prejudice of the emperor and empire. But here it is to be observed that many have titles of nobility, though they are no sovereigns, nor have any seat in the diets: some, however, have a seat, that do not hold immediately of the emperor, or, which is the same, are immediately subject to some other prince, and only mediately to the emperor. The Franks, in imitation of the Romans, reduced all Germany into provinces, over which they placed governors with different titles. They were gene∣rally of noble families, and if there was no mate∣rial objection against it, their sons were appointed to succeed them; from whence these governors came at length to insist on a right of succeeding their ancestors, and refused to pay homage to the German emperors, every one taking upon him to exercise regal power in his province; from whence have sprung up so many petty sove∣reigns in the empire. These officers were either hertogen, or dukes, to whom were committed the government of the larger districts. Graffen, or earls, who had the care of smaller parts; Psaltz-graven, palsgraves, or counts-palatine, who administered justice when in the verge of the court; landgraves, who were set over provinces;
<PB N="203" REF="2080"/>
margraves, or marquisses, who were charged with the care of the marches or borders; and bur∣graves, who were governors of the royal castles and forts. The third college of the diet is that of the free or imperial cities, i. e. such as is go∣verned by magistrates of their own, and stand immediately under the emperor and empire. Some of these are wholly Catholic, others entirely Lu∣theran, and others again mixed. Within their territory they exercise supreme power, and are di∣vided into two benches, the Rhenish and Sua∣bian. As the princes of the empire took advan∣tage of the necessities or indulgence of the Ger∣man emperors, to erect the governments they held in capacity of viceroys or governors into indepen∣dent principalities and states, so did the cities now called free and imperial. The emperors, fre∣quently wanting supplies of money to carry on wars, or for other occasions, borrowed large sums of the wealthy trading towns, and paid them again in munificent grants and privileges, making them free states and independent of the governors of the provinces where they stood: accordingly, these cities, like the princes, exercise all kinds of sovereign power that are consistent with the gene∣ral laws of the empire; they make laws, consti∣tute courts of justice, coin money, raise forces, and enter into alliances and confederacies; only acknowledging the emperor for their supreme lord, and contributing their share towards the common defence of the empire. The diet meets at Ratisbon on the emperor's summons, and any of the princes may send their deputies thither in their stead. The diet makes laws, raises taxes, determines differences between the several princes and states, and can relieve subjects from the oppressions of their sovereign: and there are two
<PB N="204" REF="2090"/>
supreme councils, called the aulic council, and the chamber of Witzlar, to which any of the princes and states, or their subjects, may appeal, when they apprehend themselves aggrieved. The em∣pire was antiently divided into ten circles, which division was confirmed by the emperor Charles V. who settled the portion which every circle and every prince and member of each circle should contribute towards the ordinary and extraordinary taxes of the empire. This was entered in a regis∣ter, called a Matriculation-book, which is kept by the elector of Mentz. The taxes are either ordinary or extraordinary. The former is what is stiled the chamber-terms, or the money which each state of the empire is to contribute annually for maintaining the chamber-judicatory of the emperor and empire. The latter are called Ro∣man months, which are a certain rate of money or troops settled by the states of the empire, and granted sometimes to the emperor, as for instance, for the support of the emperor, or of the army of the empire, or the forts thereof, or for the war against the Turks, the expences of an embassy of the em∣pire, &amp;c. By the Matricula settled by Charles V. twelve florins were to be paid monthly in lieu of every horseman, and four for every foot soldier. Afterwards it was enacted, that sixty florins should be advanced in lieu of every trooper wanting, and twelve for every footman; and these payments obtained the name of Roman months, because the forces or money abovementioned were at first applied towards the raising a body of horse and foot for six months, to conduct the emperor in his journey to Rome to receive the papal coronation. Besides the diet, there are yearly meetings of the states of one, two, or three of the circles that lie nearest to one another, called from thence, cor∣responding
<PB N="205" REF="2100"/>
circles, of which there are three classes, first, the Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, and West∣phalia. Secondly, the Upper and Lower Saxony; and, thirdly, Franconia, Swabia, and Austria. That of Upper Saxony assembles usually at Leipsic; that of Franconia at Nuremberg; and that of Swabia at Ulm. They treat of the regulation of their coin, the public peace, their treasure, magazines, for∣tifications and commerce, rectifying the Matri∣cula, putting the decrees of the empire in execu∣tion, and appointing judges of the imperial cham∣ber of Witzlar or Spire, and of the aulic council at Vienna; and have power of enacting laws which are not inconsistent with the constitution of the em∣pire. In every circle there are one or two direc∣tors, who summon the states of the circle, and have the command of the militia, when embodied, regulating their march, quarters, &amp;c. and putting the decrees of the empire in execution, when any prince or member refuses to comply with their resolutions. It is to be observed here, that the protestant estates of the empire, in the diets, are called the evangelic body, and have a director, viz. the elector of Saxony. Besides the higher nobi∣lity, or high adel of the empire, consisting of princes and counts, &amp;c. there is the lower adel, or rank of knighthood, which is very numerous in Germany.</P>
<P>We have thus given some general account of the constitution of the German empire; but the Germanic body is so large and complex, their pri∣vileges, connexions, and dependencies so various and intricate, that if we were to enter into a mi∣nute or particular account of them, we should be obliged greatly to exceed the limits which we have prescribed to ourselves.</P>

<HEAD>Of the PERSONS and CHARACTER of the GERMANS.</HEAD>
<P>The Germans are of a good stature, with fair complexions and agreeable features; but neither their shape nor mien are to be admired, any more than the brightness of their parts, which are not at all improved by their regimen or way of life, for no people eat and drink to greater excess than the Germans. Germany, notwithstanding, hath produced great men, a circumstance which may proceed from their unwearied application to what∣ever they undertake, and their travelling to other countries, where they converse with the politest men of every nation; and it is no wonder if it produces great generals, being perpetually en∣gaged in wars, either with the christian princes their neighbours, or the Turks. The Germans are now esteemed, as they were formerly, an honest hospitable people, free from artifice and disguise, social, open, and conversible, especially if a little elevated and warmed by the bottle, as being na∣turally phlegmatic and saturnine. They are taught to drink from their cradles; and not only private concerns, but affairs of state, are generally trans∣acted over the bottle. A certain modern author, in his character of the Germans, says, "That they want spirit to actuate their large bodies, and heat to concoct their phlegmatic humour: that their courage appears from the many victories they have gained, especially over the infidels; that they are free from malice and dissimulation, much addicted to gluttony and drunkenness, but not over amorous; that the common people are laborious and honest, but slow and heavy; that
<PB N="207" REF="2120"/>
the merchants and tradesmen are very fair in their dealings, hospitable, and complaisant; that the no∣bility are men of great honour, and commonly scholars; that they value themselves much upon their birth and family; that most of the princes being poor, their younger sons generally engage in the service of the emperor, the electors, or some foreign state; or procure themselves some of the rich ecclesiastical preferments, which are so numerous in the Roman catholic states; that the protestant clergy are learned and exemplary in their deportment, but the popish ignorant and liber∣tine; that no people have more feasting at mar∣riages, funerals, and birth-days; that the Ger∣mans have excellent mechanic geniuses, &amp;c." The number of the inhabitants of Germany can only be determined with probability. It is in general populous, and in that respect has rather the supe∣riority over France, for which it would be more than a match if it was united under one head. The inhabitants are computed at about twenty∣four millions, and if they do not make so great a figure abroad as the French, they are probably more happy at home, as they have more liberty, and live in greater plenty. Few of the territories of the German princes are so large as to be assigned to viceroys, to be oppressed and fleeced at plea∣sure: nor are they without redress when they suf∣fer any grievance; they may appeal to the general diet, or great councils of the empire, for relief. Whereas, in France, the lives and fortunes of the subject are entirely at the disposal of the grand monarch. The subjects of the petty princes in Germany are generally the most unhappy; for these princes, affecting the grandeur and splendor of the more powerful, in the number and appear∣ance of their officers and domestics, in their pa∣laces,
<PB N="208" REF="2130"/>
gardens, pictures, curiosities, guards, bands of music, tables, dress, and furniture, are obliged to support all this vain pomp and parade, by fleecing their miserable vassals and dependents. With respect to the burghers and peasants of Ger∣many, the former, in many places, enjoy great privileges; the latter also, in some parts, as for instance, in Franconia, Swabia, and on the Rhine, are generally a free people, or only perform certain services to their superiors, and only pay taxes: whereas in the marquisate of Brandenburg, Po∣merania, Lusatia, Moravia, Bohemia, Austria, &amp;c. they may justly be denominated slaves, tho' in different degrees. The inhabitants of Vienna live luxuriously, a great part of their time being spent in feasting and carousing: dancing and fencing are their ordinary recreations within doors; and in the winter, when the several branches of the Danube are frozen over, and the ground co∣vered with snow, the ladies take their recreation in sledges of different shapes, such as griffins, ty∣gers, swans, scollop-shells, &amp;c. Here the lady sits, dressed in velvet, lined with rich furs, and adorned with laces and jewels, having on her head a velvet cap; and the sledge is drawn by one horse, set off with plumes of feathers, ribbons, and bells. As this diversion is taken chiefly in the night-time, servants ride before the sledge with torches, and a gentleman sitting on the sledge behind guides the horse. The German women, as well as men, are generally large and corpulent, but have god complexions, and are more obse∣quious to their husbands than our British ladies usually are. They are generally well educated and fond of music, but more addicted to gaming than becomes their sex; and it is observed they are not very talkative.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Among the curiosities of this country, the Zerknitzer lake, in Carniola, is one of the most remarkable. Its waters retire in June, and it be∣comes good pasture; and after Michaelmas the waters return again with great fury, spouting out of the ground to a great height. The tun at Heidelburg is another curiosity; it holds eight hundred hogsheads, and is generally full of the best Rhenish wine, from which foreigners are seldom suffered to retire sober. Vienna it∣self is a curiosity; for here you see the greatest va∣riety of inhabitants that is to be met with any where, as Greeks, Transylvanians, Sclavonians, Turks, Tartars, Hungarians, Croats, Germans, Poles, Spaniards, French, and Italians, in their proper habits. The imperial library at Vienna is in great esteem, containing upwards of eighty thousand volumes, among which are many valua∣ble manuscripts in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Coptic, and Chinese. There is a fair manuscript of the New Testament in Greek, written fifteen hundred years ago in gold letters upon purple. Here are likewise many thousand Greek, Roman, and Gothic coins and medals, with a vast collection of other curiosities in art and nature. Most of the palaces and cathe∣drals of Germany are Gothic, but stately; the town-houses are more magnificent than those of other countries; few princes, or even the noble∣men, are without cabinets of rarities; and their gardens are laid out in the Italian taste. They know not what it is to line or wainscot rooms. The houses in the towns are mostly old fashioned; those on the Rhine are generally of timber inlaid with brick. Almost all the towns have old forti∣fications,
<PB N="210" REF="2150"/>
consisting of a wall or rampart faced with brick, a trench full of water, and gates de∣fended by half moons. In some places the com∣mon way of sleeping is between two feather-beds with the sheets stiched to them. The Germans, like all the northern nations except ours, use stoves, the least of which, the ladies, like the Dutch, carry to church. The women of quality are fond of jewels and rich cloaths, but use neither loose gowns nor petticoats. The caps, coats, gloves, and boots of the Germans, are generally lined with fur. Their hunting is chiefly of deer and wild boars; the latter, in some places, are reckon∣ed good food. The indifference of the great men about the improvement of their country and the prosperity of the subject are, perhaps, greater in this country than in the most absolute govern∣ments.</P>
<P>Having now finished our general account of Germany, we shall next proceed to give a parti∣cular description of the several parts, begin∣ning, from the north, with the circle of Lower Saxony.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="211" REF="2160"/>
<HEAD>Circle of LOWER SAXONY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is bounded to the south by the circle of Upper Saxony, and a part of that of the Upper Rhine; to the north by the duchy of Sleswick, belonging to the king of Denmark, and the Baltic; to the west by the circle of West∣phalia and the North Sea; and to the east by the circle of Upper Saxony. The states belonging to it are the dukes and princes of Magdeburg and Bremen, Zell, Grubenhagen, Calenburg, Wolf∣enbuttle, Halberstadt, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburgh-Gustro, Holstein-Gluckstadt, Hol∣stein Gottorf, Hildesheim, Saxe-Lauenburg, the arch∣bishopric of Lubeck, the principalities of Schwerin, Ratzeburg, Blankenburg, Ranzau, the imperial cities of Lubeck, Gotzlar, Muhlhausen, Nord∣hausen, Hamburgh, and Bremen. The dukes of Bremen and Magdeburg are alternately directors and summoning princes; but ever since the year 1682, the diets, which used generally to be held at Brunswick or Luneburg, have been discontinued. Towards the army of the empire, which, by a de∣cree of the empire in 1681, was settled at forty thousand men, this circle was to furnish one thou∣sand three hundred and twenty-two horsemen, and two thousand seven hundred and seven foot; and of the three hundred thousand florins granted to the imperial chest in 1707, its quota was thirty-one thousand two hundred and seventy-one florins; both which assessments are the same with those of Upper Saxony, Burgundy, Swabia; and Westpha∣lia. This circle, at present, nominates only two assessors in the chamber-judicatory of the empire,
<PB N="212" REF="2170"/>
of one of which the elector of Brunswic-Lune∣burg has the nomination, who must be a Lutheran, and is the ninth in rank. The inhabitants of this circle are almost all Lutherans.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a particular description of the different territories, beginning with</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of MAGDEBURG</HEAD>
<P>Is bounded on the north by the duchy of Mecklen∣burg; on the south and south-west by the principality of Anhalt and Halberstadt; on the east by Upper Saxony, with part of Brandenburg; and on the west by the duchy of Brunswic-Wolfenbuttle. The Saale circle, and that of Luxkenwalde, are separated from the rest, and surrounded on all sides by a part of Upper Saxony. This country is, for the most part, level, but sandy, marshy, or overgrown with woods. There are salt springs in it so rich, that they are sufficient to supply all Germany with that commo∣dity. The Holz circle is the most fruitful part of it. In the Saale circle, where wood is scarce, there is pit-coal; and at Rothenburg is a copper-mine worked. The duchy is well watered; for the Elbe passes through it, and the Saale, Havel, Aller, Ohre, and Elster, either rise in, or wash some part of it in their course. The whole duchy, ex∣clusive of that part of the county of Mansfeld which is connected with it, is said to contain twenty∣nine cities, six towns, about four hundred and thirty villages, and three hundred and thirty thou∣sand inhabitants. The states of the country con∣sist of the clergy, the nobility, and the deputies of the cities. Before it became subject to the electo∣ral house of Brandenburg, frequent diets was hed in it; but at present no diets are held, nor have
<PB N="213" REF="2180"/>
the states the direction of the finances as formerly. Before the reformation it was an archbishopric, subject in spirituals to the pope alone, and its pre∣late was primate of all Germany; but embracing the reformation, it chose itself administrators, till the treaty of Munster in 1648, when it was given, together with the bishopric of Halberstadt, to the elector of Brandenburg, as an equivalent for the Hither Pomerania, granted by that treaty to the king of Sweden. Lutheranism is the predominant religion here; but Calvinists, Jews, and Roman catholics are tolerated. Of the last there are five convents, which never embraced the reformation. All the Lutheran parishes, amounting to three hundred and fourteen, are subject to sixteen in∣spectors, under one general superintendant; only the clergy of the old town of Magdeburg are un∣der the direction of their senior. The Jews have a synagogue at Halle. The manufactures of the duchy are cloth, stuffs, stockings, linen, oil-skins, leather, and parchment, of which, and grain of all sorts, large quantities are exported. The arms of it are, party per pale, ruby, and pearl. The king of Prussia, as duke of Magdeburg, sits and votes between the elector of Bavaria, as duke of Bava∣ria, and the elector-palatine, as palsgrave of Lau∣tern. Of the states of the circle of Lower Saxony he is the first. His matricular assessment for the duchy is, forty-three horse, and one hundred and ninety-six foot, or thirtee hundred florins monthly; and to the chamber of Witzlar, three hundred and forty-three florins and forty kruitzers. For the civil government of the duchy, there is a council of regency, with a war and demesne cham∣ber; and for the ecclesiastical, a consistory, and general superintendant. The revenues of the duchy, arising from the salt-works, demesnes, and taxes, some of which are very heavy and oppres∣sive,
<PB N="214" REF="2190"/>
are said to amount to eight hundred thousand rix-dollars annually. With respect to salt, every housekeeper in the Prussian dominions is obliged to buy a certain quantity for himself and wife, and also for every child and servant, horse, cow, calf, and sheep that he possesses The duchy is divided into circles, and the principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Magdeburg, which gives name to it, and is not only the capital, but that of all Lower Saxony, and formerly even of all Germany. It stands on the Elbe, fifty-eight miles north-west of Wittem∣berg, sixty north of Leipsic and east of Bruns∣wic, sixty-one west of Berlin, one hundred and thirteen south-east of Hamburgh, one hundred and seventy-six east of Munster, one hundred and seventy-four north of Nuremberg, and two hun∣dred and ninety-five north-west of Vienna. It is a city of great trade, strongly fortified, and very antient. Its name signifies the Maiden City, which, some imagine, took its rise from the temple of Venus, which is said to have stood here antiently, and to have been destroyed by Charlemagne. The founder of the city is supposed to have been Otho I. or his empress Editha, daughter to Ed∣mund, the Saxon king of England. The same empe∣ror founded a Benedictine convent here, which he afterwards converted into an archbishopric, of which the archbishop was a count palatine, and had very great privileges, particularly that of wearing the archiepiscopal pallium, and having the cross borne before him, besides many others. The first tourna∣ment in Germany is said to have been appointed near this city, by the emperor Henry the Fowler; but these pastimes were afterwards abolished, because they occasioned such envy and animosity among the nobility, that several of them killed one an∣other upon the spot. The situation of the city is very convenient and pleasant, upon the banks of
<PB N="215" REF="2200"/>
the Elbe, amidst spacious fruitful plains, and on the road betwixt High and Low Germany. It has been a great sufferer by fires and sieges; but by none so much as that in 1631, when the emperor's general, count Tilly, took it by storm, plundered and set it on fire, by which it was entirely reduced to ashes, except the cathedral, the convent of our Lady, and a few cottages belonging to fishermen; of forty thousand burghers not above four hundred escaping. The soldiers spared neither age nor sex, but ripped up women with child, murdered suck∣ing infants in sight of their parents, and ravished young women in the streets; to prevent which violation, many of them flung themselves into the Elbe, and others into the fire. The city is now populous, large, and well built, particularly the broad street and cathedral-square. The principal buildings are the king's palace, the governor's house, the armoury, guildhall, and cathedral. The last is a superb structure in the antique taste, dedi∣cated to St. Maurice, which has a fine organ, the master-pipe of which is so big, that a man can scarce clasp it with both arms; and contains the tombs of the emperor Otho and the empress Edi∣tha, a fine marble statue of St. Maurice, a por∣phyry font, an altar in the choir of one stone of divers colours, curiously wrought, and many other curiosities. They shew here a bedstead and table, which belonged to Martin Luther, when he was an Augustine friar in a cloister of this city before the reformation. Among the relicks, they pre∣tend to have the bason in which Pilate washed his hands after his condemnation of our Saviour, the lantern which Judas made use of when he appre∣hended him, and the ladder on which the cock crowed after St. Peter denied him. The chapter consists of a provost, sixteen major and seven minor canons; besides which, there are four other
<PB N="216" REF="2210"/>
Lutheran collegiate foundations, and a Lutheran convent, dedicated to our Lady, in which is a school or seminary. Here is also a gymnasium, with an academy, in which young gentlemen are instructed in the art of war. The canons of the chapter, which, except the change of religion, is upon the same footing as before the reformation, must make proof of their nobility. The prebends and dignities are all in the gift of the elector; and the revenue of the provost is computed at twelve thousand crowns a-year. Here is a great trade, and a variety of manufactures. The chief are those of woollen cloths and stuffs, silks, cottons, linen, stockings, hats, gloves, tobacco, and snuff. The city was formerly one of the Hanse and impe∣rial towns. Editha, consort to Otho I. on whom it was conferred as a dowry, among many other privileges and advantages, procured it the grant of a yearly fair. The bargravate of this city was antiently an office of great power, having the civil and criminal jurisdiction, the office of hereditary cup-bearer being annexed to it, and was long held as a fief of the archbishopric, but afterwards be∣came an imperial fief, which was again conferred on the archbishopric by the elector of Saxony, up∣on certain conditions. The longitude of the city is twelve degrees nine minutes east, and the lati∣tude fifty-two sixteen.</P>

<P>Halle, a large town lying on the Saale, twenty∣four miles north-west of Leipsic, and forty south of Magdeburg. It is thought to have had its name from the salt-pits discovered here, before the birth of our Saviour, by the Hermauduri, and which the emperor Otho the Great bestowed on the archbishopric of Magdeburg. His son Otho gave this town a charter, by the name of Halle, and made it an imperial city. There are four salt∣springs in the town, and a great number of boil∣ing-houses in and about it. The toll of the salt a hundred years ago amounted to five or six hundred crowns a week. Some of the boiling-houses belong to the king, some to the citizens and corporation of Halle, and some to religious foundations and churches; but of the produce of those that are the property of private persons or communities, a certain part belongs to the king. Those who rent the boiling-houses are called planners, and must be freemen of Halle; and those who boil the salt are called Hallers, who still retain the dress, language, and customs of their ancestors the Wends, or Sclavonians, who antiently inhabited this country. A great part of the salt made here is conveyed by the Elbe to Brandenburg, Pome∣rania, Silesia, and Prussia, where, as well as in Franconia, whither it is conveyed by the Achs, it is sold by the king's factors. To these salt∣springs the city of Halle owes its origin, and, in a great measure, its flourishing condition, to which the university hath also not a little contributed. This university was founded in 1694 by the elec∣tor Frederic, who was the first king of Prussia. Since that time, to the year 1744, the number
<PB N="219" REF="2240"/>
of students amounted to upwards of twenty-nine thousand, of whom two were princes, one hundred and twenty counts, two thousand two hundred and fifty-three barons and gentlemen, twelve thousand two hundred and seventy-eight students of divinity, twelve thousand six hundred and twenty-six students of law, and one thousand nine hundred and forty-one of physic. It is said to have the advantage of that of Leipsic, not only in regard to the abilities of the professors, but also to the cheapness of living and discipline. Its li∣brary consists of upwards of ten thousand volumes. Here are also a Lutheran and Calvinist gymnasium, a free secular Calvinist nunnery, three Lutheran churches, several Calvinist churches, chapels, and hospitals, a popish chapel, and a Jewish synagogue. The inhabitants, exclusive of the students and garrison, are computed at fourteen thousand. The magistrates have divers privileges, a large estate, and jurisdiction, and a fine library, which is open several days in the week for the use of the professors and students of the university. The noble foundation of the orphan-house, in this city, redounds greatly to the honour both of the pre∣sent age and protestant religion. Here is also a correction and work-house, and a variety of ma∣nufactures, as gloves, woollen and silk stockings, stuffs, fustians, cloths, flannel, linen, porcelain, tobacco-pipes, gold, silver, and plain silk ribbons, starch, metal buttons, with red and yellow Turkey leather. They have also began here to plant white mulberry-trees, for the breeding of silk∣worms. The inhabitants of this city are reck∣oned to speak the best high Dutch or German of any place in the empire, and are much com∣mended for their genteel and courteous beha∣viour. In 1757 and 1758, this town, being sur∣prized

The income arises not only from the protestant parts of Germany, but also from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Poland, Prussia, Courland, Hungary, Transylva∣nia, Swisserland, Holland, England, and even from other parts still more remote. The instruc∣tion is the same to all, whether they are orphans maintained by the foundation, or such as keep themselves, either wholly or in part. In the school are taught Latin, Greek, French, Hebrew, divinity, logic, mathematics, physic, geography, history, writing, arithmetic, epistolatory corres∣pondence, and singing, each in separate classes, by fifty preceptors, who are also students in divinity, and under two inspectors. In the house is a semi∣nary in which the preceptors are qualified for the several schools, a dispensatory, laboratory, print∣ing presses, a library, and museum. Besides the inspectors, preceptors, officers, and orphans main∣tained by the foundation, upwards of one hun∣dred students and poor scholars are allowed their dinner and supper, insomuch that near seven hun∣dred persons eat together in one hall. There are four German schools distinct from the others, taught by one hundred and ten preceptors, under two inspectors. Here is also an academy close by the orphan-house, in which young noblemen, and others of creditable parents, are, at their own ex∣pence, taught the languages and sciences by
<PB N="221" REF="2260"/>
teachers of approved abilities, under the direction of an inspector, who is always a person of distin∣guished learning and virtue. These seminaries enjoy considerable privileges, and, by royal char∣ter, are annexed to the university of Halle, and under its jurisdiction.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>BRUNSWIC-LUNEBURG.</HEAD>
<P>These territories of the house of Brunswic-Luneburg lie mostly in this circle, with a small part of them in that of Westphalia and Upper-Saxony. Those that lie in this circle are the duchies of Bremen and Lauenburg, the principa∣lities of Luneburg, Calenberg, and Grubenhagen, with their incorporated counties and lordships. In
<PB N="222" REF="2270"/>
the circle of Westphalia is the principality of Verden, with the counties of Hoya, Deepholt, Spiegelberg, and Hallermund; the two last of which are incorporated with the principality of Calenberg. In that of Upper-Saxony is only the county of Hohnstein. To these must also be added the two counties of Bentheim and Stern∣berg, in the circle of Westphalia, which were mortgaged, with the sovereignty thereof, to the electoral house. These territories are almost con∣tiguous, and are nearly equal to the electorates of Bavaria and Saxony, or the circle of Swabia, con∣taining fifty-eight cities, above sixty market-towns, and near seven hundred and fifty thousand inha∣bitants. Tho' in these countries there is much sandy, marshy, heathy, barren ground; yet there is also in them a great deal of good corn-land, yielding wheat, barley, oats, rye, pease, beans, vetches, with fruit and roots of various kinds, flax, hemp, tobacco, and some woad and mad∣der. They yield also wood, honey, wax, pitch, tar, all sorts of game, sheep, horses, black cattle, and fish. In some places, particularly in the Hartz forest, are found a variety of minerals and fossils, such as coal, slate, limestone, marble, and stone; vitriol, lapis calaminaris, sulphur, zink, cobalt, iron, lead, copper, and silver. In many places are rich salt springs, and in others plenty of turf. As to the manufactures of these territories, they consist principally of a variety of woollen cloths and stuffs, linen, thread, laces, beautiful carpets, manufactures of cotton, gold twist, galoons, fringes, sword-knots, halberds, tassels, and embroidery of all sorts, salt, tobacco-pipes, fire-arms, paper, gun-powder, colours, hats, skins, and tobacco: add to these bleaching of wax, and refining of sugar. The exports of these manufac∣tures, and the unwrought produce of the several
<PB N="223" REF="2280"/>
countries, are said to amount yearly to some thou∣sands of rix-dollars; but whether they exceed, or fall short of its importations in value, we are not told. To the education of youth, besides schools and academies, or gymnasia in the chief towns, there is an university at Gottingen, provided with very able professors, founded by his late majesty George II. With respect to religion, Lutheranism is the predominant. In some places the Roman catholics are tolerated, particularly at Hanover and Gottingen. At Norten also is a Roman ca∣tholic college, and at Marienrode a catholic con∣vent. The Romish priests of the church at Han∣over are nominated by the elector. The Calvi∣nists, and other protestants sects, together with the Jews, are tolerated and protected in the electo∣ral territories. The Jews here, according to their custom elsewhere, are allowed to chuse a rabbi, to decide their differences, and regulate what re∣gards their ceremonies and religion.</P>
<P>It being incompatible with the proposed limits of this work to trace this illustrious house from its origin, we shall only observe, that it is, as might easily be demonstrated, one of the most antient and noble in Europe; that it is allied to, and has inter∣married with, most, if not all, the sovereign fa∣milies in Christendom. To go no farther back, the two remaining branches of this house, viz. that of Brunswic Wolfenbuttel and Beveren, which is the elder, and the electoral branch of Brunswic Luneburg, are descended from the two sons of Henry, duke of Zell, who flourished in the be∣ginning of the sixteenth century. As to the elec∣toral dignity, it was obtained in the year 1692, in a great measure by the interest of William III. king of Great Britain, and prince of Orange. In that year, on the 17th of October, it was re∣solved in the college of electors at Ratisbon, that
<PB N="224" REF="2290"/>
the electoral dignity should be conferred on prince Ernest, and his heirs; and in December follow∣ing, the emperor gave him the investiture. The other colleges also of the empire, on the 30th of June, 1708, after the decease of the said elector, agreed to the establishment of the new electorate in the person of his eldest son, king George I. of Great Britain, who then took his seat in the diet as the ninth elector. His majesty has also, as elector, several votes in the diet of the empire in the college of princes and counts. He bears the title of arch-treasurer of the empire equally with the elector Palatine; and the deputies of the elec∣torate actually officiated as such at the coronation of the emperors Charles VII. and Francis I. For the defence of the empire, he contributes for all his possessions and their dependencies an electoral contingent, viz. sixty horse, and two hundred and seventy-seven foot; or, in lieu of them, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight florins monthly. To the chamber of Witzlar he pays, for the whole electorate, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars, fifty-eight kruitzers; but nominates at present, as the other electors his brethren, only one assessor. As proprietor of the duchy of Bre∣men, he is, alternately with the king of Prussia, as duke of Magdeburg, director of the circle of Lower-Saxony, in the diet of which circle he enjoys five votes in the college of princes; and in that of Westphalia one in the college of princes, and three in that of the counts. Pro∣vided he continues always a protestant, he is in∣titled to the bishopric of Osnaburg alternately with a Roman catholic bishop. Further, he has the patronage of the town of Hildesheim; and also jointly, with the house of Brunswic Wolfen∣buttel, of the abbey of Corvey, and the town of Hozter belonging thereto, together with that of
<PB N="225" REF="2300"/>
the imperial city of Goszlar. His title is duke of Brunswic and Luneburg, arch-treasurer and elector of the Holy Roman empire.</P>
<P>For the government of the electorate, the prin∣cipal college, to which all the others are subordi∣nate, is the privy council or regency, consisting of nine counsellors, each of which has his depart∣ment; but important matters are laid first before the whole council, and then before his majesty, for his instruction and approbation. The affairs of the church are managed by the consistories and superintendants. The government of the several countries, which compose this electorate, is the least despotic of any in the empire; for the elec∣tor cannot make laws, nor raise money, without the consent of the states. There are several civil courts of justice, from all which an appeal lies to the supreme court erected at Zell in 1711, the members of which are appointed partly by the states. From this court no appeal lies to the im∣perial tribunals; for the emperors Charles VI. and Francis I. granted the electoral territories a power of determining finally all causes arising within the same.</P>
<P>The revenues of the electorate, which are ma∣naged by the board of treasury, and arise principally from the demesnes, tolls, mines, salt works, taxes on land, cattle, merchandise, and public houses, are computed to amount to at least four hundred thousand pounds a year.</P>
<P>The military establishment of the electorate in time of peace is about twenty thousand men, be∣sides the invalids and militia, which make a∣bout six or seven thousand. In time of war the elector can raise, without greatly burthening his subjects, thirty or forty thousand men. As to the particular constitution of the several countries, we
<PB N="226" REF="2310"/>
shall give some account of them in our description of these countries.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DUCHY of BREMEN.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Bremen has the Weser on the west; the Elbe and part of Lunenburg on the east; the German sea on the north; and part of Verden and Oldenburg on the south. Its greatest length is about fifty miles, and breadth upwards of forty. The face of the country is entirely level, and well watered with rivers, the chief of which are the Elbe, Oste, and Weser. Along these rivers the lands are rich and fertile in corn, fruit, and pasture. But betwixt Bremen and Stade, the country is either a barren sand, or a morass. To guard the lands against inundations, to which they are exposed from the rivers, dykes and dams have been erected, and are kept in repair at a vast expence. Abundance of cattle are fed in the marshes, and sheep on the heaths; and vast quan∣tities of turf are dug in the moors, which are either carried to Hamburg and Bremen, or consumed at home. A great deal of flax is raised in this coun∣try, and some parts of it yield free-stone, and clay for earthen ware. Its situation betwixt two navigable rivers has turned the thoughts of the people much to trade. It is said of them, however, that they will fight and drink with any in Germany.</P>
<P>Till the treaty of Westphalia this country was subject to its archbishops; but was then secularized, converted into a duchy, and given to the Swedes, who continued masters of it till 1712, when it was conquered, together with Verden, by the Danes, and both sold to the elector, George I. of Great-Bri∣tain, for two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, which he obtained from his parliament, the le∣gislature
<PB N="227" REF="2320"/>
wisely judging, that it was greatly for the interest of the nation that a country lying on the Elbe and Weser, by which rivers a very valu∣able trade is carried on to and from Great-Britain, should be in his hands. In 1719, the crown of Sweden had a million of rix-dollars, in lieu of all its rights and pretensions to the duchies. The states of that of Bremen now consist of the nobi∣lity, and the deputies of the towns of Stade and Buxtehude, whose privileges are the same as those of Verden. An assembly of all the states, or a diet, cannot be held without the knowledge and consent of the regency; but the nobility may, and do assemble, twice a-year at Basdal, without giving the regency any previous notice. All the other inhabitants, besides those that have a right to sit and vote in the diets, are taxable. The of∣fice of hereditary cup-bearer belongs to the Issen∣dorf family; that of clerk of the kitchen to the Schultens vonder Luhs; and that of marshal to the barons of Marcshalke. The established religion here being Lutheranism, in the whole duchy are one hundred and eleven Lutheran churches; which, with those of Verden, are under one general su∣perintendant; but of Calvinists there are only seven congregations. At Bremen is a royal gymnasium. The manufactures of the country consist of linen, cordage, woollen cloth, and stuffs. At Ammund, in the district of Lessum, is a sugar-house, and a manufacture of porcelain. The elector of Bruns∣wic, as duke of Bremen, has a seat and vote in the diet of the empire, and circle, of the last of which, as we have already observed, he is alter∣nately director with the king of Prussia, as duke of Magdeburg. For the defence of the empire, his quota is four horse and one hundred foot; or, in lieu of them, six hundred and eighty-eight florins, monthly: and to the imperial chamber
<PB N="228" REF="2330"/>
his contribution is one hundred and eight rix∣dollars, and twenty-two kruitzers. For the go∣vernment of the duchy, and the administration of justice, there is a regency subordinate to that of Hanover, and a high court of justice, from which an appeal lies to that called the high court of Ap∣peals at Zell. The revenues here arise chiefly from the demesnes, jurisdictions, regalia, excise, stamp-duty, and contributions. As to the mili∣tia, the states were formerly obliged to furnish a corps of one hundred and thirty-seven horse, with cloathing and accoutrements; but now they pay thirty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty rix∣dollars in lieu of them. The principal places of the duchy are</P>
<P>Stade, which, next to the imperial city of Bre∣men, is the chief town of the duchy, lies on the Schwinge, about a mile from where it falls into the Elbe, and is the seat of the regency and other high colleges, being distant from Bremen forty∣four miles, and from Hamburg twenty-seven. It was formerly the capital of a marquisate of its own name, an imperial city, and one of the Hanse∣towns, and then had a great trade, and many pri∣vileges; but afterwards fell to decay, as Ham∣burg rose and flourished. However, it is still a large town, and in good condition. Here is a con∣siderable garrison, which are lodged in barracks. The magistrates have a jurisdiction not only over the town, but a large district, and levy a duty on all ships and vessels that arrive there. Its present name is thought to be derived from Statio, the name given it by the Romans, because part of their fleet was stationed there, to guard the Elbe. Its decline was owing not only to the loss of trade, but partly also to fires and sieges. In 1757, its fortifications were greatly improved, according to a plan laid before the king in 1755.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="2340"/>
Buxtehude, a small town on the Oste, fifteen miles from Hamburg and Stade, and forty-eight from Bremen. The river, which is navigable for boats up to the town, falls into the Elbe at Crantz, about four miles below the town, which stands in a pleasant fruitful country, and had its first rise and name from a nunnery. Stade and Buxtehude are the only towns in the duchy, that are of the states.</P>
<P>Bremervorde, a large village, having munici∣pal privileges, and two burgher-masters. Here stood antiently an archiepiscopal palace.</P>
<P>Zeven, or Closter-Zeven, a village noted for the convention concluded there in 1757, by the mediation of count Lynar, the Danish governor of the counties of Oldenburg and Delmenhorst, between the duke of Cumberland and the duke de Richlieu; but this convention never took place.</P>
<P>Scharmbeck, a large village, which gives name to a district, and has a woollen manufacture, from which several regiments of foot have their cloathing.</P>
<P>Hagen, a village, which gives name to a baili∣wic, and where antiently stood the oak under which the courts used to be held, called from thence Stal Ecke.</P>
<P>Stotel, a large village, which now gives name to a bailiwic, and antiently gave the title of count to a family of these parts.</P>
<P>Basdal, a village, where the nobility of the duchy hold a meeting twice a year.</P>
<P>Neuenwalde, a village, where is a foundation for ladies, consisting of an abbess, and twelve others.</P>

<HEAD>BAILIWIC of WILDESHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' this bailiwic is at present no part of the duchy of Bremen; yet, as it belongs to the same sovereign, and was formerly included in the duchy, we shall here give some account of it. It lies up∣on the Hunte, and is entirely surrounded by Oldenburg, Delmenhorst, Diepholt, and the baili∣wics of Vechte and Kloppenburg, belonging to the see of Munster. Except on the rivers Hunte and Lethe, the soil is very indifferent; notwith∣standing, it produces rye, oats, buck-wheat, sheep, wool, wax, and honey, not only enough for the inhabitants, but, of some of them at least, an overplus for exportation. In 1700 the crown of Sweden mortgaged the bailiwic, with all its de∣pendencies, to the electoral house of Brunswic-Luenburg: and in 1720, at the peace of Stock∣holm, made over all right and claim thereto, as well as to Bremen and Verden. The only place worth mentioning in it is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Wildeshausen, which lies on the Hunte, and contains about three hundred dwelling-houses, besides churches and other public buildings. One half of the inhabitants are papists, who are allowed the exercise of their religion, but no bells, church∣music, or processions; nor are they permitted to be married, buried, or baptised, by their own priests, but by a Lutheran minister. Here was antiently a rich abbey and a castle, which, toge∣ther with the walls, are now in ruins.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of LUNEBURG-ZELL.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded to the south by that of Calenberg, the diocese of Hildesheim, and
<PB N="231" REF="2360"/>
the duchy of Brunswic; to the north by the duchy of Lauenburg and the Elbe, by the last of which it is separated from the territory of the imperial city of Hamburg; to the east by the duchy of Brunswic, the Alte-Mark, and the duchy of Meck∣lenburg; and to the west by the duchies of Bre∣men and Verden, the county of Hoya, and the principality of Calenberg. The soil, except along the Elbe, Aller, and Jetze, is either sand, heath, or moors. In the more fruitful parts of it are produced wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, buck∣wheat, flax, hemp, hops, pulse, oak, beech, firs, pines, birch, and alder, together with black cat∣tle and horses. The heaths abound with bees and honey, and a small kind of sheep, whose wool is long and coarse. Lunenburg is well furnished with salt springs and limestone, and the forest of Gorde with venison. The rivers Elbe, Ilmenau, and Aller, are navigable, and consequently very advantageous to the country, independent of the fish which they yield. The general diets of this principality are convened by the sovereign twice a year, and held at Zell. They consist of the deputies of the nobility and the towns of Lune∣burg, Uelzen, and Zell, who have the nomina∣tion of the members of the high colleges, and other officers, jointly with the sovereign. There are near two hundred Lutheran churches in the coun∣try, under two general and fifteen subordinate superintendants, several grammar schools, two Calvinist churches at Zell, and an academy of exercises at Luneburg. The principal products of the country have been already mentioned. The manufactures are chiefly linen cloth, cottons, rib∣bons, stockings, hats, starch, bleached wax, refined sugar, gold and silver wires, all kinds of wooden wares, barges, boats, and ships. The exports of these to Hamburg, Lubec, and Altena, are con∣siderable.
<PB N="232" REF="2370"/>
The neighbourhood of these cities, with the facility of conveying goods and mer∣chandize to them, and other places, either by land or water, is very advantageous to this coun∣try, and contributes greatly to its subsistence. On account of this principality, the king of Great Britain has a seat and voice both in the college of the princes of the empire, and of the circle of Lower Saxony. Its quota in the Matricula is twenty horse, and one hundred and twenty foot, or seven hundred and twenty florins in lieu of them. The office of hereditary marshal here is possessed by the family of the Medings; that of sewer and cupbearer by the Behrens; that of arch treasurer by the Knesebecks; and that of taster by the Sporken family. The revenues of the principality arise chiefly from the demesnes, tolls on the Elbe, contributions, duties on cattle, beer, wine, brandy, and other commodities, which altogether must be very considerable, some baili∣wics alone yielding upwards of twenty thousand rix-dollars. The only places in it that merit par∣ticular description are,</P>
<P>Luneburg, the capital of the principality, a pretty large town on the river Elmen, or the Ilme∣nau, which is navigable from the town to the Elbe, at the distance of thirteen miles. It is twenty∣seven miles from Hamburg, forty-three from Zell, sixty-five from Brunswic, seventy-six from Bremen, and sixty-eight from Hanover. Its in∣habitants are reckoned at between eight and nine thousand. Formerly this town was one of the Hanse, and an imperial city. Some derive its name from Lina, the antient name of the Ilmenau; others from Luna, the moon, an image of which is said to have been worshipped by the inhabitants in the times of paganism. Here were antiently several convents, viz. one of Minims, another of
<PB N="233" REF="2380"/>
Premonstratensians, another of Benedictines, and a fourth of Minorites. Out of the revenues of the Benedictine monastery was founded an acade∣my for the martial exercises, where young gen∣tlemen of the principality of Luneburg are main∣tained gratis, and taught French, fencing, riding, and dancing; but foreigners are educated at a certain fixed price. A Latin school was also founded, consisting of four classes, and well-en∣dowed, out of these revenues. The superinten∣dency and management of these, and the estates appropriated to their maintainance, belongs to the landschaft director, and the ausreiter, who are both chosen from among the Luneburg nobi∣lity. The first came in place of the popish abbot, and as such is head of the states of the principality, and president of the provincial college. He has the title of excellency, and in public instruments stiles himself, By the grace of God landschaft di∣rector, and lord of the mansion of St. Michael in Luneburg. The chief public edifices are three parish churches, the ducal palace, three hospitals, the town house, the salt magazine, the anatomical theatre, the academy, the conventual church of St. Michael, in which lie interred the antient dukes, and in which is the famous table eight foot long, and four wide, plated over with chased gold, with a rim embellished with precious stones, of an immense value, which was taken from the Saracens by the emperor Otho, and presented to this church; but in 1698 a gang of thieves stripped it of two hun∣dred rubies and emeralds, together with a large diamond, and most of the gold, so that at present but a small part of it remains. Here are some very rich salt springs. Formerly, when there was a greater demand for the salt, upwards of one hun∣dred and twenty thousand tons have been annually boiled here, and sold off: but since the com∣mencement
<PB N="234" REF="2390"/>
of the present century, the salt trade hath declined greatly. A fifth of the salt made here belongs to the king, but is farmed out. Its salt is said to excel all the other salt made in Ger∣many. This town is well fortified, and has a gar∣rison, which is lodged in barracks. In the neigh∣bourhood is a good limestone quarry; and along the Elmenau are warehouses, in which are lodged goods brought from all parts of Germany, to be forwarded by the Elmenau to Hamburg, or by the Asche to Lubec, from whence other goods are brought back the same way. The town itself drives a considerable traffic in wax, honey, wool, flax, linen, salt, lime, and beer.</P>
<P>Uelzen, a neat little compact town, at the conflux of the Wiper, and other rivulets, which form the Elmenau, twenty-six miles south of Lunenburg, and thirty-three north-east of Zell. It was founded by Otho I. who in 1247 conferred on it a charter. The Elmenau was once navigable to the town, as appears by the remains of the ancient harbour still to be seen: and in the great church hangs a ship of gilt copper, presented to the corporation by the En∣glish, who traded thither. Here are several churches and alms-houses, a ducal palace, and Latin school. The town is a great thoroughfare, and was former∣ly one of the Hanse. A very fine kind of flax grows in the neighbourhood, of which a great deal of li∣nen is made. In 1750 the town had a new charter, comprising a plan for the more regular administra∣tion of justice.</P>
<P>Zell, in Latin <HI>Cella,</HI> a well built, and well forti∣fied town, on the Aller, where it is joined by the Fushe, and becomes navigable, twenty-four miles north of Hanover, thirty-two north-east of Bruns∣wick, and thirty-five south of Lunenburg. It is ve∣ry ancient, having a charter dated in 1203; and, in∣cluding the suburbs, contains about one thousand
<PB N="235" REF="2400"/>
four hundred houses. The ramparts, which are planted with trees all round, are very high, and so broad that coaches may go abreast on them. The chief public buildings in the town and suburbs, are the ducal palace, which is walled and moated round, the provincial house for the diets of the principality, several churches, a town-house, ri∣ding-house, a mews, armoury, house of correction, and several hospitals. In the suburbs, in particular, are the Hotel des Invalides, the house of correction, and the orphan-house, well endowed. Here are also the king's stables and park, in which are kept the stallions for the several studs; the French garden, planted with delightful rows of lime-trees, and ano∣ther lesser one, called the Italian garden. The duke's and other gardens, orchards, and grottoes, render the suburbs very pleasant. A considerable trade is carried on here by the Aller; besides, it is a great thoroughfare, has some manufactures, par∣ticularly of gold and silver, and is the seat of the high court of appeals and other tribunals. Many French families, the descendants of refugees and others, are settled in the town. Great quantities of corn are sent from hence to Bremen. The govern∣ment and jurisdiction of the town is partly vested in the magistrates, and partly in the burg-vogt, or castellan, and the commissary of police. In the neighbourhood is the castle of Ahlen, where the heiress of Luneburg-Zell, who was married to the elector George I. king of Great Britain, but afterwards divorced, died, after thirty years con∣finement.</P>
<P>Harburg, a considerable town on the Seeve, near its influx into the Elbe, and almost opposite to Hamburg, twenty-eight miles from Lunen∣burg, and fifty from Zell. Here is a good har∣bour and trade, being as advantageously situated as Hamburg itself, to which boats pass from
<PB N="236" REF="2410"/>
hence every day, with goods and passengers, at settled rates. The town is populous, has great privileges, and several flourishing manufactures. It is also well fortified, and has a castle with an ar∣moury, magazine, barracks, and garrison.</P>
<P>Dannenberg, which stands in the most eastern part of the duchy, on the river Jetze, six miles from its influx into the Elbe, and thirty-three south-east from Lunenburg. It gives name to a rich and fruitful district or bailiwic, and had an∣tiently a castle and counts of its own. Its name signifies a mountain of fir-trees. As the river Jetze is navigable, it is well situated for trade; but that chiefly carried on here is in beer. The noble family of Danneberg are proprietors of some lands in and near the town. In 1566 it became the residence of that line of Brunswic-Luneburg, which is now called the Wolfenbuttel-line; but in 1671 was again annexed to the principality of Luneburg, one of the dukes of which purchased it of its count in 1303.</P>
<P>Lucho, a small town with an old castle on the Jetze. It had once counts of its own, who were vassals to the dukes of Luneburg, as well as the counts of Danneberg and Welpe.</P>
<P>Bardewick, in Latin Bardorum, on the Luhe, four miles from Lunenburg. Though it is now only a straggling village, it was formerly a strong populous city, and a bishop's see. The chapter having embraced the reformation in 1529, was confirmed in the possession of its rights and estates, and consists, at present, of a dean, a senior, a sub∣senior, and eight secular canons, who have a repre∣sentative in the diet. The town has some trade with Luneburg and Hamburg, in the latter of which it has a warehouse, called the Bardewicker Zippelhaus. The old cathedral and abbey still remain, though they have been often repaired.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="2420"/>
Winsen-an-der Luhe, a small city on the Luhe, over which it has two stone bridges. Here is a ducal palace, which was the favourite residence of Dorothy, widow to duke William, and the place where she died in 1617. The town is a great thoroughfare to and from Hamburg, and gives name to a bailiwic, in which is a Lutheran abbey, consisting of a dean, a senior, and four canons, having a seat and voice in the diets.</P>
<P>Lune, a village in which is a Lutheran convent, consisting of an abbess, a prioress, and eight other ladies, and a medicinal spring.</P>
<P>Medingen, a village on the Elmenau, where is another Lutheran convent, consisting of an ab∣bess, a prioress, and twenty-three other ladies, two thirds of whom are patricians of Luneburg. Before the reformation this was a Cistercian nun∣nery.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of GRUBENHAGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is surrounded by those of Ca∣lenberg and Wolfenbuttel; the county of Werni∣gerode, the principality of Blankenburg, the county of Hohnstein, the lordship of Klettenberg,
<PB N="240" REF="2450"/>
Eichsfelde, except one part of it, which is on all sides environed by the principalities of Calenberg and Wolfenbuttel, and a part of the diocese of Hildesheim. There are some fertile spots in it, which produce wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, beans, and buck-wheat, and many which yield great quantities of flax; but its greatest treasures are hid under-ground, in its mines and quarries, in which are found slate, limestone, marble, gypsum, alabaster, a species of jasper, sand-stone, salt, zink, sulphur, cobalt, some gold, a great deal of silver, copper, iron, and lead. The mines and quarries are chiefly in the mountain and forest called the Hartz, in Latin, Sylva Hercynia, a part of which belongs to this principality, and which extends in length about fifty miles, and in breadth about eighteen. The principal rivers of this principality are, the Leine, the Oder, and Ocker. Its states are composed of the abbey of St. Alex∣ander, and that of the Blessed Virgin at Einbeck, the nobility proprietors of nine manors, and the cities of Einbeck and Osterode, at which the diets are held alternately once a year. The only reli∣gion of the country is Lutheranism, for which there are forty-one parish churches, under four superintendants, exclusive of the churches and superintendants of Einbeck and Osterode, in which towns and Clausthal are grammar-schools. The manufactures and commodities of the country, of which no inconsiderable part is exported, are flax, thread, linen, timber, sand-stone, slate, mar∣ble-works, iron, copper, lead, salt, vitriol, sul∣phur, lapis calaminaris, zink, powder-blue, starch, several sorts of woollen manufactures, printed cottons, fire-arms, and fatted sheep. The inhabi∣tants owe their subsistence partly also to their fo∣rests of oak, beech, pine, birch, and alder. On
<PB N="241" REF="2460"/>
account of this principality, the electors have a vote in the college of princes both at the diet of the empire, and that of Lower Saxony. Its matricu∣lar quota is five horse, or sixty florins. From the sovereign's bailiwics here, and the magistrates of Einbeck and Osterode, appeals lie to the chancery at Hanover. The revenues of the sovereign arise chiefly from the demesnes and the mines. All the country, the Harz only excepted, pays the mili∣tary tax, called the Licent, and magazine-corn, which is-payable either in kind, or money, for the subsistence of the garrisons in the towns. The principal places in the country are</P>
<P>Einbeck, the capital of the principality, which stands on the Ilme, near where it falls into the Leine, twenty miles from Gottengen, twenty∣eight from Hamelen, and forty-two from Hano∣ver, in a fine corn country, and is well fortified with ramparts, bulwarks, towers, a double ditch, and outworks. It was formerly an imperial free∣town, and its magistrates are still possessed of the high and low jurisdiction, and have precedence at the diets. It is a pretty large town, divided into three parishes, called the Markt, the Newstadt, and the Munster, and drives a good trade in beer, woollen manufactures, and printed cottons. Here was antiently a bishop's see, the cathedral of which still remains, with the chapter, consisting of a Lutheran senior, nine canons, one vicar, and four vicarii ordinarii, which send a deputy to the diet. The incomes belonging to the antient ab∣bey of the Blessed Virgin are now enjoyed by a senior and nine canons, who have also a represen∣tative at the diets. This was a town so early as the year 1256, and formerly it coined money in gold, silver and copper. There is a large district belonging to it, and subject, in a great measure, to its jurisdiction.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="2470"/>
Osterode, a town situated not far from the Harz, is divided into the new and old town, and contains about five hundred and eighty houses, with a castle, in which several dukes of Brunswic and Luneburg have resided, a granary, which cost thirty thousand rix-dollars, whence the la∣bourers and miners in the Harz are always supplied with rye at a fixed price, three parish-churches, and a grammar-school. This town also is noted for its fine woollen cloths.</P>
<P>Not far from the town stood Grubenhagen, formerly a castle on a hill, so called from the no∣ble family of Gruben, now extinct, from which both the hill and principality took their names.</P>
<P>Salzder Helden, a town upon the Leine, in which, and the neighbouring village of Sulbeck, are salt-works.</P>
<P>Herzberg, a large town situated on the Sieber, having a castle, iron-works, and a linen manufac∣ture. Round the town are pits always full of wa∣ter, and well stored with fish. The castle was antiently the usual residence of the dukes of Gru∣benhagen.</P>
<P>Scharzfels, a castle seated on a high rock upon the top of a mountain, which antiently gave title to counts, and a county. It is now sometimes used as a state-prison, and has a small garrison. Near it are five caverns called the Scharzfeld caves, in which is found the ebur-fossile, and abundance of drop-stone. This castle also gives name to a bai∣liwic on the borders of the Harz, or Hartz, in which are copper and iron-works, chalk-pits, and quarries, with plenty of flax, and a linen manu∣facture.</P>
<P>Lauterburg, or Lutterberg, a town situated on the Oder, which had formerly counts, and gave name to a county. It is now held as a fief of the abbey of Quedlinburg, and inhabited chiefly by
<PB N="243" REF="2480"/>
miners, and mine and forest-officers; for in its neighbourhood are some mines of copper and iron, with forges.</P>
<P>Elbingerode, a handsome little town, the seat of a bailiwic, which abounds with woods of pine, and marble, slate, and iron-ore. There are also two warm springs in it, and two kinds of jasper are found in the ground and rivers. In this bai∣liwic also, at the village of Lucashof, is a mill for sawing marble, and making tables, stoves, &amp;c. of it; and at Ludershof and the Neue-Hutte, are flatting-mills. At Konigshoff, stood antiently the palace of Konigsburg, where the kings and empe∣rors of the Saxon race used to reside, when they took the diversion of stag-hunting in the neigh∣bouring forest. The country hereabouts is held as a fief of the abbey of Gandersheim, upon which it was conferred by the emperor Henry II.</P>
<P>Clausthal, an open spacious mine-town, con∣taining upwards of nine hundred houses, and about ten thousand inhabitants. Here is a silver smelting house, and a mint, in which between four and five hundred thousand rix-dollars are an∣nually coined, a small garrison of invalids, two churches, an orphan-house, grammar-school, and a mine and forest bailiwic-office for that part of the Harz belonging to the elector of Brunswic. The air on the Hartz, for a great part of the year, is so cold, and rain, snow, and fogs, so frequent, that tillage and the cultivation of fruits turn to no account. The forest that covers the mountain consists of oak, beech, ash, aspin, alder, birch, pines, and firs. The great plenty of wood here is of the utmost importance, as without it the mine-works could not be carried on. The metals and minerals found in these mountains have been already mentioned. That called the Brunswic-Luneburg Harz is divided into the upper and
<PB N="244" REF="2490"/>
lower, and belongs partly to the elector, and partly to the duke of Brunswic. The same tract is also divided into mine and forest bailiwics, having its particular courts of justice, civil and criminal, and its governors or directors, and other officers. The neat produce of the whole Brunswic-Luneburg Harz, after a deduction of all charges, amounts to about four hundred and twenty-five thousand, three hundred rix-dollars. The inhabitants of the Harz are composed of miners, labourers in the smelting-houses, wood-hewers, carriers, the sove∣reign's officers and servants, ministers, school∣masters, and handicraftsmen.</P>
<P>Altenau, a small mine-town in a valley, sur∣rounded by rugged mountains. Here is also a silver smelting-house, the aqua fortis of which runs into the Ocker.</P>
<P>St. Andreasberg, another mine-town with a sil∣ver smelting-house, and a manufactory of powder∣blue. Near this place is a reservoir, whence, by a canal, water is conveyed to all the mine∣works; so that, in the greatest drought, they ne∣ver want water.</P>
<P>Cellerfeld, an open mine-town, in which is a mint, common to the elector and duke, where be∣tween two hundred and fifty and three hundred thousand rix-dollars are annually coined in silver specie.</P>
<P>Wildeman, a mine-town, surrounded on all sides by lofty rugged mountains. Here also, and at Lautenthal and Schulenberg, are smelting∣houses, all for the Upper Harz. In the Lower Harz are twelve mines, four of which be∣long to the imperial city of Goszlar; but, accord∣ing to an agreement formerly made, a certain portion of the ore must be delivered by the city to the sovereign gratis, and the rest at a certain price, which is now too low, on pain of forfeiting
<PB N="245" REF="2500"/>
its forest right. The principal smelting-house for the Lower Harz is at Goszlar.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of CALENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is intersected by that of Wolf∣enbuttel. Of the two parts, that which lies to∣wards the north is surrounded by the principality of Luneburg, the diocese of Hildesheim, the principality of Wolfenbuttel, the counties of Pyrmont, Lippe, Schauenburg, Hoya, and the principality of Minden; but that towards the south, by the principalities of Wolfenbuttel and Grubenhagen, and the territories of Eichsfelde and Lower Hesse. Though a considerable part of this principality consists of barren mountains, moors, heaths, and sands, yet there are a great many fruitful tracts in it, which yield plenty of corn, flax, pulse, fruit, and tobacco. Nor is it without fine woods of oak, beech, alder, pine, birch, asp, &amp;c. nor, consequently, timber for building ships or houses, wood for fuel and other uses, and mastage for feeding hogs. Abundance also of black cattle, horses, and sheep, are bred in it, and it is well supplied with venison, game, and fish. Further, in several places, are found marle, turf, coal-pits, salt-springs, quarries of free-stone, mill stone, and rich iron-ore. At Rehburg is also a medicinal spring. In this principality are nineteen cities, of which those of Gottingen, Ha∣nover, Nordheim, and Hamelen, are called the great, and the others the small, and seventeen towns. The estates are divided into the Ritter∣maszige, which entitle the proprietors to a seat and voice at the diets, and are exempt from all contributions; and the Freye, which neither en∣title to a seat, nor are exempt from contributions. In the principality are three protestant abbies and
<PB N="246" REF="2510"/>
six convents, of which three are inhabited by men, and five by women. Of the prelates, i. e. the possessors of the abbies and convents, and the no∣bility, i. e. the proprietors of the Rittermaszige estates, and certain towns, are the states and diets composed, which are held once a year at Hano∣ver, consisting of the representatives of these states. The Lutherans, whose religion is predo∣minant here, have upwards of two hundred churches, exclusive of those in the county of Spie∣gelberg, which shall be described in the circle of Westphalia, with superintendants, general and particular, as in other Lutheran countries. The Calvinists have five churches, and the Roman ca∣tholics six churches or chapels. For the education of youth, and the improvement of the sciences, besides grammar-schools in the chief towns, there is a flourishing university at Gottingen, with a royal academy of sciences, and a royal German society. The products of the country we have already mentioned. Of its manufactures, the principal are those of wool, flax, cotton, silk, to∣bacco, iron, copper, brass, glass, leather, &amp;c. The woollen cloths and stuffs of Gottingen are said to equal those of Holland, both in colour and fineness, and yet are sold at a very moderate price. In different places of the principality, galloons, gold and silver lace, fringes, tassels, em∣broideries, gunpowder, and stone wares are made; likewise linen and carpets printed and painted, and vessels built for exporting these manufactures and commodities to Hamburg, Bremen, and other places by the Weser and Leine, and importing others, in which a large trade is carried on. This principality is a part of the duchy of Brunswic, and includes in it the country of Gottingen, which was once a distinct principality, but has long been incorporated with Calenberg. In the year 1757,
<PB N="247" REF="2520"/>
it fell into the bands of the French, by which it suffered greatly, though they were but a short time in possession of it. The proprietor of it is intitled to a vote in the college of princes at the diet of the empire, and those of the circle. Its marricular assessment is twenty-two horse and a half, and one hundred and forty foot; or six hun∣dred and eighty six florins monthly, in lieu of them. To the supreme tribunal at Hanover it nominates two assessors, and two to the high court of appeal at Zell. The sovereign's revenues arise chiefly from the demesnes, the regalia, the excise on foreign brandies, and the greatest part of those distilled in the country. Here is also levied the military tax, called the licent, a stamp-duty, a duty on corn, cattle, and sheep, with magazine and corn-money, &amp;c. The whole principality is divided into three quarters or departments, the principal places in which are,</P>
<P>Hanover, the capital not only of the principa∣lity, but of the whole electorate, though in rank only the second of the four great cities in the prin∣cipality. It was long the seat of the dukes and electors, and once it was an imperial city, and one of the Hanse. It is divided into the old and new towns by the river Leine, which is here navigable for small boats, standing twenty-six miles from Zell, and about the same distance from Brunswic. It had its name from a ferry here, Hanover former∣ly, in the old Saxon, signifying the same as Have-Over in English. The streets are regular, broad, and well lighted, but many of the houses are of timber and clay. The principal buildings are the electoral palace, which, having been destroyed by fire, was, in 1741, rebuilt with great magnifi∣cence. This palace fronts the Leine, and is richly furnished, and adorned with tapestry and paintings, a fine opera house and theatre, a noble
<PB N="248" REF="2530"/>
collection of rarities, and medals ancient and mo∣dern. In the church belonging to it, which is very splendid, is kept a treasure of great value, consisting of reliques, gold and silver plate, and gems, collected by duke Henry the Lion, in the East, in 1171, and the succeeding years. The other chief public and private structures are the armoury, the fine house belonging to Mr. Busch, the privy-counsellor, the stately structure wherein the Calenberg diets are held, the elector's fine stables, the Lockumer-hof, where the abbot of the convent of Lockum resides, the orphan-house, the hospital of the Holy Ghost, the house of cor∣rection, the spinning-house, the poor-house, and several churches. All these stand in the Alstadt, or old town. In the Newstadt, on the other side the Leine, is the church of St. John's, the build∣ing wherein the consistory assembles, a large stone edifice, in which are kept the electoral ar∣chives and library, which is one of the largest and most splendid in Germany, a free-school, a Jewish synagogue, a Roman catholic and two Calvinist churches, besides several palaces. In 1241 this town was transferred by Conrad, count of Lauen∣rode, at that time proprietor of it, to duke Otho the Child. The great number of kitchen and pleasure gardens, and fine seats, make the envi∣rons very pleasant. Without the Steinthor, or Sone-gate, is a most delightful vista, leading to Mount Brillant and Herenhausen, two electoral palaces. The gardens belonging to the latter are very noble. They contain one of the finest orangeries in Europe, a very grand jet d'eau, no∣ble fountains, basons, and cascades, a wilderness of evergreens, and a perfect theatre, with arbours and summer-houses on both sides of it, for the actors to dress in.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="2540"/>
Munder, a small town, situated on the Hamel, where is a salt-work.</P>
<P>Wunstorf, a small town, which formerly had counts, and gave name to a county, is now the seat of a superintendency, and a Lutheran abbey, to which belong an abbess and four conventualists, who must all be of noble birth, together with se∣veral canons, the senior of whom is the superinten∣dant. This abbey, which was founded in 870, by a bishop of Minden, in bonour of St. Cosmas and Damian, has a seat and vote in the diets of the principality.</P>
<P>Pattensen, a small town, but antiently surround∣ed with walls, ramparts, and moats.</P>
<P>Eldagsen, a small town, not far from the Aller. This town had formerly a rampart, walls, and ditch, and constituted a part of the county of Haller∣mund, whose antient counts had a palace here.</P>
<P>Lockum, a village, near which is a Lutheran abbey, consisting at present of an abbot, a prior, three conventuals, a preacher, a rector for the school, and a few hospitallers. The abbot is the first prelate, state, and provincial-counsellor of the principality of Calenberg.</P>
<P>Marienrode, a convent of Roman catholic monks, lying half a German mile from Hilde∣sheim. It consists of an abbot, who is one of the states of Calenberg, nineteen patres, and six bro∣thers.</P>
<P>Mariensee, Marienwarder, Wennigsen, Wul∣singhausen, Lutheran convents for ladies, which have a right to send representatives to the assem∣blies of the states.</P>
<P>Barsinghausen, a village, in which also is a Lu∣theran convent for ladies, entitled to a seat and vote in the diets.</P>
<P>Calenberg, an antient ducal palace, from which the principality took its name.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="2550"/>
Ricklingen, a parochial village, near which is a stone-monument, erected to duke Albert of Saxony, who, in 1385, besieging the castle, had his leg shattered, which occasioned his death.</P>
<P>Newstadtam Rubenberge, a small town on the Leine, over which there are two stone bridges. Here is a free stone sluice on the Leine; and for∣merly on the hill, from which the town takes its name, was a castle so strong, that it was called Landestrost, or the country's comfort. The town gives name to a bailiwic, and superinendency, and antiently was often the residence of the county of Welpe.</P>
<P>Rehburg, a small town, and the seat of a baili∣wic, which yields a great deal of grain, flax, and hops; and contains woods of oak and beech, coal∣pits, and a medicinal spring.</P>
<P>Limner, a village, which had antiently a castle and counts of its own.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The SECOND QUARTER is that of HAMELEN and LAUENAU,</HEAD>
<P>In which are three towns, ten boroughs, one deanry, one hundred and twenty-eight villages, and one hundred and sixty-four estates, qualifying for the diet. The chief places in this quarter are,</P>
<P>Hamelen, an antient city, twenty-three miles south-west from Hanover, forty-five north of Got∣tingen, and forty-one south of Brunswic, is the fourth in rank of the large towns in the prin∣cipality of Calenberg. It lies in a fine country on the Hamel, whence it has its name, and which, after filling the town-moats, falls into the Weser, by which the town is washed on the west. On the last of these rivers an admirable sluice was finished in 1734, at the expence of eighty-thou∣sand rix-dollars. Over it also is a bridge of nine
<PB N="251" REF="2560"/>
wooden arches. The other public edifices are the abbey, two Lutheran, and one Calvinist church, a town-house, a free-school, an hospital, and poor house, with barracks for a whole battalion. The town has large privileges and a great estate, with the civil and criminal jurisdiction within its liber∣ties, which are extensive. Here are woollen, silk, and linen manufactures, a mint, and a great many leather dressers. Within its liberties are several villages, forests, and a ferry. The abbot of Fulda, who was formerly sovereign of the town, having sold it to the bishop of Minden, when the latter came to take possession of it, the citizens opposed him, but were defeated, with great slaughter, near Sedemunde. This event is supposed, and not without probability, to have given rise to the story of the piper and children, of which the re∣cords of the town are said to make mention, but falsely. The prior of the abbey, and the counts of Eberstein, had also formerly several rights and prerogatives in the town; but the town-council, by degrees, acquired a right to most of these. The above-mentioned abbey, in the sixteenth cen∣tury, after a long opposition, joined in the refor∣mation, and now consists of a prior, a dean, and some canons, who are intitled to a seat and vote in the provincial diets. Among its reliques is an arm of St. Boniface, and his gospel. It is possessed of the civil jurisdiction over its members, officers, and curates, and, in conjunction with the deputies of the town-council, occasionally holds courts, for the determining differences among the abbey∣tenants.</P>
<P>Bodenwerder, in Latin Bodonis Insula, a small town, lying on the Weser, over one branch of which there is a bridge, and over another a ferry. It is much exposed to inundations from the river,

but has some trade with Bremen and Hamburg in coarse linen.</P>
<P>Springe a small town, the seat of a bailiwic, in which are some fine woods, salt springs, good pit-coal, and manufactures of glass, earthen-ware, and linen. The principal trade of the town con∣sists in a kind of beer, called brochan. It be∣longed formerly to the counts of Hallermund.</P>
<P>Lauenstein, the capital of a bailiwic, in which are salt-springs, a coal-mine, a glass-house, and linen manufacture. The town was formerly walled, and near it stood a castle, which was once the re∣sidence of the lords of Homburg, and of which there are still some remains. Not far from it stood also the castle of Spiegelberg, which gave title to the antient counts of that name; but of this there are now no vestiges.</P>
<P>Hemmendorf, a village on the Saale, where the states of Calenberg used to meet before the build∣ing of the provincial house at Hanover.</P>
<P>Dorpe, a village noted for its manufactory of a yellow earthen ware, and its black furniture for stoves.</P>
<P>Salz-Hemmendorf, a borough, in which are three salt springs, and twelve boiling-houses, three of which belong to the sovereign.</P>
<P>Duingen, a borough, where is a noted manu∣factory of stone-ware.</P>
<P>Grohnde, a borough on the Weser, where is a ferry and toll.</P>
<P>Polle, a borough on the Weser, and the seat of a bailiwic, in which thread stockings are knit, vessels for the Weser built, good lime made, and whence large quantities of ship-timber, and other wood, are carried to Bremen.</P>
<P>Erzen, a market-town, seated on the Humme, and the seat of a bailiwie.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="2580"/>
Schwobber, a manor belonging to the family of Munch-hausen, and qualifying for the diet. The manor-house and gardens are very fine.</P>

<P>Lauenau, a market-town, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The THIRD QUARTER is that of GOTTINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This was once a distinct principality, and contains twelve great and small towns, eight secu∣larized convents, fifteen royal bailiwics, eleven noblemen's jurisdictions, and one hundred and seventy-nine villages. The most considerable places in it are,</P>
<P>Gottingen, which gives name to the quarter, and is the chief of the four great towns in the princi∣pality. It stands on the New Leine, which is a canal drawn from the Old, about fifty miles from Hanover. It is one of the strongest, best built, and paved towns, in all Lower Saxony. The an∣tient gymnasium here was, in 1734, converted, by his late majesty, king George II. into an uni∣versity; which, by the care of its present curator, baron Munch-hausen, has acquired a great repu∣tation. Its library belonging to it is said to be one of the best in Germany. Here is also a fine observatory, an anatomical theatre, a physic gar∣den, a school for teaching midwifry, an academy of exercises, sciences, and belles lettres, and a German society, which are all included under, and belong to the university. The Latin free-school has eight masters, and is under very good regula∣tions. Int his town are many flourishing manufac∣tures, of which mention has been made already. The smoaked puddings or sausages made here, called in German, Gottingen Metwurste, are in great
<PB N="254" REF="2590"/>
esteem, and exported far and near. Here is a com∣mandery of the Teutonic order, an armoury, six Lutheran, and one Calvinist church, an alms∣house, with a church belonging to it, and an or∣phan-house. On a hill in the territory belonging to the town antiently stood an imperial burg and palatine town, called Grone, which was the prin∣cipal residence of the Saxon emperors after Otho the Great. The town's estate and jurisdiction are very considerable, consisting of several villages, woods, meadows, and pastures. Formerly it was one of the Hanse, and coined pieces both in gold and silver. In 1757 and 58, it was, for some time, in the hands of the French.</P>
<P>Northeim, a considerable town, situated on the Ruhme, where it divides itself into two branches, over each of which is a bridge of stone, it is the third in rank of the great towns in this principality. Here are some manufactures, a parish church, a free-school, and antiently there was a Benedictine convent for both sexes, founded in 1051 by Otho, duke of Bavaria. This town had once counts of its own.</P>
<P>Munden, a town situated in a vale on the Fulda, which a little below joins the Werra, and then the united streams take the name of the Weser. These rivers, with the islands they form, and the neigh∣bouring gardens, woods, and hills, present to the spectator a most delightful prospect. Here is a bridge over the Werra, two Lutheran and one Cal∣vinist church, a free-school, and barracks for a regi∣ment. There are no less than two thousand gar∣dens belonging to the town, with manufactures of silk, flax, and tobacco. It is the centre of the trade carried on from Hesse, Thuringia, Saxony, Frank∣fort, Franconia, Nuremberg, Bavaria, &amp;c. up and down the Weser. All these places have their correspondents and factors at this town. No one,
<PB N="255" REF="2600"/>
who is not a freeman of Munden, is allowed to trade beyond this town, but must consign his goods to a factor here; and whatever is brought in a vessel must, by virtue of the staple right, granted and confirmed to the town in 1246, 1279, 1289, 1292, and further ratified in 1597, by the emperor Rodolph II. be unladen here. Every Tuesday and Friday a vessel goes from hence to Cassel up the Fulda, which river none but freemen of Munden are allowed to navigate. The Werra may be navigated both by Munden and Hessian vessels; but the latter, on coming off Munden, are not to proceed without a licence, which is granted in writing, after paying a duty to the town, and taking on board a Munden master. This town has its representative in the lesser com∣mittee of the states, and the commission of taxes. Its most antient charter bears date in 1246. It hath often suffered by war and sieges; and no longer ago than 1757 and 8, it was for some time in the hands of the French.</P>
<P>Dransfeld, a small town between Munden and Gottingen.</P>
<P>Moringen, a small town on the little river Mohr, from which it takes its name. It is now an open place, but was formerly fortified with ram∣parts, walls, and moats. Here was also formerly a castle called Moringenburg, well fortified, in which several dukes have resided. The town hath often suffered by fire and war; but at present makes a good appearance.</P>
<P>Uslar, a small town in a valley, divided into the Old and New, the former of which is walled. From this town the noble family of Uslar takes its name.</P>
<P>Hardegsen, a small town on the Espolde, but the seat of a superintendency and bailiwic. Here
<PB N="256" REF="2610"/>
was formerly a castle, in which some of the dukes at times resided.</P>
<P>Bursfeld, antiently one of the most celebrated convents of Benedictine monks in all Germany. It had the privilege of electing its own patron and abbot, also that of coinage, and holding a market. In the sixteenth century it embraced Lutheranism, and its lands are now farmed to a bailiff,</P>
<P>Hedemunden, a small town on the Werra. Here is a linen manufacture, and a superintendant.</P>
<P>Sichelstein, a village, where formerly stood a castle. As its name is the same as Sickle Stone in English, the Hessians called a castle which they erected opposite to it Sensenstein, i. e. Scythe-stone.</P>
<P>Lauenforde, a market-town on the Weser, where a toll is paid, and a bailiff has his seat.</P>
<P>Norton, a market town near the Leine, in which is a Roman catholic abbey, subject to the archbishop of Mentz.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of WOLFENBUTTEL.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is a part of the duchy of Brunswic, and is divided into two parts by the diocese of Hildesheim, and the principality of Halberstadt. That part which lies towards the north is surrounded by the principality of Lune∣burg, the mark of Brandenburg, the duchy of Magdeburg, the principality of Halberstadt, and the diocese of Hildesheim; by the two last of which, and the principalities of Grubenhagen and Calen∣berg, the counties of Wernigerode and Lippe, and the territory of Corvey abbey, the south part is environed, which consists mostly of hills and woods, some of which lie in the Harz, and contain rich mines and salt works. On this
<PB N="257" REF="2620"/>
side are likewise some glass and porcelain manu∣factures, but little corn land. The north part of the principality is more level, and produces con∣siderable quantities of grain, flax, hemp, pulse, and fruit. Here also the breeding of cattle, and the culture of silk, are followed. The principal rivers by which the country is watered, are the Weser, Leine, Schunter, Ocker, and Aller. In the principality are ten boroughs, eight market∣towns, three hundred and eighty-six villages, and seventeen sees and convents. The states of it consist of the deans of the sees and priors of the convents, the nobility who possess manors in the country, and the deputies of the oldest towns. These states are divided into the greater and lesser committee; and the diets, which are held at Brunswic, meet four times a year. The establish∣ed religion here is Lutheranism, under the inspec∣tion of general and subordinate superintendants. At Brunswic, both the Calvinists and Papists have each a church. The products of the country have been mentioned. As to manufactures, the chief are those of flax, wool, silk, tobacco, glass, lead, iron, steel, and other minerals. There is also a manu∣facture of porcelain, and a wax bleachery. Bruns∣wic is noted for its mum, and Konigslutter for its beer. At the former of these towns are two great annual fairs. For the instruction of youth, besides Latin schools in several places, there is a college at Brunswic, and an university at Helm∣stedt. This principality, which Henry the Mag∣nanimous brought to the house of Welpho, by marrying Gertrude, daughter to the emperor Lo∣thario, gives a title to a vote among the princes, both at the diets of the empire, and those of the circle. The house of Wolfenbuttel, when the reigning prince happens to be older than that of Hanover, has the precedence at the diets, and the
<PB N="258" REF="2630"/>
joint directory of the circle. The matricular assess∣ment of the principality is twenty-two horse and a half, and one hundred and five foot, or in lieu of them seven hundred and thirty-four florins month∣ly. To the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes two hundred and seventy-eight rixdollars, thirty-six kruitzers. As to the hereditary officers here, the Olderhausen family are hereditary marshals; that of Veltheim, sewers; that of Schliestedt, cup∣bearers; and that of Cramm, treasurers. The high colleges for this principality are the privy council, the treasury, the convent-office, the chancery, the high-court of justice, and the con∣sistory for ecclesiastical affairs. A considerable part of the prince's revenues arises from the treasury-bai∣liwics, regalia, and conventual estates. But there are also a great many taxes, excises, and imposts, levied upon the country. The duke's troops a∣mount to above four thousand men; and he is able to bring into the field twelve or fourteen thousand. His court is numerous, and wants not for magnificence. His title is only that of duke of Brunswic and Luneburg. The whole country is divided into four districts, viz. those of Wolfen∣buttel, Schening, the Harz, and the Weser. In the first the principal places are,</P>
<P>Brunswic, the capital of the country, and the residence of the duke. It lies fifty-one miles west of Magdeburg, sixty east of the river Weser, seven∣ty west of the Elbe, and had its name from Bruno, a duke of Saxony, who first built it in 861. It was once an imperial city, and one of the Hanse; and tho' still rich and populous, is much short of what it was when free. This city stands upon the Ocker, is strongly fortified, and pretty well built and paved; but the number of its inhabitants are not proportionate to its extent. It is divided into the Old and New Town, and is about two miles
<PB N="259" REF="2640"/>
in compass. Here are a great number of ingenious artisans, and several manufactures. Their chief trade is in leather, hops, butter, and the strong beer, called mum, from its inventor Christian Mum, of which great quantities are exported, even as far as Asia. The chief public buildings are, the ducal palace, which is large and mag∣nificent, richly furnished, and contains very fine pictures; a cabinet of curiosities, and a splendid library, in which are above a thousand volumes of scarce and curious Bibles, or parts of Bibles, in several languages; an academy for martial exer∣cises; the cavalier-house; the armoury; Caroline∣college, founded by the present duke; the new play-house; the packhof, in which all goods im∣ported or exported are rated and taxed, and which is said to yield two hundred thousand rix-dollars per annum; the council houses in the New and Old-town; the house of correction; the mint; the orphan-house; ten Lutheran churches, (of which the cathedral, dedicated to St. Blasius, has a chapter, and contains the records of the electoral family of Brunswic Luneburg, with the ducal burial place, and two fine large monuments of duke Henry the Lion, and his second consort; and in that of St. Giles's is a convent for twelve ladies, and a prioress) a Calvinist church, and another for the Roman catholics; two gymnasiums, with an anatomy and surgery-school, the latter of which was found∣ed by the present duke; a college for the study of physic, instituted in 1747, and a lazaratta, both built by the present munificent duke Charles. Add to these St. Leonard's hospital, the old castle, called the Mosthaus, or Moshof, and the Tem∣plehof; the latter of which belonged antiently to the Knights Templars, but is now a college, consisting of a dean, another ecclesiastic, and two lay members, who are usually magistrates. The
<PB N="260" REF="2650"/>
chapter of the cathedral consists of a provost, a dean, a senior, ten canons, and several inferior prebendaries and vicars. The dean is the first member of the states. The Lutheran foundation of St. Cyriac consists of a dean, who is one of the states, and great committee, and of five canons. About two miles from Bruns∣wic is the Lutheran convent of Riddagshausen, which is also one of the states, and a member of the greater committee. The ramparts of this city are planted with mulberry-trees, and the gardens be∣longing to the ducal palace are laid out in an ex∣quisite taste. Here in 1530 the first spinning-wheels were invented by one Jurgen, a stone-cutter and statuary. This city was the first of any note that embraced the Reformation. The road from hence to Wolfenbuttel is paved, and lined on both sides with trees. The magistracy of the city are posses∣sed of the high and low jurisdiction, and it has likewise its own superintendant and spiritual court. In 1757 the French got possession of it, but quit∣ted it again in 1758. Without St. Peter's-gate is the Lutheran convent of Heiligen Kreuz, or Holy-Cross, which has a church of its own.</P>
<P>Wolfenbuttel, which stands on the Ocker, se∣ven miles south-east of Brunswic, and gives name to the principality, is the seat of several high colleges, and formerly had dukes of its own, who became extinct in 1735. The principal public edifices here are the castle, where the duke used generally to reside, the arsenal, the duke's library, which is one of the best in Germany, the great ducal school, the riding-school, and several churches, of which the principal is that called the great church, dedicated to Our Lady. The Ocker has been made navigable betwixt this town and Brunswic. There is a good garrison here as well as at Brunswic, and the town is so well fortified, that it is reckon∣ed one of the strongest in Germany. It is not half so big as Brunswic, and the houses are mostly of
<PB N="261" REF="2660"/>
timber. The furniture and paintings of the palace, and that of Salzdalum, about a league from the town, are extremely fine, as well as the cabinet of rarities. In the ducal library, besides a vast col∣lection of other books and manuscripts, are forty∣one volumes, writ by the learned duke Augustus, the founder of it, twelve of which are on music, with a Commentary on Trithemius's Cryptography, and a very learned tract on the antiquity and mys∣tery of the game of chess. At a small distance from hence is the Lutheran abbey of Steterburg, consisting of an abbess, a provost, and several la∣dies, which has a representative in the diet.</P>
<P>Scheppenstadt, a borough, seated on the Al∣tenau, and the seat of a superindency.</P>
<P>Salzdalum, a village, which gives name to a bailiwic, and takes its own from a considerable salt-work in its neighbourhood. The magnifi∣cent ducal palace here, already mentioned, contains in its gallery above one thousand pictures, by the best masters, besides those in the lesser gal∣lery. In the china cabinet are above eight thou∣sand pieces of exquisite beauty; and, in another, above a thousand enamels of Raphael de Urbino, admirably executed. The great gallery is two hundred feet long, fifty broad, and forty high; and the lesser one hundred and sixty long, and twenty broad. In the latter, besides the above cabinet, are six small ones for curiosities of art and nature. The gardens too, and the chapel, are extremely grand. Adjoining to the palace is a convent, founded by duke Anthony Ulrich and his duchess, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in which there is a domina, fifteen sisters of no∣ble families, with a provost: it also sends a re∣presentative to the diets.</P>
<P>Lucklum, a village, where is a commandery of the Tuetonic order, which entitles to a seat in the liet.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="262" REF="2670"/>
<HEAD>In the SECOND or SCHENING DISTRICT the most remarkable places are,</HEAD>
<P>Helmstedt, a considerable town, in which are three churches, a grammar school, and a cele∣brated university, to the prosperity and honour of which nothing that could conduce has been omitted by the present duke. Belonging to it are an excellent physic-garden, a library, a Ger∣man society, and a seminary of divines. Here is also a Benedictine convent, subject to the imperial abbey of Werden, in the circle of Westphalia. In 1751 a chalybeat spring, of singular virtue, was discovered a little way out of the town.</P>
<P>Scheningen, a small town, with a superinten∣dency, and Latin school. Near it is a salt-work, and a convent, consisting formerly of Augustine canons, but now of a Lutheran provost, a prior, and conventuals, having a seat and vote in the diets of the duchy.</P>
<P>Konigsiutter, a small town standing on the rivu∣let of Lutter, is noted for a particular kind of beer, called Duckstein. Here was antiently a Benedictine monastery, which at present consists of a Lutheran abbot, a prior, and four conven∣tuals. In its church lies buried the emperor Lo∣tharius, with Richenza his consort, and duke Henry the Magnanimous. It takes precedence of all the other convents in the principality, and sends a representative to the diet and grand committee. A stratum of tophus begins near the convent, and runs under it and the town.</P>
<P>Marienthal, anciently a monastery of Cistercian monks, which are now changed into a Lutheran ab∣bot, a prior, and four conventuals, stands about two miles from Helmstadt, and has a school, in which a certain number of young people are maintained and instructed gratis.</P>
<P>Marienberg, anciently an Augustine nunnery, which now consists of a Lutheran domina, a pro∣vost,
<PB N="262" REF="2680"/>
and conventualists, and is intitled to a seat in the diet.</P>
<P>Hessen, a village which gives name to a baili∣wic, and at which is a ducal palace, with a beauti∣ful garden.</P>
<P>Vorsfeld, a market-town on the Aller, and the seat of a bailiwic and superintendency.</P>
<P>Calvorde, a small town, situated on the Ohre, near which stands an old walled castle.</P>
<P>Supplingenburg, a commandery belonging to the Senneburg grand-mastership of the order of St. John. These grand-masters, and the dukes of Brunswick, dispose of it alternately; but it must be always to a prince of Brunswick, who has been pre∣viously elected a knight.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the HARZ DISTRICT are,</HEAD>
<P>Gandersheim, a small mean town on the little ri∣ver Gande, where is a ducal seat, a bailiwic house, a free school, and a free secular foundation, which at present is Lutheran, and consists of an abbess, a dean, and eleven canonesses, who wear no particular dress except a cross fastened to a pale blue ribbon. To this foundation also belongs eight canons and capi∣tulars. The abbey, tho' under the patronage of the dukes of Brunswick, has a seat and voice in the diet of the empire, and likewise among the prelates of the Rhine. To it, moreover, appertain the foun∣dations of Brunshausen and Clus, together with several bailiwics.</P>
<P>Seesen, a little town, so named from an adjacent lake. It is the seat of a general superintendency, and a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Gittel, a small town, where is an iron foundery, belonging, in common, to the elector and duke of Brunswic. The ore used in it is brought from the mine town of Grund. There are other founderies in the same bailiwic.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="2690"/>
Julius Halle, a salt-work, in the bailiwic of Harz∣burg, so called from Duke Julius, under whom, in 1569, the spring was discovered, and the works erected. It belongs in common to the elector and duke of Brunswic. In the same bailiwic are founde∣ries and mine-works, particularly of brass-wire, and lapis caliminaris, a copper flatting-mill, a mine-of∣fice, a paper-mill, and a quarry of beautiful marble.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The DISTRICT of WESER.</HEAD>
<P>In this district, lying between the Weser and the Leine, the most remarkable places are,</P>
<P>Holzmunden, a small open town on the Weser at the mouth of the river Holts, whence it has its name. Here are iron and steel works, and here a toll is paid by vessels passing on the Weser.</P>
<P>Stadt-Oldendorf, a little walled town, which consists of about two hundred houses, and is the seat of a superintendency.</P>
<P>Amelunxborn, a Lutheran convent, in a little wood betwixt Wickensen and Bevern, which was originally founded about the year 1120 for Cister∣cian monks.</P>
<P>Escherhausen, a market-town, seated on a hill near the side of the Lenne.</P>
<P>Greene, a large village on the Leine, which is the seat of a bailiwic and superintendency. In the bailiwic is an iron-foundery, and a looking-glass manufactory.</P>
<P>Bevern, a market-town on the little river Be∣ver. Here duke Ferdinand Albert fixed his residence, and became the founder of the Bevern line, of which the present ducal family is de∣scended.</P>
<P>Turstenberg, an old castle, standing on a rock fortified with a strong wall and two draw-bridges, and commanding a beautiful prospect. Here is a manufacture of fine porcelain.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="2700"/>
Otterstein, a market-town, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
</DIV4>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of HALBERSTADT, with its incorporated Counties and Lordships.</HEAD>
<P>This small principality is bounded on the north-east by the duchy of Magdeburg; on the south by the principality of Anhalt; on the west by the diocese of Hildesheim; on the east by part of the electorate of Saxony; and on the north by Bruns∣wic-Wolfenbuttel. It is near forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. The bailiwic of Werfer∣lingen lies separate on the Aller. The soil is very fertile both in corn, grass, and flax, interspersed with some woods; notwithstanding, in general, there is a scarcity of fuel, as well as of fish and game. The chief river in it is the Bode. The prin∣cipality is, for the most part, level, and feeds abun∣dance of sheep. There are three large towns in it, which send representatives to the diet, toge∣ther with ten small ones, and ninety-nine country towns and villages. The number of the inhabi∣tants are reckoned at about two hundred thousand. The states consist of the prelates, that is, the chapters and convents; the nobility, who are pos∣sessed of manors; and the magistrates of Halber∣stadt, Aschersleben, and Osterwick. The diets are usually held four times a year. The greatest part of the inhabitants are Lutherans, with a mixture of Roman catholics, Calvinists, and Jews. The manufactures are principally woollen, and the chief exports are grain, and the beer called broihan. Till the treaty of Westphalia in 1648, this country was a diocese, but was then trans∣ferred to the electoral house of Brandenburg, as a temporal principality. It is entitled to a vote both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle.
<PB N="266" REF="2710"/>
Its matricular assessment is fourteen horse and sixty∣six foot, or four hundred and thirty-two florins monthly, in lieu of them, exclusive of that for the county of Regenstein, and the lordships of Lora and Klettenberg. To the chamber of Wetzlar it con∣tributes each term one hundred and sixty-two rix∣dollars, twenty-four kruitzers. The family of Rosz∣ing are hereditary marshals, and the Schenks, of Flechtingen, cup-bearers. The annual revenue arising from this principality, and the incorporated counties and lordships, is said to amount to five hundred thousand rix-dollars. We shall here give an account of the principal places in five of the six circles into which the principality is divided. The other, viz. that of Hohenstein, shall be de∣scribed at the end of the Upper Saxony circle, in which it lies. The Halberstadt circle contains</P>
<P>Halberstadt, which gives name to it, and is its capital, standing on the Holz-Emme, twenty five miles south-west of Magdeburg, and twenty-eight south-east of Brunswic. It was formerly an im∣perial city, and is now the seat of the regency and the high courts and offices. It was long the see of a bishopric, founded in the beginning of the ninth century by Lewis I. son of Charlemagne. The bishops were mostly of the Brunswic family, and more eminent for their military than episcopal talents. Though the number of the inhabitants is not quite two thousand, there are within and with∣out the town sixteen churches. Most of the houses are old fashioned. The principal public edifices are the cathedral of St. Peter's, an old but stately structure, two old episcopal palaces, a great many Lutheran and Calvinist churches, several Roman catholic convents, a Jewish synagogue, three Lu∣theran Latin schools, several hospitals, besides an orphan-house and prison. The chapter of the cathedral consists of a provost, a dean, a senior
<PB N="267" REF="2720"/>
and several sub-seniors, with sixteen canons, of whom four are Roman catholics, and the rest Lutherans. Besides these, there are eight minor canons and twenty-two elects. On the Burg-square are hand∣some houses for the canons and prebendaries, with a nunnery. Several of the Lutheran churches are collegiate. The convents have a jurisdiction within their respective liberties. In 1758, this town was very severely treated by the French, who demolished its walls and gates. The chapter of the cathedral is distinguished by a cross of gold, enamelled with white, and divided into eight points, which is fastened to a deep scarlet ribbon bordered with black.</P>
<P>Gruningen, or Groningen, a small town, where is a stately palace and chapel, erected by bishop Henry Julius, and where was anciently a convent of monks. This town gives name to a bailiwic, in which are the small towns of Kroppenstedt, Rochstedt, Wegeleben, Schwanebeck, and a Cis∣tercian nunnery.</P>
<P>Oschersleben, a small town lying on the Bode, which gives name to a bailiwic, in which is Had∣mersleben, a Benedictine nunnery, and Hamer∣sleben, a convent of Augustine monks. The meadows and pastures are so luxuriant here, that it may justly be stiled the hay-magazine of the whole principality.</P>
<P>Weferlingen, a market-town on the Aller, in the bailiwic of Weferling, in which is also Wal∣beck, a Lutheran abbey.</P>
<P>Aschersleben, situated on the Eine, and the second town in rank in the whole principality. It gives name to the second circle of the principality, and formerly to a county, of which it was the ca∣pital. Belonging to it are three churches, of which one is common both to the Lutherans and Calvinists.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="2730"/>
Ermsleben, a small town which gives name to the third circle, and also to a bailiwic, stands on the Selke.</P>
<P>Reinstein, formerly a strong castle not far from Blankenburg, which, though now razed, gives name to a county and circle, containing Wester∣hausen, a small town, and the seat of a bailiwic; and Derenburg, a small town, which gives name to a lordship, and stands on the Holz-Emme.</P>
<P>Osterwick on the Ilse, is the third town of the principality, having several woollen manufactures, and giving name to the fifth circle.</P>
<P>Horenburg, a small town on the Ilse, which gives name to a bailiwic. In its neighbourhood hops are much cultivated.</P>
<P>Zilly, a small town, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Dardessen, a little walled town on a hill; whence there is a large striking prospect of the Harz forest.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DUCHIES of SCHWERIN and GUSTRO, or the DUCHY of MECKLENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>These duchies are bounded by Pomerania on the east; by part of the marquisate of Brandenburg, and the duchy of Lunenburg, on the south; the Baltic on the North; and Holstein, and Saxe-Lawenburg, on the West. Their greatest length is about a hundred and twenty miles, and greatest breadth upwards of sixty. With respect to the soil, much cannot be said in favour of it, as it consists in general, either of sand, or large and desolate heaths, interspersed with moors, woods, fens, and lakes. It yields very little wheat, and not a great deal of oats, rye, and barley; but breeds a considerable number of sheep and cattle, has plenty of fish, with stone∣quarries,
<PB N="269" REF="2740"/>
salt-springs, alum, iron, and some copper. The principal rivers here are the Elde and Stor, which fall into the Elbe, as it glides along the borders of this country to the south-west; the Rec∣kenitz, which discharges itself into the Baltic; as do the Peene, the Warno, and the Stopenitz. This coun∣try has only one harbour on the Baltic, namely that of Rostock. In both duchies, exclusive of Rostock, are forty-five great and small cities, with three convents, and a great number of manors and farms, belonging either to the duke, the nobility, or convents. The peasants are in a state of vil∣lainage; but the nobility-enjoy very considerable privileges. The states are composed of the no∣bility and towns, and the diets, which are sum∣moned annually, are held alternately at Sternberg, and Malehin. The duchy of Schwerin appoints four provincial counsellors, and that of Gustro, as many, who rank, according to seniority, with the duke's actual privy-counsellors, as their marshals do with the colonels. The lesser committee represents the whole body of the nobility and commons, by whom the members are chosen freely, and with∣out controul, and no edict relative to the whole country can be published without their consent, or in prejudice of their rights. The inhabitants of this country are mostly Lutherans, under their superintendants. There are also some Calvinists and Roman catholics. Besides the grammar-schools in the towns, there is an university at Rostock. The commodities of the duchy are corn, flax, hemp, hops, wax, honey, cattle, butter, cheese, wool, and wood, a part of which is exported, but hardly any manufactures.</P>
<P>Of the house of Mecklenburg, there are two lines still subsisting, viz. that of Schwerin and Strelitz. The latter commenced in duke Adolphus
<PB N="270" REF="2750"/>
Frederick II. younger brother of the duke of Schwerin, and grand-father of the present duke of Strelitz, Adolphus Frederick IV. who entered on the government in 1752, and whose family hath lately received a great additional lustre by his Britannic majesty's taking his second sister for his consort, and by her own great merit and noble deportment in that high station. Besides the duchy of Strelitz, to this duke belong the prin∣cipality of Ratzeburg, with the lordship of Stargard, the antient commanderies of Miro, and Nemero, and a yearly pension of nine thousand dollars out of the Boitzenburgh toll. The title assumed by both the dukes is duke of Mecklen∣burg, prince of Wenden, Schwerin, and Ratze∣burg, count of Schwerin, and the country of Rostock, and lord of Stargard. By the agree∣ment concluded at Wittstock in 1442, the elector of Brandenburg, on the extinction of the male-line of the dukes of Mecklenburg, is intitled to their whole succession. The duke of Schwerin has two votes both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle. The matricular assessment for the duchies of Schwerin and Gustro is forty horse and sixty-seven foot, or seven hundred and forty-eight florins monthly, including what is paid by Swe∣den for Wismar, and the bailiwics of Poll and Neukloster. To the chamber of Wetzlar these two duchies pay each two hundred and forty-three rix-dollars, forty-three kruitzers. For the govern∣ment of Mecklenburg, the administration of jus∣tice, and the management of the revenue, there is the privy-council of regency, the demesne cham∣ber, the high and provincial court of justice, to which appeals lie in most cases, both from the consistory and the inferior civil courts, and which are common to both the dukes. As to the reve∣nues, those of the Schwerin line must be very con∣siderable,
<PB N="271" REF="2760"/>
those arising from the demesne bailiwics and regalia alone, amounting to three hundred thousand rix-dollars per annum. There is a tax on land that produces no contemptible sum, and that called the princess's tax is fixed at twenty thousand rix-dollars: besides all these, there are also free gifts. The whole revenues of the Strelitz branch are esti∣mated at an hundred and twenty-six thousand rix-dol∣lars. Each of these princes maintains a body of troops. Their principalities are divided into three circles, of which that of Mecklenburg is the first, and contains the following places:</P>
<P>Parchim, situated in the principality of Wenden, on the river Elde, which divides it into the old and new town. Here was once a castle and a mint. It has now two churches.</P>
<P>Schwerin, which is the usual residence of that branch of the ducal family to which it gives name, stands on a great lake of that name; eighteen miles south of Wismar, thirty south-east of Lubeck, and thirty-eight south-west of Rostock. It was an∣ciently the see of a bishop; but was secularized at the treaty of Osnaburg, and given to the duke of Mecklenburg as an equivalent for Wismar. The duke's palace here stands on an island in the lake, but has a communication with the town by means of a bridge: it contains a valuable collec∣tion of paintings, has fine gardens, and commands a delightful prospect. The town and county, to which it gives name, had long counts, or graves, of their own.</P>
<P>Gadebusch, a small town with a castle. Rede∣gast, the idol of the Wends, is said to have been worshipped here in a wood; and that from thence the town had the name of Gadebusch or Gedsbush. In 1712 the Swedes defeated the Danes near this place.</P>

<P>Rostock, the largest town in both duchies, lying on the river Warno, at the mouth of which, eight miles below, it has a harbour, named Warne∣munde. It is divided into three parts, the old,
<PB N="275" REF="2800"/>
the middle, and new towns. Here are a great many churches. In St. Mary's, a stately structure, are preserved the entrails of the celebrated Grotius, who died in 1645. At that of the Holy-cross, is a convent for young ladies, natives of Rostock. The university here, which was founded in 1419, has, for these two last centuries, been one of the most flourishing in Germany. Its professors are nominated and paid, partly by the dukes, and partly by the town. Here is also a free-grammar∣school. The town has great privileges, among others, that of coining copper, silver and gold, yet the dukes are sovereigns of it. Its magistracy are possessed of the civil and criminal jurisdiction, but an appeal lies from them to the two supreme courts of judicature, as well as from the consistory.</P>
<P>The dukes have a palace here, which was for∣merly the residence of the abbot of Dobberan. Rostock carries on a large trade, especially in beer, formerly called Lubeck beer, of which they ex∣port great quantities. The river is navigable for small vessels up to the town, but large ships come no further than Warnemunde. There are seven bridges here over the river. This town had once lords of its own, and was also formerly one of the Hanse, and a free imperial city; and has now a large territory and estate belonging to it. Near the mouth of the river the Swedes had a fort, where they levied a toll, which, when the trade of this city was in a more flourishing state, amounted yearly to upwards of eighty thousand rix-dollars; but now produces only six thousand, whence it ap∣pears how much the trade of the town is declined. This toll and fort, in 1740, were mortgaged to the duke of Mecklenburg.</P>
<P>Dobbertin, a Lutheran convent for ladies, in the principality of Wenden, not far from Gold∣berg, was antiently a monastery of Bene∣dictine

<P>Stargard, or Old Stargard, a small town, which gives name to the lordship and circle, and near which is a ducal palace.</P>
<P>Strelitz, a town situated in a marshy neighbour∣hood, and giving title to a branch of the ducal family, to whom it, and all the rest of this circle, belongs. It consists of Old and New Strelitz, which stand at a small distance from each other. The prince's palace is at the latter of these, which, as it has not been long built, makes a handsome appearance, and has pleasant gardens.</P>
<P>Furstenberg, a small town, which antiently had counts of its own.</P>
<P>Wesenberg, a small town, having a fertile spot for its territory, called Pomel.</P>
<P>Nemero, antiently a commandery of the order of St. John, but now a bailiwic belonging to the Strelitz branch, who are also proprietors of the town and bailiwic of Miro, formed, like the former, out of a commandery of the order of St. John. At Miro is a ducal seat.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="2820"/>
The following places, formerly belonging to the Duchy of SCHWERIN, were, at the peace of Westphalia, ceded to Sweden, viz.</P>
<P>Wismar, a large town betwixt Rostock and Lubeck, twenty-five miles west of the former, and east of the latter, and seventy-three north east of Hamburgh. It was formerly one of the chief Hanse towns, and the harbour for their men of war; for it stands on a bay of the Baltic, still enjoys a middling trade, and is the seat of a Swedish court of justice, both for the district and Swedish Anterior Pomerania. It is supposed to have been built in the thirteenth century, out of the ruins of Mecklenberg. In 1648, it was given to the Swedes by the treaty of Munster. For∣merly it had the same privileges as Lubec, par∣ticularly that of coining. By the treaty made in 1720, when it was restored to the Swedes, its walls and fortifications were entirely demolished. Here, in 1758, the Prussians raised large contri∣butions. The town has six churches, and a grammar-school under the direction of eight masters, and its territory is considerable. Besides this town and its territories, the two adjoining bailiwics of Poel and Neukloster, were also ceded to the crown of Sweden by the same treaty.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of HOLSTEIN, including the lordship of PINNEBERG, and the town of ALTENA.</HEAD>
<P>The boundaries of this duchy are the Ger∣man ocean on the west; the Baltic, or the gulph of Lubeck, on the east; the duchy of Mecklenberg on the south-east; that of Bre∣men, with the river Elbe, on the south west; and Lauenburg, with the territory of Ham∣burg,
<PB N="278" REF="2830"/>
on the south. Its greatest length is about eighty miles, and its breadth sixty. The diocese of Eutin, and the county of Ranzau, though they make a part of the duchy of Holstein, yet being lands belonging to the empire and circle, shall be described separately.</P>
<P>A great part of this country consists of rich marsh-land, which being much exposed to inun∣dations both from the sea and rivers, dykes have been raised at a great expence, to guard and defend them. The pastures in the marshes are so rich, that cattle are bred in great numbers, and fattened in them; and great quantities of excellent butter and cheese made of their milk. They are also very fruitful in wheat, barley, pease, beans, and rape-seed. In the more barren, sandy, and heathy parts of the country, large flocks of sheep are bred and fed; nor are orchards wanting, or woods, especially of oak and beech; nor turf, poultry, game, and wild fowl. Here is a variety both of sea and river fish; and the beef, veal, mutton, and lamb, are very fat and palatable. Holstein is also noted for beautiful horses. The gentry usually farm the cows upon their estates to a Hollander, as he is called, who for every cow pays from six to ten rix-dollars; the owner providing pasture for them in summer, and straw and hay in winter. It is no uncommon thing here, to drain the ponds and lakes once in three or four years, and sell the carp, lampreys, pikes and perch found in them; then sow them for several years after with oats, or use them for pasture, and after that to lay them under water again, and breed fish in them. There are hardly any hills in the country, but several rivers, of which the principal are the Eyder, the Stor, and the Trave. The duchy contains about thirty towns great and small: most part of the peasants are under villenage, being
<PB N="279" REF="2840"/>
obliged to work daily for their lords, and not even at liberty to quit their estates. The nobility and the proprietors of manors are possessed of the civil and criminal jurisdiction, with other privileges and exemptions. Formerly there were diets, but now they seem to be entirely laid aside: meetings, how∣ever, of the nobility are still held at Kiel. The pre∣dominant religion here is Lutheranism, with super∣intendencies, as in other Lutheran countries. In several places the Jews are allowed the exercise of their religion. At Gluckstadt, and Altena, are both Calvinist and Popish churches; and at Kiel, a Greek Russian chapel. Besides the Latin schools in the towns, at Altena is a gymnasium, and at Kiel an university. Notwithstanding this country's advantageous situation for commerce, there are few manufactures and little trade in it. Hamburg and Lubec supply the inhabitants with what they want from abroad; from whence and Altena, they export some grain, malt, grots, starch, buck∣wheat, pease, beans, rapeseed, butter, cheese, sheep, swine, horned cattle, horses, and fish. The manufactures of the duchy are chiefly carried on at Altena, Kiel, and Gluckstadt. The duchy of Holstein consists of the antient provinces of Holstein, Stormar, Ditmarsh, and Wagria. It belongs partly to the king of Denmark, and partly to the dukes of Holstein Gottorf, and Ploen. Antiently the counts of Holstein were vassals of the dukes of Saxony; but afterwards they received the investiture of their territories from the emperor, or the bishops of Lubec, in the emperor's name, though now the investi∣ture is given by the emperor in person. The king of Denmark appoints a regency over his part of Holstein and the duchy of Sleswick, which has its office at Gluckstadt. The seat of the great duke's privy-council, and regency-court, together
<PB N="280" REF="2850"/>
with the chief consistory, which is united to it, is at Kiel; there are many inferior courts and consistories from which an appeal lies to the higher. In the duchy of Holstein, the government of the con∣vents and nobility is alternately in the king and duke, for a year, from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. The person in whom the government is lodged, administers it by his regency. In some cases an appeal lies from this court to the Aulic council, or chamber at Wetzlar: the convents, the nobility, and the proprietors of manors in the country, have a civil and criminal jurisdiction over their estates. The revenues of the sovereigns arise principally from their demesnes and regalia; besides which there is a land, and several other taxes and imposts. The duke's income, setting aside his ducal patri∣mony, has been estimated at seventy or eighty thousand pounds. The king usually keeps here some regiments of foot and one of horse. With respect to the duke's military force, it amounts to about eight hundred men. The king, on account of his share in this country, stiles himself duke of Holstein, Stormar, and Ditmarsh. The dukes, both of the royal and princely house, stile them∣selves heirs of Norway, dukes of Sleswick, Hol∣stein, Stormar, and Ditmarsh, and counts of Olden∣burg and Delmenhorst. On account of Holstein, both the king of Denmark and the grand duke have a seat and voice in the college of the princes of the empire, and in that of the circle. Toge∣ther with Mecklenburg they also nominate an as∣sessor for this circle in the Aulic chamber. The matricular assessment of the whole duchy is forty horse and eighty foot, or eight hundred florins; To the chamber of Wetzlar both princes pay a hundred and eighty-nine rix-dollars, thirty-one kruitzers. In 1735, duke Charles Frederic, of Holstein Gottorf, founded an order of knighthood
<PB N="281" REF="2860"/>
here, viz. that of St. Anne, the ensign of which is a red cross, enamelled, and worn pendant at a red ribbon, edged with yellow. The principal places in that part of the duchy belonging to the king of Denmark and the duke of Ploen, are,</P>
<P>Gluckstadt, on the north-side of the Elbe in Stor∣mar, twenty-six miles south-west of Hamburg, is a neat well built town, and so strong, that it may be said to be impregnable, unless blocked up by a fleet. It held out near two years against the emperor Ferdinand II. The Danes have generally two thousand men in garrison in it, and some men of war in the harbour; which is so spacious, that it could receive a royal navy. The Calvinists have a church here, the Roman Catholics a chapel, and the Jews a synagogue. The town was built in 1620, when Christian IV. ordered it to be called Gluck∣stadt, i. e. the Fortunate-town. The neighbour∣ing country is so marshy, that it could not be passed most part of the year without the causeway, which lies betwixt Gluckstadt and Krempe. It is also much exposed to inundations. A toll is levied here on the Elbe. There being no springs about the town, the inhabitants use rain water, or that of the river. Those that are convicted of theft are condemned for life to draw the dust-carts, to which they are chained, like galley-slaves. This town is the seat of the regency and other high colleges. In 1738 a board of trade was established in it by Christian VI. and its privileges are very considerable.</P>

<P>Wilster, a small town on a river of the same name, in Holstein, six miles from Gluckstadt.</P>
<P>Itzehoe, a small town on the river Stor, which is navigable from hence to the Elbe seven miles below it. The country from hence to Hamburg, for upwards of thirty miles, is very pleasant and
<PB N="282" REF="2870"/>
fertile, being diversified in summer with fields of wheat, barley, oats, flax, millet, peas, cinque foil, intermixed with herds of fine cattle grazing in the rich pastures and meadows. The town is divided into the old and new, the latter of which is well∣built. There is a Lutheran nunnery here for ladies of quality, but without the vows or other usages of popish convents. It consists of an ab∣bess, and nineteen other ladies, who live separate in the town, either in houses of their own, or hired ones. The convent has the advowson of several churches, and jurisdiction over its members, vas∣sals, and tenants. Here is also a commercial col∣lege. By a privilege granted to this town, no ship can proceed higher up the river without the permission of the magistracy. In 1233 it had Lubec privileges bestowed upon it, which it still enjoys.</P>
<P>Rendsburg, a small, but strong and well built town on the borders of Sleswic, and the river Eyder. The town, which stands, in part, on an island in the river, owed its origin to the antient castle of Reynoldsburgh, erected by count Adol∣phus III. in 1200. It is strongly fortified, well garrisoned, and has Lubec privileges. Here are two parish churches, a Latin free-school, a royal armoury, and granary. On the Holstein gate are these words in Latin, <HI>Eydora Romani ter∣minus imperii.</HI> The principal trade of the inhabi∣tants is brewing of beer. They also sell a great deal of wood, which they cut in its forest. This town is the seat of a bailiwic, consistory, board of trade, and of the general superintendants.</P>
<P>Segeberg, a small town in Wagria, which took its name from a castle erected in 1137, and called, at first, Siegelberg, but afterwards Sigeberg. Without the town are a pyramid and obelisk, with inscrip∣tions,

<DIV4>
<HEAD>In the GREAT DUKE's part of HOLSTEIN the most considerable places are</HEAD>
<P>Kiel, in Latin Kilia, or Chilonium, the capital of Holstein. It stands on a bay of the Baltic, where it has a convenient harbour, thirty-six miles north-west of Lubec, and forty-eight north of Hamburg. Here is a ducal palace, and here the high colleges are held. In this town also is an university, founded in 1665 by duke Christian Albert. Both the town and harbour are defended by a castle on a neighbouring hill. It is a wealthy populous place, has a good trade, an annual fair much frequented, with Lubec privileges, and was antiently one of the Hanse towns. It is di∣vided into the Old and New Towns, of which the latter is the largest and pleasantest, being planted with rows of trees. The bay on which it stands is supposed to be the Sinus Chalusus, and the river Swentin the Fluvius Chalusus of Ptolemy. During the fair here, Hamburg looks like a desart.</P>
<P>Oldenburgh, or Altenburg, now a small town, situated in Wragia, but formerly considerable. It stands near the Baltic, twenty-seven miles north of Lubec, and gives name to a small county. Antiently the kings, or chiefs of the Sclavonians, kept their court in this place; which had also for∣merly a great trade, and was, for some time, the see of a bishop. In 1235 Lubec privileges were conferred on it.</P>

<P>Weslingbuhren, a pretty market-town in the North Ditmarsh.</P>
<P>Heyde, a large, but poor town in the same district.</P>
<P>Preetz, a small town in Holstein Proper, near which is a Lutheran nunnery, consisting of forty ladies, under the direction of a prioress and pro∣vost. The convent has its own church and pastor. It is to be observed here, that these convents are held in common of the king and dukes, and are appropriated to the nobility of Holstein and Sles∣wic. They appoint their own officers, and have a jurisdiction over their tenants and vassals. To the sovereigns they, and the proprietors of ma∣nors, pay three rix-dollars per mensem for every plug of land; one half of which goes to the king, and the other to the dukes.</P>
<P>Utersen, a market-town in the lordship of Pin∣neberg, near which is a Lutheran convent, con∣sisting of a prioress and fifteen ladies, with a pro∣vost.</P>

<P>Wedel, a market-town in the above county.</P>
<P>Altena, a large town on the Elbe, not above a cannon shot from Hamburg. It contains two Lu∣theran, three Calvinist, one Roman Catholic, and two Baptist churches, besides many meeting∣houses, and a Jewish synagogue. The number of the inhabitants is computed at thirty thousand. The Jews pay two thousand ducats per annum, as protection-money. Here is a grammar-school and gymnasium, a house of correction, a work∣house, an orphan-house, an anatomical theatre, a dock for the building of ships, a variety of manu∣factures, and a very considerable trade. The walk, called the Mall, is very agreeable, being planted with four rows of trees. The more than savage barbarity of Steinbock, the Swedish general, in burning this town in the year 1712, is well known. The Danes would fain have fortified it long ago; but the Hamburgers would not permit it, one of the emperors having granted them this privilege, that no fort should be built without their consent within two German miles of Hamburg.</P>

<HEAD>DIOCESE of HILDESHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>This diocese lies between the rivers Leine and Ocker; and is bounded by Halberstadt on the north-west, Lunenburg-Zell on the north, Gru∣benhagen on the south, and elsewhere by the dominions of the duke of Brunswic. The baili∣wick of Hundesruck lies separate from it, being inclosed by the principalities of Calenberg and Gru∣benhagen.
<PB N="287" REF="2920"/>
Hildesheim, in length, is about forty miles, and in breadth thirty. The soil is abundant∣ly fertile in grain, flax, hops, pulse, woods of oak, beech, ash, and birch. In some places there are salt∣works with stone quarries, and iron ore; but of horses, black cattle, sheep, and hogs, there is no great plenty. Besides the above-mentioned rivers, it is al∣so watered by the Innerste, the Ecker, and the Fuse. In the diocese are eight boroughs, four market-towns, two hundred and forty-eight villages, and se∣venty-five manors, which entitle to a seat in the diets. The states consist of the clergy, i. e. the cathedral chapter and abbies, the nobility, and the towns of Hildesheim, Peina, Elze, and Alfeld. The diets are convened by the bishop alone, and held generally once a year at Hildesheim. The greatest part of the inhabitants of this diocese, which was founded by Charlemagne, and is still subject to a popish bishop, are Lutheran, who are intitled, by the treaty of Westphalia, to the free ex∣ercise of their religion. Of the Lutheran religion are all the towns, with the greatest part of the nobility, and most of the villages, under five super∣intendants, and two consistories. The manufac∣tures of this country are ordinary cloth, fine linen, worsted stockings, a coarse porcelain, and all kinds of iron ware, of which, and its natural products, a part is exported. The bishopric was founded by the emperor Charlemagne, and was antient∣ly of great extent; but the dukes of Brunswic afterwards got possession of a part of it. The bishop has a seat and vote, both in the diets of the empire, and the circle. The matricular assess∣ment of the bishopric is eighteen horse, and eighty foot, or five hundred and thirty-six florins; but of this, and the seventy-two rix-dollars, thirty-eight kruitzers, paid to the chamber of Witzlar, a part is advanced by the elector and duke of Brunswic. The chapter, which elects the bishop, and during
<PB N="288" REF="2930"/>
the vacancy of the see has the administration, con∣sists of forty-two members, whose revenues are very considerable. Here, as in most other German states, are several hereditary officers, as marshals, cup-bearers, treasurers, &amp;c. There is also a re∣gency, and two high courts of justice, to which ap∣peals lie from the inferior courts, and from them to the aulic council. The episcopal revenues arise partly from the demesnes and regalia, and partly from several taxes, and sums granted by the diets. The whole military force consists of a company of foot, and a few troopers. The principal places in the diocese are</P>
<P>Hildesheim, which stands on the Innerste, gives name to the diocese, and is its capital. It is fifteen miles from Hanover, and twenty-two from Bruns∣wic; is pretty large, but old-fashioned, and irre∣gular. The magistracy, and greatest part of the burghers, are Lutherans. The principal public buildings here are, the cathedral, (in which is fine paintings, and the old Saxon idol Irmensul) several monasteries and nunneries, a great many churches, (some belonging to the Lutherans, some to the Papists) the chancery, the nobility's hall, where the diets are held, the Jesuit's college, a Jewish synagogue, the Gymnasium Andrianum, and La∣tin school of St. Lambert. The magistrates are possessed of the civil and criminal jurisdiction, im∣pose and collect duties, and apply them to the pub∣lic uses, issue ordinances, &amp;c. The town was an∣tiently one of the Hanse, and the capital of Henry the Lion. It is under the protection of the house of Brunswick-Luneburg, which keeps a company of foot in the town, who are maintained by the corporation. The citizens acknowledge the supe∣riority of the bishop; but never suffer him not to make any incroachments on their rights and privi∣leges. In the neighbourhood are two rich abbies.</P>

<HEAD>DUCHY of SAXE-LAUENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is the farthest province to the north∣east of the king of Great-Britain's German domi∣nions. It lies on the north and south banks of the Elbe, between Holstein on the west and north, Mecklenburg on the east, and Lunenburg on the south. This country is not very fertile in grain; but in some places yields plenty of flax, in others fine woods, and in many parts, particularly on the banks of the Elbe, good pasturage, where likewise abun∣dance of cows are kept, which are let out at five or six rix-dollars per annum each, as in Holstein. There are some lakes here, and small rivers, be∣sides the Elbe, which abound in fish. In the whole duchy, which is from eight to twenty-six miles broad, and about eighty in length, are three bo∣roughs, one market-town, and about thirty-six thousand souls. The states are composed of the nobility and towns. The manors entitling to a seat and vote in the diets, are twenty-three. Both the nobility and commons derive their privileges from the Lauenburg act of 1702, which king George I. and his successor, were graciously pleased to con∣firm in all its articles. The inhabitants are all Lutherans, under the inspection of a superinten∣dant, who is appointed by the king, and visits the several parishes once a-year. There is no place of any note without a Latin school for the instruction
<PB N="291" REF="2960"/>
of youth. Considerable quantities of rye, butter, cheese, wool, timber, and wood for fuel, with some fish, are exported from hence, but very few manufactures. Julius Francis, duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, dying in 1689, without male-issue, in consequence of an agreement concluded with the house of Brunswic-Luneburg in 1369, George William, duke of Zell, took possession of the duchy, and in 1697, accommodated matters with the elector of Saxony, who claimed it, by virtue of a reversion granted to his ancestors by the emperor Maximilian I. After the death of the duke of Zell, it devolved to his son-in-law, and nephew, king George I. of Great-Britain, to whom the late emperor Charles VI. granted the investi∣ture of it, with a seat and vote in the diet of the empire, and circle. Its matricular assessment is eight horse and thirty foot, or two hundred and sixteen florins monthly in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes two hundred and forty-three rix-dollars, forty-three kruitzers. For the government of the duchy, and the admi∣nistration of justice, there is a regency, subordinate that of Hanover, and a high tribunal, the mem∣bers of which are appointed partly by the king, and partly by the states; but an appeal lies from it to the high court of appeals at Zell. The duchy has also a consistory of its own. All these colleges meet at Ratzeburg. As to inferior courts, the nobility, the towns, and bailiwics, are posses∣sed of the high and low jurisdiction, within their respective liberties. The revenues arise from the demesnes, regalia, contributions, and several taxes, out of which the sovereign pays the taxes to the empire and circle, and also defrays all the public expences of the country. The principal places in the duchy are,</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="2970"/>
Ratzeburg, twelve miles south of Lubec, and sixteen north of Lauenburg, situated on an island in a lake of the same name, from which a river issues, that is navigable for boats to Lubec. It was formerly the see of a bishop, under the arch∣bishop of Bremen. At the treaty of Westphalia, the duke of Mecklenburg got the bishopric, ex∣cept the town and castle of Ratzeburg, which was given to the duke of Lauenburg, and is now the seat of the regency, the chief court of justice, and the consistory, and has a garrison quartered in barracks. The principality of Ratzeburg, with a part of the town, belongs to the duke of Meck∣lenburg-Strelitz. There is a fine bridge on the lake, which the inhabitants are obliged to keep in repair, and a pleasant walk, planted with limes and ashes by the side of the lake. The town is reckoned very strong. The cathedral is on the north-side, and the Prince's-castle on the south.</P>
<P>Lauenburg, a small town on a hill near the Elbe, by which it has a considerable trade, espe∣cially in corn and wood. Goods also brought up the Elbe are conveyed from hence down the Steek∣enitz to Lubec. Here is a toll on the Elbe. Of the ducal palace, that formerly stood in this place, only one wing now remains. Lauenburg lies four∣teen miles north of Lunenburg, twenty-five south of Lubec, and thirty-five east of Hamburg.</P>
<P>Mollen, a small town, sixteen miles from Lu∣bec, and twenty-four from Lunenburg, almost surrounded by lakes.</P>
<P>Grunau, a market-town in the bailiwic of Ratzeburg.</P>
<P>Buchen, a village in the bailiwic of Lauenburg, in which the diets are held.</P>
<P>Schwarzenbeck, a village which gives name to a bailiwic, containing also Sacksenwald, a large fo∣rest, on which are one paper and two copper-mills.</P>

<HEAD>COUNTY of HADELN.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is only about eight miles in length, and near as many in breadth, lies along the Elbe, and borders on the duchy of Bremen, and the territory of Hamburg. On the extinction of the dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg, it was sequestra∣ted till the year 1731, when it was ceded to the elector of Brunswic. It is very fertile; abounds in grain, fruit, cattle, and fish; and has its particular courts, ecclesiastical and civil, of which the grese, appointed by the sovereign, is president, and from which appeals lie to the Lauenburg high court of judicature at Ratzeburg. The in∣habitants are all Lutherans, under two superin∣tendants, and a consistory. The revenues of the whole county, arising from the contribution and land-tax, amounts to about ten thousand rix-dol∣lars. The only place in it deserving of notice is Otterndorf, a small town, seated on the Meden.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>ARCHBISHOPRIC of LUBEC.</HEAD>
<P>This archbishopric, which lies in that part of the duchy of Holstein called Wagria, was first erected at Oldenburg by the emperor Otho I. but having been afterwards divided into three bishoprics, viz. those of Oldenburg, Ratzeburg, and Mecklen∣burg, the see of the first was removed to Lubec. At the Reformation the bishop, chapter, and dio∣cese, embraced Lutheranism; and at the peace of Westphalia in 1648, the see was confirmed to the protestants. The bishops almost ever fince the Reformation, have been descendants of the house of Holstein-Gottorf; from whence likewise sprung Henry-Frederic-Augustus, the present bi∣shop, who is also brother to the king of Sweden; but
<PB N="294" REF="2990"/>
in 1756, the chapter made choice of Frederic, son to Frederic the late king of Denmark, and half-brother of the present king, for his coadjutor. The bishop of Lubec is a prince of the empire, and has a seat and vote as such, in the diets of the empire and circle. His matricular assessment is three horse, or thirty-six florins; and to the chamber of Wetz∣lar he contributes forty rix-dollars, fifty-two kruitzers. The cathedral stands in the imperial city of Lubec, and the chapter consists of thirty persons, all Lutherans, except four. The dean is always elected from among the members of the chapter. The provost of the cathedral is chosen alternately by the chapter and the city of Lubec. In the lands belonging to the bishop and chapter, the only place worth mentioning is</P>
<P>Eutin, where the bishop resides, and which is also the seat of the regency, treasury, and con∣sistory. It is a small town, very pleasantly situated on a lake, which abounds with fish. The bishop's palace and gardens are very handsome and agree∣able.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of SCHWERIN.</HEAD>
<P>This country is surrounded by the duchy of Schwerin, and the lordships of Wismar and Ro∣stock. Its length is about twenty miles, and its breadth six. It was formerly a bishopric, the see of which was at Schwerin; but at the peace of Westphalia was secularized, and given to the dukes of Mecklenburg, of the Schwerin line, with a seat and voice on account thereof in the diets of the empire and circle. Its matricular assessment is six horse, and as many foot, or ninety-six florins monthly in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes eighty-one rix-dollars, four∣teen kruitzers. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="3000"/>
Butzo, a small town, where the bishops former∣ly resided, and in which some manufactures are now carried on.</P>
<P>Wahrien, an insignificant place, different from that of the same name in the duchy of Gustro.</P>
<P>The Schelffe, or Neustadt, another small town, tontiguous to Schwerin.</P>
<P>Rhun, a convent for ladies of noble birth, which also gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of RATZEBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which lies between the du∣chies of Saxe-Lauenburg and Schwerin, and the territory of the city of Lubec, and is about six miles in length and breadth, consists, as we observed in the description of Ratzeburg, of the antient bishopric of that name, which was secularized at the peace of Westphalia, and given to the duke of Mecklenburg Schwerin; but afterwards, by the convention of Hamburg in 1701, came to the Strelitz line, which, on account of it, has a seat and voice in diets of the empire and circle. Its matricular assessment is one horse and three foot, or twenty-four florins; and to the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes sixty-seven rix-dollars, fifty-four kruitzers. A part of the town of Ratzeburg belongs to the principality, and there the regency, treasury, and consistory are held. The only other place in it that merits notice is Sconberg, a small town, where was antiently an episcopal palace, and which now gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRICIPALITY of BLANKENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which is situated in the east part of the duchy of Brunswic, and includes in it part of the Harz, is about twenty miles in length,
<PB N="296" REF="3010"/>
but in general not above six in breadth. That part of it which lies in the Harz, abounds with woods, marble, and iron ore, but has little or no corn land; whereas the other part is fruitful in grain. It had for a long time counts of its own; on the extinction of whom, in 1599, it devolved to the dukes of Wolfenbuttel; and in 1731 fell to the reigning Bevern branch. In 1707 the em∣peror Joseph erected it into a principality; but the duke of Brunswic has not yet obtained a seat or voice in the diet of the empire on account of it. To a Roman month it pays only twelve florins. This principality, as to its government, is under the privy-council at Brunswic, but has a distinct court of justice and a consistory. The only places in it of any account are,</P>
<P>Blankenburg, a small town, which gives name to the principality, and has a ducal palace on an eminence without the town.</P>
<P>Hasseldfelde, a little place, situated in the Harz, where the duke has a hunting-seat.</P>
<P>Michaelstein, a Lutheran convent, about three miles from Blankenburg.</P>
<P>Baumanshole, a famous cave, in which is a vast variety of figures in dropstone.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>COUNTY of RANZAU.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which lies in the duchy of Hol∣stein, and is about ten miles in length, and six broad, is tolerably fertile. It was formerly called the bailiwic of Barmstedt; but after it had been sold to Christian Ranzau, stadtholder to the king of Denmark, it was erected into a county of the empire by the emperor Ferdinand III. In conse∣quence of a settlement made by count Ranzau, that it should devolve to the royal family of Den∣mark, upon the failure of male issue in his own,
<PB N="297" REF="3020"/>
the county now belongs to the king, who on ac∣count of it has a seat in the diets of the empire and circle. To the chamber of Wetzlar it pays twenty∣nine rix-dollars, seventy-six kruitzers, is governed by an administrator appointed by the king, and has a consistory and other courts, for the trial of causes civil and criminal. The revenues arising from it amount to about fourteen thousand rix∣dollors per annum. The places which merit de∣scription in it are,</P>
<P>Barmstedt, a market-town on the Aue.</P>
<P>Elmshorn, another market-town on the Aue, which being navigable for small vessels from hence to the Elbe, a little trade is carried on by it from hence. The head minister of the church here is superintendant of the whole county.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of LUBEC.</HEAD>
<P>This city stands at the conflux of several rivers, the largest of which is the Trave, twelve miles from the Baltic, where it has a fine harbour, and forty north-east of Hamburg. By the Steckenitz, another of those rivers, it has a communication with the Elbe, and consequently with the German ocean. The city lies on the side of a hill, with the Trave, increased by the Steckenitz on one side, and the Wackenitz on the other, and is strongly fortified with bastions, moats, walls, and ramparts; the last of which are planted with trees, and form an agreeable walk. Lubec being for∣merly the chief of the Hanse-towns, was very powerful, in consequence of the vast trade it carried on; but a great part of that trade is now trans∣ferred to Hamburg: however, it is still said to employ one hundred and fifty of its own ships, and has a great share of the Baltic trade. It is about two miles in length, and more than one in breadth. The houses are all of stone, but old fashioned.
<PB N="298" REF="3030"/>
Several of the streets have on each side rows of lime-trees, with canals in the middle, like those of Holland. The public structures consist of the antient cathedral of the bishopric of Lubec, and several other Lutheran churches; a nunnery for twenty two ladies, with an abbess and prioress; a poor-house, an alms-house, and house of cor∣rection; an orphan-house; an hospital dedicated to the Holy-Ghost; a house in which poor travellers are entertained three days, and then sent forward with a pass; but such as happen to be sick, are provided with all necessaries, till they recover or die; the city armoury; a grammar-school of seven classes; the Calvinist church, and the Popish chapel. The deputies of the Hanse-towns used to meet here formerly in the town-house. An alli∣ance still subsists between Lubec, Hamburg, and Bremen; and these cities, under the name of Hanse-towns, negotiate treaties with foreign powers. Here are divers manufactures, and the city's territory is about sixty miles in compass. In the diet of the empire Lubec is possessed of the third seat among the Rhenish imperial cities; and among those of the circle, has the first. In the matricula, its assessment is four hundred and eighty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays five hundred and fifty-seven rix-dollars and eighty-eight kruitzers. The city is a republic within it∣self, and both makes and executes laws in regard to civil and criminal matters, &amp;c. A father and son, or two brothers, cannot be in the regency at the same time. The famous league of the Hanse-towns was begun here in 1164. This city had its charter of privileges from the emperor Frederic II. Formerly it carried on wars, both offensive and defensive, for several years, not only against the dukes of Mecklenburg, but against the kings of Sweden and Denmark, particularly in 1428, when
<PB N="299" REF="3040"/>
it fitted out two hundred and fifty ships of force against Eric X. king of Denmark. There are about twenty churches in Lubec, with lofty steeples or spires. The Trave brings ships of burden into the very heart of the city; but the largest unload at Travemunde, i. e. the mouth of the Trave, eight or ten miles distant. Formerly it is said to have employed no less than six hundred ships. In the famous cellar here, it is said there is wine two hundred years old. The church of St. Mary's, a noble lofty pile, is supported by tall pillars, all of one stone each, and has a high spire, covered with gilt lead. The town's garrison consists of about seven or eight hundred men. The revenue of its Lutheran bishop, tho' he is a prince of the em∣pire, is said not to exceed three thousand pounds.</P>
<P>Among other places dependent on Lubec is Travemunde, mentioned above, a small town, with a fort, at the influx of the Trave into the Baltic. In the fort is commonly a garrison of three or four hundred men, commanded by a burgher of Lubec. The town was purchased by that city in the year 1320, of John III. count of Holstein. There is another small place, called Bergedorf, which, with its bailiwic, belongs in common to Hamburg and Lubec, being a con∣quest made by their joint forces from the duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of GOSZLAR.</HEAD>
<P>This city is surrounded with the territories of Hildesheim and Wolfenbuttel, and lies twenty-two miles south-east of Hildesheim, twenty-five south of Brunswic, and twenty-six west of Halberstadt, on the river Gose, which, at a little distance, falls into the Ocker. It enjoys the same privileges as other free imperial cities, besides an exemption
<PB N="300" REF="3050"/>
from tolls in most of the markets of the empire. The city stands in a valley, surrounded with mountains, in which are mines both of iron and silver, where most of the inhabitants are employed in digging, or in cleansing, smelting, tempering, and vending the metals and minerals; for they farm some of the mines from the elector of Hanover. Here are several Lutheran foun∣dations both for men and women, of which the former hold immediately of the empire; as also a considerable brewery of beer, of which, and other provisions, the miners in the Harz take off large quantities. Goszlar owes its foundation to the emperor Henry I. in the year 922. In the Koningshof, or king's court, several kings and emperors of Germany have kept their court, and held assemblies of the empire. This city, in the diet, is possessed of the seventh seat on the bench of the imperial cities of the circle of the Rhine; and among those of Lower Saxony has the second. Its matricular assessment is only sixty florins, and its quota to the chamber of Wetzlar is one hundred and eighty-four florins, seventy∣nine kruitzers. The protectorship of it belongs to the duke of Brunswic-Wolfenbuttel, to whom, on that account, the inhabitants pay an annual sum of money. No religion is tolerated here but the Lutheran. It was in this place that Barthold Schwartz, the Benedictine monk, is said to have found out the art of making gunpowder.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of MUHLHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>This city lies in Thuringia, on the river Unstrut, forty miles east of Cassel. Here are two Luthe∣ran churches, with a Roman catholic foundation of Augustine nuns. In 1332 and 1337, Mul∣hausen purchased of the emperor Lewis the office
<PB N="301" REF="3060"/>
of imperial judge within the city and its precinct. It is possessed of the ninth place on the Rhenish bench of imperial-cities in the diets of the empire, and of the third in those of Lower Saxony. Its matricular assessment is one hundred and sixty flo∣rins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes one hundred and thirty-five rix-dollars, twenty∣three kruitzers. This place is under the protection of the elector of Saxony, and has a considerable terri∣tory. Formerly it was one of the Hanse-towns, and still carries on a good trade by means of its river.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of NORDHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>This city stands on the Zorge, twenty-one miles south-east of Goszlar; and both magistracy and inhabitants are Lutherans. Formerly it was one of the Hanse-towns, and still carries on a good trade to the Upper Harz, distills great quantities of brandy, and is noted for curious works in mar∣ble and alabaster. In 1717 the elector of Bran∣denburg, in consideration of the sum of fifty thou∣sand rix-dollars, transferred to the city and its magistracy, all his rights and prerogatives in it. In the diet of the empire it has the tenth seat on the Rhenish bench of imperial cities, and the fourth among those of Lower Saxony. Its matri∣cular assessment is eighty florins, and to the cham∣ber of Wetzlar it pays ninety-four rix-dollars, sixty∣two kruitzers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of HAMBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which derives its name from the old German word Hamme, signifying a wood, and Burg, a castle, standing on the north-side of the Elbe, twenty-seven miles north-west of Lunen∣burg, thirty-seven south-west of Lubeck, fifty-five
<PB N="302" REF="3070"/>
north of Zell, sixty-five north-east of Bre∣men, seventy-two from the mouth of the Elbe, one hundred and fifty-five south-west of Copenha∣gen, one hundred and ninety-five north-east of Amsterdam, and four hundred and sixteen north-west of Vienna, on the borders of that part of Holstein called Stormar. The Elbe, which, op∣posite the city, is not less than four miles broad, not only forms two spacious harbours, but runs thro' most part of it, in canals. It flows above Hamburg many miles; but when the tide is accompanied with north-west winds, a great deal of damage is done by the inundations occasioned thereby. There are a great many bridges over the canals, which are mostly on a level with the streets, and some of them have houses on both sides. In the year 833, Ludovicus Pius erected Ham∣burg first into a bishopric, and afterwards into an archbishopric; and Adolphus III. duke of Saxony, among many other great privileges, granted it the right of fishing in the Elbe, eight miles above and below the city. The kings of Denmark, since they have succeeded to the counts of Holstein, have continually claimed the sovereignty of this place, and often compelled the citizens to pay large sums to purchase the confirmation of their li∣berties. Nay, it has more than once paid homage to the king of Denmark, who, notwith∣standing, keeps a minister here with credentials, which is a sort of acknowledgment of its inde∣pendency and sovereignty. Though Hamburg has been constantly summoned to the diet of the empire ever since the year 1618, when it was de∣clared a free imperial city, by a decree of the au∣lic council, yet it waves this privilege, in order to keep fair with Denmark. The emperor Sigismund granted it the privilege of coining gold and silver money; and by the emperor Frederic I. the citi∣zens
<PB N="303" REF="3080"/>
were exempted from paying any tolls on the Elbe. By their situation among a number of poor princes, they are continually exposed to their rapa∣ciousness, especially that of the Danes, who have extorted vast sums from them. The city is very po∣pulous, in proportion to its bulk; for though one may walk with ease round the ramparts in two hours, yet it contains, exclusive of Jews, at least one hundred thousand inhabitants. Here are a great many charitable foundations, the regula∣tions of which are greatly admired by foreigners. All persons found begging in the streets are com∣mitted to the house of correction to hard labour, as the rasping of Brasil and other kinds of wood. There is an hospital into which unmarried women may be admitted for a small sum, and comfortably maintained during the residue of their lives. The number of hospitals in this place is greater in pro∣portion to its bigness, than in any other protestant city in Europe. The revenue of the orphan-house alone is said to amount to between fifty and sixty thousand pounds. There is a large sumptuous hospital for receiving poor travellers that fall sick. In one of their workhouses or houses of correction, those who have not performed their task, are hoisted up in a basket over the table in the com∣mon hall, while the rest are at dinner, that they may be tantalized with the sight and smell of what they cannot taste. The established religion of Ham∣burg is Lutheranism; as for the Calvinists and the Roman catholics, they go to the ambassadors cha∣pels to celebrate their divine service and worship. They have here what they call a private confession, previous to the holy communion, which differs in nothing from that of the church of England, which is general, and the absolution is the same, only the poorest of the people here are forced to give a fee to the priest on these occasions. Their
<PB N="304" REF="3090"/>
churches, which are antient large fabrics, are open thoroughfares, and in some there are booksellers shops. The pulpit of St. Catha∣rines is of marble, curiously carved and adorned with figures and other ornaments of gold; and its organ, reckoned one of the best in Europe, has six thousand pipes. The cathedral is very antient, and its tower leans as if just going to fall; yet, on account of the singularity and beauty of its archi∣tecture, the danger attending it has been hitherto overlooked. There is still a dean and chapter be∣longing to this church, though secularized, from whose court there lies no appeal, but to the impe∣rial chamber at Wetzlar. The chapter consists of a provost, dean, thirteen canons, eight minor canons, and thirty vicarii immunes, besides others who are under the jurisdiction of the city. The cathedral, with the chapter, and a number of houses belonging to them, are under the immediate protection of his Britannic majesty as duke of Bremen, who disposes of the prebends that fall in six months of the year, not successively, but al∣ternately with the chapter. Hamburg is almost of a circular form, and six miles in compass. It has six gates, and three entrances by water, viz. two from the Elbe and one from the Alster, being di∣vided into the old and new, which are strongly fortified with moats, ramparts, bastions, and out∣works. The ramparts are very lofty, and planted with trees, and of such a breadth, that several carriages may go a breast. In the new town, to∣wards Altena, are several streets of mean houses inhabited by Jews. Through that entrance from the Elbe called the lower Baum, pass all ships going to or coming from sea. Every morning at the opening of it is seen a multitude of boats and small barks, whose cargoes consist of milk, fruits, and all kind of provisions, rushing in at the same
<PB N="305" REF="3100"/>
time. There are some fine chimes here, especially those of St. Nicholas, which play every morning early, at one o'clock in the afternoon, and on all festivals and solemnities. The other public struc∣tures in this city, besides the churches, make no great appearance: however, the yard, arsenal, and two armories, are well worth seeing. There are several convents or cloisters still remaining, which having been secularized, are now pos∣sessed by the Lutherans. One of them holds its lands by this tenure, That they offer a glass of wine to every malefactor who is carried by it for execution. There is a fine exchange, though inferior to that of London. It is the custom of Hamburg, that a citizen, when he dies, must leave the tenth of his estate to the city; and foreigners, not naturalized, must pay a certain sum annually for liberty to trade. The common carts here, are only a long pulley laid upon an axle-tree between two wheels, and drawn not by horses but by men, of whom a dozen or more are sometimes linked to these machines, with slings across their shoulders. Such of the senators, principal elders, divines, regular physicians, and graduates in law, as assist at funerals have a fee. The hangman's house is the common prison for all malefactors, on whom sentence is always passed on Friday, and on Monday they are executed. As, by their laws, no criminal is punishable unless he plead guilty, they have five different kinds of torture to extort such confession. The government of this city is lodged in the senate and three colleges of burghers. The former is vested with almost every act of sovereignty, except that of laying taxes and managing the finances, which are the prerogatives of the latter. The magistracy is composed of four burgomasters, four syndics, and
<PB N="306" REF="3110"/>
twenty-four aldermen, of whom some are lawyers and some merchants. Any person elected into the magistracy, and declining the office, must depart the place. No burgher is admitted into any of the colleges, unless he dwells in a house of his own within the city, and is possessed of one thousand rix-dollars in specie, over and above the sum for which the house may be mortgaged, or two thou∣sand in immovable goods, within the jurisdiction of the same. For the administration of justice, here are several inferior courts, from which an appeal lies to the Obergericht, or high court, and from that to the aulic council, and other imperial col∣leges. For naval causes here is a court of admi∣ralty, which, jointly with the city treasury, is al∣so charged with the care of the navigation of the Elbe, from the city to the river's mouth. In con∣sequence of this one hundred large buoys, some white, others black, are kept constantly floating in the river in summer; but in winter, instead of some of them, there are machines, like those called ice beacons, to point out the shoals and flats. Sub∣ordinate to the admiralty is a company of pilots, and at the mouth of the Elbe, is, or at least ought to be, a vessel always riding, with pilots ready to put on board the ships. At the mouth of the river also is a good harbour, called Cuxhaven, belonging to Hamburg, a light-house, and several beacons, some of them very large. For defraying the ex∣pence of these, certain tolls and duties were for∣merly granted by the emperors to the city. Be∣sides the Elbe, there is a canal by which a com∣munication is opened with the Trave, and there∣by with Lubeck and the Baltic, without the ha∣zard, trouble, and expence of going about by the Sound. The trade of Hamburg is exceeding great, in exporting all the commodities and manu∣factures
<PB N="307" REF="3120"/>
of the several cities and states of Germany, and supplying them with whatever they want from abroad. Its exports consist of linens of several sorts and countries, as lawns, diapers, Osnaburgs, dowlas, &amp;c. linen, yarn, tin-plates, iron, brass and steel wire, clap-board, pipe-staves, wainscot∣boards, oak-plank and timber, kid-skins, corn, beer in great quantities, with flax, honey, wax, aniseed, linseed, drugs, wine, tobacco, and me∣tals. Its principal imports are the woollen manu∣factures and other goods of Great Britain, to the amount of several hundred thousand pounds a∣year; they have also a great trade with Spain, Por∣tugal, and Italy, which is carried on mostly in English bottoms, on account of their Mediterra∣nean passes. Their whale-fishery is also very con∣siderable, fifty or sixty ships being generally sent out every year in this trade. Add to these a va∣riety of manufactures, which are performed here with great success, the chief of which are, sugar∣baking, calico printing, the weaving of damasks, brocades, velvets, and other rich silks. The in∣land trade of Hamburg is superior to that of any in Europe, unless perhaps we should except that of Amsterdam and London. There is a paper pub∣lished here at stated times, called the Preiscourant, specifying the course of exchange, with the price which every commodity and merchandize bore last upon the exchange. There is also a board of trade erected on purpose for the advancing every pro∣ject for the improvement of commerce. Another great advantage to the merchants is, the bank established in 1619, which has a flourishing credit. To supply the poor with corn at a low price, here are public granaries, in which great quantities of grain are laid up. By charters from several empe∣rors, the Hamburgers have a right of coinage, which they actually exercise. The English mer∣chants,
<PB N="308" REF="3130"/>
or Hamburgh company, as it is called, enjoy great privileges; for they hold a court with particular powers and a jurisdiction among themselves, and have a church and minister of their own. This city has a district belonging to it of considerable extent, which abounds with ex∣cellent pastures, intermixed with several large villages and noblemen's seats. Of what they possess in common with the city of Lubeck, mention has been made already. Though Hamburg has an undoubted right to a seat in the diet of the em∣pire, yet as she pays no contributions to the mili∣tary chest in time of war, and is also unwilling to draw upon herself the resentment of Denmark, she makes no use of that privilege. There is a schola illustris, or gymnasium here, well endowed, and furnished with six able professors, who read lec∣tures in it as at the universities. There are also several free-schools, and a great number of libra∣ries, public and private. The public cellar of this town has always a prodigious stock and vent of old hock, which brings in a considerable re∣venue to the state. Besides the militia, or trained bands, there is an establishment of regular forces, consisting of twelve companies of infantry, and one troop of dragoons, under the commandant, who is usually a foreigner, and one who has dis∣tinguished himself in the service. There is also an artillery company and a night-guard, the last of which is posted at night all over the city, and calls the hours. The reader, who desires a more minute account of Hamburg, we refer to a La∣tin piece, entitled Curae Geographicae, published not many years ago by Mr. Kleseker, the syndic, in which he will find full satisfaction. The longi∣tude of Hamburg is ten degrees eleven minutes east, and the latitude fifty-three degrees eleven mi∣nutes north.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of BREMEN.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which gives name to the duchy, and is its capital, stands on the Weser, in a fruitful plain, sixty miles south-west of-Hamburg; fifty-five east of Embden; eighty-three north-west of Brunswick; eighty-nine west of Lunenburg; sixty-five west of Zell; ninety north of Munster; and about four hundred and sixty north-west of Vi∣enna. It is a very antient place, and an archiepisco∣pal see, which was founded by Charles the Great. That of Hamburg was incorporated with it in 1223. Bremen has had many privileges con∣ferred on it by the emperors, particularly that of a seat and vote in the diet, of fishing in the Weser and other rivers that fall into it, of freedom from arrest throughout the empire, and of coinage. The archbishops thereof did not embrace the re∣formation, till 1585. At the peace of Westphalia the archbishopric was secularized, and given to the Swedes, who, by virtue of that cession, claimed the sovereignty of the city, contrary to the tenth article of the treaty, by which it was declared free and im∣perial. The dispute, however, was at length settled in 1666, when it was obliged to part with some of its antient privileges. Bremen is governed by a senate, which decides all causes ecclesiastical, civil, and criminal, without appeal to the imperial cham∣ber, unless the sum exceed six hundred Rhenish guilders, or about two hundred and ten pounds sterling. They have their own statute-laws, and a district of about ten miles round, under their ju∣risdiction. The Weser is not navigable for ships of burden higher than Brake or Elsfleth, near a dozen miles below the city, to which all goods are brought from thence in flat-bottomed vessels. The inhabitants carry on a considerable trade with
<PB N="310" REF="3150"/>
England, France, Spain, and Portugal, and have a share in the whale-fishery. The inland trade, which is also considerable, consists in exporting large quantities of beer, refining sugar, printing linens and calicoes, and dressing leather and cloth to great perfection. In short, it is reckoned the next port to Hamburg in the whole empire for com∣merce. The town is divided into the Old and New by the Weser, both which are pretty well fortified with high walls, a broad ditch, and a counterscarp, having a garrison of six hundred men, besides the guard kept day and night, at the town-house, by two hundred of the citizens. On the ramparts is a very agreeable walk, planted with trees, and broad enough for coaches. Here is a grand arsenal well stored with arms and artillery, both antient and modern, and a celebrated academy, or gymnasium, a guildhall, exchange, work-house, bridewell, and four capital churches belonging to the Calvi∣nists, whose religion predominates in this place, though the Lutherans nearly equal them in num∣ber. The cathedral belongs to the king of Great Britain as duke of Bremen, and four Lu∣theran ministers officiate in it, of whom the chief is a superintendant. The episcopal palace, the chapter-house, containing about two hundred dwel∣lings, an orphan-house, a Lutheran gymnasium, and the abbies of St. Anscharius and St. Wilhad, partly, are also in the duchy of Bremen, and in∣dependent of the city. The papists here attend divine worship at the chapel belonging to the em∣peror's resident. In 1741 the magistracy made an intire cession to the duchy of the bailiwic of Blu∣menthal and Neukerchen jurisdiction, together with the farms and salt-houses on the Duvelsmoor, in lieu of all its claims and pretensions. In the diet of the em∣pire, Bremen possesses the eighth seat on the Rhe∣nish bench in the college of imperial cities. Its
<PB N="311" REF="3160"/>
matricular assessment is three hundred and twenty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it contri∣butes one hundred and forty rix-dollars, sixty-se∣ven kruitzers. In this city is also a public cellar, well stored with old hock, of which the best is sold for about a dollar, or four shillings and six∣pence a bottle.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL LORDSHIP of SCHAUEN.</HEAD>
<P>This lordship is situated between the principa∣lity of Halberstadt and the county of Wernige∣rode. It belonged formerly to the abbey of Wal∣kenreid, afterwards to the family of Munchhau∣sen, from whom it came to the dukes of Bruns∣wick. One of these dukes settled it on the chapter of Halberstadt, who had elected him for their bi∣shop; but at the treaty of Westphalia they reco∣vered it. It was afterwards transferred to the count of Waldeck, who sold it to Otho Graten, by whose descendants it is at present possessed. It lies in the Lower Saxony, but is not reckoned among that circle's states.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of UPPER SAXONY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is bounded by that of Franco∣nia, the Upper Rhine, and Lower Saxony, and also by the Baltic sea, Prussia, Poland, Silesia, Lusatia, and Bohemia. It is of great extent, and contains the following states, viz. the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eisenach, Saxe-Coburg, Saxe Gotha, Saxe-Al∣tenburg, Saxe-Querfurt, the Hither and Farther Pomerania, Camin, Anhalt, Quidlenburg, Gern∣rode, Walkenried, Schwarzburg, Sondershau∣sen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, Mansfeld, Stolberg, Barby, the counts of Reussen, and the counts of Schonberg. No diets have been held in this cir∣cle since the year 1683. The elector of Saxony has always been the sole summoning prince and director of it. Most of the inhabitants profess the protestant religion. When the whole empire fur∣nishes forty thousand men, the quota of this circle is one thousand three hundred and twenty-two horse, and two thousand seven hundred and seven foot. Of the three hundred thousand florins granted by the empire in 1707, it contri∣buted only thirty-one thousand two hundred and seventy-one florins, twenty-eight kruitzers, being rated no higher than those of Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Swabia, and Burgundy, though it is much larger. Agreeable to a resolution and re∣gulation in 1654, this circle nominates now only two assessors of the chamber-court.</P>

<HEAD>SAXONY.</HEAD>
<P>This electorate consists of the duchy of Saxony, the greatest part of the margravate of Meissen, a part of the Vogtland, and the northern half of the landgravate of Thuringia. The Lusatias also, and a part of the county of Henneberg, belong to it, but are no part of this circle. The soil of the electoral dominions lying in this circle, is in gene∣ral exceeding rich and fruitful, yielding corn, fruits, and pulse in abundance, together with hops, flax, hemp, tobacco, aniseed, wild saffron, wood, and in some places woad, wine, coals, por∣celain clay, terra sigillata, fullers-earth, fine shi∣ver, various sorts of beautiful marble, serpentine∣stone, and almost all the different species of pre∣cious stones. Sulphur also, allum, vitriol, sand, and free-stone, salt-springs, amber, turf, cinna∣bar, quicksilver, antimony, bismuth, arsenic, cobalt, and other minerals are found in it. This country, besides the above articles, contains likewise valua∣ble mines of silver, copper, tin, lead, and iron, and abounds in many places with horned cattle, sheep, horses and venison. The principal rivers by which it is watered, are, the Elbe, the Schwarze-Elster, the Mulde, the Saale, the Unstrut, the Weisse-Elster, and the Pleisse. These rivers, as well as the lakes and rivulets, abound in fish, and in the White-Elster are found beautiful pearls. This electorate is extremely well cultivated and inhabited, and is said to include about two hundred and fifty great and small towns, upwards of five thousand vil∣lages, one hundred and ninety-six royal manors, and near as many royal castles, besides private estates and commanderies. The provincial diets here consist of three classes. The first is composed
<PB N="314" REF="3190"/>
of the prelates, the counts, and lords, and the two universities of Leipsic and Wittenberg. To the second belong the nobility in general, imme∣diate or mediate, that is, such as stand imme∣diately under the fief-chancery or the aulic judica∣tories, and such as are immediately under the juris∣diction of the amtman. The third class is formed of the towns in general. The general provincial diets are ordinarily held every six years, but there are others, called selection diets, which are conve∣ned commonly every two years. We would here observe, that not only these diets, but those in most of the other states of Germany, are at present ex∣tremely insignificant and unimportant, retaining lit∣tle more than the shadow of their former power and privileges; for even the petty princes, tho' they depend upon their more potent neighbours, and must be very careful not to give them any umbrage, are almost as absolute in their respective terri∣tories, as the grand seignior himself. As to reli∣gion, it was in this country that the reformation took its rise in the sixteenth century, to which it hath ever since adhered, according to the doctrines of Luther. The two late electors, when they em∣braced popery in order to qualify themselves to be elected kings of Poland, gave the most solemn as∣surances to their people, that they would invio∣lably maintain the established religion, and its pro∣fessors in the full and free enjoyment of all their ecclesiastical rights, privileges, and prerogatives whatsoever, in regard to churches, worship, cere∣monies, usages, universities, schools, benefices, incomes, profits, jurisdictions, and immuni∣ties. The electoral family still continue Roman catholics, though they have lost the crown of Po∣land, for which they at first embraced popery. With respect to ecclesiastical matters, the coun∣try is divided into parishes, and these again
<PB N="315" REF="3200"/>
into spiritual inspections and consistories, all sub∣ordinate to the ecclesiastical council and up∣per consistory of Dresden, in which city and Leipsic the Calvinists and Roman catholics enjoy the free exercise of their religion. Learning flourishes in this electorate, in which, besides the free-schools and gymnasia in most of the chief towns, are the two celebrated universities of Wittenberg and Leipzig, in the last of which are also societies for the liberal arts and the Ger∣man language, with booksellers and printers of the greatest eminence. A great variety of manu∣factures are also carried on in this country. The principal are those of fine and coarse linen, thread, fine lace, paper, fine glasses and mirrours, por∣celain equal if not superior to that of China, iron, brass, and steel wares, manufactures of gold and silver, cotton, wool, and silk, gloves, caps, hats, and tapestry; in which, and the natural produc∣tions mentioned above, together with dying, an important foreign commerce is carried on. A great addition has been made since the year 1718 to the electoral territories, by the extinction of the collateral branches of Zeitz, Merseburg, and Weissenfels, whose dominions devolved to the elder electoral branch, descended from the mar∣graves of Meissen. The first of these, who was elector of Saxony, was Frederic the Warlike, about the beginning of the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>This elector stiles himself duke of Saxony, Juliers, Cleve, and Berg, as also of Engern and Westpha∣lia, arch-marshal and elector of the Holy Roman empire, landgrave in Thuringia, margrave of Meissen, and of Upper and Lower Lusatia, bur∣grave of Magdeburg, princely count of Henne∣berg, count of La Mark, Ravensberg, Barby, and Hanau, and lord of Ravenstein. Among the elec∣tors
<PB N="316" REF="3210"/>
he is reckoned the sixth, as great-marshal of the empire, of which he is also vicar, during an in∣terregnum, in all places not subject to the vica∣riate of the count palatine of the Rhine. He is moreover sole director of the circle, and in the vacancy of the see of Mentz, claims the directo∣rium at the diet of the empire. His matricular assessment, on account of the electorate, is one thousand nine hundred and eighty-four florins, besides what he pays for other districts and terri∣tories. To the chamber-courts he contributes, each term, the sum of one thousand five hundred and forty-five rix-dollars, together with eighty∣three rix-dollars and sixty-two kruitzers on ac∣count of the county of Mansfield. In this electorate subordinate to the privy-council, are various colleges for the departments of war, foreign affairs, the finances, fiefs, mines, police, and ecclesiastical af∣fairs, together with high tribunals and courts of Justice, to which appeals lie from the inferior. The revenues of this elector are as considerable as those of any prince in the empire, if we except those of the house of Austria. They arise from the ordi∣nary and extraordinary subsidies of the states; his own demesnes, consisting of seventy-two bailiwics; the imposts on beer, and the fine porcelain of the country; tenths of corn, fruit, wine, &amp;c. his own silver mines, and the tenths of those that belong to particulars: all which, added together, bring in an yearly revenue of betwixt seven and eight hundred thousand pounds; yet the electorate is at present deeply in debt. The regular troops commonly amount to twenty thousand men, exclusive of the militia of the ban, the arriere-ban, and the body of miners and hunters, who are obliged in time of war to bear arms. The whole electorate is di∣vided into circles, of which we shall give some ac∣count, beginning with</P>

<HEAD>The ELECTORAL CIRCLE, or the DUCHY of SAXONY.</HEAD>
<P>This circle is bounded by the circles of Meissen, Leipzig, and Thuringia, the principality of An∣halt, the mark of Brandenburg and Lusatia. The principality of Anhalt lies across it, and divides it into two parts. Its greatest length and breadth is computed at about forty miles; but tho' it is watered by the Elbe, the Black Elster, and the Mulde, it is not very fruitful, the soil for the most part consisting of sand. It contains twenty∣four towns, three boroughs, betwixt four and five hundred villages, one hundred and sixty-four noblemens estates, eleven superintendencies, three inspections, under one consistory, and eleven pre∣fecturates or districts. The present duchy of Saxony is not to be confounded with the old; for the latter was of a much greater extent, and con∣tained in it those large tracts antiently called East∣phalia, Engern, and Westphalia, of which the Electoral Circle was no part, but was taken by Albert the Bear, margrave of Salzwedel, from the Venedi. His son Bernard obtaining the dignity of duke of Saxony from the emperor Frederic I. the name of duchy was given to this country; and the electoral dignity having been afterwards annexed to the duchy, it acquired thereby also the name of the electoral circle. The most considerable places in it are</P>
<P>Wittenberg, the capital, standing on the east-side of the Elbe, thirty-eight miles north-east of Leip∣zig, forty-one south-west of Berlin, and fifty-five north-west of Dresden. It is under immediate vassalage, and the seat of an aulic judicatory, a general superintendency, an inspection and con∣sistory. The town is not large, but well fortified,
<PB N="318" REF="3230"/>
containing a famous university, in which Melanc∣thon was a professor. In this place Martin Luther first began to preach against the pope's indulgen∣cies; and in the cathedral of All Saints, he is said to have been buried. In the old citadel of this town, the antient Saxon electors used to re∣side. Besides the university there is a Latin school in the town, with six masters. The library belonging to the university, is said to be very valuable. In 1756 the Prussians being masters of the town, destroyed a part of its fortifications.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of THURINGIA.</HEAD>
<P>This circle forms the northern part of the land∣gravate, and is a fruitful tract, abounding in corn, especially wheat, woods, black cattle, sheep, and horses; and in some places with vines and woad, and other valuable plants. It contains forty-seven towns, fourteen boroughs, betwixt seven and eight hundred villages, three hundred noble estates, seven superintendencies, and five under-consisto∣ries. Thuringia, the country of the antient Thu∣ringi, or Catti, a branch of the Vandals, men∣tioned by Tacitus, was formerly a kingdom, af∣terwards a county, then a landgravate, and was governed by its own princes for many ages, till
<PB N="320" REF="3250"/>
1124, when it devolved to the marquis of Misnia, and, with that country, afterwards to the duke of Saxony. But the modern Thuringia is only a part of the antient, nay but a part of the antient South Thuringia, which comprehends, besides, a large share of the modern Franconia, Hesse, &amp;c. On the extinction of the male line of the antient landgraves in 1247, it came to the margraves of Meissen, ancestors to the present electoral fa∣mily. The elector has no voice in the diet, on ac∣count of his share in the landgravate, or circle of Thuringia, in which the principal places are,</P>

<HEAD>MARGRAVATE of MEISSEN.</HEAD>
<P>This margravate, or marquisate, at present, is bounded by Lusatia, Bohemia, Franconia, Thu∣ringia, the principality of Anhalt, and the electo∣ral circle, or duchy of Saxony. It does not belong entirely to the elector, but partly to the other princes of the house of Saxony, the counts of Reussen, and the margraves of Brandenburg-Culmbach. Its plains abound with all sorts of grain, its forests with venison, its rivers with fish, and its hills with minerals. There are large vineyards about Dresden and Meissen; but the wine is not much admired. As the country is
<PB N="323" REF="3280"/>
one of the finest, most fruitful, and populous in Germany; so the inhabitants are accounted the most polite, hospitable, and lively of all the Ger∣mans. They are also distinguished by their fine talents and taste, especially in music. The ances∣tors of the house of Saxony were long margraves of Meissen, before they arrived at the electoral dignity. The marquisate is usually divided into five circles. In the first, or circle of Meissen, are said to be forty boroughs, four market-towns, upwards of one thousand villages, two hundred and eighty-three immediate vassals, one hundred and eighty mediate ones, and twenty electoral pa∣laces, of all which those chiefly worth mentioning are</P>
<P>Meissen, which gives name both to the marqui∣sate and circle, stands twelve miles north-west of Dresden, twenty eight south-east of Leipzig, and forty-six south of Wittenberg, on the left side of the Elbe, where the Meise, a rivulet, from which the town derives its name, falls into it. It was formerly the see of a bishopric, which was secula∣rized after the Reformation; but there is still a Lutheran chapter, consisting of a provost, dean, a senior, a chanter, and five canons. On a moun∣tain here there still remains a part of the old cita∣del, in which is carried on the celebrated manu∣facture of Misnian porcelain. Here is a public school, where was formerly a Benedictine cloyster, out of the revenues of which, the students, in number one hundred and eighteen, are maintain∣ed gratis. In the higher part of the town stands the antient cathedral, in which are the tombs of many princes and nobleman. Here are a great many other churches, with a town-school, and a manufactory of cloth. In 1745 the Prussians had their head-quarters in this town, and the chief hospital for their sick. In 1757 they burnt

<P>Dresden, lying in the district of that name, on both sides of the Elbe, the capital of the elec∣ctorate, one of the finest cities in Germany, the seat of the elector, and the high colleges, stands twelve miles from Meissen, forty from Leipzig, fifty-six from Wittenberg, sixty-seven from Prague, and two hundred and ten from Vienna. Besides the electoral palace, which is an old building erected in the sixteenth century, but repaired, or rather rebuilt, after the great damage it sustained by a fire in 1702, here are a great many other fine palaces, particularly that of the electoral, and the other princes, of count Bruhl, of prince Lubo∣mirski, the hotel de Saxe, de Hoym, &amp;c. In the inner-court of the electoral palace is a collection of rarities, called the Green-vault, that hardly has its equal in Europe. It is divided into seven apart∣ments, in the first of which is a great number of small brass models of the most famous statues and monuments extant, both antient and modern; in the second, is a variety of curious works in ivory; in the third, pure silver works; in the fourth, gilt silver plate, and vessels of pure gold; in the fifth, precious stones, and curiosities formed out of them; in the sixth, the arms of the several Saxon countries, the crown, sceptre, and imperial ap∣ple, which were used at the coronation in Poland, and other pieces; and in the seventh, some very rare jewels. In the Zwinger garden is an inesti∣mable repository of artificial and natural curiosi∣ties, together with the electoral library, and an admirable collection of anatomical, chirurgical, physical, and mathematical instruments. The
<PB N="325" REF="3300"/>
stately stone bridge over the Elbe, which divides the city into the Old and New Towns, consists of seventeen arches, and is one of the grandest in Europe. The arsenal here was stripped by the Prussians in 1756. In the town and suburbs are a great many fine churches, hospitals, and gar∣dens. In the suburbs in particular is an electoral palace and garden, with an orangery and kitchen-garden; the iron, copper, silver, and marble founderies; the boring-mill, and the mill for po∣lishing glass mirrors. In the Japanese palace, which was formerly a seat of count Fleming's, is an immense quantity of Japan and China ware; and in that called the Turkish palace, are a great variety of fine paintings, representing the ceremo∣nies of the seraglio, and Turkish dresses, especi∣ally those worn by the great officers of state. The electoral stables also are well worth seeing, and the opera house, and menageries. In this city and its neighbourhood are many curious manufactures, and many ingenious artists in statuary, painting, enamelling, and carving. The number of inha∣bitants in the city and suburbs is computed at be∣tween eighty and ninety thousand.</P>

Pirna, a town on the Elbe, which gives name to a district, and has a seat and voice at the diets. It carries on a great trade by means of the river. In the neighbourhood are quarries of sand-stone, of which a great deal is exported. Near it also is the fortress of Sonnenstein, between which and Konigstein, the Saxons, consisting of seventeen thousand five hundred men, entrenched them∣selves in 1756; but were so blocked up by the Prussians, that they were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war.</P>
<P>Konigstein, a small town on the Elbe, has a good sustian manufacture, and a seat and voice at the provincial diets. On a high and steep rock above it is an impregnable fortress of the same name; being secured on the side towards Dresden, where the ascent is easiest, by strong works, and a triple battery of cannon. It can neither be un∣dermined, nor raked with shot from the circum∣jacent mountains; and, as there is a well in the rock, with cisterns for collecting the rain and snow∣water, magazines of corn, wine, meal, and other necessaries, besides gardens, arable and pasture land, it is impossible to reduce it by blockade. Tho' it commands the Elbe, and the little town below it, yet it serves chiefly for a safe retreat to the electoral family, and a place where the archives, and other things of value, may be safely depo∣sited in times of danger; for this reason there is always a small garrison in it, under a commandant. In the year 1756 it was declared neutral during the war.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of LEIPZIG.</HEAD>
<P>This circle contains in it thirty-three towns, about one thousand villages, two hundred and fourteen immediate vassals, and one hundred and fifty mediate ones. The most considerable places in it are,</P>
<P>Leipzig, which gives name to the circle, and is one of the finest and most celebrated cities in all Germany. It stands in a pleasant plain on the Pleisse, surrounded with beautiful suburbs, or∣chards,
<PB N="330" REF="3350"/>
gardens, and rivulets, twenty-eight miles north-west of Meissen, forty south of Wirtenberg, forty-one west of Dresden, sixty-four south of Magdeburg, and two hundred and thirty-eight north-west of Vienna. This city was formerly called Lepzk, which signifies a lime tree, the country then abounding with that species of trees, and even at present a fine walk of them runs quite round the town; but the ditches are planted with mulberry-trees. Here is a famous university of six colleges, founded in 1409, in which are twenty∣four professors. It is not immediately subject to the elector, but to the town, and has a fine library, containing, among other curious books, Tretzer's Greek Commentary on Homer's Iliads, in a fair character. There are two Latin schools belonging to it, with a German society, and another for the encouragement of the liberal arts. A piece is published here monthly, entitled Acta Erudito∣rum Lipsiae, giving an account of the most re∣markable performances in the several branches of literature. This city is the first among the towns both at the general and particular diets, and the seat of several colleges and tribunals, particularly of the upper aulic judicatory. There are many fine churches here, and both the Calvinists and Papists are allowed the public exercise of their re∣ligion. The trade of the city is very great, espe∣cially during the three celebrated fairs at Easter, Michaelmas, and the beginning of the new year, when goods and rich curiosities, from all parts of Europe, are brought hither. In 1737 the goods entered at the custom house were computed to be worth near five millions of dollars. Besides a vast concourse of merchants and others on these occasions, the electoral family, and many other princes and princesses, are often present, and lay out great sums. The ground-floors of most of
<PB N="331" REF="3360"/>
the houses in Leipsic are warehouses. A variety of gold and silver, silk, woollen, cotton, linen, and tapestry manufactures are carried on here. Silk also is extremely well died, linen and cotton printed, leather dressed, and Prussian blue pre∣pared. There are about twenty booksellers in the town. Of the gardens in the suburbs, the Appel are the most remarkable, taking their name from that of a merchant, who first laid them out. The gardeners here are reckoned the best in Germany. The fields about the city are covered with infi∣nite numbers of larks from Michaelmas to Mar∣tinmas, and the woods are full of nightingales. The larks are sent to various places in great quan∣tities. The city is fortified with ramparts and a ditch, and there is a strong castle on the Pleisse, called Pleisenburg, in which is a mint. The Ger∣man language is said to be spoken in great purity in this city, which is very populous, and in winter well lighted with upwards of seven hundred lamps. In 1745 and 1756 it was garrisoned by the Prus∣sians, to whom it was obliged to pay very con∣siderable sums of money by way of contribution. The longitude of the town is twelve degrees forty-eight minutes east, and the latitude fifty-one degrees twenty-one minutes, north.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of ERZGEBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This circle has its name from the mountains in it, which are rich in ore and minerals, but yield little or no corn. It contains, including the seig∣niories of the count of Schonburg, sixty-five towns, of which ten are mine, and one a market-town, about seven hundred villages, one hundred and twenty-two immediate, and one hundred and forty-two mediate vassals. The most considerable places in it are,</P>
<P>Freyberg, the chief of the mine towns, lying on a branch of the Mulde, which takes its name from it, fourteen miles south-west of Meissen, and thirteen of Dresden. The number of its inhabitants is computed at sixty thousand. The town is strongly fortified with walls, ditches, and outworks, and has also, for its defence, a castle, called Freudenstein. Near the principal church is a chapel, in which the electors, down from Maurice, and many princes and princesses of the family have been buried. The town is so pleasantly situated, that it is become a Saxon pro∣verb to say, Were I lord of Leipzig, I would spend my fortune at Freyberg. It is the seat of
<PB N="335" REF="3400"/>
several offices relating to the mines, a court of justice and superintendency. In the neighbour∣hood of the town are valuable mines of silver, copper, tin, lead, sulphur, and vitriol. These mines were first discovered in 1180, since which time they have yielded an immense quantity of silver and other metals. The ore commonly yields about an ounce and a half of silver per pound, but sometimes a great deal more, and often no more than half an ounce. The electors tenths are said to amount, one year with another, to about one hundred and thirty thousand pounds. Here is a gymnasium, with a public library, a cannon and bell foundery, with manufactures of thread, lace, and beer. The wood for the mines is brought from Bohemia by the Mulde.</P>

<P>In this circle are seven boroughs, two market∣towns, upwards of two hundred villages, seventy∣five immediate, and twenty-two mediate vassals. The most considerable of these places are</P>
<P>Neustadt on the Orta, which gives name to the circle, and is its capital. It has a castle built by duke Henry - Frederic of Saxe-Zeitz, to which branch of the house of Saxony this circle belonged, till it failed in 1718. Here is the seat of a super∣intendency, and a mine-office.</P>

<HEAD>The FOUNDATION of MERSEBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This foundation, as it is called, is surrounded by a part of the circles of Leipzig and Thuringia, the principality of Querfurt, the county of Mansfeld, and the duchy of Magdeburg. Its greatest length is about twenty miles, and its breadth about fourteen. It is fruitful in corn, millet, and flax; and its rivers the Saale and El∣ster, as well as its ponds, abound in fish. There is also a medicinal and a salt spring in it. This district is said to contain seven towns, one borough, upwards of two hundred villages, and seventy-eight noble estates. Antiently it was a bishopric, and afterwards became a part of the dominions of the Merseburg collateral branch of the electoral∣house; upon extinction of which in 1738, it re∣verted to the electors. The chapter still subsists, and is composed of sixteen canons major, and four minor, who are all Lutherans, and of noble birth. To them belong the chapter-lands, with a particu∣lar court and consistory. The principal places in this territory are</P>
<P>Merseburg, in Latin Martisburgum, upon the Saale, which gives name to the country, and is its capital. It contains the antient cathedral, and episcopal palace, in which the dukes of Saxe-Merseburg used to reside. In the cathedral is a brass monument of the emperor Rodolph of Swabia, and the burying vault of the dukes. There is a gymnasium here founded out of the re∣venues of the bishopric, with a chapter-house, and houses for the canons. The beer brewed in the
<PB N="342" REF="3470"/>
town is much esteemed. In 1757 the bridge here over the Saale was burnt by the Austrian and circle troops.</P>
<P>Lutzen, a small town with a castle. In its neigh∣bourhood was fought the famous battle between the Imperialists and Swedes, in which Gustavus Adolphus lost his life, tho' the Imperialists were defeated. The spot where he fell is marked by a stone erected for that purpose.</P>
<P>Zwenkau, a small town, with a castle, on the Elster.</P>
<P>Skeuditz, another small town on the Elster, which gives name to a bailiwic, and has an elec∣ral hunting seat in it.</P>

<HEAD>The FOUNDATION or BISHOPRIC of NAUMBERG.</HEAD>
<P>A part of this bishopric is surrounded by the circle of Thuringia, and the rest by the circle of Leipzig, the principality of Altenburg, and the seigniory of Gera. It is about twenty-five miles long, and fifteen broad, producing both corn and wine, and containing five towns, and about one hundred and thirty villages. At the Reformation this bishopric was secularized, and the electors of Saxony were administrators of it, till the elector John-George I. bestowed it on his fourth son, duke Maurice, in the year 1653, in whose family, distinguished by the name of Saxe-Naumburg, or Zeitz, it continued, till they became extinct in 1718. The chapter not only of this bishopric, but also of that of Meissen and Merseburg, when they were secularized, made a capitulation, or agree∣ment, by one article of which, the bishop-ad∣ministrator
<PB N="343" REF="3480"/>
must always be a protestant. For each of these bishoprics the elector pays a ma∣tricular assessment to the empire. The protestant chapter consists of twelve capitulars, six major and four minor canons, who, it is said, must prove their nobility by sixteen descents, both by the fa∣ther's and mother's side; but the collegiate foun∣dation of Zeitz, which is also protestant, consists only of seven canons. The bishopric has its own regency and courts, and its representatives belong to the higher order of the states. The most con∣siderable places in it are</P>
<P>Naumburg, which gives name to it, and is its capital. It was once an imperial city, as well as a bishop's see, and stands near the Saale, twenty∣five miles south-west of Leipzig, and seventy-five west of Dresden. It has a small castle, with a ca∣thedral, and a great yearly fair on the 29th of July, and is partly under the jurisdiction of the town∣council, and partly of that of the chapter. The bi∣shopric was founded in 951 by the emperor Otho I. at Zeitz, but transplanted hither in 982. The re∣venue of it amounts, in the whole, to seventy thou∣sand crowns a-year. Not far from the town the Unstrut falls into the Saale.</P>
<P>Osterfeld, a small town betwixt Naumburg and Zeitz, and under the jurisdiction of the provostship of the former. Not far from it stood formerly a Benedictine monastery, called St. Georgenkloster, the estates of which now form a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Zeitz, a town on the Elster, which gave title to that branch of the electoral family, who were formerly administrators of the bishopric. It is the seat of the regency, and other colleges, and has a castle named from its founder duke Moritz, or Maurice Moritzburg. Here is also a manufacture of cloth, and not far from hence stood antiently a Benedictine cloister.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="3490"/>
There are two other small towns in the bishop∣ric, viz. Crossen, which stands on the Elster, be∣longs to the counts Fleming, and has a castle; and Regis, situate on the Pleisse.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BRANDENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>The marquisate of Brandenburg has Mecklen∣burg and Pomerania on the north, Poland on the east, Silesia, with the Lusatias, the electorate of Sax∣ony, Anhait, and duchy of Magdeburg on the south, and part of the same duchy, and that of Luneburg, on the west. Its greatest length is near two hun∣dred miles, and its greatest breadth near one hun∣dred. Its northern situation makes it very cold for seven or eight months in winter. The soil in general is far from being fruitful, a great part of it consisting of sand: yet there are several fruitful spots in it, and the whole, under the last and pre∣sent reign, has been greatly improved, and much better peopled. In some parts there is great plenty of potatoes and turnips; in others of buck∣wheat, millet, and flax; in others of tobacco, woad, and other herbs for dying. All sorts of colour earths, together with alum, salt-petre, amber, iron, stone, and medicinal springs, are found in it. Abundance of cattle, especially sheep, are bred here; and the woods not only supply the inhabitants with fuel, but with timber, charcoal, tar, and wood-ashes, both for domestic uses, and for exportation. The culture of silk is also carried on in this country with great success. The prin∣cipal rivers by which it is watered are the Elbe, the Oder, the Prignitz, the Havel, the Warte, and the Spree. Some of the rivers and lakes abound in fish, and are united by canals, for the benefit of navigation. They reckon in the whole Mark one hundred and twenty towns, above two thou∣sand
<PB N="345" REF="3500"/>
five hundred villages, and about eight hun∣dred thousand inhabitants. The states here con∣sist of the nobility and towns, whose assembly∣house is in the Spandau-street at Berlin, and who still enjoy some small remains of their antient pri∣vileges. The hereditary officers of the marquisate are a marshal, chamberlain, cup bearer, pur∣veyor, sewer, treasurer, and ranger. The king of Prussia, who is also elector of Brandenburg, with his whole court, are Calvinists; but the re∣ligion of most of the inhabitants is Lutheranism. The churches of both persuasions are well endowed, and the laity jointly employed by the government. The Roman catholics are also tolerated here. In short, every inhabitant enjoys full liberty of conscience. A great variety of manufactures, most of which were introduced by the French refugees, are car∣ried on in the marquisate, especially at Berlin and Potsdam, where are also excellent painters, statu∣aries, and engravers. By means of these manu∣factures, fabrics, and arts, not only large sums are kept in the country, but also imported from other parts, to which considerable quantities of the manufactures, and natural productions, are exported. For the education of youth, and the advancement of learning, besides Latin schools in several places, and gymnasia, there is an univer∣sity at Frankfort on the Oder, and an academy of sciences at Berlin. This marquisate, together with the arch-chamberlain's-office, and the electoral dig∣nity, was conferred, in 1415, hereditarily on Fre∣deric V. or VI. burgrave of Nuremberg, in whose family it still remains, with the addition of many other territories and dignities. The present king of Prussia and elector of Brandenburg Frederic III. is one of the greatest and most powerful princes of Europe, as well as one of the most despotic. He hath greatly en∣larged his dominions, by the addition of all the
<PB N="346" REF="3510"/>
Lower, together with the greatest part of the Upper Silesia, and the county of Glatz. In 1744 he also took possession of East Friesland; but in 1754 disposed of his share of the succession of the late king William, prince of Orange, to the pre∣sent prince and stadtholder. The qualifications and talents of this prince are great, and he hath performed many singular actions; but his ambi∣tion would have proved his ruin, had he not been supported in the last war by the troops and treasures of Great Britain. It is hard to say, whether his sub∣jects have been greater gainers by his encouraging and promoting commerce, manufactures, agri∣culture, population, order, and the regular distri∣bution of justice; or sufferers by the wars in which his ambition hath involved them, and the prodi∣gious standing army he keeps constantly on foot, to maintain his conquests, and extend them, as opportunity offers. Such an army must be a great burden, besides their labour being lost in a great measure to the country. His title runs thus, Fre∣deric, king of Prussia, margrave of Brandenburg; of the holy Roman empire arch-chamberlain and elector; sovereign and supreme duke of Silesia; sovereign prince of Orange, Neufchatel and Va∣lengin; of the county of Glatz, Gelders, Magde∣burg, Cleve, Juliers, Berg, Stetin, Pomera∣nia, the Cassubi and Wends, Mecklenburg and Crossen, duke; burgrave of Nuremberg; prince of Halberstadt, Minden, Camin, Wenden, Schwe∣rin, Ratzeburg, East-Frieseland, and Meurs; count of Hohenzollern, Ruppin, the Mark, Ravensberg, Hohenstein, Tecklenburg, Schwerin, Lingen, Buren, and Leerdam; lord of Ravenstein, the countries of Rostock, Stargard, Lauenburg, Butow, Arlay, and Breda, &amp;c. Among the electors he possesses the seventh place. As arch∣chamberlan he carries the scepter before the em∣peror
<PB N="347" REF="3520"/>
at his coronation, and brings him water in a silver bason to wash with. In the college of princes of the empire, he has five voices. His assessment, as elector, is sixty horse and two hun∣dred and seventy-seven foot, or one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight florins in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar his quota is eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars, fifty-eight kruitzers, each term. As to the orders of the knights of the Black Eagle, and of Merit, it is sufficient here to observe, that the former was in∣stituted by king Frederic I. at his coronation, and the other by the present king. For the go∣vernment of this country and the administration of justice, there are several supreme colleges and tribunals, particularly for the departments of war, foreign affairs, and the finances, there are distinct boards. Here is also a supreme ecclesiastical council and consistory for the Lutherans; a supreme directory of the Calvinist church; a supreme medicinal college; a supreme mine-office; a college or board of trade, &amp;c. Those of the French nation, settled in this country, are al∣lowed particular courts of their own. The a∣mount of the yearly revenues of the Mark, a∣rising from the domains, protection-money paid by the Jews, tolls, land-tax, mines, forests, du∣ties on stamp-paper, salt, and variety of other im∣posts and excises, is computed at about two mil∣lions and a half of crowns; but the money is said to be much inferior in goodness to that of Saxo∣ny and the dominions of Hanover. During the late war it was extremely debased. Some esti∣mate the whole number of the inhabitants of the royal and electoral dominions at five millions, and the revenues at about two millions sterling. The present king and elector keeps upwards of one hundred thousand men on foot in time of peace,

which are said to cost him more than half of his whole revenue. These troops are under strict discipline, very expert at their exercise, always in readiness to march, and always com∣plete. Each regiment has a particular canton or district allotted it, for its quarters and raising re∣cruits. The infantry are cloathed in blue, and the horse and dragoons in white; and both are re∣quired to hear sermon twice a day when in quar∣ters or garrisons. In time of peace they are al∣lowed, for several months in the year, to hire themselves out, or to follow their business either as burghers or peasants, in the canton where they are quartered; but they are not allowed to marry. A considerable part of these troops are stationed in the Mark, particularly at Berlin and Potsdam. The corps of hussars alone amounts to about ten thousand men. The Mark of Brandenburg is divided, in general, into the Electoral and New Marks. The former is again subdivided into the Old Mark, the Pregnitz, the Middle Mark, and the Ucker Mark. In the Old Mark, which lies on the west side of the Elbe, between that river and Lunenburg, and is about fifty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. The most considerable places are</P>
<P>Stendal, the metropolis, standing on the river Uchte, twenty-eight miles north of Magdeburg, in a plain, near a large forest surrounded by mountains. It was formerly one of the Hanse∣towns, and had several cloisters, the revenues of which are now applied partly to the maintenance of the university of Franckfort on the Oder, the town school, and the convents of Lutheran ladies. The town is strongly fortified, has divers manufac∣tures, introduced by the French refugees, who enjoy a tribunal here of their own, and is the seat of the supreme tribunal of the Old Mark, of a general
<PB N="349" REF="3560"/>
superintendency, and an inspection. This town is moreover a great thoroughfare, lying on the road from Magdeburg and Erfurt, to Hamburg and Lubec.</P>
<P>Salzwedel, a town seated on the Jeeze, in a low marchy tract, and divided into the old and new, each of which has its own magistracy. Here were antiently several cloisters, the churches of which are still in good condition. There are now some woollen and linen manufactures, in which and beer, a brisk trade is carried on. The town was formerly of the Hanse, and at present gives name to a circle and provincial riding. In its neigh∣bourhood is found salt-petre.</P>
<P>Gardenlegen, or Gardeleben, a town on the Mulde, having a manufacture of cloth, a Latin∣school, several churches and hospitals, and giv∣ing name to a circle, and provincial riding. In 1757 the French exacted heavy contributions from it. In the neighbourhood is a large wood called the heath of Gardelegen, and also hop-gardens.</P>
<P>Seehausen, a small town surrounded by the ri∣ver Aland, giving name to a circle and provincial riding.</P>
<P>Tangermunde, a town on the river Tanger, near its influx into the Elbe, where all ships going up or down the last of these rivers, pay a toll. The town gives name to a circle and riding, and has a strong fort near it, with some trade by means of the Elbe.</P>
<P>Osterburg, a small town at the conflux of the Uchte and Biese, which formerly gave title to counts, possessed of a considerable territory.</P>
<P>Werben, a small town not far from the Elbe, which, on the other side, receives the Havel. Here is a commandery of the order of St. John, and a spiritual inspection.</P>
<P>Distorf, antiently an Augustine nunnery, but
<PB N="350" REF="3570"/>
now a Lutheran, consisting of twelve ladies, one half of whom are noble, and the other of burgher extraction.</P>
<P>Arendsee, an open little town, standing on a lake, and giving name to a circle and riding. Here was formerly a Benedictine nunnery, in which now reside an abbess and six protestant la∣dies.</P>
<P>Arneburg, a small town on the Elbe, which formerly had counts of its own. In its castle, several emperors and princes have at times re∣sided. It has some traffic by the Elbe, and gives name to a circle and riding.</P>
<P>Buch, a pretty little town on the Elbe.</P>
<P>Nuendarf, formerly a Cistercian nunnery, but now a foundation for a domina and six protestant ladies.</P>
<P>Betzendorf, a small town with a castle, belong∣ing to the counts of Schulenburg, who are also proprietors of Apenburg, another inconsiderable town in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Kalbe, a small town situated in a swampy wer∣der or island in the Milde, and belonging, with its jurisdiction, to the family of Alvensleben.</P>
<P>In the second division of the electoral Mark, called the Prignitz, bounded by the Elbe and Ha∣vel, the duchy of Mecklenburg, and a part of the Middle Mark, and extending forty miles in length and thirty in breadth, the most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Perlberg, the capital, which is situated on the Stepenitz, contains about three hundred and seventy dwelling-houses, gives name to a circle, and is the seat of an inspector.</P>
<P>Wittenberge, a small town situated on that called the Old Elbe.</P>
<P>Prizwalk, a town seated on the Domnitz, and giving name to a circle and inspection. In this
<PB N="351" REF="3580"/>
circle are two foundations for protestant ladies, and three other small towns, viz. Freienstein, Meienburg, and Putlitz, the last of which has its own lords.</P>
<P>Kyritz, a town situated on the rivulet of Jage∣litz, and giving name to a circle and spiritual in∣spection. In its neighbourhood are several lakes.</P>
<P>Havelberg, a small town on an island in the ri∣ver Havel, over which there are three draw∣bridges. It was antiently the see of a bishop, suffragan to Magdeburg, and has still a Luthe∣ran chapter, the members of which are distin∣guished by a cross, and possessed of a considera∣ble estate. Great quantities of brandy are di∣stilled, and stockings knit here, where is also a considerable fishery in the Elbe. Abundance of wood also is conveyed from hence to Hamburg.</P>
<P>Lenzen, a small town situated not far from the Elbe, near two lakes, and giving name to a circle and inspection. Here is also a toll and ferry on the Elbe.</P>
<P>Witstack, a small town situated on the Dosse, where was formerly a palace of the bishop of Havelberg. The town gives name to a circle and spiritual inspection, in the former of which, near Zechlin, is a chrystal and glass-house.</P>
<P>Welsnack, a small town on the Kartau. Pil∣grimages were made to this place antiently, on account of its three hosts, which the priests and monks from lucrative views, pretended remained untouched when the church was burnt down, with a drop of blood on each of them. In con∣sequence of the resort of devotees, this place rose from a village to a town.</P>
<P>The third division of the electoral Mark is that called the Middle Mark, which is bounded by the Pregnitz, the duchy of Magdeburg, the duchy of Saxony, the Lower Lusatia, the Neumark, the
<PB N="352" REF="3590"/>
Uckermark, and the duchy of Mecklenburg. It is said to extend about one hundred miles from the banks of the Elbe to the Oder, and is divided into eight circles, in which the principal places are</P>
<P>Berlin, the capital of the whole Prussian domi∣nions, and one of the finest and largest cities of Germany. It consists of five towns united toge∣ther, and is the usual residence of the royal family, and the seat of the high colleges. In 1755, the number of inhabitants, including the garrison, with their wives and children, amounted to one hundred and twenty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-one. It lies on the Spree, and contains many fine palaces, and other buildings, many long, strait, and broad streets, and some fine squares. Among the most remarkable public and other edifices in it is, the royal palace, which is a vast pile of buildings, but not regular or uniform, having been built by different architects, and at different times. It is adorned with the finest paintings and tapestry, and such a quantity of gold and silver plate, especially the latter, as is not to be met with in any other court in Europe. Here is also a cabinet of rarities, natural and artificial, a choice collection of medals, with a dispensary for the palace, and one of the best libraries in the empire. Of the other structures the chief are, the council-house in King's-street; the Calvinist gymnasium in the St. Esprit-street, well endow∣ed; the magnificent garrison church, and provin∣cial-house in Spandau-street; the Jews synagogue in Heydereuter-street; the royal magazine in Cloyster-street, in which is kept a great quantity of rough wool, which is delivered out to poor manufacturers to be spun and wove, and when returned is dyed and disposed of by the managers of the orphan house at Potsdam, to which cha∣rity the profits of it are appropriated; the Luthe∣ran
<PB REF="3600"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of the City of Berlin.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="353" REF="3610"/>
gymnasium in that called the Gray-cloister; Frederic's fine hospital in Stralau-street, in which above eight hundred children are instructed gratis. At the King's gate is the court of the cadets, in which young noblemen and gentlemen are instruct∣ed in all noble exercises, and particularly are fit∣ted for commands in the army, and in the corps of engineers. All these, except the royal palace, which stands in that part of the city called Old Coln, are in the Proper Berlin. In the suburbs is the magnificent garden of count Reussen, that beautiful house and garden called Monbijou, the house and garden of Belvidere, &amp;c. the large and stately hospital for invalids, in which about one thousand persons are maintained, consisting of officers and soldiers, with their wives and children. Besides lodging and fuel, they have a certain al∣lowance of bread and money weekly. Over the Spree are several bridges, one of which, consisting of five arches, is very beautiful, and has a metal statue on it of the great elector Frederic-William. In the magnificent new Calvinist church in Old Coln, is the burying-place of the royal family. In the same quarter is also the new riding-acade∣my, the royal stables, a Lutheran gymnasium, and many other stately edifices, public and private. There are two sugar-houses in this city, in which as much sugar is refined as is sufficient to sup∣ply the whole Prussian dominions. Many other manufactures are carried on here, particularly one of porcelain, inferior in no respect to that of Meissen, except in the paintings. The improvement of Ber∣lin, and of the Prussian dominions in general, has been owing in a great measure to the French re∣fugees, and the arts and manufactures introduced by them. The canals cut from it to the Havel, the Oder, and the Elbe, not only supply it with plen∣ty of fish, but greatly promote its trade; as they
<PB N="354" REF="3620"/>
open a communication, by small vessels, from Si∣lesia to the mouth of the Elbe: add to this, the great attention of the king to the embellishment and aggrandizement of his capital, and its flourish∣ing condition will no longer be matter of wonder. Here is an academy of sciences, an academy of fine arts, especially painting, a college for phy∣sic and surgery, an anatomical theatre, a fine tapestry manufacture, a grand opera house, an arsenal, a number of well regulated hospitals, many Lutheran and Calvinist, with two Roman Catho∣lic churches, many pleasant gardens and walks, and, to crown the whole, an admirable police and order in every particular. We may form some idea of the trade and industry of this city by the number of looms at work in it, which in 1755 were for silks four hundred and forty-three, for half silks one hundred and forty-nine, for woollen stuffs two thousand eight hundred and fifty-eight, for cotton four hundred and fifty-four, for linen two hundred and forty-eight, for lace-work four hun∣dred and fifty-four, for silk stockings thirty-nine, and for woollen cloths three hundred and ten. In 1757 a straggling party of Austrians made an irruption into the suburbs of Kopenick, and ex∣torted from the inhabitants two hundred thou∣sand rix-dollars. The environs of Berlin are very pleasant, being interspersed with villages, vineyards, canals, pleasure-houses, and gardens belonging to the royal family, or individuals. Among the palaces in the neighbourhood be∣longing to the royal family, Schonhausen and Charlottenburg are the most remarkable. The first is about two miles from Berlin, on the river Panka, which supplies its fine gardens with water. The other, which is richly furnished, and stands on the Spree, hath a garden laid out in a very fine taste, and contains the curious collection of an∣tiques
<PB N="355" REF="3630"/>
once belonging to cardinal Polignac. The longitude of the city is 13 deg. 44 min. east, and the latitude fifty-two deg. twenty-eight min. stand∣ing sixty miles north-east of Magdeburg, one hun∣dred and fifty north-west of Prague, and three hundred north-west of Vienna.</P>
<P>Brandenburg lies upon the Havel, twenty-three miles from Berlin, and gives name to the whole electorate. It is divided into the Old and New Town, and was antiently the see of a bishop. The mountain in the neighbourhood, called Marien∣berg, is planted with vines. Here is a small co∣lony of French Calvinists, with a manufacture of cloth, fustian, and canvas; and a pretty good trade is carried on by means of the Havel. The fort here looks like a suburb, and contains a riding∣school, with the cathedral church. The greatest part also of the members of the chapter, which still subsists, and is composed of a Lutheran provost, dean, senior, subsenior, and three other canons, resides in it. They are distinguished by a cross of gold, enamelled with violet, terminating in eight points, and have a considerable estate. Near the town is a large lake.</P>
<P>Potsdam, a large town on an island formed by the Havel, and some neighbouring lakes, four miles south-west of Berlin. It was but an inconsidera∣ble place, till the elector Frederic-William built a palace or castle in it, since which the town hath been continually increasing, and receiving new embellishments, as well as the palace. Many strait streets, with canals in the middle, and rows of trees on each side, as in Holland, run thro' the centre of the town from the Havel, and make a grand appearance. The palace itself, and the houses in the neighbourhood of it, are very magnificent. Before the castle is a square, adorned with Roman columns, in which the gar∣rison
<PB N="356" REF="3640"/>
is daily exercised; and behind are very fine gardens. In the neighbourhood is a large forest or park, paled in for stag-hunting, containing a royal hunting-seat, with vistas in form of a star. About the town are also many vineyards, and in the market-place is a stately obelisk, of variegated Silesian marble, with a pedestal of white marble, and marble busts of the kings on each side. In the orphan-house two thousand soldiers children of both sexes are maintained, cloathed, and edu∣cated. Here are several beautiful churches, in one of which is a fine set of chimes, a noble foun∣dery for arms, manufactures of velvet, silk, gold and silver lace, &amp;c. and fine stables for the horse∣guards, of which, with the foot guards, and other battalions, the garrison consists. Not far from this town is the palace of Sans-Souci, on the top of a mountain, whence there is a most delightful prospect of the town, and the adjacent country, with its woods, groves, lakes, vineyards, and rivers. The palace is but small, but extremely elegant, richly furnished, and adorned with the finest paintings, sculptures, statues, gardens, and whatever else can contribute to render it a most enchanting place. In one of the apartments, which is wainscotted with cedar, and adorned with foliages of gold, is kept a small library. The mountain, on which the palace stands, is cut into terraces, and planted with vines.</P>

<HEAD>The NEW MARK.</HEAD>
<P>The present New Mark has Silesia on the south, the Middle Mark on the west and south-west, Po∣land on the east, running out towards Pomerania on the north. The Oder divides it from the Mid∣dle Mark and the Uckermark, being about one hundred miles in compass. The soil, for the most part, is sandy; but there are some good corn-lands and vineyards, with many woods and marshes, plenty of fish, game, and iron-ore. The New Mark contains thirty-eight towns, and upwards of two hundred thousand inhabitants. The states hold their meetings at Kustrin. The country belonged antiently to the knights of the Teutonic order, but was sold in 1455 to the elector of Bran∣denburg. It has its particular regency, courts of justice, and other colleges, and is divided into circles and inspections, in which the most conside∣rable places are,</P>
<P>Kustrin, the capital, forty-five miles east of Berlin, and standing in a marsh near the conflux of the Oder and Warte. The waters of these rivers are said to be distinguishable for above a mile after their meeting, those of the Oder being of a yellowish cast, and those of the Warte, blackish. The town, which is very strong, both by art and nature, is the seat of the regency and high colleges for the New Mark; and, including the suburbs, was a large town, till it was almost entirely destroyed by the bombs and red hot bullets of the Russians in 1758; however, it held out till it was relieved by the king. The adjacent coun∣try is so marshy, that there is hardly any access to the town but by causeys and bridges.</P>

The elector of Brandenburg is patron of the order within the territory of the Sonnen∣burg grand-mastership, and the master takes an oath of fidelity to him, as sovereign of the country. The knights, who are created by the grand-master, and may be Lutheran Protestants, are preferred to commanderies as they become vacant, accord∣ing to their seniority. They must all be noble∣men or gentlemen, and dubbed at Sonnenburg; but are not obliged to make vows of celibacy and chastity. The grand-master is elected by the free choice of the commanders.

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of ALTENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which has Thuringia on the north, Franconia on the west and south, and Voight∣land
<PB N="375" REF="3830"/>
on the east, being a part of the antient Of∣terlands, is divided into two parts by the lordship of Gera, belonging to count Reussen. The soil is fruitful, both in corn and grass, yielding also plenty of wood, with mines of copper, cobalt, vi∣triol, and other minerals. The principal river by which it is watered is the Pleisse. The states con∣sist of the nobility and towns, and the diets are held at Altenburg. The greater part of the prin∣cipality belongs to the house of Saxe-Gotha, and the rest to that of Saxe-Weimar and Saalfeld. The inhabitants are Lutherans, under a general, and five special superintendents. Of the towns, the following are the principal:</P>
<P>Altenberg, which gives name to the principality, and is its capital, standing on the Pleisse, twenty∣four miles south of Leipzig, and thirty-seven west of Dresden. It is the seat of the chief offices and courts for the districts belonging to the duke of Saxe-Gotha, who has a castle here, situated on a rock, in which several electors and dukes of Sax∣only formerly resided. The town, which is pretty large, and was once an imperial city, contains a foundation for the education of young ladies of de∣cayed families, a house belonging to the Teutonic Order, an orphan-house, a house of correction, a schola illustris, with a good library and museum. It gives name to a district, in which are,</P>
<P>Lucca, a small town on the river Schnauder, with a woollen manufacture; Schmollen, a small town on the Sprotta; Gosznitz, a market-town on the Pleisse; Meuselwitz, a large market-town on the Schnauder, which, with its district, belongs to the counts of Seckendorff, who have a fine palace and gardens in the town.</P>
<P>Ronneburg, a small town, which has a manu∣facture of earthen ware and woollen cloth, and
<PB N="376" REF="3840"/>
gives name to a superintendency and a district, belonging to Saxe-Gotha.</P>
<P>Eisenberg, a small town, giving name to a su∣perintendency and district, belonging to Saxe-Gotha.</P>
<P>Camburg, a small town on the Saale, which was formerly the capital of a county, and now gives name to a district, belonging to Saxe-Gotha.</P>
<P>Roda, a considerable market-town, on a river of the same name, having a seat of the prince's, with a manufacture of cloth and stockings, and belonging, with its district, to Saxe-Gotha.</P>
<P>Orlamunda, a small town near the Saale, where the Orla falls into it. This town had formerly counts of its own, but now belongs to Saxe-Gotha, together with the district in which it stands, and which takes its name from Kahla, a small town, lying also on the Saale.</P>
<P>To the dukes of Saxe-Gotha belong also the salt-works at Sulza, a small town on the Ilm, in the principality of Weimar.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of SAXE-COBURG-SAALFELD.</HEAD>
<P>In the districts belonging to the duke of this principality the most considerable places are</P>
<P>Saalfeld, a handsome town on the Saale, in which is the mint for the circle of Upper-Saxony, with a ducal palace (but the duke keeps his court at Coburg) several churches, a grammar-school, a smelting and vitriol house, with manufactures of cloth, and of gold and silk stuffs. On an emi∣nence near the town stood the once celebrated and rich Benedictine abbey of St. Peter, other∣wise called Saalfeld abbey. The abbot was a
<PB N="377" REF="3850"/>
prince of the empire, and had both a vote and seat in the diets, with the privilege of coinage.</P>
<P>Posneck, a small, but thriving town. Most of its inhabitants are either clothiers, curriers, or potters.</P>
<P>Grafenthal, in Latin Vallis Comitum, a small town near the river Zepten, in which are some iron and copper works, with a glass-house. It formerly gave name to a lordship belonging to the counts of Orlamunda.</P>
<P>Lehsten, a small town, having a quarry of ex∣cellent slate.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The TERRITORIES belonging to the PRINCES of HATZFELD.</HEAD>
<P>These territories, consisting of the lower lord∣ship of Kranichfeld, that of Blankenhayn, and a part of the county of Gliechen, contain only the following places worth mentioning,</P>
<P>Wandesleben, a market-town on the Apfelstet, in the county of Gliechen, which, with other places in the county, belonging to the counts of Hatzfeld, is held of the electors of Mentz; as is also the lower lordship of Kranichfeld, with that part of the town lying on the east side of the Ilm.</P>
<P>Blankenhayn, a small town, which gives name to a lordship, lying betwixt the Weimar territo∣ries and those of Altenburg. Both town and lordship are held as a fief of the elector of Mentz.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of QUERFURT.</HEAD>
<P>The districts which form this principality lie not contiguous, but some of them in Thuringia, and others betwixt the duchy of Saxony, the mar∣quisate of Brandenburg and Lower Lusatia, and
<PB N="378" REF="3860"/>
consist at present of those of Querfurt, Juterbock, Dahme, and Heldrungen, As to those of Wen∣delstein, Sittichenbach, and Burg, which formerly made a part of it, the two former, though subject to the same prince as the others, namely the elec∣tor of Saxony, have been dismembered from it, and the last belongs to the king of Prussia. This principality, except the district of Burg, reverted upon the failure of the Saxe-Weissenfels collate∣ral line to the electoral house, which, on account of it, has a seat and voice in the diet, paying to the chamber of Wetzlar, forty-two rix-dollars, seven kruitzers. The places worth mentioning in it are,</P>
<P>Querfurt, which gives name to the principality, and is its capital, being a considerable town, in∣cluding the suburbs, with an old castle on a hill. It is the seat of a superintendency, and, with its dependencies, antiently constituted a lordship. A fair is held annually on the Wednesday in Easter week, a little without the town, and much re∣sorted to.</P>
<P>Heldrungen, a small town, not far from the Unstrut, giving name to a district and superin∣tendency. It had formerly a strong castle, and lords of its own.</P>
<P>Juterbock, a town situated on the Angerbach, which had formerly a castle, and now gives name to a district and superintendency. Near it, in 1644, a battle was fought between the imperia∣lists and Swedes, to the advantage of the latter.</P>
<P>Dahme, a small town, which is the seat of a su∣perintendency, and has a ducal palace in its neigh∣bourhood.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DUCHY of POMERANIA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded on the east by a part of Ducal Prussia, to the south by Poland and the
<PB N="379" REF="3870"/>
marquisate of Brandenburg, by the duchy of Mecklenburg to the west, and the Baltic sea to the north. Taking all together, though much less than it was antiently, it extends above two hundred miles from east to west, along the coast of the Baltic, and from fifty to eighty in breadth. As to the soil, it is, in general, pretty fruitful, yielding wheat, rye, barley, oats, buck-wheat, turneps, pease, beans, and vetches, and in some parts, millet, flax, and hemp. The woods and fo∣rests supply the inhabitants with timber and fuel, game, and venison; the rivers, lakes, and sea, with fish, and a great variety of water-fowl, and the heaths with turf; nor is it destitute of fruit, mine∣ral and salt-springs, and herds of cattle. The Pomeranian geese, hams, sausages, and salmon, are reckoned the best in Germany. The princi∣pal rivers here are the Oder, the Reckenitz, the Peene, the Ucker, the Rando, the Ihna, the Re∣ga, the Persante, the Wipper, the Grabo, the Stolpe, the Lupo, and the Lebe, all which fall into the Baltic, within the limits of this duchy. There are several pretty good havens upon the coast, on which also, especially that of Hither Pomerania, amber is frequently found. In the whole duchy are sixty-eight towns, which are di∣vided into immediate and mediate. The latter are subject to their lords, who are either the king's agents, or noblemen, and their courts; but the for∣mer are independent of these, and have special privileges, particularly that of being represented in the diets, which consist of the prelates, nobi∣lity, and deputies of these towns. The inhabi∣tants of the duchy, who are computed at four hundred and sixty thousand, are mostly descended from the Germans and Sclavonians, or Wends. The language of the latter is still spoken in some parts of the country. The peasants, on the estates
<PB N="380" REF="3880"/>
of the nobility, are, in general, bound to soccage; but those belonging to the towns, and some of the others, live more happily, and are exempt from servile duties. Lutheranism is the predominant religion here; but Calvinists and catholics are also tolerated, at least in some places. Besides the grammar-schools and colleges to be met with here, there is an university at Grieffswalde. In the towns on the navigable rivers and the Baltic, a conside∣rable trade is carried on, and many manufactures established. From the port of Stetin, in 1756, no less than one thousand six hundred and seventy∣one vessels were laden, besides ninety-seven that went away in ballast. The antient inhabitants of the country were the Suevi and the Vandals, to whom, in the sixth century, succeeded the Sclavo∣nians or Wends, and afterwards, under the dukes, great numbers of Germans removed hither, chiefly from the Brunswic territories. The race of these dukes began about the beginning of the twelfth century, and came to a period in 1637; after which, at the treaty of Westphalia, a great part of the country was assigned to Sweden, and the rest to the elector of Brandenburg; but by the peace of Stockholm in 1720, Frederic-William, king of Prussia, obtained a considerable portion of that which had been ceded to the Swedes. On account of this duchy both Sweden and Prussia have a vote in the diets of the empire and circle; the former paying one hundred and twenty-three rix-dollars, twelve kruitzers; and the latter two hundred and seventy rix-dollars, forty-nine kruit∣zers, to the chamber of Wetzlar. The Swedish governor resides at Stralsund, which together with Grieffswalde and Wismar, is the seat of the high colleges and tribunals; but those of the king of Prussia are held at Old Stetin, or Coszlin. The
<PB N="381" REF="3890"/>
revenues arising to Sweden from Pomerania amount to about one hundred and twenty-four thousand rix-dollars; whereas the king of Prus∣sia's share brings him in near eight hundred thou∣sand. The usual division of the duchy is into the Anterior and Hinder Pomerania, which are separated by the Oder.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTERIOR POMERANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Anterior Pomerania belongs partly to Sweden and partly to the king of Prussia. The Swedish part comprehends several islands, of which Rugen is the chief, and a part of the continent. The isle of Rugen, which had its name from its an∣tient inhabitants the Rugii, is about thirty∣miles in length, and near the same extent in breadth, but much indented. It is very fruitful in corn and grass, breeds abundance of cattle, and is well supplied with fish; but has most of its fuel from the continent. On the peninsula of Tasmund is a lake, called the Black lake, from its fish, which are all black on the outside, but their flesh is white and very palatable. Rugen gives name to a principality comprehending most of the Swe∣dish Pomerania. Bargen and Garz are the only towns in it worth mentioning. The former, a small open town, lies fourteen miles north-west of Stralsund, in the centre of the island, contains a Lutheran convent for young ladies, and is the seat of the provincial court of justice, and like∣wise of a governor and superintendent. Here also the nobles hold their assemblies. Garz is a small town in the bailiwic of Bergen, which had an∣tiently a very strong fort or castle. The lesser islands lying about Rugen contain nothing re∣markable except that of Hiddensee, on which is a light-house. The principal places on the conti∣nent
<PB N="382" REF="3900"/>
of Anterior Pomerania belonging to Sweden, are</P>
<P>Stralsund, the capital of the Swedish Pomera∣nia, standing on the strait that divides the isle of Rugen from the continent, thirty-two miles north-east of Rostock, and sixty-six north-west of Stetin. It was formerly one of the principal Hanse-towns, and took its name from the Strait or Sunde, which lies between it and the little island of Danholm, antiently called Strela, and which was thence called Strel, or Stralsund. Here are many consi∣derable merchants. Here also the states of Swe∣dish Pomerania assemble, the governor-general resides, and the chief courts and offices are kept. The town is very strong both by nature and art, its trade very considerable, and its privileges and immunities great. It is so surrounded by the sea, and by lakes and marshes, that it is accessible only by bridges and causeways. Here is an excellent haven, by which ships come into the heart of the town, and from whence a great deal of corn and naval stores are exported. The town has been frequently besieged, particularly in 1678, by the elector of Brandenburg, when it was so furiously bombarded, that it surrendered the third day, when about eighteen hundred houses had been de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>Barth, a town situated on a small bay ten miles west of Stralsund, and seventy-three north east of Stetin. It gives name to a principality, con∣sisting of that part of the principality of Rugen which lies upon the continent, and has a harbour, but it is too shallow. A sort of beer is brewed in this place which is much valued; and in its neigh∣bourhood, at the village of Kenz, is a mineral water greatly frequented. It contains also a strong castle, and a seminary for ladies, founded in 1733.
<PB N="383" REF="3910"/>
The adjacent fields are very fruitful in all sorts of corn.</P>
<P>Damgard, an open town with a castle, not far from the Rekenitz.</P>
<P>Tribsees, a small town which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Grimm, or Grimmen, a small town not far from the former.</P>
<P>Franzburg, a small town giving name to a bai∣liwic. Here formerly stood an opulent abbey, called Niencamp.</P>
<P>Richtenberg, a town on the Trebel, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Gutzko, a small town giving name to a county, the counts of which were antiently vassals to the dukes of Pomerania.</P>
<P>Loitz, a small town giving name to a bailiwic, which was formerly a lordship.</P>
<P>Grieffswalde, a town nineteen miles south-east of Stralsund, and forty-six west of Stetin, at the bottom of a small gulph, over-against the isle of Rugen. It is a considerable town, well built, and fortified, with a good trade, great privileges, and a considerable revenue. Here is an university, the chancellor of which is governor of the Swedish Anterior Pomerania, together with a German so∣ciety, and a grammar-school. The three pastors of the town are also professors of divinity. In the neighbourhood are salt-springs, but no use is made of them for want of fuel. The town has a good harbour, with a great many ships belonging to it. Formerly it was imperial, and one of the Hanse-towns, and had two monasteries. Here are two yearly fairs on St. James's and All-Saints day.</P>
<P>Eldeno, or Eldena, a large village, where was formerly an abbey of Cistercian monks, whose
<PB N="384" REF="3920"/>
lands now form a bailiwic, belonging to the uni∣versity of Grieffswalde.</P>
<P>Lassan, a small town, situated on a lake of the same name, and giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Wolgast, a town not far from the river Peene, which now gives name to a county and lordship, as it did antiently to a duchy. Several dukes of Pomerania lie buried in its parish church. It stands about four miles from the mouth of the river, and has a pretty good trade.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRUSSIAN PART of ANTERIOR POMERANIA.</HEAD>
<P>In this part the principal places are,</P>
<P>Stetin, or Old Stetin, commonly reckoned the capital of all Pomerania, standing on an eminence near the Oder, seventy-four miles north-east of Berlin, a hundred and fifty-three west of Dantzick, a hundred and seventy east of Lubeck, and three hundred and twenty north of Vienna. It is a large handsome well fortified town, with a variety of manufactures, and a great trade. Here is the seat of the chief colleges and tribunals for the Prus∣sian Pomerania, of a college of physicians, a board of health, a chamber of commerce, and a court of admiralty, with a royal gymnasium, and a superintendency. Here also is a castle, an arsenal, a free-school, and a dock for building ships. The town enjoys great privileges and immunities, and though it stands forty miles from the sea, yet ships of good burden come up to the very walls, and the river is navigable for smaller vessels a great way above it. In 1659 it held out four months against the Imperialists, so that they were fain to raise the siege, and in 1677, five months against Frederic William elector of Brandenburg, who after a
<PB N="385" REF="3930"/>
prodigious expence of granadoes, bombs, ball, pow∣der, and other military stores, with the loss of eight thousand men, and after reducing the garrison from three thousand to seven hundred, was forced to grant a very honourable capitulation. The town is now so fortified by additional works, that it is reckoned one of the strongest places in Europe. A vast deal of corn, timber, linen, and naval∣stores are exported from hence. The prospect of the river, and the islands formed by it, and some hills in the neighbourhood, is very agreeable.</P>

There is a fort, called Peenemunder-Schanze, on the north point of the island, which commands the mouth of the Peene; and another called Swine-Schanze, on the south-east point, for the defence of the mouth of the river Swine, and the harbour. A part of this island was swallowed up by the sea in the eight or ninth century, with a town called Winera.</P>
<P>Wollin, a town in the island to which it gives name, standing near where the antient city Julin was situated, which, in the eleventh century, is said to have been one of the largest and most famous cities in Europe, and was at first the see of the bishopric, afterwards removed to Cammin; but by war, and fire was at last reduced to the pre∣sent town of Wallin. The island is about sixteen miles in circumference, and abounds in cattle, game, and fish, especially eels.</P>

<P>This principality was antiently the bishopric of Cammin, which at the peace of Westphalia was secularized, and given to the elector of Branden∣burg, by whom it was incorporated with the Hin∣der Pomerania. In 1669 it was made a principa∣lity of the empire, and as such, now intitles the king of Prussia to a seat and vote both in the diet of the circle, and that of the empire; his ma∣tricular assessment for it being one hundred and eighty-four florins monthly, and to the chamber of Witzlar eighty one rix-dollars, eleven kruitzers.

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of ANHALT.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded by Misnia on the south; by the duchy of Magdeburg, and the prin∣cipality of Halberstadt on the north and north-west; by the duchy of Saxony on the east, and Thuringia on the west. It is about sixty miles in length, and from twelve to eighteen in breadth. As the country is partly hilly, and partly cham∣paign, the air and soil differ considerably. On the hills the air is sharp and healthy, but in the levels, tho' the air is not so good, the soil is much better. In one or the other, however, the land yields wheat, barley, rye, hops, wine, tobacco, hay, fruit, and fine woods of oak, beech, poplar, elm, and limes.

Bude, the Fuhne, the Zitau, the Nuhte, and the Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zlau, which abound with fish, and the Mulde, in particular, yields salmon. On the Harz are mines of lead, copper, silver, and iron, together with sulphur, vitriol, alum, salt petre, coals, and other minerals. The whole principality has nine∣teen towns and two boroughs in it. The states, consisting of the nobility and the towns, are sum∣moned to the diets in the name of the four princes of the house of Anhalt, and generally meet where the eldest branch of the family resides. Christia∣nity was introduced here in the ninth century, and the reformation in the year 1521. The prince of Zerbst, with the greatest part of his subjects, are Lutherans; but Calvinism is the established reli∣gion in the territories of the other princes. The university at Zerbst belongs in common to the several branches of the house of Anhalt. The principality derives its name from the castle of Anhalt, the ruins of which are still to be seen not far from Harzgerode. Joachim Ernest II. who died in 1560, leaving seven sons be∣hind him, was the founder of all the present princes of Anhalt. Two of his sons dying with∣out heirs, and one living retired from the world, the other four divided their father's territories a∣mong them. The usual title at present of the four branches, viz. those of Dessau, Bernburg, Co∣then, and Zerbst, is, Princes of Anhalt, dukes of Saxony, Engern, and Westphalia, counts of As∣cania, lords of Bernberg and Zerbst. They have all but one vote in the diets of the empire and circle, which is delivered by the eldest branch, by whom also all matters of general concern are managed and directed: at the same time, each of the reigning branches has its particular courts and colleges. Their assessment to the army of the em∣pire, is nine horse and twenty foot, or one hun∣dred and eighty florins monthly, in lieu of them;
<PB N="393" REF="4010"/>
and to the chamber of Wetzlar, two hundred and forty-three six-dollars, forty-seven kruitzers. The revenue of the whole principality is estimated at between five and six hundred thousand six-dollars. We shall now mention the principal places in the several divisions of the country belonging to the different branches.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the PRINCIPALITY of COTHEN the most considerable places are,</HEAD>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ABBEY of QUEDLINBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This free imperial abbey, at the Reformation, embraced Lutheranism, and was secularized. It consists at present of four dignitaries, viz. of the lady abbess, and three others, distinguished by the names of provost, dean, and canon. The abbess is a princess of the empire, and has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle. The electors of Saxony were formerly patrons, or pro∣tectors of the abbey; but afterwards transferred their rights to the house of Brandenburg for three hundred thousand rix-dollars. No abbess, or other dignitary, is to be chosen without the know∣ledge and consent of the protector, who appoints certain officers to superintend the rights and privi∣leges both of the patron and abbey, together with a court of justice, and tax-office. All the digni∣taries must be at least baronesses, and prove their noble extraction for eight descents. They make no vows, and are under no restraints, both re∣ceiving and returning visits. They may even quit the abbey, if they have an inclination, and marry: and since the Reformation, some of the abbesses have been widows. Several princes hold fiefs of the abbey, the revenue of which, however, does not exceed five thousand pounds sterling per annum. In the territory belonging to it, which lies in the principality of Halberstadt, the only places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="4060"/>
Quedlinburg on the Bode, where the abbey is situate, and whence it takes its name. Here is a court of justice belonging to the abbey; the higher jurisdiction being the prerogative of the protector, and the lower of the abbess, who with her chapter live on a hill, near the town, at the cathedral of St. Servatius, in which Henry I. surnamed the Fowler, who founded the abbey, lies interred. There were formerly several convents in and near the town, as there are now several churches and hospitals, with a college, which was formerly a Franciscan cloister. In 937 the emperor Otho I. conferred the town and imperial palace on the abbey; but the former having afterwards put it∣self under the protection of the bishop of Halber∣stadt, and acceded to the Hans confederacy, was reduced again, in 1477, under the dominion of the abbess Hedwiga, by her brother the elector Ernest, and duke Albert of Saxony.</P>
<P>Ditfurt, a country town on the Bode, to which belongs a large wood called Ramberg.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ABBEY of WALKENRIED.</HEAD>
<P>This free imperial abbey, which stood at the town of that name, in the lordship of Klettenberg, and principality of Halberstadt, was founded in 1127, by Adelheida, consort to Volkmar, count of Klettenberg, for monks of the Cistercian order. It was possessed of several estates, farms, manors, pastures, waters, woods, mills, and other estates, in the towns of North-hausen, Goszlar, Got∣tingen, and Osterwick. At the peace of Westpha∣lia it was secularized, and assigned to the dukes of Brunswic and Luneburg, as an hereditary fief; and, in 1672, descended, by compact, to the prince of Brunswic Wolfenbuttel, who is still in posses∣sion of it as a bailiwic, paying an assessment to the
<PB N="399" REF="4070"/>
empire, and the chamber of Wetzlar, on account of it.</P>
<P>The only places in the bailiwic worth mention∣ing are, Walkenried on the Zorge, and the town of Zorge. In the last are two iron manufactures.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of SCHWARZBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality lies in Thuringia. The south part is separated from the north, and surrounded by the principality of Coburg, Altenburg, Eise∣nach, and the territory of Erfurt; as the north is by the circle of Thuringia, the electorate of Saxo∣ny, the counties of Stolberg, Hohenstein, and Eichsfelde, and the territory of the imperial town of Muhlhausen. In this principality are many fer∣tile spots, yielding all kinds of grain, fruit, and roots. Some places also yield tolerable wine, and others are covered with large forests, in which a great deal of timber is annually felled, and the greater part of it exported. These forests abound with game and venison, as the rivers and ponds do with fish. In this principality are also mines of silver and copper, salt springs, together with beautiful red and white alabaster. The principal rivers in the upper part are the Schwarze, which contains particles of gold, the Ilm, the Saale, and the Gera. In the lower are the Helme, the Zor∣gange, the Wipper, and the Helbe. The inha∣bitants, who are Lutherans, as well as their princes, are said to amount to about one hundred thousand. At present there are two branches of the house of Schwarzburg, viz. those of Sondershausen and Rudolstadt, both which have been raised to the dignity of princes of the empire, and have obtained both seat and voice at the diet in the col∣lege of princes. They have also the title of grand∣masters of the horse and huntsmen to the empire.
<PB N="400" REF="4080"/>
Their title runs thus: Princes of Schwarzburg, of the four counts of the empire, counts of Ho∣henstein, lords of Arnstadt, Sondershausen, Lau∣tenberg, Lohra, and Klettenberg. To a Roman month their assessment is two hundred florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar one hundred and thirty∣seven rix-dollars. Some of their lands are held as fiefs of the house of Saxony, to whom they pay an acknowledgment in money yearly, and to whose courts appeals lie from those of the principality. Both princes have their colleges, and officers civil and military. When the empire is engaged in a war, they furnish, together with the count of Reus∣sen, a regiment consisting of a thousand men. Besides the fiefs held of Saxony, there are others, which they hold of the empire, Bohemia, Mentz, Magdeburg, Hesse Cassel, the bishoprics of Fulda, and Sonnen-Lehen. In the territories belonging to the Sondershausen branch, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Arnstadt on the Gera, over which is a handsome stone bridge of six arches. On the same river also are some brass and iron works, with several mills, and a saltpetre-house, near the town, in which are two palaces belonging to the prince, several churches, and a public school. Arnstadt belong∣ed formerly to the dukes of Saxony, afterwards to the abbey of Hersfeld, and at last came, by pur∣chase, to the counts of Schawarzburg. It gives name to a lordship, which lies in the upper part of the principality, and is a fief of Saxe-Weimar.</P>

<P>Gehren, a market-town, with a palace belong∣ing to the prince, near the forest of Thuringia. It gives name to a bailiwic, the greatest part of which is an imperial fief, and contains several iron works, and saw-mills, besides two other market-towns, viz. Langewiesen and Breitenbach, both of which stand on the Ilm, the former being a fief of Mentz, and the latter containing a palace be∣longing to the prince. In the neighbourhood of the latter is also a mine, yielding sulphur, alum, and vitriol. In the same bailiwic likewise, at Go∣litzschthal on the Raheberge, near the Schwarze, are fine mine-works, with a stamping and sawing∣mill, a gold wash, and a straining-house. The lode is gold and silver ore.</P>
<P>Keula, a small town, which gives name to a bai∣liwic in the lower principality. Here begins a fo∣rest upwards of twenty miles in length, called Hainleute.</P>
<P>Scherenberg, an open town in the lower princi∣pality, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Sondershausen, a town on the Wipper. The prince, to whom it gives title, has a palace on an eminence without the town, in which he usually resides. The gardens and apartments of the pa∣lace are very fine. In the armory is an image of Pustrich, one of the Wendish idols, of a cast black shining metal. Its head, on which the right-hand rests, is large and disproportionate, with a hole in the top of it, its belly prominent and hollow. Instead of a mouth, there is a round hole. The legs are mutilated, and the right bent. The middle of the left-arm also, which rests on his lap, is broken off. This town is the seat of the prince's courts and offices, and gives name to a bailiwic, in which were formerly the castles of Jechaburg, and Spa∣tenberg;
<PB N="402" REF="4100"/>
the former of which was the residence of king Lewis VI. and the other was built by the emperor Henry IV.</P>

<HEAD>COUNTY of MANSFELD.</HEAD>
<P>This county has that of Stolberg, and the up∣per principality of Schwarzburg, on the west; the principality of Anhalt on the north; the duchy of Merseburg and Saxe-hall on the south; and part of Anhalt and Saxe-hall, with the river Saale, on the east, being about thirty miles from east to west, and about eighteen in breadth where widest. It is mountainous and woody, yet has some good corn land, vineyards, and pastures. There is also a salt-work in it, and a mine of a blackish glitter∣ing kind of slate, from which is extracted copper and silver, but in far less quantities than formerly, when a quintal of that slate yielded betwixt three and four pounds of copper, and a quintal of cop∣per ten or twelve ounces of silver. In the slate are lively representations, in fair copper-strokes, of fishes of several sorts, frogs, water-rats, and other animals. There are two considerable lakes in this county, one of which is salt, and the other fresh, tho' they are very near one another, and even com∣municate. Both abound with fish and water∣fowl. The principal rivers and streams are the Salze, the Schlenze, the Eine, and the Woyta, or Weita. In the whole country are seven towns. The inhabitants, for the most part, are Lutherans, under a general superintendent The house of Mansfeld is descended from Burkhard, who in 1219 was lord of Querfurt, count of Mansfeld and Hardeck, and burgrave of Magdeburg. Henry
<PB N="405" REF="4130"/>
Francis, in 1690, obtained from Charles II. king of Spain, the principality of Fondi, in the king∣dom of Naples; and in the same year was created a prince of the empire. The county is a fief, partly of Saxony and partly of Magdeburg, and is entirely subject to the jurisdiction of the lords∣paramount. That part under the sovereignty of Saxony hath been long under sequestration. Not∣withstanding the princes of Mansfeld are not at present entitled to a seat and voice in the diet of the empire; yet in the matricula the county is assessed in ten horsemen and forty-five foot, or three hundred florins monthly; and to the cham∣ber of Wetzlar contributes upwards of one hun∣dred rix-dollars. In that part under the sovereign∣ty of Saxony, which makes three fifths of the whole, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Eiszleben, the capital of the county, which is divided into the Old and New, lying fifteen miles north-west of Halle, and twenty south-east of Halberstadt. It is noted for the birth and death of the great reformer Luther, to whom the world is so much indebted for bringing light out of dark∣ness, by delivering a great part of it from the pa∣pal yoke, and the most deplorable superstition. It is said, that in a great fire, which in 1601 con∣sumed all the other houses about them, those wherein he was born and died, and the church wherein he was baptized, escaped the flames. Here is a castle belonging to the counts. The town is populous, being the centre of all the trade of the county, and a great thoroughfare. Many of the inhabitants are brewers.</P>
<P>Hettstadt, or Heckstedt, a town on the Wip∣per, whose privileges exceed those of any other town in the county. The mine-works lie not far from hence.</P>

<P>Gehofen, a market-town belonging to the Eber∣stein family, in the bailiwic of Artern. Besides the bailiwics we have mentioned, there are several others in this part of the county, but none of them contain any thing remarkable.</P>
<P>That part of the county under the sovereignty of Magdeburg, or Brandenburg, which consti∣tutes about two-fifths of the whole, not being se∣questered, yields to the prince about forty-thou∣sand rix-dollars per annum. The places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Mansfeld, a small town, situated in a thal or vale, which gives name to the town, to an old castle on a high rock above it, to a bailiwic, and the county.</P>
<P>Gerbstadt, a small town in the lordship, or bai∣liwic, of Friedeburg, where was antiently a Bene∣dictine runnery.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of STOLBERG.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Stolberg lies north of the lower county of Schwarzburg, east of Hohnstein, and west of Mansfeld, and is about twenty miles long, and twelve broad, exclusive of the bailiwics of Heeringen and Kelbra. Tho' it is part of the Harz, it affords good pasturage and corn-land, besides rich mines of copper and silver, black ala∣baster, many minerals, fine woods, and plen∣ty of game. Both the counts and their subjects are Lutherans. There are two towns in the coun∣ty, and twenty-eight parishes, under a superin∣tendent. The bailiwics of Heeringen and Kilbra are held jointly by the counts of Stolberg and the princes of Schwarzburg. The house of Stolberg is one of the most antient houses in Germany. It is divided into the two chief lines of Wernigerode and Stolberg: and these are again subdivided, the first into Wernigerode and Geder, of which Geder hath been raised to the dignity of a prince of the empire, and the latter into that of Stolberg-Stol∣berg, and Stolberg-Roszla. These counts, in the diets of the empire, belong to the college of the imperial counts of the Wetterau, having also a seat and voice in the diets of the circle. In the matricula of the empire, the county is assessed in eighty-four florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar
<PB N="408" REF="4160"/>
it contributes sixty rix-dollars eighty kruitzers. It is, for the greater part a fief of and under the so∣vereignty of Saxony. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Stolberg, situated on the Harz. It gives name to the whole county, and likewise to a bailiwic, belonging to the Stolberg-Stolberg line, who have a palace above the town.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of WERNIGERODE.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on the borders of the principa∣lity of Halberstadt, in the Lower Harz, and is a∣bout twelve miles in length, and nine in breadth. One part of it is level, and the other mountainous. Among the mountains is the great Brocken, or Blocksberg, in Latin Mons-Bructerus, reckoned by some the highest in Germany. The snow lies upon the northern parts of it almost the whole summer. The levels of this county are very fer∣tile in grain, pulse, fruits, roots, and flax, and the mountains yield a variety of berries, woods of fir and pine, with some oak and beech, venison, game, salt-petre, chalk, cobalt, lime-stone, free∣stone, marl, clay for earthen ware, lead, and iron; in which, together with the cattle, and manufac∣tures of the county, a great trade is carried on. The inhabitants are Lutherans, divided into twen∣ty-one parishes, under a superintendent. The county belongs to that branch of the counts of Mansfeld, which takes its title from it, and is a fief of the king of Prussia, as margrave of Bran∣benburg,

who shares with the count the revenue, jurisdiction, and other regalia. The revenue is very considerable, amounting to no less than fifty-thousand rixdollars per annum. The county is divided into six bailiwics, in which the places of most note are,</P>
<P>Wernigerode, which gives name to the county. On a mountain above the town stands a stately castle, the residence of the counts, adorned with a fine park, gardens, walks, stables, a summer-house, jewel-house, green-house, and other decorations, and containing a valuable library, and the ar∣chives of the family. The town consists of three parts, viz. the Old and New Towns, and the su∣burb of Noschenrode, in all which are upwards of eight hundred houses, and the whole may be laid under water by means of the Zillicher rivulet. To the corporation belong large woods, out of which the burghers are allowed timber for building, with a certain quantity of wood annually for fuel. The inhabitants are employed chiefly in brewing, dis∣tilling, and manufactures of cloth and woollen stuffs. Along the Zilliche, near the town, are several meal, oil, fulling, sawing, and other mills; and a little farther off, is a copper-mill, belonging to the corporation. The town gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Drubeck, a large handsome village, where is a foundation for six protestant ladies. The inhabi∣tants are the richest farmers in the country.</P>
<P>Ilsenburg, now a large open village on the Ilse, but formerly a walled town. The castle, which stands on an eminence, and has a large park, with a mansion house, in the last century was the resi∣dence of the Wernigerode line of the Stolberg family. In the village and its neighbourhood are a salt-petre-house, iron-works, sawing, flatting, oil, paper, and powder-mills, together with others for
<PB N="410" REF="4180"/>
clay and copper. Both the above places are in the bailiwic of Wernigerode. In the other bailiwics there is nothing remarkable, except a lead mine and colour-mill in that of Hasserode.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of BARBY.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on the Elbe, and is surrounded by Gommern, a Saxon bailiwic, the duchy of Magdeburg, and the principality of Anhalt. In 1695, the family of the counts of Barby failing in the person of count Augustus Lewis, the pro∣per county of Barby went to the electoral house of Saxony; Mulingen and Walther-Nienburg, to that of Anhalt-Zerbst, as a Saxon fief; and the lordships of Rosenburg and Egeln were annexed to the duchy of Magdeburg. In the proper county, which, at present, forms a part of the circular bailiwic of Wittenberg, the only place worth mentioning is that which gives name to it, viz. Barby, a small town near the conflux of the Elbe and Saale, and the seat of a superinten∣dency, under which are eight churches.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LORDSHIPS of the COUNTS of REUSSEN.</HEAD>
<P>These lordships form a part of the Vogtland, and, except the lordship of Gera, which lies se∣parate from the rest, are surrounded by the Saxon circles of the Erzgeberg, the Vogtland, and the Neustadt, the principality of Culmbach, the dio∣cese of Bamberg, the Saxon bailiwic of Saalfeld, the bailiwic of Leutenberg, the principality of Altenburg, and the bailiwic of Zeitz. The country is very hilly, but the hills not only yield plenty of wood, variety of herbs, game, and ve∣nison, with some corn, but are also rich in me∣tals
<PB N="411" REF="4190"/>
and minerals, as copper, iron, lead, silver, alum, &amp;c. In the lower parts are fine pastures, corn-lands, and herds of cattle; and the rivers, the principal of which are the Elster and Saale, abound in fish. The several lordships contain nine boroughs, three market-towns, two hundred and thirty-one villages, thirty-eight farms and estates belonging to the count, and seventy-five noble manors. Both the count and his people are Lu∣therans, and the principal manufactures carried on by the latter, are those of wool and iron. The counts of Reussen derived their origin from the antient Vogts, or advocates of the empire. The line of Reusz-Plauen, which is still in being, was founded by Henry the Younger, surnamed the Russian, from whom, most probably, is derived their present surname of Reusz. The line of Reusz-Plauen is divided into the senior and junior; the senior is subdivided into two branches, and the junior into three, and these again into others; so that there are no less than eight different branches at present of this family, and of these all the males bear the name of Henry, being distin∣guished by their respective numbers in the two principal lines. The lordships are fiefs of the crown of Bohemia, and arriere-fiefs of the empire. The Reussen family has a seat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle among the counts. Their matricular assessment, that for Kranichfeld being deducted, is eighty-eight florins monthly, and to the chamber of Wetzlar fifty-nine rix-dol∣lars, fifty-four kruitzers. Of the regiment of six companies furnished by them and the prince of Schwarzburg in time of war, their quota is two companies, which they constantly keep on foot in time of peace. The principal places in these terri∣tories are,</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="4200"/>
Greitz, a town on the Elster, in a valley en∣vironed with woods and mountains. The two branches of the senior line, or those of Upper and Lower Greitz, are jointly proprietors of this town, and have each a house and gardens in it. It con∣tains besides about four hundred and fifty houses, with a handsome church, Latin-school, and orphan-house; and has some woollen manufactures.</P>
<P>Zeulenroda, a town consisting of about three hundred and fifty houses, and having a manufac∣ture of stuffs and stockings, and an annual fair. Near it also is an alum-mine. The bailiwic in which it lies, together with that of Upper Greitz, belongs to the Upper Greitz line.</P>
<P>Burg, or Burgk, a castle standing on a high and steep rock, and belonging to the Under Greitz line, together with the bailiwic named from it, and that of Under Greitz. In the latter of these bai∣liwics is the market-town of Fraureuth, with iron∣works of various kinds, and ovens belonging to the prince; and in the former the market-town of Moschlitz and an alum mine-work.</P>
<P>Gera, a handsome little town, seated in a plea∣sant vale near the Elster, and giving title to a branch of the junior line, who are proprietors of it, and have a stately house in it. Here is also a gymnasium illustre, belonging to all the junior chief lines, with a woollen manufacture. Not only the town, but the lordship likewise, to which it gives name, with the town and bailiwic of Saal∣burg, are the property of the counts of Gera.</P>
<P>Schleitz, properly called Schlewitz, a conside∣rable town belonging to another branch of the junior line, to whom it gives title, and who have two seats near it. Schleitz has some woollen manu∣factures, and gives name to a lordship belonging also to the counts of Schleitz, except that part of it called the government of Reichenfels, of which
<PB N="413" REF="4210"/>
the greater part is subject to the collateral line of Kostritz. In this lordship are three market-towns, viz. Tanna, Gorgwitz, and Markt-Hohenleuben, in the second of which are iron-works. Some of the villages in the government of Reichenfels, are sub∣ject to the Upper Greitz line.</P>
<P>Lobenstein, a town seated on the Lemnitz, and containing about four hundred houses. This town gives title to a third branch of the junior line, to whom, with its lordship, it belongs, and who have two seats in it.</P>
<P>Hirschberg, a small town in the lordship of Ebersdorf, which, with the lordship, belongs to the Ebersdorf collateral branch of the counts of Lobenstein.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LORDSHIPS of the COUNTS of SCHONBURG.</HEAD>
<P>These lordships lie in the Erzgeberg circle of the margravate of Meissen, and contain fourteen towns, in which all sorts of manufactures flourish. The inhabitants are Lutherans, as are also the counts, except the descendants of Christian-Hen∣ry, of the Waldenburg line, who are Roman ca∣tholics. Frederic, lord of Schonburg, who died in 1383, was the founder of the present house of Schonburg, which is now divided into Schonburg-Waldenburg, and Shonburg Penigk. Both these lines were raised in 1700 to the dignity, the for∣mer of princes, and the latter of counts of the em∣pire, and both are subdivided into several branches. These counts have a seat, both in the diets of the empire and circle, among the counts. Their assess∣ment in the marricula of the empire is forty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar twenty-seven rix∣dollars, six kruitzers. The elector of Saxony is sovereign of all the lordships, the counts of Schon∣burg
<PB N="414" REF="4220"/>
being only reckoned in the first class of the states of that electorate. The principal places in them are,</P>
<P>Waldenburg, a small town on the Mulde, be∣longing, with divers others, to that branch of the family to whom it gives title. It contains a man∣sion-house of the counts, and is noted for its brown and white earthen-ware.</P>
<P>Hartenstein, a small town which gives name to a lordship, and title to another branch of the fa∣mily, who reside in it, and are proprietors both of the town and lordship.</P>
<P>Stein, a castle on an eminence near the Mulde, which gives title to another branch, to whom both the castle and its lordship belong. In the latter is another small town called Losznitz, which has a manufacture of cloth.</P>
<P>Lichtenstein, a palace or castle, which gives name to a lordship and town, and title to the counts, to whom they belong. In the lordship is another small town called Callenberg.</P>
<P>Glaucha, or Glauchau, a town situated on the Mulde, and belonging in common to the several branches of the Schonburg-Penigk line, who have a castle in it. The lordship also to which it gives name, with two other small towns, belong partly to the Remsa branch, and partly to the two other branches.</P>
<P>Remsa, a village which gives name to a lordship or bailiwic, and title to a branch of the counts, who are proprietors of it, and have a mansion-house in it.</P>
<P>Penigk, or Penig, a town on the Mulde, be∣longing, with its lordship, to that line to which it gives title, who have two seats in it.</P>
<P>Rochsburg, a small town on the Mulde, which, with its lordship, belongs to a branch of the Remsa
<PB N="415" REF="4230"/>
line. In this lordship are two other small towns, viz. Lunzenau, and Burgstadt, in the last of which are some stuff manufactures.</P>
<P>Wechselburgh, a small town near the Mulde, which, with its lordship, belongs to that branch of the counts to whom it gives title, and who have a seat in it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of HOHNSTEIN, with the LORDSHIPS of LORA and KLETTENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>These territories lie in Thuringia. Though some∣what hilly, they are fruitful in corn and grass, and abound in woods, cattle, deer, and all sorts of game. In several parts also are found iron-ore, with good alabaster and a kind of jasper. They contain five towns and two boroughs. The inha∣bitants are Lutherans, excepting a few Calvinists in the lordship of Lora and Klettenburg. The county of Hohnstein had formerly counts of its own; but the two branches into which they were divided became extinct, that of Hohnstein, Lora, and Klettenburgh in 1593, and that of Hohnstein Vierradt in 1609. The proper county is now di∣vided between the two chief lines of the house of Stolberg, and held as a fief of the electoral house of Brunswick-Luneburg. The most remarkable places in it are,</P>
<P>Hohnstein, a ruined castle, which gives name to the county, and a bailiwic. The bailiwic, with the towns of Hohnstein and Neustadt, in the last of which is a handsome seat, belong to the counts of Stolberg-Stolberg: but the forest of Hohnstein is the property of the counts of Stolberg Wernigerode.</P>
<P>Ilfeld a large village on the Behr, giving name to a bailiwic, belonging to the elector of Bruns∣wick-Luneburg, in which is a school well endowed
<PB N="416" REF="4240"/>
for six professors and a certain number of scholars. Twenty-four students are also maintained, at the universities of Gottingen and Ilfeld, out of the revenues of the foundation, and both they and the scholars are nominated, partly by the elector, and partly by the counts of Stolberg.</P>
<P>Bleichrode, a small but thriving open town in the lordship of Lora, which, with that of Klet∣tenberg, hath been incorporated with the prnci∣pality of Halberstadt, and belong to the iing of Prassia. The yearly revenue of both is com∣puted at about eighty thousand six-dollars.</P>
<P>Elrich a considerable town, situated in the lord∣ship of Klettenberg, on the Zorge. It is the seat of a superintendency, and has some manufactures. In the same lordship are also Sachsa, a small town in the forest of Harz; the ruined castle which gives name to the lordship, and a bailiwic; a flat∣ting and paper-mill; another for making gunpow∣der; together with Benneckstein, a small town, having iron mills; and Great-Bodungen, a market∣town on the Bode; both which, with their baili∣wics, belong to the counts of Schwarzburg.</P>
</DIV3>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>CIRCLE of WESTPHALIA.</HEAD>
<P>ANTIENTLY the people inhabiting between the Weser and the Rhine, were called West∣phalians, and hence that tract got the name of West∣phalia: but the circle of that name is of a larger extent, being surrounded by the circle of Burgundy, or the Austrian Netherlands, the United Provinces, and the North-Sea, with the circles of the Upper and Lower Rhine, and comprizing the following states,
<PB N="417" REF="4250"/>
viz. The bishopric of Paderborn, Munster, Leige, and Osnaburg; the duchy of Verden, the principality of Minden, the abbies of Corvey, Stablo, Werden, Cornelis Munster, Essen, Thoren, and Hervoden, the duchy of Cleve with the county of Mark; the duchies of Juliers and Berg, Nassau-Siegen and Nassau-Dillenberg, the principalities of East-Friesland and Mors; the counties of Sayn, Wied-Runkell, Schauenburg, Oldenburg, Delmenhorst, Lippe, Bentheim-Bentheim, Bentheim-Steinfurt, Teck∣lenburg, Hoya, Virnenburg, Diepholz, Spiegel∣berg, Rietberg, Pymont, Gronsfreld, Reckheim, the Seigniories of Anholt, and Winneburg; the county of Holzapfiel; the seigniories of Wit∣tem, Blankenheim, Geroldstein, Gehmen, Gym∣born and Neustadt, Wickerad, Mylendonk, and Reichenstein; the counties of Kerpen and Lom∣morsum; the seigniory of Schleiden, and the county of Hallermund, to which according to the usual matricula belong also the seigniories of Duck, Severn, Kniphausen, Keyl, Mechernich, Eisz, Schlenacken, Wylre, Richold, Dreysz, and Scho∣nau, together with the cities of Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, and Dortmund. That which is called the duchy of Westphali, shall be described under the archbishopric of Cologne, in the circle of the Lower Rhine.</P>
<P>The summoning princes and directors of the circle of Westphalia, are the bishops of Munster, al∣ternately with the electors of Brandenburg and Pa∣latine, as dukes of Cleve and Juliers. The archives belonging to it are kept at Dusseldorff. Its quota of men and money is somewhat more than the ninth part of the whole sum granted by the em∣pire. With respect to religion it is partly Pro∣testant, and partly Catholic; but the Protestants predominate, and are at least the greater part of them Calvinists. The air of this country is not
<PB N="418" REF="4260"/>
reckoned very wholesome, and towards the north is extremely cold in winter. The soil in general is marshy and barren; yet there is some good corn and pasture land: but the fruit is chiefly used to feed hogs; and hence it is that their bacon and hams are so much valued and admired. In all other respects it is certainly the most wretched part of Germany; so that it is commonly and justly said, that a traveller will find nothing in it but long miles, small beer, coarse bread, and the worst of lodgings. Nor is the character of the people, by all the accounts we have of them, much more amiable than their climate and soil; but this is not so much the effect of the cold barren coun∣try they inhabit, as of the tyranny and oppression of a multitude of petty princes, by whom they are cruelly fleeced and enslaved.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a particular description of the territories contained in this circle.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of PADERBORN.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric has the county of Lippe on the north and west; Hesse-Cassel and Waldeck on the south; and Munster, with the duchy of Westphalia, on the west. Its greatest length from east to west is about forty miles, and its breadth where widest thirty. Some parts of it yield good pasture, and breed abundance of cattle; but it is not very fruitful in corn. There is a heath called the Senne or Sende of great extent, but very bar∣ren and desolate. There are however good iron mines in the country, with salt and medicinal springs, plenty of deer and other game; and it is watered with several rivers abounding with fish, as the Weser, the Dimel, the Bever, the Nette, the great Emmer, the Lippe, the Alme, and the Pader. It contains fifty-four parishes, in which are twenty-five
<PB N="419" REF="4270"/>
market-towns, and sixteen monasteries. The Roman Catholic is the predominant religion of the country, yet there are also many protestants in it. The bishopric was erected by Charlemagne, to∣wards the close of the eighth century, and the ca∣thedral was consecrated by pope Leo in person, anno 796. The bishop is sovereign of the coun∣try, a prince of the empire, and suffragan of the archbishop of Mentz. His revenue is about thirty thousand pounds a year, and he is able to raise three thousand men. In the matricula his assess∣ment is eighteen horse, and thirty-four foot, or three hundred and fifty-two florins monthly, in lieu of them. Towards the charges of the so∣vereign courts of the empire, he pays for each term, a hundred and sixty-two rix-dollars and twenty-nine kruitzers. The chapter consists of twenty-four capitular canons, who must prove their noble extraction by four descents. The arms of the bishopric are a cross or, in a field gules. For the government of it and the administration of justice, there are several councils and colleges under the bishop. Here are also a hereditary mar∣shal, sewer, cup-bearer, chamberlain, steward, and purveyor. It was in this bishopric that Quintilius Varus, with the Roman army under his command, was routed by the Germans, under Arminius. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Padderborn, which gives name to the bishopric, and is its capital. It stands forty miles north-west of Cassel, fifty south-east of Munster, and sixty south-west of Hanover, being a large, populous, well built and well fortified city. Its name is compounded of Pader, a rivulet which rises just under the high altar of the cathedral, and born, i. e. a spring. It was one of the Hanse-towns, and till 1604, an imperial city. The cathedral is a grand fabrick, inferior to few in the empire. There is a gold crucifix in it
<PB N="420" REF="4280"/>
of sixty pounds weight, presented by Otho II. The university, of which the Jesuits have the direc∣tion, was founded in 1592, and the walls were built in the beginning of the eleventh century. In 1530 an attempt was made to introduce Lu∣theranism; but sixteen of the principal citizens who had embraced it were executed, and the rest obliged to abjure it. Duke Christian of Brunswic carried off from hence, in 1692, the silver images of the twelve apostles, and the silver coffin of St. Lotharius, and had them coined into money, with this inscription, <HI>God's Friend, the Priest's Ene∣my.</HI> The trade of this town, though formerly great, is now inconsiderable; and the inhabitants subsist mostly by agriculture, and breeding of cat∣tle. Though the bishop has a palace in the city, he resides (when he vouchsafes to visit this coun∣try, which is seldom, having other and more va∣luable benefices) at Neuhaus, seven miles off, where he has a magnificent castle. Charlemagne, and other emperors, sometimes resided here, and held diets of the empire.</P>
<P>Neuhaus, just mentioned, a borough, with a castle, which is the usual residence of the bishop when he is in the country.</P>
<P>Altenbecken, a village, near which is a spring, called Bullerborn, which ebbs and flows with a roaring noise, but yields sweet water.</P>
<P>Salzkotten, or Soltkott, a small town, so called from its salt springs. It has a seat at the land-diets.</P>
<P>Lichtenau, a small town, having a seat at the land diets.</P>
<P>Wunnenburgh, a small town, which has a seat at the land-diets, and took its name from a victory obtained here by Charlemagne over the Saxons.</P>
<P>Buren, a small place on the Alme, with a col∣lege of Jesuits; to which order both the town and seigniory belong.</P>
<P><PB N="421" REF="4290"/>
Warberg, formerly one of the Hanse, and an imperial city. It has a seat at the diets, and is the second in rank in the bishopric. Here a strong pa∣latable beer is brewed, and in the neighbourhood are mines of iron and lead.</P>
<P>Brakel, now a little town, but formerly an im∣perial city, seated on the Brucht.</P>
<P>Dringenberg, a small town, with a citadel, hav∣ing a seat at the land-diets.</P>
<P>Kleinenberg, Wilbassen on the Nétte, Kalen∣berg, Neheim or Niem, Borchholz on the Bever, and Peckelsheim, small towns, having seats at the land-diets.</P>
<P>Borrenrick, a small town, pleasantly situated. It is the fourth town in rank in the bishopric, and has a seat and voice at the land-diets.</P>
<P>Dryburg, a small place, having a seat at the diets. Near it is a spring of mineral water.</P>
<P>Steinheim, a little town, pleasantly situated on the Emmer, having a seat at the diets.</P>
<P>Beverungen, a small town, near the conflux of the Bever with the Weser. As ships can come up to it from the Weser, and there are some salt-springs in its neighbourhood, it is a thriving place.</P>
<P>Herstelle, which lies also on the Weser, but is not a place of any note.</P>
<P>Lude, which stands on the great Emmer, in the county of Piermont, but belongs to the bishop of Pa∣derborn. It is noted for its medicinal water, said to be a remedy for most distempers, and to have wrought such miraculous cures, that it is stiled, in the country, the holy well; but, among foreigners, commonly goes by the name of the Pyrmont water.</P>
<P>Oldenburg, on the river Honta, the capital of a county, which, with the town, is now possessed by the bishop, in common with the counts of Lippe. The town has a good trade by barges,
<PB N="422" REF="4300"/>
which come up from the Weser to the bridge; but the country is full of large heaths and marshes, in which are bred a small sort of cattle, and horses which are reckoned the best in Germany.</P>
<P>Stoppleberg, a small town, which, with its dis∣trict, or seigniory, belongs also partly to the bi∣shop, and partly to the counts of Lippe.</P>
<P>Swalenberg, a small town, which, with its dis∣trict, is held in the same manner.</P>
<P>Lippspring, which derives its name from its standing near the mouth of the Lippe, has a seat at the land-diets, and belongs to the chapter of Paderborn. It is customary for the popish inhabi∣tants of these parts to assemble once a year, each with a lighted taper, and, with their priests at their head, to repair to the woods and groves, to visit images and reliques, placed there in little chapels, which are seldom or never opened, but upon these occasions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BISHOPRIC of MUNSTER.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric has Embden and Oldenburg on the north, the county of Mark and duchy of West∣phalia on the south, the county of Bentheim and the United Provinces on the west, and the bishop∣rics of Osnaburg and Paderborn, together with the county of Ravensberg, on the east. It is the largest of all the Westphalia bishoprics, being in length about eighty miles, and in breadth from twenty to sixty. It is divided into thirteen baili∣wicks, and, though in general but a barren coun∣try, has some fruitful plains, with woods and quarries of stone: and the rivers, the chief of which are the Embs, the Lippe, the Vecht, and the Berkel, abound in fish. Great numbers of small black cattle are also bred in it. The provin∣cial diets are usually held at Munster, and consist
<PB N="423" REF="4310"/>
of the clergy, the nobility, and the deputies of cer∣tain towns. The inhabitants, except a few of the nobles and gentry, are all Roman catholics. Lu∣theranism had once got a considerable footing here, but was afterwards almost entirely suppressed. The bishop, who is generally also elector of Cologne, has a revenue from hence of about seventy thousand pounds, and can maintain eight thousand men. In consequence of an unjust custom, unknown in the rest of the empire, he is heir to all strangers who die in the country without children. In the matri∣cula he is rated at thirty foot, and an hundred and eighteen horse, or eight hundred and thirty two flo∣rins monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber∣court he pays, each term, four hundred and thirty-three rix-dollars, seventeen and an half kruitzers; and in spirituals is subject to the archbishop of Co∣logne, but at present is himself both bishop and arch∣bishop. His chapter consists of forty canons, who are all noble. The most considerable places in the bishopric are,</P>
<P>Munster, which derives its name from a mona∣stery built here by Charlemagne, and is the capi∣tal not only of the bishopric, but also of the circle, standing at the conflux of the river Aa with the Ems, thirty-seven miles south-west from Osnaburg, seventy north of Cologne, seventy eight north-west of Cassel, one hundred and five east of Am∣sterdam, one hundred and thirty-four south-west of Hamburgh, and about four hundred and fifty north-west of Vienna. It is of a circular form, large, and well fortified both by nature and art. The fine citadel, called the Brille, was erected by the famous bishop Bernard van Galen, to awe the burghers. The cathedral is a stately fabric. The dean and chapter now elect the bishop; but, till the be∣ginning of the thirteenth century, he was nomi∣nated by the emperor. This city has been render∣ed
<PB N="424" REF="4320"/>
famous by three remarkable transactions: first, By the peace concluded here in 1648, which put an end to a war of thirty years, occasioned by the persecuting spirit of bigotted papists, who chose rather to plunge their country into all the calami∣ties of war, than allow the protestants to worship God according to their consciences. By this peace, however, they consented, much against their in∣clinations, to grant them a toleration. Secondly, By the disorders and disturbances occasioned here in 1553, by a parcel of enthusiasts, called the Munster Anabaptists, who, headed by a taylor, called john of Leyden, from the place of his birth, turned out the magistrates, and took possession of the city, where they perpetrated the most horrid villanies and cruelties. After a long siege, during which both the city and country underwent the greatest calamities, the former was taken, and the mock sovereign, with some of his principal courtiers, were executed, and their bones hung in iron-baskets, on the top of the highest steeple in the city. Thirdly, For the noble, tho' unsuc∣cessful efforts it made in defence of its liberties, against the tyranny and usurpation of the above∣mentioned turbulent and bloody-minded bishop, Bernard van Galen. In this city, besides other public edifices, are a great number of convents, and other religious houses, many of them stately piles, and surrounded with beautiful gardens.</P>
<P>Beckum, a small town on the Werse, which has a seat at the land-diets.</P>
<P>Ahlen, another small town on the Werse, which also sends deputies to the diets of the bishopric.</P>
<P>Telget, a little town on the river Ems. It has a seat in the land-diets, and on the first of July is much frequented by pilgrims.</P>
<P>Warendorff, on the Ems, one of the best towns in the bishopric, having a seat in the land-diets, and a manufacture of fine linens.</P>
<P><PB N="425" REF="4330"/>
Werne, a small town not far from the Lippe, which sends deputies to the diets.</P>
<P>Coppenberg, a provostship of Praemonstraten∣sians, which is wholly independent of the bishop, and has several cloisters in the archbishopric of Co∣logne belonging to it.</P>
<P>Coesfeld, next to Munster, the greatest town in the whole bishopric, and formerly one of the Hanse.</P>
<P>Bocholt, a well built town on the Aa, having a seat at the diets, and in the neighbourhood a considerable iron-work.</P>
<P>Weerdt, a small town on the Issel, where the protestants enjoy the public exercise of their reli∣gion.</P>
<P>Meppen, a town and fort at the conflux of the Hase and Ems.</P>
<P>Vechla, a town and fort on a river of the same name.</P>
<P>Cloppenburg, a strong town, twenty-two miles north-east of Meppen.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are many other small towns and religious foundations in the bishopric; but having nothing remarkable, are not worth par∣ticularising.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of LIEGE.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is bounded to the north by Bra∣bant; to the south by Champagne and Luxemburg; to the east by Limburg and Juliers; and to the west by Brabant, Namur, and Hainault. It is very un∣equal both in length and breadth; the former being in some places above ninety miles, in others not half so much; and the latter in some places forty∣five, in others hardly twenty-five. The air here is very temperate, and the soil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pasture. Here also are mines of lead
<PB N="426" REF="4340"/>
and iron, pits of coal, quarries of marble and stone, and some celebrated mineral waters; as those of Spa and Chau-fontaine. The principal rivers are, the Maes and Sambre. The manufactures and commodities of the country, are chiefly beer, arms, nails, serge, leather, with the products we have just mentioned. The states of the bishopric are composed of three bodies: the first is the chapter of Leige; the second the nobility of the country; and the third, the deputies of the capital, and the other towns. The three estates are seldom called together, except to raise taxes for the service of the province, or upon some particular emergency; but there is a committee of the states, who meet thrice a week, and in time of war, daily. They are always about the prince-bishop, to make remonstrances, and demand the redress of grievances. The bishop is spiritual and temporal lord of the whole country; but, as bishop, is suffragan to the archbishop of Cologne. He styles himself by the grace of God, bishop and prince of Liege, duke of Bouillon, mar∣quis of Franchimont, count of Looz, Hoorn, &amp;c. His arms for Leige, are, a pillar argent, on a pe∣destal of the same, with a crown or, in a field ruby. In the matricula he was formerly rated at fifty horse, and one hundred and seventy foot, or one thousand two hundred and eighty florins monthly, in lieu of them, but now only at eight hundred and twenty-six. An abatement of one∣third has also been granted of the antient assessment to the chamber-court, which was three hundred and sixty rix-dollars sixty-two and a half kruitzers for each term. Here are several colleges which sit at Liege, for the government of the country, and the decision of causes, civil, criminal, spiritual, and feudal, and of such also as relate to the finances. The chapter consists of sixty persons, who must either prove their nobility for four genera∣tions,
<PB N="427" REF="4350"/>
both by father and mother, before they can be admitted; or if they cannot do that, must at least have been doctors or licentiates of divinity for seven years, or, of law, for five years, in some famous university. The bishopric is very popu∣lous and extensive, containing fifteen hundred parishes, in which are twenty-four walled towns, besides others, fifty-two baronies, besides coun∣ties and seigniories, seventeen abbies for men, who must be all gentlemen, and eleven for ladies, exclusive of others. The most considerable of these towns and places are,</P>
<P>Liege, the capital, from which the bishopric takes its name. It stands upon the Maes, in a fine valley, surrounded with woods and hills, being a free imperial city, and one of the largest and most eminent in Europe. Tho' it is one hundred miles from the sea by water, the Maes is naviga∣ble up to it. The city has sixteen gates, seven∣teen bridges, some of them very handsome, one hundred and fifty-four streets, many of them strait and broad, a fine episcopal palace, a very large, stately cathedral, in which, besides five great silver coffers full of reliques, are several silver statues of saints, and a St. George on horse-back of massy gold, presented to the cathedral by Charles the Bold, by way of atonement for using the inhabi∣tants cruelly in the year 1468. Of the other churches, that of St. Paul is the most remarkable, both for its structure and fine ornaments in paint∣ing and marble. The city is well fortified, and there are also two castles on the mountain of the Holy Wallburg for its defence. Besides a great number of other convents of both sexes, here is a college of English Jesuits, founded in the year 1616, and a fine nunnery of English ladies. In∣deed, churches, convents, and other religious foundations, take up the greater part of it. The
<PB N="428" REF="4360"/>
reader, therefore, no doubt, will take it for granted, that it is a most blessed, holy, and happy city. But however it may fare with the profane, unhallowed laity, it is certainly the paradise of priests, as it is expressly called, by way of eminence. It is di∣vided into the old and new, or the upper and lower, and the latter again into the island, and the quar∣ter beyond the Maes. The houses are high, and built of bluish marble. In the town and suburbs are twelve public places, or squares, ten hospitals, a beguin-house, and two fine keys, planted with several rows of trees, for the burghers to take the air; but a great part of that within the walls is taken up with orchards and vineyards. The ma∣nufactures of this city are arms, nails, leather, serge, and beer. In St. Williams's convent, with∣out the city, is the tomb of the famous English traveller, Sir John Mandeville, with an inscription in barbarous French, requesting those who read it to pray for his soul. Near it are kept the saddle, spurs, and knife, that he made use of in his travels. After having seen most of the cities of any note in the world, he made choice of this to spend the eve of his life in. A little way from the city, on the other side the Maes, stands the episcopal palace of Seraing, in which the bishops generally reside during the summer. The latitude of this city is fifty degrees thirty-six minutes, and the longitude five degrees forty minutes.</P>
<P>St. Tren, or St. Truyen, in Latin Fanum St. Trudonis, or Trudonopolis, so called from a rich lord of this country, who, in the year 657, founded the famous Benedictine abbey here, the abbot of which names one half of the magistrates of the place, and the bishop the other half. There are several other convents in this town both of nuns and friars.</P>
<P><PB N="429" REF="4370"/>
Viset, a small and well fortified town, on the Maes, seven miles from Liege.</P>
<P>Herstal, a borough with a castle, on the Maes, giving name to a seignory, which formerly be∣longed to the house of Nassau-Orange; but, on the death of king William III. fell to the king of Prussia, who sold it to the bishop of Leige.</P>
<P>Borchloen, a small town giving name to a county, and standing about fifteen miles from Maestricht.</P>
<P>Tongeren, an antient town on the little river Jecker, ten miles from Maestricht and two from Liege. It derives its name from the Tongri, otherwise called Eburones, whose capital it was. Here at first was the see of the bishop of Liege, which was removed afterwards to Maestricht, and then to Liege. In the neighbourhood is a famous mineral water, which Pliny takes notice of in his Natural History, book 31. chap. 2, and says that it purges the body, cures tertian agues, discharges gravel, and, when put upon the fire, turns thick and red. Some remains of antiquity are still to be seen here.</P>
<P>Hoorn, a small town with a castle, near the Maes, but the capital of a county, which, on the extinction of the male line of its counts, in 1568, reverted to the bishopric of Liege, of which it was a fief.</P>
<P>Franchimont, a small town about six miles from Liege, which gives name to a marquisate, con∣ferred on the church of Liege in 908, by the emperor Lewis.</P>
<P>Verviers, a small town on the river Weze, which has a considerable woollen manufacture, and a seat in the provincial diets.</P>
<P>Spaw, or Spa, a small town on the little river Weze, twenty miles from Liege, towards the fouth-east. It is so surrounded with mountains, that one can hardly see it till one is in it, nor get
<PB N="430" REF="4380"/>
to it without a good deal of trouble. This place is famous for its mineral springs, which are re∣sorted to from all parts of Europe, in the months of June, July, and August, and are said to open obstructions, concoct cruidities, dry up excessive moisture, and to strengthen the nerves and bowels, provided they are properly used. Prodigious quantities of the waters are transported into fo∣reign countries. There are five wells, but of these only three are much used, of which one is in the market-place, and the other two a little way out of the town. The company walk in the Ca∣puchins gardens, which are very large. The town, which consists of about four hundred houses, de∣pends entirely upon letting lodgings, and selling snuff-boxes and other trinkets to the company. The inhabitants are very good natured, and speak a barbarous French, as at Liege. In the hottest war, this town is considered as neutral, and pro∣tected from all hostilities. The neighbouring country is mountainous and woody, and conse∣quently not very fruitful in corn.</P>
<P>Huy, the capital of the country of Condres, twelve miles from Liege, where the little river Hoioul falls into the Maes. This town and dis∣trict were given to the bishopric of Liege in the year 997. Here is a collegiate church, with ab∣beys and convents of almost every order. That of the Cistercian nuns, three miles from the town, was founded in the year 1202 by Albert, count of Molra, who laid out all his wealth in founding of convents and other religious uses, after he had lost his two sons, who killed one another with their lances, while they were practising in imita∣tion of the combatants at tournaments. Another of the convents here, is the chief of the order of the Holy Cross, in which the general of that order is obliged to reside. This city has suffered very
<PB N="431" REF="4390"/>
much by the wars of the Netherlands, having been often besieged and taken, and its fortifications de∣stroyed. On the river Hoioul, near the town, are several paper-mills and iron-works, and also a mi∣neral spring. The neighbouring country yields not only corn, wine, and other fruits, but also iron, alum, sulphur, and coal.</P>
<P>Dinant on the Maes, ten miles from Namur, and thirty-four from Leige. The trade carried on here is chiefly in leather, and brass and iron manufactures. Near the town are some fine quar∣ries of black, black and white, and red and white marble. Most of its fortifications have been de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>Cuivin, a small town on a hill, near what is called the Blackwater. It had formerly a strong citadel, now in ruins. In its district or cas∣tellany, are eight large villages and some iron∣works.</P>
<P>Thuin, on the river Sombre, fifty miles from Liege to the south-west. It is but a small town, but has a fine collegiate church, and some con∣vents.</P>
<P>Hasselt on the Demer, a small town, but one of the prettiest in the whole principality of Liege.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of OSNABURG.</HEAD>
<P>This bishopric is situated in the centre of the circle, between the Weser and the Ems, having Minden on the east, Munster on the west, Diepholt on the north-east, and Ravens∣burg on the south-west. It is about forty-five miles long and twenty-five broad, producing
<PB N="432" REF="4400"/>
some rye, several sorts of turf, coals, marble, and good pasturage. The inhabitants, who are a mixture of protestants and Roman catholics, breed a considerable number of cattle, especially hogs, of which they make excellent bacon and hams; but a great part of the country consists of heaths. By the treaty concluded here in 1648, the bishopric was to be an alternative between the Roman catholics and Lutherans; and the Luthe∣ran bishop was to be a younger prince of the house of Brunswic-Lunenburg, or, on failure thereof, of Brunswic-Wolfenbuttle. In consequence of this settlement, his Britannic majesty's second son, a child not quite five years old, is now bishop of Osnaburg. The Roman catholic bishop is chosen by the chapter, consisting of twenty-five canons, who are not limited in their choice to any particu∣lar popish family. The revenues of twenty-two of the prebends belong to the popish canons, and those of the other three to Lutherans, who are ca∣pable of electing, but not of being elected bishops, as the Roman catholics are. The bishop is able to raise two thousand five hundred men, his revenue being between twenty and thirty thousand pounds. The chief manufactures of the country are a coarse kind of linen cloth and yarn, which are said to bring into it, annually, above one million of rix-dollars. There are also some woollen manufactures in Osnaburg and Bram∣sche. The land-states of the bishopric, are the chapter, the knights, and the four towns. The diets are held at Osnaburg, when called together by the bishop. The count of Bar is hereditary seneschal or steward, and president of the college of knights. About six thousand, it is said, of the poor peasants, called Haverlings, go yearly to Holland, where they mow, till, cut turf, &amp;c. and bring home with them about two hundred thousand
<PB N="433" REF="4410"/>
florins; but many of the peasants are subject to servitude, and belong partly to the chapter and popish clergy, partly to the nobility, and partly to the burghers. The arms of the bishopric are an orb gules, set with six spokes, in a field argent. The bishop is a prince of the empire, and, in the matricula, is rated at six horse and thirty-six foot, or two hundred and sixteen florins, monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber of the empire he con∣tributes, each term, eighty-one rix-dollars, fourteen kruitzers and a half. Under the bishop and chap∣ter are several colleges, for the government of the country, and the administration of justice in civil, criminal, feudal, and ecclesiastical causes, and for what relates to the finances. At the yearly land∣diet, a voluntary donation out of the cash belong∣ing to the foundation, is granted to the bishop, which, ever since the year 1729, has amounted, one year with another, to about one hundred thou∣sand rix-dollars, besides the ordinary taxes. The epis∣copal demesne lands yield, one year with another, about forty thousand rix-dollars. The revenues of the chapter, who are all nobles, are computed at between ninety and a hundred thousand rix∣dollars. The chief places in this bishopric are,</P>
<P>Osnabrug, or Osnabruck, the capital. It was formerly an imperial city, and one of the Hanse∣towns, but is now subject to the bishop, though it still enjoys many privileges, and a revenue of about eight or nine thousand rix-dollars. It has its name from a bridge over the river Hase, or Ose, which divides it into the Old and New Town, and stands sixty-seven miles west of Hanover, and thirty north-east of Munster, being surrounded with walls and ditches, but command∣ed by a mountain within cannon-shot. In the hall of the town-house, where the celebrated peace of 1648 was concluded, are to be seen the pictures
<PB N="434" REF="4420"/>
several of the plenipotentiaries, who assisted at it. Here likewise are preserved, as curiosities, three of those large gold coins, which were distributed by the Anabaptists in the year 1534, among their followers. The magistracy of this city, which is re∣chosen yearly on the second of January, is Lutheran, and the churches belong, some to the Lutherans, and some to the Papists. There are several convents both of nuns and friars, in and about the town, and two gymnasiums or academies, one for the Lu∣therans, and the other for the Roman catholics. The cathedral belongs to the papists, and contains a treasure of reliques, some of which are worth see∣ing. No popish processions are allowed here. Both parties have the full and free exercise of their religion, whether the bishop is protestant or pa∣pist. The bishop's palace was built by bishop Ernest-Augustus, brother to king George I. It is well fortified, and separated from the town by a bridge. In one of the apartments of it died king George I. in the arms of his brother, on the 11th of June 1727. This was the first town in Westphalia, which received the Lutheran doctrine. A regi∣ment of soldiers is generally quartered in the town, which, among other privileges, has that of coin∣ing copper, of regulating the police, of trying criminals, and of fortifying the town, as they think proper. Besides the public buildings alrea∣dy mentioned, here are several hospitals, together with a house of correction, a Jesuits college, and commandery of the Tuetonic order. The inha∣bitants are very industrious in brewing, making linen, and breeding hogs, and other cattle. In the treasure of the cathedral is a thin folio, with the portraits of many of the bishops, drawn with a pen by George Berger.</P>
<P>Iburg, a borough on the declivity of a hill, with a castle, in which the bishops used formerly to
<PB N="435" REF="4430"/>
reside. This town is the capital of a district, con∣taining sixteen parishes, twelve of which are Ro∣man catholic. In that of Oesede is a paper-mill, and, near a Benedictine nunnery, a tall-lime-tree, under which the land-diets of the bishopric were held till the year 1649. On the farm of Rothen∣feld, in the parish of Dissen, a salt-spring was dis∣covered in 1724, which bishop Ernest-Augustus, after purchasing the farm, caused to be secured and fenced.</P>
<P>Furstenau, a small town, containing a house in which the bishops formerly resided, and giving name to a district, consisting of fifteen parishes. In that of Borstel is a noble foundation for ladies of the Lutheran persuasion, only two of the prebends belonging to the papists.</P>
<P>Quackenbrug, a small town on the Hase. Here is a Lutheran and a popish church. The revenues of the college of canons, which was formerly in this town, are now divided between both religions: but one of the Lutheran canons of Osnabrug is always provost of Quackenbrug.</P>
<P>Vorden, a borough, which has a burgher∣master and council of its own, with a church, com∣mon to both religions.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of MINDEN.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded to the south by the county of Ravensberg, to the north by those of Diepholt and Hoya, to the west by the bishopric of Osnabrug, and to the east by the county of Schaumburg. It is, in general, fruitful in corn,
<PB N="436" REF="4440"/>
especially in wheat and barley; being also well fur∣nished with salt, flax, turf, wood, and coal; and in its meadows and pastures are bred abundance of cattle. As to its extent, it is about twenty miles from east to west, and twenty-five from north to south. Before the year 1648 it was a bishopric, but was then secularized, and given to the elector of Brandenburg, for what he had parted with in Pomerania. The provincial states here are the chapter of Minden, the prelates and knights, with the towns and boroughs. In the matricula, this principality is rated at ten horse and sixteen foot, or one hundred and twenty-two rix-dollars sixteen gross groshen, monthly, in lieu of them. Towards the expence of the chamber-court, its quota is, fifty-four rix-dollars twelve kruitzers, each term. The high colleges here, for the diffe∣rent departments of government, are, the regency, with the boards of war and domains. The ma∣gistrates of health in times of any infectious distem∣per among men or cattle, make the necessary pro∣visions, and the provincial medical board take care, that the country be provided with skilful physi∣cians, apothecaries, surgeons, and midwives. The trade of the principality consists in cattle, coarse linen and yarn, buckram, a kind of half linen and woollen stuff, corn, brewing, distilling, sugar-baking, and soap boiling. Here, as in o∣ther districts of the circle of Westphalia, are bonds∣men, who are subject, in a great measure, to the will of their lords. The most considerable places in this principality are,</P>
<P>Minden, the capital, a neat, well fortified town on the west side of the Weser, thirty-seven miles west of Hanover, and fifty north-east of Munster. It was once an imperial city, and one of the Hanse. A considerable trade is carried on here, chiefly by the Weser, in corn, cattle, beer, and stockings.
<PB N="437" REF="4450"/>
Charlemagne made this town the seat of a bishop∣ric, which was secularized at the treaty of Munster. The inhabitants being partly pro∣testant, and partly popish, the churches are divided between them; but the cathedral belongs to the Roman catholics. The chapter, however, con∣sisting of eighteen persons, is partly Roman catho∣lic, and partly Lutheran; as is also that of St. Martin, consisting of nine persons. Tho' the town is well fortified and garrisoned, it cannot be said to be strong, being commanded by a neighbouring hill. Here are several cloisters, and a gymnasium, with an orphan, correction, and work-house, and several alms-houses. In the year 1026, the em∣peror Conrad II. held a diet of the empire in this town.</P>
<P>Lubbecke, a town well fortified, and having a good trade in cattle, linen, yarn, beer, and spirits. Most of the inhabitants are Lutherans. The ma∣gistracy have both a civil and criminal jurisdiction in the town and its district. Here are a great many gentlemen's seats, a sugar-house, a school, alms-house, and a kind of chapter, consisting of a dean and four canons.</P>
<P>Hausberge, the capital of a district, to which it gives name. Here is a castle, a royal brewery, and distillery, together with a royal farm, and three vassals seats. In 1722 it obtained the privi∣leges of a city, and a magistracy.</P>
<P>Petershagen, a small place, which in the year 1722 obtained the privileges of a town. Here is an old castle, and a Lutheran church, with a brew∣ery and distillery. The inhabitants apply them∣selves not only to agriculture and the breeding of cattle, but also to spinning and weaving.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of VERDEN.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the south by the county of Hoya, by the duchy of Bremen to the north, by Lunenburg to the east, and to the west by the Weser, which parts it from the duchy of Bre∣men. Its length is about twenty-two miles, and its breadth eighteen. The soil of the duchy is in ge∣neral but poor, consisting mostly of heath, with some mar-shland and forests. The river Wumme traverses it from east to west, and the Weser and Aller run along its borders. The land-states of this bishopric consist of the nobility, and the town of Verden. The inhabitants are Lutheran-pro∣testants, and ecclesiastical affairs, as elsewhere amongst the Lutherans, are managed by a consis∣tory and superintendents. This bishopric was se∣cularized at the treaty of Westphalia, and given to Sweden. The Danes possessed themselves of it in the year 1712, and in 1715 ceded it, together with Bremen, to the electoral house of Brunswic Lunenburg. This cession was confirmed in 1719 by the crown of Sweden. His Britannic majesty, as duke of Verden, has a seat among the princes at the diets of the empire, and those of the circle. He is rated, in the matricula, at five horse and fifteen foot, or one hundred and twenty florins, monthly, in lieu of them; and to the chamber-court, each term, pays eighty-one rix-dollars, fourteen and a half kruitzers. The same regency serves both for the duchies of Bremen and Verden. The chief places in the latter are,</P>
<P>Verden, which gives name to the duchy, and is its capital. It stands on the Aller, which is navi∣gable to it, twenty-six miles south-east of Bremen, and above fifty south-west of Hamburgh. Ver∣den was once an imperial city, strong and popu∣lous;
<PB N="439" REF="4470"/>
but is now much declined. Besides the ca∣thedral, there are three other churches, and a Latin school.</P>
<P>Rotenburg, a borough or small town on the Wumme, fifteen miles north of Verden, where was antiently a noted castle or palace, belonging to the bishop. It is a place of some trade, and pretty populous.</P>

<HEAD>The ABBEY of CORVEY.</HEAD>
<P>This abbey, or principality, has Paderborn on the south and west, on the east the duchy of Bruns∣wic, from which it is separated by the Weser, and on the north the same duchy, and the district of Swalenberg. It is but of small extent. That part of it which lies on the Weser, is good corn land, but the rest is woody and mountainous. The Benedictine abbey here was founded by the emperor Lewis I. and the first monks having been taken from the abbey of Corbie in Picardy, it was called New Corbie, or Corvey. The ab∣bot is a prince of the empire, and has a seat in the college of princes, at the diets of the empire, and circle. His assessment in the matricula is two horse and nine foot, or sixty florins, monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber-court, each term, he pays one hundred and eighty six-dollars twenty and a half kruitzers. His revenues amount to between thirty and forty thousand florins. The hereditary officers are a marshal and cupbearer. The only places worth mentioning in this district are,</P>
<P>The abbey of Corvey, in Latin, Corbeia nova, standing on the Weser, near the town of Hoxter, or Hoxar. This abbey has produced several learn∣ed monks and bishops, among others Wittekind, the famous Saxon historian.</P>
<P><PB N="440" REF="4480"/>
Hoxter, a considerable town on the Weser, four miles from Corvey, partly imperial, and part∣ly subject to the abbot, who is under the protec∣tion of the duke of Brunswic Wolfenbuttle. Some trade is carried' on here by the Weser. Near the town stood antiently a very strong castle of the Saxons, called Brunesberg.</P>
<P>Stadtberg, a small town on a mountain, near the river Dimel. Here is a provostship, to which belong the provostships of the mountain of St. James, in the bishopric of Paderborn, and that of Meppen, in the bishopric of Munster.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ABBIES of STABLO and MAL∣MEDY.</HEAD>
<P>The territory belonging to these abbies is sur∣rounded by the duchies of Luxemburg and Lim∣burg, and the bishopric of Liege. The abbies were founded by St. Remaclus, towards the mid∣dle of the seventh century, and have but one ab∣bot, who is elected by the monks of both. Yet Stablo has long claimed a superiority, to which the other will not submit. The abbot is a prince of the empire, and has a seat, as such, at the diets of the empire, and those of the circle. He is also count of Logne, and, within his own territories, a sovereign prince. In the matricula he is rated at two horse and twenty-two foot, or, in lieu of them, at one hundred and twelve florins, monthly. To the chamber court he pays, each term, eighty-one six-dollars, fourteen and a half kruitzers. His an∣nual revenues are computed at about twenty-four thousand florins. In spirituals, the cloister of Stablo is subject to the bishop of Liege, and that of Malmedy to the archbishop of Cologne. The only places in this territory worth mentioning, are those from which the cloisters take their names, viz. Stablo and Malmedy. The first is a good
<PB N="441" REF="4490"/>
trading town, in a valley, on the little river Amb∣lêve. The other also carries on a good trade, and stands on the Richt, which falls into the Amblêve.</P>

<HEAD>The ABBEY of WERDEN.</HEAD>
<P>The district belonging to this abbey lies in the county of Mark. It was the estate of St. Ludger, who founded the abbey, about the year 778, for monks of the order of St. Benedict. The abbot has a seat at the diets of the empire. on the Rhenish bench of prelates, but at those of the circle, among the princes. In the matricula, he is rated at two horse and six foot, or forty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them, and to the chamber-court, each term, he pays eighty-one six-dollars, fourteen and one half kruitzers. The revenue of the abbey is above twen∣ty thousand six-dollars. The king of Prussia, as count of the Mark, claims the rights of sovereignty over the foundation. The only place in the terri∣tory worth mentioning, is that which gives name to it, and the abbey, viz. Werden, a small walled town, on the Roer, where, besides the abbey, is a Lutheran church.</P>

<HEAD>The ABBEY of St. CORNELIS MUNSTER.</HEAD>
<P>The territory of this abbey is surrounded by the duchies of Juliers and Limburg, and the district of the town of Aix la Chapelle. The abbot has a seat at the diets of the empire, on the Rhenish bench of prelates, but at those of the circle, he sits among the princes. In the matricula, his assessment is twelve foot, or forty-eight florins, monthly. To the chamber-court, each term, he pays one hundred and twenty-six six-dollars, twenty-one kruitzers. The abbey is under the protection of the elector
<PB N="442" REF="4500"/>

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ABBEY of ESSEN.</HEAD>
<P>The territory of this abbey is surrounded by the duchies of Berg and Cleves, the counties of Mark and Recklinkhusen, and the abbey of Werden. The abbey, which is of the order of Benedictines, was founded in the year 877, by Alfred, bishop of Hildesheim. The king of Prussia as duke of Cle∣ves, and count of the Mark, is hereditary vogt or protector of this abbey, which has great privi∣leges; the abbess stiling herself princess of the holy Roman empire, and lady of Breysich, Rel∣linghausen, and Huckarde, and the chapter con∣sisting of princesses and countesses. The abbey has a seat in the diets of the empire and circle, and is rated in the matricula, at two horse and thirteen foot, or seventy-six florins, monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber-court, its proportion, each term, is one hundred and sixty-two six-dollars, twenty∣nine kruitzers. Its hereditary officers are, a mar∣shal, a steward, a sewer, and chamberlain. The only place of any note in the territory is that which, gives name to it, and the abbey, viz. Essen, which claiming to be an imperial city, after an expensive process, was adjudged, by the chamber-court of the empire, to be subject to the abbess as its sovereign, but with very ample privileges and immunities, such as the entire civil and criminal jurisdiction within the town and its liberties, (re∣serving only an appeal to the imperial aulic cham∣ber) the levying of assessments, the free exercise of religion, &amp;c. The magistracy of the town is Lutheran, and the king of Prussia its protector. It

<P>This abbey, which was erected about the year 1000, and lies in the bishopric of Liege, and county of Hoorn, is an imperial free secular foundation, with a seat at the diets of the empire and circle, and in the matricula is rated at one horse, or twelve florins, monthly, in lieu of them. The chapter consists of princesses and countesses, of the order of St. Benedict.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ABBEY of HERFORD.</HEAD>
<P>This abbey, which was erected towards the end of the eighth century, stands in the county of Ravens∣berg, and the town of Herford, or Hervorden. The abbess has the tittle of princess and prelatess of the holy Roman empire, and a seat at the diets of the empire, and circle. In the matricula she is rated at two foot, or eight florins monthly. Her assessment to the imperial aulic chamber, is eighty∣one rix-dollars, fourteen kruitzers and a half. The foundation is Lutheran, and the canonesses, of whom the abbess may admit any number she pleases, are all of noble birth. The abbess is also superior of the collegiate church of St. Mary, situated on the mountains opposite to Herford, and erected in the eleventh century, all the prebends of which are in her gift. The canonesses of Herford wear a scarlet ribbon with a silver border, hanging from the right shoulder, and having a cross at the end of it, on which is the figure of the Virgin Mary
<PB N="444" REF="4520"/>
and the child Jesus, with this inscription, <HI>Meminisse et imitari.</HI> On their left breast also is a star, with the representation of the Virgin and the child Jesus. The revenue of the abbess is reckoned at about six thousand rix-dollars yearly, but that of the canonesses is inconsiderable.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of CLEVE.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded by Munster on the east, Gelderland on the west, Zutphen on the north, and Juliers on the south. It is about forty miles in length from north to south, and fifteen in breadth from east to west. In general, it is a very pleasant fertile country, well cultivated, and well watered by several rivers, abounding with fish; of which the principal are the Rhine, the Roer, the Emser, the Lippe, and Issel. The Maes also touches up∣on a part of the duchy. To guard the meadows and low grounds against the inundations of the Rhine, strong dykes have been erected, to the height of between eleven and sixteen feet. The duchy abounds in corn, fruits, game, black cattle and horses. There are many delightful spots in it, especially about the town of Cleve. The land diets consist of the nobility, and the deputies of the towns. Tho' the inhabitants are mostly Ro∣man catholic, yet the protestants and Jews enjoy the free exercise of their religion. The inhabitants of all sorts are much addicted to trade; for which the Rhine and Maes affords them great conve∣niencies and encouragement. In the duchy are twenty-four towns with three boroughs, a great number of religious houses, several collegiate churches, and commanderies. By the treaty of partition between the families of Brandenburg and Neuberg, this duchy, and the counties of Mark and Ravensberg, were assigned to the former, and
<PB N="445" REF="4530"/>
Juliers and Berg, with the territory of Ravenstein, to the latter. The voice of Juliers, Cleve, and Berg, in the diet of the empire, has been dormant ever since the death of duke John-William. The king of Prussia, on account of Cleve and the Mark, is rated at one thousand and sixty-six florins monthly, and at one hundred and forty-two for Ravensberg. To the aulic chamber he pays, each term, for these countries, six hundred and seventy-six rix-dollars, twenty-six kruitzers. The government of them, under the king, is vested in the royal regency, the war and domain chamber, and the provincial council, to which several courts of judicature are subordinate. The revenues of Cleve and the Mark, including the domains, are computed at about seven hundred thousand rix-dollars. Of the former, which is divided into three circles, the following are the most re∣markable places:</P>
<P>Cleve, the capital, so called from its situation on a declivity, stands between the Rhine and the Maes, sixty miles from Cologne, sixty-four from Amsterdam, and fifty-five from Munster. It is the seat of the sovereign colleges and judicatories, and, tho' small, is neat and populous. From the castle, which stands on a hill, and the Swan tower, there is a charming prospect of the neighbouring country, and of the Rhine at three miles distance. Here are several churches belonging to the pro∣testants, a popish collegiate church, two mona∣steries, and a nunnery. The governors of the duchy, and the magistrates of the city, are Calvi∣nists. There is a fine park on the west side of the city, and, on the east, a wood, in which is prince Maurice of Nassau's house, with his monument, a noble collection of antiquities, and a pheasantry. Near the town also is a high hill, called Sternberg, with a wood on the top of it, cut into walks,
<PB N="446" REF="4540"/>
from whence may be seen Utrecht, tho' fifty miles off, with forty other cities and great towns. A silk manufacture was erected here in 1755. This duchy had long counts and dukes of its own, whose residence was in the castle, which is said to have been founded by Julius Caesar, and has very fine apartments.</P>
<P>Calcar, a small town, which has a seat and voice at the provincial diets.</P>
<P>Cranenburg, a small town, with a Roman ca∣tholic collegiate church.</P>
<P>Gennep, a small town, on the river Niers.</P>
<P>Udem, a small town, pleasantly situated in the circle of Cleve.</P>
<P>Goch, a small town on the river Niers, which antiently belonged to the dukes of Gueldres, but, in the year 1473, was ceded to the duke of Cleve.</P>
<P>Xanten, a small town, thirteen miles from Cleve. Here is a great church, in which are a∣bundance of reliques, thirty fine altars, the gos∣pel-history exquisitely carved in wood, a miracu∣lous image of the Virgin, and, as the priests say, a manuscript by St. Paul's own hand.</P>
<P>Buderick, or Burich, a small town seated on the Rhine, opposite to the mouth of the Lippe.</P>
<P>Wesel, the largest town of the duchy, standing on the east side of the Rhine, near the mouth of the river Lippe, about eighteen miles from Cleve. It was once an Imperial and Hanse-town, and has still great privileges, though it acknow∣ledges the king of Prussia for its sovereign. The town is so well fortified in the modern way, that it is reckoned one of the strongest in Europe. It contains several monasteries, a good castle, a com∣mandery of the order of St. John, a pro∣testant gymnasium, two foundations for protestant ladies, an arsenal, a small harbour on the Rhine, and several churches, some of which belong to the protestants, and some to the Roman catholics.

It was formerly an imperial city, and one of the Hanse, but is now subject to the king of Prussia, though the burghers still claim their former liberty and privileges. Here is a protestant university, with a learned society, a beguinage, a commandery of the Teutonic order, two monasteries, a nunnery, and two parish churches.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of MARK.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Berg to the south, the county of Recklinghausen and the bishopric of Munster to the north, the duchy of Westphalia to the east, and those of Cleve and Berg to the West. It is about forty miles both in length and breadth, be∣longs to the king of Prussia, and is thought to have derived its name from being the ancient boundary between Germany and Gallia Belgica. It is a very fruitful country, yielding not only grain, flax, hemp, pulse, and fruit of all kinds, but also wood, coal, iron, lead, copper, and silver, quarries of stone, salt and medicinal springs, and abounding in cattle, game, and fish. There are seventeen towns in it, (exclusive of boroughs, and one half of the town of Lipstadt) with above an hundred opulent noble families. The inhabitants, both protestants and Roman catholics, enjoy the free and public exercise of their religion. Besides other manu∣factures, a great variety of iron and steel wares are made in the county, which had long counts of its own, in conjunction with Cleve; but at last came to the king of Prussia, in consequence of the treaty of partition concluded between him and the duke of Newburg, concerning the suc∣cession to the territories of the duke of Cleve. The arms of the county are a fesse, consisting of three transverse beams, gules and argent. The go∣vernment of it is vested in the same high colleges as that of Cleves. For the administration of justice there are six courts, besides the royal and noble ju∣risdictions, and a council for the police in each of the four circles, into which the county is divided.
<PB N="449" REF="4570"/>
Another division of the Mark is that which lies to the north and south of the Roer. In both these divisions the most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Hamm, the capital of the county, and formerly one of the Hanse, situate twenty-eight miles south of Munster, and in the borders of that bishopric where the Asse falls into the Lippe. It is pretty large, tolerably well built and fortified with a castle, ramparts, ditches, and pallisades. A great deal of linen is made and bleached in this town, and a good trade carried on. Here is also a noble foundation for protestant and Roman Catholic la∣dies, besides several cloysters in and about the town, a protestant academy, and two churches.</P>
<P>Unna, situate eleven miles south of Hamm, in a fine plain, is the second town in rank in the coun∣ty, and tolerably well fortified. Formerly it was one of the Hanse. The burghers subsist chiefly by agriculture, brewing, and distilling. Here is a nunnery, and the protestants have several churches, and a school. In the neighbourhood are coal pits and salt-works, whence the Mark and Cleve, and other places, are supplied with those commodi∣ties. In the district of this town, on the Roer, stands the noble, free, secular foundation of Fron∣denberg, which has an abbess, and twenty-four la∣dies belonging to it, partly protestants, and partly papists.</P>

The Lutherans have seven churches here, and the Ro∣man catholics, besides others, have the cathedral, and two monasteries. It was formerly considered as an imperial city, and was one of the Hanse. Its
<PB N="452" REF="4600"/>
privileges are still considerable. Its principal traf∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is in corn. The Lutheran academy here is one of the most noted in Westphalia. This town had once the right of coinage, and is so antient that it was a place of some note in the days of Charle∣magne. A great part of it at present is taken up with gardens. In its territory is a good salt∣work, belonging to some patricians of the town, who pay the king annually the value of fifty-two bushels of salt. There is also a famous nunnery in it, called Paradise.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHIES of JULIERS and BERG.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Juliers, lying between the Maes and the Rhine, is bounded to the south by Luxem∣berg and Trier, to the north by Guelderland and Cleve, to the east by the duchy of Cleve and the electorate of Cologne, and to the west by Liege and Limburg, being about sixty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. It is a fruitful country, pro∣during all sorts of corn, wood, pasture, woad, coal, and cattle, especially an excellent breed of horses,
<PB N="453" REF="4610"/>
of which great numbers are exported. The pro∣vincial states of this duchy, and Berg, consist of the nobility, and the deputies of the four chief towns of each. They lay claim to great privileges in their diets, which are held at Dusseldorp. The inhabi∣tants are partly protestant, and partly Roman ca∣tholic. By a treaty between the electors Palatine and of Brandenburg, respecting the succession to the territories of the duke of Cleve, both the Lu∣therans and Calvinists of this duchy, and of Berg, are to enjoy the public exercise of their religion, and all other religious rites, as fully and freely as they did before it was concluded. The elector Pala∣tine, on account of Juliers, is rated in the matri∣cula of the empire at six hundred and thirty nine florins, forty-five kruitzers, and for Berg, at two hundred and eighty-four florins; to the chamber∣judicatory, his quota each term, for both duchies, is six hundred and seventy-six rix-dollars, twenty-six kruitzers. The seat of the high provincial col∣leges for Juliers and Berg is at Dusseldorp, which stands in the latter. The states annually grant a cer∣tain sum for the ordinary charges of the govern∣ment, together with another, under the name of a free gift. The chief places in Juliers are,</P>
<P>Juliers, Julich, or Gulich, the capital of the duchy, standing on the hither Roer, thirteen miles north-east of Aix-la-chapelle.

<HEAD>The DUCHY of BERG.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy, which is about fifty miles in length, and twenty in breadth, and takes its name from the mountains, with which it abounds, termi∣nates, towards the south, on the electorate of Co∣logne, from which it is also separated on the west by the Rhine, being bounded by the county of the Mark on the north, by the duchy of West∣phalia on the east. Tho' it is a very mountainous country, it has, in some places, good corn-lands, meadows, and pasture; in others woods and vine∣yards, besides coal, iron, and other ores. It con∣tains eleven towns, and as many boroughs, in which are manufactures of cloth, iron, and steel. The same regency and diet serve for the duchies of Berg and Juliers; in the former of which the most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Dusseldorp, or Dusseldorff, on the Rhine, where the Dussel falls into it, twenty miles from Cologne, twenty-three from Juliers, and fifty-seven from Munster. It was antiently an imperial city, and is still pretty large and populous, well-built and fortified, being the seat of the land-diets and high colleges, and also one of the towns that are repre∣sented in the assembly of the states. Here is a small harbour on the Rhine, over which there is also a bridge of boats. The electors Palatine, who are sovereigns of the duchy, have some times resided in the old citadel here, which contains

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of NASSAU-SIEGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This small principality lies in the Westerwalde, and is in general a mountainous woody country, with some arable and pasture ground, and a good breed of cattle. Its manufactures are chiefly those of iron and steel, having an iron-mine in the neigh∣bourhood of Siegen. Count John the Younger, in 1626, embraced the Roman catholic religion, and endeavoured to introduce it into the country; but the principality, upon the extinction of the line of Nassau-Siegen in 1743, falling to the line of Nassau-Dietz, and therein to the prince of O∣range, hereditary stadtholder of the United Pro∣vinces, the protestants were delivered from their apprehensions of popish tyranny and bigotry. The prince, on account of these territories, has a seat and voice at the diets of the empire and circle in the college of princes. His assessment in the matricula for Nassau-Siegen is seven hundred and seventy-three florins monthly; and, towards the maintenance of the chamber judicatory, fifty rix-dollars six kruitzers and a half, each term. The revenue of this principality is estimated at one hundred thousand rix-dollars. Places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Siegen, on the river Sieg, the capital of the county, standing on a rocky hill, and well forti∣fied. There are two castles in it, an old and a new, and a Jesuits college.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of NASSAU-DILLEN∣BURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality lies near the former. It has not much arable land, but plenty of wood, good quarries of stone, some silver and vitriol, copper and lead, with store of iron, for the working and smelting of which there are many forges and founderies in the country; and by these, and the sale of their iron, the inhabitants chiefly subsist. Cal∣vinism is the religion of the principality, which contains five towns and two boroughs, and be∣longs entirely to William the Fifth, prince of Orange, and hereditary stadtholder of the United Provinces, whose father succeeded to a part of it in 1739, on the death of prince Christian, and to the rest in 1743, on the death of prince William Hy∣acynth of Siegen. The prince, on account of this principality also and Dietz, has a seat and voice in the college of princes, at the diets of the empire and circle. His assessment in the matricula, for Nassau-Dillenbourg, is one hundred and two flo∣rins, monthly; and to the chamber-judicatory, fifty rix-dollars six and a half kruitzers, each term. His revenue from this principality is computed at above one hundred and thirty thousand florins. The places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Dellenburg, which gives name to the county, and stands on the river Dill, thirty-two miles from Nassau. It has a stately old castle, in which its princes used to reside, two yearly fairs, with a good trade in cattle and woollen goods.

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of EAST-FRIESLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is called East-Friesland to distinguish it from the other, lying to the west, and the county of Embden, from its capital. Its boundaries to the north are the German-sea, and what is called the Harrlingerland; to the south, the bishopric of Munster; to the east, the seigniory of Jever, and the county of Oldenburg; and to the west, the province of Groningen, and the German-sea. It is about thirty miles in length, and near as much in breadth. The air here is thick and moist, the
<PB N="460" REF="4680"/>
country throughout being low, marshy, and moor∣ish, and much exposed to inundations from the sea, to guard against which, dykes have been erected at a great expence. The pasture in the marshes being very rich, abundance of horses, to∣gether with sheep, and horned cattle, are bred in them, and excellent cheese and butter made of the milk of the latter. There is not much corn land in the country, and the harvest is later than in other parts of Germany; but there is plenty of turf for fuel, with wild and tame fowl, venison, and pot∣herbs, tho' the last are not so palatable as in many other countries. The chief river of East-Friesland is the Ems, which, before it enters the sea, di∣vides itself into two branches, forming the island of Borcum, and called the East and West Ems. The sea upon the coast yields a variety of shell and other fish. Besides the East-Friesian, the High and Low Dutch are spoken here. This principa∣lity has its states, without whose consent the prince can undertake nothing of moment. The Lutherans, Calvinists, Roman catholics, and Jews enjoy here the free exercise of their religion; but of these fects the Lutherans are the most numerous, and next to them the Calvinists. A brisk trade in horses, horned cattle, butter, cheese, rape-seed, barley, and fine linen, is carried on in the country; and at Embden, an Asiatic company has been established by the king of Prussia, who in 1744 took possession of the principality, tho' the illustri∣ous house of Brunswic Lunenburg had a better right, and protested against his investiture. The king of Prussia, as prince of East-Friesland, has a seat and voice at the diets of the empire, and circle, in the college of princes. His assessment for it in the matricula is six horse and thirty foot, or one hundred and ninety-two florins, monthly; and to the courts of the empire, each term, one
<PB N="461" REF="4690"/>
hundred and sixty rix-dollars, eighty-six and a half kruitzers. The seat of the regency, the war and domain chamber, and other high colleges, is at Aurich. The revenues of the principality are thought greatly to exceed one hundred thousand rix dollars. Places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Aurich, which stands about ten miles from Embden, and is the capital of a district, that is marshy and full of woods. The castle here is sur∣rounded with ramparts and ditches, and was for∣merly the residence of the princes of the country. The town is garrisoned, and contains the house in which the states assemble, a Lutheran church, and a Latin school. At Rohe, a small village in this district, the antient Friesians used to hold their yearly assemblies under three tall oaks, that for∣merly stood there.</P>
<P>Norden, the oldest town in East-Friesland, a∣bout fifteen miles from Embden. It is a pleasant, well-built, populous town, with a pretty good harbour, and some trade. Not far from hence is a tract of land, called the Teel-landen, the pea∣sants of which enjoy peculiar privileges, and hold an annual assembly in the town of Norden.</P>
<P>Embden, a large populous city, on the north side of the Ems, near its mouth. It is strongly fortified, has a fine harbour, and carries on a good trade. By means of sluices, the whole neighbour∣ing country may be laid under water, and, by artifi∣cial canals, large vessels may be brought into the very heart of the city. The people are zealous as∣sertors of their liberties, and very industrious. There are many Jews here, to whom, and all other sects, except papists, they allow the free exercise of their religion. In the year 1750 an Asiatic company was erected here.</P>
<P>Jemgum, a large and opulent borough, with a harbour on the Ems.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="4700"/>
Hage, a considerable borough, giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Gretsyhl, a borough on the German sea, with a castle, from which the princes of this country derived their origin.</P>
<P>Leer, or Lier, a large and well inhabited bo∣rough on the Leda, where is a considerable linen manufacture.</P>
<P>Esens, a fine town, fourteen miles from Au∣rich, and twenty-five from Embden, capital of the Harrlinger-land, a tract lying on the German ocean, and taking its name from the river Harle. This tract consists of three seigniories, viz. those of Esens, Stedesdorf, and Wittmund, which had once lords of their own, but came all at last to the house of East-Friesland.</P>
<P>Wittmund, a large borough, with a castle, giving name to one of the abovementioned ba∣ronies.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of MORS or MEURS.</HEAD>
<P>This small principality is surrounded by the duchies of Cleve and Berg, the archbishopric of Cologne, and the duchy of Gueldres, being bounded to the east by the Rhine, and yielding plenty of corn, cattle, and venison. After the death of the last count, and his daughter Walpurgis, it came to the house of Nassau-Orange, and on the death of William III. king of Great Britain, to the elec∣toral house of Brandenburg, which, in 1648, had annexed the lordship of Friemorsheim, that had been held by the count of Meurs as a fief of the abbey of Werden, to the duchy of Cleve. As prince of Mors the king of Prussia has a seat and voice in the college of princes of the empire, and
<PB N="463" REF="4710"/>
also at the diets of the circle. His quota towards the army of the empire, is four horse, and twelve foot, and towards the expences of the imperial chamber, forty-two rix-dollars, fifty-four kruit∣zers. From the territories of this principality, which has its peculiar regency, the king raises yearly about thirty thousand rix-dollars. The places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Mors or Meurs, a small, but well fortified town, where the provincial colleges hold their meetings. Here is a castle, a Calvinist church, and Latin∣school.</P>
<P>Crefeld, a small town, with a citadel, where are manufactures of velvet, silk, linen, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of SAYN.</HEAD>
<P>In this county are three towns, and as many boroughs. The Lutherans, Calvinists, and Roman catholics have the free exercise of their religions. One part of it belongs to the margrave of Bran∣denburg Anspach, another to the burgrave of Kirch∣berg, another to the counts of Witgenshein-Hornburg, and another to the elector of Treves. The two first of these have each a voice in the col∣lege of Westphalian counts of the empire, on ac∣count of their share in the county; but in the diets of the circle, they have but one betwixt them. In the matricula the whole county is rated at four horse and sixteen foot, or one hundred and twelve florins monthly, in lieu of them, and at forty-six rix-dol∣lars, sixty kruitzers, each term, on account of the chamber-judicatory. Of these assessments the se∣veral proprietors pay a certain proportion. The places worth mentioning in it are,</P>
<P>Altenkirchen, a small town, but the capital of, and the seat of the regency for that part, which belongs to the margrave of Brandenburg Anspach.
<PB N="464" REF="4720"/>
It has a castle, with a Lutheran, and Calvinist church.</P>
<P>Freusburg, a borough with a castle, on the river Sieg.</P>
<P>Friedwald, a small town with a castle, not far from Freusburg.</P>
<P>Bendorff, a borough, situated not far from the Rhine, and giving name to a district.</P>
<P>Hachenburg, a small town, but the capital of that part of the county which belongs to the burgrave of Kirchberg, who resides in the castle. A part of the territory of Burbach, in this coun∣ty, belongs to the prince of Orange.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of WIED.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Wied, with the seignories be∣longing thereto, was, on the death of count John, in the year 1595, divided into two equal parts, viz. the Wied-Wied part, known at this day by the name of New-Wied, or the lower county of Wied, and the Wied Durdorf, or Wied-Runkel, part which is called the upper county. These two parts are still possessed by different branches of the family, called the counts of Wied-Runkel, and Wied-Wied, who, at the diets of the empire, be∣long to the college of the Westphalian counts of the empire, and in those of the circle, have a voice next after that of Sayn. Their matricular assess∣ment is four horse, and twelve foot, or ninety-six florins monthly. To the chamber judicatory the lower county pays, each term, thirty-two rix-dol∣lars, forty kruitzers, and the upper as much. The only places worth mentioning in both parts are,</P>
<P>Runkel, which gives name to one of them, and is its capital. It is a small town on the river Lahn, containing about an hundred and twenty houses,
<PB N="465" REF="4730"/>
with a castle, which was formerly the residence of the counts.</P>
<P>Dierdorf, another small town in the same divi∣sion, to which it also gives name. It contains a castle, in which the lord at present resides. In its district is dug a fine white marble.</P>
<P>New-Wied, so called to distinguish it from an∣other place with a castle, called Old-Wied, is a small, but regular built town on the Rhine, the capital of the other division of the county, and the residence of its counts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of SHAUENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which takes its name from the an∣tient castle of Shauenburg, lies on the Weser, and is surrounded by the principalities of Calenberg and Minden, and the counties of Lippe and Ra∣vensberg. It is, in general, mountainous, yet has some good corn and pasture lands, together with quarries of free and lime-stone, pits of coal, salt-springs, alum, gipsum, crystals, with gold, silver, brass, copper, and iron pyrites. Here are also woods abounding with mast, and rivers with fish. As to its extent, it is about thirty miles from south to north, and twenty from east to west, and contains seven towns, and three boroughs. Most of the inhabitants are Lutherans. The county, at present, belongs partly to the king of Great-Britain, partly to the landgrave of Hesse, and partly to the count of Shauenburg-Lippe. The two last, on account of it, have jointly a seat and voice in the college of the Westphalian counts of the empire; but, in the diets of the circle, each has a distinct voice. The whole county, in the matricula of the empire, is taxed at six horse, and twenty-six foot, or two hundred and seventy-six florins, monthly in lieu of them. To the cham∣ber-court
<PB N="466" REF="4740"/>
both the above princes pay, each term, seventy-five rix-dollars, forty-three kruitzers. The revenue arising from the county to both, is about one hundred thousand rix-dollars. In that part of it belonging to the counts of Shauenburg-Lippe, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Hagenburg, an open borough, with a castle, and an Hanoverian post-house, from which the in∣habitants derive great benefit, as well as from a manufacture of linnen and buckram.</P>
<P>Steinhude, an open borough, on the Steinhuder-Meer, or lake. The inhabitants subsist partly by fishing, and partly by a manufacture of buckram and linnen.</P>
<P>Sadthagen, the chief town of the whole county, and well fortified. Here is a castle, the antient residence of the counts, behind which is a kitchen garden, and a spring of mineral water, whose good effects many have experienced. Here also is an orphan house, and a very stately mausoleum, which was erected to prince Ernest.</P>
<P>Buckburg, a small town with a castle, a large and beautiful town church, a new town-school, a fountain in the market, and a church and orphan house belonging to the Calvinists.</P>
<P>In the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel's share, the chief places are,</P>
<P>Shauenburg, an old ruinous castle, between Rinteln and Oldendorf, from which the whole county derives its name. It appears, that C. Drusus, step-son to the emperor Augustus, built a fort here, which was repaired by the first count of Shauenburg, but at present is quite gone to ruin.</P>
<P>Visbeck, a borough on the Weser, where is an imperial free Lutheran foundation for twelve ladies, with an abbess.</P>
<P>Mollenbeck, formerly a cloister in a wood, not
<PB N="467" REF="4750"/>
far from Rinteln, the revenues of which are now applied partly to the university of Rinteln, and partly as stipends for the students.</P>
<P>Egestorf, formerly a Benedictine nunnery, the revenues of which now belong to the university of Rinteln.</P>
<P>Soltorf, a place lying not far from Rodenberg, where a fine white salt is made.</P>
<P>Rinteln, a fortified town, with the Weser on one side of it, and the Exter on the other. Here was antiently a cloister, from which a street in the town is at this day called Cloister Street. The professors of the protestant university in this town are partly Lutherans, partly Calvinists. The regency for the Hessian part of the county has its seat here, together with the consistory, and superintendent, and some trade is carried on by means of the Weser.</P>
<P>Oldendorf, a small town on the Weser, between Hameln and Rinteln.</P>
<P>Obernkirchen, a small town, where is a noble foundation for ten Lutheran ladies, which was an∣tiently a Benedictine nunnery.</P>
<P>Rodenberg, a mean little town, with a castle. It gave name antiently to a seigniory, which had lords of its own. Behind the castle is a medicinal spring.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of OLDENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This county has the bishopric of Munster to the south; the seigniory of Jever and Jade to the north; the county of Delmenhorst and the Weser to the east; and East-Friesland to the west. It is about forty miles in length, and upwards of thirty in breadth. The soil, in some parts of it, is good, yeilding excellent pasturage, and feeding abundance of black cattle and horses; in others it is moorish,
<PB N="468" REF="4760"/>
and yields little besides turf. Against the inunda∣tions to which it is exposed, it is secured by dykes and dams. The kings of Denmark, who have been in possession of the county of Oldenburg ever since the year 1671, are intituled by it to a seat and voice both in the Westphalian college of the counts of the empire, and also at the diets of the circle. For the defence of the empire, this county is taxed at eight horse, and thirty foot, or two hundred and sixteen florins, in lieu of them; and for the main∣tenance of its courts, at one hundred and thirteen rix-dollars, fifty-five kruitzers, in conjunction with Delmenhorst. For the civil government of the county and the administration of justice, there is a regency, with subordinate judicatories, and for the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, a royal consistory, and su∣perintendent. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Oldenburg, which gives name to it, situated at the conflux of the Hunte and Haare, and regu∣larly fortified. The principal church of St. Lam∣bert was the burial-place of the counts of Oldenburg; and the castle is now the residence of the royal stadtholder. In the latter was formerly kept the celebrated horn of Oldenburg, but now in the museum at Copenhagen: it is of silver gilt, and weighs sixty-one ounces, or almost four pounds. In this town is a pretty good garrison.</P>
<P>Varel, a well built borough, seated in a wood or grove, called the Bush of Varel. It was formerly the capital of a seigniory, which had a lord of its own. One wing of the fine castle here was burnt down in 1751.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of DELMENHORST.</HEAD>
<P>This county is surrounded by those of Olden∣burg and Diepholt, the Weser, and the district of Wildeshausen. It is tolerably fertile, and well
<PB N="469" REF="4770"/>
supplied with wood. The king of Denmark, who has been in possession of this county ever since the year 1671, is intitled by it to a seat and voice in the college of the Westphalian counts of the empire, and also at the Westphalian diet. Its quota to the army of the empire is two horse and fourteen foot, or eighty florins, in lieu of them. The govern∣ment of it is vested in the regency of Oldenburg. The only place belonging to it, worth mentioning, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Delmenhorst, a small town, with a strong castle, taking its name from the little river Delme, on which it stands.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of LIPPE.</HEAD>
<P>This county is a narrow tract, between Ravens∣berg and Schaumburg to the north, and Pader∣born to the south. It has some corn land, but the greater part consists of mountains and heath. On the heath of Senner is a stud, which formerly yield∣ed, annually, thirty thousand rix-dollars. In the whole county are five towns, four boroughs, and one hundred and fifty-two peasantships. The land∣states consist of the nobility and the towns, and the inhabitants are mostly Calvinists. The greater part of this country belongs to the counts of Lippe-Schauenburg and Lippe-Detmold. The king of Great-Britain, the king of Prussia, and the bishop of Paderborn, are also possessed of some districts in it. The counts stile themselves counts and noble lords of Lippe, and have seat and voice both at the diets of the empire, in the college of the Westphalian counts, and at those of the circle. To the army of the empire their quota is, four horse and eighteen foot, or, in lieu of them, one hundred and twenty florins, monthly; and to the courts of the empire, each term, sixty-seven rix∣dollars,
<PB N="470" REF="4780"/>
fifty-six kruitzers. Some of the officers and judges are appointed with the advice and consent of the non-regent lords, the nobility, and towns; and the taxes to be raised are settled at the provincial diets, with the approbation of the states. The principal places in the county are,</P>
<P>Detmold, a town with a castle on the Werra, where the regent-house has its usual residence. Hereabouts, as it is supposed, Quintilius Varus met with his well known defeat.</P>
<P>Lemgow, or Lemgau, the largest town in the county. Here is a Lutheran academy, two Lu∣theran and one Calvinist church, one of the count's palaces, called Lippehof, and a noble foundation for ladies, the abbess of which is always a countess of the regent-house of Lippe. The town was for∣merly one of the Hanse, and also an imperial city.</P>
<P>Horn, an antient town, situated by a wood, where is another of the count's palaces.</P>
<P>Blomberg, a small town, not far from the former.</P>
<P>Salz-Uflen, a small town on the Salze, where is a rich salt-spring.</P>
<P>Barndorf, a borough, in which is a palace of the counts.</P>
<P>Lipstadt, which we have described already, and which belongs partly to the king of Prussia, as count of the Mark, and partly to the regent-house of Lippe.</P>
<P>Swalenberg, a borough with a castle, which was once the capital of an independent county, now belonging partly to the house of Lippe, and part∣ly to the bishopric of Paderborn.</P>
<P>Lipperode, a borough on the Lippe, which gives name to a district belonging to the house of Lippe-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chauenburg.</P>
<P><PB N="471" REF="4790"/>
Alverdissen, a borough with a castle, belonging to a branch of the house of Lippe, thence called the Alverdissen-line.</P>
<P>Sternberg, a castle, which gives name to a county, belonging to the king of Great-Britain. This county has that of Lippe to the south and west, that of Shauenburg to the north, and the principality of Calenberg to the east. It is diversified with hills and vallies, and well sup∣plied with wood, game, venison, and marle; with the last of which they manure their lands. These lands are chiefly employed in raising flax; but as both men and women apply themselves to spinning and weaving linen, the quantity raised is not sufficient for their consumption. In this coun∣ty are also two potteries, and in some places of it is found a small tapering stone, which is so hard, that it cuts glass, and being incased, is used by jewellers and others. The inhabitants here are mostly Calvinists.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of BENTHEIM.</HEAD>
<P>This county is surrounded by the United Pro∣vinces, and the bishopric of Munster. It is about forty miles in length, and fifteen in breadth, a∣bounding with wood, quarries of stone, game, and venison. There are also some pleasant, fruit∣ful vallies and meadows in it, with a good breed of cattle. The river Vechte, which runs thro' it, is well stored with fish, and navigable for small craft. There are three towns, and one borough in it. The inhabitants are industrious, and traffic in yarn, wool, linen, honey, cattle, stones, and wood. The diets here consist of the deputies of the pro∣vince of Over-Yssel, or of the prince of Orange, on account of their Bentheim estates, of certain
<PB N="472" REF="4800"/>
noble families and cloisters, and the burgher-masters of the three towns. The inhabitants are some Lu∣therans, some Calvinists, and some Roman catho∣lics. In the year 1753, count Frederic Charles-Philip yielded up his county, which he had be∣fore mortgaged to the king of Great-Britain for thirty years, on condition of his advancing him a sum of money, and taking upon him his debts. The count of Bentheim-Bentheim has a seat and voice, both in the college of the Westphalian counts of the empire, and also at the diets of the circle. His quota to the army of the empire is six horse and twenty foot, or one hundred and fifty florins, monthly. To the courts of the empire his proportion is one hundred and twenty rix-dollars, sixty-six kruitzers. The county is divided into the upper and lower, which differ from each other not only in regard to tenure, but also in respect of usages, statutes, and rights. The chief places in both are,</P>
<P>Bentheim, from which the county takes its name, a pretty large borough, thirty miles north∣west of Munster, and thirty-six west of Osnabrug. Here is an old castle, which is the residence of the counts. Drusus, step-son to the emperor Au∣gustus, is said to have erected a castle here. The town is seated in a wood, and has a Calvinist and Roman catholic church.</P>
<P>Schuttorf, the oldest town in the county, stand∣ing on the Vechte.</P>
<P>North-horn, a small open town, surrounded by the Vechte, by which it carries on a pretty good trade.</P>
<P>Frenswegen, a cloister of regular canons, of the order of St. Augustine, which has a seat and voice at the land diets, and was formerly the burial∣place of the counts.</P>
<P><PB N="473" REF="4810"/>
Wietmarsen, a noble, free, temporal founda∣tion for ladies, which has also seat and voice at the land-diets.</P>
<P>Nienhus, or Neuenhaus, a town situated on the Dinkel. It is the capital of the lower county, and had formerly a castle, now in ruins.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of STEINFURT.</HEAD>
<P>This county is wholly surrounded by the bishop∣ric of Munster, and is about fifteen miles long, and ten broad. The river Aa traverses the whole length of it. The town, citadel, and parish of Steinfurt, is an immediate county of the empire; but the rest is subject to the bishop of Munster, as superior. The count has both seat and voice in the Westphalian college of counts of the empire; and at the diets of the circle. To a Roman month he contributes seven florins, thirty-two kruitzers, and to the courts of the empire, each term, five rix-dollars, eighty-nine kruitzers. The bishop of Munster also, on account of Steinfurt, is to pay thirty-four rix dollars, fifty-three kruitzers. The only place in the county worth mentioning is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Steinfurt, a small town on the Aa, about ten miles from Bentheim. Here is a Roman catholic and Calvinist church, with a college for the liberal arts, and a commandery of St. John.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTIES of TECKLEN-BURG and LINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>The first of these counties is bounded on the north and east by the bishopric of Osnabrug, and on the south and west by that of Munster. It is about thirty miles long and ten broad, and is pretty fertile in corn, yielding also wood, turf, fowl,
<PB N="474" REF="4820"/>
venison, and quarries of stone. In the rivers and brooks are plenty of fish. Much linen is manu∣factured in the county, the inhabitants of which are all Calvinists. This county was formerly more considerable and extensive than it is at present, the bishops of Munster having got possession of a great part of it. The count of Solms-Braunfels having disposed of his right to the king of Prussia in 1707, the king immediately took possession of the whole of what is now called the county of Tecklenburg, on account of which he has a seat and voice in the Westphalian college of imperial counts, and also at the diets of the circle. His quota to the army of the empire, on the same account, is three horse, and ten foot, or seventy-six florins, monthly. To the courts of the empire, he is taxed at forty rix-dollars, fifty-two kruitzers, each term. The regency for Tecklenburg and Lingen counties has its seat at the latter of these towns, but the provincial judicatory at the former. The sovereigns domains in Tecklenburg bring in yearly about twenty-four thousand rix-dollars. The capital of the county and the only town in it worth mention∣ing, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Tecklenburg, a small place, with an antient castle. In the parish of Lehden is a noble free temporal foundation for nine ladies, and an abbess.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of LINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies between the bishoprics of Mun∣ster and Osnabrug, and is about fifteen miles long, and ten broad. The soil, in general, is tolerably fertile, and it has some good pits of coal, and quar∣ries of stone. Though Calvinism is here the es∣tablished religion, yet the greater part of the inha∣bitants are Roman catholics, and a few of them Lu∣therans.
<PB N="475" REF="4830"/>
On the death of king William this coun∣ty was seized by the king of Prussia, who incorpo∣rated it with Tecklenburg, of consequence it is un∣der the same regency as Tecklenburg; but whate∣ver relates to war, the police, and domains, belongs to the chamber of Minden. The royal annual re∣venues arising from the demesnes in this county, and taxes, amount to about eighty thousand florins. The only places in it deserving notice are,</P>
<P>Lingen, which gives name to the county, and is its capital. Though but a small town, standing near the Ems, it has a Lutheran, Calvinist, and Roman catholic church, with an academy, or gym∣nasium, founded by William III. prince of Orange. Not far from it is a ferry over the Ems, called Lin∣gen-ferry.</P>
<P>Ibbenbuhren, a small town, near which are quar∣ries of stone, and coal-pits.</P>
<P>Rheda, a small town, with a castle, near the Ems. It is the capital of a seigniory belonging to the counts of Tecklenburg-Limburg, but a fief of Munster.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of RAVENSBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is about forty miles in length, and thirty-eight in breadth, is surrounded by the bishoprics of Munster, Paderborn, and Os∣nabrug, the principality of Minden, the counties of Lippe, Schauenberg, and Ritberg, and the seig∣niory of Rheda. Tho' in general mountainous and sandy, it yields good pasturage, corn, coal, and salt, besides a great deal of flax, hemp, and wood, with quarries of stone, and mineral springs. The river Weser, which runs betwixt it and Minden, is very convenient for the exportation and importa∣tion of goods. This county contains nine or ten
<PB N="476" REF="4840"/>
towns, and about an hundred and thirty villages. It has also its land-diets. As to religion, there are some Roman catholics, Jews, and Calvinists; but most of the inhabitants are Lutherans. A great deal of linen, coarse and fine, is manufactured and whitened in the county, and from thence exported, not only all over Europe, but to America. There are also some woollen manufactures, particularly of stockings. Upon the death of John William, duke of Cleve, in 1609, the elector of Branden∣burg took possession of this county, among others, in which he was confirmed by the convention con∣cluded in 1666 with the elector Palatine, Philip William. The government of the county is vested in the regency of Minden, and the management of the finances and taxes belongs to the war and do∣main chamber of that principality. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Bielefeld, the capital of the county, and a pretty large well built town, divided into two parts by the river Lutterbach. Here is a chapter, con∣sisting of five Roman catholic, and seven Lutheran capitulars, a Franciscan monastery, an orphan∣house, house of correction, infirmary, one Cal∣vinist, and several Lutheran churches, a Latin school, a great linen manufactory and bleachery, and a manufacture of stuffs and stockings. In the neighbourhood are plantations of tobacco. The provincial diets of the nobility, and their ar∣chives, are kept here.</P>
<P>Herford, formerly Hervorden, a large town, seated at the conflux of the rivers Werre and Aa, and divided into three parts, viz. the Altstadt, the Neustadt, and the Radewig. It contains se∣veral churches and chapels, with a gymnasium, an abbey, a commandery of St. John, a chapter, two Latin schools, and a cloister of grey friars. It was
<PB N="477" REF="4850"/>
once declared an imperial city, but the elector of Brandenburg afterwards took possession of it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have already mentioned the two noble nunneries here for protestant ladies, viz. that called the Abbey of Herford, and the nunnery of St. Mary. Of the former the abbess, and all the nuns, are Calvinists, of the latter Lutherans; but the latter is dependant on the former. The abbess is a princess of the empire, having her hereditary officers, with a seat at the diets, and princes and counts for her vassals.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of HOYA.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Lunenburg on the east, Diep∣holt on the west, Minden on the south, and Bre∣men on the north. It is about thirty miles in
<PB N="478" REF="4860"/>
length, and nearly as much in breadth. As to the soil, it is, in general, heathy and sandy; but there are some fruitful spots, which yield not only good pasture, but also corn sufficient for the inhabitants, and the heath supplies them with turf for fuel. They have some trade in wool, honey, wax, stockings, lace, linen, and cattle. The peasants are mostly bondsmen. The states of the county, which contains one town, and seventeen boroughs, consist of the nobility and freemen, to∣gether with the deputies of Nienburg, and the bo∣roughs. Lutheranism is the religion of the inha∣bitants, who are divided into fifty-four parishes, under several superintendents, subordinate to the consistory of Hanover, to which electorate the whole of the county belongs, excepting only the districts of Uchte and Freudenberg, of which the Iandgrave of Hesse-Cassel is superior. The king of Great-Britain, on account of Hoya, has a seat and voice in the college of the Westphalian counts of the empire; their quota to the army of the empire for it being two horse and six foot, or forty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them. As to the imperial courts, a certain sum is paid for the whole electoral lands, in which this county is included. The subsidies and taxes levied here are said to be very heavy. Besides other rates, there is one towards defraying the expences of em∣bassies, and the maintenance of the university of Gottingen. The most remarkable places are,</P>
<P>Bassum, a borough, belonging to the land∣grave of Hesse, where is a noble foundation for ladies, of which the elector of Hanover is supe∣rior. In the parish of Keiligenrode is such another foundation.</P>
<P>Suhlingen, a borough, where a superintendent resides, and where are four yearly fairs for cattle, and other commodities.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="4870"/>
Harpstedt, a borough seated on the Delme, with a territorial jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Nienburg, a strong town on the Weser, over which there is a beautiful stone-bridge.</P>
<P>Drakenburg, a borough seated on the Weser.</P>
<P>Hoya, a borough with a citadel, from which the county takes its name.</P>
<P>Liebenau, a borough, where is a manufacture of lace and scythes.</P>
<P>Old Bruch-hausen, a borough, with a castle and manor belonging to the sovereign.</P>
<P>The Hesse-Cassel share in this county is held in fief of Hesse by the house of Bentheim.</P>
<P>In the matricula its quota is two foot, or eight florins, monthly; and to the chamber-judicatory it pays, each term, six rix-dollars, thirty-seven and a half kruitzers.</P>

Its assessment to the empire is fifteen florins, and, to the chamber - judicatory, thirty-five rix-dollars, twenty kruitzers.
