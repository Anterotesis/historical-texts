<HEAD>UNITED-NETHERLANDS.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In NORTH-HOLLAND the towns sending deputies to the states are,</HEAD>
<P>ALkmaar, situated about twenty-three miles from Amsterdam, to the north. It is one of the most beautiful and best built towns in this part of the country, and is surrounded with pleasant gardens, walks, and meadows, in the last of which are kept great numbers of cows. Hence a large trade is carried on in cheese and butter, by which the inhabitants, who are mostly papists, are en∣riched. The road and canal from hence to Beem∣ster, and the canal to Hoorn, are exceeding plea∣sant; as are also the walks upon the ramparts. In 1637, there was an auction of tulips here, of which some were sold for three or four thousand, and some even for five thousand, guilders each. This flower-phrenzy at last rose to such a height, that the states were obliged to put a stop to it by se∣vere penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="30"/>
Hoorn, situated on a bay of the Zuyder-see, se∣venteen miles from Amsterdam, to the north. On the land side are rich pastures, fine gardens, plea∣sant walks, and canals. Great numbers of cattle are brought hither from Denmark, and fattened in the adjacent meadows. A train of villages runs from the extremity of one of the walks, to the gates of Enkhuisen. The town has a good harbour, an India-house, a great annual fair in May, a fine dock, in which men of war and mer∣chant-ships are built, and a considerable traffic in butter and cheese. It has also a share in the whaie fishery; with a college of admiralty, which meets here and at Enkhuisen alternately, every three months; and is the seat of the mint of North-Hol∣land, alternately with Einkhuisen and Medenblik.</P>
<P>Enkhuisen, which stands also on the Zuyder-see, eleven miles from Hoorn, and has a good har∣bour, several churches belonging to different sects, an East and West-India house, a provincial maga∣zine, a foundery for cannon, a great trade in ship∣building and salt, and a share in the herring-fishery. It is also well fortified, and the seat of an admiralty∣college, and the mint-office for North-Holland, alternately with Hoorn.</P>
<P>Edam, situated at a small distance from the Zuyder-see, with which it has a communication, and a trade in timber, train-oil, salt, and ship∣building. Near it was formerly a great lake, called the Purmer, which is now drained, and converted into rich land. A mermaid, or sea∣nymph, is said to have been found here in 1430, which learned to dress, eat, and make the sign of the cross, but not to speak, tho' she lived several years.</P>
<P>Monnikendam, on a small bay of the Zuyder-see, about eight miles from Amsterdam to the north east. The inhabitants live chiefly by fishing, soap-boiling, and silk-weaving, the harbour hav∣ing
<PB N="5" REF="40"/>
been quite choaked up with sand. It takes its name from the lake of Monnika, which has a communication with the Zuyder-see, by means of a canal. In the town-house is said to be kept the collar of the order of the Golden Fleece, taken from count Bossu, admiral of the Spanish fleet, that was defeated by the Dutch in 1573, near Hoorn.</P>
<P>Medenblick, commonly called Memelick, ly∣ing also on the Zuyder-see, about seven miles from Enkhuisen. It is small but well fortified, and has a noble harbour that will contain three hundred sail. The dykes here are exceeding strong and high, yet such is the fury of the waves, that some∣times they threaten to break through or overflow them. The trade of this town consists chiefly in tim∣ber brought from Norway and the Baltic, besides, in the neighbourhood are bred and fed vast numbers of cattle. This town was antiently the capital of North Holland, and the seat of the Frisian kings.</P>
<P>Purmeren, the last town of North Holland that sends deputies to the states, taking its name from the Purmer abovementioned, at one end of which it stands, thirteen miles from Amsterdam to the north. The neighbouring country was formerly full of lakes and marshes, which are now drained and converted into gardens, orchards, rich pastures, highways, dykes, and canals.</P>
<P>The other places in North Holland worth men∣tioning are,</P>
<P>Sardam, or Zardam, a large and wealthy town at the mouth of the Zaan, which falls into the Y, about five miles from Amsterdam, to the north-west. Above three hundred vessels are said to be built here in a year; and a man of war could be built every week if there was occasion, and all ma∣terials provided. The mills of all kinds about the town exceed two thousand in number. Many rich
<PB N="6" REF="50"/>
merchants reside here, and a great trade is carried on in grain, timber, blubber, and many other commodities.</P>
<P>Egmont, the name of two villages, at one of which are the ruins of the old palace of the counts of Egmont.</P>
<P>Beverwyk, a handsome town on Wykermeer, whose inhabitants are mostly gardeners, and supply Amsterdam with all kinds of vegetables.</P>
<P>Petten, a village on the North-sea, famous for oysters.</P>
<P>Helder, a village at the extremity of North Holland. Most of the inhabitants are pilots, employed in carrying out or bringing in ships through the Marsdiep, by which the Zuyder-see communicates with the North Sea. West of it is a fine road called the Landsdiep, which in time of war is the rendezvous of the Dutch fleets.</P>
<P>Brock, a large and handsome village. Nothing, it is said, can exceed it in point of cleanliness and neatness.</P>
<P>Schagen, a large open town fourteen miles to the west of Medenblick. The adjacent country is reckoned the richest soil in Europe. Not far from hence is Obdam, a village, which gives title to a branch of the noble family of Wassenaar.</P>
<P>The greater part of the continent of North Hol∣land consists of drained lakes and marshes, in conse∣quence of which it is full of canals, dykes, ditches, and sluices. Of the islands that lie about it the most noted is the Texel, which is parted from the continent by a channel called the Marsdiep. It is very fruit∣ful, breeds great numbers of sheep, and contains six villages: on the eastern coast of it is a good road, called Mosco road. In 1672, the duke of York intended to have landed here, but was prevented by an ebb that continued twelve hours, and was succeeded by a storm.</P>

<HEAD>ZEALAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, called in Dutch Zeeland, or See∣land, from its situation, has Holland to the north, Flanders to the south, Brabant to the east, and the German ocean to the west. It consists entirely of islands formed by the several branches and outlets of the Scheld, and guarded against the sea by dykes of great height and thickness. The soil is very fruitful, yielding wheat, good fruits, rich pasture, great quantities of madder, but little or no fuel of any kind, with which, however, it is well supplied, either from the other provinces, or from England and Scotland. There is plenty of fish, especially of the shell-kind, and of all other kinds of provisions; the flocks of sheep are large and numerous, and their wool very fine; the pro∣vince, in general, is very wealthy and populous, and carries on a great traffic; though the air agrees not with strangers, yet the natives, who are born and bred in it, enjoy a pretty good state of health. The several islands had antiently lords of their own, afterwards they became subject to the counts of Holland, and, with that province, fell to the house of Burgundy, then to the house of Austria, and at last joined with the other provinces in the union of Utrecht. The assembly of the states, consisting of seven members, is held at Middle∣burg; and the prince of Orange, as marquis of Flushing and Terveere, is president of it. To the assembly of the states-general, Zealand sends four deputies, who hold their office for life. The prin∣cipal tribunals and boards are, two high courts of justice, a college of admiralty, and a chamber of accounts. The clergy are divided into four classes, making altogether sixty-three ministers. A synod meets only when convened by the states, and that
<PB N="8" REF="70"/>
only on extraordinary occasions. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Middleburg, the capital, situated in the island of Walcheren, which is of a round figure, about eleven miles from south to north, and near as ma∣ny from east to west. The city is large and well fortified, and contains several churches, belonging to different sects, a Jewish synagogue, and mint. It is also the place where the states assemble, and where the high courts and colleges are held. It seems to have borrowed its name from its situation in the middle of the island, five miles from Flush∣ing, forty-two from Rotterdam, and thirty-four from Ostend. Ships of four hundred tons can come up to it by a broad deep canal, a mile and an half in length, and it is not only large, but handsome, populous, rich, and flourishing, being inhabited by many wealthy merchants, who carry on a great trade to the East and West-Indies, France, Spain, and Portugal, besides having a large share in the herring and whale fisheries. Middleburg was erected into a bishop's see, by Pope Paul IV. but being not long after taken by the prince of Orange, after a siege of two years, the bishopric was suppressed. There are several fine squares and public buildings here. Among the latter, in particular, is St. Nicholas's abbey, where the states assemble, and the high colleges are held; and the town-house, whose clock and dial has said to have cost an hundred and fifty thou∣sand guilders. Here is also a gymnasium illustre. The island in which the city stands, though not the largest, is the most fruitful and populous of all the Zealand islands.</P>
<P>Vlissingen or Flushing, situated in the same island, at the mouth of the Hondt or Westerscheld, about five miles from Middleburg, is well fortified, has a fine harbour, and a good trade, and though not
<PB N="9" REF="80"/>
so large, or so well built, as Middleburg, yet con∣tains several fine structures. It shook off the Spa∣nish yoke in 1572, and voluntarily submitted to the states. In 1585 it was mortgaged to queen Elizabeth, together with the Briel and Rammekins, but restored by James I. Sir Philip Sidney was governor of it while in the hands of the English. Loaded vessels come up to the very doors of the merchants. The famous admiral de Ruyter, who rose from a common seaman and pilot to be admiral of the United-Provinces, was born here, in 1607. The prince of Orange, as marquis of Flushing and Veer, or Ter-Veer, is first nobleman of the pro∣vince, and president in the assembly of the states.</P>
<P>Veer or Ter-Veer, antiently Campveer, which stands in the same island, on the north side of it, at the mouth of the East Schelde, about four miles from Middleburg, and eight from Flushing. Veer, in Dutch, signifies a passage or ferry, over an arm of the sea or a river; and as there was once a ferry here over the Schelde, to the village of Compen, on the island of North Beve∣land, the town thereby got the name of Veer, Camp-Veer, and Ter-Veer. It is well fortified, and enjoys a good trade, especially to Scotland, the natives of which enjoy particular privileges here. The arsenal is the best furnished in the pro∣vince, and the harbour a very good one. The Calvinists alone are allowed the public exercise of their religion in this town; whence the Veres, an∣tiently earls of Oxford, are said to have derived both their origin and name. The two following towns are also situated in the island of Wal∣charen, but send no deputies to the states.</P>
<P>Arnemuyden, commonly called Armuijen, taking its name from Muyde, a mouth, and Arne, the name of a small river or canal, at no great distance, at the mouth of which the town originally stood. It
<PB N="10" REF="90"/>
was once a large thriving town, but the harbour having been choaked up with sand, it fell to decay, and now subsists chiefly by making and refining salt.</P>
<P>West-Kappel, an open place on the west side of the Schelde.</P>
<P>Rammekens, or Zeeburg, a small fort standing at the mouth of Middleburg harbour, which, as we have already observed, was mortgaged to queen Elizabeth.</P>
<P>Haak, a fort to the north-west of Ter-Veer, which commands the Veer-Gat, through which the shipping must pass into the East-Schelde.</P>
<P>In the island of South Beveland, otherwise called the Land-van-ter-Goes, and which is both the largest and pleasantest of all the islands of Zeeland, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Goes or Ter-Goes, in the most northern part of the island, not far from the East-Schelde, with which it has a communication by a channel de∣fended by two forts. Though not large, it is neat∣ly built, and pretty well fortified, and carries on a great trade; besides, it is the only town on the island that sends deputies to the states. Along the dyke of the haven or canal are some salt-pans.</P>
<P>Borselen or Monster, a village belonging to the Borselen family. A town of the same name stood formerly in the neighbourhood, which was destroy∣ed by an inundation in 1532.</P>
<P>In the small island of North Beveland, the only place worth mentioning is Kortgene, a country∣town, belonging to the family of Nassau-Odyk.</P>
<P>In the island of Schowen, which is about seven∣teen miles long, and seven or eight broad, and abounds with gentlemen's seats, rich farms, and in∣closures, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Zirksee, or Zurich-see, on the south side of the island, about thirteen miles from Middleburg. It
<PB N="11" REF="100"/>
sends deputies to the states, and is in a flourishing condition, having a good harbour, and near an hundred sail of ships. The commodities it deals in are chiefly salt, fish, especially oysters, madder, and mead.</P>
<P>Brouwershaven, a small town, with a convenient harbour, the inhabitants of which are either sea∣men or fishermen. The celebrated James Cats, grand-pensionary of Holland and West-Friesland, and one of the most eminent Dutch poets, was born here, and died in 1660.</P>
<P>In the island of Duiveland, which took its name from the great numbers of duives, or pigeons, with which it formerly abounded: though pretty large, there are no towns, but several villages, which however merit not a description.</P>
<P>In the island of Tholen, which is near eight miles long, and four broad, the only place worth men∣tioning is that which gives name to it, viz. Tholen, or Ter-Tholen, which stands on the river Een∣dracht, is pretty well fortified, and sends deputies to the states. It had its name from a toll-house erected here by the counts of Zealand. The neighbouring district is very fruitful, being what they call polders, i. e. drained lands, inclosed with banks. The prince of Orange has a large estate in this island.</P>
<P>There is another small island in the province, called St. Philip's Island, but it contains no town, and only one village, which gives name to the island. Though the island of Over-Flaque is in the province of Holland, yet Sommelsdyk, or Zomerdyk, a country-town in it, belongs to Zea∣land.</P>

<HEAD>UTRECHT.</HEAD>
<P>This province is wholly surrounded by Holland and Gelderland, excepting a small part of it that borders on the Zuyder-see. Its greatest length is about thirty-two miles, and breadth about twenty-two. It enjoys a good air, and in most places the soil is fruitful, but in some, sandy, or what is called turf-ground, and in others over-run with wood. It is watered by the Leck, Rhine, Vecht, and other smaller rivers, besides several canals, of which that extending from the village of Vrees∣wyk to Utrecht is one of the chief. The states here, as in the other provinces, are composed of the nobility, and the towns; the latter of which are Utrecht, Amersfoort, Wyk, Rhenen, and Mont∣foort; but Utrecht bears the chief sway. The bi∣shops of that city were antiently temporal lords of the province, as well as of Overyssel, till Henry of Bavaria sold the sovereignty thereof to Charles V. In 1559 the see of Utrecht was raised to an archbi∣shopric by Philip II. of Spain. In 1579 it acceded to the alliance of the other provinces, and became a free state. The provincial states are composed of twelve members, and three deputies are sent by them to the assembly of the states-general. The established clergy are divided into three classes, making seventy-nine ministers, of whom a synod is held once a-year at Utrecht. The principal places in the province are,</P>
<P>Utrecht, in Latin Ultrajectum, Trajectum vetus or inferius, or Trajectum ad Rhenum, so called from its antient ferry or passage here over the Rhine, the word being compounded of trecht, which in Dutch signifies a ferry, and oud or olt, i. e. old. It is a fair, large, and populous city, the capital of the province, and the seat of the states, situated nineteen miles from Amsterdam, twenty-five from Rotter∣dam,
<PB N="13" REF="120"/>
and twenty-seven from Leyden. There were several large and rich monasteries, and other reli∣gious houses, here before the Reformation. The churches are magnificent, especially that of St. Martin, formerly the cathedral, and usually called the dome. Over that of St. Salvador or the old minster, where the English have a place of wor∣ship, is a musaeum of all sorts of antiques and rarities. The only defence of the city is a wall on the old canal. Here is a stately town-house, with a commandery of the Tentonic order, and a cele∣brated university, which was founded in 1636, since which it hath flourished greatly, tho' it has not all the privileges of most other universities, being wholly subject to the magistrates of the city. The mall, without the town, having five rows of lofty limes on each side, is very pleasant; and the physic-garden, belonging to the university, is extremely curious. There are five churches here that have chapters; but the members of these purchase their places, of which some cost six or seven thousand guilders. The streams which run through several of the streets, contribute much to the beauty and clean∣liness of the town; and the canal that is cut from the Leck, and passes through it to Amsterdam, will carry ships of any burthen. Pope Adrian VI. was a native of this city. His epitaph is worth inserting: Adrianus Sextus hic situs est, qui nihil sibi in vita infelicius duxit, quam quod imperaret, i. e. Adrian VI. lies here, who reckoned it his greatest misfor∣tune that he should ever have been called to govern∣ment. Here, in 1579, the memorable union was formed between the seven provinces; and, in 1713, the celebrated peace concluded, between France on the one part, and the allies on the other. The pa∣pists have a nominal archbishop of this city; and there is a silk manufactory carried on in it, which employs a number of hands.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="130"/>
Amersfoort, which stands on the river Eem, in a pleasant fertile country, seventeen miles from Utrecht, and six from the Zuyder-see, taking its name from a fort on the river. Large quantities of German goods and commodities are conveyed from hence, down the Eem, to Amsterdam. Its beer and tobacco trade are much declined, but its manufactures of dimity and bombazine thrive apace. It is of no great strength, being command∣ed by a hill called Amersforderberg, upon the edge of which is the pleasant palace of Soedstyk, belong∣ing to the house of Orange. The government here is much like that of Utrecht, and they enjoy much the same privileges.</P>
<P>Rhenen, which takes its name from the Rhine, near which it is situated upon the declivity of a hill, about nineteen miles from Utrecht. Here the un∣fortunate Frederic V. elector Palatine, and king of Bohemia, resided, when he retired with his family into the United Provinces. It is but a small mean place, though it had once counts of its own. From the neighbouring hill of Heymenberg is a most beautiful and extensive prospect.</P>
<P>Wyk-te-Duurstede, situate on the Rhine, twelve miles from Utrecht, where the famous Batavodu∣rum is supposed to have stood. For want of trade, this place decays apace.</P>
<P>Montfoort, the last of the towns that send depu∣ties to the assemblies of the states took its name from a fort erected here, in 1175, by Godfrey, bishop of Rhenen, and is a small place on the Dutch Yssel, six miles from Utrecht.</P>
<P>Amerongen, a handsome country town, be∣longing to the noble family of Rheede.</P>
<P>Leersum, a free lordship, belonging, together with Zuilestein, to the earl of Rochfort, in Eng∣land.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="15" REF="140"/>
<HEAD>FRIESELAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province is called in Dutch Vriesland, and in Latin Frisia, from the Frisians, its antient in∣habitants, whose settlements extended along the German ocean, from the Weser to the Scheld, and were distinguished by the names of East and West Friesland. Of the former, the province we are now describing forms a part, being bounded westward by the Flie; eastward by the provinces of Groningen and Overyssel, and the country of Drenthe; northward by the German ocean; and southward by the Zuyder-see and Overyssel. Its greatest extent from north to south is twenty-seven miles, and from east to west thirty-two. The air and soil here are much like those of Holland. In the lower parts the pastures are very rich, and feed great numbers of large oxen, sheep, cows, and horses. In the higher are some good corn-lands, with turf-grounds, heaths, and woods. There are also many lakes in this province. To guard it against the inundations of the sea, strong high dykes have been erected all along the coast, there being few or no sand-hills. Like Holland, it is intersected with a great number of canals for draining off the water, and facilitating commerce. The inhabitants are still great lovers of liberty, and retain many of the customs of their ancestors. The language of some parts of the country, it is said, comes nearer to the old English than any other in Europe. There are great numbers of Men∣nonites or anabaptists here; Menno Simon, from whom they took their name, having been a native of the province. The linen made here is the finest in Europe: the woollen stuffs also are much esteem∣ed. Frieseland had formerly princes of its own, who had for some time the title of dukes, then of
<PB N="16" REF="150"/>
kings, who were succeeded by podestats, elected from among the people. In 1515, Charles V. re∣duced it under his dominion; but it shook off the yoke under his son Philip, and acceded to the Utrecht alliance. The whole assembly of the states here consists of eighty-two persons, each town and grieteny or district sending two, and the number of towns being eleven, and of the grie∣tenies thirty. To the assembly of the states ge∣neral the province sends five deputies; and here, as in the other provinces, is a provincial court of justice, a chamber of accounts, and a committee of the states. The Calvinist ministers amount to two hundred and seven, who form six classes, and hold a synod, annually and alternately, at the prin∣cipal towns, of which the chief are,</P>
<P>Leuwarden, the capital of the province, and the seat of its chief colleges. It is a large, hand∣some, populous city, about sixty miles from Am∣sterdam to the north-east, and seven from the Ger∣man ocean to the south. Here is a mint, many pa∣laces of the nobility, several churches belonging to different sects, a Jewish synagogue, and a stately town-house. By its navigable canals, the town carries on a good trade with Hamburg, Bremen, Embden, and Holland. In its neighbourhood is Marienburg, a seat belonging to the house of Nas∣sau-Orange, who, being hereditary-stadtholders of the province, resided here till the year 1747, when they were made stadtholders of all the United-Provinces. The fortifications, at present, are much neglected.</P>
<P>Bolswerd, an antient town, five miles from Franeker to the south, and four from the Zuy∣dersee to the east. It was once a Hanse town. The greatest part of the Frieseland baize is wove here.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="160"/>
Franeker, a town about ten miles from Leu∣warden, and four from the Zuyder-see is neither large nor fortified, but has an university, which was opened in the year 1585, and a physic-garden. The salaries of the professors are paid out of the re∣venues of the old monasteries; and the students, neither in this nor the other universities of the pro∣vinces, pay any tax for their wine and beer. Fine blue-glazed tiles and bricks are made here, in large quantities.</P>
<P>Sneek, situated on a lake of the same name, which supplies it with plenty of fish, both for con∣sumption and sale; but otherwise of no note.</P>
<P>Dokkum, about eleven miles from Leuwarden, and about four or five from the North Sea, with which it has a communication by a canal, called Dokkum Diep, through which the largest ships may pass at high water. The town stands in a fruitful country, abounding with corn, pasture, villages, and gentlemen's seats. A great deal of salt is also made at it.</P>
<P>Harlingen, the largest town in the province, next to Leuwarden, standing on the coast of the Zuyder-see, at the mouth of a large canal. Though the harbour is good, yet vessels of great burthen cannot get into it, for want of water, till they are lightened. The admiralty college of Frieseland has its seat here. The town is pretty well fortified towards the land, and the adjacent country may be easily laid under water. Its manufactures are salt, bricks, and tiles.</P>
<P>Staveren, a small town on the Zuyder-see, within three leagues of West-Frieseland, which was for∣merly a place of great trade; but that it hath in a great measure lost, with the loss of its harbour, which hath been almost choaked up with sand. It was antiently long the residence of the Frisian kings, and afterwards a Hanse town.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="170"/>
Stoten, a small town, almost surrounded with lakes, out of one or which issues a navigable stream, which falls into the sea about three miles below the town. Its fortifications are gone to ruin.</P>
<P>Workum, a small town near the Zuyder-see, which is well supplied with fish from the lakes about it, being surrounded with a moat, and having a small harbour on the Zuyder-see. A great deal of lime is made here of muscle shells.</P>
<P>Hindelopen or Hinlopen, a small town, with a harbour on the Zuyder-see, whose inhabitants sub∣sist chiefly by fishing and ship-building, and differ widely, both in their dialect and apparel, from the other Frisians.</P>
<P>Ylst, a small town, and the last of those that send deputies to the states. A great many vessels are built here.</P>
<P>Makkum, a large country town, surrounded with salt-houses, and brick and tile kilns.</P>
<P>Molkweren, a village, whose inhabitants are very singular in their diet, dress, and manner of living; and their houses are placed in such a man∣ner that they form a kind of labyrinth, so that when a stranger enters the village, he must have a guide to help him out of it again.</P>
<P>Wykel, a village in the quarter of Zevenwolden, or the Seven Forests, in which the famous general Coehorn lies interred.</P>
<P>On the coast of Frieseland, in the North Sea, are two islands, viz. Ameland, and Schiermonnigkoog; the former of which is a free independ-nt lordship belonging to the prince of Orange.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>OVER-YSSEL.</HEAD>
<P>This province, in Latin Provincia Transilana, is bounded to the north by Frieseland and Drenthe; to the south by the county of Zutphen, and a part
<PB N="19" REF="180"/>
of Gelderland; to the east by the county of Ben∣theim, and the bishopric of Munster; and to the west by the Zuyder-see. It has the name of Over-Yssel from its situation in respect of Holland, Utrecht, and part of Gelderland. Its greatest extent from north to south, including the territory of Drenthe, is about fifty-seven miles, and from east to west about forty-three. With respect to the soil, it is in general far inferior to the other pro∣vinces, being full of sands, heaths, and marshes; yet, in some places, they have good corn land and pasture. The states consist of the nobilty, and the towns of Deventer, Kampen, and Zwol, in which their annual assemblies are alternately held. The province was long subject to the bishops of Utrecht, till bishop Henry of Bavaria transferred it to Charles V. and, in 1580, it acceded to the union of Utrecht. Here are high tribunals and colleges, answering to those of the other provinces; and five deputies are commonly sent from hence to the assembly of the states-general. The clergy of the established re∣ligion, who are divided into four classes, making in all eighty-four ministers, hold their annual sy∣nods alternately in the chief towns. The most re∣markable places in the province are,</P>
<P>Deventer, in the quarter of Salland, on the Yssel, over which it has a bridge of boats, eight miles from Zutphen, forty-four from Utrecht, and a∣bout eighteen from the Zuyder-see. It is a neat, populous, well built, and well fortified city, con∣taining several churches belonging to different sects, a gymnasium illustre, a mint, and an iron foundery; and five annual fairs are held here. They brew also a pleasant sort of beer, and have a good trade. A∣long the river-side is a fine key, adorned with rows of trees. Deventer was formerly an imperial and Hanse town, and also, for a short time, a bishop's see.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="190"/>
Kampen, a small town, standing also on the Yssel, a little above where it falls into the Zuy∣der-see. Its chief strength lies in its situation, which being in a low ground, the country about it may be easily laid under water. The wooden bridge here is a curious structure, standing upon vast piles, or pieces of timber, drove into the bot∣tom of the river. Kampen has the privilege of a mint, as well as Deventer, and was once also a free imperial city. Its trade is greatly declined, since its harbour became incapable of admitting large vessels.</P>
<P>Zwol or Zwolle, the handsomest and most wealthy town in the Province, situated on the river Aa or Blackwater, by which it has a com∣munication with the Zuyder-see, and a good trade. It stands sixteen miles from Deventer to the north, and is strongly fortified, containing several churches and hospitals, an arsenal, a college, and a granary. Thomas à Kempis was prior of a monastery near this town. The provincial states meet here, at De∣venter, and Kampen, by turns. There is a large district under the jurisdiction of the town.</P>
<P>Hasselt, a small fortified town on the Blackwater, enjoying a good trade.</P>

<HEAD>GRONINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded on the north by the German ocean; on the south by the county of Drenthe; on the east by the bishopric of Munster, and the principality of East-Frieseland; and on the west by the province of Frieseland, from which it is parted by the river Lawers. Its greatest length from south-east to north-west is about forty-seven miles, but its breadth very unequal, the greatest being about thirty-three miles. The air and soil are much the same as those of Frieseland; for here also are rich pastures, large herds of great and small cattle, plenty of sea and river fish, and of turf, with some forests, and corn-land. There are seve∣ral rivers in the province, of which the principal is the Hunse; and a great number of canals and dykes. The states consist of the deputies of the town of Groningen, and the Ommeland, or cir∣cumjacent country, and hold their assemblies al∣ways in the town of Groningen. The province had antiently governors, under the title of bur∣graves; but their power being limited, the people enjoyed great privileges. Afterwards, it became subject to the bishop of Utrecht; but shook off his yoke, at last, and recovered its liberty. In 1536, however, it submitted to Charles V. and, in 1579, acceded to the union of Utrecht. The colleges are much the same here as in the other provinces, viz. the provincial states, council of state-provincial tribunal, and chamber of accompts. Six deputies are sent from hence to the states-gene∣ral. Or the established clergy, there are an hun∣dred and sixty ministers, which form seven classes, whose annual synod is held, by turns, at Groningen
<PB N="22" REF="210"/>
and Appingedam. The principal places in the province are,</P>
<P>Groningen, the capital, twenty-seven miles from Leuwarden, fifty-eight from Deventer, twenty-four from Embden, eighty from Amsterdam, and twelve from the nearest shore of the German ocean, at the conflux of several rivulets, which form the Hunse and Fivel. Ships of considerable burthen can come up to the city, in consequence of which it enjoys a pretty good trade. It was former∣ly very strong, but its fortifications are now much neglected. The university here was founded in 1615, and is well endowed out of the revenues of the antient monasteries. The town, which was formerly one of the Hanse, and has still great privi∣leges, is large and populous, being the seat of the high-colleges, and containing three spacious market-places, and twenty-seven streets, in which are many fine houses, besides churches, and other public structures. By the river Fivel, and the Eems, it has a communication with Westphalia. In 1672, it made such a gallant resistance against the bishop of Munster, that he is said to have lost ten thousand men before it. Rodolphus Agricola and Veselius, two of the most learned men of the age in which they lived, were born here. Under the jurisdiction of this city is a considerable district, called the Gerecht.</P>
<P>Dam or Appinge-Dam, an open town on the Fi∣vel or Damster-Diep, not far from the sea.</P>
<P>Winscholen, a small but well fortified town, on the Rensel.</P>
<P>Delfzyl, a fort at the mouth of the Eems, which is reckoned the key to Groningen and Frieseland.</P>
<P>Bourtang, a strong fort in the middle of a large morass.</P>
<P>Soltkany, a large fort, situated at the mouth of the Hunse.</P>

<HEAD>The County of DRENTHE.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Drenthe is bounded to the north by the province of Groningen; to the south by the county of Bentheim and Over-Yssel; to the west by Friesland; and to the east by Groningen and the bishopric of Munster. The south parts are full of marshes; of the others, some are over-run with wood, and some yield good pasture, wheat, and rye. What seems a little odd, we are told that the wheat harvest here always begins on a par∣ticular day, and ends on another. The states con∣sist of the nobles and freeholders: of the former who sit and vote, there are eighteen, and of free∣holders thirty-six. The assembly of the states is held annually at Assen, and the president is always nominated by the stadtholder; but no deputies are sent from hence to the states-general, though the country contributes one per cent. to all the public expences of the provinces, and is under their pro∣tection. Besides the states, here is a sovereign court of justice, which decides without appeal, and a college, which puts in execution the resolu∣tions of the diet. Of the established clergy there are three classes, who have a synod yearly at Assen. The only places of any note in this country are,</P>
<P>Assen, the capital, which though small is well built, standing near the centre of the county, and being the seat of the high colleges.</P>
<P>Koevorden, a small place on the borders of the county of Bentheim, but as strongly fortified, per∣haps, as any in Europe. Besides, it has a castle also strongly fortified, and the works of both are kept in repair at the expence of the states-general. Koevorden is called the key of Overyssel, Friesland, and Groningen. In the county of Drenthe there is another small town called Meppel, two forts
<PB N="24" REF="230"/>
called ter Hollen, and Volter-Schanze, and a great many villages.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GENERALITE LANDS.</HEAD>
<P>By the Generalitè Lands are meant those parts of the divided Netherlands that belong to the states-general, or the united provinces in general. Though these territories are not members of the state, yet they retain all the privileges they en∣joyed, when they fell under the dominion of the republic. The hereditary stadtholder is governor-general of them all. There also are some gover∣nors of fortresses; but the power of these is limited to the soldiery. The high tribunals for the admi∣nistration of justice in the Generalitè Lands sit at the Hague, Middleburg, and Venlo. The esta∣blished religion is Calvinism, as in the provinces, but all sects are tolerated. These lands consist of a part of the duchies of Brabant and Limburg, of the upper quarter of Gelderland, and of Flanders. The principal places belonging to the states in the duchy of Brabant are,</P>
<P>Bois le Duc, in Latin Silva Ducis, situated at the conflux of the Aa and Dommel, which, when united, are called the Diest, twenty miles from Breda, forty from Antwerp, and twenty-six from Utrecht. The town is strong both by nature and art; besides the adjacent country may be laid un∣der water. The majority of the inhabitants are Roman catholics. Their trade and shipping are considerable, and there are manufactures of linen and woollen cloth, cutlery wares, and needles. The town, which contains several churches and mass-houses, a gymnasium illustre, and citadel, took its name from its having been at first built in a wood, cleared and cut down for that purpose, by order of Godfrey III. duke of Brabant. It was
<PB N="25" REF="240"/>
once a bishopric; and the cathedral, which is now in the hands of the protestants, is one of the most magnificent in the Netherlands. Before the Re∣formation there were sixteen monasteries of both sexes here. In the district to which the town gives name, are the towns of Osterwyk, Tilborg, Box∣tel, Einhoven, Girschot, Helmond, Os, Grave, and Ravestein. The Grave is strongly fortified, and belongs to the prince of Orange, who is also proprietor of the barony of Kuik, and other estates in the district. Ravestein, with the lordship to which it gives name, are held as fiefs of the states-general, by the elector-palatine; and Hel∣mond is the property of the house of Aremberg. In the same district is also a lordship belonging to the Teutonic order, and two rich convents, which, by the indulgence of the states, are suffered to re∣main and enjoy their ancient revenues.</P>
<P>Breda, situate at the conflux of the Merk and the Aa, which, after their junction, are naviga∣ble from hence to the German ocean, fourteen miles from Dort to the south, twenty from Bois le Duc to the west, and twenty-five from Antwerp to the north-east. It is pretty well built and forti∣fied, and a part of the adjacent country may be laid under water. Here are several squares, one of which is delightfully planted with trees, a moated castle, and several churches; but the trade and manufactures of the town are greatly declined. The states have been possessed of it ever since the year 1637. Here king Charles II. resided a short time before he set out, when invited by his sub∣jects to take possession of his kingdoms, and from hence was dated his famous declaration. Here also, in 1669, the famous treaty of peace was concluded between the said king Charles, Lewis XIV. of France, and the states-general, under the media∣tion of the king of Sweden. The neighbourhood
<PB N="26" REF="250"/>
of the town is very pleasant; among other agreea∣ble objects, are several woods, of which one is cut out into beautiful walks and vistas. The town gives name to a barony, and both belong to the prince of Orange, under the sovereignty of the states. In the barony are eighteen country towns and villages, of which the principal are William∣stadt and Steenbergen, both well fortified, and garrisoned by the states-general, as well as Breda.</P>
<P>Bergen-op-Zoom, a very strong fortress, which, by the rivulet or canal of Zoom, has a communi∣cation with the eastern Scheld, standing nineteen miles from Antwerp, seventeen from Breda, and twenty-six from Middleburg in Zealand. All the passes to it are guarded by forts, lines, redoubts, and batteries; besides the adjacent country may be laid under water, and supplies of men, provisions, and ammunition thrown into it from Zealand, by means of the Scheld, which the besiegers cannot prevent, till they are masters of all the forts upon that river. It belongs, together with the marqui∣sate to which it gives name, to the elector-pala∣tine, under the sovereignty of the states-general, who always keep a good garrison in the town. In 1747 the French made themselves masters of it by surprize, as was said, but by treachery, as was suspected, after a siege of ten weeks. In 1749, however, it was restored, though in a very ruinous condition. It contains about eleven hundred houses, and has a good harbour, defended on both sides by strong forts. On the Scheld, in this mar∣quisate, are also the strong forts of Lillo, Kruiss∣chanz, and Frederic-Henry.</P>
<P>Maestricht, in Latin Trajectum ad Mosam, i. e. the Ford, or Ferry, on the Maes, which is also the signification of the Dutch, Flemish, or German name, as being compounded of Maes and tricht or trecht, a corruption of trajectum, signifying a ford or ferry.
<PB N="27" REF="260"/>
It is one of the strongest fortresses belonging to the republic, standing twelve miles from Leige, and forty-eight from Brussels. The states-general, to whom it was yielded up by the treaty of Munster, are sovereigns of it, jointly with the bishop of Liege, as having succeeded to the rights of the dukes of Brabant. There are many popish con∣vents in it, and churches belonging to different sects, and a strong garrison is maintained by the states; the magistracy consists partly of Cal∣vinists and partly of Roman catholics, and the latter must be natives of the bishopric of Liege; in a hill in the neighbourhood, is a horizontal quarry full of long winding passages, in which, in time of war, the country people secure their cattle and valuable effects; forty thousand men, it is said, might lodge in it conveniently enough. The town contains about three thousand houses, and thirteen thousand inhabitants, besides the garrison. There is a Calvinist gymnasium and grammar∣school here, the masters and professors of which are paid by the states; a Jesuit's college, a com∣mandery of the Teutonic order, a stately town∣house, and governor's house, with other public buildings.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In that part of the Duchy of LIMBURG, or of the Country beyond the MAES, belonging to the States, the only places worth mentioning are,</HEAD>
<P>Valkenburg, in Latin Falconis Mons, i. e. the Falcon's Mountain, or Castle, which stands on the river Geul, and, though but a small open place, is the capital of a county. By a particular privi∣lege it is exempted from all taxes.</P>
<P>Dalem, otherwise called 'S Gravendal, a small town on the river Berwine. It gives name to a
<PB N="28" REF="270"/>
county, and its inhabitants are also exempt from all taxes.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In that part of the Upper Quarter of GELDER∣LAND belonging to the States, the places of any note are,</HEAD>
<P>Venlo, a strong town on the Maes, in which are several convents and churches belonging to the Ro∣man catholics, who constitute the majority of the inhabitants. Here also one of the high tribunals for appeals in the Generalitè-lands has its seat. Goods from the duchy of Juliers being shipped off at Venlo for the Seven Provinces, or conveyed over the Maes into Brabant, most of the inhabi∣tants are boatmen, carriers, or porters. At about two musket-shots from it is a fort called St. Michael, and on an island near it in the Maes, is a strong bastion.</P>
<P>Stevens-Waerd, a considerable fort on an island of the same name in the Maes, built with a view to preserve the communication between Venlo and Maestricht.</P>
<P>Montfoort, a country-town, giving name to a lordship.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In that part of FLANDERS belonging to the STATES are the following places worth mentioning, viz.</HEAD>
<P>Sluys, surnamed in Flanders, and in French called L'Ecluse, situated on an arm of the German ocean; but of late the harbour hath been so choaked up with sand, that it admits only small vessels. Its forti∣fications, natural and artificial, are very strong, and nothing but a superior force at sea can prevent its receiving supplies from thence; the air, how∣ever, is so bad, that the garrison must be changed every year. All the other Dutch governors in
<PB N="29" REF="280"/>
Flanders are subordinate to the governor of Sluys. Charles VI. king of France, in 1386, fitted out in this harbour a very formidable fleet against the Eng∣lish, consisting of nine hundred ships of war, furnished with an infinite number of machines, and a wooden town, which could easily be taken to pieces, and put together again, for sheltering the soldiers on their descent: but this prodigious armament was dispersed by a violent storm.</P>
<P>Aardenborg, and Oestberg, two small towns on canals, that communicate with that arm of the sea on which Sluys stands, and which is called the Zwin.</P>
<P>Ysendyk, a small but well fortified town on the Blik-water, which is a bay formed by the West Scheld.</P>
<P>Biervliet, a small town on the West-Scheld. William Beukelszoon, who first taught the Dutch how to gut and cure herrings, was a native of this town.</P>
<P>Hulst, a strong fortified town, situated in a fruitful plain, which may be laid under water. The commodity it chiefly deals in is corn, having a ca∣nal, or harbour, which communicates with the West-Scheld. The forts and lines by which it is surrounded, render the approaches to it very diffi∣cult; but the air is none of the best, and most of the inhabitants are papists. It gives name to a bailiage, which is of considerable extent.</P>
<P>Axel, a small, but strong town, in an island sormed by the West-Scheld.</P>
<P>Sas van Ghent, a small, but strong town, on a bay of the West-Scheld. Its name signifies the sluice of Ghent; for the inhabitants having dug a canal from hence to that city, erected a sluice here for keeping up the waters. About a mile from the town is a fort called St. Antony's, which was built for the defence of the sluice.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="290"/>
Philippine, a small but well fortified town, on the western arm of the Scheld, called Brackman∣water. It had its name from Philip II. king of Spain, who caused it to be built.</P>
<P>Fort St. Donnas, not far from Sluys.</P>
<P>In this part of Flanders is the island of Kadsand, or Catsand, which, as well as many other places whose names begin with Cat, is supposed to have been so called from the Catti, who formerly inha∣bited part of the Netherlands. It lies over-against Sluys, and is very fertile. To defend it against the sea, to which it is much exposed in stormy weather, strong dykes have been erected, and are kept in repair at a vast expence.</P>
<P>We shall give an account of the barrier towns, viz. Namur, Tournay, Manen, Furnes, Warndon, Den∣dermonde, Ruremonde, and Fort Knoque, in our description of the Austrian Netherlands, only ob∣serving here, that they are all garrisoned by the states, except Dendermonde and Ruremonde; of the for∣mer of which one half of the garrison consists of Dutchmen, and the other of Imperialists; but that Ruremonde is entirely Austrian. Of the Dutch garrisons, the states nominate the governors, and other officers, but they must take an oath to maintain the towns for the house of Austria. Both parties contribute to the expences of the garrisons, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>AUSTRIAN NETHERLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Austrian Netherlands consist of the greatest part of the duchies of Brabant, Lim∣burg, and Luxemburg, with a part of that of Gueldres, and of the counties of Flanders, Hen∣negau, and Namur. The Netherlands formerly made a part of the circle of Burgundy, the whole of which once belonged to the house of Austria, and on the death of Charles V. devolved to the Burgundian Spanish line of that house, but was all afterwards lost, except the abovementioned coun∣tries, which, on the death of Charles II. king of Spain, fell to the German line of the Austrian fa∣mily. These Austrian Netherlands are still con∣sidered as a circle of the empire, of which the arch∣ducal house, as being sovereign of the whole, is the sole director, and summoning prince. This circle contributes its share to the imposts of the empire, and sends an envoy to the diet, but is not subject to the judicatories of the empire. It is wholly catho∣lic, and under a governor-general appointed by the court of Vienna, who, at present, is his serene high∣ness prince Charles of Lorrain, brother to the late, and uncle to the present emperor.</P>
<P>We now proceed to a more particular discription of the several countries mentioned above.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BRABANT.</HEAD>
<P>Brabant is bounded to the east by the bishopric of Liege; to the west by Flanders and Seeland, or Zealand; to the south by Hennegau and Na∣mur; and to the north and east by that part of Brabant which belongs to the United-Provinces. The air of this country is good, and the soil fruit∣ful,
<PB N="32" REF="310"/>
especially in flex. It is watered by several rivers, the chief of which is the Demer, or Rupel. There are two fine canals in it, one of which joins the Senne and the Rupel, and cost eight hundred thousand florins; the other runs from Louvain to the Rupel. Between Louvain and Brussels is a fine stone causeway, and another reaching from Lou∣vain to Thienen and Leige. The southern part, called Walloon-Brabant, is mountainous, but not unfruitful. In Austrian-Brabant are reckoned nineteen walled towns, besides a great many bo∣roughs and villages. The states of the province consist of the clergy, nobility, and representatives of the chief towns. These states meet four times a year at Brussels. In them, and the viceroy, the legislative power, and that of levying money, is vested, but the whole assembly must be unanimous in passing an act. They appoint a kind of com∣mittee, of two clergymen and two noblemen, to meet daily during their recess. There are four he∣reditary officers of state for this province, viz. the seneschal, the chamberlain, the marshal, and the gui∣don: besides which, there also is a great huntsman, a great falconer, a great forester, a chief justice in eyre, and a master of the wolf-hunters. The high council of Brabant, which is divided into two cham∣bers, or courts, and judges, in the last resort all the causes of the provinces, is held at Mechlin. The Roman catholic is the only religion of this country; and the number and opulence of the ec∣clesiastics is very great. At Mechlin is the see of an archbishop, to whom are subject the prelates of Antwerp, Ghent, Boisleduc, Bruges, Ipres, and Ruremond. In the archbishopric are fourreen col∣legiate churches, and two hundred and three clois∣ters. This, with many other countries, came to the house of Austria by the marriage of Maria, daughter of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy,
<PB N="33" REF="320"/>
with Maximilian, archduke of Austria. For the education of youth, and advancement of learning, here are several schools and gymnasia, besides the university of Louvain. The principal manufac∣tures both of this and the other provinces of the Netherlands, consist of fine lawns, cambrics, lace, and tapestry, with which they carry on a very ad∣vantageous traffic. The arms of this duchy are a lion, or, in a fleld, sable. As to the character of Brabanders, and other Flemings, those of the Au∣strian and Dutch Netherlands very much resemble, both in their manners and persons, the Germans and Dutch; as those of the French endeavour to imi∣tate that nation. The language called the Walloon, which is generally spoken here, and in the other provinces, by the common people, is a dialect of the German, with a mixture of French and Spanish; but the French language is understood and spoken by persons of rank all over the Netherlands, and also by many of the common sort, especially in French Flanders. Those on the frontiers of Hol∣land speak Dutch.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Austrian Brabant is divided into several quarters. In that of LOUVAIN the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Louvain, in Latin, Louvanium and Lovania, situated on the Dyle, thirteen miles from Brussels towards the east. It claims the title of capital of Brabant, which, however, Brussels now enjoys, be∣ing the seat of the governor-general, and of all the courts of justice. Louvain is very antient, having had its rise from a castle built by the emperor Arnulphus, to secure the country against the in∣roads of the Normans. That castle was afterwards long the residence of the dukes of Brabant, and in it the emperor Charles V. and his sisters, were educated. Many assemblies of the states also have
<PB N="34" REF="330"/>
been kept in it. The churches and cloisters are very numerous and fine, both within and without the town, which is very large, but not populous; for there are many meadows, vineyards, gardens, and orchards, within the walls. The stadthouse and the church of St. Peter, are very beautiful. In the beginning of the fourteenth century the manufacture of woollen cloths was so great here, that there were above four thousand woollen-dra∣pers, and above one hundred and fifty thousand weavers in the city: when they went home from their work, a great beil was rung to give notice to the mothers to keep their children within doors, lest they should be trampled under feet by that crowd of workmen; but in 1380 the journeymen weavers, and other tradesmen, revolted, took up arms, threw seventeen of their magistrates out of the windows of the town-house, and laid waste all Brabant: at last, however, they were sub∣dued, some of their ringleaders executed, and most of the others banished. Of these, many re∣tired to England, and were kindly received. The trade of Louvain hath ever since been upon the decline, and at present is inconsiderable, consisting chiefly in the excellent beer which is brewed there, of which a great quantity is sent to the neighbour∣ing cities, especially to Brussels. With a view to restore this city to its former lustre, an university was founded in it in 1426, by John IV. duke of Brabant, which enjoys great privileges, granted to it both by the popes and dukes. There are above forty colleges; and in the hall, where the public exercises are performed, are three spacious rooms, where lectures are read every morning in divinity, law, and physic, to which the scholars, in every college, may resort. The Hol∣landers have a college here for their Roman catho∣lics: the English, one of Augustine monks: and
<PB N="35" REF="340"/>
the Irish one of Dominicans, and another of Re∣collects. Nothing, however, is more certain, than that true philosophy and divinity are little known or valued here; which will always be the case, wherever colleges are in the hands of monks and ecclesiastics, those especially of the church of Rome. In order to make the sciences flourish, and to encourage the learned, pope Sixtus IV. granted to the university in 1483, the privilege of presenting to all the livings in the Netherlands; by virtue of which privilege, the professors and stu∣dents of Louvain are still intitled to all the pre∣bends and rectories of this country. The church belonging to the Jesuits convent, would pass for a beauty even in Rome, and the pulpit of oak is the finest piece of that kind in the world. A∣mong the nunneries, the convent for the English is the finest in the Low-Countries, and very richly endowed. This city boasts that it was never taken by force of arms: in 1710, indeed, the French entered it, but it was by surprize; and they were so roughly handled by the inhabitants, that they were obliged to retire in disorder. To reward their bravery, Charles, then stiled king of Spain, and afterwards emperor, sent them a golden key, which is still kept in the town-house. However, in 1746, the French not only made themselves masters of the town, but kept it till 1749.</P>
<P>Park, an abbey of Praemonstratenses, and one of the finest in the Netherlands.</P>
<P>Tienen, in Latin, Thenae, or Thenae in Mon∣tibus, in French, Tillemont, and also Tirlemont, seven miles from Louvain towards the east, on the river Ghete. This was once one of the most considerable cities in Brabant, but is now in a de∣clining state. There are two collegiate churches in it: the canons of one of them may marry; but if they become widowers, they are not allowed to
<PB N="36" REF="350"/>
wed again, unless they resign their prebends. No man has yet been able to know what their year∣ly income amounts to; it seems they take an oath never to reveal it. They must be all natives of Tirlemont, and the prebends are all in their own gift. Here are also six monasteries, and eight nunneries.</P>
<P>Heverle, a small town near Louvain, with a fine castle, belonging to the duke of Aremberg and Arschot, who is lord of this manor, and here∣ditary chamberlain of Brabant.</P>
<P>Limale, or Lismale, a fine borough in Walloon Brabant.</P>
<P>Gemblours, a small town, six miles from Na∣mur, belonging to the Benedictine abbey here. It is famous for the celebrated monk Sigebertus, author of the Chronicon Gimblacense, well known to the learned; and for a victory obtained by don John of Austria over the army of the states-gene∣ral, commanded by Anthony de Coignies. In the abbey king William took up his head-quarters, during a great part of his wars with France: this abbey is an exempt, and the abbot is stiled count of Gemblours, and reckoned the first of that rank of Brabant.</P>
<P>Ramillies, a village, near eleven miles from Namur, where, in the year 1706, the duke of Marlborough gained a great victory over the French.</P>
<P>Leeuwe, a small but strong town on the river Ghete, seven miles from Tirlemont, situated in a marshy ground, that renders it almost inaccessible; but the air is so bad, that the sovereigns of the country used formerly to banish hither those they had a mind to punish, and such as are not used to it cannot live long in it, without falling sick.</P>
<P>Landen, a little decayed town, seven miles from Tirlemont, but famous for the bloody battle fought
<PB N="37" REF="360"/>
near it, in 1693, between the French, command∣ed by the dukes of Luxemberg, Villeroy, and Berwick, and the confederates, under the command of king William and the elector of Bavaria, in which the French got the day.</P>
<P>Diest, a small town on the Demer, thirteen miles from Louvain, formerly noted for its woollen ma∣nufactures, which are now much declined. It has a great fair for horses every Ash Wednesday. In the year 1490 it devolved to the house of Nassau, and belongs at present to the hereditary stadtholder of the United-Provinces.</P>

<P>Scherpen-heuvel, in French Montaigu, in Latin Monacutus, or Aspricollis, so called from its situ∣ation on the top of an hill, is a small, but regu∣larly built town, in the form of a heptagon, not far from Diest.</P>

<HEAD>In the Quarter or Territory of BRUSSELS, the prin∣cipal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Brussels, which gives name to the territory, and is the capital not only of Brabant but of the Ne∣therlands, tho' only the second in rank. It stands on the little river Senne, on the brow of a hill, thirteen miles from Louvain to the west. No city in Europe makes a finer figure at a distance, except Naples and Genoa; but, like them, it falls short of one's expectation when it is entered, being all up hill and down. The city is about seven miles in
<PB N="38" REF="370"/>
circumference, and consequently too large to hold out a long siege, has seven gates, with large suburbs, and is encompassed with a double brick∣wall and ditches. It is very populous and well built, and has seven squares, all very fine, particu∣larly the great square or market-place, which is, perhaps, the finest in Europe. Around it are the halls of the different trades, the fronts of which are adorned with sculpture and gilding, and Latin inscriptions; one quarter being entirely taken up by the town-house, a noble pile of building, in which are the apartments where the states of Bra∣bant meet, finely adorned with tapestry in gilt frames, and original paintings. On the top of the steeple, which is three hundred and sixty-four feet high, is the statue of St. Michael killing the dra∣gon, of gilt copper, seventeen foot high, which serves for a weather-cock. The public buildings in general, particularly the palaces and courts of the several princes, counts, and other persons of distinction, together with the churches and cloisters, are large and magnificent. Behind the imperial palace, that stood in the highest part of the city, but was burnt down not many years ago, is a park, well stocked with deer, and planted with trees like that of St. James's at London, for the inhabitants to walk in. At the farther end of it is a fine plea∣sure-house, built by the emperor Charles V. after his abdication. Of the other palaces, those of the prince de la Tour and Taxis, and of the English earl of Ailesbury are very fine; and of the gardens, those of the duke of Bournonville, are the most delightful. In all the palaces are collections of ori∣ginal paintings by the most eminent masters, both Italian and Flemish. The arsenal is well worth seeing on account of the curious antique arms. The opera-house, which is certainly the noblest and largest in Europe, is built after the Italian
<PB N="39" REF="380"/>
manner, with rows of lodges or closets, in most of which are chimneys. The lodge belonging to the prince de Ligne is hung with looking glasses, in which, while he sits by the fire and drinks a bottle, or eats a supper, he may see the whole representa∣tion, without being seen by the actors or company. Four fine pictures of the markets of Brussels by Rubens and Synder, which cost the dukes of St. Pierre forty thousand florins, and for which the French king, Lewis XIV. offered great sums, are now in the possession of the earl of Orford. This city is extremely well provided with water, having twenty public fountains, adorned with statues at the corners of the most public streets. The lower part of the city is called the Rivage, and is cut in∣to canals, which communicate with the great canal, extending from Brussels to the Scheld, fifteen miles. By this canal, which was finished in 1361, and cost the city eight hundred thousand florins, a person may sail from Brussels to the North Sea; and large covered boats called treck-schuyts actually go twice a day to Antwerp and back again. Each boat is drawn by one horse only, which goes a gentle pace at the rate of three miles an hour, and the fare is about two-pence farthing for every hour. Along the canals, both within and without the city, are fine walks planted with trees, as in Holland, and also on the walls. Of the churches the most remarkable is that of St. Gudula, which is an old Gothic building on the outside, but finely adorned within. In the choir are several fine monuments of illustrious princes, and all around it are a great many pretty chapels, in one of which they worship three hosties, which, they say, were stabbed in the year 1369, by a Jew, and bled. These are exposed every festival, in a chalice, richly set with diamonds, and on the Sunday after the 13th of July, there is a yearly procession in memory of this stabbing,
<PB N="40" REF="390"/>
when the hosties are carried round the city, embel∣lished with all manner of precious stones, and at∣tended by all the clergy, secular and regular, the magistrates, the courts of justice, and even by the governor of the province. The chapel where they are kept, is all of marble, and the altar of solid silver. Among the cloisters of all orders here, there are two English; the one of Dominican la∣dies, founded by cardinal Howard in the reign of Charles II. of which a lady of the house of Norfolk is always abbess; the other is of Benedictine nuns. The beguinage here is like a little town, surrounded with a wall and ditch, and divided into pretty lit∣tle streets, where every beguine has her apartment. The number of them generally amounts to seven or eight hundred, and sometimes more; they are governed by four matrons, whom they chuse out of their own body, and have a confessor appointed by the bishop of Antwerp, and a very fine church. Here, and in all other great towns of the Nether∣lands, is a public office for lending money, at a mo∣derate interest, upon pledges: it is called the Mount of Piety, and was established by the arch∣duke Albert, and Isabella his wife, in 1617: there are private passages for going in, without being seen from the public streets. This city is noted for seven grand streets, seven parish churches, seven patrician families, out of which the magistracy is elected, seven large squares, seven midwives, li∣cenced and sworn by the senate, and seven gates, each leading to different places of recreation and exercise; viz. one to a place proper for fowling, an∣other to one for fishing, a third to one for hunting, a fourth to pleasant fields, a fifth to pasture-grounds, a sixth to springs and vineyards, and a seventh to gardens. Brussels is said to have entertained, at one time, seven crowned heads, besides the dukes of Savoy and Lorrain, with nine thousand horse be∣longing
<PB N="41" REF="400"/>
to their retinues. The inns, or eating∣houses here, are equal to any in the world: a stranger may dine any time betwixt twelve, and three, on seven or eight dishes of meat, for less than a shilling English. The wines also are very good and cheap; and for six-pence English, by the hour, you may have a coach to carry you wherever you please. At the gate of Brussels be∣gins the famous wood of Sogne, of great extent, out of which the inhabitants are allowed to cut a great quantity of wood for fuel every year, and as fast as the trees are cut down, fresh ones are planted in their room, by which means the forest will continue for ever for the benefit of the poor. This city is the seat of the council of state, the privy-council, the council of finances, the war-council, and the chamber of accompts of the chancery and foedal court of Brabant, the court of the grand forester, and a particular chamber of accompts for the pro∣vince of Brabant. The trade of this city consists in camblets, laces, and tapestries manufactured here, and sent all over Europe. In the year 1695 it suffered much by a French bombardment: in 1706 the allies made themselves masters of it; and the French in 1746. Here is a statue of gilt marble erected by the com∣pany of brewers to prince Charles of Lorrain, go∣vernor-general of the Austrian Netherlands.</P>
<P>Vilverden, a poor paltry town, seven miles from Brussels to the north, but strong both by nature and art. It stands on the canal of Brussels, has an old castle, in which are kept the archives of Bra∣bant, and is the capital of a district, containing eighteen villages besides. Here it was that the fa∣mous William Tindal, who first translated the New Testament into English, suffered martyrdom, contrary to the law of nations, he being a subject of England.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="410"/>
Nivelle, the chief town of Walloon Brabant, lying on the Thiene, fifteen miles from Brussels to the south. Here are several convents both of monks and nuns, and two collegiate churches, be∣sides others. The chapter of one of these, viz, St. Gertrad, consists of canonesses, who must all be noble by four descents, both by the father and mother's side. The abbess is stiled princess of Ni∣velle, and is both spiritual and temporal lady of the city, which is a pretty considerable one, and of its district, which contains, besides, seventeen vil∣lages. The town enjoys large privileges, and has a flourishing manufacture of fine linen.</P>
<P>Seneffe, a large village, noted for a battle fought near it in 1674, between the Dutch, under the prince of Orange, and the French, under the command of the prince of Condé. Both sides claimed the victory.</P>

<P>Affligem, an abbey of Benedictines, the abbot of which is always archbishop of Mechlin, and the first prelate of the duchy of Brabant.</P>
<P>Besides those we have mentioned, there are vast numbers of small towns, villages, and cloisters in the territory of Brussels.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the County and Quarter of ANTWERP the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Antwerp, which gives name to the territory, otherwise called the margravate or marquisate of the holy Roman empire, and by others, more pro∣perly, the marquisate of Antwerp. This city, stiled by the natives Anwerpen, by the French Anvers, by the Spaniards Amberes, and in Latin Antverpia, and Andoverpum, lies in a low marshy ground on the Scheld, twenty-five miles from
<PB N="43" REF="420"/>
Brussels to the north. It is the third city in rank in Brabant, large and well-built, containing twenty-two squares, and above two hundred streets, all straight and broad, especially that called the Mere, in which six coaches can go a-breast. Most of the houses are of free stone, and have an air of antiquity, being high, with courts before and gar∣dens behind. At the head of the Mere is a cruci∣fix of brass thirty-three feet high. The cathedral dedicated to our Lady, the stadt-house, and the exchange, are magnificent structures: the latter is the first building of that kind in Europe, and on its model the exchanges of London and Am∣sterdam are built: its pillars are all of blue mar∣ble, and carved, but all in a different manner. The exchange cost the city three hundred thousand crowns. Antwerp, towards the end of the fifteenth century, was one of the most celebrated towns that ever existed. The Scheld, on which it stands, being twenty feet deep at low-water, and rising twenty feet more at flood, ships of the greatest burden came up to the keys, as in the river Thames at London; but when the United-Pro∣vinces formed themselves into a free state, after having shaken off the yoke of Spain, they got the entire command of the navigation of the Scheld, which ruined the trade of Antwerp, and trans∣ferred it to Amsterdam: this made the inhabi∣tants turn their heads to painting, jewelling, and banking, which they have continued to this day, with great success and reputation; for at Antwerp bills of exchange may be negociated for any sum to any part of Europe; and in the war before the last, two brothers of the name of de Koning, paid the one the army of France, and the other that of the confederates. Besides, here is a fine manufac∣ture of tapestry and lace; and, for the promoting of trade, an insurance-company has been erected.
<PB N="44" REF="430"/>
This city is the see of a bishop, who, as abbot of St. Bernard, is the second prelate in Brabant. The bishopric is of great extent, and the cathedral a most noble pile, with one of the finest steeples in the world. The emperor Charles V. when he made his entry into Antwerp, said it ought to be put in a case, and shewed only once a-year for a rarity. The house of the hanse-towns, built when the city was in its flourishing condition, is a stately build∣ing, with magazines above for dry goods, and cellars below for wet, and, in the middle, sto∣ry were three hundred lodging rooms for mer∣chants; but now it is turned to a horse bar∣rack. There is a market here called the Fri∣day's market, because it is held every Friday, where all sorts of houshold-goods, pictures, and jewels, are sold by auction. No city in the Ne∣therlands has so many and so fine churches as this. Many of them, particularly the cathedral and Jesuit's church, are adorned with paintings, by Sir Peter Paul Rubens, who was a native of this city; and by Quintin Masseys, who is said to have been a blacksmith, but that having fallen in love with a painter's daughter, and been told by her fa∣ther, when he asked her of him in marriage, that he would have none but a painter for his son-in-law, he went to Italy to study painting, and, in a few years, returned so eminent in his new profession, that he found no difficulty in obtaining the father's consent. He is interred at the entry of the cathe∣dral, where his effigy is put up, with an inscription signifying, that conjugal love made an Apelles of a blacksmith. The above-mentioned Jesuits church is extremely magnificent, and the chapel of the Virgin, joining to it, still more so. Among the cloisters the most remarkable are, the noble and rich abbey of St. Michael, on the banks of the Scheld, the apartments of which are truly royal,
<PB N="45" REF="440"/>
and in which all sovereign princes that pass this way, actually lodge; and the English nunnery, of the order of St. Teresa, the nuns of which never wear linen, nor eat flesh, and lie upon straw: the grates of the convent are so dismal, that it looks like a prison. As to the fortifications of the city, it is environed with a fine wall, planted with rows of trees on each side, with walks between, broad enough for two coaches to go a-breast, being also defended by a very strong, large, regular citadel, in form of a pentagon, erected by the duke of Al∣va, in 1568, which commands the town, and the neighbouring country. The magistracy of this city is chosen only out of the seven patrician fami∣lies, and consists of two burgomasters, and eighteen echevins, besides inferior magistrates. Among the privileges granted to it by its princes, there is one by which every person born in it is a citizen, tho' both his father and mother were foreigners. When the duke of Alençon, brother to the French king Henry III. whom the states-general had appointed governor of the Netherlands, made an attempt, in 1582, to surprize this city, the citizens defended themselves so bravely, that they drove the French out of the town, killed fifteen hundred of them, of which three hundred were noblemen, and took two thousand, with the loss of only eighty men: the duke, having by this step lost the confidence of the states, retired to France, where he soon died of grief. The siege which this city held out, in 1585, against the duke of Parma, governor of the Ne∣therlands, is one of the most renowned in history. The siege lasted a twelvemonth; and he never could have succeeded, had it not been for the stu∣pendous bridge he laid over the Scheld to carry on his attack. Here the celebrated geographer Abra∣ham Ortelius was born. In the noble steeple of the cathedral mentioned above, are thirty-three
<PB N="46" REF="450"/>
bells and two chimes, a clock, whose diameter is thirty feet, and circumference ninety, with a cross at the top fifteen feet high.</P>
<P>Turnhout, a small city, which belonged to Wil∣liam III. king of Great-Britain, and prince of Orange; but, after his death, was adjudged, by the sovereign-feodal court of Brabant, to the house of Brandenburgh, but on condition that they should pay an hundred thousand florins to the prince of Orange. In 1753, the king of Prussia ceded it to the house of Austria, on which it was united to the duchy of Brabant, and, in behalf of Duke Telles de Sylva Tarauca, was raised to a duchy.</P>
<P>Lier, a small but very strong town, ten miles from Antwerp to the south-east. Here is a great fair for cattle most of the summer. Here also an excellent sort of white beer is brewed, and fine lace made. Among the other convents and nun∣neries, there is one of barefooted English Carme∣lite nuns. The monastery of the Carthusians is the richest and largest in the Netherlands, the circumference of the walls being a full English mile. The monks of this convent are allowed to dine to∣gether every Wednesday, and to go abroad and take the air, during six weeks in summer, a liberty not indulged to other monasteries of that order. This town is generally inhabited by persons of fashion, who have left off trade.</P>
<P>Besides the above-mentioned places, there are many others within the territory of Antwerp, which, though not surrounded with walls, are not inferior to many cities.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Lordship of MECHLIN.</HEAD>
<P>This lordship, which is only about seven or eight miles in length, and four or five in breadth, con∣taining, besides the capital, no more than nine vil∣lages,
<PB N="47" REF="460"/>
is, however, of very great antiquity. For a long time it had lords of its own; afterwards it was annexed to the bishopric of Liege; then to the earldom of Flanders, with which it went to the house of Burgundy; and from thence to the house of Austria. Though it was once one of the seven∣teen provinces, it is at present reckoned a part of Brabant, in the middle of which it lies, but has pe∣culiar arms and privileges. The only place worth notice is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Mechlin, by the Flemings called Mecheling and by the French Malines. This city stands on the little river Demer, fifteen miles from Ant∣werp, twelve from Brussels, and twelve from Lou∣vain, and is the see of an archbishop, erected, in 1559, by pope Paul IV. The archbishop takes the title of primate of the Netherlands, and abbot of Affligem, one half of the revenues of the abbey being appropriated to his see. His suffragans are the bishops of Antwerp, Ghent, Ipres, Bruges, and Ruremonde; and, within his archiepiscopal ju∣risdiction, are seventeen cities, and four hundred and fifty-five villages. The cathedral is a large and magnificent structure. The clock upon the four sides of the tower or steeple is an hundred and forty-four feet in circumference, each figure being above a yard long; and yet so high is the steeple, that, from the market-place, it seems but an ordinary clock. Besides a great number of convents of men and maidens, there is in this city a large <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A beguinage is a society of devout maidens, who live to∣gether in a kind of nunnery, and maintain themselves by work∣ing. They make no vows; and have the liberty to leave the house, and to marry, when they please.</NOTE> begui∣nage, containing generally seven hundred beguines, and sometimes more, who make some of the finest Mechlin lace. St. Rombant, who was an Irishman, and bishop of Dublin, is patron of this city. He is
<PB N="48" REF="470"/>
said to have been murdered here by two assassins, in hopes of finding a considerable sum of money about him, in the year 755, as he was returning from Rome. This city is the seat of a governor, a provin∣cial court, and also of a parliament or sovereign-coun∣cil, to which appeals lie from most of the courts of justice in the Austrian Netherlands; but from it lies no appeal, except in the causes of the knights of the Golden Fleece, to the sovereign of the order. The city is pretty large and well built, with broad clean streets, driving a considerable trade in corn, blankets, and thread; but their chief manufacture is of those fine laces famous throughout all Eu∣rope. Here is a stately arsenal, and a noble hos∣pital for wounded or superannuated soldiers, erected by Philip II. king of Spain.</P>

<HEAD>The Austrian Part of the Duchy of LIMBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is surrounded by the bishopric of Liege, and the duchies of Juliers and Luxemburg. That part of it which belongs to the states-general is called, at present, the county on the other side the Maes. It had antiently counts and dukes of its own; but afterwards came to the dukes of Bra∣bant; and from them, with the other provinces of the Netherlands, devolved first to the dukes of Bur∣gundy, and then to the house of Austria. The arms of the duchy are a lion azure, in a field or. The states consist of the nobility, clergy, and com∣mons; and there is a particular government for the Austrian part, subordinate to the governor-general. The country is very populous, and fruitful in wheat, fruits, wood, and pasture, being extremely well watered. It abounds also in cattle; and in the neighbourhood of Limburg are mines of iron, lead, and calamy. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="480"/>
Limburg, which gives name to the duchy, and stands on an eminence, is pretty well fortified, but has only two gates, and one large street, with a suburb called Dahlem, bigger than the town itself. In the neighbourhood, besides the above-mentioned mines, are quarries of different sorts of marble, with mountains, rocks, and precipices, firghtful to behold. The air here is very wholesome; so that the inhabitants die generally of old age, rather than of any distemper.</P>
<P>Rolduc, properly Rode le Duc, a small town, with an old castle. It is the capital of a district, which had formerly lords of its own. About a mile from this place is the famous abbey of Roleduc, whose abbot is temporal lord of several villages and districts, first member of the states of the province of Limburg, and perpetual commissary or deputy of the clergy, alternately with the abbot of Val∣dieu.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Austrian Part of the Duchy of LUX∣EMBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the south by the duchy of Lorrain; to the north by the bishopric of Liege, and the duchies of Limburg and Ju∣liers; to the east by the electorate of Treves; and to the west by Champagne. Its utmost extent from north to south is about eighty English miles, and from east to west near as many. The air is mild and temperate, and the plains, in the east part, are fruitful in corn, but, towards the west, the country is mountainous and woody, producing, notwithstanding, rye, pease, beans, and some wine, and abounding with game, iron mines, and quar∣ries of stone. It is also well watered with many small rivers. In the whole duchy, exclusive of the principal town, are twenty-three other smaller ones.
<PB N="50" REF="490"/>
The states consist of the clergy, the nobles, and the deputies of the chief towns. The religion of the country is Roman catholic, and the greatest part of it lies in the archbishopric of Treves. It had formerly counts and dukes of its own, who were princes of great fame and power, and several of them were advanced to the dignity of emperors and kings. In the year 1444, Elizabeth, princess of this country, ceded all her right in it to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, for the capital sum of sixteen thousand florins, and an annual pension of eight thousand: afterwards it came to the house of Austria, in the same manner as the other pro∣vinces of the Netherlands. By the peace of the Pyrenees, in 1659, France obtained a part thereof. Over the Austrian part of it is appointed a gover∣nor, and, at Luxemburg, is a provincial council, established, in 1553, by the emperor Charles V. and also a judicatory of nobles. No less than three different languages are spoken in the duchy, viz. the German, the Walloon, and the French. It lies in the centre of the forest of Ardenne, which was so famous of old, and of so great extent, and contains the following places:</P>
<P>Luxemburg or Lutzelburg, antiently Lucili∣burgum, the capital of the province, and one of the strongest fortifications in the Netherlands. It stands on the river Elz, fifty-two miles from Lim∣burg, to the south, and is divided into the Upper and Lower town, the former of which lies mostly on a hill, and the latter amidst deep vallies. This, like most other Roman catholic cities, swarms with monks and nuns, who possess great revenues, be∣stowed upon them, in the dark ages, by their de∣luded superstitious votaries: the abbey of Mun∣ster, in particular, is very opulent, possessing a seigniory which contains eight districts or manors.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="500"/>
Arlun or Arlon, in Latin Arolaunum, Arlunum, or Ara-Lunae, from an altar sacred to the moon, which the antient inhabitants worshipped as a deity. It lies on an eminence, twelve miles from Luxem∣burg, to the north-west, and was formerly a consi∣derable place, well peopled and fortified, but hath since suffered much by the wars, and been disman∣tled. The marquisate, to which it gives name, contains upwards of an hundred villages, great and small.</P>
<P>Bastogne, an old decayed town, situated twenty-eight miles from Luxemburg, to the north-west. It gives name to a provostship, containing an hundred and forty-five villages or hamlets, and was formerly so well-built, and so flourishing, that the people of that country called it Paris en Ar∣denne; but at present it is much declined. Here John Beck was born, who was killed in the battle of Lens, anno 1648, and who, from being a mes∣senger, raised himself, by his merit and courage, to the post of quarter-master-general of his catholic majesty's armies, and was made governor and cap∣tain-general of the duchy of Luxemburgh.</P>
<P>Marche or Marche-en-Famenne, a small city, on the borders of the county of Namur and the bi∣shopric of Liege, giving name to a provostship, in which are nineteen villages. Two yearly fairs are kept in it. In 1577, don John of Austria called together the chiefs of the malecontents in this town, in order to suppress the disturbances of the Nether∣lands, when an agreement was actually drawn up, called the perpetual edict, and signed by the em∣peror's deputies, and many of the other side; but William, prince of Orange, and many other lords, protested against it.</P>
<P>Chiny, on the river Semois, which gives name to a county and provostship, containing thirteen ci∣ties,

<P>Virton, a small town, but well fortified, and the capital of a provostship.</P>
<P>Biedburg, on the borders of the province, to∣wards the electorate of Treves, is the chief place of a district, containing thirty - three villages; and its present name is a translation of its antient Latin name, Bedae-Vicus.</P>
<P>Epternach, on the river Sour, twelve miles from Treves, and sixteen from Luxemburg, a small town, but the capital of a provostship, containing besides thirty-three villages. The famous John Bartelius, who wrote the history of the duchy of Luxemburg, was abbot of the Benedictine abbey here, and, in consequence of that, lord of the town and its provostship.</P>
<P>Grave-Macheren, on the bank of the Moselle, thirteen leagues from Luxemburg, a small but neat town, and the seat of a provostship, containing thirty-three villages. The neighbouring hills pro∣duce plenty of Moselle wine, in which the inhabi∣tants drive a good trade.</P>
<P>Igel or Aigle, a village, where is a square pyra∣mid seventy-four feet high, adorned with images, which appears from the inscription, to be a pagan monument, erected by two brothers of the name of Secundini, in honor of their parents.</P>
<P>Dickrich, on the Sour or Sure, fifteen miles from Luxemburg, the chief place of a provostship, containing twenty-six villages.</P>
<P>Durbicy, on the river Ourt, a small town, lying amidst steep rocks, but the seat of a provostship, containing seventy-six villages.</P>
<P>La Roche, a small town on the river Ourt, thirty-eight miles from Luxemburgh to the north. It is the capital of a provostship and county, and

<HEAD>The Marquisate of LE PONT D'OYE.</HEAD>
<P>The most remarkable places in this marquisate, which contains several counties and seigniories, are,</P>
<P>Rochefort, stiled in Latin Rupisortium, as being surrounded with rocks on every side. It is the ca∣pital of a county, which is a fief partly of Luxem∣burg, and partly of Liege, and belongs partly to the house of Stolberg, and partly to that of Lowen∣stein. The town, which is but small, lies sixty-six miles from Luxemburg to the north-west, and has a fine castle.</P>
<P>Vianden, a small town, with a castle, on the ri∣ver Ouren. It is the capital of a county, contain∣ing forty-nine villages, and belonging to the here∣ditary-stadtholder of the United-Provinces. The castle, which stands on a rock prodigiously high, and almost inaccessible, has always a good garrison. Here is a fine convent belonging to the monks of the Trinity, a considerable manufacture of woollen cloths, and a great many tanners. In the neigh∣bourhood is a commandery of the order of St. John, and some vineyards.</P>
<P>St. Vit, in Latin Fanum Sti Viti, thirty-eight leagues from Luxemburg to the north. It is the capital of a considerable seigniory belonging to the prince of Orange, and containing, besides, eighty-five villages.</P>
<P>St. Hubert, in Latin, Fanum Sti Huberti, thirty-six miles from Luxemberg to the north-west. The abbot of the rich and antient abbey of Bene∣dictines here, takes the title of first peer of the duchy of Bouillon, and is lord of the town, and eighty villages lying in its district. France and the house of Austria both lay claim to the sove∣reignty
<PB N="54" REF="530"/>
of the town and district; but the French are at present in possession of them. Near St. Hubert stands the town of Nassugne, where was formerly a convent of monks founded by St. Mo∣non, a Scotsman, who left his country about the year 632, to go and convert the inhabitants of the Ardenne, where he was murdered. In place of the convent, there is now a chapter dedicated to the same saint.</P>

<HEAD>The Austrian Part of the Duchy of GELDERS.</HEAD>
<P>As the greatest part of this duchy belongs to the United-Provinces, we refer the reader to them for an account of it. The principal places in the duchy possessed by the house of Austria are,</P>
<P>Roermond, or Ruermond, a strong town, situ∣ated at the conflux of the Roer with the Maes, whence it has its name. It stands twenty-five miles below Maestricht towards the north, being the largest town in circuit in all Gelders, and formerly the second in rank. It is the see of a bishop, subject to the archbishop of Mechlin. Here are a great many convents, both of men and maidens. The charter-house, in particular, is much taken notice of by travellers. The town hath been often be∣sieged, and taken, and was once wholly burnt down. A toll is levied here on the Maes.</P>
<P>The little cities of Elmpt and Swalm, with their villages and seigniories.</P>
<P>Here, as the most proper place, we shall give an account of that part of Gelderland which be∣longs to the king of Prussia, and which was ceded to him, in 1713, at the peace of Utrecht; but upon condition, that the Roman catholic religion should
<PB N="55" REF="540"/>
remain on the same footing as before. The prin∣cipal places in it are,</P>
<P>Geldre, a small, but very strong town, which gives name to the whole province. It stands in an island formed by the river Niers, and is so well for∣tified, that it is reckoned one of the strongest cities of the Netherlands. The king of Prussia had this town and territory, in lieu of the principality of Orange, to which he had a right, as heir to king William III. It is the residence of a governor, and college of justice.</P>
<P>Stralen, a small town, but the capital of a little territory.</P>
<P>Wachtendonk, a small town, but well fortified both by nature and art, and the capital of a terri∣tory. It stands on the Niers. It is said that bombs were first used at the siege of this town, in 1588.</P>
<P>Kessel, the capital of a district, which had an∣tiently counts of its own. It is said to have a fine castle, and lies on the Maes.</P>

<HEAD>The Austrian Part of the County of FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the east by Brabant, and the Hennegau; to the north-west by the Northern-Sea; to the south-west by Artois; to the north by that branch, or arm of the Scheld, called the Hont, which parts it from Zealand; and to the south by the Hennegau and Artois. With regard to its extent, the greatest length of the whole province is about seventy-five miles, and the breadth fifty-five. The air is said to be clearer and finer the farther you remove from the sea. The winters are often pretty long and severe, and the summers wet, yet sometimes very sultry. The soil in general is fertile, and, in some parts, to a very high degree. It yields excellent pasturage, which in consequence of great num∣bers
<PB N="56" REF="550"/>
of black cattle, horses, and sheep, are bred in it, and large quantities of butter and cheese made. It produces also all sorts of garden-stuff, fruit, corn, and flax, especially the last, exceeding fine, and in great plenty. In some places they have not corn sufficient for the inhabitants, but in others there is a superfluity. The ewes here bring forth three lambs at a birth, and sometimes four, five, and even six or seven. At a distance from the sea there is a great deal of wood, proper either for timber or fuel. Towards the coast they find, at the depth of four or five feet, a kind of turf for burning. The province is well supplied with sea and river fish, fowl, and venison, but has no slate or free-stone. It is so exceeding populous, that it looks like one continued city. A great deal of ex∣cellent beer is brewed in it. The principal rivers are the Scheld, the Lys, the Scarpe, and the Dender. There are also several canals, of which that between Bruges and Ghent is the chief. The states here consist of the clergy, nobility, and commoners. The clergy are the bishops and abbots; the nobility, certain families possessed of hereditary offices, or baronies, to which that pri∣vilege is annexed; and the commoners, the burgomasters, pensionaries, and deputies of the cities and districts. In the Austrian and French parts of this province, the only religion professed or tolerated is the Roman catholic. With respect to the persons and character of the inhabitants, they are, generally speaking, lusty, fat, and clumsy; very industrious, both in cultivating their lands, and in their trades and manufactures; lovers of liberty, and enemies to slavery, and not defective in good sense and judgment, though they have not so lively an imagination as some other nations. Their women are fair, handsome enough, and honest by their natural constitution, as well as from a principle of virtue. As they cannot pretend to
<PB N="57" REF="560"/>
wit and repartee, they do not make themselves ridi∣culous by the nauseous affectation of them. Both sexes are great lovers of public diversions, and every city, town, and village, have their kermisses, or fairs, in which all sorts of shews are exhibited. In this country some important arts were invented and improved. Weaving in general was greatly improved, and that of figures of all sorts in linen invented: also that of curing herrings, of dying cloths and stuffs, and of oil-colours. The manu∣factures of this country are not in the flourishing state they were formerly; yet silk, cotton, and woollen stuffs, brocades, camlets, tapestry, lace, and linen, are still manufactured here in great quantities. This province had counts of its own from the ninth century to the year 1369, when it went, by marriage, to the dukes of Burgundy; and afterwards from them, by marriage also, to the house of Austria. France, in 1667, seized the southern part, and the states-general obtained the northern, partly by the treaty of Munster, and partly by the barrier treaty of 1715. The arms of Flanders are a lion, sable, in a field, or. The chief court of judicature is the provincial council at Ghent, from which an appeal lies to the supreme council at Mechlin. There is also at Ghent a tri∣bunal, which decides in all matters relating to fiefs. In our more particular account of this country, we shall confine ourselves at present to what be∣longs to the house of Austria, having already described that which belongs to the United-Pro∣vinces, and reserving the French part till we come to France.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the Austrian part of the Province the most con∣siderable places are,</HEAD>
<P>Ghent, the capital of Flanders, and one of the largest cities in Europe, being seven miles in com∣pass
<PB N="58" REF="570"/>
within the walls, but the half of that space is not built upon. It stands thirty miles from Tour∣nay, twenty-eight from Brussels, twenty-six from Antwerp, and thirty-three from Ostend, and is di∣vided by rivers and canals into twenty-six islands, which are again united by about a hundred bridges, great and small. The city is well fortified both by art and nature, as it has a strong castle, walls, and ditches, and can, by shutting up the sluices, lay the country a mile round under water. It was so powerful and populous formerly, that it declared war, more than once, against its sovereign, and raised mighty armies. The emperor Charles V. was born here in 1500. From the tower of Bel∣fort, in the middle of the town, there is a delight∣ful prospect all over it. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Mechlin. Its first bishop was the celebrated Jansenius, from whom the Jansenists take their name. Here are a great number of monasteries, churches, hospitals, and market-places. Of the last, that called the Friday's market is the largest, and is adorned with a statue of Charles V. in his imperial robes. The stadt∣house and cathedral are grand structures; under the latter is a noble crypta, or subterraneous church. Here are fifty companies of tradesmen, and very curious manufactures of cloths, stuffs, and silks. The chief magistrate is the high-bailiff, under whom are burgomasters, echevins, and coun∣sellors. Here are several canals, of which that which leads to Bruges, and from thence to Ostend, is a very noble one.</P>
<P>Alost, or as the Flemings spell it, Aelst, on the Dender, between Brussels and Ghent, the capital of that called Imperial Flanders. Here are se∣veral convents of friers and nuns, and a college of Jesuits. In the convent of the Gulielmite monks is the tomb of Thierry Martin, who first brought
<PB N="59" REF="580"/>
the art of printing hither from Germany, with an epitaph, written by his friend Erasmus. The ter∣ritory of this city is of a pretty large extent, and is called a county, having antiently had counts of its own. It is very fruitful in pasture, corn, flax, and hops.</P>
<P>Geertsberghe, now a small town, but formerly considerable, and famous for its manufactures of tapestry, carpets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Ninove, or Nineve, a small but pretty well for∣tified town upon the Dender.</P>
<P>Ronse, otherwise Renay, a small town belong∣ing to the prince of Nassau-Siegen, who has here a very noble seat.</P>
<P>Oudenarde, or Audenaerde, a small town parted into two, and wholly surrounded by the Schelde. It lies fifteen miles from Ghent towards the south, and twenty-eight from Brussels to the west. It is noted for the beautiful tapestries wove in it, in which it has a good trade. There are several con∣vents in it, and it is partly under the jurisdiction of the magistrates, and partly under that of the baron of Pamele, who has a very antient castle in the town. Here Margaret, natural daughter of the emperor Charles V. duchess of Parma, and go∣verness of the Netherlands, was born in 1521: but what will render it for ever famous, is the great victory obtained by the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene over the French, commanded by the duke of Burgundy, grand-father to the present king of France, and by the duke of Vendome, on the 11th of June, 1708. In this battle king George II. of Great-Britain distinguished himself. Of the French above four thousand were left dead upon the spot, and above eight thousand taken prisoners. The castle ward of this town is of con∣siderable extent, containing several manors, and upwards of twenty villages, of which Vechte is
<PB N="60" REF="590"/>
one, whose lord is hereditary marshal of Flanders. In the neighbourhood of the town are two noble abbeys.</P>
<P>Courtray, a small but agreeable city, situated on the Lys, which divides it into two. It is twenty-two miles from Bruges to the south, and twenty from Ghent to the south-west, to which last city a fine paved road leads from it. In the year 1744 the French made themselves masters of it, and stripped it of its fortifications. Here are se∣veral religious houses, and some hospitals; but the city is chiefly noted for its manufactures of woollen cloths and table-linen, especially that sort we call diaper, and fine damask table-cloths and napkins. All kinds of figures and history are wo∣ven here in a very ingenious manner, in linen. The castleward of Courtray is very large, and extends on both sides of the Lys, in a very fruitful country. It is divided into five quarters, four of which are denominated from the chief places in them, viz. Haerlebeecke, Thielt, Deynse, and Menin. The other is stiled the verge, or quarter, of the thirteen parishes. Thielt has a good manufactory of linen, and Menin was one of the barrier-towns, which, in 1715, were ceded to the states-general, to have garrisons put into them; but, in 1744, the French made themselves masters of it, and razed the for∣tifications.</P>
<P>St. Nicholas, the capital of the county of Waes, abounds in corn and flax, and has its particular lows and customs, and a court of justice, having been formerly an independent county. This place is noted for its fairs, and trade in corn and flax. In the same county is also Rupelmonde, so called from its situation at the conflux of the Rupel with the Schelde, where the celebrated geographer Ger∣hard-Mercator was born.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="600"/>
Dendermonde, so called from its being situated at the conflux of the Dender with the Schelde, Monde, in Flemish signifying a mouth. It stands fourteen miles from Ghent to the east, and sixteen from Antwerp towards the south. It is very strong both by art and nature; for the neighbouring country, which is very pleasant and fruitful, may be easily laid under water. It has also a strong ci∣tadel near the mouth of the Dender. The town is handsome and well built, and drives a pretty good trade. Among other privileges which its merchants enjoy, one is, that their creditors can∣not force them to make any payment on Sundays, Mondays, or Tuesdays. This city, with its ter∣ritory, which contains sixteen fine villages, is now governed by an high bailiff. Formerly it had lords of its own, who were independent of the earls of Flanders, and held immediately of the emperor.</P>
<P>Bornheim, the capital of a county, between Dendermonde and Rupelmonde. Here is a con∣vent of English Dominican friers, founded in 1670 by the reverend father Thomas Howard, duke of Norfolk, who was of that same order, and was af∣terwards created a cardinal.</P>
<P>Bruges, twenty-four miles from Ghent, eleven from Ostend, and forty-six from Antwerp. A chapel, which antiently stood here near a bridge, in Flemish, Brugge, gave occasion to the build∣ing of the city, and its name. Here are several fine canals. By one of them one can go to Ostend, Newport, Furnes, and Dunkirk, in a summer's day, and vessels of four hundred tons can come up into the bason of Bruges. There is another that leads to Ghent, another to Damme, and a third to Sluys. The water of these canals is stagnant, without the least motion, yet, by means of sluices within the city, may be renewed in half an hour: however, it is not used for drinking or culinary purposes; but that
<PB N="62" REF="610"/>
which is brought by pipes from the Lys and Schelde, for which every house pays a tax, as in London. This was antiently a most flourishing city, in consequence of its trade.</P>
<P>Here are still shewn seventeen palaces, antiently the residences of the consuls of different nations, each of which had distinct houses, magnificently built, with warehouses for the merchandizes they exported or imported. One may judge of the power and wealth of the citizens in those days, by their daring to keep their sovereign, the archduke Maximilian, prisoner, to affront his servants, and abuse his officers; but though the city has been long upon the decline, there are still many rich merchants in it, who meet every day at noon in the great market-place. It is the see of a bishop, suf∣fragan to the archbishop of Mechlin, and heredi∣tary-chancellor of Flanders. The diocese con∣tains six cities, viz. Bruges, Ostend, Sluys, Damme, Middleburg in Flanders, and Oudenberch, besides one hundred and thirty-three boroughs or villages. The cathedral here is an antient building, erected in 865. Of the other churches, that dedicated to our Lady is very beautiful. Its steeple is so high that it is seen at sea off Ostend. There are two tombs in it of gilt copper, the one of Mary, the heiress of Burgundy, the other of her father Charles the Hardy, duke of Burgundy. Among other curiosities in the treasure of this church, are the rich vestments of Thomas of Becket, arch∣bishop of Canterbury, set with diamonds and other precious stones, and bought, at the Reforma∣tion, by Mary, sister to the emperor Charles V. and presented to this church. Here are four abbies, and a vast number of convents and nunneries. The church belonging to the Jesuits is of noble architecture. In that of the Dominicans is a very curious pulpit, the wood that supports the top, be∣ing
<PB N="63" REF="620"/>
cut out as ropes, and used as such. There is also a very extraordinary picture of the marriage of our Saviour with St. Cathàrine of Sienna; the Virgin Mary joins their hands, St. Dominic mar∣ries them, and old king David plays upon the harp at their wedding. The Carthusian monastery is very large, being about a mile in circumference. In the Carmelites church is a beautiful monument of Henry Jermyn, lord Dover, and peer of Eng∣land: but the monastery called the Dunes, of the order of St. Bernard, is the noblest in the city. The gardens and cloisters are very large and hand∣some: the apartment of the abbot is magnificent, and those of the monks neat; they keep a sumptuous table of every thing in season; have country-seats where they go a hunting, or to refresh themselves; and they keep their own coaches. Among the nunneries, there are two English; one of Augus∣tines, who are all ladies of quality, and entertain strangers at the grate with sweetmeats and wine. The other, called the Pelicans, is of a stricter or∣der and coarser dress. Several courts are held here for the administration of justice; as that of the magistrates for the city; that for the liberty of Bruges; that of the provostship and chapter, and the feodal court. In the chapel of St. Basil is preserved the blood, which Joseph of Arimathea wiped off with a spunge from the dead body of our Saviour. Fine woollen and cotton stuffs, silks, tapestries, linen, and lace, are made here. Many of the streets and squares are very fine; of the latter, the Fridays market-place, and the burg, are the most remarkable. In this city, in January 1430, Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, instituted the order of the Golden Fleece. The patrons or pro∣tectors of the order, are the Virgin Mary and St. Andrew, and the habit, a robe of crimson velvet, with a Golden Fleece hanging at a collar of gold.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="630"/>
Ypres, on the little river Iperlee, the capital of a large district, called the castellany or castle-ward of Ypres, which is a very fruitful country. It is a handsome town, and the see of a bishop, suffragan of the archbishop of Mechlin. The convents and churches here are very numerous; and there are some hospitals, and manufactures of silk and wool. It is one of the barrier-towns that were ceded to the states-general in 1715. In 1744, the French made themselves masters of it; but the Austrians have again got possession of it.</P>
<P>Warneton, a strong little town, which, with its territory, belongs to the princely house of Nassau-Orange. It was also one of the barrier towns.</P>
<P>Ostende or Oostende, a seaport-town in the Frankenland or liberty of Bruges. It is well for∣tified, and is seated in a marshy ground, among di∣vers canals, into some of which the largest ships may enter with the tide. The city is surrounded with several forts, and the harbour is such that it can never be blocked up. Ships of great burthen may pass from hence to Bruges. This city held out against the Spaniards from July the 5th, 1601, to September the 22d, 1604. They are said to have lost eighty thousand men before it; and the num∣ber of those who were killed or died in the city, was computed at fifty thousand. It surrendered, at last, on good terms; not for want of men or provisions, but purely for want of ground, which the enemy gained, foot by foot, till there was not enough left to hold men to defend it. Three hun∣dred thousand cannon ball, of thirty pound weight, are said to have been fired against it. The be∣sieged often repaired the breaches with heaps of dead bodies. The late emperor Charles VI. erect∣ed an East-India company here; but the maritime powers, after many negociations, got it abolished
<PB N="65" REF="640"/>
in 1781. They have no fresh water here, but what is brought in boats from Bruges. In 1745, it was besieged and taken by the French.</P>
<P>Dixmuyde, a well fortified town on the little ri∣ver Iperee, within the liberty of Bruges, has a free fair yearly, for horses and other merchandize, and is famous for excellent butter. About four miles from hence stands a very strong fort, called fort Knocke or Knoque, flanked, by marshal Vau∣ban, with four bastions, lined with free-stone; be∣sides two half-moons on that side which cannot be laid under water.</P>
<P>Furnes, a strong town, which has a communi∣cation, by canals, with Dunkirk, Newport, Bruges, and other places. It was one of the barrier-towns. There are several cloisters in it.</P>
<P>Newport, a strong sea-port town on the little river Iperlee, about nine miles from Ostend, four∣teen from Dunkirk, and thirty-eight from Ghent. It lies about a mile from the sea, and has a pretty good tide harbour. The strength of the town consists chiefly in its sluices, by which all the coun∣try round can be laid under water in a moment. Here are several convents; one, in particular, of English Carthusian friars. In the neighbourhood a famous battle was fought, in 1600, betwixt the Spaniards, and the army of the states-general. It had the name of Newport from the harbour, built here in 1168. The inhabitants support themselves chiefly by the fishing trade, and by making nets and cordage for shipping. This town is also in the liberty of Bruges.</P>

<HEAD>The Austrian Part of the County of HENNE∣GAU, or HAINAULT.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the south by Cham∣pagne and Picardy; to the north by Flanders; to the east by the duchy of Brabant, the county of Namur, and the bishopric of Liege; and to the west by Artois and Flanders. Its extent from north to south is about forty-five miles, and about forty-eight from east to west. The air of this county is pleasant and temperate, and the soil fruit∣ful: it abounds in rich pastures, corn-fields, woods and forests, coal, iron, lead, beautiful marble, slate, and other useful stones: it is well watered by ri∣vers and lakes, and breeds abundance of black cattle, and sheep, whose wool is very fine. Its principal rivers are the Schelde, the Selle, and the Dender. This province is reckoned to contain twenty-four walled towns, nine hundred and fifty villages, one duchy, and several principalities, earldoms, peerdoms, and baronies. The abbeys in it are twenty-seven. For spiritual matters, the greater part of it is subject to the archbishop of Cambray, and the rest to the bishops of Liege and Arras. The states of the province consist of the clergy, nobility, and commoners. The clergy are the abbots, deputies of the chapters, and rural deans; but the chapters of St. Waudru and St. Germain, in Mons, send no deputies, as they con∣tribute nothing to the public taxes. The nobility consist of the earls and barons, and all those who, by their birth, have a right to a seat in the as∣sembly of the states. The commoners are com∣posed of the deputies of the towns. The clergy in this county are uncommonly rich. The states meet only when they are summoned by the sove∣reign;
<PB N="67" REF="660"/>
but there is a standing committee at Mons, which meets weekly. This county had long counts of its own, till the year 1436; when Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, arrived to the posses∣sion of it, upon the death of Jaquiline, the heiress, without issue. The French acquired that part of it which they possess, partly by the peace of the Py∣renees, and partly by those of Nimeguen and Res∣wyck. The arms of this county are quartered, and contain four lions, in a field, or. For the go∣vernment of it, there is a sovereign-council, at the head of which is the high-bailiff, who has very great authority: he represents the sovereign, is governor of Mons, and captain-general of the pro∣vince. In that part of it still possessed by the house of Austria, the chief places are,</P>
<P>Mons, the capital of the county, twenty-seven miles south of Brussels, twenty-four east of Tour∣nay, and thirty-three west of Namur. It stands on the little river Troùille, and is a large and well fortified city. The buildings, especially the public ones, are beautiful, and the streets large. Here is a famous chapter of canonesses, founded by St. Waudru, sister to the celebrated St. Aldegonide: they are in number thirteen, and must prove their nobility by sixteen descents: the sovereign has the nomination of them: they must appear at morn∣ing service in their canonical habits; but the rest of the day may wear the richest apparel, dance and sing, or divert themselves otherwise, as they please; they may also, if they please, leave the ab∣bey, and marry: their church is very fine, all its chapels and altars being of marble and jasper, and its statues of exquisite workmanship. There is a manufacture here of woollen stuffs, and some trade in other commodities: here are also two colleges, where polite literature is taught; besides an abbey,
<PB N="68" REF="670"/>
and several other convents and nunneries. At the village of Malplaquet, seven or eight miles to the south of this city, the French, commanded by the marshals Villars and Boufflers, were, in 1709, at∣tacked by the duke of Marlborough, as they lay behind triple intrenchments, and entirely defeated, though with great loss on the side of the allies. Upon this Mons, which the duke had been be∣sieging, surrendered.</P>
<P>Soignies, a small town on the river Sonnegue. Near it is a wood, called the wood of Soignies. The secular chapter here, consisting of a provost, dean, treasurer, and thirty canons, are spiritual and temporal lords of the town, and appoint the bailiff of it.</P>
<P>St. Ghislain, a town on the river Haine, about five miles from Mons. It is pretty strong by its situation on the banks of the river, and by the marshes that surround it. The abbot of the famous Benedictine abbey here, is stiled primate of Hainault, and is spi∣ritual and temporal lord of the town. In this ab∣bey are always kept a bear and an eagle; because, they say, God made use of those animals to shew St. Ghislain where he would have him build his mona∣stery.</P>
<P>Roeux, a small but pretty town, eight miles from Mons. It is well fortified, stands in a fruitful soil, has several villages within its jurisdiction, and gives the title of earl to the house of Croi.</P>
<P>Ath or Aeth, on the river Dender, fourteen miles from Mons, is a handsome, strong, little town, and has a flourishing manufacture of linen, and a large district belonging to it, called the Castleward.</P>
<P>Leuse, a small town, and an antient barony. Here is a collegiate church and chapter, consisting of a dean and twenty canons, all in the gift of the duke of Aremberg.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="680"/>
Chievres, a small town, nine miles from Mons. At the village of Cambron, on the Dender, three miles from hence, is a camp very advantageously situated.</P>
<P>Lessines, a small town, but well fortified, and pleasantly situated in a fine plain on the Dender, se∣venteen miles from Mons. It is noted for a ma∣nufacture of linen.</P>
<P>Enghein, a small town, fourteen miles from Mons. This town, with its bailiwic, containing eighteen villages, was formerly the first barony of the county of Hainault, and was long the property of the house of Bourbon, who sold it at last to the duke de Aremberg; but the eldest son of the prince of Condè is still stiled duke of Enghein. The ti∣tle of peer of Hainault was, in 1670, annexed to this town, in favour of the duke of Aremberg, who has a stately seat, with a fine park, noble gar∣dens, and water-works, in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Hall or Halle, a small town on the Senne, twenty miles from Mons, and seven from Brussels. It is well fortified, and garrisoned for the security of Brussels. Here is a celebrated image of the Vir∣gin, enshrined in gold, with a crown of the same metal on its head, holding in one hand the image of our Saviour, and, in the other, a gilded rose. It is said to perform many miracles: the learned Lipsius was silly enough to write a book on them: abundance of presents and pilgrimages are made to it by persons of all ranks.</P>
<P>Braine le Comte, a small town, twelve miles from Mons, and sixteen from Brussels. It is thought to have derived its name from Brennus, a famous ge∣neral of the Senonenses, in Caesar's time, who is said to have built an old tower or fortress, that stood here formerly, but is now in ruins. The duke of Aremberg is lord of the town, and its ter∣ritory.</P>

<P>Fontenoy, a village on the Schelde, where, in 1745, the French, under marshal Saxe, gained a victory over the allies; but paid very dear for it, as the British troops fought with the greatest intre∣pidity, and would certainly have carried the day, had the Dutch behaved with equal spirit.</P>
<P>Steenkirke, a village between Enghien and Halle, famous for the battle fought there, in 1692, be∣tween the army of the allies, commanded by king William, and the French, under the duke of Lux∣emburg. It was a kind of drawn battle, as most of king William's were, at least, in the Low Coun∣tries.</P>

<HEAD>The County of NAMUR.</HEAD>
<P>This county is surrounded on all sides by the bishopric of Liege and the duchy of Brabant, ex∣cept to the west, where it borders on the county of Hainault. Its length is reckoned about thirty miles, and its breadth about twenty-eight. The hills here are cloathed with woods full of wild fowl and venison, and lined with mines of iron and lead, and quarries of marble and stone. Be∣sides wood they have a bituminous fat earth here,
<PB N="71" REF="700"/>
proper for fuel, and the lower grounds bear grass and all sorts of corn. The county is well watered by the Maes, the Sambre, and the Mehaigne. This, like most of the other provinces, had counts of its own, from the year 1000 to 1421, when it was sold to Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. It has now also, like the others, states, consist∣ing of the clergy, nobility, and the deputies of the cities, and a particular governor and council: the states, who meet only when summoned by the so∣vereign, have a committee, who hold their assem∣blies at Namur: from the council of the province there lies an appeal to the grand council at Mech∣lin: the arms of it are a lion sable, in a field or, with a dexter fesse, drawn over the whole shield: a small part of it was ceded to the French by the treaty of Nimeguen. The principal places in it are the following.</P>
<P>Namur, which gives name to the county, and is its capital. It stands at the conflux of the Maes and Sambre, over each of which it has a bridge, and is thirty miles from Brussels, and twenty-six from Louvain. It is esteemed the strongest town in Europe, having above a dozen of forts round it, besides a strong castle: one of the forts was built by the famous Coehorn, and called Fort-William, in honour of the king: however, it has been more than once taken and retaken. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Mechlin: the diocese contains eight cities, upwards of three hundred villages, and a great number of abbies, collegiate churches, and religious houses of both sexes. The Jesuits church here is a noble building, all of red and black marble. Besides the magis∣tracy of the town and the provincial council, here is a tribunal called the sovereign bailiage, which judges in all feudal matters; but there lies an ap∣peal

<DIV3>
<HEAD>NAME, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom was antiently called Gallia, which name it received from its inhabitants the Celtae, called by the Romans Galli. Its mo∣dern name of France it had from the Franks, a German nation, who came from Franconia, in the fifth century, and fixed themselves in that part of Gaul, which lies north of the river Loire. It ex∣tends in length from the Pyrenean mountains in the south, to Dunkirk in the north, eight degrees and a half, that is five hundred and ten miles; and, in breadth, from the most westerly point in Brittany, to Strasburg in Alsace, four hundred and ninety-five miles; being bounded to the south by the Mediterranean and Spain, from which it is se∣parated by the Pyrenean mountains; to the north by St. George's Channel and the Netherlands;
<PB N="74" REF="740"/>
to the east by Germany, Switzerland, and Italy; and to the west by the Western Ocean, or Bay of Biscay.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is temperate, neither so cold as in the northern kingdoms, nor so hot as in Spain and Italy. As to the soil, it is in general fruitful, though not without many barren tracts and mountains: of the last the chief are the Alps, which divide it from Italy; the Pyrenees, which divide it from Spain; and the Cevennes, in the province of Languedoc, with mount Dor in that of Auvergne. The prin∣cipal rivers are, the Rhone, which rises in Switzer∣land, and falls into the Mediterranean, after being joined by the Soane at Lyons, and other smaller rivers: this river is highest in summer, which is supposed to be owing to the melting of the snow on the Alps. The Seine, antiently Sequana, which rises in Burgundy, and falls into the Eng∣lish channel, betwixt Havre de Grace and Hon∣fleur. The Loire, which rises in the Cevennes, and falls into the Bay of Biscay below Nantz: it communicates with the Seine by two canals. The Garonne, which has its source in the Pyrenees, and falls into the Bay of Biscay below Bourdeaux. This river is joined to the Mediterranean by the canal of Languedoc. France is not sufficiently improved, yielding, even in plentiful years, little more corn than is necessary for the subsistence of the inhabitants; so that a bad harvest is al∣ways attended with great scarcity, especially in time of war. A variety of fine wines are pro∣duced here; but those of Champagne, Burgundy, Bourdeaux, Pontack, Hermitage, and Frontiniac, are particularly admired. Some provinces also a∣bound in olives, others in apples, capers, prunes,
<PB N="75" REF="750"/>
flax, and hemp, silk, wool, black cattle, mules, game, wild-fowl, medicinal and salt springs. The Pyrenees, Alsace, Burgundy, and Lorrain, sup∣ply the French with ship-timber, but fuel begins to be scarce in the other provinces. A great deal of salt, both bay and white, is made on the sea-coasts. The maritime provinces are well sup∣plied with fish from the sea, as the others are from the rivers. Metals and minerals of several kinds are found in particular parts of the kingdom, as gold, silver, copper, iron, steel, and lead, pit-coal, salt-petre, and marble. In Languedoc also is a mine of torquoises; warm-baths, mineral waters, and remarkable springs, are to be met with in several places.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the PEOPLE, and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the persons and character of the French, they are not so large and strong as their neighbours, but nimble and active: they general∣ly wear their own hair in a queue or bag: their complexions are none of the best, which, no doubt, gave rise to the custom of painting their faces, so common among the ladies. They are a gay sprightly people, but vain, rash, fickle, and un∣steady: yet they are seldom dejected by misfortunes, but usually preserve their tempers in the lowest circumstances. In politeness, courtesy, and good breeding, they think no nation can pretend to vie with them; their manners, notwithstanding, in many respects, are extremely offensive and shock∣ing to persons of true taste, sound judgment, and uncorrupted morals. The most abject flattery and dissimulation cost them nothing, they even value themselves upon them, as constituting, in their opinion, the very essence of politeness. There is, therefore, very little sincerity in all their fine
<PB N="76" REF="760"/>
speeches and professions; and whoever should lay any stress upon them, would find themselves greatly disappointed. Though no men submit to adver∣sity with a better grace, yet they are intolerably insolent, vain, arbitrary, and imperious, in pros∣perity, and extremely litigious. The women en∣joy great freedoms, and the men are so far from being tormented with jealousy, that they are proud of seeing their wives admired and courted. Mo∣desty, instead of being regarded as a virtue among the ladies, is accounted rusticity and stupidity. On the other hand, it must be allowed, that the French are very active, brave, and ingenious, have a good address, and a genteel air. France hath produced many great men of all sorts, and the arts and sciences have been much improved by it; the belles lettres, in particular, painting, sculpture, en∣graving, naval and military architecture, and gun∣nery, have been much indebted to it, and the dif∣ferent academies established in it; but philosophy and the mathematics cannot be said to have received equal benefit. The French language is formed out of that of the Gauls, Romans, and Franks, and is understood pretty generally all over Eu∣rope, being very elegant, significant, and agree∣able.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the religion of France, since the revocation of the edict of Nantz, the public exer∣cise of the Roman catholic alone hath been permit∣ted: yet there are still great numbers of protestants in France, especially in the southern provinces. They never would admit the inquisition in this country; and, in many respects, the king, clergy, and laity, are more free and independent of the court of Rome, than in other Roman catholic
<PB N="77" REF="770"/>
countries. Within the kingdom too the power of the clergy is much more limited, and more sub∣ject to the civil magistrate, than in other countries of that persuasion. The only limitation upon the king, in ecclesiastical matters, is the Concordat, made in 1515 betwixt Francis I. and pope Leo X. notwithstanding, he nominates all archbishops, bishops, abbots, and priors, and can tax the clergy without a papal licence or mandate: accordingly, not many years since, he demanded the twentieth penny of the clergy, and, to ascertain that, re∣quired them to deliver in an inventory of their estates and incomes; to avoid which, they volun∣tarily made an offer of the annual sum of twelve millions of livres, over and above the usual free gift, which they pay every five years. During the vacancy of a bishopric, the king has the management of it till it is filled up, together with the nomina∣tion of all the ecclesiastical officers, and the dispo∣sal of all vacant benefices, parish churches excepted. The creed of the Gallican church is far from being so favourable to the pope as that of other Roman catholic countries, as it confines his power entirely to things relative to salvation, concerning which it seems, at present, to allow him an absolute power, asserting his infallibility, and not admitting of an appeal from him to a general council: but the op∣posers of the famous constitution Unigenitus are very numerous, and vigorously supported by the parliaments. The Jansenists also, who are ac∣counted a sort of heretics by the more rigid papists, are very numerous in France. In the whole king∣dom there are eighteen archbishops, one hundred and thirteen bishops, seven hundred and seventy abbies for men, three hundred and seventeen ab∣bies and priories for women, besides a great num∣ber of lesser convents, and two hundred and fifty commanderies of the order of Malta. The eccle∣siastics
<PB N="78" REF="780"/>
of all sorts are computed at near two hun∣dred thousand, and their revenues at about six mil∣lions sterling.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MANUFACTURES, TRADE, and COINS.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to manufactures, France has made great improvements. The most beautiful works in tapestry, filigree, and sculpture, are executed at the Gobelins, in Paris: no less than two hundred persons are employed there in the article of tape∣stry alone; and the flourishing state of the arts and manufactures in France is, in a great measure, owing to this establishment. The silk manafacture was carried to great perfection under Lewis XIV. and at this day, the city of Lyons is distinguished above all others, for its wonderful skill and inge∣nuity in this respect. In the woollen manufactures also, the French have made such progress, that those of Abbeville are said not to be greatly inferior to the English or Dutch, either in fineness or good∣ness. Besides these manufactures, those of linen and sail-cloth, soap, thread, lace, stuffs of all kinds, paper, glass wares, porcelain, cambricks, lawns, arms, artillery, and all sorts of hard-wares, toys, leather, brocades, and gold and silver lace, are very considerable: their artisans, however, in most of these articles, are surpassed by the English. Both their manufactures and trade suffered greatly by the persecution and exile of the protestants, in the reign of Lewis XIV. Their foreign trade, however, to Italy and Turky, from the south of France, to the West and East-Indies, the Baltic, and the North, from the ports on the ocean and the English Channel, is still very considerable. Their West-India coronies, in particular, are very advantageous to them, employing a great number of ships, and taking off large quantitities of their
<PB N="79" REF="790"/>
commodities and manufactures. Their fisheries indeed, on the banks of Newfoundland, and their trade to the East-Indies, Africa, and North-Ame∣rica, received a great blow in the late war, and by the cessions they were obliged to make to obtain peace; for their East-India company was in a manner ruined, and they were forced to yield up Senegal, Canada, Cape Breton, St. John's, and their possessions in Acadia or Nova-Scotia; and also to submit to very mortifying restrictions in re∣gard to their catching, curing, and drying of fish, as being allowed only to catch within certain limits, and to cure and dry them only in the small islands of St. Peter and Miquelon. To see these articles of the peace exactly complied with, some ships of war, under the command of a commodore, have been constantly kept by the English at Newfound∣land, since the conclusion of the war, during the fishing-season. Thus, by endeavouring to crush the English, they have so curtailed their power and commerce, that they will, probably, never more be in a condition to dispute the empire of the ocean with them. Here is a board of trade, consisting of some privy-counsellors, and twelve merchants deputed from the principal towns of France: but one great disadvantage to the commerce of this kingdom is, that it is not so honourable as in England, and some other countries; so that the French nobility think it below them, which is the reason that the church, the law, and the army, are so full of them. A great many of the cities of France have the pri∣vilege of coinage, and each of them a particular mark to distinguish their respective pieces. The several mints are under the inspection of the cours des monnoies, or mint-courts, of Paris, Lyons, and Pau. Accounts are kept in France in livres, sous, and deniers. Twelve deniers is equal to a sol or sou, or an halfpenny English; and twenty sous
<PB N="80" REF="800"/>
make a livre. The denier is a small copper piece; but both sols and livres are only imaginary coins. There is another small copper coin, called a liard, equal to three deniers. An ecu is worth two shil∣lings and sixpence, a Louis-blanc five shillings, a pistole eight shillings and four-pence, and a Louis-d'or one pound sterling.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and MEMORABLE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>France, antiently called Transalpine Gaul, or Gaul beyond the Alps, in respect of Italy, to distin∣guish it from Cisalpine Gaul, or Gaul on the Italian side of the Alps, was probably peopled from Italy, which adjoins to it on the east. About forty-eight years before Christ, it was conquered by the Ro∣mans under Julius Caesar. Augustus divided it into four provinces; and it continued in the posses∣sion of the Romans until the year 400, or therea∣bouts, when the northern nations broke in upon the empire. In the fifth century, the Burgundians and Goths took possession of it; and these were followed by the Franks, who came from Germany as well as the Burgundians, and from whom the country derived its present name. Thus the peo∣ple of France are a mixture of the posterity of the antient Gauls, Romans, Franks, Goths, and Bur∣gundians, but chiefly of the Gauls; for though the Romans, and afterwards the Franks, subdued the Gauls, yet they did not expel them, so that they still constituted the body of the people. The first Christian monarch of the Franks was Clovis, who began his reign anno 468. Pepin, the son of Charles Martel, who, from being maire of the pa∣lace, had raised himself to sovereign power, divided the provinces among his principal nobility, which gave rise to those numerous principalities that were formerly in France, and to the several parliaments;
<PB N="81" REF="810"/>
for every province retained the same form of go∣vernment that had before extended over the whole kingdom; no laws being made, or taxes raised, with∣out the concurrence of the grand council, consist∣ing of the clergy and the nobility. Charlemagne, the son of Pepin, conquered Italy, Germany, and part of Spain, and was crowned emperor of the Romans by pope Leo, anno 800; to whom he confirmed the grant of the exarchate, that had been made by his father to the see of Rome. About the year 900, Normandy and Bretagne were yield∣ed up to the Normans, upon condition of their quitting the other provinces. Anno 987, Hugh Capet usurped the throne, and began a new line of monarchs, called the Capetine line. Anno 1066, William, duke of Normandy, and one of the crown vassals, and petty princes of France, invaded Eng∣land; and having defeated and killed Harold in battle, mounted the throne. Anno 1282, the French were massacred, and expelled from Sicily; which massacre having been executed on Easter eye, when the bells rung for prayers, is generally called the Sicilian Vespers. In the year 1285, the king∣dom of Navarre was added to the crown of France, by the marriage of Philip IV. with Jane, queen of Navarre: the clergy and nobility refusing to grant this king supplies for the wars, he summoned the deputies or representatives of the commons to par∣liament, and constituted them a third estate, on their granting his demands: in this reign also, the order of the knight's templars was abolished in France. Anno 1344, Hubert, count dauphin of Vienne, transferred his dominions to the crown of France, upon condition that the king's eldest son should be stiled dauphin, as he is at this day. Edward III. of England, claiming the crown of France, in opposi∣tion to Philip VI. of Valois, invaded France, and obtained a complete victory at Cressy, in Picardy,
<PB N="82" REF="820"/>
anno 1346: this claim occasioned long and bloody wars betwixt the French and English; and tho' the latter made great conquests in France, they lost them all again, Charles VII. recovering both Normandy and Guienne. In the reign of Lewis XI. several more provinces were reunited to the crown; and Charles VIII. annexed the duchy of Bretagne, by marrying the heiress of that duchy, anno 1491. Anno 1525, Francis I. was taken pri∣soner, at the battle of Pavia, by the Imperialists: it was this king who concluded the famous con∣cordat with pope Leo X. On the eighteenth of August, in the year 1572, was perpetrated that cruel and perfidious massacre of the protestants at Paris, which leaves an indelible stain on the people of France. In 1589, Henry III. being suspected of favouring the protestants, was assassinated by one Clement, a monk. In 1610, Henry IV. who passed the edict of Nantz, was assassinated by one Ravilliac, a friar, in the streets of Paris. Under Lewis XIII. the protestants were dispossessed of all the towns that had been given them for their secu∣rity, and the liberties of the subject almost entirely destroyed, by the queen-mother, Mary of Medicis, and cardinal Richlieu; and, in the minority of Lewis XIV. cardinal Mazarine gave the finishing stroke to them, and rendered the government alto∣gether absolute. Lewis XIV. considerably en∣larged his dominions, placed his grandson on the throne of Spain, extended the trade, navigation, and manufactures of his kingdom, encouraged learned and ingenious men, and thereby im∣proved the arts and sciences; yet, by the long and ruinous wars he was engaged in, he left an immense load of debt upon the nation, and almost entirely drained it of its people.</P>

<HEAD>The KING'S TITLES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The King's title is Lewis XV. by the grace of God, king of France and Navarre. The title of sire is given him by his subjects, and others, when they speak or write to him. In writing or speak∣ing of him, the French call him the king, or his majesty; but foreigners, the king of France, the most Christian king, or his most Christian majesty. The pope, in his bulls, stiles him the eldest son of the church; because Clovis was the first prince after the fall of the Roman empire who embraced Christi∣anity. If the dauphin dies before the king his fa∣ther, his eldest son of the dauphin, while his father is alive, is stiled duke of Burgundy; the second duke of Aquitain, which is the antient name of Guienne; the third duke of Berry; and the fourth duke of Provence. The king's second son is stiled duke of Orleans, and the third duke of Anjou. The children of the royal family, in ge∣neral, are called les enfans de France; and the princesses, mesdames de France; the dauphin is also stiled monseigneur, and the duke of Orleans monsieur.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>In regard to the constitution of this kingdom, the crown is hereditary, and the king absolute: the salique law limits the succession to the male-issue by the queens, excluding the females, and also natural sons, though legitimated. The mino∣rity of the king continues only till he enters his fourteenth year, unless his predecessor has ordered it otherwise: if no regent hath been appointed by the deceased monarch, the queen-mother, if there
<PB N="84" REF="840"/>
is one, or the first prince of the blood, is invested with that office. The king is crowned at Rheims, in the cathedral, by the archbishop of that city, or the bishop of Soissons, on which occasion the holy oil, said to have been brought from heaven by a dove at the coronation of Clovis, is made use of. The kingdom is indivisible. It appears from the foregoing short history, that the French were a free people until the reign of Lewis XIII. and every province almost had its parliament, without whose concurrence no affairs of consequence were transacted. The parliament of Paris, in particular, had formerly very great authority, but it is now wholly subject to the crown, though it still en∣joys some prerogatives above the other parlia∣ments of the kingdom. When any new tax is proposed, the states of some provinces assem∣ble; but their power extends no farther than to settle the method of raising and levying it, and to make an assessment for that purpose. The only legislative power in France, at present, is in the king, whose edicts, with a <HI>soit car tel est notre bon plaisir,</HI> Let this edict be executed, for such is our good pleasure; being registered in the several par∣liaments of the kingdom, which are all composed of persons at the devotion of the court, have the full force of law. The parliaments have scarce any other business now than to administer justice: however, they still venture sometimes to make very bold remonstrances. For the administration of the government under the king, there are, at present, several councils, viz. the supreme council of state, the council des depeches, the council of finances, the council of trade, the privy-council, that called le grand conseil, and the high court of chancery. For the administration of justice also, there are a great number of inferior courts, from which appeals lie to the bailiages and senechausees, from them to the presidial courts, and from these last to
<PB N="85" REF="850"/>
the parliaments, which at present are twelve, viz. those of Paris, Thoulouse, Rouen, Grenoble, Bourdeaux, Dijon, Aix, Rennes, Pau, Metz, Be∣sançon, and Douay: in Alsace and Rousillon are courts of much the same nature. The king's edicts must be registered in all these before they are of force; but hardly any of them, except some∣times that of Paris, ever venture to make any diffi∣culty about it. The princes of the blood, with the dukes and counts, peers of France, and the archbishop of Paris, sit and vote in the parliament of Paris; and by it the princes of the blood, the principal officers of state, dukes, peers, and eccle∣siastics, are tried. All the places in these par∣liaments, those of the judges not excepted, are pur∣chased. In some provinces the administration of justice is regulated by the Roman law, in others by their particular customs, so far as they are consist∣ent with the king's edicts and declarations. The king's ordinances for the maintaining and explaining the liberties of the Gallican church, form the chief part of the ecclesiastical law in France. Tho' the number of the inhabitants be computed at twenty millions, yet some parts of the kingdom are but very indifferently peopled. The nobility consists of four classes: the princes of the blood; the high nobility; the ordinary nobility; and the nobility lately made. He who stands next the crown, after the king's children, is the first prince of the blood. Among the higher nobility, the dukes and counts, peers of France, have the precedence; they assist at the unction of the king, attend when he holds a lit de justice, and enjoy a seat in the parliament of Paris. Among the higher nobility are reckoned also the knights of the Holy Ghost, and the go∣vernors of provinces and lieutenant generals, with the other dukes, counts, and marquises. The ordinary nobility are generally stiled ecuyers, and are divided into the noblesse de race, and the no∣blesse
<PB N="86" REF="860"/>
de naisance. The new nobility are those to whom the king has granted letters of nobility, or conferred some post upon, by which they are enno∣bled. There are some privileges that are common to all the nobles, as an exemption from the poll∣tax, the quartering of soldiers, and the duties of franc-fief, with some others. The orders of knight∣hood in France, are those of St. Michael, the Ho∣ly Ghost, and St. Lewis: the first was instituted in the year 1469, and consists of one hundred knights: the second was instituted in 1578, and consists also of one hundred knights, besides the sovereign, and is conferred only on the princes of the blood, peers, and other great men of the first quality: the order of St. Lewis was instituted by Lewis XIV. for the encouragement of the officers of the army.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenue is either ordinary or extraordinary. The ordinary arises from the demesnes; the duty on wine; the gabelle or salt-duty; the taille, from which the nobility, clergy, and certain officers, are exempted, except in a few districts; the capi∣tation or poll-tax; the customs of all kinds; the duty on stampt-paper, and several others; together with the gift of the clergy, already mentioned. As to the extraordinary revenue, it depends upon the king's pleasure: among the methods sometimes taken in regard to it, are the raising the value of the coin, compounding state-bills or debentures, and other arbitrary measures. The ordinary re∣venue at present, is computed at about ten millions sterling. For the collection of the imposts and taxes, the kingdom is divided into generalities and intendancies, and these again into other lesser divi∣sions, generally called elections: some branches of
<PB N="87" REF="870"/>
the revenue, as the customs, wine-licence, salt and stamp-duty, posts, &amp;c. are farmed to the company of farmers-general, who have their under-farmers and receivers. At the head of the officers of the finances is the comptroller-general; and for the management of the revenue, and the determination of all disputes relating to it, there are several tribu∣nals and offices in different parts of the kingdom, of which that of Paris is the principal. Notwith∣standing the enormous taxes and impositions, and vast revenues produced by them, the treasury is not only frequently empty, but hath been more than once involved in prodigious debts, and the people, by endless exactions, reduced to the last degree of wretchedness, chiefly from the ambitious views and intrigues of the court; and this is said to be pretty much the case at present, the late war having not only greatly disordered their finances, but stopped up some of its principal resources. With respect to the forces of France, in time of peace they are seldom under two hundred thousand; and in time of war are often double that number. The art of war is no where better understood than in France, that part of it especially which relates to gunnery and fortification; for besides other advantages for learning it, here is a royal academy for training up five hundred young gentlemen in the several branches of the art, and a great number of for∣tresses. For the maintenance of officers and soldiers, disabled, or worn out in the service, there are above seventy military hospitals, besides the hotel des in∣valides at Paris. The navy of France is also very considerable. In the reign of Lewis XIV. they had no less than one hundred ships of the line of battle; and though their marine was almost en∣tirely destroyed in the late war, in which they were foiled in every engagement, yet they have been extremely active since the peace, in restoring it.
<PB N="88" REF="880"/>
But considering how low it was brought, it must require a great expence, and many years, to bring it to its former condition; and, indeed, as their trade, in consequence of the losses they suffered in the late war, is much less extensive than formerly, it cannot be supposed that this will be in their power, till they first find means to recover their losses, which, it is to be hoped, Great Britain will attentively guard against, as her prosperity and tranquility so much depend upon it. The seamen in the maritime provinces are registered, and di∣vided into classes: each class serves three or four years alternately; and those who are not in actual service, may enter on board merchant ships. The stations for the men of war, are Toulon on the Mediterranean, and Brest, Port-Louis, Rochefort, and Havre de Grace, on the channel; there are also fifteen gallies, which lie at Marseilles. A hundred independent companies are maintained to serve on board the ships of war as marines, and all the sea-ports are well fortified.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>In this government, which, besides the capital, comprehends a part of the neighbouring country, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Paris, the capital of the kingdom, in Latin Parisii, Lute, or Lutetia Parisiorum, situate on the river Seine, in the Isle of France, being one of the largest and finest cities in Europe. It de∣rived its modern name from the antient Parisii, and is supposed, by some, to have had the Latin name of Lutetia, from Lutum, mud, the place where
<PB REF="890"/>
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>A View of the City of Paris.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="89" REF="900"/>
it now stands, having been antiently very marshy and muddy. Ever since the reign of Hugh Capet, that is for near eight hundred years, this city hath been the usual residence of the kings of France: it is of a circular form, and, including the suburbs, about five French leagues, or fifteen English miles in circumference. The number of its inhabitants is computed at about five hundred thousand, that of its streets nine hundred and twelve, and that of its houses upwards of twenty thousand, exclusive of the public structures of all sorts. Its greatest defect, according to some, is the want of good drinking-water; but others tell us, that very fine water is brought by an aqueduct from the village of Arcueil, not far from Paris, but own the water of the Seine, and the city, is not good. The streets are of a proper breadth, well built, paved, and lighted. There is a great number of tribunals and offices here, most of which are kept in the Palais, situated on an island, to which it gives name. The number of churches, convents, hospitals, market-places, fountains, gates, and bridges, in this city, is very great, besides the university, se∣veral academies, public libraries, royal palaces, and castles, and above one hundred hotels, some of them very stately. But to be more particular, that part called la Cité, lies in the centre, and con∣sists of three islands formed by the Seine, viz. L'Isle de Palais, L'Isle de Notre Dame, and L'Isle Louviers. It is the principal of the three parts into which the city is divided, and contains the fol∣lowing remarkable structures, 1. Several bridges, of which some are of wood and others of stone, and have most of them a row of houses on each side; the chief of these are the Pont-neuf and Pont-royal; the first consists of twelve arches, which, properly speaking, make two bridges, the one leading from the suburbs of St. Germain to the city, and the
<PB N="90" REF="910"/>
other from thence to that part called la Ville: there is a carriage-way in the middle, thirty feet broad, and foot-walks on each side, raised two feet high; and, in the centre, stands a brass statue of king Henry IV. on horseback. On this bridge is also the building called La Samaritaine, from a group of figures upon it, representing our Saviour and the Samaritan woman, standing near Jacob's well. Here is a pump to raise the water, which, thro' several pipes, supplies the quarter of the Louvre, and some other parts of the town. The Pont∣royal, which leads to the Thuilleries, was built by order of Lewis XIV. in the room of a wooden bridge, that was carried away by the current in 1684. 2. The cathedral of Notre Dame, or our Lady, being dedicated to the Holy Virgin, which is a large stately Gothic structure, said to have been founded by king Childeric, and built in the form of a cross. Here, besides other great personages, are interred the cardinals de Retz and Noailles. From the two square towers belonging to it, is a noble prospect of the city and neighbouring coun∣try. Here is a vast quantity of gold and silver plate, rich tapestry, and fine paintings; and the number of the canons is no less than fifty. Near it stands the palace of the archbishop, in which is the advocates library: the revenue of the archbishop amounts to about one hundred and eighty thousand livers, and his taxation to the court of Rome, is four thousand two hundred and eighty three guilders. 3. The priory and parish church of St. Bartholomew, the last of which is the most beautiful in all this part of the city, and stands near the Palais. 4. The Palais, which gives name to an island, and in which the parliament, with a great many other courts, are held. It was antiently the residence of the kings, but was given to the officers of justice by Philip the Fair, who also settled the parliament here in

1302. The parliament, consisting of several cham∣bers, each of which has its department, is opened the day after Martinmas, with a solemn mass, ce∣lebrated by a bishop, and continues sitting till the eighth of September, when a vacation-chamber is appointed, during the interval, for criminal causes, and others which require dispatch. The jurisdic∣tion of this court is of great extent. There is a beautiful chapel belonging to the Palais, in which is also the prison, or jail, for the jurisdiction of the parliament, called in French, La Concier∣gerie. 5. The Hotel Dieu, the most antient and largest hospital in Paris, in which eight thousand sick and infirm poor are taken care of, and attended by the nuns of the order of St. Augustine. 6. The hospital of St. Catharine, where poor women and maidens are entertained three days, and attend∣ed by the abovementioned nuns. 7. The Grande Chatelet, where some of the inferior courts of ju∣stice hold their sessions. 8. Fort l'Eveque, in which is the mint, and a prison. It stands in or near the street la Ferroniere, in which Henry IV. was stabbed by Ravilliac. 9. St. Germain l'Auxerrois, which is called the royal parish church, because the palaces of the Louvre and Thuilleries stand in its parish. 10. The Louvre, an antient royal palace, of which a part was rebuilt by Lewis XIV. Had it been completed on the same plan, it would have been a most magnificent structure. <Q>On one of its gates is the following in∣scription, <HI>Dum totum impleat orbim,</HI> the meaning of which is, “May it last till the owner of it hath extended his sway over the whole world,” which implies what the French kings have constantly aimed at.</Q> Another inscription shews, at the same time, the vanity of the nation, and their abject flattery of their grande monarque. It may be rendered in English thus:</P>
<Q><PB N="92" REF="930"/>
<L>Louvre is a palace for great Lewis fit:</L>
<L>God him alone exceeds, as heaven does it.</L></Q>
<P>This palace is joined to the Thuilleries by a gallery, in which are one hundred and eighty models of fortresses, some situated in France, and some in other countries, executed with the utmost accu∣racy. Here is a valuable collection of paintings, the king's printing-house, the mint where the king's medals are struck, together with a prodigi∣ous quantity of rich tapestry hangings, and a col∣lection of antient arms, among which are those worn by Francis I. at the famous battle of Pavia. Here also the French academy, the academy of inscriptions and belles lettres, the royal academy of sciences, the academy of painting and sculp∣ture, and the royal academy of architecture, have their meetings. The first of these was founded for the improvement of the French language; and as for the others, their names explain the design of their institution. 11. Le Palais Royal, which was built by cardinal Richlieu, in the year 1636, and belongs to the duke of Orleans. It is said to con∣tain pictures to the value of four millions of livres, which were purchased by the regent of that title, and of which a part belonged to Christina, queen of Sweden. 12. The palace des Tuilleries, so called from a tile or brick kiln which stood there for∣merly. This palace, as we observed above, com∣municates with the Louvre by a gallery. Behind it are exceeding pleasant gardens, adorned with fine walks, planted with ever-greens, and other trees, and with beautiful parterres, where are to be seen, all the year round, every flower according to its season. There are also three fine fountains in the garden, and a canal. Behind the Tuilleries, on the bank of the river, are pleasant walks, composed of four rows of lofty elms, to which vast crouds of
<PB N="93" REF="940"/>
people resort in the fine weather, as well as to the gardens. In the palace is a spacious and magni∣ficent theatre, and hard by it are the Elysian fields, where a surprising number of coaches are to be seen in fair weather: not far off also is the church of St. Roche, where the celebrated poet Corneille is interred. 13. La place de Louis le Grand, a very beautiful square, in the centre of which is an eque∣strian statue of that king, which is justly accounted a master-piece. 14. The place, or square des Victoires, which is round, and contains a statue of Lewis XIV. of gilt brass, erected to him by the duke de la Fuillade, with this inscription, <HI>Viro immortali.</HI> 15. The royal library in the Rue Vivien, which contains ninety-four thousand printed books, thirty thousand manuscripts, and a prodigious collection of copper-plates and medals. Near by in the church-yard of St. Joseph, lies the famous comic poet Moliere. 16. The parish church of St. Eustace, which stands in the quarter of the same name, and contains the tomb of the great minister Colbert. 17. The gate of St. Dennis, which was erected as a triumphal arch in honour of Lewis XIV. 18. The gate of St. Martin, erected also in form of a triumphal arch, in honour of the same king. Not far from hence, in the church-yard of St. Nicholas des Champs, Peter Gassendi, and other learned men, are buried. 19. La Greve, an open place, where all public rejoicings are celebrated, and malefactors executed. 20. The hotel de Ville, which is a large building of Gothic architecture, though adorned with columns of the Corinthian order. 21. The arse∣nal in the quarter of St. Paul, consisting of many spacious buildings, among which are a foundery, and a house for making salt-petre. Here is a musque∣toon of two barrels, which, it is said, will pierce a thick board at the distance of six miles, and, for discerning an object at that distance, has a teles∣cope
<PB N="94" REF="950"/>
fixed to the barrel. 22. The Bastile, a kind of fortress like the Tower of London, which is used as a prison for state criminals, and for such as are taken up by letters de cachet, i. e. by warrants signed by the king, and sealed. 23. Le Temple, a commandery, of the knights of Malta, which gives name to a quarter, wherein, being a privi∣leged place, artificers, that are not freemen, may carry on their business without molestation. The temple is the residence of the grand-prior of the French nation. 24. That formerly called La Maison professe des Jesuites, in the quarter of St. Anthony, in the church of which the hearts of Lewis XIII. and XIV. are preserved, each in a casket of gold, support∣ed by two angels of massy silver, and as big as the life, hovering with expanded wings. In the same quar∣ter is a fine looking glass manufacture, where above five hundred persons are employed in polishing plates, cast at St. Gobin; with a convent of Fran∣ciscans, the monks of which are called Pique-puces, or Prick-fleas.</P>

<HEAD>In that part of the city called the UNIVERSITY, the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>1. The university which gives name to it, and which was first founded, as it is said, by Charles the Great: all the arts and sciences are taught here, particularly law, physic, and divinity. There are above forty colleges, of which the chief are those of the Sorbonne, of Navarre, of the faculty of physic, and of the four nations; but lectures are read only in eleven of them. The head of the university is the rector, who is chosen every three months, but sometimes is continued several years. All the professors have settled salaries; the whole annual income of the university amounting, it is said, to about fifty thousand livres. 2. The Gobelins,
<PB N="95" REF="960"/>
a house or palace, where a great number of inge∣nious artists, in various manufactures and handi∣crafts, are employed by the government. The most curious tapestry of all sorts is made here. 3. The General Hospital, a most noble foundation for the poor of the female sex, hear seven thou∣sand objects being taken care of and provided for. The sick are carefully tended, and those that are in health are obliged to work; different wards being allotted for foundlings, for girls who sew and knit, prostitutes, idiots, and poor women: of the last, some are kept gratis, and others pay a small matter. In the castle of Bicêtre, belonging to this hospital, and consisting of many large build∣ings, are near four thousand persons of the other sex, among which are persons disordered in their senses, and such as are afflicted with the venereal disease. To this hospital are also sent children who abuse their parents, and lead dissolute lives. The fund for the maintenance of it, and the hos∣pital de la Pictie, where poor children are brought up, together with the Hotel Dieu, amounts to above two millions of livres per annum. 4. The King's Physic Garden, in which are an infinite va∣riety of plants and trees; a certain sum being al∣lotted by the king for keeping the garden in order, and improving it, and for lectures on botany, ana∣tomy, chymistry, and the materia medica. A cu∣rious collection of natural curiosities is kept here. 5. The abbey of St. Victor, in which is a public library, containing some very antient and scarce books, several curious manuscripts, and a prodi∣gious collection of maps and copper-plates. 6. The College of Physicians, to which belong five pro∣fessors. 7. The Little Chatelet, an old fortress, now used for a prison. 8. The Rue St. Jacques, chiefly inhabited by booksellers. 9. The Royal College, and that of Lewis the Great: to the former be∣long
<PB N="96" REF="970"/>
twelve professors. 10. The abbey of St. Gene∣vieve, in which is the marble monument of king Clovis, the shrine of St. Genevieve, a large library, with a cabinet of antiquities, and natural curiosi∣ties. 11. The Royal Observatory, a most stately edi∣fice, built on the highest part of the city. Several astronomers are maintained here by the king. 12. The Royal Academy of Surgery, instituted in 1731. 13. The convent of Franciscans, in the quar∣ter of St. Andrew, the richest in France. In the same quarter are some remains of the palace of Ju∣lian the Apostate, in which Childebert, and some other kings of the Franks, afterwards resided. 14. The play-house. 15. The convent of Carthusians, in the quarter of Luxemburgh, containing fine paint∣ings. 16. The palace of Luxemburgh, or Orleans, a magnificent structure, containing also some fine paint∣ings by Rubens, and embellished with a noble gar∣den. In the Hotel des Ambassadeurs, ambassadors ex∣traordinary are entertained for three days, and those of remote countries all the time they stay at Paris. 17. The abbey of St. Germain des Prez, which con∣tains a very valuable library, the manuscripts alone making eight thousand volumes: here also is a cabinet of antiquities. 18. The Hotel royal des In∣valides, erected by Lewis XIV. in which lame and superannuated officers and soldiers are maintained. The buildings take up no less than seventeen acres. The number of common soldiers here amount to about three thousand, and of officers to about five hundred. The chapel is very magnificent. Hard by is a military academy, in which five hundred young gentlemen are instructed in the art of war. These are the principal places in this celebrated city and suburbs: our proposed brevity would not admit of our being more particular.</P>
<P>The environs of Paris are very pleasant, and contain a number of small towns and villages, with
<PB N="97" REF="980"/>
some fine seats; among the last in this govern∣ment, is the royal palace of Madrid; that of the duke of Bourbon at St. Maur des Fossez; of the archbishop of Paris, near the conflux of the Seine and Marne, called Conflans; of the prince of Conde at Issy; of the count of Thoulouse's at Rambouillet; and those called Maisons and Colaguy, the latter of which belongs to the duke of Maine.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of the ISLE of FRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>In this government is included not only the Isle of France, but a part also of Perche, Picardy, Brie, Gatinois, Beauce, and all Le Vexin Francois. It is fruitful in grain, fruits, and wine, and con∣tains the following remarkable places,</P>
<P>St. Denis, commonly called St. Denis en France, in Latin, Sti Dionysii Fanum, which lies about two leagues from Paris to the north. Here is an abbey of great antiquity, which has been lately rebuilt, dedicated to St. Denis, the patron, or tutelar saint of France. It has an elegant garden, and contains a rich treasure, in which are also kept the crown-jewels. In its church are the sepulchres of the French kings, the princes and princesses of the blood, and other great personages, particularly that of marshal Turenne. The convent, which is of the Benedictine order, and, with its precincts, immediately subject to the pope, has an income of about sixty thousand livres, together with the lord∣ship of the town. The title of abbot was suppressed in 1692, and his revenue granted to the convent of St. Cyr, founded by Lewis XIV. for the edu∣cation of ladies. This town is also noted for its fairs.</P>
<P>Vincennes, a palace hard by Paris, standing in a fine park, or wood, called Le Bois de Vincennes,
<PB N="98" REF="990"/>
which belongs to the king, together with the pa∣lace. The park takes up one thousand four hun∣dred and sixty-four acres of ground. The avenue leading to the castle, which is used as a state-pri∣son, is planted with four rows of stately elms; and not far from it is a menagerie and a manufac∣ture of porcelain.</P>
<P>Montmorency, a little old town, three leagues from Paris to the north-west. The antient dukes of Montmorenci took their name and title of duke from this town, in the church of which their tombs are to be seen. It now belongs to the house of Condé, and contains a convent of monks of the Holy Trinity, for the redemption of captives.</P>
<P>Charenton, a considerable town, situated on the Marne, over which it has a stone bridge, about two short leagues from Paris. Here, before the revocation of the edict of Nantz, the Huguenots had their principal church, and their most emi∣nent preachers and divines.</P>
<P>Brie Comte Robert, a little town on the river Yerre.</P>
<P>Corbeil, a town at the conflux of the Essone and Seine, in which is an hospital, with several con∣vents and churches. Its chief trade is in skins, and it has two bridges, one over the Seine, and the other over the Essone, or Juine.</P>
<P>Crespy, the capital of the duchy of Valois, situ∣ated eleven miles from Paris to the north-east, and belonging, together with the duchy, to the duke of Orleans. Here are two churches, and a con∣vent, and a considerable trade in grain and wood.</P>
<P>Senlis, a town near the little river Nonette, seven leagues from Paris to the north, which is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Rheims, whose revenue is above twenty thousand livres. The air here is reckoned very healthful,
<PB N="99" REF="1000"/>
for which reason several of the children of France have been nursed in its castle. There is also a gra∣nary in the town; the inhabitants of which are chiefly employed in washing and preparing the wool for the manufactures of Beauvais.</P>
<P>Chantilly, a pretty little town, belonging to the house of Conde, which has a seat in it.</P>
<P>Compeigne, an antient town, situated on the Oise, near the forest, which takes its name from it, thirteen leagues from Paris to the north-west. The Maid of Orleans was taken prisoner by the English at this place, in 1430. There is a royal palace here, which was repaired by Lewis XIV. and the gardens laid out, as they are at present, with a Be∣nedictine abbey, dedicated to St. Cornelius, and some trade in corn, wood, and wool. The town, with its forest, the latter of which contains twenty-nine thousand acres, belong to the king, and have never been alienated since the time of Clovis.</P>
<P>Villers Corteretz, a little town, five leagues from Compeigne to the south-east, at the side of the forest of Retz, whence it derives its name. Here is a fine palace belonging to the duke of Or∣leans, and an abbey.</P>
<P>Soissons, in Latin, Noviodunum, and Augusta Suessionum, the capital of this government, situ∣ated seven leagues from Paris to the north-east, and about eight from Rheims to the west, in a pleasant valley, on the banks of the river Aisne, over which there is a stone bridge. The town is pretty large and well built, being the seat of a governor-general, and of an office of the finances, a salt-office, several courts of justice, and also of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Rheims, and has the right to anoint the French kings during the vacancy of the archiepiscopal see, or in the archbishop's absence, with a revenue of eighteen thousand livres per annum, out of which
<PB N="100" REF="1010"/>
he pays a tax to Rome of two thousand four hun∣dred florins. Antiently, this town was the seat of Devitiacus, one of the kings of the Gauls; af∣terwards, for some time, of the Roman praetors, in Gallia Belgica; and then of the first French kings, being then the capital of a kingdom, to which it also gave name, as it does now to a territory called Le Soissonnois. It drives a great trade in corn, contains several abbies and other religious houses, with an old castle, and has an academy of men of wit and genius, whose object is the same as that of the French academy at Paris. The late prince Eugene's mother had the title of countess of Sois∣sons.</P>
<P>Noyon, in Latin Noviodunum, Noviomagum, Noviomum, and Noviomagus Vuromanduorum, a large, antient, well built town, on the declivity of a hill by the river Vorse, which, at a little distance from hence falls into the Oise, sixteen leagues from Paristo the north. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Rheims, and a count and peer of France, whose revenue amounts to about twen∣ty-five thousand livres per annum. The cele∣brated John Calvin was a native of this town, which is the seat of a governor, and several courts of justice, containing also several churches and con∣vents, with two abbies, an episcopal palace, a ca∣thedral, some handsome fountains, two public gar∣dens, and two hospitals. It gives name to a ter∣ritory, called Le Noyonnois, has several manufac∣tures, and carries on a trade in wheat and oats, which it sends to Paris.</P>
<P>Laon, in Latin Laudunum, Laudunum Cla∣vatum, Laodunum, or Lodunum, a handsome town, situated in a good air, twenty-two leagues from Paris to the north-east. It is the seat of a governor and several courts of justice, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop
<PB N="101" REF="1020"/>
of Rheims, and a duke and peer, having a reve∣nue of thirty thousand livres per annum, out of which he pays the court of Rome four thousand florins. The town gives name to a district, and contains an old castle, with several convents and churches, besides the cathedral, and a college, which is maintained at the expence of the city.</P>
<P>Promontrè, a village four leagues from Noyon to the east, noted for an abbey, the chief of the or∣der of Praemonstratenses, with a revenue of forty-five thousand livres per annum.</P>
<P>Beauvais, in Latin Bellovacum and Caesaro Ma∣gus, the capital of the province, called from the town Beauvaisis, situated fourteen leagues from Paris to the north-west, and twelve from Rouen to the east. It is the see of a bishop, who is both spi∣ritual and temporal lord of the city, suffragan to the archbishop of Rheims, and a duke and peer of France, with a revenue of fifty-five thousand livres per annum, out of which he pays the pope four thousand six hundred florins. Here is a great number of churches and convents, several courts of justice, with manufactures of tapestry, linen, serge, and woollen cloths.</P>
<P>Clermont en Bauvaisis, a considerable town, situated on the river Breche, five leagues from Beauvais.</P>
<P>Gerberoi, a small town four or five leagues from Beauvais, near which, in a valley still called the Valley of Arundel, the English, under the com∣mand of the earl of Arundel, were totally de∣feated, in the year 1435; and the earl himself re∣ceived a wound, of which he died soon after.</P>
<P>Pontoise or Pont-Oise, the capital of the terri∣tory called Vexin Francois, standing five leagues from Paris to the north-west, on the Oise, over which it has a bridge, as its name implies. Hither the parliament of Paris was banished, in 1720 and 1753,
<PB N="102" REF="1030"/>
by the present king of France. This town is the seat of several courts, and contains two convents, one of Capuchins, and another of Benedictines.</P>
<P>Mante, a town situated nine leagues from Paris, on the Seine, over which it has a fine stone bridge, of thirty-nine arches. Here are several courts, convents, and churches. Over-against the town is a pleasant island in the Seine, called Champion.</P>
<P>Meulan, a little town, seven leagues below Pa∣ris, on the Seine, over which it has two bridges. It gives name to a district, and contains several churches, a fort, and two convents.</P>
<P>Dreux, a very antient town, situated on the little river Blaise, about thirteen or fourteen leagues from Paris to the west, which is thought either to have given name to the Druids, or to have borrowed its name from them. Here is a woollen manufac∣ture, that furnishes cloathing to the army; and, in time of peace, corn and wine are sent from hence to Rouen, and from that city to Holland and England. A great battle was fought near this town, in 1562, between the Roman catholics and the Huguenots, in which the latter were defeated. This town gives the title of count, and contains a castle, several churches, and two convents.</P>
<P>St. Cloud, a borough situated on the Seine, two leagues below Paris, and belonging to the archbi∣shop of that city, to whom it gives the title of duke and peer. The duke of Orleans has a pa∣lace here, with very fine gardens.</P>
<P>Versailles, a town situated four leagues from Paris to the south-west. Here Lewis XIV. built a most magnificent palace, and adorned it with no∣ble gardens: it stands on a rising ground, in the middle of a valley surrounded with hills, having, on the side towards Paris, a fine avenue leading to it through the town, which it divides into the Old and New. To give a particular account of this
<PB N="103" REF="1040"/>
palace would be inconsistent with our plan: suffice it to say, that it consists of several courts, embellished (both within and without) in the most sumptuous manner. The grove here is exceeding beautiful, and the water-works very grand. The menagerie consists of seven courts, and contains a vast number of rare animals. In the palace all the parts in the inside, that are not hung with tapestries, are lined with marble; and the nearer you come to the king's apartments, the more costly is the marble, and the finer the sculp∣ture and painting. It would require volumes to describe the various paintings and antique statues, with which all the apartments abound. The chapel is an exquisite piece of architecture, sculp∣ture, and painting. Of all the apartments, the king's bedchamber is the most magnificent; the bed, which is of crimson velvet, embroidered with gold, standing in a kind of alcove, where are two figures of Fame represented sitting. The canal in the gar∣den, by which the river Eure is conveyed to it, is a very noble one: the orangery or greenhouse is ac∣counted a fine piece of architecture, and indeed a master-piece of its kind; the parterre before it also is very beautiful, being adorned with a great number of orange and lemon-trees, myrtles, lau∣rels, &amp;c. the Labyrinth or Maze is a fine grove, so called, because its several walks are so interwoven with each other, that it would be a difficult matter for a person to find his way out of it without a guide: in short, the garden, for statues, canals, groves, grottos, fountains, and every thing that can render it delightful, is superior to any thing of the kind in Europe. The royal cabinet contains the choicest medals, coins, paintings, &amp;c. that Italy could af∣ford. The stables, for proportion, conveniency, beauty, and architecture, far exceed many royal pa∣laces. In the same park stands the fine palace of
<PB N="104" REF="1050"/>
Trianon, the outside of which consists wholly of va∣riegated marble, of exquisite workmanship. The gardens are large, and abound in statues and water-works.</P>
<P>Marly, a village, where is a fine royal palace, in a wood near the Seine, and in the neighbourhood of Versailles, with beautiful gardens. The engine here for raising water from the Seine, to supply the reservoirs and water-works, is equally grand and ingenious, and, with the other water-works, cost immense sums; the water being conveyed over several hills to the great reservoir here, and from thence to Versailles. The yearly expence of keeping the machine in repair is said to be an hun∣dred and fifty thousand livres.</P>
<P>St. Germain en Laye, a town in the forest of Laye, on the banks of the Seine, four leagues from Paris to the west. It is chiefly remarkable for two castles, or royal palaces, the gardens of which were formerly very noble, but are now much neglected: those of one of them extend to the very banks of the river. Lewis XIV. was born in the new; and the late king James kept his little court in the old, after the Revolution, and died in it September 6th, 1701. The forest and park, contiguous to the castles, are very beautiful.</P>
<P>St. Cyr, a convent of nuns of the order of St. Augustine, founded, in 1686, by Madame Mainte∣non, mistress of Lewis XIV. It is a very spacious and splendid structure, and contains fifty ladies of quality, and two hundred and fifty pupils or young ladies; for instructing of whom, in every branch of education becoming their rank and sex, there are thirty-six lay-sisters. The revenue of this foundation is about an hundred and eighty thousand livres. The young ladies continue until they are twenty, when they may either take the veil, or marry, or return to their relations: if they marry, they have
<PB N="105" REF="1060"/>
a portion of four hundred pistoles; and if they chuse to be nuns, they are admitted into the royal abbies gratis. The vacancies among the fifty la∣dies are filled up from among the pupils.</P>
<P>Poissy, a little town, situated on the Seine, over which it has a large and beautiful bridge of stone. Here, on Thursdays, is a famous market for cat∣tle. A conference was held, in 1561, betwixt the papists and protestants in this city, but without ef∣fect; the famous Beza arguing for the protestants. Here also St. Lewis, king of France, was born. The town contains several churches and convents, with a salt-office.</P>
<P>Meudon, a large open town, two leagues below Paris. Here is a fine royal palace, which was the favourite residence of the only son of Lewis XIV. and stands in the midst of a forest. It is adorned with rich furniture, marble statues, and fine pic∣tures of Roman emperors and antient philosophers. From the terraces there is a fine view of the coun∣try round Paris, together with the course of the Seine.</P>
<P>Dourdan, a town situated on the river Orge, two or three leagues from Estampes, to the west, and famous for its manufacture of silk and woollen stockings.</P>
<P>Mont-Lehery, a little town, six leagues from Paris.</P>
<P>Melun, an antient town, situated on the river Seine, about eight leagues above Paris to the south-east, part of which stands upon an island in the Seine, and is joined to the rest by two bridges. It carries on a trade with Paris in corn, wine, flour, and cheese, and contains several churches and con∣vents, with a salt-magazine.</P>
<P>Fountainbleau, a town in the middle of a forest, one league from the Seine, and eleven from Paris
<PB N="106" REF="1070"/>
to the south. It is of note chiefly for a royal castle or palace, which is very spacious, but lies in a bot∣tom. The forest is very large, and abounds with game, springs, and hills, covered with naked crag∣gy rocks, so that it is very romantic. Here the king often takes the diversion of hunting. That called the stag-gallery, running along the orangery at Fountainbleau, is decorated with paintings of all the royal palaces and seats, between which are stags heads, and under each head an inscription, shewing in what wood, and by what king, the stag was kill∣ed. The gardens are all very beautiful, being adorned with statues and fountains.</P>
<P>Nemours, a little town, situated between the fo∣rests of Fountainbleau and Montargis, on the ri∣ver Loing, about twelve leagues from Paris to the south, and belonging to the duke of Orleans. It contains several convents and churches. Its trade consists in corn, wine, flour, and cheese, which they sell in the adjacent villages, or send to Paris by the Seine.</P>
<P>Courtnay, a small town on the Brook-Clairy, six∣teen leagues from Paris to the south, which gave name to the illustrious house of Courtnay, a branch of which came into England with William the Conqueror, and founded the family of that name, which still subsists here.</P>
<P>Estampes, a considerable town on the river Juine, seven or eight leagues from Paris, con∣taining several convents and churches, with a gra∣nary for salt.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of PICARDY and ARTOIS.</HEAD>
<P>This government produces wine and grain, with fruits of all kinds, and plenty of hay, especially along the Oise, but wood is scarce; for which reason the people burn turf, except in the Boulon∣nois,
<PB N="107" REF="1080"/>
where they have pit-coal. Picardy, the name of which is thought to be derived from Pi∣card, signifying a passionate wrangler, is bounded on the east by Champagne; on the south by the Isle of France; on the north by the Pais de Calais, Artois, and Hainault; and on the west by Nor∣mandy and the channel. Its rivers are the Somme, which rises in the Vermandois, and falls into the channel; the Oise, in Latin Isara, which rises in Picardy, and at Conflans, falls into the Seine; and the Canche, which rises in Artois, and falls into the sea at Staples. The other smaller rivers are, the Lauthie, the La Lis, the Aa, the Scarpe, and the Deule. This province, in consequence of its flourishing manufactures, its situation upon the sea, and its fisheries, is the seat of a very extensive trade. Like most of the other provinces, it had formerly its petty princes, dependent, however, on the crown of France. For the administration of justice here are many inferior courts subordinate to the parliament of Paris. That part of the province which is annexed to the government of the Isle of France, consisting of the Beauvaisois, Noyonnois, Laonnois, and Soissonnois, hath been already de∣scribed. In that part which lies within this govern∣ment the principal places are,</P>
<P>Guise, the capital of the district of Thierache, standing on the Oise, towards the borders of Hai∣nault, twenty-six leagues from Paris to the north-west. It has a strong castle, and gives name to a duchy and peerage, belonging to the house of Bourbon-Condé. The duchy is very large, and the town, being situated on the frontiers of the Low-Countries, is regarded as one of the bulwarks of the kingdom, and consequently strongly for∣tified.</P>

<PB N="108" REF="1090"/>
By the sluices, on the Oise, the adjacent country may be laid under water for several miles. Here are two churches and two convents, a castle, a salt-office, an arsenal, a powder-mill, with a foun∣dery, and barracks; and, in the neighbourhood, are several glass-houses, particularly at St. Gobin, where very large plates of looking-glass are cast, and afterwards polished at the Gobelins.</P>
<P>St. Quentin, a considerable town on the Somme, twenty-five miles from Paris to the north. The collegiate church is dedicated to St. Quentin, from whom the town takes its name, and is one of the finest in France.

<P>Peronne, a little but very strong town, on the river Somme, twenty-five leagues from Paris to the north. Though often besieged it was never taken, for which reason the French call it La Pu∣celle, the Maiden. The town is very antient, con∣tains several churches and convents, and is the ca∣pital of the district called Santerre. Great quan∣tities of linen are made in the neighbouring coun∣try.</P>
<P>Mondidier, a strong town, four leagues from Pe∣ronne to the south.</P>
<P>Nesle, a small town, four leagues from Peronne to the south. It is the first marquisate of France, and belongs to the house of Mailly.</P>

Here are also three bridges over as many channels of the Somme, a great many churches, besides the cathedral, several convents, hospitals, and manufactures, with an academy of the arts and sciences. Voiture, Rohault, and many other eminent men, were natives of this town. The ramparts make a fine walk, being planted with a double row of trees.</P>
<P>Conti, a small town about five leagues from Amiens, which gives the title of prince to a branch of the house of Bourbon.</P>

The woollen cloths made here are said not to be greatly inferior to the English and Dutch. Abbeville took its name from the abbey of St. Requier, having been formerly only a manor belonging to that abbey.</P>

<P>Boulogne, in Latin Bonania, or Bononia, a city at the mouth of the little river Liane, seven leagues from Calais, thirteen from Abbeville, and eight from the nearest coast of England. It is the capi∣tal of the Boulonois, a district which enjoys parti∣cular privileges, being exempted from several taxes, and having a governor independent of the governor-general of Picardy. The harbour, which is de∣fended by a fort, cannot be entered but at high∣water, and not even then without danger and diffi∣culty. The road too is dangerous, unless in calm weather, and when the wind is betwixt the north and south-east points. The town is divided into the upper and lower: the latter, though larger, and handsomer is not so well fortified, nor inhabited by so many persons of quality as the former. The bishop of Boulogne is suffragan to the archbishop of Rheims, and has a revenue of twelve thousand
<PB N="111" REF="1120"/>
livres, out of which he pays a tax to the court of Rome of fifteen hundred florins: here is a court of admiralty, and other courts, a strong citadel, and several convents. The city and its territory was formerly a part of the earldom of Flanders, after∣wards it had earls of its own, who were vassals, first to the counts of Flanders, and then to the counts of Artois. Near it is a mineral spring, called La Fontaine de Fer, that is the Iron-spring.</P>

<P>Andres, a fortified town, three leagues from Calais to the south. Near this town Francis I. and Henry VIII. of England, had an interview; their retinue was so richly dressed, that the place, where they met, hath ever since been called Le Champ de drap d'Or, the Field of the Cloth of Gold.</P>
<P>Calais, a town situated on the narrowest part of the channel, opposite to Dover, from which it is distant about seven leagues. It is the capital of the Pais Reconquis, or Recovered Country, pretty large, and well fortified, but the harbour is of very difficult and dangerous access. Here is a fine arsenal, and a citadel, which commands the town, the harbour, and all the adjacent country, several convents, and a fort, whence all the country about the town may be laid under water in twenty-four hours. By the canal of Calais, the inhabitants
<PB N="112" REF="1130"/>
have an easy communication with St. Omer, Grave∣line, Dunkirk, Bergues, and Ypres. In time of peace, a packet-boat passes regularly twice a week, betwixt this place and England.</P>
<P>Artois, the other part of this government, is one of the finest and most fertile provinces of the whole kingdom; formerly it was one of the seven∣teen provinces of the Netherlands, but now be∣longs entirely to France. The names of Artois, and Arras, its capital, are derived from the Atre∣bates, a people of Gallia Belgica, mentioned by Julius Caesar. Its greatest length from, north to south, is about twenty-four leagues, and its breadth about twelve, being bounded to the south and west by Picardy, to the east by Hainault, and to the north by Flanders. A considerable trade is carried on in the province in grain, flax, hops, wool, and linen cloth. The states, who meet re∣gularly once a year, consist of the clergy, nobility, and commoners, and sit generally a fortnight at Arras; their chief business is to deliberate on the ways and means to raise the money which the king demands of them, and which usually amounts to about four hundred thousand livres, exclusive of forage-money. The most considerable places in Artois are,</P>
<P>Arras, the Origiacum of Ptolomy, situated on the Scarpe, ten leagues from Amiens to the north, sixteen from Dunkirk to the south, and six from Cambray to the north-west. It is well fortified, and pretty large, being divided into the city and town, of which the former is the most antient. Here is the see of a bishop, who is lord of the city, and president of the assembly of the states, and has a revenue of twenty-two thousand livres, out of which he pays a tax to the pope of four thousand florins. The governor's house, the town-house, the cathedral, and the church, belonging to the
<PB N="113" REF="1140"/>
abbey of St. Vast, are stately structures, besides which there are several convents, nunneries, and hospitals in the town.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of CHAMPAGNE and BRIE.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Champagne is bounded on the north by Hainault and the bishopric of Liege; on the south by Burgundy; on the east by Luxem∣burg and Lorrain; and on the west by the Isle of France and Picardy, being in length about one hundred and sixty five miles, and in breadth from one hundred and twenty to forty-five. Its princi∣pal rivers are the Seine, the Marne, the Aube, and the Aisne. The Maes also has its source in this province, but soon runs out of it into the duchy of Bar, whence it returns again; and after passing by Sedan and Charleville, and traversing the Austrian and United Netherlands, falls into the sea near the Briel. The air of this province is very wholesome, and though it does not produce much wheat, yet is noted for its wine, rye, large plains, and rich pastures: in some places also there are mines of iron and other metals, mineral waters, and forests, abounding with game. Cham∣pagne derives its name from its extensive plains, and its trade consists chiefly in corn, wine, and iron: it was conquered, with the rest of Gaul, by Julius Caesar; and after the declension of the Roman empire, had its earls or counts, who were absolute sovereigns of it, and governed it till the year 1274, when it was annexed by marriage to the crown of France: the whole of it is under the ju∣risdiction of the parliament of Paris, except the territory of Sedan, which belongs to that of Metz.
<PB N="115" REF="1160"/>
It contains two archbishoprics and four bishoprics with the following towns and places of note.</P>
<P>Troyes, in Latin Treca, Tricassis, Trecassium, or Treces, and antiently Augustabona, or Au∣gusta Trecassinorum, the capital of the province, seated on the river Seine, twenty-six leagues from Paris to the south-east. It is pretty large, but far from being so populous and flourishing as formerly, though the see of a bishop, suffragan of Sens, whose yearly revenue is fourteen thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to the court of Rome two thou∣sand florins. Eighteen of the prelates of this town have been canonized for saints. Tho' its trade is much decayed, yet it is still considerable, and seve∣ral manufactures are carried on in it: the neigh∣bouring country is pleasant and fruitful in wine, grain, and pasture. Here are many religious houses and churches, with a commandery of the order of Malta, several courts of justice, and a salt-office.</P>
<P>Pont-sur seine, a town, as its name shews, situated on the Seine, with a bridge over it, seven leagues from Troyes, and nineteen from Paris. Here is a magnificent seat, with fine gardens be∣longing to it.</P>

Here king Clovis was baptized, with his court and principal nobility, by St. Rhemigius. Rheims is the see of an archbishop, who is the first duke and peer of France, primate of Gallia Belgica, perpetual le∣gate of the see of Rome, and lord of the old town, which is called the city: his income is said to amount to fifty thousand livres, and his taxation at Rome to four thousand seven hundred and fifty florins. In the cathedral the French kings are usually crowned, and anointed with the sacred oil, which is said to have been brought from heaven at the inauguration of Clovis, and is preserved in a small vessel, called La Sainte Ampouille, or the Holy Phial, kept in the church of the noble abbey of St. Remi, in this town: the gate and portico of the cathedral are the most stately in the kingdom: the university was founded about the middle of the sixteenth century, by Charles, cardinal of Lor∣rain, and archbishop of this city. There are still some remains of antiquity here, particularly of two triumphal arches, some causeways, and three gates, which still retain the names of the Sun, Mars, and Ceres, together with a great many churches and convents, two commanderies, seve∣ral hospitals, and courts of judicature.

It is very fertile in corn, wine, fruit, and tobacco; being watered by the Seine, the Dehune, which falls into the Soane, the Brebince, or Bour∣bince, the Armancon, the Ouche, and the Tille. There are some noted mineral springs in it, with subterraneous lakes, and plenty of ochre. For a long time it had dukes of its own, subordinate to the crown of France; but Lewis XI. at last, upon the failure of heirs male, seized upon it, and an∣nexed it to his crown. The whole government lies within the jurisdiction of the parliament of Bur∣gundy, except a small part, that is subject to that of Paris. The states meet regularly every three years, to raise the sums required of them by the court: but the country of Charolois and Macon∣nois have their particular states; and the princi∣pality of Dombes is independent of this govern∣ment, though it lies within its circuit.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of DAUPHINE.</HEAD>
<P>Dauphiné is bounded on the south by Provence; on the north by Bresse and the Rhone; on the east by the Alps and Savoy; and on the west by the Rhone, which separates it from the Lyonnois and Languedoc. It had long princes of its own, who were stiled dauphins du Viennois. At last Dauphin Humbert, having no children, made it over to Philip VI. of France, on condition that the inhabitants should still retain their privileges, that the province should be for ever incorporated with the crown of France, and that the king's eldest son should enjoy it, with the arms and title of dauphin. In the year 1349 this agreement was fully execu∣ted. Near two-thirds of the province are very bar∣ren and mountainous; but the mountains contain a variety of minerals, and in some places are co∣vered with larch-trees, which are very valuable, as they not only yield a very durable wood, but also manna benzoin, and agaric, the last of which is used in physic and dying scarlet. The more level and more fruitful part of the province is called Lower Dauphiné. On the mountains are also found several sorts of wild animals, as bears, mar∣mots, chamois goats, and another species of goats, called by the French bouquettons, or chevrels, together with white hares, partridges, eagles,
<PB N="126" REF="1270"/>
hawks, &amp;c. The principal rivers are the Rhone, the Durance, the Isere, and the Drome. There are several mineral springs and natural curiosities in Dauphiné, of which we shall take some farther notice in our particular description of the province. Dauphiné is rather a particular state than a pro∣vince, incorporated with the rest of the kingdom. It has its governor and parliament, and is divided into Upper and Lower, in which the most noted places are,</P>
<P>Grenoble, the capital, situated at the conflux of the Isere and Drac. It was antiently called Gratiano∣polis, from the emperor Gratian, which at last was corrupted into Grenoble. Here the parliament of the province sits, and here the governor and lieu∣tenant general reside. The town is pleasant, po∣pulous, and well-fortified, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Vienne, and has a revenue of twenty-eight thousand livres per annum, out of which he pays a taxation to Rome of one thousand florins. Here are manufactures of coarse woollen stuffs, skins, gloves, with an arsenal, a citadel, a general hospital, and a fine epis∣copal palace, and another, in which the courts of justice are held. Three leagues from the city, a∣mong the Alps, lies a famous monastery of Carthu∣sians, called by the French, La grande Chartreuse, because it is the first of that order, founded by St. Bruno. The situation and prospect are very ro∣mantic, the monastery standing high, amidst mountains, woods, and rocks. Near it is the vil∣lage Carthreuse, from which the order derived its name. Strangers that visit the convent are enter∣tained gratis. Here the general of the order is chosen, and resides during life. About three leagues from Grenoble is a piece of ground that emits smoak, and sometimes small flames; and at the distance of one league are the caves of Sassen∣age,
<PB N="127" REF="1280"/>
and a grotto, in which is a water-fall. Here also among the gravel in the springs are found a sort of precious stones, some white, some of a dark grey colour, very smooth, and of a fine lustre. Those of the size and shape of a lin-seed are not only the best, but being dropt into the eye, they expel all impurities, without injuring it in the least. About five leagues from Grenoble is the mineral spring of La Mothe, the waters of which are pretty hot, and highly esteemed as a certain re∣medy for all disorders of the stomach, fluxes, and even lameness.</P>
<P>St. Bonnet, a small place, but the capital of the country of Champsaur, which belongs at present to the family of Villeroi.</P>
<P>Briançon, a little old town, at the conflux of the Dure and Ance, whence it has its name. It is the capital of the district, called from it Brian∣çonnois, and has a castle situated on a steep rock. On the leaves of the larch trees hereabouts is gathered a manna, which falls in the night, and melts as soon as the sun shines upon it. The hotter the season, the more plentiful it is.</P>
<P>Monetier, a town in the district of Briançon, where is a spring, that spouts out water, now and then, six feet high, and sometimes more.</P>
<P>Ambrun, or Embrun, the capital of the mari∣time Alps, and the territory, called from the town, Ambrunois. It stands on a steep rock, at the foot of which runs the Durance, and is the see of an archbishop, who stiles himself prince and count of Ambrun, and is lord of half the city, with an yearly revenue of twenty-two thousand livres. His taxation to Rome is two thousand four hundred florins.</P>
<P>Gap, in Latin, Vapincum, the capital of the territory, called from it Gapençois, and the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Aix, who
<PB N="128" REF="1290"/>
has a revenue of eleven thousand livres per annum, and is taxed to Rome fourteen hundred florins. At St. Peter d'Argenson, in the Gapençois, is a mineral water, which has been found to be a good febrifuge; and about half a league from the town, in the lake of Pelhotiers, is what is called a float∣ing meadow, consisting of grass and rushes, ce∣mented as it were by slime, and the froth of the water.</P>
<P>Vienne, in Latin, Vienna Allobrogum, a town situated on the Rhone, about thirteen leagues from Grenoble, which antiently was a Roman colony, and afterwards the capital of the kingdom of Bur∣gundy. Though much declined from what it was formerly, it is still pretty large, and the see of an archbishop, who has the title of upper primate of Gaul, and an annual revenue of twenty-two thousand livres, out of which his taxation at Rome is one thousand eight hundred and fifty - four florins. Here are several courts of justice, and a great many convents, with a manufactory of hard∣ware and paper, and some remains of Roman edifices. The town gives name to a district, called Viennois, in which are several springs of mineral waters.</P>
<P>Tain, a small town in the Viennois, near which is produced that excellent wine called Hermitage.</P>
<P>Roussillon, a village on the Rhone, which gives name to a county.</P>
<P>Albon, a small place, giving name to a county, from whose counts descended the antient princes of this province; and one of these having been bap∣tized Dauphin, all his successors from him were stiled dauphins, and the country Dauphiné.</P>
<P>St. Antoine, a village in Viennois, where is a famous abbey, and the only one of the order of St. Anthony.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="1300"/>
Valence, the capital of the district of Valentinois, which is a duchy and peerage belonging to the prince of Monaco, whose father, a son of mar∣shal Matignon, married the heiress of Manaco, of the Grimaldi family. The town, which stands on the Rhone, eleven leagues from Vienne, is very antient, pretty large, and well fortified, and the see of a bishop, suffragan of the archbishop of Vi∣enne, whose revenue amounts to sixteen thousand livres per annum, out of which his taxation at the court of Rome is two thousand three hundred and eighty-nine florins. Here are several courts of justice and convents, with an university, which was removed hither from Grenoble by Lewis XI.</P>
<P>Die, in Latin, Dea Vocontiorum, situated on the Dromme, over which there is a bridge, ten leagues from Grenoble. It is the capital of the district, called from it Diois, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Vienne, and lord of the city, and has a revenue of fifteen thou∣sand livres per annum, out of which his taxation to Rome is two thousand one hundred and twenty-six florins. Not far from hence, at Pont de Baret, are springs of great efficacy against agues. At Bardoire also, at the foot of the mountain of Diois, are mineral springs. That commonly called the inaccessible mountain, is a very steep rock, upon a high mountain two leagues from the town, but does not in the least resemble an inverted pyramid, as has been pretended.</P>
<P>St. Paul trois Chateaux, a small town on the borders of Provence, but the capital of the district called Tricastinois, from the antient Tricastini, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Arles, and has a revenue of ten thou∣sand livres per annum, out of which his taxation to Rome is four hundred florins.</P>

<PB N="130" REF="1310"/>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of ORANGE.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which is about four French leagues in length, and two in breadth, had for∣merly counts and princes of its own; but, in the year 1531, it came to the house of Nassau, in which it continued till the death of William-Henry, prince of Orange, stadtholder of Holland, and king of Great Britain. In the year 1713, Frederic-William, king of Prussia, and one of king Wil∣liam's heirs, ceded it to France; and, in 1722, Lewis XV. gave it to the prince of Conti. The revenue of it is said to amount to about fifty thou∣sand livres. In the year 1714, it was annexed to the government of Dauphiné. The only place in it worth mentioning, is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Orange, in Latin Arausio, situated on the little river Maine, in a beautiful plain about a league from the Rhone, and five from Avignon. It was much larger formerly than at present; but is still the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbi∣shop of Arles, and has a revenue of ten thousand livres per annum, out of which his taxation to Rome is four hundred and eight florins. Here are still several remains of Roman magnificence: par∣ticularly a fine triumphal arch, and an amphithea∣tre.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of PROVENCE.</HEAD>
<P>This county derives its name from the Latin Provincia, and is bounded to the south by the Me∣diterranean; to the north by Dauphiné; to the west by the Rhone, which separates it from Lan∣guedoc; and to the east by the Alps and the Var, which divides it from the dominions of the king of
<PB N="131" REF="1320"/>
Sardinia. It is divided into the Upper and Lower, its length being about forty-two French leagues, and its breadth about thirty. The air and soil dif∣fer widely in the two divisions; for in the former the air is temperate, but, in the latter, so hot that it would be intolerable, especially upon the sea∣coast, were it not qualified by certain winds. The former yields good corn, apples, and pears, and abounds in cattle, but has little wine. On the con∣trary, the latter has plenty of wine, with orange, le∣mon, pomegranate, fig, palm, cypress, olive, mastic, medlar, and sea cherry trees; but does not produce half the quantity of corn necessary for the inhabi∣tants: this province yields also a kind of box, the fruit of which proceeds from the middle of the leaf, and continues all the year round. Of their wines, the muscadel is the best. In the road and harbour of Toulon is caught a fish, inclosed in a stone, which must be broke before the fish can be come at, and called a date, from its resemblance to that fruit. The taste of it is very agreeable; but, in ge∣neral, the fish of the Mediterranean are inferior to those of the Ocean. There is also a small bird in this province, called becca-sigo, that feeds only upon grapes and figs, and is delicate eating. Iron, black agate, and even gold, copper, and lead, are said to be found here. There are no considerable rivers in the province: the chief are, the Du∣rance, the Sourge, the Largens, (so called from the transparency of its waters) the Lare, the Ver∣don, and the Var; the last of which divides France from Italy. The woods here are numerous, and afford a great deal of timber for shipping, and other uses. Provence has its parliament and states; but instead of the latter, general assemblies are now summoned every year, by the king's order, to make a repartition of the subsidies demanded of the pro∣vince. Almost the whole trade from France to
<PB N="132" REF="1330"/>
Italy, and the Levant, and the greater part of that to Spain, is carried on from this province. The balance of trade to Italy is said to be two hundred thousand livres in favour of that country; but of that to Spair, the balance is greatly in favour of France. The exportations and importations, to and from the Levant, are very great; that trade, it is said, employing above a hundred vessels, of one sort or another. Provence had long counts of its own; but, in the year 1481, it fell to Lewis XI. since which time it hath continued annexed to the crown of France. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Aix, the capital, in Latin Aquae Sextiae, so call∣ed from its baths, and the Roman commander, Sextus Calvinus, who built a castle here, in the year of the city 630. In Ptolomy's time it was a Ro∣man colony, and is now one of the finest cities of France, situated six leagues from Marseilles, and the see of an archbishop, who has a revenue of thirty-two thousand livres, out of which he pays a tax to the pope of two thousand four hundred florins. The valley, in which the town stands, is chiefly planted with olives, which yield an excellent oil. Here is a stately cathedral, an university, two col∣leges, an academy of the fine arts, a public library, a great many convents and courts of judicature, se∣veral fine fountains, a most beautiful and spacious walk called Le Cour de Orbitelle, a stately palace, where the parliament meets, a mint, and a town-house. There is very good company in this city, especially in the winter, when most of the nobility of the province take up their abode in it. The warm waters are not so much esteemed now as for∣merly.</P>
<P>Salon, a little town, six leagues from Aix to the west, and between one and two from Marseilles, belonging to the archbishop of Arles. Here the famous pretended prophet Nostradamus
<PB N="133" REF="1340"/>
died, in the year 1566; but he was born at St. Remy.</P>
<P>Arles, a large and well built city, situated on the Rhone, over which it has a bridge of timber, thir∣teen leagues from Aix to the west, and seven from the Mediterranean. It was antiently a Roman co∣lony, and there still remain many marks of its for∣mer grandeur; particularly an obelysk of oriental granate, and the ruins of an amphitheatre. It was formerly also the capital of the kingdom of Bur∣gundy, and is now the see of an archbishop, who stiles himself prince of Montdragon, and has a re∣venue of thirty-three thousand livres per annum, out of which his taxation at the court of Rome is two thousand and eight florins. Here are a great many convents and churches, a court of admiralty, and a royal academy of sciences and languages. In the Elysian Fields, where the Romans used to bury their dead, are a vast number of sarcophagi; some standing half, and others entirely, out of the ground; some with, and others without inscrip∣tions. Near the city, the island Comarque divides the Rhone into two great branches; but the mouths of the river are so choaked up with sand, that they are not practicable for any but small barks. The city being situated in a marshy soil, the air is not reckoned very wholesome.</P>
<P>Les Baux, a town in the bailiwic of Arles, whose lords were antiently very powerful. It now belongs to the prince of Monaco.</P>
<P>Tarascon, a large antient town on the Rhone, having a handsome castle, several convents, and a college.</P>
<P>St. Remy, a considerable town, situated near a lake called Glaciere, and belonging to the prince of Monaco.</P>
<P>Marseilles, in Latin Massilia, a very antient, large, rich, and populous city, situated on the
<PB N="134" REF="1350"/>
coast of the Mediterranean sea, where it has a safe and spacious harbour, about seven leagues from Aix to the south, and fourteen from Arles to the south-east. All the trade which is carried on from the south of France, in a manner centers here. This city is said to have been founded by a colony from Ionia, five hundred years before Christ. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbi∣shop of Arles, and has a revenue of thirty thousand livres per annum, his taxation to Rome being se∣ven hundred florins. Here the gallies of France are laid up. Here also is a fine arsenal, a dock for building the gallies, a mint, an observatory, an academy of the fine arts, several churches, and two abbies. The harbour runs up far into the city, and is well secured and fortified. The city is di∣vided into the Old and New; the former of which is but meanly built, but the latter is very handsome, and contains a fine walk. Opposite to the harbour are three small islands. Great quantities of tar and pitch are made in this neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Brignoles, a pretty large town, about thirty miles to the east of Marseilles, giving name to a bailiwic, in which, near the convent of La Sainte Beame, in a rocky mountain, is a cave, where Mary Magda∣len, after her arrival at Marseilles, with Lazarus and Joseph of Arimathea, is said to have spent the rest of her life in tears and mortification. Near the same convent are quarries of black agate.</P>

<P>Toulon, in Latin Tolo Martius, a pretty large city, situated on the Mediterranean, with a fine port, ten leagues east from Marseilles, and about an hun∣dred and twenty-five from Paris. Both the town and harbour are strongly fortified. On two sides of the former are high hills at a very small distance, of which that of St. Anne, on the north-east, perfectly commands it. The entrance of the port is so nar∣row,
<PB N="135" REF="1360"/>
that two ships cannot go into it a-breast. Here is an admiralty, and other courts; a great many convents; an arsenal, well furnished; a large rope-house, with three arched walks; a cannon foundery; a general magazine, containing an im∣mense quantity of stores; and a manufactory of coarse woollen cloth. Toulon is also the see of a bishop, who is subject to the archbishop of Arles, and has a revenue of fifteen thousand livres per an∣num, out of which his taxation to Rome is four hundred florins.</P>

It stands in a fruitful soil, contains several convents and churches, and is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Ambrun, and has a revenue of twenty-two thousand livres per annum, out of which his taxation to Rome is four hundred and twenty-four florins.</P>
<P>Antibes, in Latin Antipolis, situated on the bor∣ders of the county of Nice, two leagues from Grasse to the east, and above three from Nice to the west. Here is a pretty good harbour and castle, with some Roman antiquities. The fish, called sardines, are said to be very well cured here.</P>

<P>Digne, a small but antient city, on the river Bleone, at the distance of six leagues from Sisteron. Here are some hot wells, which are impregnated with sulphur and alcaline salt, and good for the cure of several distempers. The bishop, who is also baron of Lauzieries, is suffragan to the archbishop of Ambrun, and has a revenue of ten thousand livres per annum, out of which he is taxed at the court of Rome in four hundred florins.</P>
<P>Sisteron, a city on the Durance, fifteen leagues north of Aix. It is small, but has a citadel and se∣veral convents, with a pretty good trade. It is al∣so the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Aix, and has a revenue of fifteen thousand livres per annum, out of which he pays the pope a taxation of eight hundred florins.</P>

Nice, which the duke of Savoy ceded to France at the peace of Utrecht.</P>
<P>The city and district of Avignon, and the county of Venaissin, being almost surrounded by Provence, though they belong to the pope, we shall give a short account of them here.</P>
<P>Avignon, with its district, antiently belonged to the counts of Tholouse and Provence; afterwards, they fell to the dukes of Burgundy; then they were possessed by the kings of Sicily, who were also counts of Provence, until the year 1348, that Johanna queen of Sicily, and countess of Provence, disposed of the town and its district to pope Cle∣ment VI. for eighty thousand florins. The district is very fruitful, and abounds in corn, wine, and saffron. As for the county of Venaissin, it was held either by the counts of Tholouse, its own counts, or the emperors, until the year 1273; since which it hath been possessed by the popes, and governed, under them, by officers called rec∣tores. It is also very fruitful. The only place worth mentioning in the district of Avignon, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Avignon, a large and beautiful city, and the see of an archbishop, situated at the conflux of the Rhone and Sorgue, seven miles from Arles to the north, and fifteen from Aix to the north-west. Here is a papal palace, in which the vice-legate or governor resides; a stone bridge over the Rhone; a fine Jesuits college; and an university, founded in the year 1303. No less than seven popes re∣sided here successively, from the year 1307 to 1377. In the church of the Franciscans is the tomb of the beautiful and learned Laura, so much admired and celebrated by the immortal Petrarch. The grave having been opened in the time of Francis I. a leaden box was found in it, containing
<PB N="140" REF="1410"/>
a medal, with a copy of verses, written on parch∣ment, by Petrarch, in praise of his mistress. The Jews enjoy the free exercise of their religion in this city, which is surrounded by a wall of free-stone. In greater causes an appeal lies to the vice-legate, and from him to Rome. The canons of the ca∣thedral, dedicated to the virgin Mary, wear scarlet robes.</P>
<P>In the county of Venaissin the places of any note are,</P>
<P>Lisle, in Latin Insula, the best and handsomest town in the county, standing on an island in the river Sorgue.</P>
<P>Carpentras, a walled town, situated on the river Rousse, about four leagues from Avignon to the north-east. It is commonly called the capital of the county, being the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Avignon, and of the supreme courts of justice, before which are brought appeals from the inferior courts.</P>
<P>Vaisson, a small town, with a castle, near the ri∣ver Ouvesse, eight leagues from Avignon. It is the see of a bishop, who is lord of the town, but has a small revenue.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of LANGUEDOC.</HEAD>
<P>Languedoc is bounded to the south by the Me∣diterranean, and the counties of Roussillon and Foix; to the north by Guienne, Lyonnois, and Au∣vergne; to the east by the Rhone, which parts it from Dauphiné, Provence, and Avignon. It is of a very irregular figure, but its greatest length is about seventy French leagues, and its breadth from ten to thirty-two. After the Romans, the Visi-Goths
<PB N="141" REF="1420"/>
possessed themselves of this province, and held it, until they were expelled by the Saracens; who were, in their turn, obliged to quit it by the Franks, under Charles Martel, and his son Pepin: after that it was governed, as most of the other pro∣vinces, by dukes, viscounts, and other lords, sub∣ordinate to the crown of France; until, at last, it was united to that crown, anno 1316. The pro∣vinces lying south of the Loire, formerly using the syllable oc, instead of oui, gave occasion to those provinces being distinguished by the name of the country of the Langued'oc; and those to the north of the Loire, by that of the country of Langue∣d'oui: but, at last, the distinction being confined to this province, it got from thence the name of Languedoc. Though some parts of the pro∣vince are mountainous, particularly the Cevennes, yet, in general, it is very fruitful in grain, wine, fruits, oil, saffron, and woad. There is also plenty of honey, wax, silk, salt, good pasture for oxen and cows, with some rich mines of metals and minerals, quarries of marble and alabaster, springs of mineral waters, and both sea and river fish. The Cevennes yield millet, chesnuts, and some other fruits. The air is remarkably pleasant and healthful, especially in the higher parts of the country. The principal rivers are the Rhone, the Garonne, the Aude, the Tarne, the Allier, and the Loire. The royal ca∣nal of Languedoc, which was begun and completed betwixt the years 1660 and 1686, in order to open a communication betwixt the Ocean and the Me∣diterranean, without going about by the streights of Gibraltar, begins at Cette, on the Mediterranean, and, a quarter of a mile below Tholouse, joins the Garonne, which falls into the bay of Biscay. It is upwards of an hundred miles in length, six feet deep every where, and the breadth generally above twenty fathom. In some places it is carried
<PB N="142" REF="1430"/>
under mountains, and in others over vallies; having all along sluices, dams, reservoirs, water-courses, and draw-bridges. It is said to have cost thirteen millions of livres; part of which was furnished by the king, and part by the states of Languedoc. The whole management and produce of it were granted, by the king, to Riquet, who contrived and executed it, and his male-heirs. Ships passing on it pay twenty sous for every hundred-weight. The counts of Caraman, descended from Riquet, are obliged to keep it in repair, and to have passage∣boats, to go and come at stated times, with or without passengers. Several remarkable winds are observed in this province. That called the cers, from the Latin circius or cercius, blows generally from the west along the southern coast, and is very refreshing in summer: another called autan, and in Latin altanus, blows generally from the opposite quarter, and is hot and unwholesome: a third, called bise or the black, and by Strabo melambo∣reas, or the black north-wind, blows frequently in the valley, through which the Rhone runs, very strong and cold. When the wind in this valley blows from the south, unattended with rain, it is no less unwholesome than the autun. From the coasts of Leucate to the Rhone, in the heat of sum∣mer, a sea breeze sets in, from ten in the forenoon to five in the afternoon, which cools the air, that would be otherwise almost insupportable. In a valley at the foot of the Pyrenees, there is a sharp west or north-west wind, called the le vent de pas, which blows only in the night, and generally, in the summer, through the openings of the mountains: hence the people of the valley are obliged to win∣now their corn in the night. A very remarkable custom prevails in this province, namely, that of treading out their corn by horses or mules, accord∣ing to the Eastern custom, frequently alluded to in
<PB N="143" REF="1440"/>
the scriptures. The states of the province consist of three orders, the clergy, nobility, and the com∣mons, who meet every year in October; and no tax can be imposed without the king's letters-pa∣tent, and the previous deliberation of the states thereupon. Besides the general assemblies of the states of Languedoc, there are particular assemblies of the states of Vivarez, Velay, and Gevaudan. The coasts of Languedoc are said to be not only dangerous, but destitute of safe and good harbours. The exports consist chiefly of wine, oil, dried ches∣nuts, raisins, woollen cloth, stuffs, silk, and corn in a good year. For the government of the pro∣vince and the administration of justice, besides the states, here is a parliament, a chamber of accounts and taxes, a governor-general, and three lieutenant-generals, subordinate to whom are nine other go∣vernors of particular places. The common divi∣sion of the province is into Upper and Lower. In the Upper the places of note are,</P>
<P>Tholouse, the capital of the whole province, situated on the Garonne, over which it has a stately bridge, about an hundred and ten leagues from Pa∣ris, sixteen from the Pyrenees, and twenty-eight from the Mediterranean. It is one of the largest and most antient cities in France; yet, having lit∣tle trade, it is neither populous nor rich, though the seat of a parliament, and of several courts and of∣fices, among which is an admiralty and a mint, and also of an archbishop, who has a revenue of sixty thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to Rome in five thousand florins. Here also is an universi∣ty, founded in 1228; an academy of sciences and liberal arts; another, consisting of forty-two mem∣bers, who employ their talents chiefly in poetry; several monuments of antiquity, and a great many fine churches, besides the cathedral. In that of the Jacobins is the shrine of Thomas Aquinas. The
<PB N="144" REF="1450"/>
society of the Blue Penitents here, is the most re∣nowned in the whole world, having in its register kings, princes of the blood, and many eminent ec∣clesiastics. The academy of the Belles Lettres di∣stributes every year, on the third of May, four prizes, viz. an amaranthus of gold, and an eglan∣tine, a violet, and a marigold of silver. Some silk and woollen stuffs, and carpets, are made in this city, which gives name to a district called Toulou∣sain, wherein is Castle-Sarazin, a small town on the Garonne.</P>
<P>Alby, a town near the river Tarne, ten leagues from Thoulouse to the north-east, in the Albigeois, to which it gives name, and from which the Albi∣genses, an upright people, who, so early as the eleventh century, opposed the errors and corrup∣tions of popery, derived theirs. These Albigen∣ses are the same as the Waldenses, or Vaudois, taking the latter name, as some say, from the Vallies, in which they took refuge, among the mountains of this province; but, according to others, from Waldo, or Valdo, a rich merchant of Lyons, whose followers, being persecuted at home on account of their tenets, came and settled here. Alby is the see of an archbishop, who has a revenue of ninety-five thousand livres per annum, out of which his tax to Rome is two thousand florins. Here are several courts, a very rich and magnifi∣cent cathedral, a noble archiepiscopal palace, and a delicious walk called La Lice, a little above the city.</P>
<P>Gaillac, a considerable town situated on the ri∣ver Tarn, four leagues from Alby. It carries on a great trade, especially in wine, which is sent down the Tarn to Bourdeaux.</P>

It is the see of a bishop, who is subject to the arch∣bishop of Alby, and has a revenue of thirty thou∣sand livres a year, out of which his tax at Rome is two thousand five hundred florins. Before the re∣vocation of the edict of Nantes, there was a court here, the judges of which were partly papists and partly protestants, erected on purpose to determine the causes of the protestants in the province. There were also tribunals in the other provinces of the same kind. Turquoises are found in the neighbourhood of this town.</P>

The city is very antient, having been in the time of the Ro∣mans, the capital of Gallia Narbonensis, and a colony, the usual residence of the pro consuls, and a place of great trade, honoured with particular privileges, and embellished with noble structures. It is now the see of an archbishop, whose revenue amounts to ninety thousand livres per annum, and his taxation to the pope to nine thousand florins. In his garden is a beautiful Roman sepulchre of white marble, in the form of an altar.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of FOIX.</HEAD>
<P>This government, which contains the district and county of Foix, with the territories of Don∣nesan and Andorre, is bounded to the east and north by Languedoc; to the west by Gascogne; and to the south by the Pyrenean mountains and Roussillon. Its principal rivers are the Auriege and Rize. The duke of Vendome, father to Henry IV. of France, having married the heiress of the county of Foix, upon his son's accession, it was united to the crown. It is divided into Upper and Lower, the former of which is moun∣tainous, and abounds in wood, iron, mineral wa∣ters, and caverns; but the latter is more fruitful, especially in corn and wine. The principal places in Upper Foix are,</P>
<P>Foix, which gives name to the whole county and government, of which it is also the capital, though but a small city, situated on the banks of the river Auriege, at the foot of the Pyrenean mountains, twelve leagues from Tholouse to the south. Here is a castle and an abbey, the abbot of which takes place next to the bishop of Pamiers, in the assembly of the states, which meet here every year, and consist of the clergy, the nobi∣lity, and the commons.</P>
<P>Tarascon, a little town on the river Auriege, three leagues from Foix, where are a great many iron∣forges.</P>

<P>The district of Andorre contains only villages, the principal of which is Ourdines.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of ROUSSILLON.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Roussillon is bounded on the east by the Mediterranean sea; on the west by Cer∣dagne; on the north by the Lesser Pyrenees, which separated it from Languedoc; and on the south by the Greater, which part it from Catolonia, ex∣tending in length about twenty leagues, and in breadth about twelve. Its name is derived from its antient capital Ruscino, which was a Roman colony. The heat here in summer is very intense, and the inhabitants, in consequence thereof, very meagre and swarthy: the soil is very fruitful in corn, wine, oil, and hay; but produces little wood, which they are obliged to import on the backs of mules, having no navigable rivers: they plow the ground also with mules, and sow a great deal of millet. Orange-trees abound here, and sheep, whose flesh is excellent, as is also that of their pi∣geons, quails, and partridges; but the milk of their cows is not good, and therefore they keep but few, either of them or oxen. A great deal of oil,
<PB N="154" REF="1550"/>
with some corn, millet, and wool are exported from the county. It is watered by the Tet, the Tec, and the Agly, which are, properly speaking, only tor∣rents, produced by the melting of the snow on the mountains. It belonged formerly to Spain, but was yielded for ever to France by the treaty of the Pyrenees in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>9. The inhabitants pay a poll-tax, which yields about forty thousand livres. Besides Roussillon, this government includes a part of Cerdagne. The principal places in Roussillon are,</P>
<P>Perpignan, the capital, situated on the river Tet, about a league from the Mediterranean, and ten from Narbonne, to the south, which, though not large, is very populous, well built, strongly fortified, and defended by a castle. It is also the see of a bishop, suffragan to Narbonne, who has a revenue of eighteen thousand livres, and pays the pope a taxation of fifteen hundred florins. There is an university here, founded in 1349, several convents, alms-houses, hospitals, and churches, a noble cannon-foundery, a salt-office, a mint, and a high court of justice, to which appeals lie from all the inferior courts. The remains of the old town of Roussillon lie on the river Tet, not far from Perpignan.</P>
<P>St. Nazaire, Vernet, and Bains, three villages in the district of Perpignan; at the first of which salt is made of the sea-water, and the two last are noted for their warm baths.</P>
<P>Elne, in Latin, Helena, an old town near the river Tet, two leagues from Perpignan, and one from the Mediterranean. The lordship of the town belongs to the bishop and chapter of Per∣pignan, for it was formerly the bishop's see, which was removed, in 1604, to Perpignan, yet the bi∣shop still stiles himself bishop of Elne. The an∣tient name of the town was Illiberis.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="1560"/>
Bellegarde, a strong fortress, built for the de∣fence of the Col de Pertuis, a narrow pass, lead∣ing from Roussillon to Catalonia.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of NAVARRE and BEARN.</HEAD>
<P>This government is bounded to the east by Bigorre, to the west by Labourd, to the south by the Pyrenean mountains, and to the north by Gas∣cogne. Navarre, included in this government, and called Lower Navarre, is but a small part of the antient kingdom of Navarre, which having been seized by Ferdinand king of Arragon and Ca∣stile, this part alone was restored to Catherine the true heiress, from whom it descended at last to the house of Bourbon, and was annexed in 1620 to the crown of France. It is about eight leagues in length, and five in breadth. The principality of Bearn came to the crown of France at the same time, and in the same manner, as Navarre. Both of these countries have their states, and both lie within the jurisdiction of the parliament of Pau. Navarre is a barren mountainous country, and the only places in it worth mentioning are, St. Jean Pié de port and St. Palais. The former is the ca∣pital of the country, and stands on the river Nive, a league from the borders of Spain, and eight from Bayonne. It is pretty well fortified, and has a
<PB N="156" REF="1570"/>
castle, commanding a pass among the mountains. St. Palais is situated on the river Bidouse, ten leagues south-east from Bayonne, and is a small in∣considerable place.</P>
<P>The principality of Bearn lies at the foot of the Pyrenean mountains, being about sixteen leagues in length, and twelve in breadth. In general it is but a barren country, yet the plains yield conside∣rable quantities of flax, and a kind of Indian corn, called Mailloc. These mountains are rich in mines of iron, copper, and lead; some of them also are covered with vines, and others with pine trees, and they give rise to several mineral springs, and two considerable rivers, the one called the Gave of Oleron, and the other the Gave of Bearn. Some wine is exported from this country, and the Spaniards buy up great numbers of horses and cat∣tle, together with most of their linen, of which there is a considerable manufactory. The places of most note in the principality are,</P>
<P>Pau, in Latin Palum, a small but well-built town on the Gave of Bearn, above twenty leagues from Bayonne to the east, and about ten from the frontier of Spain. Here is a high court of parlia∣ment, several convents, two hospitals, a manufac∣ture of cloth, an academy of arts and sciences, and a palace, in which Henry IV. was born.</P>
<P>Lescar, a small city, a league below Pau to the east. The bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of Auch, and has a revenue of fifteen thousand livres.</P>
<P>Ortez, a small city on the Gave of Bearn, seven leagues from Pau, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Novarreins, a fortified town on the Gave of Oleron, four leagues from that city.</P>
<P>Sallies, a little town in the bailiwic of Sauve∣terre, noted for a fine salt-spring.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="1580"/>
Oleron, a small but populous city on the Gave that is named from it, four leagues from Pau to the west. The bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of Auch, and has a revenue of thirteen thousand livres, out of which his taxation at Rome is six hundred florins.</P>
<P>At the end of the bridge over the Gave is a little town, called St. Mary, in which is the cathedral and bishop's palace. In the bailiwic of Oleron, at the village of Ogeu, and in the valley of Arpe, are several cold mineral springs. At Aigues-caudes, in the valley of Ossau, is a hot spring, of a soapy, spirituous, oily nature.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of GUYENNE and GASCONY.</HEAD>
<P>This government, which is the largest of any in France, being about one hundred and ninety-five miles in its greatest length from east to west, and one hundred and sixty-eight in breadth from north to south, is bounded on the south by the Pyrenean mountains, which separate it from Spain; on the north by Saintonge, Angoumois, and Limousin; on the east by Auvergne and Languedoc; and on the west by the ocean. The name of Guyenne is a corruption of that of Aquitain; but under the lat∣ter name a much greater extent of country was antiently comprehended than is now under the former. It is said to have had the name of Aqui∣tain from the mineral waters in it. Henry II. of England succeeded to the duchy of Aquitain in right of his wife Eleanor, and his successors con∣tinued almost in the uninterrupted possession of it till the time of Henry VI. in whose reign the Eng∣lish lost not only this, but most of the other terri∣tories they held in France. Both Guyenne and Gascony are fruitful in corn, wine, fruits, hemp,
<PB N="158" REF="1590"/>
tobacco, brandy, prunes, and many other com∣modities. They have also medicinal springs, with copper, coal, and other mines, and quarries of marble of all colours. Their chief rivers are the Garonne, in which the tide flows up thirty leagues, and the Adour, both which discharge themselves into the ocean. They are partly under the juris∣diction of the parliament of Tholouse, and partly under that of Bourdeaux, and contain two gene∣ralities, and thirteen bailiwics. Guyenne, properly so called, is bounded on the north by Saintonge; on the east by Perigord and Agenois; on the south by Bazadois and Gascony; and on the west by the ocean; and contains the following places of note, viz.</P>
<P>Bourdeaux, the capital of the whole govern∣ment. The neighbouring district, called Bourde∣lois, is very fruitful, particularly in vines, chesnuts, and fig-trees. The city stands on the banks of the Garonne, about twenty leagues from its mouth, and is one of the most antient and fairest in France. It carries on a great trade with most parts of Europe, the tide rising so high in the river, that ships of great burden can come up to the key. The city and harbour are defended by three forts. The finest parts of the former are the place royale near the harbour, and the suburb of Chartron. The archbishop has a revenue of fifty-five thousand livres per annum, out of which his taxation to Rome is four thousand florins. Here is an univer∣sity founded in 1441; an academy of sciences and fine arts erected in 1712; a large Gothic cathedral, dedicated to St. Andrew; several other churches and convents; three seminaries; several public fountains, an exchange, and mint; a parliament, an admiralty, several other courts and offices, some remains of antiquity, and a manufacture of lace. About six leagues below the city is a watch-tower,
<PB N="159" REF="1600"/>

Its chief pro∣ducts and commodities are corn, cattle, mules, horses, and woollen stuffs. There are but two na∣vigable rivers in it, viz. the Vienne, and the Sevre-Niortoise, the latter of which is so called from the town of Niort, by which it passes, to distinguish it from the Sevre-Nantoise, which falls into the Loire at Nantes. Another river here, called the Clain, which falls into the Vienne, might also be made navigable, and at no great expence. This province lies within the jurisdiction of the parliament of Pa∣ris,
<PB N="171" REF="1720"/>
and is divided into the Upper and Lower Poi∣tou, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Poitiers, in Latin Augustoritum, the capital of the whole province, situated on the river Clain, be∣ing large, but meanly built, and thinly inhabited.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of BRITANNY.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Britanny is a peninsula, sur∣rounded on all sides by the sea, except towards the east, where it borders on Normandy, Maine, An∣jou, and Poitou. It is a very large province, ex∣tending about sixty leagues where longest, and about forty-five, where broadest. It had its pre∣sent name from the Britons, who fled hither from the Saxons in the fifth century, and, after wander∣ing about for some time, at last settled here. Be∣fore that, it had the name of Armorica, i. e. ad Mare Sita, from its lying along the sea-coast. After the declension of the Roman empire, it had kings, or counts and dukes of its own, until Ann of Bre∣tagne, the only daughter of Francis II. the last duke, married Charles VIII. and afterwards Lewis XII. and thereby annexed it to the dominions of France. The only navigable rivers are the Loire, and the Vilaine. In Upper-Britanny are pretty high mountains. No great quantity of grain or wine is produced in the province, but good pasturage, flax, and hemp, with some lead, pit∣coal, wood, and salt. On the sea coast are many good harbours, plenty of excellent fish, fishermen, and seamen. The horses bred here are much valued, and the butter is excellent. Towards the sea-coasts, the air is not so pure and wholesome as in the in∣terior parts. The province has its own parlia∣ment, governor, and states; the last of which, con∣sisting of the clergy, nobility, burghers, and pea∣sants, meet every two years, to raise the free gift de∣manded of them by the king. In Lower-Britanny they speak a different language from that of the rest of France: it has a great affinity with that of Wales, the inhabitants of both countries being de∣scended
<PB N="174" REF="1750"/>
from the antient Britons. The principal places in the province are,</P>
<P>Rennes, the capital, situated at the conflux of the Isle and the Vilaine, above fourteen leagues from the sea, from which, however, large boats come up to it; and eighteen from Nantz to the north. It is pretty large and populous, the seat of the par∣liament and other courts, and also of a bishop, who is suffragan to Tours, and has a revenue of four∣teen thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to Rome at a thousand florins.

This town carries on a great trade, though ships of burthen cannot come up to it, and is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Tours, whose revenue amounts to thirty thousand livres per annum, and his taxation to Rome to two thou∣sand florins. It is famous also for the edict issued here, in 1594, by Henry IV. in favour of the pro∣testants; and for an excellent sort of brandy, ex∣ported hence into foreign countries. There is a kind of partnership or league betwixt the merchants of this city, and those of Bilboa in Spain.</P>

The bishop is also lord of the city, with the title of count; but his diocese is the smallest in Bri∣tanny.</P>
<P>St. Malo, a small but populous city, standing on a little island, (which is joined to the con∣tinent by a mole or causey, at the head of which is a strong fort) on the northern coast of Britanny, three leagues from Dol to the north-west, twelve from Rennes, thirty from Nantes to the north, and about sixty west of Paris. Here is a court of ad∣miralty, several fine monasteries and churches, and a large harbour, but of difficult access. For the defence of the town and harbour, there are several forts, and other works, with a good garrison. The bishop is temporal lord of the city, and suffragan to the archbishop of Tours, with an income of thirty-five thousand livres, out of which his tax to Rome is a thousand florins. The trade of the town is very considerable; in particular, it sends a number of ships to the cod-fishery, and, in time of war, fits out many privateers.</P>
<P>Dinan, a considerable town near the river Rance, fourteen leagues from St. Malo to the south. Pretty large vessels can come up to the town, which is strong, both by nature and art.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of NORMANDY.</HEAD>
<P>Normandy is bounded on the south by Maine, Perche, and Beauce; on the north by the British channel; on the east by the isle of France and Pi∣cardy; and on the west by Brittany. Its extent from east to west is about sixty leagues, and from north to south about thirty. It is very fruitful in corn, flax, hemp, pasturage, and fruits of several sorts, particularly pears and apples, of which a great deal of cyder and perry is made. Here is also plenty of wood, coals, cattle, madder, and woad, together with fish, mineral waters, iron, copper, and other metals. Its principal rivers are the Seine, the Eure, the Andelle, the Rille, the Dive, the Lezon, the Carentone, the Aure, the Ante, the Orne, and the Drome. It takes its name from the Normans, who made a conquest of it in the beginning of the tenth century; William
<PB N="179" REF="1800"/>
the Bastard, duke of Normandy, defeating Ha∣rold in 1065, got possession of the throne of Eng∣land, which his successors held, together with Normandy, till 1203, when the latter was wrested from them by Philip-Augustus, and annexed to the crown of France: the English, however, re∣covered it afterwards, and held it thirty years, till they were driven out by Charles VII. Here is a parliament, with a chief, and several subordinate governors; and the revenue arising from it, is said, to amount to near a million sterling. It is divided into Upper and Lower, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Rouen, the capital of the province, and the Rothomagus of the antients, standing on the north bank of the Seine, in a valley, almost surrounded with hills, twenty two leagues from Paris to the north-west.

In one of the towers of the cathedral is a bell weighing thirty-six thousand pounds. The bridge of boats over the Seine, is a great curiosity, being paved like a street, and rising and falling with the tide. Besides other tombs of great personages in the cathedral, is that of John, duke of Bedford, who was regent of France under our king Henry VI. The trade of this city is very considerable, the tide of flood rising so high, that vessels of above two hun∣dred tons can come up to it, though it is twelve leagues from the mouth of the river. In the Place aux Veaux, is a statue of the maid of Or∣leans, kneeling before Charles VII. William I. surnamed the Conqueror, died here. In one of the suburbs are several mineral springs.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of HAVRE DE GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>This government constitutes a part of Upper Normandy, and is under the jurisdiction of the parliament of that province. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Havre de Grace, which gives name to it, and is a strong sea-port town at the mouth of the Seine, twelve leagues from Rouen to the west. Its name in Latin, is Portus Gratiae, which, as well as the French, signifies the harbour of Grace. The town is well built and fortified, and has a good trade and harbour.

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of MAINE and PERCHE.</HEAD>
<P>This government comprehends the province of Maine, together with the country of Laval, and the greatest part of that of Perche. The first of these derives its name from the Cenomani, and is bounded to the east by Perche; on the west by Anjou and Brittany; on the south by Touraine and Vendomois; and on the north by Normandy. Its
<PB N="185" REF="1860"/>
greatest length from east to west is about thirty leagues, and its breadth from south to north twenty. This country, as a part of Normandy, followed the fate of that duchy. It was formerly an earl∣dom, but has been united to the crown, ever since the year 1584; and by Lewis XIV. was erected into a duchy-peerdom, in favour of one of his na∣tural sons, whom he legitimated and stiled duke of Maine. It is pretty fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pasture; and has also some iron-works and mineral waters, with quarries of marble, free-stone, and slate. Its principal rivers are the Maienne, the Huine, the Sarte, and the Loire. It is subject to the parliament of Paris, and the places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Mans, in Latin Cenomonum, the capital of the whole province, situated on the river Sarte, ten leagues from Alencon, to the north. It is a very antient city, and the see of a bishop, who is suffra∣gan to Tours, and has a revenue of thirty-five thousand livres, out of which his tax to Rome is two thousand two hundred and sixteen florins. There are a great many churches here, several con∣vents and inferior courts of judicature, with a col∣lege and salt-office. The number of the inhabi∣tants is said to be about fourteen thousand.</P>
<P>Maienne, in Latin Meduana, a town on a ri∣ver of the same name, twelve leagues from Mans to the west. It is a duchy and peerage, belong∣ing to the duke of Mazarine, and has several churches in it, with a granary of salt.</P>

<P>Sablé, a small town and marquisate on the Sarte.</P>
<P>Laval, in Latin Vallis Guidonis, a town on the river Maienne, twelve leagues from Mans to the west. It is the capital of a county-peerdom, be∣longing to the house of Tremouille.</P>
<P>The country of Perche is bounded on the east by Timerais and Chartrain; on the west and north by Normandy; and on the south by the river Maienne, being about fifteen leagues in length, and twelve in breadth. The usual drink of the inhabitants is cyder, the province yielding great quantities of ap∣ples, but little wine. Cows and sheep graze on the mountains, and the plains abound in corn of all sorts, flax and hay: there are also some iron∣mines, and mineral waters in the country. That part of it which belongs to this government, and is by much the greater part, is subject to the par∣liament of Paris, and contains the following places worth mentioning:</P>
<P>Mortagne, in Latin Moritania, the capital of the country, standing in that called Great Perche, thirteen leagues from Chartres to the west. Here are several convents, churches, and courts of judi∣cature, with a salt-office, and a manufacture of coarse linen.</P>
<P>Bellesme, a little town, four leagues from Mor∣tagne to the south. Between it and Mortagne is a spring of mineral water, very salutary in many cases.</P>
<P>Nogent-le-Rotrou, a town on the river Huine, eleven leagues from Chartres to the north-west,
<PB N="187" REF="1880"/>
and as many from Mans to the south west. It had the epithet of le Rotrou from one of its counts. Here are several manufactures; particularly, of linen cloths, serges, and knives.</P>
<P>La Trappe, a Cistercian abbey, noted for the austerity of its monks.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of ORLEANOIS.</HEAD>
<P>This government includes the several districts of Orleanois-Proper, Beauce-Proper or Chartrain, Du∣nois, Vendomois, Blaisois, the greatest part of Ga∣tinois, and Perche-Gouet. The principal rivers in it are the Loire, the Loiret, the Cher, the Laconie, the Aigle, the Hyere, the Yonne, and the Evre. There are also some remarkable canals, particularly those of Briare and Orleans. The river Loire, and the canals drawn from thence, greatly facili∣tate and promote the inland trade of the kingdom, and particularly of this government, which lies en∣tirely within the jurisdiction of the parliament of Paris, and, besides the chief governor, has several subordinate ones.</P>
<P>Orleanois, in Latin Aurelianensis Ager, is bounded on the south by Sologne, on the north by Upper-Beauce, on the east by Gatinois, and on the west by Dunois and Vendomois. The Loire di∣vides it into Upper and Lower; the former ly∣ing to the north, and the latter to the south of that river. It yields plenty of grain, wine, wood, and fruit, and abounds in cattle, game, and fish. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Orleans, from which it derives its name, and is the capital not only of it, but of the whole govern∣ment. It was antiently called Genabum or Cena∣bum, and afterwards Aurelia, Aureliae, and Au∣relianum, and stands twenty leagues from Paris to the south, on the northern bank of the Loire,
<PB N="188" REF="1890"/>
over which there is here a fine stone bridge of sixteen arches, leading into a suburb on the south side of the river. In Julius Caesar's time it was the capital of the Carnutes: Aurelian, the emperor, enlarged it, and gave it his name. It is one of the largest cities in the kingdom, but meanly built, and most of the inhabitants are poor, tho' there are here several in∣ferior courts of justice, with an university, at pre∣sent in no great repute; a public library; a stately Gothic cathedral, and a great number of other churches, some of which are collegiate; a public walk, planted with several rows of trees; some su∣gar bakers; a manufacture of stockings and sheep-skins; a seminary, in which divinity is taught; and a great trade in brandy, wine, spices, and several manufactures, which, with many other commodities, are conveyed from hence to Paris, and other places, by means of the Loire, and the canal, which takes its name from the city. Some of the trading peo∣ple are very rich. The canal begins about two miles above the city, is near eighteen leagues in length, and terminates on the Loing, which falls into the Seine. To the north of the city is a forest, the largest in the whole kingdom, belonging to the duke of Orleans, to whom the timber felled in it brings in, one year with another, about an hundred thousand livres. Ever since the year 1344, this city has been a dukedom and peerage, and usually an appennage of some prince of the blood. Lewis XIV. gave it to his brother Philip, who begun and finished the canal, in whose family it still conti∣nues. The duties paid by vessels going up and down the canal, amounts, in some years, to an hundred and fifty thousand livres. The bishop of this city is suffragan to the archbishop of Paris, and has a revenue of twenty-four thousand livres, out of which his tax to Rome is two thousand flo∣rins. It is said, a new bishop, on the first day of
<PB N="189" REF="1900"/>
his entering the city, has the privilege to release all the prisoners in it, except those committed for treason. On the eighth of May, 1429, Orleans, then closely besieged by the English, was relieved by Jane of Arc, commonly called the maid of Or∣leans; and the anniversary of that deliverance is still kept here. To perpetuate the memory of it, a monument of brass was erected on the bridge, which is still in being.</P>
<P>Beaugency, a town and earldom, situated on the Loire, over which there is a stone bridge here, about four leagues below Orleans. The council who divorced Lewis XI. from Eleanor, heiress of Guienne, who was afterwards married to Henry II. of England, sat in this town, in which there is now a manufacture of serges, and other woollen stuffs.</P>
<P>The other small towns in this district, viz. Meun, Chateauneuf, Piviers, Clery, and Jurgeau, merit not a particular description.</P>
<P>In the district called Sologne the places of any note are,</P>
<P>Romorentin, the capital, eight leagues from Blois to the south. Here are some inferior courts of justice, and a manufacture of serges and woollen cloth.</P>
<P>Abigny, a little town on the Nerres, but a duke∣dom and peerage.</P>
<P>Sully, a small town on the Loire, which is also a dukedom and peerage.</P>
<P>In Chartrain or Beauce Proper, which is fourteen leagues long, and eleven broad, the only place of note is Chartres, in Latin Cornutum Civitas, and antiently Autricum, fourteen leagues from Paris to the south-west, and thirteen from Orleans to the north-west. It stands on the Eure, and contains several convents and churches, besides the cathe∣dral,
<PB N="190" REF="1910"/>
and is also the seat of several inferior courts of justice. The bishop is suffragan to the archbishop of Paris, and has a revenue of twenty thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to Rome in four thousand florins. The duke of Orleans is also duke of Chartres. The grove of the Druids, men∣tioned by Caesar, was on a hill near this town, the chief trade of which is in corn. They shew a well in the cathedral, into which a great many Christians are said to have been thrown by Querinus, the Ro∣man proconsul. Below the same cathedral is ano∣ther church, under-ground. The other small towns in this district are Gallardon, Nogent le Roi, Bon∣neval, and Maintenon; the last of which gave title of marchioness to Madame Frances d'Aubigné, widow of the famous poet Scarron, and the female favourite, if not the wife of Lewis XIV.</P>
<P>In the country of Dunois, which is an earldom, and fruitful in grain, the only place of note is Cha∣teaudun, the capital, situated near the Loire, nine leagues from Orleans. Here are several churches and convents, and an old castle. The other towns, which are small, are Patay, Puiseaux, Marchenoir, and Freteval.</P>
<P>In Vendomois, which is a dukedom and peerage, bounded on the north by Perche, on the south by Turenne, on the east by Dunois, and on the west by the Maine, the only place of note is Vendome, whence the duchy derives its name, situated on the Loire, twelve leagues from Orleans to the west. Here are several convents, an abbey, a college, an hospital, a granary of salt, and two inferior courts of judicature.</P>
<P>In Perche-Gouet, or Lesser-Perche, are the small towns or villages of Brou, La Basoche, Montmi∣rail,
<PB N="191" REF="1920"/>
Auton, and Halluye, which give name to as many baronies.</P>
<P>In Blaisois, which is a fine country, and an earl∣dom, divided into Upper and Lower, and bounded on the south by Berry, on the north by Beauce, on the east by Orleanois, properly so called, and on the west by Touraine, the only town of note is Blois, in Latin Blesae, the capital, whence the coun∣try derives its name. It stands on the Loire, over which it has a stone bridge, twelve leagues from Orleans to the south-west. Here are several churches and convents, a salt-office, a chamber of accounts, some inferior courts of justice, a celebrated castle, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the arch∣bishop of Paris, and has a revenue of twenty-four thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to the pope in two thousand five hundred and thirty-three florins. In the castle are shewn the cham∣bers where the duke of Guise, and his brother, the cardinal, were murdered, in 1588. The counts of Blois were antiently the most powerful lords in France. Four leagues from the town, to the north-east, is the royal palace of Chambord, on the little river Casson, in the middle of a spacious park, well stocked with deer. Its palace is reckoned the finest piece of Gothic architecture in France, and was built by Francis I. Here Stanislaus, the de∣throned king of Poland, resided some years, and here marshal Saxe, on whom the king had con∣ferred the palace, died, in 1750, as did his heir, the count de Friese, in 1755. There are several other palaces in this district, some belonging to the king, and some to noblemen; and also several small towns. The forest of Blois lies a little to the west of that town.</P>

The most barren and mountainous part of it is the dis∣trict of Morvant. It is watered by several rivers, of which three are navigable, viz. the Loire, the Allier, and the Yonne. The most considerable places in it are,</P>
<P>Nevers, antiently Noviodorum, and afterwards Nivernum, the capital of the province, situated thirty-eight leagues from Paris to the south, and taking its name from the rivulet Nievre, in Latin Niveris, which, with the Allier, falls, near the town, into the Loire. Here are several churches, con∣vents, and courts of justice, with manufactures of glass, white-iron, and earthen-ware, and a stately stone bridge over the Loire. The bishop of this town is lord of three castlewards, and suffragan to Sens, with a revenue of twenty thousand li∣vres, out of which he pays to Rome a taxa∣tion of one thousand two hundred and fifty flo∣rins. About two leagues from hence, at the vil∣lage of Pouges, in the road to Paris, is a noted mi∣neral spring.</P>
<P>Clamecy, a small town, at the conflux of the Yonne and Beuvron, six leagues from Auxerre, On the other side the Yonne is Pantenor, a bo∣rough, or suburb of Clamecy, where is the see of a bishop, stiled bishop of Bethlehem; because Ru∣nier, bishop of Bethlehem in Palestine, being obliged to quit that country in 1180, followed Guy, count of Nevers, into France, and had a small bishopric assigned him here. He is nomi∣nated by the duke de Nevers; and, as his income is very small, he receives pensions and gratifications from the other bishops, for whom he performs the episcopal functions, when sick or infirm.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of BOURBONNOIS.</HEAD>
<P>Bourbonnois is bounded on the north by Niver∣nois, and Berry; on the south by Auvergne, on the west by Upper-Marche; and on the east by Burgundy, and Forez; being in length about thirty leagues, and in breadth twenty. It is fruit∣ful in corn, pasturage, and wine; but it is said, that the wine must be drunk on the spot, for it will not bear to be exported. The snow on the mountains and forests of Auvergne makes the air often very cold. The chief rivers are the Loire, the Allier, and the Cher. From the antient dukes of this province is descended the present royal fa∣mily of France. In 1659, the duchy was given to the prince of Condé, to indemnify him for the loss of Albret, which had been given to the duke of
<PB N="195" REF="1960"/>
Bouillon. The authority and prerogatives of the prince here are little short of those of a sovereign: causes of importance, however, are determined by the parliament of Paris. The principal places in the province are,</P>
<P>Moulins, the capital, situated on the river Al∣lier, ten leagues from Nevers to the south, and forty-eight from Paris. It had the name of Mou∣lins from the many mills in its neighbourhood, moulin, in French, signifying a mill. It is a very pretty city, in which are several churches, convents, and courts of justice, with manufactures of hard∣ware, iron, and steel. Close by the town is also a mineral spring, and in the church belonging to the nuns of the Visitation, is the sumptuous tomb of the noble duke Henry II. of Montmorenci, who sell a sacrifice to the resentment of cardinal Riche∣lieu.</P>
<P>Bourbon le Archambaud, a little town near the river Allier, five leagues from Moulins to the west, noted for its mineral waters, both hot and cold, which are said to be good against the gout, and nervous disorders. In the rocks also, near the town, are found small stones, resembling dia∣monds and cut glass. It had the epithet of Ar∣chambaud from the name of some of its antient lords.</P>
<P>Mont-Luçon, a town near the river Cher, over which there is here a stone bridge. It is the second city of the province, and the seat of some inferior courts of justice, containing also several convents and churches, with a salt-office, and an hospital.</P>
<P>Neris, a market-town, noted for its warm baths.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of LIONNOIS.</HEAD>
<P>This government contains the three small pro∣vinces of Lionnois, Forez, and Beaujolois; and
<PB N="196" REF="1970"/>
is bounded to the north by Maconnois and Bur∣gundy; to the south by Vivarais and Velais; to the east the Soane and the Rhone part it from Bresse and Dauphiné; and to the west it terminates on Auvergne. It produces corn, wine, and fruit, particularly excellent chesnuts, with pit-coal, and mineral springs; and about four leagues from Lyons, is a mine of copper and vitriol. Appeals lie from hence to the parliament of Paris. The prin∣cipal rivers of the province are the Rhone, the Soane, and the Loire. Under the governor in chief, as in all the other provinces, are several sub∣governors.</P>
<P>Lionnois, properly so called, is twelve leagues long, and seven broad. Antiently it was subject either to counts, or to the archbishop and chapter of Lyons; but in the year 1563, the ju∣risdiction devolved to the crown. The only place in it worth describing is</P>
<P>Lyons, from which it takes its name, and which is one of the finest and most considerable cities in Europe. It stands at the conflux of the Rhone and Soane, and is said to have been founded by Lucius Munatius Plancus, forty-one, or forty-two years before Christ; and to have had the Latin name of Lugdunum, from a place of the Gauls that stood upon a hill hereabouts, and was called Lugdun, i. e. the hill of ravens. There are still some remains of the stately buildings with which the Romans adorned this city, which is now the second of France, having two fine squares, in one of which is an equestrian statue of brass of Lewis XIV. a beautiful town-house, a noble stone-bridge over the Rhone, with two of wood, and one of stone, over the Soane, a great number of convents and churches, besides the cathedral, four suburbs, six gates, an exchange, an observatory, a public li∣brary,
<PB N="197" REF="1980"/>
three hospitals, a mint, an arsenal well furnished with military stores, and three forts. It is noted for manufactories of gold and silver stuffs, gold and silver laces, and silks of all sorts. The number of looms, however, and the trade of this city, are far short of what they were formerly. The archbishop of Lyons has several other arch∣bishops and bishops immediately subordinate to him, with a revenue of forty-eight thousand livres, out of which his taxation to Rome is three thou∣sand florins. He stiles himself count of Lyons. The environs of this city are very pleasant, and it is very advantageously situated for trade for an in∣land town, but its streets are narrow. In the town∣house is an antient plate of brass, on which is en∣graved the oration which the emperor Claudius, when he was censor, delivered before the Roman senate, in behalf of the citizens of Lyons.</P>
<P>Forez is divided into Upper and Lower, and had formerly counts of its own; but in the year 1532, Francis I. annexed it to the crown. It is a large fruitful valley, watered by the Loire, and several other smaller rivers, and took its name from the town antiently called Forum Segusianorum, and now Feurs, or Fors, a small place, which stands on the Loire, and has a sulphureous spring near it. The other towns of this country are,</P>
<P>St. Etienne de Furans, a populous town on the river Furans, where is a very considerable trade, and a manufacture of fire-arms, and other works of iron and steel.</P>
<P>St. Galmier, a small place near the Loire, where is a spring of a vinous taste, and very wholesome, called Font-forte.</P>
<P>St. Rambert, a little town on the Loire.</P>
<P>Montbrison, the chief place of the district, having several churches, convents, and courts of justice,
<PB N="198" REF="1990"/>
with a college. Not far from it are the mineral springs of Moin.</P>
<P>Roanne, a very antient town on the Loire, where it begins to be navigable, and the capital of the district of Roannois, which is a duchy-peerdom, belonging to the duke de la Fuillade. From hence the merchants of Lyons convey their goods to several parts of the kingdom. Not far from it are several mineral springs.</P>
<P>Beaujolois is a fruitful tract, lying along the Soane, about ten leagues in length, and eight in breadth. It takes its name from Beaujeu, a large market-town on the Ardiere, but the capital is</P>
<P>Ville-Franche, situated on the little river Moran, near the Soane, five leagues from Lyons. Here is a granary of salt, and an academy of the fine arts. Among the privileges said to have been granted by the founder of this place, in order to draw inha∣bitants to it, one was somewhat extraordinary: he gave the husbands leave to beat their wives till the blood run, without being liable to be punished for it, provided they did not kill them.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of AUVERGNE.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Auvergne, which takes its name from the antient inhabitants the Arverni, termi∣nates to the south on Rouergue and the Cevennes; to the north on Bourbonnois; to the west on Limo∣sin, Quercy, and La Manche; and to the east on Forez. It is divided into Upper and Lower, and extends in length about forty leagues, and in breadth thirty. Lower Auvergne is a very fruit∣ful country; and the Upper, though cold and mountainous, yet yields good pasture, and, in con∣sequence thereof, breeds a prodigious number of cattle, and makes great quantities of cheese. The
<PB N="199" REF="2000"/>
iron and coal mines, and mineral waters, contri∣bute also greatly to the subsistence of the inhabi∣tants. It is said that the gusts of wind are so vio∣lent and variable among the mountains, that wind∣mills cannot be used. The principal rivers of the province are the Allier, the Dardogne, and the Alagnon; and its chief manufactures are silks, stuffs, cloths, laces, iron - works, and paper, in which, and corn, wine, cattle, cheese, and coals, it car∣ries on a great trade. It is entirely within the ju∣risdiction of the parliament of Paris, and a part of it still enjoys the title of an earldom, and belongs to the house of Bouillon.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In UPPER AUVERGNE the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>St. Flour, the capital, which is situated at the foot of Mount Cantal, one of the highest in Au∣vergne. It took its name from that of a bishop, who having comehither from Languedoc to preach the gospel towards the end of the fourth century, died, and was buried here; and it is now the see of a bishop, who is lord of the city, though sub∣ject in spirituals to the archbishop of Bourges, and has a revenue of twelve thousand livres per annum, out of which he is taxed to Rome nine hundred florins. Here is a considerable traffic in rye and mules, as well as in knives, carpets, and cloths.</P>
<P>Aurillac, which also claims the title of capital, and stands ten leagues from St. Flour to the west, on the river Jordane. Here are several convents and inferior courts of justice, with a castle, and manufactures of tapestry and lace. The titulary abbot of an abbey, that was formerly in this town, but is now converted into a collegiate church, is count and lord of the town, holding immediately of the pope, and enjoying all the rights and juris∣diction of a bishop.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="2010"/>
Murat, a town on the river Allangon, three or four leagues from St. Flour to the north-west. The inhabitants are mostly braziers and lace-makers.</P>
<P>Mauriac, a small city near the river Dordogne, about seven leagues from Aurillac to the north-west.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In LOWER AUVERGNE the chief places are,</HEAD>
<P>Clermont, the capital of the whole province, situated near the mountain called Pui de Domme, fourteen leagues from St. Flour to the north, be∣twixt the rivers Artier and Bedat. It was built by the emperor Augustus, and thence was antiently called Augustonemetum, or Augustonemosum. It was then called also Arverna, and Arvernum; but its modern name it had from the castle of Cler∣mont, that formerly stood near it. Here are seve∣ral churches, besides the cathedral, several courts of justice, abbies, and convents, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Bourges, and has an income of fifteen thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to Rome in four thousand five hundred and fifty florins. The counts of Auvergne antiently stiled themselves also counts of Clermont, that being the capital of their territories, and sometimes the place of their resi∣dence. In the neighbourhood of the town are se∣veral petrifying springs, one of which, in the su∣burb of St. Allire, has formed a solid rock, and a kind of bridge, under which the rivulet of Tiri∣taine passes; yet it is the only drinking water in the suburb, and no ill effects are felt from the use of it.</P>
<P>Montferrand, a little town, a quarter of a league from Clermont.</P>
<P>Riom, in Latin, Ricomagus, i. e. the rich city, situated two leagues from Clermont to the north,
<PB N="201" REF="2020"/>
where the antient dukes of Auvergne used to keep their court. At present here are several churches and inferior courts of justice, with a college; and the neighbouring country is so pleasant, that it is called the garden of Auvergne.</P>
<P>Montpensier, a small town, five leagues from Clermont to the north, giving name to a duchy-peerdom, which belongs to the duke of Orleans.</P>
<P>Aigue-Perse, in Latin, Aqua-Sparsa, a small town, but the capital of the duchy of Montpensier, three leagues from Riom, on the river Luzon. Near it is a spring, which boils violently, and makes a noise like water thrown upon lime, and yet is cold, and without any remarkable taste.</P>
<P>Thiers, or Thiern, a considerable town, six leagues from Clermont to the east. It has the greatest variety of manufactures, and the most trade of any town in Auvergne.</P>
<P>Brioude, in Latin, Brivas, a very antient town on the Allier. Here is a very extraordinary bridge, supposed to be a work of the Romans, being very long and lofty, but of only one arch, which rests on two high mountains. The town took its name from its bridge, Briva in the language of the Gauls signifying a bridge. To distinguish this from an∣other small town in the neighbourhood of the same name, it is called Vieille-Brioude, i. e. Old Brioude.</P>
<P>Near the small towns of Vic-le-Comté and Ar∣tonne, in Lower Auvergne, are mineral waters; as there are also at Mont d'Or, or the Golden mountain, which is the highest in Auvergne. At Vic-le-Comté is a chapel, and a fine palace built by the duke of Albany, who was of the royal fa∣mily of Scotland, and viceroy of that kingdom, during the minority of James V.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of LIMOSIN.</HEAD>
<P>Limosin, or Limousin, is bounded on the east by Auvergne, on the west by Perigord and An∣goumois, on the south by Quercy, and on the north by La Marche and Poitou. Its extent from south to north is about twenty-five leagues, and near as much from east to west. Both it, and its capital Limoges, had their names from the antient Limovices, one of the most valiant nations of Gaul. It is divided into Upper and Lower, the former of which is cold and mountainous, pro∣ducing little wine, and that too very indifferent; but the latter more warm and fruitful, and pro∣ducing very good wine. The country, in gene∣ral, abounds with chesnuts, which make a great part of the food of the common people: rye, bar∣ley, and buck-wheat also thrive very well in it. With regard to metals, here are mines of lead, tin, copper, iron, and steel; but excepting those of iron, the working of them does not turn to ac∣count. The native steel found here far excels the artificial. This country is noted also for its oxen, cows, and horses, of which great numbers are bought up by the neighbouring provinces. The chief rivers of Limosin are the Vienne, the Vezere, and the Dordogne. The jurisdiction of the parli∣ament of Bourdeaux extends over the whole pro∣vince; which, besides a chief governor, has a gene∣ral-lieutenant, and two sub-governors.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the UPPER LIMOSIN the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Limoges, in Latin, Limovicae, the capital of the whole province, seated on the Vienne, sixty-five leagues from Paris to the south. It is but very indifferently built, and contains three abbies and
<PB N="203" REF="2040"/>
convents, is the seat of several courts of justice, and also of a bishop, whose revenue amounts to twenty thousand livres, out of which his taxation to Rome is sixteen hundred florins. There is some trade here in leather, paper, and woollen cloths, together with some remains of antiquity, parti∣cularly of four aqueducts built by the Romans.</P>
<P>St. Leonard, a little town on the Vienne, five leagues from Limoges to the east. Here is a chapter, and a manufactory of paper and cloth.</P>
<P>St. Iriez, or St. Yrier de la Perche, a small town on the little river Isle, five leagues from Li∣moges to the south-west. Here also is a chapter, and, in the neighbourhood, are some considerable iron mines.</P>
<P>Chalus, a little town, having the title of an earldom, six leagues from Limoges to the north-west. Richard I. king of England, going to be∣siege this place, received a wound from an arrow shot by a cross-bow-man, of which he died, April 6, 1199.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In LOWER LIMOSIN the chief places are,</HEAD>
<P>Tulle, in Latin, Tutela, the capital, at the conflux the Coureze and Solan, fourteen leagues from Li∣moges to the south. It is the see of a bishop, who is temporal lord of the town, and suffragan to the archbishop of Bourges, with a revenue of twelve thousand livres, out of which his taxation to the pope is fourteen hundred florins. Here are several convents and inferior courts of justice, and the Jesuits, before they were suppressed in France, had a handsome college here.</P>
<P>Brive, surnamed la Gaillarde, situated on the river Coureze, seventeen leagues from Limoges to the south, and five from Tulle to the south-west. It had the name of Brive from its bridge, and the
<PB N="204" REF="2050"/>
epithet of la Gaillarde from its pleasant situation amidst hills, planted with vines and chesnut trees.</P>
<P>Turenne, the capital of the viscounty, to which it gives name, four leagues from Tulle. Both the town and the viscounty belong at present to the duke de Bouillon, who enjoys all the regalia in them.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of LAMARCHE.</HEAD>
<P>This country is bounded on the south by Limo∣sin, on the north by Berry, on the west by Poitou, and on the east by Auvergne; being about twenty-two leagues from east to west, and eight or ten from north to south, and lying within the juris∣diction of the parliament of Paris. It is watered by the Vienne, the Cher, the Creuse, and the Gartempe; and is not only fruitful in corn, but produces some wine. It is a dukedom and peerage, and, besides a chief governor, has a ge∣neral-lieutenant, and two sub-governors. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Gueret, the capital of the province, situated in the Upper Marche, on the river Gartempe, ten leagues from Limoges, to the south-west.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of BERRY.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Bery is bounded on the south by Bourbonnois and Marche, on the north by Or∣leanois, on the west by Touraine, and on the east by Nivernois; its greatest length being about thirty-five leagues, and its breadth about twenty-eight. Its name, and that of its capital Bourges, are derived from the antient Bituriges, surnamed Cubi, to distinguish them from the other Bituriges, called Vibisci, who were those of Bourdeaux. The air of this province is temperate, and the soil fruit∣ful, producing wheat, rye, wine, good fruit, a great deal of flax and hemp, and fine pasture, both for sheep and black cattle. Near Vierzon is a mine of oker, and near Bourges quarries of stone. Here are several rivers, the chief of which are the Loire, the Creuse, the Cher, the Large and Lesser Saudre, the Indre, the Orron, the Aurette, the Moulon, and the Evre. There is also a lake, called the lake of Villiers, which is pretty large. This pro∣vince, like most of the others, had formerly counts and viscounts of its own; but in the reign of Philip I. it was united to the crown. It lies within the ju∣risdiction of the parliament of Paris, and besides a governor, has a general-lieutenant, and two sub-governors. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Bourges, antiently Bituriges, and Bituricae, and also Avaricum, the capital of the whole province, situated at the conflux of the Eure, with the Avron, and other rivulets, eighteen miles from Orleans to the south. It is of a large extent, and has some particular privileges, but is thinly peopled, as having no manner of trade. Here, however, are several inferior courts of justice, particularly a marechaussee, whose office it is to provide for the security of the roads, and to seize and judge all
<PB N="206" REF="2070"/>
highwaymen, vagabonds, and idle strollers. There is such a court in most of the chief towns through∣out the kingdom. Here also is an university, one of the most antient in France, several convents, a great many churches, besides the cathedral, of which some are collegiate, a palace built by John of France, duke of Berry, in which the assemblies of the states, and the courts of justice are held, and the governor resides; a beautiful chapel, built by the same prince, and called the Holy Chapel; some handsome squares, a stately town-house, and the palace of the archbishop, who is stiled patriarch, and primate of Aquitaine, having five suffragans, with a revenue of thirty thousand livres, out of which he is taxed to Rome in four thousand and thirty-three florins.

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of TOURAINE.</HEAD>
<P>This province and its capital derive their names from the Turones. The former is bounded to the south by Berry and Poitou, to the north by the river Maine, to the west by Anjou, and to the east by Orleannois; its greatest breadth being about twenty-two leagues, and its length twenty-four. It is watered by several rivers, the chief of which are the Loire, the Cher, the Creuse, and the Vi∣enne. The climate is very mild, and the soil, in general, very fertile; but there are some barren spots in it. In the country of Noyers are mines of iron and copper. This province had formerly counts of its own; but in 1202, was united with the crown, and, in 1356, was raised to a duke∣dom and peerage. It lies within the jurisdiction of the parliament of Paris, and, besides a chief go∣vernor, has a general-lieutenant, and a sub-go∣vernor. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Tours, antiently Casarodunum, and Turones, the capital of the province, which also takes its name from it, situated on the Loire, about eleven leagues from Blois, to the north-west. Here is a fine bridge over the Loire, several inferior courts of justice, a great many churches and convents, a

mint, a salt-office, a mall, reckoned the finest in the kingdom, an academy of belles lettres, and the see of an archbishop, whose yearly income a∣mounts to forty thousand livres, and his taxation to Rome to nine thousand five hundred florins. The cathedral is a fine building, containing a li∣brary, in which are some antient manuscripts. This city is free, the people paying no taille, or tallage. In 737, Charles Martel defeated the Sara∣cens near this place with a very great slaughter. The manufactory of silks, and of gold and silver bro∣cades was so great here formerly, that the num∣ber of weavers amounted to about twenty thou∣sand. There is still a silk and cloth manufactory, but nothing in comparison of what it once was.</P>
<P>Amboise, a town situated at the conflux of the Amasse and Loire, over the last of which it has a fine stone bridge, about five leagues from Tours and Blois. Here Charles VIII. was born and died; and, in 1560, twelve hundred persons, most of them of rank and quality, and protestants, were hanged, drowned, or beheaded, being charged with conspiring to kill the king and the royal fa∣mily; though, in reality, their design was only to obtain liberty of conscience, and to remove the Guises. The name of Huguenot is said to have had its rise in this town, wherein also the civil war broke out in 1561. Besides a salt-office, an hospital, and two churches, here are several convents and inferior courts of justice.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of ANJOU.</HEAD>
<P>The province of Anjou, in Latin, Andegavia, extends in length twenty-six leagues, and in breadth twenty-four, being bounded to the south by Poitou, to the north by Maine, to the east by Touraine, and to the west by Bretagne. It is a pleasant fruit∣ful country, being watered by a great number of rivers, of which the Loire, Vienne, Maienne, Toue, Loir, and Sarti, are the chief, and producing, besides wine, a great variety of fruits, grain, and pulse, with fine pastures, mines of iron, coal, and salt-petre, quarries of slate, stone, and marble, and mineral waters. It lies wholly within the ju∣risdiction of the parliament of Paris, and, like the other provinces, has a governor-general, with se∣veral inferior governors. It was first annexed to the crown in the year 1202, and afterwards was raised to a duchy and peerage, and conferred upon some branches of the royal family. The title of duke of Anjou seems now to be appropriated to the third prince of the royal family. The princi∣pal places of the province are,</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="2120"/>
Angers, the capital, situated on the Maienne, hear where the Loire and Sarte fall into it, and now called in Latin Anadegavum, but antiently Julio∣magus. It is a large city, being the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Tours, and has a revenue of twenty-six thousand livres, out of which his taxation to Rome is seventeen hundred florins, and containing, besides the cathedral, a great many churches, of which some are collegiate, a strong castle, several abbies and convents, a salt-office, and a mint. Here also are several inferior courts of justice, a seminary, an academy of belles lettres, an university, and some remains of Roman antiquities. The first walls of the city were built by John, king of England, and duke of Anjou. The inhabitants are employed chiefly in bleaching wax and linen, refining sugar, and making camblets, serges, and fine woollen stuffs, striped with silk and gold. It is said of Angers, that it stands low, has high steeples, rich whores, and poor scholars.</P>
<P>Chateau-Gontier, a pretty large town on the river Maienne, five or six leagues from Angers. Here is a castle, several churches and convents, with manufactures of linen cloth and serges, and mineral springs.</P>
<P>Pont de Sé, in Latin, Pons Saii, so called from a long bridge over the Loire, on which it stands, about a league and a quarter from Angers to the east, having a castle, and, in the neighbourhood, quarries of black and white marble, and freestone. Some think the bridge here is the Pons Ligeris men∣tioned in Caesar's Commentaries.</P>
<P>Saumur, a town on the south bank of the river Loire, over which it has a stone-bridge, six leagues from Angers to the south. Here is a castle, seve∣ral convents, churches, and inferior courts of justice, together with an university, and some trade in saltpetre, sugar, steel, iron-works, medals, rings,
<PB N="212" REF="2130"/>
chaplets, and strings of beads. It was one of the cautionary towns given to the protestants. While it was in their hands, the celebrated John Cameron, a Scots divine, was, for some time, professor of divinity in the university. The governor of the town, and of its castle and district, called Saumu∣rois, is independent of the governor of the pro∣vince. The town was much more opulent while it was in the hands of the Huguenots.</P>
<P>Doe, or Doué, a pretty little town three leagues from Saumur to the west. The fairs kept here for the sale of cattle are the most noted in the whole province. There is also one of the finest fountains in France at this place, built in the form of an horse∣shoe.</P>
<P>Brissac, a little town on the Aubance, two or three leagues from Angers. Here is a fine castle, a park, and a pond near a league long. The town was erected into a duchy and peerdom in 1611.</P>
<P>There are a great many more small towns in the province, of which the most considerable are La Fleche, where was the most celebrated college of Jesuits in Christendom, before the order was sup∣pressed in France; Beaugé, Chateaux-Ceaus, Treves, Craon, Jarze, Cande, Montsoreau, Beaufort la Vallée, Ludé, Vehiers, Durtal, and Montreuil-Bellay, in the Saumurois.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of FRENCH FLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS government contains the greatest part of the French Netherlands, and is bounded to the north by the Seine and the German ocean, to the south by Artois, to the east by the Austrian Netherlands, and to the west by the German ocean. The French Netherlands consist of a part of the duchy of Luxemburg, of the province of Hai∣nault, of the earldom of Flanders, the bishopric of Liege, the Cambresis, and the county of Namur; and this government, the greatest part of which belongs to the parliament of Douay, comprehends French Flanders, the Cambresis, French Hainault, and the French part of the earldom of Namur.</P>
<P>French Flanders abounds in grain, vegetables, flax, and cattle, but is in want of wood, and the principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Lisle or Lille, in Latin Insula or Isla, the capital not only of French Flanders, but of all the French Netherlands, situated on the river Deule, twenty-three miles from Arras to the north, twelve from Tournay to the west, and sixteen from Ypres to the south. The French first got possession of it, in the reign of Philip the Fair; afterwards, it belonged to the dukes of Burgundy; then to the house of Austria, in whose possession it continued till 1667; when Lewis XIV. made himself master of it, and several other places in Flanders. This city is very strong and beautiful, and its citadel one of the finest in Europe. Here is also an hospital, in which the sick are served in silver plate, a very handsome ex∣change, a great number of churches and convents, several courts of judicature, and a mint, with a
<PB N="214" REF="2150"/>
considerable manufacture of camblets, cloths, and other stuffs, and a great trade, not only with France, but with Holland, Spain, and the West-Indies, which, however, would be much more pro∣fitable, if the town was not at such a distance from the sea. There is always a strong garrison in Lisle, which, besides its share of the other duties and taxes, pays yearly a considerable sum towards keep∣ing the fortifications in repair.</P>
<P>Douay, a pretty large and well fortified town, with a citadel, situated on the river Scarpe, and the borders of Artois, sixteen miles from Lisle to the south, among marshes. By means of sluices, the whole country round may be laid under water. Here are several churches; a famous seminary for English Roman catholics; an university, founded in 1559; and a parliament, which has most of the French Netherlands under its jurisdiction.</P>
<P>Gravelines, a small but strong town, on the river Aa, about nine miles from Dunkirk, and one from the sea. It is well fortified, and has a sort of har∣bour at the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>There are many other small towns in French Flanders, among which are Bourbourg, Berg, (surnamed St. Vinox) Cassel, St. Amand, Orchies, Armentiéres, Bouvines, Bailleul, and Marchiennes.</P>
<P>The Cambresis is about ten leagues long, and from five to six where broadest, has states of its own, and is very fruitful and populous. The prin∣cipal places are,</P>
<P>Cambray or Camerick, the capital, seated on the Scheld, thirteen miles from Douay to the south. It was taken by Lewis XIV. in 1677, and next year was yielded to him by the treaty of Nime∣guen, together with the whole Cambresis. It is the see of an archbishop, who is lord of the city, stiling himself also prince of the holy Roman em∣pire,
<PB N="215" REF="2160"/>
and count of Cambresis, and having a revh∣nue of an hundred thousand livres, out of whice his taxation to Rome is six thousand florins. The city is not only well fortified, but also defended by a citadel and fort. There is still a manufacture here of the fine lawn which takes its name from the city, and for which it has been long famous. The inhabitants are said to be very lively and indus∣trious, and to have a genius for the sciences.</P>
<P>Chateau-Cambresis, a small town, situated four∣teen miles from Cambray to the south-east, where the archbishop, who is temporal lord of it, has a noble palace. It was formerly a fortified town, but now lies quite open.</P>
<P>Crevecoeur, a market-town on the Schelde, six miles from Cambray to the north.</P>
<P>French-Hainault is about fifty miles in length, and twenty where broadest. It lies within the ju∣risdiction of the parliament of Douay, and is said to be very heavily taxed. The most considerable places in it are,</P>
<P>Valenciennes, a large and populous but ill-built town, on the Schelde, with a good citadel, and other fortifications, fifteen miles from Cambray to the north-east, and twenty-six from Lisle to the south-east. Part of it is in the diocese of Cambray, and part in that of Arras. The manufactures here are woollen stuffs, camblets, barracans, and a sort of fine lawns called batiste, in French. A court is appointed every year by the magistrates, for deter∣mining all matters relative to the manufactures. There are also certain officers here, and in other towns in the French Netherlands, called appaisers, or peace-makers; because their province is to make up all differences and quarrels among pri∣vate persons, which are not considerable enough to
<PB N="216" REF="2170"/>
be brought before the magistrates, or to deserve punishment.</P>
<P>Condé, a small town, situated at the conflux of the Schelde and Haine, six miles below Valencien∣nes to the north. It is strongly fortified, and gives the title of prince to a branch of the house of Bourbon, but belongs to that of Croy. The neighbouring country may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Bouchain, in Latin Buccinium, a strong little town, on the bank of the Schelde, ten miles above Valenciennes to the west. Between it and Valen∣ciennes stands the village of Denain, where, in 1712, the Dutch and Austrians were defeated by the French, under marshal de Villars, after the English had separated from the confederate army.</P>
<P>Quesnoy, in Latin Quercetum, a small but pretty strong town, eight miles from Valenciennes to the north-west. Here are manufactures of li∣nens and stuffs.</P>
<P>Bavay, the Baganum of Ptolemy, and the Baga∣cum of Antoninus, a small but antient town, twelve miles from Valenciennes to the south-east. There are still some remains of Roman causeys about this town.</P>
<P>Maubeuge, a small town on the river Sambre, about twenty miles from Valenciennes to the north-east. It is well fortified, and noted for a chapter of canonesses, who must all make proof of their no∣ble birth by thirty-two descents. This town con∣tains also several convents, and is the residence of the intendant of Hainault.</P>
<P>Landrecy, a small but strong town on the river Sambre, eighteen miles from Valenciennes to the south. It was yielded to Lewis XIV. by the treaty of the Pyrenees. On one side the country may be laid under water, and on the other there are im∣passable morasses.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="2180"/>
Marienbourg, a small town, so called, because it was built by Mary queen of Hungary, sister to the emperor Charles V. It was formerly fortified, but was dismantled by order of Lewis XIV. and is now a poor place.</P>
<P>Philippeville, a well fortified little town on the borders of Hainault. It had its name from Philip II. king of Spain.</P>
<P>Avesne, a fortified little town on the river Hes∣pres, nine miles from Maubeuge to the south. It is the seat of a royal bailiwic.</P>
<P>In the French part of the earldom of Namur, the only place worth mentioning is Charlemont, a little fortified town, which had its name from its situation on a steep rock, near the Maes, and its founder, Charles V.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of DUNKIRK.</HEAD>
<P>This government contains only Dunkirk, and some neighbouring villages.</P>
<P>Dunkirk, Dunkerch, or Dunkerque, stands at the mouth of the Colm, on the coast of the North∣sea, ten leagues from Gravelines to the east, twenty-one from Ostend to the west, thirty-six from Lisle to the north-west, and sixteen from St. Omers to the north. It took its name from a church, called in the Flemish and Dutch kerk, built formerly near some fishermens huts upon the sandhills, which in these languages are stiled duynen. Lewis XIV. caused it to be strongly fortified, and a harbour to be con∣structed capable of receiving men of war, which was also fortified. In pursuance of an article of the treaty of Utrecht, all these fortifications, together with the moles and Fort Lewis, were demolished, and the harbour filled up. However, both the fortifications and the harbour were afterwards repaired: but, by
<PB N="218" REF="2190"/>
the last treaty of peace concluded between France and England, and their respective allies, it was ex∣pressly stipulated, that all the fortifications should be again demolished, and the harbour filled up; but whether this article hath yet been executed, in its full extent, is what we will not venture to af∣firm. The town hath declined greatly in conse∣quence of these stipulations.</P>
<P>The only other place worth mentioning in this government is Mardyke, a village about three miles to the west of Dunkirk, celebrated on ac∣count of the noble canal erected there, with its sluice and basons, by order of Lewis XIV. after the peace of Utrecht; but, by virtue of an article of the treaty concluded at the Hague, in 1717, this canal hath been rendered, in a great measure, useless.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of METZ.</HEAD>
<P>This government consists of Meszin, French Barras, La Saare, and French Luxemburg. By the first of these is meant the territory round the city of Metz, in Lorrain, which was yielded for ever to the French, by the treaty of Westphalia, together with other districts in the bishopric of Metz, in which the only place worth mentioning is</P>
<P>Metz, in Latin Metae and Metis, situated at the conflux of the Moselle and Seille, twenty miles from Nancy to the north, and about an hundred and fifty from Paris to the east. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Treves, and has a revenue of an hundred and twenty thousand livres, out of which his taxation to Rome is six thousand florins. Here are also a great many churches, a parliament, an intendency, a mint, se∣veral abbies, inferior courts of justice, and offices, and also three citadels, and a Jewish synagogue.
<PB N="219" REF="2200"/>
The city is divided into the Old and New, both of which are large and handsome; but the latter ex∣ceeds the former, at least, in respect of beauty. The number of the inhabitants is above twenty thousand. The Jews are confined to a particular quarter, along the bank of the Moselle, in which they may not only hire, but purchase houses. To distinguish them from others, they are obliged to wear yellow caps.</P>
<P>French Barrois is a part of the duchy of Bar, which has been long in the possession of the French. It contains several small towns, of which Longwi and Jametz are the chief.</P>
<P>The French part of the duchy of Luxemburg was acquired by the peace of the Pyrenees. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Thionville or Diedenhofen, in Latin Theodonis Villa, a little fortified town, on the western bank of the Moselle, over which it has a beautiful bridge, sixteen miles from Luxemburg to the south. It is under the jurisdiction of the parliament of Metz, and its inhabitants are mostly Germans. The go∣vernor of the town also is subordinate to that of Metz.</P>
<P>Danvilliers, a little town, ceded to France by the treaty of the Pyrenees, and afterwards dismantled.</P>
<P>Montmedy, in Latin Monsmedius, a little forti∣fied town, on the river Chier, thirty-four miles from Thionville to the west. It is well built, and gives name to a provostship, as well as the two foregoing towns.</P>
<P>Carignan, a little town, situated on the Chier, six miles from Sedan to the west, and formerly called Ivoy. When Lewis XIV. conferred it on the count of Soissons, of the house of Savoy, its name was changed to Carignan, after that of a town in Pied∣mont, of which the count's father was lord.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="2210"/>
Bouillon, a well fortified town on the river Sa∣mois, which gives name to a duchy, and has a castle.</P>
<P>In the territory of Saar-Louis the only place worth mentioning is that which gives name to it, and was founded and fortified by Lewis XIV. It stands on the Saar, twenty-six miles from Thion∣ville to the east, and is one of the bulwarks of France towards Germany. The rampart is plant∣ed with three rows of trees, which form an agree∣able walk. The peninsula on which the town stands can be laid under water, in case of need.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of LORRAIN and BAR.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Lorrain, or Lothier, is a part of the antient kingdom of Lorrain, or Lothier; and took its name from Lotharius II. to whom it was allotted by his father Lotharius, in the partition of his dominions among his sons. The duchy is bounded to the south by Franche-Comté, to the north by the Netherlands, to the east by the Lower Palatinate, and to the west by Champagne; being above an hundred miles in length, and near as much in breadth. Though there are many woods and mountains in the country, yet the soil is gene∣rally fruitful, yielding plenty of grain, wine, hemp, and pasture: nor is it destitute of mines of iron, copper, tin, and silver; nor of salt springs, pre∣cious stones, and game; and its lakes and rivers abound with fish. Of the rivers, the most conside∣rable are, the Maes, the Moselle, the Meurte, the Saar, the Soane, and the Vezouse. The Romish is the religion of the country, and its language the French, except in some districts, in which the Ger∣man is spoken. In the year 1734 the French king, when he declared war against the emperor Charles
<PB N="221" REF="2220"/>
VI. in conjunction with the kings of Spain and Sardinia, seized both duchies, which, by the peace in 1735, were ceded to Stanislaus, king of Poland, and father-in-law to Lewis XV. during his life, and then were to be annexed for ever to the crown of France, as they now actually are. The duchy of Lorrain, properly so called, is divided into three districts or bailiwics, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Nancy, the capital of the whole duchy, situ∣ated on the river Meurte, twenty miles from Metz, to the south. It is divided into the Old and New Town, of which the latter is the largest and most beautiful; but the ducal palace is in the former, which is also fortified. Here are a great many convents, several churches, of which some are collegiate, an academy of sciences, a commandery of the knights of Malta, and a rich hospital, in which a vast number of poor are maintained. In the church of St. George is the monument of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgun∣dy, who was killed while he was besieging this city in the year 1476.</P>
<P>St. Nicholas, in Latin Fanum Sti Nicolai, a market-town on the river Meurte, six miles above Nancy to the south. It is indebted for its name to a supposed relict of St. Nicholas, who was bishop of Myra, in Lycia, in the beginning of the fourth century, which is kept here in a shrine.</P>
<P>Luneville, a small but very antient town on the river Vesouze, fourteen miles from Nancy towards the north-west. The two last dukes, and king Stanislaus, generally resided in a noble palace here. Besides an abbey, a commandery of Malta, and several convents, here is an academy for cadets, one half of whom are Lorrainers, and the other Poles. About three miles from Luneville, is an abbey of protestant Bernardines, but following the
<PB N="222" REF="2230"/>
Cistercian rule of St. Benedict, with a revenue of eighty thousand Lorrain livres.</P>
<P>Mirecourt, the capital of the bailiwic of Vauge, on the rivulet Maidon, twenty-five miles from Nancy to the south. It is a pretty considerable place for this country, and contains several con∣vents.</P>
<P>Remiremont, in Latin Romarici mons, a small town at the foot of Mount Vauge, on the bank of the Moselle, forty miles from Nancy to the south∣east. Here is an abbey of canonesses, who must be all of noble birth, but make no vows of chas∣tity, poverty, or obedience, except the abbess, who is stiled princess of the empire, and makes a vow of chastity.</P>
<P>Plombieres, a small place, but noted for its mi∣neral waters.</P>
<P>Epinal, a small town on the Moselle, thirty miles from Nancy to the south. It contains seve∣ral convents, an abbey, and two hospitals.</P>
<P>Dieuse, in Latin Decempagi, a little old town, but noted for fine salt-springs.</P>
<P>Rambervillers, a small town on the river Mon∣tagne, twenty-five miles from Nancy to the south.</P>
<P>Marsal, a little town eighteen miles from Nancy to the north-east, where are good salt springs. There are a great many other small places in Lor∣rain, properly so called, but they contain nothing remarkable.</P>
<P>The duchy of Bar is about eighty miles long, and sixteen broad, and is a very fruitful country, watered by several rivers, the chief of which is the Maes. It is bounded on the south by Champagne and Franche Comté; on the north by Luxem∣bourg; on the east by the duchy of Lorrain; and on the west by Champagne. It is now wholly in
<PB N="223" REF="2240"/>
the possession of the French, as well as Lorrain, and is divided into four bailiwics, in which the prin∣cipal places are,</P>
<P>Bar-le-Duc, the capital of the duchy, about eighteen miles from Toul, forty-one from Nancy, to the west, and five or six from the borders of Champagne. It is a pretty city, divided into the Upper and Lower, and contains a ducal palace, se∣veral convents and churches, and an hospital.</P>
<P>Ligni, the second town of the duchy, on the ri∣ver Ornei, containing two churches, and several convents.</P>
<P>St. Michel, a little town on the Maes, twenty miles from Bar-le-Duc to the south-west, It is the chief place of a bailiwic of the same name.</P>
<P>Pont à Mousson, a considerable town on the Moselle, over which it has a bridge, about fifteen miles from Metz and Nancy. The river parts it into two, of which, that on the east side, is in the diocese of Metz, and the other in that of Toul. The town gives name to a marquisate, and contains several churches and convents, with a seminary for the Scotch nation, and an university, founded in 1573.</P>
<P>Clermont en Argonne, so called to distinguish it from other cities of the same name. It is the chief place of an earldom and bailiwic, denomi∣nated from it, which Charles III. yielded to Lewis XIII. king of France, and Lewis XIV. gave, in full property, to the prince of Condé.</P>
<P>Betwixt the Maes and Moselle lie several lord∣ships, which take their names from their capitals, and are independent of both duchies; namely, those of Apremont, Commerci, Hatton-Chastel, Dieulonard, Gorze, and Malatour.</P>

<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of VERDUN, and the VERDUNOIS.</HEAD>
<P>In this government, which lies along the Maes, the only place of any note is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Verdun, which stands on the Maes, about thirty-four miles from Metz to the west. It is large and populous, has a fine citadel, and is well fortified. It is also the see of a bishop, suffragan to Triers, who takes the title of count of Verdun, and prince of the holy empire, and has a revenue of fifty thou∣sand livres, out of which he is taxed to Rome in four thousand four hundred and sixty-six florins. Here, besides the cathedral, are a great many churches and abbies. The bishop has a temporal jurisdiction in an hundred and six parishes, which compose what is properly called the bishopric.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of TOUL and TOULOIS.</HEAD>
<P>This government, which is quite hemmed in by Lorrain, is but small. The cities of Metz, Toul, and Verdun, with their bishoprics, were yielded for ever to the French, by the treaty of Westphalia, in 1648. The only town in this government is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Toul, which is seated on the Moselle, fourteen miles from Nancy to the west, and twenty-six from Metz to the north. Here is a fine bridge over the Moselle, several churches, besides the cathedral, a great many convents, three abbies, two priories, two hospitals, a seminary, and a commandery of Malta. The town is well fortified. The bishop is suffragan to Triers, and has an income of seven∣teen thousand livres, out of which his taxation to Rome is two thousand five hundred florins. He
<PB N="225" REF="2260"/>
stiles himself count of Toul, and prince of the holy empire; and, under the sovereignty of France, is temporal lord of the district to which the town gives name.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of ALSACE.</HEAD>
<P>Alsace is bounded to the north by the Palatinate, to the south by Switzerland and the Elsgau, to the east by the Ortenau and Brisgau, and to the west by Lorrain and Burgundy, extending, from north to south, upwards of sixty miles. Its inhabitants were antiently called Elsassen, i. e. the Saxons liv∣ing about the Ell, now called the Ill, and the coun∣try itself Elsas, which, at length, was corrupted in∣to Alsace. The soil, in general, is good, yielding grain, flax, fruits, wine, wood, tobacco, and pasture. Some parts yield also saffron and hemp; some only Turkish corn, rye, oats, or barley; and some are woody and uncultivated. The Wasgau mountains, in Latin Montes Vogesi, which separate this country from Lorrain, are very lofty, and con∣tain the sources of many rivers. A great variety of trees, shrubs, and plants, grow wild upon them; and there are several large forests, abounding in deer, and game of all kinds: they yield also mines of silver, copper, lead, steel, and iron; not to men∣tion antimony, cobalt, sulphur, coal, mineral wa∣ters, and baths hot and cold. The principal rivers that fall from the Wasgau mountains, and water Up∣per or Lower Alsace, are the Leber, the Cher, the Andlau, the Ergers, the Breusch, the Sorr, the Mot∣ter, the Seltzbach, the Lauter, the Queich, the Ber, and the Ill. The Rhine, in whose sands are found par∣ticles of gold, and which is generally highest in summer, from the melting of the snow on the Alps, divides it from Germany. There are also several lakes in it. The language of the inhabi∣tants
<PB N="226" REF="2270"/>
is the German, and the religion either Lu∣theranism or popery: their number is computed at about half a million. At the peace of Munster, the emperor yielded up to France the town of Bri∣sac, the landgravate of Upper and Lower Alsace, the Sundgau, and the district of the ten imperial cities in Alsace, with the sovereignty thereof; and, at the peace of Ryswick, in 1697, the emperor and empire ceded to France the perpetual sovereignty of Strasburg, and its dependencies, on the left side of the Rhine. The principal places in Lower Al∣sace are,</P>
<P>Strasburg, in Latin Argentoratum, the capital of the whole country, and formerly a free imperial city, situated on the rivers Ill and Breusch, about a quarter of a league from the Rhine. It took the Latin name of Argentoratum from the antient city of that name which stood near it; and that of Stras∣burg from its standing near a highway, called by the Latin writers of the middle age strata. It is a large and antient city, but has no fine buildings. The number of the inhabitants is computed at about forty thousand. The ramparts, being plant∣ed with trees, form a pleasant walk of near two hours. The bridge over the Rhine is near an English mile long; where a toll is levied upon all passengers, whether on foot or horseback, and upon all carriages. Though the city may be laid under water, it is well fortified, and has a regular citadel. The garrison commonly amounts to between eight and nine thousand men: from the pay of the offi∣cers a monthly deduction is made for the support of the theatre. The cathedral is the principal structure in Strasburg that merits observation, on the corners of which were once the figures of monkeys, asses, hogs, &amp;c. in monkish habits; but these images have been defaced. The ornaments present∣ed to this church by Lewis XIV. are said to have
<PB N="227" REF="2280"/>
cost six hundred thousand dollars: its steeple is just∣ly reckoned one of the highest in Europe, there be∣ing about six hundred and fifty-four steps from the pavement to the top: the great bell in it weighs above ten tons; and another, called the silver bell, as being mostly of that metal, two tons, six hun∣dred-weight, which is rung only twice a-year: in this church is likewise a large clock, which ex∣hibits the various motions of the planets. The other public buildings of any note are the episco∣pal palace, the arsenal, the playhouse, the royal and the city hospitals: in the latter may be seen some grain of a great age, and wine of the growth of 1472, 1519, and 1525. Though the taste of these wines is not much better than that of sour lees, yet a few drops can only be obtained for a guilder. The physic garden and the anatomical theatre, in this city, are well worth seeing. There are also several convents here; together with a Lu∣theran university and gymnasium; a royal society, founded in 1752, chiefly for the natural history of Alsace; and a great many churches, most of which are now in the hands of the papists; yet the great∣er part of the burghers are Lutherans, and of the members of the city council, one half are Lutherans, and the rest Roman catholics. By the capitulation in 1681, the citizens were to pay no taxes to the king, and to be maintained in the enjoyment of all their antient privileges: many encroachments, notwith∣standing, have been made upon them. At the head of the magistracy is a royal praetor, whose office it is to take care of the king's rights, and that nothing be done contrary to his majesty's plea∣sure. The soldiers of the garrison are lodged in caserns, built at the expence of the burghers. The bishopric is not worth, at present, above two hundred and fifty thousand livres. The canons of the cathedral must all be counts of the empire, or

peers of France, and prove their nobility by eight descents, both by the father's and mother's side.</P>
<P>Hagenau, a little town on the Motter, environ∣ed with a rampart and moat. It is the seat of a royal provostship and forest-court, and gives name to a district of a large extent.</P>
<P>Weissenburg, a little town on the Lauter, where is an abbey of Benedictines, and where Stanislaus, king of Poland, resided a considerable time.</P>
<P>Landau, a town on the river Queich, small and meanly built, but strongly fortified. The territo∣ries of the elector Palatine extend within half a league of this town, which was ceded to France by the treaty of Baden, in 1714.</P>
<P>Fort-Louis, a little but handsome town, with a strong fort, on an island in the Rhine, which is also fortified.</P>
<P>Zabern or Alsace-Zabern, in Latin Tabernae Alsatiae, a little town on the river Sor, belonging to the bishop of Strasburg, who is temporal lord or superior of a great part of Alsace, and, by virtue of two districts belonging to him, and lying on the other side the Rhine, is a prince of the empire, with a seat and vote in the diet.</P>
<P>Andlau, a small town on a river of the same name, where is an abbey belonging to secular ca∣nonesses of quality.</P>
<P>There are a great many other small towns in Lower-Alsace, but not worth describing.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In UPPER-ALSACE the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Colmar, in Latin Columbaria, the capital, seated near the river Ill. It was formerly one of the ten imperial cities in Alsace, and strongly fortified, and is now the seat of the sovereign council. Most of the inhabitants are Lutherans, who enjoy the pub∣lic exercise of their religion.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="2300"/>
New-Brisac, a small town, built by Lewis XIV. after the peace of Ryswick, about half a league from the Rhine, opposite to Old-Brisac. It is strongly fortified, and so regular, that from the great mar∣ket-place the four gates of the town may be seen.</P>
<P>The other places worth mentioning in Upper-Al∣sace are Ensisheim, a pretty town, about twelve miles from Brisac, on the Ill; Kaysersberg; and Munster, in the Gregorienthal.</P>
<P>The government of Alsace comprehends also the Sundgau, i. e. the Southern District, so called in opposition to the Nordgau, or Northern District. This territory is bounded to the south by the bi∣shopric of Basil, the earidom of Mumpelgarde, and Franche-Comté; to the north by Upper-Alsace; to the east by the Rhine, and the canton of Basil; and to the west by Lorrain. It is about twelve leagues in length, and near as much in breadth. Most of the inhabitants speak German, and are pa∣pists. This country, though mountainous, pro∣duces a great deal of corn and wine, and is watered by the river Ill or Ell. At the peace of Munster, in 1648, it was ceded by the emperor and empire to France; and the family of Mazarin now hold it, under the king. The only places in it worth men∣tioning are,</P>
<P>Pfirt, a small town, with a castle, ten miles west of Basil, and thirty south of Colmar, giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Hunningen, a fortress, built by the French, in 1679, within cannon-shot of Basil.</P>
<P>Thann or Dann, a town, not far from the river Thur, noted for a strong wine, and giving name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Befort, a small but well fortified town, with a castle and fort, twenty miles west of Pfirt and
<PB N="230" REF="2310"/>
Muhlhausen. In its neighbourhood are some ex∣cellent mines of iron.</P>
<P>Muhlhausen, a large town, twelve miles north of Pfirt, and near thirteen south of Calmar, on the river Ill. The inhabitants are Calvinists, and the town (as we observed before, in our account of Switzerland and its allies) is a member of the Hel∣vetic body.</P>
<P>Ilzach, a large market-town, belonging to Muhl∣hausen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The GOVERNMENT of FRANCHE COMTE.</HEAD>
<P>Franche Comté, or the county of Burgundy, is bounded to the south and west by the government of Champagne and Burgundy; to the north by Lorrain; and to the east by the earldom of Mum∣pelgard, and Switzerland; being in length from north to south about thirty leagues, and in breadth about twenty. It is partly flat, and partly hilly. The flat country is fruitful in grain, wine, hemp, and pasture; and the hilly abounds in cattle, pro∣ducing also some wine and corn, copper, lead, iron, and silver ore, mineral waters, quarries of stone, marble, alabaster, and salt-springs. The chief ri∣vers are the Saone, the Ougnon, the Doux, the Louve, and the Dain. Lewis XIV. seized this county in 1668; but was obliged to restore it next year: he seized it again, however, in 1674, and had it confirmed to him by the treaties of Nime∣guen and Ryswick. Besides a governor-general and his lieutenant, it has several inferior governors, and a parliament. In regard to spirituals, the greater part of it lies in the diocese of Besançon, and the rest in those of Langres, Lausanne, and Toul. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Besançon, in Latin Vesontio or Besontium, the capital, seated on the river Doux, which divides it
<PB N="231" REF="2320"/>
into the Upper and Lower town. Here are a great many convents, both of men and maidens, several hospitals, palaces, fountains, and inferior courts of justice, with a parliament, an archbishopric, and an university. The archbishop takes the title of a prince of the empire, has three suffragans, viz. the bishop of Lausanne, Basil, and Belley, and a revenue of thirty-six thousand livres, out of which his taxa∣tion at the court of Rome is one thousand and twenty-three florins. The university, which was removed from Dole to this city, in the year 1691, has professors of divinity, law, physic, and the languages. The city is well fortified, and also defended by two citadels.</P>
<P>Dole, a town on the river Doux, about eight leagues south-west from Besançon. There are se∣veral fine streets here; but it was more considerable before the taking of Besançon, when it was the ca∣pital of the country, and the seat of the parliament and university. Here is still a chamber of ac∣counts, a chapter, and a great many convents.</P>
<P>Salins, in Latin Salinae, a pretty large town, which takes its name from its salt springs, and stands six leagues south from Besançon, and as ma∣ny east from Dole. The salt-springs here are in vast caves under-ground; whence the water is raised by cranes, pumps, and other engines, conveyed in∣to reservoirs, and from thence into iron kettleś, where it is boiled into salt. The waters are sup∣posed to acquire their saltness by running through mines of salt, and not to come from the sea. A great deal of this salt is sent into Switzerland in casks; and the rest, by means of wooden moulds, is made into cakes and loaves of three or four pounds weight, and laid up in the warehouses, un∣til they are sold. Vast quantities of wood and coals are required for making the salt, and the
<PB N="232" REF="2330"/>
kettles. In the neighbourhood are several forts, and quarries of jasper, beautiful alabaster, and black marble; and in the town itself, sundry churches and chapters, and a great many convents. The only other places in the province worth men∣tioning are Gray and Vesoul. The former stands on the Soane, about nine leagues from Besançon, and has more trade than any other place in the province, a great deal of iron and wheat being sent from hence to Lyons. The latter is a small town near the river Durgeon.</P>

<HEAD>NAME, BOUNDARIES, and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE limits of the present kingdom of Por∣tugal and Algarve are not the same as those of the antient Lusitania, of which, however, it contains a part. With respect to the etymology of its present name, nothing can be offered but uncertain conjectures, the most proba∣ble of which we shall mention afterwards. It is bounded on the south and west by the Atlantic ocean, and on the north and east by Spain; being in length above three hundred miles, and where broadest about one hundred and twenty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the air, in the southern provinces it would be excessive hot, if it were not refreshed by the sea-breezes; but, in the northern, the air
<PB N="234" REF="2350"/>
is much cooler, and the weather more subject to rains. The spring is extremely delightful here, and the air, in general, more temperate than in Spain. Lisbon hath been much resorted to of late by va∣letudinarians, and consumptive persons, from Great Britain, on account of its air. The soil is very fruitful in wine, oil, lemons, oranges, pomegra∣nates, figs, raisins, almonds, chesnuts, and other fine fruits; but there is a want of corn, owing, it is said, in a great measure to the neglect of agriculture. There is plenty of excellent honey here, and also of sea and river-fish, and sea-salt. The horses in Por∣tugal are brisk lively animals, as they are in Spain, but of a slight make: but mules, being surer-footed, are more used for carriage and draught. By reason of the scarcity of pasture, there are not many herds of cattle or flocks of sheep, and what they have are small and lean, though the flesh is tolerably good: their best meat is said to be that of hogs and kids. The country in many parts is moun∣tainous; but the mountains contain all kinds of ores, particularly of silver, copper, tin, and iron, with a variety of gems, beautifully variegated mar∣ble, mill-stones, and many curious fossils of the lapidious kind. Not far from Lisbon is a mine of salt-petre; but none of the metal mines here are worked, the inhabitants being supplied with their contents from their foreign settlements. The principal rivers are the Minho, in Latin Minius; the Limia, antiently the famed Lethe; the Cavado; the Douro; the Guadiana, antiently Anas; and the Tajo, or Tagus, which is the largest river in the kingdom, carrying some gold in its sands, and falling into the sea a little below Lisbon. There are several mineral springs in the kingdom, both hot and cold, which are much frequented.</P>

<PB N="235" REF="2360"/>
<HEAD>RELIGION, LEARNING, and LANGUAGE.</HEAD>
<P>The only religion tolerated in Portugal is that of the church of Rome, yet there are many con∣cealed Jews, and those too even among the nobi∣lity, bishops, prebends, monks, and nuns; and the very inquisitors themselves. If a Jew pre∣tends to be a Christian and a Roman catholic, while he is really a Jew, by going to mass, confession, &amp;c. or if after being converted, or pretending to be converted and pardoned, he relapses into Judaism, and is discovered, the inquisition lays hold of him. In the first case, if they renounce Judaism, they are only condemned to some corpo∣ral punishment or public shame, and then ordered to be instructed in the Christian religion. In the second they are condemned to the flames without mercy. Besides Jews and heretics, who broach or maintain any doctrines contrary to the religion of the country, the inquisition punishes all sodo∣mites, pretenders to sorcery and the black art, apostates, blasphemers, perjured persons, impostors, and hypocrites. The burning of those condemned by the inquisition, is called an <HI>auto da fe,</HI> or act of faith. There are several tribunals of the inquisi∣tion, one of which is at Goa, in the East-Indies; but there are none in Brasil. The number of con∣vents in Portugal is said to be nine hundred. The order of the Jesuits hath been suppressed in this country, as well as in the kingdoms of France, Spain, and Naples, and the duchy of Parma. Here is a patriarch, several archbishops and bishops: the patriarch is always a cardinal, and of the royal family. The archbishops rank with marquisses, and the bishops with counts. The Portuguese have archbishops and bishops in the other quarters of the world, as well as in Europe. The sums raised
<PB N="236" REF="2370"/>
by the popes here, by virtue of their prerogatives, are thought to exceed the revenues of the crown, and the nuncios never fail of acquiring vast for∣tunes in a short time. Though there are two uni∣versities, and several academies, yet while the pa∣pal power, and that of the ecclesiastics continues at such a height, true learning is like to make but a small progress. The language of the Portuguese does not differ much from that of Spain: Latin is the ground-work of both, but the former is more remote from it, and harsher to the ear than the latter. The Portuguese tongue is spoken on all the coasts of Africa and Asia as far as China, but mixed with the languages of the several nations in those distant regions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MANUFACTURES and TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to manufactures, there are very few in Portugal, and those chiefly coarse silks, woollen cloths, and some linen; but their foreign trade is very considerable, especially with England, which takes a great deal of their wine, salt, foreign commodities, and fruits, in return for its woollen manufactures, with which the Portuguese furnish their colonies and subjects in Asia, Africa, and A∣merica. Their plantations in Brazil are very valu∣able, yielding gold, diamonds, indigo, copper, tobacco, sugar, ginger, cotton, hides, gums, drugs, dying woods, &amp;c. From their plantations in A∣frica, they bring gold and ivory, and slaves to manure their sugar and tobacco plantations in Brazil. They have still several settlements in the East-Indies, but far less considerable than formerly, together with the Azores or Western Isles, Ma∣deira, and the Cape de Verde islands; but a great part of the riches and merchandize brought from these distant countries becomes the property
<PB N="237" REF="2380"/>
of foreigners, for the goods they furnish the Portu∣guese with to carry thither. The king's fifth of the gold brought from Brazil amounts, commu∣nibus annis, to about three hundred thousand pounds sterling; so that the whole annual produce of gold in Brazil may be estimated at near two millions sterling. Lisbon is the greatest port in Europe next to London and Amsterdam. It was the Dutch who deprived the Portuguese of most of their settlements in Asia and Africa. Whether from some mistaken notion in politics, or some national prejudice, or whatever other cause, is uncertain, but the present prime minister has taken every occasion, during his administration, of discouraging, restraining, and distressing the British factories and commerce in this kingdom. This conduct seems the more unaccountable, as the very existence of the nation, as an independent state, has so long, and so often, depended upon the power∣ful protection of Great Britain; which has also, upon every occasion, always acted the part of a faithful ally and generous friend. If the advan∣tages arising from the commerce between the two nations were not mutual, this conduct might ad∣mit of some plea in its justification; but the con∣trary is evidently shewn, by the great preference which has been so long given by England to the Portuguese wines, for which they could find no other market, and the consequent immense con∣sumption of them in these kingdoms. Many, and not without reason, have been surprized at the su∣pineness of the British ministry, in putting up so long with the frequent oppositions, insults, and in∣dignities, which have been so repeatedly offered to the British merchants in this country, and no less at the temerity of the Portuguese minister, in venturing to rouse the indignation of a nation, which
<PB N="238" REF="2390"/>
could so easily, and so effectually, do itself ample justice.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>In Portugal accounts are kept in rees, a thousand whereof make a mill-ree; and crusadoes, of which the old are equal to four hundred, and the new to four hundred and eighty rees: but these are ima∣ginary coins. The silver coins are a vintain, equal to twenty rees; a real, equal to forty; an half∣teston, equal to fifty; and a whole, equal to an hundred. The gold coins are the moedas, or moi∣dores, as they are called in England; and the Johns, or three-pound-twelves, and their subdivisions. An hundred rees are only equal to eight-pence English. Notwithstanding such quantities of the coin of Portugal are carried to foreign countries, yet the exportation of it is prohibited under pain of death.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>As to the constitution of Portugal, it is an ab∣solute hereditary monarchy. Both here and in Spain, there were antiently cortes, states, or par∣liaments; but they have long since entirely lost their share in the legislature. For the administra∣tion of the civil government, there is a council of state, and several secretaries; for military affairs, a council of war; for the finances, a treasury-court; and, for the distribution of justice, several high tri∣bunals, with others subordinate to them, in the several districts into which the kingdom is divided. The cities have their particular magistracy. The proceedings of the courts are regulated by the Ro∣man law, the royal edicts, the canon law, and the pope's mandates. Like the Spaniards, they trans∣act
<PB N="239" REF="2400"/>
most of their business in the mornings and evenings, and sleep at noon. The nobility are very numerous, and many of them are descended from natural sons of the royal family. They are di∣vided into the high and low. The high consists of the dukes, marquisses, counts, viscounts, and ba∣rons, who are also grandees, but of different classes, being suffered to be covered in the king's presence, and having the title of dons, with a pension from the royal treasury, to enable them the better to support their dignity: the king stiles them illus∣trious in his letters, and treats them as princes. A duke's sons are also grandees, and his daughters rank as marchionesses. The inferior nobility or gentry are termed Hidalgos, i. e. gentlemen: they cannot assume the title of don, without the king's licence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenues of the crown, since the discovery of the Brazil mines are very considerable; but the real amount can only be guessed at. Some have said that it amounts, clear of all salaries and pen∣sions, to upwards of three millions sterling: others make it a great deal less. Thus much is certain, that the customs and other taxes run excessively high. Besides the royal demesnes, the hereditary estates of the house of Braganza, the monopoly of Brazil snuff, the coinage, the money arising from the sale of indulgences granted by the pope, the fifth of the gold brought from Brazil, the farm of the Brazil diamonds, the masterships of the orders of knighthood, and other sources, yield very large sums. The forces', notwithstanding, of this na∣tion, both by sea and land, are very inconsiderable; their land-forces being the worst militia in Eu∣rope, and their navy of little importance. They
<PB N="240" REF="2410"/>
would be an easy conquest to the Spaniards, if they were not under the protection of England.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORDERS of KNIGHTHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>There are several orders of knighthood here, viz. 1. The order of Christ, the badge of which is a red cross within a white one, and the number of the commanderies four hundred and fifty-four. 2. The order of St. James, the badge of which is a red sword, in the shape of a cross. A great number of towns and commanderies belong to this order. 3. The order of Aviz, whose badge is a green cross, in form of a lilly, and the number of its commanderies forty-nine. Though these three orders are religious, yet the knights are at liberty to marry. 4. The order of St. John, which has also several commanderies.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1110, Alphonso VI. king of Castile, bestowed Portugal upon his son-in law, Henry of Burgundy, for his great services against the Moors: his son, Alphonso-Henry, assumed the title of king; and his descendants sat on the throne of Portugal until 1580, when they failed: the next year the kingdom was united to Spain; but, in 1640, it shook off the Spanish yoke, and advanced John duke of Braganza to the throne, whose posterity are still in possession of it. The present king hav∣ing no male issue, a dispensation was obtained, some years ago, from the pope, by virtue of which the king's brother married the princess of Brazil, by whom he has issue.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="241" REF="2420"/>
<HEAD>KING'S TITLES.</HEAD>
<P>The king's titles are, king of Portugal and the Algarves, on this side and the other side the sea of Africa; lord of Guinea, and of the navigation, conquests, and commerce, in Ethiopia, Arabia, Persia, India, &amp;c. The king's eldest son is stiled prince of Brazil. In the year 1749, pope Benedict XIV. dignified the king with the title of his most faithful majesty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PERSONS, CHARACTER, and DRESS.</HEAD>
<P>The Portuguese are represented as inferior to the Spaniards, both in person and genius; as extremely haughty, treacherous, and crafty in their dealings; much given to avarice and usury; and vindictive, malicious, and cruel. The meaner sort are said to be extremely addicted to thieving: notwithstand∣ing, it must be owned, that they have shewn them∣selves, on many occasions, a brave and warlike peo∣ple. They are justly famed for their skill in naviga∣tion; and for the many discoveries they have made, both in the East and West Indies. No∣thing also is more certain, than that all countries have men good and bad, great and mean, with and without genius. The women here, and in other countries of the same degree of heat, are not so pro∣lific as in the colder climates; but they are said to be very beautiful, whilst young, though their com∣plexion is somewhat upon the olive. Their eyes are very black and sparkling, and retain their bril∣liancy after all their other charms are gone. It is the fashion here, at present, as in most other countries, for the ladies to spoil and disfigure their skins and complexions, with paints and washes: but, tho' live∣ly and witty, they are said to have a nice sense of fe∣male
<PB N="242" REF="2430"/>
honour. Both men and women make great use of spectacles; often not so much to aid their sight, as to denote their wisdom and gravity. Their dress, like that of the Spaniards, never used to vary till of late, especially among the men; but, of late years, both men and women have given much into the French modes. The women, when they go abroad on foot, are wont to use long veils, which cover their heads, but leave their faces bare.</P>
<P>Portugal contains six provinces, and several islands in the Atlantic Ocean, of which we shall give a short description.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ENTRE DOURO E MINHO.</HEAD>
<P>This province is so called from its situation be∣twixt these two famed rivers, and from thence also, in Latin, has the name of Interamnensis. The Minho separates it from Galicia on the north; the Douro from Beira on the south; on the west it is bounded by the Ocean; and on the east by a ridge of mountains, which part it from the province of Tras os Montes, or Over the Hills: its extent from north to south being about seventy miles, and from east to west fifty. It is the most populous pro∣vince of the kingdom, and one of the most fruit∣ful, though mountainous, yielding plenty of pasture, wine, and fruit, but not a sufficiency of corn for its inhabitants. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Braga, a very antient city, between the rivers Ca∣vaco and Deste, about an hundred and eighty miles north of Lisbon. It was antiently the capital of the Bracarii, who came hither from Celtic-Gaul, called also Gallia Bracata, from whom Galicia, and, as some think, Portugal also, had their names, as well as this city. The Romans planted a colo∣ny here, and named the town Augusta-Bracaria. It is the see of an archbishop, who is primate of Por∣tugal,
<PB N="243" REF="2440"/>
and spiritual and temporal lord of the city and neighbouring country. Here is a stately an∣tient cathedral and archiepiscopal palace, a great many convents, several parish churches, about twelve thousand inhabitants, a noble hospital, a large college, and a house of mercy, which is a cha∣ritable foundation for the relief of persons of good families fallen to decay, and for marrying of young maidens, and putting boys to employments. The archbishop's revenue is said to be forty thousand crusadoes, or six thousand pounds sterling. There are some remains of antiquity in it, particularly of an amphitheatre and aqueduct.</P>
<P>Porto or Oporto, on the river Douro, which, a little below, falls into the sea. Here is a com∣modious harbour, much frequented by the English; but the bar at the entrance into it is somewhat dan∣gerous. Next to Lisbon, it is the city of greatest opulence, beauty, and trade, in the kingdom. At the mouth of the river is a castle to guard it, called St. John's. Opposite the town, on the other side the river, is Gaya, a small place, which was antient∣ly called Cale; and Oporto, when first built, was called Portucale, or the harbour of Cale: hence also, as some think, the kingdom derived its name. Here are above twenty thousand inhabitants, seve∣ral hospitals and parish-churches, besides the ca∣thedral, a great many convents, a mint, several courts of justice, and the see of a bishop, who stiles himself Episcopus Portucalensis, and has a revenue of fifteen thousand crusadoes, or two thousand pounds. The city is fortified only with an old wall and towers. It had formerly its particular lords; but now belongs to the crown, and stands an hundred and twenty miles north of Lisbon.</P>
<P>Guimaranes, a small but antient town, belonging to the crown, ten miles east of Braga, and about an hundred and fifty north of Lisbon. It is en∣compassed with a good wall, contains about five
<PB N="244" REF="2450"/>
thousand inhabitants, several hospitals, convents, and courts of justice, with an old castle and royal palace, and has a manufacture of linen and fine thread.</P>
<P>Viana de Fez de Lima, so called because it stands near the mouth of the river Lima, twenty miles south of Braga, and about thirty north of Lisbon. It is large and well built, has a good har∣bour, a strong castle and walls, a considerable trade, several courts of justice and convents, and a noble magazine, in which are kept ammunition, warlike stores, and arms for above twenty thousand men. The number of the inhabitants is about seven thou∣sand. It is one of the pleasantest towns in Portu∣gal, and the property of the crown.</P>
<P>Ponte de Lima, a handsome town, about an hun∣dred and eighty miles north of Lisbon, on the river Lima, from which, and the bridge over it, it takes its name.</P>
<P>Villa nova de Cerveira, a small town on the river Minho. It bears the title of an earldom, is sur∣rounded with hills, and well fortified.</P>
<P>Villa Nova de Porto, a small town on the south side of the river Douro, opposite to Oporto. It contains about three thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>Barcellos, a small town on the river Cavado, in the territory of Viana. It is fortified with a wall and towers.</P>
<P>Villa de Conde, a small sea-port at the mouth of the river Ave, with a strong old castle.</P>
<P>Valença, a small but strong town on the river Minho, near the frontiers of Spain. It gives the title of marquis to the count of Vimioso.</P>
<P>Caminha, a little fortified town near the mouth of the Minho. It contains upwards of a thousand inhabitants, and belongs to the infants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="245" REF="2460"/>
<HEAD>TRAOS MONTES.</HEAD>
<P>This province is called in Latin Transmontana, because situated on the east side of a chain of hills, that separate it from Entre Minho e Douro. To the north it is bounded by Galicia; to the south by the province of Beira and Leon; by the last of which it is also bounded to the east. Its length from north to south is upwards of an hundred and twenty miles, and its breadth about eighty. It is full of mountains, and produces little corn, but plenty of wine, fruits of several sorts, and abun∣dance of game. It contains two cities, fifty-seven small towns, five hundred and forty parishes, and above an hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants. The Douro is its principal river, and its most con∣siderable towns are,</P>
<P>Braganza, a city near the river Fervença, at the extremity of the province, and near the borders of Leon and Galicia, about an hundred and twenty miles northward from Lisbon. It contains about three thousand inhabitants, several convents, and a good castle, has a variety of silk manufactures, and is well fortified. The ancestors of the present royal family were dukes of Braganza, before they were advanced to the throne, in the person of John the eighth duke, but the second duke, and fourth king of that name. This town is supposed to have been the antient Caelia Briga, Brigantia, or Bri∣gantium.</P>
<P>Chaves, a town on the river Tamega, about six miles from the borders of Galicia, and two hundred north-east from Lisbon. It was built by the empe∣ror Flavius Vespasian, anno 78, and called Aquae Flaviae. There is still a Roman bridge of stone over the Tamega, with other marks of its antient
<PB N="246" REF="2470"/>
grandeur. It now contains about two thousand souls, and is well fortified.</P>
<P>Villa-Real, or the Royal Town, so called because founded by king Dennis, anno 1289, stands be∣tween the rivers Corgo and Ribira, about an hun∣dred and fifty miles north of Lisbon. It is the best and largest town of the province, and belongs to the infants. That called the Old Town is sur∣rounded with a wall.</P>
<P>Miranda de Douro, a fortified town on the fron∣tiers of Spain, so called from its pleasant situation on the north side of the Douro, being well fortified, and the see of a bishop, who has a revenue of ten thousand crusadoes, or fourteen hundred pounds.

<HEAD>BEIRA.</HEAD>
<P>This province is the largest of the kingdom, and is bounded by the ocean on the west; by Spanish Extremadura and Leon, on the east; by Entre Douro e Minho and Traz os Montes, on the north; and on the south by Portuguese Extremadura, and the Tagus. It is about an hundred and forty miles both in length and breadth, and produces plenty of wine and oil, as it would also of grain, were it duly cultivated; but the people are lazy, and chuse rather to beg, than to supply their wants by la∣bour and industry, which, it must be owned, are also greatly discouraged by the oppression and haughtiness of their superiors. This province is
<PB N="247" REF="2480"/>
not so mountainous as some others, and is well wa∣tered by several rivers. However, there is one very high mountain in it, called antiently Mons Herminius, and now the mountain of Estrella, on which there are two lakes, which give rise to a river, and a quarry of fine alabaster. From a valley in this mountain, Lisbon is furnished with snow all the summer. The province of Beira contains four cities, two hundred and thirty-four small towns, one thousand and ninety-four parishes, and about five hundred and fifty thousand souls; and it gives title to the prince of Brazil's eldest son. The most considerable places are,</P>
<P>Coimbra, a city on the north side of the river Munda, now called Mondego, over which it hath a stately bridge, about ten miles from its mouth, and ninety north from Lisbon. It was antiently a famed Roman colony. Here are now a great ma∣ny convents, colleges, and churches, besides the cathedral, several courts of justice, one of the tribu∣nals of the inquisition, an university, and the see of a bishop, who is count of Arganil, and has a reve∣nue of forty thousand crusadoes, or six thousand pounds sterling. The number of the inhabitants is about twelve thousand. The monks of the convent of the Holy Cross here are all noblemen, and of the order of St. Augustine. The university is a very magnificent structure: the professors be∣longing to it are said to be about fifty, and the stu∣dents about two thousand. The cathedral is ad∣mired for its architecture, its ornaments, and riches. The kings of Portugal formerly resided in this city, which is noted for its exquisite peaches.</P>
<P>Lamego, a city near the Douro, about an hun∣dred and forty miles north-east from Lisbon. It is surrounded with mountains, gives the title of count, and contains about four thousand inhabi∣tants, and several convents. Here are also se∣veral courts of justice, and the see of a bishop, who
<PB N="248" REF="2490"/>
is suffragan to the patriarch of Lisbon, and has a revenue of eighteen thousand crusadoes, or two thousand five hundred pounds sterling.</P>
<P>Viseu, a city on a small river, which falls into the Mondego, about an hundred and twenty miles north-east of Lisbon. Here are several convents, churches, and courts of justice; and here the an∣tient town of Vacca is supposed to have stood, two old Roman towers still remaining here. The bi∣shop of this place is suffragan to the archbishop of Braga, and has a revenue of eighteen thousand crusadoes, or two thousand five hundred pounds sterling. The number of inhabitants is said to be about a thousand. The town was raised to a duchy by king John I.</P>
<P>Guarda, a city, strong both by nature and art, standing on a part of Mount Estrella, about an hundred and forty miles north-east of Lisbon, and not far from the source of the Mondego. It con∣tains about three thousand inhabitants, and is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Lisbon, and has a revenue of twenty thousand crusadoes, or near three thousand pounds sterling. The twon was built by Sancho, king of Portugal, who named it Guarda, as being, in effect of its strength, a guard or fence against the kingdom of Leon.</P>
<P>Castello Branco, a considerable town, with a castle, belonging to the order of Christ, and stand∣ing between the rivers Ponsul and Vereza, which runs into the Tagus. Here is a stately palace, in which the bishop of Guarda resides in winter, and near four thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>Pinhel, a strong town, containing about one thousand five hundred inhabitants, and lying about two hundred miles from Lisbon, to the north-north∣east.</P>
<P>Almeida, a regularly fortified town, near the ri∣ver Coa, and the borders of Leon, about an hun∣dred

<P>Figuera, a small port, about eight miles above Lisbon.</P>
<P>Aveiro, a middling town, with a good harbour, at the mouth of the river Vouga, about an hundred and ten miles from Lisbon. A great deal of salt is made here. The town contains about four thou∣sand four hundred inhabitants, and several churches, inferior courts of justice, and convents. It was erected into a duchy by John III.</P>
<P>The most considerable towns, besides these, are Mirando do Corvo, on the river Dueça; Monte∣mor o Velho, on the river Mondego, ninety miles north-west from Lisbon; Penella, in the district of Montemor; Feira, four miles from Oporto, and two from the sea; and Cavilhaa, a considerable town on the river Zezere, an hundred and ten miles north-east of Lisbon, and twenty south-west of Guarda.</P>

<HEAD>ESTREMADURA, or EXTREMADURA.</HEAD>
<P>Portuguese Estremadura is a long narrow slip, bounded to the west by the sea, to the north and east by Beira, and to the south by Alentejo. Its extent from north to south is about an hundred and twenty miles, and from east to west about sixty. It is said to take its name from its remote situation, beyond the Douro, in respect of Leon. The river Tagus, which falls into the sea at Lisbon, passes through it, and the most westerly point of it is the Cape La Roca, or, as our sailors term it, the Rock of Lisbon. The soil of the province is very fertile, producing corn, wine, oil, millet, pulse, and fruits
<PB N="250" REF="2510"/>
of all sorts, especially citrons, lemons, oranges, pomegranates, figs, dates, almonds, &amp;c. A great deal of salt is exported from it. The climate is also very pleasant and mild, the heat being quali∣fied by the breezes from the Western Ocean. The people are more industrious, have more trade, and a greater variety of manufactures, and consequently live better, than in the other provinces, which this surpasses also in respect of its soil, commodious sea∣ports, and the inland navigation of the Tagus: add to these, the possession of the metropolis and the court, which alone are sufficient to turn the scale in its favour, and to render it more flourishing than the more distant provinces. It contains three cities, an hundred and eleven small towns, three hundred and fifteen parishes, and about two hun∣dred thousand souls. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Lisbon, the capital both of the province and kingdom, standing near the mouth of the river Ta∣gus, on the north side. It was antiently called Oli∣sipo, Olisippo, and Ulyssipo, which are supposed to be derived from the Phenician Ulis-ubbo or Olisippo, signifying, in that tongue, a pleasant bay, such as that on which this city stands. It first became considerable in the reign of king Emanuel: from that time, it hath been the capital of the kingdom, the residence of its monarchs, the seat of the chief tribunals and offices, of the metropolitan, a noble university, and the receptacle of the richest merchandize of the East and West Indies. Its air is excellent; being refreshed by the delightful sea breezes, and those of the Tagus. The city ex∣tends for about two miles along the Tagus; but its breadth is inconsiderable. Like Old Rome, it stands on seven hills; but the streets, in general, are narrow and dirty, and some of them are very steep; neither are they lighted at night. The churches, in general, are very fine; but the magni∣ficence
<PB N="251" REF="2520"/>
of the chapel-royal is amazing. Here is one of the finest harbours in the world, and there were a great number not only of fine churches and convents here, but also of other public buildings, and particularly of royal palaces, and others be∣longing to the grandees; but the greatest part of them, and the city, were destroyed by a most dreadful earthquake, on November 1, 1755, from which it will require a long time to recover. The inhabitants, before the earthquake, did not, at most, exceed an hundred and fifty thousand. The government of it is lodged in a council, consisting of a president, six counsellors, and other inferior officers. The harbour has water enough for the largest ships, and room enough for ten thousand sail, without being crowded. For its security, there is a fort at the mouth of the river, on each side; and a bar that runs across it, and is very dan∣gerous to pass without pilots. Higher up, at a place where the river is considerably contracted, there is a fort called Torre de Belem, or the Tower of Be∣lem, under whose guns all ships must pass in their way to the city, and on the other side are several more forts. Before the earthquake, most of the private houses were old and unsightly, with lattice windows; and the number of convents and colleges amounted to fifty, namely, thirty-two for monks, and eighteen for nuns. The king's principal palace stands on the river, and is large and commodious. Of the hospitals, that called the Great is obliged to receive all persons, of what degree, nation, or reli∣gion soever, without exception. At the village of Belem, near Lisbon, is a noble hospital for decayed gentlemen who have served the king, and have not wherewithal to maintain themselves. That called the House of Mercy is also a noble charity. In the center of the city, upon one of the highest hills, is the castle, which commands the whole, being
<PB N="252" REF="2530"/>
large and antient, and having always a garrison of four regiments of foot. The cathedral is a vast edifice of the Gothic kind, but heavy and clumsy: it contains, however, great riches, and is finely adorned within. The square called Rosio is large, and surrounded with magnificent buildings. The whole city is under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the patriarch, who was appointed in the year 1717. Here is also an archbishop, who has, or at least had before the erection of the patriarchate, a revenue of forty thousand crusadoes, or six thousand pounds. The university, which was removed for some time to Coimbra, but afterwards restored to its antient seat, makes a considerable figure, though much in∣ferior to that of Coimbra. At Belem, a handsome village in the neighbourhood, is a royal palace, and a magnificent monastery of the order of St. Je∣rom. The country between Lisbon and Abran∣tes is a delicious plain, thick-set with olive, and other fruit trees.</P>
<P>Leiria, a city at the conflux of the Lis and Lena, about sixty miles north from Lisbon. It is the see of a bishop, who has a revenue of eighteen thousand crusadoes, or two thousand four hundred pounds sterling. Here are also several convents, above three thousand five hundred inhabitants, and a stately cathedral, with a castle, and several inferior courts.</P>
<P>Setuval, commonly called St. Ubes, a strong town, about twenty miles south of Lisbon, with a good harbour, on a small bay of the sea, into which the river Sandas discharges itself. It is much resorted to by most northern nations, chiefly for salt, of which vast quantities are made here. Exclusive of its walls, towers, bastions, and other outworks, it is defended by citadels and forts, in one of which is a light-house. Here are
<PB N="253" REF="2540"/>
several churches and courts of justice, and a great many convents. The town is under the jurisdic∣tion of the order of St. Jago. On the opposite bank of the river stands Troya, where the antient Caetobriga stood, the name of which, after being changed to Setobra, Setobala, and Setuval, was given to this place, which sprung up after the other was ruined by the Moors.</P>
<P>Santerem, a town on the Tagus, forty-two miles north-east from Lisbon. Its modern name is a cor∣ruption of St. Irene, a martyr, who lies buried there; but its antient name was Scalabis, and Ju∣lium Praesidium. The inhabitants, who are about three thousand, drive a good trade, and are sup∣plied with every thing they want by the river. Here are a great many churches and convents, an academy of history, antiquities, and languages, several hospitals and courts of justice, with a cita∣del, erected in the modern taste. Several kings of Portugal have kept their courts here.</P>
<P>Sintra, a town containing about two thousand in∣habitants, and standing near the sea, by the cape which bears its name, about sixteen miles west from Lisbon. It is said to enjoy the finest air and pro∣spect of any place in Portugal. Its name is a cor∣ruption of Cynthia, there having been antiently a temple on the Cape dedicated to the moon, or Cynthia, on the spot where is now a stately church dedicated to the blessed Virgin. Here is a mona∣stery, hewed entirely, with its church, out of the rock. The mountain of Sintra is rich in ore, and yields a great variety of plants, and has a vein of magnet.</P>
<P>Thomar, a town on the river Nabas, six miles from Lisbon, near which are the ruins of the an∣tient city of Nabancia. It takes its name from Thomas a Becket, the saint and patron of the place. Here are above three thousand inhabitants,

an academy of sciences founded in 1752, and se∣veral convents, among which is the chief of the order of Christ, the superior of it having the title of prior, and general of the order, with episcopal authority within the town and district.</P>
<P>Abrantes, a town near the Tagus, about sixty miles north-east from Lisbon. It is fortified, and stands on a hill, covered with gardens and olive∣yards, and commanding a most charming prospect.</P>

<P>The first of these names was given to this province on account of its situation on the other side of the Tagus; the reason of the second is obvious. It borders to the north on Estremadura and Beira, to the south on Algarve, to the east on Spain, and to the west on the sea; its greatest length being about one hundred and twenty miles, and its breadth nearly the same. This province is, for the most part, level and fruitful, yielding, in ge∣neral, plenty of wheat and barley, wine, oil, fruits, and game, fish, and gems, with several sorts of beautiful stone and marble. It contains four cities, eighty-eight smaller towns, three hundred and fifty-six parishes, and about two hundred and sixty-eight thousand souls. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Evora, a city seated in the heart of the province, sixty miles south-east of Lisbon, which was an∣tiently a Roman municipium, or free-town, and called Liberalitas Julia. Here are several hospi∣tals, courts of justice, and churches, besides the cathedral; a great many convents, an university erected anno 1559, about twelve thousand inhabi∣tants, and the see of an archbishop, who has a re∣venue
<PB N="256" REF="2570"/>
of about sixty thousand crusades, or eight thousand pounds sterling. It is defended by a fort, and other works, and is famed for the institution of the order of Avis, answering to that of Cala∣trava, in Spain.</P>
<P>Portalegre, formerly Portus-Alacer, a fortified city, about ninety miles east-north east from Lis∣bon, and ten from the Spanish frontier. Here are betwixt five and six thousand inhabitants, several courts of justice, fountains, convents, and churches, besides the cathedral, a manufacture of coarse wool∣len cloth, and the see of a bishop, who has about five hundred pounds sterling a-year. This town gives also the title of count to the marquis of Gouvea.</P>
<P>Elvas, a city with a castle, and other fortifica∣tions, one hundred and twenty miles east of Lis∣bon, antiently called Helva, and by Pliny, Alba. It is the see of a bishop, who has a revenue of a∣bout ten thousand crusadoes, or fourteen thou∣sand pounds. The neighbouring country is plea∣sant, and very fruitful in wine and oil, and the number of the inhabitants about three thousand. Here are several convents, churches, and courts of justice, with a noble aqueduct, extending several miles, and supported in some places by a triple arch.</P>
<P>Beja, a city, antiently called Pax Julia, and Augusta, about seventy-eight miles south-east from Lisbon, and twelve from the river Guadiana. It is a dukedom, and contains several churches, courts of justice and convents, with about six thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>Villa-Viçosa, i. e. the delightful town, so called from its beauty, and that of the adjacent country. It stands about one hundred and five miles east of Lisbon, and contains near four thousand inhabi∣tants, several convents, a stately royal palace, em∣bellished

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of ALGARVE.</HEAD>
<P>This little kingdom is bounded to the south and west by the ocean; to the east by the Guadiana, which parts it from Andalusia; and to the north by the mountains, called Serra de Algarve, or Caldeirao, and Serra de Monachique, which divide it from Alentejo; its greatest length being about one hundred miles, but its breadth only about twenty-eight. Its name is of Moorish extraction, but geographers are not agreed about its meaning. Under it was comprehended formerly a much larger extent of country than at present. The present Algarve was given by Alfonso X. king of Castile, to Alfonso III. king of Portugal, as a dowry or portion, when he married Beatrix, his natural daughter. Though very mountainous, it is very fertile in corn, wine, and oil, and all sorts of fruits, and contains four cities, twelve lesser towns, sixty villages, sixty-seven parishes, and about sixty thousand inhabitants. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Lagos, a town with a harbour on a large bay, about one hundred and ten miles south from Lis∣bon, and twenty-five east from Cape St. Vincent. Here are several convents and courts of justice, with two forts to defend the harbour, and about two thousand six hundred inhabitants. Here also, as it is supposed, stood the antient city of Laco∣briga.</P>
<P>Tavira, a city situated on a bay, at the mouth of the river Sequa, one hundred and twelve miles south-east from Lisbon, and supposed to be the Balsa of the antients. Besides walls, it has a castle for its defence, near five thousand inhabitants, se∣veral convents, and a harbour guarded by two sorts.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="2600"/>
Faro, a city situated on a bay, and well fortisied, with a harbour and castle, not far from Cape St. Mary, called by Pliny, Promontonum Cunium.

<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the AZORES, or TERCEIRA ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>These islands, which are nine in number, de∣rive the name of Azores from the great number of hawks found on them when first discovered; and the other from that of the principal island among them. They are also called the Western Islands, from their situation in respect of Portugal, being situated in the Atlantic Ocean, between 25 and 32 degrees west longitude, and between 37 and 40 north latitude, nine hundred miles west of Portugal, and as many east of Newfoundland, lying almost in the midway between Europe and America. The most considerable of them are,</P>
<P>St. Miguel, or St. Michael, which is about one hundred miles in circumference, and the most fruitful
<PB N="260" REF="2610"/>
and populous of them all, producing plenty of corn and wine, and containing above fifty thousand in∣habitants, exclusive of ecclesiastics, monks, and nuns. Its two principal towns and harbours are, Ponta-Delgada, and Villa-Franca. It had the name of St. Michael from its being discovered on the 8th of May, the festival of the appearance of St. Michael.</P>
<P>Terceira was so called because it was the third that was discovered. It is esteemed the chief island, on account of its having the best harbour, and a city, where the governor of these islands and the bishop resides, though it is not so large as St. Mi∣chael. The city is called Angra, and stands on the south side of the island. Here is a spacious harbour, with two forts for the defence both of it and the town, eight convents, several courts and offices, and five churches, besides the cathedral. It is a neat, populous, well-built city.</P>
<P>Pico owes its name to a mountain of a vast height. It is almost as large as St. Michael, carries on a great trade in its excellent wines, and abounds with cedar, and a tough red wood, called Teixos, and much valued. Its principal harbour is Villa das Lagens, on the south.</P>
<P>The other islands are Fayal, an earldom, St. Jorge, Sta. Maria, Graciosa, Flores, and Corvo. All these have one or more harbours.</P>

<HEAD>SPAIN.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NAME, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>SPAIN was antiently called Iberia and His∣peria; and it is supposed to have had the first of these names from the river Iberus, and the other from its western situation. Hespania, from which all its modern names are derived, is sup∣posed to have been formed from the Phenician word sepan or sepana, signifying a rabbit, with which animal this country hath always abounded. It is the most western part of the continent of Eu∣rope, lying between the 36th and 44th degrees of north latitude, and between the 3d of east and 10th of west longitude; and is bounded on the east and south by the Mediterranean, the Streights of Gibraltar, and part of the Atlantic Ocean; on the west by the same ocean, and Portugal; and on the north by the Bay of Biscay, and the ridge of
<PB N="262" REF="2640"/>
mountains called the Pyrenees, which part it from France. Its greatest length, from east to west, is about seven hundred miles; and its greatest breadth, from north to south, about four hundred and eighty. By the Romans, Spain, including Portugal, was di∣vided into Hispania Cuterior or Tarraconensis, and Hispania Ulterior; of which the latter was subdivided into Betica and Lusitania: in each of these were planted a great many Roman colonies. After the Romans, it was possessed by the Goths, and other barbarous nations, and then by the Moors; from whom it was gradually recovered by the Christians, who erected several petty kingdoms in it, as the infidels had done before them: thence proceeded the present division of Spain into four∣teen kingdoms and provinces.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the air, during the months of June, July, and August, it is excessive hot in the day-time; but the rest of the year it is pleasant and temperate. Even during the above months, it is very cool in the shade; and so cold in the night, that it makes a traveller shiver; and in the day-time the violent heat continues only for about four or five hours. In the north, on the mountains and near the sea-coast, the air is much less sultry in summer than in the south, especially in the lower parts of the country, and at a distance from the sea. It seldom rains here, except a∣bout the equinoxes, and the frosts are very gen∣tle towards the south; but on the mountains in the north, and north-east, the air is very sharp in winter. Both in the south and north, the air is generally clear and serene; and, as in the northern countries distempers, for the most part, proceed from colds; so, in Spain, they are commonly the
<PB N="263" REF="2650"/>
effects of heat. As to what regards the soil, tho' there are some sandy barren desarts in the south, and many barren mountains in the north, yet in the greater part of the country, particularly in the vallies and plains, the soil is good, producing a great variety of rich wines, oil, and fruits, such as oranges, lemons, prunes, citrons, almonds, raisins, dates, figs, chesnuts, pomegranates, capers, pears, and peaches; but not a sufficiency of grain, which is chiefly owing to the neglect of tillage. Wheat and barley are the most common grain; the for∣mer of which is said by some to be the best in Eu∣rope. There is not much flax, hemp, oats, or hay in Spain; but plenty of honey, salt, fine wool, silk, and cotton; and, in some places, of rice and sugar-canes. Here also are abundance of mules, and, in some provinces, of horses, together with deer, wild-fowl, and other game, Chamois and other goats, but few horned cattle. Wolves are almost the only wild beasts in the country. The herb kali, which is used in making salt, soap, and glass, grows in great plenty on the sea-shore. The wild bulls, used in their bull-fights, are bred in An∣delusia. The seas about Spain are well stored with fish, among which is the anchovy, in the Mediter∣ranean. We may guess at the number of sheep here by that of the shepherds, which is said to be about forty thousand. There is a curious account of the sheep-walks in Spain in the Annual Regi∣ster for the year 1766. The sheep that bear the fine wool move regularly every summer, from south to north, along the mountains, which yield a great variety of sweet-herbs and plants, and re∣turn again towards winter. During this progress, large quantities of salt are distributed among them, and all possible care is taken both of their health and fleeces.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS and RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The chief mountains are the Pyrenees, which stretch from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, but not in a direct line, for near two hun∣dred miles: their breadth is, in some places, not less than eighty. That called the Pic de Midi is of a prodigious height. Over these mountains there are only about five passages out of Spain into France, and these also narrow: even the vallies between the mountains are covered with thick and lofty woods. The other chains in Spain are the Sierra d'Occa, Sierra Molino, Sierra Morena, and Sierra Novada, or the Snowy Moun∣tains. Near Gibraltar, opposite to Mount Abyla in Africa, stands the celebrated Mount Calpe: these were antiently called Hercules's Pillars. The mountains yield great quantities of timber for ship∣ping, which are conveyed by the Ebro, and other rivers, to the Mediterranean. According to the antient and modern writers, they abound also with gold, silver, iron, lead, tin, cinnabar, quicksilver, alum, vitriol, copperas, lapis calaminaris, &amp;c. be∣sides gems, and mineral waters both hot and cold. The gold and silver mines are not worked at pre∣sent, but those of iron are. The neglect of the for∣mer is owing partly to the indolence of the Spa∣niards, and partly to the gold and silver imported from America. Besides the rivers Minho, Douro, Tagus, Monda, Lima, and Guadiana, mentioned in Portugal, but which have their sources in Spain, the most considerable are the Ebro, Olim Iberus, Guadalavier or Turio, Guadalquiver, Olim Pe∣rea Boetis and Tartessus, Segura, and Zucar. The Guadiana is supposed to have had the name of Anas, or the Duck, formerly, from the false notion of its losing itself under-ground.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION and LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>As to religion, the Spaniards are jealous Ro∣manists. No where is there more pomp, farce, and parade, in what regards religion; and no where less true Christianity. Their zeal, and their superstition, exceed that of any other Roman catholic country; unless, perhaps, we should except Portugal. No where does the inquisition reign with greater terror; there being no subject who is not liable to be pro∣secuted by the holy office, as it is called. In that court it is hardly possible for a prisoner to make a tolerable defence, not being suffered to know ei∣ther his accusers or the witnesses against him; but he is required to confess himself guilty, or submit to the torture, until such a confession is extorted from him as the fathers require. God and Christ are much less respected here than the virgin Mary, and other saints; but this is not to be wondered at: in every country religion will become a ridicu∣lous mummery, where reasoning and the scriptures are disallowed, and the laity are slaves to the cler∣gy, the latter always thriving in proportion to the ignorance and blindness of the former. Not to work on Saturday, or to eat pork, is enough to make a man be taken up as a Jew or Mahometan, and, in consequence of that, stripped of his all, and per∣haps burnt into the bargain. The inquisitor-general is a person of great power, dignity, and importance: he is named by the king, and confirmed by the pope, and is at the head of the supreme court of the inquisition at Madrid, subordinate to which are se∣veral other courts of inquisition, with, it is said, above twenty thousand inferior officers, dispersed as spies and informers, all over Spain and the Indies. There is no doubt but there were many converts to Christianity here in St. Paul's time, who, in his
<PB N="266" REF="2680"/>
epistle to the Romans, mentions his intention to visit Spain; and some of the fathers affirm, that he was actually there. There are eight archbishops in Spain, seven in America, and one in Asia, at Ma∣nilla; each of which has his suffragan bishops. The archbishop of Toledo is primate, chancellor of Castile, and, by virtue of his office, privy coun∣sellor. He is said to have a revenue of an hundred thousand pounds sterling per annum, or more. The king nominates all archbishops and bishops; and, since 1753, all small benefices are also in his gift. He has also lately obtained a power to tax eccle∣siastical possessions, according to his pleasure, and the exigency of affairs. Though the rest of the nation is poor, the clergy are immensely rich, and their revenues, of all kinds, amazingly great. Most of the towns and estates belong to them, and are exempt from all public burdens; yet their avarice is insatiable, especially that of the Mendicant friars, though they profess poverty. Their commerce, which is free from all duties and imposts, is also a rich fund to them: but it is to be observed, that the order of Jesuits, which was the chief dealer in this way, has been lately suppressed in this country, and all their estates seized; which was executed with the greatest address, secrecy, and success, both in Europe and the other domi∣nions belonging to the crown. It was thought that the influence they had acquired over this de∣luded people was so great, that no king would have ventured to attempt any thing against them. Tho' the Spaniards are naturally men of wit, and an ele∣vated genius, yet little progress in the sciences is to be expected from them, while the clergy use their ut∣most efforts to keep them in ignorance, branding all literary researches with the name of heresy, and in∣veighing against the seats of the muses, as the schools of hell, where the devil teaches sorcery. There are
<PB N="267" REF="2690"/>
twenty-two universities, and several academies, in Spain; but so constituted, and under such restric∣tions, that they can never attain to any measure of true learning. The inquisition is extremely vigilant in suppressing whatever might tend to open the eyes of the public. There are few printing-houses in Spain, and most of the books in that language are published in other countries.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>In regard to trade and manufactures, the Spa∣niards are far from making such a figure as might be expected. Most of the laborious work in their husbandry, manufactures, and handicrafts, is per∣formed by the French, especially in the two Castiles, and the midland provinces, the natives being either too lazy, or too proud, to stoop to such employments. By these means, the French usually return with large fortunes to their own country. The chief manufactures of Spain are those of silk, wool, iron, copper, and other hardwares; but these fall far short of the flourishing condition they might be brought to: hence, a great part of the treasures of America go to the foreign merchants, who supply them with goods for that part of the world. How∣ever it is certain, that Spain, since it hath had princes of the house of Bourbon upon the throne, hath improved its revenues, increased its forces by sea and land, and applied itself more than it did before to manufactures and husbandry; having shaken off, in some measure, that idle indolent dis∣position which rendered it so contemptible in the eyes of other nations: but it will be a long time before they will be able to supply the wants of their own country, and those of America, in any great degree. Spain is extremely well situated for trade; but most of its produce is exported by fo∣reigners,
<PB N="268" REF="2700"/>
except what is carried to the Indies; and even with regard to that trade, they are little better than factors to the English, French, Dutch, and Italians. Smuggling, which was formerly carried to a great height, is now, in a great measure, suppressed. Since the year 1750, the exportation of silver hath been allowed, on the payment of three per cent. From 1735 almost to 1756, the flotas and galleons were discontinued, and the trade to America carried on in register-ships, which any merchant might send, on permission obtained from the council of the Indies; but then the flotas and galleons were restored. The Assogue ships are two vessels which carry quicksilver, on the king's account, to Vera Cruz. There is a company which has an exclusive grant for trading to the Ca∣raccas, and another for trading to Porto Rico, the Bay of Honduras, the province of Guatimala, and Hispaniola; but the Spanish part of the last, it is said, hath been lately ceded to the French; and, by the last peace concluded with France and Spain, the English are not to be molested in cutting logwood in the bay of Honduras. One ship, and sometimes two, sails annually from Ma∣nilla, in the island of Luconia, one of the Phi∣lippines, for Acapulco, in Mexico: her cargo, which belongs to the convents, consists of the principal commodities of that part of the world; but the return from Acapulco is, for the most part, made in money, and amounts to a vast sum, as ap∣peared from the treasure found on board the Aca∣pulco ship taken by Lord Anson. The city of Manilla was taken in the late war by the English, under General Draper and Admiral Pococke, and ransomed by the Spaniards; but the ransom hath never yet been paid, or only in part. In return for the manufactures sent to America, the Spaniards receive gold, silver, cochineal, indigo, the cocoa or
<PB N="269" REF="2710"/>
chocolate nut, logwood, and other dying woods, sugar, tobacco, snuff, and other productions of that part of the world; supplying most part of Europe and Asia with the silver they bring from thence in their galleons. In the time of the Moors and Goths, this kingdom was exceeding populous. It is said then to have contained between twenty and thirty millions; whereas now, it does not con∣tain above seven or eight: and this, among other causes, is owing to the pride and laziness of the inhabitants, want of manufactures, and good regu∣lations, neglect of the mines and agriculture, the expulsion of the Moors, the peopling of America, heavy taxes, the great number of convents, exces∣sive venery, and the consequent infecundity of both sexes. Their debauchery and sterility are partly occasioned by their way of living; for they make great use of spices, and drink a great deal of cho∣colate, and strong wine mixed with brandy. The causes assigned for the want of people in Spain will account, in some measure, for its poverty; not∣withstanding it is computed, that it receives, one year with another, setting aside other sums, above twenty-six millions of pieces of eight, in registered gold and silver. As most of the manufactures that are sent to America are furnished by England, France, Italy, and Holland; so a great part of the trea∣sure brought home by the galleons is paid to the merchants of those nations.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>Accounts in Spain are kept in reals, and mara∣vidies de plata or silver, which are imaginary coins, thirty-four maravidies making a real, equal in value to about five-pence halfpenny. The gold coins are pistoles, or doubloons, value about seventeen shil∣lings; double and quadruple, half and quarter
<PB N="270" REF="2720"/>
pistoles. The silver coins are reals de plata, or silver, worth somewhat above six-pence of our money; pi∣astres, or pieces of eight, worth about four shillings and six-pence; half and quarter pieces of eight, but these are rare. They have also small brass money called quartos and octavos, like our half∣pence and farthings. The Spanish escudos, or crowns, and ducats, are imaginary coins, and both of the value of about six shillings of our money. There are also imaginary piasters and pistoles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>With regard to the constitution of Spain, it is at present an absolute hereditary monarchy, where the females inherit in default of the males. The king, in his title, enumerates most of the provinces, and particular parts of the dominions he has been, or is possessed of. In speaking of him, he is commonly called his catholic majesty, or the catholic king. The hereditary prince is commonly stiled prince of Asturias, and the other royal children infants. The kings of Spain are never crowned; they seem to have a power to dispose of the crown to what branch of the royal family they please, of which we have an instance, when Charles II. gave his do∣minions to the duke of Anjou. For the admini∣stration of the government, and of justice, here are several councils and tribunals; as the junta, or cabinet-council, the privy-council, the council of war, the council of Castile, the council of the in∣quisition, the council of the Indies, the seven courts of royal audiences, &amp;c. Since the beginning of the seventeenth century, and the reign of Philip III. the cortes, or parliaments of this kingdom, have been discontinued. The higher nobility here con∣sists of counts, marquisses, and dukes. The gran∣dees, who have precedence of all others, next the
<PB N="271" REF="2730"/>
king and princes of the blood, are named out of these. Like those of Portugal, they have the pri∣vilege of being covered in the king's presence, who stiles them in his letters, illustrious; and in speak∣ing to them, or of them, their eminences: but there are others, beside the grandees, who are co∣vered in the king's presence, as cardinals, nun∣cios, archbishops, the grand-prior of Castile, and the grand-prior of Malta, the generals of the orders of St. Dominic and St. Francis, ambassadors of crowned heads, the knights of the golden-fleece, and of the three military orders of St. James, Ca∣latrava, and Alcantara, when the king assists at their respective chapters, in quality of grand∣master. No grandee can be apprehended for any crime, but by the express order of the king, and they have many other privileges besides these. The in∣ferior nobility stile themselves cavalleros and hi∣dalgos.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORDERS of KINGHTHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>Of the orders in Spain, that of the golden-fleece is the principal, which was instituted in 1430 by Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and is com∣mon now to the kings of Spain and the house of Austria. The order of St. Jago de Compostella was instituted in the year 1175, by Ferdinand II. king of Leon. The order of Calatrava was found∣ed by Sancho III. of Castile. The order of Alcan∣tara owes its institution to Ferdinand II. king of Leon. The three last orders have large comman∣deries, or estates annexed to them. The masters of them were once so powerful, that they disputed the king's authority over them: whereupon the king procured those masterships to be conferred on himself by the pope, that they might no longer
<PB N="272" REF="2740"/>
assume an independency of the state. The knights of these three orders are esteemed noblemen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>In the last century the revenues of Spain amount∣ed to thirty-two or thirty-three millions of livres; but at the death of Charles II. they were so reduced, that they did not exceed seven or eight millions. At present, the revenues of the crown arising in Spain are computed at five millions sterling per annum, besides what arises from America. The silver mines there are inexhaustible, and of the produce of these a fifth belongs to the king. The taxes in Spain are numerous and heavy. The land forces, in time of peace, are computed at about eighty thousand; and in time of war, must be much more numerous. Their navy at present, consists of a∣bout forty men of war, frigates, and chebecs. Many of their men of war are now built at the Ha∣vannah, and of cedar. When the English took the Havannah in the last war, they found several such there.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, and CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the language of this country, it approaches, especially that spoken in Castile, which is by far the purest, the nearest to the Latin of any language in Europe, mixed with Arabic words and terminations, introduced by the Moors. In some provinces the vulgar tongue is a dialect of the old French, or rather Gascon, which is little understood in the others. In Biscay the language is said to be a dialect of the Gothic or Celtic, and to have some analogy with the Welch and Irish. As to what regards the character of the Spaniards, they do not want either an inclination or capacity
<PB N="273" REF="2750"/>
for the sciences, but have hardly any opportunity of acquiring any true learning or knowledge, at least in their schools and universities. They are admired for their secrecy, constancy, gravity, pa∣tience in adversity, and loyalty. They are also said to be true to their words, great enemies to lying, temperate in eating and drinking, and so nice and jealous in point of honour, that they will stick at nothing to wipe off any stain that is cast upon it. Among their vices and defects are reckoned their pride, and contempt of foreigners, their indolence, laziness, lust, bigotry, and credulity in believing the feigned miracles and legends of their monks. They are also said to be extremely passionate, jealous, and vindictive; and are noted, above any other European nation, for their contempt of, and aver∣sion to, agriculture, arts, and manufactures.</P>
<P>As for the dominions and possessions of Spain in Asia, Africa, and America, we shall give an ac∣count of them, when we come to treat of these quarters of the globe. The kingdom of Spain it∣self consists of fourteen provinces and some islands, which we shall describe in order, beginning from the north.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of GALICIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province, which was formerly a kingdom, is bounded on the west by the ocean; on the east by Asturia and Leon; on the north by the bay of Biscay; and on the south by Portugal. It is sup∣posed to have had its name from its antient inha∣bitants the Gauls. Its figure is almost square, ex∣tending about one hundred and twenty miles every way; but it is but thinly inhabited, except on the sea-coast, where there is a great number of ports, and several promontories, especially that noted one
<PB N="274" REF="2760"/>
called Cape Finisterre. The province is well stored with cattle, hogs, mules, and horses; yielding also wine, wood for firing, and timber for ships and houses, some flax, lemons, wheat, millet, large turneps, all kinds of herbs, and fine marble; but its mines of gold and silver are either exhausted, or neglected. It is a mountainous country, and one of the coldest and poorest in Spain; but well watered by many rivers, and smaller streams. Of the former the principal are, the Minho, the Ulla, the Tambra, and the Mandeo, which, with the neighbouring sea, abound with fish, particularly sardines and salmon. The principal places in this province are,</P>
<P>Compostella, or St. Jago de Compostella, the capital, and an archbishop's see. It is situated be∣twixt the rivers Tambra and Ulla, having a strong castle and walls, and containing several fair streets, squares, monasteries, hospitals, colleges, and churches. The archbishop is absolute both in spi∣rituals and temporals, and has a revenue of sixty thousand ducats per annum. The cathedral is a most magnificent structure, and contains the pre∣tended body of the apostle James the younger, the tutelary saint and patron of all Spain. There is a prodigious concourse of pilgrims always at this place, to pay their devotions to the shrine of the saint, on whose account the cathedral hath been enriched with a constant flow of rich offerings and gifts, and distinguished by many privileges, as well as the town. All the dignitaries, and seven of the canons, have the title of cardinals, and are allowed to say pontifical mass in St. James's chapel; and the see is independent of any but that of Rome. Here also is an university, erected in 1532, a court of inquisition, a sovereign court, two annual fairs, and a market every week. The chief of the hos∣pitals is that for the reception of pilgrims. From
<PB N="275" REF="2770"/>
this city the order of St. Jago takes its name. The effigy of that apostle, in the cathedral, is supported by four kings of Spain, and six angels, mounted on as many columns.</P>
<P>Lugo, antiently called Lucus Augusti, whence its present name was formed, a small city, about seventy miles east of Compostella. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to St. Jago, and has a revenue of eighteen thousand ducats. Here are many warm baths, some of which are only luke∣warm, and others boiling hot. This town is in∣closed with a strong wall, so broad, that two coaches may go abreast upon it; and its neighbourhood produces turneps of fifty pounds weight, and very well tasted.</P>
<P>Corunna, antiently Brigantium, a sea-port town on the Bay of Biscay, called by our seamen the Groyne. It is a place of considerable trade, having a spacious harbour, with walls and forts, several convents, chapels, churches, and hospitals. In its neighbourhood is a quarry of jasper. It stands thirty miles north of Compostella, and is the seat of the governor, and royal audience of Galicia.</P>
<P>Tui, a walled city on the river Minho, about forty miles south of Compostella, and not far from Vulença in Portugal. It is the see of a bishop, who has a revenue of ten thousand ducats, and enjoys a good air, being delightfully situated a∣midst gardens and vineyards.</P>
<P>Orense, another episcopal city, standing also on the Minho, over which it has a strong bridge, forty miles south-east from Compostella. The Romans, according to some, called it Aquae Calidae Caldenses, and Urentes; but according to others, Aquae Celeniae, and Alinae, from the hot springs in and about it. From Urentes its present name is supposed to have been formed. The bishop is suffragan to St. Jago, and has a revenue of ten
<PB N="276" REF="2780"/>
thousand ducats per annum. The springs of this place, some of which are boiling hot, are salutary in several distempers. The neighbouring country a∣bounds in wine and fine fruit.</P>
<P>Mondonnedo, a small city, seventy miles north of Compostella, and about sixteen from the sea∣coast. It is the see of a bishop, who is lord of the city, suffragan to St. Jago, and has an income of seven thousand ducats.</P>
<P>Betanzos, a city on the river Mandeo, with a good harbour, to the northward of Corunna. It is walled, and supposed by some to be the Brigan∣tium of Ptolemy, and the Flavium Brigantium of Dio Cassius.</P>
<P>Vigo, a town on a small bay, where the Eng∣lish and Dutch, in 1702, took, or burnt, the Spanish plate-fleet.</P>
<P>Ferrol, a handsome town, with a fine harbour, two leagues from Corunna.</P>
<P>Monrorte de Lemos, a town belonging, toge∣ther with the county, of which it is the capital, to the condé, or count of Lemos, who has a stately seat here. On a high mountain, in its neighbour∣hood, is a spring, that ebbs and flows with the sea, and is sometimes hot, and sometimes cold.</P>
<P>Finisterre, a small town near the cape of that name.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of the ASTURIAS.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded by Biscay on the east; by Galicia on the west; by Old Castile and Leon on the south; and by the sea on the north. It is about one hundred and ten miles in length, and fifty-four in breadth; being divided into Astu∣ria d' Cviedo, and Asturia de Santillana, which together are called the Asturias. On the south it is separated from Old Castile and Leon by high
<PB N="277" REF="2790"/>
mountains covered with woods. The province is but thinly inhabited, yet yields plenty of fruit, and excellent wine; nor is it destitute of grain. The inhabitants value themselves much on their being the genuine descendants of the Goths; and, on this account, are also much honoured by the rest of the nation, those of them especially who inha∣bit the mountain of Ausena, where Pelayo, the Gothic prince, defeated the Moors. These, tho' poor peasants, and fain to go into the other pro∣vinces to find work, yet call themselves illustrious Goths, and Mountaineers, and think it ignomi∣nious to intermarry even with great and rich fa∣milies of another race. This pride hath been fed and flattered not only by the particular privileges bestowed upon them, but by the respect paid them by the rest of the nation, and by the courting, and even purchasing of their alliance. The Astu∣rias are also distinguished by giving title to the he∣reditary prince of Spain. The places of most note in them are,</P>
<P>Oviedo, antiently called Brigetum, the capital, situated about twenty miles from the Bay of Biscay, between the Little Ove and Duva, from the former of which it is supposed to take its name. It is the see of a bishop, who is immediately subject to the pope, and has an income of twelve thousand ducats. Here is also an university, founded in 1580, seve∣ral convents, chapels, churches, and hospitals: and here Pelayo, and the first Christian kings, after the conquest of Spain by the Moors, resided. The neighbouring country is very mountainous, but abounds in grain, cattle, and chesnut trees. The town has strong walls, and is the seat of the royal audience for the province.</P>
<P>Gyon, a small town near the sea, with a good wall, castle, and port. It was called by the Ro∣mans Arae Sextiae, or Sestinae, and was once the
<PB N="278" REF="2800"/>
capital of the Asturias, and the residence of Pelayo, whose successors, for some time, stiled themselves kings of Gyon.</P>
<P>Santillana, in Latin, Fanum Stae Julianae, a small town on the Bay of Biscay, belonging to the duke del' Infantado, to whom it gives the title of marquis. It is supposed to be the Caulana, or Caucana, of the Greek and Roman authors. It was once called Llanjulian, which, as well as its Latin name, signifies the church of St. Julian; Llan, in the old Basque, or Biscayan, signifying a church, as it does in the British or Welch.</P>
<P>St. Andero, formerly Portus Sti Emederi, a small town, with a large, secure, and well forti∣fied harbour, which, however, has a dangerous rock at the entrance. A great many fishermen live in the suburbs.</P>
<P>The earldom of Liebana, in this province, be∣longing to the dukes del' Infantado, is one of the most craggy and mountainous parts of Spain, so that the Moors could never get footing in it; yet produces plenty of corn, wine, fruit, cattle, and game.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LORDSHIP of BISCAY, in Latin CANTABRIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded to the north by the Bay of Biscay; to the south by Old Castile; to the west by the Asturias; and to the east by the French and Spanish Navarre: its extent from west to east being about one hundred and sixteen miles, and from north to south about eighty, where broadest. The soil here is very unequal: in some places they have such plenty of apples, that cyder is the com∣mon drink of the inhabitants; in others, particu∣larly on the sea-coast, they have oranges and le∣mons in great plenty, and sell them very cheap;
<PB N="279" REF="2810"/>
but though the country in general is mountainous and barren, besides the abovementioned products, some flax, corn, and wine are produced in the val∣lies, and store of excellent timber on the moun∣tains; which yield also lead, and the best iron in the world, which is exported to a large amount, either unwrought, or wrought into all sorts of iron work, especially swords and fire arms. The inha∣bitants are reckoned the best sailors and soldiers in Spain, and enjoy many privileges. They are of Cel∣tic or Gothic extract, and have preserved more of their antient genius, laws, government, manners, and, we may add, of their language, than perhaps any other people in Europe, unless we should ex∣cept the Welch, Scotch Highlanders, or wild Irish, who are of the same origin, and whose language comes the nearest of any other to the Biscayan. This province contains Biscay Proper, Guipuscoa, and Alaba, or Alava. In the first of these the principal places are,</P>
<P>Ordunna, which, though small, is the only place in the province that is dignified with the name of city. It stands about eighteen miles from the sea, and is surrounded with high mountains.</P>
<P>Bilbao, vulgarly called Bilboa, the capital of the province, though no city, pleasantly situated on the river Ybaiçabal, six miles from the sea, where it has a good port, and a great trade in iron, wrought and unwrought, wool, saffron, and chesnuts. It is large and populous, standing where was formerly the Portus Amanus, and taking its name from a ford near the town, as having been at first called Bello Vado, which was at last cor∣rupted into Bilbao or Bilboa. They suffer none to settle here, nor indeed in the rest of the province, and some other parts of Spain, but such as can prove that they are descended from the antient Gothic Christians, and that their blood is untained with that of Jews or Moors.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="2820"/>
Durango, a small, but well inhabited town, a∣bout fifteen miles from Bilboa to the south east. Most of the inhabitants are employed in the iron∣manufacture.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In GUIPUSCOA the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>San Sebastian, a pretty large town, and noted port, on the Bay of Biscay, at the mouth of the little river Gurumea, by the antients called Me∣nascum. The town is handsome, well-fortified, and has a good harbour and citadel, carrying on also a considerable trade in iron, steel, and wool, and enjoying a pleasant prospect of the sea on one side, and the Pyrenean mountains on the other. Here is a company which trades to the Caraccas.</P>
<P>Fuentarabia, in Latin, Fonsrabidus, a little neat town on the utmost borders of Spain, next to France, from which it is separated only by the river Bidassoa, or Vidasso, at the mouth whereof it stands. It has a pretty good harbour, and is fortified both by nature and art. Its name is a contraction of Fuentarrabaya, which, some say, signifies the strand of the spring or river. The island of Pheasants in the river Bidassao, mentioned in our account of France, and famous on account of the peace of the Pyrenees, concluded there in 1659, and the treaty of marriage between Lewis XIV. and Maria The∣resia, infanta of Spain, lies about nine miles from this town.</P>
<P>Tolosa, called by the French Tolosette, to distinguish it from Tholouse, the capital of Lan∣guedoc, a handsome town, twelve miles south of St. Sebastian, at the conflux of the Araxas and Oria.</P>
<P>There are several other small towns in Guipuscoa, of which Mondragon is noted for its medicinal
<PB N="281" REF="2830"/>
springs and cyder, and Salmas for its salt-springs. In this part of the province lies also the district of Loyola, which belonged to St. Ignatius, founder of the order of Jesuits, and the Sierra de Adriane, which took its name from the hermit Adrian, and is reckoned the highest mountain among the Py∣renees.</P>
<P>Alaba produces rye, barley, several kinds of fruits and wine, with rich iron and steel mines; but the only place worth mentioning in it is Vitoria, the capital, which is surrounded with a wall, and carries on a great trade in iron, steel, wool, wine, and sword-blades. The monasteries in it are mag∣nificent, particularly that of St. Francis.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of NAVARRE.</HEAD>
<P>This is only a part of the antient kingdom of Navarre, (which was erected soon after the invasion of the Moors) and is otherwise called Upper-Na∣varre, to distinguish it from Lower-Navarre, be∣longing to the French. Its name is supposed to be a contraction of nava errea, signifying, in the lan∣guage of the Vascones its antient inhabitants, a land of vallies. It borders to the south on Arragon; to the north by the Pyrenees, by which and Arragon it is bounded also to the east; and to the west it has Old-Castile and Biscay: extending from south to north about eighty miles, and from east to west about seventy-five. As this country lies among the Pyrenees, it abounds in sheep and cattle, game of all kinds, as boars, stags, and roe-bucks, and in wild-fowl, horses, and honey, yielding also some grain, wine, oil, and a variety of minerals, medici∣nal waters, and hot-baths. Some of the antient chiefs of this country were called Sobrarbores, from the custom, as it is supposed, which prevailed

among some of those free nations of chusing and swearing their princes under some particular tree. From the year 718 to 1512, it had kings of its own, of different families; but, in the last of these years, Ferdinand, king of Castile, took possession of it, expelling the lawful prince thereof, John de Albret. No part of the revenues of this province goes into the king's treasury; but must all be em∣ployed, pursuant to a compact, in the public service. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Pampelona, the capital, situated at the foot of the Pyrenees, and walled. It is said to have been built by Pompey the Great, and from hence called Pompeiopolis. It is the see of a bishop, who is subject to the archbishop of Burgos, and has a re∣venue of twenty-eight thousand ducats. Here is an university founded in 1608, two castles, several churches, and a great many convents. Two high roads lead from this city, over the Pyrenees, to France; one to Bayonne, through the valley of Batan, and the other, which is the best, to St. Jean pie de Port, by the way of Taraffa.</P>
<P>Tafalla, a pretty large and handsome city on the river Cadaço, with a castle, and an university.</P>
<P>Olita, a small city on the river Cadaço, where the kings of Navarre formerly resided.</P>
<P>Tudela, a city pleasantly situated on the banks of the Ebro, fifty-eight miles south of Pampelona. It is walled, and has several churches and convents, with a stately bridge over the Ebro.</P>
<P>Estella, a handsome town on the river Ega. Its name signifies a star, having been built to guide and comfort, like a star, the weary pilgrims, passing thro' these wild mountains, in their way to Compostella.</P>
<P>Cascante, a small city on the banks of the river Quelles, in the district of Tudela. Its Roman name was Cascantum; and some coins of Tiberius are still extant, inscribed <HI>Muiceps Cascantum.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="2850"/>
Viana, a pretty good town on the Ebro, near Lograno, in Castile. Its name is supposed to be a corruption of Diana, who is said to have had a famed temple here in antient times. The king of Navarre's eldest son had formerly the title of prince of Viana.</P>
<P>Sanguesa, antiently Hurissa, a small town on the river Arragon.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of ARRAGON.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom is bounded on the south by Va∣lentia, on the north by the Pyrenean mountains, on the east by Catalonia, and on the west by Na∣varre and Castile; extending in length from south to north about an hundred and seventy miles, and in breadth about an hundred and ten. Its principal rivers are the Ebro, the Cinca or Cinga, the Cal∣lego, antiently called Gallicus, the Isuela, the Xa∣lon, the Xeloca, the Arragon, the Guadalaviar, and Guadalope. It is in general a barren country, producing little, except where it is watered by the rivers, or by art; and there it yields corn, wine, oil, flax, and, in some places, saffron. It was erected into a kingdom in the beginning of the eleventh century. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Saragoza, the capital, situated on the banks of the Ebro, and almost in the heart of the province. It was antiently a Roman colony, and called Cae∣saria or Caesar Augusta, of which its present name is a manifest corruption. It is a large, magnifi∣cent, populous city, standing in a pleasant fertile plain, watered by four rivers, and containing a great many splendid convents and churches; but the cathedral is an old irregular building. The archbishop has a revenue of fifty thousand ducats. The university here was founded in 1744. A great many persons of quality reside in this city,
<PB N="284" REF="2860"/>
which has also a considerable trade, and is the seat of the court of royal audience for Arragon, of the governor and captain-general, and an office of inquisition. Of the churches, that of our Lady of the pillar, and of the convents, that of St. Fran∣cis, are the most remarkable. Here are two state∣ly bridges over the Ebro, and the walls of the city, though old, are strong and lofty.</P>
<P>Huesca, a handsome town on the river Isuela, about thirty miles north-east from Saragoza. Here is an university, founded in the year 1354; and the see of a bishop, who has a revenue of thirteen thousand ducats per annum; with several mona∣steries. The city stands in a healthy pleasant air, and fertile soil.</P>
<P>Turriel, a city on the banks of the Turias or Guadalaviar, where it is joined by the Alhambria, about eighty miles south of Saragoza. The river is called by Ptolemy Turiolus, and much extolled by Claudian for the rich flowery verdure of its banks. Here is a citadel, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Saragoza, and has a revenue of six thousand ducats.</P>
<P>Calatayud, a large city, at the conflux of the Xa∣lon and Xiloca, forty-five miles south-west of Sa∣ragoza. The air and situation are very pleasant, the walls strong, and the convents numerous. The Romans gave it the name of Bilbelis. It was then noted for its steel; for the tempering of which Martial, who was born here, in one of his epigrams, attributes a particular virtue to the wa∣ters of the river Xalon. Ayud, a Moorish king of Seville, gave it the name of Calat-ayud, or the City of Ayud, which it hath retained ever since.</P>
<P>Barbastro, a town on the river Vero, over which it hath a stately bridge. It stands about fifty-one miles from Saragoza, on a spacious fertile plain, is surrounded with a wall, contains several con∣vents,
<PB N="285" REF="2870"/>
and is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Saragoza, and has an income of eight thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Albarracin, a walled city, called antiently Lobe∣tum and Turia, situated on the Guadalaviar, to∣wards the borders of Castile. It had its present name from a Moorish nobleman, who was lord of it. Here is a castle, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Saragoza, and has an income of six thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Daroca, a considerable town on the river Xi∣loca, forty-eight miles from Saragoza. It is walled, and situated on an eminence, amidst a fertile and delicious plain. Here are several convents, cha∣pels, squares, and fountains; and in the neighbour∣hood is a large cave, of which they tell many won∣ders. They pretend also to have in one of their churches six linen cloths, stained with the blood that came from so many consecrated wafers, which were wrapped up in them, upon an alarm of the approach of the Moors.</P>
<P>Tarazona, a considerable town on the little river Queiles, thirty-six miles north-west from Saragoza, mentioned by Pliny, Ptolemy, and Strabo, under the name of Turiasso. Near it is Mon Cayo, an∣tiently Mons Caci, which name the Spaniards pre∣tend it had from the tyrant Cacus, who was killed by Hercules. The town is well built and walled, drives a good trade, and is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Saragoza, and has a revenue of twenty thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Borja, a small but pleasant city, near Mon Cayo, about thirty miles from Saragoza twards the west∣north-west, called by antient writers Belfinum, and Balsio. It is walled, and has a castle, with several convents.</P>
<P>Xaca or Jaca, an antient city at the foot of the Pyrenees, sixty miles north-east of Saragoza. It is
<PB N="286" REF="2880"/>

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of CATALONIA.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded to the south and east by the Mediterranean, to the north by the Py∣renees, and to the west by Arragon and Valentia. Its extent from west to east is about an hundred and twenty miles, and from south to north about an hundred and fifty. The air is temperate, and the soil, in general, fruitful, though mountainous, producing wine, grain, oil, pulse, wood, fruits, flax, saffron, and hemp. This province abounds also with cattle, honey, game of all sorts, salt, mar∣ble, crystal, alabaster, jasper, and amethyst: nor is it destitute of gold, silver, tin, lead, iron, alum, and vitriol, There are some plains in it extremely fruitful and delicious, and on the coast are coral fisheries. The principal rivers are the Segre, in Latin Sicoris; the Noguera Pallaresa; the No∣guera Ribagorzana; the Cervera; the Noya; the Francoli; the Llobregat, antiently called Rubri∣catus; the Besos, or Betulus; the Ter, Thicis, or
<PB N="287" REF="2890"/>
Thiceris; and the Fluvia. The Ebro also, and the Cinca, pass through some part of it. It is one of the most populous provinces in all Spain. In 1705, the whole principality declared for the archduke of Austria; but, in 1714, Barcelona, the capital, was obliged to surrender at discretion; and, soon after, the whole country was reduced, and stripped of its antient privileges. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Barcelona, which is said to have taken its name from Barcinus, the father of Hannibal, and is a large and well fortified city, situated on the Mediterra∣nean, between the rivers Llobregat and Besos, at the foot of the mountain Monjouy, on which are se∣veral forts, commanding the town and harbour. The latter of these rivers is spacious, deep, and safe, and the trade carried on by it very considerable. Here are many fair streets, houses, churches, col∣leges, hospitals, fountains, gardens, and convents; with an university; an academy of arts and sciences, founded in 1752; a court of inquisi∣tion; the court of royal audience for Catalonia, in which the governor and captain-general preside; and the see of an archishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Tarragona, and has a revenue of ten thousand ducats. The cathedral is large and mag∣nificent, There are several antiquities about the town, which shew it to have been a considerable place in the time of the Romans, when it was called Faventia. Hard by the cathedral is a church, where provisions are distributed every day to three hundred poor. Some of the Gothic kings kept their court in this city, which was afterwards sub∣ject, for a long time, to counts of its own. The territory round it is extremely fertile and delightful.</P>
<P>Tarragona, antiently called Tarcon and Tar∣raco, and the first, though now only the second city in the province. It stands near the sea, fifty miles from Barcelona, to the south-west, at the
<PB N="288" REF="2900"/>
mouth of the little river Francoli, where it has a safe and convenient harbour for small ships, and a good trade. Here is also an university, founded in 1532; with many antiquities, both within and without the town; and the see of an archbishop, who has a revenue of twenty thousand ducats. One of the chief divisions of Spain was antiently called, from this city, Tarraconensis. The cli∣mate here is so temperate, and the soil so rich and warm, that the trees bear fruit and blossoms in the middle of winter.</P>
<P>Lerida, antiently Ilerda, an antient, well built, and well fortified city, situated an hundred and five miles north-west from Barcelona, on the river Se∣gre, which, a few miles below, falls into the Ebro. Here is a citadel; a court of inquisition, with an university, founded by James II. king of Arragon; and the see of a bishop, who is subject to the arch∣bishop of Tarragona, and has a revenue of twelve thousand ducats. Here are also several monaste∣ries. The neighbouring country is very pleasant and fruitful. Under the Romans it was called Ilerda, and was a colony. In the neighbourhood Julius Caesar had a camp, where he received and defeated Afranius and Petreius, the two legates sent to him by Pompey.</P>
<P>Tortosa, a large, antient, walled city, on the Ebro, not far from the sea. Its antient name was Dertosa, of which the modern is only a corruption. Here is a bridge of boats over the river; with a strong antient castle, and other fortifications; many churches and convents; besides an university, founded in 1540; and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Saragoza, and has a revenue of fifteen thousand ducats. In the neigh∣bourhood is a rich fertile plain of great extent, with some mines, quarries of marble and jasper, and salt-pits. The city gives the title of marquis, carries
<PB N="289" REF="2910"/>
on a good trade, and has a manufacture of silk, and a pretty kind of earthen ware.</P>
<P>Cardona, a handsome town near the river Cardo∣nera, about sixty miles from Barcelona. It is well fortified; and near it is a mountain of salt, which yields a revenue of thirty thousand pieces of eight to the duke, who takes his title from the town, of which he is lord, and one of the richest grandees of Spain.</P>
<P>Palamos, a little town on a bay of the sea, near Cape Palafugel, with a good harbour. It is for∣tified, has a citadel, and gives the title of count.</P>
<P>Girona, antiently Gerunda, a considerable town in the east part of the province, about twenty-one miles from the sea, and sixty north-east of Barcelo∣na. It stands at or near the conflux of the Ter and Onhar; has strong old walls, and other forti∣fications; with a great many convents, and an uni∣versity; being also the see of a bishop, who is suf∣fragan to the archbishop of Tarragona, with a reve∣nue of three thousand ducats per annum. The neighbouring country is reckoned the most fertile in Catalonia, and the town carries on a pretty good trade, and gives the title of count.</P>
<P>Roses, a strong town, with a good harbour, on a bay of the sea. It owes its name and origin to the antient town of Rhoda, which stood a little way off, near Cape Cruz.</P>
<P>Peucerda, a large town, and the capital of the earldom of Cerdagne. It is fortified in the modern manner, and stands betwixt the rivers Carol and Segre, at the foot of the Pyrenees.</P>
<P>Urgel, antiently Orgia and Orgelium, an antient city, earldom, and bishopric, not far from the Py∣renees, on the banks of the Segre, about ninety miles north-north-east from Barcelona. It is well walled, has an antient castle, and several convents, and its territory is extremely fertile. The revenue
<PB N="290" REF="2920"/>
of its bishop, who is suffragan to Tarrogona, is nine thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Salsona, antiently Calea, standing in the heart of the province, on the river Cadonera, about sixty miles north-west from Barcelona, and near the same distance north from Tarragona. It has strong walls, with two castles, two monasteries, and an university, and is the see of a bishop, who is suf∣fragan to Tarragona, and has a revenue of four thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Balaguer, a small town on the river Segre, over which it has a bridge, nine miles north-east from Lerida.</P>
<P>Terrosio, a small place, not far from Lerida, whose air or soil is so salubrious, that mad-folks, though ever so furious, are said to be cured by them: hence, it is a common saying all over Cata∣lonia, when a person is subject to sudden starts of passion, that he must be sent to Terrosio.</P>
<P>Vique, antiently Ausonia, a small city and earl∣dom, about thirty-six miles north from Barcelona. Over the rivers Ter and Naguerra, which almost encompass it, are several bridges. In the neigh∣bouring mountains are found some amethysts, to∣pazes, emeralds, and other stones, with a little gold. Near the town are also some hot waters: hence the Romans called it Vicus Aquarius, and Aquae Vo∣coniae. There are many convents in the town, and the bishop, who is suffragan to Tarragona, has about six thousand ducats per annum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of LEON.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom took its name from its metropolis. It is bounded on the north by the Asturias, on the south by Estremadura, on the west by Galicia and Portugal, and on the east by Old-Castile; its length from north to south being about an hundred
<PB N="291" REF="2930"/>
and eighty miles, and its breadth between eighty and an hundred and twenty. It is diversified with high hills, spacious vallies, and champain plains, and produces excellent wheat, and other grain, good pasture, wine, oil, honey, and fruits. Here are also abundance of cattle, game, and fowl, mines of turquoises, quarries of marble, alabaster, and jasper, with some garnets and amethysts. There are many small rivers in the province, besides the Douro, which divides it almost into two equal parts. The dukes of Nagera are hereditary-gover∣nors of it; and the chief cities and towns, and other remarkable places, contained in it are,</P>
<P>Leon, the capital of the province, situate an hun∣dred and sixty-five miles north-west from Madrid, at the foot of the Asturian mountains. From a Roman legion settled here, in the time of Trajan, it had the name of Legio, whence its present name was formed. It stands in a pleasant country, and is well built, though after the antient manner, and contains a great many convents and chapels, with several hospitals, and one of the finest cathedrals in Spain, of which the king is always a canon, as well as the marquis of Astorga. The bishop, who is immediately subject to the pope, has a revenue of twelve thousand ducats. Thirty-seven kings of Spain, and one emperor, besides several saints, are said to be interred in the cathedral. This city was the first of any note that was retaken from the Moors, and was long the royal residence.</P>
<P>Salamanca, an antient, large, rich, and populous city, on the river Tormes, about seventy-five miles north-west from Madrid. It is said to have been founded by Teucer, the son of Telamon, who call∣ed it Salamis or Salmantica, in memory of the an∣tient Salamis. Here is an university, the greatest in Spain, and perhaps inferior to none in the world, in respect, at least, of its revenues, build∣ings, number of scholars, and masters. Here are
<PB N="292" REF="2940"/>
also many grand and magnificent palaces, squares, convents, churches, colleges, chapels, and hospitals. The bishop of this city is suffragan to the archbi∣shop of Compostella, and has a yearly revenue of fourteen thousand ducats. A Roman way leads from hence to Merida and Seville, and there is an old Roman bridge of stone over the Tormes. Of the colleges in the university, four are appropriated to young men of quality; and near it is an infir∣mary for poor sick scholars.</P>
<P>Cividad-Rodrigo, a city on the river Aquada, an hundred miles west from Madrid. It had its name from Don Rodrigo Gonzales Giron, who rebuilt it, anno 1202; and is the see of a bishop, who is suf∣fragan to the archbishop of Compostella, and has an income of ten thousand ducats per annum. It was antiently called Mirobriga, and Augustobriga.</P>
<P>Zamora, a considerable city on the banks of the Douro, an hundred and five miles north-west of Madrid. It stands in a fertile country, is well for∣tified, has a noble bridge of seventeen arches over the river, contains a great many churches and con∣vents, with several hospitals, and is the see of a bi∣shop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Com∣postella, and has a revenue of twenty thousand du∣cats. It had the name of Zamora or Medinato-Zamorati, i. e. the City of Turquoises, from the Moors, on account of the gems of that kind found in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Astorga, antiently Colonia Asturcia Augusta, a small but well fortified city, on the river Astura or Torto, about an hundred and fifty miles north-west of Madrid, and twenty-four south-west of Leon. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Compostella, and has a revenue of ten thousand ducats per annum. It is also a marquisate.</P>
<P>Toro, in Latin Taurus, a considerable city, pleasantly situated on the Douro, about an hundred
<PB N="293" REF="2950"/>
and five miles north-west from Madrid. It is said to have had its name from the stone effigy of a bull found in it, and supposed to have been made by the Romans. There is a stately stone bridge here over the river, a great many convents, several chapels, churches, and hospitals. Here the famed leges tauricae were confirmed, in a diet held by Ferdinand and Isabella.</P>
<P>Palencia, a considerable walled city, pleasantly situated on the river Carrion, antiently Nubis, an hundred and twenty miles north-and-by-west from Madrid. It was destroyed by the Romans; but rebuilt by Sancho the Great, anno 1033. Here are a great many convents, churches, and chapels, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Compostella, and has a revenue of twenty-four thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Medina del Rio Secco, or the City of the Dry River, so called to distinguish it from Medina del Campo, in the same province. It is a flourishing town, situated in a spacious fruitful plain, an hun∣dred and twenty miles north-and-by-west from Ma∣drid, contains a strong castle, with several churches, chapels, and hospitals, and is a duchy belonging to the admiral of Castile.</P>
<P>Medina del Campo, a considerable town, about seventy-two miles north-west from Madrid. Its Latin name is Methymna Campestris. It contains a great many convents and churches, with several hospitals, carries on a good trade, and has peculiar privileges, being exempted from all imposts, and bestowing all the vacant employments in the town, both civil and ecclesiastical.</P>
<P>Tordesillas, in Latin Turris Syllae, being sup∣posed to be founded by Caius Anneus, Sylla's ge∣neral, whom he sent into Spain against Sertorius. It stands on the Douro, about an hundred miles
<PB N="294" REF="2960"/>
north-north-west from Madrid, in a pleasant coun∣try.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ESTREMADURA.</HEAD>
<P>This province is bounded by that of the same name in Portugal, to the west; by New-Castile to the east; by Leon to the north; and by Andalusia to the south: extending from east to west, at most, about an hundred and ten miles, and from south to north upwards of an hundred and thirty. The soil yields abundance of grain, wine, and fruits, and rich pasturage; but good water is wanting in many places. The summers are excessively hot here. The rivers Taio and Guadiana, running through it from east to west, divide it into three parts. There are some of the finest and richest plains here not only in Spain, but perhaps in the world; being covered with the greatest variety of fruit∣trees which Europe affords, interspersed with olive∣groves, vineyards, gardens, orchards, meadows, and fields, and producing not only wheat and other grain, but flax, honey, saffron, and silk: the pastures are so luxuriant and large, that great numbers of cattle are driven from the other pro∣vinces to graze in it. Though this province is now united to New-Castile, we thought it would be proper to treat of it separately. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Merida, antiently Augusta-Emerita, so called from Augustus, the founder, who built and erect∣ed it into a colony for his old soldiers, called Emeriti; though Dio Cassius tells us, that it was built by the soldiers themselves, and called, in honour of the emperor, Augusta-Emerita. It af∣terwards made a great figure, and was the ca∣pital of the whole province of Lusitania. It stands on the Anas, now Guadiana, over which it has a
<PB N="295" REF="2970"/>
bridge, in a wholsome air and fine country, upon the frontiers of Portugal, near one hundred and thirty miles south-west from Madrid. Though now small, it is well fortified, and retains still some marks of its antient grandeur, particularly a triumphal-arch, which the inhabitants call Arco de San Jago.</P>
<P>Badajoz, now the largest city in the province, and well fortified, standing on the south side of the Guadiana, on the frontiers of Portugal, about one hundred and fifty miles south-west from Madrid, and forty west from Merida. In the Roman times it was called Pax Augusta, and Colonia Paconsis, the former of which was corrupted by the Moors to Bax-Augos, and afterwards to Badajoz. Here is a fine old Roman bridge of stone, some hand∣some streets, churches, and monasteries, and two modern castles, with the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Compostella, and has a revenue of sixteen thousand ducats.</P>
<P>Plazencia, a beautiful well-built city and bi∣shop's see, on the banks of the little river Xerte, over which it hath three bridges, about seventy miles south-west from Madrid, and one hundred and twenty south from Merida. It takes its name from the delightfulness of its situation, in the midst of that most delicious spot called La Vera de Plazencia, or the orchard of Plazencia, which is diversified with beautiful seats, villages, gardens, and groves of the finest citron, lemon, orange, and fig-trees. Here several of the antients placed the Elysian Fields, knowing of no place more agreeable; and here the emperor Charles V. having resigned all his dominions, retired into the famous monastery of St. Justus, where, after living two years a recluse, he ended his days. The bishop is subject to the archbishop of San Jago de Compo∣stella, and has a revenue of fifty thousand ducats
<PB N="296" REF="2980"/>
per annum. The city is well built and handsome, and is defended by strong walls, and a castle.</P>
<P>Alcantara, a strong town situated on the Tagus, over which it hath a magnificent bridge, built in the days of the emperor Trajan, and belonging to the knights, who take their name from it. When the Moors took it, they gave it the name of Al∣cantara, i. e. the stone bridge. Either this town or one near it, was, in the times of the Romans, called Norba Caesarea, or Colonia Norbensis. It stands one hundred and seventy miles from Madrid, to the south west, ten from the frontiers of Portugal, and forty-five, to the north, from Badajoz.</P>
<P>Truxillo, in Latin Trogillium, supposed to be the antient Turris Julia, founded by Julius Caesar, and standing one hundred and thirty miles south-west from Madrid, and thirty-six north east from Merida. It hath a good citadel, and is noted for giving birth to Don Francesco Pizarro, the con∣queror of Peru.</P>
<P>Coria, a small city, on the little river Alagon, an hundred and twenty miles from Madrid, to the south-west, and fifty-two north from Madrid. Its territory is very pleasant and fertile, and noted for the finest bread and citrons in Spain. Though but a small place, it is the see of a bishop, and a mar∣quisate, belonging to the dukes of Alba or Alva. The bishop is suffragan to St. Jago, and has an income of twenty thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Albuquerque, in Latin Alba Quercus, a con∣siderable walled town, not far from the frontiers of Portugal. It gives the title of duke, and drives a good trade in wool and woollen cloth.</P>
<P>Guadalupe, in Latin Aqua Lupia, a little town, but well built, standing on a river of the same name, in a very pleasant fruitful valley.</P>
<P>Bejar, a small town thirty miles from Plazencia. It gives the title of duke to the family of Soto∣mayor,
<PB N="297" REF="2990"/>
and is noted for a lake in its neighbour∣hood, which most certainly presages bad weather by a very unusual agitation; and for two springs, one very cold, and the other very hot, and both good for several distempers.</P>
<P>Medellin, a small town on the Guadiana, sup∣posed to be the antient Colonia Metalmensis.</P>
<P>Salamea de la Serena, another small place, an tiently called Ilipa.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of OLD-CASTILE.</HEAD>
<P>This province, in the time of the Romans, was a part of the Tarraconensis. Afterwards it was an earldom, and, anno 1034, was raised to a kingdom. The epithet of Old was given it, because it was recovered from the Moors sooner than the New. It is bounded to the south by New-Castile, to the north by Asturia and Biscay to the west by Leon, and to the east by Navarre and Arragon; its greatest extent from south to north being about an hundred miles, and from east to west, about one hundred and twenty. Though a mountain∣ous country, the plains and vallies yield excellent wine, grain, and fruits, and both mountains and vallies yield also wood, and good pasture for sheep and cattle. The wool of the sheep is said to be the finest in Spain. The air on the mountains is bleak, but in the vallies generally very hot. Some of the mountains have their tops covered with snow all the summer, which is carried to the towns, and sold to cool their wine, as is the custom all over Spain. The largest rivers here are the Douro and Ebro, into which several lesser ones fall, and the places of most note are,</P>
<P>Burgos, the capital of the province, situated on an eminence by the little river Arlancon, over which it has a good bridge, about one hundred and twenty miles from Madrid to the north. It
<PB N="298" REF="3000"/>
is a large but not a fine city, though it has some handsome squares, public buildings, and palaces. It is said to have nine months of winter, and three of hell, on account of their excessive heat. Among other convents, here is one for ladies of quality, called Las Huelgas, the revenue of which is said to be eighty thousand ducats per annum. The abbess, who is generally a lady of one of the first families in Spain, has seventeen other convents, fourteen towns, and fifty villages subject to her. She has also the disposal of twelve commanderies, and takes place of all ladies, except those of the royal family. The cathedral here is one of the noblest and richest in Spain. The archbishop has a revenue of forty thousand ducats per annum; and the king is always the first of the canons. There are a great many elegant fountains to sup∣ply the city with water, the inhabitants of which are said to be more industrious, and to carry on a greater number of trades and manufactures than is common in other great cities of Spain. The walls are antient, but strong. Among the hospitals is one for Pilgrims. On the north side on an almost inaccessible rock, stands the citadel. This city, which was built in the ninth or tenth century, on the ruins of Auca, claims the precedence of all others in the cortes or parliament of Castile.</P>
<P>Valladolid, a large, populous, walled city, pleasantly situated on the banks of the river Pi∣suerga, over which it has a stately bridge, about an hundred miles from Madrid, to the north-west, and sixty-six from Burgos, to the south. The etymon of its name is uncertain. Here is a great number of convents, hospitals, chapels, fountains, squares, colleges, and churches, with an uni∣versity, the next in dignity to that of Salamanca, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Toledo, and has a revenue of twelve
<PB N="299" REF="3010"/>
thousand ducats per annum. Here is also a fine royal palace, a geographical academy, founded not many years ago, a court of inquisition, and a high court of justice, several manufactures, and a considerable trade. The little river Escuesa runs through the city, and has a large stone-bridge over it.</P>
<P>Segovia, a very antient, and still a large, opulent, populous, and handsome city, on the river Atyada, about thirty miles south of Madrid, and sixty from Valladolid. The wealth of the city arises not only from the great number of noble families who make it their chief residence, but much more from its large commerce and manufactures, espe∣cially those of cloth and paper. A great deal of wool is also exported from hence. Here is the principal mint of Spain, in which it is said they can coin thirty thousand ducats a day; a royal palace, (in which the duke de Ripperda was confined, till he made his escape) with an university, and a bishop∣ric, the revenue of which is twenty-four thousand ducats per annum. The Roman aqueduct here is a most amazing fabric: it was built by the em∣peror Trajan, and consists of two rows of seventy-six lofty arches, carried from one mountain to another, and conveys water all over the city: notwithstanding it has stood so many centuries, it still retains its strength and beauty; so great was the art and skill of the Romans in building beyond what the following ages could boast of. This city is so industrious, that it has obtained the title of Laboriosa. The royal palace is mounted with cannon and has a garrison.</P>
<P>Avila, a considerable city, near fifty miles north-west from Madrid, having an university, and being the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of St. Jago, and has an income of

twenty thousand ducats. Here the famed St. The∣resa was born, and is held in great veneration.</P>
<P>Siguenza, antiently Seguntia, an old city, with strong walls, on the banks of the Henares, about sixty miles north-east from Madrid. Here also is an university, a stately antient castle, several fine fountains and other public edifices, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Toledo, and lord of the city, and has an income of forty thousand ducats.</P>
<P>Calahorra, in Latin Calaguris, a very antient city on the Ebro, one hundred and thirty-five miles north-east from Madrid. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Burgos, and has a revenue of twenty thousand ducats per an∣num, and is famous for the siege it antiently held out against Afranius. Pompey's general, 'till the brave citizens were forced to eat one another; whence came the proverbial expression, Fames Calagurina, or the famine of Calaguris.</P>
<P>Osma, antiently Uxama, a little old town on the river Douro, seventy-two miles north from Madrid, and sixty-six south-east from Burgos. Here is an university, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Toledo, and has an income of sixteen thousand ducats.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of NEW-CASTILE.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom or province was in the days of the Romans a part of Hispania Tarraconensis, and contained the territories of the antient Car∣pitani, Oretani, Vaccei, and other lesser tribes, and is now the first and most opulent province of Spain, as containing the capital, and being the seat of the monarchy. It is parted by ridges of moun∣tains on the north from Old - Castile; on the west from Estremadura; on the east from Va∣lentia and Arragon; and on the south from Anda∣lusia. On the south and east it is bounded also, in part, by Murcia. Its greatest length, from south to north, is two hundred miles, and from east to west, about one hundred and ninety. The air here, though very hot in summer, is healthy, and the soil generally fertile, producing abund∣ance of wheat and other grain, wine, pasture, fruit, and herbs. The province is also well stored with cattle, wild and tame fowl, and its rivers, of which the principal are the Tagus, Guadalquiver, Xucar, Xarama, Guadarama, and Guadiana, furnish it with fish. The dialect spoken here is esteemed the purest and most elegant of any in Spain. Both the Castiles are supposed to have derived their names from the antient Castellani, and these from the great number of castles which were formerly in the country. The principal places in new Castile are,</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="3040"/>
Madrid, the capital of the whole monarchy of Spain, and the residence of the court, though it never had the title of a city. It stands in the center of a large plain, surrounded with moun∣tains, and in the very heart of Spain, on the banks of the little river Manzanares, which is always very low and shallow, except when it is swelled by the melting of the snow on the mountains. The streets here are wide, straight, and handsome, and adorned with several fine fountains; the houses fair and lofty; but built of brick, with lattice-windows, excepting those of the rich, who have glass in their windows, only during the sum∣mer heats they use gauze, or some such thin stuff instead of it, to let in the fresh air. There are two stately bridges here over the Manzanares, se∣veral beautiful squares, a great many magnificent churches, convents, palaces, and hospitals: a∣mong the last is one for all nations and distempers, with a large revenue. Around the plaça-mayor, or grand square, are piazzas, with houses all uni∣form, and a continued line of balconies, for view∣ing the bull-fights and other public shews exhi∣bited in it. The royal palace, which stands on the west side of the town, on an eminence, is spa∣cious and magnificent, consisting of three courts, and commanding a fine prospect. At the east∣end of the town is the prado or pardo, which is a delightful plain, planted with regular rows of poplar trees, and watered with a great many foun∣tains, where the nobility and gentry take the air on horseback, or in their coaches, and the common people on foot, or divert themselves with a variety of sports and exercises. The compass of the whole town is computed at about nine miles, and the number of its inhabitants at about one hundred and fifty thousand. It is well supplied with pro∣visions of all kinds, at reasonable rates, and the

<HEAD>A View of the City of Hadrid.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="303" REF="3060"/>
court, with the resort and residence of the quality, and the high colleges and offices that are kept here, occasion a brisk trade and circulation of money. There are three royal academies here, one for the improvement of the Spanish language, another for history, and another for medicine. Nothing, in short, is wanting to make this place extremely com∣modious and agreeable, but cleanliness which, it seems, is not such a favourite with the inha∣bitants as it deserves. The environs are very pleasant, and contain several royal seats among which are El Buen retiro, Casa del Campo, Florida, Le Pardo, Sarsuesa, and St. Ildefonso; but the most magnificent, not only in this country, but perhaps in the whole world, is the Escurial, which takes its name from a small village, near which it stands, about twenty-two miles north-west from Madrid. It was built by Philip II. either in ho∣nour of St. Laurence, on whose festival his forces obtained the victory of St. Quintin, anno 1575, or in consequence of a vow he made to that saint, if he should gain the victory. It is a vast spacious structure, all of curious white speckled stone, with ornaments of various sorts of marble, jasper, &amp;c. It was twenty-two years in building, and has the appearance of a town, having, it is said, about eleven thousand windows, and containing, besides the royal apartments and offices, a most splendid church, in which are forty chapels, and as many altars, rich beyond imagination, a convent of Jero∣mites, a college, several hospitals or infirmaries, and a noble library, containing a large and choice collection of books in all languages and fa∣culties. Here also is the burial-place of the kings and queens of Spain, called the Pantheon, which, amidst all its riches and splendor, is an affecting monument of the vanity and transitoriness of hu∣man grandeur. In fine, it is said, that it would take up above four whole days to go through all
<PB N="304" REF="3070"/>
the rooms and apartments of this palace, which for variety of marble, jasper, and other curious stone, for paintings, sculpture, tapestry, plate, both of gold and silver, and gems, exceeds all imagina∣tion. Another royal palace greatly admired, par∣ticularly for its delicious gardens and surprising water-works, is Aranjuez, which is situated on the Tagus, about thirty miles south of Madrid.</P>
<P>Toledo, an antient, large, and well fortified city on the Tagus, about thirty-six miles to the south of Madrid. It was antiently called Toletum, and is celebrated by the Greek and other antient geographers. In later times it was the metropolis of Spain, and the residence of several Gothic, Moorish, and Christian kings. The air here is said to be exceeding healthy and serene, and pro∣visions extremely cheap and plentiful. Here are many stately edifices, squares, convents, churches, and hospitals, with three noble bridges over the river, an university founded in 1475, a court of inquisition, a royal palace, manufactures of sword∣blades, silks, and woollen stuffs, and the see of an archbishop, who is primate of all Spain, and has a revenue, one year with another, of three hundred thousand ducats. The cathedral also has a revenue of about one hundred thousand ducats, and is a stately structure, all of a beautiful white stone, enriched with sculpture. The roof of it is supported by eighty-eight stately columns, and it has eight large and beautiful gates of brass, with above thirty chapels, some of them large enough to pass for handsome churches. The church-trea∣sury is of inestimable value; eight bushels of bread are every day distributed here, and there are, in the whole, above six hundred persons belonging to the church. The jurisdiction, power, and gran∣deur of this see, is only inferior to that of Rome. Without the walls, on the north-side, are still to
<PB N="305" REF="3080"/>
be seen the ruins of a Roman amphitheatre, and under the city is a large common-sewer, which is also said to be a Roman work, and by some is ascribed to one of the Scipios. The greatest incon∣venience of this city is, that it hath no water but what is brought from the Tagus.</P>
<P>Alcala de Henares, antiently Complutum, a town on the river Henares, belonging to the arch∣bishop of Toledo, and containing an university, in the church of which cardinal Ximenes lies interred. Here the first Polyglot Bible was begun, com∣pleated, and printed, under the patronage and direction, as well as at the charge, of the prelate abovementioned, who also restored the university, in 1494.</P>
<P>Guadalaxara, a considerable town on the He∣nares, about thirty miles to the north-east of Ma∣drid. Its name is a corruption of the Moorish, or Arabic, Guadalhicara, which signifies a river of stones, for so they called the Henares.</P>
<P>Talavera la Reyna, a handsome town on the Tagus, thirty-six miles west from Toledo. It used to be a part of the dowry of the queens of Spain, whence it acquired the epithet of La Reyna. There is a manufacture of earthen ware at this place. The fortifications are in the antient taste.</P>
<P>Cuenca, antiently Concha, a considerable city, among the mountains, about eighty miles from Madrid towards the east. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Toledo, with a revenue of fifty thousand ducats.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of VALENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province was antiently, in part at least, the seat of the Hedetani, Sedetani, Contestani, and other tribes of less note. It is bounded to the south and east by the Mediterranean sea; to the north by Ar∣ragon
<PB N="306" REF="3090"/>
and Catalonia; and to the west by Murcia and New Castile, its greatest length being about two hundred miles, and its breadth about eithty. The air here is so very temperate and serene, and the soil so fruitful, that it is reckoned on both ac∣counts the finest province of Spain, abounding in wine, corn, oil, honey, flax, herbage, fruit, flowers, sugar, rice, silk, mines of gold, silver, and other metals, precious stones, alum, lime-stone, and cochi∣neal. In some places they have five crops in a year of wheat and other grain, with sugar-canes, maiz, or Indian corn, grapes, olives, and mulberry trees for silk worms. The chief rivers in this province, are the Guadalaviar, Segura, Xucar, Cabriel, Oliara, Morviedro, and Millares, all which fall into the Me∣diterranean. The province of Valentia was re∣covered from the Moors, anno 1238. It is said the king cannot raise any taxes in it without the consent of the three estates. The chief towns are,</P>
<P>Valentia, the capital, lying on the Guadalaviar, over which it has five stately bridges, about two miles from the sea, and one hundred and eighty south-east from Madrid. It is a large, beau∣tiful, populous city, having a port about a mile and a half from it, and carrying on a consi∣derable trade. Here also is an university, a tribu∣nal of inquisition, a sovereign court of judicature, and the see of an archbishop, who has a revenue of forty thousand ducats, a woollen manufacture of cloth, which is said to be the finest in all Spain: vast quantities of almonds also are exported from hence. Among other relics they pretend to have the cup made use of by our Saviour at the last sup∣per, and two of the pieces of money which Judas received from the Jewish sanhedrim for betraying his master. Almost every house here has a deep well; and there is a grand common-sewer, said to have been the work of one of the Scipios, by
<PB N="307" REF="3100"/>
which the filth of every house is carried off under ground. There are, or were formerly, several other monuments of antiquity in and about this city.</P>
<P>Segorve, or Segorbe, in Latin, Segobriga, an an∣tient, and pleasantly situated city on the banks of the Morviedro, about one hundred and fifty miles east from Madrid, thirty from the sea, and as many north from Valentia. It gives the title of duke, and is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Valentia, and has a revenue of ten thousand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Orihuela, in Latin, Orselis, the capital of a particular district, situated on the banks of the river Segura, about one hundred and ninety-four miles south-east from Madrid, and eighty south from Valentia. Its present name is thought to be a corruption of Auriolla, i. e. The Pot of Gold, as it was called by the Romans, on account of the gold mines that were formerly about it. Here is now an university, and the see of a bishop, who is suf∣fragan to Valentia, and has a revenue of ten thou∣sand ducats,</P>
<P>Alicant, a famous city and sea-port on the Me∣diterranean, about two hundred and ten miles to the south-east of Madrid, and about sixty south of Valentia. It has a commodious harbour, from whence a great quantity of delicious fruits, with excellent red and white wine, soap, and anise, is ex∣ported. It has also for its defence strong walls, a few bastions, and a castle.</P>
<P>Denia, supposed to have been called antiently Diana, from a temple dedicated to that goddess. It stands at the foot of a high hill, called Mon∣gon, about thirty-four miles north-east from Ali∣cant, on the sea-coast, where it has a convenient harbour, with a castle, and watch-tower, of an extraordinary height. It is also well fortified.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="3110"/>
Morviedro, called in Latin, Muri Veteres, from the antient walls of the famed Saguntum, still extant, a small town, situated on the same spot where that famous city stood, on the banks of the river formerly stiled Palantia, but which now bears the same name as the town. Besides the walls, which shew the circuit of the antient Saguntum, the remains of an amphitheatre and palace are still to be seen in this town, which stands at the foot of a hill, whereon is a fort, about three miles from the sea, and twelve north from Valentia.</P>
<P>La Mata, a town which carries on a great trade in salt, as having the most considerable salt-work in all Spain.</P>
<P>Elche, a handsome town near Alicant. The neighbouring country is extremely pleasant and fertile.</P>
<P>Cape Artemus in this province is the antient Ar∣temisium, by the Spaniards called Cabo de St. Martin, and Punta del Emperador.</P>
<P>Among the above towns we forgot to mention Gandia, which stands on the river Alcoy, about two miles from the sea, and about fifteen north-west of Denia. It has a castle, with an university, and gives the title of duke to the noble family of Borgia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ANDALUSIA.</HEAD>
<P>This province comprehends the three antient Moorish kingdoms of Seville, Cordova, and Jaen, and the greatest part of the Roman province called antiently Baetica. Andalusia is a corruption of Vandalenhaus, i. e. the house or abode of the Van∣dais. This name it had from the Vandals, by whom the greatest part of Spain was over-run. The province we are now to treat of, is sometimes called Lower-Andalusia, to distinguish it from the
<PB N="309" REF="3120"/>
kingdom of Granada, stiled also Upper-Andalusia. The former is bounded on the north by Estrema∣dura and New Castile; on the south by the Medi∣terranean sea, and the Streights of Gibraltar; on the west by Portugal; and on the east by Granada and Murcia. Its whole length from east to west is about two hundred and forty miles; but its great∣est breadth is not one hundred and thirty. The principal rivers are, the Guadalquiver, Olim Baetis, Tartessus, Guadiana, Guadiamar, Guada∣late, Xenil, Odier, and Tinto, or Azeche. The water of the last of these, it is said, cannot be safely drank, nor has it any fish, or other living crea∣ture in it. No province in Spain exceeds this in number of inhabitants, commodious harbours, fertility of soil, wealth, and commerce. It abounds in grain, wine, oil, oranges, citrons, raisins, al∣monds, figs, pomegranates, salt, sugar, scarlet∣berries for dying, silk, honey, quicksilver, cinna∣bar, and formerly it had rich mines of gold, silver, and base metals, which have been wholly neglected since the discovery of America. It is also noted for breeding the finest and fleetest horses in all Spain. The chief disadvantage attending it is the excessive heat in summer, so that the inhabitants generally follow their employments by night, and sleep by day.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In that part of it called the kingdom of SEVILLE, the places of most note are,</HEAD>
<P>Seville, the capital, in Latin, Hispalis, stand∣ing on the Guadalquiver, two hundred miles south∣west from Madrid, and fifty-seven from the mouth of the river. It was antiently the capital of Baeti∣ca; and from Julius Caesar, who beautified and enlarged it, it was called Julia Romula: afterwards it was the residence of several Gothic and Moorish
<PB N="301" REF="3130"/>
kings. There is a bridge of boats here over the Guadalquiver, which is navigable for large vessels forty miles from its mouth. The compass of the city walls is eight miles, and the number of its in∣habitants is computed at three hundred thousand. It contains a great number of convents, churches, squares, hospitals, with a mint, which can coin seven hundred marks, each containing eight ounces of gold or silver, in a day; an exchange, which is said to have cost a million of dollars; a royal palace, now going to decay; a custom house, to which so many officers belong, that their salaries are said to amount to fifty-four thousand ducats per annum; an university, founded in the year 1504; and a cathedral, the largest and finest in all Spain, and, as some will have it, in the whole world, next to that of St. Peter's at Rome: five hundred masses are said every day in it. On the top of the high tower is the statue of a woman, which turns with the wind like a weather-cock. The archbishop has an income of one hundred thousand ducats. Here are a great number of secular and ecclesiastical courts, particularly a court of inquisition. This city carries on a great trade, and has many manu∣factures, particularly of silk and silver stuffs, earthen∣ware, soap, and salt; but they have declined greatly for twenty or thirty years past. All along the river are a great many commodious keys, near which is also a stately tower, called the Golden Tower, which entirely commands the river, city, and suburbs. The royal court, for the regulation of every thing relating to the West India trade and company, was removed from hence to Cadiz in the year 1717, which was an irreparable loss to the city. Near it is a fine wood of olives, full of de∣lightful shady walks. It is said, there are no less than four thousand officers belonging to the inqui∣sition at this place. The adjacent country is very
<PB N="311" REF="3140"/>
fruitful and pleasant, and particularly noted for fine oranges. The greatest inconvenience to which the city is exposed, is the overflowing of the river, which sometimes makes dreadful havock. There is a Moorish aqueduct in the neighbourhood worth seeing.</P>
<P>Cadiz, one of the antient and most celebrated cities in Spain, well known under the different names of Erythrea, Aphrodisia, Tartessus, Con∣tinusa, Gadir, Gades, and Gadeira, to the Phoe∣nicians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Phocians and other Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans. It is supposed to have been built by the Tyrians, as well as the famous temple of Hercules, which an∣tiently stood here. It stands on an island, which is separated from the continent by a narrow canal or arm of the sea, over which there is a bridge, well fortified, on the Atlantic ocean, being about three hundred miles to the south-west of Madrid, eighty from Seville to the south-west, and fifty-eight from Gibraltar. The island is about sixteen or seventeen miles long, and about six in breadth, producing little grain, but some good wine and pasture. The city is fortified after the modern manner, and its spacious harbour and bay are de∣fended by several forts. The number of the in∣habitants is computed at forty thousand. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Seville, and has a revenue of twelve thousand ducats per annum. Many of the houses are stately, and a few of the streets broad, streight, and well paved. Provisions and house-rent are pretty dear. A great deal of salt is made, and fish caught about the island. Among the fish are tunnies, which are sometimes ten feet in length. This city is the centre of the American commerce, all the goods from Holland, England, Italy, France, and Spain, being shipped off from hence in Spanish bottoms,
<PB N="312" REF="3150"/>
and under the names of Spanish factors. Were the duties on foreign merchandize sent hither duly paid, the gains of the owners would be far short of what they now are. There is a prodigious resort of strangers hither, about the time that the flota usu∣ally arrives from America. What are called the pillars of Hercules here, are only two ordinary round towers, which were probably at first only windmills. The approach to the island is dangerous in most places, on account of rocks and sands. Near it is another small island, now called St. Pe∣dro, but antiently Herculeum, from the famous temple of Hercules that stood in it.</P>
<P>Gibraltar, a famed and well known port, at the mouth of the Streights, which take their name from it, about three hundred and twenty miles south-west from Madrid; eighty south from Se∣ville; and fifty-eight south-east from Cadiz. It is so well fortified that it is looked upon as impreg∣nable, and, since the treaty of Utrecht, has been in the possession of the English, who keep a strong garrison in it, with all the artillery and stores ne∣cessary for its defence. The inhabitants, who are a mixture of Europeans, Jews, Turks, and Moors, carry on a very considerable trade, and even traffic clandestinely with Spain. The harbour is well fortified. To the west of it is a bay, on the other side of which is the famed mount Calpe, directly opposite to Ceuta and the hill formerly called Abyla in Africa: these two hills are justly sup∣posed to be the true pillars of Hercules. The name of Gibraltar is thought to be a corruption of the Arabic Gebel or Gibel Tarif, i. e. the mount of Tarif, the name of a Moorish general who landed here with auxiliaries from Africa. On the peninsula formed by the above mentioned bay on the west, and the Mediterranean on the east, close to Gibralter, and on the side next Spain, is a
<PB N="313" REF="3160"/>
high steep rock, defended by bulwarks and towers. The breadth of the streights is about eleven miles.</P>
<P>Traigueros, a large handsome town, about thirty miles to the north of Palos.</P>
<P>San Lucar de Barameda, in Latin Luxdubia, Phosphorus Sacer, and Luciferi Fanum, or the temple of the morning-star, so called from a tem∣ple of Venus, that antiently stood here, is a hand∣some town and harbour at the mouth of the Gua∣dalquiver, forty-five miles below Seville. It has been upon the decline since the Spanish West-India fleets were allowed to set out from, and re∣turn to Cadiz. Its principal trade is in salt.</P>
<P>Port St. Mary's, a large town with a flourish∣ing trade, at the mouth of the river Guadalete, on the other side the bay of Cadiz. It is walled round, has a small castle and good harbour, makes and exports great quantities of salt, and is the ca∣pital of an earldom belonging to the duke of Me∣dina Celi, and much resorted to by English, Dutch, French, and Genoese merchants.</P>
<P>Palos, a little town with a tolerable harbour, at the mouth of the Trino, about thirty miles north of St. Lucar. From hence Christopher Colum∣bus, in the year 1492, set out on the discovery of America.</P>
<P>Xeres de la Frontera, a large and pretty well built town on the little river Guadaletta, about six miles from the sea, and fifty south of Seville. The horses bred here are reckoned among the best in all Spain. Near this town was fought, in the year 714, the famous battle between the Goths and Moors, which occasioned the loss of Spain to the former. Its territory is said to yield yearly a∣bout sixty thousand pipes of sherry, which takes its name from the town.</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="3170"/>
Alcantara, a small town between Seville and St. Lucar. Here is a Roman bridge built over the morasses, well worth seeing.</P>
<P>Medina Sidonia, antiently Asindum and Asido∣nia, a neat and pretty large town, twenty seven miles eastward from Cadiz. It belongs to the noble family of Guzman, to whom it gives the title of duke. The Moors added the word Me∣dina, which signifies a city, to Asidonia, which was in time shortened to Sidonia</P>
<P>Ossuna, a pretty large town, which has an university, and gives the title of duke, but is ill provided with water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In the second division of this province, called the kingdom of CORDOVA, the places of most note are,</HEAD>
<P>Cordova, the capital, antiently an opulent Ro∣man colony, called Corduba, and Colonia Patricia, and celebrated for being the birth-place of the two famed Senecas, the poet Lucan, Averroes, the learned Arabian physician Hesius, who presided at the council of Nice, and other learned men. It is a large and beautiful city on the river Guadal∣quiver, about one hundred and twenty miles south from Madrid, and seventy north-east from Seville. Here is a noble bridge of seventeen arches over the Guadalquiver, a magnificent cathedral, built by the Moors for a mosque, the roof of which is sup∣ported by three hundred and sixty-five stately pil∣lars of alabaster, jasper, and black marble; a stately episcopal, and royal palace; a house for the inquisition, some curious fountains, and many other grand public and private edifices, especially convents and hospitals. The bishop of this city is suffragan to the archbishop of Toledo, and has an income of forty thousand ducats. It stands at
<PB N="315" REF="3180"/>
the foot of a ridge of mountains, in which, in the times of the Romans, were rich gold-mines, that were wrought. Corn-fields, gardens, vine∣yards, plantations of lemons, oranges, figs, and olives, which when in blossom diffuse a fragrancy all over the country, render its environs extremely delightful. Here is a great trade, with several manufactures, particularly of silk, wool, and curious gilt leather. Here also are bred the fleet∣est, most beautiful, and most mettlesome horses in Spain; and the king, it is said, has a stud here of five hundred fine mares. The city-walls are of stone, strong and lofty, and the suburbs have the appearance of so many towns.</P>
<P>Andujar, a considerable town on the Guadal∣quiver, about an hundred and fifty miles south from Madrid. Not far from it stood the town an∣tiently called Illurgis, or Illiturgis, and Forum Julium. Here is a castle, and a bridge over the Guadalquiver. The adjacent country produces a great deal of corn, wine, oil, silk, and fruits of all sorts.</P>
<P>Lucena, supposed to be the antient Luceria, a considerable city, about two miles from the sea, and forty-five miles south-west from Seville. It stands in a very pleasant fruitful country.</P>

is suffragan to Toledo, and has a yearly revenue of twenty thousand ducats, contains a great many convents, churches, and hospitals, some of which are very fine, and is defended by a castle. St. Veronica is the great object of devotion here.</P>
<P>Ubeda, the Ubea, or Vetala of the Romans, a small city, one hundred and fifty miles south from Madrid, and fifty-seven north from Granada. It has a castle and walls, stands in a fruitful country, and enjoys some particular privileges.</P>
<P>Baeza, antiently Vatia, Beathia, and Beatia, a considerable city, three miles from the Guadal∣quiver, and about fifteen south-west from Ubeda. It is noted for dying the finest scarlet, and mak∣ing the richest taffatas, and has an university, founded in 1533.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of GRANADA.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, which, as we observed before, is sometimes called Upper Andalusia, is bounded to the south and east by the Mediterranean; to the west and north by Lower Andalusia; and to the north-east by Murcia. Its extent from west to east is two hundred and ten miles; but its greatest breadth exceeds not eighty. The air here is temperate and healthy, and though there are many mountains in the province, and some of them very high, yet they are almost every where co∣vered with vines, and fruit-trees, together with laurel, myrtle, sweet-basil, thyme, lavender, marjoram, and other aromatic herbs, which give an exquisite taste to the flesh of their sheep and cattle. A great deal of silk and sugar, flax and hemp, honey and wax, is also produced here, besides dates and acorns, superior to the finest nuts, good stone for building, several sorts of gems, sumach, used in dressing goat-skins, and galls, of which a dye is made for leather. The valleys, with which the mountains are interspersed, are extremely
<PB N="317" REF="3240"/>
beautiful and fertile. The inhabitants of some of the highest mountains are said to be descendants of the Moors; and, though they are become Ro∣man catholics, retain, in a great measure, their an∣tient customs, manners, and language. The prin∣cipal rivers in the province are the Xenil and Gua∣dalantin, besides which there are many lesser streams. Abundance of salt is made in this province, which, though neither so populous nor so well cultivated as when subject to the Moors, yet is as much so as any in Spain. It was the last of the kingdoms pos∣sessed by the Moors, and was not reduced and an∣nexed to the crown of Castile until 1492. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Granada, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital, standing at the conflux of the Xenil and Dar∣ro, in a wholesome air and fruitful country, an hun∣dred and eighty miles south of Madrid. It is large and magnificent, containing a great number of very handsome public and private buildings. Its walls, which are adorned with many towers at equal distances, are said to be ten miles in compass. Here are two castles; the one built by the Moors, and the other by Charles V. and Philip II. They both command a very fine prospect; and the first is so large, that it looks like a city by it∣self, and, it is said, has room enough to accommo∣date forty thousand people, exclusive of the royal palace, and the convent of St. Francis. Here is also a court of inquisition; a royal tribunal; and an university, founded in 1531; with the see of an archbishop, who has a revenue of forty thousand ducats per annum. A great many noblemen, cler∣gymen, and wealthy citizens, reside in this city, of which the silk trade and manufacture is very great, and the arsenal is said to be the best furnished of any in Spain. The inhabitants, who are partly de∣scended of the Moors, are well supplied with water. There are several fine squares, particularly that
<PB N="318" REF="3250"/>
called the Bivarambla or Plaça Mayor, where the bull-fights are held; and without the city is a large plain, full of towns and villages, called La Vega de Granada.</P>
<P>Malaga, an antient, large, well built, well forti∣fied, and populous city, with a fine harbour on the Mediterranean, two hundred and sixty miles south of Madrid, and seventy-five south-west from Gra∣nada. The city is encompassed with a double wall, and defended by two castles. So great is the exportation of wines, raisins, almonds, figs, le∣mons, oranges, and other fruits, from hence, be∣sides wool and oil, that the duties on them are said to yield to the king eight hundred thousand ducats per annum. The harbour runs up into the town five hundred and thirty common paces, with a good breadth, and four stairs to take water at, and twenty four pillars of jasper stone to fasten the ships to. The city is supposed to have been founded by the Phoenicians. The bishop is subject to the arch∣bishop of Seville, and has a revenue of twenty thou∣sand ducats per annum.</P>
<P>Almeria, a small city on the Mediterranean, with a safe and commodious harbour, two hundred and ten miles south-east from Madrid, and sixty-four south east from Granada. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to Granada, and has a revenue of four thousand ducats.</P>
<P>Antiquera, a pretty large and handsome town, with a castle, seventy miles south-west from Gra∣nada. It is supposed to be the Singilium of Pliny, and the Antiquaria of the Itinerary. Near the city is a famed salt-pit, which supplies the whole terri∣tory with that commodity; with a spring, that is said to be an excellent lithontriptic; a parcel of rocks, called El Torcal, which at a distance repre∣sent men, beasts, buildings, &amp;c. and some caverns,
<PB N="319" REF="3260"/>
where, in the times of the Romans, great quanti∣ties of gold are said to have been dug.</P>
<P>Alhama, a pretty town, situated twenty-eight miles south-east from Granada, and celebrated for its warm baths, which are said to be an excellent cure for rheumatic, and other pains in the limbs.</P>
<P>Guadix, formerly Acci, and Colonia Accitana, a pretty large town, twenty-four miles east from Granada, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Granada, and has a revenue of eight thousand ducats.</P>
<P>Guescar or Huesca, antiently Calicula, a small town and marquisate belonging to the duke of Al∣ba, and lying betwixt the rivers Guadadar and Dra∣vate, thirty-six miles north of Almeria. It has a good trade in wool.</P>
<P>The other towns worth mentioning in this pro∣vince are Ronda, Velez-Malaga, Loxa, Sta Fé, and Baza.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The KINGDOM of MURCIA.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom takes its name from the capi∣tal, and was antiently a part of the Tarraconen∣sis, inhabited chiefly by the Contestani and the Bastitani, and containing the Campus Spartarius, situated on the Sinus Illiritanus, now the gulph of Carthage. It was not entirely recovered from the Moors till the year 1266. It borders to the north on New-Castile, by which and Andalusia it is also bounded to the west; to the north-east it has Va∣lentia; to the south the Mediterranean sea; and to the south-west Granada. Its greatest length from north to south is about an hundred miles, and its breadth about ninety. Though moun∣tainous, it produces some corn, and great quanti∣ties of fine fruits, particularly oranges and lemons,
<PB N="320" REF="3270"/>
together with honey, silk, sugar, rice, peas, oil, and pasture. The air, though somewhat of the hot∣test, is pure and healthy. The principal river is the Sigura, antiently called Terebus, Straberum, and Sorabis; and the places of most note are,</P>
<P>Murcia, from which the province takes its name, situated in a spacious and delightful plain, on the river Segura, about two hundred miles south-east from Madrid, and about twenty north from Car∣thagena. This city is large and populous, having a great many convents, churches, squares, and gates, with a good wall, a court of inquisition, a stately palace, and a castle. The adjacent country abounds in mulberry trees, olives, sugar-canes, and fine fruits. The city hath often suffered by the inundations of the Segura.</P>
<P>Carthagena, a noted sea-port on the Mediterra∣nean, at the mouth of the river Guadalantin, not far from Cape Palos, an hundred and eighty miles south-south-east from Madrid, and forty-two south∣west from Murcia. It is said to have been built by Asdrubal, the Carthaginian general, 225 years before Christ, and called Carthago-Nova or New-Carthage. The air here is temperate in summer; and so mild in winter, that the roses blow as fair and fresh at Christmas, as in England at June. Under the Romans and Carthaginians, this was one of the most flourishing cities in all Spain; for, from hence they shipped off those vast quantities of gold and silver, which they dug in the Pyrenees, and other mountains. Both city and harbour are well fortified. The bay on which it stands a∣bounds in fish, especially mackarel; and the neigh∣bouring country affords diamonds, rubies, ame∣thysts, garnets, agates, and mines of alum. The city is pretty large, and its harbour one of the best in Spain. The bishop is suffragan to the archbi∣shop
<PB N="321" REF="3280"/>
of Toledo, and has a revenue of twenty-four thousand ducats. A great deal of wool is shipped off from hence.</P>
<P>Lorca, a considerable town on the Guadalantin, forty-two miles south-west from Murcia. It was antiently called Eliocrata and Ilorci, of the latter of which its present name is a corruption.</P>
<P>Almacaron, a little sea-port, at the mouth of the Guadalantin. Here also are some mines of alum.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the ISLANDS on the COAST of SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>The principal of these are Majorca, Minorca, Ivica, Fermentora, and Cabrora, in the Mediterra∣nean. The two first were antiently called Baleares and Balearides, i. e. the Islands of the Slingers, the inhabitants being then expert slingers, as the Mi∣norcans are at present. The Greeks called them also gymnasia, on account of the inhabitants going naked. These, with the other lesser isles about them, composed once a kingdom, called the king∣dom of Majorca, which was by degrees recovered from the Moors, and annexed to the kingdom of Ar∣ragon. They all now belong to the crown of Spain, except Minorca, which is held by the English.</P>
<P>Malorca, or, as we pronounce it, Majorca, is the largest, being about sixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, and the nearest to the Spanish coast, being only about an hundred miles from Barcelona. It abounds in corn. wine, oil, honey, saffron, large and small cattle, fish, rabbits, deer, horses, and wild fowl, especially partridges; but there are no wild beasts in it. There are four capes in the island, viz. Pedra on the east side, Gros∣ser on the west, Salinas on the south, and Fer∣mentor on the north. There are watch-towers all round it; and towards the north and west it is
<PB N="322" REF="3290"/>
mountainous, but has several good harbours, with plenty of water. The air is wholesome, but very hot and dry in summer. A considerable body of horse and foot is kept here for the defence of the island. The language of the better sort is Spanish; but that of the common people is a med∣ley of Spanish, Latin, Greek, and Arabic. The principal place in it is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Majorca, antiently Palma, which stands on the south-west side of the island, on a bay betwixt two capes, and is a large and well fortified town, the residence of the viceroy, the seat of a court of inquisition and other courts, and also of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Valentia, and has a revenue of twenty thousand ducats per annum. Here likewise is an university, a stately cathedral, a great many churches, seve∣ral hospitals, handsome streets, and squares. Of the last there is one called Born, where the bull∣fights and other shews are exhibited. The in∣habitants are computed at ten thousand. The other places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Calobra, Porto Pedro, and Paguira, fine har∣bours; Cividad Alcudia, a considerable town; and Pollença, having a good harbour, and noted for an excellent wine called montona.</P>
<P>Minorca lies thirty-three miles east-north-east of Majorca. Its greatest length from east to west is thirty-eight miles, and its breadth fifteen. The air is moist, but never excessive cold or hot. Here are lead-mines, plenty of fish, salt, fine marble, rabbits, sheep, honey, wax, capers, oil, cotton, wine, some of which is excellent, fine acorns, opuntia, palm-trees, which however bear no fruit, myrtles, with a vast variety of petrified
<PB N="323" REF="3300"/>
shells, and a great deal of cattle. The water is said to be none of the best. The inhabitants, like the Spaniards, are too proud and lazy to cultivate the ground in a proper manner, and consequently have but little corn. They are com∣puted at about twenty-seven thousand, have a natural turn to poetry, love music and dancing, and, like their ancestors, are expert slingers. In 1756, the French got possession of this island; the English garrison in Fort St. Philip's not having been duly supplied, reinforced, and supported, through the cowardice or treachery of admiral Byng, who was sent to its relief. The only places in the island worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Citadella, the capital, lying on the west coast, where the governor resides. It is a small place, but well fortified, and chiefly inhabited by the English.</P>
<P>Port Mahon, one of the finest harbours in Eu∣rope, (both for its capaciousness, and security from wind and enemies) being four miles long, and above half a mile in breadth. The town is small, but has a brisk trade. Near it is St. Philip's castle, a square fort of four bastions, which has always a good garrison. This fort, with the town and har∣bour, lie at the south-east end of the island.</P>
<P>The French were obliged to restore the island to the English at the conclusion of the war.</P>
<P>The islands of Ivica and Fermentora were called Pythyusae by the Greeks, from the vast quantities of pines they produced. The former separately was called Ebusus, and the other Ophiusa and Col∣lubraria. They lie about thirty-six miles west of Cape St. Martin, on the coast of Spain. The for∣mer is about forty miles long, and twenty-two broad, and very mountainous, but not unfruit∣ful,
<PB N="224" REF="3310"/>
where it is cultivated. Its principal commo∣dities are dried figs and salt. It is said, no veno∣mous creature will live in it. The principal place is Ivica, antiently Ebusus, whence the island takes its name, a small town, but the residence of the governor, who is subordinate to the viceroy of Majorca; and it has a fort and harbour, being situated on the south coast of the island. Fermen∣tora, the other Pythyusa, lies about six miles south of Ivica. It is small, and at present uninhabited. Cabrera, the last of these islands we mentioned, had its name from the multitude of goats found in it. It lies on the south side of Majorca, and its on∣ly inhabitants are exiles, and a small garrison, in a castle, to defend the entrance of a spacious harbour.</P>

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>ITALY.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>NAME, EXTENT, and BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE antient names of this country were Hes∣peria, Saturnia, Ausonia, Oenotria, Cani∣cula, and Latium; but these were at first appro∣priated to particular districts. The present name is by some derived from Italus, an antient king of Scicily, who came with a colony, and settled in this country. Others derive it from the Greek word Italos, signifying an ox, because it formerly bred those animals in great numbers, and of an ex∣traordinary size; but the most probable derivation is from Etolia, a country of Greece, which lies opposite to this, Etolia and Italia differing little in the sound. The Germans call it Walschland, which, though it signifies literally theland or country of strangers, or foreigners, is now restrained to Italy. The south part of Italy, or the kingdom of Naples, was
<PB N="326" REF="3330"/>
antiently called Magna Grecia. Italy lies between the 7th and 10th degrees of east longitude, and be∣tween the 37th and 46th degrees of north latitude. On the north, north-west, and north-east, it is bounded by France, Switzerland, the country of the Grisons, and Germany; on the east by the Adriatic, or Gulph of Venice; and on the south and west by the Mediterranean; its figure being not unlike that of a boot. Its length from Aosta, at the foot of the Alps in Savoy, to the utmost verge of Calabria, is computed at about six hundred miles; but its breadth is very unequal, being in some places near four hundred miles, but so nar∣row in others, as not to exceed twenty-five or thirty miles.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and MEMORABLE EVENTS.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to its original inhabitants, the most probable conjecture is, that the posterity of Gomer, the son of Japhet, and grandson of Noah, came soon after the dispersion into Europe, and peopled the greater part of it, especially the southern coun∣tries, namely, Greece, Gaul, Italy, and Spain. The nations, which in antient authors are said to have made the first settlements in Italy, were the Umbri, the Ausones, the Opici, the Osci, the Siculi, the Tusci, the Ligures, and the Veneti; afterwards the Celtes of Gaul, and the Greeks, possessed them∣selves of a great part of the country. In those early ages, when the Romans first began to ex∣tend their territories, Italy, like most other coun∣tries, was parcelled out into a great number of small states, who were all gradually subdued by the Romans. Upon the declension of the Roman empire, the Huns, Goths, Vandals, Heruli, and other northern nations, passed the Alps, and seized on the greatest part of it. After them came the Lom∣bards,
<PB N="327" REF="3340"/>
or Longbeards, and erected a kingdom in the northern part of it, which was overturned by Charlemagne, who founded a new empire in the west. Of the history of Italy since that period little need be said, since it is generally well known. The empe∣rors, residing in Germany, divided Italy into several governments, the governors whereof at length as∣sumed sovereign power, the popes inciting, aiding, and supporting them, in order to weaken the em∣perors, and thereby to increase their own power, and render themselves independent. Thus a great many small principalities and states were erected, which, however, still professed to acknowlege the emperor their head; and many of them procured grants from the emperors, to confirm their respective titles, which they generally purchased with sums of money. The popes too, for a considerable time, acknowleged that they held their territories of the emperor; but at last, impatient of all appearance of subjection and dependence, by exciting insurrections, embroiling the emperors affairs in Germany and Italy, and other indirect unwarrantable me∣thods, they not only rendered themselves indepen∣dent, but assumed an authority to judge of their actions, as well as those of other princes; and, in consequence of that, to absolve their subjects from their allegiance, and transfer their dominions to others.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, and LAKES.</HEAD>
<P>The principal mountains in Italy are the Alps and Apennines. The former extend from the river Var, near Nice, to the Adriatic. Some branches of them are called the Maritime, others the Cot∣tian, others the Greek, others the Rhetian, others the Peninian, and others the Noric and Carnician Alps. The Apennines run the whole length of
<PB N="328" REF="3350"/>
Italy from the north-west to the south-east. The rivers of most note are the Po, in Latin, Padus, which rises in Piedmont, and falls into the Adri∣atic; the Adige, in Latin, Athesis, which rises in Tyrol, and falls into the Adriatic; the Arno, which rises in the Apennines, and falls into the Tuscan sea near Pisa; the Tyber, which has its source in the Apennines, passes by Rome, and falls into the Tuscan sea at Ostia. The smaller rivers are the Adda, the Tesino, the Oglio, the Mincio, the Tanaro, the Trebia, the Carigliano, antiently Liris, the Voltorno, the Brenta, and several others still less. The chief lakes are the Lago Magiore, di Como, di Garda, di Parugia, di Fundi, di Tarni, di Lugano, di Vulsino, di Celano, d'Iseo, di Bracciano, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Italy is very different, according to the different situations of the several countries con∣tained in it. In those on the north of the Apen∣nines it is more temperate, but in those on the south generally very warm. The air of the Campania of Rome, and of the Ferrarese, is said to be un∣healthful, which is owing to the lands not being duly cultivated, nor the marshes drained. That of the other parts is generally pure, dry, and healthy. In summer the heat is very great in the kingdom of Naples, and would be almost intole∣rable, if it was not somewhat alleviated by the sea∣breezes. The soil of Italy in general is very fer∣tile, being watered by a great number of rivers. It produces a great variety of wines, and the best oil in Europe, excellent silk in abundance, corn of all sorts, but not in such plenty as in some other countries, oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, almonds, raisins, sugar, mulberry-trees without number, figs, peaches, nectarines, apricots, pears,
<PB N="329" REF="3360"/>
apples, filberts, chesnuts, &amp;c. Most of these fruits were at first imported by the Romans from Asia Minor, Greece, Africa, and Syria, and were not the natural products of the soil. The tender plants are covered in winter on the north-side of the Apennines, but on the south-side they have no need of it. This country also yields good pasture, and abounds with cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, wild boars, mules, and horses. The forests are well stored with game, and the mountains yield not only mines of iron, lead, alum, sulphur, mar∣ble of all sorts, alabaster, jasper, porphyry, &amp;c. but also gold and silver, with a great variety of a∣romatic herbs, trees, shrubs, and ever-greens, as thyme, lavender, laurel, and bays, wild olive-trees, tamarinds, juniper, oaks, and pines. Italy, tho' a country so rich and beautiful, that it is stiled the garden of Europe, is, however, not without many and great inconveniences, which we shall take no∣tice of in the more particular description of it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the Italian language, it is the old Latin, blended and corrupted with the jargons of the northern nations that over-ran this country, af∣ter the declension of the Roman empire; but hath been so polished, refined, and improved since, that it is now esteemed very elegant, soft, smooth, and harmonious, and consequently very fit for music and poetry. In proportion, however, to the smoothness it hath acquired, it hath lost its strength, force, and energy. It is said to be spoken in the greatest purity in Tuscany. The predominant re∣ligion is the Roman catholic: no protestant sect is tolerated, excepting at Leghorn; but Greeks and Jews are found in several places. At Leghorn, Jews, Greeks, and Mahometans, have an entire liberty,
<PB N="330" REF="3370"/>
and the English factory have a chapel. There is no country in Europe, of the same extent, where there is such a number of archbishoprics, bishoprics, universities, and abbies, as in this. The power of the pope, however, and of the priests, is daily losing ground, even in this country, the seat of that spiritual empire, upon which the Roman catholic states are making continual encroachments, rapidly resuming those rights and possessions, of which priest-craft, and the blind zeal and superstition of former ages, had deprived them.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>A very extensive trade is carried on in many places in Italy, particularly at Leghorn, Genoa, Bologna, Venice, and Naples; the country having a great variety of commodities and manufactures for exportation, especially wine, oil, perfumes, fruits, and silks. Travellers also bring large sums of money into Italy, besides what they lay out in pictures, curiosities, relics, antiquities, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PERSONS, CHARACTER, DRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the persons of the Italians, they are generally well proportioned, though their com∣plexions are none of the best. As to dress, they gene∣rally follow the fashions of the countries on which they border, or to which they are subject, namely, those of France, Spain, and Germany. With respect to their genius and taste in architecture, paint∣ing, carving, and music, they are thought to excel greatly, and to leave the other nations of Europe far behind them; but their music seems too soft and effeminate to deserve all the praise bestowed on it; and their houses are far inferior to those of Eng∣land, in respect of convenience. No country
<PB N="331" REF="3380"/>
hath produced better politicians, historians, poets, painters, and sculptors, we mean since the revival of the arts and sciences, exclusive of those of an∣tient times. The Italians are very affable, courte∣ous, ingenious, sober, and ready witted; but ex∣tremely jealous, vindictive, lascivious, ceremoni∣ous, and superstitious. In respect to jealousy, in∣deed, we are told, that a very extraordinary change hath lately taken place; and that the Italians are now no less indulgent and complaisant to their wives, than the most polite husbands in France itself. In their tempers, the Italians seem to be a good medium between the French and Spa∣niards, neither so gay and volatile as the one, nor so grave and solemn as the other. Boiled snails, served up with oil and pepper, or fried in oil, and the hinder parts of frogs, are reckoned dainty dishes. Kites, jackdaws, hawks, and magpies, are also eaten, not only by the common people, but the better sort. Wine is drank here both in summer and winter cool∣ed by ice or snow. The women affect yellow hair, as the Roman ladies and courtesans formerly did. They also use paint and washes, both for their hands and faces. The day here is reckoned from sun-set to sun-set, as the Athenians did of old.</P>
<P>Having said thus much of Italy in general, we shall now proceed to give an account of the several states into which it is divided, beginning with those of the king of Sardinia on the north, after we have premised a few remarks in regard to his power, forces, revenues, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The kings of Sardinia are said to be descended from Figuardo, who was king of Saxony about the middle of the seventh century. Until the year 1713, they were only dukes of Savoy; but then Victor Amadeus II. assumed the title of king of
<PB N="332" REF="3390"/>
Sicily, which he had obtained at the peace made that year. In the year 1718, however, he was obliged to accept of Sardinia in lieu of Sicily; upon which he took the title of king of Sardinia.</P>
<P>The first of this family, who took the title of duke of Savoy, was Amadeus VIII. in the year 1397. The king of Sardina is now ranked among the greatest princes of Italy: he is absolute in tempo∣rals, and has as much power, as any catholic prince whatsoever, in spirituals; for all ecclesiasti∣cal preferments are at his disposal, and the inqui∣sition at Turin can lay no one under arrest, with∣out first acquainting the council. All civil causes also, even such wherein ecclesiastics are plaintiffs or defendants, are tried before the temporal judges. Mr. Keysler says, it would be difficult to find a place where arbitrary power is carried to a greater height than at Turin. The king, as a member of the Germanic body, has a seat in their diets, among the princes of the circle of the Upper Rhine, and contributes his quota to the general taxes of the empire; but he is not subject to its laws and constitutions; only he receives the in∣vestiture of such territories as he enjoys in the Montferrat and Milanese from the emperor. The principal colleges or boards at Turin, are the privy∣council, the council of Sardinia, and the council of state.</P>
<P>As to the royal revenue, nothing certain can be affirmed, only it is said to exceed that of his Britannic majesty, as elector of Brunswick Lune∣burg. Some, indeed, have computed it at five hundred thousand pound sterling per annum; but, without doubt, it greatly exceeds that sum now. That of Sardinia, however, in particular, is hardly equal, it is said, to the charges of the government. The chief branches of the revenue are the crown∣lands, the duties on silk, rice, hemp, and cards.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="3400"/>
The taxes, in general, are said to be screwed up to the highest pitch, and levied with the most inflexible severity; and as the king's power is greater and more unlimited in civil affairs, than that of any mo∣narch in Europe, and as great in ecclesiastical, as that of any other of the Roman catholic powers, he may augment or diminish them just as he pleases.</P>
<P>With regard to the king's forces, they amount commonly, in time of peace, to about fifteen thou∣sand men, besides the militia, horse-guards, and the train of artillery. There are several regiments of foreigners, especially Germans, in his service; and many of his towns are strongly fortified and garisoned.</P>
<P>The principal order of knighthood in this prince's dominions, is that of the Annunciada, which was instituted by Amadeus VI. in 1562. The knights wear a gold collar, on each link of which are engraved these letters, F. E. R. T. which some read, Fortitudo ejus Rhodum tenuit; al∣ledging, that they allude to Amadeus V's. re∣lieving the island of Rhodes, then besieged by the Turks; but they were part of the arms of Savoy long before that event. The number of knights are fourteen, besides the duke, who is sovereign of the order. They have all the title of excel∣lency. The only other order is that of St. Mau∣rice. Every knight of the Annunciada must pre∣viously be of this order, and ranks according to the date of his admission into it.</P>
<P>The king of Sardinia's dominions on the conti∣nent, consist of the duchy of Savoy, the principality of Piedmont, the duchy of Montferrat, and a part of the duchy of Milan, of which in order.</P>

<P>This country was antiently inhabited by the Celtes, whose descendants therein were subdivided into the Allobroges, Nantuates, Veragri, Seduni, Salassi, Centrones, Garocelli, and some others of inferior note. Of all these the Allobroges were the most considerable. The reduction of these tribes, in which Julius Caesar had made a great progress, was compleated under Augustus. Af∣terwards this country shared the fate of the rest of the western empire, and was over-run by the northern Barbarians. The Burgundians held it a considerable time: but when, or how it first became a distinct earldom under the present family, is what historians are not agreed about; thus much however is certain, that Amadaeus I. who lived in the twelfth century, was count of it. In 1416, Ama∣daeus VIII. was created, by the emperor Sigismund, duke of Savoy, and Victor Amadaeus II. as we observed above, first took the tittle of king of Sicily, and afterwards of Sardinia. The present king is Charles Emanuel III. who is far advanced in years: the heir-apparent to the crown has the title of duke of Savoy, and prince of Piedmont. Savoy is bounded to the south by France and Piedmont; to the north by the lake of Geneva, which separates it from Switzerland; to the west by France; and to the east by Piedmont, the Milanese, and Switzerland: its greatest length being about eighty-eight miles, and breadth a∣bout seventy-six.</P>
<P>As it lies among the Alps, it is full of lofty mountains, which in general are very barren:
<PB N="335" REF="3420"/>
many of the highest of them are perpetually co∣vered with ice and snow. The summit of those, called Montagnes-Maudites, the cursed moun∣tains, are said to be more than two English miles in perpendicular height above the level of the lake of Geneva, and that level itself is much higher than the Mediterranean. In some few of the vallies there is corn-land and pasture, and a good breed of cattle and mules, and along the lake of Geneva, and in two or three other places, a tolerable wine is produced. Mount Senis or Cenis, between Sa∣voy and Piedmont, over which the high-way from Geneva to Turin lies, is as high, if not higher, than the Mantagnes-Maudites; but of all the moun∣tains of the Alps, the highest is mount Roche∣melon, in Piedmont, between Fertiere and No∣valese. The roads over these mountains are very tedious, disagreeable, and dangerous, especially as huge masses of snow, called by the Italians ava∣lanches, and fragments of rocks, frequently roll down into them from the impending precipices. The way of travelling is either in sledges, chairs, or on the backs of mules: in some places the path on the brink of the precepices is so narrow, that there is but just room for a single person to pass. It be∣gins to snow on these mountains commonly about the beginning of October. In summer, in the months of July, August, and September, many of them yield very fine grass, with a great variety of flowers and herbs; and others box-wood, walnuts, chesnuts, and pines. The height and different combinations of these mountains, their towering summits rising above one another, and covered with snow, the many cataracts, or falls of water, the noise and rapidity of the river Arc, the froth and green tincture of its water, the echoes, the numerous streams tumbling from cliff to cliff, form altogether a very romantic scene. These
<PB N="336" REF="3430"/>
mountainous tracts, notwithstanding their height, are not altogether free from thunder in summer, and are also much exposed to thick clouds, which sometimes settle unexpectedly on them, and con∣tinue several days. There are some wolves among the thickets, and they abound with hares, rupi∣capras, or chamois, and marmottes: the last of these, called in Latin muresalpini, burrow under ground, and sleep eight or nine months in the year, five, six, and sometimes more, in one burrow. In the lower parts of Savoy, there are also bears, wild-boars, deer, and rabbits; and among the desolate moun∣tains are found great quantities of rock-crystal. In the glacieres or ice-vallies, between the high mountains, the air is extremely cold, even in the months of July and August. The surface of these ice-valleys looks like a sea or lake, which after having been agitated by fierce and contiary winds, has been frozen all at once, interspersed with hide∣ous cracks and chasms. The noise of these cracks, when first made by the heat of the noon-day sun, and reverberated by the surrounding rocks and mountains, is astonishing. The height of the impending mountains is such, that the sun's rays seldom reach the ice-vallies, except a few hours in the middle of summer. The avalanches, or snow∣balls, which the least concussion of the air will occasion, tumble down the mountains with amaz∣ing rapidity, continually increasing, and carrying all before them. People have been taken out alive, after being buried several days under them.</P>
<P>The chief rivers are the Rhone, which, on the side of Geneva, separates Savoy from France; the Arve, which has some particles of gold in its sands; the Isere, the Seran, the Siers, and the Arc. There are also a great many lakes in this country, which yield plenty of fish, but none of them are very large, together with medicinal and reciprocating springs, and hot baths.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="3440"/>
The language of the common people is a cor∣rupt French; but the better sort, and those that live in the great cities, speak as good French as they do in Paris itself.</P>
<P>In their temper, however, and disposition, the Savoyards resemble the Germans more than the French, retaining still much of the old German honesty, and simplicity of manners, which, no doubt, is partly owing to the poverty and barren∣ness of the country. To this also, joined to their longevity, and the fruitfulness of their women, which are the effects of their cheerful disposition, healthy air, activity, temperance, and sobriety, it is owing, that great numbers of them are obliged to go abroad in quest of a livelihood, which they earn, those at least, who have no trades, by shew∣ing marmottes, cleaning shoes, sweeping chim∣nies, and the like. It is said, that there are ge∣nerally about eighteen thousand of them, young and old, about Paris. In summer they lie in the streets, and in winter forty, fifty, or sixty of them lodge together in a room: they are so ho∣nest, that they may be trusted to any amount. The children are often carried abroad in bas∣kets, before they are able to walk. In many vil∣lages in Savoy there is hardly a man to be seen throughout the year, excepting a month or two. Those that have families generally set out and re∣turn about the same season, when their wives com∣monly lie-in, and they never fail to bring home some part of their small earnings. Some of them are such consummate masters of oeconomy, that they set up shops, and make fortunes, and others return home with a competency for the rest of their days. An old man is often dispatched with letters, little presents, and some money, from the younger sort, to their parents and relations, and brings back with him fresh colonies, letters, mes∣sages,
<PB N="338" REF="3450"/>
and news. The cultivation of their grounds, and the reaping and gathering in of the harvest and vintage, are generally left to the women and chil∣dren; but all this is to be understood of the moun∣tainous parts of Savoy. Great numbers of the mountaineers of both sexes are said to be lame and deformed, and they are much subject to a kind of wens, which grow about their throats, and very much disfigure them, especially the women; but that is the only inconvenience they feel from them.</P>
<P>The nobility of Savoy, and the other dominions of the kng of Sardinia labour under great hard∣sharps and restrictions, unheard of in other coun∣tries, which we have not room here to particu∣larize. A minute account of them will be found in Mr. Keysler's Travels. In short, the king has left neither liberty power, nor much property, to any but himself, and the clergy, whose overgrown wealth he has also greatly curtailed.</P>
<P>No other religion is professed or tolerated in Savoy, but that of the church of Rome. The decrees, however, of the council of Trent are not admitted; nor are the churches asylums for malefactors.</P>
<P>This duchy is divided into those of Chablais, Genevois, and Savoy proper, the counties of Ta∣rantaise and Maurienne, and the barony of Faucigny, and contains the following places of note.</P>
<P>Chamberry, the capital of the duchy, and for∣merly the residence of the counts, situated on the river Leise, in a pleasant valley in Savoy proper, twenty-seven miles north-east of Grenoble, forty∣four south of Geneva, fifty-five west of Lyons, ninety north-west from Turin, and two hundred and seventy south-east of Paris. It is walled, and the seat of the high court of Savoy, but not very large, nor of any great antiquity. Here are se∣veral
<PB N="339" REF="3460"/>
handsome squares, a great many monasteries, a stately ducal palace or castle, several palaces of the nobility, and a collegiate church, the head of which is stiled dean of Savoy; but the town has lost much of its antient splendor, since the dukes removed their residence to Turin. In the market∣place is a fountain, where four dogs spout water out of their mouths.</P>
<P>Aix, in Latin Aquae Gratianae, and Augusta Allobrogum, a town about two leagues from Chamberry. The name Aix, of this and other towns, some derive from Augusta, and some from Aqua; but the latter derivation is more likely, most of the towns of that name being noted for hot or medicinal waters. As to the epithet of Gratianae, it had that from the emperor Gratian, who rebuilt and beautified it. The hot baths here are free to all, paying only the attendant or rub∣ber a trifle: the water of them is clear, and of a greenish colour: no fish or any animal will live in them. Here are some remains of a Roman triumphal arch.</P>
<P>Montmelian, a small town on the Isere, near the frontiers of Dauphiné, seven miles south-east of Chamberry. It was formerly very strong; but its fortifications have been demolished.</P>
<P>Thonon, the capital of the duchy of Chablais, situated on the lake of Geneva, about twenty miles from the city of that name. It is a handsome town, but not large, and contains several convents.</P>
<P>Ripaille, a small town at a little distance from Thonon. Here is a convent of Carthusians, who have a large forest cut into walks, some of which terminate on the lake, and on the other side have a near prospect of the Alps. This convent was the retreat of one of the dukes of Savoy, who, after a glorious reign, took on him the habit of a hermit, the house then belonging to the hermits
<PB N="340" REF="3470"/>
of St. Maurice. He was afterwards chosen pope by the council of Basil, in opposition to Eugenio IV. but, nine years afterwards, resigned his title into the hands of pope Nicholas V. on very honourable conditions. His luxurious manner of living, in his retreat, is said to have given rise to the pro∣verbs, and are a Repaglia, and faire Repaille, which signify, to live jovially.</P>
<P>Annecy, the capital of the duchy of Genevois, situated near the lake of its name, about twenty-three miles north of Chamberry. It hath been the residence of the bishop of Geneva ever since the reformation. The river Sier here issues from the lake, and passes through the town, which is ex∣tremely agreeable, both on account of the many elegant prospects that it affords, and the good company to be met with in it.</P>
<P>Les Echelles, a small town on the river Guier le Vif. Near it is a paved road made by duke Charles Emanuel II. and, for a considerable way, hewn through the rocks.</P>
<P>Monstier or Moustier, in Latin Monasterium, the capital of the Tarantaise, on the river Isere, twenty-eight miles from Chamberry. It is the see of an archbishop, and was antiently called Claudii-Forum, and Monasterium Centronum.</P>
<P>St. Jean de Maurienne, the capital of the county of Maurienne, and the see of a bishop. Near it is a lofty stone-bridge, over a little valley.</P>
<P>Lasnesburg, a large village at the foot of the high mountain Senis. The sun is never seen from this village from the end of November, until near the end of January.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of PIEDMONT.</HEAD>
<P>Piedmont is a part of the antient Lombardy, and owes its present name to its situation at the foot of
<PB N="341" REF="3480"/>
the Alps. By the Romans it was called Gallia Cisal∣pina, to distinguish it from Gallia Transalpina. It is bounded to the south by the Mediterranean, and the territory of Genoa; to the north by the duchy of Aos∣ta, and a part of the Milanese; to the east by the duchies of Montferrat and Milan; and to the west by France; extending from south to north about an hundred and fifty miles, and from east to west, where broadest, about ninety-four. The river Po divides it into two parts; of which that next Rome was antiently called Gallia Cispadana, and the other Transpadana. It is a very fruitful country, espe∣cially the lower parts of it, yielding plenty of corn and wine, and a great variety of fruits, particu∣larly filberts and chesnuts. Here are also great numbers of mulberry trees, with hemp, flax, saf∣fron, truffles, good store of cattle, and some me∣tals. The finest spot in the king's dominions is that between Turin and Coni, which, it is said, can hardly be equalled any where, and no where exceeded. Many of the country people of Pied∣mont earn betwixt sixty and seventy dollars a-year, by digging only for truffles. The breeding and fattening of cattle turn to great account here; the profits annually arising therefrom being said to amount to near three millions of livres per annum. The Piedmontese silk is reckoned the finest and strongest in Italy; the cultivation of it must there∣fore be a very profitable article to the inhabitants. The fine sells for about a louis d'or per pound, and the coarser, not wound off the cocoons, for about twenty or twenty five sols. Of the moun∣tains in Piedmont, the highest are Rochemelon, mentioned before, and Viso. It takes a whole day to go to the top of the former, whence, in clear weather, there is a most extensive prospect. Every year, on the fifth of August, a vast crowd of peo∣ple assemble on the top of it, where there is a sta∣tue
<PB N="342" REF="3490"/>
of the Virgin, before which mass is said: even then, the cold and frost is very intense during the night. The report of a musket fired on it is no louder than that produced by the breaking of a stick. Hannibal is supposed to have marched over the other mountain, in his way to Italy. The other rivers in Piedmont, besides the Po, mentioned a∣bove, are the Sesia, Tenaro, and Doria Baltea, which fall into the Po; and the Var, which falls into the Mediterranean. The language of the country is a mixture of French and Italian: but many of the better sort speak both these languages equally well. With respect to the character of the Piedmontese, they are said to be very lively, shrewd, and artful, and very capable of distin∣guishing themselves in the sciences, if their genius had full scope given it; but no heretical books, as they are called, that is, such as might open their eyes to see the pious frauds of the priests, are allowed to be brought into the coun∣try: however, neither Jesuits, nor any other regu∣lars, are suffered to keep schools publicly. Some villages bordering on Dauphiné are inhabited by the Waldenses, whose tenets, in many points, differ∣ing from those of the church of Rome: have of∣ten exposed them to the fury and persecution of the bigotted papists. On some of the mountains here, not only the inhabitants, but even their horses, dogs, and other animals, are subject to those wens about their throats, which we observed in the Valais, the country of the Grisons, and Savoy. The most considerable towns in this principality are,</P>
<P>Turin, antiently Augusta Taurinorum, the ca∣pital, situated at the conflux of the Po and Doria, very populous, and strongly fortified, but not large. The number of the inhabitants is said to be about sixty thousand. To walk round the ram∣parts, which are exceeding pleasant, and command
<PB N="343" REF="3500"/>
an enchanting prospect, takes about an hour and an half. That it is very strong is evident from the long siege which it sustained in the beginning of this cen∣tury; and, no doubt, the fortifications are greatly improved since. Within the city are forty-eight churches and convents, and some very fine streets, particularly the Rüe Neuve, and the Rüe de Po. The celebrated architect Bernini was of opinion, that there was not a street in Italy comparable to the first of these; though others think the Rüe de Po is nothing inferior to it. There are also some fine squares, and a great many beautiful palaces, besides that of the king, together with a magnifi∣cent opera-house, an arsenal, a royal printing-house, and the university, which is a quadrangle, and one of the finest buildings in the city. The king's pa∣lace, for the beauty of its apartments, the richness of the furniture, the elegant paintings, cabinets of curiosities, and library, is scarce to be paralleled. The chapel of the Holy Sudary, built of blackish marble, is particularly admired: they tell us, that this holy sudary is the very linen cloth in which the body of our Saviour was wrapped up in the se∣pulchre. The city consists of the Old and New. In the old, the streets are crooked and narrow, but have some handsome houses in them, and, both in the Old and New, are exceeding clean and neat. From a canal cut from the river Doria, water is conveyed, by an aqueduct, into the city, and after∣wards distributed, at pleasure, through every street. Here is a fine citadel, and a great many charitable foundations. The university-library, besides printed books, has a very valuable collection of manu∣scripts, in several languages, among which are Pyrrhus Ligorius's Designs of Greek and Roman Antiquities, in thirty volumes, highly esteemed. The Jesuits college and church are very beauti∣ful. What chiefly detracts from the beauty of
<PB N="344" REF="3510"/>
the houses here, is the great number of pa∣per windows. The other defects and inconve∣niencies of this city are its thick moist air in autumn and winter, the foul muddy water in its wells and reservoirs, and the inns, where the ac∣commodations are said to be very bad, and the impo∣sitions intolerable. Another thing extremely disa∣greeable, and even dangerous, when a person dies of any contagious distemper, is the carrying the corpse through the streets, and burying it without any coffin. In the neighbourhood of Tu∣rin are many beautiful villas, convents, and other buildings. Of the villas, those belonging to the royal family are Valentine, now neglected; La Vigne de la Reine; La Venerie, having a very fine chapel and gardens, with a little town near it; Montcalier; Rivoli; and Stupinice. About five leagues from Turin stands the magnificent church and foundation of Superga, on a high mountain, whence, in 1706, the king and prince Eugene reconnoitred the French trenches and camp, and where the former made a vow of this foundation, in case he should defeat the enemy. The revenue of the foundation is eighteen thousand Piedmontese livres in specie, by which a prior, with twelve young ecclesiastics of good families, are maintain∣ed, and the latter qualified for the highest prefer∣ments in the church. Turin is forty-seven miles north-west from Genoa, eighty south-west from Milan, an hundred and seven south-east from Ge∣neva, and three hundred north-west from Rome.</P>
<P>Coni, a strong town, thirty-four miles south of Turin, at the conflux of the Stura and Gesso. It hath often withstood the efforts of the French arms; and was never taken but once, anno 1641.</P>
<P>Fossano, a small town on the river Stura, twenty-seven miles south of Turin. It is the see of a bi∣shop, under the archbishop of Turin.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="3520"/>
Carignano, a small but strong town on the Po, over which it hath a stately bridge, about ten miles south of Turin. It gives the title of prince to a collateral branch of the house of Savoy.</P>
<P>Mondovi, in Latin, Mons Regalis and Mons Vici, a considerable town, thirty-five miles south∣east from Turin. It is the see of a bishop, subject to the archbishop of Turin, has a castle, and is well fortified.</P>
<P>Savigliano, a town between the rivers Weira and Grana, about twenty-five miles south of Turin. Its fortifications were destroyed by the French in 1706.</P>
<P>Cherafco, a small but strong town on the Stura, about twenty-four miles south-east of Turin.</P>
<P>Chieri, a small but well built town, about three miles east of Cherasco.</P>
<P>Susa, formerly Segusium, a small town on the Doria, about three or four miles from the confines of Dauphiné, and about thirty-one north-west from Turin. Here are to be seen the remains of a tri∣umphal arch, erected, in honour of Augustus Cae∣sar, by king Cottius, from whom the Alpes Cottiae took their name. Though this place is defended only by a wall, it has always a strong garrison. At about half a quarter of a league from it stands Fort Brunette, which perhaps cannot be paralleled in the whole world, having been hewn out of a rock, with all its out-works. The passages in the rock are so large, that waggons and heavy cannon, drawn by several horses, may go from one place to another. Susa gives name to a marquisate, in which lies a part of Mount Senis, with Novalese and Fertiere, two small places, standing on the high∣way leading to Turin, and the side of the moun∣tain next that city.</P>
<P>Saluzzo, formerly Augusta Vagiennorum, situ∣ated at the foot of the Alps, twenty-four miles south
<PB N="346" REF="3530"/>
of Turin. It is the see of a bishop, who is imme∣diately under the pope; and gives name to a mar∣quisate, which duke Charles Emanuel got from the French, in 1601, in exchange for Bresse and Bu∣gey. In this marquisate are also Carmagnole and Demont, two strong places; the former fifteen miles south of Turin.</P>
<P>Nice, a small sea-port on the Mediterranean, at the mouth of the Paulon, almost seventy miles south of Turin, near as many south-west from Genoa, and about ten from Antibes, on the frontiers of France. The fortifications were entirely destroyed by the French, in 1708. It has an indifferent har∣bour, is a free port, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Ambrun, in Dau∣phiné. Nice is said to have been built by a colony of Massilians, out of the ruins of the antient Co∣menelium, the capital of the Vediantii, who were never totally subdued until the reign of Augustus. It gives name to a district, called the county of Nice, in which is also Villa França, a small fortified town, two or three miles to the east of Nice, with a har∣bour on the sea, and two castles; and Capo de S'Ospitio, a very strong town on the sea, and a free port.</P>
<P>Oneglia, a sea-port on the Mediterranean, about thirty-three miles north-east of Nice, and thirty-seven south-west of Genoa. It gives name to a principality, is well fortified, and has a good trade in oil.</P>
<P>Asti, a large walled town, situated not far from the Tanaro, in a delightful valley, twenty-four miles east from Turin. It gives name to a county, in which is also Ceva, a fortified town, with a castle, and the title of a marquisate.</P>
<P>Aosta, in the time of the Romans called Au∣gusta Salassionum, and Augusta Praetoriana, a city on the river Doria-Baltea, fifty miles north of Tu∣rin.
<PB N="347" REF="3540"/>
Its present name is a corruption of its antient. Here are several remains of Roman antiquities, and the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Monstiers, in the Tarantaise. An∣selm, archbishop of Canterbury, is said to have been born here.</P>
<P>Vercelli, a pretty large town, near the river Se∣sia, forty-four miles north-east of Turin. The citadel and all its works were demolished by the French, in 1704. It is the see of a bishop, who is under the archbishop of Milan, and the capital of a lordship bordering on the Milanese. A great deal of Turky wheat is sown in these parts; the husks of which are used for fuel, the stalks for mending the road, and the meal or flour for bread.</P>
<P>Ivrea, formerly Eporedia, a strong city on the river Doria, over which it hath a stately stone bridge, thirty-one miles north of Turin. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Tu∣rin, and gives name to a marquisate, of which it is the capital.</P>
<P>Spigno, a small town, not far from Acqui. It gives name to a marquisate which was an imperial fief, but purchased, in 1734, by the duke of Sa∣voy.</P>
<P>Le Laugh was a fief held immediately of the empire until 1736, when it was ceded to the king of Sardinia.</P>
<P>In Piedmont, contiguous to Dauphiné in France, are several vallies, which in general are very fruit∣ful, yielding corn, wine, good pasture, chesnuts, mulberries, and other fruits, with a great variety of plants and herbs, and large woods and thickets, which abound with hares that are white all the year, foxes, large pheasants, brown and white partridges, wolves, and bears. On the higher parts of the mountains, that surround these vallies, are found the
<PB N="348" REF="3550"/>
marmottes, which are larger than rabbits, of a brown colour, mixed with red, and their flesh tastes like pork. They pass all the cold months in a profound sleep. The bouquetin, which is an ani∣mal very like a chamois, keeps constantly on the snowy tops of the highest mountains. To recover a person benumbed with cold, or deprived of the use of a limb, they give a few drops of this ani∣mal's blood, in a glass of warm wine or broth, which throws him into a profuse sweat. Among the tame animals is the tumar, engendered between a bull and a mare, or a bull and a she-ass. The for∣mer are called buff, and the latter biff. The head and tail in both resemble those of an ox; but the former, instead of horns, has only small knobs: in all other respects, they are shaped either like an horse or an ass. They are less than a mule, but exceeding strong and swift, easily kept, and conse∣quently fit for travellers. There are many rare plants found among these mountains; some of which are reckoned great restoratives, as the lunaria. There is a sort of thistle, somewhat resembling an artichoke, which is eaten, and reckoned good a∣gainst infection. The number of people in these vallies amount to about seven thousand, of which six thousand are Waldenses or Valdenses, or Vau∣dois, as they are called in French, who are famous in history for their opposition to popery, long before the Reformation; and for the many persecutions they have undergone. For some time past, they have not been much molested, though a Roman catholic church hath been built in every parish; and at Turin there is an hospital, called Maison des Vaudois, where all the Waldenses, especially chil∣dren, who voluntarily embrace the Roman catholic religion, are furnished with every thing necessary. The girls, when arrived at a proper age, have por∣tions given them; and the boys are put to some me∣chanic
<PB N="349" REF="3560"/>
trade, in order to enable them to acquire a comfortable subsistence. If the papists made use of no other methods than these, or such as these, to gain proselytes, they could not be blamed. The chief of these vallies are those of Lucerne, Perouse, St. Martin, Pragela, and Angrogne. In Lucerne there are few or no Waldenses. In Pe∣rouse is the small town or fortress from which it takes its name, and the town of Pignerol. St. Martin takes its name from a place at present quite demolished. In the valley of Pragela is Fenes∣trelle, a fortification on the river Cluson. The valley of Barcelonetta was ceded to France, in lieu of Fort Dauphin, taken by the Spaniards, in 1744. Some of the vallies on the west side of the Alps are included in the provinces of Dauphiné and Provence.</P>
<P>Masserano, a strong town near the confines of Milan, twenty miles north of Vercelli. It is the capital of, and gives name to, a principality, which has princes of its own, who hold it of the pope.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of MONTFERRAT.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the south by the re∣public of Genoa; to the west and north by Pied∣mont; and to the east by Milan. It is reckoned about sixty-two miles in length, and forty-eight in breadth. Both its hills and plains are extremely fertile, abounding with corn, wine, and fruits of all forts. It formerly belonged to the dukes of Mo∣dena; but a part of it was transferred to the duke of Savoy, in 1631, and the rest, in 1703. On one side it is watered by the Tanaro, and on the other by the Po. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Casal, the capital, on the river Po, forty-two miles east of Turin, and almost as many west of Milan. This town was once so well fortified, as
<PB N="350" REF="3570"/>
well as its citadel, that it was reckoned one of the strongest in Italy. In 1474, it was erected into a bishopric, suffragan to Milan.</P>
<P>Trino, a strong well-built town, fortified after the modern manner, and situated eight miles north∣west of Casal.</P>
<P>Acqui, a fortified town, twelve miles north of Genoa. It was called by the Romans Aquae Sta∣tellae, which name was given it on account of some hot mineral waters in its neighbourhood, much re∣sorted to for many distempers. Acqui is evidently a corruption of Aquae.</P>
<P>Alba, surnamed Pompeia, and celebrated by Ptolomy and other antients, as one of the chief cities of old Liguria. It is now a strong fortified town on the river Tanaro, twenty-two miles south∣east from Turin.</P>
<P>Nizza della Paglia, a small town, about nine miles from Acqui, which is well fortified, and the see of a bishop. The other towns worth men∣tioning in the duchy, are Verua, Crescentino, and St. Salvatore.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of MILAN.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Milan is one of the finest pro∣vinces in Italy. It is bounded on the south by the Apennine mountains, and the territory of Ge∣noa; on the north by Switzerland; on the east by the Venetian territories, and the duchies of Mantua, Parma, and Placentia; and on the west by Savoy, Piedmont, and Montferrat; extending from north to south about an hundred miles, and, from east to west about one hundred and eight. It is well watered by the Tessino, the Sesia, the Ad∣da, the Po, the Oglio, the Lombro, Serio, &amp;c. and also by several canals and lakes. Of the latter the Lago-Maggiore is between thirty and
<PB N="351" REF="3580"/>
forty miles in length, and in some places six or seven miles broad. In it lie the Baromean islands, as they are called, viz. Isola Bella and Isola Madre, the beauty of which almost exceeds ima∣gination: art and nature seem to have vied with one another in embellishing them. In each of them is a palace with delicious gardens, belonging to the Baromean family. The water of the lake is clear and of a greenish colour, and abounds with fish. The hills, with which it is surrounded, present a most charming landskip, being planted with vines, and chesnut-trees, interspersed with summer-houses. There is a canal running from it towards Switzerland, with which the city of Milan has a communication. It was antiently called Lacus Verbanus. The Lago de Como, which was called by the Latin poets, Lacus Larius, but has its modern name from the city, near which it lies, extends itself about thirty miles northward from Como, but its greatest breadth is not above five miles. From the Lago-Maggiore issues the Tessino; and from that of Como, the Adda. Of the other lakes, that of Lugano and Guarda are the chief: that of Guarda was antiently called Benacus.</P>
<P>The trade and manufactures of this duchy con∣sist principally in silks, stuffs, stockings, gloves, and handkerchiefs, linen and woollen cloth, hardware, curious works of crystal, agate, hya∣cinths, and other gems; but their exports are usually far short of their imports.</P>
<P>As to the revenue of the duchy, it must, with∣out doubt, be very considerable. It is said to have amounted to two millions of dollars, while the duchy was in the hands of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>About the year 1525, the emperor Charles V. expelled the French from this duchy, and gave it, together with Spain, to his son Philip II. It re∣mained
<PB N="352" REF="3590"/>
subject to that crown till 1706, when the Austrians got possession of it; but, in 1734, the Spaniards and French recovered it. By a subse∣quent peace, however, it was restored to the em∣peror, on his ceding Naples and Sicily to Spain, and the Austrians have remained ever since in pos∣session of it, excepting those parts of it, that have been ceded to the king of Sardinia. The bounda∣ries between the dominions of the king, and those of the empress queen, pass along from the fron∣tiers of Switzerland, through the Lago-maggiore, to the river Tessino, and along that river to its junc∣tion with the Po. In 1753, the duke of Modena was appointed governor-general of Milan and the duchy of Mantua, till the young archduke Leo∣pold should be of a proper age to govern.</P>
<P>With regard to the coin of the duchy, twenty soldi make a lira, which is worth about eight∣pence sterling: seven liras and ten soldi are equal to a filippo: twenty-four liras, and between three and four soldi, make a Spanish pistole: twenty-four liras an Italian pistole: thirteen liras, sixteen soldi, a ducat in gold: eight liras, a ducatoon of Milan, Venice, or Florence, or a silver crown: eight liras, ten soldi, a zechin in gold.</P>
<P>In the year 1767, the Austrian government of Milan published a law, by which all the rights, which the pope or the bishops had had till then exercised over ecclesiastics, either with regard to their effects or persons, is transferred to a council, established for that purpose at Milan. By the same edict, all ecclesiastics were obliged to sell the estates which they had become possessed of since the year 1722; and no subject, whether ecclesiastic or se∣cular, was to go to Rome to sollicit any favour, except letters of indulgence, without the consent of the said council.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="3600"/>
In our more particular description of the duchy of Milan, we shall begin with the districts belonging to the king of Sardinia, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Alessandria, surnamed De la Paglia, from the inhabitants using stubble for fuel instead of wood. It had the name of Alessandria from pope Alex∣ander III. in honour of whom it was built, anno 1178, stands upon the Tanaro, is well forti∣fied, and contains about twelve thousand inhabi∣tants. Here is a fine opera house, two annual fairs in the months of April and October, and the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Milan. This town also gives name to, and is the capital of a district, ceded to the duke of Savoy in 1703.</P>
<P>Valenza, a strong town on the Po, about twelve miles south-east of Casal, and the most considera∣ble in the territory of Lomellina, which took its name from Lomellio, now a village.</P>
<P>Vigevano, a pretty strong town on the river Tessino, and the see of a bishop, under the arch∣bishop of Milan. It stands twenty miles south∣west of Milan, and gives name to the district call∣ed Vegevenasco.</P>
<P>Novara, a well built and pretty well fortified town, standing about nineteen miles west from Milan. It is the see of a bishop, who is subject to the archbishop of Milan, and gives name to a di∣strict called the Novarese.</P>
<P>Borgo di Sesia, a small place, but the capital of a district called Val di Sesia, i. e. the valley watered by the Sesia. The town stands about twelve miles west of the Lago-Maggiore.</P>
<P>Arona, a small town, with a strong fort, on the Lago-Maggiore. It is the capital of the coun∣ty of Anghiera, of which the king of Sardi∣nia possesses all that part which lies to the west
<PB N="354" REF="3610"/>
of the lake. Near it, on an eminence, is a gi∣gantic brasen statue of St. Charles Baromeo, the chief saint of the Milanese.</P>
<P>Tertona, at present an inconsiderable place, but the capital of a district, called the Tortonese. It stands thirty-seven miles south-west from Milan.</P>
<P>Bobio, a small town on the Trebia, about thirty miles north-east of Milan. It is the capital of a district, and the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>Besides the above towns and districts, the lord∣ships of S. Fedele, Torre di Forti, Gravedo, and Campo-Maggiore, together with a part of the Pa∣vese, or district of Pavia, belong to the king. In the last is a small town, called Voghera.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>In that part of the MILANESE belonging to the house of AUSTRIA, the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Milan, the capital of the whole duchy, in Latin, Mediolanum. It is a very large city, and has a wall and rampart round it, with a citadel, yet is thought to be incapable of making any great re∣sistance. The gardens within the city take up a great deal of ground. In the citadel is a foundery for cannon, and an arsenal, furnished with arms for twelve thousand men. The governor of it is quite independent of the governor-general of the Milanese, who resides in the city, in a large, but old, and ill contrived palace. The yearly income of the governor of Milan is said to be two hun∣dred thousand guilders. The council belonging to the city is composed of a president and sixty doc∣tors of law, who are all nobles, and independent of the governor-general. Milan hath experienced a great variety of fortune, having been subject sometimes to the French, sometimes to the Spa∣niards, and sometimes to the Germans. A great number of persons of rank and fortune live in it,
<PB N="355" REF="3620"/>
especially during the winter. The ladies in France are not allowed more liberty than those of this city: even the austerities of the monastic life are so far mitigated here, that gentlemen have not only the liberty of talking with the nuns, and of rallying and laughing at the grate, but also of joining with them in concerts of music, and of spending whole afternoons in their company. The place where the beau-monde take the air, either in their coaches, or on foot, is the rampart betwixt the Porta Ori∣entale, and the Porta Tosa, where it is strait and broad, and extremely pleasant, being planted with white mulberry trees, and commanding a prospect, on one side, of the open country, and on the other, of the gardens and vineyards between the ramparts and the city. Milan, which is said to have been built by the Gauls, about two hundred years after the foun∣dation of Rome, contains a great number of state∣ly edifices, as churches, convents, palaces, and hospitals. The cathedral is a vast pile, all of mar∣ble; and though something has been doing for near four hundred years towards the outward or in∣ward ornament thereof, it is not yet finished. Of the great number of statues about it, that of St. Bartholomew, just stead alive, with his skin hang∣ing over his shoulders, and of Adam and Eve, over the main portal, are the finest. The pillars supporting the roof of the church are all of marble, and the windows finely painted. This church con∣tains a treasure of great value, particularly a shrine of rock chrystal, in which the body of St. Charles Boromeo is deposited. The other churches most worthy a stranger's notice, are those of St. Alex∣ander, St. Jerom, St. Giovanni di Casarotti della Passione, that of the Jesuits, and of St. Ambrose, in which lie the bodies of the saint, and of the kings Pepin and Bernard. In the Ambrosian col∣lege, founded by Frederic Boromaeo, sixteen pro∣fessors
<PB N="356" REF="3630"/>
teach gratis. In the same college is also an academy of painting, with a musaeum, and a li∣brary, containing a vast number of printed books and manuscripts; among the last of which is a translation of Josephus's History of the Jews, done by Ruffinus, about twelve hundred years ago, and written on the bark of a tree; St. Ambrose's works on vellum, finely illuminated; the orations of Gregory Nazianzen, and the works of Virgil, in folio, with Petrarch's notes. In the musaeum are Leonardi da Vinci's mathematical and mechanical drawings, in twelve large volumes. The seminary for sciences, the college of the nobles, the Helve∣tian college, and the mathematical academy, are noble foundations, and stately buildings. Of the hospitals, the most remarkable are the Lazaretto, and that called the great hospital; the latter of which receives sick persons, foundlings, and lu∣natics, and has six smaller hospitals depending on it, with a revenue of one hundred thousand rix∣dollars. The number of the inhabitants of this city is said to be about two hundred and fifty thou∣sand. It has been forty times besieged, taken twenty times, and four times almost intirely de∣molished; yet it hath always recovered itself. It is said that gunpowder is sold here only by one per∣son, and in one place: the court of inquisition is held in the Dominican convent, near the church of Madonna della Gratia: the houses of entertain∣ment, and the ordinaries here, are represented as very indifferent. Mr. Keysler says, it is not unu∣sual for young travellers, when they go to any of the taverns in Milan, to be asked, whether they chuse a letto fornito, or female-bedfellow, who continues masked till she enters the bed-chamber. Deformed dwarfs, and people with wens, some of them of a prodigious size, are very common in the streets of Milan. The wens are said to be heredi∣tary.
<PB N="357" REF="3640"/>
The common method of burying here, is to throw the corpses into vaults, without coffins, to the amount of two or three hundred, which can∣not fail to fill the air in these places with noxious effluvia. Mr. Keysler tells us, that when he was at Milan, goods of any kind might have been brought into the city without search or enquiry, provided a small gratuity was given to the officer. Milan is far short of Turin, both in beauty and conveniency, many of the streets being crooked and narrow, and paper windows much more frequent than in that city; even in grand palaces, the windows are often composed promiscuously of glass and paper. It is not uncommon here for beggars, when they ask alms, to hold out to you a dish, in which is a human skull. Two large canals extend from hence, the one to the Tessino, and the other to the Adda; the Tessino having a communication with the Lago Maggiore, and, by a canal, with the Sesia; and the Adda issuing from the Lago di Como, and having a communication by canals with the Lam∣bro and Serio. In a void space in one of the streets of Milan, where stood the house of a barber, who had conspired with the commissary of health to poison his fellow-citizens, is erected a pillar, called Colonna Infame, with an inscription, to perpetuate the memory of the execrable design. The environs of this city are very pleasant, being adorned with beautiful seats, gardens, orchards, &amp;c. About two Italian miles from it, at the seat of the Simo∣netti family, is a building, that would have been a master-piece of its kind, had the architect de∣signed it for an artificial echo. It will return or repeat the report of a pistol above sixty times, and any single musical instrument, well touched, will have the same effect as a great number of instru∣ments, and produce a most surprising and de∣lightful concert. Milan stands seventy-five miles
<PB N="358" REF="3650"/>
from Turin, sixty-seven almost north of Genoa, and about two hundred and sixty north-west from Rome.</P>
<P>Mousa, a small town in the neighbourhood of Milan, on the river Lambro. Here, among other curious antiquities, is the iron crown, as it is stiled, from an iron rim on the inside, formerly belonging to the kings of Lombardy, with which the empe∣rors used also to be crowned, as kings of that country.</P>
<P>Cassano, a small town on the Adda, eighteen miles north-east from Milan, where the canals reaching to the Lambro and Serio begin.</P>
<P>Marignano, a small town with a castle, on the river Lambro, about ten miles from Milan.</P>
<P>Varese, a populous market-town not far from the Lago Maggiore.</P>
<P>Anghiera, a market-town with a castle, on the Lago Maggiore. It gives name to a country, part of which belongs to the king of Sardinia. In that part of it belonging to the empress-queen, there is another tolerable town, called Sesto.</P>
<P>Como, an old, but large and populous town, with a good trade, situated on the lake to which it gives name, where the Adda issues from it, twenty-five miles north of Milan. It hath given birth to several eminent men, particularly Pliny the Younger, Catullus, pope Innocent XI. and Jovius. In its territory are some other places, of which the chief are Lecco and Fort Fuentes.</P>
<P>Pavia, a spacious, but old and thinly inhabited city, fifteen miles south from Milan. It had antiently the name of Ticinum, from the river then called Ticinus, and now Tessino, over which there is a stone bridge here of six arches. It was formerly the capital of the kingdom of the Lom∣bards, and has an antient citadel and castle, with some other decayed fortifications. It is an episco∣pal see, under the archbishop of Milan. Near the
<PB N="359" REF="3660"/>
cathedral is an equestrian statue of Antoninus Pius, or Marcus Aurelius. In the Augustine convent is a noble tomb of white marble, under which the bones of St. Augustine are said to be interred. In the same convent are deposited the remains of that Christian philosopher Boethius, author of the treatise de Consolatione Philosophiae. The tower in which he was confined, and at length beheaded, in the last year of the emperor Theodoric's reign, is still shewn to strangers. Near the grave of this philosopher is a pillar, with an inscription, signifying, that king Luitprand was buried there. Francis I. king of France, laid close siege to this city, anno 1525; but his army was totally routed before it, and himself taken prisoner. The river Tessino is so rapid, that bishop Burnet says, he ran down, with the stream, thirty miles in an hour, by the help of one single rower. Pavia gives name to a district called the Pavese, of which the greatest part belongs to the king of Sardinia. Not far from the city is a very magnificent Carthusian monastery, called Certosa, founded by John Galeazzo Visconti, who died in the year 1494, and has an elegant monument of white marble erected to his memory in the church, the front of which is also of white marble, and the sculp∣tures so exquisite, that the lower parts are covered with wire to secure them from external injuries. The park in which the convent stands is of great extent, and contains several large towns within it. The monks wear white garments, and are very hospitable: they sing the sacred offices in so slow and solemn a manner, that they constantly spend fourteen hours every day in the choir. There is an university at Pavia, consisting of seven colleges.</P>
<P>Lodi, a pretty large handsome town, on the Ad∣da, about twenty miles south-east from Milan. It was built by the emperor Frederic Barbarossa, about three miles from the place where Old Lodi
<PB N="360" REF="3670"/>
stands, which was antiently called Laus Pompeia, and was a large flourishing city, though now a mean place. The new has a castle, and gives name to a district, in which most of the cheese commonly called Parmesan is made. Some of these cheeses are said to be as large as a millstone. The town and territory is also famed for neats tongues, and a fine sort of earthen ware.</P>
<P>Cremona, a large town on the Po, about fifty miles east of Milan. It is the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Milan, and is sur∣rounded with strong walls, and defended by a castle. It suffered very much during the triumvi∣rate of Augustus, and his two associates, which gave occasion to that pathetic exclamation of Vir∣gil, <HI>Mantua vae! miserae nimium vicina Cremonae.</HI> Here is a bridge of boats over the Po, an universi∣ty, now of little repute, a magnificent cathedral, to∣gether with a great number of other churches, con∣vents, chapels, and a high tower, from which it is said, a certain lord of this city intended to have thrown the emperor Sigismund, and pope John XXIII. in order to immortalize his memory; but that his heart failed him. Before we leave the Milanese, we would observe, that though great quantities of rice are raised in it, yet they are not permitted to cultivate it near the great towns. In Piedmont, the sowing of it is absolutely forbidden; being ac∣counted detrimental both to the land, and the health of the inhabitants. The same opinion is entertained by many with regard to Turky wheat, which how∣ever is much used, both in the Milanese and Pied∣mont. Mr. Addison says, that the state of Milan is like a vast garden, surrounded with a noble mound∣work of rocks and mountains; that the soil in most parts of it is fertile, producing two crops annual∣ly, the one of wheat, and the other of barley, Turky wheat, rice, &amp;c. The first is reaped in
<PB N="361" REF="3680"/>
June, and the other in October. Mr. Keysler says, that he observed, that the peasants, in that part of the Milanese belonging to the king of Sar∣dinia, in rainy weather, wore a long cloak, of straw or rushes, down to the calves of their legs, and generally went barefooted. The Milanese is said to have yielded a revenue to the kings of Spain of above two millions of dollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of MANTUA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is encompassed by the duchies of Milan and Modena, the ecclesiastical state, and the territories of Venice; being in length from east to west about sixty miles, and in breadth from six or seven to about thirty-five. It is well watered by the Po, and several smaller rivers and canals, which contribute greatly to its fertility; so that it pro∣duces plenty of corn, flax, fruit, and excellent pastu∣rage for a good breed of cattle and horses, with some wine. This country was long possessed by the family of Gonzaga; first as marquisses, and after∣wards as dukes. The last duke, Charles IV. siding with the French, in the war about the suc∣cession to the crown of Spain, and admitting a French garrison into his capital, was put under the ban of the empire, under which he died in 1708, after the Imperialists had over-run the whole duchy: ever since, it hath been in the possession of the house of Austria, and now makes a part of the government of Milan. The revenue of it, while in the hands of its own dukes, is said to have a∣mounted to five hundred and nine thousand crowns. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Mantua, which gives name to it, and is its capi∣tal. It is one of the antientest cities in Italy, having been founded, as some think, even before Rome itself, and stands in a marsh or lake, formed by
<PB N="362" REF="3690"/>
the Mincio, in consequence of which situation it is very strong, but the air, especially in the summer, is unwholesome. The bridges leading to it are guarded by forts. The walls are said to be four miles in circuit, and the number of the inhabitants (exclusive of the Imperial garrison, and four or five thousand Jews, who live in a particular quarter, and have several synagogues) about sixteen thou∣sand. Here are a great many convents and churches, with some fine squares, streets, and houses; but the city is much declined from what it was when it had dukes of its own. The riding∣school, it is said, has not its equal; and the course is also well contrived. The ducal palace is old, and now much neglected; but the church be∣longing to it has a vast collection of riches, gold and silver crucifixes, statues, and some good pic∣tures. Mantua is an episcopal see, dependent on the pope. The cathedral, of which Julio Romano was the architect, contains some fine paintings, particularly a night-piece, by Paul Veronese. There are three suburbs belonging to this city, on the other side of the lake. The river Mincio di∣vides it almost into two equal parts, and has six bridges over it. In the church of St. Andrew they pretend to have some of the blood of Christ, which is shewn once a-year to the people. The univer∣sity here was founded in the year 1625. The silk manufacture, which once brought large sums into the country, is now inconsiderable. A little way from Mantua is Pietola, formerly Andes, the vil∣lage where Virgil was born; and near it is a grot∣to, to which that great poet is said to have often retired for study.</P>
<P>St. Beneditto, a Benedictine abbey, where the famous countess Matilda died, and was buried. This abbey is not inferior to any in Italy in wealth and magnificence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="363" REF="3700"/>
<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITIES of CASTIGLIONE and SOLFERINO.</HEAD>
<P>These principalities are fiefs of the empire, and lie between the duchy of Mantua and the Bresci∣ano. They were formerly a part of the duchy; but were afterwards dismembered from it, and given to a younger branch of the family of Gonza∣ga, of which Ferdinand, on account of some dif∣ferences between him and his subjects, was obliged to quit the country in 1692, and neither he nor his son could obtain the restitution from the emperor. They take their names from their capitals, which are small: the first, however, is fortified, and has a citadel, with a palace of the prince.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHIES of PARMA and PLACENTIA.</HEAD>
<P>These duchies have always been united. By the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, they were ceded, by the house of Austria and the king of Sardinia, to the infant Don Philip, second brother to Don Carlos, the present king of Spain, and to his law∣ful heirs male. The present duke is the son of Don Philip, and a minor. To the north and west these duchies are bounded by the Milanese; to the south by the territories of Genoa; and to the east by the duchy of Modena. They are very fertile and delightful, producing plenty of corn of all sorts, wine, oil, chesnuts, truffles, and rich pas∣turage, which feed great numbers of cattle. The cheeses made here are now inferior to those of the Lodesan, and other parts; but there are still good silk, woollen, and linen manufactures, with some salt-works, mineral springs, copper and iron-mines, chalk, chrystals, and petroleum or rock-oil, of which some is found without any mixture of water, and
<PB N="364" REF="3710"/>
some floating on the surface of it. These duchies were long possessed by the family of Farnese, de∣scended from a natural son of pope Paul III. as fiefs of the papal see, to which they paid an yearly acknowledgment of ten thousand crowns; but they are now fiefs of the empire. The revenue of the duke is computed at upwards of five hundred thousand crowns per annum. In 1767, the order of the Jesuits was suppressed here; and an edict was published by the regency, with respect to ecclesi∣astical affairs, which almost entirely secludes the Roma see from all jurisdiction in the duchy. The places of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ost note in it are,</P>
<P>Parma, which gives name to one of the duchies, being a large populous city, on the river Parma, from which it takes its name, and by which it is di∣vided into two parts, connected together by several bridges. It is said to be about four Italian miles in circumference, and to contain between forty and fifty thousand inhabitants, with many fine streets and houses. The ducal palace consists of three courts, two of which are new. The large theatre here, built by Renatus I. in 1618, is famous throughout Europe: it is said, that it will contain upwards of seven thousand spectators, and is so contrived, that a word spoken, ever so low, on the stage, is heard distinctly all over the pit; nor does any confused reduplication or echo happen, if the voice is raised ever so high. The ducal palace con∣tained a very valuable collection of pictures, medals, antiquities, and curiosities, until Don Carlos carried off most of them, together with the fine library, to Naples, when he became king thereof, in 1748. Here is an university, founded in 1599; and an academy, in 1601. In the latter, young noblemen and gentlemen are instructed, at a very easy rate, in all the arts and sciences, and genteel accomplish∣ments, becoming their rank; and in the German,
<PB N="365" REF="3720"/>
French, Spanish, and Italian languages: the Je∣suits, before their expulsion, had the direction of it. There are a great many fine churches, besides the cathedral, and a baptistery, the outside of which is covered with marble, and where all the children born in the city, and within two miles of it, are bap∣tized. Its chief trade is in silk, and silk stock∣ings. There is a citadel on each side of the city, but the other fortifications are not remarkable. The bishop of this see is under the archbishop of Bologna, though formerly under that of Ravenna. The houses here are mostly painted on the outside, like those of Genoa. In the course, the quality and gentry take the air in their coaches, as at Lon∣don in Hyde-park. In the Capuchin church, among other noble persons of his family, lies buried the illustrious hero Alexander Farnese, the third duke of Parma, who leaped, the first man, sword in hand, into the Turkish gallies, at the battle of Lepanto, when only in the eighteenth year of his age. This city is much celebrated by Livy, Ci∣cero, and other Roman authors, for its beauty and opulence, and the integrity and valour of its citi∣zens; and, by Martial, for its fine woollen manu∣factures. The air here is very serene and healthful, and the situation delightful. One of the duke's coaches is said to be of beaten silver, with the in∣side, seats, and curtains, of the finest embroidery in gold and silver. This city stands nineteen miles from the Po, thirty-five miles east of Modena, se∣venty-three north-west from Florence, seventy-seven south-east from Milan, and two hundred from Rome.</P>
<P>Placentia, a pretty large city, and the capital of the duchy of that name, thirty-seven miles almost west of Parma, and at a small distance from the Po. Here is a great number of churches and con∣vents, and about twenty-eight thousand inhabi∣tants,
<PB N="366" REF="3730"/>
of which two thousand are said to be monks, nuns, and other ecclesiastics. The citadel is pretty strong, but the other fortifications inconsiderable. It is said to have its name from its delightful situa∣tion in the midst of a spacious fertile plain, where the pastures are so rich, being watered, at pleasure, by means of small sluices, which convey water from the Po, that fifty cows will yield as much milk as is sufficient to make a cheese of an hundred-weight, every day. Of these cheeses there are three sorts, for the colouring of which saffron is generally used. Here is an university, a ducal palace, and a stately cathedral, with a fine church, called St. Maria in Campagna. The main street, stiled Stradone, is a very fine one. In the vestry of the church of the Augustines is a curious representation of the cru∣cifixion of our Saviour, cut in wood, by an un∣known hand; and before the town-house are two admirable statues, in brass, of duke Alexander, and Renatus IV. of the house of Farnese. In the neighbourhood of the city are some salt springs. The annual fair, that begins on the 15th of April, and lasts fourteen days, is accounted the greatest in Italy. The bishop of this city is suffragan to the archbishop of Milan. The Via-Aemelia begins here, and extends as far as Rimini, on the Adri∣atic.</P>
<P>Borgo de St. Domino, a mean town, yet the capital of the district, called Stato Pellavicino, and the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>We cannot quit this duchy without inserting a judicious observation of Mr. Addison. He says, the inhabitants would live in great plenty, amidst so rich and well-cultivated a soil, were not the taxes and impositions so very exorbitant, to support the vanity of their princes, who will still be endeavouring, at their subjects cost, to rival the pomp and grandeur of greater princes, as well
<PB N="367" REF="3740"/>
as to outvie those of their own rank, laying out immense sums in coaches, trappings, tables, ca∣binets, and the like precious toys, while they have not the generosity to make bridges over the rivers, for the convenience both of their own sub∣jects and strangers; so that one is obliged to pay an unreasonable exaction, at every ferry, upon the least rising of the waters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of GUASTALLA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy had long dukes of its own, de∣scended from the house of Mantua. The last duke, Joseph Maria, died in 1746, without male issue; upon which the empress queen Maria Te∣resa, took possession of the duchy, but in 1748, yield∣ed it up to Don Philip, agreeably to the treaty of Aix - la - Chapelle. It is about twelve miles in length, and five in breadth. The places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Guastalla, which gives name to it, and is its capital, standing on the river Crostolo, about three miles from the Po, and eighteen north-east from Parma. It is a small town, but well fortified.</P>
<P>Sabionetta, a small town, with a fortified castle, situated about eight miles north-west from the Po, and giving name to a small principality.</P>
<P>Buzzolo, a small, but handsome walled town, with a castle, situated about two miles from the river Oglio, and giving name to a small prin∣cipality.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of MODENA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded on the south by Tuscany and the republic of Lucca; on the north, by the duchy of Mantua; and on the east, by the Bo∣lognese, and the territories of the church; and
<PB N="368" REF="3750"/>
on the west, by the duchy of Parma; extending in length, from south to north about fifty-six Eng∣lish miles, and in breadth between twenty-four and thirty-six, and yielding plenty of corn, wine, and fruits, with mineral waters. In some places also, petroleum is skimmed off the surface of the water of deep wells, made on purpose; and in others is found a kind of earth or tophus, which when pulverized, is an excellent remedy against poison, fevers, dysenteries, and hypochondriac disorders. The country of La Salsa affords se∣veral kinds of petrefactions. The principal ri∣vers are the Crostolo, Secchia, and Panaro. The family of Esté, dukes of Modena, is very an∣tient. They had their name from Esté, a small city, in the district of Padua. In 1753, the pre∣sent duke was appointed imperial vicar-general, field-marshal, and governor of the Milanese during the minority of the archduke Peter Leopold, who was declared governor-general of the Austrian Lombardy. The duke, though a vassal of the empire, hath an unlimited power, within his own dominions, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Modena, an antient city, in Latin Mutina, which gives name to the duchy, and is its capital. It stands twenty-eight miles east of Parma, forty-four almost south of Mantua, and twenty west of Bologna, and is a pretty large and populous, but not a handsome city. It is much celebrated by Roman authors, for its grandeur and opulence; but was a great sufferer by the siege it underwent during the troubles of the triumvirate. It hath long been the usual residence of the dukes, and is also the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Bologna. In the cathedral, which is a large unwieldy building, is the Secchia rapita, or bucket, of which Tasso hath given the history in a very diverting manner. Mr. Keysler says,
<PB N="369" REF="3760"/>
that when Decius Brutus was besieged here by Mark Antony, Hirtius the consul made use of carrier-pidgeons; and that, even at this day, pid∣geons are trained up at Modena, to carry letters, and bring back answers. This city hath given birth to several celebrated persons, particularly Tasso the poet, Corregio the great painter, Sigo∣nius the civilian and historian, da Vignola the architect, and Montecuculi the imperial general. The tutelary saint of it, is named Geminianus. The ducal palace is a very noble edifice, in which, among the other fine pictures, the birth of Christ by Corregio, called la Notte Felice, is much celebrated. The only manufacture for which this city is noted, is that of masks, of which great numbers are exported. The churches of the Jesuits, of the Theatines, and of St. Dominic, are well worth viewing. In the college of St. Carlo Borromeo, between seventy and eighty young noblemen are continually maintained, and instructed both in the sciences and genteel exercises. St. Beatrix, who was of the family of Esté, is said to knock always at the gate of the palace three days before any of the family dies. Before most of the houses are covered walks, or porticos, as at Bologna. The city is fortified, and on its south side stands the citadel.</P>
<P>Sassuolo, a market-town on the Secchia. A∣bout two Italian miles from it, is a chasm in the earth, called La Salsa, whence, especially in spring and autumn, smoke, flame, ashes, and stones of a sulphureous smell issue, sometimes with a great noise, and to a considerable height.</P>
<P>Castel-Nuovo de Carfignana, the capital of the valley or territory, from which it takes its name, and which belongs partly to the duke of Tuscany, and partly to the republic of Lucca. It lies at the foot of the Apennines, but is of no note.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="3770"/>
Reggio, in Latin Regium Lepidi, or Lepi∣dum, to distinguish it from the town of that name in Calabria, a small but strong, handsome, rich, and populous town; the air, however, is said to be none of the wholesomest. It gives name to a duchy, and is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Bologna: the cathedral, dedi∣cated to St. Prosper, is a large building of the Gothic order. The citadel is reckoned a pretty strong one, and is the residence of the governor.</P>
<P>Corregio, a small town with a castle, fourteen miles from Modena, which gives name to a prin∣cipality.</P>
<P>Carpe, a small town on the canal of Secchia, about eleven miles north of Modena. It gives name to a principality, and is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Bologna.</P>
<P>Mirandola, a strong, but not very large city, with a citadel, about twenty-four miles north-east from Modena. It is the see of a bishop, and the capital of the principality to which it gives name, and which for a long time belonged to the noble family of Pico. Of this family and city was the the famed Picus de Mirandola, whose works are well known among the learned; and being printed in a large and small character, give name to the letter which printers call double and single pica.</P>
<P>Novellara, a small town, giving name to a prin∣cipality, lying between that of Corregio, and the duchy of Reggio.</P>
<P>Rivolo or Rollo, a small place giving name to a county.</P>
<P>Canossa, a castle on a mountain, in the court∣yard of which the emperor Henry IV. was obliged to stand three days in very severe weather, dressed in a penitential garment, barefooted, and without meat or drink, and to implore his pardon with tears,

before the haughty pope Gregrory VII. would grant it him, and receive him again into the bosom of the church.</P>

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITIES of MASSA and CARRARA.</HEAD>
<P>These principalities were for a considerable time under the Genoese jurisdiction. Afterwards they belonged to the house of Malaspina, then to that of Cibo, the daughter and heiress of which was married to the hereditary prince of Modena, who thereby became lord of these countries, which are contiguous to one another, and very fruitful. They both have their names from their capitals, and lie on the Tuscan sea. Massa, situated on the river Frigido, about three miles from the sea, is the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbishop of Pisa, and has a ducal palace. Carrara is a small, neat town, on the little river Lavenza, four miles from Massa, and as many from the sea, at the foot of some high mountains, which yield a fine sort of marble, that brings in a considerable income to the duke.</P>

<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of GENOA.</HEAD>
<P>There are few states in the world that have passed through so many revolutions and forms of government as this. After the declension of the Roman empire, the Ligures or Genoese fell under the dominion of the Ostrogoths, Eastern emperors, and Lombards. After the last of these were expelled Italy by Charlemagne, they ac∣knowledged the German emperors as their sove∣reigns for some time; but at last erected them∣selves into an independent state. In the year 806, they were become so powerful by their flourishing
<PB N="372" REF="3790"/>
trade, that they made themselves masters of the island of Corsica. In the twelfth century, they made great conquests in Sardinia, Sicily, the Crim, on the Black Sea, and in the neighbourhood of Genoa; but the war in which they afterwards engaged with Venice, for the superiority at sea, weakened them greatly. In the last century intestine di∣visions brought them so low, that they were fain to put themselves under the protection of other powers, of whom France treated them in a very tyrannical manner, until they were delivered by Andrew Doria, who established their present form of government. They have since made a shift to maintain their liberty, though they have suffered considerable losses, and met with rude shocks and insults from their powerful neighbours. In 1684, they were bombarded by the French: in 1730, Corsica revolted, and hath never been entirely re∣covered since; but so great an army hath been lately transported thither from France, in conse∣quence of a treaty with the Genoese, by which the French undertook the reduction of the island, or, as some say, purchased it, that the poor Corsicans, in all probability, will soon be obliged to bend their necks to the polished, but galling yoke of French tyranny.</P>
<P>In the war that was terminated by the treaty of Aix la-Chapelle, they took part with France and Spain, and in consequence of that, were attacked on all hands, by the Imperialists, the king of Sar∣dinia, and the English fleet. The first even made themselves masters of Genoa, but were soon after expelled from it with a terrible slaughter.</P>
<P>With respect to the form of government, it is aristocratical. The doge or duke, who must be at least fifty years of age, and disengaged from all trade, is chosen only for two years, either out of the antient, or modern nobility. After the ex∣piration of the two years, he cannot be chosen
<PB N="373" REF="3800"/>
again for five, but is intitled to a procurator's place, and a pension. The legislative power is lodged in the great council or senate, consisting of four hundred nobles, of which four parts in five must agree to every law that is made. The lesser council consists of a hundred, and is a sort of com∣mittee of the former. The administration is vested in the doge, assisted by twelve governatori, and eight procuratori, who continue in office as long as the doge, and are a sort of council to him, three of the former, and two of the latter, living in the ducal palace with him three months, when they give place to as many new ones. The doge has the title of serenity during his office, and a guard of two hundred Germans. There are se∣veral other boards and tribunals, as the syn∣dics, the commissaries of peace, and the laws, the censors, the administrators of the bank of St. George, the rotas, &amp;c. The making of laws, and raising money, belongs to the great council; but war, peace, and alliances, to the lesser. The nobility are divided into new and old: of the for∣mer are twenty-eight families, of which those of Doria, Fieschi, Spinola, Grimaldi, and Imperiali, are the chief; of the latter about five hundred: both are equally capable of employments; a noble∣man of fifteen years standing, is qualified to be chosen doge. All of them trade, at least in the wholesale way, except the Dorias and Spinolas, and they all wear black in the city, and have the title of excellency; but the greater part of them, it is said, have not above five hundred pounds a year.</P>
<P>Their public revenues, we are told, do not a∣mount to a million and a half of crowns per an∣num. The government has the monopoly of corn and wine, so that the bakers must fetch their wheat from the public granaries, and the wine-sellers
<PB N="374" REF="3810"/>
from the public cellars. As a great part of the estates of the nobility lie in the kingdom of Naples, and Spain owes them great sums, they are under a sort of necessity of taking part with that crown, when a war breaks out. The customs are another considerable branch of the revenue, to make up the deficiencies of which, the state has frequently been obliged to borrow large sums, at a high interest, which gave rise to the bank of St. George.</P>
<P>In time of peace the republic keeps on foot usually a body of five thousand regulars, of which a part are foreigners. There is also a militia. During the war before last, they had eighteen thousand men in pay. Their naval force, once so formidable, is now reduced to six gallies.</P>
<P>The established religion of the Genoese domi∣nions is the Roman catholic, and no other is tole∣rated. The inquisition has full power here, as it has in most other states of Italy.</P>
<P>As to the coin of Genoa, twelve denari make one soldi, twenty soldi one lira, which is about eight pence three-fifths sterling, five lira are equal to a piece of eight; nine liras eight soldi make a scude d'oro, or half a doppia di Spagna, seven liras twelve soldi make a scudo d'argento, four liras a scudo di cambio, five liras eight soldi a philippe di Milano, nineteen liras two soldi current a dop¦pia d'Espagna French weight; eighteen liras six¦teen soldi a doppia de Genoa.</P>
<P>The Genoese territories extend along that part of the Mediterranean sea, commonly called the gulph of Genoa, about one hundred and fifty-two miles, but their breadth is very unequal, being from eight to about twenty miles.

Placentia, Parma, the dukedom of Tuscany, and the republic of Lucca. This tract, though a great part of it is mountainous, and some of that bar∣ren enough, yet produces plenty of excellent fruit, good pasture, wood, garden-stuff, and mulberry∣trees, with some wine and oil, but little corn. What they want of the last, they have either from Lombardy, Sicily, or Naples.</P>
<P>The dominions of the republic on the continent, are divided into the Riviera di Levante, i. e. the eastern coast, and the Riviera di Ponente, or the western coast. In the former the principal places are,</P>
<P>Genoa, the capital of its dominions, as it was of the antient Liguria. Modern writers call it, in Latin, Janua, but the Romans always stiled it Genua. It is celebrated by antient authors, as a rich and opulent city, and Strabo calls it the em∣porium of Liguria. It stands on the coast of the Mediterranean sea, at the bottom of a little gulph, partly on the flat, and partly on the declivity of a pleasant hill, in consequence of which it appears to great advantage from the sea. It is defended on the land side by a double wall, which, in cir∣cumference, is about ten Italian miles. The New and Balbi-streets consist entirely of a double strait row of magnificent palaces. The others, though clean and well paved, are crooked and narrow. There are three places from which one may have a full view of the city, viz. about a mile off at sea, from the top of the light-house, and the hill, on the side of which it is built. The beauty of the prospect is much heightened by the lemon and orange-trees, evergreens, and flowering shrubs, on the tops of houses, and in the gardens. The suburb of San Pietro d'Arena, is full of noble houses, built with exquisite taste. The palaces of the nobility are almost all of marble, and many of them are painted on the outside. That there
<PB N="376" REF="3830"/>
should be such a profusion of marble here, is not to be wondered at, as the neighbouring hills a∣bound with it. The city contains a vast number of palaces, churches, and convents, and several hospitals. Of the palaces those of the family of Doria, Pellavicini, Lercari, Carriga, Balbi, and Durazzo are the finest. The palace, where the doge resides, and where the great and little coun∣cil, and the two colleges of the procuratori, and governatori assemble, is a large stone building in the center of the city; but it contains some fine paintings in fresco, two statues of Andrew and John Doria in white marble, and an arsenal, in which are said to be arms for thirty-four thousand men, with a shield, containing one hundred and twenty pistol barrels, and thirty-three coats of mail, which it is pretended, were worn by as many Genoese heroines in a croisade. Of the churches the finest are those of the annunciation, St. Mary Carignan, St. Dominic, and St. Martha. In the cathedral is a dish made of a single emerald. All the inhabitants here, except the principal ladies, who are carried in chairs, walk on foot, on ac∣count of the narrowness or steepness of the streets. The fortifications of the city towards the sea are remarkably strong. There are two fine stone-bridges over the rivers Bonzevera and Bisagno, the first whereof washes the west, and the other the east side of the city, within which there is also a surprising stone-bridge, joining two hills. The harbour, though large, is far from being safe; but no care or expence have been spared, to render it as safe and commodious as possible. The wind to which it is most exposed, is that called Labeccio, or the south-west. The place where the republic's gallies lie, is called the Darsena, where are a great number of Turkish slaves. On a rock, on the west side of the harbour is the fanal, or light-house,
<PB N="377" REF="3840"/>
a high tower, on the top of which is a lanthorn, containing thirty-six lamps. The trade of Genoa is chiefly in velvets, damasks, plush, and other silks, brocades, lace, gloves, sweetmeats, fruits, oil, Parmesan cheese, anchovies, and medicinal drugs from the Levant; but the badness of the harbour, and the high price of commodities, greatly check its commerce. In 1751 Genoa was declared a free port for ten years, under certain restrictions: in that called Porto Franco, any merchant may have a ware house, and import or export goods du∣ty-free; but such as are disposed of in the city, or on the continent, are taxed pretty high. The no∣bility are allowed to trade in the wholesale way, to carry on velvet, silk, and cloth manufactures, and to have shares in merchant ships; and some of them, as the Palavacini, are actually the great∣est merchants in Genoa. Another very profitable article of trade carried on by them is banking, and dealing in bills of exchange. A new academy of painting, sculpture, civil and military architec∣ture, was instituted here in 1751. One may walk the streets of Genoa in the night with the greatest safety, which is more than can be said of many cities in Italy. Excessive splendor and luxury are, in several respects, restrained by salutary laws. Every married lady here has her cizesbeo, who constanly waits upon her, and performs all the of∣fices of a lover, without incroaching, as he pre∣tends, upon the privileges of the husband. Such intimacies, however, are thought to be often car∣ried farther. No beggars are permitted to ask alms in Genoa, and the inns are better than those at Turin. When a single person is buried, a kind of garland of all sorts of artificial flowers is placed on the coffin. The Genoese in general are esteemed crafty, industrious, and inured to labour above the other Italians. Here, as in most other
<PB N="378" REF="3850"/>
cities of Italy, is a very grand procession on Cor∣pus Christi day. Over the door of the arsenal is fixed an old rostrum or beak of a Roman ship, made of iron, and resembling a boar's head. Genoa stands two hundred and forty miles north-west from Rome; sixty-five south from Milan; forty-seven south-east from Turin; and one hun∣dred and forty almost north-west from Florence. The number of the inhabitants is computed at one hundred and fifty thousand.</P>

The town in Latin is called Fanum Romuli. There are many plantations of palm-trees about it, with olives, lemons, pomegranates, and other fine fruits.

It is the capital of a marquisate, which was sold, in 1713, to the Genoese, by the emperor, for one million two hundred thousand piastres, under certain conditions, and as a perpetual fief of the empire. At the treaty of Worms, the queen of Hungary resigned all her pretensions to the town and marquisate of Final, to the king of Sardinia, upon condition, that he repayed the Genoese their purchase-money, and made Final a free-port. The Genoese refusing to deliver it up, and endeavour∣ing to keep possession of it by force of arms, and for that end, entering into an alliance with France, Spain, and Naples, the king, after he had in vain offered to resign all his rights to them, provided they would break off their alliance with those crowns, made a conquest of it, and other territories of the Genoese, but at the treaty of Aix-la-Cha∣pelle, they were all restored.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of VENICE.</HEAD>
<P>This state, like many others, rose from very small beginnings. That groop of small islands, where the city of Venice now stands, was originally inha∣bited only by fishermen; but when Italy was in∣vaded, first by Alaric, king of the Goths, and af∣terwards by Attila, king of the Huns, who spread ruin and desolation wherever they came, great numbers of people, who lived near the Adriatic, fled to these isles, with all their wealth. From that time a city gradually rose, which at last, in the course of several centuries, attained to a high de∣gree of power, and a much more extensive domi∣nion than it at present possesses, tho' that is far from being inconsiderable. Like Genoa it was indebt∣ed, in a great measure, for its power and wealth to commerce; for before the Portuguese discovered a passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, the Venetians purchased the merchandize of the East at Alexandria, and other ports in the Levant, and dispersed them all over Europe; in consequence of which they became immensely rich and power∣ful, but have declined ever since they lost that trade. Exclusive of what they are now possessed of, they were once masters of the islands of Rhodes, Scio, Samos, Mytilene, Andros, Candia, the Morea, with the cities of Gallipoli, and Thessalo∣nica; and in 1194, in conjunction with the French, they even took the city of Constantinople, and re∣mained
<PB N="382" REF="3890"/>
some time in possession of a part of that em∣pire. They also disputed the dominion of Scla∣vonia, Croatia, Morlachia, and Dalmatia, with the king of Hungary, and contended with the Genoese for the empire of the sea with various suc∣cess; but of a great part of these, and their other conquests, they have since been stripped, chiefly by the Turks.</P>
<P>As to the government of this state, it was at first vested in consuls, afterwards in tribunes. A∣bout the beginning of the eighth century, a doge, or duke, was elected, and vested with unlimited power; but in 1171, the power of the doge was much abridged, and a council of two hundred and forty persons, composed of commons as well as no∣bles, was appointed. Soon after, under duke Marino Morosini, the present form of electing the doge was introduced. In 1296, the government became aristocratical, the privilege of sitting in the great council being then confined to the nobility, in whom alone the supreme authority at present is vested. The number of nobles amounts to about two thousand. All those are members of the se∣nate, but, according to their antiquity, some are accounted more honourable than others. One class, and that the lowest, consists of the poste∣rity of those, who, in the necessitous times of the commonwealth, purchased their nobility for one hundred thousand ducats. The nobles have the title of excellency, and wear, at least when in the city, a black furred gown reaching to their heels, with long caps and periwigs. Some of them are so poor, that they are fain to beg of the rich. The nobility in their dominions on the continent, though some of them are of very antient families, are ex∣cluded from all offices, and treated with great in∣solence and contempt by their haughty lords. At the head of the government is the doge, whose
<PB N="383" REF="3900"/>
office was once hereditary, and power absolute; but the former is now elective, and the latter very much circumscribed: indeed he is no more than a gaudy slave, loaded with fetters, which one would think could not be much the lighter for being gilt; yet so much is the human heart captivated with external pomp and pageantry, that the office, for the most part, is eagerly sought after: but should one, otherwise inclined, be chosen, he cannot de∣cline it, without exposing himself to banishment, and confiscation of his effects. Though the power of the doge is very small, his state and retinue are very splendid: his title is that of serenity, and his office for life: he is said to be a king with regard to his robes, a senator in the council-house, a pri∣soner in the city, and a private man out of it. The yearly revenue of his office is about four thousand pounds; and though he may be deposed, he can∣not resign his dignity. All the nobility have a seat in the great council, unless they are under twenty-five years of age. In this council the su∣preme authority and legislative power is vested. Next to it is the senate, or pregradi, which con∣sists of about two hundred and fifty members, who have the power of making peace or war, and fo∣reign alliances, of appointing ambassadors, fixing the standard of the coins, imposing duties and taxes, and all offices by sea and land are in their gift. The third council consists of the doge and his six counsellors, in which all letters and instruments re∣lating to the state are read, ambassadors admitted to audience, and other important affairs transacted. The other colleges are the council of ten, which decides all criminal cases without appeal, and to which even the doge himself is subject: the pro∣curators of St. Mark, whose office is very lucrative, and who decide with respect to wills, guardian∣ships, and the making a proper provision for the
<PB N="384" REF="3910"/>
poor; and the state inquisition, whose business it is to provide for the public tranquility. In the wall of the ducal palace are heads of lions and leopards, with open mouths, to receive informations of any plot or treason against the state. The ecclesiastical, or holy inquisition as it is called; but the power of this court, so formidable in other countries, is here under great restrictions. Here is also a particular college for the regulation of dress, but their juris∣diction does not extend to strangers.</P>
<P>The principal Venetian order of knighthood is that of St. Mark, the badge of which is a large gold medal, dependent on the breast. The order of Constantine knights wear a cross hanging from a gold chain.</P>
<P>With respect to religion, that of the Venetians is the Roman catholic; but they are no bigots. We have already observed, that the court of inquisition here is under very great restrictions, and the pope is considered as little more than a temporal prince, his supremacy being rejected. The priests, monks, and nuns, may take almost what liberties they please, provided they do not meddle with the state. What relates to Jews, Greeks, witchcraft, and the like, is not cognizable by the inquisition; but on∣ly heresy, and the abuse of the sacraments. In short, the church is entirely under the controul of the state. At the head of the former is the patriarch, but he has very little power; next to him is the primate, and then the archbishops and bishops. In our account of Carniola we observed, that by an agreement between the court of Vienna and the Venetians, the patriarchate of Aquileia was to cease at the death of the then patriarch, and an archbishopric to be erected instead of it, at Udina, in the territories of the republic. Jews, Arme∣nians, and Greeks, are allowed the public exercise of their religion, and protestants are indulged
<PB N="385" REF="3920"/>
in private; but they omit singing psalms in their meetings. The Lutherans of the German factory maintain a preacher of their own, who wears a lay∣habit. Though the Jesuits have not yet been banished from the dominions of the republic, yet, by some late resolutions of the senate, their power and authority have been greatly curtailed.</P>
<P>The Venetians are still the greatest naval power in Italy. They pretend they could fit out, in case of necessity, sixty men of war, one hundred gal∣lies, and ten galeasses; though one can hardly imagine how they could man half that number. Mr. Keysler says, that when he was there, which was about forty years ago, they had in all fifty gal∣lies, of which twenty-five were at sea, and the rest in the harbour, ready equipped for service, besides twenty-four men of war on the stocks. He says further, that four galeasses, fifty galliots, with four bomb-galliots, and four advice-boats, are always kept ready rigged in the arsenal; that the trunks of ten thousand trees lie continually in water to be used occasionally; that the annually charge of the docks and yards amounted to five hundred thou∣sand ducats, at about three shillings and four-pence each; and that, in time of war, the number of artificers was between two or three thousand.</P>
<P>The army is said to consist of between twenty and thirty thousand men, the greatest part of which are Dalmatians and Switzers. The commander in chief, stiled capitano, is always a foreigner of distinction. General Graeme, a Scotchman, lately enjoyed that honourable post.</P>
<P>The ordinary revenues of the state are computed at about one million two hundred thousand pounds sterling; but, in time of war, they can raise them greatly. A considerable part of the revenue arises from the customs, and the duty on salt, made at Corsu and Chioza.</P>
<P><PB N="386" REF="3930"/>
With respect to the coins of Venice, a lira, value about sixpence two-fifths sterling, is equal to ten cassetti, or twenty soldi; six liras and a half are equal to one ducat current; five liras and one∣sixth are equal to one ducat di banco, or four shil∣lings and four-pence sterling; twenty-nine liras current, or thirty-six of the baser sort, are equal to a doppia, or a Venetian, Spanish, Florentine, and French pistole; eighteen liras and one-fourth are equal to a zequin; sixteen liras to a ducat of gold, or ongaro; four liras to a large silver crown; eight liras ten foldi to a Justiniana and Filippo.</P>
<P>In the Venetian dominions the governor of a province is stiled proveditore-generale, or governa∣tore; and of a large town podesta, or castellano. We now proceed to a more particular description of the several territories belonging to the republic in Italy.</P>
<P>Having already treated of those in Dalmatia, and the islands on the coast thereof, or that of Greece, we begin with the dogado, or duchy of Venice, consisting of islands, and a small part of the continent, in which the principal places are,</P>
<P>Venice, in Latin, Venetia, or Venetiae, the ca∣pital and seat of the republic, standing at least four miles from any part of the terra firma, upon a cluster of islands. Its appearance at a distance is very striking, looking like a great town half float∣ed by a deluge. Betwixt the city and the terra firma are a great many shallows, on which, at low water, you may almost every where touch the bot∣tom with a pole; but all possible care is taken to prevent their becoming dry land. On the south side of the city are also shallows, but on these there is a greater depth of water. The channels be∣twixt them are marked out by stakes, or poles, which on the approach of an enemy would certainly be taken away. The city is divided by a vast num∣ber
<PB N="387" REF="3940"/>
of canals, on which ply the gondoliers, or watermen, in their black gondolas or boats. The streets are very clean and neat, but narrow and crooked. There are no carriages, not so much as a chair to be seen in them. Though the city, by its situation, and the great number of steeples, tower∣ing above the water, strikes one with admiration at a distance; yet when he is got into it, it does not answer his expectation; for excepting the square of St. Mark, and a few other places, there is nothing grand or beautiful in it, at least in comparison of many other cities in Italy. Of the canals, that called Il Canale Maggiore, or the Great Canal, is by far the largest and longest, and consequently the most beautiful. Here races are sometimes run for prizes in the gondolas. On its banks are also several stately houses. Over these canals are a great number of handsome bridges of one arch, but with∣out any fence on either side: they are all built of white stone, with which the streets are also paved, except the Rialto over the great canal, which is all of marble, and cost the republic two hundred and fifty thousand ducats, the arch being ninety feet wide. The canals in summer are said to emit a bad smell, from the great quantities of filth con∣tinually running into them. The finest gondolas are those in which the foreign ministers make their public entries, being richly decorated with gilding, painting, and sculpture. The number of islands on which the city stands, according to some, is sixty, according to others seventy-two. The cir∣cumference is about six Italian miles, and it takes up about two hours to make the circuit of it in a gondola. The inhabitants are supposed to be a∣bout two hundred thousand, including those of the islands Murano, La Guideca, and those who live on board the barges. There are near two hundred springs of fresh water in the city, but the water of
<PB N="388" REF="3950"/>
many of them is so indifferent, that the principal families preserve rain-water in cisterns, or are sup∣plied with water from the Brenta. The most re∣markable places in the city are the ducal palace, the square, and church of St. Mark, who is the tutelar saint of Venice, the mint, public library, grand arsenal, several of the palaces of the nobles, churches, convents, and hospitals. In these last is a prodigious collection of the finest paintings; Venice, in this respect, surpassing even Rome it∣self. The diversions of the Venetians are chiefly masquerading, especially during the carnival, and other festivals; ridottos, operas, plays, which are generally wretched performances, and concerts of vocal and instrumental music. During their festi∣vals, debauchery, riot, and licentiousness, are carried to the greatest height. The courtezans here, we are told, are absolutely lost to all sense of mo∣desty and common decency. The grand scene of all the shews and follies of the festivals, is the square of St. Mark, in which bulls are sometimes baited. The marriage of the sea on Ascension∣day is one of their greatest solemnities. From the Sunday before Ascension-day to Whitsunday is an annual fair. In the doge's palace all the high col∣leges hold their assemblies; but we are told by se∣veral travellers, which seems very strange, that the stairs are no better than a privy. In this palace is a small arsenal, furnished with arms against any sudden insurrection of the people, together with a state prison, a great many exquisite paintings, and several curiosities, among which are some claustra castitatis. One side of it is towards St. Mark's square, and the lower gallery on that side, with the hall under the new procuratie facing it, are called the Brog<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io, where the nobility, and none else, at least while they are present, are allowed to walk. The square of St. Mark is the greatest
<PB N="389" REF="3960"/>
ornament of the city, and hath the form of a pa∣rallelogram. In this square, besides the church and palace of St. Mark, are two towers, on one of which is a curious clock, and the other has stairs so constructed, that one may ride up on borseback: the latter is also so high, that it is said, that in a clear day, and when the gilding of the spire was fresh, it could plainly be discerned an hundred miles from Venice. Opposite the ducal palace is the public library of the commonwealth, containing a large collection of books and manuscripts, with some fine paintings, statues, and curiosities. Hard by St. Mark's square is the zecca, or mint: from zecca the gold coin called zecchino takes its name. One of the smallest pieces of money at Venice is called gazetta; and the first news papers published there, on a single leaf, having been sold for that, a piece, all kinds of news-papers were from thence stiled ga∣zettes. The grand arsenal is two and a half Italian miles in circuit, and contains vast quantities of naval and other warlike stores: some pretend, that it could furnish arms for ten thousand horse and an hundred thousand foot: here are the trophies of Scanderberg and others, with the helmet of Attila, &amp;c. The rope-walk is four hundred and forty-four common paces in length, and the ropes and cables are va∣lued at two millions of silver ducats. In the foun∣dery none but brass cannon are cast, and an hun∣dred men are generally at work in the forges. The salt-petre works here deserve a traveller's no∣tice: there is a vessel filled with wine and water, four times a day, where the workmen, though a thousand or more, may drink as much, and as often, as they please. Close to the Rialto is the bank. There are two academies for painting at Venice, where the disciples draw from the life. The Ger∣man factory contains about five hundred rooms; and is the general magazine for all goods that ei∣ther
<PB N="390" REF="3970"/>
come from Germany, or are to be sent to that country: here also the factors and merchants of that country, if unmarried, may reside. Venice is well supplied with provisions of all sorts, especially fish In the churches are a great many fine monu∣ments, and exquisite paintings. The trade of the city, at present, is far short of what it was formerly. Their chief manufactures are cloth, especially scar∣let, silks, looking-glasses, gold and silver stuffs, brocades, velvets, and paper, of which, and wine, oil, fruit, sweet-meats, anchovies, and several sorts of drugs used in physic and painting, the exports are still considerable. Venice has neither walls, gates, nor citadel, to defend it, its situation supply∣ing the want of all these. In the treasury of re∣lics is the protocoll, or original manuscript, as they pretend, of St. Mark's gospel; it is rarely shewn, and the writing, by length of time, is so defaced, that the greatest connoisseurs in manuscripts can∣not determine, whether it was wrote in Greek or Latin. Besides what is properly called the city, there is a multitude of little islands lying round, which are covered with buildings, and make each of them a kind of separate town, the most conside∣rable of which is that called Guideca, or the Jews Quarter, which is large and populous; with St. Erosmo, St. Helena, St. Georgio, Chiosa, Il Li∣do de Palestrina, Il Lido de Malamocco, and Mu∣rano: these islands are a sort of fence to the city, breaking the violence of the waves. To distin∣guish them from others, the Jews here must wear a bit of red cloth in their hats. The gardens in this city are few, and inconsiderable: In the island of Murano are made those beautiful looking glasses, and other glass-works, for which Venice is so much noted: here the family of Cornaro hath a palace, with a gallery of paintings, little short of an Italian mile in length. The salt-works in the island of
<PB N="391" REF="3980"/>
Chiosa are of great benefit to the Venetians, and yield a very considerable revenue. There are seve∣ral other small islands about Venice, besides those I have mentioned, but they are inconsiderable. It is said the law here allows a nobleman to poison his wife for adultery, and to cause her gallant to be poignarded. We had almost forgot to observe, that over the great door of St. Mark's church are four brass horses, which were formerly gilt, and are said to have been brought from Constantinople: they are universally allowed to be master-pieces. This city stands two hundred and thirty miles north from Rome, an hundred and ninety from Vienna to the south, and an hundred and forty east from Milan.</P>
<P>Maestro, or Mestre, a middling town on the continent, about three miles from the Lagune. It is so delightfully situated, that many of the Vene∣tian nobles have seats in it.</P>

<HEAD>The PADUAN, or TERRITORY of PADUA.</HEAD>
<P>This district is exceeding fertile, and well culti∣vated. Its greatest length, from north to south, is about thirty-five miles; and its breadth about twenty-eight, at a medium. The places of most note in it are,</P>
<P>Padua, which gives name to it, and is its capital. It was antiently called Patavium, and was one of the richest and most flourishing cities in Italy; but is now much declined, the number of the inhabi∣tants hardly amounting to forty thousand. It stands on the Brenta, about thirty-four miles east of Venice, and contains a great number of churches, convents, and several hospitals; but the streets are narrow, dirty, and ill-paved. The university here was formerly in great repute; but it hath declined greatly, in consequence of the unbounded licen∣tiousness
<PB N="392" REF="3990"/>
of its scholars. The physic garden is supe∣rior to most, and its arrangement is very elegant and judicious. St. Anthony, who was born at Lisbon, in the year 1196, is held in the highest ve∣neration here: indeed, the homage paid him is greater than that paid to Christ, or God himself. The church of the Franciscans that is dedicated to him, but especially the chapel in which his body lies, are splendid beyond imagination: the very beggars ask alms only in the name of St. Anthony. <Q>One of the votive tables in the chapel is thus inscri∣bed: <HI>Exaudit St. Antonius, quos non exaudit Deus,</HI> i. e. “St. Anthony hears those whom God himself does not hear.”</Q> Padua is the see of a bishop, whose re∣venue exceeds an hundred thousand crowns. In the church of St. Justina lies interred the celebrated Cornara, who was born in the year 1646, a lady of extraordinary knowledge in divinity, astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. In the convent of the Dominican monks is shewn a cell, where Al∣bertus Magnus is said to have lived. On the right hand of St. Carlo's altar, in the cathedral, lies the celebrated Charles Patin, whose wife and daughters were also very learned. Before St Justin's church is a large area, formerly called the Campus Martius, and now Prato della Valle, where, the first Sunday of every month, a market is held for cattle. A∣mong the public edifices, the town-house is esteem∣ed the most magnificent. The Paduans are firmly persuaded, that the bones found in a leaden chest in St. Justin's church, in 1414, are actually those of Ti∣tus Livy, a native of this place. In the podesta's pa∣lace is the city library, and in the Old Castle, is an ar∣senal and granary: on the river, within a small distance of one another, are no less than thirty mills: the finest private house in the whole city is the Palazzo deSeran∣zo: in the palace of count Francesco Capo de Lista is a woodenhorse, which Mr. Keysler tells us, his guide
<PB N="393" REF="4000"/>
assured him, was the identical wooden horse of Troy. Of the gardens, the finest is that of Papa∣fava, in which are hedges of box, thirteen or four∣teen feet high. The air round Padua is accounted very healthful; but its territory is said to be sub∣ject to violent storms, particularly from the sea. Mr. Keysler tells us, that houses for the donne li∣bere or donne del mondo, are publicly tolerated at Padua; that it is the particular province of cer∣tain physicians to visit them frequently; and, what is a little odd, that one of them joins to the convent of the Eremitical fathers, and another to a nun∣nery of St. Blaze. The Jews have a particular quarter allotted them in this city. They ridicu∣lously pretend to shew here the tomb of antenor, the Trojan hero. The palace of the capitaneo or governor is a grand structure, and stands in a fine square. They make no difficulty here of burying a protestant in a church or convent, if his name has been entered in the university matricula, before he died. The Benedictine convent has an income of an hundred thousand ducats, and the cathedral of an hundred thousand scudi, per annum.</P>
<P>Abano, a village five miles from Padua, noted for its warm baths.</P>
<P>Arqua or Arquato, a little town, nine miles from Padua, whither Petrarch, after the death of his dear Lauretta or Laura, retired, and spent the rest of his days.</P>
<P>Esté, a small place, two miles south of Padua, whence the family of the dukes of Modena had their name.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The VERONESE or TERRITORY of VERONA.</HEAD>
<P>This is a very fertile spot, yielding a profusion of corn, wine, oil, and fine fruits, with marble, petre∣factions, valuable plants, rich pastures, great num∣bers of fine cattle, and a variety of fish. In this
<PB N="394" REF="4010"/>
district lies the Lago di Garda, which was antient∣ly called Benacus, of which some geographers make the length thirty, and some forty miles; and the breadth, some thirty-six, others much less. The most remarkable places in the Veronese are,</P>
<P>Verona, which gives name to it, and is its capital, being a very large city, fortified in the antient manner, and delightfully situated on the Adige, in a serene and healthy air, forty-nine miles west of Venice. Over the river are four bridges, of which that which leads to the castle is much admired. The city looks much better at a distance, than when one is in it; the streets being generally narrow, crooked, and dirty, and the houses meanly built. Here are three old castles, viz. II Castello Vecchio, St. Pietro, and St. Felice. The number of the in∣habitants is reckoned at about fifty thousand. The best street in the city is that called the Corso, where horse and foot races are sometimes run. The largest square is that called Piazza d'Armi, where the an∣nual fairs were formerly kept, in April and Au∣tumn. The Scaliger family were formerly lords of Verona; and in the church of St. Maria Antica are some monuments of the family, with their arms. In the town-house are the statues of five ce∣lebrated persons, natives of Verona, viz. the poets Catullus and Aemilius Marcus, the historian Cor∣nelius Nepos, Pliny the elder, and Vetruvius the architect. This city hath given birth to many other famous persons, among which are Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Fracostar, Pomponius Secundus, Peter Martyr, Paul Veronese an eminent painter, and cardinal Henry Norris. Among the private build∣ings the finest is the palace of count Maffei; next to which are those of count Bevilaqua, Canossa, Sig∣niori Verzi, Pompeii, and Pellegrini. Here are se∣veral academies or societies, as the Philharmonci, for the improvement of music; and the Philoti, for the improvement of the genteel exercises of
<PB N="395" REF="4020"/>
riding, fencing, vaulting, dancing, &amp;c. Here is also an elegant theatre for operas and comedies. Among the churches at Verona, that of St. George is the handsomest. The dome or cathedral is an old building, in which is the tomb of pope Lucius, and a monument erected to one of the bishops, the epitaph on which says, that there was betwixt him and his Maker, summa necessitudo, summa simili∣tudo. Among other antiquities here, is the cele∣brated amphitheatre, which, by the commendable care and attention of the inhabitants, has been pre∣served in good condition, and pretty entire, thro' a succession of so many centuries, being less than that of Vespasian at Rome, but more perfect. It is not known when, or by whom, it was erected; tho' it must have been soon after the Augustine age. It is computed, that it would have conveniently held upwards of twenty thousand spectators. Near the city is a fine plain, where the musters and mili∣tary exercises are performed, and annual fairs kept. Verona is the see of a bishop, whose revenue a∣mounts to between four and five thousand crowns. There are several admirable collections of antiqui∣ties and curiosities in Verona, which a stranger may easily obtain a sight of. The principal com∣modities exported from hence are medicinal herbs, gathered on Monte Balbo, oil, olives, of which those of this neighbourhood are accounted excellent, some wine, and linen, woollen, and silk manufac∣tures. There is a very commodious water-carriage for goods, from hence to Venice, down the Adige.</P>
<P>Garda, a castle on the lake to which it gives name, about sixteen miles from Verona. The lake is about thirty miles in length, and near ten where broadest, and is surrounded on all sides with olive, fig, lemon, orange, and other fruit trees; but, at some seasons, is much agitated by storms.</P>
<P>The other places in this district are inconsiderable, except Isola della Scala, which is a handsome town.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="396" REF="4030"/>
<HEAD>The VICENTINE.</HEAD>
<P>This territory hath its name from its capital, the antient city of Vicentia, now Vicenza. The soil here is rich and fertile, no district in Italy being better watered, and the air serene and healthy. Its length is about forty miles, and its breadth about thirty three. The wines of this district are much admired. In the hills are found silver and iron ore, and fine quarries of stone. Here are also fine pasture-grounds and corn-fields, with plenty of fish, game, cattle, and mulberry trees, and a fine sort of chalk for scouring cloaths and plate, and the sand from which they make Venice glass. The places of most note in this district are,</P>
<P>Vicenza, a pretty large city, at the confluence of the Bachiglioni, and Verone, about twenty-nine miles west of Venice. It is about four miles in circuit, and its inhabitants are computed at a∣bout thirty thousand. Formerly it had strong walls, but these are now neglected and decayed. Over the principal river are several bridges, and without the city is a triumphal arch, built from a design of Palladio, in imitation of the antient structures of that kind. There are a great many elegant buildings within it, particularly in the piazza before the council-house; for besides the cathedral and other churches, and the convents, which are numerous, there are several hospitals, and some fine palaces. The wine of Vicenza is highly cele∣brated, as it may be drank, during the pains of the gout, without the least inconvenience, and the territory belonging to it, on account of its ferti∣lity, is called the garden and shambles of Venice. In the neighbourhood is a very fine garden belong∣ing to count Valmarano, in which is a covered walk of cedar and orange-trees, and by the side
<PB N="397" REF="4040"/>
of it, a broad canal well stocked with barbels, and other fish, which, at the sound of a pipe ap∣pear on the surface of the water, to be fed. The inhabitants of this city are said to be more vindic∣tive than the other Italians; whence they have got the name Gli Assassini Vicentini, or Assassins of Vicenza. The celebrated architect Andrea Pal∣ladio, was born here. The academy of the Olym∣pici, whose principal design is to improve the elegance of the Italian language, hold their meet∣ings in a most beautiful theatre, built by the ce∣lebrated architect Andrea Palladio. From the church della Madonna di Monte without the city, is a most charming prospect, both of the city and neighbouring country. The council-house is a stately fabric, and so is the Monte della Pieta. In the latter is a fine library. Some remains of a Roman amphitheatre, of a noble aqueduct, and some mag∣nificent hot baths are still to be seen here. In the neighbourhood of the city, is the splendid seat of count Trissino, and, as it is said, a grotto called II Cubalo, cut into the solid rock, which is large and intricate, and even in the warmest day of sum∣mer, exceeding cold. Some springs here too, we are told, petrify every thing that is thrown into them, and yet have living fish in them.</P>
<P>Tretto, a small place, near which are silver and iron mines. Hard by this town is Monte Sum∣mano, famous for its rare plants, and the coins and other antiquities that have been found about it. Breganza and Lonigo are small places noted for excellent wine.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BRESCIANO.</HEAD>
<P>This district has been subject to the Venetians above two centuries and a half. Though moun∣tainous, it is fruitful in wine, oil, and grain;
<PB N="398" REF="4050"/>
being watered by two lakes, and several rivers. In its mountains are found gold, silver, iron, copper, and marble of all colours. The most noted places in it are,</P>
<P>Brescia, which gives name to it, and is its ca∣pital, standing in a pleasant plain on the little river Garza. It is not above three miles in circuit, but is very populous, and drives a considerable trade in fire-arms, swords, knives, and other cutlery wares. They make here also linen cloth, and deal in many other kinds of merchandize. The castle stands on a rock, and commands the whole town, and the arsenal is well furnished with war∣like stores. There is a great number of con∣vents and churches here, besides the cathedral, which is a stately modern structure. The bishop, who takes the titles of duke, marquis, and count, is suffragan to the archbishop of Milan, and has a large income. They have here a kind of blue standard, with a red cross in it, which, they say, is what appeared to Constantine in the air, when he was going to fight Maxentius. This city stands about forty-four miles east of Milan, and is said to contain near fifty thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>Deserzano, a large and fine market town, on the Lago de Garda, noted for wine and fish.</P>
<P>Rovato, a place noted for the best small marble statues, and for inlaid work of wood.</P>
<P>Iseo, a neat little town, which gives name to the lake on which it stands.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BERGAMASCO.</HEAD>
<P>The Venetians have been in possession of this district ever since the year 1428. Some spots in it are fertile enough, but others as barren; a great number of cattle and sheep, however, are bred in it, and it produces some good wine, being well
<PB N="399" REF="4060"/>
watered by a number of rivers, with iron mines, and quarries of mill-stone. The inhabitants are said to be subtile and industrious, but to be very subject to the wens we took notice of in Savoy and Piedmont. The only place in this ter∣ritory worth mentioning is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Bergamo, a well fortified town, at the foot of the Alps, about twenty-five miles north-east from Milan. It is a place of considerable traffic, and has a great fair at Bartholomew-tide, to which great numbers of merchants and tradesmen repair from Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. It is also the see of a bishop, suffragan to the archbi∣shop of Milan, and has a strong castle, situated on the highest part of the city.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The CREMASCO.</HEAD>
<P>This is a small, but pleasant, healthy, and fer∣tile district. The only place in it worth mention∣ing, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Crema, a well fortified town on the river Serio, the Venetians have been in possession of it since 1428. Here is a manufacture of linen cloth and thread, which the women are famed for spinning and whitening. Here is also the see of a bishop, who is suffragan to the archbishop of Bologna. The city is handsome and well built, and stands twenty-four miles south-west from Brescia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The POLESIN of ROVIGO.</HEAD>
<P>This district, surnamed of Rovigo, to distin∣guish it from the Polesin or Polesino de Ferrara, d'Arcano, &amp;c. is very fertile, being a kind of peninsula formed by the Po, Adige, Tattaro, and Castagnaro. Its greatest length is reckoned
<PB N="400" REF="4070"/>
about fifty miles, and breadth about twenty-five. The Venetians made themselves masters of it an∣no 1500. The only places in it worth mention∣ing are,</P>
<P>Rovigo, a pretty large place on the river Adi∣getto, about thirty-three miles south-west of Ve∣nice. It is but thinly inhabited, and its walls are old and decayed.</P>
<P>Adria, or Hadria, an antient town on the ri∣ver Tattaro, twenty-five miles south from Venice. It is the see of a bishop, who is subject to that of Ravenna, but resides at Rovigo. It was much more considerable antiently, when it gave name to the Adriatic.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MARCA TREVIGIANA.</HEAD>
<P>This district takes its name from Treviso, its capital, which also gives name to one of its sub∣divisions, called the Trevigiana, a spot so fertile, that it looks like one continued garden, and in particu∣lar abounds in timber. The town stands on the river Site, where it joins the Piavesella, about thirteen miles north-west from Venice: though old, it is reckoned pretty strong, and contains many neat houses; some noble families also live in it. The Venetians have been in possession of it since 1388. It is the see of a bishop, and hath given birth to many princes, and other great personages.</P>
<P>Feltré, a small city about forty-five miles north-west of Venice. It is the see of a bishop, and gives name to a small mountainous territory.</P>
<P>Belluno, a small but well peopled city, on the river Piava, about forty miles from Venice. This also is the see of a bishop, and gives name to a small mountainous tract, in which are some iron mines.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="4080"/>
Cadore, a small place, but the capital of a little district, styled II Cadorino. The celebrated pain∣ter Titian was born here.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PATRIA DEL FRIULI.</HEAD>
<P>This country, which in Latin is called Forum Julium, or Forojuliensis Piovincia, is situated on the most northern verge of Italy. The greater part of it belongs to the Venetians, and the rest to the Austrians. Of the latter we have given an account under the circle of Austria. The whole country, including the Austrian and Venetian ter∣ritories, is about fifty two miles in length, and forty-five in breadth, where broadest. It is very fertile in corn, wine, and fruit. The principal places belonging to Venice are,</P>
<P>Udino, a considerable city, on the river or canal La Roia, about twenty miles north from the Adri∣atic gulph, and as many to the west of Aquileia. It is now the capital of the territory of Friuli, and hath a fine castle, with several handsome churches, palaces, and convents; besides a col∣lege for law, and an academy for martial exercises. It was till lately, the residence of the patriarchs of Aquileia, but that patriarchate having been suppres∣sed, by an agreement between the Austrians and Venetians, two archbishoprics have been erected out of it, one here, and the other at Gortz, belong∣ing to Austria.</P>
<P>Palmanova, a well fortified town, on the canal La Roia, about ten miles south-east from Udino, and nineteen south-west from Gortz.</P>
<P>Pordenon or Portenau, in Latin Portus Naonis, a considerable town on the river Noncello.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="402" REF="4090"/>
<HEAD>ISTRIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country is about sixty miles long, but not near so broad. It is a kind of peninsula on the Adriatic, belonging partly to the Austrians, and partly to the Venetians, and is very fruitful, though hilly; but the air is so unwholesome, that it is but thinly peopled. We have given some account of what belongs to the house of Austria, under the circle of that name. In the Venetian part the only places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Capo de Istria, called antiently Justinopolis, from the emperor Justin, who either founded or rebuilt it. It is a strong town on an island in the gulph, which is so near the continent, that it is joined to it by a bridge. It is also the see of a bishop, and the capital of Istria, whence it had its name. Here are several convents, and antiently it is said, there were two temples, dedicated to Pal∣las and Cybele. A great deal of salt is made on the island.</P>
<P>Parenzo, a small town, but the see of a bishop, with a good harbour, twenty-eight miles from Capo de Istria, to the south. The air here is said to be unwholesome.</P>

<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of LUCCA.</HEAD>
<P>Lucca, is a small republic, on the coast of the Mediterranean, between the territory of Genoa on the west, the Modenese on the north, and Tus∣cany on the east. It is only about thirty Italian miles in circumference, according to Keysler, but
<PB N="403" REF="4100"/>
is exceeding fertile, and populous. The inhabi∣tants, who are said to amount to upwards of one hundred and twenty thousand, are very in∣dustrious, and very jealous of the Tuscans, by whom they are almost surrounded. The forces of the republic amount, in time of peace, to about six hundred men, including the doge or gonsaloniers guard of Switzers, which consists of seventy-six men; but there are above thirty thousand men in the territory of Lucca capable of bearing arms. The government is vested in two councils, of which one is called the council of state, and the other the great council, the executive power being in the former, consisting of nine members besides the doge, who continue in office only two months, and during that time, have apartments in the pa∣lace of the republic, and are maintained at the public expence. The great council consists of two hundred and thirty nobles, and ten burghers, who enjoy their office two years. The title of the doge is, Excellenza, and of the state, La Serenissima Re∣publica di Lucca. The annual revenue amounts to about four hundred thousand scudi, or eighty thousand pounds sterling. Lucca the capital and the only place in the republic's territory worth de∣scribing, is about three Italian miles in circumfe∣rence, and well fortified. The walls afford very pleasant walks, being planted with rows of trees. The number of the inhabitants is about forty thousand. The houses are generally well built, and the streets broad and well paved, but irregu∣lar. Several manufactures, particularly of silk are carried on, and the finest oil of any in Italy is said to be made here. Here also is the see of a bi∣shop. The cathedral is a large Gothic structure, dedicated to St. Martin, and its principal relic the crucifix, with the Volto Santo, said to have been made by Nicodemus. The bishop is entitled to
<PB N="404" REF="4110"/>
the cross and pallium, being immediately subject to the pope. The young women here are not so closely confined, as in most other Roman catholic states, but are frequently seen in the streets and churches. The palace belonging to the republic is a large building, containing an arsenal, in which are arms for twenty thousand men. Besides this city, there are said to be a hundred and fifty small towns and villages in the territory of the republic.</P>

<HEAD>The GRAND-DUCHY of TUSCANY.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy which makes a part of the antient He∣truria, excepting some small detached parts, is en∣compassed by a part of the Mediterranean, called here the Tuscan sea; the ecclesiastical state; the duchy of Modena; and the republic of Lucca: its extent from north to south being about an hun∣dred and sixteen English miles, and from east to west, about eighty.</P>
<P>Though some parts of it are mountainous, yet both the hills and dales are covered with vines, olives, citron, lemon, and orange-trees, &amp;c. The mountains yield also copper, iron, alum, &amp;c. and some quarries of the finest marble and porphyry. Here is also plenty of corn, rice, saffron, honey, wax, wool, flax, hemp, with mineral waters, rich pasture, salt-pits, sulphur, alabaster, chalcedony, lapis lazuli, borax, amethysts, cornelians, jaspers, quicksilver, crystals, and black slate. In some places the elms and ashes yield manna.</P>
<P>The principal river in Tuscany is the Arno, which has its source in the Apennine mountains, and falls into the sea below Pisa. There are some other smaller rivers.</P>
<P>This duchy fell under the dominion of the Romans about four hundred and fifty-five years before Christ. The Ostrogoths possessed them∣selves of it in the fifth century, and after them
<PB N="405" REF="4120"/>
the Lombards, who were expelled by Charle∣magne anno 800, in consequence of which it be∣came subject to the German emperors, who appointed governors over it. At last the cities of Florence, Pisa, Sienna, and some others, during the contentions between the pope and the empe∣ror, and their respective adherents, the Guelphs and Gibellines, withdrew themselves from the do∣minion of both, and erected themselves into se∣parate commonwealths. In that of Florence, John de Medicis, a popular nobleman, so insinuated himself into the favour of his countrymen, that they invested him with sovereign power. Pope Pius V. conferred the title of grand-duke on Cosmo de Medicis, anno 1570, in whose family the duchy continued until the death of Gaston de Medicis, who died without issue, anno 1737. The duchy was then transferred to the duke of Lorrain, the late emperor, in lieu of the duchy of Lorrain, which, by the peace of 1736, was given to king Stanislaus, during his life, and then was to be an∣nexed to France. The present grand-duke is the second son of the late emperor Francis, and brother to the present. He is married to a daughter of Spain, and resides at Florence. His annual reve∣nues are computed at above five hundred thousand pounds sterling, arising chiefly from the tenths of all estates, that are sold or alienated, and the ground-rents of the houses in Leghorn, and the duties on almost all manner of provisions.</P>
<P>The great duke is absolute in his dominions. His standing forces consist only of three regi∣ments of foot, and two of dragoons, and his ma∣rine of a few gallies and galeasses; but, in case of necessity, it is said, he can bring thirty thousand men into the field, and increase his marine with twenty men of war; but it does not appear, how he could man them.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="4130"/>
We shall give an account of the trade of the duchy in our description of the towns, especially of Leghorn.</P>
<P>With respect to the money of the grand duchy, twelve denaris make a soldo; twenty soldi, a scudo; one hundred and fifty soldi or seven and a half scudi, or liras, make a scudo d'oro, which is an imaginary coin; two liras, or three giuli are equal to a teston; six liras to a piece of eight; se∣ven liras, or ten and one half giuli, to a ducat or silver crown; twenty liras or thirty giuli to an Italian pistole; twenty liras and about four soldi, or between thirty and thirty-one giuli, to a Spanish pistole. In paying custom, a piece of eight is va∣lued only at one hundred and fifteen soldi, or five liras and three quarters.</P>
<P>The only order of knighthood in this state is that of St. Stephen, instituted in 1554, by Cos∣mo I. which consists of three classes, namely the Cavalieri della Guistitia, della Gratia, and de Commenderie. The duke is always grand-master, and the badge of the order, an octangular red cross, with a golden border, worn on the breast. The principal places in the duchy are,</P>
<P>Florence, the capital, situated on the river Arno, about fifty miles south of Bologna, sixty south-east of Modena, seventy eight from Parma, one hundred and five from Mantua, a hun∣dred and twenty-six south of Venice, and one hundred and twenty north-west of Rome. It is said to have been at first called Fluentia, which was afterwards altered to Florentia, on account either of its flourishing state, or fertile soil. The Italians now call it Fiorenza. It gives name to a district, which is extremely well peopled, fertile, and beautiful. Over the Arno are four stone bridges. The number of churches, convents, hospitals, and palaces is very great. The streets are mostly crooked and narrow, but
<PB N="407" REF="4140"/>
clean, and paved with greyish stone dug in the neighbouring mountains. To describe all the cu∣riosities in this city, especially in the old and new ducal palaces, would take up a volume. It is enough to say, that they contain the richest col∣lection of all manner of rarities, both of art and nature, antient and modern, that is, perhaps, in the whole world. The palaces here are said to be inferior to those of Turin, Genoa, and Rome; and paper windows very common. The number of the inhabitants is computed at seventy thousand. Here is an academy for the improvement of the Tuscan language, called della Crusca, another for agriculture, and another for riding. The principal trade here, besides wine, oil, fruits, and other produce of the country, consists in wrought silks, gold and silver-stuffs. The nobility and gentry do not think it below them to trade; they even sell their wine by retail out of doors, but not in their houses: at the same time they look upon it as a great disparagement, to educate their chil∣dren in the profession of physic. They write the Italian here very well, but their pronunciation is guttural, and disagreeable. Florence is adorned, we are told, with seven fountains, six columns, two pyramids, and about an hundred and sixty public statues. Most of the Florentines are said to be short-sighted, and hence the Fiorentini ciechi, or blind Florentines, has passed into a pro∣verbial jest. As the Tuscan order, and rustic work owe their orgin to this country, the archi∣tects take care to give them a place in all the struc∣tures they rear in this duchy. The great piazza or square is very spacious and magnificent, with a noble fountain in the midst of it. The arsenal is well worth a traveller's notice, being a stately building, and well furnished with all sorts of weapons of war, kept in very good order. The cathedral is a very magnificent edifice, the whole outside being of
<PB N="408" REF="4150"/>
polished marble, and enriched with the most ex∣quisite architecture and sculpture; and from the ball over the cupola, you have a most delightful prospect of all the churches, palaces, monaste∣ries, &amp;c. within the walls, and of near two thou∣sand villas, or country seats, without Hard by the church stands the much celebrated Campanile, or square steeple, which is one hundred and eighty feet high, all of fine marble, of several colours, and curiously wrought. From the top of this tower you have much the same prospect as from the cupola of the church. The baptistry, or font, where all the children of the city are baptized, is also well worth the attenuon of a traveller. Of the other churches we have not room to say any thing more, than that they are in general beauti∣ful, and contain many fine paintings, and other pieces of art. Beside the two grand palaces men∣tioned above, the duke hath several noble country seats, enriched and adorned in the same magnifi∣cent manner. The physic-garden belonging to the great duke is well stocked with the most curious and rare plants; and in the seraglio de Leoni, are kept all kinds of wild beasts. When the chapel for the interment of the great dukes, in the church of St. Lorenzo, is finished, there will not be its equal in the whole world. Near the ducal gallery of curiosities, is the ducal chymical laboratory. The quarter where the Jews live is called II Ghetto, and in the Mercato Nuovo is the exchange. This city is not fortified; but on the side of the river Arno it has a good citadel, called St. Giovanni. In the road leading from Florence to Sienna, are still visible many remains of the antient Via Cassia.</P>
<P>Arezzo, formerly Aretium, and one of the twelve antient cities of Etruria. It is now the see of a bishop, and stands forty miles south east from Florence. Pope Gregory X. lies buried in the ca∣thedral.
<PB N="409" REF="4160"/>
Maecenas, Augustus's favourite, and the great patron of learned men, Guido Aretini, an eminent musician, and Peter Aretini, the saty∣rist and poet, were born here.</P>
<P>Cortona, another of the twelve antient cities of Etruria, situated four miles north of the lake of Perugia, near the confines of the Ecclesiastical State. It is now a small, but handsome city, and the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>Fiesole, antiently called Fesulae, and a famed city, stands within two miles of Florence, and has a stately abbey, but is otherwise inconsiderable.</P>
<P>Fiorenzuola, a small town in a valley, among the Apennine mountains, of which some about it are almost continually smoaking.</P>
<P>Pistoia, a large town on the river Stella, but very thinly inhabited, about twenty miles from Florence. Its name in the Itinerary is Ad Pistores. Formerly it was a distinct state. Here the famous, or rather infamous, Cataline was defeated; and in latter times the factions of the Guelphs and Gibel∣lines rendered it remarkable. The water-melons here are said to be very fine. In the neighbouring country the cattle are all perfectly white.</P>
<P>Pisa, a large town on the Arno, fifty-two miles from Florence. It was a famous republic, till subdued, first by the duke of Milan, and then by the Florentines, in the year 1406. Before it lost its freedom, it is said to have contained near one hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants, but now has not above sixteen or seventeen thousand. Its territory is very fruitful, abounding in corn, wine, fruit, and fine cattle. The houses are well built, and the streets even, broad, and well paved; but in many places over run with grass. The univer∣sity is well endowed, and has able professors, but is not in a very flourishing condition. The exchange is a stately structure, but little frequented. The
<PB N="410" REF="4170"/>
great duke's gallies are built, and commonly sta∣tioned here. This city is also the principal resi∣dence of the order of St. Stephen, and the see of an archbishop. The cathedral, a large Gothic pile, contains a great number of excellent paintings, and other curiosities. The echo of the Baptistery is said to exceed that near Milan, though the re∣petitions are not quite so distinct. Hard by the ca∣thedral is the city burying ground, called II Campo Santo, and in that the famous leaning tower, the inclination of which is so great, that a plumb line let down from the top touches the ground at the distance of near fifteen seet from the bottom. In the church della Spina, they pretend to have one of the thorns of the crown that was placed on our Saviour's head. The city for its defence has a moat, walls, a castle, fort, and citadel; the last of which is a modern work. The Arno is of a considerable breadth here, and has three bridges over it, one of them of marble: two leagues be∣low the town it falls into the sea. The physic gar∣den is very spacious, contains a great number of plants, and is decorated with water-works: over the door leading into it are these words, <HI>Hic Argus sed nos Briareus esto;</HI> i. e. Employ the eyes of Ar∣gus, but not the hands of Briareus. The air is said to be unwholesome here in summer, on ac∣count of the neighbouring morasses. Many buf∣faloes are bread in the neighbouring country, and their flesh commonly eaten. A canal runs from this city to Leghorn; and between it and Lucca are hot baths.</P>
<P>Leghorn, antiently called Liburnus Portus, but by the modern Italians, Livorno, a handsome town, and a free port, about thirty miles south-west from Florence, in the territory of Pisa. The only defect of the harbour is its being too shallow for large ships. Cosmo I. had this town, in exchange for Sar∣zana,
<PB N="411" REF="4180"/>
from the Genoese, and it is the only sea-port in the duchy. It was then but a mean unhealthy place, but is now very handsome, and well built, with broad, strait, parallel streets. It is also well fortified, but wants good water, which must be brought from Pisa. The port, consisting of two havens, one for the duke's gallies, and the other for merchant ships, is surrounded with a double mole, above a mile and a half in length, and de∣fended, together with the town, by a good cita∣del, and twelve forts. Roman catholics, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, Mahometans, and even the English factory, are indulged in the public exer∣cise of their religion; but other protestants must be satisfied with the private. The trade carried on here is very great, and most of it passes through the hands of the Jews. Though only two piastres, or scudi, are paid for every bale, great or small, imported or exported, yet the duties on all provi∣sions and commodities brought from the continent to the town are very heavy. The number of the in∣habitants is said to be about forty thousand, and one half of these Jews, who live in a particular quarter, but without any mark of distinction, and have a fine synagogue. The walks on the ramparts are very aǵreeable. There is good anchorage in the road, but ships riding there are much exposed to the weather, and the Barbary corsairs. The num∣ber of English families in Leghorn are about thirty-six; they are much favoured by the government, and carry on a great trade. The power of the in∣quisition is limited to ecclesiastical matters, and Roman catholics. There are a great many Turk∣ish slaves here, brought in by the duke's gallies, who are often sent out on a cruize against the cor∣sairs of Barbary. The light-house stands on a rock in the sea, near which is the Lazaretto, where quarantine is performed. Another source, from
<PB N="412" REF="4190"/>
which the duke draws a great revenue, is the mo∣nopoly of brandy, tobacco, and salt; but that, with the heavy duties, makes provisions dear. The Turks, who are not slaves, live in a particular quarter, near that of the Jews. The common prostitutes also have a particular place assigned them, out of which they must not be seen, with∣out leave from the commissary. The number of the rowers in the gallies, whether Turkish slaves, criminals, or volunteers, are about two thousand. In the area before the darsena, or inner harbour, is a fine statue of duke Ferdinand, with four Turk∣ish slaves, in bronze, chained to the pedestal. The ducal palace is one of the finest structures in the town, and the ordinary residence of the governor. Leghorn is the see of a bishop, and has a noble ca∣thedral; but the other churches are not re∣markable.</P>
<P>Volterra, formerly Volaterae, now a mean lone∣ly place, though antiently one of the principal cities of Etruria. The air is said to be unwholesome.</P>
<P>Sienna, an antient and still a pretty large city, thirty-eight miles south of Florence. It was for∣merly the capital of a considerable republic, but was reduced by the emperor Charles V. who trans∣ferred it to his son Philip II. of Spain, and he made over the whole, except the Stato de gli Pre∣sidii, to Cosmo I. duke of Florence, in lieu of the debts he owed him. The territory to which this city gives name, is about sixty-five miles from north to south, and near as many from east to west, very fertile and pleasant, well cultivated, and peo∣pled. The city is very clean, neat, and healthy, but far from populous, seventeen thousand inhabi∣tants being the most it contains. These are said to be very polite, and of a lively disposition, the wo∣men beautiful, and under less restraint than in other parts of Italy; hence, as it is imagined, it is
<PB N="413" REF="4200"/>
that the Italian language is spoken here in the greatest purity. The walls are adorned with many high towers of brick, and the streets paved with bricks set edge-ways. Here is the see of an archbishop, and the cathedral is a very magnifi∣cent Gothic pile, being very large, and covered with the finest marble, curiously wrought both with∣in and without; but what is particularly admired in this structure, is the pavement, which consists of the most costly marble, curiously inlaid with gems, so as to represent, in a most masterly manner, the histories of the Old Testament. This work, which is justly esteemed too fine to be trod upon, is cover∣ed with boards; but these can be easily removed to gratify the curiosity of a stranger. Among the relics here, are the right-arm of John the Baptist, and the sword with which Peter cut off the ear of Malchus. Directly under the cathedral lies St. John's church, the entrance to which is at the foot of the hill. One may look down into the latter through a grate in the pavement of the former. The arms of this city are Romulus and Remus sucking a wolf, for it pretends to have been a co∣lony founded by these two brothers. Near the senate-house is a tower, called La Mangiana, noted for its curious chimes, but they only play on so∣lemn occasions. In the square before the senate-house is a marble fountain, finely executed. Charles V. founded an academy here, which, at present, is in a declining condition. Here also is a castle, but it was never a place of much strength; and near it is a riding-school. Fronting the cathedral is a spacious and well-endowed hospital, founded by a shoe-maker, who is interred in the church, and, as a reward for his liberality, hath been canoniz∣ed. Over the statue erected to his memory is this apposite inscription, <HI>Sutor ultra crepidam;</HI> i. e. The shoe-maker went beyond his last. The Je∣suits
<PB N="414" REF="4210"/>
church here is very fine, and in that of the Dominicans is the head of St. Catherine of Sienna. These Dominicans gravely tell us, they have in their possession the wedding ring which our Saviour gave St. Catharine, at the solemnization of their marriage, which, according to them, was performed with the utmost magnificence, king David assisting, and playing on his harp. In the house where she resided at Sienna, they shew the window, through which, they pretend, Christ used often to come and visit her. In the garden belonging to the Franciscan convent, is a kind of ever-green oak, called Leccio, said to have derived its origin from the staff of St. Francis, which was here stuck into the ground.</P>
<P>Chiusi, antiently Clusium, one of the chief cities of Etruria, and the residence of Porsenna, the famed king thereof. It is now an episcopal see, under the archbishop of Sienna, but small, and poorly inhabited, by reason of its unwholesome air. It stands forty miles south-east from Sienna.</P>
<P>Monte Pulciano, a small town, noted for good red and white wine. It is also the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>Orbitello, a fortified town, on a lake, formed by an arm of the sea, thirty-eight miles from Sienna to the south-west. It is the capital of the Stato de gli Presidii, which, as we observed already, was reserved, when Philip II. of Spain made over the district of Sienna to Cosmo I. but, in 1707, the Imperialists made a conquest of it; and, in 1735, it was transferred to don Carlos, then king of both Sicilies, whose son is now in possession of it, as king of the Two Sicilies. Orbitello is said to have risen out of the ruins of the antient Coso, now a heap of ruins at a small distance from it.</P>
<P>Piombino, a small town on a rock in the sea, forty-six miles south-east of Leghorn. It rose from the ruins of the antient city Populonia, has a
<PB N="415" REF="4220"/>
citadel and castle, and gives name to a small prin∣cipality, belonging to the dukes of Sora, in the kingdom of Naples. Opposite to this principality lies the little isle of Elba, which is separated from the continent by a channel ten miles in length, and is mountainous; but its mountains afford iron, lead, and sulphur. It constitutes a part of the prin∣cipality of Piombino, and has the same proprietor, except Porto Ferraio, which belongs to the duke of Tuscany, and Porto Longone, where the king of the Two Sicilies has a garrison.</P>

<HEAD>The ECCLESIASTICAL STATE.</HEAD>
<P>This state, called by the Italians Stato della Chiesa, lies about the middle of Italy, and is bounded on the north by the gulph of Venice, and the Venetian dominions; on the south by the Me∣diterranean; on the east by the kingdom of Na∣ples, and the Adriatic; and on the west by Tuscany and Modena. Its length is about two hundred and forty miles, but its breadth varies from twenty to an hundred and twenty miles.</P>
<P>The soil, in general, of the pope's dominions is very fertile, but ill cultivated; and there are many fens and marshy grounds, which are very prejudi∣cial to the air. That the lands are badly culti∣vated and inhabited, the air bad, and the inhabi∣tants poor, idle, lazy, and grosly superstitious, is owing to their being governed by priests, who may be justly said not only to fleece them, but flea them. But it will, perhaps, be said, that though they shew little or no concern about their temporal welfare, they take care of their souls. If teaching them the most ridiculous and absurd superstition, to pray to saints and angels, and worship images, instead of God and Christ; to place religion in farce and mummery; in insignificant rites and forms; in
<PB N="416" REF="4230"/>
pilgrimages; in a profound veneration for the clergy; in offerings to the church; in founding and endowing convents; in hating and persecuting protestants, even more than Jews or Turks; in believing, as articles of faith, the most impious and irrational notions: if this is taking care of their souls, and conducting them to heaven, we own the priests who govern this, and other popish countries, cannot, in the least, be charged with want of zeal or diligence. Be that as it will, this country, with respect to the accommodations of this life, is but in a very indifferent condition; for, notwithstanding the fertility of its soil, its advan∣tageous situation for traffic, the large sums spent in it by travellers, or remitted to it from foreign countries, and its having, for its ruler, the successor of St. Peter, the prince of the apostles, and the vi∣car of Jesus Christ, yet it is poor and thin of inha∣bitants, ill cultivated, and without trade and manu∣factures. This is partly owing to the great number of holidays, of sturdy beggars, called pilgrims, and of hospitals and convents, with the amazing but use∣less wealth of churches and convents, and the in∣quisition; but the chief cause is the severity of the government, and the grievous exactions and hard∣ships to which the subjects are exposed. The le∣gates, tho' mostly clergymen, whose thoughts should be chiefly employed about laying up treasures in heaven, and who ought to set an example to the laity of disinterestedness, and a contempt of this world, yet, in fact, scruple no kind of rapaciousness: even the holy father himself, and the cardinals, make the enriching of their nephews and other re∣lations, and the aggrandizing their families, the great business of their lives. The extravagant claims and pretensions of the pope are well known, and, by all the rational part of Christendom, now treated with contempt and mockery: the Reforma∣tion
<PB N="417" REF="4240"/>
gave a great blow to his spiritual power, but as to his temporal dominions, he still possesses them entire; though it is not likely that that will long be the case, considering how much he hath lost, and is daily losing of his ghostly empire, and the venera∣tion in which he was formerly held. The Jesuits, who may justly be regarded as one of the main pillars of popery, have been already expelled from several of the most bigotted Roman catholic coun∣tries; and it is more than probable, the holy father, though it must be like the cutting off a right hand to him, will soon be obliged entirely to suppress them. The papal dominions were originally pro∣cured, partly by the voluntary gift of bigotted princes, and partly by other methods. The Cam∣pania of Rome is under the pope's immediate go∣vernment; but the other provinces are governed by legates and vice-legates; and there is a commander in chief of the pope's forces in every province. The pope is chosen by the cardinals in the conclave, who are seventy in number when com∣plete, and consist of three classes, namely, car∣dinal-bishops, priests, and deacons: they look upon themselves as on a footing with crowned heads, and have the title of eminentissimi. The pope holds a consistory of cardinals on ecclesiastical affairs; but the cardinals do not meddle with his civil government. The pope's chief minister is the cardinal-patron, usually his nephew, who amasses an immense estate, if the reign be of any long du∣ration. The cardinal that is chosen pope must be an Italian, and at least fifty-five years of age. Car∣dinal Ganganelli, who was lately advanced to the pon∣tificate, is said to be a native of the district of Rimini, a man of parts and learning, and turned of sixty. He hath assumed the title of Clement XIV. and seems dis∣posed to listen to the demands of the house of Bour∣bon, with respect to the Jesuits. The spiritual power of the pope, though far short of what it was before
<PB N="418" REF="4250"/>
the Reformation, is still considerable. It is com∣puted that the monks and regular clergy, who are absolutely at his devotion, do not amount to less than two millions of people, dispersed through all the Roman catholic countries, to assert his supre∣macy over princes, and promote the interest of the church. The revenues of these monks do not fall short of twenty millions sterling, besides the casual profits arising from offerings, and the people's bounty to the church, who are taught that their sal∣vation depends on this kind of benevolence.</P>
<P>The pope's revenues, as a temporal prince, may amount to about a million sterling per annum, arising chiefly from the monopoly of corn, the du∣ties on wine, and other provisions. Over and above these, vast sums are continually flowing into the papal treasury from all the Roman catholic countries, for dispensations, indulgences, canoniza∣tions, annates, the pallia, and investitures of archbi∣shops, bishops, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The pope has a considerable body of regular forces, well cloathed and paid; but his fleet con∣sists only of a few gallies. His life-guards are forty Switzers, seventy-five cuirassiers, and as ma∣ny light-horse.</P>
<P>As to the Roman coins, five quatrini make one bajocho; ten bajochi make one guilo, or paolo; ten guili make one scudonionito or curr, which is about four shillings and four pence sterling; thirty-two guili, or paoli, make a Spanish pistole, and thirty-one an Italian pistole; seven quatrini make a gazetta; and seven gazetta and one qua∣trino make a paolo.</P>

<HEAD>The BOLOGNESE, or TERRITORY of BOLOGNA.</HEAD>
<P>This county was once a republic; but the popes, at last, found means to annex it to their dominions. It still, however, enjoys many privileges. Its chief governor, who is changed or confirmed every three years, has the title of legate a latere, and is always a cardinal. The soil here is very rich and fertile; but not so well cultivated or peopled as might be ex∣pected. The only place of any note in it is</P>
<P>Bologna, which gives name to it, and is its capi∣tal. This city was antiently called Felsina, and is now the second in the Ecclesiastical State, and one of the most considerable in Italy, the number of its inhabitants being reckoned at upwards of eighty thousand. It hath been the seat of an archbishop ever since the year 1518. The small river Reno runs through it, and the Savona, which is larger, by its walls: the former has a communication with the Po, by a canal, which is very advantageous to the city. The manufactures here are chiefly wrought silks of all sorts, rich velvets, leather bottles, per∣fumes, sweetmeats, washballs, &amp;c. of which, and to∣bacco, hemp, flax, hams, olives, and other fruits, they vend large quantities. The only fortification of the city is a strong high brick wall, adorned with a great number of towers, at certain distances; for when the city submitted to the pope, it was stipu∣lated, that there should be no citadel or garrison kept to bridle it; that it should be allowed to send an envoy to Rome, and to have an assessor in the rota; and, that the effects of the citizens should, on no pretence whatsoever, be subject to confisca∣tion. The nuns here are very ingenious in making artificial flowers, and imitating all kinds of fruits: very beautiful works are also made of walnut-tree,

and rock-crystal. There is but a small demand now for the little dogs of this city, so that the breed is become very scarce. The theriaca prepared here, at the public elaboratory, and the electuario de Martino are highly esteemed, as antidotes against the effects of poison. All kinds of provisions are in great plenty, and the inns the best in Italy. The Bologna sausages, and dried tongues, are well known, and much valued every where. The wo∣men enjoy as much liberty here as in any city of Italy: those of the highest rank dress entirely after the French mode. Mr. Keysler says, that the num∣ber of blind people in this city is remarkable; and that of those that see, many wear spectacles in the streets, as an infallible mark of gravity and wisdom; yet the inhabitants are generally reckoned very fa∣cetious, and much addicted to satire and raillery: at the same time, they are very polite to strangers. In the centre of the city, like a mast in a ship, stands a very high tower, called Degli Asinelli, from Gerardo Asinelli, who built it, in 1109: the height is three hundred and seventy-one feet. Near it is a leaning-tower, called Garisenda, but not so high as the other. The palace, where the governor re∣sides and the courts of justice are held, stands in the great market-place, and is two hundred and eight common paces in length. There are a great many convents, fine palaces, and churches, in Bologna, adorned with a great variety of fine paint∣ings, sculptures, &amp;c. Of the churches, that of St. Petronius is the largest, in which the emperor Charles V. was crowned, in the year 1530: the greatest curiosity in this church is the meridian line, drawn by the celebrated astronomer Cassini, con∣sisting of brass, inlaid in white marble, on the pave∣ment, about an inch broad, and an hundred and eight feet in length; the rays of the sun enter, through a small aperture in the roof of the church, and shew, every day, when the sun is in the me∣ridian,
<PB N="421" REF="4280"/>
and also his place in the ecliptic. In the vestry of the Dominican church is a manuscript of the Old Testament, or at least of the Penta∣teuch, of great antiquity, written, as some pretend, by the hand of Ezra; and in a chapel of the same convent is a piece of painting, which repre∣sents an angel going up a ladder, with the great St. Dominic the nasty on his back; Christ and the Virgin Mary appearing above, holding the ladder. Here is an university, said to have been founded by the emperor Theodosius, in the year 433. In 1712, an academy for the improve∣ment of natural history, experimental philosophy, mathematics, chymistry, anatomy, and physic, was founded here by the count de Marsigli, with which the Academia Clementina bonarum Artium, founded by pope Clement XI. for the improvement of archi∣tecture, sculpture, and painting, was afterwards in∣corporated: in this college is a very fine collection of curiosities, both of nature and art. In the Al∣drovandi museum, kept in the Sala Farnese, are an hundred and eighty seven folios, and above two hundred bags full of single leaves, all written by the hand of that eminent author. In the convent of the nuns of St. Clare, a kind of holy water is distributed to devout persons, said to contain a par∣ticular virtue, from having been used to wash the body of St. Catharine de Vigri, which is preserved in the convent, and looks like a dried mummy: this saint was the foundress of the convent. Against the wall of one of the halls of the public academy is the tomb of the famous Taliacotius or Taglicoz∣zo, celebrated in the poem of Hudibras for sup∣plying people with noses taken from porters poste∣riors, but, in his epitaph, for his great skill in phy∣sic. From Bologna runs a covered walk, to the nunnery of Madonna de St. Lucca, on the Monte della Guardia, three Italian miles from the city:
<PB N="422" REF="4290"/>
the picture of the Virgin in this nunnery, said to have been done by St. Luke, is brought every year to Bologna, in a solemn procession, for the conve∣nience of which the covered walk was erected. Near Bologna, and also in some other parts of Italy, is found a stone about the size of a walnut, usually called Bononia stone, which, after a particular cal∣cination, imbibes, by being exposed a few minutes to the sun, such a quantity of light that it afterwards shines in the dark near fifteen minutes, like a can∣dle; but without any sensible heat: it retains its lustre even tho' immersed in water, and preserves this quality three or four years; but, after that, must be calcined anew. Bologna stands twenty-three miles east of Modena, fifty north of Florence, and an hundred and sixty-five north-west of Rome.</P>

<HEAD>The FERRARESE.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Ferrara had formerly dukes of its own; but, in the year 1597, it was annexed to the Ecclesiastical State. The dukes of Modena have often laid claim to it, being descended of the family of its antient dukes. The only place worth men∣tioning in the duchy is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Ferrara, a very large town on the Po, but ex∣tremely thin of people, standing twenty-three miles almost north-east of Bologna, and an hundred and ninety north-west of Rome. Here is a citadel, and a huge castle, in which the legate resides. The streets are very beautiful, in respect of length, breadth, and regularity, and contain many hand∣some houses and palaces. The other fortifications, besides the castle and citadel, are of little impor∣tance. The Benedictines have the finest convent of the place: in the church is Ariosto's monument, the epitaph of which says, he was <HI>nobilitate generis,</HI>
<PB N="423" REF="4300"/>
<HI>atq. animi clarus, in rebus publicis administrandis, in regendis populis, in gravissimis, &amp; summis pontificis legationibus, prudentiâ, consilio, eloquentiâ, praestantis∣simus,</HI> i. e. noble both in birth and mind, and most conspicuous for prudence, council, and eloquence, in administering the affairs of the public, and dis∣charging the most important embassies from the pope. The cathedral is a stately structure, overlaid with marble. In the year 1735, the bishopric of this city was raised to an archbishopric.</P>
<P>Twenty-two miles east of Ferrara is Comachio, a small town, but the see of a bishop.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of ROMAGNA.</HEAD>
<P>This country is very fertile and pleasant, pro∣ducing corn, wine, oil, fruits, rich pastures, woods abounding with game, and hot mineral waters. The mountains yield mines of several metals, and the sea and rivers plenty of fish. Considerable quantities of salt are made on the sea-coast. After the declension of the Roman empire, it was some time under the dominion of the Ostrogoths; then of the Eastern emperors, who governed it by ex∣archs; then of the Lombards, till Pepin king of France took it from them, and bestowed it on the see of Rome. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Ravenna, an old decayed city, thirty-eight miles east of Bologna, and an hundred and sixty north-west of Rome. Antiently, it was the most famous of all the Roman sea-ports, and afterwards the seat of the exarchate. At present, it hardly contains fifteen thousand inhabitants, yet there are no fewer than twenty-four convents in it. Here are some remains of the palace of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths; and in the wall of the front, is his coffin of porphyry, which formerly stood amidst the statues of the twelve apostles, on the cupola of a
<PB N="424" REF="4310"/>
round chapel without the town, called the Ro∣tunda, which is said to have been built by Amala∣sunta, Theodoric's daughter, but is now going to ruin. In the time of the Romans, the city was sur∣rounded by the sea, having no communication with the land but by a cause way; whereas, it is now three or four miles from the sea. Some re∣mains of the Roman pharos or lighthouse are still to be seen. The cupola of the above-mentioned chapel consists of one stone, in form of an inverted dish, an hundred and fourteen geometrical feet in circumference, four in thickness, and weighing near an hundred tons. In the walls of the city, towards the sea, are still to be seen the iron rings to which the ships were fastened formerly, when the sea flowed up so high. In the large market-place are two lofty pillars of granate, on which are the statues of St. Victor and St. Apollinaris; and also a brass statue of pope Alexander VII. sitting, the usual attitude of the pope in all statues and public monuments. The cathedral is a stately old fabric, adorned within with four rows of marble pillars, a roof of Mosaic work, and a pavement of porphyry, of various co∣lours. The church of St. Vitalis, and others, are also very beautiful. In the garden of the Benedic∣tine convent is a fine chapel, built by Galla Placidia, daughter to Theodosius the Great, in which the remains of Placidia herself, and of Honorius, Con∣stantius, and Valentinian III. are preserved in three coffins of white marble. At one corner of the Franciscan convent, in the public street, is the mo∣nument, with a busto of the celebrated Florentine poet Dante Alighieri, who was born in 1265, and died in 1321. His proper name was Durante, which, in his infancy, was contracted into Dante. His poems have rendered the names of Beatrix Portinaria, and Gentucca, immortal; as those of Petrarch have that of Laura. About three or four
<PB N="425" REF="4320"/>
miles from Ravenna is a wood of trees called pig∣ni, being a kind of pine or fir, the wood of which has an aromatic smell, and the fruit, which is a sort of large nut, being laid on the fire, so opens, that the kernel may be taken out and eaten, with∣out any further preparation. This fruit makes a considerable article in trade, and the husks or shells, when dried, are used for fuel.</P>
<P>Imola, antiently Forum Cornelii, a pretty town, twenty-three miles west from Ravenna, on the Via Emilia, which leads from Bologna to Rimini. It is the see of a bishop, and has a strong old castle, with a great many churches and convents. The river Santerno washes its walls.</P>
<P>Faenza, in Latin Faventia, a town on the river Amone, twenty-five miles south of Ravenna. It is noted for its fine earthen ware; no other part of Italy affording clay equal in goodness to that here. It is an episcopal see, under the archbishop of Ra∣venna. Over the river is a stone bridge, and in the market-place a beautiful marble fountain. Here is also a linen manufacture.</P>
<P>Servia, a small but handsome town on the Adri∣atic, about twelve miles south-east of Ravenna. Before the year 1703, it stood half an Italian mile farther from the sea; but was then removed hither for the sake of better air. It is the see of a bishop, suffragan of Ravenna. Near it, in summer, a great deal of salt is made of the sea-water, con∣veyed, by a canal, into a large hollow or reser∣voir.</P>
<P>Rimini, antiently Ariminum, and a very flou∣rishing city, but now greatly declined. It stands on the Adriatic, at the mouth of the river La Marecchia, thirty-three miles south-east from Fer∣rara, and is an episcopal see, subject to the arch∣bishop of Ravenna. Some remains of its antient
<PB N="426" REF="4330"/>
splendor are still to be seen. Without the town, towards Pesauro, is a triumphal arch, built by Augustus, all of marble, the front of which is decorated with two beautiful Corinthian pillars, and two busts. Behind the Capuchins convent are some remains of an amphitheatre, and over the Marecchia is a stately bridge of marble, built or repaired by Augustus and Tiberius. In the middle of the area before the council-house is an elegant fountain; and on both sides of the church of St. Francis are several tombs of the Mala∣testas, who were long lords of Rimini. The splendid library of count Gabalonga is well worth a traveller's notice. Formerly there was an excel∣lent harbour here, lined with marble; but it is now so choaked up with sand, that it will hardly admit small boats.</P>
<P>Forli, a town on the river Montone, fifteen miles south of Ravenna, near which antiently stood Forum Livii, whence the town took its name. It is the see of a bishop, and contains a great many churches and convents. Its terri∣tory is extremely rich and fertile.</P>
<P>The other places in the Romagna worth men∣tioning are Cesena, the see of a bishop, on the river Savio, about midway betwixt Rimini and Faenza; Sarsina, the see of a bishop, situated also on the river Savio; and Bertinoro, the see of a bishop, five miles east of Forli.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of URBINO.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy was governed by dukes of its own, until the death of Francis Maria Rovera in 1631, who leaving no issue, bequeathed it to pope Ur∣ban VIII. Neither the air nor soil are much ad∣mired. Its greatest extent, from north south, is
<PB N="427" REF="4340"/>
about fifty-six miles, and from east to west sixty-five, and the only places of any note are,</P>
<P>Urbino, the capital, situated near the Via Flami∣nia, a hundred and eighteen miles north of Rome. It is the seat of a legate and archbishop, and has a noble palace, built by its former dukes. Here the historian, Polydore Virgil, and the celebrated painter, Raphael, were born.</P>
<P>Pesaro, a pretty large and well-built city, on the Adriatic, at the mouth of the Foglia, eighteen miles north-east of Urbino. It is the see of a bishop, under the archbishop of Urbino, contains many fine churches, convents, and palaces, and gives name to a lordship, which is very pleasant and fer∣tile, and noted for its figs and wine. In a large pi∣azza is a fine statue of Urban VIII.</P>
<P>Fano, antiently Fanum Fortunae, from the fane or temple of fortune, which stood in it. Here are some remains of the triumphal arch erected to Augustus, with a small harbour, and the see of a bishop, who is immediately subject to the pope. Here are also a great number of convents and churches.</P>
<P>Senigaglia, antiently Sena Gallica, from the Galli Senones, who are said to have built it. It is now but a mean place, situated in a bad air, though the see of a bishop, with a small harbour, and a considerable annual fair. The river Misa runs through it.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The MARQUISATE of ANCONA.</HEAD>
<P>This marquisate lies on the Adriatic, and ex∣tends from east to west about twenty-four miles, and from south to north eighteen. The air is gross and unhealthy, but the soil fertile. Wax and flax are said to be whitened and prepared here with great skill. Along the coast are many towers,
<PB N="428" REF="4350"/>
mounted with cannon, to keep off the Corsairs, and on the shore are found a sort of shell-fish, called ballani, or ballari, in large spungy stones, of which some have little apertures on the surface. Twenty or thirty of these fish are some times lodged in one stone; but the taste of them is generally disagreeable to strangers. Both the fish itself and its juice are so luminous in the dark, that one may see to read by them. Even the water, in which they have been squeezed, retains a lustre for ten or twelve hours. Great quantities of them are sent to Rome. A variety of other shell-fish are found upon the coast. From its being governed, in the time of the Longobards, by a margrave, this coun∣try got the name of a marquisate. It fell under the dominion of the pope in the year 1532. The most considerable places in it are,</P>
<P>Ancona, the capital, and the see of a bishop, immediately subject to the pope, situated on the Adriatic, about one hundred and thirty miles al∣most north from Rome. It is but a mean place, and is said to have had its name from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, signifying the elbow, as being built in an angle or corner. The harbour is large and good, but the traffic inconsiderable, as it is in most of the papal dominions. Here are great numbers of Jews, who have a large synagogue, and live in a particular ward, being distinguished by a bit of red cloth in their hats. People also of all other persuasions are tolerated, but not allowed the public exercise of their religion. The ex∣change is a handsome building, and, near the har∣bour, is a triumphal arch, erected by the Roman senate, to the emperor Trajan, in gratitude for his improvement of the harbour. Though the town is fortified, and has a citadel, it is not capable of making any great defence. The harbour is se∣cured by a mole, on the head of which a few guns
<PB N="429" REF="4360"/>
are generally mounted. It is observed, that the stature and complexion of the inhabitants of Ancona, especially of the fair sex, and also of Senigallia, Fano, and Pesaro, are so greatly supe∣rior to the rest of the inhabitants of Italy, that they seem to be another people. The large laza∣retto here stands partly in the sea, and partly on the shore.</P>
<P>Loretto, a small city, fifteen miles south-east of Ancona. It is the see of a bishop; but what renders it famous throughout Christendom, is the santa casa, or holy house, in which, it is pretended, the Virgin Mary dwelt at Nazareth, and which towards the end of the thirteenth century, accord∣ing to the legend, was conveyed hither by angels. This house, which at different times has under∣gone considerable alterations and repairs, is thirty-one feet three quarters in length, thirteen feet and three inches in breadth, and eighteen feet nine inches in height. There are three doors in it, two for the people, and a third for the clergy. What∣ever the popish writers may pretend, it is built of a kind of bricks of unequal size. There is a small tower on it, in which are two small bells, rung only in violent storms of thunder and lightning, from a persuasion, that their sound only will disperse any tempest, and prevent its ill effects. On the west side is the window through which the angel came into the house. The place where the Virgin was sitting, when the angel came in, is separated from the rest by a silver ba∣lustrade. The image of the Virgin, and the Di∣vine Infant on her right arm, are of cedar; but their faces are much tarnished with the smoke of the lamps. Both of them are very richly dressed, and loaded with gold chains, rings, and the most costly jewels, having on their heads, triple crowns of gold, enriched with diamonds and pearls. To
<PB N="430" REF="4370"/>
give a particular detail of all the votive pieces and jewels, in the holy house, and treasury, would fill a volume. Let it suffice here to say, that they are of immense value, being the offerings of princes and princesses, and other great personages. Even the riches contained in the treasury are valued at nine millions of rix-dollars. Seventeen golden lamps are continually burning before the Virgin, and thirty-seven silver ones in the other parts of the house. The pavement is of square pieces of red and white marble, and the whole house is cased on the outside, with the most costly marble, adorned with statues, sculptures, and pillars of the Corinthian order; and over all is a fine spacious church, to preserve it from the in∣juries of wind and weather. Before the Reforma∣tion, the number of pilgrims, who visited the holy house in a year, is said to have often amounted to two hundred thousand; but now they seldom exceed forty or fifty thousand. They come mostly in summer, some on foot, others on asses or horses, and some in carriges. The poor pilgrims are re∣ceived into an hospital, where they are provided with beds, bread, wine, morning and evening, for three days. The church over the santa casa is of Istrian stone, and the iron grates before the se∣veral chapels in it, are said to have been forged out of the fetters of four thousand Christians, who, by the naval victory of Lepanto, in 1571, were re∣leased from Turkish slavery. Above twenty Je∣suits attend constantly, as confessors, in the church, by one or other of whom every language, spoken in Europe, is understood. A hundred and twenty-three masses are daily said in the casa santa, and the church that encloses it. The eunuchs belonging to the choir here say mass, and, on these occasions, carry their testicles about them in a small box. Lo∣retto derives its name from Laureta, the lady in
<PB N="431" REF="4380"/>
whose field the santa casa was first pitched. It was a very unwholesome place, until pope Cle∣ment VII. caused the marshes about it to be drain∣ed, the woods cut down, and the hills levelled. Its fortifications are of little importance, unless a∣gainst the sudden attacks of pirates, and there is seldom any garrison; but the number of inhabi∣tants in the town and its suburbs is computed at about seven thousand, and no sooner is a Turkish squadron known to be at sea, than they are rein∣forced by a strong garrison from the neighbouring country. The town is supplied with excellent water from the adjacent hills, by means of an aque∣duct and fountain. The annual revenue of the casa santa from lands, and other settled funds, is said to be thirty thousand scudi, exclusive of the presents and offerings of devotees. In the dispen∣sary, are thirty-eight gallipots, with covers, of Fayence porcelain, highly valued for the paintings on them, which are said to have been done by Ra∣phael. The people of Loretto, besides what they get by keeping inns, public-houses, and lodging strangers, make medals, crucifixes, images of the Virgin, painted paper caps, ribbons, and rosaries, which are bought by the pilgrims, as amulets for the head-ach, fits, and other diseases. The town is about a mile in circumfrence. There is a fine prospect from it towards the sea; and from Monte Reale in the neighbourhood, the mountains of Croatia, though a hundred and fifty miles off, may be seen in a morning, in clear weather. In the cellar of the casa santa, are generally upwards of a hundred and forty very large casks of different sorts of wine. Travellers are pestered with swarms of beggars in the town and country about Loretto.</P>
<P>The only other towns worth mentioning in this marquisate, are Recanati, Mecerata, Camerino, Fermo, and Ascoli, with Fabriano, which though
<PB N="432" REF="4390"/>
called a village, is equal to many cities, and fa∣mous for a paper manufacture.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The TERRITORY of PERUGIA.</HEAD>
<P>The utmost extent of this territory, from north to south, is not above twenty-eight miles, and from east to west about thirty. It contains the lake antiently called Lacus Thrasimenus, and now Lago di Perugia, near which Hannibal defeated the Romans, under the command of the consul Flaminius. The only place in it worth mention∣ing, is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Perugia, which was antiently called Perusia, and suffered the most dreadful calamities during the triumvirate of Augustus and his colleagues. It was also, after a seven years siege, taken and de∣stroyed by Totila, king of the Goths; but was afterwards rebuilt by Narses. In the ninth cen∣tury the French took it, and gave it to the holy see, to which it hath belonged ever since, and is now the see of a bishop, and has an university, with two academies, three colleges, several churches, and a citadel, standing about sixty-one miles almost north-west from Rome. It is also noted for a very good white wine, as clear as rock∣water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The TERRITORY of ORVIETO.</HEAD>
<P>The territory of Orvieto, which is but of a small extent, contains the lake antiently called Lacus Volsiniensis, and now the lake of Bolsena, from the same town, stiled antiently Volsinium, and now Bolsena. Orvieto, the capital of this di∣strict, and the only place, besides Aquapendente, worth mentioning, is the see of a bishop, has se∣veral churches and convents, and stands forty
<PB N="433" REF="4400"/>
miles north-west from Rome. The town is sup∣plied with water from a well, cut into the rock, two hundred and fifty cubits deep. Aquapen∣dente, though a bishopric, is but a mean place, twelve miles to the west of Orvieto.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of SPOLETO.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy extends from north to south about forty-seven miles, and about sixty-five from west to east. The soil of a great part of it is low and fenny, yet, in general, rich and fertile. The places of most note are,</P>
<P>Spoleto, antiently one of the most celebrated municipal towns in Italy, and even now the capi∣tal of the duchy. It stands seventy miles north of Rome, and is noted for an aqueduct, by which water, to supply the city and castle, is conveyed from Mount St. Francis over a valley. There is also a bridge laid over a valley, betwixt the city and castle. The number of convents, churches, hermitages, and fraternities here is very conside∣rable. Here also is the see of a bishop, who is im∣mediately subject to the pope. In the neighbouring mountains are found truffles in great plenty.</P>
<P>Foligno, antiently Fulginium, a smàll town, fourteen miles north-west of Spoleto. Here are some manufactures and trade, and a famed fair which lasts a month. It is the see of a bishop, and the neighbouring country is extremely beau∣tiful.</P>
<P>Narni, antiently Narnia, a poor town, fourteen miles south-west from Spoleto. It is the see of a bishop, and is supplied with water by a noble a∣queduct, fifteen miles long. But the greatest cu∣riosity here, is the remains of a grand marble bridge, built, as it is said, by Augustus, over the river Nera, so as to join two opposite mountains.
<PB N="434" REF="4410"/>
This was the birth-place of the emperor Nerva. The neighbouring country is extremely beautiful, abounding with vines, fig, peach, and olive∣trees, fine melons, prodigious large turnips, and other fruits. Of the grapes, there is a particular sort here without stones, called uvae passae, or passarinae.</P>
<P>Terni, antiently stiled Interamna, from its situ∣ation betwixt two branches of the river Nera. It is a pretty well built, and well inhabited town, and the see of a bishop, situated about twelve miles south from Spoleto, and thirty-four north from Rome. The emperors Tacitus and Florianus, and Tacitus the historian, were born here. The ruins also of an antient theatre are still visible; and not far from hence is the famous cascade form∣ed by the fall of the river Velino, which rushes down a precipice a hundred yards high. The mist about the cascade looks, at a distance, like clouds of smoke ascending from some vast furnace, and distils in a perpetual small rain on all the places that lie near it. The noise made by it is altogether astonishing. About six or seven miles also from Terni is Mount Eolo, from the cavities of which in summer issues a strong cooling wind, which the inhabitants of the little town of Cesi, which stands hard by, convey by pipes into their houses, in the same manner as water.</P>
<P>There are several other little towns in the duchy, particularly Assisio, where St. Francis was born; Nocera, antiently Nuceria, a bishopric, and noted for its hot baths; Spello, antiently Hispellum, where are some remains of antiquity; Bevagna, antiently Mevania, near the source of the famous river Clitumnus, where is the chapel of St. Salva∣dore, supposed to have been formerly the temple of Clitumnus; Todi, antiently Tuder; Amelia, an∣tiently Ameria; Otricolo, near where the old Sa∣bine
<PB N="435" REF="4420"/>
town Ocrea, or Ocriculum stood; Rieti, an∣tiently Reate, and Norcia, antiently Nursia.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of SABINA.</HEAD>
<P>This province, a part of the territories of the antient Sabines, is reckoned about twenty-six miles in length, and near as many in breadth. The soil is very rich and fertile, and well watered. There are two or three inconsiderable market-towns in it, viz. Magliano, Monte-Rotondo, Palombaro, and Vicovaro.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of CASTRO, and EARLDOM of RONCIGLIONE.</HEAD>
<P>These territories belonged formerly to the house of Farnese; but were at last annexed to the papal dominions, in lieu of a debt, for which they had been mortgaged, but never redeemed. They are naturally fertile in corn and fruit, but ill peopled, and worse cultivated. The only places in them worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Castro, which was formerly a handsome town; but, in the year 1646, was destroyed by pope In∣nocent X. because the inhabitants had murdered the bishop he had sent them. In the duchy to which it still gives name, lies a part of the lake of Bolsena, with two islands, in one of which Ama∣lasuntha, the daughter of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, was confined, and afterwards mur∣dered, by order of her cousin Theodat, whom she had associated with her in the government.</P>
<P>Ronciglione, a small town, but the capital of the earldom to which it gives name. Not far from hence is the fine palace of Caprarola.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="436" REF="4430"/>
<HEAD>The PATRIMONY of ST. PETER.</HEAD>
<P>So called from a pretended grant of it made by Constantine the Great to Sylvester, bishop of Rome, in 324, for the maintenance of the church of St. Peter, and its bishops; but this grant, in fact, is said to have been made by the countess Matilda, in the year 1077. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Viterbo, the capital, thirty-three miles north∣west of Rome. It is pretty large, well built, and contains a great number of churches and convents; but that of the inhabitants is but small, consider∣ing its extent. It is the see of a bishop, who is im∣mediately under the pope. Here are two acade∣mies of wits, the one called Gly Ostinati, and the other Gli Ardenti. The number of the inhabi∣tants is said to be about sixteen thousand, a consi∣derable part of whom consists of priests, and monks of all orders. Not far from the town is a warm mineral spring.</P>
<P>Bolsena, a town delightfully situated on the lake to which it gives name, but otherwise of little note. Near it, on an eminence, are the ruins of the antient Volsinium.</P>
<P>Monte Fiascone, a mean place on a mountain, about thirty-four miles north of Rome, and noted for its white muscadel wine. Its name is thought to be derived from the Falisci, who formerly in∣habited the adjacent country.</P>
<P>Civita Castellana, a small town, about twenty miles north-west from Rome. It is said to be the antient Falerios, once the capital of the Falisci, and stands near the conflux of the Triglia and Te∣vere. Here is a bridge of extraordinary height, built over a deep narrow valley.</P>
<P>Civita Vecchia, a fortified sea-port, about thirty miles north-west from Rome. The harbour is

<HEAD>The CAMPAGNA, or CAMPANIA DI ROMA.</HEAD>
<P>This country is what the antient Romans called Latium, or at least the greater part of it. The air is said to be unwholesome, which is partly owing to the Pomptine marshes and many lakes in it, and partly to a rich, but uncultivated soil, the inhabi∣tants being few, and these poor, lazy, and indo∣lent. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Rome, antiently the capital and seat of the Ro∣man empire, and now the head of the Roman ca∣tholic religion. What a melancholy reverse! Rome that was once the abode and nursery of heroes, and
<PB N="438" REF="4450"/>
of all that was great and noble in human nature, is now a nest of drones; a nursery of vermin, that prey upon the community; a scene of the grossest priest craft; of the most ridiculous farces, under the name of religion; of ecclesiastical tyranny, and the most wanton abuse of the blind zeal, credulity, fanaticism, and ignorance, of a weak, deluded laity. Rome, after she had lost her liberty, sunk into the utmost degeneracy, slavery, and corrup∣tion, and was trampled under foot by a set of the vilest monsters and tyrants that ever disgraced hu∣man nature: but her thraldom was not then greater under her secular, than it is now under her spiri∣tual masters. Rome is generally believed to have been founded by Romulus, upwards of seven hun∣dred years before Christ, after which it was gradu∣ally enlarged, till it took up the following twelve, or rather thirteen hills, viz. Monte Capitolino, Pa∣latino, Aventino, Celio, Esquilino, Viminale, Quirinale, Monte Cavallo, Janiculo, Pincino, Vaticano, Citorio, and Giardino; but its figure and situation have been often changed, in conse∣quence of the many sieges it hath sustained. It is thought the walls of the modern Rome take in nearly the same extent of ground as the antient; but the difference between the number of buildings on this spot is very great, one half of modern Rome lying waste, or occupied with gardens, fields, meadows, and vineyards. One may walk quite round the city in three or four hours at most, the circumference being reckoned about thirteen Ita∣lian miles. With regard to the number of the in∣habitants, modern Rome is also greatly inferior to the antient; for, in 1709, the whole of these a∣mounted only to one hundred thirty-eight thousand five hundred and sixty-eight; among which were forty bishops, two thousand six hundred and eighty∣six priests, three thousand five hundred and fifty-nine
<PB N="439" REF="4460"/>
monks, one thousand eight hundred and four∣teen nuns, three hundred ninety-three courtesans, about eight or nine thousand Jews, and fourteen Moors. In 1714 the number was increased to one hundred and forty-three thousand. In external splendor, and the beauty of its temples and palaces, modern Rome is thought by the most judicious travellers to excel the antient. There was nothing in antient Rome to be compared with St. Peter's church in the modern. That Rome was able to recover itself after so many calamities and devasta∣tions, will not be matter of surprize, if we consider the prodigious sums that it has so long annually drawn from all countries of the popish persuasion. These sums, though still considerable, have been continually decreasing since the Reformation. The surface of the ground on which Rome was origi∣nally founded, is surprisingly altered. At present it is difficult to distinguish the seven hills on which it was first built, the low grounds being almost filled up with the ruins of the antient streets and houses, and the great quantities of earth washed down from the hills by the violence of rains. Antiently the suburbs extended a vast way on all sides, and made the city appear almost boundless; but it is quite otherwise now, the country about Rome being al∣most a desert. To this, and other causes, it is owing, that the air is none of the most wholesome, especially during the summer heats, when few go abroad in the day-time. No city at present in the world surpasses, or indeed equals Rome, for the multiplicity of fine fountains, noble edifices, anti∣quities, curiosities, paintings, statues, and sculp∣tures. To particularize these would fill a vo∣lume: besides, they have already been described at large by several modern authors, particularly Keysler. The city stands on the Tyber, ten miles from the Tuscan sea, three hundred and
<PB N="440" REF="4470"/>
eighty from Vienna, five hundred and sixty from Paris, seven hundred and forty from Amsterdam, eight hundred and ten from London, and nine hundred from Madrid. The Tyber is subject to frequent inundations, by which it often does great damage. A small part of the city is separated from the other by the river, and is therefore called Trastevere, or beyond the Tyber. There are seve∣ral bridges over the river, a great number of towers on the walls, and twenty gates. The remains of Rome's antient grandeur consist of statues, co∣lossus's, temples, palaces, theatres, naumachias, triumphal arches, cirques, columns, obelisks, foun∣tains, aqueducts, mausoleums, thermae, or hot∣baths, and other structures. Of modern buildings, the splendid churches and palaces are the most re∣markable. Mr. Addison says, it is almost impos∣sible for a man to form in his imagination such beautiful and glorious scenes, as are to be met with in several of the Roman churches and chapels. This gentleman tells us also, that no part of the anti∣quities of Rome pleased him so much as the antient statues, of which there is still an incredible variety. Next to the statues he says, there is nothing more surprising, than the amazing variety of antient pil∣lars of so many kinds of marble. Rome is said to be well paved, but not well lighted, nor kept very clean. Two thirds of the houses are the property of the churches, convents, and alms-houses. Pro∣testants are not obliged to kneel at the elevation of the host, or at meeting the eucharist in the streets; and they may have flesh meat always at the inns, even during Lent. Here are a great many acade∣mies for promoting arts and sciences, besides the university. The carnival here is only during the eight days before Lent, and there are no such scenes of riot as at Venice: prostitutes, however, are publicly tolerated. To maintain good order

there is a body of three hundred Sbirri, or Halber∣deers, under their Barigella, or Colonel. There is little or no trade carried on in Rome, but a vast deal of money is spent by travellers and other strangers. The principal modern structures are the church of St. Peter, and the other churches; the aqueducts and fountains; the Vatican, and the other palaces; the Campidolio, where the Ro∣man senate resides, &amp;c. The principal remains of antiquity are the pila miliaria, of fine marble; the equestrian brass statue of Marcus Aurelius Anto∣ninus; the marble monument of the emperor Alex∣ander Severus; marble busts of the emperors and their consorts; three brick arches of the temple of peace, built by the emperor Vespasian, and that of Constantine the Great; the coliseo, or amphithe∣atre, built by the emperor Vespasian; the trium∣phal arch of Septimus Severus and of Galienus; the circus of Antoninus Caracalla; some parts of the cloaca-maxima; the columna Antonina, re∣presenting the principal actions of Marcus Aure∣lius; the columna Trajani, or Trajan's pillar; some fragments of the curia, or palace of Anto∣ninus Pius, and of Narva's forum; the mauso∣laeum of Augustus, in the Strada Pontifici; the remains of the emperor Severus's tomb without St. John's gate; the pyramid of Caius Cestus near St. Paul's gate; the porphyry coffin of St. Helen, and the original statue of Constantine the Great, in the church of St. John of Lateran; a font of ori∣ental granite, in the chapel of St. Giovanni in fonte, said to have been erected by Constantine the Great; an Egyptian obelisk near the church of St. Maria Maggiore; the stately remains of Dioclesian's baths; the celebrated pantheon; the obelisks of Sesostris and Augustus by the Clemen∣tine college; the church of St. Paulo fuori della Mura, said to have been built by Constantine the

Great; the Farnese Hercules, in white marble, of a Collossean size, and exquisite workmanship, in a court of the Farnese palace, and an admirable group cut out of one block of marble, in another court of the same palace. Besides these there are a great many more, which our proposed brevity will not allow us to take any further notice of. Here is a great number of rich and well regulated hospitals. Near the church of St. Sebastiano alle Catacombe, are the most spacious of the catacombs, where the Christians, who never burned their dead, and such of the pagan Romans, as could not af∣ford the expence of burning, were buried. Along the Via Appia, without St. Sebastian's-gate, were the tombs of the principal families of Rome, which at present are used for cellars and store-houses, by the gardeners and vinedressers.</P>
<P>Ostia, antiently a flourishing city, and the port of Rome, situated on the east arm of the Tyber, twelve miles south of Rome. Since the Tyber changed its course, this channel, and consequently the harbour, is become almost dry: in consequence of which, and the badness of the air, this place is dwindled to a poor village, yet is the see of a bishop, who is always dean of the college of cardinals, and keeps a priest to officiate for him.</P>
<P>Terracina, antiently called Anxur, is situated on the brow of a hill, forty-six miles from Rome, to the south-east. The whole country hereabouts has the appearance of a garden; but the town is small, poor, ill-built, and worse inhabited; not∣withstanding it is the see of a bishop, standing but a few miles from the coast, where it had once a harbour. The air is said to be unwholesome. Near it are some remains of the temple of Janus, with the palaces of Julius Caesar and Adrian, and the Via Appia.</P>

Palestrina, antiently Praeneste, standing very high, like most towns in Italy, for the benefit of the cool breezes; for which reason Virgil calls it Altum, and Horace, Frigidum Praeneste. There are still some remains here of the temple of For∣tune. It lies about twenty-two miles east of Rome, is the see of a bishop, and a dukedom, belonging to the Colonna family.</P>
<P>Tivoli, antiently Tibur, lies along the brow of a hill, about twenty-three miles east of Rome. It is now but a mean place, but is the see of a bishop, holding immediately of the pope. In the town is a villa belonging to the duke of Modena, with two Egyptian images of granite; and, in its neighbourhood, are many remains of Roman villas, some quarries of free-stone, and the cascade of the river Tiverone, formerly Anio, which makes an astonishing noise. Near it also is the Lago di Bagni, or Solfatara, whence the river Solfatara issues, and in which are some small floating islands, that are driven about by the wind. The water of the lake and river are strongly impregnated with sul∣phur, and pretty hot, especially towards the bottom.</P>

<HEAD>The REPUBLIC of St. MARINO.</HEAD>
<P>This small republic consists only of a mountain, and a few hillocks, that lie scattered about the bot∣tom of it. The number of the inhabitants is about five thousand. The mountain yields good wine, but they have no other than rain or snow water. The founder of the republic was a Dalmatian, and a mason, who, upwards of thirteen hundred years ago, turned hermit, and retired to this mountain. Here his devotion and austerity, and in consequence of that, his reputation for sanctity, were such, that the princess of the country made him a present of the mountain, on which many, out of veneration for the saint, soon after, took up their abode. Thus was the foundation laid of the town and re∣public, which still bears the name of the saint. The town stands on the top of the mountain, and there is only one way by which it can be come at. In the whole territory are only three castles, three
<PB N="445" REF="4520"/>
convents, and five churches. The largest of the churches is dedicated to the saint, and contains his ashes and his statue. He is looked upon as the greatest saint, next to the blessed Virgin; and to speak disrespectfully of him is accounted blas∣phemy, and punished as such. The republic is under the protection of the pope. All that are ca∣pable of bearing arms are exercised, and ready at a minute's call. In the ordinary course of govern∣ment, the administration is in the hands of the council of sixty, which, notwithstanding its name, consists only of forty; one half of the members of which are of the noble families, and the other of the plebeian: on extraordinary occasions, however, the arengo, in which every house has its representative, is called together. The two principal officers are the capitaneos, who are chosen every half year; and next to them is the commissary, who judges in civil and criminal matters, and is joined in com∣mission with the capitaneos: both he and the phy∣sician must be foreigners, and both have their sala∣ries out of the public stock. When any person, after due summons, neglects to assist at the coun∣cil, according to their statute-book, he is to be fined in about a penny English; and when an am∣bassador is to be sent to any foreign state, he is to be allowed about a shilling a day.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGDOM of NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P>This kingdom, by far the largest state in Italy, and comprehending in it the antient countries of Samnium, Campania, Apulia, and Magna Graecia, hath its present name from its capital. Formerly, it was sometimes called Sicily on this side the Pha∣ro, viz. of Messina, whence the present king, who is also possessed of Sicily, is called king of the Two Sicilies. It is bounded on all sides by the Mediter∣ranean
<PB N="446" REF="4530"/>
and the Adriatic, except on the north-east, where it terminates on the Ecclesiastical State. Its greatest length, from south-east to north west, is about two hundred and eighty English miles; and its breadth, from the north-east to the south-west, from ninety-six to an hundred and twenty.</P>
<P>The air of this country is extremely hot, espe∣cially in July, August, and September. In winter there is seldom any ice or snow, except on the mountains. On account of its fertility, it is justly termed an earthly paradise; for it abounds with all sorts of grain; the finest fruit and garden pro∣ductions, of every kind; with rice, flax, oil, and wine, in the greatest plenty and perfection. It af∣fords also saffron, manna, alum, vitriol, sulphur, rock-crystal, marble, and several sorts of minerals, together with fine wool, and silk. The horses of this country are famous, and the flocks and herds very numerous. Besides these products, of which a considerable part is exported, there are manufac∣tures of snuff, soap, and glass-ware. Waistcoats, caps, stockings, and gloves, are also made of the hair or filaments of a shell-fish, which are warmer than those of wool, and of a beautiful glossy green. In this kingdom likewise is found that called the Phrygian stone, or pietra fungifera, which, being laid in a damp shady place, will yield mushrooms, sometimes of a very large size, especially if the stone is sprinkled with hot water.</P>
<P>As to the mountains of this country, the princi∣pal are those of the Apennine, which traverse it from south to north; and Mount Vesuvius, which, as is well known, is a noted volcano, five Italian miles from Naples. The side of this mountain next the sea yields wine, particularly the two famed wines, called Vino Greco, and Lachrymae Christi. One of the greatest inconveniencies to which this kingdom is ex∣posed is earthquakes, which the eruptions of Mount
<PB N="447" REF="4540"/>
Vesuvius contribute, in some measure, to prevent. Another inconveniency, which, however, is com∣mon to it with other hot countries, is the great number of reptiles and insects, of which some are venomous, as scorpions, and a kind of spiders, call∣ed tarantulas, from the city of Tarento, where they are more common, and more dangerous, than in other parts.</P>
<P>With respect to religion, it is on a very bad foot∣ing here. The number of convents and monaste∣ries is really astonishing. It is said, the clergy and convents possess two thirds of the whole kingdom: nay, some maintain, that were the kingdom divided into five parts, four would be found in the hands of the church. Notwithstanding this power and in∣fluence of the clergy, they have not been able hi∣therto to get the inquisition established here. In the year 1731, measures were also taken for lessen∣ing the number of convents; and, very lately, the order of Jesuits hath been suppressed. The papal bulls cannot be made public without the king's permission; nor are protestants compelled to kneel in the churches, or at the meeting the host; and in Lent they can very easily procure flesh∣meat. In the year 1740, the Jews were allowed to settle in the kingdom, during the term of fifty years, and several privileges were granted them du∣ring that period; at the expiration of which, the grant was to be supposed to be renewed, unless they were expresly ordered to quit the country.</P>
<P>The revenue of the kingdom is generally com∣puted at three millions of crowns; but, as Mr. Addison observes, there is no country in Europe which pays greater taxes, and where, at the same time, the public is less the better for them, most of them going to the enriching of the private persons to whom they are mortgaged.</P>
<P><PB N="448" REF="4550"/>
With respect to the money of Naples, three qua∣trini make one grana; ten grana one carlino; two carlini one taro; five taro, or ten carlini, one du∣cato; twenty-five carlini one ongaro; twenty-six one zechino; and forty-five a Spanish pistole.</P>
<P>The military force of this kingdom is said to con∣sist of about thirty-thousand men, of which the Swiss regiments are the best. As to the marine, it consists only of a few gallies. The only order here is that of St. Januarius, which was instituted by Don Carlos, in the year 1738.</P>
<P>The king of Naples, or of the Two Sicilies, is an hereditary monarch. The high colleges are the council of state, the privy-council, the treasury, the Sicily-council, the council of war, &amp;c. This king∣dom is a papal fief; and the king, in ackowledg∣ment of the pope's feudal right, sends him, every year, a white palfry, and a purse of six thousand ducats. The title of the king's eldest son is prince of Cala∣bria. The number both of the high and low nobility in the kingdom of Naples is very great; but their incomes, in general, are very slender. The higher nobles consist of princes, dukes, marquisses, and barons. The general assembly of the states, con∣sisting of the nobility and commons, is summoned, every two years, to meet at the capital, to deliberate on the customary free gift to the crown.</P>
<P>Naples had kings of its own, after the ex∣pulsion of the Saracens, until about the year 1504, when it fell under the dominion of Spain; the kings of Spain continued masters of it until 1707, when the Spaniards were dispossessed by the Imperialists; and, in 1713, the kingdom was confirmed to the emperor Charles VI. by the treaty of Utrecht; but, in 1734, the Spaniards again made themselves masters both of Naples and Sicily, which, in 1736, were formally ceded to Don Car∣los, now king of Spain, and his heirs male and fe∣male,
<PB N="449" REF="4560"/>
in consequence of which, one of his sons is now king of the Two Sicilies.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this country bear but an in∣different character among other nations; but if they are really as defective in this respect as they are represented, it is undoubtedly, in some measure at least, owing to the oppression and slavery under which they groan, both from their civil and eccle∣siastic governors. This kingdom is divided into twelve provinces or jurisdictions, in which the prin∣cipal places are,</P>
<P>Naples, antiently Parthenope, afterwards Nea∣polis, the capital of the kingdom, lying in the province called Terra di Lavora, which is the richest and best inhabited of the whole kingdom, and comprehends a part of the antient Campania Felix, or the happy. This city is said to be the first for strength and neatness, and the third, for bigness, in all Italy. It is most advantageously situated, having a delicious country on one side, and a noble bay of the Mediterranean on the other, with an excellent harbour. The circumference, including the suburbs, is said not to be less than eighteen Italian miles, and the number of the in∣habitants therein above four hundred thousand. The houses are of stone, flat-roofed, and generally lofty and uniform; but many of them have bal∣conies, with lattice windows. The streets are well paved; but they are not lighted at night, and, in the day-time, are disfigured, in many places, by stalls, on which provisions are exposed to sale. Here are a great number of fine churches, convents, fountains, and palaces of the nobility, many of whom constantly reside here. It is usual to walk on the tops of the houses in the evenings, to breathe the sweet cool air, after a hot sultry day. The climate here is so mild and warm, even in win∣ter, that plenty of green pease, artichokes, asparagus,
<PB N="450" REF="4570"/>
and other vegetables may be had so early as the beginning of the new year, and even all the winter. This city swarms with monks and nuns of all sorts, to such a degree, that there are no less than nineteen convents of the Dominicans alone, eighteen of the Franciscans, eight of the Augustines, and in proportion of the rest. The magnificence of many of the churches exceeds imagination. In a cloyster of the Carthusian monastery is a crucifix, said to be done by Mi∣chael Angelo, of inimitable workmanship. The fortifications of Naples are very strong, both towards the land and the sea, there being no less than five castles: yet the city is far from being secure from a bombardment; for the sea is so deep, that a large vessel may come up to the very mole, and there is nothing to prevent an enemy's approaches on that side, but a few gallies, the mole, and two small castles. Pictures, statues, and antiquities are not so common in Naples, as might be expected in so great and antient a city, many of the most valuable pieces having been sent to Spain by the viceroys. There are several very delightful prospects about Naples, especially from some of the religious houses. The bay is one of the finest in the world, being almost of a round figure, of about thirty miles in the diameter, and three parts of it sheltered with a noble circuit of woods and mountains. The city stands in the bosom of this bay, in as pleasant a situation, per∣haps, as in the world. Mr. Keysler says, they reckon about eighteen thousand donne libere, or courtezans, in the city. Though the com∣mon people are generally so lazy, as to prefer beggary or robbing to labour; yet there are some flourishing manufactures here, and a brisk trade. The city is supplied with a vast quantity of water, by means of a very costly aqueduct, from the foot
<PB N="451" REF="4580"/>
of mount Vesuvius. Mr. Addison says, it is incredible how great a multitude of retainers to the law there are in Naples, who find continual em∣ployment from the fiery temper of the inhabitants. There are five piazzas or squares in the city, ap∣propriated to the nobility, viz. those called Ca∣puana, Nido, Montagna, Porto, and Porta Nova. Of all the palaces, that of the king is not only the most magnificent, but also in the best stile of architecture. The cathedral, though Gothic, is a very grand splendid edifice. It is here that the head and blood of St. Januarius, the tutelary saint of Naples are kept, the latter in two glass or crystal vials. The pretended liquefaction of the dried blood, as soon as brought near the head of the saint, is a thing well known; Mr. Addison says, it is one of the most bungling tricks he ever saw. The harbour is spacious, and kept in good repair. It is fortified with a mole, which runs above a quarter of mile into the sea, and, at the extremity, has a high lantern, to direct ships safely into the harbour. Luxury here is restrained by severe sumptuary laws, and the women are more closely confined than in any other city of Italy. Here is an university and two acade∣mies of wits, the one called Gli Ardenti, and the other Gli Otiosi. The nunnery for ladies of quality is said to be the largest in the whole world, containing no less than three hundred and fifty nuns, besides servants. The mount of Piety, or the office for advancing money to the poor, on pledges, at a low interest, or without any, has an income of upwards of fifty thousand ducats. The arsenal is said to contain arms for fifty thousand men. The walls of the city consist of hard black quarry stones, called piperno. Instead of ice, vast quantities of snow are used for cooling their li∣quors, not so much as water being drank without
<PB N="452" REF="4590"/>
it; so that, it is said, a scarcity of it would as soon occasion a mutiny, as a dearth of corn or provi∣sions. Certain persons, who farm the monopoly of it from the government, supply the city all the year round from a mountain about eighteen miles off, at so much the pound. Naples stands one hundred and ten miles south-east from Rome, one hundred and sixty-four north-east from Palermo in Sicily, two hundred and seventeen south-east from Florence, and three hundred from Venice.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of this city are several re∣markable particulars, which tho' they have been often described by travellers, must not be passed over without any notice. Of these, the chief are mount Vesuvius, a noted volcano, the grotto of Pau∣selipo, the lago d'Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ono, grotto del Cani, and Solfatara. Vesuvius is five Italian miles from Naples: one side of it, as we observed already, produces several sorts of wine; but the south and west sides, as well as the top, are covered with black cinders and ashes. From the foot of the mountain to the fummit, are about three Italian miles. The ascent, by reason of the steepness of the mountain, and the loose ashes, is very toilsome and tedious; but there are some peasants that live about the mountain, who, for a small matter, assist travellers in clambering up: they wear lea∣thern belts, which the strangers take hold of, in order to render their ascent more easy. From the volcano often issues a stream of lava, or a com∣position of me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted metals, sulphur, minerals, &amp;c. which often does a great deal of damage, running down the side of the mountain like a river, and carrying all before it. From chymical experi∣ments it appears, that the stones, ejected by Ve∣suvius, are impregnated with bitumen, sulphur, vitriol, alum, antimony, arsenic, and other mine∣rals and fossils. As one approaches the volcano,
<PB N="453" REF="4600"/>
if the mountain is actually belching out matter' the ashes grow hotter and hotter; at the same time a horrid noise is heard, like the explosion of a whole battery of cannon, and a rumbling under feet, like the continual boiling of a large caldron. Not a tree or shrub is to be seen on the top of the mountain: the hollow, whence the eruptions issue, is very large, and goes shelving down on all sides. When the mountain is quiet this hollow may be safely looked into; but even then it is generally filled with smoke. During the eruptions, it is filled with glowing and meited matter, which, as it boils over in any part, runs down the sides of the mountain like a torrent. At these times also vast quantities of ashes, cinders, and huge stones are thrown out. Not far from this mountain is the village of Portici, where is a royal palace, with an amazing collection of antiquities, mostly dug out of the ruins of the antient city of Heraclea, or Herculaneum, which stood near this spot, and was destroyed partly by an earthquake, and partly by an eruption of mount Vesuvius. Several volumes, giving an account of these antiquities, have been published; and the digging is still continued.</P>
<P>In those parts of the sea not far from the roots of Vesuvius, is found sometimes a very fragrant oil, which is sold dear, and makes a rich perfume. It is skimmed off the surface of the sea, in calm warm weather, into boats, and afterwards put into pots and jars.</P>
<P>In the road leading from the suburbs of Chiaia to the grotto del Monte di Pausilipo, is the remains of a tomb or mausoleum, supposed to be that of Virgil, but without any foundation: it was original∣ly in the form of a pyramid, but now resembles a large oven. It is certain, says Mr. Addison, that Virgil was buried at Naples, but almost as certain, that his tomb stood on the other side of the town.
<PB N="454" REF="4610"/>
At Sorrento, near mount Vesuvius, are shewn some laurel-trees, which, it is pretended, grew up spontaneously out of the ruins of the house in which the celebrated poet Torquato Tasso is said to have been born.</P>
<P>That called the grotto or cave of Pausilipo, lies betwixt Naples and Puzzuolo, or Puteoli. It is a broad subterraneous road, hewn through a moun∣tain in a straight line. On each side of the moun∣tain, two vent-holes are cut near the middle for the admission of air and light, quite through the roof of the grotto, which, at the entrance at each end, is near a hundred feet high, but towards the middle much lower; the breadth is between eighteen and twenty feet, and the length something above half an Italian mile; it is paved with broad stones, like the streets of Naples: at coming out of the grotto the road turns to the right hand, and brings one to the lake of Agnano, which of is a circular figure, and about an Italian mile in circumference. On this lake stand the sudatories of St. Germano, which are stone apartments, where the hot steams, arising from the earth, soon produce a profuse sweat on those that use them. They are said to be efficaci∣ous in the gout, weakness of the limbs, venereal infections, and internal imposthumes. In a rock near the banks of the lake is also the Grotto del Cane, or Dog's-grotto, a dog being the animal commonly pitched upon, to shew strangers the surprizing effect of the vapour in this cavity; and hard by it is a hut where dogs are actually kept for that purpose. The vapour floats within a foot of the surface of the grotto, in which, if a dog has his nose held, he soon loses all signs of life; but if brought into the open air, or thrown into the lake, he quickly recovers, if he is not quite suffocated; but these sulphureous exhalations are no less fatal to other animals. To enumerate the different baths
<PB N="455" REF="4620"/>
to be met with in a country that so much abounds with sulphur, and where there is scarce a disease that has not one adapted to it, would be but an endless and useless labour. The monte Secco, or Solfatara, as it is commonly called, may be deemed Vesuvius in miniature. Though these two moun∣tains are about eight miles distant from one ano∣ther, yet they seem to have a communication, it having been remarked, that the more violent the eruptions of Vesuvius are, the less is the smoke that proceeds from Solfatara, and é contra. On the surface of the latter, are several fissures, which are hot, and continually emit smoke, more or less. The stones near the holes, or cracks, seem to be in continual motion; and small stones dropt into them are ejected to the height of twelve feet. The hot vapour, issuing through these apertures, is said to be very salutary in pains of the eyes, ears, limbs, and stomach, the head-ach, bilious fevers, and sterility. From the earth, stones, and ashes of this mountain, are extracted sulphur, vitriol of a sapphire colour, and the best kind of alum. The summit of the mountain, which was antiently in the form of a cone, is now sunk into a concave oval. It is so hollow underneath, that, in several places, the effect of stamping on the ground, with the foot, is exactly the same as that of striking a∣gainst a vault. Not far from hence is an amphi∣theatre, commonly called Coliseo.</P>
<P>Puzzuolo or Puteoli, antiently a famous city, but now only a small town, having suffered much by earthquakes, wars, and irrruptions of the sea. It was formerly the best port on all this coast; and the stately ruins about it, with the coins, seals, &amp;c. thrown up by the waves, sufficiently demonstrate its former magnificence. It is eight Italian miles from Naples; and derives its name either from putei, pits, or from the putor, i. e. stench, of the sulphu∣reous
<PB N="456" REF="4630"/>
vapours. It is the see of a bishop, and the cathedral, which was formerly a Pagan temple, is built of large blocks of marble. Puteoli glories in being the place where the first Christian com∣munity in Italy was formed; for St. Paul, in his journey to Rome, we are told, found brethren in it. Here is a very commodious harbour, in which are fourteen piers, or pillars, rising above the surface of the water, which, in the time of the Romans, were joined by arches, in order to guard the city and harbour against the violence of the waves. In the neighbourhood of Puzzuolo, along the coast, are several warm baths, impregnated with alum, cop∣peras, and iron. Hard by also may be seen the ruins of Cicero's villa; and, not far from thence, another old edifice, said to have been the country∣seat of Lentulus. The sea has overwhelmed many palaces here, which may be seen at the bottom of the water in a calm day. A little from Puzzuolo lies the Lucrine lake, which is now but a puddle in comparison of what it once was, having been re∣duced to its present condition by a sudden earth∣quake, that happened in the year 1538; and swal∣lowed up the town of Tripergola, with all its fine villas, gardens, and hot-baths; threw up that call∣ed the Monte Nuovo; filled up part of the lake Averno, which is about a mile from the other; and, in short, quite changed the face of the neigh∣bouring country from what it was formerly. The lake Avernus, formerly famous for its poisonous steams, is now plentifully stocked with fish and fowl. Mount Gaurus, which stands hard by, but is called at present Monte Barbaro, from one of the fruitfullest spots in Italy, is now one of the most barren. The earth of Puteoli has this peculiar pro∣perty, that it hardens in the water, and, after lying in it some time, looks more like stone than earth.
<PB N="457" REF="4640"/>
Between the Lucrine lake and that of Averno, are the thermae Neronis, or hot-baths of Nero, so famed in history. Eastward from the lake Averno is the grotto or cave of the Cumean sybil, the entrance of which is very low, but the rest of a considerable height, and the length several hundred paces, after which the passage is stopped by a wall built, as some say, on purpose, because it would be dangerous to proceed any farther, on account of the dampness of the place; for this cave is said to have reached to Cumae, which is nine miles distant, where, we are told, the other end is to be seen, but quite choaked up with rubbish. At a little distance from this cave is the stinking fen or lake, called Acheron or Palus Acherusia, and by Virgil, from its black wa∣ter, Palus Tenebrosa. It is now called Lago del∣la Colluccia, or del Fusaro, and has a communica∣tion with the sea by a canal, whence its water is much less offensive than formerly. The next thing remarkable here is the Elysian Fields, extremely delightful in respect of their situation, and the sweetness of the climate; but the whole spot is now covered with bushes, briars, and ruins of an∣tient monuments, it having been a famed burying-place in the times of the Romans. Between Averno and Cumae is also part of the Via Appia, where two-hills, are joined by means of a stately arch, called Arco-felice, built of bricks. After passing the Arco-felice, a narrow way leads to the remains of an antient temple, which at present is called II Tempio del Giganti; contiguous to which, on the left hand, is a large structure, supposed to have been a Pagan sepulchre. Of the city of Cu∣mae, so famous in antient times, only a few walls are now remaining; but there are a great many antient structures about it, besides those we have already mentioned. Baiae, the famous winter-re∣treat of the old Romans, stood on a bay about two
<PB N="458" REF="4650"/>
miles and a half west-north-west from Puzzuolo; but not the least vestige of it is now to be seen: the whole shore of this bay was antiently covered with very magnificent edifices, and there are still many remains of temples, baths, reservoirs, &amp;c. about it. On the other side of the lake Acheron is the promontory of Miseno, which is entirely hol∣low beneath; and at the extremity of it are still the remains of a pharos, or light-house: part of the Ro∣man fleet was formerly stationed here. The an∣tient city of Miseno, situated upon the promontory, was destroyed by the Saracens, in the ninth centu∣ry; so that no remains of it are now to be seen. These are the chief curiosities about Puzzuolo; but to give a full and particular account of all of them, would require much more room than we can spare: we therefore proceed to the other towns.</P>
<P>Sorrento, formerly Surrentum, an antient city, mentioned by Pliny, Strabo, &amp;c. stands on the shore of the gulph of Naples, and about twenty miles to the south of it. It is now small, but the see of an archbishop, and gives name to a high promontory, which divides the Gulph of Naples from the Bay of Salernum. Many stately monu∣ments and ruins are still to be seen here. The Surrentini colles were antiently famed for their ex∣cellent wines.</P>
<P>Gaeta, antiently called Caieta, from Aeneas's nurse, a considerable town and bishop's see, on a hill, almost environed by the sea. Here is a rock of marble, called Monte della Trinita, in which is a fissure, several feet wide, from top to bottom. It must have been made by an earthquake, but the time when that happened is not known: in this fissure is a flight of steps, which leads to a chapel called Del Crocifisso, whence there is a beautiful prospect of the sea. The Franciscan convent here boasts of its having been the residence of the

founder of that seraphic order, as they term it. In a wooden closet of the castle, which is pretty strong and well fortified, is preserved the corpse of Charles, duke of Bourbon, dried like a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, burial in consecrated ground having been de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed it, because he was killed in storming Rome, and con∣sequently under the pope's excommunication. A considerable garrison is always kept here. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mausoleum of Lucius Munatius Plancus, the con∣sul, which is commonly called Rolando's Tower, and by some supposed to be the temple of Saturn, built by Munatius, is still to be seen at Gaeta. Large dolphins are frequently caught in the neigh∣bouring sea. About three Italian miles from hence is Mola, antiently Formia, where is a harbour, a custom-house, and a small garrison, which is re∣lieved weekly from Gaeta. It was on a journey from his villa, called Formianum, situated near this place, that the great orator Cicero was mur∣dered, by order of Mark Anthony.</P>
<P>Caserta, a small episcopal city, about sixteen miles north from Naples, where is a very noble royal palace, lately built. The town gives the ti∣tle of prince to the Gaetano family.</P>
<P>St. Maria, a market-town, eighteen miles north of Naples, built out of the ruins of Capua, an∣tiently the celebrated capital of Campania, which vied with Rome, Carthage, and other great cities, for beauty, power, and riches; and whose luxury, the effects of its prosperity, proved fatal to Hanni∣bal's army, and even to itself. The remains of many antient palaces, temples, and other buildings, are still visible here. The neighbouring country is extremely delicious and fertile.</P>
<P>New-Capua, a small town on the river Voltor∣no, two Italian miles from the Old, is the see of an archbishop, and pretty well built.</P>

<P>Cassino, a small town, forty-eight miles from Na∣ples to the north west, noted for the oldest and most celebrated convent in this kingdom, founded by St. Benedict himself. Its abbot is the first ba∣ron of the kingdom, and has episcopal jurisdiction within his district, in which is the fortified town of St. Germano.</P>
<P>Fondi, a small episcopal see, under the archbishop of Capua. It stands on the confines of the Eccle∣siastical State, not far from Gaeta, and gives name to a lake. The air here is said to be unwhol∣some.</P>
<P>Salerno, the capital of the Principato Citra, or Principality on this side the Apennines, situated on the gulph to which it gives name, about twenty-six miles south-east from Naples. It is well fortified, has a pretty good harbour and castle, but little trade: here, however, is the see of an archbishop, with an university, and several annual fairs, which are much resorted to, and very profitable to it. A treatise, containing rules for preserving of health, published by the physicians of this place, in verse, anno 1100, is much cried up, at least in this coun∣try. About twenty miles to the south of this city lies Campaccio, near which are the ruins of the an∣tient city of Poestum, or Possidonia. The walls still remain, composed of very large cubical stones, and extremely thick, in some parts no less than eighteen feet. Here are also the remains of a theatre, am∣phitheatre, and three temples.</P>
<P>A malfi, now a small town, but formerly the ca∣pital of a republic. It gives the title of prince to the house of Piccolomini, and is the see of an arch∣bishop.</P>

Otranto, antiently called Hydruntum, a well fortified city, and the see of an archbishop, on an island at the mouth of the Adriatic, which is joined by a bridge to another island, and that by a bridge to the continent. It gives name to, and is the ca∣pital of a province, which, with those of Bari, and Capitanata, constitute the country of Apulia, a tract, in general, flat, dry, and sandy, where, in most places, there is no other water for drinking but rain that is saved in cisterns. Otranto gives name also to a cape, from which if a line be drawn directly east to the coast of Albania, it will sepa∣rate the Adriatic from the Ionic sea.</P>
<P>Brindisi, in Latin, Brundusium, now a small archiepiscopal city, but antiently large and flourish∣ing, when it had a fine harbour, and a great trade, both which it hath now lost. It stands thirty-nine miles north-west of Otranto.</P>
<P>Tarento, the antient Tarentum, now a small archiepiscopal city, seventy miles west of Otranto, si∣tuated on a little peninsula, projecting into the bay, to which it gives name. There are still several monuments of its antient grandeur to be seen in it; but its once famed port can now admit only small vessels, It is defended by a fort, in which there is a constant garrison kept.</P>

The name of Manfredonia it had from the famed Manfred, natural son to the emperor Frederic II. who was the founder of it in the year 1256. The city is now small, and thinly inhabited, and its harbour so choaked up, that it is fit only for small vessels. It is situated at the foot of Mount Gargano, on which is a convent, the most celebrated in the kingdom, next to that on Mount Cassino, and a town called Monte St. Angelo.</P>
<P>Molise, a small place, thirty-seven miles north-west of Capua, which notwithstanding gives name to a province, the smallest indeed in the kingdom, but fertile in corn, wine, silk, and saffron. The other places in the province worth mentioning are, Boiano, Tripento, and Isernia.</P>
<P>Civita di Chieti, formerly Theate, the capital of the province called Abruzzo Citra, from its situa∣tion on this side the river Pescara.

<HEAD>ITALIAN ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING now given a brief account of the several countries on the continent of Italy, we shall next take a view of its islands, beginning from the north with that of Corsica, and proceed∣ing southwards.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CORSICA.</HEAD>
<P>This island lies opposite the Genoese continent, between the Gulph of Genoa, and the island of Sardinia, extending from forty one to forty-three degrees of latitude, and from nine to ten degrees of east longitude. Hence its greatest length from Cape-Corso, which is its utmost northern point, to Cape-Bonifacio, its utmost southern verge, is about one hundred English miles, and its greatest breadth about fifty; but some make both the length and breadth much less. It is computed to be one hundred miles distant from the city of Genoa to the south, sixty from Leghorn to the south-west, and is divided into the country on this side, and be∣yond the mountains; which are again subdivided into thirty-eight cantons, called by the natives pieves.</P>
<P>The island being for the most part mountainous, woody, dry, and stony, has little arable land. Some of the low grounds and vallies, however, yield corn, wine, figs, almonds, chesnuts, olives, and other fruits. Here is also a good breed of cattle and horses, and the woods and forests abound with deer, and other game, together with honey and wax. There are also some salt-works and hot baths on the island, with crystals, iron, and alum.
<PB N="465" REF="4720"/>
In the surrounding seas are caught abundance of fish, especially those called from the neighbouring island, Sardines, and a kind of sturgeon. Coral also is often found in these seas, especially in the Straits of Bonifacio. Notwithstanding all this, it is but thinly peopled, by reason of its barren soil, and indifferent air, the oppression and tyranny of the Genoese, while they were masters of the island, and the continual war the inhabitants have been engaged in, in defence of their liberties, since they shook off the Genoese yoke. The number of the inhabitants is computed at about one hundred and twenty thousand. The clergy are very nume∣rous in this island, especially the regular. It is computed that the Franciscans, Capuchins, and Servites, have no less than seventy-five convents.</P>
<P>The principal rivers of the island are the Limone, Talavo, Tavignano, and Gollo. The others are the Ficario, Capitello, and Fuminale d'Ornano. The chief lakes are those of Crena, Ino, Diana, Vibino, and Covasino. Of the mountains, which are very numerous, that called Monte Gradacio is the most considerable.</P>
<P>The strenuous efforts that have been made for a number of years, by the natives of this island, to recover their liberty from the Genoese, have, in a considerable degree, attracted the attention of the other nations of Europe.</P>
<P>The island, after a continual series of revolu∣lutions, was at length granted by one of the popes to the republic of Pisa, from whom the Genoese wrested it about the beginning of the fourteenth century. The conduct of the Genoese was so cruel and arbitrary, that the Corsicans at last shook off their yoke; and, in the sixteenth centry, car∣ried on a bloody and desperate war several years, but were at length obliged to submit to their old masters.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="4730"/>
About the year 1729 they again took up arms; and, from that time to the present, peace has never been thoroughly established; though there have been some intervals of tranquility, procured by the help of foreign forces, Germans, Swiss, or French.</P>
<P>In 1767, the French king bought of Genoa the claim of that republic in the island of Corsica; and in 1768, sent a considerable force to reduce it. By the latest accounts from thence, the count de Vaux, the French general, had made himself master of Corte, the chief town next to Bastia, and of almost all the rest of the island; so that general Paoli, with his brother Clement, and some other chiefs, had quitted the island, and retired to Leghorn.</P>
<P>The celebrated general Paoli is the son of Gia∣cinto Paoli, a Corsican chief, whom Giafferi, who was then at the head of the Corsicans, chose for his colleague in 1734. In 1739 the French troops, under the marquis de Maillebois, having reduced the whole island, Giafferi and Paoli were obliged to quit the island, to which they never returned; they retired to Naples, where they got regiments, and spent the remainder of their lives. While Gia∣cinto Paoli led a retired life in Naples, his whole time was devoted to the education of his son, whose genius and disposition were so happy, that no part of it was mispent. The French troops having been withdrawn from Corsica, the inhabitants again took up arms; but tired at last of the continual dis∣sentions among their principal men, and of the consequent evils that attended them; charmed be∣sides with the character and manners of young Paoli, they sent a deputation, in the year 1755, to in∣vite him to Corsica, and to offer him the supreme government of the island. This offer was gladly accepted, and ever since he has had the direction of their affairs, assisted by a council, consisting of two members for every parish, who were elected annually.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="4740"/>
When the Genoese were in possession of the island, the greatest part of the revenues, even in time of peace, were expended on the governor, officers, and soldiery. The most considerable towns in the island are,</P>
<P>Bastia, the capital, situated on the north-east coast of the island, twenty-two miles south of Cape-Corse, and seventy-six north of Cape-Bonifacio. It has a good harbour and castle, is pretty well for∣tified, and the see of a bishop.</P>
<P>San Fiorenzo, situated also on the norhern side of the island, on a gulph to which it gives name, has a good haven, with some fortifications, and is the residence of a bishop; but its inhabitants, by rea∣son of the unwholesomeness of the air, are but few.</P>
<P>Bonifacio, a small, but strong and well peopled town, on the southern coast of the island. It gives name to the strait, or narrow sea, between it and Sardinia, antiently called Fretum Taphros, has a convenient harbour, and is well fortified.</P>
<P>Porto-Vecchio, a small sea-port town on the eastern coast. It was antiently called Portus Syra∣cusanus. The haven lies a little to the south of the town, and its entry is somewhat dangerous, by reason of the rocks about it; but ships, when they are got into it, are sheltered from all winds. On both sides of the bay are watch towers, seated on high rocks. This place has the name of Porto Vecchio, or the Old-harbour, to distinguish it from Porto Nuovo, or the New-harbour, which lies ten miles south of it.</P>
<P>Corte, a small town on the river Golo, about twenty-five miles from Calvi. It is an episcopal see, under that of Genoa, and the residence also of the bishop of Aleria. For its defence it has a stout castle and wall.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="4750"/>
Ajazzo, by some esteemed the capital of the island, stands on the western coast, by the river Gravone, and on the south-side of a gulph, to which it gives name. It is an episcopal see, a place of good trade, and well peopled. The neighbouring country is fertile, especially in wine.</P>
<P>Calvi, a strong town, situated on a craggy hill, on the western coast, and near a large deep gulph, to which it gives name, about thirty-eight miles west of Bastia, and thirty north of Ajazzo. The bishop of Sagona resides here.</P>
<P>The other places in the island worth mentioning are, Nebio, Centuri, Mariana, Casa-Barbarica, or Casa-Barbarina, where is a great coral fishery, Ampugnana, Balagna, and Sagona.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SARDINIA.</HEAD>
<P>This island, which lies about one hundred and fifty miles west of Leghorn, is near one hundred and sixty in length from north to south, and eighty in breadth from east to west.</P>
<P>With respect to the air it is not reckoned very who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ome, especially in the southern parts of the island, which are much more low and level, and fuller of morasses than the northern; where are high, rocky, barren mountains, and where con∣sequently the air is more sharp and pure. The soil, where it is properly cultivated, is very fruitful, pro∣ducing corn, wine, and oil, in great plenty, to∣gether with citrons, oranges, chesnuts, pears, plums, &amp;c. The other products of the island are cattle, large and small, game of all sorts, buffa∣loes, wild bears, and dear. Of the last, some of the skins are so finely spotted, that they might be taken for those of tigers. Of metals and minerals here are gold, silver, lead, iron, sulphur, alum, especially in the mountains on the north.</P>
<P><PB N="469" REF="4760"/>
The only venemous creature said to be in the island is the massrone or mastrione, a kind of spi∣der, resembling a little frog, and by the antients called solifuga, because it keeps generally within the bowels of the earth: nor is there, as we are told, any ravenous wild beast in it, besides the fox.</P>
<P>In these commodities, and in coral, linen, silk, wool, hides, and a fine sort of cheese, a consider∣able traffic is carried on, for which there are many fine harbours round the island, and in which, as well as agriculture, great improvements might be made, if the inhabitants were not so indolent.</P>
<P>After having been successively subject to the Phenicians, Greeks, Carthagenians, Romans, Sar∣racens, Genoese, and Pisans, the island was at last subdued by the king of Arragon, on whom the pope had bestowed it, anno 1297. From that time it continued annexed to the crown of Spain, until 1708, when it was reduced by the allies, and at the peace of Utrecht given to the emperor. In a few years after the Spaniards recovered it, but soon after lost it again, namely in 1719, when it was conferred, in lieu of Sicily, on the duke of Savoy, with the title of king, whose son at present enjoys it.</P>
<P>The rivers Sacro, and Tirso, by an opposite course, cut it nearly into two equal parts or pro∣vinces called, the one Il Capo de Cagliari, and the other Il Capo de Sassari, or Lugedori. There are a great many ports, gulphs, and bays in it, with several strong towns, a great number of vil∣lages, three archbishoprics, and four bishoprics. The clergy, both secular and regular, have great privileges, incomes, and immunities. The only university is that of Cagliari. The revenues of the island are said scarce to exceed the charges of the government.</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="4770"/>
With respect to character, the Sardinians make no great figure, being represented as proud, though poor, brutish, lazy, and ignorant: but supposing this character just, may it not in a great measure be owing to the tyranny, civil and ecclesiastical, under which they have long groaned? The clergy and nobility enjoy such exorbitant privi∣leges, and in consequence thereof are become so arrogant and numerous, that the whole burden of public taxes falls upon the people of the lower rank. All the nobility are not only exempted from taxes, but from being tried for any crime, that of treason not excepted, by any but a council of seven of their peers. Thus, while the noblesse riot in wealth and luxury, and are almost inde∣pendent, the lower ranks of the people are in the most deplorable state of slavery and indigence. No measures appear to have been taken, either by their former or present masters, to remedy these abuses, to encourage agriculture and commerce, and to make the most of the natural advantages of the island. The degeneracy and depravity of the people, therefore, are not much to be wondered at, nor ought they to be ascribed to a natural per∣verseness, so much as to oppression and thraldom.</P>
<P>The religion here is the Roman catholic, and the language the Spanish; the island having been long under the dominion of Spain. The towns of any note in the island are,</P>
<P>Cagliari, which is commonly reckoned the ca∣pital, and gives name not only to a province, but likewise to a gulph and promontory in its neighbour∣hood. It stands on the declivity of a hill on the south side of the island, and is divided into High and Low; the former of which is handsome and well built, but the latter, which stands by the sea-shore, is dirty, unhealthy, and poorly inhabited. The king's vice-roy resides here, and an archbi∣shop,

whose cathedral is very magnificent. There are a great many convents in the town, which has a spacious port on the east side of the gulph, com∣manded and defended by a castle, and a battery of about a dozen of cannon.</P>
<P>Oristagni, antiently Usellis Colonia, situated on a gulph, on the west coast of the island. The town took its name from its situation near a lake, formed by the river Sacro. It is the see of an archbishop, but being surrounded on the land∣side with marshy grounds and stagnated waters, it is very unhealthy, and for that reason but poorly inhabited. On the coast of the gulph, to which the town gives name, and which, notwithstanding several rivers fall into it, is very shallow, stands a handsome light-house. This town is about forty-five miles north of Cagliari.</P>
<P>Sassari, a pretty large town on the river Torres, about ten miles from the north coast of the island. It hath some fortifications, and is the see of an archbishop, translated hither, anno 1441, from the antient Turritana.</P>
<P>Castel Arragonese, Castrum Arragonense, a small but well fortified and inhabited town, with a good castle, and a commodious and spacious harbour, at the mouth of the river Coquinas, on the north-east coast of the isle. It is an episcopal see; and stands about an hundred miles north from Cagliari, eighty from Oristagni, and twenty-five north-east of Sassari.</P>
<P>Algeri, a small but strong and well-inhabited sea-port town, on the same western coast. It is an episcopal see, under that of Sassari, has a coral fishery, and stands about sixteen miles south of Sas∣sari. There are several other towns in the island, but too inconsiderable to merit a particular de∣scription.</P>
<P><PB N="472" REF="4790"/>
About Sardinia lie a great many smaller islands, of which the principal are, St. Pietro, St. Anti∣ocho, La Vacca, Il Toro, Rossa, Bovaria, Tavo∣lats, Asinaria, Serpentera, Tazzo, Carbonera, and Ogi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astro. Asinaria, the most considerable of these, by the antients stiled the great island of Hercules, is about twenty-eight miles in compass, and lies about four miles from Cape Monte Falcone, and fif∣teen north of the city of Sassari.</P>
<P>In the Tuscan sea, besides the Elba or Elva, be∣longing to the principality of Piomberio, and al∣ready described, are several small islands, belonging to the duchy, namely Melora, Gorgona, Pianosa, Le Formiche, Monte Christo, Giglio, and Gia∣nuti.</P>
<P>In the same sea is the island of Capraria, de∣pending on Corsica, which is about eight miles in compass, and, though mountainous, well cultivated and inhabited, having a pretty large town in it, and a castle.</P>
<P>On the coast of the Ecclesiastical State, fifteen miles south of Cape Cercella, is the small isle of Ponza, antiently Pontia and Pontiae. It is fertile, and well cultivated.</P>
<P>On the western coast of the kingdom of Naples, and belonging thereto, are the small islands of Ca∣pri or Caprea, Ischia, Procita, and Nisida.</P>
<P>Capri, or Caprea, is much taken notice of for the noble ruins on it. It is about four miles long, and one broad, and is situated at the entrance of the Gulph of Naples, about three miles from the con∣tinent. This isle was the residence of the emperor Augustus, for some time; and afterwards of Ti∣berius, for many years. The principal ruins and re∣mains of antiquity are at the extremity of the eastern promontory. What chiefly recommended this island to Tiberius was its temperate healthful air, being warm in winter, and cool in summer; and the na∣ture
<PB N="473" REF="4800"/>
of its coast, which is so very steep, that a small number of men may defend it against a great army. The surface of the island was then cut into easy ascents, adorned with the emperor's and other pa∣laces, and planted with a variety of groves and gar∣dens. The rocks also underneath, were cut into highways, grottos, galleries, bagnios, and subterra∣neous retirements, which suited the brutal pleasures of that emperor; and were afterwards defaced or de∣molished by the Romans, in detestation of the lasci∣vious unnatural scenes which had been acted there. It contains about fifteen hundred inhabitants, who are exempt from all taxes; and belongs to the pro∣vince of Lovoro, in the kingdom of Naples. There are several springs of fresh water in it; and in a delightful valley between the mountains, at the two extremities, stands a city of the same name with the island, which is the see of a bishop, whose revenue arises chiefly from the prodigious flights of quails that come thither at certain seasons, particu∣larly in March, when vast quantities of them are sent to Naples, and sold for four-pence or five-pence per dozen. On this account, the bishopric is some∣times jocosely stiled, the Bishopric of Quails.</P>
<P>Ischia, a small but pleasant and fertile island, lying on the Neapolitan coast, about two miles from the Cape of Messina, and twenty-five from Naples. Most of it is surrounded with high, craggy, and inaccessible rocks, which shelter it from the winds, and defend it from invaders. Some parts of it are rich and delightful, yielding all man∣ner of delicious fruits, and excellent wines; but others are as dismal and barren. It was antiently called Inarime; and was so subject to earthquakes, that the poets tell us, Jupiter laid the vanquished Titan Typhon under it, and that the earthquakes are occasioned by his efforts to throw off the load. There are several hot baths and medicinal waters in it, with a number of pleasant towns and vil∣lages,
<PB N="474" REF="4810"/>
churches and monasteries. Of the moun∣tains, one is called Falconaria, on account of the falcons that breed there; and another Guardia, be∣cause a constant guard is kept on it, to prevent the landing of Corsairs. The principal town has its name from the island, or the island from it, with the title of a bishopric, and is defended by a strong fort.</P>
<P>The small isle of Procita, which belongs to the marquis of Vasto, produces plenty of fruit and good wine, and is well inhabited.</P>
<P>Nisida, which lies not far from the main land, is a kind of large garden, laid out in slopes and ter∣races. Towards the south it has a small harbour; and, on a neighbouring rock, is a lazaretta, where ships bound to Naples are obliged to perform qua∣rantine.</P>
<P>On the eastern coast of Naples are also four or five small islands belonging to it. The whole groupe is known by the name of Tremiti, or Tre∣mita, and lie about thirteen miles north-east from the city of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>remoli, in the Hither Abruzzo. The most considerable, called St. Maria de Tremiti, is strongly fortified, being surrounded with high walls, flanked with towers, and four stout bastions. There is a town in it, consisting of a neat well built street, a quarter of a mile long, with a port commanded by a high strong tower, a small arsenal for the rig∣ging of ships, and a magnificent monastery. Dio∣medes, after having abandoned Italy, is said to have retired to this island, and died in it; whence, the whole groupe was antiently called Diomedeae In∣fulae. All ships that pass by it commonly salute the fort, or rather the church, and the miraculous images in it. The other isles are more properly huge rocks than islands. There is said to be an odd kind of birds peculiar to these isles, and by the antients called Diomedean birds, having teeth, with
<PB N="475" REF="4820"/>
white feathers all over, and eyes of the colour of fire. They have always two chiefs; of which one leads the van, and the other brings up the rear.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>SICILY.</HEAD>
<P>This island, by far the most considerable in the Mediterranean, was antiently known by several names; as those of Trinacria and Triquetra, from its triangular form; and Sicania and Sicilia, from the Sicani and Siculi, its antient inhabitants: the last of these names it retains to this day. It is di∣vided from Italy by the narrow strait, now called the Strait of Messina, and in Italian Il Faro de Messina, or Il Canale, but antiently Fretum Secu∣lum, which, where narrowest, is not above three miles broad. This strait was much dreaded an∣tiently, on account of its rocks, currents, and whirlpool. The tides here flow very irregularly, and generally with great violence, both from the Tuscan and Sicilian seas. The rocky promontory antiently called Scylla, and now Capo Sciglio, is on the Calabrian side of the strait, opposite the Capo de Faro, in Sicily, the Promontorium Pelorum of the antients: the distance between these is not a∣bove three Italian miles. The whirlpool, antiently called Charybdis, and now Calosara and La Rema, lies not far from Messina, near the bottom of the cape, and seems now to be little dreaded.</P>
<P>Though this country lies in a warm climate, the air is healthful, being refreshed with sea-breezes on every side. Antiently its fertility was such, that it was stiled the granary or store-house of Italy; nor has it yet lost its glory in this respect, producing, in great abundance, corn, wine, oil, fruits, sugar, honey, wax, saffron, and silk. Here are also some mines of gold, silver, iron, and other metals, with several kinds of minerals, as alum, vitriol, saltpetre,
<PB N="476" REF="4830"/>
and mineral salt. The mountains yield also eme∣ralds, jasper, agate, porphyry, lapis lazuli, and a stone called catochite, of a greenish speckled co∣lour, which is said to grow soft by the warmth of one's hand, sticking to it like glew, and to be an excellent antidote against the sting of scorpions, and some other poisonous insects. A good deal of coral is found upon the coast, and plenty of excel∣lent fish; among which are the pesce spada, or sword-fish, and tunnies.</P>
<P>Of these commodities, particularly silk, raw or manufactured, great quantities are exported from Messina, where a consul from almost every nation in Europe resides, to manage and protect the trade of his nation; and, of late years, the Sicilians have traded with Turky and the coast of Barbary, which they never did before Don Carlos, now king of Spain, ascended the throne of the Two Sicilies.</P>
<P>Here are several rivers and good springs; but few of the rivers are navigable, having but a short course, and descending precipitately from the mountains. The chief are the Cantera, the Jar∣retta, and the Salso; of which, the two former run from west to east, and the third from north to south.</P>
<P>Of the mountains in this island the most noted is Mount Aetna, now called Monte Gibello, or Mon∣gibello, a vulcano, whose eruptions have often proved fatal to the neighbouring country. It is said to be seventy miles in circuit, and so high, that a circle of snow lies round the mouth of the vulca∣no a great part of the year: the circumference of the mouth is said to be six miles. Of its erup∣tions, that which happened in 1694 was one of the most fatal; for the city of Catanea, situated at the foot of it, together with all the adjacent country, were well nigh destroyed by it. Its sides are all co∣vered, either with vines, olive-trees, or shrubs,
<PB N="477" REF="4840"/>
which harbour many wild-beasts. At the bottom are corn-fields, and plantations of sugar-canes. Among the other mountains, one of the most con∣siderable is Mount St. Julian, near Palermo, an∣tiently called Eryx, and now vulgarly Trepani. The eruptions of Mount Aetna are generally pre∣ceded by an earthquake, which often do more da∣mage than the eruptions.</P>
<P>The first inhabitants of the island are said to have been the Laestrigones and Cyclopes; these were succeeded by the Iberi, from Spain, under their king Sicanus, from whom the island was named Sicania; these again by the Siculi, from Italy; then came the Phaenicians, from Tyre and Sidon; and then the Greeks, who were soon after obliged to share it with the Carthaginians: but both these were subdued or expelled by the Ro∣mans, who reduced it into the form of a province, and to whom, by its great fertility, it became a kind of granary. It followed the fortune of Italy in its several revolutions, until the Sicilian Vespers, in 1282, when the natives massacred the French, who had then the dominion of the island: the Spaniards then got possession of it, and held it till 1707, when they were expelled by the Imperialists; but, at the peace of Utrecht, Sicily was ceded to the duke of Savoy, with the title of king. The Spaniards invaded it in 1718, but were forced to abandon it again; and then it was conferred on the emperor Charles VI. who held it till the year 1735, when the Imperialists were driven out of this island and all their Italian dominions, and Don Carlos, now king of Spain, was advanced to the throne of the Two Sicilies, (Naples and Sicily) which were confirmed to him by a subsequent peace, on condi∣tion of his relinquishing Milan, Parma, and all the rest of the emperor's Italian dominions, which the Spaniards and French had taken from him during
<PB N="478" REF="4850"/>
the war. Don Carlos succeeding to the crown of Spain upon the death of his half-brother, without is∣sue, his third son, Ferdinand, became king of the Two Sicilies, who is no less absolute here than in his other dominions, and his revenues are what he pleases to make them. While Sicily was immedi∣ately subject to Spain, it was governed by a vice∣roy sent thither, who received from thence a reve∣nue of above four millions of crowns; but since it hath, jointly with Naples, been erected into a king∣dom, under the name of the Two Sicilies, the face of affairs, as well as form of government, is said to be much altered, tho' it is to be feared, not much in favour of the inhabitants. The nobility are so numerous in this island, that Labat says, it is paved with noblemen; there being no less than sixty dukedoms, fifty-six marquisates, and upwards of an hundred earldoms, besides a great number of baronies.</P>
<P>This people, with respect to their character, are far from appearing in a favourable light; being represented as a perverse race, which must be kept under with a high hand, according to an old pro∣verb, <HI>Insulani plerumq. mali, Seculi autem omnium pes∣simi.</HI> They are a mixture of Italians and Spani∣ards; but speak chiefly Spanish, and follow the Spanish fashions, particularly in wearing black.</P>
<P>The established religion of the island is the Ro∣man catholic. The Jews are now allowed to settle here, and make open profession of their religion, which was not the case while the island was imme∣diately subject to Spain. The number of churches, convents, and religious foundations here, is very great, and they are well endowed. There is a so∣vereign-tribunal, which judges in all ecclesiastical affairs, and admits of no appeal to the pope.</P>
<P>The island is commonly divided into three parts or provinces, viz. Val di Demino, Val di Noto, and Val di Mazara.</P>
<P><PB N="479" REF="4860"/>
The first of these begins at the Cape of Pharo, antiently called Promontorium Pelorum, and is of a considerable extent, being bounded on the south by the river Jarreta, and on the west by that of Ter∣mini or Torto, called also Fiume Grande, or the Great River. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Messina, a large well built city, with a spacious harbour, near the strait to which it gives name, and not above six miles from the coast of Calabria. It is one of the greatest mart-towns in the Mediter∣ranean, contains many noble edifices, is the see of an archbishop, and contends with Palermo for being the capital of the island. The cathedral is a large spacious building, very rich in plate, and finely adorned in the inside. In the magnificent chapel of the Virgin Mary is preserved, as a choice relick, a letter, which, the Messinians tell us, was sent them by the Blessed Virgin, and which is carried in procession, once a-year, with great pomp. The other buildings most worthy of notice are the arch∣bishop's palace, the general hospital, called La Log∣gio, the Lazaretto, and forts. At the annual fair, kept here in August, great quantities of foreign goods are exposed to sale. The city lies on a gen∣tle declivity along the sea, has large suburbs, and is well furnished with water by subterraneous aque∣ducts, and all kinds of provisions, from sea and land. The port, which was declared a free one in 1728, is of an oblong oval form, well fortified, with a citadel, and other works, and so deep, that ships of eighty guns can come close up to the key. The city also is strongly fortified, though not regularly. In its neighbourhood are some hot mineral waters, esteemed very good against all rheumatic diseases. The chief manufacture of this place is that of silks: some of the inhabitants are also employed in fishing, cultivating vines and mulberry-trees, and breeding silk-worms. It was almost depopulated
<PB N="480" REF="4870"/>
by a grievous pestilence, in the year 1742, which is said to have carried off two-thirds of its inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>Catanea, situated on a gulph of its own name, near the mouth of the river Indicello, but no sea∣port. By its vicinity to Mount Aetna, it had suf∣fered greatly before the year 1693, when most part of it was destroyed by an eruption, attended with an earthquake of three days continuance. Eleven hundred people that had taken refuge in the cathe∣dral were buried under the ruins of it. The town, however, notwithstanding the danger to which it is exposed, is said to be now pretty well rebuilt. There is a great fair here in the spring, that brings in a vast concourse of people from all parts of Ita∣ly, but especially from Malta, which hath most of its provisions and other commodities from this place. This town is the see of a bishop, under the archbishop of Mont Real, and stands forty-six miles from Syracuse to the north, and forty from Messina to the south-west.</P>
<P>Cefalu, antiently Cephalaedis or Cephaledium, a small but well peopled town, and an episcopal see, with a good port, thirty-two miles east of Paler∣mo, and eighty-four west of Messina.</P>
<P>Milazzo, antiently Mylae, situated on the gulph of its name, and reckoned one of the strongest places in the island. It lies about twenty-eight miles west of Messina, and gives name to a tract of land, which extends itself about four miles into the sea, and is called the Punto or Point of Milazzo.</P>
<P>Taormina, antiently Taurominium, a small town, standing near the sea, on a rocky mountain called formerly Taurus, and much celebrated for its ex∣cellent wine and marble.</P>
<P>The province called Val di Noto extends from the Jarretta to the south-east coast of the island. The principal places contained in it are,</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="4880"/>
Syracuse, antiently a very noble city, and the ca∣pital of the island, said to have been built by Ar∣chias, a Corinthian, and to have extended upwards of twenty-two miles, or an hundred and eighty sta∣dia, in compass. It stands forty-six miles from Ca∣tania, seventy-five from Messina to the south, and thirty eight north from Capo Passaro, the Promon∣torium Pachynum of the Romans, on that spot an∣tiently called Insula, or the Island. Syracuse is pret∣ty well fortified, and has a port, capable of receiv∣ing the largest vessels, with a strong castle, supplied with plenty of water by the fountain of Arethusa, so famed among the antients.</P>
<P>Castro Giovanni, antiently Enna or Henna, and a celebrated city. It stands near the heart of the island, to the north-west of the lake Pergus, sixty miles south-east from Palermo, and is now a small, but handsome city, defended by an old castle. Near it is a cavern, which is supposed to be bottomless, whence, as the poets feigned, Pluto came out in his car, and carried off Proserpine.</P>
<P>Terra Nova, a small town, by some thought to be the Gela of the antients. There is a salt-lake belonging to it, called Il Beviero di Terra Nova, about three miles in circumference, which is so full of fish, that one may kill them with a stick along the shore; but two persons are ap∣pointed to keep watch from a tower, to prevent the fish from being thus destroyed. The inhabi∣tants fish chiefly in Lent, and furnish both them∣selves and all the neighbouring parts. The banks of the lake are covered with salt, yet it has no vi∣sible communication with the sea.</P>
<P>Lentino, Lentini, or Leontini, now a consider∣able town, notwithstanding it suffered greatly by the earthquake in 1693, standing about five miles from the bay of Catana, and twenty north of Sy∣racuse, at a small distance from a lake, called an∣tiently Lacus Herculeus, and now Lago di Lentini.</P>
<P><PB N="482" REF="4890"/>
La Marza, a small place, near which is a noted salt-pit, called La Salina della Marza.</P>
<P>The province called Val di Mazara, lies on the western side of the island, and is bounded by the sea, except on the east, where it borders on the Val di Demino, and the east and south-east, where it terminates on that of Noto. Though mountainous, it is fertile and well watered. The principal towns in it are,</P>
<P>Mazara, which gives name to it, and stands near the mouth of a river of the same name, to the east of Cape Faro. It was formerly a consider∣able city, but is now much fallen from its pristine grandeur.</P>
<P>Palermo, antiently Panormus, and Panormum, a large, rich, and well-built city, situated at the very bottom of a gulph, to which it gives name. It is said to have been built by the Phaenicians, at their first coming into Sicily; and it is now an archiepiscopal see, laying claim also, as we observed above, to the title of capital, as well as Messina, from which it is one hundred and twenty miles distant, to the west. The vice-roy's palace is a mag∣nificent structure, adorned with fine sculptures, gardens, &amp;c. and serves instead of a castle, stand∣ing high, and being flanked with some lofty towers, and other works. There are many other fine pub∣lic edifices, as the cathedral, and the other church∣es, several fountains, the city gate, which leads to the sea-side, the key, mole, forts, and the convents, town-house, lombard-house, and university. The key is one of the finest walks about the city, being wide and of a great length, and planted with trees. The port is safe and commodious every where, except on the south-west side, which is full of rocks, that rise no higher than the surface of the sea. The number of the inhabitant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> computed at one hun∣dred
<PB N="483" REF="4900"/>
and twenty thousand. Two strong citadels guard the entrance of the harbour.</P>
<P>Trepani, antiently Drepanum, situated forty miles south-west of Palermo, at the foot of the hill, antiently called Eryx, and now II Monte di Tra∣pani, on the top of which was formerly a city called Eryx, a temple of Venus, and Anchises's tomb. Trapani is said to be a place of great trade, and is noted for its salt-springs, and works, and its fisheries, especially that of coral.</P>
<P>Marsala, a well fortified town, with a good haven, eighteen miles south of Trapani, and fifty-six south-west of Palermo. Its situation is sup∣posed to be the same as that of the antient Lily∣baeum, which gave name to the neighbouring cape, called still Capo Lilibeo, though more frequently Capo di Bono, or Marsala.</P>
<P>Gergenti, a town situated on the river St. Blasio, about four miles from the sea, and sixty-six south from Palermo. It is an episcopal see, has a con∣siderable traffic, especially in corn; and though strong by nature, is also defended by a castle. Near it antiently stood the city called, by the Ro∣mans, Agrigentum, and, by the Greeks, Agragas, and said to have been ten miles in compass. History informs us, that its tyrant Phalaris used to torture people in a brazen-bull, made by one Perillus, who, for his reward, had the first experiment made upon himself.</P>
<P>Monte Reale, Mons Regalis, a small town, eight miles south-east from Palermo. It is the see of a bishop, and has a magnificent cathedral.</P>
<P>Castel a Mare, a town on a bay, to the south of Monte Reale. Near it stood the town antiently called Egesta, and celebrated for its warm baths. The other towns of this province are inconsider∣able. Off the north coasts of Sicily, in the Tuscan sea, lie several small islands, called, at present, the Lipari islands, from the chief of them, which is said
<PB N="484" REF="4910"/>
to have had its name from Liparus, the founder of its capital. By the Latins they were antiently deno∣minated Aeoliae and Vulcaniae, and by the Greeks Hephaestiades. The first of these names they are supposed to have had from Aeolus, the successor of Liparus, whom the poets styled the God of the winds, on account of the high winds that reign in these parts, and the second from the volcanos that are in two of them, viz. Hiera and Stromboli. Lipari, which lies about twenty-six miles north from the nearest coast of Sicily, and is about eigh∣teen miles in circumference, including the wind∣ings of the shore, enjoys a wholesome air, and rich soil, producing corn, wine, and fruit, espe∣cially figs and raisins, in great plenty, together with sulphur, alum, and bitumen. It hath also some excellent hot springs, and on the coasts are caught a great variety of fine fish, with which it drives a considerable commerce. The capital, called also Lipari, is strong both by nature and art, well inhabited, and an episcopal see, under that of Mes∣sina. The small islands of Levanzo, Maritima, and Favagnana, lie at the west end of Sicily, and both they and the Lipari isles are subject to the king of the two Sicilies.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The ISLAND of MALTA.</HEAD>
<P>Malta, Olim Melita, lying but a little to the south of Sicily, we shall class among the Italian islands. It is situated in 15° east long. and 35° 15′ north lat. sixty miles south of Cape Passaro in Sicily, and is of an oval figure, twenty miles long and twelve broad. The air is clear and healthful, but excessive hot, when it is not cooled by the sea∣breezes. It is all a white soft rock, covered to the depth of a foot with a good vegetable earth, pro∣ducing great quantities of cotton, indigo, oranges, lemons, olives, figs, and other fruits, with plenty of honey, good pasture, pulse, roots, herbs, and
<PB N="485" REF="4920"/>
garden stuff, but not a sufficient quantity of corn, wine, or wood, for the consumption of the inhabi∣tants, who are computed at about sixty thousand, and speak commonly a corrupt Arabic in the coun∣try, but in the towns Italian. Considerable fisheries are carried on here, particularly of coral, and large quantities of sea-salt made along the coast.</P>
<P>The most antient inhabitants of this island, of whom we have any account, were the Phaeacians, who were driven out by the Phaenicians, and they, in their turn, by the Greeks. Afterwards it seems to have been under the dominion of the Carthagini∣ans, from whom the Romans took it. Upon the declension of the Roman empire, it was first sub∣dued by the Goths, then by the Saracens, from whom it was wrested by the Normans, in the year 1090, after which it had the same masters as Sicily, till Charles V. gave it to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem.</P>
<P>This order took its rise in the Holy Land, in the eleventh century. After the alliance entered into between the Greek emperor Constantine Monachus, and the Saracen caliphs, great numbers of western Europeans resorting to the Holy Land, some Italian merchants, for the accommodation of pilgrims, built an hospital and oratory at Jerusalem, which they dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and appointed certain monks to attend on the pilgrims, who, from their office, were stiled hospitalers, or hospi∣tal brothers, and from the church of St. John, Jo∣hannites. At first these merchants and hospitalers furnished themselves with all necessaries from Italy; but Godfrey of Bouillon, upon his conquest of the Holy Land, in which they performed signal service, having endowed them with some lands, and his successor Baldwin having put them in possession of several castles and towns, they thereupon held a general chapter, and elected Raymond de Podio for master, who first instituted an order out of the
<PB N="486" REF="4930"/>
brotherhood, made them take vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, gave them the octangular cross, and the black cloak, and also divided them into three classes, namely, knights, capellane, or chaplains, and serventi d' armi, i. e. servants, or serjeants at arms. All this happened towards the close of the eleventh century, and was confirmed by the pope. These knights maintained their ground in Syria and the Holy Land against all the efforts of the Turks, for the space of two hundred years; but being at last compelled to quit them, they re∣tired to Cyprus, and afterwards made themselves masters of the island of Rhodes, which they also defended, for two hundred years, against all the power of the infidels; and then surrendering it upon honourable terms, withdrew to Candia, and then to Italy, till Charles V. in 1529, conferred on them the islands of Malta and Gozo upon the fol∣lowing conditions: First, That they wage war continually with the Turks, and all corsairs or powers of that nation or religion. Secondly, That they promise upon oath that the kingdom of Spain shall suffer no detriment from the ceded countries. Thirdly, That the right of patronage to the bi∣shopric of Malta shall continue in the king of Spain, as king of Sicily; but that he shall always chuse the bishop from among three persons, pre∣sented by the grand master. Fourthly, That an Italian shall be captain of the gallies, and not a foreigner, whom the Spaniards may have reason to suspect. Fifthly, That, whenever the order shall become master of Rhodes, or transplant itself elsewhere, these islands shall revert to the king of Spain, as king of Sicily. And, sixthly, That in acknowledgment of this tenure, the order, every year, on all saints day, shall send a deputation, with a falcon to the vice-roy of Naples.</P>
<P>The knights consist of eight tongues or nations, the chief of which are French, Italian, Spaniards,
<PB N="487" REF="4940"/>
English, and German. They have commanderies or estates in all or most parts of the Roman catho∣lic countries, and are said to amount to about three thousand. They ought all to be of antient noble families; but sometimes nobility is dispensed with, on account of personal merit, and such are called cavalieri di gratia. Not only the grand-master, but the knights in general are capable of being ad∣vanced to a cardinal's hat. According to the sta∣tutes, no natural children, those of great princes excepted, nor persons under eighteen years of age, can be admitted into the order; but the pope may dispense with these qualifications, and the grand∣master has an unlimited privilege to grant this fa∣vour to six persons.</P>
<P>The grand-master is stiled by foreign princes, Altesse eminentissime, by his subjects, most serene eminence, but, by the knights, only eminence. In matters relating to the order, he is accountable to his council and the chapter, but, in respect of the island and its inhabitants, he is entirely absolute. The principal among the high officers of the order are, the grand-commendeur, the marshal, the great hospitaler, the admiral, the gran-conservatore, the secretary, the great balley, and the turcopelier. These, stiled ballivi conventuale, constitute the grand∣master's council, and are the heads of the eight tongues. Next follow the priories, of which the great priory of Germany holds the first place. The grand-priors reside in the several Roman catholic nations, where there are commanderies, over which they preside, being accounted the grand-master's vicars. They must remit the necessary contribu∣tions for acting against the Turks. There are grand-masterships of the order among Protestants, but they send no remittances to Malta. The prin∣cipal statute of the order, that each knight shall assist at least in three expeditions against the Turks, is not now so strictly observed. The knights make

vows of celibacy and chastity; notwithstanding which every man keeps as many concubines as he pleases, who are for the most part Grecian beauties, which they take in the islands of the Archipelago, subject to Turkey. They have a squadron of men of war, and land forces, and are engaged in a per∣petual war against the Turks, Algerines, and other Mahometan powers. The grand-master, who is the head of the order, and chief commander in the island, is elected by the grand-priors. When at home he usually wears a long black gown, made after a particular fashion, with the large golden key of the holy sepulchre hanging by his side; but on a journey he dresses himself in a lay-garb, and wears a sword.</P>
<P>Valetta, or Cittanuova, the capital of the island of Malta, had its name from the grand-master Fred. Joh. de Valetta, who built it anno 1566. It is a handsome town, with an excellent harbour, and strongly fortified. Here is a handsome palace for the grand-master, several convents, nunneries, and churches, the principal of which is dedicated to St. John, a college of Jesuits, a large hospital, and a building where Turkish slaves are kept. Of the other towns, the most considerable are, Citta Vitto∣riosa, or Il Borgo, Senglea, Malta, called also Me∣dina, and Citta Vecchia, where the bishop re∣sides, Bormola, Cittanuova, Cottonera, Forte di S. Thomasso, and Forte Rosso.</P>
<P>Besides Malta there are two other small islands lying near it, that belong to the order, namely, Gozo, antiently Gaulos, and Comino, antiently Hephaestea. Gozo is very fruitful, and has about three thousand inhabitants, with several good har∣bours, and strong forts. Comino, though very small, has a fort and harbour, and is pretty fertile.</P>
