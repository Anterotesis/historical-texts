<HEAD>THE CASE OF Mr. Greenshields, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS This CASE respects Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> alone, these Sheets, should not have at all been concern'd, in undeceiving the World about him; since also it might be convenient for the Poor Man's Circumstances, that some People should be deceiv'd about him, because if they knew him better, it might be less to his Advantage.</P>
<P>Neither has the Defence of the City Justice of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> mov'd this Publication; since be the Man Injur'd by the Magistrates there or no; and if some things in their Proceedings, may not go down with us in <HI>England,</HI> or may not so well be Defended as they think they may, it is yet not ma∣terial enough, to trouble the <HI>English</HI> Reader about it; let them Fight it out among themselves, and let the Magistrates defend their Proceedings as no doubt they can, by their own Laws and Constitution, it is not so much to the Purpose.</P>
<P>But the Imprisoning this Man, being mis-represented in <HI>England.</HI> (1.) As he is said to be Imprisoned for Reading the Common-Prayer to an Episcopal Congregation. (2.) As his Imprisonment is cry'd up for a barbarous Persecu∣tion. (3.) As it is laid at the Door of the National Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and upon the whole People of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And (4.) As mighty Complaints are made of this Matter, to foment Parties, make Feuds and Divisions among us here, or excite the Parliament to impose a Toleration there; as <HI>I say</HI> this use is made of it, to the distracting our People, and breaking our Peace; so it is very fit our People should be rightly Inform'd, and indeed absolutely necessary, Truth should be set in a clear Light, that every one may judge for himself, and not be impos'd upon by the Artifice and Mis-representation of a Party.</P>
<P>There is lately Publish'd, and most indistriously handed about <HI>England,</HI> a Book Entitled, <HI>A True State of the Case of the Reverend Mr. Greenshields,</HI> &amp;c. In which his Imprisonment is represented to the World, as Cruel and Unjust, and mighty Exaggerations rais'd from the Circumstances;
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
such as (1.) Its being for Reading the Common-Prayer, &amp;c. This in particular to have it affect the Members of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> (2.) His long Imprisonment, and (3.) The manner of the Proceedings against him.</P>
<P>The present Undertaking shall no farther trouble it self with that Book, than the giving a more true and impartial Account of this Affair, occasions by Consequence—Since if the Matter may be impartialy stated, the Circumstances truly brought to light, and the Antecedent and Consequent Part of the History be truly related; the Book, or the Party propogating the Book, will need no other Reply, the Clamour must cease, and all the Malicious Inferences, drawn from it by the Party now busie to divide us, necessarily fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>Nor will the Jingling Preface to the said Book need any other Reply, than what the true Relation of Fact will furnish: Some few Observa∣tions as we go, may serve to obviate all the Melancholy Tone of that Canting Introduction, with which we are led by the Author, into his Ac∣count of the Matter.</P>
<P>To come then to this Matter, it is necessary to go back a little, to the Affair of the late Union, as to the Original, from whence it must be deduc'd; and if we bring things from their proper Ori∣ginal, it may be hoped we may be able to lay them the fairer open, to the View of the most common Understanding—And in doing this, it will be necessary to Enquire, HOW we in <HI>England,</HI> came to expect that the <HI>Scots</HI> should receive the Common-Prayer Book among them; and then WHY, or what Reason we have to expect it—</P>
<P>Nothing is more evident, than that the whole Dispute before us, will turn upon this Question, Whether we ought to expect of the <HI>Scots,</HI> that they should admit the <HI>English</HI> Service among them, or no? For if really we have no Reason to expect it, nor they have no Reason to do it—Then all the Hardships upon this Man, tho' all the Ridiculous things alledg'd were true, are most just, and he is really a Criminal, for offering to Impose that upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> which they ought not to allow.</P>
<P>To make short Work of this seemingly long Task, it will be necessary to lay down some Fundamental Principles, founded upon the respective Constitutions of either Kingdom <HI>before United,</HI> and upon the present Con∣stitution of the whole <HI>as United;</HI> from which, as from an unquestion'd Standard, or Rule of Argument, the following Discourse may be deduc'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. That before the Union, the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> however United under the same Race of Kings, and submit∣ting to the same Sovereign, were yet perfectly and entirely inde∣pendent on each other, and had no more Right to intermeddle either in the Laws, Constitution, Commerce, or Religion of one another, than the Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI> had, or any other remote Country.</P>
<P>This needs no other Proof than this, that <HI>England</HI> has acknowledg'd this Independency to <HI>Scotland</HI> upon all occasions, but more parti∣cularly in Treating with <HI>Scotland</HI> for a Union, as an Independent Nation.</P>
<P N="2">2. That as the Civil Government of either Kingdom, was separate and Independent before the Union; so the Religious Government was also separate and entirely Independent, and the National
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
Churches of either, were Establish'd by their own Laws, Subject to their own Discipline, Govern'd by their own Authority, THIS by Archbishops and Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Or an Episcopal Hierarchy, THAT by Session, Presbytery, Synod, and General Assembly, without having the least Respect to, Correspondence with, or Concern about each other, neither owning, allowing, or so much as acquainting themselves with one another.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That</HI> by this it is apparent, <HI>neither</HI> had the least Power to Impose upon each other, or had they Reciprocal Communication with each other.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That</HI> so little was the Confidence or Kindness between the Churches, so Incompatible the Interests, and so Impracticable any Union be∣tween them; that no Politick Union could ever be brought to pass, between the Civil Interests of the two Nations, till Religious Matters, and all Notions of a Union of Churches, was entirely re∣serv'd and left out of the Treaty—So that at the General Union of the two Kingdoms, lately and happily Accomplish'd—Two Things were determin'd, as the great Preliminaries, without which no Co∣alition could be so much as Practicable, <HI>(viz.) First,</HI> The Repealing an Act of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> Entitled <HI>an Act to prevent Dangers arising from the late Act of Security in Scotland,</HI> as an Act Invading the In∣dependency of <HI>Scotland—</HI>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Affair of Religi∣on should not be in any wise Treated upon, or meddled with; but that the respective National Churches, being left entire and unalter∣able, either Nation should be Impower'd to make such Laws for the Security of their respective Ecclesiastick Establishments, as they thought fit; which Laws being first Enacted in the respective Par∣liaments of either Kingdom, should be again Ratified in either King∣dom, by being Encorporated in the Treaty of Union, and so be made unalterable for ever, by any subsequent Authorities of the United Kingdom.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That</HI> this was accordingly done, and the several Acts of Security, <HI>(viz.)</HI> One made in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for the Security of the Presbyterian Church Government; and one made in <HI>England,</HI> for the Security of the Episcopal Hierarchy in <HI>England;</HI> are Ratified, Enacted and En∣corporated in the Union, and cannot be Alter'd Invaded or Disanull'd, by any Power whatsoever, remaining in the Kingdom of United <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That,</HI> as before the Union, the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy was never receiv'd by the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor Tole∣rated or allow'd to be used, no not in the Chapel Royal of the King—Even in the Times of the Episcopal Church Government being Esta∣blish't in that Kingdom, except that famous Attempt formerly made by K. <HI>Cha. . first,</HI> in the Year 1638, which put that whole Kingdom in a Flame, and kindled a Civil War against that King, which ended in the Pacificaton of 1639. By one of the Articles of which, the said Attempt of Imposing the said Liturgy was declared illegal; so, much less was it Allow'd, Receiv'd, and Tolerated in the said Kingdom, in the late Happy Establishment of the Revolution: But the Presbyterian Church was Establish'd, and the Discipline, and Worship, and Government thereof declared to be the only Ecclesiastical Establishment of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and Episcopacy entirely abolish'd, by the <HI>1st</HI> Act of the first Parliament of <HI>William</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
and <HI>Mary;</HI> and confirm'd, explain'd and farther secured by seve∣ral subsequent Acts: Neither was any Attempt made, for the Erect∣ing the said <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, in the said Kingdom, from the said Re∣volution to the time of the Union; except such as might be done secretly, and in Remote Corners, the Government having taken no Cognizance thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That</HI> in the Act of Union, Ratified and Confirm'd by Parliament, <HI>An.</HI> 1707. The People of <HI>England</HI> have Covenanted and Agreed with the People of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> have ex∣presly United with the People of <HI>England,</HI> upon these Terms and no other, as to this Case—That the <HI>Purity</HI> and UNIFORMITY of the Worship, Discipline, and Government of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> shall be, and remain as now profess'd, to the People of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> WITHOUT ANY ALTERATON, to all succeding Gene∣rations.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>That,</HI> by the <HI>Ʋniformity of the Worship</HI> mention'd as above, it was expresly signified both in the Assembly and in the Parliament of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> then sitting, to mean the presrving the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Innovations of Worship; and in particular Tolerating the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy; tho' it was thought in Courtesie to <HI>England,</HI> decent to ex∣press it in modest Terms, <HI>(viz.) Ʋniformity of Worship and Discipline.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Having laid down these Fundamentals, which I believe no Man can deny, and therefore will not Dispute: We come of course to draw two most just Inferences.</P></Q>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That</HI> the People of <HI>England,</HI> have no Reason to expect that the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> should Admit, Receive, or Tolerate, the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy among them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That</HI> the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> have no Reason in kindness <HI>to Expect</HI> or in Justice <HI>to suffer themselves</HI> to be Impos'd upon, in Erecting the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy among them, which they never suffer'd in times of Episcopacy, and which the People there have a particular Aversion to.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. That the People of <HI>England</HI> ought not to expect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This is evident from the several Laws in <HI>Scotland,</HI> carefully Establishing, the present Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> all which Laws are Recognized and Confirmed by the Union; and since then it is against the Laws there, the <HI>English</HI> ought not to press the <HI>Scots</HI> in that Affair.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly,</HI> Because it is an Express Contravention of the Treaty of Union, which being a Solemn Treaty, and a Capitulation between the Nations, and more particularly of <HI>England</HI>'s making; ought to be kept Sacred, and not in the least Infringed by us, as we would not suffer the <HI>Scots</HI> on their part, to Infringe other Parts of it, more to our Disad∣vantage.</P></Q>
<P>It seems natural here however to bring in an Objection, which indeed is taken from the Mouth of the Party; and upon which the main Stir is at present made<HI>—Viz. That all this Argument lies only against Establishing the</HI> English Liturgy in Scotland, <HI>in the Kirk; or bringing it into the Publick Worship BY LAW which is not pretended to—But all that is now insisted</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<HI>on,</HI> is only Private Worship, <HI>in a separate manner from the Church, after the manner of the Dissenters in</HI> England; <HI>who being Tolerated</HI> in England <HI>by the Indulgence of the Church and Government, it is very hard the Church of</HI> England, <HI>who give that Indulgence here, should not obtain it there.</HI></P>
<P>This is giving the Adversary full Scope, and saying all for them, that they pretend to say for themselves.</P>
<P>Before we enter into the several Parts of this Objection, we shall make a brief Reply to the General; Thus<HI>—Suppose it is hard,</HI> as you call it, That the <HI>English</HI> Service should not be tolerated there, <HI>tho' it is not granted nei∣ther;</HI> yet you have no Authority to impose <HI>the redressing that Hardship</HI> upon the <HI>Scots—</HI>And it would be much harder upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> that since you have united with them, you should have Power to demand what you had nothing to do with before, and should clamour them out of or into, what <HI>by the way</HI> you have nothing to do with now—Viz. <HI>Suffering Innovations in the publick Worship;</HI> let us search for some Parallel Cases—</P>
<P>Suppose another <HI>Occasional Bill</HI> were brought into the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Commons</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in order to destroy the Toleration of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and to sub∣ject them again to Persecution. The <HI>Scots</HI> might say <HI>to the Church of Eng∣land,</HI> it was hard that the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> should be prosecuted in <HI>England,</HI> while <HI>they (the Scots)</HI> admitted the Episcopal Ministers even into their Churches, and establish'd Stipends in <HI>Scotland—</HI>And yet it would be more than probable, that the <HI>English Church-Men</HI> would tell their Brethren in <HI>Scotland, it was no Business of theirs,</HI> they might mind their own Affairs.</P>
<P>It is a great Hardship at this time in <HI>England,</HI> and what the <HI>Dissenters</HI> suffer great Inconveniencies <HI>by,</HI> that, notwithstanding the Toleration of <HI>Dissenters</HI> in the Worship of GOD according to their Consciences, <HI>is esta∣blishd by Parliament,</HI> yet they are not permitted to erect Schools for the In∣struction of their Children—As if the Toleration were intended only to ease such as are <HI>Dissenters</HI> now, and not to provide others to succeed them; or as if the <HI>Dissenter</HI> could satisfie himself to educate his Children in a way of Worship which he cannot conform to himself—And as if when I am tolerated to worship God according to my Conscience, I must not instruct my Child to do so too—And again, as to Academick Learning, <HI>which they alledge the</HI> Dissenters <HI>cannot by Law maintain;</HI> as if the <HI>Dissenters</HI> were to be tolerated in Worship, and be allow'd Meeting-houses, but not to breed up any Ministers; so that, <HI>when the present Race was to die off,</HI> they were to be without Ministers, and so were to have no publick Administration of Gospel Ordinances amongst them—And Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> in his late Speech owns the very Absurdity I complain of; tho' he glosses it over as well as he can, in these Words; <Q>“That Act, <HI>says he,</HI> was Intended for the ease of those, whose Minds through the unhappy prejudices of Education, were ALREADY Estranged from the Church; not <HI>as I Humbly conceive,</HI> to indulge Men in taking the most effectual Methods to propagate and” perpetuate their Schism—and from this Notion the Dr. calls the Dissen∣ters <HI>Erecting Seminaries for the Educating Youth,</HI> to be an Abuse of that Act, meaning the Act of Toleration.</Q> <HI>Vide</HI> Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Speech, <HI>first</HI> Edit. <HI>fol.</HI> 13.</P>
<P>These things indeed are Hardships upon the Dissenters in <HI>England.</HI> But pray, Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> if the <HI>Scots</HI> Presbyterians in <HI>Scotland</HI> should complain of these Hardships to the Parliament; if the Ge∣neral Assembly of the Kirk there, should make any Declaration against it, or
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
if they should appeal from any Sentence pass'd, in that Case to the Parliament; would not we in <HI>England</HI> take it very ill, and say, the Scots had nothing to do with it; and that this was the Consequence of the Union; that the Pres∣byterians began to encroach upon us; that our Church would be over∣run with their restless Spirits, and that the Union would be dangerous to the Church of <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P>Let us then make this Case our own; The granting Toleration to the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> has no more Foundation of Argument to engage <HI>Scot∣land to the like,</HI> than the general Allowance of Popery by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and recie∣ving a Provincial or Chief of the Jesuits in <HI>Holland,</HI> has to argue the like Li∣berty of Popery in <HI>England:</HI> The Reason is, Because these two Nations were before the Union, and the two Churches are still after the Union, absoluteiy separate <HI>from,</HI> unrelated <HI>to,</HI> and independent <HI>on</HI> one another; neither have they any Kind of Commerce or Correspondence one with another, nor do either Side pretend to desire it; <HI>so that</HI> what one allows or tolerates, or what the other rejects and refuses to tolerate, has no Manner of Reference to, or Concern in the same Circumstances on the other side.</P>
<P>But to enter a little into the closer Part of the Argument, <HI>viz.</HI> The Pre∣tence which has been made from a reciprocal Act of Kindness in one Nation to another, from which the Church of <HI>England</HI> Men <HI>argue,</HI> That it is hard <HI>Episcopal Dissenters</HI> should not be allow'd or tolerated in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the Kirk there, since <HI>Presbyterian Dissenters</HI> are tolerated by the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>This may be answer'd, first by Demur or Objection against the State of the Question, as it is vulgarly taken.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. According to the Doctrine of the famous Dr. <HI>Sacheverell,</HI> the <HI>Dissen∣ters</HI> are not tolerated in <HI>England,</HI> only exempted from certain Pe∣nalties.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a Mistake to say, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are tolerated by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> for their Toleration is an Act of the State—And perhaps if it were left to the Church, the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England</HI> might find as lit∣tle Favour, and some less, as the <HI>Episcopal Dissenters</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> do at this time—So that the Difference seems to lie only here, that the Kirk of <HI>Scotland</HI> has a Power in her Hands, which the Church of <HI>England</HI> has not; And some would be glad to see the Church of <HI>England</HI> make it out, that ever they had that Power in their Hand, and did not make a worse Use of it against <HI>Dissenters,</HI> than ever the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> since they have had this Power in their Hand, has done against the <HI>Episcopal</HI> People there, and therefore the Church has no∣thing to argue here; if any thing is to be said, it is in the Name of the Civil Government on either side—And let them argue it—In which Case the <HI>Scots</HI> speak thus.</P></Q>
<P>The Thing called Toleration is of three sorts; Toleration of Episco∣pacy, Toleration of Non-Jurors, and Toleration of the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy; and in both we are more than upon the Square with the Church of <HI>Eng∣land.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Toleration of Episcopacy;</HI> say the <HI>Scots,</HI> we give more Toleration to it by Law, than the Church of <HI>England</HI> gives to the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>England</HI> by Law; and this the Gentlemen have been often put in mind of by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the <HI>Act of the first Parliament of William and Mary</HI> cited to them; <HI>by which it is</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
<HI>Enacted, that all these Episcopal Ministers, who would qualifie themselves by ta∣king the Oaths—should Continue in their Churches, Enjoy their Livings, and Parsonage Houses; and they do so to this Day,</HI> to the Number of above a sixth part of all the Parishes in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>If this be not Toleration by Law, then let the Church of <HI>England</HI> shew the like Toleration, before they complain of the <HI>Scots—</HI>But say some, <HI>that are forward to find Objections,</HI> This is but a Temporary Conni∣vence, and here is no Provision to PROPAGATE and PERPETUATE Episcopacy; let this be a good Objection in whose Mouth it will, it can∣not be good in the present Argument, nor in the Mouth of a Church of <HI>England</HI> Man; unless they will first Burn Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI>'s Speech, and Condemn it by a publick Act of the Church—Wherein he says, the Toleration as before quoted of Dissenters, was Temporary<HI>—And in∣tended for the Ease of their Minds, who were ALREADT</HI> (mark the Word) <HI>Estranged from the Church, not to Indulge Men in taking the most effectual Me∣thods to Propagate and Perpetuate their Schism.</HI> Vid. <HI>Sach.</HI> Speech <HI>pag.</HI> 3.</P>
<P>We are now upon the Alternative between the Nations, and Dis∣coursing of the pretended Hardships, and the Unkindness of not allowing Toleration to Dissenters in one, as well as in the other; if then it is proved the <HI>Scots</HI> do grant as much, or more Toleration than the <HI>English,</HI> then 'tis presumed this Argument will be sufficiently handled; in the above Case it is Clear, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> must stand Debtor to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the placing 150 <HI>Presbyterian Ministers</HI> in so many good Livings and Parish Churches in <HI>England—</HI>When that Debt shall be paid, we may talk farther.</P>
<P>Let us next enquire into Toleration of EPISCOPAL NON-JURORS, or as vulgarly express'd, <HI>Toleration of Jacobitsm;</HI> and here it is evident, the <HI>Scots</HI> will be Creditors again, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> Debtors, in the great Account Current of Toleration,</P>
<P>You need not be Informed in <HI>England,</HI> how the most peaceable, quiet and Conscientious Non-Jurors here, are Treated; We will not say, but that there are many, and perhaps many Thousands in <HI>England,</HI> who meerly on Principles of Conscience, having Sworn Allegiance to the Late King <HI>James</HI> and his Heirs<HI>—In which Case the Oath in those Days, was very Express and Severly Worded,</HI> do still think themselves bound in Conscience by that Oath, and that as long as any of the Lawful Issue, or legally succeeding Race of that King, remain alive, they are bound by that Oath, against all other whatsoever. These People say, they cannot join in Worship with the present Establishment, they cannot call them the Church of <HI>England</HI> but think them really Schismatical, and that they have forsaken their Principles, they cannot Pray for her Majesty as Law∣ful Sovereign, for they cannot Acknowledge her to be such; much less can they Swear Allegiance to her, their Allegiance being already pre∣engag'd by Oath.</P>
<P>It is not to the present Purpose, to enquire how far these People are mi∣staken, or how far their Principle is honest or not—It is out of Question that such People there are, in both parts of <HI>Britain—</HI>If Toleration is due to all Christians by a Native Right, in Matters meerly Conscientious, and if these being otherwise quiet and peaceable, give no Disturbance to the Government: These may Claim some share surely in the Conside∣ration of their Brethren Protestants, in both parts of <HI>Britain,</HI> at least as to the Affair of Worship—Being also all of them Episcopal.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
Now let us examine how it stands with these People, in either part of <HI>Britain</HI> at this time: In <HI>Scotland</HI> their Meetings are permitted, there are at least 15 of them in <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> they are Open and Publick, Frequented and Undisturb'd, in <HI>Leith, Muscelbro', Dalkeith, Haddington, Dunbar, Dundee, Perth, Montross, Aberdeen, Frazersburgh, Inverness, Sterling, Lithgow, Dumfermling, Glasgow, Dumfreis,</HI> and in Multitudes of Places more—Here they Worship their own Way, they neither take the Oaths to qualifie them for this Liberty, nor do they Pray for the Queen; for they do not Acknowledge her as their Sovereign; nay they frequently Pray for her Enemy the Pretender, sometimes Directly and Expressly, and almost always Obliquely and Indirectly; beside this Connivence there are publick Collections of Charity Yearly, for the Relief of the Dispossess'd Episcopal Ministers, and their Widows, and Families; and this is Distributed openly, to those that are Jacobites professedly so, and refuse either to take the Oaths, or to Pray for their Sovereign: Some have said that it is Distributed to none but such—Yet to this the Presby∣terians constantly and openly Contribute, and their Ministers in par∣ticular.</P>
<P>Let us now Enquire into what of this kind is practis'd in <HI>South-Britain,</HI> by that same Party of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who cry out of the want of Toleration in <HI>Scotland—</HI>Let the Jacobite-Clergy speak to this Head; and let them tell us, what Connivence at their Meetings, or what Charitable Contribution have even the most quiet, peaceable, and consci∣entious <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> found from the Church of <HI>England?</HI> Have they been permitted to hold Meetings in any Manner whatsoever? Have they been allow'd the least Liberty of worshipping God according to their Conscien∣ces, unless they would in open Defiance of their profess'd Principle, take the Oaths?</P>
<P>Again; what Charity, what Contribution, what Relief has been afford∣ed to those, who being dispossess'd of their Livings, and who having stript themselves of their Wordly Comforts, to preserve their Conscien∣ces, in point of Swearing, have been abandon'd to all the Extremeties of Poverty, Nay, some of them to down-right Beggary and Starving?</P>
<P>Thus your Brethren in <HI>Scotland</HI> have gone beyond you, and you are Debtor upon this Head; the allowing the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Meetings for Worship, without Swearing to, or Praying for the Queen; and the Contributing in Charity, for the Poor Dispossess'd Clergy, that cannot in Conscience take the Oaths, who to this Day are expos'd in short, to a shameful Di∣stress among us in <HI>England;</HI> I say shameful, because certainly they that are Conscientious among us, however Circumstances may set us against them in Point of Interest, should never be excluded in Point of Charity—And if we are commanded, if our Enemy Hunger, to Feed him, doubt∣less our Excluded Brethren should not be suffer'd to Perish. The <HI>Scots Presbyterians</HI> are as remote from <HI>Jacobitism</HI> as any People in the World; yet as Christianity Teaches them, so Humanity prompts them to open their Hears and Hands, to Feed even those they Depose and Reject, as to the publick Receiving them into the Church: Since tho' they are Sentenc'd to be put out of their Livings, they are by no Law doom'd to be starv'd—In this therefore the <HI>Scots</HI> go beyond us, both in Toleration, and in Christian Charity.</P>
<P>The <HI>3d</HI> Article of Toleration only remains, and in this they stand Debtors to <HI>England, (Viz.)</HI> They will not Tolerate the Common-Prayer Book in <HI>Scotland:</HI>

And we on the other Hand, omitting the great Debt we are in to them, upon the two Articles above, make loud Clamours at them, as if Tole∣rating <HI>Episcopacy</HI> even in the very Churches, and <HI>Jacobitism</HI> in Meeting-Houses, were not enough, or indeed were nothing at all.</P>
<P>Now saving to the <HI>Scots,</HI> that truly we have nothing to do to require Toleration of them, or so much as to ask of them why they refuse it; and remembring that in point of Kindness, and Equivalent for the Tole∣rating <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> are their Debtors three for one; and will not Pay that Debt, tho' just enough in point of Equality to be demanded; yet let us come to some other Answers, why we ought not to expect it of them.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That as to Toleration of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> by Law, the <HI>Episcopal</HI> People in <HI>Scotland</HI> neither desire it, nor would accept it, unless you would give it them without the Incumbrance of Oaths, or obliging them to Pray for Queen <HI>Anne,</HI> which they will not do; and if they wou'd, their People would not hear them; to Tolerate them, would be to Divide and De∣stroy them; those that now possess Churches upon taking the Oaths must quit them, and take to Meeting-Houses; and those that would not take the Oaths, must be entirely suppress'd, as in <HI>England,</HI> which would create a worse Persecution, than any has yet been known among them; so that a Toleration, or Act of Exemption in <HI>Scotland,</HI> would make a worse Confusion than there is now: Nor do any of the Parties desire it, or would any of them accept of it; the <HI>Episcopal</HI> People that would take the Oaths, would be much worse than they are now, and therefore they would not accept of it, for the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Minister who now possesses a Parish, a Stipend and Manse, cannot be supposed to quit his Possession to set up a Meeting-House, perhaps get few Hearers, and no certain, if any Contribution or Allowance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Non-Juror</HI> that could not take the Oaths, could not accept of this Legal Toleration at all, because it would certainly be clog'd with Oaths, Ab∣jurations, praying for the Queen, and submitting to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church in Discipline, which they will never do, and consequently would be quite crusht and left worse than before.</P>
<P>It remains then, that there is not the least Complaint left, for want of any Toleration, but to the Common-Prayer Book—A Thing, neither Swearing <HI>Episcopal,</HI> nor Jacobite <HI>Episcopal,</HI> ever knew in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or practised; even when the National Church was <HI>Episcopal,</HI> when they were all one, and when they had the Power in their Hands—A Thing which very few, even of the <HI>Non-Jurors</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to do them Justice, will comply with, or do now practise—A Thing which <HI>Scotland</HI> itself posi∣tively Capitulated against in the Union, and which <HI>England</HI> has Bargain'd, Contracted, expressly Stipulated and Agreed to, and with the <HI>Scots,</HI> never to impose upon them.</P>
<P>Now have the Enemies of the Union no Hole left, at which they may creep in, to Undermine the Peace of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and Destroy the very Foundation of the Treaty, But this single Article of the Common-Prayer—And this they must have, or else they must pretend to Perse∣cution. The miscarriage of King <HI>Charles</HI> I. indeed is no sufficient Warn∣ing to these People, for it is a miscarriage which they want—It is a Confusion of Nations, and a Breach of the Union that they want—Some are fond of saying the <HI>Scots</HI> are too Tenacious of their own Opinions, and it is an Error, that their People are so warm, (in the West especially)
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
that they will not suffer any thing among them, that does not come up to their heights<HI>—Very well,</HI> suppose this an Infirmity, and yet since the Government of <HI>Scotland</HI> knew, that these People could not be forc'd, and that great Depredations had been made upon them, and much Blood spilt to break in upon them, and that yet they adhered to their Principles, and would do so, but might by little and little, and by soft and gentle Methods, be brought to Unite with the Establishment; it was their Pru∣dence then, to prevent further Impositions on them, in things which they knew would enrage them, and put them out of the Government even of themselves, and therefore they were in the Right to provide in the Union, that no sort of Innovations should be impos'd upon them of any kind whatsoever, especially such as that of the <HI>English</HI> Worship, to which they knew the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> even the <HI>Episcopal</HI> People themselves had a particular and constant Aversion.</P>
<P>Thus we are brought down by just Degrees to the Story of Mr. <HI>Green∣shields,</HI> of whom so much Noise is made; who having made the Attempt in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to set up the Common-Prayer there, has been censur'd by the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and Imprison'd by the Magistrates, and lies now in the <HI>Tol-booth</HI> for refusing to obey the said Sentence, and to refrain Exercising the Office of a Minister, in the Bounds of that <HI>Presbytery;</HI> they being also satisfied of his having no Legal <HI>Episeopal</HI> Ordination, no not in his own Way, being Ordain'd by a Bishop, without Presbyters, and that Bishop Exauctorate by the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>The History of the Man is very short, unless we should enter into the Detail of his Character, as to his Morals, which is not the Design of of this Work—Only in brief, you may take it upon the Knowledge of many Honest Men in the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who are Favourers enough of his Design; That his Practice will not bear a Character, that he is a Prophane, Profligate and Immoral Person—And if he pleases to enter into the Defence of his own Character, he shall hear more of it.</P>
<P>This Man coming from <HI>Ireland,</HI> where he had a small Subsistence of 14 <HI>l. Per Annum</HI> at most, at <HI>Tinan</HI> and having a large Family to Main∣tain, which he hoped to make some better Provision for at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> Arrives at the said City about. . . . . 1709. It is not material to say what is alledg'd by some, that he was sent thither by Concert, for the Design: But this is certain, That being there, he is laid hold of by a Party, whose Aim was visibly to disturb the Peace of that Country, as a fit Instrument, being Poor, Mercenary, and made forward by the In∣couragement of the Party.</P>
<P>Having gotten the Instrument, they resolve upon the Attempt of set∣ting up openly, and in the Face of the Government, the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy; An Attempt which had once before prov'd Fatal to its Undertakers, and had put the whole Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> into a Flame; an Attempt they very well knew was the ready Way to make a New Rupture, and unra∣vel the Solemn Contract of Union, so lately and so firmly Establish'd—Between the Kingdoms.</P>
<P>Before I come to the manner of the Attempt, and the Conduct of the Man in it: It may be needful to examine a little the Pretences made for it, and the Methods taken to prepare the People for, and Intoduce it:</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
<HI>First,</HI> It was industriously spread about the Country, and at the same time, at <HI>London</HI> also, which shews the Concert of Parties, That Her Majesty had granted the Royal Chapel of <HI>Haly-rood-House</HI> to be fitted up for the setting up the <HI>English</HI> Service, at the Humble Request, and for the Use of the <HI>English</HI> Gentlemen, who were plac'd there in the several publick Employments of the Exchequer, Customes, Excise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Who could not conform to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Worship; and this they carry'd so far, as to cause it come down from <HI>London</HI> in some of the written News, and drew in a weak and ignorant News-writer in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> unwarily to Print it again; for which he receiv'd a just Reprimand from the Govern∣ment, and narrowly escaped having been sent to the <HI>Tolbooth.</HI></P>
<P>His having, as we say, broach'd the thing in the World, and that it had been talk'd of a little: The next thing, was to draw in some other weak and unwary Gentlemen of the several Offices, to close with a Proposal of setting up the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy in the City, and raising a Subscription for the Maintenance of a Minister—particularly this Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI> to whom they promised the Sum of Eighty Pound Pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>The principal Hands to this, were among the <HI>English</HI> Officers of the Custom and Exchequer, and some few others whom the Party had made the Dupes of the Project, and the Cat's Foot to put in the Fire, and thus the Subscription began. But Sir <HI>Alexander Rigby,</HI> the first Commissioner of the Customs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> tho' himself a zealous Church of <HI>England-man,</HI> yet seeing farther than the rest into the mischievous Consequences of this Design, and knowing how contrary to her <HI>Majesty's</HI> firm Resolution of main∣taining the <HI>Scots</HI> in all their just Rights, this Attempt was; Upon the first Complaint that was made to him by the Lord Advocate of <HI>Scotland,</HI> re∣lating to it, caused an Order to be made, That the Secretary of their Board should immediately make Enquiry into the thing, and return the Names of such as had been concern'd in this Project, that her Majesty might be acquainted of it. Upon which, the Persons not daring to own their Design, and being a little better inform'd of the Nature of what they were going to do, cancelled their Subscription, and abandoned the Design—thus the Vigour and Prudence of that one Gentleman, disappointed the Incendiaries, and also saved the Gentlemen con∣cern'd, from running too far in a thing which must certainly have ruin'd them, as to their Offices—and for which, <HI>whither they will acknowledge it or no,</HI> they are very much in Debt to him.</P>
<P>While this was transacting, and to encourage the Subscription, Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> takes a House in one of the most publick Places of the City, opposite to the Cross of <HI>Einburgh—</HI>and so publick, that at the filling or coming out of the Churches, they being supposed to end at the usual Hours, they would of necessity meet the Magistrates of the City both at their Going and Coming: Having taken, and fitted up this House for a Chapel, he openly begins the Office of a Preacher, reading the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy Morning and Evening before Sermon, as is usual in the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> allarm'd with this Novelty, and more especi∣ally, with the open and avow'd Manner of it—which had many Circum∣stances in it, calculated to affront and enrage the People, and if possible, to move them to some Riot or Tumult—began to shew themselves very uneasie.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
However, they were restrain'd by the Prudence of some of the princi∣pal Inhabitants, from using any violent Methods with them; but the Commission of the General Assembly being then to meet, the Inhabi∣tants agreed to Petition them for the suppressing these Innovations, accor∣ding to Law, at the same time presenting a Petition on the like Occasion, to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> Which Petitions I have here inserted at large, that the World may see the true Ground and Manner of the First Proceedings in this Case.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Unto the very Reverend and Honourable the Commission of the late General Assembly of the Church of</HI> Scotland.</HEAD>
<HEAD><HI>We the Neighbourhood of the Town of</HI> Edinburgh <HI>and Suburbs under∣scrib'd, do most humbly represent,</HI></HEAD>
<P><Q>“THAT notwithstanding the many good Laws and Acts of Parlia∣ment, and particulary the Act 6 and 7 Parliaments, 1707. made for the Settlement and Security of this National Church, and against all Encroachments upon her Right or Privileges, or Innovations in her Doctrine, Worship, Discipline, or Government; And of her Majesty's repeated Assurances in her Royal Proclamations, Letters to her Privy-Council, and the General Assemblies of this Church, to maintain and defend the same in its present Establishments, against all such unlawful Intrusions, Incroachments, and Innovations, particularly her Majesty's Proclamation against unlawful Intruders into Churches and Manses in” <HI>Scotland,</HI> dated <HI>Septemb.</HI> 20. 1708.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Yet, to our very great Surprize, several of the Episcopal Clergy (prompted and instigate thereunto by the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, who are equal∣lydisaffected to the Civil as to our Ecclesiastick Constitution) have of late not only Erected Meeting-houses in this City, after the <HI>Scots</HI> Epis∣copal Way, but also in several Places here have set up the <HI>English</HI> Ser∣vice, which as it is contrair to our Establishment, and very grievous and offensive to us and all others, who are well-affected to her Maje∣sty and the present Establishment, so it will be of fatal and dangerous” Consequence to this Church, if not speedily remedy'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It would be consider'd in the <HI>first</HI> Place, That several of such as preach in these Meeting-houses are known to be, not only unsound in their Judgments, but also scandalous and immoral in their Lives and Practices; And however they may pretend to be qualify'd according to Law, yet if they were not secret, and Heart-Enemies to Her Majesty and thepresent Government, they would never yield themselves Tools to” a <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party, for carrying on of their wicked and pernicious Designs.</Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>“Secondly,</HI> They cannot pretend it to be Matter of Conscience, in set∣ting up of the <HI>English</HI> Service here, for abstracting from <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> even the Body and Bulk of the Episcopal Perswasion in <HI>Scotland</HI> have never been fond of the <HI>English</HI> Way of Worship; but upon many Occa∣sions have testify'd their Dislike of the same, and none of them scruple to joyn in Communion with this Church, but such as are either openly profane, and will not subject to Church-Discipline, or avow'd <HI>Jaco∣bites.</HI></Q>” And therefore,</P>
<P><Q><HI>“Thirdly,</HI> We conceive, That by these illegal and unwarrantable En∣croachments, Intrusions, and Innovations, they design no less than the Ruin of both Church and State; for as the setting up of the <HI>English</HI> Ser∣vice here did in former Times breed much Trouble and Confusion in this Church and Nations, so at present it does raise and foment Jealou∣sies and Heart-burnings in the Minds of People, otherwise zealously af∣fected to her Majesty's Person and Government, and exceedingly widens the Breach betwixt us and the separating Parties on both hands; And the Instigators to, and Abettors of these Practices are in big Hopes, and not without good and evident Grounds, that this will prove an effe∣ctual Means of alienating the Hearts and Affections of many of our
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
QUEEN's best and most Loyal Subjects, from her Majesty's Person and the present Establishment; and that by that Means they shall effe∣ctually wound and weaken the Church on both sides, and also ruin the” Civil Government.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“We must also humbly represent, That albeit we have many good and laudable Laws and Acts of Parliament against Popery and Papists, their trafficking and practising in <HI>Scotland,</HI> particularly against their Teach∣ing of any Science, Art and Exercise within the same, and against all Irreligion and Blasphemies; yet Papists do openly and avowedly teach and practise, even within the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> and Suburbs. And now also a profane and deluded Crew of Enthusiasts are set up in this Place, who, under Pretence to the Spirit of Prophecy, do utter most horrid Blasphemies against the ever Glorious Trinity, such as ought not to be suffer'd in any Christian Church or Nation, seeing this strikes at the very Root and Vitals of all Religion, and is set on Foot of <HI>Satan”</HI> to confound (if possible) all solid Thoughts of a Deity amongst us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“We have for Brevity's Sake represented but a few of the many Incon∣veniencies that will certainly follow the Sufferings of such Practices, and do judge it our Duty in all Humility, to lay them before the Reve∣rend Commission, seeing you are set by the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> upon the Watch-Tower, to advert, that the Interest of Jesus Christ, and the present Establishment of this Church, do not suffer or sustain any Pre∣judice which you can prevent, prrticularly to take special Care to keep and mainain Unity in the Church upon all Emergents; And to see to the due Execution of the Acts of Assemblies, which are very plain and express against such Innovations in the Worship of God, particularly the Act 15 <HI>Gen. Assembly,</HI> 1707. And therefore humbly and earnestly beg and entreat, That as you tender the Glory of God, the Peace and Unity of this Church, and the Quiet and Safety of her Majesty's Govern∣ment, you would use your utmost Endeavours for suppressing and crush∣ing such intolerable and pernicious Practices and Designs in the” Bud—</Q></P>

<P>Here it should be observ'd, That the Dean of <HI>Guild</HI> of the City of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI> whether by Information of the Persons of whom the said <HI>Green∣shields</HI> had taken it as a Tenant, or of other People, finding what was do∣ing, and of what ill Consequence it was like to be; whether it was true, as some alledg'd, that he had done something injurious to the House be∣beyond his Contract, is not material—but he cites them before the Town-Courts, of which he is Judge, and by their Law disposessed them of their House which was so publick—Upon which they remove, and take a Place more private, and where it made less Appearance. Nor will the Clamour of Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> hold Water here against the Legality of this Proceeding; for every one knows (and no doubt but he knew) that by the Law of the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Dean of <HI>Guild</HI> has Power to judge of all Alterations in any Building, and may prohibit the pulling down Partitions of Walls in any House: Nor may any Alteration in the main Building in any House be done without his Approbation—And such Power is reasonably vested in that Magistrate, because the Houses being generally built in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as our Sets of Chambers are in the <HI>Temple,</HI> or other Inns of Court, where every Floor is; or may be a separate Pro∣perty, it is reasonable nothing should be done, to the weakning or da∣maging the Floor Above.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16"/>
But the Stroak was struck before this could be done; perhaps, had they begun in private, and with Modesty, no Notice had been taken at all—But that wou'd not have answer'd the Design—And indeed, this very thing takes off the Pretence of Conscience in this Matter; for if it had been purely a Principle of Conscience in the Episcopal Gentlemen, either <HI>English</HI> or <HI>Scots,</HI> in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> that they could not conform to the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Worship, and desir'd to Worship God according to their Consciences; then had they no need to have set up a new Meeting∣house, since there were two or three in the City before, who kept Meet∣houses, and who had always used the Common-Prayer, <HI>and do so still,</HI> un∣disturb'd. Nor can it be alledg'd, that they were crowded, or that there was not Room for them; since one Place, and that none of the Largest, would easily hold all of the Episcopal People in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> who follow'd that kind of Worship; since of Fifteen Episcopal Meeting-houses that were in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but Two or Three ever used it, and they with a very small Number of Respondents.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>English</HI> Officers that were there, those few that offer'd at it, had they been really so conscientious, might have found a more just Method by far, for the satisfying their Consciences in Matters of Worship, <HI>(viz.)</HI> By returning into <HI>England,</HI> and Worshiping their God there, leaving the Pro∣fits of Employments in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> who they will not per∣mit in <HI>England</HI> to enjoy the least Office of Profit or Trust, without a full Conformity to the National Church, not in Hearing and Worship only, but in Communion; and it seems very unequal, that a Nation who exclude all the <HI>Scottish</HI> Subjects from any Trust or Profit among them, as to publick things, but upon full Compliance with their Church, should send People among the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> to possess the best Offices in their Country, and at the same time, fly in the Face of the Establish'd Religion of the Nation, tho' solemnly Recognized by the Government and Church in their own Country, to be the true Protestant Religion—This is a thing so hard, and the Circumstances so unjust, that I cannot but hint it to the Gentlemen concern'd, and let them know, that their Conduct is taken Notice of by their Superiours, and will not be long born with.</P>
<Q><HI>Nor would it be amiss to tell some of those</HI> English-men, <HI>without reflecting upon some a∣mong them of better Conduct—That before they expect the People in</HI> England <HI>should believe the Pretentions they make to Scruple of Conscience in Matters of Religion, they would do well to take a little more Care of their Morals, that they do not demonstrate they have no Religionat all, and they not bring a Scandal upon their Country and Church, and assist Common Fame to make it a just Proverb in</HI> Scotland, As drunk as an <HI>English-man,</HI> and to swear like an <HI>English-man—'Tu very strange there should be found among some Men so much Conscience of Ceremony, and so little Conscience of Morality.</HI></Q>
<P>But to return to Mr. <HI>Greenshields;</HI> As I observe, that on the part of the wiser Inhabitants, great Endeavours were used to prevent the Peo∣ple committing any Disorders or Excesses, and that their Care of the Peace was very effectual, not the least Violence having been offer'd him; so there were not wanting another Party, who as diligently endeavour'd to provoke and stir up the People to <HI>Riot</HI> and <HI>Tumult;</HI> Rumours and Reports were raised and promoted, of Threatnings to Rabble the said <HI>Greenshields,</HI> and several Methods used to bring it to pass<HI>—but to no Pur∣pose—</HI>It seems hard indeed, to lay this Part upon Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI> or his Party, who, in such Tumult might have had a Fate no Man can have supposed to desire—But there are a Party of Men, who will some∣times sacrifice their Friends to carry an Interest; and it is since very well known what Interest such a thing would have served, and how useful a Defence it would have been to the late Tumults and Rabblings of the
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
<HI>Dissenters</HI> Meeting-houses in <HI>London,</HI> and else-where, which no doubt, was then, and before that, Concerted, <HI>and for this Work no question it was Calcu∣lated.</HI> But God, and the Wisdom of the People of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> prevented it, and so the Gentlemen have been driven to the Necessity of Rabbling the Meet∣ing-houses in <HI>London,</HI> without the Excuse of having an Example, or Provocation from <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI> thus disappointed in his Place, and the Design of in∣sulting the Magistrates, by placing his Meeting just opposite to the En∣trance into Four Churches, he set up in a Place a little more private, and where, had he began at first, perhaps less Notice had been taken—But the Petition before having been presented to the Commission of the Assembly, they could not well avoid taking a general Notice of it, at least, they had not discharged their Duty, if they had not taken Notice of it, other Addresses coming in at the same time, from other Parts.</P>
<P>Whereupon, they publish'd an Act of the Commission of the General Assembly, being the same recited in Mr. <HI>Greenshield</HI>'s Case, and which his Friends propose some Advantage by Publishing, tho' it was also Print∣ed by the Commissions Order, and dispersed over the whole Kingdom—By which Act, the Commission refers it to the respective Presbyteries to take Cognizance of Innovations, and to proceed judicially against the Persons guilty of intruding into the Church, or of making and introducing Innovations in Worship, according to Law.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but take Notice to mark it as a Deficiency in all the Answerers and Desenders of these Cases, tho' otherwise very exactly done—That they seem to avoid, as if afraid to allow, that the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> should make any judicial Process against, or absolutely refuse to allow the Introducing the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, and other Innovations in Worship into <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>True it is; <HI>and as to</HI> Greenshield<HI>'s Case, it is arguing</HI> ad Hominem, there has not been the least Step taken of that Kind with him, for he lies in so many Points open to the Law besides, that there was no manner of Oc∣casion for it—And I cannot but wonder, the Author of the Pamph∣let, setting forth his Case, would undertake either to speak so much against Knowledge, or to speak of a Case at all which he had so little Knowledge of—The Truth of the Fact is plainly thus:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He was summoned as being a Stranger only, and having exercised the Office of a Minister without any apparent Authority; and this is own'd in his Case—And the first Question asked of him, was to the same Purpose—What Authority he Had to Execute the Office of a Minister in that place?</P>
<P>To this, his <HI>Answer</HI> was, That he was a Minister of the Church of <HI>England—</HI>But he was obliged immediately to detect himself of Falshood in that, when being required to produce his Letter of Ordination, he shew'd Letters of Ordination, which stiled him a Minister of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> (meaning the Episcopal-Church.)</P>
<P>To cover this Prevarication, he tells them, The Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Episcopal Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were encorporated by the Union—This wretched Shift indeed exposed him very much—but the upper Part of his Face sustained that, and he insisted upon it.</P>
<P>His Ordination then was examined, and found to be irregular, as be∣ing from an Exauctorate Deposed Bishop, who, by the Laws of <HI>Scotland,</HI> can have no Right to Ordain Ministers to be receiv'd by the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is the Objection his Advocate makes, of any Force, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Bishop, tho' Deposed, is not Unpresbyter'd—for that, by the Laws
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he is so far divested of all Power, that he cannot act as a Bishop, or as a Pres∣byter either, in the Church, whatever he may do any where else; and these Laws have a particular Sanction added to them from the Episcopal Church in <HI>Scotland</HI> themselves, who when they were Establish'd, acknowledg'd and own'd <HI>the Power of appointing Officers in the Church to be inherent in the Crown—Vide</HI> 1 Act, 1 Sess. 2 Parl. <HI>Cha.</HI> II. Where it is declared by the Episcopal People themselves,</P>
<P><Q>“That to his Majesty, and his Successors, the Ordering and Disposal of the External Government, and Policy of the Church, doth propetly belong, as an Inherent Right of” the Crown.</Q></P>
<P>Now 'tis evident, that these Bishops being depriv'd by the Regal Authority, and that Re∣gal Authority being acknowledg'd by them, to have Power to deprive them, no Act they can do as Ecclesiasticks, relating to the Church, can be binding to the Church, or ought to be receiv'd by the Church as Lawful—and by consequence, no Ordination of Ministers by them can be imposed upon the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Invalidity of his Ordination, it is true, Mr. <HI>Greenshields</HI> was Sentenc'd, and no doubt, the Process was very just—And as every thing in it has been done legally and regu∣lar, the Appeal which he hath brought before the House of Lords, will no Doubt be reje∣cted, or if not, will rather confirm by their Sentence what has been done in <HI>Scotland,</HI> than otherwise repeal it.</P>
<P>But to speak to that Part of this Cause which relates to the Innovation it self, and the setting up the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> for whatever may be the present Case of <HI>Green∣shields,</HI> it is allow'd the other lies at the Bottom on both Sides.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted, but had <HI>Greenshields</HI> given the clearest Account imaginable of himself, he would have been sentenc'd by the Presbytery, to forbear the Common-Prayer within their Bounds, and been Imprisoned by the Magistrates, if he had refused to submit to it; and therefore, with Submission to the Author of the Remarks on <HI>Greenshield</HI>'s Case, his concealing this, and only answering in the Negative to the Charge, is not a Defence so much to the Honour, either of the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> or of the Constitution and Authority of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and its Establishment by the Union, as it were to be wished had been.</P>
<P>It is true, that Book does, with a great deal of Judgment, effectually confute the specious Pretensions of the Party, who have raised a Clamour upon the Imprisonment of this par∣ticular Man, as if persecuted <HI>qua</HI> Church of <HI>England,</HI> and meerly for reading the Com∣mon-Prayer—But if we were to speak to the Provost and Baylies of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it would be very proper to say, <HI>Pray Gentlemen,</HI> What does this signifie to you, or what Advantage does this gain to you? The Case is thus;</P>
<P>This <HI>Greenshields,</HI> was a Tool, pick't out by the Party to make the Essay: Not, whe∣ther the Erecting the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy might go down with you or no; for 'tis apparent, that was not the Design, but to Essay, whether Erecting it in the Teeth of Magistracy, and in Defiance of Law, would pass upon you or no; and either Way they had gain'd their Ends upon you.</P>
<Q><P N="1">(1.) If you had tamely born with it, then they had found you were to be insulted, and they would have been the first to cry out, The Union was broke; and conse∣quently have put other Breaches upon you by the same Rule.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) If you had resolved not to bear it, then they depended upon it, you would oppose it one or two Ways: (1.) By Riot and Tumult, which 'tis evident they wished most for, and strove hard to bring to pass; in which Case there was some Prospect of embroiling you with Magistracy itself, and the Government; or, (2.) By Law, and the common Form, and then they had the Church of <HI>England</HI> to cry to, and pretend Persecution.</P></Q>
<P>Now, as the last of these only is come to pass, suppose you have disappointed them by taking their Instrument by a Handle they did not expect—What then? What is this to the Purpose? They are then defeated only in their Instrument, and the Consequence is nothing but this, That next time they must seek out another Tool, against whom these Objections will not lie, and then their Work is done—And the Easiness of this is such, as need give them no Discouragement.</P>
<P>Suppose the Gentleman who wrote this Remark, was asked by the Episcopal Party—Well, Sir, you insist, that this Man is not Imprisoned for Reading the Common-Prayer, but so and so, for Exercising the Office of a Minister, without a legal Call, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> You grant then, that had he been a lawful Minister, he might have officiated; and that for Reading the <HI>English</HI> Service, you could not have proceeded—What, would have been Answer'd? <HI>If it had been granted—</HI>They had no more to say but this; Well then, we will get another, against whose Ordination you will not object: And with him, we may set up the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy, even at the Cross<HI>—If it had been deny'd them,</HI> then the Pretence
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
of Persecution follows<HI>—And it must be said,</HI> tho' with the utmost Respect to the Author of the Remarks, who has shewn a great Deal of Wit, Learning, and Dexterity in his Argu∣ment, and who appears perfectly skill'd in the Constitution (tho' utterly unknown to the Author of this) yet, with his Pardon, he has left this Case as he hath found it—and the Episcopal Party, are only like a General of an Army, who besieging a Town, and having attack'd it by Battery and Storm, and been bravely beaten off by the Garrison, says to his Officers, <HI>Well then, we must take another Method, we will take them by Sapping and Mining.</HI> But still the Town shall be taken.</P>
<P>It is humbly conceived therefore, that tho' proving this Man is not prosecuted for Read∣ing the <HI>English</HI> Service, most plainly confutes the Party, and effectually answers all their Cries of Persecution; yet it does not do the Work, it does not prevent the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI> being daily insulted by other Instruments, against whom, the same Advantages cannot be taken.</P>
<P>But to prove effectually, that by the Constitution of <HI>Scotland,</HI> before the Union, by the Establishment of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in the Act of Security, and by the Postulata of the Union, the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy cannot be imposed upon them, or tolerated by them, but that they are obliged to oppose it, and prosecute the Innovators: This is to do the Work at once—and then no Man can charge the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> with persecuting the Church of <HI>England,</HI> without <HI>first</HI> owning the Church of <HI>England</HI> to be an Encroacher upon her Neigh∣bour Church, a Breaker of Articles and Solemn Treaties, and offering to impose, not upon the Consciences only, but upon the Privileges of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>It may therefore be allow'd, that the Innovators in Matters of Worship, and those who will offer to impose the Common-Prayer upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> will always be prosecuted by the Law there; otherwise the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> must give up their Privileges, and establish'd Rights, and suffer themselves to be imposed upon, by a restless, insulting Party from one thing to another: <HI>For 'tis evident, they will not rest here,</HI> till all their Privileges are trampled under Foot, as well Civil as Ecclesiastical.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER what has been said to the Case in general, it may not be unnecessary to say a Word or two to the Man himself—The Process against him, as their own Testimony allows, is not for Innovations in Worship, tho' that had been effectually justified, as before—But for his being in no wise qualify'd as a Minister—So that had he only preach'd, and ne∣ver read the <HI>English</HI> Service at all, he had been liable to the same Prosecution.</P>
<P>In this Prosecution, the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> and after them, the <HI>Magistracy</HI> have acted free from Partiality, Passion, or Prejudice, according to the Laws of <HI>Scotland</HI> in every Respect, as is most unanswerably proved by the Learned Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> upon their printed Case.</P>
<P>The Authority of the Government to depose Episcopacy, is acknowledg'd by the Episco∣pal People themselves, in that famous Act of Parliament made by themselves, and quoted before, in which they own, that the Right of placing Officers in the Church, is inherent in the Crown—The Crown then, pursuant to that declared Right, having deposed not so much the Persons of the Bishops, but the very OFFICE of a Bishop in the Church, it cannot be, that a Person Ordain'd by a Bishop, can be allow'd a legal Minister.</P>
<P>I might add, That if the Ordination of the Episcopal Church were valid, yet this Man's was not, because he appears Ordain'd by a Bishop <HI>sclus,</HI> without the Addition of <HI>Presbyters—</HI>which is the only thing in the Episcopal Ordination, that moves the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church to allow Episcopal Ordination, and not to Re-ordain such as come over from them. Since they allow the Bishops to Ordain, as Presbyters, tho' not as Bishops—But no Church allowing one single Presbyter to Ordain, this Ordination could not be valid.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, if there were not more in the Design, this Man would not lie in Prison; it is evident, the Doors are open to him, he may come out when he will—He has nothing to do, but to obey the Sentence. Not to Officiate any more in those Bounds—Nay, if his Ordination were not good, he may come out and get better Ordination, and see if that will admit him—The Design is visible; he is to lie there, to father the Clamour of Per∣secution upon the <HI>Scots,</HI> or to come out over the Bellies of the Magistrates, that he may push on the Insult upon the Constitution, till the People may be exasperated, and brought to a Tumult, and to suppress him by Rabble; both which would have been excellently well calcu∣lated, to have justified the like Rabbles long ago projected, and lately attempted upon the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
