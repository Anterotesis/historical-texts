<HEAD>THE
ADVENTURES
AND
PYRACIES, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S it is usual for great Persons
whose Lives have been remar∣kable,
and whose Actions de∣serve
Recording to Posterity,
to insist much upon their Ori∣ginals,
give full Accounts of
their Families, and the Histo∣ries
of their Ancestors: So, that
I may be methodical, I shall do the same, tho'
I can look but a very little Way into my Pe∣digree
as you will see presently.</P>
<P>If I may believe the Woman, whom I was
taught to call Mother, I was a little Boy, of
about two Years old, very well dress'd, had a
Nursery Maid to tend me, who took me out
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
on a fine Summer's Evening into the Fields to∣wards
<HI>Islington,</HI> as she pretended, to give the
Child some Air, a little Girl being with her of
Twelve or Fourteen Years old, that lived in the
Neighbourhood. The Maid, whether by Ap∣pointment
or otherwise, meets with a Fellow,
her Sweet-heart, as I suppose; he carries her
into a Publick-House, to give her a Pot and a
Cake; and while they were toying in the House,
the Girl plays about with me in her Hand in
the Garden, and at the Door, sometimes in Sight,
sometimes out of Sight, thinking no Harm.</P>
<P>At this Juncture comes by one of those Sort
of People, who, it seems, made it their Business
to Spirit away little Children. This was a Hel∣lish
Trade in those Days, and chiefly practised
where they found little Children very well drest,
or for bigger Children, to sell them to the
Plantations.</P>
<P>The Woman pretending to take me up in her
Arms and kiss me, and play with me, draws
the Girl a good Way from the House, till at
last she makes a fine Story to the Girl, and
bids her go back to the Maid, and tell her where
she was with the Child; that a Gentlewoman
had taken a Fancy to the Child, and was kissing
of it, but she should not be frighted, or to that
Purpose; for they were but just there; and so
while the Girl went, she carries me quite away.</P>
<P>From this time it seems I was disposed of to
a Beggar-Woman that wanted a pretty little
Child to set out her Case, and after that to
a Gypsey, under whose Government I continued
till I was about Six Years old; and this Woman,
tho' I was continually dragged about with her,
from one Part of the Country to another, yet
<PB N="3" REF="5"/>
never let me want for any thing, and I called
her Mother; tho' she told me at last, she was
not my Mother, but that she bought me for
Twelve Shillings of another Woman, who told
her how she came by me, and told her that my
Name was <HI>Bob S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngleton,</HI> not <HI>Robert,</HI> but plain <HI>Bob;</HI>
for it seems they never knew by what Name I
was Christen'd.</P>
<P>It is in vain to reflect here, what a terrible
Fright the careless Hussy was in, that lost me;
what Treatment she received from my justly
enraged Father and Mother, and the Horror
these must be in at the Thoughts of their Child
being thus carry'd away; for as I never knew
any thing of the Matter, but just what I have
related, nor who my Father and Mother were;
so it would make but a needless Digression to talk
of it here.</P>
<P>My good <HI>Gypsey Mother,</HI> for some of her wor∣thy
Actions <HI>no doubt,</HI> happened in Process of Time
to be hang'd; and as this fell out something too
soon for me to be perfected in the Strolling
Trade, the Parish where I was left, which for my
Life I can't remember, took some Care of me to
be sure; for the first thing I can remember of my
self afterwards, was, that I went to a Parish-School,
and the Minister of the Parish used to
talk to me to be a good Boy; and that tho' I was
but a poor Boy, if I minded my Book, and ser∣ved
God, I might make a good Man.</P>
<P>I believe I was frequently removed from one
Town to another, perhaps as the Parishes dispu∣ted
my supposed Mother's last Settlement. Whe∣ther
I was so shifted by Passes, or otherwise, I
know not; but the Town where I last was kept,
whatever its Name was, must be not far off from
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
the Sea Side; for a Master of a Ship who took
a Fancy to me, was the first that brought me
to a Place not far from <HI>Southampton,</HI> which I af∣terwards
knew to be <HI>Busselton,</HI> and there I tended
the Carpenters, and such People as were em∣ploy'd
in Building a Ship for him; and when it
was done, tho' I was not above Twelve Years
old, he carried me to Sea with him, on a Voyage
to <HI>Newfoundland.</HI></P>
<P>I lived well enough, and pleased my Master
so well, that he called me his own Boy; and I
would have called him Father, but he would not
allow it, for he had Children of his own. I went
three or four Voyages with him, and grew a great
sturdy Boy, when coming Home again from the
Banks of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> we were taken by an <HI>Al∣gerine</HI>
Rover, or Man of War; which, if my Ac∣count
stands right, was about the Year 1695,
for you may be sure I kept no Journal.</P>
<P>I was not much concerned at the Disaster, tho'
I saw my Master, after having been wounded by a
Splinter in the Head during the Engagement, ve∣ry
barbarously used by the <HI>Turks; I say,</HI> I was
not much concerned, till upon some unlucky
thing I said, which, as I remember, was about
abusing my Master, they took me and beat me
most unmercifully with a flat Stick on the Soles
of my Feet, so that I could neither go or stand
for several Days together.</P>
<P>But my good Fortune was my Friend upon
this Occasion; for as they were sailing away
with our Ship in Tow as a Prize, steering
for the Streights, and in Sight of the Bay of
<HI>Cadiz,</HI> the <HI>Turkish</HI> Rover was attack'd by two
great <HI>Portuguese</HI> Men of War, and taken and car∣ried
into <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
As I was not much concerned at my Captivity,
not indeed understanding the Consequences of it,
if it had continued; so I was not suitably sensible
of my Deliverance: Nor indeed was it so much
a Deliverance to me, as it would otherwise ha'
been; for my Master, who was the only Friend I
had in the World, died at <HI>Lisbon</HI> of his Wounds;
and I being then almost reduced to my primitive
State, <HI>viz.</HI> of Starving, had this Addition to it,
that it was in a foreign Country too, where I
knew no body, and could not speak a Word of
their Language. However, I fared better here
than I had Reason to expect; for when all the rest
of our Men had their Liberty to go where they
would, I that knew not whither to go, staid in
the Ship for several Days, till at length one of
the Lieutenants seeing me, enquired what that
young <HI>English</HI> Dog did there, and why they did
not turn him on Shore?</P>
<P>I heard him, and partly understood what he
meant, tho' not what he said, and began then to
be in a terrible Fright; for I knew not where to
get a Bit of Bread; when the Pilot of the Ship,
an old Seaman, seeing me look very dull, came to
me, and speaking broken <HI>English</HI> to me, told me,
I must be gone. Whither must I go (said I?)
Where you will, (said he), Home to your own
Country, if you will. How must I go thither
(said I?) Why have you no Friend (said he?)
No, (said I) not in the World, but that Dog,
pointing to the Ship's Dog, (who having stole
a Piece of Meat just before, had brought it close
by me, and I had taken it from him, and eat
it) for he has been a good Friend, and brought
me my Dinner.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="8"/>
<HI>Well, well,</HI> says he, <HI>you must have your Dinner;
Will you go with me? Yes,</HI> says I, <HI>with all my Heart.</HI>
In short, the old Pilot took me Home with him,
and used me tolerably well, tho' I fared hard
enough, and I lived with him about two Years,
during which time he was solliciting his Business,
and at length got to be Master or Pilot under
<HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Garcia de Pimentesia de Carravallas,</HI> Captain of
a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Gallion, or Carrack, which was bound
to <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> and immediately ha∣ving
gotten his Commission, put me on Board
to look after his Cabbin, in which he had sto∣red
himself with Abundance of Liquors, Suc∣cades,
Sugar, Spices, and other things for his
Accommodation in the Voyage, and laid in af∣terwards
a considerable Quantity of <HI>European</HI>
Goods, fine Lace, and Linnen; and also Bays,
Woollen, Cloath, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> under the Pretence
of his Clothes.</P>
<P>I was too young in the Trade to keep any
Journal of this Voyage, tho' my Master, who
was for a <HI>Portuguese</HI> a pretty good Artist, prompted
me to it: But my not understanding the Lan∣guage,
was one Hindrance; at least, it served
me for an Excuse. However, after some time
I began to look into his Charts and Books; and
as I could write a tolerable Hand, understood
some <HI>Latin,</HI> and began to have a Smattering of
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue; so I began to get a little
superficial Knowledge of Navigation, but not
such as was likely to be sufficient to carry me
thro' a Life of Adventure, as mine was to be.
<HI>In short,</HI> I learnt several material Things in this
Voyage among the <HI>Portuguese:</HI> I learnt particu∣larly
to be an errant Thief and a bad Sailor;
and I think I may say they are the best Ma∣sters
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
for Teaching both these, of any Nation in
the World.</P>
<P>We made our Way for the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> by the
Coast of <HI>Brasil;</HI> not that it is in the Course of
Sailing the Way thither; but our Captain, ei∣ther
on his own Account, or by the Direction of the
Merchants, went thither first, where at <HI>All Saints
Bay,</HI> or as they call it in <HI>Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Rio de Todos
los Santos,</HI> we delivered near an Hundred Ton of
Goods, and took in a considerable Quantity of
Gold, with some Chests of Sugar, and Seventy
or Eighty great Rolls of Tobacco, every Roll
weighing at least 100 Weight.</P>
<P>Here being lodged on Shore by my Master's
Order, I had the Charge of the Captain's Busi∣ness,
he having seen me very diligent for my
own Master; and in Requital for his mistaken
Confidence, I found Means to secure, that is to
say, to steal about twenty Moydores out of the
Gold that was Shipt on Board by the Merchants,
and this was my first Adventure.</P>
<P>We had a tolerable Voyage from hence to
the Cape <HI>de bona Speranza;</HI> and I was reputed
as a mighty diligent Servant to my Master,
and very faithful (I was diligent indeed,
but I was very far from honest; however,
they thought me honest, which by the Way,
was their very great Mistake) upon this very
Mistake, the Captain took a particular Li∣king
to me, and employ'd me frequently on
his own Occasions; and on the other Hand, in
Recompence for my Officious Diligence, I re∣ceived
several particular Favours from him;
particularly, I was by the Captain's Command,
made a kind of a Steward under the Ship's
Steward, for such Provisions as the Captain de∣manded
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
for his own Table. He had another
Steward for his private Stores besides, but my
Office concerned only what the Captain called
for of the Ship's Stores, for his private
Use.</P>
<P>However, by this Means I had Opportunity
particularly to take Care of my Master's Man,
and to furnish my self with sufficient Provisions
to make me live much better than the other
People in the Ship; for the Captain seldom or∣dered
any thing out of the Ship's Stores, as
above, but I snipt some of it for my own Share.
We arrived at <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> in about se∣ven
Months, from <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and remained there
eight more; during which Time I had indeed
nothing to do, my Master being generally on
Shore, but to learn every thing that is wicked
among the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> a Nation the most persi∣dious
and the most debauch'd, the most insolent
and cruel, of any that pretend to call them∣selves
Christians, in the World.</P>
<P>Thieving, Lying, Swearing, Forswearing,
joined to the most abominable Lewdness, was
the stated Practice of the Ship's Crew; <HI>adding
to it,</HI> that with the most unsufferable Boasts of
their new Courage, they were generally speaking
the most compleat Cowards that I ever met with;
and the Consequence of their Cowardice was
evident upon many Cccasions. However, there
was here and there one among them that
was not so bad as the rest; and as my Lot fell
among them, it made me have the most con∣temptible
Thoughts of the rest, as indeed they
deserved.</P>
<P>I was exactly fitted for their Society indeed;
for I had no Sense of Virtue or Religion upon
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
me. I had never heard much of either, except
what a good old Parson had said to me when I
was a Child of about Eight or Nine Years old;
nay, I was preparing, and growing up apace,
to be as wicked as any Body could be, or per∣haps
ever was. Fate certainly thus directed my
Beginning, knowing that I had Work which I
had to do in the World, which nothing but one
hardened against all Sense of Honesty or Reli∣gion,
could go thro'; and yet even in this State
of Original Wickedness, I entertained such a
settled Abhorrence of the abandon'd Vileness of
the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> that I could not but hate them
most heartily from the Beginning, and all my Life
afterwards. They were so brutishly wicked, so
base and persidious, not only to Strangers, but
to one another; so meanly submissive when sub∣jected;
so insolent, or barbarous and tyrannical
when superiour, that I thought there was some∣thing
in them that shock'd my very Nature.
Add to this, that 'tis natural to an <HI>Englishman</HI>
to hate a Coward, it all joined together to make
the Devil and a <HI>Portuguese</HI> equally my Aversion.</P>
<P>However, according to the <HI>English</HI> Proverb,
<HI>He that is Shipp'd with the Devil must sail with the
Devil;</HI> I was among them, and I manag'd my
self as well as I could. My Master had con∣sented
that I should assist the Captain in the
Office as above; but as I understood afterwards,
that the Captain allowed my Master Half a
Moydore a Month for my Service, and that
he had my Name upon the Ship's Books also,
I expected that when the Ship came to be paid
four Months Wages at the <HI>Indies,</HI> as they it seems
always do, my Master would let me have some∣ting
for my self.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="12"/>
But I was wrong in my Man, for he was
none of that Kind: He had taken me up as in
Distress, and his Business was to keep me so,
and make his Market of me as well as he could;
which I began to think of after a different
Manner than I did at first; for at first I thought
he had entertained me in meer Charity, upon
seeing my distrest Circumstances, but did not
doubt, but when he put me on Board the Ship,
I should have some Wages for my Service.</P>
<P>But he thought, it seems, quite otherwise; and
when I procured one to speak to him about it
when the Ship was paid at <HI>Goa,</HI> he flew into the
greatest Rage imaginable, and called me <HI>English</HI>
Dog, young Heretick, and threaten'd to put
me into the Inquisition. Indeed of all the Names
the Four and Twenty Letters could make up,
he should not have called me Heretick; for as
I knew nothing about Religion, neither <HI>Protestant</HI>
from <HI>Papist,</HI> or either of them from a <HI>Mahome∣tan,</HI>
I could never be a Heretick. However, it
pass'd but a little, but as young as I was, I had
been carried into the Inquisition; and there, if
they had ask'd me, if I was a <HI>Protestant</HI> or a <HI>Catho∣lick,</HI>
I should have said Yes to that which came
first. If it had been the <HI>Protestant</HI> they had ask'd
first, it had certainly made a Martyr of me for
I did not know what.</P>
<P>But the very Priest they carried with them, or
Chaplain of the Ship, as we call him, saved me;
for seeing me a Boy entirely ignorant of Religion,
and ready to do or say any thing they bid me,
he ask'd me some Questions about it, which he
found I answered so very simply, that he took it
upon him to tell them, he would answer for my
being a good Catholick; and he hoped he should
<PB N="11" REF="13"/>
be the Means of saving my Soul; and he pleased
himself, that it was to be a Work of Merit to
him; so he made me as good a <HI>Papist</HI> as any of
them in about a Week's Time.</P>
<P>I then told him my Case about my Master
how, it is true, he had taken me up in a mise∣rable
Case, on Board a Man of War at <HI>Lisbon;</HI>
and I was indebted to him for bringing me on
Board this Ship; that if I had been left at
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> I might have starv'd, and the like: And
therefore I was willing to serve him; but that I
hop'd he would give me some little Considera∣tion
for my Service, or let me know how long
he expected I should serve him for nothing.</P>
<P>It was all one; neither the Priest or any one
else could prevail with him, but that I was not
his Servant but his Slave; that he took me in
the <HI>Algerine;</HI> and that I was a <HI>Turk,</HI> only preten∣ded
to be an <HI>English</HI> Boy, to get my Liberty, and
he would carry me to the Inquisition as a <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>This frighted me out of my Wits; for I had no
body to vouch for me what I was, or from whence
I came; but the good <HI>Padre Antonio,</HI> for that was
his Name, cleared me of that Part by a Way I
did not understand: For he came to me one
Morning with two Sailors, and told me they
must search me, to bear Witness that I was not
a <HI>Turk.</HI> I was amazed at them, and frighted; and
did not understand them; nor could I imagine
what they intended to do to me. However,
stripping me, they were soon satisfy'd; and Fa∣ther
<HI>Anthony</HI> bad me be easy, for they could all
Witness that I was no <HI>Turk.</HI> So I escaped that
Part of my Master's Cruelty.</P>
<P>And now I resolved from that time to run
away from him if I could; but there was no
<PB N="12" REF="14"/>
doing of it there; for there were not Ships of
any Nation in the World in that Port, except
two or three <HI>Persian</HI> Vessels from <HI>Ormus;</HI> so that
if I had offer'd to go away from him, he would
have had me seized on Shore, and brought on
Board by Force. So that I had no Remedy but
Patience, and this he brought to an End too
as soon as he could; for after this he began to
use me ill, and not only to straiten my Provisi∣ons,
but to beat and torture me in a barbarous
Manner for every Trifle; so that in a Word my
Life began to be very miserable.</P>
<P>The Violence of this Usage of me, and the
Impossibility of my Escape from his Hands, set
my Head a-working upon all Sorts of Mischief;
and in particular, I resolved, after studying all
other Ways to deliver my self, and finding all
ineffectual; I say, I resolved to murther him.
With this Hellish Resolution in my Head, I spent
whole Nights and Days contriving how to put it
in Execution, the Devil prompting me very
warmly to the Fact. I was indeed entirely at a
Loss for the Means; for I had neither Gun or
Sword, nor any Weapon to assault him with.
Poison I had my Thoughts much upon, but knew
not where to get any; or if I might have got
it, I did not know the Country Word for it, or
by what Name to ask for it.</P>
<P>In this Manner I quitted the Fact intentio∣nally
a Hundred and a Hundred Times; but
Providence, either for his sake, or for mine, al∣ways
frustrated my Designs, and I could never
bring it to pass; so I was obliged to continue
in his Chains till the Ship, having taken in her
Loading, set Sail for <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="15"/>
I can say nothing here to the Manner of our
Voyage; for as I said, I kept no Journal; but
this I can give an Account of, that having been
once as high as the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> as we call
it; or <HI>Cabo de bona Speranza,</HI> as they call it, we
were driven back again by a violent Storm from
the W. S. W. which held us six Days and
Nights, a great Way to the Eastward; and after
that standing afore the Wind for several Days
more, we at last came to an Anchor on the
Coast of <HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>The Storm had been so violent, that the Ship
had received a great deal of Damage, and it
required some time to repair her; so standing
in nearer the Shore, the Pilot, <HI>My Master,</HI>
brought the Ship into a very good Harbour,
where we rid in Twenty six Fathom Water,
about Half a Mile from the Shore.</P>
<P>While the Ship rode here, there happen'd a
most desperate Mutiny among the Men, upon
Account of some Deficiency in their Allowance,
which came to that Height, that they threaten'd
the Captain to set him on Shore, and go back
with the Ship to <HI>Goa.</HI> I wish'd they would, with
all my Heart, for I was full of Mischief in my
Head, and ready enough to do any. So, tho'
I was but a Boy, as they called me, yet I prom∣pted
the Mischief all I could, and embarked in
it so openly, that I escap'd very little being
hang'd in the first and most early Part of my
Life; for the Captain had some Notice, that
there was a Design laid by some of the Com∣pany
to murther him; and having partly by
Money and Promises, and partly by Threatning
and Torture, brought two Fellows to confess the
Particulars, and the Names of the Persons con∣cerned,
<PB N="14" REF="16"/>
they were presently apprehended, till one
accusing another, no less than sixteen Men were
seized, and put into Irons, whereof I was one.</P>
<P>The Captain, who was made desperate by his
Danger, resolving to clear the Ship of his Ene∣mies,
try'd us all, and we were all condemned
to die. The Manner of his Process I was too
young to take Notice of; but the Purser and
one of the Gunners were hang'd immediately,
and I expected it with the rest. I do not remem∣ber
any great Concern I was under about it, on∣ly
that I cry'd very much; for I knew little
then of this World, and nothing at all of the
next.</P>
<P>However, the Captain contented himself with
executing these two; and some of the rest, up∣on
their hmble Submission, and Promise of fu∣ture
good Behaviour, were pardoned; but five
were ordered to be set on Shore on the Island,
and left there, of which I was one. My Master
used all his Interest with the Captain to have
me excused, but could not obtain it; for some∣body
having told him that I was one of them,
who was singled out to have killed him, when
my Master desired I might not be set on Shore,
the Captain told him, I should stay on Board
if he desired it, but then I should be hang'd;
so he might chuse for me which he thought
best: The Captain, it seems, was particular∣ly
provok'd at my being concerned in the Trea∣chery,
because of his having been so kind to me,
and of his having singled me me out to serve him,
as I have said above; and this perhaps obliged
him to give my Master such a rough Choice,
either to set me on Shore, or to have me hang'd
on Board: And had my Master indeed known
<PB N="15" REF="17"/>
what good Will I had for him, he would not
ha' been long in chusing for me; for I had cer∣tainly
determined to do him a Mischief the
first Opportunity I had had for it. This was
therefore a good Providence for me, to keep
me from dipping my Hands in Blood, and it
made me more tender afterwards in Matters of
Blood, than I believe I should otherwise have
been. But as to my being one of them that was
to kill the Captain, that I was wrong'd in, for I
was not the Person; but it was really one of them
that were pardoned, he having the good Luck
not to have that Part discovered.</P>
<P>I was now to enter upon a Part of indepen∣dent
Life, a thing I was indeed very ill prepared
to manage; for I was perfectly loose and dissolute
in my Behaviour, bold and wicked while I was
under Government, and now perfectly unfit to be
trusted with Liberty; for I was as ripe for any
Villainy, as a young Fellow that had no solid
Thought ever placed in his Mind could be suppo∣sed
to be. Education, as you have heard, I had
none; and all the little Scenes of Life I had
pass'd thro', had been full of Dangers and de∣sperate
Circumstances; but I was either so
young, or so stupid, that I escaped the Grief and
Anxiety of them, for want of having a Sense of
their Tendency and Consequences.</P>
<P>This thoughtless, unconcern'd Temper had
one Felicity indeed in it; that it made me daring
and ready for doing any Mischief, and kept off
the Sorrow which otherwise ought to have atten∣ded
me when I fell into any Mischief; that this
Stupidity was instead of a Happiness to me, for
it left my Thoughts free to act upon Means of
Escape and Deliverance in my Distress, how∣ever
<PB N="16" REF="18"/>
great it might be; whereas my Compani∣ons
in the Misery, were so sunk by their Fear
and Grief, that they abandoned themselves to
the Misery of their Condition, and gave over all
Thought but of their perishing and starving,
being devoured by wild Beasts, murthered, and
perhaps eaten by <HI>Cannibals, and the like.</HI></P>
<P>I was but a young Fellow about 17 or 18;
but hearing what was to be my Fate, I received it
with no Appearance of Discouragement; but I
asked what my Master said to it, and being told
that he had used his utmost Interest to save me,
but the Captain had answered I should either
go on Shore or be hanged on Board, which he
pleased; I then gave over all Hope of being re∣ceived
again: I was not very thankful in my
Thoughts to my Master for his solliciting the
Captain for me, because I knew that what he did
was not in Kindness to me, so much as in Kind∣ness
to himself; I mean to preserve the Wages
which he got for me, which amounted to above
six Dollars a Month, including what the Cap∣tain
allowed him for my particular Service
to him.</P>
<P>When I understood that my Master was so
apparently kind, I asked if I might not be ad∣mitted
to speak with him, and they told
me I might, if my Master would come down to
me, but I could not be allowed to come up to
him; so then I desired my Master might be
spoke to to come to me, and he accordingly
came to me; I fell on my Knees to him, and
begg'd he would forgive me what I had done to
displease him; and indeed the Resolution I had
taken to murther him, lay with some Horrour
upon my Mind just at that Time, so that I was
<PB N="17" REF="19"/>
once just a-going to confess it, and beg him to
forgive me, but I kept it in: He told me he had
done all he could to obtain my Pardon of the
Captain, but could not; and he knew no Way
for me but to have Patience, and submit to my
Fate; and if they came to speak with any Ship
of their Nation at the Cape, he would endea∣vour
to have them stand in, and fetch us off
again if we might be found.</P>
<P>Then I begg'd I might have my Clothes on
Shore with me. He told me he was afraid I
should have little Need of Clothes, for he did
not see how we could long subsist on the Island,
and that he had been told that the Inhabitants
were <HI>Cannibals</HI> or <HI>Men-eaters</HI> (tho' he had no Rea∣son
for that Suggestion) and we should not be
able to live among them. I told him I was not
so afraid of that, as I was of starving for want
of Victuals; and as for the Inhabitants being
<HI>Cannibals,</HI> I believed we should be more likely
to eat them, than they us, if we could but get
at them: But I was mightily concerned, I said,
we should have no Weapons with us to defend
our selves, and I begg'd nothing now, but that he
would give me a Gun and a Sword, with a little
Powder and Shot.</P>
<P>He smiled and said, they would signify no∣thing
to us, for it was impossible for us to pretend
to preserate our Lives among such a populous
and desperate Nation as the People of the Island
were. I told him, that however it would do
us this Good, for we should not be devoured or
destroy'd immediately;so I begged hard for the
Gun. At last he told me, he did not know whe∣ther
the Captain would give him Leave to give
me a Gun, and if not, he durst not do it; but
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
he promised to use his Interest to obtain it forme,
which he did, and the next Day he sent me a Gun,
with some Ammunition, but told me, the Cap∣tain
would not suffer the Ammunition to be given
us, till we were set all on Shore, and till he was just
going to set Sail. He also sent me the few
Clothes I had in the Ship, which indeed were
not many.</P>
<P>Two Days after this we were all carried on
Shore together; the rest of my Fellow-Criminals
hearing I had a Gun, and some Powder and Shot,
sollicited for Liberty to carry the like with them,
which was also granted them; and thus we were
set on Shore to shift for our selves.</P>
<P>At our first coming into the Island, we were
terrified exceedingly with the Sight of the bar∣barous
People; whose Figure was made more
terrible to us than really it was, by the Report
we had of them from the Seamen; but when we
came to converse with them a while, we found
they were not <HI>Cannibals,</HI> as was reported, or
such as would fall immediately upon us and eat
us up; but they came and sat down by us, and
wondered much at our Clothes and Arms, and
made Signs to give us some Victuals, such as
they had, which was only Roots and Plants dug
out of the Ground, for the present, but they
brought us Fowls and Flesh afterwards in good
Plenty.</P>
<P>This encouraged the other four Men that
were with me very much, for they were quite
dejected before; but now they began to be very fa∣miliar
with them, and made Signs, that if they
would use us kindly, we would stay and live
with them; which they seemed glad of, tho'
they knew little of the Necessity we were under
<PB N="19" REF="21"/>
to do so, or how much we were afraid of
them.</P>
<P>However, upon other Thoughts, we resolved
that we would only stay in that Part so long
as the Ship rid in the Bay, and then making
them believe we were gone with the Ship, we
would go and place our selves, if possible, where
there were no Inhabitants to be seen, and so
live as we could, or perhaps watch for a Ship
that might be driven upon the Coast, as we were.</P>
<P>The Ship continued a Fortnight in the Road
repairing some Damage which had been done
her in the late Storm, and taking in Wood and
Water; and during this time the Boat comning
often on Shore, the Men brought us several
Refreshments, and the Natives believing we only
belong'd to the Ship, were civil enough. We
lived in a kind of a Tent on the Shore, or rather
a Hut, which we made with the Boughs of
Trees, and sometimes in the Night retired
to a Wood a little out of their Way, to let them
think we were gone on board the Ship. How∣ever,
we found them barbarous, treacherous,
and villainous enough in their Nature, only civil
for Fear, and therefore concluded we should soon
fall into their Hands when the Ship was gone.</P>
<P>The Sense of this wrought upon my Fellow-Sufferers
even to Distraction; and one of them,
being a Carpenter, in his mad Fit, swan off
to the Ship in the Night, tho' she lay then a
League to Sea, and made such pitiful Moan to
be taken in, that the Captain was prevailed
with at last to take him in, tho' they let him
lye swimming three Hours in the Water before
he consented to it.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
Upon this, and his humble Submission, the Cap∣tain
received him, and, in a word, the Importu∣nity
of this Man (who for some time petition'd
to be taken in, tho' they hanged him as soon as
they had him) was such as could not be resisted;
for, after he had swam so long about the Ship,
he was not able to have reached the Shore again;
and the Captain saw evidently that the Man
must be taken on Board, or suffered to drown,
and the whole Ship's Company offering to be
bound for him for his good Behaviour, the Cap∣tain
at last yielded, and he was taken up, but
almost dead with his being so long in the
Water.</P>
<P>When this Man was got in, he never left Im∣portuning
the Captain and all the rest of the
Officers in Behalf of us that were behind,
but to the very last Day the Captain was in∣exorable;
when, at the time their Preparations
were making to sail, and Orders given to hoist
the Boats into the Ship, all the Seamen in a Body
came up to the Rail of the Quarter-Deck, where
the Captain was walking with some of his Of∣ficers,
and appointing the Boatswain to speak
for them, he went up, and falling on his Knees
to the Captain, begged of him in the humblest
manner possible, to receive the four Men on
Board again, offering to answer for their Fide∣lity,
or to have them kept in Chains till they
came to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and there to be delivered up
to Justice, rather than, as they said, to have
them left to be murthered by Savages, or de∣voured
by wild Beasts. It was a great while e'er
the Captain took any Notice of them, but when he
did he ordered the Boatswain to be seized, and
<PB N="21" REF="23"/>
threatned to bring him to the Capstern for
speaking for them.</P>
<P>Upon this Severity, one of the Seamen, bolder
than the rest, but still with all possible Respect
to the Captain, besought his Honour, as he cal∣led
him, that he would give Leave to some more
of them to go on Shore, and die with their
Companions, or, if possible, to assist them to
resist the Barbarians. The Captain, rather pro∣voked
than cowd with this, came to the Barricado
of the Quarter-Deck, and speaking very prudent∣ly
to the Men, (for, had he spoken roughly,
two Thirds of them would have left the Ship,
if not all of them) he told them, it was for their
Safety as well as his own, that he had been obli∣ged
to that Severity; that Mutiny on board a
Ship was the same thing as Treason in the King's
Palace, and he could not answer it to his Owners
and Employers to trust the Ship and Goods Com∣mitted
to his Charge, with Men who had enter∣tained
Thoughts of the worst and blackest Na∣ture;
that he wished heartily that it had been
any where else that they had been set on Shore,
where they might have been in less Hazard
from the Savages; that if he had designed they
should be destroyed, he-could as well have exe∣cuted
them on board as the other two; that he
wished it had been in some other Part of the
World, where he might have delivered them
up to the Civil Justice, or might have left them
among Christians; but that it was better their
Lives were put in Hazard, than his Life, and the
Safety of the Ship; and that tho' he did not
know that he had deserved so ill of any of them,
as that they should leave the Ship, rather than
do their Duty; yet if any of them were resolved
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
to do so unless he would consent to take a Gang of
Traytors on board, who, as he had proved be∣fore
them all, had conspired to murther him,
he would not hinder them, nor, for the present,
would he resent their Importunity; but if there
was no body left in the Ship but himfelf, he
would never consent to take them on board.</P>
<P>This Discourse was delivered so well, was in
it self so reasonable, was managed with so much
Temper, yet so boldly concluded with a Nega∣tive,
that the greatest Part of the Men were sa∣tisfied
for the present: However, as it put the
Men into Juncto's and Cabals, and they were not
composed for some Hours; the Wind also slacken∣ing
towards Night, the Captain ordered not to
weigh till next Morning.</P>
<P>The same Night 23 of the Men, among whom
was the Gunner's Mate, the Surgeon's Assistant,
and two Carpenters, applying to the Chief Mate,
told him, that as the Captain had given them
Leave to go on Shore to their Comerades, they
begged, that he would speak to the Captain not
to take it ill that they were desirous to go and
die with their Companions; and that they
thought they could do no less in such an Ex∣tremity,
than go to them; because if there was
any way to save their Lives, it was by adding
to their Numbers, and making them strong
enough to assist one another in defending them∣selves
against the Savages, till perhaps they might
one time or other find Means to make their
Escape, and get to their own Country again.</P>
<P>The Mate told them in so many Words, that
he durst not speak to the Captain upon any such
Design, and was very sorry they had no more
Respect for him, than to desire him to go of
<PB N="23" REF="25"/>
such an Errand; but if they were resolved up∣on
such an Enterprize, he would advise them to
take the Long-Boat in the Morning betimes, and
go off, seeing the Captain had given them Leave,
and leave a civil Letter behind them to the
Captain, and to desire him to send his Men on
Shore for the Boat, which should be delivered
very honestly, and he promised to keep their
Counsel so long.</P>
<P>Accordingly an Hour before Day, those 23
Men, with every Man a Fire-lock and Cutlass,
with some Pistols, three Halbards or Half-Pikes,
and good Store of Powder and Ball, without any
Provision but about Half and Hundred of Bread,
but with all their Chests and Clothes, Tools,
Instruments, Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> embarked themselves so
silently, that the Captain got no Notice of it till
they were gotten half the Way on Shore.</P>
<P>As soon as the Captain heard of it, he called
for the Gunner's Mate, <HI>the Chief Gunner being at that
time sick in his Cabbin,</HI> and ordered to fire at them;
but, to his great Mortification, the Gunner's
Mate was one of the Number, and was gone with
them; and indeed it was by his Means they
got so many Arms, and so much Ammunition.
When the Captain found how it was, and that
there was no Help for it, he began to be a little
appeased, made light of it, and called up the
Men, spoke kindly to them, and told them he
was very well satisfied in the Fidelity and Abi∣lity
of those that were now left; and that he
would give to them, for their Encouragement,
to be divided among them, the Wages which was
due to the Men that were gone; and that it was a
great Satisfaction to him that the Ship was freed
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
from such a mutinous Rabble, who had not the
least Reason for their Discontent.</P>
<P>The Men seemed very well satisfied, and par∣ticularly
the Promise of the Wages of those that
were gone, went a great way with them. After
this the Letter which was left by the Men was
given to the Captain, by his Boy, with whom,
it seems, the Men had left it. The Letter was
much to the same Purpose of what they had said
to the Mate, and which he declined to say
for them; only that at the End of their Letter
they told the Captain, that as they had no dis∣honest
Design, so they had taken nothing away
with them which was not their own, except
some Arms and Ammunition, such as were ab∣solutely
necessary to them, as well for their De∣fence
against the Savages, as to kill Fowls or
Beasts for their Food, that they might not pe∣rish;
and as there were considerable Sums due
to them for Wages, they hoped he would al∣low
the Arms and Ammunition upon their Ac∣counts.
They told him, that as to the Ship's
Long-Boat which they had taken to bring them
on Shore, they knew it was necessary to him,
and they were very willing to restore it to him;
and if he pleased to send for it, it should be very
honestly delivered to his Men, and not the least
Injury offered to any of those who came for it,
nor the least Perswasion or Invitation made use
of to any of them to stay with them; and at
the Bottom of the Letter they very humbly be∣sought
him, that for their Defence, and for the
Safety of their Lives he would be pleased to send
them a Barrel of Powder, and some Ammuni∣tion,
and give them Leave to keep the Mast
<PB N="25" REF="27"/>
and Sail of the Boat, that if it was possible for
them to make themselves a Boat of any kind,
they might shift off to Sea to save themselves in
such Part of the World as their Fate should di∣rect
them to.</P>
<P>Upon this the Captain, who had won much
upon the rest of his Men by what he had said
to them, and was very easy as to the General
Peace; (for it was very true, that the most mu∣tinous
of the Men were gone) came out to the
Quarter-Deck, and calling the Men together,
let them know the Substance of the Letter; and
told the Men, that however they had not de∣served
such Civility from him, yet he was not
willing to expose them more than they were wil∣ling
to expose themselves, he was inclined to
send them some Ammunition; and as they had
desired but one Barrel of Powder, he would send
them two Barrels, and Shot, or Lead, and
Moulds to make Shot in proportion: and, to
let them see that he was civiller to them than
they deserved, he ordered a Cask of Arrack,
and a great Bag of Bread to be sent them for
Subsistence, till they should be able to furnish
themselves.</P>
<P>The rest of the Men applauded the Captain's
Generosity, and every one of them sent us
some thing or other; and about three in the Af∣ternoon
the Pinnace came on Shore, and brought
us all these things, which we were very glad
of, and returned the Long-Boat accordingly;
and as to the Men that came with the Pinnace,
as the Captain had singled out such Men as he
knew would not come over to us, so they had
positive Orders not to bring any one of us on
board again, upon Pain of Death; and indeed
<PB N="26" REF="28"/>
both were so true to our Points, that we neither
asked them to stay, nor they us to go.</P>
<P>We were now a good Troop, being in all 27
Men, very well armed and provided with every
thing but Victuals; we had two Carpenters
among us, a Gunner, and, which was worth all
the rest, a Surgeon or Doctor, that is to say, he
was an Assistant to a Surgeon at <HI>Goa,</HI> and was
entertained as Supernumerary with us: The
Carperters had brought all their Tools, the
Doctor all his Instruments and Medicines, and
indeed we had a great deal of Baggage, that is
to say, in the whole, for <HI>some of us</HI> had little
more than the Clothes on our Backs, of whom
I was one; but I had one thing which none of
them had <HI>viz.</HI> I had the 22 Moydores of Gold,
which I stole at the <HI>Brasils,</HI> and two Pieces of
Eight. The two Peices of Eight I shewed, and
one Moydore, but no more; and none of them ever
suspected that I had any more Money in the World,
having been known to be only a poor Boy taken up
in Charity, as you have heard, and used like a
Slave, and in the worst Manner of a Slave, by
my cruel Master the Pilot.</P>
<P>It will be easy to imagine we four, that were
left at first, were joyful, nay, even surprized
with Joy, at the coming of the rest, tho' at first
we were frighted, and thought they came to fetch
us back to hang us; but they took ways quick∣ly
to satisfy us that they were in the same Con∣dition
with us, only with this additional Cir∣cumstance,
that theirs was voluntarily, and ours
by Force.</P>
<P>The first Piece of News they told us after the
short History of their coming away, was, that
our Companion was on board, but how he got
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
thither we could not imagine; for he had given us
the Slip, and we never imagined he could swim
so well as to venture off to the Ship, which lay
at so great a Distance; nay, we did not so much
as know that he could swim at all, and not
thinking any thing of what really happen'd, we
thought that he must have wandered into the
Woods, and was devoured, or was fallen into the
Hands of the Natives and was murthered; and
these Thoughts filled us with Fears enough, and
of several kinds, about its being some time or
other our Lot to fall into their Hands also.</P>
<P>But hearing how he had with much Difficulty
been received on board the Ship again, and par∣don'd,
we were much better satisfied than
before.</P>
<P>Being now, as I have said, a considerable Num∣ber
of us, and in Condition to defend our selves,
the first thing we did was to give every one his
Hand, that we would not separate from one
another upon any Occasion whatsoever, but that
we would live and die together; that we would
kill no Food, but that we would distribute it in
publick; and that we would be in all things
guided by the Majority, and not insist upon
our own Resolutions in any thing, if the Majority
were against it; that we would appoint a Cap∣tain
among us to be our Governour or Leader
during Pleasure; that while he was in Office, we
would obey him without Reserve, on Pain of
Death; and that every one should take Turn,
but the Captain was not to act in any particular
thing without Advice of the rest, and by the
Majority.</P>
<P>Having established these Rules, we resolved to
enter into some Measures for our Food, and for
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
conversing with the Inhabitants or Natives of
the Island, for our Supply; as for Food, they
were at first very useful to us, but we soon grew
weary of them, being an ignorant, ravenous,
brutish sort of People, even worse than the Na∣tives
of any other Country that we had seen;
and we soon found that the principal Part of our
Subsistance was to be had by our Guns, shoot∣ing
of Deer and other Creatures, and Fowls of
all other Sorts, of which there is Abundance.</P>
<P>We found the Natives did not disturb or con∣cern
themselves much about us; nor did they
enquire, or perhaps know whether we stay'd
among them or not, much less that our Ship
was gone quite away, and had cast us off, as
was our Case; for the next Morning after we
had sent back the Long-Boat, the Ship stood
away to the South-East, and in four Hours time
was out of our Sight.</P>
<P>The next Day two of us went out into the
Country one Way, and two another, to see what
kind of a Land we were in; and we soon found
the Country was very pleasant and fruitful, and
a convenient Place enough to live in; but as be∣fore,
inhabited by a Parcel of Creatures scarce
human, or capable of being made sociable on any
Account whatsoever.</P>
<P>We found the Place full of Cattle and Pro∣visions;
but whether we might venture to take
them where we could find them, or not, we
did not know; and tho' we were under a Necessi∣ty
to get Provisions, yet we were loath to bring
down a whole Nation of Devils upon us at once,
and therefore some of our Company agreed to
try to speak with some of the Country, if we
could, that we might see what Course was to be
<PB N="29" REF="31"/>
taken with them. Eleven of our Men went of
this Errand, well armed, and furnished for De∣fence.
They brought Word, that they had
seen some of the Natives, who appeared very
civil to them, but very shy and afraid, seeing
their Guns; for it was easy to perceive, that
the Natives knew what their Guns were, and
what Use they were of.</P>
<P>They made Signs to the Natives for some Food,
and they went and fetched several Herbs and
Roots, and some Milk; but it was evident
they did not design to give it away, but to sell,
making Signs to know what our Men would
give them.</P>
<P>Our Men were perplexed at this, for they
had nothing to Barter; however, one of the
Men pulled out a Knife and shewed them, and
they were so fond of it, that they were ready
to go together by the Ears for the Knife: The
Seaman seeing that, was willing to make a good
Market of his Knife, and keeping them chaffer∣ing
about it a good while, some offered him
Roots, and others Milk; at last one offered him
a Goat for it, which he took. Then another
of our Men shewed them another Knife, but
they had nothing good enough for that; where∣upon
one of them made Signs that he would
go and fetch something; so our Men stay'd three
Hours for their Return, when they came back
and brought him a small sized, thick, short
Cow, very fat, and good Meat, and gave him
for his Knife.</P>
<P>This was a good Market, but our Misfortune
was we had no Merchandize; for our Knives
were as needful to us as to them, and but that
we were in Distress for Food, and must of Ne∣cessity
<PB N="30" REF="32"/>
have some, these Men would not have
parted with their Knives.</P>
<P>However, in a little time more we found that
the Woods were full of living Creatures which
we might kill for our Food, and that without
giving Offence to them; so that our Men went
daily out a Hunting, and never failed to kill
something or other; for as to the Natives, we
had no Goods to Barter; and for Money, all
the Stock among us would not have fubsisted
us long; however, we called a general Council
to see what Money we had, and to bring it
all together, that it might go as far as possible;
and when it came to my Turn, I pulled out
a Moydore and the two Dollars I spoke of
before.</P>
<P>This Moydore I ventured to shew, that they
might not despise me too much for adding too
little to the Store, and that they might not
pretend to search me; and they were very ci∣vil
to me upon the Presumption that I had been
so faithful to them as not to conceal any thing
from them.</P>
<P>But our Money did us little Service, for the
People neither knew the Value or the Use of
it, nor could they justly rate the Gold in Pro∣portion
with the Silver; so that all our Money,
which was not much when it was all put to∣gether,
would go but a little way with us, that
is to say, to buy us Provisions.</P>
<P>Our next Consideration was to get away from
this cursed Place, and whether to go; when my
Opinion came to be asked, I told them I would
leave that all to them, and I told them I had
rather they would let me go into the Woods
to get them some Provisions, than consult with
<PB N="31" REF="33"/>
me, for I would agree to whatever they did;
but they would not agree to that, for they
would not consent that any of us should go into
the Woods alone; for tho' we had yet seen no
Lions or Tygers in the Woods, we were assured
there were many in the Island, besides other
Creatures as dangerous, and, perhaps worse,
as we afterwards found by our own Experience.</P>
<P>We had many Adventures in the Woods for
our Provisions, and often met with wild and
terrible Beasts, which we could not call by their
Names, but as they were like us seeking their
Prey, but were themselves good for nothing,
so we disturbed them as little as possible.</P>
<P>Our Consultations concerning our Escape from
this Place, which as I have said, we were now
upon, ended in this only, that as we had two
Carpenters among us, and that they had Tools
almost of all Sorts with them, we should try
to build us a Boat to go off to Sea with, and that
then perhaps we might find our way back to
<HI>Goa,</HI> or land on some more proper Place to make
our Escape. The Counsels of this Assembly
were not of great Moment, yet as they seem
to be introductory of many more remarkable
Adventures which happened under my Con∣duct
hereabouts many Years after, I think this
Miniature of my future Enterprizes may not be
unpleasant to relate.</P>
<P>To the Building of a Boat I made no Ob∣jection,
and away they went to work imme∣diately;
but as they went on, great Difficulties
occurred, such as want of Saws to cut out Plank;
Nails, Bolts, and Spikes, to fasten the Timbers,
Hemp, Pitch and Tar, to Caulk and Pay her
Seams, <HI>and the like:</HI> At length one of the Com∣pany
<PB N="32" REF="34"/>
proposed, that instead of building a Bark
or Sloop, or Shalloup, or whatever they would
call it, which they found was so difficult, they
should rather make a large <HI>Periagua,</HI> or Canoe,
which might be done with great Ease.</P>
<P>It was presently objected, that we could never
make a Canoe large enough to pass the great
Ocean, which we were to go over, to get to
the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> that it not only would
not bear the Sea, but it would never bear the
Burthen; for we were not only Twenty seven
Men of us, but had a great deal of Luggage
with us, and must, for our Provision, take in a
great deal more.</P>
<P>I never proposed to speak in their General
Consultations before; but finding they were at
some Loss about what kind of Vessel they should
make, and how to make it; and what would be
fit for our Use, and what not; I told them I
found they were at a full Stop in their Counsels
of every kind; that it was true we could never
pretend to go over to <HI>Goa,</HI> or the Coast of
<HI>Malabar</HI> in a Canoe, which tho' we could all
get into it, and that it would bear the Sea
well enough, yet would not hold our Provi∣sions,
and especially we could not put fresh
Water enough into it for the Voyage; and to
make such an Adventure would be nothing but
meer running into certain Destruction, and yet
that nevertheless I was for making a Canoe.</P>
<P>They answered, that they understood all I had
said before well enough, but what I meant by
telling them first how dangerous and impossible
it was to make our Escape in a Canoe, and yet
then to advise making a Canoe, that they could
not understand.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="35"/>
To this I answer'd, that I conceiv'd our Busi∣ness
was not to attempt our Escape in a Canoe,
but that as there were other Vessels at Sea be∣sides
our Ship, and that there were few Nations
that lived on the Sea-Shore that were so barba∣rous,
but that they went to Sea in some Boats
or other, our Business was to cruise along the
Coast of the Island, which was very long, and
to seize upon the first we could get that was bet∣ter
than our own, and so from that to another,
till perhaps we might at last get a good Ship
to carry us whither ever we pleased to go.</P>
<P>Excellent Advice, says one of them, admira∣ble
Advice, says another. Yes, yes, says the
third, which was the Gunner, the <HI>English</HI> Dog
has given excellent Advice; but it is just the
way to bring us all to the Gallows; the Rogue
has given Devilish Advice, indeed, to go a
Thieving, till from a little Vessel we come to a
great Ship, and so we shall turn downright
Pyrates, the End of which is to be hanged.</P>
<P>You may call us Pyrates, says another, if you
will, and if we fall into bad Hands, we may be
used like Pyrates; but I care not for that, I'll
be a Pyrate, or any thing, nay, I'll be hang'd
for a Pyrate, rather than starve here; and there∣fore
I think the Advice is very good; and so
they cry'd all, Let us have a Canoe. The Gun∣ner
over-ruled by the rest, submitted; but as
we broke up the Council, he came to me, takes
me by the Hand, and looking into the Palm of
my hand, and into my Face too, very gravely,
My Lad, <HI>says he,</HI> thou art born to do a World
of Mischeif; thou hast commenced Pyrate very
young, but have a Caree of the Gallows, young
<PB N="34" REF="36"/>
Man; have a Care, I say, for thou wilt be an
eminent Thief.</P>
<P>I laugh'd at him, and told him, I did not
know what I might come to hereafter; but as
our Case was now▪ I should make no Scruple to
take the first Ship I came at, to get our Liber∣ty:
I only wish'd we could see one, and come
at her. Just while we were talking, one of our
Men that was at the Door of our Hutt, told us,
that the Carpenter, who, it seems, was upon a
Hill at a Distance, cried out, <HI>a Sail, a Sail.</HI></P>
<P>We all turn'd out immediately; but tho' it
was very clear Weather, we could see nothing;
but the Carpenter continuing to holloo to us, <HI>a
Sail, a Sail,</HI> away we run up the Hill, and there
we saw a Ship plainly; but it was at a very great
Distance, too far for us to make any Signal to
her. However, we made a Fire upon the Hill,
with all the Wood we could get together, and
made as much Smoke as possible. The Wind
was down, and it was almost calm; but as we
thought by a Perspective Glass which the Gun∣ner
had in his Pocket, her Sails were full,
and she stood away large with the Wind at
E. N. E. taking no Notice of our Signal,
but making for the Cape <HI>de bona Speranza;</HI> so
we had no Comfort from her.</P>
<P>We went therefore immediately to Work about
our intended Canoe, and having singled out a ve∣ry
large Tree to our Mind, we fell to Work with
her; and having three good Axes among us, we
got it down, but it was four Days time first, tho'
we worked very hard too. I do not remember
what Wood it was, or exactly what Dimensi∣ons▪
but I remember that it was a very large one,
and we were as much encouraged when we laun∣ched
<PB N="35" REF="37"/>
it, and found it swam upright and steady,
as we would have been at another time, if we
had a good Man of War at our Command.</P>
<P>She was so very large, that she carried us all
very easily, and would have carried two or
three Ton of Baggage with us; so that we began
to consult about going to Sea directly to <HI>Goa;</HI> but
many other Considerations check'd that Thought,
especially when we came to look nearer into it;
such as Want of Provisions, and no Casks for fresh
Water; no Compass to steer by; no Shelter from
the Breach of the high Sea, which would cer∣tainly
founder us; no Defence from the Heat of
the Weather, and the like; so that they all came
readily into my Project, to cruise about where
we were, and see what might offer.</P>
<P>Accordingly, to gratify our Fancy, we went
one Day all out to Sea in her together, and we
were in a very fair Way to have had enough of
it; for when she had us all on Board, and that
we were gotten about Half a League to Sea, there
happening to be a pretty high Swell of the Sea,
tho' little or no Wind, yet she wallow'd so in
the Sea, that we all of us thought she would
at last wallow her self Bottom up; so we set
all to Work to get her in nearer the Shore, and
giving her fresh Way in the Sea, she swam more
steady, and with some hard Work we got her
under the Land again.</P>
<P>We were now at a great Loss; the Natives
were civil enough to us, and came often to dis∣course
with us; one time they brought one whom
they shew'd Respect to as a King, with them,
and they set up a long Pole between them and
us, with a great Tossel of Hair hanging, not on
the Top, but something above the Middle of it,
<PB N="36" REF="38"/>
adorn'd with little Chains, Shells, Bits of Brass,
and the like; and this we understood afterwards
was a Token of Amity and Friendship, and they
brought down to us Victuals in Abundance, Cat∣tel,
Fowls, Herbs, Roots, but we were in the
utmost Confusion on our Side; for we had no∣thing
to buy with, or exchange for; and as to
giving us things for nothing, they had no No∣tion
of that again. As to our Money, it was
meer Trash to them, they had no Value for it;
so that we were in a fair Way to be starved.
Had we had but some Toys and Trinckets, Brass
Chains, Baubles, Glass Beads, or in a Word, the
veriest Trifles that a Ship Loading would not have
been worth the Freight, we might have bought
Cattel and Provisions enough for an Army, or
to Victual a Fleet of Men of War, but for Gold
or Silver we could get nothing.</P>
<P>Upon this we were in a strange Consternati∣on.
I was but a young Fellow, but I was for
falling upon them with our Fire Arms; and
taking all the Cattel from them, and send them
to the Devil to stop their Hunger, rather than
be starved our selves; but I did not consider
that this might have brought Ten Thousand of
them down upon us the next Day; and tho'
we might have killed a vast Number of them,
and perhaps have frighted the rest, yet their
own Desperation, and our small Number, would
have animated them so, that one time or other
they would have destroy'd us all.</P>
<P>In the Middle of our Consultation, one of
our Men who had been a kind of a Cutler, or
Worker in Iron, started up, and ask'd the Car∣penter,
if among all his Tools he could not help
him to a File. Yes, says the Carpenter, I can,
<PB N="37" REF="39"/>
but it is a small one. The smaller the better,
says the other. Upon this he goes to Work,
and first by heating a Piece of an old broken
Chissel in the Fire, and then with the Help of
his File, he made himself several Kinds of Tools
for his Work; and then he takes three or four
Pieces of Eight, and beats them out with a Ham∣mer
upon a Stone, till they were very broad and
thin, then he cut them out into the Shape of
Birds and Beast; he made little Chains of them
for Bracelets and Necklaces, and turn'd them in∣to
so many Devices, of his own Head, that it is
hardly to be exprest.</P>
<P>When he had for about a Fortnight exercised
his Head and Hands at this Work, we try'd the
Effect of his Ingenuity; and having another Mee∣ting
with the Natives, were surprized to see the
Folly of the poor People. For a little Bit of
Silver cut out in the Shape of a Bird, we had
two Cows; and, which was our Loss, if it had
been in Brass, it had been still of more Value.
For one of the Bracelets made of Chain-work,
we had as much Provision of several Sorts, as
would fairly have been worth in <HI>England,</HI> Fifteen
or Sixteen Pounds; and so of all the rest. Thus,
that which when it was in Coin was not worth
Six-pence to us, when thus converted into Toys
and Trifles, was worth an Hundred Times its
real Value, and purchased for us any thing we
had Occasion for.</P>
<P>In this Condition, we lived upwards of a Year,
but all of us began to be very much tir'd of it, and
whatever came of it, resolv'd to attempt an Escape.
We had furnished our selves with no less than
three very good Canoes; and as the <HI>Monsoones,</HI>
or Trade-Winds, generally affect that Country,
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
blowing in most Parts of this Island one six Months
of a Year one Way, and the other six Months
another Way, we concluded we might be able
to bear the Sea well enough. But always when
we came to look nearer into it, the Want of
fresh Water was the thing that put us off from
such an Adventure, for it is a prodigious Length,
and what no Man on Earth could be able to
perform without Water to drink.</P>
<P>Being thus prevailed upon by our own Rea∣son
to set the Thoughts of that Voyage aside,
we had then but two things before us; one was,
to put to Sea the other Way, <HI>viz.</HI> West, and go
away for the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> where first or
last we should meet with some of our own Coun∣try
Ships, or else to put for the main Land of
<HI>Africa,</HI> and either travel by Land, or sail along
the Coast towards the Red Sea, where we should
first or last find a Ship of some Nation or other,
that would take us up, or perhaps we might take
them up; which, by the bye, was the thing that
always run in my Head.</P>
<P>It was our ingenious Cutler, whom ever after
we called <HI>Silver-Smith,</HI> that proposed this; but
the Gunner told him, that he had been in the
Red Sea, in a <HI>Malabar</HI> Sloop, and he knew this,
that if we went into the Red Sea, we should
either be killed by the wild <HI>Arabs,</HI> or taken and
made Slaves of by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and therefore he
was not for going that Way.</P>
<P><HI>Upon this I took Occasion to put in my Vote
again.</HI> Why, <HI>said I,</HI> do we talk of being killed by the
<HI>Arabs,</HI> or made Slaves of by the <HI>Turks?</HI> Are we not
able to board almost any Vessel we shall meet with in
those Seas; and instead of their taking us, we to take
them? <HI>Well done,</HI> Pyrate, <HI>said the Gunner, he
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
that had look'd in my Hand, and told me I
should come to the Gallows;</HI> I'll say that for
him, <HI>says he,</HI> he always looks the same Way. But I
think o' my Conscience? 'tis our only Way now. <HI>Don't
tell me,</HI> says I, <HI>of being a Pyrate,</HI> we must be Pyrates,
or any thing, to get fairly out of this cursed Place.</P>
<P>In a Word, they concluded all by my Advice,
that our Business was to cruize for any thing
we could see. Why then, <HI>said I</HI> to them, our
first Business is to see, if the People upon this
Island have no Navigation, and what Boats they
use; and if they have any better or bigger than
ours, let us take one of them. First indeed all
our Aim was to get, if possible, a Boat with a
Deck and a Sail; for then we might have saved
our Provisions, which otherwise we could not.</P>
<P>We had, to our great good Fortune, one Sailor
among us, who had been Assistant to the Cook,
he told us, that he would find a Way how to
preserve our Beef, without Cask or Pickle; and
this he did effectually by curing it in the Sun,
with the Help of Salt-Petre, of which there
was great Plenty in the Island; so that before
we found any Method for our Escape, we had
dry'd the Flesh of six or seven Cows and Bul∣locks,
and ten or twelve Goats, and it relished so
well, that we never gave our selves the Trou∣ble
to boil it when we eat it, but either broiled
it, or eat it dry: But our main Difficulty about
fresh Water still remained; for we had no Ves∣sel
to put any into, much less to keep any for
our going to Sea.</P>
<P>But our first Voyage being only to coast the
Island, we resolved to venture? whatever the
Hazard or Consequence of it might be; and in
order to preserve as much fresh Water as we
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
could, our Carpenter made a Well thwart the
Middle of one of our Canoes, which he sepa∣rated
from the other Parts of the Canoe, so as to
make it tight to hold the Water, and cover'd
so as we might step upon it; and this was so
large, that it held near a Hogshead of Water
very well. I cannot better describe this Well,
than by the same Kind which the small Fisher-Boats
in <HI>England</HI> have to preserve their Fish alive
in; only, that this, instead of having Holes to
let the Salt Water in, was made sound every
Way to keep it out; and it was the first Inven∣tion,
I believe, of its Kind, for such an Use:
But Necessity is a Spur to Ingenuity, and the
Mother of Invention.</P>
<P>It wanted but a little Consultation to resolve
now upon our Voyage. The first Design was only
to coast it round the Island, as well to see if we
could seize upon any Vessel fit to embark our selves
in, as also to take hold of any Opportunity which
might present for our passing over to the Main;
and therefore our Resolution was to go on the
Inside, or West Shore of the Island, where at
least at one Point, the Land stretching a great
Way to the North-West, the Distance is not
extraordinary great from the Island to the Coast
of <HI>Africk.</HI></P>
<P>Such a Voyage, and with such a desperate
Crew, I believe was never made; for it is cer∣tain
we took the worst Side of the Island to look
for any Shipping, especially for Shipping of other
Nations, this being quite out of the Way: How∣ever,
we put to Sea, after taking all our Provisi∣ons
and Ammunition, Bag and Baggage on Board;
we had made both Mast and Sail for our two
large Periagua's, and the other we paddl'd along
<PB N="41" REF="43"/>
as well as we could; but when a Gale sprung up,
we took her in Tow.</P>
<P>We sail'd merrily forward for several Days,
meeting with nothing to interrupt us, We saw
several of the Natives in small Canoes, catching
Fish, and sometimes we endeavoured to come near
enough to speak with them, but they were al∣ways
shye, and afraid of us, making in for the
Shore, as soon as we attempted it; till one of our
Company remember'd the Signal of Friendship
which the Natives made us from the South Part of
the Island, <HI>viz.</HI> of setting up a long Pole, and put
us in Mind, that perhaps it was the same thing
to them as a Flag of Truce was to us: So we
resolved to try it; and accordingly the next time
we saw any of their Fishing Boats at Sea, we put
up a Pole in our Canoe that had no Sail, and
rowed towards them. As soon as they saw the
Pole, they staid for us, and as we came nearer,
paddl'd towards us. When they came to us,
they shewed themselves very much pleased, and
gave us some large Fish, of which we did not
know the Names, bnt they were very good. It
was our Misfortune still, that we had nothing to
give them in Return; but our Artist, of whom
I spoke before, gave them two little thin Plates
of Silver, beaten, as I said before, out of a Piece
of Eight; they were cut in a Diamond Square,
longer one way than t'other, and a Hole punch'd
at one of the longest Corners. This they were
so found of, that they made us stay till they had
cast their Lines and Nets again, and gave us as
many Fish as we cared to have.</P>
<P>All this while we had our Eyes upon their
Boats, view'd them very narrowly, and exami∣ned
whether any of them were fit for our Turn;
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
but they were poor sorry things; their Sail was
made of a large Matt, only one that was of a
Piece of Cotton Stuff, fit for little, and their
Ropes were twisted Flags, of no Strength; so we
concluded we were better as we were, and let
them alone. We went forward to the North,
keeping the Coast close on Board for twelve Days
together; and having the Wind at East, and
E. S. E. we made very fresh Way. We saw no
Towns on the Shore, but often saw some Hutts
by the Water Side, upon the Rocks, and always
Abundance of People about them, who we could
perceive run together to ftare at us.</P>
<P>It was as odd a Voyage as ever Men went:
We were a little Fleet of three Ships, and an
Army of between Twenty and Thirty as dangerous
Fellows as ever they had among them; and had
they known what we were they would have com∣pounded
to give us every thing we desired, to
be rid of us.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, we were as miserable as
Nature could well make us to be; for we were
upon <HI>a</HI> Voyage and <HI>no</HI> Voyage, we were bound
<HI>some</HI> where and <HI>no</HI> where; for tho' we knew
what we intended to do, we did really not know
what we were doing: We went forward and for∣ward
by a Northerly Course; and as we advan∣ced,
the Heat increased, which began to be into∣lerable
to us who were upon the Water, with∣out
any Covering from Heat or Wet; besides
we were now in the Month of <HI>October,</HI> or there∣abouts,
in a Southern Latitude, and as we went eve∣ry
Day nearer the Sun, the Sun came also eve∣ry
Day nearer to us, till at last we found our
selves in the Latitude of 20 Degrees, and having
past the Tropick about five or six Days before that,
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
in a few Days more the Sun would be in the
Zenith, just over our Heads.</P>
<P>Upon these Considerations we resolved to seek
for a good Place to go on Shore again, and pitch
our Tents till the Heat of the Weather abated.
We had by this time measured Half the Length
of the Island, and were come to that Part where
the Shore tending away to the North-West, pro∣mised
fair to make our Passage over to the main
Land of <HI>Africk,</HI> much shorter than we expected.
But notwithstanding that, we had good Reason
to believe it was about 120 Leagues.</P>
<P>So, the Heats consider'd, we resolved to take
Harbour; besides, our Provisions were exhau∣sted,
and we had not many Days Store left.
Accordingly, putting in for the Shore early in
the Morning, as we usually did once in three
or four Days, for fresh Water, we sat down
and considered, whether we should go on, or take
up our Standing there; but upon several Con∣siderations
too long to repeat here, we did not
like the Place, so we resolved to go on for a few
Days longer.</P>
<P>After Sailing on N. W. by N. with a fresh Gale
at S. E. about six Days, we found at a great Di∣stance,
a large Promontory, or Cape of Land,
pushing out a long Way into the Sea; and as
we were exceeding fond of seeing what was be∣yond
the Cape, we resolved to double it before
we took into Harbour; so we kept on our Way,
the Gale continuing, and yet it was four Days
more before we reach'd the Cape. But it is
not possible to express the Discouragement and
Melancholy that seized us all when we came
thither; for when we made the Head Land
of the Cape, we were surprized to see the Shore
<PB N="44" REF="46"/>
fall away on the other Side, as much as it had
advanced on this Side, and a great deal more;
and that, in short, if we would adventure over
to the Shore of <HI>Africk,</HI> it must be from hence;
for that if we went further, the Breadth of the
Sea still increased, and to what Breadth it might
increase, we knew not.</P>
<P>While we mused upon this Discovery, we were
surprized with very bad Weather, and especially
violent Rains, with Thunder and Lightning most
unusually terrible to us. In this Pickle we run
for the Shore, and getting under the Lee of the
Cape, run our Frigates into a little Creek, where
we saw the Land overgrown with Trees, and
made all the Haste possible to get on Shore, be∣ing
exceeding wet, and fatigued with the Heat,
the Thunder, Lightning and Rain.</P>
<P>Here we thought our Case was very deplora∣ble
indeed, and therefore our Artist, of whom
I have spoken so often, set up a great Cross of
Wood on the Hill, which was within a Mile of
the Head Land, with these Words, but in the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Point Desperation. Jesus have Mercy!</P>
<P>We set to work immediately to build us some
Hutts, and so get our Clothes dry'd, and tho' I
was young, and had no Skill in such Things,
yet I shall never forget the little City we built,
for it was no less; and we fortify'd it accordingly;
and the Idea is so fresh in my Thought, that I can∣not
but give a short Description of it.</P>
<P>Our Camp was on the South Side of a little
Creek on the Sea, and under the Shelter of a steep
Hill, which lay, tho' on the other Side of the
Creek, yet within a Quarter of a Mile of us
N. W. by N. and very happily itercepted the
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
Heat of the Sun all the after Part of the Day.
The Spot we pitched on had a little fresh Water,
Brook, or a Stream running into the Creek by
us, and we saw Cattle feeding in the Plains and
and low Ground, East and to the South of us a
great Way.</P>
<P>Here we set up twelve little Hutts, like Sol∣diers
Tents, but made of the Boughs of Trees
stuck into the Ground, and bound together on
the Top with Withes, and such other things
as we could get; the Creek was our Defence on
the North, a little Brook on the West, and
the South and East Sides we fortify'd with a
Bank, which entirely covered our Hutts; and
being drawn oblique from the North West to
the South East, made our City a Triangle.
Behind the Bank, or Line, our Hutts stood, ha∣ving
three other Hutts behind them at a good
Distance. In one of these, which was a little one,
and stood further off, we put our Gun-powder,
and nothing else, for fear of Danger; in the
other, which was bigger, we drest our Victuals,
and put all our Necessaries; and in the third,
which was biggest of all, we eat our Dinners,
called our Councils, and sat and diverted our
selves with such Conversation as we had one
with another, which was but indifferent truly at
that time.</P>
<P>Our Correspondence with the Natives was ab∣solutely
necessary, and our Artist, the Cutler,
having made Abundance of those little Diamond
cut Squares of Silver, with these we made Shift
to Traffick with the black People for what we
wanted; for indeed they were pleased wonder∣fully
with them: And thus we got Plenty of
Provisions. At first, and in particular, we got
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
about fifty Head of Black Cattel and Goats, and
our Cook's Mate took care to cure them, and dry
them, salt and preserve them for our grand
Supply; nor was this hard to do, the Salt and
Salt-Petre being very good, and the Sun ex∣cessively
hot; and here we lived about four
Months.</P>
<P>The Southern Solstice was over, and the Sun
gone back towards the <HI>Equinoctial,</HI> when we con∣sidered
of our next Adventure, which was to go
over the Sea of <HI>Zanquebar,</HI> as the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
call it, and to land, if possible, upon the Conti∣nent
of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>We talked with many of the Natives about
it, such as we could make our selves intelligible
to; but all that we could learn from them was,
that there was a great Land of Lions beyond
the Sea, but that it was a great Way off; we
knew as well as they that it was a long Way, but
our People differed mightily about it: Some
said it was 150 Leagues, others not above
100. One of our Men that had a Map of the
World shewed us by his Scale, that it was
not above 80 Leagues. Some said there were
Islands all the Way to touch at; some that there
were no Islands at all: For my Part, I knew
nothing of this Matter one way or another, but
heard it all without Concern, whether it was
near or far off; however, this we learned from
an old Man who was blind, and led about by a
Boy, that if we stay'd till the End of <HI>August,</HI> we
should be sure of the Wind to be fair, and the
Sea smooth all the Voyage.</P>
<P>This was some Encouragement, but staying
again was very unwelcome News to us, because
that then the Sun would be returning again
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
to the South, which was what our Men were
very unwilling to. At last we called a Council of
our whole Body; their Debates were too tedi∣ous
to take Notice of, only to note, that when it
came to <HI>Captain Bob,</HI> (for so they called me ever
since I had taken State upon me before one of
their great Princes) truly I was on no Side,
it was not one Farthing Matter to me, I told
them, whether we went or stayed, I had no home,
and all the World was alike to me; so I left it
entirely to them to determine.</P>
<P>In a Word, they saw plainly there was nothing
to be done where we were, without Shipping;
that if our Business indeed was only to eat and
drink, we could not find a better Place in the
World; but if our Business was to get away, and
get home into our own Country, we could not
find a Worse.</P>
<P>I confess, I liked the Country wonderfully,
and even then had strange Notions of coming
again to live there; and I used to say to them
very often, that if I had but a Ship of 20 Guns,
and a Sloop, and both well Manned, I would not
desire a better Place in the World to make my
self as rich as a King.</P>
<P>But to return to the Consultations they were
in about going: Upon the whole, it was resolved
to venture over for the Main; and venture we
did, madly enough, indeed; for it was the
wrong time of the Year to undertake such
a Voyage in that Country; for, as the Winds
hang Easterly all the Months from <HI>September</HI>
to <HI>March,</HI> so they generally hang Westerly all
the rest of the Year, and blew right in our
Teeth, so that as soon as we had, with a kind
of a Land Breeze, stretched over about 15 or 20
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
Leagues, and, as I may say, just enough to lose
our selves, we found the Wind set in a steady
fresh Gale or Breeze from the Sea, at West
W. S. W. or S. W. by W. and never further
from the West; so that, in a Word we could
make nothing of it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Vessel, such as we had
would not lye close upon a Wind; if so, we
might have stretched away N. N. W. and have
met with a great many Islands in our Way, as
we found afterwards; but we could make no∣thing
of it, tho' we tried, and by the trying had
almost undone us all; for, stretching away to
the North, as near the Wind as we could, we
had forgotten the Shape and Position of the Island
of <HI>Madagascar</HI> it self; how that we came off at
the Head of a Promontory or Point of Land
that lies about the Middle of the Island, and
that stretches out West a great way into the Sea;
and that now being run a Matter of 40 Leagues
to the North, the Shore of the Island fell
off again above 200 Miles to the East, so that
we were by this Time in the wide Ocean, be∣tween
the Island and the Main, and almost 100
Leagues from both.</P>
<P>Indeed as the Winds blew fresh at West, as
before, we had a smooth Sea, and we found it
pretty good going before it, and so taking our
smallest Canoe in Tow, we stood in for the Shore
with all the Sail we could make. This was a
terrible Adventure; for if the least Gust of Wind
had come, we had been all lost, our Canoes be∣ing
deep, and in no Condition to make Way in a
high Sea.</P>
<P>This Voyage, however, held us eleven Days
in all, and at length having spent most of our
<PB N="49" REF="51"/>
Provisions, and every Drop of Water we had,
we spied Land, to our great Joy, tho' at the Dist∣ance
of ten or eleven Leagues, and as under
the Land, the Wind came off like a Land Breeze,
and blew hard against us, we were two Days
more before we reached the Shore, having
all that while excessive hot Weather, and not a
Drop of Water, or any other Liquor, except
some Cordial Waters, which one of our Com∣pany
had a little of left in a Case of Bottles.</P>
<P>This gave us a Taste of what we should have
done, if we had ventured forward with a scant
Wind and uncertain Weather, and gave us a
Surfeit of our Design for the Main, at least 'till we
might have some better Vessels under us; so
we went on Shore again, and pitched our Camp,
as before, in as convenient Manner as we could,
fortifying our selves against any Surprize; but
the Natives here were exceeding courteous, and
much civiller than on the South Part of the
Island; and tho' we could not understand what
they said, or they us, yet we found Means to
make them understand that we were Sea-faring
Men, and Strangers; and that we were in Di∣stress
for want of Provisions.</P>
<P>The first Proof we had of their Kindness was,
that, as soon as they saw us come on Shore, and
begin to make our Habitation, one of their Cap∣tains
or Kings, for we knew not what to call
them, came down with five or six Men and some
Women, and brought us five Goats and two
young fat Steers, and gave them to us for no∣thing;
and when we went to offer them any
thing, the Captain, or the King, would not let
any of them touch it, or take any thing of us.
About two Hours after came another King or Cap∣tain,
<PB N="50" REF="52"/>
with forty or fifty Men after him; we
began to be afraid of him, and laid Hands upon
our Weapons; but he perceiving it, caused two
Men to go before him carrying two long Poles
in their Hands, which they held upright, as
high as they could, which we presently per∣ceiv'd
was a Signal of Peace, and these two Poles
they set up afterwards sticking them up in the
Ground; and when the King and his Men came
to these two Poles, they stuck all their Lances
up in the Ground, and came on unarmed, lea∣ving
their Lances, as also their Bows and Arrows
behind them.</P>
<P>This was to satisfy us, that they were come as
Friends, and we were very glad to see it; for
we had no Mind to quarrel with them, if we
could help it. The Captain of this Gang seeing
some of our Men making up their Hutts, and
that they did it but bunglingly, he becken'd
to some of his Men to go and help us. Immedia∣tely
15 or 16 of them came and mingled a∣mong
us, and went to Work for us; and, in∣deed,
they were better Workmen than we were,
for they run up three or four Hutts for us
in a Moment, and much handsomer done than
ours.</P>
<P>After this they sent us Milk, Plantanes, Pump∣kins,
and Abundance of Roots and Greens that
were very good, and then took their Leave,
and would not take any thing from us that we
had. One of our Men offer'd the King or Captain
of these Men a Dram, which he drank, and was
mightily pleased with it, and held out his
Hand for another, which we gave him; and, in
a Word, after this, he hardly failed coming to
us two or three times a Week, always bringing
<PB N="51" REF="53"/>
us something or other, and one time sent us seven
Head of Black Cattle, some of which we
cured and dried as before.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but remember one thing'
which afterwards stood us in great stead, <HI>viz.</HI>
that the Flesh of their Goats and their Beef also,
but especially the former, when we had dried
and cured it, looked red, and eat hard and firm,
as dry'd Beef in <HI>Holland;</HI> they were so pleased
with it, and it was such a Dainty to them, that
at any time after they would Trade with us
for it, not knowing, or so much as imagining,
what it was; so that for Ten or Twelve Pound
Weight of smoked dry'd Beef, they would
give us a whole Bullock, or Cow, or any thing
else we could desire.</P>
<P>Here we observed two Things that were very
material to us, even essentially so; first, we
found they had a great deal of Earthen-Ware
here, which they make use of many ways, as
we did: Particularly they had long deep Earthen
Pots, which they used to sink into the Ground
to keep the Water which they drank cool and
pleasant; and the other was, that they had lar∣ger
Canoes than their Neighbours had.</P>
<P>By this we were prompted to enquire if they
had no larger Vessels than those we saw there;
or if any other of the Inhabitants had not such.
They signified presently, that they had no larger
Boats than that they shewed us; but that on the
other Side of the Island they had larger Boats,
and that with Decks upon them, and large Sails;
and this made us resolve to Coast round the
whole Island to see them; so we prepared and
victualled our Canoe for the Voyage, and, in a
Word, went to Sea for the third time.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="54"/>
It cost us a Month or six Weeks time to per∣form
this Voyage, in which time we went on
Shore several times for Water and Provisions, and
found. the Natives always very free and cour∣teous;
but we were surprized one Morning early,
being at the Extremity of the Northermost Part of
the Island, when one of our Men cried out <HI>a Sail,
a Sail:</HI> We presently saw a Vessel a great Way
out at Sea; but after we had looked at it with
our Perspective Glasses, and endeavoured all we
could to make out what it was, we could not
tell what to think of it; for it was neither Ship,
Ketch, Gally, Galliot, or like any thing that
we had ever seen before: All that we could
make of it was, that it went from us standing
out to Sea. In a Word, we soon lost Sight of it,
for we were in no Condition to chase any thing,
and we never saw it again, but by all we could
perceive of it, from what we saw of such things
afterwards, it was some <HI>Arabian</HI> Vessel which
had been trading to the Coast of <HI>Mosambique,</HI> or
<HI>Zanguebar,</HI> the same Place where we afterwards
went, as you shall hear.</P>
<P>I kept no Journal of this Voyage, nor indeed
did I all this while understand any thing of Na∣vigation,
more than the common Business of a
Fore-mast Man; so I can say nothing to the La∣titudes
or Distances of any Places we were at,
how long we were going, or how far we sailed
in a Day; but this I remember, that being now
come round the Island, we sailed up the Eastern
Shore due South, as we had done down the We∣stern
Shore due North before.</P>
<P>Nor do I remember that the Natives differed
much from one another, either in Stature or
Complexion, or in their Manners, their Habits
<PB N="53" REF="55"/>
their Weapons, or indeed in any thing; and yet
we could not perceive that they had any Intelli∣gence
one with another; but they were extreme∣ly
kind and civil to us on this Side, as well as
on the other.</P>
<P>We continued our Voyage South for many
Weeks, tho' with several Intervals of going on
Shore to get Provisions and Water. At length,
coming round a Point of Land which lay about
a League farther than ordinary into the Sea, we
were agreeably surprized with a Sight, which,
no doubt, had been as disagreeable to those con∣cern'd,
as it was pleasant to us. This was the
Wreck of an <HI>European</HI> Ship, which had been cast
away upon the Rocks, which in that Place run a
great Way into the Sea.</P>
<P>We could see plainly at Low Water, a great
deal of the Ship lay dry; even at High Water,
she was not entirely covered; and that at most
she did not lye above a League from the Shore.
It will easily be believ'd, that our Curiosity led
us, the Wind and Weather also permitting, to go
directly to her, which we did without any Diffi∣culty,
and presently found that it was a <HI>Dutch</HI>-built
Ship, and that she could not have been very
long in that Condition, a great deal of the upper
Work of her Stem remaining firm, with the
Mizen Mast standing. Her Stern seem'd to be
jaum'd in between two Ridges of the Rock,
and so remained fast, all the Fore-part of the Ship
having been beaten to Pieces.</P>
<P>We could see nothing to be gotten out of
the Wreck that was worth our while; but we
resolv'd to go on Shore, and stay sometime there∣abouts,
to see if perhaps we might get any Light
into the Story of her, and we were not without
<PB N="54" REF="56"/>
Hopes that we might hear something more parti∣cular
about her Men, and perhaps find some of
them on Shore there, in the same Condition that
we were in, and so might encrease our Com∣pany.</P>
<P>It was a very pleasant Sight to us, when co∣ming
on Shore, we saw all the Marks and To∣kens
of a Ship-Carpenter's Yard; as a Launch
Block and Craddles, Scaffolds and Planks, and
Pieces of Planks, the Remains of the Building a
Ship or Vessel; and, in a Word, a great many
things that fairly invited us to go about the
same Work, and we soon came to undersand, that
the Men belonging to the Ship that was lost, had
saved themselves on Shore, perhaps in their Boat,
and had built themselves a Bark or Sloop, and so
were gone to Sea again; and enquiring of the
Natives which Way they went, they pointed to
the South and South-West, by which we could
easily understand that they were gone away to the
<HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>No body will imagine we could be so dull as not
to gather from hence, that we might take the
same Method for our Escapes; so we resolved first
in general, that we would try, if possible, to
build us a Boat of one Kind or other, and go
to Sea as our Fate should direct.</P>
<P>In order to this, our first Work was to have
the two Carpenters search about to see what Ma∣terials
the <HI>Dutchment</HI> had left behind them that
might be of Use; and in particular, they found
one that was very useful, and which I was much em∣ploy'd
about, and that was a Pitch-Kettle, and a
little Pitch in it.</P>
<P>When we came to set close to this Work, we
found it very laborious and difficult, having but
<PB N="55" REF="57"/>
few Tools, no Iron Work, no Cordage, no Sails;
so that, in short, whatever we built, we were
oblig'd to be our own Smiths, Rope-Makers,
Sail-Makers, and indeed to practise twenty Trades
that we knew little or nothing of: However, Ne∣cessity
was the Spur to Invention, and we did ma∣ny
things which before we thought impracticable,
that is to say, in our Circumstances.</P>
<P>After our two Carpenters had resolved upon
the Dimensions of what they would build, they
set us all to Work, to go off in our Boats, and
split up the Wreck of the old Ship, and to bring
away every thing we could; and particularly,
that, if possible, we should bring away the Mi∣zen
Mast, which was left sanding, which with
much Difficulty we effected, after above twenty
Days Labour of fourteen of our Men.</P>
<P>At the same time we got out a great deal of
Iron-Work; as Bolts, Spikes, Nails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which
our Artist, of whom I have spoken already, who
was now grown a very dexterous Smith, made us
Nails and Hinges for our Rudder, and Spikes
such as we wanted.</P>
<P>But we wanted an Anchor, and if we had had
an Anchor, we could not have made a Cable;
so we contented our selves with making some
Ropes with the Help of the Natives, of such Stuff
as they made their Matts of, and with these
we made such a kind of cable or <HI>Tow Line,</HI> as
was sufficient to fasten our Vessel to the Shore,
which we contented our selves with for that
time.</P>
<P>To be short, we spent four Months here, and
work'd very hard too; at the End of which
time we launch'd our Frigate, which, in a few
Words, had many Defects, but yet, all things
<PB N="56" REF="58"/>
considered, it was as well as we could expect
it to be.</P>
<P>In short, it was a kind of a Sloop, of the
Burthen of near 18 or 20 Ton, and had we
had Masts and Sails; standing, and running Rig∣ging,
as is usual in such Cases, and other Con∣veniences,
the Vessel might have carry'd us
wherever we could have had a Mind to go; but
of all the Materials we wanted, this was the
worst, <HI>viz.</HI> that we had no Tar or Pitch to pay the
Seams, and secure the Bottom; and tho' we did
what we could with Tallow and Oil, to make
a Mixture to supply that Part, yet we could not
bring it to answer our End fully; and when
we launch'd her into the Water, she was so
leaky, and took in the Water so fast, that we
thought all our Labour had been lost, for we
had much ado to make her swim; and as for
Pumps, we had none, nor had we any Means
to make one.</P>
<P>But at length one of the Natives, a black
<HI>Negro-man,</HI> shewed us a Tree, the Wood of which
being put into the Fire, sends forch a Liquid
that is as glutinous, and almost as strong as Tar,
and of which, by boiling, we made a Sort of
Stuff which serv'd us for Pitch, and this answe∣red
our End effectually; for we perfectly made
our Vessel sound and tight, so that we wanted no
Pitch or Tar at all. This Secret has stood me
in stead upon many Occasions since that time,
in the same Place.</P>
<P>Our Vessel being thus finished, out of the Mi∣zen
Mast of the Ship, we made a very good
Mast to her, and fitted our Sails to it as well as
we could; then we made a Rudder and Tiller;
and, in a Word, every thing that our present
<PB N="57" REF="59"/>
Necessity called upon us for; and having victu∣alled
her, and put as much fresh Water on Board
as we thought we wanted, or as we knew how
to stow (for we were yet without Casks) we put
to Sea with a fair Wind.</P>
<P>We had spent near another Year in these
Rambles, and in this Piece of Work; for it was
now, as our Men said, about the Beginning of
our <HI>February,</HI> and the Sun went from us apace,
which was much to our Satisfaction, for the
Heats were exceeding violent. The Wind, as
I said, was fair, for as I have since learnt, the
Winds generally spring up to the Eastward, as
the Sun goes from them to the North.</P>
<P>Our Debate now was, which Way we should
go, and never were Men so irresolute; some were
for going to the East, and stretching away dire∣ctly
for the Coast of <HI>Malabar;</HI> but others who
considered more seriously the Length of that Voy∣age,
shook their Heads at the Proposal, knowing
very well, that neither out Provisions, especially
of Water; or our Vessel, were equal to such a
Run as that is, of near 2000 Miles, without
any Land to touch at in the Way.</P>
<P>These Men too had all along had a great
Mind to a Voyage for the main Land of <HI>Africk,</HI>
where they said we should have a fair Cast for
our Lives, and might be sure to make our selves
rich which Way soever we went, if we were but
able to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make our Way through, whether by Sea
or by Land.</P>
<P>Besides, as the Case stood with us, we had
not much Choice for our Way; for if we had
resolv'd for the East, we were at the wrong Sea∣son
of the Year, and must have staid till <HI>April</HI> or
<HI>May</HI> before we had gone to Sea. At length, as
<PB N="58" REF="60"/>
we had the Wind at S. E. and E. S. E. and fine
promising Weather, we came all into the first
Proposal, and resolved for the Coast of <HI>Africa;</HI>
nor were we long in disputing as to our Coast∣ing
the Island, which we were upon; for we
were now on the wrong Side of the Island for
the Voyage we intended; So we stood away to
the North, and having rounded the Cape, we
hall'd away Southward under the Lee of the
Island, thinking to reach the West Point of Land,
which, as I observed before, runs out so far
towards the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> as would have shor∣ten'd
our Run almost 100 Leagues. But when
we had sailed about thirty Leagues, we found
the Winds variable under the Shore, and right
against us; so we concluded to stand over di∣rectly,
for then we had the Wind fair, and our
Vessel was but very ill fitted to lye near the
Wind, or any Way indeed but just afore it.</P>
<P>Having resolv'd upon it therefore, we put
in to the Shore, to furnish our selves again
with fresh Water and other Provisions, and about
the latter End of <HI>March,</HI> with more Courage than
Discretion, more Resolution than Judgement, we
launch'd for the main Coast of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>As for me, I had no Anxieties about it; so that
we had but a View of reaching some Land or
other, I cared not what or where it was to be,
having at this time no Views of what was before
me, nor much Thought of what might, or might
not befal me; but with as little Consideration as
any one can be supposed to have at my Age, I
consented to every thing that was proposed,
however hazardous the thing it self, however
improbable the Success.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="61"/>
The Voyage, as it was undertaken with a great
deal of Ignorance and Desperation, so really it
was not carry'd on with much Resolution or
Judgment; for we knew no more of the Course
we were to steer, than this, that it was any
where about the West, within two or three
Points N. or S. and as we had no Compass with
us, but a little Brass Pocket Compass, which one
of our Men had more by Accident than other∣wise,
so we could not be very exact in our
Course.</P>
<P>However, as it pleased God that the Wind
continued fair at S. E. and by E. we found that
N. W. by W. which was right afore it, was as
good a Course for us as any we could go, and
thus we went on.</P>
<P>The Voyage was much longer than we expe∣cted;
our Vessel also, which had no Sail that
was proportion'd to her, made but very little
Way in the Sea, and sail'd heavily. We had
indeed no great Adventures happen'd in this
Voyage, being out of the Way of every thing
that could offer to divert us; and as for seeing
any Vessel, we had not the least Occasion to hail
any thing in all the Voyage; for we saw not
one Vessel small or great, the Sea we were upon
being entirely out of the way of all Commerce;
for the People of <HI>Madagascar</HI> knew no more of
the Shores of <HI>Africa</HI> than we did, only that
there was a Country of Lions, as they call <HI>it,
that Way.</HI></P>
<P>We had been eight or nine Days under Sail,
with a fair Wind, when, to our great Joy one
of our Men cry'd out, <HI>Land.</HI> We had great
Reason to be glad of the Discovery; for we had
not Water enough left for above two or three
<PB N="60" REF="62"/>
Days more, tho' at a short Allowance. Howe∣ver,
tho' it was early in the Morning when we
discover'd it, we made it near Night before we
reach'd it, the Wind slackening almost to a Calm,
and our Ship being, as I said, a very dull Sailer.</P>
<P>We were sadly baulk'd upon our coming to the
Land, when we found, that instead of the main
Land of <HI>Africk,</HI> it was only a little Istand, with
no Inhabitants upon it, at least, none that we
could find; nor any Cattel, except a few Goats,
of which we killed three only. However, they
served us for fresh Meat, and we found very
good Water; and it was fifteen Days more be∣fore
we reach'd the Main, which, however, at
last we arriv'd at; and which was most essen∣tial
to us, we came to it just as all our Provi∣sions
were spent. Indeed we may say they were
spent first; for we had but a Pint of Water a
Day to each Man for the last two Days. But
to our great Joy, we saw the Land, tho' at a great
Distance, the Evening before, and by a pleasant
Gale in the Night, were, by Morning, within
two Leagues of the Shore.</P>
<P>We never scrupled going ashore at the first
Place we came at, tho' had we had Patience,
we might have found a very fine River a little
farther North. However, we kept our Frigate
on Float by the Help of two great Poles which
we fasten'd into the Ground to <HI>More</HI> her, like
Piles; and the little weak Ropes, which, as I said,
we had made of Matting, served us well enough
to make the Vessel fast.</P>
<P>As soon as we had viewed the Country a little,
got fresh Water, and furnished our selves with some
Victuals, which we found very scarce here, we
went onboard again withour Stores. All we got for
<PB N="61" REF="63"/>
Provision, was some Fowls that we killed, and a
kind of wild Buffloe, or Bull, very small, but good
Meat: I say, having got these things on Board,
we resolved to sail on along the Coast, which lay
away N. N. E. till we found some Creek or River
that we might run up into the Country, or some
Town or People; for we had Reason enough to
know the Place was inhabited, because we seve∣ral
times saw Fires in the Night, and Smoke in
the Day, every way at a Distance from us.</P>
<P>At length we came to a very large Bay, and in
it several little Creeks or Rivers emptying them∣selves
into the Sea, and we run boldly into the
first Creek we came at; where seeing some Hutts
and wild People about them, on the Shore, we run
our Vessel into a little Cove on the North Side
of the Creek, and held up a long Pole with a
white Bit of Cloath on it, for a Signal of Peace
to them. We found they understood us pre∣sently,
for they came flocking to us both Men,
Women, and Children, most of them of both
Sexes stark naked. At first they stood wondering
and staring at us, as if we had been Monsters,
and as if they had been frighted; but we found
they inclined to be familiar with us afterwards.
The first thing we did to try them, was, we
held up our Hands to our Mouths, as if we were
to drink, signifying that we wanted Water. This
they understood presently, and three of their
Women and two Boys ran away up the Land, and
came back in about Half a Quarter of an Hour,
with several Pots made of Earth pretty enough,
and bak'd, I suppose, in the Sun; these they
brought us full of Water, and set them down
near the Sea-shore, and there left them, go∣ing
<PB N="62" REF="64"/>
back a little, that we might fetch them,
which we did.</P>
<P>Sometime after this, they brought us Roots
and Herbs, and some Fruits which I cannot re∣member,
and gave us; but as we had nothing to
give them, we found them not so free as the
people in <HI>Madagascar</HI> were. However, our Cut∣ler
went to Work, and as he had saved some Iron
out of the Wreck of the Ship, he made Abun∣dance
of Toys, Birds, Dogs, Pins, Hooks, and
Rings, and we helped to file them, and make
them bright for him; and when we gave them
some of these, they brought us all the Sorts of
Provisions they had, such as Goats, Hogs, and
Cows, and we got Victuals enough.</P>
<P>We were now landed upon the Continent of
<HI>Africa,</HI> the most desolate, desart, and unhospita∣ble
Country in the World, even <HI>Greenland</HI> and
<HI>Nova Zembla</HI> it self not excepted; with this
Difference only, that even the worst Part of it
we found inhabited; tho' taking the Nature and
Quality of some of the Inhabitants, it might
have been much better to us if there had been
none.</P>
<P>And, to add to the Exclamation I am making
on the Nature of the Place, it was here, that we
took one of the rashest and wildest, and most
desperate Resolutions that ever was taken by
Man, or any Number of Men, in the World;
this was, to travel over Land through the Heart
of the Country, from the Coast of <HI>Mozambique,</HI>
on the East-Ocean to the Coast of <HI>Angola</HI> or <HI>Gui∣nea,</HI>
on the Western or <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, a Con∣tinent
of Land of at least 1800 Miles; in which
Journey we had excessive Heats to support, un∣passable
Desarts to go over, no Carriages, Camels
<PB N="63" REF="65"/>
or Beasts of any kind to carry our Baggage,
innumerable Numbers of wild and ravenous
Beasts to encounter with, such as Lions, Leo∣pards,
Tigers, Lizards, and Elephants; we had
the Equinoctial Line to pass under, and conse∣quently
were in the very Center of the Tor∣rid
Zone; we had Nations of Savages to en∣counter
with, barbarous and brutish to the last
Degree, Hunger and Thirst to struggle with;
and, in one Word, Terrors enough to have
daunted the stoutest Hearts that ever were placed
in Cases of Flesh and Blood.</P>
<P>Yet, fearless of all these, we resolved to ad∣venture,
and accordingly made such Preparation
for our Journey, as the Place we were in
would allow us, and such as our little Experience
of the Country seem'd to dictate to us.</P>
<P>It had been some time already that we had
been used to tread bare-footed upon the Rocks,
the Gravel, the Grass and the Sand on the Shore;
but as we found the worst thing for our Feet
was, the walking or travelling on the dry burn∣ing
Sands, within the Country; so we provided
our selves with a sort of Shoes made of the Skins
of Wild Beasts, with the Hair inward, and being
dryed in the Sun, the Out-side were thick and
hard, and would last a great while. In short,
as I called them, so I think the Term very pro∣per
still, we made us Gloves for our Feet,
and we found them very convenient and very
comfortable.</P>
<P>We conversed with some of the Natives of
the Country who were friendly enough. What
Tongue they spoke, I do not yet pretend to
know. We talked as far as we could make them
understand us, not only about our Provisions,
<PB N="64" REF="66"/>
but also about our Undertaking; and ask'd them
what Country lay that Way, pointing West with
our Hands. They told us but little to our Pur∣pose,
only we thought by all their Discourse, that
there were People to be found of one Sort or
other every where; that there were many great
Rivers, many Lions and Tygers, Elephants, and
furious wild Cats (which in the End we found to
be Civet Cats) and the like.</P>
<P>When we ask'd them, if any one had ever tra∣velled
that Way, they told us Yes, some had
gone to where the Sun sleeps, meaning to the
West; but they could not tell us who they were.
When we ask'd for some to guide us, they shrunk
up their Shoulders as <HI>Frenchmen</HI> do when they are
afraid to undertake a thing. When we ask'd
them about the Lions and wild Creatures they
laught, and let us know they would do us no
Hurt, and directed us to a good way indeed to
deal with them, and that was to make some Fire,
which would always fright them away, and so
indeed we found it.</P>
<P>Upon these Encouragements we resolved upon
our Journey, and many Considerations put us
upon it, which, had the thing it self been pra∣cticable,
we were not so much to blame for,
as it might otherwise be supposed; I'll name some
of them, not to make the Account too tedious.</P>
<P>First, We were perfectly destitute of Means
to work about our own Deliverance any
other way; we were on shore in a Place perfect∣ly
remote from all <HI>European</HI> Navigation; so that
we could never think of being relieved, and
fetch'd off by any of our own Country-men in
that Part of the World. Secondly, If we had
adventured to have sailed on along the Coast of
<PB N="65" REF="67"/>
<HI>Mozambique,</HI> and the desolate Shores of <HI>Africa</HI> to
the North, till we came to the Red Sea, all we
could hope for there, was to be taken by the
<HI>Arabs,</HI> and be sold for Slaves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> which
to all of us was little better than Death. We
could not build any thing of a Vessel that
would carry us over the great <HI>Arabian</HI> Sea
to <HI>India,</HI> nor could we reach the Cape <HI>de Bona
Speranza,</HI> the Winds being too variable, and the
Sea in that Latitude too tempestuous; but we all
knew, if we could cross this Continent of Land,
we might reach some of the great Rivers that
run into the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, and that on the
Banks of any of those Rivers we might
there build us Canoes which would carry us
down, if it were Thousands of Miles; so that
we could want nothing but Food, of which we
were assured we might kill sufficient with our
Guns: And, to add to the Satisfaction of our
Deliverance, we concluded we might every one
of us get a Quantity of Gold, which, if we came
safe, would infinitely recompence us for our Toil.</P>
<P>I cannot say, that in all our Consultations I
ever began to enter into the Weight and Merit
of any Enterprize we went upon till now. My
View before was, as I thought, very good, <HI>viz.</HI>
that we should get into the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph,
or the Mouth of the Red Sea, and waiting for
some Vessel passing, or repassing there, of which
there is Plenty, have seized upon the first
we came at, by Force, and not only have
enriched our selves with her Cargo, but have
carried our selves to what Part of the World we
had pleased: But when they came to talk to
me of a March of 2 or 3000 Miles on Foot, of
Wandering in Desarts, among Lions and Tygers,
<PB N="66" REF="68"/>
I confess my Blood run chill, and I used all the
Arguments I could to perswade them against it.</P>
<P>But they were all positive, and I might as
well have held my Tongue; so I submitted, and
told them, I would keep to our first Law, to be
governed by the Majority, and we resolved upon
our Journey. The first thing we did, was to
take an Observation, and see whereabouts in
the World we were, which we did, and found
we were in the Latitude of 12 Degrees, 35
Minutes South of the Line. The next thing was
to look on the Charts, and see the Coast of
the Country we aimed at, which we found to
be from 8 to 11 Degrees South Latitude,
if we went for the Coast of <HI>Angola,</HI> or in 12
to 19 Degrees North Latitude, if we made for
the River <HI>Niger,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Guiney.</HI></P>
<P>Our Aim was for the Coast of <HI>Angola,</HI> which
by the Charts we had, lying very near the same
Latitude we were then in, our Course thither
was due West; and as we were assured we
should meet with Rivers, we doubted not, but
that by their Help we might ease our Journey,
especially if we could find Means to cross the
great Lake, or Inland Sea, which the Natives
call <HI>Coalmucoa,</HI> out of which it is said the River
<HI>Nile</HI> has its Source or Beginning; but we reck∣oned
without our Host, as you will see in the
Sequel of our Story.</P>
<P>The next thing we had to consider was, how
to carry our Baggage, which we were first of all
determined not to travel without; neither indeed
was it possible for us to do so, for even our Am∣munition
which was absolutely necessary to us,
and on which our Subsistence, I mean for Food, as
well as our Safety; and particularly our Defence
<PB N="67" REF="69"/>
against wild Beasts, and wild Men depended: I say,
even our Ammunition was a Load too heavy for
us to carry in a Country where the Heat were
such, that we should be Load enough for our selves</P>
<P>We enquired in the Country, and found there
was no Beast of Burthen known among them;
that is to say, neither Horses or Mules or Asses,
Camels or Dromedaries; the only Creature they
had, was a kind of Buffloe, or tame Bull, such a
one as we had killed; and that some of these they
had brought so to their Hand, that they taught
them to go and come with their Voices, as they
called them to them, or sent them from them;
that they made them carry Burthens, and parti∣cularly,
that they would swim over Rivers
and Lakes upon them, the Creatures swimming
very high and strong in the Water.</P>
<P>But we understood nothing of the Manage∣ment
or Guiding such a Creature, or how to bind
a Burthen upon them; and this last Part of
our Consultation puzzled us extremely: At last
I proposed a Method for them, which after
some Consideration, they found very conveni∣ent;
and this was to quarrel with some of the
Negro Natives, take ten or twelve of them
Prisoners, and binding them as Slaves, cause
them to travel with us, and make them car∣ry
our Baggage; which I alledged would be
convenient and useful many ways, as well to
shew us the Way, as to converse with other
Natives for us.</P>
<P>This Counsel was not accepted at first, but
the Natives soon gave them Reason to approve
it; and also gave them an Opportunity to put
it in Practice; for as our little Traffick with
the Natives was hitherto upon the Faith of
their first Kindness, we found some Knavery
<PB N="68" REF="70"/>
among them at last; for having bought some
Cattel of them for our Toys, which, as I said,
our Cutler had contrived, one of our Men
differing with his Chapman, truly they huff'd
him in their Manner, and keeping the things
he had offered them for the Cattel, made their
Fellows drive away the Cattel before his
Face, and laugh at him; our Man crying out
loud of this Violence, and calling to some of us,
who were not far off, the Negro he was dealing
with threw a Lance at him, which came so
true, that if he had not with great Agility
jumped aside, and held up his Hand also to
turn the Lance as it came, it had struck through
his Body, and, as it was, it wounded him in
the Arm; at which the Man enraged took up
his Fuzee, and shot the Negro through the
Heart.</P>
<P>The others that were near him, and all those
that were with us at a Distance, were so ter∣ribly
frighted; first, at the Flash of Fire; se∣condly,
at the Noise: And thirdly, at see∣ing
their Countryman killed, that they stood
like Men stupid and amazed, at first, for some
time: But after they were a little recovered
from their Fright, one of them, at a good Di∣stance
from us, set up a sudden screaming Noise,
which, it seems, is the Noise they make when
they go to Fight; and all the rest understanding
what he meant, answered him, and run to∣gether
to the Place where he was, and we not
knowing what it meant, stood still looking upon
one another like a Parcel of Fools.</P>
<P>But we were presently undeceived, for in
two or three Minutes more we heard the scream∣ing
roaring Noise go on from one Place to a∣nother,
through all their little Towns; nay,
<PB N="69" REF="71"/>
even over the Creek to the other Side; and, on
a sudden we saw a naked Multitude running
from all Parts to the Place where the first Man
began it, as to a Rendezvous; and, in less than
an Hour, I believe there was near 500 of them
gotten together, armed some with Bows and
Arrows, but most with Lances, with which they
throw, at a good Distance, so nicely, that they
will strike a Bird flying.</P>
<P>We had but a very little time for Consultation,
for the Multitude was encreasing every Mo∣ment;
and I verily believe, if we had stay'd long,
they would have been 10000 together in a lit∣tle
time. We had nothing to do therefore, but
to fly to our Ship or Bark, where indeed we
could have defended our selves very well, or
to advance and try what a Volley or two of
small Shot would do for us.</P>
<P>We resolved immediately upon the latter, de∣pending
upon it, that the Fire and Terror of
our Shot would soon put them to Flight; so
we drew up all in a Line, and marched boldly
up to them; they stood ready to meet us, de∣pending,
I suppose, to destroy us all with their
Lances; but before we came near enough for
them to throw their Lances, we halted, and stand∣ing
at a good Distance from one another, to
stretch our Line as far as we could, we gave
them a Salute with our Shot, which besides what
we wounded that we knew not of, knocked
sixteen of them down upon the Spot, and
three more were so lamed, that they fell about
20 or 30 Yards from them.</P>
<P>As soon as we had fired, they set up the hor∣ridest
Yell, or Howling, partly raised by those
that were wounded, and partly by those that
<PB N="70" REF="72"/>
pitied and condoled the Bodies they saw lye
dead, that I never heard any thing like it be∣fore
or since.</P>
<P>We stood Stock still after we had fired, to
load our Guns again, and finding they did not
stir from the Place, we fired among them again;
we killed about nine of them at the second Fire;
but as they did not stand so thick as before, all
our Men did not fire, seven of us being or∣dered
to reserve our Charge, and to advance as
soon as the other had fired, while the rest loaded
again; of which I shall speak again presently.</P>
<P>As soon as we had fired the second Volley we
shouted as loud as we could, and the seven Men
advanced upon them, and, coming about 20 Yards
nearer, fired again, and those that were behind
having loaded again, with all Expedition, fol∣low'd
but when they saw us advance, they run
screaming away as if they were bewitched.</P>
<P>When we came up to the Field of Battle, we
saw a great Number of Bodies lying upon the
Ground, many more than we could suppose were
killed or wounded, nay more than we had Bul∣lets
in our Pieces when we fired; and we could
not tell what to make of it; but at length, we
found how it was <HI>viz.</HI> that they were frighted
out of all manner of Sense; nay, I do believe se∣veral
of those that were really dead, were frighted
to Death, and had no Wound about them.</P>
<P>Of those that were thus frighted, as I have said,
several of them, as they recovered themselves,
came and worshipped us (taking us for Gods
or Devils, I know not which, nor did it much
matter to us) some kneeling, some throwing
themselves flat on the Ground, made a Thousand
antick Gestures, but all with Tokens of the most
<PB N="71" REF="73"/>
profound Submission. It presently came into my
Head, that we might now by the Law of Arms
take as many Prisoners as we would, and make
them travel with us, and carry our Baggage:
As soon as I proposed it, our Men were all of my
Mind; and accordingly we secured about 60 lusty
young Fellows, and let them know they must
go with us; which they seemed very willing to
do: But the next Question we had among our
selves, was, how we should do to trust them, for
we found the People not like those of <HI>Madagasar,</HI>
but fierce, revengful and treacherous, for which
Reason we were sure, that we should have no
Service from them but that of meer Slaves, no
Subjection that would continue any longer than
the Fear of us was upon them, nor any Labour
but by Violence.</P>
<P>Before I go any farther, I must hint to the
Reader, that from this time forward I began to
enter a little more seriously into the Circum∣stance
I was in, and concern'd my self more in
the Conduct of our Affairs; for, tho' my Come∣rades
were all older Men, yet I began to find them
void of Counsel, or, as I now call it, Presence of
Mind, when, they came to the Execution of a
thing. The first Occasion I took to observe this,
was in their late Engagement with the Natives,
when, tho' they had taken a good Resolution to
attack them, and fire upon them, yet when
they had fired the first time, and found that the
Negroes did not run as they expected, their
Hearts began to fail, and I am perswaded if their
Bark had been near Hand, they would every
Man have run away.</P>
<P>Upon this Occasion, I began to take upon
me a little to hearten them up, and to call upon
<PB N="72" REF="74"/>
them to load again, and give them another Volley,
telling them that I would engage, if they would be
ruled by me, I'd make the Negroes run fast enough.
I found this heartned them, and therefore, when
they fired a second time, I desired them to re∣serve
some of their Shot to an Attempt by it
self, as I mentioned above.</P>
<P>Having fired a second time, I was indeed for∣ced
to command, as I may call it. Now, <HI>Seigniors,</HI>
said I, let us give them a Chear; so I open'd my
Throat, and shouted three times, as our <HI>English</HI>
Sailors do on like Occasions; and now follow me,
said I to the seven that had not fired, and <HI>I'll warrant
you we will make Work with them;</HI> and so it proved
indeed: For as soon as they saw us coming, away
they run as above.</P>
<P>From this Day forward they would call me no∣thing
but <HI>Seignior Capitanio;</HI> but I told them, I
would not be called <HI>Seignior.</HI> Well then, said
the Gunner, who spoke good <HI>English,</HI> you shall
be called Captain <HI>Bob,</HI> and so they gave me my
Title ever after.</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> than
this, take them nationally or personally; if
they are animated and hearten'd up by any body
to go before, and encourage them by Example,
they will behave well enough; but if they have
nothing but their own Measures to follow, they
sink immediately: These Men had certainly
fled from a Parcel of naked Savages, tho' even
by flying they could not have saved their Lives,
if I had not shouted and halloo'd, and made ra∣ther
Sport with the thing, than a Fight, to keep
up their Courage.</P>
<P>Nor was there less need of it upon several
Occasions hereafter; and I do confess, I have of∣ten
<PB N="73" REF="75"/>
wonder'd how a Number of Men, who, when
they came to the Extremity, were so ill suppor∣ted
by their own Spirits, had at first Courage
to propose, and to undertake the most desperate
and impracticable Attempt that ever Men went
about in the World.</P>
<P>There were indeed two or three indefatigable
Men among them, by whose Courage and Indu∣stry
all the rest were upheld; and indeed those
two or three were the Managers of them from the
Beginning; that was the Gunner, and that Cutler
whom I call the Artist; and the third, who was
pretty well, tho' not like either of them, was one
of the Carpenters. These indeed were the Life
and Soul of all the rest, and it was to their Cou∣rage
that all the rest ow'd the Resolution they
shewd upon any Occasion. But when those saw
me take a little upon me, as above, they em∣braced
me, and treated me with particular Af∣fection
ever after.</P>
<P>This Gunner was an excellent Mathematici∣an,
a good Scholar, and a compleat Sailor; and
it was in conversing intimately with him, that
I learnt afterwards the Grounds of what Know∣ledge
I have since had in all the Sciences useful
for Navigation, and particularly in the Geogra∣phical
Part of Knowledge.</P>
<P>Even in our Conversation, finding me eager
to understand and learn, he laid the Foundation of
a general Knowledge of things in my Mind, gave
me just Ideas of the Form of the Earth and of
the Sea, the Situation of Countries, the Course
of Rivers, the Doctrine of the Spheres, the Mo∣tion
of the Stars; and, in a Word, taught me a
kind of System of Astronomy, which I after∣wards
improv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="76"/>
In especial Manner, he filled my Head with
aspiring Thoughts, and with an earnest Desire
after learning every thing that could be taught
me; convincing me, that nothing could qualify
me for great Undertakings, but a Degree of
Learning superior to what was usual in the Race
of Seamen; he told me, that to be ignorant, was
to be certain of a mean Station in the World, but
that Knowledge was the first Step to Preferment.
He was always flattering me with my Capaci∣ty
to Learn; and tho' that fed my Pride, yet
on the other Hand, as I had a secret Ambition
which just at that time fed it self in my Mind,
it prompted in me an insatiable Thirst after
Learning in general, and I resolved, if ever I
came back to <HI>Europe,</HI> and had any thing left to
purchase it, I would make my self Master of all
the Parts of Learning needful to the making of
me a compleat Sailor; but I was not so just to my
self afterwards, as to do it when I had an Op∣portunity.</P>
<P>But to return to our Business; the Gunner,
when he saw the Service I had done in the Fight,
and heard my Proposal for keeping a Number
of Prisoners for our March, and for carrying
our Baggage, turns to me before them all, Cap∣tain
<HI>Bob, says he,</HI> I think you must be our Lea∣der,
for all the Success of this Enterprize is
owing to you. <HI>No, no, said I,</HI> do not compliment
me, you shall be our <HI>Seignior Capitanio,</HI> you shall
be <HI>General,</HI> I am too young for it; so in short,
we all agreed he should be our Leader; but he
would not accept of it alone, but would have
me join'd with him, and all the rest agreeing, I
was oblig'd to comply.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
The first Piece of Service they put me up∣on
in this new Command, was as difficult as
any they could think of, and that was to ma∣nage
the Prisoners; which however I chearfully
undertook, as you shall hear presently: But the
immediate Consultation was yet of more Conse∣quence;
and that was, <HI>First,</HI> Which Way we
should go, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> How to furnish our selves
for the Voyage with Provisions.</P>
<P>There was among the Prisoners one tall, well-shap'd,
handsom Fellow, to whom the rest seem'd
to pay great Respect, and who, as we understood
afterwards, was the Son of one their Kings, his
Father was, it seems, killed at our first Volley,
and he wounded with a Shot in his Arm, and
with another just on one of his Hips or Haun∣ches.
The Shot in his Haunch being in a fleshy
Part, bled much, and he was half dead with
the Loss of Blood. As to the Shot in his Arm,
it had broke his Wrist, and he was by both
these Wounds quite disabled, so that we were once
going to turn him away, and let him die; and
if we had, he would have died indeed in a few
Days more: But as I found the Man had some
Respect shew'd him, it presently occurred to my
Thoughts, that we might bring him to be useful
to us, and perhaps make him a kind of Com∣mander
over them. So I caused our Surgeon to
take him in Hand, and gave the poor Wretch
good Words, that is to say, I spoke to him as well
as I could by Signs, to make him understand that
we would make him well again.</P>
<P>This created a new Awe in their Minds of us,
believing that as we could kill at a Distance by
something invisible to them (for so our Shot was
to be sure) so we could make them well again
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
too. Upon this the young Prince (for so we
called him afterwards) called six or seven of the
Savages to him, and said something to them;
what it was we knew not, but immediately
all the seven came to me, and kneel'd down
to me, holding up their Hands, and making
Signs of Entreaty, pointing to the Place where
one of those lay whom we had killed.</P>
<P>It was a long time before I or any of us could
understand them; but one of them run and lifted
up a dead Man, pointing to his Wound, which
was in his Eye, for he was shot into the Head at
one of his Eyes. Then another pointed to the
Surgeon, and at last we found it out, that the
Meaning was, that he should heal the Prince's
Father too, who was dead, being shot thro' the
Head, as above.</P>
<P>We presently took the Hint, and would not
say we could not do it, but let them know, the
Men that were kill'd were those that had first
fallen upon us, and provoked us, and we would by
no Means make them alive again; and that if any
other did so, we would kill them too, and never
let them live any more: But that if he (the Prince)
would be willing to go with us, and do as we
should direct him, we would not let him dye, and
would make his Arm well. Upon this he bid his
Men go and fetch a long Stick or Staff, and lay
on the Ground. When they brought it, we saw
it was an Arrow; he took it with his left Hand,
(for his other was lame with the Wound) and
pointing up at the Sun, broke the Arrow in two,
and set the Point against his Breast, and then
gave it to me. This was as I understood after∣wards,
wishing the Sun, whom they worship,
might shoot him into the Breast with an Arrow,
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
if ever he failed to be my Friend; and giving
the Point of the Arrow to me, was to be a Testi∣mony,
that I was the Man he had sworn to; and
never was Christian more punctual to an Oath,
than he was to this, for he was a sworn Servant
to us for many a weary Month after that.</P>
<P>When I brought him to the Surgeon, he im∣mediately
dress'd the Wound in his Haunch or
Bottock, and found the Bullet had only graz'd
upon the Flesh, and pass'd, as it were, by it,
but it was not lodg'd in the Part; so that it was
soon healed and well again: But as to his Arm,
he found one of the Bones broken, which are in
the Fore-part from the Wrist to the Elbow; and
this he set, and splinter'd it up, and bound his
Arm in a Sling, hanging it about his Neck, and
making Signs to him that he should not stir it;
which he was so strict an Observer of, that he set
him down, and never mov'd one Way or other,
but as the Surgeon gave him Leave.</P>
<P>I took a great deal of Pains to acquaint this
Negroe what we intended to do, and what Use
we intended to make of his Men; and particu∣larly,
to teach him the Meaning of what we said:
Especially to teach him some Words, such as <HI>Yes</HI>
and <HI>No,</HI> and what they meant, and to innure him
to our Way of Talking, and he was very willing
and apt to learn any thing I taught him.</P>
<P>It was easy to let him see, that we intended
to carry our Provision with us from the first Day;
but he made Signs to us to tell us we need not,
for that we should find Provisions enough every
where for fourty Days. It was very difficult for
us to understand how he express'd Forty; for he
knew no Figures, but some Words they used to
one another that they understood it by. At last,
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
one of the Negroes, by his Order, said fourty
little Stones one by another, to shew us how
many Days we should travel, and find Provisions
sufficient.</P>
<P>Then I shew'd him our Baggage, which was
very heavy, particularly our Powder and Shot,
Lead, Iron, Carpenters Tools, Seamens Instru∣ments,
Cases of Bottles, and other Lumber. He
took some of the things up in his Hand to see
the Weight, and shook his Head at them; so I
told our People, they must resolve to divide their
Things into small Parcels, and make them porta∣ble;
and accordingly they did so, by which means
we were fain to leave all our Chests behind us,
which were Eleven in Number.</P>
<P>Then he made Signs to us, that he would pro∣cure
some Buffloes, or young Bulls, <HI>as I called
them,</HI> to carry things for us, and made Signs too,
that if we were weary, we might be carry'd too;
but that we slighted, only were willing to have
the Creatures, because at last, when they could
serve us no farther for Carriage, we might eat
them all up if we had any Occasion for them.</P>
<P>I then carry'd him to our Bark, and shewed
him what things we had there; he seem'd
amaz'd at the Sight of our Bark, having never
seen any thing of that Kind before, for their Boats
are most wretched things, such as I never saw be∣fore,
having no Head or Stern, and being made
only of the Skins of Goats sewed together with
dried Guts of Goats and Sheep, and done over
with a kind of slimy Stuff like Rosin and Oil,
but of a most nauseous, odious Smell, and they
are poor miserable things for Boats, the worst
that any Part of the World ever saw; a Canoe is
an excellent Contrivance compared to them.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81"/>
But to return to our Boat: We carried our
new Prince into it, and help'd him over the Side,
because of his Lameness. We made Signs to him,
that his Men must carry our Goods for us, and
shewed him what we had; he answer'd, <HI>Ce Seignior,</HI>
or, <HI>Yes Sir,</HI> (for we had taught him that Word,
and the Meaning of it) and taking up a Bundle,
he made Signs to us, that when his Arm was well,
he would carry some for us.</P>
<P>I made Signs again, to tell him, that if he
would make his Men carry them, we would not
let him carry any thing. We had secured all the
Prisoners in a narrow Place, where we had bound
them with Matt Cords, and set up Stakes like
a Palisado round them; so when we carry'd the
Prince on Shore, we went with him to them, and
made Signs to him, to ask them if they were wil∣ling
to go with us to the Country of Lions. Ac∣cordingly
he made a long Speech to them, and
we could understand by it, that he told them, if
they were willing, they must say, <HI>Ce Seignior,</HI> tel∣ling
them what it signify'd. They immediately
answered, <HI>Ce Seignior,</HI> and clapt their Hands,
looking up to the Sun, which the Prince signi∣fy'd
to us, was Swearing to be faithful. But
as soon as they had said so, one of them made a
long Speech to the Prince, and in it, we percei∣ved
by his Gestures, which were very antick, that
they desired something from us, and that they
were in great Concern about it. So I ask'd him
as well as I could, what it was they desired of us;
he told us by Signs, that they desired we should
clap our Hands to the Sun (that was to swear)
that we would not kill them, that we would
give them <HI>Chiaruck,</HI> that is to say, Bread, would
not starve them, and would not let the Lions eat
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
them. I told him we would promise all that;
then he pointed to the Sun, and clapt his
Hands, signing to me, that I should do so too,
which I did; at which all the Prisoners fell flat
on the Ground, and rising up again, made the
oddest, wildest Cries that ever I heard.</P>
<P>I think it was the first time in my Life that
ever any religious Thought affected me; but
I could not refrain some Reflections, and almost
Tears, in considering how happy it was, that
I was not born among such Creatures as these,
and was not so stupidly ignorant and barbarous:
But this soon went off again, and I was not
troubled again with any Qualms of that Sort
for a long time after.</P>
<P>When this Ceremony was over, our Concern
was to get some Provisions, as well for the pre∣sent
Subsistence of our Prisoners, as our selves;
and making Signs to our Prince, that we were
thinking upon that Subject, he made Signs to
me, that if I would let one of the Prisoners go
to his Town, he should bring Provisions, and
should bring some Beasts to carry our Baggage.
I seemed loath to trust him, and supposing that
he would run away, he made great Signs of Fi∣delity,
and with his own Hands tied a Rope
about his Neck, offering me one End of it, inti∣mating,
that I should hang him, if the Man did
not come again. So I consented, and he gave him
Abundance of Instructions, and sent him away,
pointing to the Light of the Sun, which it seems
was to tell him, at what time he must be back.</P>
<P>The Fellow run as if he was mad, and held
it till he was quite out of Sight, by which I
supposed he had a great Way to go. The next
Morning, about two Hours before the Time
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
appointed, the Black Prince, for so I always
called him, beckoning with his Hand to me,
and hollooing after his Manner, desired me to
come to him, which I did, when pointing to a little
Hill about two Miles off, I saw plainly a little
Drove of Cattel, and several People with them;
those he told me by Signs were the Man he had
sent, and several more with him, and Cattel for us.</P>
<P>Accordingly by the time appointed, he came
quite to our Hutts, and brought with him a great
many Cowys, oung Runts, about 16 Goats, and, four
young Bulls, taught to carry Burthens.</P>
<P>This was a Supply of Provisions sufficient; as
for Bread we were obliged to shift with some
Roots which we had made use of before. We
then began to consider of making some large
Bags like the Soldiers Knapsacks, for their Men
to carry our Baggage in, and to make it easy
to them; and the Goats being killed, I ordered
the Skins to be spread in the Sun, and they
were as dry in two Days as could be desired; so
we found means to make such little Bags as we
wanted, and began to divide our Baggage into
them: When the Black Prince found what
they were for, and how easy they were of Car∣riage
when we put them on, he smiled a lit∣tle,
and sent away the Man again to fetch
Skins, and he brought two Natives more
with him, all loaded with Skins better cured
than ours, and of other kinds, such as we could
not tell what Names to give them.</P>
<P>These two Men brought the Black Prince two
Lances of the sort they use in their Fights, but
finer than ordinary, being made of black smooth
Wood, as fine as Ebony, and headed at the Point
with the End of a long Tooth of some Creature,
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
we could not tell of what Creature; the Head
was so firm put on, and the Tooth so strong,
tho' no bigger than my Thumb, and sharp at
the End, that I never saw any thing like it
in any Place in the World.</P>
<P>The Prince would not take them till I gave
him Leave, but made Signs that they should
give them to me; however I gave him Leave
to take them himself, for I saw evident Signs of
an honourable just Principle in him.</P>
<P>We now prepared for our March, when
the Prince coming to me, and pointing to∣wards
the several Quarters of the World, made
Signs to know, which way we intended to go;
and when I shewed him pointing to the West,
he presently let me know, there was a great
River a little further to the North, which was
able to carry our Bark many Leagues into the
Country due West. I presently took the Hint,
and enquired for the Mouth of the River, which
I understood by him was above a Day's March,
and by our Estimation we found it about seven
Leagues further; I take this to be the great
River marked by our Chart-Makers at the
Northmost Part of the Coast of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> and
called there <HI>Quilloa.</HI></P>
<P>Consulting thus with our selves, we resolved
to take the Prince, and as many of the Prisoners
as we could stow in our Frigate, and go about
by the Bay into the River; and that eight of us
with our Arms should march by Land, to meet
them on the River-side; for the Prince carrying
us to a rising Ground, had shew'd us the River
very plain a great Way up the Country,
and in one Place it was not above six Miles
to it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85"/>
It was my Lot to march by Land, and be
Captain of the whole Carravan: I had eight of
our own Men with me, and Seven and Thirty
of our Prisoners, without any Baggage, for all
our Luggage was yet on board. We drove the
young Bulls with us; nothing was ever so
tame, so willing to work, or carry any thing.
The Negroes would ride upon them four at a
Time, and they would go very willingly; they
would eat out of our Hand, lick our Feet, and
were as tractable as a Dog.</P>
<P>We drove with us six or seven Cows for
Food; but our Negroes knew nothing of curing
the Flesh by salting and drying it, till we
shew'd them the Way, and then they were
mighty willing to do so as long as we had any
Salt to do it with, and to carry Salt a great
Way too, after we found we should have no more.</P>
<P>It was an easy March to the River Side for us
that went by Land, and we came thither in a
Piece of a Day, being as above not above six <HI>English</HI>
Miles; whereas it was no less than five Days
before they came to us by Water, the Wind in
the Bay having failed them, and the Way, by
Reason of a great Turn or Reach in the River
being above fifty Miles about.</P>
<P>We spent this time in a thing which the
two Strangers, which brought the Prince the
two Lances, put into the Head of the Prisoners;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) to make Bottles of the Goats-Skins to carry
fresh Water in, which it seems they knew we
should come to want; and the Men, did it so dex∣terously,
having dried Skins fetched them by
those two Men, that before our Vessel came up,
they had every Man a Pouch like a Bladder, to
carry fresh Water in, hanging over their Shoulder
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
by a Thong made of other Skins, about three In∣ches
broad, like the Sling of a Fuzee.</P>
<P>Our Prince, to assure us of the Fidelity of the
Men in this March, had ordered them to be
tied two and two by the Wrist, as we handcuff
Prisoners in <HI>England;</HI> and made them so sensible
of the Reasonableness of it, that he made them
do it themselves, appointing four of them, to
bind the rest; but we found them so honest, and par∣ticularly
so obedient to him, that after we were
gotten a little further off of their own Country,
we set them all at Liberty, tho' when he came
to us, he would have them tied again, and they
continued so for a good while.</P>
<P>All the Country on the Bank of the River was
a high Land, no marshy swampy Ground in it,
the Verdure good, and Abundance of Cattel feed∣ing
upon it, wherever we went, or which
Way soever we look'd; there was not much
Wood indeed, at least not near us, but further up
we saw Oak, Cedar, and Pine Trees, some of which
were very large.</P>
<P>The River was a fair open Channel about as
broad as the <HI>Thames</HI> below <HI>Gravesend,</HI> and a
strong Tide of Flood, which we found held us
about 60 Miles, the Channel deep; nor did we
find any Want of Water for a great Way. In
short, we went merrily up the River with the
Flood, and the Wind blowing still fresh at E. and
E. N. E, we stemm'd the Ebb easily also, especially
while the River continued broad and deep; but
when we came past the Swelling of the Tide,
and had the natural Current of the River to go
against, we found it too strong for us, and began
to think of quitting our Bark; but the Prince
would by no means agree to that, for finding we
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
had on board pretty good Store of Roping made
of Matts and Flags, which I described before,
he ordered all the Prisoners which were on shore,
to come and take hold of those Ropes, and tow
us along by the Shore Side; and as we hoisted
our Sail too, to ease them, the Men run along
with us at a very great Rate.</P>
<P>In this Manner the River carry'd us up by our
Computation near 200 Miles, and then it narrow∣ed
apace, and was not above as broad as the <HI>Thames</HI>
is at <HI>Windsor,</HI> or thereabouts; and after another
Day, we came to a great Water-fall or Cataract,
enough to fright us, for I believe the whole
Body of Water fell at once perpendicularly down
a Precipice, above sixty Foot high, which made
a Noise enough to deprive men of their Hearing,
and we heard it above Ten Miles before we came
to it.</P>
<P>Here we were at a full Stop, and now our Priso∣ners
went first on Shore; they had worked very
hard, and very chearfully, relieving one another,
those that were weary being taken into the Bark.
Had we had Canoes, or any Boats which might
have been carried by Mens Strength, we might
have gone 200 Miles more up this River in small
Boats, but our great Boat could go no farther.</P>
<P>All this Way the Country looked green and
pleasant, and was full of Cattel, and some Peo∣ple
we saw, tho' not many; but this we observ'd
now, that the People did no more understand our
Prisoners here, than we could understand them;
being it seems of different Nations, and of diffe∣rent
Speech. We had yet seen no wild Beasts, or at
least none that came very near us; except two
Days before we came at the Water-fall, when we
saw three of the most beautiful Leopards that ever
<PB N="86" REF="88"/>
were seen, standing upon the Bank of the River
on the North-side, our Prisoners being all on the
other Side of the Water. Our Gunner espy'd
them first, and ran to fetch his Gun, putting a
Ball extraordinary in it; and coming to me,
now Captain <HI>Bob,</HI> says he, where's your Prince,
so I called him out, now, says he, tell your
Men not to be afraid, tell them they shall see
that Thing in his Hand, speak in Fire to one
of those Beasts, and make it kill it self.</P>
<P>The poor Negroes looked as if they had
been all going to be killed, notwithstanding
what their Prince said to them, and stood sta∣ring
to expect the Issue, when on a sudden the
Gunner fired; and as he was a very good Marks-Man,
he shot the Creature with two Sluggs just
in the Head. As soon as the Leopard felt her
self struck, she rear'd up on her two hind Legs
bolt upright, and throwing her Fore-Paws about
in the Air, fell backward, growling and strug∣gling,
and immediately died; the other two
frighted with the Fire and the Noise, fled, and
were out of Sight in an Instant.</P>
<P>But the two frighted Leopards were not in
half the Consternation that our Prisoners were;
four or five of them fell down as if they had
been shot, several others fell on their Knees, and
lifted up their Hands to us; whether to wor∣ship
us, or pray us not to kill them, we did
not know; but we made Signs to their Prince
to encourage them, which he did, but it was
with much ado that he brought them to their
Sense; nay, the Prince, notwithstanding all that
was said to prepare him for it, yet when the
Piece went off, he gave a Start as if he would
have leap'd into the River.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="89"/>
When we saw the Creature killed, I had a
great Mind to have the Skin of her, and made
Signs to the Prince, that he should send some
of his Men over to take the Skin off. As soon
as he spoke but a Word, four of them that
offered themselves were untied, and immediately
they jump'd into the River, and swam over,
and went to work with him: The Prince ha∣ving
a Knife that we gave him, made four wood∣en
Knives so clever, as I never saw any thing
like them in my Life, and in less than an Hour's
time, they brought me the Skin of the Leopard,
which was a monstrous great one, for it was
from the Ears to the Tail about seven Foot,
and near five Foot Broad on the Back, and most
admirably spotted all over; the Skin of this
Leopard I brought to <HI>London</HI> many Years after.</P>
<P>We were now all upon a Level, as to our
travelling; being unshipp'd, for our Bark would
swim no farther, and she was too heavy to carry
on our Backs; but as we found the Course of the
River went a great Way farther, we consulted
our Carpenters, whether we could not pull the
Bark in Pieces, and make us three or four small
Boats to go on with. They told us, we might do
so, but it would be very long a-doing; and, that
when we had done, we had neither Pitch or
Tar to make them sound, to keep the Water
out, or Nails to fasten the Plank; but one of
them toldus, that as soon as he could come at any
large Tree, near the River he would make us a
Canoe or two in a Quarter of the Time, and
which would serve us as well for all the Uses we
could have any Occasion for as a Boat; and
such, that if we came to any Water-falls, we
might take them up, and carry them for a Mile
or two by Land, upon our Shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="90"/>
Upon this we gave over the Thoughts of our
Frigate, and hauling her into a little Cove, or
Inlet, where a small Brook came into the main
River, we laid her up for those that came next,
and marched forward. We spent indeed two
Days dividing our Baggage, and loading our
tame Buffloes and our Negroes: Our Pow∣der
and Shot, which was the thing we were
most careful of, we ordered thus: First the Powder
we divided into little Leather Bags, that is
to say, Bags of dried Skins with the Hair in∣ward,
that the Powder might not grow damp;
and then we put those Bags into other Bags
made of Bullocks Skins, very thick and hard,
with the Hair outward, that no Wet might come
in; and this succeeded so well, that in the
greatest Rains we had, whereof some were very
violent and very long, we always kept our Pow∣der
dry. Besides these Bags which held our
chief Magazine, we divided to every one a
Quarter of a Pound of Powder, and Half a Pound
of Shot to carry always about us; which as it
was enough for our present Use, so we were
willing to have no Weight to carry more than
was absolutely necessary, because of the Heat.</P>
<P>We kept still on the Bank of the River, and
for that Reason had very little Communication
with the People of the Country; for, having also
our Bark stored with Plenty of Provisions, we
had had no Occasion to look abroad for a Sup∣ply;
but now we came to march on Foot, we
were obliged often to seek out for Food. The
first Place we came to on the River that gave us
any Stop, was a little Negro Town, contain∣ing
about 50 Hutts, and there appeared about
400 People, for they all came out to see us,
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
and wonder at us. When our Negroes appea∣peared,
the Inhabitants began to fly to Arms,
thinking there had been Enemies coming upon
them; but our Negroes, tho' they could not
speak their Language, made Signs to them, that
they had no Weapons, and were tied two and two
together, as Captives; that there were People
behind who came from the Sun, and that could
kill them all, and make them alive again, if they
pleased; but that they would do them no Hurt,
and came with Peace. As soon as they understood
this, they laid down their Lances, and Bows and
Arrows, and came and struck twelve large Stakes
in the Ground, as a Token of Peace, bowing
themselves to us in Token of Submission. But as
soon as they saw white Men with Beards, that
is to say, Mustachoes, they run screaming away
as in a Fright.</P>
<P>We kept at a Distance from them, not to be
too familiar; and when we did appear, it was
but two or three of us at a time. But our Priso∣ners
made them understand, that we required
some Provisions of them; so they brought us
some black Cattel, for they have Abundance of
Cows and Buffloes all over that Side of the
Country, as also great Numbers of Deer. Our
Cutler, who had now a great Stock of things of
his Handy-work, gave them some little Knick
Knacks, as Plates of Silver and of Iron, cut Dia∣mond
Fashion, and cut into Hearts and into Rings,
and they were mightily pleased. They also
brought several Sorts of Fruits and Roots, which
we did not understand, but our Negroes sed hear∣tily
on them, and after we had seen them eat
them, we did so too.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="92"/>
Having stock'd our selves here with Flesh and
Roots as much as we could well carry, we divi∣ded
the Burthens among our Negroes, appointing
about 30 to 40 Pound Weight to a Man, which
we thought indeed was Load enough in a hot
Country; and the Negroes did not at all repine
at it, but would sometimes help one another
when they began to be weary, which did happen
now and then, tho' not often: Besides, as most of
their Luggage was our Provision, it lighten'd eve∣ry
Day like <HI>Aexsop</HI>'s Basket of Bread, till we came
to get a Recruit. Note, when we loaded them,
we untied their Hands, and tied them two and
two together by one Foot. The third Day of our
March from this Place, our chief Carpenter desi∣red
us to halt, and set up some Hutts, for he
had found out some Trees that he liked, and
resolved to make us some Canoes; for as he told
me, he knew we should have Marching enough on
Foot after we left the River, and he was resolved
to go no farther by Land than needs must.</P>
<P>We had no sooner given Order for our little
Camp, and given Leave to our Negroes to lay
down their Loads, but they fell to Work to build
our Hutts; and tho' they were tied, as above,
yet they did it so nimbly, as surprized us. Here
we set some of the Negroes quite at Liberty,
that is to say, without tying them, having the
Prince's Word pass'd for their Fidelity; and some
of these were ordered to help the Carpenters,
which they did very handily, with a little Di∣rection,
and others were sent to see whether they
could get any Provision near Hand; but instead
of Provisions, three of them came in with two
Bows and Arrows, and five Lances. They could
not easily make us understand how they came by
<PB N="91" REF="93"/>
them, only that they had surprized some Negroe
Women, who were in some Hutts, the Men be∣ing
from Home, and they had found the Lances
and Bows in the Hutts or Houses, the Women
and Children flying away at the Sight of them,
as from Robbers. We seem'd very angry at them,
and made the Prince ask them, if they had not
kill'd any of the Women or Children, making
them believe, that if they had kill'd any Body,
we would make them kill themselves too; but
they protested their Innocence, so we excused
them. Then they brought us the Bows and Ar∣rows
and Lances; but at a Motion of their black
Prince, we gave them back the Bows and Arrows,
and gave them Leave to go out to see what they
could kill for Food; and here we gave them the
Law of Arms, <HI>viz.</HI> That if any Men appeared to
assault them, or shoot at them, or offer any Vio∣lence
to them, they might kill them; but that
they should not offer to kill or hurt any that
offer'd them Peace, or laid down their Weapons,
nor any Women or Children, upon any Occasion
whatsoever. These were our Articles of War.</P>
<P>These two Fellows had not been gone out above
three or four Hours, but one of them came run∣ning
to us without his Bow and Arrows, hallooing
and hooping a great while before he came at us,
<HI>Okoamo, Okoamo,</HI> which it seems was, <HI>Help, Help.</HI>
The rest of the Negroes rose up in a Hurry,
and by Two's, as they could, run forward toward
their Fellows to know what the Matter was. As
for me, I did not understand it, nor any of our
People; the Prince look'd as if something unlucky
had fallen out, and some of our Men took up
their Arms, to be ready on Occasion. But the
Negroes soon discover'd the Thing; for we saw
<PB N="92" REF="94"/>
four of them presently after coming along with a
great Load of Meat upon their Backs. The Case
was, that the first two who went out with their
Bows and Arrows, meeting with a great Herd
of Deer in the Plain, had been so nimble as to
shoot three of them; and then one of them came
running to us for Help, to fetch them away.
This was the first Venison we had met with up∣on
all our March, and we feasted upon it very
plentifully; and this was the first time we be∣gan
to prevail with our Prince to eat his Meat
drest our Way; after which, his Men were pre∣vailed
with by his Example, but before that, they
eat most of the Flesh they had quite raw.</P>
<P>We wish'd now we had brought some Bows and
Arrows out with us, which we might have done;
and we began to have so much Confidence in
our Negroes, and to be so familiar with them,
that we oftentimes let them go, or the greatest
Part of them, unty'd, being well assured they
would not leave us, and that they did not know
what Course to take without us; but one thing
we resolved not to trust them with, and that was
the Charging our Guns; but they always believed
our Guns had some heavenly Power in them, that
they would send forth Fire and Smoke, and speak
with a dreadful Noise, and kill at a Distance
whenever we bid them.</P>
<P>In about eight Days we finished three Ca∣noes,
and in them we embarked our white Men
and our Baggage, with our Prince, and some of
the Prisoners. We also found it needful to keep
some of our selves always on Shore, not only
to manage the Negroes, but to defend them from
Enemies and wild Beasts. Abundance of little
Incidents happened upon this March, which it is
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
not possible to crowd into this Account; parti∣cularly,
we saw more wild Beasts now than we
did before, some Elephants, and two or three
Lions; none of which Kinds we had seen any of
before; and we found our Negroes were more
afraid of them a great deal than we were; prin∣cipally
because they had no Bows and Arrows,
or Lances, which were the particular Weapons
they were bred up to the Exercise of.</P>
<P>But we cured them of their Fears, by being
always ready with our Fire-Arms. However, as
we were willing to be sparing of our Powder,
and the Killing any of the Creatures now was no
Advantage to us, seeing their Skins were too hea∣vy
for us to carry, and their Flesh not good to
eat, we resolved therefore to keep some of our
Pieces uncharg'd, and only prim'd, and causing
them to flash in the Pan, the Beasts, even the
Lions themselves, would always start, and fly
back when they saw it, and immediately march off.</P>
<P>We past Abundance of Inhabitants upon this
upper Part of the River, and with this Observa∣tion,
that almost every ten Miles we came to,
a several Nation, and every several Nation had
a different Speech, or else their Speech had dif∣fering
Dialects, so that they did not understand
one another. They all abounded in Cattel, espe∣cially
on the River Side; and the eighth Day of
this second Navigation, we met with a little Ne∣groe
Town, where they had growing a Sort of
Corn like Rice, which eat very sweet; and as we
got some of it of the People, we made very good
Cakes of Bread of it, and making a Fire, bak'd
them on the Ground, after the Fire was swept
away very well; so that hitherto we had no
Want of Provisions of any kind we could desire.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="96"/>
Our Negroes towing our Canoes, we travel∣led
at a considerable Rate, and by our own Ac∣count,
could not go less than 20 or 25 <HI>English</HI>
Miles a Day, and the River continuing to be much
at the same Breadth, and very deep all the Way,
till on the tenth Day we came to another Ca∣taract;
for a Ridge of high Hills crossing the whole
Channel of the River, the Water came tumbling
down the Rocks from one Stage to another in
a strange Manner: So that it was a continued
Link of Cataracts from one to another, in the
Manner of a Caskade; only, that the Falls were
sometimes a Quarter of a Mile from one another,
and the Noise confused and frightful.</P>
<P>We thought our Voyaging was at a full Stop
now; but three of us, with a Couple of our
Negroes, mounting the Hills another Way, to
view the Course of the River, we found a fair
Channel again after about half a Mile's March, and
that it was like to hold us a good Way farther.
So we set all Hands to Work, unloaded our Car∣go,
and hauled our Canoes on Shore, to see if
we could carry them.</P>
<P>Upon Examination, we found that they were
very heavy; but our Carpenters spending but
one Day's Work one them, hew'd away so much
of the Timber from their Outsides, as reduced
them very much, and yet they were as fit to
swim as before. When this was done, ten Men
with Poles took up one of the Canoes, and made
nothing to carry it. So we ordered twenty Men
to each Canoe, that one Ten might relieve an∣other;
and thus we carried all our Canoes, and
launch'd them into the Water again, and then
fetch'd our Luggage, and loaded it all again
into the Canoes, and all in an Afternoon; and
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
the next Morning early we mov'd forward a∣gain.
When we had towed about four Days
more, our Gunner, who was our Pilot, begun to
observe that we did not keep our right Course so
exactly as we ought, the River winding away a
little towards the North, and gave us Notice
of it accordingly. However, we were not wil∣ling
to lose the Advantage of Water-Carriage, at
least not till we were forced to it; so we jogg'd on,
and the River served us about Threescore Miles
further; but then we found it grew very small
and shallow, having pass'd the Mouths of seve∣ral
little Brooks or Rivulets which come into it,
and at Length it became but a Brook it self.</P>
<P>We tow'd up as far as ever our Boats would
swim, and we went two Days the further, ha∣ving
been about twelve Days in this last Part
of the River, by Lightning the Boats, and taking
our Luggage out, which we made the Negroes
carry, being willing to ease our selves as long
as we could; but at the End of these two Days,
in short, there was not Water enough to swim
a <HI>London</HI> Wherry.</P>
<P>We now set forward wholly by Land, and
without any Expectation of more Water Carri∣age.
All our Concern for more Water, was to
be sure to have a Supply for our Drinking; and
therefore upon every Hill that we came near,
we clamber'd up to the highest Part, to see the
Country before us, and to make the best Judg∣ment
we could which way to go to keep the low∣est
Grounds, and as near some Stream of Water
as we could.</P>
<P>The Country held verdant, well grown with
Trees, and spread with Rivers and Brooks, and
tolerably well with Inhabitants, for about thirty
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
Days March. After our leaving the Canoes, du∣ring
which time things went pretty well with
us; we did not tye our selves down when to
march, and when to halt, but order'd those
things as our Convenience, and the Health and
Ease of our People, as well our Servants, as our
selves, required.</P>
<P>About the Middle of this March, we came
into a low and plain Country, in which we per∣ceived
a greater Number of Inhabitants than in
any other Country we had gone thro'; but that
which was worse for us, we found them a fierce,
barbarous, treacherous People, and who at first
look'd upon us as Robbers, and gathered them∣selves
in Numbers to attack us.</P>
<P>Our Men were terrified at them at first, and
began to discover an unusual Fear; and even our
black Prince seemed in a great deal of Confusion:
But I smiled at him, and shewing him some of our
Guns, I asked him, if he thought that which
killed the spotted Cat, (for so they called the
Leopard in their Language) could not make a
Thousand of those naked Creatures die at one
Blow? Then he laugh'd, and said Yes, he believ'd
it would. Well then, said I, tell your Men not
to be afraid of these People, for we shall soon
give them a Taste of what we can do, if they
pretend to meddle with us. However, we con∣sidered
we were in the Middle of a vast Coun∣try,
and we knew not what Numbers of Peo∣ple
and Nations we might be surrounded with;
and above all, we knew not how much we
might stand in Need of the Friendship of these
that we were now among; so that we ordered the
Negroes to try all the Methods they could, to
make them Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="99"/>
Accordingly, the two Men who had gotten
Bows and Arrows, and two more to whom we
gave the Prince's two fine Lances, went foremost
with five more having long Poles in their Hands;
and after them ten of our Men advanced toward
the Negro Town that was next to us, and we
all stood ready to succour them if there should
be Occasion.</P>
<P>When they came pretty near their Houses,
our Negroes halloo'd in their screaming Way, and
called to them as loud as they could; upon their
calling, some of the Men came out, and answer'd,
and immediately after the whole Town, Men
Women and Children appeared: Our Negroes
with their long Poles went forward a little, and
stuck them all in the Ground, and left them,
which in their Country was a Signal of Peace, but
the other did not understand the Meaning of
that. Then the two Men with Bows, laid down
their Bows and Arrows, went forward unarmed,
and made Signs of Peace to them, which at
last the other began to understand; so two of
their Men laid down their Bows and Arrows,
and came towards them: Our Men made all the
Signs of Friendship to them that they could
think of, putting their Hands up to their
Mouths, as a Sign that they wanted Provisions to
eat, and the other pretended to be pleased and
friendly, and went back to their Fellows, and
talk'd with them a while, and they came forward
again, and made Signs that they would bring
some Provisions to them before the Sun set; and
so our Men came back again very well satisfied
for that time.</P>
<P>But an Hour before Sun-set our Men went to
them again, just in the same Posture as before,
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
and they came according to their Appointment,
and brought Deers Flesh, Roots, and the same
kind of Corn like Rice, <HI>which I mentioned above,</HI>
and our Negroes being furnish'd with such Toys
as our Cutler had contrived, gave them some of
them, which they seem'd infinitely pleas'd with,
and promis'd to bring more Provisions the next
Day.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Day they came again,
but our Men perceived they were more in Num∣ber
by a great many than before; however, ha∣ving
sent out ten Men with Fire-Arms to stand
ready, and our whole Army being in View also,
we were not much surprized; nor was the
Treachery of the Enemy so cunningly ordered
as in other Cases; for they might have sur∣rounded
our Negroes, which, were but nine,
under a Shew of Peace; but when they saw our
Men advance almost as far as the Place where
they were the Day before, the Rogues snatch'd
up their Bows and Arrows, and come running
upon our Men like so many Furies, at which
our ten Men called to the Negroes to come back
to them, which they did with Speed enough at
the first Word, and stood all behind our Men.
As they fled, the other advanced, and let fly
near a 100 of their Arrows at them, by which
two of our Negroes were wounded, and one we
thought had been killed. When they came to
the five Poles that our Men had struck in the
Ground, they stood still a while, and gathering
about the Poles, looked at them, and handled
them as wondering at what they meant. We
then who were drawn up behind all, sent one of
our Number to our ten Men, to bid them fire
among them, while they stood so thick, and to
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
put some small Shot into their Guns, besides
the ordinary Charge, and to tell them, that we
would be up with them immediately.</P>
<P>Accordingly they made ready, but by that
time they were ready to fire, the Black Army
had left their wondering about the Poles, and
began to stir as if they would come on, tho' see∣ing
more Men stand at some Distance behind
our Negroes, they could not tell what to make of
us; butif they did not understand us before, they
understood us less afterwards, for as soon as ever
our Men found them begin to move forward,
they fired among the thickest of them, being
about the Distance of 120 Yards, as near as we
could guess.</P>
<P>It is impossible to express the Fright, the
Screaming and Yelling of those Wretches upon
this first Volley; we killed six of them, and woun∣ded
11 or 12, I mean as we knew of; for, as they
stood thick, and the small Shot, as we called it,
scattered among them, we had Reason to believe
we wounded more that stood farther off; for our
small Shot was made of Bits of Lead, and Bits
of Iron, Heads of Nails, and such things as
our diligent Artificer the Cutler help'd us to.</P>
<P>As to those that were killed and wounded, the
other frighted Creatures were under the greatest
Amazement in the World, to think what should
hurt them; for they could see nothing but
Holes made in their Bodies they knew not how.
Then the Fire and the Noise amazed all their
Women and Children, and frighted them out of
their Wits, that they ran staring and howling
about like mad Creatures.</P>
<P>However, all this did not make them fly,
which was what we wanted; nor did we find
<PB N="100" REF="102"/>
any of them die as it were with Fear, as at first,
so we resolved upon a second Volley, and then
to advance as we did before. Whereupon our
reserved Men advancing, we resolved to fire
only three Men at a time, and move forward
like an Army firing in Platoons; so being all in
Line we fired first three on the Right, then
three on the Left, and so on; and every time we
killed or wounded some of them; but still they
did not fly, and yet they were so frighted, that
they used none of their Bows and Arrows, or
of their Lances; and we thought their Numbers
encreased upon our Hands; particularly we
thought so by the Noise; so I called to our Men
to halt, and bid them pour in one whole Volley,
and then shout, as we did in our first Fight, and
so run in upon them, and knock them down
with our Musquets.</P>
<P>But they were too wise for that too, for as soon
as we had fired a whole Volley, and shouted,
they all run away, Men, Women, and Children,
so fast, that in a few Moments we could not see
one Creature of them, except some that were
wounded and lame, who lay wallowing and
screaming here and there upon the Ground, as
they happen'd to fall.</P>
<P>Upon this we came up to the Field of Battle,
where we found we had killed 37 of them, among
which were three Women, and had wounded
about 64 among which were two Women; by
wounded I mean, such as were so maimed, as not
to be able to go away, and those our Negroes
killed afterwards in a cowardly manner in cold
Blood, for which we were very angry, and
threatned to make them go to them if they did
so again.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="103"/>
There was no great Spoil to be got, for they
were all stark naked as they came into the
World, Men and Women together; some of
them having Feathers stuck in their Hair, and
others a kind of Bracelets about their Necks, but
nothing else; but our Negroes got a Booty
here which we were very glad of, and this was
the Bows and Arrows of the vanquished, of
which they found more than they knew what
to do with, belonging to the killed and woun∣ded
Men; these we ordered them to pick up, and
they were very useful to us afterwards. After
the Fight, and our Negroes had gotten Bows
and Arrows, we sent them out in Parties to see
what they could get, and they got some Pro∣visions;
but, which was better than all the rest,
they brought us four more young Bulls, or Buf∣floes,
that had been brought up to Labour, and
to carry Burthens: They knew them, it seems,
by the Burthens they had carry'd having galled
their Backs; for, they have no Saddles to cover
them with in that Country.</P>
<P>Those Creatures not only eased our Negroes,
but gave us an Opportunity to carry more Pro∣visions,
and our Negroes loaded them very hard
at this Place, with Flesh and Roots, such as
we wanted very much afterwards.</P>
<P>In this Town we found a very little young Leo∣pard,
about two Spans high; it was exceeding
tame, and purr'd like a Cat when we stroked it
with our Hands, being, as I suppose, bred up among
the Negroes like a House-Dog. It was our Black
Prince, it seems, who making his Tour among the
abandoned Houses or Hutts, found this Crea∣ture
there, and making much of him, and giving
<PB N="102" REF="104"/>
a Bit or two of Flesh to him, the Creature fol∣lowed
him like a Dog; of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>Among the Negroes that were killed in this
Battle, there was one who had a little thin Bit
or Plate of Gold, about as big as a Six-Pence,
which hung by a little Bit of a twisted Gutt,
upon his Forehead, by which we supposed he
was a Man of some Eminence among them; but
that was not all, for this Bit of Gold put us
upon searching very narrowly, if there was not
more of it to be had thereabouts, but we
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound no ne at all.</P>
<P>From this Part of the Country we went on for
about 15 Days, and then found our selves obliged
to march up a high Ridge of Mountains frightful
to behold, and the first of the Kind that we met
with; and having no Guide but our little Pocket
Compass, we had no Advantage of Information
as to which was the best, or the worst Way, but
were obliged to chuse by what we saw, and shift
as well as we could. We met with several Na∣tions
of wild and naked People in the plain Coun∣try,
before we came to those Hills, and we found
them much more tractable and friendly than those
Devils we had been forc'd to fight with; and tho'
we could learn little from these People, yet we
understood by the Signs they made, that there
was a vast Desart beyond those Hills, and, <HI>as our
Negroes called them,</HI> much Lion, much spotted Cat
(so they called the Leopard) and they sign'd to us
also, that we must carry Water with us. At the
last of these Nations we furnished our selves
with as much Provision as we could possibly car∣ry,
not knowing what we had to suffer, or what
Length we had to go; and to make our Way as
Familiar to us as possible, I proposed, that of
<PB N="103" REF="105"/>
the last Inhabitants we could find, we should make
some Prisoners, and carry them with us for
Guides over the Desart, and to assist us in car∣rying
Provision, and perhaps in getting it too.
The Advice was too necessary to be slighted;
so finding by our dumb Signs to the Inhabitants,
that there were some People that dwelt at the
Foot of the Mountains, on the other Side, be∣fore
we came to the Desart it self, we resolved
to furnish our selves with Guides, by fair Means
or foul.</P>
<P>Here, by a moderate Computation, we conclu∣ded
our selves 700 Miles from the Sea Coast
where we began. Our Black Prince was this Day
set free from the Sling his Arm hung in, our Sur∣geon
having perf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly restored it, and he shewed
it to his own Countrymen quite well, which
made them greatly wonder. Also our two Ne∣groes
began to recover, and their Wounds to heal
apace, for our Surgeon was very skilful in ma∣naging
their Cure.</P>
<P>Having with infinite Labour mounted these
Hills, and coming to a View of the Country be∣yond
them, it was indeed enough to astonish as
stout a Heart as ever was created. It was a vast
howling Wilderness, not a Tree, a River, or a
Green thing to be seen, for as far as the Eye
could look; nothing but a scalding Sand, which,
as the Wind blew, drove about in Clouds, enough
to overwhelm Man and Beast; nor could we see
any End of it, either before us, which was
our Way, or to the right Hand or left: So that
truly our Men began to be discouraged, and
talk of going back again; nor could we indeed
think of venturing over such a horrid Place as
<PB N="104" REF="106"/>
that before us, in which we saw nothing but pre∣sent
Death.</P>
<P>I was as much affected with the Sight as any
of them, but for all that I could not bear the
Thoughts of going back again. I told them we had
march'd 700 Miles of our Way, and it would be
worse than Death to think of going back again;
and that if they thought the Desart was not passa∣ble,
I thought we should rather change our Course,
and travel South till we came to the <HI>Cape of Good
Hope,</HI> or North to the Country that lay along the
<HI>Nile,</HI> where perhaps we might find some Way
or other over to the West Sea; for sure all <HI>Africa</HI>
was not a Desart.</P>
<P>Our Gunner, who, as I said before, was our
Guide as to the Situation of Places, told us, that
he could not tell what to say to going for the
Cape; for it was a monstrous Length, being from
the Place where we now were, not less than
1500 Miles, and by his Account, we were come
now a third Part of the Way to the Coast of <HI>Angola,</HI>
where we should meet with the Western Ocean,
and find Ways enough for our Escape Home. On
the other Hand, he assured us, and shewed us a
Map of it, that if we went Northward, the We∣stern
Shore of <HI>Africk</HI> went out into the Sea above a
Thousand Miles West; so that we should have so
much, and more Land, to travel afterwards;
which Land might, for ought we knew, be as
wild, barren, and desart, as this: And therefore,
upon the whole, he proposed that we should at∣tempt
this Desart, and perhaps we should not find
it so long as we feared; and however, he pro∣posed
that we should see how far our Provisions
would carry us, and in particular, our Water;
and that we should venture no farther than Half
<PB N="105" REF="107"/>
so far as our Water would last; and if we found
no End of the Desart, we might come safely back
again.</P>
<P>This Advice was so reasonable, that we all
approved of it; and accordingly we calculated,
that we were able to carry Provisions for 42
Days, but that we could not carry Water for
above 20 Days, tho' we were to suppose it to
stink too before that time expired. So that we
concluded, that if we did not come at some Wa∣ter
in ten Days time, we would return, but if we
found a Supply of Water, we could then travel
21 Days; and if we saw no End of the Wilder∣ness
in that time, we would return also.</P>
<P>With this Regulation of our Measures, we de∣scended
the Mountains, and it was the second
Day before we quite reached the Plain, where
however, to make us amends, we found a fine
little Rivulet of very good Water, Abundance
of Deer, a sort of Creature like a Hare, but not
so nimble, and whose Flesh we found very agree∣able;
but we were deceived in our Intelligence,
for we found no People; so we got no more Priso∣ners
to assist us in carrying our Baggage.</P>
<P>The infinite Number of Deer and other Creatures
which we saw here, we found was occasioned by
the Neighbourhood of the Wast or Desart, from
whence they retired hither for Food and Refresh∣ment.
We stored our selves here with Flesh and
Roots of divers Kinds, which our Negroes under∣stood
better than we, and which served us for
Bread; and with as much Water as, (by the Al∣lowance
of a Quart a Day to a Man for our Ne∣groes,
and three Pints a Day a Man for our selves,
and three Quarts a Day each, for our Buffloes)
would serve us 20 Days: And thus loaden for a
<PB N="106" REF="108"/>
long miserable March, we set forward, being
all sound in Health, and very chearful, but not
alike strong for so great a Fatigue; and which
was our Grievance, were without a Guide.</P>
<P>In the very first Entrance of the Wast, we
were exceedingly discouraged; for we found the
Sand so deep, and it scalded our Feet so much with
the Heat, that after we had, as I may call it, wa∣ded
rather than walk'd thro' it, about seven or
eight Miles, we were all heartily tired and faint;
even the very Negroes lay down and panted, like
Creatures that had been push'd beyond their
Strength.</P>
<P>Here we found the Difference of Lodging great∣ly
injurious to us; for (as before) we always made
us Hutts to sleep under, which cover'd us from
the Night Air, which is particularly unwholesom
in those hot Countries: But we had here no Shel∣ter,
no Lodging after so hard a March; for here
were no Trees, no not a Shrub near us: And
which was still more frightful, towards Night we
began to hear the Wolves howl, the Lions bel∣low,
and a great many wild Asses braying, and
other ugly Noises which we did not understand.</P>
<P>Upon this we reflected upon our own Indiscre∣tion,
that had not at least brought Poles or Stakes
in our Hands, with which we might have, as it
were pallisadoed our selves in for the Night;
and so we might have slept secure, whatever
other Inconveniences we suffer'd. However, we
found a Way at last to relieve our selves a little.
For first we set up the Lances and Bows we
had, and endeavoured to bring the Tops of them
as near to one another as we could, and so hung
our Coats on the Top of them, which made us
a kind of a sorry Tent; the Leopard's Skin, and
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
a few other Skins we had put together, made us
a tolerable Covering, and thus we lay down to
Sleep, and slept very heartily too for the first
Night, setting however a good Watch, being two
of our own Men with their Fuzees, whom we re∣liev'd
in an Hour at first, and two Hours after∣wards;
and it was very well we did this; for
they found the Wilderness swarm'd with raging
Creatures of all Kinds, some of which came di∣rectly
up to the very Enclosure of our Tent. But
our Centinels were ordered not to alarm us with
Firing in the Night, but to flash in the Pan at
them, which they did, and found it effectual; for
the Creatures went off always as soon as they saw
it, perhaps with some Noise or Howling, and
pursued such other Game as they were upon.</P>
<P>If we were tired with the Day's Travel, we
were all as much tired with the Night's Lodging:
But our Black Prince told us in the Morning, he
would give us some Counsel, and indeed it was
very good Counsel. He told us we should all be
kill'd if we went on this Journey, and thro' this
Desart, without some Covering for us at Night;
so he advised us to march back again to a little
River Side where we lay the Night before, and
stay there till we could make us Houses, as he
called them, to carry with us to lodge in every
Night. As he began a little to understand our
Speech, and we very well to understand his Signs,
we easily knew what he meant, and that we
should there make Matts; (for we remembered
that we saw a great deal of Matting, or Bass
there that the Natives make Matts of) I say,
that we should make large Matts there for Co∣vering
our Hutts or Tents to lodge in at Night.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="110"/>
We all approv'd this Advice, and immediately
resolved to go back that one Day's Journey, re∣solving,
tho' we carried less Provisions, we would
carry Matts with us to cover us in the Night.
Some of the nimblest of us got back to the River
with more Ease than we had travell'd it out the
Day before; but as we were not in Haste, the rest
made a Halt, encamp'd another Night, and came
to us the next Day.</P>
<P>In our Return of this Day's Journey, our Men
that made two Days of it, met with a very sur∣prizing
thing, that gave them some Reason to
be careful how they parted Company again. The
Case was this. The second Day in the Morning,
before they had gone Half a Mile, looking be∣hind
them, they saw a vast Cloud of Sand or
Dust rise in the Air, as we see sometimes in the
Roads in Summer, when it is very dusty, and a
large Drove of Cattel are coming, only very much
greater; and they could easily perceive that it
came after them, and that it came on faster than
they went from it. The Cloud of Sand was so
great, that they could not see what it was that
raised it, and concluded, that it was some Army of
Enemies that pursued them; but then considering
that they came from the vast uninhabited Wil∣derness,
they knew, it was impossible any Na∣tion
or People that Way should have Intelli∣gence
of them, or of the Way of their March:
And therefore, if it was an Army, it must be of
such as they were, travelling that Way by Acci∣dent.
On the other Hand, as they knew that
there were no Horses in the Country, and that
they came on so fast, they concluded, that it
must be some vast Collection of wild Beasts, per∣haps
making to the Hill Country for Food or
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
Water, and that they should be all devoured or
trampled under Foot by their Multitude.</P>
<P>Upon this Thought, they very prudently ob∣served
which Way the Cloud seem'd to point,
and they turned a little out of their Way to
the North, supposing it might pass by them.
When they were about a Quarter of a Mile, they
halted to see what it might be. One of the Ne∣groes,
a nimbler Fellow than the rest, went back
a little, and come again in a few Minutes, run∣ning
as fast as the heavy Sand would allow, and
by Signs gave them to know, that it was a great
Herd or Drove, or whatever it might be called,
of vast monstrous Elephants.</P>
<P>As it was a Sight our Men had never seen, they
were desirous to see it, and yet a little uneasy at
the Danger too; for tho' an Elephant is a heavy,
unwieldy Creature, yet in the deep Sand, which
was nothing at all to them, they marched at a
great Rate, and would soon have tired our People,
if they had had far to go, and had been pursued
by them.</P>
<P>Our Gunner was with them, and had a great
Mind to have gone close up to one of the outer∣most
of them, and to have clapt his Piece to his
Ear, and to have fired into him, because he had
been told no Shot would penetrate them; but
they all disswaded him, lest, upon the Noise, they
should all turn upon, and pursue us; so he was
reasoned out of it, and let them pass, which in
our People's Circumstance was certainly the right
Way.</P>
<P>They were between 20 and 30 in Number, but
prodigious great ones; and tho' they often shew'd
our Men that they saw them, yet they did not
turn out of their Way, or take any other Notice
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
of them, than, <HI>as we might say,</HI> just to look at
them. We that were before, saw the Cloud of
Dust they raised, but we thought it had been
our own Carravan, and so took no Notice; but
as they bent their Course one Point of the Com∣pass,
or thereabouts, to the Southward of the
East, and we went due East, they pass'd by us
at some little Distance; so that we did not see
them, or know any thing of them till Evening,
when our Men came to us, and gave us this Ac∣count
of them. However, this was a useful Ex∣periment
for our future Conduct in passing the
Desart, as you shall hear in its Place.</P>
<P>We were now upon our Work, and our Black
Prince was Head Surveyor, for he was an excel∣lent
Matt-Maker himself, and all his Men under∣stood
it; so that they soon made us near a Hun∣dred
Matts: And as every Man, I mean of the
Negroes, carried one, it was no Manner of Load,
and we did not carry an Ounce of Provisions the
less. The greatest Burthen was to carry six long
Poles, besides some shorter Stakes; but the Ne∣groes
made an Advantage of that, for carrying
them between two, they made the Luggage of
Provisions which they had to carry, so much the
lighter, binding it upon two Poles, and so made
three Couple of them. As soon as we saw this,
we made a little Advantage of it too; for having
three or four of our Baggs called Bottles, (I mean
Skins or Bladders to carry Water) more than the
Men could carry, we got them fill'd, and carried
them this Way, which was a Day's Water and
more for our Journey.</P>
<P>Having now ended our Work, made our Matts,
and fully recruited our Stores of all things ne∣cessary,
and having made us Abundance of small
<PB N="111" REF="113"/>
Ropes of Matting for ordinary Use, as we might
have Occasion, we set forward again, having
interrupted our Journey eight Days in all, upon
this Affair. To our great Comfort, the Night
before we set out, there fell a very violent Show∣er
of Rain, the Effects of which we found in the
Sand; tho' the Heat of one Day dry'd the Sur∣face
as much as before, yet it was harder at Bot∣tom,
not so heavy, and was cooler to our Feet,
by which Means we march'd, as we reckoned,
about fourteen Miles instead of seven, and with
much more Ease.</P>
<P>When we came to encamp, we had all things
ready, for we had fitted our Tent, and set it up
for Trial where we made it; so that in less than
an Hour, we had a large Tent raised, with an
Inner and Outer Apartment, and two Entrances.
In one we lay our selves, in the other our Ne∣groes,
having light pleasant Matts over us, and
others at the same time under us. Also we had
a little Place without all for our Buffloes, for they
deserved our Care, being very useful to us, be∣sides
carrying Forage and Water for themselves.
Their Forage was a Root which our Black Prince
directed us to find, not much unlike a Pasnip, ve∣ry
moist and nourishing, of which there was Plen∣ty
wherever we came, this horrid Desart ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>When we came the next Morning to decamp,
our Negroes took down the Tent, and pull'd up
the Stakes, and all was in Motion in as little time
as it was set up. In this Posture we march'd
eight Days, and yet could see no End, no Change
of our Prospect, but all looking as wild and dis∣mal
as at the Beginning. If there was any Alte∣ration,
it was, that the Sand was no where so deep
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
and heavy as it was the first three Days. This
we thought might be, because for six Months
of the Year the Winds blowing West, (as for
the other six, they blew constantly East) the
Sand was driven violently to the Side of the Desart
where we set out, where the Mountains lying
very high, the Easterly <HI>Monsoons,</HI> when they
blew, had not the same Power to drive it back
again; and this was confirm'd by our finding
the like Depth of Sand on the farthest Extent
of the Desart to the West.</P>
<P>It was the ninth Day of our Travel in this
Wilderness, when we came to the View of a great
Lake of Water, and you may be sure this was
a particular Satisfaction to us, because we had
not Water left for above two or three Days
more, at our shortest Allowance; I mean, al∣lowing
Water for our Return, if we had been
driven to the Necessity of it. Our Water had
served us two Days longer than we expected,
our Buffloes having found for two or three Days,
a kind of Herb like a Broad flat Thistle, tho'
without any Prickle, spreading on the Ground
and growing in the Sand, which they eat freely
of, and which supplied them for Drink as well
as Forage.</P>
<P>The next Day, which was the tenth from our
setting out, we came to the Edge of this Lake,
and very happily for us, we came to it at the
South Point of it, for to the North we could see
no End of it; so we passed by it, and travelled
three Days by the Side of it, which was a great
Comfort to us, because it lightened our Bur∣then,
there being no need to carry Water, when
we had it in View; and yet, tho' here was so
much Water, we found but very little Altera∣tion
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
in the Desart, no Trees, no Grass or Her∣bage,
except that Thistle, as I call'd it, and two
or three more Plants, which we did not under∣stand,
of which the Desart began to be pretty
full.</P>
<P>But as we were refreshed with the Neighbour∣hood
of this Lake of Water, so we were now
gotten among a prodigious Number of ravenous
Inhabitants, the like whereof, tis most certain
the Eye of Man never saw: For as I firmly believe,
that never Man, nor a Body of Men, passed this
Desart since the Flood, so I believe there is not
the like Collection of fierce, ravenous, and de∣vouring
Creatures in the World; I mean not in
any particular Place.</P>
<P>For a Day's Journey before we came to this
Lake, and all the three Days we were passing
by it, and for six or seven Days March after it,
the Ground was scattered with Elephants Teeth,
in such a Number, as is incredible; and as some
of them may have lain there for some Hundreds
of Years, so seeing the Substance of them scarce
ever decayes, they may lye there for ought I
know to the End of Time. The Size of some
of them is, it seems, to those to whom I have
reported it, as incredible as the Number, and I
can assure you, there were several so heavy, as
the strongest Man among us could not lift. As
to Number, I question not but there are enough
to load a thousand Sail of the biggest Ships in the
World, by which I may be understood to mean,
that the Quantity is not to be conceived of;
seeing that as they lasted in View for above eighty
Miles Travelling, so they might continue as far
to the right Hand, and to the left as far, and
many times as far, for ought we knew; for it
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
seems the Number of Elephants hereabouts is
prodigious great. In one Place in particular, we
saw the Head of an Elephant, with several Teeth
in it, but one the biggest that ever I saw: The Flesh
was consumed to be sure many Hundred Years
before, and all the other Bones; but three of
our strongest Men could not lift this Scull and
Teeth: The great Tooth, I believe, weighed at
least 300 Weight, and this was particularly re∣markable
to me, that I observed the whole Scull
was as good Ivory as the Teeth, and I believe all
together weighed at least 600 Weight, and tho'
I do not know but, by the same Rule, all the
Bones of the Elephant may be Ivory; yet I
think there is this just Objection against it
from the Example before me, that then all the
other Bones of this Elephant would have been
there as well as the Head.</P>
<P>I proposed to our Gunner, that seeing we had
travelled now 14 Days without Intermission, and
that we had Water here for our Refreshment,
and no Want of Food yet, or any Fear of it;
we should rest our People a little, and see at
the same time, if perhaps we might kill some
Creatures that were proper for Food. The Gun∣ner,
who had more Forecast of that kind, than
I had, agreed to the Proposal, and added, why
might we not try to catch some Fish out of the
Lake? The first thing we had before us, was
to try if we could make any Hooks, and this
indeed put our Artificer to his Trumps; how∣ever,
with some Labour and Difficulty he did it,
and we catched fresh Fish of several kinds. How
they came there, none but he that made the
Lake, and all the World, knows; for to be sure
<PB N="115" REF="117"/>
no, human Hands ever put any in there, or
pulled any out before.</P>
<P>We not only catched enough for our present
Refreshment, but we dried several large Fishes
of Kinds which I cannot describe, in the Sun,
by which we lengthen'd out our Provision con∣siderably;
for the Heat of the Sun dried them
so effectually without Salt, that they were per∣fectly
cured dry and hard in one Day's time.</P>
<P>We rested our selves here five Days, during
which time we had Abundance of pleasant Ad∣ventures
with the wild Creatures, too many to
relate: One of them was very particular, which
was a Chase between a She Lion, or Lioness, and
a large Deer; and tho' the Deer is naturally
a very nimble Creature, and she flew by us like
the Wind, having perhaps about 300 Yards
the Start of the Lion, yet we found the Lion
by her Strength, and the Goodness of her Lungs,
got Ground of her. They past by us within
about a Quarter of a Mile, and we had a View
of them a great Way, when having given them
over, we were surprized about an Hour after, to
see them come thundering back again on the
other Side of us, and then the Lion was within
30 or 40 Yards of her, and both straining to the
Extremity of their Speed, when the Deer com∣ing
to the Lake, plunged into the Water, and
swam for her Life, as she had before run for it.</P>
<P>The Lioness plunged in after her, and swam a
little way, but came back again; and when she
was got upon the Land, she set up the most
hideous Roar that ever I heard in my Life, as
if done in the Rage of having lost her Prey.</P>
<P>We walked out Morning and Evening constantly;
the Middle of the Day we refreshed our selves under
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
our Tent; but one Morning early we saw another
Chase, which more nearly concern'd us than the
other; for our Black Prince, walking by the
Side of the Lake, was set upon by a vast great
Crocodile, which came out of the Lake upon
him; and tho' he was very light of Foot, yet it
was as much as he could do to get away: He
fled amain to us, and the Truth is, we did not
know what to do, for we were told no Bullet
would enter her; and we found it so at first, for
tho' three of our Men fired at her, yet she did
not mind them; but my Friend the Gunner,
a ventrous Fellow, of a bold Heart, and great
Presence of Mind, went up so near as to thrust
the Muzzle of his Piece into her Mouth, and
fired but let his Piece fall, and run for it the
very Moment he had fired it: The Creature raged
a great while, and spent its Fury upon the Gun,
making Marks upon the very Iron with her
Teeth, but after some time fainted and died.</P>
<P>Our Negroes spread the Banks of the Lake
all this while, for Game, and at length killed
us three Deer, one of them very large, the other
two very small. There was Water-Fowl also in the
Lake, but we never came near enough to them
to shoot any; and, as for the Desart, we saw no
Fowls any where in it, but at the Lake.</P>
<P>We likewise killed two or three Civet Cats, but
their Flesh is the worst of Carrion; we saw
Abundance of Elephants at a Distance, and ob∣served,
that they always go in very good Com∣pany,
that is to say, Abundance of them to∣gether,
and always extended in a fair Line of
Battle; and this, they say, is the way they de∣fend
themselves from their Enemies; for if
Lions or Tygers, Wolves or any Creatures, at∣tack
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
them, they being drawn up in a Line,
sometimes reaching five or six Miles in Length,
whatever comes in their Way is sure to be trod
under Foot, or beaten in Pieces with their
Trunks, or lifted up in the Air with their
Trunks; so that if a hundred Lions or Tygers were
coming along, if they meeta Line of Elephants,
they will always fly back till they see Room
to pass by to the Right Hand or to the Left;
and if they did not, it would be impossible for
one of them to escape; for the Elephant, tho'
a heavy Creature, is yet so dexterous and nim∣ble
with his Trunk, that he will not fail to lift
up the heaviest Lion, or any other wild Creature,
and throw him up in the Air quite over his Back,
and then trample him to Death with his Feet.
We saw several Lines of Battle thus, we saw
one so long, that indeed there was no End of it
to be seen, and, I believe, their might be 2000
Elephants in a Row, or Line. They are not
Beasts of Prey, but live upon the Herbage of
the Field, as an Ox does, and, it is said, that
tho' they are so great a Creature, yet that a
smaller Quantity of Forage supplies one of them,
than will suffice a Horse.</P>
<P>The Numbers of this kind of Creature that
are in those Parts are inconceivable, as may be
gather'd from the prodigious Quantity of Teeth,
which as I said we saw in this vast Desart, and
indeed we saw a 100 of them to one of any
other Kinds.</P>
<P>One Evening we were very much surprized;
we were most of us laid down upon our Matts to
Sleep, when our Watch came running in among
us, being frighted with the sudden Roaring of
some Lions just by them, which it seems they
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
had not seen, the Night being dark, till they
were just upon them. There was, as it proved,
an old Lion and his whole Family, for there was
the Lioness and three young Lions, besides the
old King, who was a monstrous great one: One
of the young ones, who were good large well
grown ones too, leapt up upon one of our Negroes,
who stood Centinel, before he saw him, at which
he was heartily frighted, cried out, and run
into the Tent: Our other Man, who had a
Gun, had not Presence of Mind at first to
shoot him, but struck him with the But-End
of his Piece, which made him whine a little,
and then growl at him fearfully; but the Fellow
retired, and we being all alarmed, three of our
Men snatched up their Guns, run to the Tent-Door,
where they saw the great old Lion by the
Fire of his Eyes, and first fired at him, but,
we supposed, missed him, or at least did not
kill him; for they went all off, but raised a
most hideous Roar, which, as if they had called
for Help, brought down a prodigious Number
of Lions, and other furious Creatures, we know
not what about them, for we could not see them;
but their was a Noise and Yelling, and Howling,
and all sort of such Wilderness Musick on every
Side of us, as if all the Beasts of the Desart were
assembled to devour us.</P>
<P>We asked our Black Prince what we should
do with them? <HI>Me go,</HI> says he, <HI>fright them all;</HI> so
he snatches up two or three of the worst of our
Matts, and, getting one of our Men to strike
some Fire, he hangs the Matt up at the End of
a Pole, and set it on Fire, and it blazed abroad
a good while; at which the Creatures all moved
off, for we heard them roar, and make their
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
bellowing Noise at a great Distance. Well, says
our Gunner, if that will do, we need not burn
our Matts, which are our Beds to lay under us,
and our Tilting to cover us. Let me alone, says
he, so he comes back into our Tent, and falls to
making some artificial Fire-Works, and the like;
and he gave our Centinels some to be ready at
Hand, upon Occasion, and particularly he placed
a great Piece of Wild-fire upon the same Pole
that the Matt had been tied to, and set it on
Fire, and that burnt there so long, that all the
Wild Creatures left us for that time.</P>
<P>However, we began to be weary of such Com∣pany,
and, to be rid of them, we set forward
again two Days sooner than we intended. We
found now, that tho' the Desart did not end,
nor could we see any Appearance of it, yet that
the Earth was pretty full of green Stuff, of one
sort or another, so that our Cattle had no Want.
And secondly, that there were several little
Rivers which run into the Lake, and so long
as the Country continued low, we found Water
sufficient, which eased us very much in our
Carriage, and we went on yet sixteen Days more
without yet coming to any Appearance of better
Soil: After this we found the Country rise a little,
and by that we perceived, that the Water would
fail us, so, for fear of the worst, we filled our
Bladder Bottles with Water; we found the Coun∣try
rising gradually thus for three Days conti∣nually,
when, on the sudden, we perceived, that
tho' we had mounted up insensibly, yet that
we were on the Top of a very high ridge of Hills,
tho' not such as at first.</P>
<P>When we came to look down on the other Side
of the Hills we saw, to the great Joy of all our
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
Hearts, that the Desart was at an End; that
the Country was clothed with Green, Abundance
of Trees, and a large River, and we made no
doubt but that we should find People and Cat∣tel
also; and here, by our Gunner's Account,
who kept our Computations, we had marched
above 400 Miles over this dismal Place of Hor∣rour,
having been four and thirty Days a-doing of
it, and consequently were come about 1100 Miles
of our Journey.</P>
<P>We would willingly have descended the Hills
that Night, but it was too late; the next Morn∣ing
we saw every thing more plain, and rested
our selves under the Shade of some Trees;
which were now the most refreshing things imagi∣nable
to us, who had been scorched above a
Month without a Tree to cover us. We found
the Country here very pleasant, especially con∣sidering
that we came from, and we killed
some Deer here also, which we found very fre∣quent
under the Cover of the Woods; also we
killed a creature like a Goat, whose Flesh was
very god to eat, but it was no Goat: We found
also a great Number of Fowls like Partridge,
but something smaller, and were very same, so
that we lived here very well, but found no Peo∣ple,
at least none that would be seen, no not for
several Days Journey; and, to allay our Joy, we
were almost every Night disturbed with Lions
and Tygers; Elephants indeed we saw none
here.</P>
<P>In three Days March we came to a River,
which we saw from the Hills, and which we
called the Golden River, and we found it run
Northward, which was the first Stream we had
met with that did so; it run with a very rapid
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
current, and our Gunner pulling out his Map,
assured me that this was either the River <HI>Nile,</HI>
or run into the great Lake; out of which the
River <HI>Nile</HI> was said to take its Beginning; and he
brought out his Carts and Maps, which by his
Instruction, I began to understand very well;
and told me, he would convince me of it, and
indeed he seemed to make it so plain to me, that
I was of the same Opinion.</P>
<P>But I did not enter into the Gunner's Reason
for this Enquiry, not in the least, till he went
on with it farther, and stated it thus; if
this is the River <HI>Nile,</HI> why should not we build
some more Canoes, and go down this Stream rather
than to expose our selves to any more Desarts
and scorching Sands, in Quest of the Sea, which
when we are come to, we shall be as much
at a Loss how to get home as we were at
<HI>Madagascar.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument was good, had there been no
Objections in the Way, of a Kind which none
of us were capable of answering; but upon the
whole it was an Undertaking of such a Nature,
that every one of us thought it impracticable,
and that upon several Accounts; and our Surgeon,
who was himself a good Scholar, and a Man of
Reading, tho' not acquainted with the Business
of Sailing, opposed it; and some of his Reasons,
I remember, were such as these; first, the Length
of the Way, which both he and the Gunner al∣lowed
by the Course of the Water and Turnings
of the River, would be at least 4000 Miles. Se∣condly,
The innumerable Crocodiles in the
River, which we should never be able to escape.
Thirdly, The dreadful Desarts in the Way;
and lastly, the approaching rainy Season, in which
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
the Streams of the <HI>Nile</HI> would be so furious, and
rise so high, spreading far and wide over all
the plain Country, that we should never be able
to know when we were in the Channel of the
River, and when not, and should certainly be cast
away, over-set, or run a-ground so often, that it
would be impossible to proceed by a River so
excessively dangerous.</P>
<P>This last Reason he made so plain to us, that
we began to be so sensible of it our selves; so that
we agreed to lay that Thought aside, and proceed
in our first Course Westward towards the Sea:
But as if we had been loath to depart, we conti∣nued,
by way of refreshing our selves, to loy∣ter
two Days upon this River, in which time
our Black Prince, who delighted much in wan∣dering
up and down, came one Evening and
brought us several little Bits of something, he
knew not what; but he found it felt heavy, and
looked well, and shewed it to me, as what he
thought was some Rarity. I took not much
Notice of it to him, but stepping out, and call∣ing
the Gunner to me, I shewed it him, and told
him what I thought, <HI>viz.</HI> that it was certain∣ly
Gold: He agreed with me in that, and also
in what follow'd, that we would take the Black
Prince out with us the next Day, and make him
shew us where he found it, that if there was any
Quantity to be found, we would tell our Com∣pany
of it, but if there was but little, we would
keep Counsel, and have it to our selves.</P>
<P>But we forgot to engage the Prince in the
Secret, who innocently told so much to all the
rest, as that they guessed what it was, and came
to us to see; when we found it was publick, we
were more concerned to prevent their suspect∣ing
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
that we had any Design to conceal it, and
openly telling our Thoughts of it, we called our
Artificer, who agreed presently that it was Gold;
so I proposed, that we should all go with the
Prince to the Place where he found it, and if any
Quantity was to be had, we would lye here some
time, and see what we could make of it.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we went every Man of us, for no
Man was willing to be left behind in a Discove∣ry
of such a Nature. When we came to the
Place, we found it was on the West Side of the
River, not in the main River, but in another small
River or Stream which came from the West, and
run into the other River at that Place. We fell
to raking in the Sand, and washing it in our
Hands, and we seldom took up a Handful of Sand,
but we washed some little round Lumps as big as
a Pin's Head, or sometimes as big as a Grapestone,
into our Hands, and we found in two or three
Hours time, that every one had got some, so
we agreed to leave off, and go to Dinner.</P>
<P>While we were eating, it came into my
Thoughts, that while we work'd at this Rate in
a thing of such Nicety and Consequence, it was
ten to one if the Gold, which was the <HI>Make∣bait</HI>
of the World, did not first or last set us
together by the Ears to break our good Arti∣cles
and our Understanding one among another,
and perhaps cause us to part Companies, or
worse; I therefore told them, that I was indeed
the youngest Man of the Company, but as they
had always allowed me to give my Opinion in
things, and had sometimes been pleased to follow
my Advice, so I had something to propose now,
which I thought, would be for all our Advantages,
and I believed they would all like it very well. I
<PB N="124" REF="126"/>
told them we were in a Country where we all
knew there was a great deal of Gold, and that
all the World sent Ships thither to get it; that
we did not indeed know where it was, and so we
might get a great deal, or a little, we did not
know whether; but I offered it to them to con∣sider
whether it would not be the best Way for
us, and to preserve the good Harmony and
Friendship that had been always kept among
us, and which was so absolutely necessary to our
Safety, that what we found should be brought
together to one common Stock, and be equally
divided at last, rather than to run the Hazard of
any Difference which might happen among us,
from any one's having found more or less than an∣other.
I told them, that if we were all upon one
Bottom, we should all apply our selves heartily to
the Work, and besides that, we might then set
our Negroes all to Work for us, and receive
equally the Fruit of their Labour, and of our own,
and being all exactly alike Sharers, there could
be no just Cause of Quarrel or Disgust among us.</P>
<P>They all approv'd the Proposal, and every one
jointly swore, and gave their Hands to one ano∣ther,
that they would not conceal the least Grain
of Gold from the rest; and consented, that if
any one or more should be found to conceal
any, all that he had should be taken from him,
and divided among the rest: And one thing
more was added to it by our Gunner, from Consi∣derations
equally good and just; that if any one
of us, by any Play, Bett, Game, or Wager, won
any Money or Gold, or the Value of any from
another, during our whole Voyage till our Return
quite to <HI>Portugal,</HI> he should be obliged by us all
to restore it again on the Penalty of being dis∣arm'd,
<PB N="125" REF="127"/>
and turn'd out of the Company, and of
having no Relief from us on any Account what∣sever.
This was to prevent Wagering and Playing
for Money, which our Men were apt to do by se∣veral
Means, and at several Games, tho' they
had neither Cards or Dice.</P>
<P>Having made this wholesom Agreement, we
went chearfully to Work, and shew'd our Ne∣groes
how to work for us; and working up the
Stream on both Sides, and in the Bottom of the
River, we spent about three Weeks Time dab∣bling
in the Water; by which time, as it lay all
in our Way, we had gone about six Miles, and
not more; and still the higher we went, the
more Gold we found; till at last, having pass'd by
the Side of a Hill, we perceived on a sudden,
that the Gold stopp'd, and that there was not a
Bit taken up beyond that Place; it presently oc∣curr'd
to my Mind, that it must then be from
the Side of that little Hill that all the Gold we
found was work'd down.</P>
<P>Upon this, we went back to the Hill, and fell
to Work with that. We found the Earth loose,
and of a yellowish loamy Colour, and in some
Places, a white hard Kind of Stone, which in
describing since to some of our Artists, they tell
me was the Spar which is found by the Oar, and
surrounds it in the Mine. However, if it had
been all Gold, we had no Instrument to force it
out; so we passed that: But scratching into the
loose Earth with our Fingers, we came to a sur∣prizing
Place, where the Earth for the Quantity of
two Bushels, I believe, or thereabouts, crumbled
down with little more than touching it, and ap∣parently
shewed us that there was a great deal of
Gold in it. We took it all carefully up, and
<PB N="126" REF="128"/>
washing it in the Water, the loamy Earth wash'd
away, and left the Gold Dust free in our Hands;
and that which was more remarkable, was, that
when this loose Earth was all taken away, and we
came to the Rock or hard Stone, there was not
one Grain of Gold more to be found.</P>
<P>At Night we came all together to see what we
had got, and it appeared we had found in that
Day's Heap of Earth, about Seven and Fifty
Pound Weight of Gold Dust, and about Thirty
Four Pound more in all the rest of our Works
in the River.</P>
<P>It was a happy Kind of Disappointment to us,
that we found full Stop put to our Work;
for had the Quantity of Gold been ever so small,
yet had any at all come, I do not know when we
should have given over; for having rummaged this
Place, and not finding the least Grain of Gold in
any other Place, or in any of the Earth there,
except in that loose Parcel, we went quite back
down the small River again, working it over and
over again, as long as we could find any thing
how small soever; and we did get six or seven
Pound more the second time. Then we went
into the first River, and tried it up the Stream
and down the Stream, on the one Side and on the
other. Up the Stream we found nothing, no not
a Grain; down the Stream we found very little,
not above the Quantity of Half an Ounce in two
Miles working; so back we came again to the
Golden River, as we justly called it, and work'd
it up the Stream and down the Stream twice more
a-piece, and every time we found some Gold, and
perhaps might have done so, if we had stay'd
there till this time; but the Quantity was at last
so small, and the Work so much the harder,
<PB N="127" REF="129"/>
that we agreed by Consent to give it over, lest we
should fatigue our selves and our Negroes so,
as to be quite unfit for our Journey. When we
had brought all our Purchase together, we had in
the whole three Pound and a Half of Gold to
a Man, Share and Share alike, according to such
a Weight and Scale as our ingenious Cutler made
for us to weigh it by, which he did indeed by
guess, but which, as he said he was sure was ra∣ther
more than less, and so it prov'd at last; for
it was near two Ounces more than Weight in a
Pound. Besides this, there was seven or eight
Pound Weight left, which we agreed to leave in
his Hands, to work it into such Shapes as we
thought fit to give away to such People as we
might yet meet with, from whom we might have
Occasion to buy Provisions, or even to buy Friend∣ship,
or the like; and particularly we gave about
a Pound to our Black Prince, which he hammer'd
and work'd by his own indefatigable Hand, and
some Tools our Artificer lent him, into little
round Bits, as round almost as Beads, tho' not
exact in Shape, and drilling Holes thro' them,
put them all upon a String, and wore them about
his black Neck, and they look'd very well there
I assure you; but he was many Months a-doing it.
And thus ended our first Golden Adventure.</P>
<P>We now began to discover what we had not
troubled our Heads much about before; and that
was, that let the Country be good or bad that
we were in, we could not travel much farther, for
a considerable time. We had been now five Months
and upwards in our Journey, and the Season
began to change; and Nature told us, that being
in a Climate that had a Winter as well as a Sum∣mer,
tho' of a differing Kind from what our own
<PB N="128" REF="130"/>
Country produced, we were to expect a wet Sea∣son,
and such as we should not be able to travel in,
as well by reason of the Rain it self, as of the
Floods which it would occasion wherever we
should come; and tho' we had been no Stran∣gers
to those wet Seasons in the Island of <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI>
yet we had not thought much of them
since we begun our Travels; for setting out when
the Sun was about the Solstice, that is, when it
was at the greatest Northern Distance from us,
we had found the Benefit of it in our Travels.
But now it drew near us apace, and we found
it began to rain; upon which we called ano∣ther
General Council, in which we debated
our present Circumstances, and in particular,
whether we should go forward, or seek for a pro∣per
Place upon the Bank of our Golden River,
which had been so lucky to us to fix our Camp
for the Winter.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, it was resolved to abide where
we were; and it was not the least Part of our
Happiness that we did so, as shall appear in its
Place.</P>
<P>Having resolved upon this, our first Measures
were to set our Negroes to Work, to make Hutts
or Houses for our Habitation; and this they did
very dexterously; only that we changed the
Ground where we had at first intended it, think∣ing,
as indeed it happen'd, that the river might
reach it upon any sudden Rain. Our Camp was
like a little Town, in which our Hutts were in
the Center, having one large one in the Center of
them also, into which all our particular Lodgings
opened; so that none of us went into our Apart∣ments,
but thro' a publick Tent where we all eat
and drank together, and kept our Councils and
<PB N="129" REF="131"/>
Society, and our Carpenters made us Tables,
Benches, and Stools in Abundance, as many as
we could make use of.</P>
<P>We had no Need of Chimneys, it was hot
enough without Fire; but yet we found our selves
at last oblig'd to keep a Fire every Night upon
a particular Occasion: For tho' we had in all
other Respects a very pleasant and agreeable Sci∣tuation,
yet we were rather worse troubled with
the unwelcome Visits of wild Beasts here, than in
the Wilderness it self; for as the Deer, and other
gentle Creatures came hither for Shelter and
Food, so the Lions, and Tigers, and Leopards,
haunted these Places continually for Prey.</P>
<P>When first we discovered this, we were so
uneasy at it, that we thought of removing our
Scituation; but after many Debates about it, we
resolved to fortify our selves in such a Manner, as
not to be in any Danger from it; and this our
Carpenters undertook, who first palisadoed our
Camp quite round with long Stakes (for we had
Wood enough) which Stakes were not stuck in
one by another like Pales, but in an irregular
Manner; a great Multitude of them so placed,
that they took up near two Yards in Thickness,
some higher, some lower, all sharpened at the
Top, and about a Foot asunder; so that had
any Creature jump'd at them, unless he had gone
clean over, which it was very hard to do, he
would be hung upon twenty or thirty Spikes.</P>
<P>The Entrance into this, had larger Stakes than
the rest placed so before one another, as to make
three or four short Turnings, which no four∣footed
Beast bigger than a Dog could possibly
come in at; and that we might not be attack'd
by any Multitude together, and consequently be
<PB N="130" REF="132"/>
alarm'd in our Sleep, as we had been, or be
oblig'd to waste our Ammunition, which we
were very chary of, we kept a great Fire every
Night without the Entrance of our Palisade, ha∣ving
a Hutt for our two Centinels to stand in
free from the Rain, just within the Entrance, and
right against the Fire.</P>
<P>To maintain this Fire, we cut a prodigious
deal of Wood, and piled it upon a Heap to dry,
and with the green Boughs made a second Co∣vering
over our Hutts, so high and thick, that
it might cast the Rain off from the first, and keep
us effectually dry.</P>
<P>We had scarce finished all these Works, but
that the Rain came on so fierce, and so conti∣nued,
that we had little time to stir abroad for
Food, except indeed that our Negroes, who wore
no Clothes, seem'd to make nothing of the Rain,
tho'to us <HI>Europeans</HI> in those hot Climates, nothing
is more dangerous.</P>
<P>We continued in this Posture for four Months,
that is, from the Middle of <HI>June</HI> to the Middle
of <HI>October;</HI> for tho' the Rains went off, at least
the greatest Violence of them, about the <HI>Equinox,</HI>
yet as the Sun was then just over our Heads, we
resolved to stay a while till it was pass'd us a little
to the Southward.</P>
<P>During our Encampment here, we had several
Adventures with the ravenous Creatures of that
Country, and had not our Fire been always
kept burning, I question much whether all our
Fence, tho' we strengthen'd it afterwards with
twelve or fourteen Rows of Stakes more, would
have kept us secure. It was always in the Night
that we had the Disturbance of them, and some∣times
they came in such Multitudes, that we
<PB N="131" REF="133"/>
thought all the Lions, and Tigers, and Leopards,
and Wolves of <HI>Africa</HI> were come together to at∣tack
us. One Night being clear Moonshine, one
of our Men being upon the Watch, told us, he
verily believed he saw Ten Thousand wild Crea∣tures
of one Sort or another, pass by our little
Camp; and ever as they saw the Fire, they sheer'd
off, but were sure to howl or roar, or whatever
it was, when they were past.</P>
<P>The Musick of their Voices was very far from
being pleasant to us, and sometimes would be so
very disturbing, that we could not sleep for it;
and often our Centinels would call us, that were
awake to come and look at them. It was one windy
tempestuous Night after a very rainy Day, that
we were indeed all called up; for such innume∣rable
Numbers of Devilish Creatures came about
us, that our Watch really thought they would
attack us. They would not come on the Side
where the Fire was; and tho' we thought our
selves secure every where else, yet we all got up,
and took to our Arms. The Moon was near the
Full, but the Air full of flying Clouds, and a
strange Hurricane of Wind to add to the Terror
of the Night; when looking on the Back Part
of our Camp, I thought I saw a Creature with∣in
our Fortification, and so indeed he was, except
his Haunches; for he had taken a running Leap,
I suppose, and with all his Might had thrown
himself clear over our Palisadoes, except one
strong Pile which stood higher than the rest, and
which had caught hold of him, and by his Weight
he had hang'd himself upon it, the Spike of the
Pile running into his Hinder-Haunch or Thigh,
on the Inside, and by that he hung growling and
biting the Wood for Rage. I snatcht up a Lance
<PB N="132" REF="134"/>
from on of the Negroes that stood just by me,
and running to him, struck it three or four Times
into him, and dispatch'd him; being unwilling to
shoot, because I had a Mind to have a Volley fired
among the rest, whom I could see standing with∣out
as thick as a Drove of Bullocks going to a
Fair. I immediately called our People out, and
shewed them the Object of Terror which I had
seen, and without any farther Consultation, fired
a full Volley among them, most of our Pieces
being loaden with two or three Sluggs or Bullets
a-piece. It made a horrible Clutter among them,
and in general they all took to their Heels, on∣ly
that we could observe, that some walk'd off
with more Gravity and Majesty than others, be∣ing
not so much frighted at the Noise and Fire;
and we could perceive that some were left upon
the Ground struggling as for Life, but we durst
not stir out to see what they were.</P>
<P>Indeed they stood so thick, and were so near
us, that we could not well miss killing or woun∣ding
some of them, and we believe they had cer∣tainly
the Smell of us, and of our Victuals we had
been killing; for we had killed a Deer, and three
or four of those Creatures like Goats, the Day
before; and some of the Offal had been thrown
out behind our Camp, and this we suppose drew
them so much about us; but we avoided it for
the future.</P>
<P>Tho' the Creatures fled, yet we heard a fright∣ful
Roaring all Night at the Place where they
stood, which we supposed was from some that
were wounded; and as soon as Day came, we went
out to see what Execution we had done, and,
indeed, it was a strange Sight; there were three
Tygers and two Wolves quite killed, besides
<PB N="133" REF="135"/>
the Creature I had killed within onr Palisado,
which seem'd to be of an ill-gendered kind, between
a Tyger and a Leopard. Besides this, there was a
noble old Lion alive, but with both his Fore Legs
broke, so that he could not stir away, and he
had almost beat himself to Death with strugg∣ling
all Night; and we found, that this was the
wounded Soldier that had roared so loud, and
given us so much Disturbance: Our Surgeon,
looking at him, smiled; Now, says he, if I could
be sure this Lion would be as grateful to me,
as one of his Majesty's Ancestors was to <HI>Androni∣cus</HI>
the <HI>Roman</HI> Slave, I would certainly set both
his Legs again, and cure him. I had not heard
the Story of <HI>Andronicus,</HI> so he told it me at large;
but as to the Surgeon, we told him, he had
no Way to know whether the Lion would do so
or not, but to cure him first, and trust to his
Honour; but he had no Faith; so, to dispatch
him, and put him out of his Torment, he shot
him into the Head, and killed him, for which we
called him the King-Killer ever after.</P>
<P>Our Negroes found no less than five of these
ravenous Creatures wounded and dropt at a
Distance from our Quarters; whereof, one was
a Wolf, one a fine spotted young Leopard, and
the other were Creatures that we knew not what
to call them.</P>
<P>We had several more of these Gentle-folks
about us after that, but no such general Rendezvous
of them as that was, any more; but this ill Effect
it had to us, that it frighted the Deer and
other Creatures from our Neighbourhood, of
whose Company we were much more desirous,
and who were necessary for our Subsistence:
However, our Negroes went out every Day a-Hunting,
<PB N="134" REF="136"/>
as they called it, with Bow and Arrow,
and they scarce ever failed of bringing us home
something or other; and particularly we found
in this Part of the Country, after the Rains had
fallen some time, Abundance of Wild-fowl, such
as we have in <HI>England;</HI> Duck, Teal, Widgeon,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> some Geese, and some Kinds that we had
never seen before, and we frequently killed them.
Also we catched a great Deal of fresh Fish out
of the River, so that we wanted no Provision;
if we wanted any thing, it was Salt to eat with
our fresh Meat, but we had a little left, and we
used it sparingly for, as to our Negroes, they
would not taste it, nor did they care to eat any
Meat that was seasoned with it.</P>
<P>The Weather began now to clear up, the Rains
were down, and the Floods abated, and the Sun,
which had passed our Zenith, was gone to the
Southward a good Way, so we prepared to go
on of our Way.</P>
<P>It was the 12th of <HI>October</HI> or thereabouts, that
we began to set forward, and having an easy
Country to travel in, as well as to supply us with
Provisions, tho' still without Inhabitants, we
made more Dispatch, travelling some times, as we
calculated it 20 or 25 Miles a Day; nor did we
halt any were in eleven Days March, one Day
excepted, which was to make a Raft to carry
us over a small River, which having swelled
with the Rains was not yet quite down.</P>
<P>When we were past this River, which by the
Way run to the Northward too, we found a great
Row of Hills in our Way; we saw indeed the
Country open to the Right at a great Distance,
but as we kept true to our Course due West, we
were not willing to go a great Way out of our
<PB N="135" REF="137"/>
Way, only to shun a few Hills; so we advanced;
but we were surprized, when being not quite come
to the Top, one of our Company who with two
Negroes was got up before us, cry'd out the <HI>Sea!</HI>
the <HI>Sea!</HI> and fell a-dancing and jumping as Signs
of Joy.</P>
<P>The Gunner and I were most surprized at it,
because we had but that Morning been calcu∣lating,
that we must have yet above a 1000 Miles
to the Sea-side, and that we could not expect to
reach it till an other rainy Season would be
upon us, so that when our Man cry'd out the
Sea, the Gunner was angry, and said he was
mad.</P>
<P>But we were both in the greatest Surprize imagi∣nable,
when coming to the Top of the Hill, and
tho' it was very high, we saw nothing but Water,
either before us, or to the right Hand or the
left, being a vast Sea without any Bound but the
Horizon.</P>
<P>We went down the Hill full of Confusion of
Thought, not being able to conceive where∣abouts
we were, or what it must be, seeing by
all our Charts the Sea was yet a vast Way off.</P>
<P>It was not above three Miles from the Hills
before we came the Shore, or Water-edge
of this Sea, and there, to our further Surprize,
we found the Water fresh and pleasant to drink;
so that in short we knew not what Course to
take: The Sea, as we thought it to be, put a
full stop to our Journey, (I mean Westward) for
it lay just in the Way. Our next Question was
which Hand to turn to, to the Right or the
Left, but this was soon resolved; for as we
knew not the Extent of it, we considered that
our Way, if it had been the Sea really, must be to
<PB N="136" REF="138"/>
the North; and therefore, if we went to the
South now, it must be just so much out of our Way
at last: So having spent a good Part of the Day
in our Surprize at the Thing, and consulting what
to do, we set forward to the North.</P>
<P>We travelled upon the Shore of this Sea full
23 Days, before we could come to any Resolu∣tion
about what it was; at the End of which,
early one Morning, one of our Seamen cried
out Land, and it was no false Alarm, for we saw
plainly the Tops of some Hills at a very great
Distance, on the further Side of the Water, due
West; but tho' this satisfied us that it was
not the Sea, but an Inland Sea or Lake, yet
we saw no Land to the Northward, that is so say,
no End of it; but were obliged to travel eight
Days more, and near a 100 Miles further, before
we came to the End of it, and then we found
this Lake or Sea ended in a very great River,
which run N. or N. by E. as the other River had
done, which I mention'd before.</P>
<P>My Friend the Gunner, upon examining, said,
that he believed that he was mistaken before,
and that this was the River <HI>Nile,</HI> but was still
of the Mind, that we were of before, that we
should not think of a Voyage into <HI>Egypt</HI> that Way;
so we resolved upon crossing this River, which
however was not so easy as before, the River
being very rapid, and the Channel very broad.</P>
<P>It cost us therefore a Week here to get Mate∣rials
to wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t our selves and Cattel over this
River; for tho' here were Store of Trees, yet
there were none of any considerable Growth,
sufficient to make a Canoe.</P>
<P>During our March on the Edge of this Bank,
we met with great Fatigue, and therefore tra∣vell'd
<PB N="137" REF="139"/>
fewer Miles in a Day than before, there
being such a prodigious Number of little Rivers
that came down from the Hills on the East Side,
emptying themselves into this Gulph, all which
Waters were pretty high, the Rains having
been but newly over.</P>
<P>In the last three Days of our Travel we met
with some Inhabitants, but we found they lived
upon the little Hills, and not by the Water Side;
nor were we a little put to it for Food in this
March, having killed nothing for four or five
Days, but some Fish we caught out of the Lake,
and that not in such Plenty as we found before.</P>
<P>But to make us some amends, we had no Distur∣bance
upon all the Shore of this Lake, from any
wild Beasts; the only Inconveniency of that Kind
was, that we met an ugly, venemous, deformed
kind of a Snake or Serpent in the wet Grounds
near the Lake, that several times pursued us, as if
it would attack us; and if we struck at, or threw
any thing at it, would raise it self up, and hiss
as loud it might be heard a great Way; it had
a hellish, ugly, deformed Look and Voice, and
our Men would not be perswaded but it was the
Devil, only that we did not know what Business
Satan could have there, where there were no
People.</P>
<P>It was very remarkable that we had now tra∣velled
a 1000 Miles without meeting with any
People, in the Heart of the whole Continent
of <HI>Africa,</HI> where to be sure never Man set his
Foot since the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> spread them∣selves
over the Face of the whole Earth; here
also our Gunner took an Observation with his
Forestaff to determine our Latitude, and he
found now, that having marched about 33 Days
<PB N="138" REF="140"/>
Northward, we were in 6 Degrees 22 Minutes
South Latitude.</P>
<P>After having with great Difficulty got over
this River, we came into a strange wild Country,
that began a little to affright us; for tho' the
Country was not a Desart of dry scalding Sand,
as that was we had passed before, yet it was
mountainous, barren and infinitely full of most
furious wild Beasts, more than any Place we had
past yet. There was indeed a kind of coarse
Herbage on the Surface, and now and then a
few Trees or rather Shrubs; but People we
could see none, and we began to be in great
Suspense about Victuals; for we had not killed
a Deer a great while, but had lived chiefly upon
Fish and Fowl alway by the Water Side, both
which seemed to fail us now; and we were in the
more Consternation, because we could not lay in
a Stock here to proceed upon, as we did before, but
were obliged to set out with Scarcity, and with∣out
any Certainty of a Supply.</P>
<P>We had however no Remedy but Patience;
and having killed some Fowls, and dried some
Fish, as much as with short Allowance we reckon∣ed
would last us five Days, we resolved to ven∣ture,
and venture we did; nor was it without
Cause that we were apprehensive of the Dan∣ger,
for we travelled the five Days, and met
neither with Fish, or Fowl, or four-footed Beast
whose Flesh was fit to eat; and we were in a
most dreadful Apprehension of being famished
to Death; on the sixth Day we almost fasted,
or, as we may say, we eat up all the Scraps of
what we had left, and at Night lay down sup∣perless
upon our Matts with heavy Hearts, be∣ing
obliged the eighth Day to kill of one of our
<PB N="139" REF="141"/>
poor faithful Servants the Buffloes, that carry'd
our Baggage; the flesh of this Creature was very
good, and so sparingly did we eat of it, that it
lasted us all three Days and a half, and was just
spent; and we were upon the point of killing
another, when we saw before us a Country that
promised better, having high Trees and a large
River in the middle of it.</P>
<P>This encouraged us, and we quicken'd our
March for the River Side, tho' with empty Sto∣machs,
and very faint and weak; but before
we came to this River we had the good Hap to
meet with some young Deer, a Thing we had
long wished for. In a Word, having shot three
of them, we came to a full Stop to fill our Bellies,
and never gave the Flesh time to cool before we
eat it; nay 'twas much we could stay to kill it,
and had not eaten it alive, for we were in short
almost famished.</P>
<P>Through all that unhospitable Country we saw
continually Lions, Tygers, Leopards, Civet Cats,
and Abundance of Kinds of Creatures that we
did not understand; we say no Elephants, but
every now and then we met with an Elephant's
Tooth lying on the Ground, and some of them
lying as it were half buried by the Length of
Time that they had lain there.</P>
<P>When we came to the Shore of this River,
we found it run Northerly still, as all the rest
had done, but with this Difference, that as the
Course of the other Rivers were N. by E. or
N. N. E. the Course of this lay N. N. W.</P>
<P>On the farther Bank of this River we saw
some Sign of Inhabitants, but met with none
for the first Day; but the next Day we came
into an Inhabited Country, the People all Ne∣groes,
<PB N="140" REF="142"/>
and stark naked, without Shame, both
Men and Women.</P>
<P>We made Signs of Friendship to them, and
found them a very frank, civil, and friendly sort
of People. They came to our Negroes without
any Suspition, nor did they give us any Reason
to suspect them of any Villainy, as the others
had done; we made Signs to them that we
were hungry, and immediately some naked
Women ran and fetched us great Quantities of
Roots, and of Things like Pumpkins, which
we made no Scruple to eat; and our Artificer
shewed them some of his Trinkets that he had
made, some of Iron, some of Silver, but none
of Gold: They had so much Judgment to chuse
that of Silver before the Iron, but when we
shewed them some Gold, we found they did not
value it so much as either of the other.</P>
<P>For some of these Things they brought us
more Provisions, and three living Creatures as
big as Calves, but not of that Kind; neither did
we ever see any of them before; their Flesh was
very good; and after that they brought us
twelve more, and some smaller Creatures, like
Hares, all which were very welcome to us who
were indeed at a very great Loss for Provisions.</P>
<P>We grew very intimate with these People,
and indeed they were the civillest and most friend∣ly
People that we met with at all, and mightily
pleased with us; and which was very particular,
they were much easier to be made to understand
our Meaning, than any we had met with before.</P>
<P>At last, we began to enquire our Way, point∣ing
to the West, they made us understand easily
that we could not go that Way, but they
pointed to us, that we might go North-West,
<PB N="141" REF="143"/>
so that we presently understood that there was
another Lake in our Way, which proved to be
true; for in two Days more we saw it plain, and
it held us till we past the Equinoctial Line,
lying all the Way on our left Hand, tho' at
a great Distance.</P>
<P>Travelling thus Northward, our Gunner
seemed very anxious about our Proceedings; for
he assured us, and made me sensible of it by
the Maps, which he had been teaching me out
of, that when we came into the Latitude of six
Degrees, or thereabouts, North of the Line, the
Land trended away to the West, to such a Length,
that we should not come at the Sea under a March
of above 1500 Miles farther Westward than the
Country we desired to go to. I asked him if there
were no Navigable Rivers that we might meet
with, which running into the West Ocean, might
perhaps carry us down their Stream, and then if
it were 1500 Miles, or twice 1500 Miles, we might
do well enough, if we could but get Provisions.</P>
<P>Here he shewed me the Maps again, and that
there appeared no River whose Stream was of
any such Length as to do us any Kindness, till
we came perhaps within 2 or 300 Miles of the
Shore, except the <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> as they call it,
which lay farther Northward from us, at least
700 Miles; and that then he knew not what
kind of Country it might carry us through; for
he said it was his Opinion, that the Heats on
the North of the Line, even in the same Latitude,
were violent, and the Country more desolate,
barren, and barbarous than those of the South;
and that when we came among the Negroes in
the North Part of <HI>Africa,</HI> next the Sea, espe∣cially
those who had seen and trafficked with
<PB N="142" REF="144"/>
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> such as <HI>Dutch, English, Portuguese,
Spaniards,</HI> &amp;c. that they had most of them been so
ill used at some time or other, that they would
certainly put all the Spight they could upon
us in meer Revenge.</P>
<P>Upon these Considerations, he advised us, that
as soon as we had passed this Lake, we should
proceed W. S. W. that is to say, a little enclining
to the South, and that in Time we should meet
with the great River <HI>Congo,</HI> from whence the
Coast is called <HI>Congo,</HI> being a little North of <HI>An∣gola,</HI>
where we intended at first to go.</P>
<P>I asked him, if ever he had been on the Coast
of <HI>Congo;</HI> he said yes he had, but was never on
Shore there: Then I asked him, how we should get
from thence to the Coast where the <HI>European</HI>
Ships came, seeing if the Land trended away
West for 1500 Miles, we must have all that Shore
to traverse, before we could double the West
Point of it.</P>
<P>He told me, it was ten to one but we should
hear of some <HI>European</HI> Ships to take us in, for
that they often visited the Coast of <HI>Congo</HI> and
<HI>Angola,</HI> in Trade with the Negroes; and that if
we could not, yet, if we could but find Provi∣sions,
we should make our Way as well along
the Sea-Shore, as along the River, till we came
to the Gold Coast, which he said was not above
4 or 500 Miles North of <HI>Congo,</HI> besides the turn∣ing
of the Coast West about 300 more; that
Shore being in the Latitude of six or seven De∣grees,
and that there the <HI>English,</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or
<HI>French,</HI> had Settlements or Factories, perpaps all
of them.</P>
<P>I confess, I had more Mind all the while he ar∣gued,
to have gone Northward, and Shipt our
<PB N="143" REF="145"/>
selves in the <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> or as the Traders call it,
the River <HI>Negro,</HI> or <HI>Niger,</HI> for I knew that at last
it would bring us down to the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI>
where we were sure of Relief; whereas at the
Coast we were going to now, we had a prodigious
Way still to go, either by Sea or Land, and no
Certainly which way to get Provisions but by
Force; but for the present I held my Tongue,
because it was my Tutor's Opinion.</P>
<P>But when, according to his Desire, we came
to turn Southward, having passed beyond the
second great Lake, our Men began all to be uneasy,
and said, we were now out of our Way for cer∣tain,
for that we were going farther from home,
and that we were indeed far enough off al∣ready.</P>
<P>But we had not marched above twelve Days
more, eight whereof was taken up in rounding
the Lake, and four more Southwest, in order to
make for the River <HI>Congo,</HI> but we were put to a∣nother
full Stop, by entring a Country so deso∣late,
so frightful, and so wild, that we knew not
what to think or do; for besidés that it appeared
as a terrible and boundless Desart, having neither
Woods, Trees, Rivers, or Inhabitants; so even
the Place where we were, was desolate of Inhabi∣tants,
nor had we any Way to gather in a Stock
of Provisions for the passing this Desart, as we
did before at our entring the first, unless we had
marched back four Days to the Place where we
turned the Head of the Lake.</P>
<P>Well, notwithstanding this we ventured, for
to Men that had passed such wild Places as we
had done, nothing could seem too desperate to
undertake: We ventured I say, and the rather be∣cause
we saw very high Mountains in our way at a
<PB N="144" REF="146"/>
great Distance, and we imagined, wherever there
was Mountains, there would be Springs and
Rivers, where Rivers, there would be Trees, and
Grass, where Trees, and Grass, there would be
Cattel, and where Cattel, some Kind of Inha∣bitants.</P>
<P>At last, in Consequence of this speculative Phi∣losophy,
we entered this Wast, having a great
Heap of Roots and Plants for our Bread, such as
the <HI>Indians</HI> gave us, a very little Flesh, or Salt,
and but a little Water.</P>
<P>We travelled two Days towards those Hills,
and still they seemed as far off as they did at first,
and it was the fifth Day before we got to them;
indeed we travelled but softly, for it was exces∣sive
hot, and we were much about the very
<HI>Equin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctial</HI> Line, we hardly knew whether to the
South or the North of it.</P>
<P>As we had concluded that, where there were
Hills there would be Springs, so it happened;
but we were not only surprized, but really fright∣ed,
to find the first Spring we came to, and which
looked admirably clear and beautiful, be salt
as Brine: It was a terrible Disappointment to us,
and put us under melancholy Apprehensions at
first; but the Gunner who was of a Spirit never
discouraged, told us we should not be disturbed at
that, but be very thankful, for Salt was a Bait we
stood in as much Need of as any thing, and there
was no Question but we should find fresh Water
as well as Salt; and here our Surgeon steps in
to encourage us, and told us, that if we did not
know, he would shew us a Way how to make that
salt Water fresh, which indeed made us all more
chearful, tho' we wondered what he meant.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="147"/>
Mean time our Men, without bidding, had
been seeking about for other Springs, and found
several, but still they were all salt; from whence
we concluded, that there was a salt Rock or Mi∣neral
Stone in those Mountains, and perhaps they
might be all of such a Substance: But still I won∣dered
by what Witchcraft it was that our Ar∣tist
the Surgeon would make this salt Water
turn fresh, and I long'd to see the Experiment,
which was indeed a very one one; but he went
to Work with as much Assurance, as if he had
try'd it on the very Spot before.</P>
<P>He took two of our large Matts, and sow'd
them togehter, and they made a kind of a Bag
four Foot broad, three Foot and a Half high,
and about a Foot and a Half thick when it was
full.</P>
<P>He caused us to fill this Bag with dry Sand,
and tread it down as close as we could, not to
burst the Matts. When thus the Bag was full
within a Foot, he sought some other Earth, and
filled up the rest with it, and still trod it all in as
hard as he could. When he had done, he made
a Hole in the upper Earth, about as broad as the
Crown of a large Har, or something bigger about,
but not so deep, and bad a Negroe fill it with
Water, and still as it shrunk away, to fill it again,
and keep it full. The Bag he had placed at first
cross two Pieces of Wood, about a Foot from the
Ground, and under it he ordered some of our
Skins to be spread, that would hold Water. In
about an Hour, and not sooner, the Water began
to come dropping thro' the Bottom of the Bag,
and to our great Surprize, was perfect fresh and
sweet; and this continued for several Hours: But
in the End, he Water began to be a little
<PB N="146" REF="148"/>
brackish. When we told him that, Well then,
<HI>said he,</HI> turn the Sand out, and fill it again;
whether he did this by way of Experiment from
his own Fancy, or whether he had seen it done
before, I do not remember.</P>
<P>The next Day we mounted the Tops of the
Hills, where the Prospect was indeed astonishing;
for as far as the Eye could look, South, or
West, or North-West, there was nothing to be
seen but a vast howling Wilderness, with neither
Tree or River, or any green thing. The Surface
we found, as the Part we passed the Day before,
had a kind of thick Moss upon it, of a blackish
dead Colour, but nothing in it that look'd like
Food, either for Man or Beast.</P>
<P>Had we been stored with Provisions to have en∣tred
for ten or twenty Days upon this Wilder∣ness,
as we were formerly, and with fresh Water,
we had Hearts good enough to have ventured;
tho' we had been obliged to come back again; for
if we went North, we did not know but we might
meet with the same; but we neither had Provisi∣ons,
neither were we in any Place where it was
possible to get them. We killed some wild ferine
Creatures at the Foot of these Hills; but except
two things like to nothing that we ever saw
before, we met with nothing that was fit to eat.
These were Creatures that seemed to be between
the Kind of a Buffloe and a Deer, but indeed re∣sembled
neither; for they had no Horns, and had
great Legs like a Cow, with a fine Head, and the
Neck like a Deer. We killed also at several times
a Tiger, two young Lions, and a Wolf, but, God
be thanked, we were not so reduced as to eat
Carrion.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="149"/>
Upon this terrible Prospect I renew'd my Mo∣tion
of turning Northward, and making towards
the River <HI>Niger,</HI> or <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> then to turn West
towards the <HI>English</HI> Settlements on the Gold Coast,
to which every one most readily consented, only
our Gunner, who was indeed our best Guide, tho'
he happen'd to be mistaken at this time. He mo∣ved,
that as our Coast was <HI>now</HI> Northward, so we
might slant away North West, that so by crossing
the Country, we might perhaps meet with some
other River that run into the <HI>Rio Grand</HI> North∣ward,
or down to the Gold Coast Southward, and
so both direct our Way, and shorten the Labour;
as also, because, if any of the Country was inha∣bited
and fruitful, we should probably find it
upon the Shore of the Rivers, where alone we
could be furnished with Provisions.</P>
<P>This was good Advice, and too rational not to
be taken; but our present Business was, what to
do to get out of this dreadful Place we were in;
behind us was a Wast, which had already cost us
five Days March, and we had not Provisions for
five Days left to go back again the same Way.
Before us was nothing but Horrour as above, so
we resolv'd, seeing the Ridge of Hills we were
upon had some Appearance of Fruitfulness, and
that they seemed to lead away to the Northward
a great Way, to keep under the Foot of them
on the East Side, to go on as far as we could,
and in the mean time to look diligently out for
Food.</P>
<P>Accordingly we moved on the next Morning;
for we had no time to lose, and to our great Com∣fort
we came in our first Morning's March to ve∣ry
good Springs of fresh Water; and least we
should have a Scarcity again, we filled all our
<PB N="148" REF="150"/>
Bladder Bottles, and carried it with us. I should
also have observed, that our Surgeon who made
the salt Water fresh, took the Opportunity of
those salt Springs, and made us the Quantity of
three or four Pecks of very good Salt.</P>
<P>In our third March we found an unexpected
Supply of Food, the Hills being full of Hares;
they were of a kind something different from
ours in <HI>England,</HI> larger, and not so swift of Foot,
but very good Meat. We shot several of them,
and the little tame Leopard, which I told you we
took at the Negroe Town that we plundered, hun∣ted
them like a Dog, and killed us several every
Day; but she would eat nothing of them unless we
gave it her, which indeed in our Circumstance
was very obliging. We salted them a little, and
dried them in the Sun whole, and carry'd a strange
Parcel along with us, I think it was almost three
Hundred; for we did not know when we might
find any more, either of these, or any other Food.
We continued our Course under these Hills very
comfortably eight or nine Days, when we found
to our great Satisfaction, the Country beyond us
began to look with something better Counte∣nance.
As for the West Side of the Hills, we
never examin'd it till this Day, when three of our
Company, the rest halting for Refreshment,
mounted the Hills again to satisfy their Curi∣osity,
but found it all the same; nor could they
see any End of it, no not to the North, the Way
we were going; so the tenth Day finding the Hills
made a Turn, and led as it were into the vast De∣sart,
we left them, and continued our Course
North; the Country being very tolerably full of
Woods, some Wast, but not tediously long; till
we came, by our Gunner's Observation, into the
<PB N="149" REF="151"/>
Latitude of 8 Degrees, 5 Minutes, which we
were nineteen Days more a performing.</P>
<P>All this Way we found no Inhabitants, Abun∣dance
of wild ravenous Creatures, with whom
we became so well acquainted now, that really
we did not much mind them. We saw Lions
and Tigers, and Leopards every Night and Mor∣ning
in Abundance; but as they seldom came
near us, we let them go about their Business; if
they offer'd to come near us, we made false Fire
with any Gun that was uncharged, and they
would walk off as soon as they saw the Flash.</P>
<P>We made pretty good Shift for Food all this
Way; for sometimes we killed Hares, sometimes
some Fowls, but for my Life I cannot give Names
to any of them, except a kind of Partridge, and
another that was like our Turtles. Now and then
we began to meet with Elephants again in great
Numbers, those Creatures delighting chiefly in
the woody Part of the Country.</P>
<P>This long continued March fatigued us very
much, and two of our Men fell sick, indeed so
very sick, we thought they would have died; and
one of our Negroes died suddenly. Our Surgeon
said it was an Apoplexy, but <HI>he wondered at it,
he said,</HI> for he could never complain of his high
Feeding. Another of them was very ill, but our
Surgeon with much ado perswading him, indeed
it was almost forcing him, to be let Blood, he re∣cover'd.</P>
<P>We halted here twelve Days for the sake of
our sick Men, and our Surgeon perswaded me,
and three or four more of us, to be let Blood
during the time of Rest, which with other things
he gave us, contributed very much to our conti∣nued
<PB N="150" REF="152"/>
Health, in so tedious a March, and in so hot
a Climate.</P>
<P>In this March we pitched our matted Tents
every Night, and they were very comfortable
to us, tho' we had Trees and Woods to shelter
us also in most Places. We thought it very
strange, that in all this Part of the Country we
yet met with no Inhabitants; but the principal
Reason as we found afterwards was, that we ha∣ving
kept a Western Course first, and then a
Northern Course, were gotten too much into
the Middle of the Country, and among the De∣sarts:
Whereas the Inhabitants are principally
found among the Rivers, Lakes, and Low-Lands
as well to the South-West, as to the North.</P>
<P>What little Rivulets we found here, were so
empty of Water, that except some Pits, and
little more than ordinary Pools, there was
scarce any Water to be seen in them; and they
rather shewed, that during the Rainy Months
they had a Channel, than that they had really
any running Water in them at that time: By
which it was easy for us to judge, that we had
a great Way to go; but this was no Discourage∣ment
so long as we had but Provisions, and some
reasonable Shelter from the violent Heat, which
indeed I thought was much greater now, than
when the Sun was just over our Heads.</P>
<P>Our Men being recovered, we set forward again,
very well stored with Provisions and Water suffi∣cient,
and bending our Course a little to the
Westward of the North, travelled in Hopes of
some favourable Stream which might bear a Ca∣noe;
but we found none till after twenty Days
Travel, including eight Days Rest, for our Men
being weak we rested very often; especially
<PB N="151" REF="153"/>
when we came to Places which were proper for
our Purpose; where we found Cattel, Fowl, or
any thing to kill for our Food. In those twenty
Days March, we advanced four Degrees to the
Northward, besides some Meridian Distance West∣ward,
and we met with Abundance of Elephants,
and with a good Number of Elephants Teeth
scatter'd up and down, here and there, in the
Woody Grounds especially; some of which were
very large. But they were no Booty to us; our
Business was Provisions, and a good Passage out of
the Country; and it had been much move to our
Purpose, to have found a good fat Deer, and to
have killed it for our Food, than a hundred Ton
of Elephants Teeth; and yet as you shall pre∣sently
hear, when we came to begin our Passage
by Water, we once thought to have built a
large Canoe on purpose to have loaded her with
Ivory, but this was when we knew nothing of
the Rivers, nor knew anything how dangerous, and
how difficult a Passage it was that we were like
to have in them, nor had considered the Weight
of Carriage to lug them to the Rivers where
we might Embark.</P>
<P>At the End of twenty Days Travel, as above,
in the Latitude of three Degrees, sixteen Minu∣tes,
we discovered in a Valley, at some Distance
from us, a pretty tolerable Stream, which we
thought deserved the Name of a River, and
which run its Course N. N. W. which was
just what we wanted. As we had sixt our Thoughts
upon our Passage by Water, we took this for the
Place to make the Experiment, and bent our
March directly to the Valley.</P>
<P>There was a small Thicket of Trees just in our
Way, which we went by, thinking no harm,
<PB N="152" REF="154"/>
when on a sudden one of our Negroes was very
dangerously wounded with an Arrow, shot into
his Back slanting between his Shoulders. This
put us to a full Stop, and three of our Men with
two Negroes spreading the Wood, for it was
but a small one, found a Negro with a Bow,
but no Arrow, who would have escaped; but our
Men that discovered him, shot him in Reven∣ge
of the Mischief he had done; so we lost the
Opportunity of taking him Prisoner, which if we
had done, and sent him home with good Usage,
it might have brought others to us in a friendly
Manner.</P>
<P>Going a little farther, we came to five Negro
Hutts or Houses, built after a differing Manner
from any we had seen yet; and at the Door of
one of them, lay seven Elephants Teeth piled
up against the Wall or Side of the Hutt, as if
they had been provided against a Market: Here
were no Men, but seven or eight Women, and
near twenty Children: We offered them no Unci∣vility
or any kind, but gave them every one a
Bit of Silver beaten out thin, as I observed be∣fore,
and cut Diamond fashion, or in the Shape
of a Bird; at which the Women were over-joy'd
and brought out to us several Sorts of Food,
which we did not understand, being Cakes of
a Meal made of Roots, which they bake in the
Sun, and which eat very well. We went a little
Way farther, and pitched our Camp for that
Night, not doubting but our Civility to the
Women would produce some good Effect, when
their Husbands might come Home.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the next Morning, the Women,
with eleven Men, five young Boys, and two good
big Girls, came to our Camp; before they came
<PB N="153" REF="155"/>
quite to us, the Women called aloud, and made
an odd screeking Noise, to bring us out, and
accordingly we came out, when two of the Wo∣men,
shewing us what we had given them, and
pointing to the Company behind, made such
Signs as we could easily understand signified
Friendship. When the Men advanced, having
Bows and Arrows, they laid them down on the
Ground, scraped, and threw Sand over their
Heads, and turned round three times with their
Hands laid up upon the Tops of their Heads.
This it seems, was a solemn Vow of Friendship.
Upon this we beckon'd them with our Hands to
come nearer; then they sent the Boys and Girls
to us first, which, it seems was to bring us more
Cakes of Bread, and some green Herbs, to eat,
which we receiv'd, and took the Boys up and kissed,
them, and the little Girls too; then Men came
up close to us, and sat them down on the Ground,
making Signs, that we should sit down by them,
which we did. They said much to one another,
but we could not understand them, nor could
we find any way to make them understand us;
much less whither we were going, or what we
wanted, only that we easily made them under∣stand
we wanted Victuals; whereupon one of
the Men casting his Eyes about him towards a
rising Ground that was abut half a Mile off,
starts up as if he was frighted, flies to the Place
where they had laid down their Bows and Ar∣rows,
snatches up a Bow and two Arrows, and
run like a race Horse to the Place: When he
came here, he let fly both his Arrows, and
comes back again to us with the same Speed;
we seeing he came with the Bow, but without the
Arrows, were the more inquistive, but the Fellow
<PB N="154" REF="156"/>
saying nothing to us, beckons to one of our Ne∣groes
to come to him, and we bid him go; so he led
him back to the Place, where lay a kind of a Deer,
shot with two Arrows, but not quite dead; and,
between them, they brought it down to us. This
was for a Gift to us, and was very welcome, I
assure you, for our Stock was low. These Peo∣ple
were all stark naked.</P>
<P>The next Day there came about a Hundred
Men to us, and Women, making the same aukward
Signals of Friendship; and dancing and shewing
themselves very well pleased, and any thing they
had they gave us. How the Man in the Wood
came to be so butcherly and rude, as to shoot at
our Men, without making any Breach first, we
could not imagine; for the People were simple,
plain, and inoffensive, in all our other Conversa∣tion
with them.</P>
<P>From hence we went down the Bank of the
little River I mentioned, and where I found we
should see whole Nations of Negroes, but whe∣ther
friendly to us, or not, that we could make
no Judgment of yet.</P>
<P>The River was of no Use to us, as to the Design
of making Canoes, a great while, and we tra∣versed
the Country, on the Edge of it about
five Days more, when our Carpenters finding
the Stream encrease, proposed to pitch our
Tents, and fall to work to make Canoes; but
after we had begun the Work, and cut down
two or three Trees, and spent five Days in the
Labour, some of our Men wandring further
down the River, brought us Word, that the
Stream rather decreased than encreased, sinking
away into the Sands, or drying up by the Heat
of the Sun; so that the River appeared not able
<PB N="155" REF="157"/>
to carry the least Canoe, that could be any way
useful to us, so we were obliged to give over our
Enterprize, and move on.</P>
<P>In our further Prospect this Way, we march'd
three Days full West the Country on the North
Side, being extraodinary mountainous, and more
parched and dry than any we had seen yet;
whereas, in the Part which looks due West, we
found a pleasant Valley, running a great way
between two great Ridges of Mountains: The
Hills look'd frightful, being entirely bare of
Trees or Grass, and even white with the Driness
of the Sand; but in the Valley we had Trees,
Grass, and some Creatures that were fit for
Food, and some Inhabitants.</P>
<P>We past by some of their Hutts or Houses,
and saw People about them, but they run up into
the Hills as soon as they saw us; at the End of
this Valley we met with a peopled Country,
and at first it put us to some doubt, whether
we should go among them, or keep up towards
the Hills Northerly; and as our Aim was prin∣cipally,
as before, to make our Way to the River
<HI>Niger,</HI> we enclined to the latter, pursuing our
Course by the Compass to the N. W. We march'd
thus without Interruption seven Days more,
when we met with a surprizing Circumstance,
much more desolate and disconsolate than our
own, and, which, in time to come, will scarce
seem credible.</P>
<P>We did not much seek the conversing, or ac∣quainting
our selves with the Natives of the
Country, except where we found the Want of
them for our Provision, or their Direction for
our Way; so that whereas we found the Country
here begin to be very populous, especially to∣wards
<PB N="156" REF="158"/>
our left Hand, that is, to the South, we
kept at the more Distance Northerly, still stretch∣ing
towards the West.</P>
<P>In this Tract we found something or other to
killand eat, which always supplied our Necessity,
tho' not so well as we were provided in our first
setting out; being thus, as it were, pushing to
avoid the peopled Country, we at last came to a
very pleasant, agreeable Stream of Water, not
big enough to be called a River, but running to
the N.N.W. which was the very Course we
desired to go.</P>
<P>On the farthest Bank of this Brook we perceiv'd
some Hutts of Negroes not many, and in a little
low Spot of Ground some <HI>Maise</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Corn
growing, which intimated presently to us, that
there were some Inhabitants on that Side, less bar∣barous
than what we had met with in other
Places where we had been.</P>
<P>As we went forward our whole Carravan being
in a Body, our Negroes, who were in the Front,
cry'd out, that they saw a <HI>White Man;</HI> we were not
much surprized at first, it being, as we thought, a
Mistake of the Fellows, and asked them what
they meant; when one of them stept to me,
and pointing to a Hutt on the other Side of the
Hill, I was astonished to see a White Man
indeed, but stark naked, very busy near the
Door of his Hutt, and stooping down to
the Ground with something in his Hand, as if he
had been at some Work, and his back being to∣wards
us, he did not see us.</P>
<P>I gave Notice to our Negroes to make no Noise,
and waited till some more of our Men were come
up, to shew the Sight to them, that they might be
sure I was not mistaken, and we were soon satis∣fied
<PB N="157" REF="159"/>
of the Truth; for the Man having heard
some Noise, started up, and looked full at us,
as much surprized, to be sure, as we were,
but whether with Fear or Hope, we then
knew not.</P>
<P>As he discovered us, so did the rest of the Inha∣bitants
belonging to the Hutts about him, and
all crouded together, looking at us at a Distance:
A little Bottom, in which the Brook ran, lying
between us, the white Man, and all the rest,
as he told us afterwards, not knowing well whe∣ther
they should stay, or run away: However, it
presently came into my Thoughts, that if there
were white Men among them, it would be much
easier for us to make them understand what we
meant, as to Peace or War, than we found it with
others; so tying a Piece of white Rag to the End
of a Stick, we sent two Negroes with it to the
Bank of the Water, carrying the Pole up as
high as they could; it was presently understood,
and two of their Men, and the white Man, came
to the Shore on the other Side.</P>
<P>However, as the white Man spoke no <HI>Portuguese,</HI>
they could understand nothing of one another,
but by Signs; but our Men made the white Man
understand, that they had white Men with
them too, at which they said the white Man
laught. However, to be short, our Men came
back, and told us they were all good Friends,
and in about an Hour four of our Men, two Ne∣groes,
and the Black Prince went to the River
Side, were the white Man came to them.</P>
<P>They had not been half a Quarter of an Hour,
but a Negro came running to me, and told me
the white Man was <HI>Inglese,</HI> as he called him;
upon which I run back, eagerly enough you may
<PB N="158" REF="160"/>
be sure with him, and found as he said, that he
was an <HI>Englishman;</HI> upon which he embraced
me very passionately, the Tears running down
his Face. The first Surprize of his seeing us
was over before we came, but any one may con∣ceive
of it, by the brief Account he gave us after∣wards
of his very unhappy Circumstance; and
of so unexpected a Deliverance, such as perhaps
never happened to any Man in the World; for it
was a Million to one odds, that ever he could
have been relieved; nothing but an Adventure
that never was heard or read of before, could
have suited his Case, unless Heaven by some Mi∣racle
that never was to be expected, had acted
for him.</P>
<P>He appeared to be a Gentleman, not an ordi∣nary
bred Fellow, Seaman, or labouring Man;
this shewed it self in his Behaviour, in the first
Moment of our conversing with him, and in
spight of all the Disadvantages of his miserable
Circumstance.</P>
<P>He was a middle-aged Man, not above 37 or 38,
tho' his Beard was grown exceeding long, and the
Hair of his Head and face strangely covered him
to the Middle of his Back and Breast, he was
white, and his Skin very fine, tho' discoloured,
and in some Places blistered and covered with a
brown blackish Substance, scurfy, scaly, and hard
which was the Effect of the scorching Heat of
the Sun; he was stark naked, and had been so,
as he told us, upwards of two Years.</P>
<P>He was so exceedingly transported at our meet∣ing
with him, that he could scarce enter into
any Discourse at all with us for that Day, and
when he could get away from us for a little,
we saw him walking alone, and shewing all the
<PB N="159" REF="161"/>
most extravagant Tokens of an ungovernable
Joy; and even afterwards he was never without
Tears in his Eyes for several Days, upon the least
Word spoken by us of his Circumstances, or by
him of his Deliverance.</P>
<P>We found his Behaviour the most courteous
and endearing I ever saw in any Man whatever,
and most evident Tokens of a mannerly well∣bred
Person, appeared in all things he did or said;
and our People were exceedingly taken with him.
He was a Scholar, and a Mathematician; he
could not speek <HI>Portuguese</HI> indeed, but he spoke
<HI>Latin</HI> to our Surgeon, <HI>French</HI> to another of our
Men, and <HI>Italian</HI> to a Third.</P>
<P>He had no Leisure in his Thoughts to ask us
whence we came, whither we were going, or
who we were; but would have it always as an
Answer to himself, that to be sure wherever
we were a-going, we came from Heaven, and were
sent on purpose to save him from the most
wretched Condition that ever Man was redu∣ced
to.</P>
<P>Our Men pitching their Camp on the Bank
of a little River opposite to him, he began to
enquire what Store of Provision we had, and
how we proposed to be supplied; when he found
that our Store was but small, he said he would
talk with the Natives, and we should have Pro∣visions
enough; for he said they were the most
courteo us, good natured Part of the Inhabitants
in all that Part of the Country, as, we might
suppose by his living so safe among them.</P>
<P>The first things this Gentleman did for us were
indeed of the greatest Consequence to us; for
first he perfectly informed us where we were,
and which was the properest Course for us to
<PB N="160" REF="162"/>
steer: secondly, he put us in a Way how to fur∣nish
our selves effectually with Provisions; and
Thirdly, he was our compleat Interpreter and
Peace-maker with all the Natives, who now
began to be very numerous about us; and who
were a more fierce and politick People than
those we had met with before; not so easily
terrified with our Arms as those, and not so
ignorant, as to give their Provisions and Corn
forour little Toys, such as I said before our
Artificer made; but as they had frequently traded
and conversed with the <HI>Europeans</HI> on the Coast,
or with other Negro Nations that had traded
and been concerned with them, they were the less
ignorant, and the less fearful, and consequently
nothing was to be had from them but by Ex∣change
for such things as they liked.</P>
<P>This I say of the Negro Natives, which we
soon came among; but as to these poor Peo∣ple
that he lived among, they were not much
acquainted with Things, being at the Distance
of above 300 Miles from the Coast, only that
they found Elephants Teeth upon the Hills to
the North, which they took and carried about
sixty or seventy Miles South, where other trading
Negroes usually met them, and gave them Beads
Glass, Shels, and Cowries for them, such as
the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> and other Traders, furnish
them with from <HI>Europe</HI>.</P>
<P>We now began to be more familiar with our new
Acquaintance; and first, tho' we made but a sorry
Figure as to Clothes our selves, having neither
Shoe, or Stocking, or Glove or Hat among us,
and but very few Shirts, yet as well as we could
we clothed him; and first our Surgeon having
Scissers and Razors, shaved him, and cut his
<PB N="161" REF="163"/>
Hair; a Hat, as I say, we had not in all our Stores,
but he supply'd himself by making himself a cap
of a Piece of a Leopard Skin, most artificially.
As for Shoes or Stockings, he had gone so long
without them, that he cared not even for the Bus∣kins
and Foot-Gloves we wore, which I descri∣bed
above.</P>
<P>As he had been curious to hear the whole Story
of our Travels, and was exceedingly delighted
with the Relation; so we were no less to know,
and pleased with the Account of his Circumstance,
and the History of his coming to that strange
Place alone, and in that Condition, which we
found him in, as above.</P>
<P>This Account of his would indeed be in it self
the Subject of an agreeable History, and would be
as long and as diverting as our own, having in
it many strange and extraordinary Incidents,
but we cannot have Room here to launch out
into so long a Digression; the Sum of his History
was this.</P>
<P>He had been a Factor for the <HI>English Guiney</HI>
Company at <HI>Siera Leon,</HI> or some other of their
Settlements which had been taken by the <HI>French,</HI>
where he had been plundered of all his own Ef∣fects,
as well as of what was intrusted to him by
the Company. Whether it was, that the Com∣pany
did not do him Justice in restoring his Cir∣cumstances,
or in further employing him, he
quitted their Service, and was employed by those
they called Separate Traders; and being after∣wards
out of Employ there also, traded on his
own Account; when passing unwarily into one of
the Company's Settlements, he was either betray'd
into the Hands of some of the Natives, or some
how or other was surprized by them. Howe∣ver,
<PB N="162" REF="164"/>
as they did not kill him, he found Means to
escape from them at that time, and fled to another
Nation of the Natives, who being Enemies to the
other, entertained him friendly, and with them
he lived some time; but not liking his Quarters,
or his Company, he fled again, and several times
changed his Landlords; sometimes was carry'd
by Force, sometimes hurried by Fear, as Cir∣cumstances
altered with him (the Variety of
which deserves a History by it self) till at last
he had wandred beyond all Possibility of Return,
and had taken up his Abode where we found him,
where he was well received by the petty King of
the Tribe he lived with; and he, in Return, in∣structed
them how to value the Product of their
Labour, and on what Terms to trade with those
Negroes who came up to them for Teeth.</P>
<P>As he was naked, and had no Clothes, so he
was naked of Arms for his Defence, having nei∣ther
Gun, Sword, Staff, or any Instrument of
War about him, no not to guard himself against
the Attacks of a wild Beast, of which the Coun∣try
was very full. We asked him how he came
to be so entirely abandoned of all Concern for his
Safety? He answered, That to him that had so
often wish'd for Death, Life was not worth de∣fending;
and that as he was entirely at the Mer∣cy
of the Negroes, they had much the more Con∣fidence
in him, seeing he had no Weapons to hurt
them. As for wild Beasts, he was not much con∣cerned
about that; for he scarce ever went from
his Hutt; but if he did, the Negroe King and
his Men went all with him, and they were all ar∣med
with Bows and Arrows, and Lances, with
which they would kill any of the ravenous Crea∣tures,
Lions as well as others; but that they sel∣dom
<PB N="163" REF="165"/>
came abroad in the Day; and if the Ne∣groes
wander any where in the Night, they al∣ways
build a Hutt for themselves, and make a
Fire at the Door of it, which is Guard enough.</P>
<P>We enquired of him, what we should next do
towards getting to the Sea-side; he told us we
were about 120 <HI>English</HI> Leagues from the Coast,
where almost all the <HI>European</HI> Settlements and
Factories were, and which is called the Gold
Coast; but that there were so many different Na∣tions
of Negroes in the Way, that it was ten to
one if we were not either fought with continu∣ally,
or starv'd for Want of Provisions: But that
there were two other Ways to go, which, if he
had had any Company to go with him, he had often
contrived to make his Escape by. The one was
to travel full West, which, tho' it was farther to
go, yet was not so full of People; and the People
we should find, would be so much the civiller
to us, or be so much the easier to fight with: Or,
that the other Way was, if possible, to get to the
<HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and go down the Stream in Canoes.
We told him, that was the Way we had re∣solved
on before we met with him; but then
he told us, there was a prodigious Desart to go
over, and as prodigious Woods to go thro,' be∣fore
we came to it, and that both together were
at least twenty Days March for us, travel as hard
as we could.</P>
<P>We ask'd him, if there were no Horses in
the Country, or Asses, or even Bullocks or Buf∣floes
to make use of in such a Journey, and we
shewed him ours, of which we had but three left;
he said No, all the Country did not afford any
thing of that kind.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="166"/>
He told us, that in this great Wood there
were innumerable Numbers of Elephants, and
upon the Desart, great Multitudes of Lions,
Linxes, Tygers, and Leopards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that it
was to that Wood, and to that Desart that the
Negroes went to get Elephants Teeth, where
they never failed to find a great Number.</P>
<P>We enquired still more, and particularly the
Way to the Gold Coast, and if there were no
Rivers to ease us in our Carriage; and told
him, as to the Negroes fighting with us, we
were not much concern'd at that; nor were we
afraid of starving; for if they had any Victuals
among them, we would have our Share of it:
And therefore, if he would venture to shew us
the Way, we would venture to go; and as for
himself, we told him we would live and dye
together, there should not a Man of us stir from
him.</P>
<P>He told us, with all his Heart, if we resolv'd
it, and would venture, we might be assured he
would take his Fate with us, and he would en∣deavour
to guide us such a Way, as we should
meet with some friendly Savages who would use
us well, and perhaps stand by us against some
others who were less tractable: So, in a Word,
we all resolved to go full South for the Gold
Coast.</P>
<P>The next Morning he came to us again, and
being all met in Council, as we may call it, he
began to talk very seriously with us, that since
we were now come after a long Journey to a View
of the End of our Troubles, and had been so ob∣liging
to him, as to offer Carrying him with
us, he had been all Night revolving in his
Mind what he and we all might do to make
<PB N="165" REF="167"/>
our selves some Amends for all our Sorrows;
and first he said, he was to let me know, that
we were just then in one of the richest Parts of
the World, tho' it was really otherwise, but a
desolate, disconsolate Wilderness; for says he,
there's not a River here but runs Gold, not a
Desart but without Plowing bears a Crop of Ivo∣ry.
What Mines of Gold, what immense Stores
of Gold those Mountains may contain, from
whence these Rivers come, or the Shores which
these Waters run by, we know not, but may
imagine that they must be inconceivably rich, see∣ing
so much is washed down the Stream by the
Water washing the Sides of the Land, that the
Quantity suffices all the Traders which the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI>
World send thither. We ask'd him how
far they went for it, seeing the Ships only trade
upon the Coast. He told us, that the Negroes
on the Coast search the Rivers up for the Length
of 150 or 200 Miles, and would be out a Month
or two or three at a Time, and always come
Home sufficiently rewarded; but, says he, they
never come thus far, and yet hereabouts is as
much Gold as there. Upon this he told us,
that he believed he might have gotten a Hun∣dred
Pound Weight of Gold, since he came thi∣ther,
if he had employed himself to look and
work for it, but as he knew not what to do
with it, and had long since despaired of being
ever delivered from the Misery he was in, he
had entirely omitted it. For what Advantage
had it been to me, said he, or what richer had
I been, if I had a Ton of Gold Dust, and lay and
wallowed in it; the Richness of it, <HI>said he,</HI> would not
give me one Moment's Felicity, or relieve me in
the present Exigency. Nay, says he, as you all see,
<PB N="166" REF="168"/>
it would not buy me Clothes to cover me, or a
Drop of Drink to save me from perishing. 'Tis
of no Value here, says he; there are several
People among these Hutts that would weigh Gold
against a few Glass Beads, or a Cockle-Shell, and
give you a Handful of Gold Dust for a Hand∣ful
of Cowries. <HI>N.B.</HI> These are little Shells
which our Children call Blackamores Teeth.</P>
<P>When he had said thus, he pulled out a Piece
of an earthen Pot baked hard in the Sun: Here
<HI>says he,</HI> is some of the Dirt of this Country, and
if I would, I could have got a great deal more;
and shewing it to us, I believe there was be∣tween
two and three Pound Weight of Gold Dust,
of the same Kind and Colour with that we had
gotten already, as before. After we had look'd
at it a while, he told us smiling, we were his De∣liverers,
and all he had, as well as his Life, was
ours; and therefore, as this would be of Value
to us when we came to our own Country, so he
desired we would accept of it among us, and that
this was the only time that he had repented
that he had pickt up no more of it.</P>
<P>I spoke for him as his Interpreter to my Com∣rades,
and in their Names thank'd him; but
speaking to them in <HI>Portuguese,</HI> I desired them
to refer the Accepting his Kindness to the next
Morning, and so I did, telling him we would far∣ther
talk of this Part in the Morning; so we
parted for that time.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I found they were all won∣derfully
asfected with his Discourse, and with the
Generosity of his Temper, as well as the Magnifi∣cence
of his Present, which in another Place had
been extraordinary. Upon the whole, not to
detain you with Circumstances, we agreed, that
<PB N="167" REF="169"/>
seeing he was now one of our Number, and that
as we were a Relief to him in carrying him out
of the dismal Condition he was in, so he was
equally a Relief to us, in being our Guide thro'
the rest of the Country, our Interpreter with the
Natives, and our Director how to manage with
the Savages, and how to enrich our selves with
the Wealth of the Country; that therefore we
would put his Gold among our common Stock,
and every one should give him as much as would
make his up just as much as any single Share of
our own, and for the future we would take our
Lot together, taking his solemn Engagement to
us, as we had before one to another, that we
would not conceal the least Grain of Gold we
found, one from another.</P>
<P>In the next Conference we acquainted him with
the Adventures of the Golden River, and how
we had shared what we got there; so that every
Man had a larger Stock than he for his Share;
that therefore insted of taking any from him, we
had resolved every one to add a little to him. He
appeared very glad that we had met with such
good Success, but would not take a Grain from
us, till at last pressing him very hard, he told us,
that then he would take it thus: That when we
came to get any more, he would have so much
out of the first as should make him even, and
then we would go on as equal Adventurers; and
thus we agreed.</P>
<P>He then told us, he thought it would not be
an unprofitable Adventure, if before we set for∣ward,
and after we had got a Stock of Pro∣visions,
we should make a Journey North to the
Edge of the Desart he had told us of, from
whence our Negroes might bring every one a
<PB N="168" REF="170"/>
large Elephant's Tooth, and that he would get
some more to assist; and that after a certain
Length of Carriage, they might be conveyed by
Canoes to the Coast, where they would yield a
very great Profit.</P>
<P>I objected against this, on Account of our other
Design we had of getting Gold Dust; and that
our Negroes, who, we knew would be faithful
to us, would get much more by searching the
Rivers for Gold for us, than by lugging a great
Tooth of an Hundred and sifty Pound Weight, a
Hundred Mile, or more, which would be an
unsufferable Labour to them after so hard a Jour∣ney,
and would certainly kill them.</P>
<P>He acquiesced in the Justice of this Answer,
but fain would have had us gone to see the
woody Part of the Hills, and the Edge of the
Desart, that we might see how the Elephants
Teeth lay scattered up and down there; but
when we told him the Story of what we had seen
before, as is said above, he said no more.</P>
<P>We stay'd here twelve Days, during which
Time the Natives were very obliging to us, and
brought us Fruits, Pompions, and a Root like
Carrots, tho' of quite another Taste, but not
unpleasant neither, and some <HI>Guiney</HI> Fowls whose
Names we did not know. In short, they brought
us Plenty of what they had, and we lived very
well, and we gave them all such little Things as
our Cutler had made, for he had now a whole
Bag full of them.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth Day we set forward, taking
our new Gentleman with us. At Parting, the
Negroe King sent two Savages with a Present
to him, of some dried Flesh, but I do not remem∣ber
what it was, and he gave him again three
<PB N="169" REF="171"/>
Silver Birds which our Cutler help'd him to,
which I assure you was a Present for a King.</P>
<P>We travelled now South, a little West, and
here we found the first River for above 2000
Miles March, whose Water run South, all the
rest running North or West. We followed this
River, which was no bigger than a good large
Brook in <HI>England,</HI> till it began to encrease its
Water. Every now and then we found our <HI>Eng∣lishman</HI>
went down as it were privately to the
Water, which was to try the Land. At Length,
after a Day's March upon this River, he came
running up to us with his Hands full Sand, and
saying <HI>Look here.</HI> Upon looking, we found that a
good deal of Gold lay spangled among the Sand
of the River. Now, says he, I think we may
begin to work; so he divided our Negroes in∣to
Couples, and set them to Work, to search and
wash the Sand and Ooze in the Bottom of the
Water where it was not deep.</P>
<P>In the first Day and a Quarter, our Men all
together had gathered a Pound and two Ounces
of Gold, or thereabouts; and as we found the
Quantity encreased, the farther we went, we
followed it about three Days, till another small
Rivulet join'd the first, and then searching up
the Stream, we found Gold there too; so we
pitch'd our Camp in the Angle where the Ri∣vers
join'd, and we diverted our selves, as I may
call it, in washing the Gold out of the Sand of
the River, and in getting Provisions.</P>
<P>Here we stay'd thirteen Days more, in which
time we had many pleasant Adventures with the
Savages, too long to mention here, and some of
them too homely to tell off; for some of our Men
had made something free with their Women,
<PB N="170" REF="172"/>
which, had not our new Guide made Peace for
us with one of their Men, at the Price of seven
fine Bits of Silver, which our Artificer had cut
out into the Shapes of Lions, and Fishes, and
Birds, and had punch'd Holes to hang them up
by (an inestimable Treasure!) we must have gone
to War with them and all their People.</P>
<P>All the while we were busy washing Gold Dust
out of the Rivers, and our Negroes the like, our
ingenious Cutler was hammering and cutting, and
he was grown so dexterous by Use, that he for∣med
all Manner of Images. He cut out Ele∣phants,
Tygers, Civet Cats, Ostriches, Eagles,
Cranes, Fowls, Fishes, and indeed whatever he
pleased, in thin Plates of hammer'd Gold, for
his Silver and Iron was almost all gone.</P>
<P>At one of the Towns of these Savage Nati∣ons
we were very friendly received by their
King; and as he was very much taken with our
Workman's Toys, he sold him an Elephant cut
out of a Gold Plate as thin as a Six-pence, at
an extravagant Rate. He was so much taken
with it, that he would not be quiet till he had
given him almost a Handful of Gold Dust, as
they call it. I suppose it might weigh three
Quarters of a Pound; the Piece of Gold that
the Elephant was made of, might be about the
Weight of a Pistole, rather less than more. Our
Artist was so honest, tho' the Labour and Art was
all his own, that he brought all the Gold, and
put it into our common Stock: But we had indeed
no Manner of Reason in the least to be cove∣tous;
for, as our new Guide told us, we that
were strong enough to defend our selves, and
had Time enough to stay (for we were none of
us in Haste) might in time get together what
<PB N="171" REF="173"/>
Quantity of Gold we pleased, even to an Hun∣dred
Pound Weight a Man, if we thought fit; and
therefore he told us, tho' he had as much Reason
to be sick of the Country as any of us, yet if we
thought to turn our March a little to the South-East,
and pitch upon a Place proper for our
Head Quarters, we might find Provisions plenty
enough, and extend our selves over the Country
among the Rivers for two or three Year to the
Right and Left, and we should soon find the Ad∣vantage
of it.</P>
<P>The Proposal, however good as to the profita∣ble
Part of it, suited none of us; for we were all
more desirous to get Home, than to be rich, be∣ing
tired of the excessive Fatigue of above a Year's
continual Wandring among Desarts and wild
Beasts.</P>
<P>However, the Tongue of our new Acquain∣tance
had a Kind of Charm in it, and used
such Arguments, and had so much the Power of
Perswasion, that there was no resisting him. He
told us, it was preposterous not to take the Fruit
of all our Labours, now we were come to the
Harvest; that we might see the Hazard the
<HI>Europeans</HI> run, with Ships and Men, and at great
Expence, to fetch a little Gold; and that we
that were in the Center of it, to go away em∣pty
handed, was unaccountable; that we were
strong enough to fight our Way thro' whole
Nations, and might make our Journey afterward
to what Part of the Coast we pleased; and we
should never forgive our selves when we came
to our own Country, to see we had 500 Pistoles
in Gold, and might as easily have had 5000, or
10000, or what we pleased; that he was no more
covetous than we, but seeing it was in all our

Powers to retrieve our Misfortunes at once, and
to make our selves easy for all our Lives, he
could not be faithful to us, or grateful for the
Good we had done him, if he did not let us see
the Advantage we had in our Hands; and he
assured us, he would make it clear to our own
Understanding, that we might in two Years time,
by good Management, and by the Help of our
Negroes, gather every Man a Hundred Pound
Weight of Gold, and get together perhaps two
Hundred Ton of Teeth: Whereas, if once we
push'd on to the Coast, and separated, we should
never be able to see that Place again with our
Eyes, or do any more than Sinners did with Hea∣ven,
wish themselves there, but know they can
never come at it.</P>
<P>Our Surgeon was the first Man that yielded to
his Reasoning, and after him the Gunner; and
they two indeed had a great Influence over us, but
none of the rest had any Mind to stay, nor I nei∣ther,
I must confess; for I had no Notion of a
great deal of Money, or what to do with my self,
or what to do with it if I had it. I thought I had
enough already, and all the Thoughts I had about
disposing of it, if I came to <HI>Europe,</HI> was only how
to spend it as fast as I could, buy me some Clothes,
and go to Sea again to be a Drudge for more.</P>
<P>However, he prevailed with us by his good
Words at last, to stay but for six Months in the
Country, and then, if we did resolve to go, he
would submit: So at length we yielded to that,
and he carry'd us about fifty <HI>English</HI> Miles South-East,
where we found several Rivulets of Water,
which seem'd to come all from a great Ridge of
Mountains, which lay to the North-East, and
which, by our Calculation, must be the Beginning
<PB N="173" REF="175"/>
that Way of the great Wast, which we had been
forc'd Northward to avoid.</P>
<P>Here we found the Country barren enough,
but yet we had, by his Direction, Plenty of Food;
for the Savages round us, upon giving them some
of our Toys, as I have so often mentioned, brought
us in whatever they had: And here we found
some Maise, or <HI>Indian</HI> Wheat, which the Negroe
Women planted, as we sow Seeds in a Garden,
and immediately our new Proveditor ordered
some of our Negroes to plant it, and it grew up
presently, and by watering it often, we had a
Crop in less than three Months Growth.</P>
<P>As soon as we were settled, and our Camp
fix'd, we fell to the old Trade of Fishing for Gold
in the Rivers mentioned above; and our <HI>English</HI>
Gentleman so well knew how to direct our Search,
that we scarce ever lost our Labour.</P>
<P>One time, having set us to Work, he asked, if
we would give him Leave, with four or five Ne∣groes,
to go out for six or seven Days, to seek his
Fortune, and see what he could discover in the
Country, assuring us, whatever he got should be
for the publick Stock. We all gave him our Con∣sent,
lent him a Gun; and two of our Men de∣siring
to go with him, they took then six Ne∣groes
with them, and two of our Buffloes that
came with us the whole Journey; they took about
eight Days Provision of Bread with them, but
no Flesh, except about as much dried Flesh as
would serve them two Days.</P>
<P>They travelled up to the Top of the Moun∣tains
I mentioned just now, where they saw, (as
our Men afterwards vouch'd it to be) the same
Desart which we were so justly terrified at, when
we were on the further Side, and which, by our
<PB N="174" REF="176"/>
Calculation, could not be less than 300 Miles
broad, and above 600 Miles in Length, without
knowing where it ended.</P>
<P>The Journal of their Travels is too long to
enter upon here; they stayed out two and fifty
Days, when they brought us seventeen Pound,
and something more (for we had no exact Weight)
of Gold Dust, some of it in much larger Pieces
than any we found before; besides about fifteen
Ton of Elephants Teeth, which he had, partly
by good Usage, and partly by bad, obliged the
Savages of the Country to fetch, and bring down
to him from the Mountains, and which he made
others bring with him quite down to our Camp.
Indeed we wondered what was coming to us,
when we saw him attended with above 200 Ne∣groes;
but he soon undeceived us, when he made
them all throw down their Burthens on a Heap,
at the Entrance of our Camp.</P>
<P>Besides this, they brought two Lions Skins,
and five Leopards Skins, very large and very fine.
He asked our Pardon for his long Stay, and that
he had made no greater a Booty, but told us, he
had one Excursion more to make, which he hop'd
should turn to a better Account.</P>
<P>So having rested himself, and rewarded the
Savages that brought the Teeth for him, with
some Bits of Silver and Iron cut out Diamond
Fashion, and with two shap'd like little Dogs, he
sent them away mightily pleased.</P>
<P>The second Journey he went, some more of
our Men desired to go with him, and they made
a Troop of ten white Men, and ten Savages, and
the two Buffloes to carry their Provisions and
Ammunition. They took the same Course, on∣ly
not exactly the same Tract, and they stay'd
<PB N="175" REF="177"/>
thirty two Days only, in which time they killed
no less than fifteen Leopards, three Lions, and
several other Creatures, and brought us Home
four and twenty Pound, some Ounces of Gold
Dust, and only six Elephants Teeth, but they
were very great ones.</P>
<P>Our Friend the <HI>Englishman</HI> shewed us now, that
our Time was well bestow'd; for in five Months
which we had stayed here, we had gathered so
much Gold Dust, that when we came to share it,
we had five Pound and Quarter to a Man, be∣sides
what we had before, and besides six or seven
Pound Weight which we had at several times gi∣ven
our Artificer to make Baubles with; and now
we talk'd of going forward to the Coast, to put
an End to our Journey; but our Guide laught at
us then: Nay you can't go now, <HI>says he;</HI> for the
rainy Season beings next Month, and there will
be no stirring then. This we found indeed rea∣sonable,
so we resolved to furnish our selves with
Provisions that we might not be obliged to go
abroad too much in the Rain, and we spread our
selves some one Way, some another, as far as
we cared to venture, to get Provisions, and our
Negroes killed us some Deer which we cured
as well as we could, in the Sun, for we had now
no Salt.</P>
<P>By this time the rainy Months were set in,
and we could scarce, for above two Months,
look out of our Hutts. But that was not all, for
the Rivers were so swelled with the Land Floods
that we scarce knew the little Brooks and Rivu∣lets
from the great navigable Rivers. This had
been a very good Opportunity for to have con∣vey'd
by Water, upon Rafts, our Elephants
Teeth, of which we had a very great Pile; for
<PB N="176" REF="178"/>
as we always gave the Savages some Reward for
their Labour, the very Women would bring us
Teeth upon every Opportunity, and sometimes a
great Tooth carried between two; so that our
Quantity was encreased to about two and twenty
Ton of Teeth.</P>
<P>As soon as the Weather proved fair again, he
told us he would not press us to any further Stay,
since we did not care whether we got any more
Gold or no; that we were indeed the first Men
ever he met with in his Life, that said they had
Gold enough, and of whom it might be truly said,
that when it lay under our Feet, we would
not stoop to take it up. But since he had made
us a Promise, he would not break it, nor press
us to make any farther Stay, only he thought
he ought to tell us, that now was the Time,
after the Land Flood, when the greatest Quan∣tity
of Gold was found; and that if we stayed
but one Month, we should see Thousands of Sava∣ges
spread themselves over the whole Country,
to wash the Gold out of the Sand, for the <HI>Euro∣pean</HI>
Ships who would come on the Coast; that they
do it then, because the Rage of the Floods always
works down a great deal of Gold out of the
Hills; and if we took the Advantage to be there
before them, we did not know what extraordi∣nary
things we might find.</P>
<P>This was so forcible, and so well argued, that
it appeared in all our Faces we were prevailed
upon; so we told him we would all stay: For
tho' it was true we were all eager to be gone, yet
the evident Prospect of so much Advantage,
could not well be resisted: That he was greatly
mistaken when he suggested, that we did not de∣sire
to encrease our Store of Gold, and in that
<PB N="177" REF="179"/>
we were resolved to make the utmost Use of the
Advantage that was in our Hands, and would
stay as long as any Gold was to be had, if it was
another Year.</P>
<P>He could hardly express the Joy he was in on
this Occasion, and the fair Weather coming on,
we began just as he directed, to search about
the Rivers for more Gold; at first we had but
little Encouragement, and began to be doubtful,
but it was very plain that the Reason was the
Water was not fully fallen, or the Rivers reduced
to there usual Channel; but in a few Days we
were fully requited, and found much more Gold
than at first, and in bigger Lumps; and one of
our Men washed out of the Sand a Piece of Gold
as big as a small Nut, which weighed, by our Esti∣mation,
for we had no small Weights, almost an
Ounce and half.</P>
<P>This Success made us extreamly diligent, and
in little more than a Month, we had all together
gotten near sixty Pound Weight of Gold;
but after this, as he told us, we found Abun∣dance
of the Savages, both Men, Women and
Children, hunting every River and Brook, and
even the dry Land of the Hills for Gold, so that
we could do nothing like then, compared to what
we had done before.</P>
<P>But our Artificer found a Way to make other
People find us in Gold without our own Labour;
for when these People began to appear, he had a
considerable Quantity of his Toys, Birds, Beasts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> such as before, ready for them, and the <HI>English</HI>
Gentleman being the Interpreter, he brought the
Savages to admire them; so our Cutler had Trade
enough; and to be sure sold his Goods at a mon∣strous
Rate; for he would get an Ounce of Gold,
<PB N="178" REF="180"/>
sometimes two, for a Bit of Silver, perhaps of
the Value of a Groat, nay if it were Iron; and if
it was of Gold, they would not give the more
for it; and it was incredible almost to think
what a Quantity of Gold he got that Way.</P>
<P>In a Word, to bring this happy Journey to a
Conclusion, we encreased our Stock of Gold here
in three Months Stay more, to such a Degree,
that bringing it all to a common Stock, in order
to Share it, we divided almost four Pound Weight
again to every Man, and then we set forward
for the Gold Coast, to see what Method we
could find out for our Passage into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There happened several very remarkable Inci∣dents
in this Part of our Journey, as to how we
were, or were not, received friendly, by the several
Nations of Savages through whom we past; how
we delivered one Negroe King from Captivity,
who had been a Benefactor to our new Guide;
and how our Guide in Gratitude, by our Assist∣ance,
restored him to his Kingdom, which perhaps
might contain about 300 Subjects; how he enter∣tained
us; and how he made his Subjects go with
our <HI>Englishman,</HI> and fetch all our Elephants
Teeth, which we had been obliged to leave be∣hind
us, and to carry them for us to the River,
the Name of which I forgot, where we made
Rafts, and in eleven Days more came down to
one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Settlements on the Gold Coast,
where we arrived in perfect Health, and to our
great Satisfaction. As for our Cargo of Teeth,
we sold it to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, and received
Clothes and other Necessaries for our selves, and
such of our Negroes as we thought fit to keep
with us; and it is to be observed, that we had
four Pound of Gunpowder left when we ended our
<PB N="179" REF="181"/>
Journey. The <HI>Negro Prince</HI> we made perfectly
free, clothed him out of our common Stock,
and gave him a Pound and a half of Gold for
himself, which he knew very well how to mana∣ge,
and here we all parted after the most friendly
Manner possible. Our <HI>Englishman</HI> remained in the
<HI>Dutch</HI> Factory some time, and, as I heard after∣wards,
died there of Grief; for he having sent a
Thousand Pound Sterling over to <HI>England</HI> by the
Way of <HI>Holland,</HI> for his Refuge, at his Return
to his Friends, the Ship was taken by the <HI>French,</HI>
and the Effects all lost.</P>
<P>The rest of my Comrades went away in a
small Bark, to the two <HI>Portuguese</HI> Factories, near
<HI>Gambia,</HI> in the Latitude of fourteen; and I with
two Negroes which I kept with me, went away
to <HI>Cape Coast Castle,</HI> where I got Passage for <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and arrived there in <HI>September;</HI> and thus
ended my first Harvest of <HI>Wild Oats,</HI> the rest
were not sowed to so much Advantage.</P>
<P>I had neither Friend, Relation, nor Acquain∣tance
in <HI>England,</HI> tho' it was my Native Coun∣try,
I had consequently no Person to trust with
what I had, or to counsel me to secure or save
it; but falling into ill Company, and trusting the
Keeper of a Publick House in <HI>Rotherhith</HI> with a
great Part of my Money, and hastily squander∣ing
away the rest, all that great Sum, which I
got with so much Pains and Hazard, was gone
in little more than two Years Time; and as I even
rage in my own Thoughts to reflect upon the
Manner how it was wasted, so I need record no
more; the rest Merits to be conceal'd with Blushes,
for that it was spent in all Kinds of Folly and
Wickedness, so this Scene of my Life may be said
<PB N="180" REF="182"/>
to have begun in Theft, and ended in Luxury; a
sad Setting out, and a worse Coming home.</P>
<P>About the Year I began to see the Bottom
of my Stock, and that it was Time to think
of farther Adventures, for my Spoilers, as I
call them, began to let me know, that as my
Money declined, their Respect would ebb with it,
and that I had nothing to expect of them farther
than as I might command it by the Force of my
Money, which in short would not go an Inch the
farther, for all that had been spent in their Fa∣vour
before.</P>
<P>This shocked me very much, and I conceived a
just Abhorrence of their Ingratitude; but it
wore off; nor had I with it any Regret at the wa∣sting
so glorious a Sum of Money, as I brought
to <HI>England</HI> with me.</P>
<P>I next shipped my self, in an evil Hour to be
sure, on a Voyage to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> in a Ship called the
and in the Course of our Voyage, being
on the Coast of <HI>Spain,</HI> was obliged to put in to
the <HI>Groyn,</HI> by a strong South West Wind.</P>
<P>Here I fell into Company with some Masters
of Mischief, and among them, one forwarder
than the rest, began an intimate Confidence with
me, so that we called one another Brothers, and
communicated all our Circumstances to one an∣other;
his Name was <HI>Harris.</HI> This Fellow came to
me one Morning, asking me if I would go on Shore,
and I agreed; so we got the Captain's Leave
for the Boat, and went together. When we were
together, he asked me if I had a Mind for an Ad∣venture
that might make amends for all past
Misfortunes; I told him yes, with all my Heart;
for I did not care where I went, having nothing
to lose, and no Body to leave behind me.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="183"/>
He then asked me if I would swear to be se∣cret,
and that if I did not agree to what he pro∣posed,
I would nevertheless never betray him;
I readily bound my self to that, upon the most
solemn Imprecations and Curses that the Devil
and both of us could invent.</P>
<P>He told me then, there was a brave Fellow in
the other Ship, pointing to another <HI>English</HI>
Ship which rode in the Harbour, who in Con∣cert
with some of the Men had resolved to muti∣ny
the next Morning, and run away with the
Ship; and that if we could get Strength enough
among our Ship's Company we might do the same.
I liked the Proposal very well, and he got eight
of us to join with him, and he told us, that as
soon as his Friend had begun the Work, and was
Master of the Ship, we should be ready to do
the like; this was his Plot, and I without the
least Hesitation, either at the Villainy of the Fact,
or the Difficulty of performing it, came imme∣diately
into the wicked Conspiracy, and so it
went on among us; but we could not bring our
Part to Perfection.</P>
<P>Accordingly on the Day appointed, his Cor∣respondent
in the other Ship, whose Name was
<HI>Wilmot,</HI> began the Work, and having seized the
Captain's Mate, and other Officers, secured the
Ship, and gave the Signal to us; we were but
eleven in our Ship, who were in the Conspiracy,
nor could we get any more that we could trust,
so that leaving the Ship, we all took the Boat
and went off to join the other.</P>
<P>Having thus left the Ship I was in, we were
entertained with a great deal of Joy by Captain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> and his new Gang; and being well pre∣pared
for all manner of Roguery, bold, despe∣rate,
<PB N="182" REF="184"/>
I mean my self, without the least Checks
of Conscience, for what I was entred upon, or
for any Thing I might do, much less with any
Apprehension of what might be the Conse∣quence
of it; I say, having thus embarked with
this Crew, which at last brought me to consort
with the most famous Pyrates of the Age, some of
whom have ended their Journals at the Gallows:
I think the giving an Account of some of my
other Adventures may be an agreeable Piece
of Story; and this I may venture to say before
Hand, upon the Word of a PYRATE, that I
shall not be able to recollect the full, no not by
far, of the great Variety which has formed one
of the most reprobate Schemes that ever Man was
capable to present to the World.</P>
<P>I that was, as I have hinted before, an original
Thief, and a Pyrate even by Inclination before,
was now in my Element, and never undertook
any Thing in my Life with more particular Sa∣tisfaction.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> for so we are now to call him,
being thus possessed of a Ship, and in the Manner
as you have heard, it may be easily concluded
he had nothing to do to stay in the Port, or to
wait either the Attempts which might be made
from the Shore, or any Change which might
happen among his Men. On the Contrary, we
weighed Anchor the same Tide, and stood out to
Sea, steering away for the <HI>Canaries.</HI> Our Ship
had Twenty Two Guns, but was able to carry
Thirty; and besides, as she was fitted out for a
Merchant Ship only, she was not furnished either
with Ammunition or small Arms sufficient for
our Design, or for the Occasion we might have
in Case of a Fight; so we put into <HI>Cadiz,</HI> that is
<PB N="183" REF="185"/>
to say, we came to an Anchor in the Bay; and the
Captain and one whom we call'd young Captain
<HI>Kid,</HI> who was the Gunner, and some of the Men
who could best be trusted, among whom was my
Comrade <HI>Harris,</HI> who was made second Mate,
and my self who was made a Lieutenant; some
Bales of <HI>English</HI> Goods were proposed to be car∣ried
on Shore with us for Sale; but my Comrade,
who was a compleat Fellow at his Business, pro∣posed
a better Way for it; and having been in
the Town before, told us in short, that he would
buy what Powder and Bullet, small Arms, or
any thing else we wanted, on his own Word, to
be paid for when they came on Board, in such
<HI>English</HI> Goods as we had there. This was by much
the best Way, and accordingly he and the Cap∣tain
went on Shore by themselves, and having made
such a Bargain as they found for their Turn, came
away again in two Hours time, and bringing on∣ly
a Butt of Wine, and five Casks of Brandy with
them, we all went on Board again.</P>
<P>The next Morning two Barco Longo's came
off to us deep loaden, with five <HI>Spaniards</HI> on board
them, for Traffick. Our Captain sold them good.
Penny worths, and they delivered us sixteen Bar∣rels
of Powder, twelve small Runlets of fine Pow∣der
for our small Arms, sixty Musquets, and
twelve Fuzees for the Officers; seventeen Ton of
Cannon Ball, fifteen Barrels of MusquetBullets,
with some Swords, and twenty good Pair of Pi∣stols.
Besides this, they brought thirteen Butts
of Wine (for we that were now all become Gen∣tlemen
scorn'd to drink the Ship's Beer) also six∣teen
Puncheons of Brandy, with twelve Barrels
of Raisins, and twenty Chests of Lemons: All
which were paid for in <HI>English</HI> Goods; and over
<PB N="184" REF="186"/>
and above, the Captain received 600 Pieces of
Eight in Money. They would have come again,
but we would stay no longer.</P>
<P>From hence we sailed to the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and from
thence onward to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> where we com∣mitted
some Depredation upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for
Provision, and took some Prizes, but none of
any great Value, while I remained with them,
which was not long at that Time; for having
taken a <HI>Spanish</HI> Sloop on the Coast of <HI>Cartagena,</HI>
my Friend made a Motion to me, that we should
desire Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> to put us into the Sloop,
with a Proportion of Arms and Ammunition,
and let us try what we could do; she being much
fitter for our Business than the great Ship, and a
better Sailer. This he consented to, and we ap∣pointed
our Rendezvous at <HI>Tobago,</HI> making an
Agreement, that whatever was taken by either of
our Ships, should be shared among the Ship's
Company of both; all which we very punctually
observed, and join'd our Ships again about fifteen
Months after, at the Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI> as above.</P>
<P>We cruised near two Years in those Seas, chief∣ly
upon the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> not that we made any Dif∣ficulty
of taking <HI>English</HI> Ships, or <HI>Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI>
if they came in our Way; and particularly Cap∣tain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> attack'd a <HI>New-England</HI> Ship bound
from the <HI>Maderas</HI> to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and another bound
from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Berbadoes,</HI> with Provisions;
which last was a very happy Supply to us. But
the Reason why we meddled as little with <HI>English</HI>
Vessels as we could, was, first, because, if they
were Ships of any Force, we were sure of more
Resistance from them; and secondly, because we
found the <HI>English</HI> Ships had less Booty when taken;
for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> generally had Money on board,
<PB N="185" REF="187"/>
and that was what we best knew what to do with.
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> was indeed more particularly
cruel when he took any <HI>English</HI> Vessel, that they
might not too soon have Advice of him in <HI>England,</HI>
and so the Men of War have Orders to look out
for him. But this Part I bury in Silence for the
present.</P>
<P>We encreased our Stock in these two Years
considerably, having taken 60000 Pieces of Eight
in one Vessel, and 100000 in another; and being
thus first grown rich, we resolved to be strong
too; for we had taken a Brigantine built at <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI>
an excellent Sea Boat, and a good Sailer, and
able to carry twelve Guns; and a large <HI>Spanish</HI>
Frigat-built Ship, that sailed incomparably well
also, and which afterwards, by the Help of good
Carpenters, we fitted up to carry twenty eight
Guns. And now we wanted more Hands, so we
put away for the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> not doubting
we should ship as many Men there as we plea∣sed,
and so we did.</P>
<P>Here we sold the Sloop that I was in; and
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> keeping his own Ship, I took the
Command of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Frigat, as Captain, and
my Comrade <HI>Harris</HI> as eldest Lieutenant, and a
bold enterprizing Fellow he was as any the World
afforded. One <HI>Culverdine</HI> was put into the Brigan∣tine,
so that we were now three stout Ships, well
Mann'd, and Victualled for twelve Months; for
we had taken two or three Sloops from <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI>
and <HI>New-York,</HI> loaden with Flour, Pease,
and Barrell'd Beef, and Pork, going for <HI>Jamaica</HI>
and <HI>Berbadoes;</HI> and for more Beef we went on
Shore on the Isle of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where we killed as many
black Cattel as we pleased, tho' we had very little
Salt to cure them.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="188"/>
Out of all the Prizes we took here, we took
their Powder and Bullet, their small Arms and
Cutlasses; and as for their Men, we always took
the Surgeon and the Carpenter, as Persons who
were of particular Use to us upon many Occasi∣ons;
nor were they always unwilling to go with
us, tho' for their own Security, in Case of Acci∣dents,
they might easily pretend they were car∣ried
away by Force, of which I shall give a plea∣sant
Account in the Course of my other Expe∣ditions.</P>
<P>We had one very merry Fellow here, a Qua∣ker,
whose Name was <HI>William Walters,</HI> whom we
took out of a Sloop bound from <HI>Pensilvania</HI> to
<HI>Berbadoes.</HI> He was a Surgeon, and they called
him Doctor; but he was not employed in the
Sloop as a Surgeon, but was going to <HI>Berbadoes</HI>
to get a <HI>Birth,</HI> as the Sailors call it. However,
he had all his Surgeon's Chest on board, and we
made him go with us, and take all his Implements
with him. He was a comick Fellow indeed, a
Man of very good solid Sense, and an excellent
Surgeon; but what was worth all, very good hu∣mour'd
and pleasant in his Conversation, and a
bold, stout, brave Fellow too, as any we had
among us.</P>
<P>I found <HI>William,</HI> as I thought, not very averse
to go along with us, and yet resolved to do it
so, that it might be apparent he was taken away
by Force; and to this Purpose he comes to me,
Friend, says he, thou sayest I must go with thee,
and it is not in my Power to resist thee, if I
would; but I desire thou wilt oblige the Master
of the Sloop which I am on board, to certify un∣der
his Hand that I was taken away by Force,
and against my Will; and this he said with so
<PB N="187" REF="189"/>
much Satisfaction in his Face, that I could not
but understand him. Ay, ay, <HI>says I,</HI> whether
it be against your Will, or no, I'll make him and
all the Men give you a Certificate of it, or I'll take
them all along with us, and keep them till they
do: So I drew up the Certificate my self, where∣in
I wrote that he was taken away by main Force,
as a Prisoner, by a Pyrate Ship; that they carried
away his Chest and Instruments first, and then
bound his Hands behind him, and forced him
into their Boat; and this was signed by the Ma∣ster
and all his Men.</P>
<P>Accordingly I fell a swearing at him, and cal∣led
to my Men to tye his Hands behind him, and
so we put him into our Boat, and carry'd him
away. When I had him on board, I called him
to me: Now, Friend, says I, I have brought you
away by Force, it is true, but I am not of the
Opinion I have brought you away so much against
your Will as they imagine: Come, says I, you
will be a useful Man to us, and you shall have ve∣ry
good Usage among us; so I unbound his Hands,
and first ordered all things that belonged to him
to be restored to him, and our Captain gave
him a Dram.</P>
<P>Thou hast dealt friendly by me, says he, and
I'll be plain with thee, whether I came willingly
to thee, or not: I shall make my self as useful
to thee as I can; but thou knowest it is not
my Business to meddle when thou art to fight.
No, no, says the Captain, but you may meddle a
little when we share the Money. Those things
are useful to furnish a Surgeon's Chest, says
<HI>William,</HI> and smiled; but I shall be moderate.</P>
<P>In short, <HI>William</HI> was a most agreeable Compa∣nion,
but he had the better of us in this Part,
<PB N="188" REF="190"/>
that, if we were taken, we were sure to be
hang'd, and he was sure to escape; and he knew
it well enough: But in short he was a sprightly
Fellow, and fitter to be Captain than any of
us. I shall have often an Occasion to speak of
him in the rest of the Story.</P>
<P>Our Cruising so long in these Seas began now
to be so well known, that not in <HI>England</HI> only,
but in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> Accounts had been made
publick of our Adventures, and many Stories told
how we murthered the People in cold Blood,
tying them Back to Back, and throwing them in∣to
the Sea; one Half of which however was not
true, tho' more was done than it is fit to speak
of here.</P>
<P>The Consequence of this however was, that
several <HI>English</HI> Men of War were sent to the
<HI>West Indies,</HI> and were particularly instructed to
cruize in the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and the Gulph of
<HI>Florida,</HI> and among the <HI>Bahama</HI> Islands, if possi∣ble,
to attack us.</P>
<P>We were not so ignorant of things, as not to
expect this, after so long a Stay in that Part of
the World; but the first certain Account we had
of them, was at the <HI>Honduras,</HI> when a Vessel co∣ming
in from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> told us, that two <HI>English</HI>
Men of War were coming directly from <HI>Jamaica</HI>
thither, in Quest of us. We were indeed as it were
embay'd, and could not have made the least Shift
to have got off, if they had come directly to us;
but as it happen'd, some body had informed them
that we were in the Bay of <HI>Campeachy,</HI> and they
went directly thither, by which we were not
only free of them, but were so much to the
Windward of them, that they could not make
<PB N="189" REF="191"/>
any Attempt upon us, tho' they had known we
were there.</P>
<P>We took this Advantage, and stood away for
<HI>Carthagena,</HI> and from thence with great Difficulty
beat it up at a Distance from under the Shore for
St. <HI>Martha,</HI> tillwe came to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Island of <HI>Curasoe,</HI>
and from thence to the Island of <HI>Tobago;</HI> which, as
before, was our Rendezvous; which being a deser∣ted
uninhabited Island, we at the same time made
use of for a Retreat: Here the Captain of the <HI>Bri∣gantine</HI>
died, and Captain <HI>Harris</HI> at that time my
Lieutenant, took the Command of the <HI>Bri∣gantine.</HI></P>
<P>Here we came to a Resolution, to go away to
the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> and from thence to the Cape
of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and so for the <HI>East-Indies:</HI> But
Captain <HI>Harris,</HI> as I have said, being now Cap∣tain
of the <HI>Brigantine,</HI> alledged that his Ship
was too small for so long a Voyage; but that if
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> would consent, he would take
the Hazard of another Cruize, and he would fol∣low
us in the first Ship he could take: So we
appointed our Rendezvous to be at <HI>Madagascar,</HI>
which was done by my Recommendation of the
Place, and the Plenty of Provisions to be had
there.</P>
<P>Accordingly he went away from us <HI>in an evil
Hour,</HI> for instead of taking a Ship to follow us,
he was taken, as I heard afterwards, by an <HI>English</HI>
Man of War, and being laid in Irons, died of
meer Grief and Anger before he came to <HI>England:</HI>
His Lieutenant, I have heard, was afterwards exe∣cuted
in <HI>England</HI> for a Pyrate, and this was the
End of the Man who first brought me into this
unhappy Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="192"/>
We parted from <HI>Tobago</HI> three Days after, bend∣ing
our Course for the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> but had
not been at Sea above Twenty Four Hours,
when we were separated by a terrible Storm,
which held three Days, with very little Abate∣ment
or Intermission. In this Juncture, Captain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> happen'd unluckily to be on board my
Ship, very much to his Mortification; for we
not only lost Sight of his Ship, but never saw
her more, till we came to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> where
she was cast away. In short, after having in this
Tempest lost our Fore-Top Mast, we were forced
to put back to the Isle of <HI>Tobago</HI> for Shelter,
and to repair our Damage, which brought us all
very near our Destruction.</P>
<P>We were no sooner on Shore here, and all very
busy looking out for a Piece of Timber for a
Top-Mast, but we perceived standing in for the
Shore, an <HI>English</HI> Man of War of Thirty six
Guns: It was a great Surprize to us indeed, because
we were disabled so much, but to our great good
Fortune we lay pretty snug and close among the
high Rocks, and the Man of War did not see us,
but stood off again upon his Cruise; so we only
observed which Way she went, and at Night
leaving our Work, resolved to stand off to Sea,
steering contrary Way from that which we
observed she went. And this we found had
the desired Success, for we saw him no more:
We had gotten an old Mizen Top-Mast on board,
which made us a Jury Fore-Top-Mast for the
present, and so we stood away for the Isle <HI>Tri∣nidad,</HI>
where, though there were <HI>Spaniards</HI> on
Shore, yet we landed some Men with our Boat,
and cut a very good Piece of Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to make us a
<PB N="191" REF="193"/>
new Top-Mast, which we got sitted up effectually,
and also we got some Cattle here to eke out our
Provisions, and calling a Council of War among
our selves, we resolved to quit those Seas for the
present, and steer away for the Coast of <HI>Brasil.</HI></P>
<P>The first thing we attempted here, was only
getting fresh Water; but we learnt, that there
lay the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Fleet at the Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI>
bound for <HI>Lisbon,</HI> ready to sail, and only waited
for a fair Wind; this made us lye by, wishing to
see them put to Sea, and accordingly as they
were, with, or without Convoy, to attack or avoid
them.</P>
<P>It sprung up a fresh Gale in the Evening, at
S. W. by W. which being fair for the <HI>Portugal</HI> Fleet,
and the Weather pleasant and agreeable, we
heard the Signal given to unmore, and running
in under the Island of <HI>Si</HI>—we hauled our
Main-Sail and Fore-Sail up in the Brails, lower'd
the Top-Sail upon the Cap, and clewed them up
that we might lye as snug as we could, expect∣ing
their coming out; and the next Morning
saw the whole Fleet come out accordingly, but
not at all to our Satisfaction, for they consisted of
Twenty six Sail, and most of them Ships of Force,
as well as Burthen, both Merchant Men and Men
of War; so seeing there was no meddling, we lay
still where we was also, till the Fleet was out of
Sight, and then stood off and on, in hopes of meet∣ing
with further Purchase.</P>
<P>It was not long before we saw a Sail, and im∣mediately
gave her Chase, but she proved an ex∣cellent
Sailer, and standing out to Sea, we saw
plainly she trusted to her Heels, that is to say, to
her Sails; however, as we were a clean Ship we
gained upon her, tho' slowly, and had we had a
<PB N="192" REF="194"/>
Day before us, we should certainly have come
up with her, but it grew dark apace, and in that
Case we knew we should lose Sight of her.</P>
<P>Our merry Quaker perceiving us to crowd
still after her in the Dark, wherein we could
not see which way she went, come very drily to
me; <HI>Friend</HI> Singleton, says he, <HI>doest thee know what
we are a doing?</HI> Says I, <HI>yes, why we are chasing yon
Ship, are we not? And how dost thou know that,</HI> says
he very gravely still? <HI>Nay, that is true,</HI> says I
again, <HI>we cannot he sure. Yes Friend,</HI> says he, <HI>I
think we may be sure that we are running away from
her, not chasing her. I am afraid,</HI> adds he, <HI>thou art
turned Quaker, and hast resolved not to use the Hand
of Power, or art a Coward, and art flying from thy
Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>What do you mean, <HI>says I, I think I swore at him;</HI>
what do ye sneer at now? you have always one dry Rub or
another to give us.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> it's plain enough, the Ship stood off
to Sea, due East on purpose to lose us, and thou may'st
be sure her Business does not lie that Way; for what
should she do at the Coast of <HI>Africa</HI> in this Latitude,
which would be as far South as <HI>Congo</HI> or <HI>Angola;</HI> but
as soon as it is dark, that we shall lose Sight of her, she
will tack and stand away West again for the <HI>Brasil</HI>
Coast, and for the Bay, where thou knowest she was going
before; and are not we then a running away from her?
<HI>I am greately in hopes, Friend,</HI> says the dry gibing
Creature, <HI>Thou wilt turn Quaker, for I see thou
art not for Fighting.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Very well</HI> WILLIAM, says I, <HI>then I shall make an
excellent Pyrate.</HI> However, <HI>William</HI> was in the right,
and I apprehended what he meant immediately,
and Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who lay very sick in his Ca∣bin,
overhearing us, understood him as well as
<PB N="193" REF="195"/>
I, and called out to me, that <HI>William</HI> was right
and it was our best Way to change our Course,
and stand away for the Bay, where it was Ten
to one but we should snap her in the Morning.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we went about snip, got our
Larboard Tacks on board, set the Top-gallant
Sails, and crowded for the Bay of <HI>All-Saints,</HI>
where we came to an Anchor, early in the Morn∣ing
just out of Gun Shot of the Forts; we furl'd
our Sails with Rope-Yarns, that we might haul
home the Sheets without going up to loose them,
and lowering our Main and Fore-Yards, looked
just as if we had lain there a good while.</P>
<P>In two Hours after, we saw our Game, stand∣ing
in for the Bay with all the Sail she could make,
and she came innocently into our very Mouths,
for we lay still, till we saw her almost within
Gun Shot; when our Fore Mast Geers being
stretched fore and aft, we first run up our Yards,
and then hauled home the Top-Sail Sheets; the
Rope-Yarns that furled them giving Way of
themselves, the Sails were set in a few Minutes;
at the same time slipping our Cable, we came
upon her before she could get under Way upon
'tother Tack: They were so surprized, that they
made little or no Resistance, but struck after the
first Broad-Side.</P>
<P><HI>We were considering what to do with her,
when</HI> William <HI>came to me.</HI> Hark thee Friend, <HI>says
he,</HI> thou hast made a fine Spot of Work of it now, hast
thou not? To horrow thy Neighbour's Ship here, just at
thy Neighbour's Door, and never ask him Leave; now
dost thou not think there are some Men of War in the
Port, thou hast given them the Alarm sufficiently;
thou will have them upon thy Back before Night, depend
upon it, to ask thee, wherefore, Thou dist so?</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196"/>
Truly <HI>William, said I,</HI> for ought I know, that may
be true: What then shall we do next? <HI>Says he,</HI> thou hast
but two Things to do, either go in and take all the rest, or
else get thee gone before they come out, and take thee; for
I see they are hoisting a Top-Mast to you great Ship, in
order to put to Sea immediately, and they won't be long
before they come to talk with thee; and what wilt thou
say to them, when they ask thee why thou borrowedst their
Ship without Leave?</P>
<P>As <HI>William</HI> said, so it was, we could see by our
Glasses that they were all in a Hurry, manning
and fitting some Sloops they had there, and a large
Man of War, and it was plain they would soon
be with us; but we were not at a Loss what to
do; we found the Ship we had taken was loaden
with nothing considerable for our Purpose, except
some Cocoa, some Sugar, and Twenty Barrels of
Flower; the rest of her Loading was Hides; so
we took out all we thought for our Turn, and
among the rest all her Ammunition, great Shot,
and small Arms, and turned her off; we also
took a Cable and three Anchors she had, which
were for our Purpose, and some of her Sails;
she had enough left just to carry her into Port,
and that was all.</P>
<P>Having done this, we stood on upon the <HI>Brasil</HI>
Coast, Southward, till we came to the Mouth of
the River <HI>Janiero:</HI> But as we had two Days the
Wind blowing hard at S. E. and S. S. E. we
were obliged to come to an Anchor under a little
Island, and wait for a Wind. In this time the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> had it seems given Notice over Land to
the Governour there, that a Pyrate was upon
the Coast; so that when we came in View of the
Port, we saw two Men of War riding just
without the Bar, whereof one we found was
<PB N="195" REF="197"/>
getting under Sail with all possible Speed, having
slipt her Cable, on purpose to speak with us;
the other was not so forward, but was preparing
to follow: In less than an Hour they stood both
fair after us, with all the Sail they could make.</P>
<P>Had not the Night come on, <HI>William</HI>'s Words
had been made good; they would certainly
have asked us the Question what we did there?
for we found the foremost Ship gained upon us,
especially upon one Tack; for we plied away
from them to Windward, but in the Dark losing
Sight of them, we resolved to change our Course,
and stand away directly to Sea, not doubting but
we should lose them in the Night.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Commander guessed
we would do so or no, I know not; but in the
Morning when the Day-light appeared, instead
of having lost him, we found him in Chase of us,
about a League a-Stern; only to our great good
Fortune we could see but one of the two; how∣ever
this one was a great Ship, carried six and
forty Guns, and an admirable Sailer, as appeared
by her out-sailing us; for our Ship was an excel∣lent
Sailer too, as I have said before.</P>
<P>When I found this, I easily saw there was no
Remedy, but we must engage; and as we knew
we could expect no Quarters from those Scoun∣drels
the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> a Nation I had an original
Aversion to, I let Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> know how
it was. The Captain, sick as he was, jumped
up in the Cabin, and would be led out upon the
Deck, for he was very weak, to see how it was;
well, <HI>says he,</HI> we'll fight them.</P>
<P>Our Men were all in good heart before, but to
see the Captain so brisk who had lain ill of a Ca∣lenture
Ten or Eleven Days, gave them double
<PB N="196" REF="198"/>
Courage, and they went all Hands to work to
make a clear Ship and be ready. <HI>William</HI> the
Quaker comes to me with a kind of a Smile;
Friend, says he, what does yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ship follow us
for? Why says I, to fight us you may be sure;
Well, says he, and will he come up with us dost
thou think? Yes, said I, you see she will. Why
then, Friend, says the dry Wretch, why dost thou
run from her still, when thou seest she will over∣take
thee? Will it be better for us to be over∣taken
further off than here? Much at one for
that, says I; why what would you have us do?
Do! says he, let us not give the poor Man more
Trouble than needs must; let us stay for him, and
hear what he has to say to us; he will talk to us
in Powder and Ball said I: Very well then, says he
if that be his Country Language, we must talk
to him in the same, must we not? Or else how
shall he understand us? Very well <HI>William,</HI> says
I, we understand you; and the Captain as ill as
he was, called to me, <HI>William</HI>'s right again, says he,
as good here as a League further; so he gives
a Word of Command, <HI>Haul up the Main-Sail,</HI> we'll
shorten Sail for him.</P>
<P>Accordingly we shortened Sail; and as we
expected her upon our Lee Side, we being then
upon our Starboard Tack, brought 18 of our Guns
to the Larboard Side, resolving to give him a
Broad-Side that should warm him; it was about
half an Hour before he came up with us, all which
time we luffed up, that we might keep the
Wind of him, by which he was obliged to run up
under our Lee, as we designed him; when we
got him upon our Quarter we edg'd down, and
received the Fire of five or six of his Guns; by
this time you may be sure all our Hands were at
<PB N="197" REF="199"/>
their Quarters, so we clapt our Helm hard <HI>a
Weather,</HI> let go the Lee Braces of the Main Top∣sail,
and laid it a-back, and so our Ship fell athwart
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship's Hawse; then we immediately
poured in our Broad-Side, raking them fore and
aft, and killed them a great many Men.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese,</HI> we could see were in the ut∣most
Confusion; and not being aware of our De∣sign,
their Ship having fresh Way, run their
Boltsprit into the fore Part of our main Shrouds,
as that they could not easily get clear of us, and so
we lay locked after that Manner, the Enemy could
not bring above five or six Guns, besides their
Small-Arms, to bear upon us, while we played
our whole Broadside upon him.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Heat of this Fight, as I
was very busy upon the Quarter Deck, the Cap∣tain
calls to me, for he never stirred from us,
what the Devil is Friend <HI>William</HI> a-doing yonder,
says the Captain, has he any Business upon Deck?
I stept forward, and there was Friend <HI>William</HI> with
two or three stout Fellows lashing the Ships Bolt∣sprit
fast to our Main-Mast, for fear they should get
away from us; and every now and then he pulled a
Bottle out of his Pocket and gave the Men a Dram to
encourage them. The Shot flew about his Ears as
thick as may be supposed in such an Action, where
the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> to give them their due, fought very
briskly, believing at first they were sure of their
Game, and trusting to their Superiority; but there
was <HI>William,</HI> as composed, and in as perfect Tran∣quillity
as to Danger, as if he had been over a
Bowl of Punch, only very busy securing the Mat∣ter,
that a Ship of Fourty six Guns should not run
away from a Ship of Eight and Twenty.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="200"/>
This Work was too hot to hold long; our Men
behaved bravely; our Gunner, a gallant Man,
shouted below, pouring in his Shot at such a
Rate, that the <HI>Portuguese</HI> began to slacken their
Fire; we had dismounted several of their Guns
by firing in at their Forecastle, and raking them,
as I said, fore and aft; and presently comes <HI>William</HI>
up to me; <HI>Friend</HI> says he, very calmly, <HI>What
doest thou mean? Why dost thou not visit thy Neighbour
in the Ship, the Door being open for thee?</HI> I understood
him immediately, for our Guns had so tore their
Hull, that we had beat two Port Holes into one,
and the Bulk Head of their Steerage was split
to Pieces, that they could not retire to their close
Quarters; so I gave the Word immediately to
board them. Our Second Lieutenant, with about
Thirty Men, entered in an Instant over the Fore∣castle,
followed by some more, with the Boat∣swain,
and cutting in Pieces about Twenty five
Men that they found upon the Deck, and then
throwing some Grenadoes into the Steerage, they
entered there also; upon which the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
cried Quarter presently, and we mastered the
Ship, contrary indeed to our own Expectation;
for we would have compounded with them, if
if they would have sheered off, but laying them
athwart the Hawse at first, and following our
Fire furiously, without giving them any time to
get clear of us, and work their Ship, by this
means, tho' they had six and forty Guns, they
were not able to Fight above five or six, as I said
above, for we beat them immediately from their
Guns in the Forecastle, and killed them Abun∣dance
of Men between Decks, so that when we
entered they had hardly sound Men enough to
fight us Hand to Hand upon their Deck.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="201"/>
The Surprize of Joy, to hear the <HI>Portuguese</HI>
cry Quarter, and see their Antient struck, was
so great to our Captain, who as I have said, was
reduced very weak with a high Fever, that it
gave him new Life; Nature conquered the Di∣stemper,
and the Fever abated that very Night:
So that in two or three Days he was sensibly bet∣ter,
his Strength began to come, and he was able
to give his Orders effectually in every thing that
was material, and in about ten Days was entirely
well, and about the Ship.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I took Possession of the <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>
Man of War, and Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> made me,
or rather I made my self, Captain of her for the
present; about Thirty of their Seamen took Ser∣vice
with us, some of which were <HI>French,</HI> some
<HI>Genoeses,</HI> and we set the rest on Shore the next
Day, on a little Island on the Coast of <HI>Brasil,</HI> ex∣cept
some wounded Men who were not in a Con∣dition
to be removed; and whom we were bound to
keep on board, but we had an Occasion afterwards
to dispose of them at the Cape, where at their
own Request we set them on Shore.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> as soon as the Ship was taken,
and the Prisoners stowed, was for standing in
for the River <HI>Janiero</HI> again, not doubting but we
should meet with the other Man of War, who
not having been able to find us, and having lost
the Company of her Comrade, would certainly
be returned, and might be surprized by the Ship
we had taken, if we carryed <HI>Portuguese</HI> Colours,
and our Men were all for it.</P>
<P>But our Friend <HI>William</HI> gave us better Counsel;
for he came to me, Friend, says he, I understand
the Captain is for sailing back to the <HI>Rio Janiero,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="202"/>
in Hopes to meet with the other Ship that was
in Chase of thee yesterday; is it true, dost thou
intend it? Why, yes, says I, <HI>William,</HI> pray why
not? Nay, <HI>says he,</HI> thou mayst do so if thou
wilt. Well, I know that too, <HI>William,</HI> said I;
but the Captain is a Man will be ruled by Rea∣son;
what have you to say to it? Why, says
<HI>William</HI> gravely, I only ask what is thy Business,
and the Business of all the People thou hast with
thee? Is it not to get Money? Yes, <HI>William,</HI> it is
so, in our honest Way: And wouldst thou, says
he, rather have Money without Fighting, or
Fighting without Money? I mean, which wouldst
thou have by Choice, suppose it to be left to
thee? <HI>O William, says I,</HI> the first of the two, to
be sure. Why then, <HI>says he,</HI> what great Gain
hast thou made of the Prize thou hast taken now,
tho' it has cost the Lives of thirteen of thy
Men, besides some hurt? It is true, thou hast
got the Ship and some Prisoners, but thou wouldst
have had twice the Booty in a Merchant Ship,
with not one Quarter of the Fighting; and how
dost thou know either what Force, or what Num∣ber
of Men may be in the other Ship, and what
Loss thou mayst suffer, and what Gain it shall be
to thee, if thou take her? I think indeed thou
mayst much better let her alone.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>William,</HI> it is true said I, and I'll go tell
the Captain what your Opinion is, and bring
you Word what he says. Accordingly I went
to the Captain, and told him <HI>William</HI>'s Reasons,
and the Captain was of his Mind, that our Busi∣ness
was indeed Fighting when we could not help
it, but that our main Affair was Money, and
that with as few Blows as we could; so that Ad∣venture
was laid aside, and we stood along Shore
<PB N="201" REF="203"/>
again South, for the River <HI>de la Plata,</HI> expecting
some Purchase thereabouts; especially we had
our Eyes upon some of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships from the
<HI>Bruenos Ayres,</HI> which are generally very rich in
Silver, and one such Prize would have done our
Business. We ply'd about here in the Latitude
of South for near a Month, and no∣thing
offer'd; and here we began to consult what
we should do next, for we had come to no Reso∣lution
yet. Indeed my Design was always for the
<HI>Cape de Bona Speranza,</HI> and so to the <HI>East Indies.</HI>
I had heard some flaming Stories of Captain <HI>Avery,</HI>
and the fine things he had done in the <HI>Indies,</HI>
which were doubled and doubled even Ten Thou∣sand-fold,
and from taking a great Prize in the
Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> where he took a Lady said to be
the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Daughter, with a great Quan∣tity
of Jewels about her. We had a Story told
us, that he took a <HI>Mogul</HI> Ship, so the foolish Sai∣lors
called it, loaden with Diamonds.</P>
<P>I would fain have had Friend <HI>William</HI>'s Advice,
whither we should go, but he always put it off
with some <HI>Quaking</HI> Quibble or other. In short,
he did not care for directing us neither; whether
he made a Piece of Conscience of it, or whether
he did not care to venture having it come against
him afterwards, or no, this I know not; but we
concluded at last without him.</P>
<P>We were however pretty long in resolving,
and hanker'd about the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> a long
time; at last we spy'd a Sail to Windward, and
it was such a Sail as I believe had not been seen in
that Part of the World a great while; it wanted
not that we should give it Chase, for it stood di∣rectly
towards us, as well as they that steer'd
could make it; and even that was more Accident
<PB N="202" REF="204"/>
of Weather than any thing else: For if the Wind
had chopt about any where, they must have gone
with it. I leave any Man that is a Sailor, or un∣derstands
any thing of a Ship, to judge what a
Figure this Ship made when we first saw her,
and what we could imagine was the Matter with
her. Her Main Top-Mast was come by the Board,
about six Foot above the Cap, and fell forward,
the Head of the Top-gallant Mast, hanging in
the Fore Shrouds by the Stay; at the same time
the Pareil of the Mizen Topsail Yard, by
some Accident giving Way, the Mizen Top∣sail
Braces (the standing Part of which being
fast to the Main Topsail Shrouds) brought the
Mizen Topsail, Yard and all, down with it,
which spread over Part of the Quarter Deck like
an Awning: The Fore-Topsail was hoisted up
two Thirds of the Mast, but the Sheets were
flown. The Fore Yard was lower'd down upon
the Forecastle, the Sail loose, and Part of it
hanging over-board. In this Manner she came
down upon us with the Wind quartering: In a
Word, the Figure the whole Ship made, was the
most confounding to Men that understood the Sea,
that ever was seen; she had no Boat, neither had
she any Colours out.</P>
<P>When we came near to her, we fired a Gun to
bring her to. She took no Notice of it, nor of
us, but came on just as she did before. We fired
again, but 'twas all one: At length we came with∣in
Pistol Shot of one another, but no body an∣swered
nor appeared; so we began to think that
it was a Ship gone ashore somewhere in Distress,
and the Men having forsaken her, the high Tide
had floated her off to Sea. Coming nearer to her,
we run up along Side of her so close, that we
<PB N="203" REF="205"/>
could hear a Noise within her, and see the Mo∣tion
of several People thro' her Ports.</P>
<P>Upon this we Mann'd our two Boats full of
Men, and very well armed, and ordered them to
board her at the same Minute, as near as they
could, and to enter one at her Fore-chains on one
Side, and the other a Mid-ship on the other
Side. As soon as they came to the Ship's Side,
a surprizing Multitude of black Sailors, <HI>such
as they were,</HI> appeared upon Deck, and in short,
terrify'd our Men so much, that the Boat
which was to enter her Men in the Waste,
stood off again, and durst not board her; and
the Men that enter'd out of the other Boat,
finding the first Boat, as they thought, beaten
off, and seeing the Ship full of Men, jump'd all
back again into their Boat, and put off, not
knowing what the Matter was. Upon this we
prepared to pour in a Broadside upon her. But
our Friend <HI>William</HI> set us to Rights again here;
for it seems he guess'd how it was sooner than
we did, and coming up to me (for it was our
Ship that came up with her) Friend, says he,
I am of Opinion thou art wrong in this Matter,
and thy Men have been wrong also in their Con∣duct:
I'll tell thee how thou shalt take this
Ship, without making use of those things call'd
Guns. How can that be, <HI>William,</HI> said I? Why,
said he, thou mayst take her with thy Helm;
thou seest they keep no Steerage, and thou seest
the Condition they are in; board her with thy
Ship upon her Lee Quarter, and so enter her
from the Ship: I am perswaded thou wilt take
her without Fighting, for there is some Mischief
has befallen the Ship, which we know nothing
of.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="206"/>
In a Word, it being a smooth Sea, and little
Wind, I took his Advice, and lay'd her aboard.
Immediately our Men entred the Ship, where
we found a large Ship with upwards of 600 Ne∣groes,
Men and Women, Boys and Girls, and not
one Christian, or white Man, on board.</P>
<P>I was struck with Horror at the Sight, for
immediately I concluded, as was partly the Case,
that these black Devils had got loose, had mur∣thered
all the white Men, and thrown them in∣to
the Sea; and I had no sooner told my Mind
to the Men, but the Thought of it so enraged
them, that I had much ado to keep my Men
from cutting them all in Pieces. But <HI>William,</HI>
with many Perswasions prevailed upon them,
by telling of them, that it was nothing but what,
if they were in the Negroes Condition, they
would do, if they could; and that the Negroes
had really the highest Injustice done them, to be
sold for Slaves without their Consent; and that
the Law of Nature dictated it to them; that they
ought not to kill them, and that it would be
wilful Murder to do it.</P>
<P>This prevailed with them, and cooled their
first Heat; so they only knock'd down twenty
or thirty of them, and the rest run all down
between Decks, to their first Places, believing,
as we fancy'd, that we were their first Masters
come again.</P>
<P>It was a most unaccountable Difficulty we had
next, for we could not make them understand
one Word we said, nor could we understand one
Word our selves that they said. We endea∣voured
by Signs to ask them whence they came,
but they could make nothing of it; we pointed
to the Great Cabin, to the Round-house, to the
<PB N="205" REF="207"/>
Cook-room, then to our Faces, to ask if they had
no white Men on board, and where they were
gone? But they could not understand what we
meant: On the other Hand, they pointed to our
Boat, and to their Ship, asking Questions as well
as they could, and said a Thousand things, and
expressed themselves with great Earnestness, but
we could not understand a Word of it all, or
know what they meant by any of their Signs.</P>
<P>We knew very well they must have been taken
on board the Ship as Slaves, and that it must be
by some <HI>European</HI> People too. We could easily
see that the Ship was a <HI>Dutch</HI>-built Ship, but
very much alter'd, having been built upon, and
as we suppose, in <HI>France;</HI> for we found two or
three <HI>French</HI> Books on board, and afterwards we
found Clothes, Linnen, Lace, some old Shoes,
and several other things: We found among the
Provisions, some Barrels of <HI>Irish</HI> Beef, some <HI>New∣foundland</HI>
Fish, and several other Evidences that
there had been Christians on board, but saw no
Remains of them. We found not a Sword, Gun,
Pistol, or Weapon of any kind, except some
Cutlasses; and the Negroes had hid them below
where they lay. We ask'd them what was be∣come
of all the small Arms, pointing to our own,
and to the Places where those belonging to the
Ship had hung: One of the Negroes understood
me presently, and beckon'd to me to come up
upon the Deck, where taking my Fuzee, which
I never let go out of my Hand for some time
after we had master'd the Ship; I say, offering
to take hold of it, he made the proper Motion of
throwing it into the Sea, by which I understood,
as I did afterwards, that they had thrown all
the small Arms, Powder, Shot, Swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in∣to
<PB N="206" REF="208"/>
the Sea, believing, as I supposed, those things
would kill them, tho' the Men were gone.</P>
<P>After we understood this, we made no Questi∣on
but that the Ship's Crew having been surpri∣zed
by these desperate Rogues, had gone the same
Way, and had been thrown over-board also. We
look'd all over the Ship, to see if we could find
any Blood, and we thought we did perceive some
in several Places; but the Heat of the Sun melt∣ing
the Pitch and Tar upon the Decks, made it
impossible for us to discern it exactly, except in
the Round-house, where we plainly saw that
there had been much Blood. We found the
Skuttle open, by which we supposed the Captain
and those that were with him had made their
Retreat into the Great Cabin, or those in the
Cabin had made their Escape up into the Round-house.</P>
<P>But that which confirmed us most of all in
what had happen'd, was, that upon farther En∣quiry
we found that there were seven or eight
of the Negroes very much wounded, two or
three of them with Shot; whereof one had his
Leg broke, and lay in a miserable Condition, the
Flesh being mortified, and, as our Friend <HI>William</HI>
said, in two Days more he would have died.
<HI>William</HI> was a most dexterous Surgeon, and he
shew'd it in this Cure; for tho' all the Surgeons
we had on board both our Ships (and we had no
less than five that called themselves bred Surge∣ons,
besides two or three who were Pretenders or
Assistants) and all these gave their Opinion that
the Negroe's Leg must be cut off, and that his
Life could not be saved without it; that the
Mortification had touch'd the Marrow in the
Bone, that the Tendons were mortified, and that
<PB N="207" REF="209"/>
he could never have the Use of his Leg, if it
should be cured. <HI>William</HI> said nothing in gene∣ral,
but that his Opinion was otherwise, and that
he desired the Wound might be search'd, and
that he would then tell them farther. Accor∣dingly
he went to Work with the Leg, and, as
he desired he might have some of the Surgeons
to assist him, we appointed him two of the ablest
of them to help, and all of them to look on, if
they thought fit.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> went to Work his own Way, and some
of them pretended to find Fault at first. Howe∣ver,
he proceeded, and search'd every Part of
the Leg where he suspected the Mortification had
touch'd it: In a Word, he cut off a great deal
of mortified Flesh; in all which the poor Fellow
felt no Pain. <HI>William</HI> proceeded till he brought
the Vessels which he had cut to bleed, and the
Man to cry out: Then he reduced the Splinters
of the Bone, and calling for Help, <HI>set it, as we call
it,</HI> and bound it up, and laid the Man to Rest,
who found himself much easier than before.</P>
<P>At the first Opening, the Surgeons began to
triumph, the Mortification seem'd to spread, and
a long red Streak of Blood appeared from the
Wound upwards to the Middle of the Man's
Thigh, and the Surgeons told me the Man would
die in a few Hours. I went to look at it, and
found <HI>William</HI> himself under some Surprize; but
when I ask'd him how long he thought the poor
Fellow could live, he look'd gravely up at me,
and said, <HI>As long as thou canst:</HI> I am not at all
apprehensive of his Life, said he, but I would
cure him if I could, without making a Cripple of
him. I found he was not just then upon the Ope∣ration,
as to his Leg, but was mixing up some∣thing
<PB N="208" REF="210"/>
to give the poor Creature, to repel, as I
thought, the spreading Contagion, and to abate
or prevent any feverish Temper that might
happen in the Blood: After which he went to
Work again, and open'd the Leg in two Pla∣ces
above the Wound, cutting out a great deal
of mortified Flesh, which it seems was occasio∣ned
by the Bandage which had press'd the Parts
too much, and withal, the Blood being at that
time in a more than common Disposition to
mortify, might assist to spread it.</P>
<P>Well, our Friend <HI>William</HI> conquer'd all this,
clear'd the spreading Mortification, that the red
Streak went off again, the Flesh began to heal,
and Matter to run; and in a few Days the Man's
Spirits began to recover, his Pulse beat regular,
he had no Fever, and gathered Strength daily;
and in a Word he was a perfect sound Man in
about ten Weeks, and we kept him amongst us,
and made him an able Seaman. But to return
to the Ship, we never could come at a certain In∣formation
about it, till some of the Negroes which
we kept on board, and whom we taught to speak
<HI>English,</HI> gave the Account of it afterwards, and
this maim'd Man in particular.</P>
<P>We enquired by all the Signs and Motions
we could imagine, what was become of the Peo∣ple,
and yet we could get nothing from them.
Our Lieutenant was for torturing some of them
to make them confess; but <HI>William</HI> opposed that
vehemently; and when he heard it was under
Consideration, he came to me, Friend, says he,
I make a Request to thee, not to put any of
these poor Wretches to Torment. Why, <HI>Willi∣am,</HI>
said I, why not? You see they will not give
any Account of what is become of the white
<PB N="209" REF="211"/>
Men. Nay, says <HI>William,</HI> do not say so; I sup∣pose
they have given thee a full Account of every
Particular of it. How so, says I, pray what are
we the wiser for all their Jabbering? Nay, says
<HI>William,</HI> that may be thy Fault, for ought I
know; thou wilt not punish the poor Men be∣cause
they cannot speak <HI>English,</HI> and perhaps they
never heard a Word of <HI>English</HI> before. Now I
may very well suppose, that they have given
thee a large Account of every thing; for thou
seest with what Earnestness, and how long some
of them have talk'd to thee, and if thou canst
not understand their Language, nor they thine,
how can they help that; at the best thou doest
but suppose that they have not told thee the
whole Truth of the Story, and on the contrary
I suppose they have, and how wilt thou decide
the Question, whether thou art right, or whether
I am right? Besides, what can they say to thee,
when thou askest them a Question upon the Tor∣ture,
and at the same time they do not under∣stand
the Question, and thou doest not know
whether they say <HI>Ay</HI> or <HI>No?</HI></P>
<P>It is no Complement to my Moderation, to say
I was convinc'd by these Reasons; and yet we
had all much ado to keep our second Lieute∣nant
from murthering some of them to make
them tell. What if they had told, he did not
understand one Word of it; but he would not
be perswaded but that the Negroes must needs
understand him, when he ask'd them, whether
the Ship had any Boat or no, like ours, and what
was become of it?</P>
<P>But there was no Remedy but to wait till
we made these People understand <HI>English;</HI> and
to adjourn the Story till that time. The Case was
<PB N="210" REF="212"/>
thus. Where they were taken on board the
Ship, that we could never understand, because they
never knew the <HI>English</HI> Names which we give to
those Coasts, or what Nation they were who be∣long'd
to the Ship, because they knew not one
Tongue from another; but thus far the Negroe
I examin'd, who was the same whose Leg <HI>William</HI>
had cured, told us, that they did not speak the
same Language we spoke, nor the same our <HI>Portu∣gueze</HI>
spoke; so that in all Probability they must
be <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>Then he told us, that the white Men used
them barbarously; that they beat them unmer∣cifully;
that one of the Negroe Men had a Wife,
and two Negroe Children, one a Daughter about
sixteen Years old; that a White Man abused the
Negroe Man's Wife, and afterwards his Daugh∣ter,
which, as he said, made all the Negroe Men
mad; and that the Woman's Husband was in a
great Rage, at which the White Man was so pro∣voked,
that he threaten'd to kill him; but in
the Night, the Negroe Man being loose, got a
great Club, by which he made us understand he
meant a Handspike, and that when the same
<HI>Frenchman</HI> (<HI>if it was a</HI> Frenchman) came among
them again, he began again to abuse the Ne∣groe
Man's Wife; at which the Negroe taking
up the Handspike, knock'd his Brains out at one
Blow; and then taking the Key from him with
which he usually unlock'd the Hand-cuffs which
the Negroes were fetter'd with, he set about a
Hundred of them at Liberty, who getting up
upon the Deck by the same Skuttle that the
White Man came down; and taking the Man's
Cutlass who was killed, and laying hold of what
came next them, they fell upon the Men that
<PB N="211" REF="213"/>
were upon the Deck, and killed them all, and
afterwards those they found upon the Forecastle;
that the Captain and his other Men, who were
in the Cabin, and the Round-house, defended
themselves with great Courage, and shot out at
the Loopholes at them, by which he and several
other Men were wounded, and some killed; but
that they broke into the Round-house after a
long Dispute, where they killed two of the
white Men, but own'd that the two white Men
killed eleven of their Men before they could
break in; and then the rest having got down
the Skuttle into the Great Cabin, wounded three
more of them.</P>
<P>That after this, the Gunner of the Ship ha∣ving
secured himself in the Gun-room, one of
his Men haul'd up the Long-Boat close under
the Stern, and putting into her all the Arms
and Ammunition they could come at, got all in∣to
the Boat, and afterwards took in the Captain,
and those that were with him, out of the Great
Cabin. When they were all thus embark'd, they
resolved to lay the Ship aboard again, and try to
recover it; that they boarded the Ship in a de∣sperate
Manner, and killed at first all that stood
in their Way; but the Negroes being by this
time all loose, and having gotten some Arms,
tho' they understood nothing of Powder and
Bullet, or Guns; yet the Men could never ma∣ster
them. However, they lay under the Ship's
Bow, and got out all the Men they had left in the
Cook-room, who had maintained themselves
there, notwithstanding all the Negroes could do,
and with their small Arms killed between thirty
and forty of the Negroes, but were at last forc'd
to leave them.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="214"/>
They could give me no Account whereabouts
this was, whether near the Coast of <HI>Africk,</HI> or
far off, or how long it was before the Ship fell
into our Hands; only in general, it was a great
while ago, <HI>as they called it,</HI> and by all we could
learn, it was within two or three Days after they
had set Sail from the Coast. They told us, that
they had killed about thirty of the white Men,
having knock'd them on the Head with Crows and
Hand-spikes, and such things as they could get;
and one strong Negroe killed three of them with
an Iron Crow, after he was shot twice thro' the
Body, and that he was afterwards shot thro' the
Head by the Captain himself at the Door of
the Round-house, which he had split open with
the Crow; and this we suppose was the Occa∣sion
of the great Quantity of Blood which we
saw at the Round-house Door.</P>
<P>The same Negroe told us, that they threw all
the Powder and Shot they could find, into the
Sea, and they would have thrown the great Guns
into the Sea, if they could have lifted them.
Being ask'd how they came to have their Sails
in such a Condition, his Answer was, <HI>they no un∣derstand,
they no know what the Sails do;</HI> that was,
they did not so much as know that it was the
Sails that made the Ship go; or understand what
they meant, or what to do with them. When
we asked him whither they were going, he said,
they did not know, but believed they should go
Home to their own Country again. I asked
him in particular, what he thought we were,
when we came first up with them? He said,
they were terribly frighted, believing we were
the same white Men that had gone away in their
Boats, and were come again in a great Ship, with
<PB N="213" REF="215"/>
the two Boats with them, and expected they
would kill them all.</P>
<P>This was the Account we got out of them,
after we had taught them to speak <HI>English,</HI> and
to understand the Names and Use of the things
belonging to the Ship, which they had Occa∣sion
to speak of, and we observed that the Fel∣lows
were too innocent to dissemble in their
Relation, and that they all agreed in the Par∣ticulars,
and were always in the same Story,
which confirm'd very much the Truth of what
they said.</P>
<P>Having taken this Ship, our next Difficulty
was, what to do with the Negroes. The <HI>Portu∣gueze</HI>
in the <HI>Brasils</HI> would have bought them all of
us, and been glad of the Purchase, if we had
not shew'd our selves Enemies there, and been
known for Pyrates; but as it was, we durst not
go on Shore any where thereabouts, or treat with
any of the Planters, because we should raise the
whole Country upon us; and if there were any
such things as Men of War in any of their
Ports, we should be assured to be attack'd by
them, and by all the Force they had by Land
or Sea.</P>
<P>Nor could we think of any better Success,
if we went Northward to our own Plantations.
One while we determined to carry them all away
to the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and sell them there to the
<HI>Spaniards;</HI> but they were really too many for
them to make Use of; and to carry them round
to the South-Seas, which was the only Remedy
that was left, was so far, that we should be
no Way able to subsist them for so long a
Voyage.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="216"/>
At last, our old never-failing Friend <HI>William</HI>
help'd us out again, as he had often done, at
a Dead-lift. His Proposal was this, that he
should go as Master of the Ship, and about
twenty Men such as we could best trust, and
attempt to trade privately upon the Coast of
<HI>Brasil,</HI> with the Planters, not at the principal
Ports, because that would not be admitted.</P>
<P>We all agreed to this, and appointed to go
away our selves towards the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> where
we had Thought of going before, and to wait
for him not there, but at <HI>Port St. Pedro,</HI> as the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> call it, lying at the Mouth of the Ri∣ver
which they call <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> and where the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> had a small Fort, and a few People,
but we believe there was no Body in it.</P>
<P>Here we took up our Station, cruising off and
on, to see if we could meet any Ships going
to, or coming from the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> or the <HI>Rio
de la Plata;</HI> but we met with nothing worth
Notice. However, we employed our selves in
things necessary for our going off to Sea; for
we filled all our Water Casks, and got some Fish
for our present Use, to spare as much as possi∣ble
our Ship's Stores.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> in the mean time went away to the
North, and made the Land about the <HI>Cape de
St. Thomas,</HI> and betwixt that and the Isles <HI>de
Tuberon,</HI> he found Means to trade with the Plan∣ters
for all his Negroes, as well the Women as
the Men, and at a very good Price too; for <HI>Willi∣am,</HI>
who spoke <HI>Portuguese</HI> pretty well, told them a
fair Story enough, that the Ship was in Scarcity
of Provisions, that they were driven a great
Way out of their Way, and indeed, <HI>as we say,</HI>
out of their Knowledge, and that they must go
<PB N="215" REF="217"/>
up to the Northward as far as <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or sell
there upon the Coast. This was a very plau∣sible
Tale, and was easily believed; and if you
observe the Manner of the Negroes Sailing, and
what happened in their Voyage, was every Word
of it true.</P>
<P>By this Method, and being true to one ano∣ther,
<HI>William</HI> past for what he was; I mean, for
a very honest Fellow, and by Assistance of one
Planter, who sent to some of his Neighbour
Planters, and managed the Trade among them∣selves,
he got a quick Market; for in less than
five Weeks, <HI>William</HI> sold all his Negroes, and at
last sold the Ship it self, and shipp'd himself and
his twenty Men, and two Negroe Boys whom he
had left, in a Sloop, one of those which the Plan∣ters
used to send on board for the Negroes.
With this Sloop Captain <HI>William,</HI> as we then cal∣led
him, came away, and found us at <HI>Port St. Pe∣dro,</HI>
in the Latitude of 32 Degrees, 30 Minutes
South.</P>
<P>Nothing was more surprizing to us, than to
see a Sloop come along the Coast, carrying <HI>Por∣tugueze</HI>
Colours, and come in directly to us, after
we were assured he had discovered both our
Ships. We fired a Gun upon her nearer Ap∣proach,
to bring her to an Anchor, but imme∣diately
she fired five Guns by Way of Salute,
and spread her <HI>English</HI> Antient: Then we began
to guess it was Friend <HI>William,</HI> but wondered
what was the Meaning of his being in a Sloop,
whereas we sent him away in a Ship of near
300 Tuns; but he soon let us into the whole
History of his Management, with which we had
a great deal of Reason to be very well satisfy'd.
As soon as he had brought the Sloop to an An∣chor,
<PB N="216" REF="218"/>
he came aboard of my Ship, and there
he gave us an Account how he began to
trade, by the Help of a <HI>Portugueze</HI> Planter,
who lived near the Sea-side; how he went
on Shore, and went up to the first House he
could see, and asked the Man of the House to
sell him some Hoggs, pretending at first he on∣ly
stood in upon the Coast to take in fresh Wa∣ter,
and buy some Provisions; and the Man not
only sold him seven fat Hoggs, but invited him
in, and gave him and five Men he had with him,
a very good Dinner, and he invited the Planter
on board his Ship, and in Return for his Kind∣ness,
gave him a Negroe Girl for his Wife.</P>
<P>This so obliged the Planter, that the next
Morning he sent him on board, in a great
Luggage Boat, a Cow and two Sheep, with a
Chest of Sweet-meats, and some Sugar, and a
great Bag of Tobacco, and invited Captain <HI>William</HI>
on Shore again: That after this, they grew from
one Kindness to another, that they began to talk
about Trading for some Negroes; and <HI>William</HI>
pretending it was to do him Service, consented
to sell him thirty Negroes for his private Use
in his Plantation, for which he gave <HI>William</HI>
ready Money in Gold, at the Rate of five and
thirty Moydores <HI>per</HI> Head; but the Planter was
obliged to use great Caution in the bringing them
on Shore: For which Purpose, he made <HI>William</HI>
weigh and stand out to Sea, and put in again,
above fifty Miles farther North, where at a
little Creek he took the Negroes on Shore at
another Plantation, being a Friend's of his whom
it seems he could trust.</P>
<P>This Remove brought <HI>William</HI> into a farther In∣timacy,
not only with the first Planter, but also
<PB N="217" REF="219"/>
with his Friends, who desired to have some of the
Negroes also; so that from one to another, they
bought so many, till one over-grown Planter took
100 Negroes, which was all <HI>William</HI> had left, and
sharing them with another Planter, that other
Planter chaffer'd with <HI>William</HI> for Ship and all,
giving him in Exchange a very clean, large,
well-built Sloop of near sixty Tons, very well
furnish'd, carrying six Guns, but we made her
afterwards carry twelve Guns. <HI>William</HI> had 300
Moydores of Gold, besides the Sloop, in Payment
for the Ship, and with this Money, he stored the
Sloop as full as she could hold with Provisions,
especially Bread, some Pork, and about sixty
Hoggs alive: Among the rest, <HI>William</HI> got eighty
Barrels of good Gunpowder, which was very
much for our Purpose, and all the Provisions
which were in the <HI>French</HI> Ship he took out also.</P>
<P>This was a very agreeable Account to us, espe∣cially
when we saw, that <HI>William</HI> had received in
Gold coin'd, or by Weight, and some <HI>Spanish</HI> Sil∣ver,
60000 Pieces of Eight, besides a new Sloop,
and a vast Quantity of Provisions.</P>
<P>We were very glad of the Sloop in particular,
and began to consult what we should do, whe∣ther
we had not best turn off our great <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Ship, and stick to our first Ship and the Sloop,
seeing we had scarce Men enough for all three,
and that the biggest Ship was thought too big
for our Business; however, another Dispute which
was now decided, brought the first to a Conclusion.
The first Dispute was, whither we should go? My
Comrade, as I called him now, that is to say, he
that was my Captain before we took this <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>
Man of War, was for going to the South
Seas, and coasting up the West Side of <HI>America,</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="220"/>
where we could not fail of making several good
Prizes upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and that then if Oc∣casion
required, we might come home by the
South-Seas to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> and so go round the
Globe as others had done before us.</P>
<P>But my Head lay another Way, I had been in
the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and had entertained a Notion
ever since that, that if we went thither we could
not fail of making good Work of it, and that we
might have a safe Retreat, and good Beef to Victual
our Ship, among my old Friends the Natives of
<HI>Zamguebar,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> or the
Island of St. <HI>Laurence:</HI> I say, my Thoughts lay this
Way and I read so many Lectures to them all, of the
Advantages they would certainly make of their
Strength, by the Prizes they would take in the
Gulph of <HI>Mocha</HI> or the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> and on the Coast of
<HI>Malabar</HI> or the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> that I amaz'd them.</P>
<P>With these Arguments I prevailed on them,
and we all resolved to steer away S. E. for the
Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> and in Consequence of this
Resolution, we concluded to keep the Sloop, and
sail with all three, no doubting, as I assured them,
but we should find Men there to make up the
Number wanting, and if not, we might cast any
of them off when we pleased.</P>
<P>We could do no less than make our Friend
<HI>William</HI> Captain of the Sloop, which with such
good Management he had brought us. He told
us, tho' with much good Manners, he would
not command her as a Fregat, but if we would
give her to him for his Share of the <HI>Guinea</HI> Ship,
which we came very honestly by, he would keep
us Company as a Victualler, if we commanded
him, as long as he was under the same Force
that took him away.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="221"/>
We understood him, so we gave him the Sloop,
but upon Condition that he should not go from
us, and should be entirely under our Command:
However, <HI>William</HI> was not so easy as before; and
indeed, as we afterwards wanted the Sloop, to
cruise for Purchase, and a Right thorow-paced
Pyrate in her; so I was in such Pain for <HI>William,</HI>
that I could not be without him, for he was my
Privy-Counsellour and Companion upon all Oc∣casions;
so I put a <HI>Scotsman,</HI> a bold enterprizing
gallant Fellow into her, named <HI>Gordon,</HI> and made
her carry 12 Guns, and four Paterero's, though
indeed we wanted Men, for we were none of us
Mann'd in Proportion to our Force.</P>
<P>We sailed away for the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> the
Beginning of <HI>October</HI> 1706, and passed by in
Sight of the Cape, the 12 of <HI>November</HI> follow∣ing,
having met with a great deal of bad Wea∣ther:
We saw several Merchant Ships in the
Road there, as well <HI>English</HI> as <HI>Dutch,</HI> whether
outward bound or homeward we could not tell;
<HI>be it what it would,</HI> we did not think fit to come to
an Anchor, not knowing what they might be,
or what they might attempt against us, when
they knew what we were: However, as we wanted
fresh Water, we sent the two Boats belonging to
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Man of War, with all <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Seamen or <HI>Negroes</HI> in them, to the Watering
Place, to take in Water: And in the mean time
we hung out a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Antient at Sea, and lay by
all that Night. They knew not what we was,
but it seems we past for any thing but really what
we was.</P>
<P>Our Boats returning the third time loaden,
about five a Clock next Morning, we thought
our selves sufficiently water'd, and stood away
<PB N="220" REF="222"/>
to the Eastward; but before our Men returned
the last time, the Wind blowing an easy Gale at
West, we perceived a Boat in the Grey of the
Morning, under Sail, crowding to come up with
us, as if they were afraid we should be gone.
We soon found it was an <HI>English</HI> Long-Boat, and
that it was pretty full of Men; we could not
imagine what the Meaning of it should be; but
as it was but a Boat, we thought there could
be no great Harm in it to let them come on
board: And if it appeared they came only to
enquire who we were, we would give them a full
Account of our Business, by taking them along
with us, seeing we wanted Men as much as any
thing; but they saved us the Labour of being in
doubt how to dispose of them, for it seems our
<HI>Portuguese</HI> Seamen who went for Water, had not
been so silent at the Watering Place, as we
thought they would have been. But the Case,
in short was this. Captain, <HI>I forbear
his Name at present, for a particular Reason,</HI> Captain
of an <HI>East India</HI> Merchant Ship, bound after∣wards
for <HI>China,</HI> had found some Reason to be
very severe with his Men, and had handled some
of them very roughly at St. <HI>Helena;</HI> insomuch,
that they threaten'd among themselves to leave
the Ship the first Opportunity, and had long
wish'd for that Opportunity: Some of these
Men, it seems, had met with our Boat at the Wa∣tering
Place, and enquiring of one another who
we were, and upon what Account; whether the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> Seamen, by faultring in their Account,
made them suspect that we were out upon the
Cruise, or whether they told it in plain <HI>English,</HI>
or no (for they all spoke <HI>English</HI> enough to be un∣derstood)
but so it was, that as soon as ever the
<PB N="221" REF="223"/>
Men carried the News on board, that the Ships
which lay by to the Eastward were <HI>English,</HI> and
that they were going upon <HI>the Account,</HI> which by
the Way was a Sea Term for a Pyrate; I say, as
soon as ever they heard it, they went to work,
and getting all things ready in the Night, their
Chests and Clothes, and whatever else they could,
they came away before it was Day, and came up
with us about seven a Clock.</P>
<P>When they came by the Ship's Side which I
commanded, we hailed them in the usual Man∣ner,
to know what and who they were, and
what their Business? They answered, they were
<HI>Englishmen,</HI> and desired to come aboard: We told
them they might lay the Ship on board, but or∣dered
they should let only one Man enter the
Ship, till the Captain knew their Business, and
that he should come without any Arms: They
said Ay, with all their Hearts.</P>
<P>We presently found their Business, and that
they desired to go with us; and as for their Arms,
they desired we would send Men on board the
Boat, and that they would deliver them all to us,
which was done. The Fellow that came up to
me, told me how they had been used by their
Captain, how he had starved the Men, and used
them like Dogs; and that if the rest of the Men
knew they should be admitted, he was satisfied
two Thirds of them would leave the Ship. We
found the Fellows were very hearty in their Re∣solution,
and jolly brisk Sailors they were; so I
told them I would do nothing without our Admi∣ral,
that was, the Captain of the other Ship: So
I sent my Pinnace on board Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> to
desire him to come on board; but he was indispo∣sed,
and being to Leeward, excused his coming,
<PB N="222" REF="224"/>
but left it all to me: But before my Boat was
returned, Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> called to me by his
Speaking Trumpet, which all the Men might
hear as well as I, thus, calling me by my Name,
<HI>I hear they are honest Fellows, pray tell them they are
all welcome, and make them a Bowl of Punch.</HI></P>
<P>As the Men heard it as well as I, there was
no need to tell them what the Captain said; and
as soon as the Trumpet had done, they set up a
Huzza that shewed us they were very hearty in
their coming to us; but we bound them to us by
a stronger Obligation still, after this: For when
we came to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> with
Consent of all the Ship's Company, ordered that
these Men should have as much Money given
them out of the Stock, as was due to them for
their Pay in the Ship they had left; and after
that, we allowed them Twenty Pieces of Eight
a Man Bounty Money: And thus we entred them
upon Shares, as we were all, and brave stout Fel∣lows
they were, being Eighteen in Number,
whereof two were Midship-Men, and one a Car∣penter.</P>
<P>It was the 28th of <HI>November,</HI> when having had
some bad Weather, we came to an Anchor in the
Road off of St. <HI>Augustine</HI> Bay, at the South West
End of my old Acquaintance the Isle of <HI>Madagas∣car:</HI>
We lay here a while, and traffick'd with the
Natives for some good Beef, tho' the Weather
was so hot, that we could not promise our selves to
salt any of it up to keep; but I shewed them the
Way which we practised before, to salt it first
with <HI>Salt-Petre,</HI> then cure it, by drying it in the
Sun, which made it eat very agreeably, tho' tho' not
so wholesome for our Men, that not agreeing with
our Way of Cooking, <HI>viz.</HI> Boiling with Pud∣ding,
<PB N="223" REF="225"/>
Brewes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and particularly this Way
would be too salt, and the Fat of the Meat be
resty, or dry'd away, so as not to be eaten.</P>
<P>This however we could not help, and made
our selves amends by feeding heartily on the fresh
Beef while we were there, which was excellent
good and fat, every Way as tender, and as well
relished as in <HI>England,</HI> and thought to be much
better to us who had not tasted any in <HI>England</HI> for
so long a Time.</P>
<P>Having now for some time remained here,
we began to consider that this was not a Place for
our Business; and I that had some Views, a parti∣cular
Way of my own, told them, that this was
not a Station for those that look'd for Purchase;
that there were two Parts of the Island which
were particularly proper for our Purposes; first
the Bay on the East Side of the Island, and
from thence to the Island <HI>Mauritius,</HI> which was
the usual Way which Ships that came from the
<HI>Malabar</HI> Coast, or the Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> Fore
<HI>St. George,</HI> &amp;c. used to take, and where, if we
waited for them, we ought to take our Station.</P>
<P>But on the other Hand, as we did not resolve
to fall upon the <HI>European</HI> Traders, who were
generally Ships of Force, and well Manned, and
where Blows must be looked for; so I had an∣other
Prospect, which I promised my self would
yield equal Profit, or perhaps greater, without
any of the Hazard and Difficulty of the former,
and this was the Gulph of <HI>Mocha</HI> or the <HI>Red
Sea.</HI></P>
<P>I told them that the Trade here was great, the
Ships rich, and the Streight of <HI>Babelmandel</HI> narrow;
so that there was no doubt but we might cruise
so as to let nothing slip our Hands, having the
<PB N="224" REF="226"/>
Seas open from the <HI>Red Sea</HI> along the Coast of
<HI>Arabia,</HI> to the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph, and the <HI>Malabar</HI> Side
of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>I told them, what I had observed when I sailed
round the Island, in my former Progress, how
that on the Northmost Point of the Island were
several very good Harbours, and Roads for our
Ships: That the Natives were even more civil,
and tractable, if possible, than those where we
were, not having been so often ill treated by
<HI>European</HI> Sailors, as those had in the South and
East Sides; and that we might always be sure of
a Retreat, if we were driven to put in by any Ne∣cessity,
either of Enemies or of Weather.</P>
<P>They were easily convinced of the Reasonable∣ness
of my Scheme, and Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> whom
I now called our Admiral, tho' he was at first
of the Mind to go and lye at the Island <HI>Mauritius,</HI>
and wait for some of the <HI>European</HI> Merchant
Ships from the Road of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> or the Bay
of <HI>Bengal,</HI> was now of my Mind. It is true,
we were strong enough to have attacked an <HI>Eng∣lish
East India</HI> Ship of the greatest Force, though
some of them were said to carry fifty Guns; but
I represented to him, that we were sure to have
Blows, and Blood if we took them, and after
we had done, their Loading was not of equal
Value to us, because we had no room to dispose
of their Merchandize: And as our Circumstances
stood, we had rather have taken one outward
bound <HI>East India</HI> Ship, with her ready Cash on
board, perhaps to the Vallue of forty or fifty
Thousand Pound, than three homeward bound,
though their Loading would at <HI>London</HI> be worth
three times the Money; because, we knew not
whither to go to dispose of the Cargo; whereas
<PB N="209" REF="227"/>
the Ships from <HI>London</HI> had Abundance of things
we knew how to make use of, besides their Mo∣ney;
such as their Stores of Provisions, and Li∣quors,
and great Quantities of the like sent to
the Governours and Factories at the <HI>English</HI> Settle∣ments,
for their Use: So that if we resolved to
look for our own Country Ships, it should be
those that were outward bound, not the <HI>London</HI>
Ships homeward.</P>
<P>All these things considered, brought the
Admiral to be of my Mind entirely; so af∣ter
taking in Water, and some fresh Provisi∣ons
where we lay, which was near <HI>Cape St. Mary,</HI>
on the South-West Corner of the Island, we
weighed, and stood away South, and afterwards
S.S.E. to round the Island, and in about six Days
Sail, got out of the Wake of the Island, and
steer'd away North, till we came off of <HI>Port
Dauphin,</HI> and then North by East, to the Latitude
of 13 Degrees, 40 Minutes, which was, in short,
just at the farthest Part of the Island; and the
Admiral keeping a-head, made the open Sea fair
to the West, clear of the whole Island; upon
which he brought to, and we sent the Sloop to
stand in round the farthest Point North, and
coast along the Shore, and see for a Harbour
to put into, which they did, and soon brought
us an Account, that there was a deep Bay, with
a very good Road, and several little Islands under
which they found good Riding, in 10 to 17 Fa∣thom
Water, and accordingly there we put in.</P>
<P>However, we afterwards found Occasion to
remove our Station, as you shall hear presently.
We had now nothing to do, but go on Shore,
and acquaint our selves a little with the Natives,
take in fresh Water, and some fresh Provisions,
<PB N="210" REF="228"/>
and then to Sea again. We found the People ve∣ry
easy to deal with, and some Cattel they had;
but it being at the Extremity of the Island,
they had not such Quantities of Cattel here.
However, for the present, we resolved to ap∣point
this for our Place of Rendezvous, and go
and look out. This was about the latter End
of <HI>April.</HI></P>
<P>Accordingly we put to Sea, and cruised away
to the Northward, for the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coast: It was
a long Run; but as the Winds generally blow
Trade from the South, and S.S.E. from <HI>May</HI>
to <HI>September,</HI> we had good Weather, and in about
twenty Days we made the Island of <HI>Saccatia,</HI>
lying South from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Coast, and E.S.E.
from the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Mocha,</HI> or the
Red Sea.</P>
<P>Here we took in Water, and stood off and on
upon the <HI>Arabian</HI> Shore. We had not cruised
here above three Days, or thereabouts, but I
spy'd a Sail, and gave her Chase; but when we
came up with her, never was such a poor Prize
chased by Pyrates that look'd for Booty; for we
found nothing in her, but poor, half-naked <HI>Turks</HI>
going a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecca,</HI> to the Tomb of
their Prophet <HI>Mahomet;</HI> the Jonk that carry'd
them had no one thing worth taking away, but
a little Rice, and some Coffee, which was all the
poor Wretches had for their Subsistence; so we
let them go, for indeed we knew not what to do
with them.</P>
<P>The same Evening we chased another Jonk
with two Masts, and in something better Plight
to look at than the former. When we came
on board, we found them upon the same Errand,
but only that they were People of some better
<PB N="211" REF="229"/>
Fashion than the other; and here we got some
Plunder, some <HI>Turkish</HI> Stores, a few Diamonds in
the Ear-drops of five or six Persons, some fine
<HI>Persian</HI> Carpets, of which they made their Saffra's
to lye upon, and some Money; so we let them go
also.</P>
<P>We continued here eleven Days longer, and
saw nothing but now and then a Fishing-Boat;
but the twelfth Day of our Cruise, we spy'd a
Ship: Indeed I thought at first it had been an
<HI>English</HI> Ship, but it appeared to be an <HI>European</HI>
freighted for a Voyage from <HI>Goa,</HI> on the Coast of
<HI>Malabar,</HI> to the Red Sea, and was very rich. We
chased her, and took her, without any Fight,
tho' they had some Guns on board too, but not
many. We found her Manned with <HI>Portuguese</HI>
Seamen, but under the Direction of five Mer∣chant
<HI>Turks,</HI> who had hired her on the Coast of
<HI>Malabar,</HI> of some <HI>Portugal</HI> Merchants, and had
loaden her with Pepper, Salt-petre, some Spices,
and the rest of the Loading was chiefly Callicoes
and wrought Silks, some of them very rich.</P>
<P>We took her, and carried her to <HI>Saccatia,</HI> but
we really knew not what to do with her, for the
same Reasons as before; for all their Goods were
of little or no Value to us. After some Days we
found Means to let one of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Merchants
know, that if he would ransom the Ship, we
would take a Sum of Money, and let them go.
He told me, if I would let one of them go on
Shore for the Money, they would do it: So we
adjusted the Value of the Cargo at 30000 Du∣cats.
Upon this Agreement we allowed the Sloop
to carry him on Shore at <HI>Dofar</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> where
a rich Merchant laid down the Money for them,
and came off with our Sloop; and on Payment
<PB N="212" REF="230"/>
of the Money, we very fairly and honestly let
them go.</P>
<P>Some Days after this, we took an <HI>Arabian</HI> Jonk
going from the Gulph of <HI>Persia</HI> to <HI>Mocha,</HI> with a
good Quantity of Pearl on board; we gutted
him of the Pearl, which, it seems, was belong∣ing
to some Merchants at <HI>Mocha,</HI> and let him go,
for there was nothing else worth our taking.</P>
<P>We continued cruising up and down here, till
we began to find our Provisions grow low, when
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> our Admiral told us, 'twas time
to think of going back to the Rendezvous, and
the rest of the Men said the same, being a little
weary of beating about for above three Months
together, and meeting with little or nothing com∣par'd
to our great Expectations. But I was very
loath to part with the Red Sea at so cheap a Rate,
and press'd them to tarry a little longer, which
at my Instance we did; but three Days after∣wards,
to our great Misfortune, understood, that
by Landing the <HI>Turkish</HI> Merchants at <HI>Dofar,</HI> we
had alarmed the Coast as far as the Gulph of
<HI>Persia,</HI> so that no Vessel would stir that Way, and
consequently nothing was to be expected on that
Side.</P>
<P>I was greatly mortify'd at this News, and
could no longer withstand the Importunities of
the Men, to return to <HI>Madagascar.</HI> However, as
the Winds continued still to blow at S.S.E. to
E. by S. we were obliged to stand away towards
the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the <HI>Cape Guarde Foy,</HI> the
Winds being more variable under the Shore, than
in the open Sea.</P>
<P>Here we chopp'd upon a Booty which we did
not look for, and which made Amends for all our
Waiting; for the very same Hour that we made
<PB N="213" REF="231"/>
Land, we spy'd a large Vessel sailing along the
Shore, to the Southward. The Ship was of <HI>Bengal,</HI>
belonging to the Great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Country, but had
on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> Pilot, whose Name, if I remem∣ber
right, was <HI>Vanderdiest,</HI> and several <HI>European</HI>
Seamen, whereof three were <HI>English.</HI> She was in
no Condition to resist us; the rest of her Seamen
were <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Subjects, some <HI>Mala∣bars,</HI>
and some others. There were five <HI>Indian</HI>
Merchants on board, and some <HI>Armenian:</HI> It seems
they had been at <HI>Mocha</HI> with Spices, Silks, Dia∣monds,
Pearls, Callicoe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> such Goods as the
Country afforded, and had little on board now
but Money in Pieces of Eight, which, by the
Way, was just what we wanted; and the three
<HI>English</HI> Seamen came along with us, and the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Pilot would have done so too; but the two <HI>Arme∣nian</HI>
Merchants entreated us not to take him;
for that he being their Pilot, there was none of
the Men knew how to guide the Ship: So, at
their Request, we refused him; but we made
them promise he should not be used ill for be∣ing
willing to go with us.</P>
<P>We got near 200000 Pieces of Eight in this
Vessel; and if they said true, there was a <HI>Jew</HI> of
<HI>Goa</HI> who intended to have embark'd with them,
who had 200000 Pieces of Eight with him, all
his own; but his good Fortune springing out of
his ill Fortune, hinder'd him, for he fell sick at
<HI>Mocha,</HI> and could not be ready to travel, which
was the Saving of his Money.</P>
<P>There was none with me at the Taking this
Prize, but the Sloop; for Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Ship
proving leaky, he went away for the Rendezvous
before us, and arrived there the Middle of <HI>Decem∣ber;</HI>
but not liking the Port, he left a great Cross
<PB N="214" REF="232"/>
on Shore, with Directions written on a Plate of
Lead fixt to it, for us to come after him to the
great Bay of <HI>Mangahelly,</HI> where he found a ve∣ry
good Harbour; but we learnt a Piece of News
here, that kept us from him a great while, which
the Admiral took Offence at; but we stopt his
Mouth with his Share of 200000 Pieces of Eight
to him and his Ship's Crew. But the Story which
interrupted our coming to him was this. Between
<HI>Mangahelly</HI> and another Point called <HI>Cape St. Seba∣stian,</HI>
there came on Shore in the Night, an
<HI>European</HI> Ship; and whether by Stress of Wea∣ther,
or Want of a Pilot, I know not, but the
Ship stranded, and could not be got off.</P>
<P>We lay in the Cove, or Harbour, where, as
I have said, our Rendezvous was appointed, and
had not yet been on Shore, so we had not seen
the Directions our Admiral had left for us.</P>
<P>Our Friend <HI>William,</HI> of whom I have said no∣thing
a great while, had a great Mind one Day
to go on Shore, and importuned me to let him
have a little Troop to go with him, for Safety,
that they might see the Country. I was mighti∣ly
against it for many Reasons; but particularly
I told him, he knew the Natives were but Sava∣ges,
and they were very treacherous, and I desi∣red
him that he would not go; and had he gone
on much farther, I believe I should have down∣right
refused him, and commanded him not to
go.</P>
<P>But in order to perswade me to let him go,
he told me, he would give me an Account of the
Reason why he was so importunate. He told
me, the last Night he had a Dream, which was
so forcible, and made such an Impression upon
his Mind, that he could not be quiet till he had
<PB N="215" REF="233"/>
made the Proposal to me to go, and if I refu∣sed
him, then he thought his Dream was signi∣ficant,
and if not, then his Dream was at an
End.</P>
<P>His Dream was, he said, that he went on Shore
with 30 Men, of which the Cockswain he said
was one, upon the Island, and that they found a
Mine of Gold, and enrich'd them all; but this
was not the main thing he said, but that the
same Morning he had dreamt so, the Cockswain
came to him just then, and told him, that he
dreamt he went on Shore on the Island of <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI>
and that some Men came to him and
told him, they would shew him where he should
get a Prize would make them all rich.</P>
<P>These two things put together began to weigh
with me a little, tho' I was never inclined to
give any Heed to Dreams; but <HI>William</HI>'s Impor∣tunity
turn'd me effectually, for I always put
a great deal of Stress upon his Judgment: So
that in short, I gave them Leave to go; but I
charged them not to go far off from the Sea Coast,
that if they were forced down to the Sea-Side
upon any Occasion, we might perhaps see them,
and fetch them off with our Boats.</P>
<P>They went away early in the Morning, one and
thirty Men of them in Number, very well arm'd,
and very stout Fellows; they travell'd all the Day,
and at Night made us a Signal that all was well,
from the Top of a Hill, which we had agreed on,
by making a great Fire.</P>
<P>Next Day they march'd down the Hill on the
other Side, inclining towards the Sea-Side, as
they had promised, and saw a very pleasant Valley
before them with a River in the Middle of it,
which a little farther below them seemed to be
<PB N="216" REF="234"/>
big enough to bear small Ships: They marched
a-pace towards this River, and were surprized
with the Noise of a Piece going off, which by
the Sound could not be far off; they listened
long, but could hear no more, so they went
on to the River Side, which was a very fine
fresh Stream, but widened a-pace, and they
kept on by the Banks of it, till almost at once
it opened or widened into a good large Creek,
or Harbour, about five Miles from the Sea;
and that which was still more surprizing, as
they marched forward, they plainly saw in
the Mouth of the Harbour, or Creek, the Wreck
of a Ship.</P>
<P>The Tide was up, as we call it, that did not
appear very much above the Water, but as they
made downwards, they found it grew bigger,
and bigger, and the Tide soon after ebbing out,
they found it lay dry upon the Sands, and ap∣peared
to be the Wreck of a considerable
Vessel, larger than could be expected in that
Country.</P>
<P>After some time, <HI>William</HI> taking out his Glass
to look at it more nearly, was surprized with
hearing a Musquet Shot whistle by him, and
immediately after that, he heard the Gun, and
saw the Smoke from the other Side; upon which
our Men immediately fired three Musquets to
discover, if possible, what or who they were.
Upon the Noise of these Guns, Abundance of Men
came running down to the Shore, from among
some Trees, and our Men could easily perceive
that they were <HI>Europeans,</HI> tho' they knew not of
what Nation: However, our Men halloo'd to
them, as loud as they could, and by and by
they got a long Pole, and set it up, and hung a
<PB N="217" REF="235"/>
white Shirt upon it for a Flag of Truce. They
on the other Side saw it, by the help of their
Glasses too, and quickly after, our Men see
a Boat launch off from the Shore, as they
thought, but it was from another Creek it seems,
and immediately they came rowing over the
Creek to our Men, carrying also a white Flag as
a Token of Truce.</P>
<P>It is not easy to describe the Surprize of Joy
and Satisfaction that appeared on both Sides, to
see not only white Men, but <HI>English</HI> Men, in a
Place so remote; but what then must it be, when
they came to know one another, and to find that
they were not only Country Men, but Comrades,
and that this was the very Ship that Captain
<HI>Wilmot,</HI> our Admiral, commanded, and whose
Company we had lost in the Storm at <HI>Tobago,</HI>
after making an Agreement to Rendezvous at
<HI>Madagascar?</HI></P>
<P>They had, it seems, got Intelligence of us, when
they came to the South Part of the Island, and
had been a roving as far as the Gulph of <HI>Bengal,</HI>
when they met Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> with whom they
joined, took several rich Prizes, and amongst the
rest, one Ship with the great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Daughter,
and an immense Treasure in Money and Jewels,
and from thence they came about the Coast of
<HI>Coromandel,</HI> and afterwards that of <HI>Malabar,</HI> into
the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> where they also took
some Prize, and then designed for the South Part
of <HI>Madagascar;</HI> but the Winds blowing hard at
S. E. and S. E. by E. they came to the North∣ward
of the Isle, and being after that separated
by a furious Tempest from the N. W. they were
forced into the Mouth of that Creek, where they
lost their Ship. And they told us also, that they
<PB N="218" REF="236"/>
heard that Captain <HI>Avery</HI> himself had lost his
Ship also, not far off.</P>
<P>When they had thus acquainted one another
with their Fortunes, the poor over-joyed Men
were in Haste to go back to communicate their
Joy to their Comrades; and leaving some of their
Men with ours, the rest went back; and <HI>William</HI>
was so earnest to see them, that he and two more
went back with them, and there he came to
their little Camp where they lived. There were
about a hundred and sixty Men of them in all; they
had got their Guns on Shore, and some Ammu∣nition,
but a good deal of their Powder was
spoil'd. However they had raised a fair Platform,
and mounted twelve Pieces of Cannon upon it,
which was a sufficient Defence to them on
that Side of the Sea; and just at the End of
the Platform they had made a Launch, and a
little Yard, and were all hard at Work building
another little Ship, as I may call it, to go to Sea
in, but they put a Stop to this Work upon the
News they had of our being come in.</P>
<P>When our Men went into their Hutts, it was
surprizing indeed to see the vast Stock of Wealth
they had got, in Gold, and Silver, and Jewels,
which however they told was a Trifle to what
Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> had wherever he was gone.</P>
<P>It was five Days we had waited for our Men,
and no News of them, and indeed, I gave them
over for lost; but was surprized, after five
Days waiting, to see a Ship's Boat come rowing
towards us along Shore; what to make of it, I
could not tell, but was at last better satisfied,
when our Men told me they heard them halloo,
and saw them wave their Caps to us.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="237"/>
In a little time they came quite up to us, and
I saw Friend <HI>William</HI> stand up in the Boat and
make Signs to us; so they came on Board: But
when I saw there was but fifteen of our one and
thirty Men, I asked him what was become of
their Fellows? <HI>O!</HI> says William, <HI>they are all very
well, and my Dream is fully made good, and the Cock∣swain's
too.</HI></P>
<P>This made me very impatient to know how
the Case stood; so he told us the whole Story,
which indeed surprized us all. The next Day
we weighed, and stood away Southerly to join
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> and his Ship at <HI>Mangahelly,</HI> where
we found him, as I said, a little chagrin at our
Stay; but we pacified him afterwards with tel∣ling
him the History of <HI>William</HI>'s Dream, and the
Consequence of it.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Camp of our Comrades
was so near <HI>Mangahelly,</HI> that our Admiral, and I,
Friend <HI>William,</HI> and some of the Men, resolved
to take the Sloop, and go and see them, and
fetch them all, and their Goods, Bag and
Baggage, on board our Ship, which accor∣dingly
we did; and found their Camp, their For∣tifications,
the Battery of Guns they had erected,
their Treasure, and all the Men, just as <HI>William</HI>
had related it; so after some Stay, we took all the
Men into the Sloop, and brought them away
with us.</P>
<P>It was some time before we knew what was
become of Captain <HI>Avery;</HI> but after about a
Month, by the Direction of the Men who had
lost their Ship, we sent the Sloop to cruise along
the Shore, to find out, if possible, where they
were, and in about a Week's Cruise our Men
found them; and particularly, that they had lost
their Ship, as well as our Men had lost theirs,
<PB N="220" REF="238"/>
and that they were every Way in as bad a Con∣dition
as ours.</P>
<P>It was about ten Days before the Sloop re∣turned,
and Captain <HI>Avery</HI> with them; and
this was the whole Force that, as I remember,
Captain <HI>Avery</HI> ever had with him; for now
we joined all our Companies together, and it
stood thus: We had two Ships and a Sloop, in
which, we had three Hundred and twenty Men,
but much too few to Man them as they ought
to be, the great <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ship requiring of
her self near 400 Men to Man her compleatly:
As for our lost, <HI>but now found</HI> Comrade, her Com∣pliment
of Men was 180, or there abouts, and
Captain <HI>Avery</HI> had about three Hundred Men
with him, whereof, he had ten Carpenters with
him, most of which were taken aboard the Prize
they had taken; so that, in a Word, all the Force
<HI>Avery</HI> had at <HI>Madagascar</HI> in the Year 1699, or
thereabouts, amounted to our three Ships, for
his own was lost, as you have heard, and never
had any more than about twelve Hundred Men
in all.</P>
<P>It was about a Month after this, that all our
Crews got together, and as <HI>Avery</HI> was unshipt,
we all agreed to bring our own Company into
the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Man of War and the Sloop, and
give Captain <HI>Avery</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Frigate, with all
the Tackles, and Furniture Guns, and Ammuni∣tion
for his Crew by themselves; for which they
being full of Wealth, agreed to give us Forty
Thousand Pieces of Eight.</P>
<P>It was next considered, what Course we should
take: Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> to give him his due, pro∣posed
our building a little City here, establish∣ing
our selves on Shore, with a good Fortifica∣tion,
<PB N="221" REF="239"/>
and Works proper to defend our selves;
and that, as we had Wealth enough, and could
encrease it to what Degree we pleased, we
should content our selves to retire here, and bid
Defiance to the World. But I soon convinc'd him
that this Place would be no Security to us, if we
pretended to carry on our cruising Trade: For
that then all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and indeed of
that Part of the World, would be engaged to root
us out. But if we resolved to live there, as in a
Retirement, and plant in the Country, as private
Men, and give over our Trade of Pyrating, then
indeed we might Plant, and settle our selves
where we pleased; but then I told him, the
best Way would be to treat with the Natives,
and buy a Tract of Land of them, farther up the
Country, seated upon some navigable River, where
Boats might go up and down for Pleasure, but
not Ships to endanger us: That thus Planting the
high Ground with Cattle, such as Cows and
Goats, of which the Country also was full, to be
sure we might live here as well as any Men in
the World; and I owned to him, I thought it was
a good Retreat for those that were willing to leave
off, and lay down, and yet did not care to venture
home and be hanged; that is to say, to run the
Risque of it.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> however he made no positive
Discovery of his Intentions, seemed to me to de∣cline
my Notion of going up into the Country
to Plant; on the contrary, it was apparent he was
of Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Opinion, that they might
maintain themselves on Shore, and yet carry on
their cruising Trade too; and upon this they
resolved: But as I afterwards understood, about
fifty of their Men went up the Country, and
<PB N="222" REF="240"/>
settled themselves in an Inland Place, as a Co∣lony;
whether they are there still or not, I cannot
tell, or how many of them are left alive; but it's
my Opinion, they are there still, and that they
are considerably encreased, for as I hear, they
have got some Women among them, tho' not
many; for it seems five <HI>Dutch</HI> Women, and three
or four little Girls were taken by them in a
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ship which they afterwards took going to
<HI>Mocha,</HI> and three of those Women marrying
some of these Men, went with them to live in
their new Plantation; but of this I only speak
by Hear-say.</P>
<P>As we lay here some time, I found our Peo∣ple
mightily divided in their Notions; some were
for going this Way, and some that, till at last I
began to foresee they would part Company, and
perhaps we should not have Men enough to keep
together, to Man the great Ship, so I took Cap∣tain
<HI>Wilmot</HI> aside, and began to talk to him
about it; but soon perceived that he enclined
himself to stay at <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and having got a
vast Wealth for his own Share, had secret Designs
of getting Home some Way or other.</P>
<P>I argued the Impossibility of it, and the Hazard
he would run, either of falling into the Hands
of Thieves and Murtherers in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> who
would never let such a Treasure as his was
pass their Hands, or of his falling into the
Hands of the <HI>English, Dutch,</HI> or <HI>French,</HI> who would
certainly hang him for a Pyrate. I gave him an
Account of the Voyage I had made from this
very Place to the Continent of <HI>Africk,</HI> and what
a Journey it was to travel on Foot.</P>
<P>In short, nothing could perswade him, but he
would go into the <HI>Red Sea</HI> with the Sloop, and
<PB N="223" REF="241"/>
where the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> past through the
Sea dry-shod, and landing there, would travel
to <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> by Land, which is not above
eighty Miles, and from thence he said he could
Ship himself by the Way of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> to any
Part of the World.</P>
<P>I represented the Hazard, and indeed the Im∣possibility
of his passing by <HI>Mocha,</HI> and <HI>Judda,</HI>
without being attack'd, if he offered it by Force;
or plundered, if he went to get Leave, and ex∣plained
the Reasons of it so much, and so effectu∣ally,
that tho' at last he would not hearken to
it himself, none of his Men would go with him.
They told him, they would go any where with
him, to serve him, but that this was running
himself and them into certain Destruction, with∣out
any Possibility of avoiding it, or Probability
of answering his End. The Captain took what I
said to him quite wrong, and pretended to resent
it, and gave me some Buccanier Words upon it;
but I gave him no Return to it, but this, that I
advised him for his Advantage, that if he did
not understand it so, it was his Fault, not mine;
that I did not forbid him to go, nor had I offered
to perswade any of the Men not to go with him,
tho' it was to their apparent Destruction.</P>
<P>However, warm Heads are not easily cooled;
the Captain was so eager, that he quitted our
Company, and with most Part of his Crew, went
over to Captain <HI>Avery,</HI> and sorted with his Peo∣ple,
taking all the Treasure with him, which, by
the Way, was not very fair in him, we having
agreed to share all our Gains, whether more or
less, whether absent or present.</P>
<P>Our Men mutter'd a little at it, but I paci∣fied
them as well as I could, and told them, it
<PB N="224" REF="242"/>
was easy for us to get as much, if we minded
our Hits; and Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> had set us a very
good Example: For by the same Rule, the Agree∣ment
of any farther Sharing of Profits with them,
was at an End. I took this Occasion to put into
their Heads, some Part of my farther Designs,
which were, to range over the Eastern Sea, and
see if we could not make our selves as rich as
Mr. <HI>Avery,</HI> who, it was true, had gotten a pro∣digious
deal of Money, tho' not one Half of
what was said of it in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Our Men were so pleased with my forward,
enterprizing Temper, that they assured me that
they would go with me, one and all, over the
whole Globe, wherever I would carry them;
and as for Captain <HI>Wilmot,</HI> they would have
nothing more to do with him. This came to
his Ears, and put him into a great Rage; so
that he threaten'd, if I came on Shore, he would
cut my Throat.</P>
<P>I had Information of it privately, but took no
Notice of it at all, only I took Care not to go
unprovided for him, and seldom walked about
but in very good Company. However, at last
Captain <HI>Wilmot</HI> and I met, and talked over the
Matter very seriously, and I offered him the Sloop
to go where he pleased: Or, if he was not satis∣fied
with that, I offered to take the Sloop, and
leave him the great Ship. But he declined both,
and only desired that I would leave him six Car∣penters,
which I had in our Ship, more than I
had need of, to help his Men to finish the Sloop
that was begun before we came thither, by the
Men that lost his Ship. This I consented rea∣dily
to, and lent him several other Hands that
were useful to them, and in a little time they
<PB N="225" REF="243"/>
built a stout Brigantine able to carry fourteen
Guns, and two Hundred Men.</P>
<P>What Measures they took, and how Captain
<HI>Avery</HI> managed afterwards, is too long a Story
to meddle with here; nor is it any of my Bu∣siness,
having my own Story still upon my Hands.</P>
<P>We lay here about these several simple Dis∣putes
almost five Months, when about the latter
End of <HI>March</HI> I set Sail with the great Ship,
having in her forty four Guns, and four hundred
Men, and the Sloop, carrying eighty Men. We
did not steer to the <HI>Malabar</HI> Coast, and so to the
Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> as was at first intended, the
East Monsoons blowing yet too strong, but we
kept more under the <HI>African</HI> Coast, where we had
the Wind variable till we pass'd the Line, and
made the Cape <HI>Bassa</HI> in the Latitude of four De∣grees
10 Minutes; from thence, the Monsoons be∣ginning
to change to the N. E. and N. N. E. we
led it away, with the Wind large, to the <HI>Mal∣divies,</HI>
a famous Ledge of Islands, well known by
all the Sailors who have gone into those Parts
of the World; and, leaving these Islands a little
to the South, we made Cape <HI>Comerin,</HI> the Souther∣most
Land of the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and went
round the Isle of <HI>Ceylon.</HI> Here we lay by a while,
to wait for Purchase; and here we saw three
large <HI>English East-India</HI> Ships going from <HI>Bengal,</HI>
or from Fort St. <HI>George,</HI> home ward for <HI>England,</HI>
or rather for <HI>Bombay</HI> and <HI>Surat,</HI> till the Trade
set in.</P>
<P>We brought to, and hoisting an <HI>English</HI> An∣cient
and Pendant, lay by for them, as if we
intended to attack them. They could not tell
what to make of us a good while, though they
saw our Colours; and, I believe, at first they
<PB N="226" REF="244"/>
thought us to be <HI>French;</HI> but as they came nearer
to us, we let them soon see what we were, for
we hoisted a black Flag with two cross Daggers
in it, on our Main Top-mast Head, which let
them see what they were to expect.</P>
<P>We soon found the Effect of this; for, at first
they spread their Antients, and made up to us
in a Line as if they would fight us, having the
Wind off Shore fair enough, to have brought
them on board us; but when they saw what
Force we were of, and found we were Cruisers
of another kind, they stood away from us again,
with all the Sail they could make. If they had
come up, we should have given them an unex∣pect
Welcome, but as it was, we had no Mind to
follow them, so we let them go for the same
Reasons which I mentioned before.</P>
<P>But though we let them pass, we did not de∣sign
to let others go, at so easy a Price: It was
but the next Morning that we saw a Sail, stand∣ing
round Cape <HI>Comeriw,</HI> and steering, as we
thought, the same Course with us. We knew not
at first what to do with her, because she had
the Shore on her Larboard Quarter, and if we
offered to chase her, she might put into any Port
or Creek, and escape us; but to prevent this,
we sent the Sloop, to get in between her and the
Land; as soon as she saw that, she haled in to
keep the Land aboard, and when the Sloop stood
towards her, she made right ashore with all the
Canvas she could spread.</P>
<P>The Sloop however came up with her, and
engaged her, and found she was a Vessel of ten
Guns, <HI>Portuguese</HI> built, but in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders
Hands, and manned by <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> who were bound
from the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to fetch
<PB N="227" REF="245"/>
Spices and other Goods from thence. The Sloop's
Men took her, and had the Rummaging of her
before we came up: She had in her some <HI>European</HI>
Goods, and a good round Sum of Money, and
some Pearl; so that tho' we did not go to the
Gulph for the Pearl, the Pearl came to us out
of the Gulph, and we had our Share of it. This
was a rich Ship, and the Goods were of very
considerable Value, besides the Money and the
Pearl.</P>
<P>We had a long Consulation here, what we
should do with the Men; for, to give them the
Ship, and let them pursue their Voyage to <HI>Java,</HI>
would be to alarm the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory there, who
are by far the strongest in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to
make our Passage that Way impracticable; where∣as
we resolved to visit that Part of the World,
in our Way, but were not willing to pass the
great Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> where we hoped for a great
deal of Purchase; and therefore it behoved us not
to be Way-laid before we came there, because they
knew we must pass by the Streights of <HI>Malacca,</HI>
or those of <HI>Sundy,</HI> and either Way it was very
easy to prevent us.</P>
<P><HI>While we were consulting this in the great
Cabin, the Men had had the same Debate be∣fore
the Mast, and it seems the Majority there
were for pickling up the poor</HI> Dutchmen <HI>among
the Herrings; in a Word, they were for throw∣ing
them all into the Sea. Poor</HI> William <HI>the
Quaker was in great Concern about this, and
comes directly to me, to talk about it.</HI> Hark
thee, <HI>says William,</HI> what wilt thou do with these
<HI>Dutchmen</HI> thou hast on board, thou wilt not let them
go I suppose, <HI>says he?</HI> Why <HI>says I, William,</HI> would
you advise me to let them go? No, <HI>says William,</HI> I can∣not
<PB N="228" REF="246"/>
say it is fit for thee to let them go; that is to say,
to go on with their Voyage to <HI>Batavia,</HI> because it is not
for thy Turn, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Batavia</HI> should have
any Knowledge of thy being in these Seas. West then, <HI>says
I,</HI> to him, I know no Remedy but to throw them Over-board.
You know <HI>William, says I,</HI> a <HI>Dutchman</HI> swims
like a Fish, and all our People here are of the same Opini∣on
as well as I; at the same time I resolved it should not
be done, but wanted to hear what <HI>William</HI> would say:
But he gravely replyed, if all the Men in the Ship were
of that Mind, I will never believe that thou wilt be of
that Mind thy self; for I have heard thee protest a∣gainst
Cruelty in all other Cases. Well <HI>William says I,</HI>
that is true, but what then shall we do with them?
Why, <HI>says William,</HI> is there no way but to murther
them? I am perswaded thou canst not be in earnest; no
indeed <HI>William, says I,</HI> I am not in earnest, but
they shall not go <HI>Iava,</HI> no nor to <HI>Ceylon,</HI> that is certain.
But, <HI>says William,</HI> the Men have done thee no Injury
at all, Thou hast taken a great Treasure from them,
what canst thou pretend to hurt them for? Nay, <HI>William,
says I,</HI> do not talk of that, I have Pretence enough if
that be all: My Pretence is to prevent doing me hurt,
and that is as necessary a Piece of the Law of Self-Pre∣servation as any you can name; but the main Thing is,
I know not what to do with them to prevent their
prating.</P>
<P>While <HI>William</HI> and I was talking, the poo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Dutchmen</HI> were openly condemned to die as it
may be called, by the whole Ship's Company; and
so warm were the Men upon it, that they grew
very clamorous; and when they heard that <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
was against it, some of them swore they
should die, and if <HI>William</HI> opposed it, he should
drown along with them.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="247"/>
But, as I was resolved to put an End
to their cruel Project, so I found itwas time to
take upon me a little, or the bloody Humour
might grow too strong; so I called the <HI>Dutchmen</HI>
up, and talked a little with them. First, I asked
them if they were willing to go with us; two of
them offered it presently, but the rest, which
were fourteen, declined it. Well then, said I,
where would you go? They desired they should
go to <HI>Ceylon.</HI> No, I told them, I could not allow
them to go to any <HI>Dutch</HI> Factory, and told them
very plainly the Reasons of it, which they could
not deny to be just. I let them know also the
cruel bloody Measures of our Men, but that I
had resolved to save them, if possible, and there∣fore
I told them, I would set them on Shore at
some <HI>English</HI> factory in the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> or put
them on board any <HI>English</HI> Ship I met, after I
was past the Streights of <HI>Sundy</HI> or of <HI>Malacca,</HI> but
not before; for as to my coming back again, I told
them, I would run the venture of their <HI>Dutch</HI> Power
from <HI>Batavia,</HI> but I would not have the News
come there before me, because it would make all
their Merchant Ships lay up, and keep out of
our Way.</P>
<P>It come next into our Consideration, what we
should do with their Ship? but this was not long
resolving; for there were but two Ways, either
to set her on Fire, or to run her on Shore, and we
chose the last; so we set her Fore-Sail with the
Tack at the Cat-head, and leasht her Helm a little
to Starboard, to answer her Head-Sail, and so set
her a-going, with neither Cat or Dog in her, and
it was not above two Hours before we saw her
run right ashore upon the Coast, a little beyond
<PB N="230" REF="248"/>
the Cape <HI>Comerin,</HI> and away we went round about
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> for the Coast of <HI>Coromandel.</HI></P>
<P>We sailed along there, not in Sight of the Shore,
only, but so near, as to see the Ships in the Road
at <HI>Fort St. David, Fort St. George,</HI> and at the
other Factories along that Shore, as well as along
the Coast of <HI>Galconda,</HI> carying our <HI>English</HI> Anti∣ent,
when we came near the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories,
and <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours when we past by the <HI>English</HI>
Factories. We met with little Purchase upon
this Coast, except two small Vessels of <HI>Golconda,</HI>
bound cross the Bay with Bales of Callicoes and
Muslins, and wrought Silks, and fifteen Bales of
Romalls, from the Bottom of the Bay, which were
going, on whose Account we knew not, to <HI>Achin,</HI>
and to other Ports on the Coast of <HI>Malacca;</HI> we
did not enquire to what Place in particular, but
we let the Vessels go, having none but <HI>Indians</HI> on
board.</P>
<P>In the Bottom of the Bay, we met with a
great <HI>Jonk</HI> belonging to the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Court, with
a great many People, Passengers as we supposed
them to be; it seems they were bound for the
River <HI>Hugely,</HI> or <HI>Ganges</HI> and came from <HI>Sumatra;</HI>
this was a Prize worth taking indeed, and we
got so much Gold in her, besides other Goods
which we did not meddle with, Peper in par∣ticular,
that it had like to have put an End to
our Cruise; for almost all my Men said we
were rich enough, and desired to go back again
to <HI>Madagascar;</HI> but I had other things in my
Head still, and when I came to talk to them,
and set Friend <HI>William</HI> to talk with them, we
put such further Golden Hopes into their Heads,
that we soon prevailed with them to let us
go on.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="249"/>
My next Design was, to leave all the dange∣rous
Streights of <HI>Malacca, Sincapore,</HI> and <HI>Sundy,</HI>
where we could expect no great Booty, but
what we might light on in <HI>European</HI> Ships,
which we must fight for; and tho' we were able to
fight, and wanted no Courage, even to Despera∣tion;
yet we were rich too, and resolved to be
richer, and took this for our Maxim: That while
we were sure the Wealth we sought was to be
had without fighting, we had no Occasion to
put our selves to the Necessity of fighting for
that which would come upon easy Terms.</P>
<P>We left therefore the Bay of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and coming
to the Coast of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> we put in at a small
Port, where there was a Town, inhabited only
by <HI>Mallayans,</HI> and here we took in fresh Water,
and a large Quantity of good Pork pickled up,
and well salted, notwithstanding the Heat of
the Climate, being in the very Middle of the
<HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> viz. In three Degrees, fifteen Mi∣nutes
North Latitude. We also took on board
both our Vessels, forty Hogs alive, which ser∣ved
us for fresh Provisions, having Abundance of
Food for them such as the Country produce;
such as Guams, Potatoes, and a sort of coarse
Rice good for nothing else, but to feed the
Swine. We killed one of these Hogs every Day,
and found them to be excellent Meat. We took
in also a monstrous Quantity of Ducks, and Cocks
and Hens, the same kind as we have in <HI>England,</HI>
which we kept for Change of Provisions, and if I
remember right, we had no less than two Thou∣sand
of them; so that at first we were pestered
with them very much, but we soon lessened
them by boiling, roasting, stewing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for we
never wanted while we had them.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="250"/>
My long projected Design now lay open to
me, which was, to fall in amongst the <HI>Dutch</HI>
Spice Islands, and see what Mischief I could do
there; accordingly we put out to Sea, the 12th
of <HI>August,</HI> and passing the Line the 17th, we stood
away due South leaving the Straits of <HI>Sundy,</HI> and
the Isle of <HI>Iava</HI> on the East, till we came to the
Latitude of eleven Degrees, twenty Minutes,
when we steered East and E. N. E. having easy
Gales from the W. S. W. till we came among
the <HI>Moluccas,</HI> or Spice Islands.</P>
<P>We passed those Seas with less Difficulty than
in other Places, the Winds to the South of <HI>Iava,</HI>
being more variable, and the Weather good, tho'
sometimes we met with Squauly Weather, and
short Storms; but when we came in among
the Spice Islands themselves, we had a Share of
the Monsoones, or Trade Winds, and made use
of them accordingly.</P>
<P>The infinite Number of Islands which lye in
these Seas, embarrast us strangely, and it was with
great Difficulty that we worked our Way thro'
them; then we steered for the North Side of the
<HI>Phillipines,</HI> where we had a double Chance for Pur∣chase,
<HI>viz.</HI> either to meet with the <HI>Spanish</HI>
Ships from <HI>Acapulco</HI> on the Coast of <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
or we were certain not to fail of finding some
Ships or Jonks of <HI>China,</HI> who, if they came
from <HI>China,</HI> would have a great Quantity of
Goods of Value on Board, as well as Money;
or if we took them going back, we should find
them loaden with Nutmegs and Cloves from <HI>Ban∣da</HI>
and <HI>Ternate,</HI> or from some of the other
Islands.</P>
<P>We were right in our Guesses here to a tittle,
and we steered directly through a large Out-let,
<PB N="233" REF="251"/>
which they call a Streight, tho' it be fifteen Miles
broad, and to an Island they call <HI>Daurma,</HI> and
from thence N. N. E. to <HI>Banda;</HI> between these
Islands we met with a <HI>Dutch</HI> Jonque, or Vessel
going to <HI>Amboyna.</HI> We took her without much
Trouble, and I had much ado to prevent our
Men murthering all the Men, as soon as they
heard them say, they belonged to <HI>Amboyna,</HI> the
Reason I suppose any one will guess.</P>
<P>We took out of her about sixteen Ton of Nut∣megs,
some Provisions, and their small Arms,
for they had no great Guns, and let the Ship go:
From thence we sailed directly to the <HI>Banda</HI>
Island or Islands, where we were sure to get
more Nutmegs, if we thought fit; for my Part
I would willingly have got more Nutmegs, tho'
I had paid for them, but our People abhorred
paying for any thing; so we got about twelve
Ton more at several times, most of them from
Shore, and only a few in a small Boat of the Na∣tives,
which was going to <HI>Gilolo.</HI> We would have
traded openly, but the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have made
themselves Masters of all those Islands, forbid
the People dealing with us, or any Strangers
whatever, and keep them so in Awe, that they
durst not do it; so we could indeed have made
nothing of it, if we had stay'd longer, and there∣fore
resolved to be gone for <HI>Ternate,</HI> and see if we
could make up our Loading with Cloves.</P>
<P>Accordingly we stood away North, but found
our selves so intangled among innumerable Islands,
and without any Pilot that understood the Chan∣nel
and Races between them, that we were obli∣ged
to give it over, and resolved to go back again
to <HI>Banda,</HI> and see what we could get among the
other Islands thereabouts.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="252"/>
The first Adventure we made here, had like to
have been fatal to us all, for the Sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>op being a∣head,
made the Signal to us for seeing a Sail, and
afterwards another, and a third, by which we
understood she saw three Sail, whereupon we
made more Sail to come up with her, but on a
sudden was gotten among some Rocks, falling
foul upon them in such a Manner as frighted us
all very heartily; for having it seems but just
Water enough as it were to an Inch, our Rudder
struck upon the Top of a Rock, which gave us a
terrible Shock, and split a great Piece off of the
Rudder, and indeed disabled it so, that our Ship
would not steer at all; at least not so as to be de∣pended
upon, and we were glad to Hand all our
Sails, except our Fore-sail and Main-top-sail, and
with them we stood away to the East, to see if we
could find any Creek or Harbour, where we
might lay the Ship on Shore, and repair our Rud∣der;
besides, we found the Ship her self had re∣ceived
some Damage, for she had some little Leak
near her Stern Post, but a great Way under
Water.</P>
<P>By this Mischance we lost the Advantages,
whatever they were, of the three Sail of Ships
which we afterward came to hear, were small
<HI>Dutch</HI> Ships from <HI>Batavia,</HI> going to <HI>Banda</HI> and
<HI>Amboyna,</HI> to load Spice, and no doubt had a good
Quantity of Money on board.</P>
<P>Upon the Disaster I have been speaking of, you
may very well suppose that we came to an An∣chor
as soon as we could, which was upon a small
Island not far from <HI>Banda,</HI> where tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI>
keep no Factory, yet they come at the Season to
buy Nutmegs and Mace. We stay'd there thir∣teen
Days; but there being no Place where we
<PB N="235" REF="253"/>
could lay the Ship on Shore, we sent the Sloop to
cruise among the Islands, to look out for a Place
fit for us. In the mean time we got very good
Water here, some Provisions, Roots, and Fruits,
and a good Quantity of Nutmegs and Mace, which
we found Ways to trade with the Natives for,
without the Knowledge of their Masters the
<HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>At length our Sloop return'd, having found an∣other
Island where there was a very good Har∣bour,
we run in, and came to an Anchor. We
immediately unbent all our Sails, sent them a∣shore
upon the Island, and set up seven or eight
Tents with them: Then we unrigged our Top∣masts,
and cut them down, hoisted all our Guns
out, our Provisions and Loading, and put them
ashore in the Tents. With the Guns we made
two small Batteries, for fear of a Surprize, and
kept a Look out upon the Hill. When we were
all ready, we laid the Ship a-ground upon a
hard Sand, the upper End of the Harbour, and
shor'd her up on each Side. At low Water she
lay almost dry, so we mended her Bottom, and
stopt the Leak which was occasioned by straining
some of the Rudder Irons with the Shock which
the Ship had against the Rock.</P>
<P>Having done this, we also took Occasion to
clean her Bottom, which, having been at Sea so
long, was very foul. The Sloop Wash'd and Tal∣low'd
also, but was ready before us, and cruised
eight or ten Days among the Islands, but met
with no Purchase; so that we began to be tired
of the Place, having little to divert us, but the
most furious Claps of Thunder that ever were
read or heard of in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="254"/>
We were in Hopes to have met with some Pur∣chase
here among the <HI>Chinese,</HI> who we had been
told came to <HI>Ternate</HI> to trade for Cloves, and to
the <HI>Banda</HI> Isles, for Nutmegs, and we could have
been very glad to have loaded our Galleon, or
great Ship, with these two Sorts of Spice, and
have thought it a glorious Voyage; but we found
nothing stirring more than what I have said, ex∣cept
<HI>Dutchmen,</HI> who by what Means we could not
imagine, had either a Jealousy of us, or Intelli∣gence
of us, and kept themselves close in their
Ports.</P>
<P>I was once resolved to have made a Descent at
the Island of <HI>Dumas,</HI> the Place most famous for
the best Nutmegs; but Friend <HI>William,</HI> who was
always for doing our Business without Fighting,
disswaded me from it, and gave such Reasons for
it, that we could not resist; particularly the great
Heats of the Season, and of the Place, for we
were now in the Latitude of just half a Degree
South; but while we were disputing this Point,
we were soon determined by the following Acci∣dent.
We had a strong Gale of Wind at S. W.
by W. and the Ship had fresh Way, but a great
Sea rolling in upon us from the N.E. which we
afterwards found was the Pouring in of the Great
Ocean East of <HI>New Guinea.</HI> However, as I said,
we stood away large, and made fresh Way, when
on the sudden, from a dark Cloud which hover'd
over our Heads, came a Flash, or rather Blast of
Lightning, which was so terrible, and quiver'd
so long among us, that not I only, but all our
Men thought the Ship was on Fire. The Heat
of the Flash or Fire was so sensibly selt in our Fa∣ces,
that some of our Men had Blisters raised by
<PB N="237" REF="255"/>
it on their Skins, not immediately perhaps by the
Heat, but by the poisonous or noxious Particles,
which mix'd themselves with the Matter in∣flam'd.
But this was not all; the Shock of the
Air which the Fracture in the Clouds made, was
such, that our Ship shook as when a Broadside is
fired, and her Motion being check'd as it were at
once by a Repulse superior to the Force that gave
her Way before, the Sails all flew back in a Mo∣ment,
and the Ship lay, as we might truly say,
Thunder-struck. As the Blast from the Cloud
was so very near us, it was but a few Moments
after the Flash, that the terriblest Clap of Thun∣der
followed that was ever heard by Mortals. I
firmly believe a Blast of a Hundred Thousand
Barrels of Gunpowder could not have been greater
to our Hearing; nay indeed, to some of our Men
it took away their Hearing.</P>
<P>It is not possible for me to describe, or any one
to conceive the Terrour of that Minute. Our
Men were in such a Consternation, that not a
Man on board the Ship had Presence of Mind to
apply to the proper Duty of a Sailor, except
Friend <HI>William;</HI> and had not he run very nimbly,
and with a Composure that I am sure I was not
Master of, to let go the Fore-sheet, set in the
Weather Brace of the Fore-yard, and haul'd
down the Topsails, we had certainly brought all
our Masts by the Board, and perhaps have been
overwhelm'd in the Sea.</P>
<P>As for my self, I must confess my Eyes were
open to my Danger, tho' not the least to any
thing of Application for Remedy. I was all
Amazement and Confusion, and this was the first
Time that I can say I began to feel the Effects of
<PB N="238" REF="256"/>
that Horrour which I know since much more of,
upon the just Reflection on my former Life. I
thought my self doom'd by Heaven to sink that
Moment into eternal Destruction; and with this
peculiar Mark of Terror, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ven∣geance
was not executed in the ordinary Way
of human Justice, but that God had taken me
into his immediate Disposing, and had resolved
to be the Executer of his own Vengeance.</P>
<P>Let them alone describe the Confusion I was in,
who know what was the Case of—<HI>Child</HI> of
<HI>Shadwell,</HI> or <HI>Francis Spira.</HI> It is impossible to de∣scribe.
My Soul was all Amazement and Sur∣prize;
I thought my self just sinking into Eter∣nity,
owning the divine Justice of my Punishment,
but not at all feeling any of the moving, soft∣ning
Tokens of a sincere Penitent, afflicted at the
Punishment, but not at the Crime, alarmed at
the Vengeance, but not terrify'd at the Guilt, ha∣ving
the same Gust to the Crime, tho' terrisied
to the last Degree at the Thought of the Pu∣nishment,
which I concluded I was just now
going to receive.</P>
<P>But perhaps many that read this will be sen∣sible
of the Thunder and Lightning, that may
think nothing of the rest, or rather may make
a Jest of it all, so I say no more of it at this
time, but proceed to the Story of the Voyage.
When the Amazement was over, and the Men
began to come to themselves, they fell a calling
for one another, every one for his Friend, or for
those he had most Respect for; and it was a singu∣lar
Satisfaction to find that no body was hurt.
The next thing was to enquire if the Ship had
received no Damage, when the Boatswain step∣ping
<PB N="239" REF="257"/>
forward, found that Part of the Head was
gone, but not so as as to endanger the Bolt∣sprit;
so we hoisted our Topsails again, haul'd
aft the Fore-sheet, brac'd the Yards, and went
went our Course as before: Nor can I deny but
that we were all somewhat like the Ship, our
first Astonishment being a little over, and that we
found the Ship swim again, we were soon the
same irreligious hardned Crew that we were be∣fore,
and I among the rest.</P>
<P>As we now steer'd, our Course lay N.N.E.
and we passed thus with a fair Wind, thro' the
Streight or Channel between the Island of <HI>Gilolo,</HI>
and the Land of <HI>Nova Guinea,</HI> when we were soon
in the open Sea or Ocean, on the South East of
the <HI>Philippines,</HI> being the great Pacifick, or South
Sea, where it may be said to join it self with the
vast <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>As we passed into these Seas steering due North,
so we soon cross'd the Line to the North Side,
and so sailed on towards <HI>Mindanoa</HI> and <HI>Manilla,</HI> the
chief of the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, without meeting
with any Purchase, till we came to the North∣ward
of <HI>Manilla,</HI> and then our Trade began; for
here we took three <HI>Japonese</HI> Vessels, tho' at some
Distance from <HI>Manilla.</HI> Two of them had made
their Market, and were going Home with Nut∣megs,
Cinnamon, Cloves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> besides all Sorts
of <HI>European</HI> Goods brought with the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships
from <HI>Acapulco.</HI> They had together eight and
thirty Ton of Cloves, and five or six Ton of
Nutmegs, and as much Cinnamon. We took
the Spice, but meddled with very little of the
<HI>European</HI> Goods, they being, as we thought, not
worth our while, but we were very sorry for it
<PB N="240" REF="258"/>
soon after, and therefore grew wiser upon the
next Occasion.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Japonese</HI> was the best Prize to us, for
he came with Money, and a great deal of Gold
uncoin'd, to buy such Goods as we mentioned
above: We eased him of his Gold, and did
him no other Harm, and having no Intention to
stay long here, we stood away for <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>We were at Sea above two Months upon this
Voyage, beating it up against the Wind, which
blew steadily from the North East, and within a
Point or two one Way or other; and this indeed
was the Reason why we met with the more Pri∣zes
in our Voyage.</P>
<P>We were just gotten clear of the <HI>Philippines,</HI> and
as we purposed to go the Isle of <HI>Formosa,</HI> when
the Wind blew so fresh at N. N. E. that there
was no making any thing of it, and we were
forced to put back to <HI>Laconia,</HI> the most Norther∣ly
of those Islands. We rode here very secure,
and shifted our Situation not in View of any Dan∣ger,
for there was none, but for a better Supply
of Provisions, which we found the People very
willing to supply us with.</P>
<P>There lay while we remained here, three ve∣ry
great Galleons or <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships, from the South
Seas, whether newly come in, or ready to sail, we
could not understand at first; but as we found
the <HI>China</HI> Traders began to load and set forward
to the North, we concluded the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ships had
newly unloaded their Cargo, and these had been
buying; so we doubted not but we should meet
with Purchase in the rest of our Voyage, neither
indeed could we well miss of it.</P>
<P>We stay'd here till the beginning of <HI>May,</HI>
when we were told the <HI>Chinese</HI> Traders would
<PB N="241" REF="259"/>
set forward, for the Northern Monsoons end
about the latter End of <HI>March,</HI> or the Beginning
of <HI>April;</HI> so that they are sure of fair Winds
Home. Accordingly we hired some of the Coun∣try
Boats, which are very swift Sailers, to go
and bring us Word how Affairs stood at <HI>Manil∣la,</HI>
and when the <HI>China</HI> Jonks would sail, and by
this Intelligence we ordered our Matters so well,
that three Days after we set Sail, we fell in with
no less than eleven of them, out of which how∣ever
having by Misfortune of discovering our
selves, taken but three, we contented our selves,
and pursued our Voyage to <HI>Formosa.</HI> In these
three Vessels we took in short such a Quantity of
Cloves, Nutmegs, Cinnamon, and Mace, besides
Silver, that our Men began to be of my Opinion,
<HI>That we were rich enough;</HI> and in short, we had
nothing to do now, but to consider by what Me∣thods
to secure the immense Treasure we had
got.</P>
<P>I was secretly glad to hear, that they were of
this Opinion; for I had long before resolved, if
it was possible, to perswade them to think of re∣turning,
having fully perfected my first projected
Design, of Rummaging among the Spice Islands,
and all those Prizes, which were exceeding rich
at <HI>Manilla,</HI> was quite beyond my Design.</P>
<P>But now I had heard what the Men said, and how
they thought we were very well. I let them know
by Friend <HI>William,</HI> that I intended only to sail to
the Island <HI>Formosa,</HI> where I should find Opportu∣nity
to turn our Spices and <HI>European</HI> Goods into
ready Money, and that then I would tack about
for the South, the Northern Monsoons being per∣haps
by that time also ready to set in. They all
approved of my Design, and willingly went for∣ward,
<PB N="242" REF="260"/>
because, besides the Winds, which would
not permit until <HI>October,</HI> to go to the South: I
say, besides this, we were now a very deep Ship,
having near two Hundred Ton of Goods on board,
and particularly some very valuable. The Sloop
also had a Proportion.</P>
<P>With this Resolution we went on chearfully,
when within about twelve Days Sail more, we
made the Island <HI>Formosa,</HI> at a great Distance, but
were our selves shot beyond the Southermost
Part of the Island, being to Leeward, and almost
upon the Coast of <HI>China.</HI> Here we were a little
at a Loss; for the <HI>English</HI> Factories were not far
off, and we might be obliged to fight some of
their Ships, if we met with them; which tho'
we were able enough to do, yet we did not
desire it on many Accounts; and particularly
because we did not think it was our Business to
have it known who we were, or that such a kind
of People as we had been seen on the Coast.
However, we were obliged to keep up to the
Northward, keeping as good an Offing as we could,
with respect to the Coast of <HI>China.</HI> We had not
sailed long, but we chased a small <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk;
and having taken her, we found she was bound
to the Island of <HI>Formosa,</HI> having no Goods on
board but some Rice, and a small Quantity of
Tea; but she had three <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants in her,
and they told us they were going to meet a
large Vessel of their Country, which came from
<HI>Tonquin,</HI> and lay in a River in <HI>Formosa</HI> whose Name
I forget, and they were going to the <HI>Philippine</HI>
Islands, with Silks, Muslins, Callicoes, and such
Goods as are the Product of <HI>China,</HI> and some Gold;
that their Business was to sell their Cargo, and
buy Spices and <HI>European</HI> Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="261"/>
This suited very well with our Purpose; so I
resolved now that we would leave off being Py∣rates,
and turn Merchants; so we told them
what Goods we had on board, and that if they
would bring their Super-Cargoes or Merchants
on board, we would trade with them. They
were very willing to trade with us, but terribly
afraid to trust us; nor was it an unjust Fear,
for we had plundered them already of what they
had. On the other Hand, we were as diffident
as they, and very uncertain what to do; but
<HI>William</HI> the Quaker put this Matter into a Way
of Barter. He came to me, and told me he re∣ally
thought the Merchants look'd like fair Men,
that meant honestly; and besides, says <HI>William,</HI>
it is their Interest to be honest now; for as they
know upon what Terms we got the Goods we
are to truck with them, so they know we can
afford good Pennyworths; and in the next Place,
it saves them going the whole Voyage: So that
the Southerly Monsoons yet holding, if they
traded with us, they could immediately return
with their Cargo to <HI>China, tho' by the Way we af∣terwards
found they intended for</HI> Japan. But that
was all one, for by this Means they sav'd at
least eight Months Voyage. Upon these Foun∣dations
<HI>William</HI> said he was satisfied we might
trust them: For, says <HI>William,</HI> I would as soon
trust a Man whose Interest binds him to be just
to me, as a Man whose Principle binds himself.
Upon the whole, <HI>William</HI> proposed that two of
the Merchants should be left on board our Ship
as Hostages, and that Part of our Goods should
be loaded in their Vessel, and let the third go
with it into the Port where their Ship lay; and
when he had delivered the Spices, he should
<PB N="244" REF="262"/>
bring back such things as it was agreed should be
exchanged. This was concluded on, and <HI>William</HI>
the Quaker ventured to go along with them, which
upon my Word I should not have cared to have
done, nor was I willing that he should; but he
went still upon the Notion, that it was their In∣terest
to treat him friendly.</P>
<P>In the mean time we came to an Anchor un∣der
a little Island, in the Latitude of 23 Degrees,
28 Minutes, being just under the Northern Tro∣pick,
and about twenty Leagues from the Island.
Here we lay thirteen Days, and I began to be ve∣ry
uneasy for my Friend <HI>William,</HI> for they had
promised to be back again in four Days, which
they might very easily have done. However, at
the End of thirteen Days we saw three Sail coming
directly to us, which a little surprized us all at
first, not knowing what might be the Case, and
we began to put our selves in a Posture of De∣fence;
but as they came nearer us, we were soon
satisfy'd: For the first Vessel was that which <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
went in, who carried a Flag of Truce,
and in a few Hours they all came to an Anchor,
and <HI>William</HI> came on board us with a little Boat,
with the <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchant in his Company, and
two other Merchants, which seem'd to be a kind
of Brokers for the rest.</P>
<P>Here he gave us an Account, how civilly he
had been used, how they had treated him with
all imaginable Frankness and Openness, that they
had not only given him the full Value of his
Spices and other Goods which he carry'd, in Gold,
by good Weight, but had loaded the Vessel again
with such Goods as he knew we were willing to
trade for; and that afterwards they had resolved
to bring the great Ship out of the Harbour, to
<PB N="245" REF="263"/>
lye where we were, that so we might make what
Bargain we thought fit; only <HI>William</HI> said he had
promised in our Name, that we should use no
Violence with them, nor detain any of the Ves∣sels
after we had done trading with them. I told
him, we would strive to outdo them in Civility,
and that we would make good every Part of his
Agreement. In Token whereof I caused a white
Flag likewise to be spread at the Poop of our
great Ship, which was the Signal agreed on.</P>
<P>As to the third Vessel which came with them,
it was a kind of Bark of the Country, who
having Intelligence of our Design to traffick,
came off to deal with us, bringing a great deal
of Gold, and some Provisions, which at that time
we were very glad of.</P>
<P>In short, we traded upon the high Seas with
these Men, and indeed we made a very good Mar∣ket,
and yet sold Thieves Pennyworths too. We
sold here above sixty Ton of Spice, chiefly Cloves
and Nutmegs, and above two Hundred Bales of
<HI>European</HI> Goods; such as Linnen and Wollen Ma∣nufactures.
We considered we should have Occa∣sion
for some such things our selves, and so we
kept a good Quantity of <HI>English</HI> Stuffs, Cloaths,
Bays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for our selves. I shall not take up
any of the little Room I have left here, with the
further Particulars of our Trade; 'tis enough to
mention, that except a Parcel of Tea, and twelve
Bales of fine <HI>China</HI> wrought Silks, we took nothing
in Exchange for our Goods but Gold: So that the
Sum we took here in that glittering Commodity,
amounted to above Fifty Thousand Ounces good
Weight.</P>
<P>When we had finished our Barter, we restored
the Hostages, and gave the three Merchants about
<PB N="246" REF="264"/>
the Quantity of Twelve Hundred Weight of
Nutmegs, and as many of Cloves, with a hand∣som
Present of <HI>European</HI> Linnen and Stuff for them∣selves,
as a Recompence for what we had taken
from them; and so we sent them away exceeding∣ly
well satisfy'd.</P>
<P>Here it was that <HI>William</HI> gave me an Account,
that while he was on board the <HI>Japonese</HI> Vessel, he
met with a kind of Religious, or <HI>Japan</HI> Priest,
who spoke some Words of <HI>English</HI> to him; and
being very inquisitive to know how he came to
learn any of those Words, he told him, that there
was in his Country <HI>thirteen Englishmen;</HI> he called
them <HI>Englishmen</HI> very articulately and distinctly,
for he had conversed with them very frequently
and freely: He said they were all that were left
of two and thirty Men, who came on Shore on the
North Side of <HI>Japan,</HI> being driven upon a great
Rock in a stormy Night, where they lost their
Ship, and the rest of their Men were drowned:
That he had perswaded the King of his Country
to send Boats off to the Rock or Island, where
the Ship was lost, to save the rest of the Men,
and to bring them on Shore; which was done,
and they were used very kindly; and had Houses
built for them, and Land given them to plant for
Provision, and that they lived by themselves.</P>
<P>He said he went frequently among them, to
perswade them to worship their God, an Idol, I
suppose, of their own making, which he said
they ungratefully refused; and that therefore the
King had once or twice ordered them to be all put
to Death; but that, <HI>as he said,</HI> he had prevailed
upon the King to spare them, and let them live
their own Way, as long as they were quiet and
<PB N="247" REF="265"/>
peaceable, and did not go about to withdraw
others from the Worship of the Country.</P>
<P>I ask'd <HI>William,</HI> why he did not enquire from
whence they came? I did, <HI>said William,</HI> for how
could I but think it strange, said he, to hear him
talk of <HI>English</HI> Men on the North Side of <HI>Japan.</HI>
Well, said I, what Account did he give of it?
An Account, said <HI>William,</HI> that will suprize thee,
and all the World after thee, that shall hear of it,
and which makes me wish thou wouldst go up to
<HI>Japan,</HI> and find them out. What do ye mean,
said I? Whence could they come? Why, says
<HI>William,</HI> he pull'd out a little Book, and in it a
Piece of Paper, where it was written in an <HI>English</HI>
Man's Hand, and in plain <HI>English</HI> Words, thus;
and says <HI>William,</HI> I read it my self: <HI>We came from
Greenland,</HI> and from the <HI>North Pole.</HI> This indeed
was amazing to us all, and more to those Sea∣men
among us who knew any thing of the in∣finite
Attempts which had been made from <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI>
as well by the <HI>English</HI> as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to disco∣ver
a Passage that Way into those Parts of the
World; and as <HI>William</HI> press'd us earnestly to go
on to the North, to rescue those poor Men, so
the Ship's Company began to incline to it; and
in a Word, we all came to this, that we would
stand in to the Shore of <HI>Formosa,</HI> to find this
Priest again, and have a farther Account of it
all from him. Accordingly the Sloop went over,
but when they came there, the Vessels were very
unhappily sail'd, and this put an End to our En∣quiry
after them, and perhaps may have disap∣pointed
Mankind of one of the most noble Dis∣coveries
that ever was made, or will again be made
in the World, for the Good of Mankind in gene∣ral:
But so much for that.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="266"/>
<HI>William</HI> was so uneasy at losing this Oppor∣tunity,
that he press'd us earnestly to go up to
<HI>Japan,</HI> to find out these Men. He told us, that
if it was nothing but to recover Thirteen ho∣nest
poor Men from a kind of Captivity, which
they would otherwise never be redeemed from,
and where perhaps they might some time or other
be murdered by the barbarous People, in Defence
of their Idolatry; it were very well worth our
while, and it would be in some Measure making
amends for the Mischiefs we had done in the
World: But we that had no Concern upon us
for the Mischiefs we had done, had much less
about any Satisfaction to be made for it; so he
found that kind of Discourse would weigh very
little with us. Then he press'd us very earnest∣ly
to let him have the Sloop to go by himself,
and I told him I would not oppose it; but when
he came to the Sloop, none of the Men would
go with him; for the Case was plain, they had
all a Share in the Cargo of the great Ship, as
well as in that of the Sloop, and the Richness
of the Cargo was such, that they would not leave
it by any means: So poor <HI>William,</HI> much to his
Mortification, was obliged to give it over. What
became of those thirteen Men, or whether they
are not there still, I can give no Account of.</P>
<P>We were now at the End of our Cruise; what
we had taken was indeed so considerable, that it
was not only enough to satisfy the most covetous
and the most ambitious Minds in the World, but
it did indeed satisfy us; and our Men declared
they did not desire any more. The next Motion
therefore was about going back, and the Way by
which we should perform the Voyage, so as not
to be attack'd by the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the Straits of <HI>Sundy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="267"/>
We had pretty well stored our selves here with
Provisions, and it being now near the Return
of the Monsoons, we resolved to stand away to
the Southward; and not only to keep without
the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, that is to say, to the East∣ward
of them, but to keep on to the Southward,
and see if we could not leave, not only the <HI>Mo∣lucco's,</HI>
or Spice Islands, behind us, but even <HI>Nova
Guinea</HI> and <HI>Nova Hollandia</HI> also; and so getting
into the variable Winds, to the South of the
Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> steer away to the West,
over the great <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>This was indeed at first a monstrous Voyage
in its Appearance, and the Want of Provisions
threaten'd us. <HI>William</HI> told us in so many Words,
that it was impossible we could carry Provisions
enough to subsist us for such a Voyage, and espe∣cially
fresh Water; and that as there would be
no Land for us to touch at, where we could get
any Supply, it was a Madness to undertake it.</P>
<P>But I undertook to remedy this Evil, and
therefore desired them not to be uneasy at that,
for I knew we might supply our selves at <HI>Min∣danao,</HI>
the most Southerly Island of the <HI>Philip∣pines.</HI>
Accordingly, we set Sail, having taken
all the Provisions here that we could get, the
28th of <HI>September,</HI> the Wind veering a little at
first from the N. N. W. to the N. E. by E. but
afterwards settled about the N. E. and the E. N. E.
We were nine Weeks in this Voyage, having met
with several Interruptions by the Weather, and
put in under the Lee of a small Island in the La∣titude
of 16 Degrees, 12 Minutes, of which we
never knew the Name, none of our Charts ha∣ving
given any Account of it: I say, we put in
here, by reason of a strange <HI>Tornado</HI> or Hurricane,
<PB N="250" REF="268"/>
which brought us into a great deal of Danger.
Here we rode about sixteen Days, the Winds
being very tempestuous, and the Weather un∣certain.
However, we got some Provisions on
Shore, such as Plants and Roots, and a few Hoggs.
We believed there were Inhabitants on the Island,
but we saw none of them.</P>
<P>From hence, the Weather settling again, we
went on, and came to the Southmost Part of <HI>Min∣danao,</HI>
where we took in fresh Water, and some
Cows; but the Climate was so hot, that we did
not attempt to salt up any more, than so as to
keep a Fortnight or three Weeks, and away
we stood South ward crossing the Line, and
leaving <HI>Gillolo</HI> on the Starboard Side, we coasted
the Country they call <HI>New Guiney,</HI> where, in the
Latitude of eight Degrees South, we put in again
for Provisions and Water, and where we found
Inhabitants, but they fled from us, and were alto∣gether
inconversable. From thence, sailing still
Southward, we left all behind us that any of
our Charts or Maps take any Notice of, and went
on till we came to the Latitude of 17 Degrees,
the Wind continuing still N. E.</P>
<P>Here we made Land to the Westward, which
when we had kept in Sight for three Days, coast∣ing
along the Shore, for the Distance of about
four Leagues, we began to fear we should find
no Outlet West, and so should be obliged to go
back again, and put in among the <HI>Molucco's</HI> at
last; but at length we found the Land break
off, and go trending away to the West Sea, seem∣ing
to be all open to the South and S. W. and
a great Sea came rowling out of the South, which
gave us to understand, that there was no Land
that Way for a great Way.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="269"/>
In a Word, we kept on our Course to the South,
a little Westerly, till we pass'd the South Tro∣pick,
where we found the Winds variable; and
now we stood away fair West, and held it out
for about twenty Days, when we discovered Land
right a-head, and on our Larboard Bow, we made
directly to the Shore, being willing to take all Ad∣vantages
now for supplying our selves with fresh
Provisions and Water, knowing we were now en∣tring
on that vast unknown <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, per∣haps
the greatest Sea on the Globe, having with
very little Interruption of Islands, a continued
Sea quite round the Globe.</P>
<P>We found a good Road here, and some Peo∣ple
on Shore; but when we landed, they fled
up the Country, nor would they hold any Cor∣respondence
with us, or come near us, but shot
at us several Times with Arrows as long as Laun∣ces.
We set up white Flags for a Truce, but
they either did not, or would not, understand it:
On the contrary, they shot our Flag of Truce
thro' several times with their Arrows; so that, in
a Word, we never came near any of them.</P>
<P>We found good Water here, tho' it was some∣thing
difficult to get at it, but for living Crea∣tures
we could see none; for the People, if they
had any Cattle, drove them all away, and shew'd
us nothing but themselves, and that sometimes
in a threatning Posture, and in Number so great,
that made us suppose the Island to be greater than
we at first imagined. It is true, they would not
come near enough for us to engage with them,
at least, not openly; but they came near enough
for us to see them, and by the Help of our
Glasses, to see that they were clothed and arm'd,
but their Clothes were only about their lower
<PB N="252" REF="270"/>
and middle Parts; that they had long Launces,
like Half Pikes, in their Hands, besides Bows and
Arrows; that they had great high Things on
their Heads, made, as we believed, of Feathers,
and which look'd something like our Grenadi∣ers
Caps in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>When we saw them so shye, that they would
not come near us, our Men began to range over
the Island, <HI>if it was such, for we never surrounded
it,</HI> to search for Cattel, and for any of the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
Plantations, for Fruits or Plants; but they
soon found, to their Cost, that they were to use
more Caution than that came to, and that they
were to discover perfectly every Bush and every
Tree, before they ventured abroad in the Coun∣try;
for, about fourteen of our Men going fur∣ther
than the rest, into a Part of the Country
which seemed to be planted, as they thought,
for it did but seem so, only I think it was over∣grown
with Canes, such as we make our Cane
Chairs with: I say, venturing too far, they were
suddenly attack'd with a Shower of Arrows from
almost every Side of them, as they thought,
out of the Tops of the Trees.</P>
<P>They had nothing to do, but to fly for it,
which however they could not resolve on, till
five of them were wounded; nor had they esca∣ped
so, if one of them had not been so much
wiser, or thoughtfuller than the rest, as to con∣sider,
that tho' they could not see the Enemy,
so as to shoot at them, yet perhaps the Noise
of their Shot might terrify them, and that they
should rather fire at a Venture. Accordingly
Ten of them faced about, and fired at random
any where among the Canes.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="271"/>
The Noise and the Fire not only terrify'd
the Enemy, but, as they believed, their Shot had
luckily hit some of them; for they found not on∣ly
that the Arrows which came thick among
them before, ceased, but they heard the <HI>Indians</HI>
halloo, after their Way, to one another, and make
a strange Noise more uncouth and inimi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably
strange, than any they had ever heard, more like
the Howling and Barking of wild Creatures in
the Woods, than like the Voice of Men, only
that sometimes they seemed to speak Words.</P>
<P>They observ'd also, that this Noise of the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
went farther and farther off, so that they were
satisfied the <HI>Indians</HI> fled away, except on one Side,
where they heard a doleful Groaning and Howl∣ing,
and where it continued a good while, which
they supposed was from some or other of them
being wounded, and howling by reason of their
Wounds; or kill'd, and others howling over
them: But our Men had enough of making Dis∣coveries;
so they did not trouble themselves to
look farther, but resolved to take this Opportuni∣ty
to retreat. But the worst of their Adventure
was to come; for as they came back, they pass'd
by a prodigious great Trunk of an old Tree,
what Tree it was they said they did not know, but
it stood like an old decay'd Oak in a Park, where
the Keepers in <HI>England</HI> take <HI>a Stand,</HI> as they call
it, to shoot a Deer, and it stood just under the
steep Side of a great Rock or Hill, that our Peo∣ple
could not see what was beyond it.</P>
<P>As they came by this Tree, they were of a sud∣den
shot at from the Top of the Tree, with seven
Arrows and three Launces, which, to our great
Grief, kill'd two of our Men, and wounded three
more. This was the more surprizing, because
<PB N="254" REF="272"/>
being without any Defence, and so near the Trees,
they expected more Launces and Arrows every
Moment; nor would flying do them any Service,
the <HI>Indians</HI> being, as appeared, very good Marks∣men.
In this Extremity they had happily this
Presence of Mind, <HI>viz.</HI> to run close to the Tree,
and stand, as it were under it; so that those
above could not come at, or see them, to throw
their Launces at them. This succeeded, and gave
them Time to consider what to do: They knew
their Enemies and Murtherers were above, for
they heard them talk, and those above knew
those were below; but they below were obli∣ged
to keep close for fear of their Launces from
above. At length, one of our Men looking a
little more strictly than the rest, thought he
saw the Head of one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> just over a
dead Limb of the Tree, which, it seems, the
Creature sat upon. One Man immediately fired,
and levell'd his Piece so true, that the Shot went
thro' the Fellow's Head, and down he fell out of
the Tree immediately, and came upon the Ground
with such Force, with the Height of his Fall,
that if he had not been killed with the Shot,
he would certainly have been killed with dashing
his Body against the Ground.</P>
<P>This so frighted themselves, that besides the
howling Noise they made in the Tree, our Men
heard a strange Clutter of them in the Body of
the Tree, from whence they concluded they had
made the Tree hollow, and were got to hide
themselves there. Now, had this been the Case,
they were secure enough from our Men; for it
was impossible any of our Men could get up the
Tree on the Out-side, there being no Branches
to climb by; and, to shoot at the Tree, that
<PB N="255" REF="273"/>
they tried several times to no Purpose, for the
Tree was so thick, that no Shot would enter
it. They made no Doubt however, but that they
had their Enemies in a Trap, and that a small
Siege would either bring them down Tree and all,
or starve them out: So they resolved to keep
their Post, and send to us for Help. According∣ly
two of them came away to us for more Hands,
and particularly desired, that some of our Car∣penters
might come with Tools, to help cut down
the Tree, or at least to cut down other Wood,
and set Fire to it; and That they concluded
would not fail to bring them out.</P>
<P>Accordingly our Men went like a little Ar∣my,
and with mighty Preparations for an En∣terprize,
the like of which has scarce been ever
heard, to form the Siege of a great Tree. How∣ever,
when they came there, they found the
Task difficult enough, for the old Trunk was in∣deed
a very great one, and very tall, being at
least Two and Twenty Foot high, with seven old
Limbs standing out every Way on the Top, but
decay'd, and very few Leaves, if any, left on it.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> the Quaker, whose Curiosity led him
to go among the rest, proposed, that they should
make a Ladder, and get up upon the Top, and
then throw Wild-fire into the Tree, and smoke
them out. Others proposed going back, and
getting a great Gun out of the Ship, which
should split the Tree in Pieces with the Iron
Bullets: Others, that they should cut down a
great deal of Wood, and pile it up round the
Tree, and set it on Fire, and to burn the Tree,
and the <HI>Indians</HI> in it.</P>
<P>These Consultations took up our People no
less than two or three Days, in all which Time
<PB N="256" REF="274"/>
they heard nothing of the supposed Garrison
within this wooden Castle, nor any Noise with∣in.
<HI>William</HI>'s Project was first gone about, and
a large strong Ladder was made, to scale this
wooden Tower; and in two or three Hours time,
it would have been ready to mount: When, on
a sudden, they heard the Noise of the <HI>Indians</HI> in
the Body of the Tree again, and a little after, se∣veral
of them appeared in the Top of the Tree,
and threw some Launces down at our Men; one
of which struck one of our Seamen a-top of the
Shoulder, and gave him such a desperate Wound,
that the Surgeons not only had a great deal of
Difficulty to cure him, but the poor Man endu∣red
such horrible Tortures, that we all said they
had better have killed him outright. However,
he was cured at last, tho' he never recover'd the
perfect Use of his Arm, the Launce having cut
some of the Tendons on the Top of the Arm,
near the Shoulder, which, as I suppose, perfor∣med
the Office of Motion to the Limb before;
so that the poor Man was a Criple all the Days of
his Life. But to return to the desperate Rogues
in the Tree; our Men shot at them, but did not
find they had hit them, or any of them; but as
soon as ever they shot at them, they could hear
them huddle down into the Trunk of the Tree
again, and there to be sure they were safe.</P>
<P>Well, however, it was this which put by the
Project of <HI>William</HI>'s Ladder; for when it was done,
who would venture up among such a Troop of
bold Creatures as were there? And who, they
supposed, were desperate by their Circumstances:
And as but one Man at a time could go up, they
began to think that it would not do; and in∣deed
I was of the Opinion, <HI>for about this time I
<PB N="257" REF="275"/>
was come to their Assistance,</HI> that the going up the
Ladder would not do, unless it was thus, that
a Man should, as it were run just up to the Top,
and throw some Fire-works into the Tree, and
so come down again; and this we did two or
three Times, but found no Effect of it. At last,
one of our Gunners made a Stink-pot, as we cal∣led
it, being a Composition which only smokes,
but does not flame or burn; but withal the
Smoke of it is so thick, and the Smell of it so
intolerably nauseous, that it is not to be suffe∣red.
This he threw into the Tree himself, and
we waited for the Effect of it, but heard or saw
nothing all that Night, or the next Day; so we
concluded the Men within were all smother'd:
When, on a sudden, the next Night, we heard
them upon the Top of the Tree again, shouting
and hallooing like Madmen.</P>
<P>We concluded, as any body would, that this
was to call for Help, and we resolved to conti∣nue
our Siege; for we were all enraged to see
our selves so baulk'd by a few wild People whom
we thought we had safe in our Clutches; and
indeed never was there so many concurring Cir∣cumstances
to delude Men, in any Case we had
met with. We resolved however to try another
Stink-pot the next Night, and our Engineer and
Gunner had got it ready, when hearing a Noise
of the Enemy, on the Top of the Tree, and in
the Body of the Tree, I was not willing to let
the Gunner go up the Ladder, which, I said,
would be but to be certain of being murthered.
However, he found a <HI>Medium</HI> for it, and that was
to go up a few Steps, and with a long Pole in
his Hand, to throw it in upon the Top of the
Tree, the Ladder being standing all this while
<PB N="258" REF="276"/>
against the Top of the Tree; but when the Gun∣ner,
with his Machine at the Top of his Pole,
came to the Tree with three other Men to help
him, behold the Ladder was gone.</P>
<P>This perfectly confounded us, and we now con∣cluded
the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Tree had by this Piece
of Negligence taken the Opportunity, and come
all down the Ladder, made their Escape, and had
carried away the Ladder with them. I laugh'd
most heartily at my Friend <HI>William,</HI> who, as I
said, had the Direction of the Siege, and had set
up a Ladder, for the Garrison, <HI>as we called them,</HI>
to get down upon, and run away. But when
Day-Light came, we were all set to rights again;
for there stood our Ladder haul'd up on the Top
of the Tree, with about Half of it in the Hol∣low
of the Tree, and the other Half upright in
the Air. Then we began to laugh at the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI>
for Fools, that they could not as well have
found their Way down by the Ladder, and have
made their Escape, as to have pull'd it up by main
Strength into the Tree.</P>
<P>We then resolved upon Fire, and so to put an
End to the Work at once, and burn the Tree
and its Inhabitants together; and accordingly
we went to Work to cut Wood, and in a few
Hours time we got enough, as we thought,
together; and piling it up round the Bottom
of the Tree, we set it on Fire: So waiting at a
Distance, to see when the Gentlemens Quarters
being too hot for them, they would come flying
out at the Top. But we were quite confounded,
when, on a sudden, we found the Fire all put
out by a great Quantity of Water thrown upon
it. We then thought the Devil must be in them
to be sure. Says <HI>William,</HI> this is certainly the
<PB N="259" REF="277"/>
cunningest Piece of <HI>Indian</HI> Engineering that ever
was heard of, and there can be but one thing more
to guess at, besides Witchcraft and Dealing with
the Devil, <HI>which I believe not one Word of, says he;</HI>
and that must be, that this is an artificial Tree,
or a natural Tree artificially made hollow down
into the Earth, thro' Root and all; and that these
Creatures have an artificial Cavity underneath it,
quite into the Hill, or a Way to go thro', and
under the Hill, to some other Place, and where
that other Place is, we know not; but if it be
not our own Fault, I'll find the Place, and fol∣low
them into it, before I am two Days older.
He then called the Carpenters to know of them,
if they had any large Saws that would cut thro'
the Body, and they told him they had not any
Saws that were long enough, nor could Men
work into such a monstrous old Stump in a great
while; but that they would go to Work with
it with their Axes, and undertake to cut it down
in two Days, and stock up the Root of it in two
more. But <HI>William</HI> was for another Way, which
proved much better than all this; for he was
for silent Work, that, if possible, he might catch
some of the Fellows in it; so he sets twelve
Men to it with large Augurs, to bore great Holes
into the Side of the Tree, to go almost thro', but
not quite thro'; which Holes were bored with∣out
Noise, and when they were done, he filled
them all with Gun-Powder, stopping strong Plugs
bolted cross-ways into the Holes, and then boring
a slanting Hole of a less Size down into the greater
Hole, all which were fill'd with Powder, and at
once blown up. When they took Fire, they
made such a Noise, and tore and split the Tree
in so many Places, and in such a Manner, that
<PB N="260" REF="278"/>
we could see plainly, such another Blast would
demolish it, and so it did. Thus at the second
time we could at two or three Places put our
Hands into them, and discovered the Cheat,
namely, that there was a Cave or Hole dug in∣to
the Earth, from, or thro' the Bottom of the
Hollow, and that it had Communication with
another Cave further in, where we heard the
Voices of several of the wild Folks calling and
talking to one another.</P>
<P>When we came thus far we had a great Mind
to get at them, and <HI>William</HI> desired, that three
Men might be given him with Hand-Grenadoes,
and he promised to go down first, and boldly he
did so; for <HI>William,</HI> give him his due, had the
Heart of a Lion.</P>
<P>They had Pistols in their Hands, and Swords
by their Sides; but, as they had taught the <HI>In∣dians</HI>
before, by their Stink-Pots, the <HI>Indians</HI> re∣turned
them in their own Kind, for they made
such a Smoke come up out of the Entrance into
the Cave or Hollow, that <HI>William</HI> and his three Men,
were glad to come running out of the Cave, and
out of the Tree too, for mere want of Breath,
and indeed they were almost stifled.</P>
<P>Never was a Fortification so well defended, or
Assailants so many ways defeated; we were
now for giving it over, and particularly I called
<HI>William,</HI> and told him, I could not but laugh to
see us spinning out our Time here for nothing;
that I could not imagine what we were doing,
that it was certain the Rogues that were in it
were cunning to the last Degree, and it would
vex any Body to be so baulked by a few naked
ignorant Fellows; but still it was not worth our
while to push it any further, nor was there any
<PB N="261" REF="279"/>
thing that I knew of to be got by the Conquest
when it was made, so that I thought it high time
to give it over.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> acknowledged, that what I said was
just, and that there was nothing but our Curio∣sity
to be gratified in this Attempt; and tho',
as <HI>he said,</HI> he was very desirous to have
searched into the Thing, yet he would not insist
upon it, so we resolved to quit it, and come
away, which we did. However, <HI>William</HI> said,
before we went, he would have this Satisfaction
of them, <HI>viz.</HI> that he burnt down the Tree and
stopt up the Entrance into the Cave. While he
was doing this, the Gunner told him, he would
have one Satisfaction of the Rogues, and this
was, that he would make a Mine of it, and see
which way it had Vent: Upon this he fetches
two Barrels of Powder out of the Ships, and
placed them in the Inside of the hollow Cave, as
far in as he durst go to carry them, and then
filling up the Mouth of the Cave where the Tree
stood, and ramming it sufficiently hard, leaving
only a Pipe or Touch-hole, he gave Fire to it,
and stood at a Distance to see which way it
would operate, when, on the sudden, he found
the Force of the Powder burst its way out among
some Bushes on the other Side the little Hill I
mentioned, and that it came roaring out there
as out of the Mouth of a Cannon; immediate∣ly
running thither we saw the Effects of the
Powder.</P>
<P>First, We saw that <HI>there</HI> was the other Mouth
of the Cave, which the Powder had so torn and
open'd, that the loose Earth was so fallen in
again, that nothing of Shape could be discerned;
but there we saw what was become of the Garri∣son
<PB N="262" REF="280"/>
of <HI>Indians</HI> too, who had given us all this
Trouble; for some of them had no Arms, some
no Legs, some no Head, some lay half buried
in the Rubbish of the Mine, that is to say, in
the loose Earth that fell in; and, in short,
there was a miserable Havock made of them
all, for we had good Reason to believe, not one
of them that were in the Inside could escape,
but rather were shot out of the Mouth of the
Cave like a Bullet out of a Gun.</P>
<P>We had now our full Satisfaction of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI>
but, in short, this was a losing Voyage, for
we had two Men killed, one quite crippled,
five more wounded; we spent two Barrels of
Powder, and eleven Days Time, and all to get
the Understanding how to make an <HI>Indian</HI> Mine,
or how to keep Garrison in a hollow Tree, and
with this Wit bought at this dear Price, we
came away, having taken in some fresh Water,
but got no fresh Provisions.</P>
<P>We then considered what we should do to get
back again to <HI>Madagascar;</HI> we were much about
the Latitude of the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> but had
such a very long Run, and were neither sure
of meeting with fair Winds, or with any
Land in the Way, that we knee not what to
think of it. <HI>William</HI> was our last Resort in this
Case again, and he was very plain with us.
Friend, <HI>said he,</HI> to <HI>CAPT. WILMOT,</HI> what Oc∣casion
hast thou to run the Venture of starving,
merely for the Pleasure of saying, thou hast
been where no Body ever was before; there are
a great many Places nearer home, of which thou
mayest say the same thing, at a less Expence; I
see no Occasion thou hast of keeping thus far
South, any longer than till you are sure you are
<PB N="263" REF="281"/>
to the West End of <HI>Iava</HI> and <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and then
thou may'st stand away North towards <HI>Ceylon,</HI>
and the Coast of <HI>Coromandel</HI> and <HI>Maderas,</HI> where
thou may'st get both fresh Water, and fresh
Provisions, and to that Part it's likely we may
hold out well enough with the Stores that we have
already.</P>
<P>This was wholesome Advice, and such as was
not to be slighted, so we stood away to the West,
keeping between the Latitude of 31, and 35, and
had very good Weather and fair Winds for about
ten Days Sail, by which Time, by our Reckoning,
we were clear of the Isles, and might run away
to the North; and, if we did not fall in with
<HI>Ceylon,</HI> we should at least go into the great deep
Bay of <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P>But we were out in our Reckoning a great
deal, for when we had stood due North for
about fifteen or sixteen Degrees, we met with
Land again on our Star-board Bow, about three
Leagues Distance, so we came to an Anchor
about half a League from it, and Manned out
our Boats to see what sort of a Country it was:
We found it a very good one, fresh Water easy
to come at, but no Cattle, that we could see, or
Inhabitants, and we were very shye of searching
too far after them, lest we should make such
another Journey as we did last; so that we let
rambling alone, and chose rather to take what
we could find, which was only a few wild Man∣goes,
and some Plants of several Kinds, which
we knew not the Names of.</P>
<P>We made no Stay here, but put to Sea again,
N. W. by N. but had little Wind for a Fortnight
more, when we made Land again, and standing
in with the Shore, we were surprized to find
<PB N="264" REF="282"/>
our selves on the South Shore of <HI>Iava;</HI> and just
as we were coming to an Anchor, we saw a Boat
carrying <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours, sailing along Shore. We
were not sollicitous to speak with them, or any
other of their Nation, but left it indifferent to
our People, when they went on Shore, to see
the <HI>Dutchmen,</HI> or not to see them; our Business
was to get Provisions, which indeed by this time
were very short with us.</P>
<P>We resolved to go on Shore with our Boats in
the most convenient Place we could find, and to
look out a proper Harbour to bring the Ship
into, leaving it to our Fate, whether we should
meet with Friends or Enemies, resolving howe∣ver,
not to stay any considerable Time, at least,
not long enough to have Expresses sent cross the
Island to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and for Ships to come round
from thence to attack us.</P>
<P>We found, according to our Desire, a very
good Harbour, where we rode in seven Fathom
Water, well defended from the Weather, what∣ever
might happen, and here we got fresh Pro∣visions,
such as good Hogs, and some Cows; and
that we might lay in a little Store, we kill'd
sixteen Cows, and pickled and barrelled up the
Flesh as well as we could be supposed to do in the
Latitude of eight Degrees from the Line.</P>
<P>We did all this in about five Days, and filled
our Casks with Water, and the last Boat was
coming off with Herbs and Roots, we being un∣moor'd,
and our Fore Top-Sail loose for sailing,
when we spy'd a large Ship to the Northward,
bearing down directly upon us; we knew not what
she might be, but concluded the worst, and made
all possible Haste to get our Anchor up, and get
under Sail, that we might be in a Readiness to
<PB N="265" REF="283"/>
see what she had to say to us, for we were un∣der
no great Concern for one Ship; but our No∣tion
was, that we should be attack'd by three or
four together.</P>
<P>By the time we had got up our Anchor, and
the Boat was stow'd, the Ship was within a League
of us, and, as we thought, bore down to engage
us; so we spread our black Flag or Ancient on
the Poop, and the bloody Flag at the Top-mast
Head, and having made a clear Ship, we stretcht
away to the Westward, to get the Wind of him.</P>
<P>They had, it seems, quite mistaken us before,
expecting nothing of an Enemy or a Pyrate in
those Seas, and not doubting but we had been
one of their own Ships, they seem'd to be in
some Confusion when they found their Mistake; so
they immediately haul'd up on a-Wind on t'other
Tack, and stood edging in for the Shore, towards
the Eastermost Part of the Island. Upon this we
tack'd, and stood, after him with all the Sail we
could, and in two Hours came almost within Gun
Shot. Tho' they crowded all the Sail they could
lay on, there was no Remedy but to engage us,
and they soon saw their Inequality of Force.
We fired a Gun for them to bring to, so they
Mann'd out their Boat, and sent to us with a
Flag of Truce. We sent back the Boat, but
with this Answer to the Captain, that he had
nothing to do, but to strike, and bring his Ship
to an Anchor under our Stern, and come on board
us himself, when he should know our Demands;
but that however, since he had not yet put us
to the Trouble of forcing him, which we saw we
were able to do, we assured them, that the Cap∣tain
should return again in Safety, and all his
Men; and that supplying us with such things as
<PB N="266" REF="284"/>
we should demand, his Ship should not be plun∣dered.
They went back with this Message, and
it was some time after they were on board, be∣fore
they struck, which made us begin to think
they refused it; so we fired a Shot, and in a few
Minutes more we perceived their Boat put off;
and as soon as the Boat put off, the Ship struck,
and came to an Anchor, as was directed.</P>
<P>When the Captain came on board, we deman∣ded
an Account of their Cargo, which was chief∣ly
Bales of Goods from <HI>Bengal</HI> for <HI>Bantam.</HI> We
told them our present Want was Provisions,
which they had no need of, being just at the
End of their Voyage; and that if they would
send their Boat on Shore with ours, and pro∣cure
us six and twenty Head of black Cattel,
threescore Hogs, a Quantity of Brandy and Ar∣rack,
and three Hundred Bushels of Rice, we
would let them go free.</P>
<P>As to the Rice, they gave us six Hundred
Bushels, which they had actually on board, to∣gether
with a Parcel Shipt upon Freight. Also
they gave us thirty middling Casks of very good
Arrack, but Beef and Pork they had none. How∣ever,
they went on Shore with our Men, and
bought eleven Bullocks and fifty Hogs, which
were pickled up for our Occasion, and upon the
Supplies of Provision from Shore, we dismiss'd
them and their Ship.</P>
<P>We lay here seven Days before we could fur∣nish
our selves with the Provisions agreed for,
and some of the Men fancied the <HI>Dutchmen</HI> were
contriving our Destruction; but they were very
honest, and did what they could to furnish the
Black Cattel, but found it impossible to supply
so many. So they came and told us ingenuously,
<PB N="267" REF="285"/>
that unless we could stay a while longer, they
could get no more Oxen or Cows than those
Eleven, with which we were obliged to be satis∣fied,
taking the Value of them in other things,
rather than stay longer there. On our Side we
were punctual with them in observing the Condi∣tions
we had agreed on, nor would we let any
of our Men so much as go on board them, or
suffer any of their Men to come on board us;
for had any of our Men gone on board, no body
could have answer'd for their Behaviour, any
more than if they had been on Shore in an
Enemy's Country.</P>
<P>We were now Victualled for our Voyage, and
as we matter'd not Purchase, we went merrily
on for the Coast of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> where we intended
to touch to get fresh Water again, and more
Provisions; and we had nothing material offer'd
in this Part of the Voyage, only that we met
with contrary Winds, and were above a Month
in the Passage.</P>
<P>We put in upon the South Coast of the Island,
desiring to have as little to do with the <HI>Dutch</HI>
as we could; and as the <HI>Dutch</HI> were Lords of
the Country as to Commerce, so they are more
so of the Sea Coast, where they have several
Forts, and in particular, have all the Cinnamon,
which is the Trade of that Island.</P>
<P>We took in fresh Water here, and some Pro∣visions,
but did not much trouble our selves
about laying in any Stores, our Beef and Hogs
which we got at <HI>Iava</HI> being not yet all gone by
a good deal. We had a little Skirmish on Shore
here with some of the People of the Island, some
of our Men having been a little too familiar with
the <HI>Homely Ladies</HI> of the Country; for Homely
<PB N="268" REF="286"/>
indeed they were, to such a Degree, that if our
Men had not had good Stomachs that Way, they
would scarce have touch'd any of them.</P>
<P>I could never fully get it out of our Men what
they did, they were so true to one another in
their Wickedness; but I understood in the main,
that it was some barbarous thing they had done,
and that they had like to have paid dear for
it; for the Men resented it to the last Degree,
and gathered in such Numbers about them, that
had not sixteen more of our Men, in another
Boat, come all in the Nick of Time, just to re∣scue
our first Men, who were but Eleven, and
so fetch them off by main Force, they had been
all cut off, the Inhabitants being no less than two
or three Hundred, armed with Darts and Laun∣ces,
the usual Weapons of the Country, and
which they are very dexterous at the throwing,
even so dexterous, that it was scarce credible:
And had our Men stood to fight them, as some
of them were bold enough to talk of, they had
been all overwhelmed and kill'd. As it was,
seventeen of our Men were wounded, and some
of them very dangerously. But they were more
frighted than hurt too; for every one of them
gave themselves over for dead Men, believing
the Launces were poisoned. But <HI>William</HI> was our
Comfort here too; for when two of our Surge∣ons
were of the same Opinion, and told the Men
foolishly enough, that they would die, <HI>William</HI>
chearfully went to Work with them, and cured
them all but one, who rather died by drinking
some Arrack Punch, than of his Wound, the
Excess of Drinking throwing him into a Fever.</P>
<P>We had enough of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> tho' some of our
People were for going ashore again, sixty or
<PB N="269" REF="287"/>
seventy Men together, to be revenged; but
<HI>William</HI> perswaded them against it, and his Re∣putation
was so great among the Men, as well as
with us that were Commanders, that he could
influence them more than any of us.</P>
<P>They were mighty warm upon their Revenge,
and they would go on Shore, and destroy five
Hundred of them. Well, says <HI>William,</HI> and sup∣pose
you do, what are you the better? Why
then, says one of them, speaking for the rest,
we shall have our Satisfaction. Well, and what
will you be the better for that, says <HI>William?</HI>
They could then say nothing to that. Then,
says <HI>William,</HI> if I mistake not, your Business is
Money: Now I desire to know, if you conquer
and kill two or three Thousand of these poor
Creatures, they have no Money, pray what will
you get? They are poor naked Wretches, what
shall you gain by them? But then said <HI>William,</HI>
perhaps, in doing this, you may chance to lose
Half a Score of your own Company, as 'tis
very probable you may, pray, what Gain is in
it, and what Account can you give the Captain
for his lost Men? In short, <HI>William</HI> argued so
effectually, that he convinc'd them that it was
mere Murther, to do so; and that the Men had a
Right to their own, and that they had no Right
to take them away: That it was destroying
innocent Men, who had acted no otherwise than
as the Laws of Nature dictated; and that it
would be as much Murther to do so, as to meet
a Man on the High-way, and kill him, for the
mere sake of it, in cold Blood, not regarding whe∣ther
he had done any Wrong to us or no.</P>
<P>These Reasons prevailed with them at last, and
they were content to go away, and leave them
<PB N="270" REF="288"/>
as they found them. In the first Skirmish they
killed between sixty and seventy Men, and
wounded a great many more, but they had no∣thing,
and our People got nothing by it, but the
Loss of one Man's Life, and the Wounding sixteen
more, as above.</P>
<P>But another Accident brought us to a Necessity
of further Business with these People, and indeed
we had like to have put an End to our Lives and Ad∣ventures
all at once among them; for, about three
Days after our Putting out to Sea, from the Place
where we had that Skirmish, we were attack'd
by a violent Storm of Wind from the South, or
rather a Hurricane of Wind from all the Points
Southward, for it blew in a most desperate and
furious Manner, from the S. E. to the S. W.
one Minute at one Point, and then instantly turn∣ing
about again to another Point, but with the
same Violence; nor were we able to work the
Ship in that Condition: So that the Ship I was
in split three Topsails, and at last brought the
Main Top-mast by the Board; and in a Word,
we were once or twice driven right ashore; and
one time, had not the Wind shifted the very
Moment it did, we had been dash'd in a Thou∣sand
Pieces upon a great Ledge of Rocks, which
lay off about Half a League from the Shore; but,
as I have said, the Wind shifting very often, and
at that time coming to the E. S. E. we stretcht
off, and got above a League more Sea-room in
Half an Hour. After that, it blew with some
Fury S. W. by S. then S. W. by W. and put us
back again a great Way to the Eastward of the
Ledge of Rocks, where we found a fair Opening
between the Rocks and the Land, and endea∣voured
to come to an Anchor there; but we
<PB N="271" REF="289"/>
found there was no Ground fit to Anchor in, and
that we should lose our Anchors, there being no∣thing
but Rocks. We stood thro' the Opening,
which held about four Leagues; the Storm con∣tinued,
and now we found a dreadful foul Shore,
and knew not what Course to take. We look'd
out very narrowly for some River, or Creek, or
Bay, where we might run in, and come to an
Anchor, but found none a great while. At length
we saw a great Head-Land lye out far South into
the Sea, and that to such a Length, that, in short,
we saw plainly, that if the Wind held where it
was, we could not Weather it; so we run in as
much under the Lee of the Point as we could,
and came to an Anchor in about twelve Fathom
Water.</P>
<P>But the Wind veering again in the Night, and
blowing exceeding hard, our Anchors came home,
and the Ship drove till the Rudder struck against
the Ground; and had the Ship gone Half her
Length further, she had been lost, and every one
of us with her. But our Sheet Anchor held its
own, and we heaved in some of the Cable, to get
clear of the Ground we had struck upon. It was
by this only Cable that we rode it out all Night,
and towards Morning we thought the Wind aba∣ted
a little, and it was well for us that it was so;
for in spite of what our Sheet Anchor did for us,
we found the Ship fast a-ground in the Morning,
to our very great Surprize and Amazement.</P>
<P>When the Tide was out, tho' the Water here
ebb'd away, the Ship lay almost dry upon a
Bank of hard Sand, which never, I suppose, had
any Ship upon it before; the People of the Coun∣try
came down in great Numbers, to look at us,
and gaze, not knowing what we were, but gaping
<PB N="272" REF="290"/>
at us as at a great Sight or Wonder, at which
they were surpriz'd, and knew not what to do.</P>
<P>I have Reason to believe, that upon the Sight
they immediately sent an Account of a Ship being
there, and of the Condition we were in; for the
next Day there appeared a great Man, whether
it was their King or no, I knew not, but he had
Abundance of Men with him, and some with long
Javelins in their Hands, as long as Half Pikes;
and these came all down to the Water's Edge, and
drew up in very good Order just in our View.
They stood near an Hour without making any
Motion, and then there came near twenty of
them with a Man before them, carrying a white
Flag before them. They came forward into the
Water as high as their Wastes, the Sea not going
so high as before, for the Wind was abated, and
blew off Shore.</P>
<P>The Man made a long Oration to us, as we
could see by his Gestures, and we sometimes heard
his Voice, but knew not a Word he said. <HI>William,</HI>
who was always useful to us, I believe, was here
again the Saving of all our Lives. The Case was
this. The Fellow, or what I might call him,
when his Speech was done, gave three great
Screams, for I know not what else to say they
were, then lower'd his white Flag three times,
and then made three Motions to us with his Arm,
to come to him.</P>
<P>I acknowledge, that I was for Manning out the
Boat, and going to them; but <HI>William</HI> would
by no means allow me: He told me, we ought
to trust no Body; that if they were the Barbari∣ans,
and under their own Government, we might
be sure to be all murthered; and if they were
Christians, we should not fare much better, if
<PB N="273" REF="291"/>
they knew who we were; that it was the Custom
of the <HI>Malabars,</HI> to betray all People that they
could get into their Hands; and that these were
some of the same People; and that if we had
any Regard to our own Safety, we should not
go to them by any means. I opposed him a great
while, and told him, I thought he used to be
always right, but that now I thought he was not;
that I was no more for running needless Risques,
than he, or any one else; but I thought all Na∣tions
in the World, even the most savage People,
when they held out a Flag of Peace, kept the
Offer of Peace made by that Signal, very sacred∣ly,
and I gave him several Examples of it in my
History of my <HI>African</HI> Travels, which I have here
gone thro' in the Beginning of this Work; and
that I could not think these People worse than
some of them. And besides, I told him, our
Case seem'd to be such, that we must fall into
some body's Hands or other, and that we had
better fall into their Hands by a friendly Treaty,
than by a forced Submission; nay, tho' they had
indeed a treacherous Design; and therefore I was
for a Parley with them.</P>
<P>Well, Friend, says <HI>William</HI> very gravely, if thou
wilt go, I cannot help it; I shall only desire to
take my last Leave of thee at Parting, for depend
upon it, thou wilt never see us again: Whether
we in the Ship may come off any better at last, I
cannot resolve thee; but this I will answer for, that
we will not give up our Lives idly, and in cool
Blood, as thou art going to do; we will at least
preserve our selves as long as we can, and die at
last like Men, not like Fools trapann'd by the
Wiles of a few Barbarians.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="292"/>
<HI>William</HI> spoke this with so much Warmth, and
yet with so much Assurance of our Fate, that I
began to think a little of the Risque I was go∣ing
to run. I had no more Mind to be murthe∣red
than he; and yet I could not for my Life be
so faint-hearted in the thing, as he. Upon which
I asked him, if he had any Knowledge of the
Place, or had ever been here? He said, <HI>No.</HI> Then
I asked him, if he had heard or read any thing
about the People of this Island, and of their Way
of treating any Christians that had fallen into
their Hands? And he told me, he had heard of
one, and he would tell me the Story afterward.
His Name, he said, was <HI>Knox,</HI> Commander of an
<HI>East India</HI> Ship, who was driven on Shore, just as
we were, upon this Island of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> tho' he could
not say it was at the same Place, or whereabouts:
That he was beguiled by the Barbarians, and in∣ticed
to come on Shore, just as we were invited to
do at that time; and that when they had him,
they surrounded him and eighteen or twenty of
his Men, and never suffered them to return, but
kept them Prisoners, or murthered them, he
could not well tell which; but they were carried
away up into the Country, separated from one
another, and never heard of afterwards, except
the Captain's Son, who miraculously made his
Escape after twenty Years Slavery.</P>
<P>I had no Time then to ask him to give the
full Story of this <HI>Knox,</HI> much less to hear him
tell it me; but as it is usual in such Cases, when
one begins to be a little touch'd, I turn'd short
with him, Why then, Friend <HI>William,</HI> said I,
what would you have us do? You see what
Condition we are in, and what is before us; some∣thing
must be done, and that immediately. Why,
<PB N="275" REF="293"/>
says <HI>William,</HI> I'll tell thee what thou shalt do: First
cause a white Flag to be hang'd out, as they do
to us, and Man out the Long-Boat and Pinnace
with as many Men as they can well stow, to han∣dle
their Arms, and let me go with them, and
thou shalt see what we will do. If I miscarry, thou
may'st be safe; and I will also tell thee, that if I
do miscarry, it shall be my own Fault, and thou
shalt learn Wit by my Folly.</P>
<P>I knew not what to reply to him at first; but
after some Pause, I said, <HI>William, William,</HI> I am
as loath you should be lost, as you are that I
should; and if there be any Danger, I desire you
may no more fall into it than I. Therefore, if
you will, let us all keep in the Ship, fare alike,
and take our Fate together.</P>
<P>No, no, says <HI>William,</HI> there's no Danger in the
Method I propose; thou shalt go with me, if
thou thinkest fit. If thou pleasest but to follow
the Measures that I shall resolve on, depend upon
it, tho' we will go off from the Ships, we will not a
Man of us go any nearer them than within Call
to talk with them. Thou seest they have no
Boats to come off to us; but, says he, I rather
desire thou wouldst take my Advice, and manage
the Ship, as I shall give the Signal from the Boat,
and let us concert that Matter together before we
go off.</P>
<P>Well, I found <HI>William</HI> had his Measures in his
Head all laid before-hand, and was not at a Loss
what to do at all; so I told him he should be Cap∣tain
for this Voyage, and we would be all of us
under his Orders, which I would see observed to
a Tittle.</P>
<P>Upon this Conclusion of our Debates, he or∣dered
four and Twenty Men into the Long-Boat,
<PB N="276" REF="294"/>
and twelve Men into the Pinnace, and the Sea
being now pretty smooth, they went off, being
all very well arm'd. Also he ordered, that all
the Guns of the great Ship, on the Side which
lay next the Shore, should be loaded with Mus∣quet
Balls, old Nails, Stubbs, and such like Pieces
of old Iron, Lead, and any thing that came to
Hand; and that we should prepare to fire as soon
as ever he saw us lower the white Flag, and hoist
up a red one in the Pinnace.</P>
<P>With these Measures fix'd between us, they
went off towards the Shore, <HI>William</HI> in the Pin∣nace
with twelve Men, and the Long-Boat coming
after him with four and twenty more, all stout,
resolute Fellows, and very well arm'd. They
row'd so near the Shore, as that they might speak
to one another, carrying a white Flag as the other
did, and offerring a <HI>Parle.</HI> The Brutes, for such
they were, shewed themselves very courteous, but
finding we could not understand them, they
fetch'd an old <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who had been their
Prisoner many Years, and set him to speak to us.
The Sum and Substance of his Speech was, That
the King of the Country had sent his General
down to know who we were, and what our Bu∣siness
was? <HI>William</HI> stood up in the Stern of the
Pinnace, and told him, That as to that, he that
was an <HI>European</HI> by his Language and Voice, might
easily know what we were, and our Condition;
the Ship being a-ground upon the Sand, would
also tell him, that our Business there was that of
a Ship in Distress; so <HI>William</HI> desired to know
what they came down for with such a Multitude,
and with Arms and Weapons, as if they came to
War with us.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="295"/>
He answered, they might have good Reason
to come down to the Shore, the Country being
alarmed with the Appearance of Ships of Stran∣gers
upon the Coast; and as our Vessels were full
of Men, and that we had Guns and Weapons, the
King had sent Part of his military Men, that, in
Case of any Invasion upon the Country, they
might be ready to defend themselves, whatsoe∣ver
might be the Occasion.</P>
<P>But, says he, as you are Men in Distress, the
King has ordered his General who is here also, to
give you all the Assistance he can, and to invite
you on Shore, to receive you with all possible
Courtesy. Says <HI>William</HI> very quick upon him,
before I give thee an Answer to that, I desire
thee to tell me what thou art; for by thy Speech
thou art an <HI>European.</HI> He answered presently,
he was a <HI>Dutchman.</HI> That I know well, says <HI>Wil∣liam,</HI>
by thy Speech; but art thou a Native <HI>Dutch∣man</HI>
of <HI>Holland,</HI> or a Native of this Country, that
has learnt <HI>Dutch</HI> by conversing among the <HI>Hollan∣ders,</HI>
who we know are settled upon this Island.</P>
<P>No, <HI>says the Old Man,</HI> I am a Native of <HI>Delft</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Well, says <HI>William</HI> immediately, but art thou
a Christian or a Heathen, or what we call a
Renegado?</P>
<P>I am, <HI>says he,</HI> a Christan, and so they went on
in a short Dialogue, as follows.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> and a Christian,
thou sayest; pray, art thou a Freeman or a
Servant?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a Servant to the King here, and
in his Army.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But art thou a Voluntier, or a Prisoner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="278" REF="296"/>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I was a Prisoner at first, but am
at Liberty now, and so am a Voluntier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is to say, being first a Prisoner thou
hast Liberty to serve them; but art thou so at
Liberty, that thou mayest go away, if thou plea∣sest,
to thine own Countrymen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I do not say so; my Country∣men
live a great Way off, on the North and East
Parts of the Island, and there is no going to them,
without the King's express Licence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and why dost not thou get a Li∣cence
to go away?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have never ask'd for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I suppose, if thou didst, thou knowst
thou couldst not obtain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say much as to that, but why
do you ask me all these Questions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, my Reason is good; if thou art a
Christian and a Prisoner, how canst thou consent
to be made an Instrument to these Barbarians, to
betray us into their Hands, who are thy Country∣men
and Fellow-Christians? Is it not a barbarous
thing in thee to do so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do I go about to betray you? Do
I not give you an Account, how the King invites
you to come on Shore, and has ordered you to
be treated courteously, and assisted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>As thou art a Christian, tho' I doubt it
much, dost thou believe the King or the General,
as thou callest it, means one Word of what he
says?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>He promises you by the Mouth of his
Great General.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't ask thee what he promises, or by
whom; but I ask thee this: Canst thou say, that
thou believest he intends to perform it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="279" REF="297"/>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I answer that? How can I tell
what he intends?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou canst tell what thou believest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot say but he will perform it; I
believe he may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art but a double-tongu'd Christian,
I doubt: Come, I'll ask thee another Question:
Wilt thou say, that thou believest it; and that
thou wouldst advise me to believe it, and put our
Lives into their Hands upon these Promises?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not to be your Adviser.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art perhaps afraid to speak thy
Mind, because thou art in their Power: Pray,
do any of them understand what thou and I say?
Can they speak <HI>Dutch?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not one of them, I have no Ap∣prehensions
upon that Account at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then answer me plainly, if thou art
a Christian: Is it safe for us to venture upon their
Words, to put our selves into their Hands, and
come on Shore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put it very home to me: Pray
let me ask you another Question: Are you in
any Likelihood of getting your Ship off, if you
refuse it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, we shall get off the Ship, now
the Storm is over, we don't fear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I cannot say it is best for you to
trust them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it is honestly said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what shall I say to them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give them good Words, as they give us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What good Words?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why let them tell the King, that we are
Strangers, who were driven on his Coast by a
great Storm; that we thank him very kindly for
<PB N="280" REF="298"/>
his Offer of Civility to us, which, if we are far∣ther
distress'd, we will accept thankfully; but
that at present we have no Occasion to come on
Shore: And besides, that we cannot safely leave
the Ship in the present Condition she is in, but
that we are obliged to take Care of her, in order
to get her off, and expect in a Tide or two more,
to get her quite clear, and at an Anchor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he will expect you to come on
Shore then to visit him, and make him some
Present for his Civility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we have got our Ship clear, and
stopp'd the Leaks, we will pay our Respects to
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, you may as well come to him
now as then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, hold Friend, I did not say we would
come to him then: You talk'd of making him a
Present; that is, to pay our Respects to him, is
it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but I will tell him, that you
will come on Shore to him when your Ship is got
off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to say to that, you may
tell him what you think fit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he will be in a great Rage, if I
do not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who will he be in a great Rage at?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>At you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Occasion have we to value that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, he will send all his Army down
against you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what if they were all here just now?
What dost thou suppose they could do to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would expect they should burn
your Ships, and bring you all to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="281" REF="299"/>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell him, if he try, he may catch a
<HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has a World of Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>No, he has no Ships.</P>

<P>Nor Boats?</P>

<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor Boats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what then do you think we care
for his Men? What canst thou do now to us, if
thou hadst a Hundred Thousand with thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! they might set you on Fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Set us a Firing</HI> thou mean'st: That they
might indeed; but <HI>Set us on Fire,</HI> they shall not;
they may try at their Peril, and we shall make
mad Work with your Hundred Thousand Men,
if they come within Reach of our Guns, I assure
thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if the King give you Hosta∣ges
for your Safety?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whom can he give but mere Slaves and
Servants like thy self, whose Lives he no more
values, than we an <HI>English</HI> Hound?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whom do you demand for Hostages?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Himself and your Worship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you do with him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do with him, as he would do with us,
cut his Head off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you do to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do with thee? We would carry thee
home into thine own Country; and tho' thou
deservest the Gallows, we would make a Man
and a Christian of thee again, and not do by
thee as thou wouldst have done by us, betray
thee to a Parcel of merciless, savage Pagans, that
know no God, nor how to shew Mercy to Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="282" REF="300"/>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put a Thought in my Head that
I will speak to you about to Morrow.</P>
<P>Thus they went away, and <HI>William</HI> came on
board, and gave us a full Account of his Parley
with the old <HI>Dutchman,</HI> which was very diver∣ting,
and to me instructing, for I had Abundance
of Reason to acknowledge <HI>William</HI> had made a
better Judgment of things than I.</P>
</SP>
<P>It was our good Fortune to get our Ship off
that very Night, and to bring her to an Anchor
at about a Mile and a Half further out, and in
deep Water, to our great Satisfaction; so that
we had no need to fear the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s King with
his Hundred Thousand Men; and indeed we had
some Sport with them the next Day, when they
came down, a vast prodigious Multitude of them,
very few less in Number, in our Imagination,
than a Hundred Thousand, with some Elephants;
tho' if it had been an Army of Elephants, they
could have done us no Harm, for we were fairly
at our Anchor now, and out of their Reach; and
indeed we thought our selves more out of their
Reach, than we really were; and it was ten
Thousand to One, that we had not been fast
a-ground again; for the Wind blowing off Shore,
tho' it made the Water smooth where we lay,
yet it blew the Ebb further out than usual, and
we could easily perceive the Sand which we
touch'd upon before, lay in the Shape of a Half
Moon, and surrounded us with two Horns of it;
so that we lay in the Middle or Center of it, as
in a round Bay, safe just as we were, and in deep
Water; but present Death, as it were, on the
right Hand, and on the left, for the two Horns,
<PB N="283" REF="301"/>
or Points of the Sand, reach'd out beyond where
our Ship lay near two Miles.</P>
<P>On that Part of the Sand which lay on our East
Side, this misguided Multitude extended them∣selves;
and being most of them not above their
Knees, or most of them not above Ancle deep
in the Water, they, as it were, surrounded us on
that Side, and on the Side of the main Land,
and a little Way on the other Side of the Sand,
standing in a Half Circle, or rather three Fifths
of a Circle, for about six Miles in Length; the
other Horn, or Point of the Sand which lay on
our West Side being not quite so shallow, they
could not extend themselves upon it so far.</P>
<P>They little thought what Service they had
done us, and how unwillingly, and by the great∣est
Ignorance, they had made themselves Pilots to
us, while we having not sounded the Place, might
have been lost, before we were aware. It is true,
we might have sounded our new Harbour, before
we had ventured out; but I cannot say for cer∣tain,
whether we should or not; for I, for my
Part, had not the least Suspicion of what our real
Case was. However, I say, perhaps before we
had weigh'd, we should have look'd about us a
little. I am sure we ought to have done it; for
besides these Armies of human Furies, we had a
very leaky Ship, and all our Pumps could hardly
keep the Water from growing upon us, and our
Carpenters were over-board working to find out,
and stop the Wounds we had received, heeling
her first on one Side, and then on the other; and
it was very diverting to see how, when our Men
heel'd the Ship over to the Side next the wild
Army that stood on the East Horn of the Sand,
they were so amazed between Fright and Joy,
<PB N="284" REF="302"/>
that it put them into a kind of Confusion, calling
to one another, hallooing and skreeking in a
Manner as it is impossible to describe.</P>
<P>While we were doing this, for we were in a
great Hurry, you may be sure, and all Hands at
Work, as well at the stopping our Leaks, as re∣pairing
our Rigging and Sails, which had receiv'd
a great deal of Damage, and also in rigging a
new Main-Top-Mast, and the like: I say, while
we were doing all this, we perceived a Body of
Men, of near a Thousand, move from that Part
of the Army of the Barbarians, that lay at the
Bottom of the sandy Bay, and came all along the
Water's Edge, round the Sand, till they stood just
on our Broadside <HI>East,</HI> and were within about
Half a Mile of us. Then we saw the <HI>Dutchman</HI>
come forward nearer to us, and all alone, with
his white Flag and all his Motions, just as before,
and there he stood.</P>
<P>Our Men had but just brought the Ship to
Rights again, as they came up to our Broadside,
and we had very happily found out and stopp'd
the worst and most dangerous Leak that we had,
to our very great Satisfaction; so I ordered the
Boats to be haul'd up, and Mann'd as they were
the Day before, and <HI>William</HI> to go as Plenipoten∣tiary.
I would have gone my self, if I had under∣stood
<HI>Dutch;</HI> but as I did not, it was to no Pur∣pose,
for I should be able to know nothing of
what was said, but from him at second Hand,
which might be done as well afterwards. All the
Instructions I pretended to give <HI>William,</HI> was, if
possible, to get the old <HI>Dutchman</HI> away, and, if
he could, to make him come on board.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William</HI> went just as before; and when
he came within about sixty or seventy Yards of
<PB N="285" REF="303"/>
the Shore, he held up his white Flag, as the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> did, and turning the Boat's Broaside to
the Shore, and his Men lying upon their Oars,
the Parley or Dialogue began again thus.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Friend, what do'st thou say tou s

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>

out of Danger of all that they can do? What
makes thee act so simply as well as so knavishly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dutchm.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you may think your selves safer

may do to you. I can assure you they are able to
do you a great deal of Harm, and perhaps burn
your Ship.</P>

<SPEAKER>Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou mayest be sure the Ship will fire,

<P>Just at this time our Ship fired three Guns, to
answer the Sloop, and let her know we saw her,
who immediately, we perceived, understood it,
and stood directly for the Place; but it is impossi∣ble
to express the Confusion and filthy vile Noise,
the Hurry and universal Disorder, that was
among that vast Multitude of People, upon our
Firing of three Guns. They immediately all re∣paired
to their Arms, as I may call it; for, to
say they put themselves into Order, would be
saying nothing.</P>
</SP>
<P>Upon the Word of Command then they ad∣vanced
all in a Body to the Sea-side, and resol∣ving
to give us one Volley of their Fire Arms,
for such they were, immediately they saluted
us with a Hundred Thousand of their Fire-Ar∣rows,
every one carrying a little Bag of Cloath
dipt in Brimstone, or some such thing; which
flying thro' the Air, had nothig to hinder it ta∣king
Fire as it flew, and it generally did so.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="307"/>
I cannot say but this Method of attacking us,
by a Way we had no Notion of, might give us at
first some little Surprize; for the Number was so
great at first, that we were not altogether with∣out
Apprehensions that they might unluckily set
our Ship on Fire; so that he resolved immediately
to row on Board, and perswade us all to weigh,
and stand out to Sea; but there was no time for
it, for they immediately let fly a Volley at the
Boat, and at the Ship from all Parts of the vast
Crowd of People which stood near the Shore.</P>
<P>Nor did they fire, as I may call it, all at once,
and so leave off; but their Arrows being soon
notch'd upon their Bows, they kept continually
shooting, so that the Air was full of Flame.</P>
<P>I could not say whether they set their Cotton
Rag on Fire before they shot the Arrow, for I
did not perceive they had Fire with them, which
however it seems they had. The Arrow, besides
the Fire it carried with it, had a Head, or a Peg,
as we call it, of a Bone, and some of sharp Flint
Stone; and some few of a Metal, too soft in itself
for Metal, but hard enough to cause it to enter,
if it were a Plank, so as to stick where it fell.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> and his Men had Notice sufficient to lye
close behind their Waste-boards, which for this
very Purpose they had made so high, that they
could easily sink themselves behind them, so as to
defend themselves from any thing that came Point
blank, <HI>as we call it,</HI> or upon a Line; but for what
might fall perpendicular out of the Air, they had
no Guard, but took the Hazard of that. At first
they made as if they would row away, but be∣fore
they went, they gave a Volley of their
small Arms, firing at those which stood with the
<HI>Dutchman;</HI> but <HI>William</HI> ordered them to be sure
<PB N="290" REF="308"/>
to take their Aim at others so as to miss him,
and they did so.</P>
<P>There was no Calling to them now, for the
Noise was so great among them, that they could
hear no Body; but our Men boldlyrow'd in nearer
to them, for they were at first driven a little off,
and when they came nearer, they fired a second
Volley, which put the Fellows into a great Con∣fusion,
and we could see from the Ship, that seve∣ral
of them were killed or wounded.</P>
<P>We thought this was a very unequal Fight,
and therefore we made a Signal to our Men, to
row away, that we might have a little of the
Sport as well as they; but the Arrows flew so
thick upon them, being so near the Shore, that
they could not sit to their Oars; so they spread
a little of their Sail, thinking they might sail
along the Shore, and lye behind their Waste∣boards:
But the Sail had not been spread six
Minutes, but it had five Hundred Fire-Arrows
shot into it, and thro' it, and at length set it
fairly on Fire; nor were our Men quite out of
the Danger of its setting the Boat on Fire, and
this made them paddle and shove the Boat away
as well as they could, as they lay, to get further
off.</P>
<P>By this time they had left us a fair Mark at the
whole Savage Army; and as we had sheer'd the
Ship as near to them as we could, we fired among
the thickest of them six or seven times, five Guns
at a time, whichshot old Iron, Musquet Bullets <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>We could easily see that we made Havock of
them, and killed and wounded Abundance of
them, and that they were in a great Surprize at
it; but yet they never offered to stir, and all this
while their Fire-Arrows flew as thick as before.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="309"/>
At last, on a sudden their Arrows stopt, and
the old <HI>Dutchman</HI> came running down to the Wa∣ter
Side, all alone, with his white Flag as before,
waving it as high as he could, and making Sig∣nals
to our Boat to come to him again.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> did not care at first to go near him, but
the Man continuing to make Signals to him to
come, at last <HI>William</HI> went, and the <HI>Dutchman</HI> told
him, that he had been with the General, who was
much mollified by the Slaughter of his Men, and
that now he could have any thing of him.</P>
<P>Any thing, says <HI>William,</HI> what have we to do
with him? Let him go about his Business, and
carry his Men out of Gun-Shot: Can't he?</P>
<P>Why, says the <HI>Dutchman,</HI> but he dares not stir,
nor see the King's Face; unless some of your
Men come on Shore, he will certainly put him to
Death.</P>
<P>Why then, says <HI>William,</HI> he is a dead Man; for
if it were to save his Life, and the Lives of all
the Crowd that is with him, he shall never have
one of us in his Power.</P>
<P>But I'll tell thee, said <HI>William,</HI> how thou shalt
cheat him, and gain thy own Liberty too, if thou
hast any Mind to see thy own Country again, and
art not turn'd Savage, and grown fond of living
all thy Days among Heathens and Savages.</P>
<P>I would be glad to do it with all my Heart,
says he; but if I should offer to swim off to you
now, tho' they are so far from me, they shoot so
true, that they would kill me before I got half
Way.</P>
<P>But, says <HI>William,</HI> I'll tell thee how thou shalt
come with his Consent; go to him, and tell him,
I have offer'd to carry you on board, to try if you
could perswade the Captain to come on Shore,
<PB N="292" REF="310"/>
and that I would not hinder him, if he was wil∣ling
to venture.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutchman</HI> seem'd in a Rapture at the very
first Word: I'll do it, says he, I am perswaded
he will give me Leave to come.</P>
<P>Away he runs, as if he had a glad Message to
carry, and tells the General, that <HI>William</HI> had pro∣mised,
if he would go on board the Ship with me,
he would perswade the Captain to return with him.
The General was Fool enough to give him Order
to go, and charg'd him not to come back without
the Captain, which he readily promised, and ve∣ry
honestly might.</P>
<P>So they took him in, and brought him on board,
and he was as good as his Word to them, for he
never went back to them any more; and the
Sloop being come to the Mouth of the Inlet where
we lay, we weighed, and set Sail. But as we
went out, being pretty near the Shore, we fired
three Guns as it were among them, but without
any Shot, for it was of no Use to us, to hurt any
more of them. After we had fired, we gave them
a Chear, as the Seamen call it; <HI>that is to say,</HI> we
halloo'd at them by way of Triumph, and so car∣ried
off their Ambass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dor; how it fared with
their General, we know nothing of that.</P>
<P>This Passage, when I related it to a Friend of
mine, after my Return from those Rambles, agreed
so well with his Relation of what happened to one
Mr. <HI>Knox,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Captain, who some time ago
was decoyed on Shore by those People, that it
could not but be very much to my Satisfaction to
think what Mischief we had all escaped; and I
think it cannot but be very profitable to record
the other Story, <HI>which is but short,</HI> with my own,
to shew, whoever reads this, what it was I avoided,
<PB N="293" REF="311"/>
and prevent their falling into the like, if they
have to do with the perfidious People of <HI>Ceylon.</HI>
The Relation is as follows.</P>
<P>The Island of <HI>Ceylon</HI> being inhabited for the
greatest Part by Barbarians, which will not allow
any Trade or Commerce with any <HI>European</HI> Na∣tion,
and inaccessible by any Travellers, it will
be convenient to relate the Occasion how the Au∣thor
of this Story happen'd to go into this
Island, and what Opportunities he had of being
fully acquainted with the People, their Laws and
Customs, that so we may the better depend upon
the Account, and value it as it deserves, for the
Rarity as well as the Truth of it; and both these
the Author gives us a brief Relation of, in this
Manner. His Words are as follows.</P>
<P>In the Year 1657, the <HI>Anne</HI> Fregat, of <HI>London,</HI>
Captain <HI>Robert Knox</HI> Commander, on the 21st of
<HI>January,</HI> set Sail out of the <HI>Downes,</HI> in the Service
of the Honourable the <HI>East India</HI> Company of
<HI>England,</HI> bound for <HI>Fort St. George</HI> upon the Coast
of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> to trade for one Year from Port
to Port in <HI>India;</HI> which having performed, as he
was lading his Goods to return for <HI>England,</HI> be∣ing
in the Road of <HI>Matlipatam,</HI> on the 19th of
<HI>November</HI> 1659, there happen'd such a mighty
Storm, that in it several Ships were cast away,
and he was forc'd to cut his Main Mast by the
Board, which so disabled the Ship, that he could
not proceed in his Voyage; whereupon, <HI>Cotiar,</HI>
in the Island of <HI>Ceylon</HI> being a very commodious
Bay fit for her present Distress, <HI>Thomas Cham∣bers,</HI>
Es{que} since Sir <HI>Thomas Chambers,</HI> the Agent at
<HI>Fort St. George,</HI> ordered that the Ship should take
<PB N="294" REF="312"/>
in some Cloath and <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants belonging
to <HI>Porta Nova,</HI> who might trade there while she
lay to set her Mast, and repair the other Dama∣ges
sustained by the Storm. At her first coming
thither, after the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants were set on
Shore, the Captain and his Men were very jea∣lous
of the People of the Place, by reason the
<HI>English</HI> never had any Commerce or Dealing with
them; but after they had been there twenty Days,
going ashore and returning again at Pleasure,
without any Molestation, they began to lay aside
all suspicious Thoughts of the People that dwelt
thereabouts, who had kindly entertained them
for their Money.</P>
<P>By this time the King of the Country had No∣tice
of their Arrival, and not being acquainted
with their Intents, he sent down a <HI>Dissuava,</HI> or
General, with an Army to them, who immedi∣ately
sent a Messenger to the Captain on board,
to desire him to come ashore to him, pretending
a Letter from the King. The Captain saluted
the Message with Firing of Guns, and ordered
his Son <HI>Robert Knox,</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Loveland,</HI> Mer∣chant
of the Ship, to go ashore and wait on him.
When they were come before him, he demanded
<HI>Who they were, and how long they should stay?</HI> They
told him, <HI>They were</HI> Englishmen, <HI>and not to stay
above twenty or thirty Days, and desired Permission to
trade in his Majesty's Port.</HI> His Answer was, <HI>That
the King was glad to hear that the</HI> English <HI>were come
into his Country, and had commanded him to assist them,
as they should desire, and had sent a Letter to be de∣livered
to none but the Captain himself.</HI> They were
then twelve Miles from the Sea-Side, and there∣fore
replied, <HI>That the Captain could not leave his Ship
to come so far; but if he pleased to go down to the
<PB N="295" REF="313"/>
Sea-Side, the Captain would wait on him to receive the
Letter.</HI> Whereupon the <HI>Dissuava</HI> desired them
to stay that Day, and on the Morrow he would go
with them; which, rather than displease him in
so small a Matter, they consented to. In the
Evening, the <HI>Dissuava</HI> sent a Present to the Cap∣tain
of Cattle and Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which being car∣ried
all Night by the Messengers, was delivered
to him in the Morning, who told him withal,
that his Men were coming down with the <HI>Dissua∣va,</HI>
and desired his Company on Shore against his
coming, having a Letter from the King to deliver
into his own Hand. The Captain mistrusting
nothing, came on Shore with his Boat, and sit∣ting
under a Tamarind Tree, waited for the
<HI>Dissuava.</HI> In the mean time, the Native Soldiers
privately surrounded him and the seven Men he
had with him, and seizing them, carrried them
to meet the <HI>Dissuava,</HI> bearing the Captain on a
Hammock on their Shoulders.</P>
<P>The next Day the Long-Boat's Crew, not know∣ing
what had happen'd, came on Shore to cut
down a Tree to make Cheeks for the Main-Mast,
and were made Prisoners after the same Man∣ner,
tho' with more Violence, because they were
more rough with them, and made Resistance, yet
they were not brought to the Captain and his
Company, but quarter'd in another House in the
same Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dissuava</HI> having thus gotten two Boats,
and eighteen Men, his next Care was to gain the
Ship, and, to that End, telling the Captain that
he and his Men were only detained because the
King intended to send Letters and a Present to
the <HI>English</HI> Nation by him, desired he would
send some Men on board his Ship to order her
<PB N="296" REF="314"/>
Stay; and because the Ship was in Danger of
being fired by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> if she stay'd long in
the Bay, to bring her up the River. The Cap∣tain
did not approve of the Advice, but did not
dare own his Dislike; and so sent his Son with
the Order, but with a solemn Conjuration to
return again, which he accordingly did, bring∣ing
a Letter from the Company in the Ship,
<HI>That they would not obey the Captain, nor any other in
this Matter, but were resolved to stand on their own
Defence.</HI> This Letter satisfied the <HI>Dissuava,</HI> who
thereupon gave the Captain Leave to write for
what he would have brought him from the
Ship, pretending, that he had not the King's
Order to release them, though it would sud∣denly
come.</P>
<P>The Captain seeing he was held in Suspense,
and the Season of the Year spending for the Ship
to proceed on her Voyage to some Place, sent
Order to Mr. <HI>John Bur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord</HI> the chief Mate, to
take Charge of the Ship, and set Sail to <HI>Porta
Nova,</HI> from whence they came, and there to
follow the Agent's Order.</P>
<P>And now began that long and sad Captivity
they all along feared; the Ship being gone, the
<HI>Dissuava</HI> was called up to the King, and they
were kept under Guards a while, till a special
Order came from the King to part them, and
put one in a Town, for the Conveniency of
their Maintenance, which the King ordered to
be at the Charge of the Country. On <HI>September,</HI>
16, 1660, the Captain and his Son were placed
in a Town called <HI>Bonder Cooswat,</HI> in the Country
of <HI>Hotcurly,</HI> distant from the City of <HI>Candi</HI>
Northward thirty Miles, and, from the rest of
the <HI>English,</HI> a full Day's Journey. Here they had
<PB N="297" REF="315"/>
their Provisions brought them twice a Day,
without Money, so much as they could eat, and
as good as the Country yielded. The Situation of
the Place was very pleasant and commodious, but
that Year that Part of the Land was very sickly
by Agues and Fevers, of which many died.
The Captain and his Son, after some time, were
visited with the common Distemper, and the
Captain being also loaded with Grief for his
deplorable Condition, languish'd more than three
Months, and then died, <HI>February</HI> the 9th 1660.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Knox</HI> his Son being now left desolate,
sick, and in Captivity, having none to comfort
him but God, who is the Father of the father∣less,
and hears the Groans of such as are in
Captivity, being alone to enter upon a long
Scene of Misery and Calamity, oppress'd with
Weakness of Body and Grief of Soul, for the
Loss of his Father, and his remediless Trouble
that he was like to endure; and the first In∣stance
of it was in the Burial of his Father: For
he sent his Black Boy to the People of the
Town, to desire their Assistance, because they
understood not their Language; but they sent
him only a Rope to drag him by the Neck into
the Woods, and told him, <HI>that they would offer
him no other Help unless he would pay for it.</HI> This
barbarous Answer increased his Trouble, for
his Father's Death, that now he was like to lye
unburied, and be made a Prey to the wild Beasts
in the Woods; for the Ground was very hard,
and they had not Tools to dig with, and so it was
impossible for them to bury him; but having
a small Matter of Money left him, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Pagoda,</HI>
and a Gold Ring, he hired a Man, and so buried
<PB N="298" REF="316"/>
him in as decent a Manner as their Condition
would permit.</P>
<P>His dead Father being thus removed out of
his Sight, but his Ague continuing, he was re∣duced
very low, partly by Sorrow, and partly
by his Disease; all the Comfort he had, was to
go into the Wood, and Fields with a Book,
either the <HI>Practice of Piety,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Roger</HI>'s <HI>Seven
Treatises,</HI> which were the only two Books he
had, and meditate and read, and sometimes pray,
in which, his Anguish made him often
invert <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Petition, <HI>That he might die,</HI> because
his Life was a burthen to him. God, tho' he
was pleased to prolong his Life, yet he found
a Way to lighten his Grief, by removing his Ague,
and granting him a Desire, which above all
things, was acceptable to him. He had read his
two Books over so often, that he had both al∣most
by Heart, and tho' they were both pious
and good Writings, yet he long'd for the Truth
from the original Fountain, and thought it his
greatest Unhappiness, that he had not a Bible,
and did believe, that he should never see one
again: But, contrary to his Expectation, God
brought him one after this Manner. As he was
fishing one Day, with his Black Boy, to catch
some Fish to relieve his Hunger, an old Man
pass'd by them, and asked his Boy, whether his
Master could read; and when the Boy had an∣swered,
<HI>Yes;</HI> he told him, <HI>that he had gotten a
Book from the</HI> Portuguese <HI>when they left</HI> Columbo;
<HI>and, if his Master pleased, he would sell it him.</HI> The
Boy told his Master, who bad him go and see
what Book it was. The Boy having served the
<HI>English</HI> some time, knew the Book, and, as soon
<PB N="299" REF="317"/>
as he had got it into his Hand, came running to
him, calling out before he came to him, '<HI>Tis the
Bible.</HI> The Words startled him, and he flung
down his Angle to meet him, and, finding it true,
was mightily rejoyc'd to see it; but he was a∣fraid
he should not have enough to purchase it,
tho' he was resolved to part with all the Money
he had, which was but one <HI>Pagoda,</HI> to buy it;
but, his Black Boy perswading him to slight it;
and leave it to him to buy it, he at length, ob∣tained
it for a knit Cap.</P>
<P>This Accident he could not but look upon as
a great Miracle, that God should bestow upon
him such an extraordinary Blessing, and bring
him a Bible in his own native Language, in such
a remote Part of the World, where his Name
was not known, and where it was never heard
of, that an <HI>Englishman</HI> had ever been before. The
Enjoyment of this Mercy was a great Comfort
to him in his Captivity, and tho' he wanted no
bodily Convenience that the Country did afford,
for the King immediately after his Father's
Death had sent an express Order to the Peo∣ple
of the Town, that they should be kind to
him, and give him good Victuals; and, after
he had been some time in the Country, and un∣derstood
the Language, he got him good Conve∣niencies,
as, a Horse and Gardens, and falling
to Husbandry, God so prospered him, that he
had Plenty, not only for himself, but to lend
others; which being according to the Custom
of the Country, at 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> a Year, much
enriched him. He had also Goats, which served
him for Mutton, and Hogs and Hens: Notwith∣standing
this, I say, for he lived as fine as any
of their Noblemen, he could not so far forget
<PB N="300" REF="318"/>
his native Country, as to be contented to dwell
in a strange Land, where there was to him a
Famine of God's Word and Sacraments, the
Want of which made all other things to be of lit∣tle
Value to him; therefore, as he made it his
daily and fervent Prayer to God, in his good
time, to restore him to both, so at length he,
with one <HI>Stephen Rutland,</HI> who had lived with him
two Years before, resolved to make their Escape,
and, about the Year 1673, meditated all secret
Ways to compass it. They had before taken
up a Way of Peddling about the Country,
and buying Tobacco, Pepper, Garlick, Combs,
and all sorts of Iron-Ware, and carried them into
those Parts of the Country where they want∣ed
them; and now, to promote their Design,
as they went with their Commodities from
Place to Place, they discoursed with the
Country People, <HI>for they could now speak their
Language well,</HI> concerning the Ways and Inhabi∣tants
where the Isle was thinnest and fullest inha∣bited;
where and how the Watches lay from
one Country to another; and what Commodities
were proper for them to carry into all Parts;
pretending, that they would furnish themselves
with such Wares as the respective Places wanted.
None doubted but what they did was upon the
Account of Trade, because Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> was so well
seated, and could not be supposed to leave such
an Estate, was by travelling Northward, be∣cause
that Part of the Land was least inhabited;
and so furnishing themselves with such Wares
as were vendible in those Parts, they set forth,
and steered their Course towards the North
Part of the Island, knowing very little of the
Ways, which were generally intricate and per∣plexed,
<PB N="301" REF="319"/>
because they have no publick Roads,
but a Multitude of little Paths from one Town
to another, and those often changing; and for
White Men to enquire about the Ways, was very
dangerous, because the People would presently
suspect their Design.</P>
<P>At this Time they travelled from <HI>Canda Ʋda,</HI>
as far as the Country of <HI>Neurecalava,</HI> which is in
the furthermost Parts of the King's Dominions,
and about three Days Journey from their
Dwelling. They were very thankful to Provi∣dence
that they had passed all Difficulties so far;
but yet durst not go any further, because they
had no Wares left to Traffick with; and it being
the first time they had been absent so long
from home, they feared the Townsmen would
come after them to seek for them, and so they
returned home, and went eight or ten times into
those Parts with their Wares, till they became
well acquainted both with the People and the
Paths.</P>
<P>In these Parts Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> met his black Boy,
whom he had turned away divers Years before.
He had now got a Wife and Children, and was
very poor; but being acquainted with these Quar∣ters,
he not only took Directions of him, but
agreed with him for a good Reward, to conduct
him and his Companion to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> He glad∣ly
undertook it, and a Time was appointed be∣tween
them; but Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> being disabled by a
grievous Pain which seized him on his right Side,
and held him five Days, that he could not travel,
this Appointment proved in vain; for tho' he
went as soon as he was well, his Guide was gone
into another Country about his Business, and they
durst not at that time venture to run away with∣out
<PB N="302" REF="320"/>
him. These Attempts took up eight or nine
Years, various Accidents hindring their Designs,
but most commonly the dry Weather, because
they fear'd, in the Woods, they should be starv'd
with Thirst, all the Country being in such a Con∣dition
almost four or five Years together for Lack
of Rain.</P>
<P>On <HI>September</HI> 22. 1679, they set forth again,
furnished with Knives and small Axes, for their
Defence, because they could carry them private∣ly,
and send all Sorts of Wares to sell, as for∣merly,
and all necessary Provisions, the Moon
being twenty seven Days old, that they might have
Light to run away by, to try what Success God
Almighty would now give them, in seeking their
Liberty. Their first Stage was to <HI>Anarodgburro,</HI>
in the Way to which lay a Wilderness, called
<HI>Parraoth Mocolane,</HI> full of wild Elephants, Ty∣gers,
and Bears; and because 'tis the utmost
Confines of the King's Dominions, there is al∣ways
a Watch kept.</P>
<P>In the Middle of the Way, they heard that
the Governour's Officers of these Parts were out
to gather up the King's Revenues and Duties,
to send them up to the City; which put them
into no small Fear, lest finding them, they should
send them back again: Whereupon they with∣drew
to the Western Parts of <HI>Ecpoulpot,</HI> and sat
down to Knitting, till they heard they Officers
were gone. As soon as they were departed, they
went onwards of their Journey, having got a
good Parcel of Cotton Yarn to knit Caps with,
and having kept their Wares, as they pretended,
to exchange for dried Fish, which was sold only
in those lower Parts. Their Way lay necessari∣ly
thro' the Governour's Yard at <HI>Collinilla,</HI> who
<PB N="303" REF="321"/>
dwells there on Purpose to examine all that go
and come. This greatly distress'd them, because
he would easily suspect they were out of their
Bounds, being Captives; however, they went re∣solutely
to his House, and meeting him, presen∣ted
him with a small Parcel of Tobacco and Be∣tel;
and shewing him their Wares, told him, they
came to get dried Flesh to carry back with them.
The Governour did not suspect them, but told
them, he was sorry they came in so dry a Time,
when no Deer could be catched, but if some Rain
fell, he would soon supply them. This Answer
pleased them, and they seemed contented to stay;
and accordingly abiding with him two or three
Days, and no Rain falling, they presented the Go∣vernour
with five or six Charges of Gunpowder,
which is a Rarity among them; and leaving a Bun∣dle
at his House, they desired him to shoot them
some Deer, while they made a Step to <HI>Anarodg∣burro.</HI>
Here also they were put in a great Fright,
by the coming of certain Soldiers from the King
to the Governour, to give him Orders to set a
secure Guard at the Watches, that no suspicious
Persons might pass; which, tho' it was only in∣tended
to prevent the Flight of the Relations of
certain Nobles whom the King had clapt up; yet
they feared they might wonder to see white Men
here, and so send them back again: But God so
ordered it, that they were very kind to them, and
left them to their Business, and so they got safe
to <HI>Anarodgburro.</HI> Their Pretence was dried Flesh,
tho' they knew there was none to be had; but
their real Business was to search the Way down to
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which they staid three Days to do: But
finding, that in the Way to <HI>Jasnapatan,</HI> which is
one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ports, there was a Watch which
<PB N="304" REF="322"/>
could hardly be pass'd, and other Inconveniencies
not surmountable, they resolved to go back, and
take the River <HI>Malwatogah,</HI> which they had before
judged would be a probable Guide to lead them to
the Sea; and that they might not be pursued, left
<HI>Anarodgburro</HI> just at Night, when the People never
travel for fear of wild Beasts. On <HI>Sunday, Oct.</HI> 12.
being stored with all things needful for their Jour∣ney,
<HI>viz.</HI> Ten Days Provision, a Basin to boil their
Provision in, two Calabashes to fetch Water in,
and two great Tallipat Leaves for Tents, with
Jaggory, Sweet-meats, Tobacco, Betell, Tinder-Boxes,
and a Deer-Skin for Shoes, to keep their
Feet from Thorns, because to them they chiefly
trusted. Being come to the River, they struck
into the Woods, and kept by the Side of it; yet
not going on the Sand, lest their Footsteps should
be discerned, unless forced, and then going
backwards.</P>
<P>Being gotten a good Way into the Wood, it be∣gan
to rain; wherefore they erected their Tents,
made a Fire, and refresh'd themselves against the
Rising of the Moon, which was then eighteen
Days old; and having tied Deer-Skins about their
Feet, and eased themselves of their Wares, they
proceeded in their Journey. When they had tra∣velled
three or four Hours with Difficulty, be∣cause
the Moon gave but little Light among the
thick Trees, they found an Elephant in their Way
before them, and because they could not scare him
away, they were forced to stay till Morning; and
so they kindled a Fire, and took a Pipe of Tobac∣co.
By the Light they could not discern that ever
any Body had been there, nothing being to be seen
but Woods, and so they were in great Hopes that
they were past all Danger, being beyond all Inha∣bitants;
<PB N="305" REF="323"/>
but they were mistaken; for the River
winding Northward, brought them into the midst
of a Parcel of Towns, called <HI>Tissea Wava,</HI> where
being in Danger of being seen, they were under
a mighty Terror for had the People found them,
they would have beat them, and sent them up to
the King) and to avoid it, they crept into an
hollow Tree, and sat there in Mud and Wet, till
it began to grow dark, and then betaking them∣selves
to their Legs, travell'd till the Darkness of
Night stop them. They heard Voices behind
them, and feared 'twas somebody in Pursuit of
them; but at length discerning it was only an
Hallooing to keep the wild Beasts out of the
Corn, they pitched their Tents by the River,
and having boiled Rice, and roasted Meat for
their Suppers, and satisfied their Hungers, they
committed themselves to God's Keeping, and laid
them down to Sleep.</P>
<P>The next Morning, to prevent the worst, they
got up early, and hasten'd on their Journey; and
tho' they were now got out of all Danger of the
tame <HI>Chiangulays,</HI> they were in great Danger of the
wild ones, of whom those Woods were full; and
though they saw their Tents, yet they were all
gone, since the Rains had fallen, from the River
into the Woods; and so God kept them from that
Danger, for had they met the wild Men, they
had been shot.</P>
<P>Thus they travelled from Morning to Night
several Days, thro' Bushes and Thorns, which
made their Arms and Shoulders, which were na∣ked,
all of a Gore Blood. They often met with
Bears, Hogs, Deer, and wild Buffloes, but they
all run away as soon as they saw them. The
River was exceeding full of Alligat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s. In the
<PB N="306" REF="324"/>
Evening they used to pitch their Tents, and make
great Fires both before and behind them, to af∣fright
the wild Beasts, and tho' they heard the
Voices of all sorts, they saw none.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> at Noon they cross'd the River
<HI>Coronda Oya,</HI> which parts the Country of the <HI>Ma∣labars</HI>
from the King's, and on <HI>Friday</HI> about Nine
or Ten in the Morning, came among the Inhabi∣tants,
of whom they were as much afraid as of
the <HI>Chiangulays</HI> before; for tho' the <HI>Wanniounay,</HI> or
Prince of this People, payeth Tribute to the
<HI>Dutch</HI> out of Fear, yet he is better affected to the
King of <HI>Candi,</HI> and if he had took them, would
have sent them up to their old Master; but not
knowing any Way to escape, they kept on their
Journey by the River Side by Day, because the
Woods were not to be travell'd by Night, for
Thorns and wild Beasts, who came down then to
the River to drink. In all the <HI>Malabars</HI> Country
they met with only two Bramans, who treated
them civilly, and for their Money one of them
conducted them till they came into the Territories
of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and out of all Danger from the King
of <HI>Candi,</HI> which did not a little rejoice them; but
yet they were in no small Trouble how to find the
Way out of the Woods, till a <HI>Malabar</HI> for the Lu∣cre
of a Knife, conducted them to a <HI>Dutch</HI> Town,
where they found Guides to conduct them from
Town to Town, till they came to the Fort called
<HI>Arepa,</HI> where they arrived <HI>Saturday, October</HI> 18.
1679, and there thankfully ador'd God's wonder∣ful
Providence, in thus compleating their Deli∣verance
from a long Captivity of Nineteen Years
and six Months.</P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="325"/>
I come now back to my own History, which
draws near a Conclusion, as to the Travels
I took in this Part of the World. We were now
at Sea, and we stood away to the North for a
while, to try if we could get a Market for
our Spice, for we were very rich in Nutmegs,
but we ill knew what to do with them; we durst
not go upon the <HI>English</HI> Coast, or, to speak
more properly, among the <HI>English</HI> Factories to
Trade; not that we were afraid to fight any two
Ships they had; and besides that, we knew,
that as they had no Letters of Mart or of Re∣prisals
from the Government, so it was none
of their Business to act offensively, no not tho'
we were Pyrates. Indeed if we had made any
Attempt upon them, they might have justify'd
themselves in joining together to resist, and
assisting one another to defend themselves; but
to go out of their Business to attack a Pyrate
Ship of almost fifty Guns, as we were, it was
plain, that it was none of their Business, and
consequently it was none of our Concern, so we
did not trouble our selves about it; but, on the
other Hand, it was none of our Business to be
seen among them, and to have the News of us
carried from one Factory to another: So that
whatever Design we might be upon at another
Time, we should be sure to be prevented and dis∣covered:
Much less had we any Occasion to be
seen among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Factories, upon the Coast
of <HI>Malabar;</HI> for, being fully loaden with the Spi∣ces
which we had in the Sense of their Trade
plundered them of, it would soon have told them
what we were, and all that we had been doing,
and they would, no doubt, have concerned them∣selves
all manner of Ways to have fallen upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="326"/>
The only Way we had for it was to stand away for
<HI>Goa,</HI> and Trade, if we could, for our Spices with the
<HI>Portuguese</HI> Factory there. Accordingly we sailed
almost thither, for we had made Land two Days
before, and, being in the Latitude of <HI>Goa,</HI> were
standing in fair for <HI>Marmagoon,</HI> on the Head of <HI>Sal∣sat,</HI>
at the going up to <HI>Goa,</HI> when I called to the Man
at the Helm to bring the Ship to, and bid the Pilot
go away N. N. W. till we came out of Sight of the
Shore; when <HI>William</HI> and I called a Council as we
used to do upon Emergences, what Course we
should take to trade there, and not be discovered;
and we concluded, at length, that we would not
go thither at all; but that <HI>William,</HI> with such
trusty Fellows only as could be depended upon,
should go in the Sloop to <HI>Surat,</HI> which was still
farther Northward, and trade there as Mer∣chants,
with such of the <HI>English</HI> Factory as they
could find to be for their Turn.</P>
<P>To carry this with the more Caution, and so
as not to be suspected, we agreed to take out all
her Guns, and to put such Men into her, and
no other, as would promise us not to desire or
offer to go on Shore, or to enter into any Talk
or Conversation with any that might come on
board: And to finish the Disguise to our Mind,
<HI>William</HI> documented two of our Men, one a Sur∣geon,
as he himself was, and the other a ready-witted
Fellow, an old Sailor, that had been a
Pilot upon the Coast of <HI>New-England,</HI> and was
an excellent Mimick; these two <HI>William</HI> dressed
up like two Quakers, and made them talk like
such. The old Pilot he made go Captain of the
Sloop, and the Surgeon for Doctor, as he was,
and himself Super-Cargo: In this Figure, and
the Sloop all plain, no curled Work upon her,
<PB N="309" REF="327"/>
indeed she had not much before, and no Guns
to be seen, away he went for <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>I should indeed have observed, that we went,
some Days before we parted, to a small sandy
Island, close under the Shore, where there was
a good Cove of deep Water, like a Road, and
out of Sight of any of the Factories, which are
here very thick upon the Coast. Here we shift∣ed
the Loading of the Sloop, and put into her
such Things only as we had a mind to dis∣pose
of there, which was indeed little but Nut∣megs
and Cloves, but chiefly the former; and
from thence <HI>William</HI> and his two Quakers, with
about eighteen Men in the Sloop, went away to
<HI>Surat,</HI> and came to an Anchor at a Distance from
the Factory.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> used such Caution, that he fond
Means to go on Shore himself, and the Doctor, as
he called him, in a Boat, which came on board
them to sell Fish, rowed with only <HI>Indians</HI> of the
Country, which Boat he afterwards hired to
carry him on board again. It was not long
that they were on Shore, but that they found
Means to get Acquaintance with some <HI>English∣men,</HI>
who though they lived there, and per∣haps,
were the Company's Servants at first,
yet appeared then to be Traders for themselves,
in whatever Coast-Business especially came in
their Way, and the Doctor was made the first
to pick Acquaintance; so he recommended his
Friend, the Super-Cargo, till, by Degrees, the
Merchants were as found of the Bargain as our
Men were of the Merchants, only that the Cargo
was a little too much for them.</P>
<P>However, this did not prove a Difficulty long
with them; for the next Day they brought two
<PB N="310" REF="328"/>
more Merchants, <HI>English</HI> also, into their Bargain;
and, as <HI>William</HI> could perceive by their Dis∣corse,
they resolved, if they bought them,
to carry them to the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI> upon their
own Accounts; <HI>William</HI> took the Hint, and, as
he told me afterwards, concluded we might
carry them there as well as they; but this was
not <HI>William</HI>'s present Business; he had here no less
than three and thirty Ton of Nuts, and eighteen
Ton of Cloves. There was a good Quantity of
Mace among the Nutmegs; but we did not
stand to make much Allowance. In short, they
bargained, and the Merchants, who would
gladly have bought Sloop and all, gave <HI>William</HI>
Directions, and two Men for Pilots, to go to a
Creek about six Leagues from the Factory,
where they brought Boats, and unloaded the
whole Cargo, and paid <HI>William</HI> very honestly
for it. The whole Parcel amounting, in Money,
to about thirty five thousand Pieces of Eight,
besides some Goods of Value, which <HI>William</HI> was
content to take, and two large Diamonds worth
about three Hundred Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>When they paid the Money, <HI>William</HI> invited
them on board the Sloop, where they came, and
the merry old Quaker diverted them exceeding∣ly
with his Talk, and <HI>Thee'd</HI> 'em, and <HI>Thou'd</HI> 'em,
till he made 'em so drunk, that they could not go
on Shore for that Night.</P>
<P>They would fain have known who our People
were, and whence they came, but not a Man in
the Sloop would answer them to any Question
they ask'd, but in such a Manner as let them
think themselves banter'd and jested with. How∣ever,
in Discourse, <HI>William</HI> said, they were able
Men for any Cargo we could have brought them,
<PB N="311" REF="329"/>
and that they would have bought twice as much
Spice if we had had it. He ordered the merry
Captain to tell them, that they had another
Sloop that lay at <HI>Marmagoon,</HI> and that had a great
Quantity of Spice on board also; and that if it
was not sold when he went back, for that thither
he was bound, he would bring her up.</P>
<P>Their new Chaps were so eager, that they
would have bargain'd with the old Captain be∣fore-hand:
Nay Friend, <HI>said he,</HI> I will not trade
with thee unsight and unseen; neither do I know
whether the Master of the Sloop may not have
sold his Loading already to some Merchants of
<HI>Salset;</HI> but if he has not, when I come to him, I
think to bring him up to thee.</P>
<P>The Doctor had his Employment all this
while, as well as <HI>William</HI> and the old Captain; for
he went on shore several Times a Day in the <HI>In∣dian</HI>
Boat, and brought fresh Provisions for the
Sloop, which the Men had need enough of; he
brought in particularly seventeen large Casks of
Arrack, as big as Buts, besides smaller Quantities,
a Quantity of Rice, and Abundance of Fruits,
Mangoes, Pompions, and such Things, with
Fowls and Fish. He never came on board but
he was deep laden; for, in short, he bought for
the Ship, as well as for themselves; and particu∣ly,
they half loaded the Ship with Rice and Ar∣rack,
with some Hogs, and six or seven Cows, a∣live;
and thus being well victualled, and having
Directions for coming again, they returned
to us.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was always the lucky welcome Messen∣ger
to us, but never more welcome to us than
now; for where we had thrust in the Ship we could
get nothing, except a few Mangoes and Roots,
<PB N="312" REF="330"/>
being not willing to make any Steps into the
Country, or make our selves known, till we had
News of our Sloop; and indeed our Mens Pa∣tience
was almost tired, for it was seventeen
Days that <HI>William</HI> spent upon this Enterprize,
and well bestow'd too.</P>
<P>When he came back, we had another Confe∣rence
upon the Subject of Trade, namely, whe∣ther
we should send the rest of our Spices, and
other Goods we had in the Ship, to <HI>Surat;</HI> or,
whether we should go up to the Gulph of <HI>Persia</HI>
our selves, where it was probable we might sell
them as well as the <HI>English</HI> Merchants of <HI>Surat.
William</HI> was for going our selves, which, by the
Way, was from the good frugal Merchant-like
Temper of the Man, who was for the best of
every Thing: But here I over-ruled <HI>William,</HI>
which I very seldom took upon me to do; but I
told him, that, considering our Circumstances, it
was much better for us to sell all our Cargoe
here, though we made but half Price of them,
than to go with them to the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI>
where we should run a greater Risque, and where
People would be much more curious and inquisi∣tive
into Things than they were here, and where
it would not be so easy to manage them, seeing
they traded freely and openly there, not by
Stealth, as those Men seemed to do; and besides,
if they suspected any Thing, it would be much
more difficult for us to retreat, except by meer
Force, than here, where we were upon the
high Sea, as it were, and could be gone when∣ever
we pleased, without any Disguise, or indeed
without the least Appearance of being pursued,
none knowing where to look for us.</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="331"/>
My Apprehensions prevailed with <HI>William,</HI>
whether my Reasons did or no, and he submit∣ted;
and we resolved to try another Ship's Load∣ing
to the same Merchants; the main Business
was to consider how to get off of that Circum∣stance
had exposed them with the <HI>English</HI> Mer∣chants;
namely, that it was our other Sloop;
but this the old Quaker Pilot undertook; for
being, as I said, and excellent Mimick himself, it
was the easier for him to dress up the Sloop in
new Clothes; and first he put on all the carved
Work he had taken off before; her Stern, which
was painted of a dumb white, or dun Colour, be∣fore
all flat, was now all lacquer'd, and blue,
and I know not how many gay Figures in it; as
to her Quarter, the Carpenters made her a neat
little Gallery on either Side; she had 12 Guns
put into her, and some Patereroes upon her Gun∣nel,
none of which were there before; and to
finish her new Habit or Appearance, and make
her Change compleat, he ordered her Sails to be
alter'd; and as she sailed before with a Half-Sprit,
like a Yacht, she sailed now with square
Sail and Mizen Mast, like a Ketch; so that, in a
Word, she was a perfect Cheat, disguised in e∣very
Thing that a Stranger could be supposed to
take any Notice of, that had never had but one
View; for they had been but once on board.</P>
<P>In this mean Figure the Sloop returned; she
had a new Man put into her for Captain, one we
knew how to trust; and the old Pilot appearing
only as a Passenger, the Doctor and <HI>William</HI>
acting as the Super-Cargoes, by a formal Procu∣ration
from one Captain <HI>Singleton,</HI> and all Things
ordered in Form,</P>
<P><PB N="314" REF="332"/>
We had a compleat Loading for the Sloop;
for besides a very great Quantity of Nutmegs
and Cloves, Mace, and some Cinnamon, she had
on board some Goods, which we took in as we
lay about the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands, while we waited
as looking for Purchase.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> made no Difficulty of selling this Car∣goe
also, and in about twenty Days returned
again, freighted with all necessary Provisions for
our Voyage, and for a long Time; and, as I say,
we had a great deal of other Goods, he brought
us back about three and thirty thousand Pieces
of Eight, and some Diamonds; which, tho' <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
did not pretend to much Skill in, yet he
made shift to act, so as not to be imposed upon,
the Merchants he had to deal with too being
very fair Men.</P>
<P>They had no Difficulty at all with these Mer∣chants;
for the Prospect they had of Gain made
them not at all inquisitive; nor did they make
the least Discovery of the Sloop; and as to the
Selling them Spices which were fetch'd so far
from thence, it seems it was not so much a No∣velty
there as we believed; for the <HI>Portugueze</HI>
had frequently Vessels which came from <HI>Macao</HI>
in <HI>China,</HI> who brought Spices, which they bought
of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Traders, who again frequently
dealt among the <HI>Dutch</HI> Spice Islands, and re∣ceived
Spices in Exchange for such Goods as they
carried from <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>This might be called indeed the only trading
Voyage we had made; and now we were really
very rich; and it came now naturally before us
to consider whither we should go next; our pro∣per
Delivery Port, as we ought to have called it,
was at <HI>Madagascar,</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Mangahelly:</HI> But
<PB N="315" REF="333"/>
<HI>William</HI> took me by my self into the Cabbin of
the Sloop one Day, and told me, he wanted to
talk seriously with me a little; so we shut our
selves in, and <HI>William</HI> began with me.</P>
<P>Wilt thou give me Leave, <HI>says William,</HI> to talk
plainly with thee upon thy present Circumstan∣ces,
and the future Prospect of living, and wilt
thou promise on thy Word to take nothing
ill of me.</P>
<P>With all my Heart, <HI>said I, William,</HI> I have al∣ways
found your Advice good, and your Designs
have not only been well laid, but your Counsel
has been very lucky to us; and therefore say
what you will, I promise you I will not take
it ill.</P>
<P>But that is not all my Demand, <HI>says William,</HI> if
thou dost not like what I am going to propose to
thee, thou shalt promise me not to make it pub∣lick
among the Men.</P>
<P>I will not, <HI>William, says I,</HI> upon my Word, and
swore to him too very heartily.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>says William,</HI> I have but one Thing
more to article with thee about, and that is,
that thou wilt consent, that if thou dost not ap∣prove
of it for thy self, thou wilt yet consent
that I shall put so much of it in Practice as re∣lates
to my self, and my new Comrade <HI>Doctor,</HI>
so that it be in nothing to thy Detriment and
Loss.</P>
<P>In any Thing, <HI>says I, William,</HI> but leaving
me, I will; but I cannot part with you upon any
Terms whatever.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says William,</HI> I am not designing to part
from thee, unless it is thy own Doing; but assure
me in all these Points; and I will tell my Mind
freely.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="334"/>
So I promised him every Thing he desired of
me in the solemnest Manner possible, and so seri∣ously
and frankly withal, that <HI>William</HI> made no
Scruple to open his Mind to me.</P>
<P>Why then, in the first Place, <HI>says William,</HI> shall
I ask thee if thou dost not think thou and all thy
Men are rich enough, and have really gotten as
much Wealth together (by whatsover Way it
has been gotten, that is not the Question) as ye
all know what to do with?</P>
<P>Why truly <HI>William, said I,</HI> thou art pretty
right, I think we have had pretty good
Luck.</P>
<P>Well then, <HI>says William,</HI> I would ask, whether,
if thou hast gotten enough, thou hast any
Thought of leaving off this Trade; for most Peo∣ple
leave off Trading when they are satisfied
with getting, and are rich enough; for no body
trades for the sake of Trading, much less do any
Men rob for the sake of Thieving.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William, says I,</HI> now I perceive what it is
thou art driving at; I warrant you, <HI>says I,</HI> you
begin to hanker after Home.</P>
<P>Why truly, <HI>says William,</HI> thou hast said it,
and so I hope thou dost too; it is natural for most
Men that are abroad to desire to come Home
again at last, especially when they are grown rich,
and when they are (as thou ownest thy self to be)
rich enough, and so rich, as they know not what
to do with more if they had it.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William, said I,</HI> but now you think
you have laid your Preliminary at first so
home, that I should have nothing to say; that
is, that when I had got Money enough, it would
be natural to think of going Home; but you
have not explained what you mean by Home,
<PB N="317" REF="335"/>
and there you and I shall differ. Why, Man, I
am at Home, here is my Habitation, I never had
any other in my Life time; I was a kind of Cha∣rity
School-Boy, so that I can have no Desire of
going any where for being rich or poor, for I
have no where to go.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says William,</HI> looking a little confused, art
not thou an <HI>Englishman?</HI> Yes, <HI>says I,</HI> I think so, you
see I speak <HI>English;</HI> but I came out of <HI>England</HI> a
Child, and never was in it but once since I was a
Man, and then I was cheated and imposed upon,
and used so ill, that I care not if I never see it
more.</P>
<P>Why hast thou no Relations or Friends there,
<HI>says he,</HI> no Acquaintance, none that thou hast
any Kindness for, or any remains of Respect
for?</P>
<P>Not I, <HI>William, said I,</HI> not one, no more than
I have in the Court of the Great <HI>Mogul.</HI></P>
<P>Nor any Kindness for the Country, where
thou wast born, <HI>says William.</HI></P>
<P>Not I, any more than for the Island of <HI>Mada∣gascar,</HI>
nor so much neither, for that has been a
fortunate Island to me more than once, as thou
knowest, <HI>William, said I.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William</HI> was quite stunn'd at my Discourse, and
held his Peace; and <HI>I said to him,</HI> go on, <HI>William,</HI>
what hast thou to say farther? For I hear you
have some Project in your Head, <HI>says he,</HI> come,
let's have it out.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says William,</HI> thou hast put me to Silence,
and all I had to say is over-thrown; all my Pro∣jects
are come to nothing, and gone.</P>
<P>Well, but <HI>William, said I,</HI> let me hear what
they were, for tho' it is so that what I have to
aim at does not look your Way; and tho' I have
<PB N="318" REF="336"/>
no Relation, no Friend, no Acquaintance in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
yet I do not say I like this roving, cruising
Life, so well as never to give it over: Let me
hear if thou canst propose to me any thing be∣yond
it.</P>
<P>Certainly Friend, <HI>says William,</HI> very gravely,
there is something beyond it, and lifting up his
Hands, he seemed very much affected, and I
thought I see Tears stand in his Eyes, but I, that
was too hardned a Wretch to be moved with these
Things, laughed at him; what, <HI>says I,</HI> you
mean <HI>Death,</HI> I warrant you, don't you, that is
beyond this Trade; why, when it comes, it
comes, then we are all provided for.</P>
<P>Ay, <HI>says William,</HI> that is true; but it wou'd be
better that some Things were thought on before
that came.</P>
<P>Thought on, <HI>says I,</HI> what signifies thinking of
it; to think of Death, is to dye; and to be al∣ways
thinking of it, is to be all one's Life-long a
dying; 'tis Time enough to think of it when it
comes.</P>
<P>You will easily believe I was well qualified for
a Pirate that could talk thus; but let me leave it
upon Record for the Remark of other hardned
Rogues like my self. My Conscience gave me a
Pang that I had never felt before, when I said,
<HI>What signifies thinking of it,</HI> and told me, I shou'd
one Day think of these Words with a sad Heart,
but the Time of my Reflection was not yet
come; so I went on.</P>
<P><HI>Says William,</HI> very seriously, I must tell thee,
Friend, I am sorry to hear thee talk so; they that
never think of dying, often dye without think∣ing
of it.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="337"/>
I carried on the jesting Way a while farther,
<HI>and said,</HI> prithee do not talk of dying; how do
we know we shall ever dye, and began to laugh?</P>
<P>I need not answer thee to that, <HI>says William,</HI> it
is not my Place to reprove thee who art Comman∣der
over me here, but I had rather thou wouldst
talk otherwise of Death; 'tis a coarse Thing.</P>
<P>Say any Thing to me, <HI>William, said I,</HI> I will take
it kindly: <HI>I began now to be very much moved at his
Discourse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Says William,</HI> Tears running down his Face, it
is because Men live as if they were never to dye,
that so many dye before they know how to live;
but it was not Death that I meant, when I said,
<HI>That there was something to be thought of beyond this
Way of Living.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>William, said I,</HI> what was that?</P>
<P>It was <HI>Repentance, says he.</HI></P>
<P>Why, <HI>says I,</HI> did you ever know a Pirate re∣pent?</P>
<P>At this he started a little, and return'd, at the
Gallows, I have one before, and I hope thou wilt
be the second.</P>
<P>He spoke this very affectionately, and with an
Appearance of Concern for me.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>William, says I,</HI> I thank you, and I am
not so senseless of these Things, perhaps, as I
make my self seem to be; but come, let me hear
your Proposal.</P>
<P>My Proposal, <HI>says William,</HI> is for thy Good, as
well as my own; we may put an End to this kind
of Life, and repent; and I think the fairest Oc∣casion
offers for both at this very Time that
ever did, or ever will, or indeed, can happen
again.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="338"/>
Look you, <HI>William, says I,</HI> let me have your
Proposal for putting an End to our present Way
of Living first, for that is the Case before us,
and you and I will talk of the other afterward.
I am not so insensible, <HI>said I,</HI> as you may think
me to be; but let us get out of this hellish Con∣dition
we are in first.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says William,</HI> thou art in the right there;
we must never talk of repenting while we con∣tinue
Pirates.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says I, William,</HI> that's what I meant, for
if we must not reform, as well as be sorry for
what's done, I have no Notion what Repentance
means; indeed, at best I know little of the Mat∣ter;
but the Nature of the thing seems to tell
me, that the first Step we have to take, is to
break off this wretched Course, and I'll begin
there with you with all my Heart.</P>
<P>I could see by his Countenance, that <HI>William</HI>
was throughly pleased with the Offer; and if he
had Tears in his Eyes before, he had more now,
but it was from a quite differing Passion, for he
was so swallow'd up with Joy, he could not
speak.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>William, says I,</HI> thou shewest me plain
enough thou hast an honest Meaning. Dost thou
think 'tis practicable for us to put an End to our
unhappy Way of Living here, and get off?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>says he,</HI> I think 'tis very practicable for
me, whether 'tis for thee or no, that will depend
upon thy self.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says I,</HI> I give you my Word, that as I
have commanded you all along, from the Time I
first took you on Board, so you shall command me
from this Hour; and every thing you direct me,
I'll do.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="339"/>
Wilt thou leave it all to me? Dost thou say
this freely?</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>William, says I,</HI> freely, and I'll perform it
faithfully.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>says William,</HI> my Scheme is this,
we are now at the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Persia,</HI>
we have sold so much of our Cargo here at <HI>Surat,</HI>
that we have Money enough; send me away for
<HI>Bassora</HI> with the Sloop, loaden with the <HI>China</HI>
Goods we have on Board, which will make ano∣ther
good Cargo; and I'll warrant thee I'll find
Means among the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants
there, to lodge a Quantity of Goods and Money
also <HI>as a Merchant,</HI> so as we will be able to have
Recourse to it again upon any Occasion, and
when I come Home we will contrive the rest;
and in the mean Time do you bring the Ship's
Crew to take a Resolution to go to <HI>Madagascar,</HI>
as soon as I return.</P>
<P>I told him, I thought he need not go so far as
<HI>Bassora,</HI> but might run into <HI>Gombaroon,</HI> or to <HI>Or∣mus,</HI>
and pretend the same Business.</P>
<P>No, <HI>says he,</HI> I cannot act with the same Free∣dom
there, because the Company's Factory are
there, and I may be laid hold of there on Pre∣tence
of Interloping.</P>
<P>Well, but, <HI>said I,</HI> you may go to <HI>Ormus</HI> then,
for I am loath to part with you so long as to go to
the Bottom of the <HI>Persian</HI> Gulph. He return'd
that I should leave it to him to do as he should
see Cause.</P>
<P>We had taken a large Sum of Money at <HI>Surat;</HI>
so that we had near a hundred thousand Pounds
in Money at our Command; but on board the
great Ship we had still a great deal more.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="340"/>
I ordered him publickly to keep the Money on
board which he had, and to buy up with it a
Quantity of Ammunition if he could get it, and
so to furnish us for new Exploits; and in the
mean Time I resolved to get a Quantity of Gold
and some Jewels, which I had on board the
great Ship, and place them so, that I might car∣ry
them off without Notice, as soon as he came
back; and so according to <HI>William</HI>'s Directions, I
left him to go the Voyage, and I went on board
the great Ship, in which we had indeed an im∣mense
Treasure.</P>
<P>We waited no less than two Months, for <HI>Willi∣am</HI>'s
Return; and indeed I began to be very
uneasy about <HI>William,</HI> sometimes thinking he had
abandoned me, and that he might have used the
same Artifice to have engaged the other Men to
comply with him, and so they were gone away
together; and it was but three Days before his
Return, that I was just upon the Point of resol∣ving
to go away to <HI>Madagascar,</HI> and give him
over; but the old Surgeon, who mimicked the
Quaker, and passed for the Master of the Sloop
at <HI>Surat,</HI> perswaded me against that; for which
good Advice, and his apparent Faithfulness in
what he had been trusted with, I made him a
Party to my Design, and he proved very
honest.</P>
<P>At length <HI>William</HI> came back, to our inexpres∣sible
Joy, and brought a great many necessary
Things with him; as particularly, he brought
sixty Barrels of Powder, some Iron Shot, and a∣bout
thirty Ton of Lead; also he brought a
great deal of Provisions; and in a Word, <HI>William</HI>
gave me a publick Account of his Voyage, in the
Hearing of whoever happened to be upon the
<PB N="323" REF="341"/>
Quarter-Deck, that no Suspicions might be
found about us.</P>
<P>After all was done, <HI>William</HI> moved, that he
might go up again, and that I would go with
him; named several Things which we had on
board that he could not sell there, and particu∣larly
told us, he had been obliged to leave seve∣ral
Things there, the Caravans being not come
in; and that he had ingaged to come back again
with Goods.</P>
<P>This was what I wanted; the Men were eager
for his Going, and particularly because he told
them they might load the Sloop back with
Rice and Provisions: But I seemed backward to
going; when the old Surgeon stood up, and per∣swaded
me to go, and with many Arguments
pressed me to it; as particularly, if I did not go,
there would be no Order, and several of the
Men might drop away, and perhaps betray all
the rest; and that they should not think it safe
for the Sloop to go again, if I did not go; and
to urge me to it, he offered himself to go
with me.</P>
<P>Upon these Considerations I seemed to be over∣perswaded
to go; and all the Company seemed
the better satisfied when I had consented: And
accordingly we took all the Powder, Lead, and
Iron out of the Sloop into the great Ship, and
all the other Things that were for the Ship's
Use, and put in some Bales of Spices, and Casks
or Frailes of Cloves, in all about seven Ton, and
some other Goods, among the Bales of which I
had convey'd all my private Treasure, which, I
assure you, was of no small Value; and away
I went.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="342"/>
At going off, I called a Council of all the Offi∣cers
in the Ship, to consider in what Place they
should wait for me, and how long, where we ap∣pointed
the Ship to stay eight and twenty Days,
at a little Island on the <HI>Arabian</HI> Side of the Gulph;
and that if the Sloop did not come in that Time,
they should sail to another Island to the West of
that Place, and wait there fifteen Days more;
and that then if the Sloop did not come, they
should conclude some Accident must have hap∣pened,
and the Rendezvous should be at <HI>Ma∣dagascar.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus resolved, we left the Ship, which
both <HI>William,</HI> and I, and the Surgeon never in∣rended
to see any more: We steered directly
for the Gulph, and through to <HI>Bassaro,</HI> or <HI>Balsara.</HI>
This City of <HI>Balsara</HI> lies at some Distance from
the Place where our Sloop lay, and the River
not being very safe, and we but ill acquainted
with it, having but an ordinary Pilot, we went
on Shore at a Village where some Merchants live,
and which is very populous, for the sake of small
Vessels riding there.</P>
<P>Here we stay'd, and traded three or four
Days, landing all our Bales and Spices, and in∣deed
the whole Cargoe, that was of any conside∣rable
Value; which we chose to do rather than
go up immediately to <HI>Balsara,</HI> till the Project
we had laid was put in Execution.</P>
<P>After we had bought several Goods, and were
preparing to buy several others, the Boat being
on Shore with twelve Men, my self, <HI>William,</HI> the
Surgeon, and one Fourth Man, whom we had
singled out, we contrived to send a <HI>Turk,</HI> just at
the Dusk of the Evening, with a Letter to the
Boatswain; and giving the Fellow a Charge to
<PB N="325" REF="343"/>
run with all possible Speed, we stood at a small
Distance to observe the Event. The Contents
of the Letter were thus written by the old
Doctor.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>“Boatswain <HI>Thomas,</HI>”</OPENER>
<P>“WE are all betray'd; for God's Sake
make off with the Boat, and get on
board, or you are all lost. The Captain, <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
the Quaker, and <HI>George</HI> the Reformade are
seized and carried away; I am escaped and hid,
but cannot stir out; If I do I am a dead Man:
As soon as you are on board, cut or slip, and
make Sail for your Lives.”</P>
<CLOSER>“Adieu.”
<SIGNED>R. S.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>We stood undiscovered, as above, it being
the Dusk of the Evening, and saw the <HI>Turk</HI> deli∣ver
the Letters; and in three Minutes we saw
all the Men hurry into the Boat, and put off;
and no sooner were they on board, but they
took the Hint, as we supposed; for the next
Morning they were out of Sight; and we
never heard Tale or Tidings of them since.</P>
<P>We were now in a good Place, and in very
good Circumstances, for we past for Mer∣chants
of <HI>Persia.</HI></P>
<P>It is not material to record here what a
Mass of ill-gotten Wealth we had got together:
It will be more to the Purpose to tell you, that I
began to be sensible of the Crime of getting of it
in such a Manner as I had done, that I had very
little Satisfaction in the Possession of it; and, as
I told <HI>William,</HI> I had no Expectation of keeping it,
<PB N="326" REF="344"/>
nor much Desire; but as I said to him one Day
walking out into the Fields near the Town at
<HI>Bassaro,</HI> so I depended upon it, that it would be
the Case, which you will hear presently.</P>
<P>We were perfectly secured at <HI>Bassaro,</HI> by ha∣ving
frighted away the Rogues, our Comrades;
and we had nothing to do but to consider how to
vert our Treasure in Things proper to make us
look like Merchants, as we were now to be,
and not like Free-booters, as we really had
been.</P>
<P>We happened very opportunely here upon
a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> who had travelled from <HI>Bengal</HI> to
<HI>Agra,</HI> the Capital City of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and
from thence was come to the Coast of <HI>Malabar</HI> by
Land, and got Shipping some how or other up
the Gulph; and we found his Design was to go
up the great River to <HI>Bagdat</HI> or <HI>Babylon;</HI> and so
by the Caravan to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon.</HI> As <HI>Willi∣am</HI>
spoke <HI>Dutch,</HI> and was of an agreeable insinua∣ting
Behaviour, he soon got acquainted with this
<HI>Dutchman,</HI> and discovering our Circumstances to
one another, we found he had considerable Effects
with him; and that he had traded long in that
Country, and was making homeward to his own
Country; and that he had Servants with him,
one an <HI>Armenian,</HI> whom he had taught to speak
<HI>Dutch,</HI> and who had something of his own, but
had a Mind to travel into <HI>Europe;</HI> and the other
a <HI>Dutch</HI> Sailor, whom he had picked up by his Fan∣cy,
and reposed a great Trust in him, and a very
honest Fellow he was.</P>
<P>This <HI>Dutchman</HI> was very glad of an Acquain∣tance,
because he soon found that we direct∣ed
our Thoughts to <HI>Europe</HI> also, and as he
found we were encumber'd with Goods only,
<PB N="327" REF="345"/>
for we let him know nothing of our Money, he
readily offer'd us his Assistance, to dispose of as
many of them as the Place we were in would put
off, and his Advice what to do with the rest.</P>
<P>While this was doing, <HI>William</HI> and I consulted
what to do with our selves, and what we had;
and first we resolved we would never talk seriously
of any of our Measures, but in the open Fields,
where we were sure no Body could hear; so every
Evening, when the Sun began to decline, and the
Air to be moderate, we walk'd out sometimes
this Way, sometimes that, to consult of our Af∣fairs.</P>
<P>I should have observed, that we had new
cloathed our selves here after the <HI>Persian</HI> Manner,
in long Vests of Silk, a Gown or Robe of <HI>English</HI>
Crimson Cloth, very fine and handsome, and had
let our Beards grow so after the <HI>Persian</HI> Manner,
that we past for <HI>Persian</HI> Merchants, in View only,
tho', <HI>by the Way,</HI> we could not understand or speak
one Word of the Language of <HI>Persia,</HI> or indeed
of any other but <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and of the
latter I understood very little.</P>
<P>However, the <HI>Dutchman</HI> supply'd all this for
us, and as we had resolved to keep our selves as
retired as we could, though there were several
<HI>English</HI> Merchants upon the Place, yet we never
acquainted our selves with one of them, or ex∣changed
a Word with them, by which Means we
prevented their Enquiry of us now, or their
giving any Intelligence of us, if any News of
our Landing here should happen to come, which it
was easy for us to know, was possible enough, if
any of our Comrades fell into bad Hands, or by
many Accidents which we could not foresee.</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="346"/>
It was during my being here, for here we
stay'd near two Months, that I grew very thought∣ful
about my Circumstances, not as to the Dan∣ger,
neither indeed were we in any, but were
entirely conceal'd and unsuspected; but I really
began to have other Thoughts of my self, and of
the World, than ever I had before.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> had struck so deep into my unthinking
Temper, with hinting to me, that there was
something beyond all this, that the present Time
was the Time of Enjoyment, but that the Time
of Account approached; that the Work that re∣main'd
was gentler than the Labour past, <HI>viz.
Repentance,</HI> and that it was high Time to think of
it; I say these, and such Thoughts as these, en∣gross'd
my Hours, and in a Word, I grew very
sad.</P>
<P>As to the Wealth I had, which was immensely
great, it was all like Dirt under my Feet; I had
no Value for it, no Peace in the Possession of it,
no great Concern about me for the leaving of it.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> had perceiv'd my Thoughts to be
troubled, and my Mind heavy and opprest for
some Time; and one Evening, in one of our cool
Walks, I began with him about the leaving our
Effects. <HI>William</HI> was a wise and wary Man, and
indeed all the Prudentials of my Conduct, had
for a long Time been owing to his Advice, and so
now all the Methods for preserving our Effects,
and even our selves lay upon him; and he had
been telling me of some of the Measures he had
been taking for our making homeward, and for
the Security of our Wealth, when I took him
very short. <HI>Why, William,</HI> says I, <HI>dost thou think
we shall ever be able to reach</HI> Europe <HI>with all this Cargo
that we have about us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="347"/>
Ay, <HI>says William,</HI> without doubt, as well as other
Merchants with theirs, as long as it is not pub∣lickly
known what Quantity, or of what Value
our Cargo consists.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>William, says I,</HI> smiling, do you think
that if there is a <HI>God above,</HI> as you have so long
been telling me there is, and that we must give an
Account to him? I say, Do you think if he be
a righteous Judge, he will let us escape thus with
the Plunder, as we may call it, of so many inno∣cent
People, nay, I might say Nations, and not
call us to an Account for it before we can get to
<HI>Europe,</HI> where we pretend to enjoy it?</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> appeared struck and surprized at the
Question, and made no Answer for a great while,
and I repeated the Question, adding, that it was
not to be expected.</P>
<P>After a little Pause, <HI>says William,</HI> Thou hast
started a very weighty Question, and I can make
no positive Answer to it, but I will state it thus;
first, it is Time, that if we consider the Justice of
God, we have no Reason to expect any Protection,
but as the ordinary Ways of Providence are out
of the common Road of human Affairs, so we may
hope for Mercy still upon our Repentance, and
we know not how good he may be to us; so we
are to act as if we rather depended upon the last,
I mean the merciful Part, than claimed the
first, which must produce nothing but Judgment
and Vengeance.</P>
<P>But hark ye, <HI>William, says I,</HI> the Nature of Re∣pentance,
as you hinted once to me, included
Reformation, and we can never reform; how
then can we repent?</P>
<P>Why, can we never reform, <HI>says William?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="348"/>
Because, <HI>said I,</HI> we cannot restore what we
have taken away by Rapine and Spoil.</P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>says William,</HI> we can never do that,
for we can never come to the Knowledge of the
Owners<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>But what then must be done with our Wealth,
<HI>said I,</HI> The Effects of Plunder and Rapine? If we
keep it, we continue to be Robbers and Thieves,
and if we quit it, we cannot do Justice with it,
for we cannot restore it to the right Owners?</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>says William,</HI> the Answer to it is short;
to quit what we have, and do it here, is to throw
it away to those who have no Claim to it, and to
divest our selves of it, but to do no Right with
it; whereas we ought to keep it carefully toge∣ther,
with a Resolution to do what Right with it
we are able; and who knows what Opportunity
Providence may put into our Hands, to do Justice
at least to some of those we have injured, so we
ought at least to leave it to him, and go on, as it
is, without doubt, our present Business to do, to
some Place of Safety, where we may wait his
Will.</P>
<P>This Refolution of <HI>William</HI> was very satisfying
to me indeed, as, the Truth is, all he said, and at
all Times, was solid and good; and had not <HI>Wil∣liam</HI>
thus, as it were, quieted my Mind, I think
verily I was so alarmed at the just Reason I had to
expect Vengeance from Heaven upon me for my
ill-gotten Wealth, that I should have run away
from it as the Devil's Goods; that I had nothing
to do with that did not belong to me, and that I
had no Right to keep, and was in certain Danger
of being destroy'd for.</P>
<P>However, <HI>William</HI> settled my Mind to more
prudent Steps than these, and I concluded that I
<PB N="331" REF="349"/>
ought, however, to proceed to a Place of Safety,
and leave the Event to God Almighty's Mercy;
but this I must leave upon Record, that I had
from this Time no Joy of the Wealth I had got;
I look'd upon it all as a stolen, and so indeed the
greatest Part of it was; I look'd upon it as a
Hoard of other Mens Goods, which I had robbed
the innocent Owners of, and which I ought, in a
Word, to be hanged for here, and damned for
hereafter; and now indeed I began sincerely to
hate my self for a Dog, a Wretch that had been
a Thief, and a Murtherer; a Wretch, that was
in a Condition which no Body was ever in; for I
had robb'd, and tho' I had the Wealth by me,
yet it was impossible I should ever make any
Restitution; and upon this Account it run in my
Head, that I could never repent, for that Re∣pentance
could not be sincere without Restituti∣on,
and therefore I must of Necessity be damned,
there was no room for me to escape: I went about
with my Heart full of these Thoughts, little bet∣ter
than a distracted Fellow; in short, running
headlong into the dreadfullest Despair, and pre∣meditated
nothing but how to rid my self out of
the World; and indeed the Devil, if such Things
are of the Devil's immediate doing, followed his
Work very close with me, and nothing lay upon
my Mind for several Days, but to shoot my self
into the Head with my Pistol.</P>
<P>I was all this while in a vagrant Life, among
Infidels, Turks, Pagans, and such Sort of People;
I had no Minister, no Christian, to converse with,
but poor <HI>William,</HI> he was my Ghostly Father, or
Confessor, and he was all the Comfort I had. As
for my Knowledge of Religion, you have heard
my History; you may suppose I had not much,
<PB N="332" REF="350"/>
and as for the Word of God, I don't remember
that I ever read a Chapter in the <HI>Bible</HI> in my Life∣time;
I was <HI>little Bob</HI> at <HI>Busselton,</HI> and went to
School to learn my <HI>Testament.</HI></P>
<P>However, it pleased God to make <HI>William</HI> the
Quaker every thing to me; upon this Occasion I
took him out one Evening as usual, and hurried
him away into the Fields with me, in more Haste
than ordinary, and there, in short, I told him
the Perplexity of my Mind, and under what ter∣rible
Temptations of the Devil I had been, that
I must shoot my self, for I could not support the
Weight and Terror that was upon me.</P>
<P>Shoot your self, <HI>says William,</HI> why, what will
that do for you?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says I,</HI> 'twill put an End to a miserable
Life.</P>
<P>Well, <HI>says William,</HI> are you satisfied the next
will be better?</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>says I,</HI> much worse to be sure.</P>
<P>Why then, <HI>says he,</HI> shoot your self is the De∣vil's
Notion, no doubt, for 'tis the Devil of a
Reason, that because thou art in an ill Case, that
therefore thou must put thy self into a worse.</P>
<P>This shock'd my Reason indeed: Well, but
<HI>says I,</HI> there is no bearing the miserable Condition
I am in.</P>
<P>Very well, <HI>says William,</HI> but it seems there is
some bearing a worse Condition, and so you will
shoot your self, that you may be past Remedy.</P>
<P>I am past Remedy already, <HI>says I.</HI></P>
<P>How do you know that, <HI>sayshe?</HI></P>
<P>I am satisfied of it, <HI>said I.</HI></P>
<P>Well, <HI>says he,</HI> but you are not sure, so you will
shoot your self to make it certain; for tho' on this
side Death you can't be sure you will be damned
<PB N="333" REF="351"/>
at all, yet the Moment you step on the other side
of Time, you are sure of it; for when 'tis done,
'tis not to be said then that you will, but that you
are damned.</P>
<P><HI>Well, but, says</HI> William, <HI>as if he had been between
Jest and Earnest,</HI> pray, what didst thou dream of
last Night?</P>
<P>Why, <HI>said I,</HI> I had frightful Dreams all Night,
and particularly I dreamt that the Devil came for
me, and asked me what my Name was? and I
told him, then he askt me what Trade I was?
Trade, <HI>says I,</HI> I am a Thief, a Rogue, by my Cal∣ling;
I am a Pirate, and a Murtherer, and ought
to be hanged; ay, ay, says the Devil, so you do,
and you are the Man I look'd for, and therefore
come along with me, at which I was most horri∣bly
frighted, and cried out, so that it waked me,
and I have been in a horrible Agony ever since.</P>
<P>Very well, <HI>says William,</HI> come, give me the
Pistol thou talk'st of just now.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says I,</HI> what will you do with it?</P>
<P>Do with it, <HI>says William,</HI> why, thou needst not
shoot thy self, I shall be obliged to do it for thee,
why, thou wilt destroy us all.</P>
<P>What do you mean, <HI>William, said I?</HI></P>
<P>Mean, <HI>said he,</HI> nay, what dist thou mean? to
cry out aloud in thy Sleep, <HI>I am a Thief, a Pirate,
u Murtherer, and ought to be hanged;</HI> why, thou
wilt ruine us all, 'twas well the <HI>Dutchman</HI> did not
understand <HI>English:</HI> In short, I must shoot thee to
save my own Life; come, come, <HI>says he,</HI> give me
thy Pistol.</P>
<P>I confess, this terrified me again another Way,
and I began to be sensible, that if any Body had
been near me to understand <HI>English,</HI> I had been
undone, and the Thought of shooting my self
<PB N="334" REF="352"/>
forsook me from that Time, and I turned to <HI>Wil∣liam;</HI>
you disorder me extremely, <HI>William, said I,</HI>
why, I am never safe, nor is it safe to keep me
Company, what shall I do? I shall betray you all.</P>
<P>Come, come, Friend <HI>Bob, says he,</HI> I'll put an
End to it all, if you will take my Advice.</P>
<P>How's that, <HI>said I?</HI></P>
<P>Why only, <HI>says he,</HI> that <HI>the next Time thou
talkest with the Devil, thou wilt talk a little softlier,</HI>
or we shall be all undone, and you too.</P>
<P>This frighted me, I must confess, and allay'd a
great deal of the Trouble of Mind I was in; but
<HI>William,</HI> after he had done jesting with me, enter∣ed
upon a very long and serious Discourse with me
about the Nature of my Circumstances, and about
Repentance, that it ought to be attended indeed
with a deep Abhorrence of the Crime that I had
to charge my self with, but that to despair of
God's Mercy was no Part of Repentance, but put∣ting
my self into the Condition of the Devil; in∣deed,
that I must apply my self with a sincere
humble Confession of my Crime, to ask Pardon of
God whom I had offended, and cast my self upon
his Mercy, resolving to be willing to make Re∣stitution,
if ever it should please God to put it in∣to
my Power, even to the utmost of what I had in
the World; and this he told me was the Method
which he had resolved upon himself, and in this
he told me he had found Comfort.</P>
<P>I had a great deal of Satisfaction in <HI>William's</HI>
Discourse, and it quieted me very much; but
<HI>William</HI> was very anxious ever after about my
talking in my Sleep, and took care to lye with me
always himself, and to keep me from Lodging in
any House, where so much as a Word of <HI>English</HI>
was understood.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="353"/>
However, there was not the like Occasion af∣terward,
for I was much more composed in my
Mind, and resolved for the future to live a quite
differing Life from what I had done: As to the
Wealth I had, I look'd upon it as nothing; I re∣solved
to set it apart to any such Opportunity of
doing Justice, that God should put into my
Hand, and the miraculous Opportunity I had af∣terwards
of applying some Parts of it to preserve
a ruined Family, whom I had plunder'd, may be
worth reading, if I have Room for it in this Ac∣count.</P>
<P>With these Resolutions I began to be restored
to some Degrees of Quiet in my Mind, and
having after almost three Months Stay at <HI>Bas∣sora</HI>
disposed of some Goods; but having a
great Quantity left, we hired Boats according
to the <HI>Dutchman</HI>'s Direction, and went up to <HI>Bug∣dat,</HI>
or <HI>Babylon,</HI> on the River <HI>Tygris,</HI> or rather <HI>Eu∣phrates;</HI>
we had a very considerable Cargo of
Goods with us, and therefore made a great Fi∣gure
there, and were receiv'd with Respect; we
had in Particular, two and Forty Bales of <HI>Indian</HI>
Stuffs of sundry Sorts, Silk, Muslins, and fine
Chints; we had Fifteen Bales of very fine <HI>China</HI>
Silks, and Seventy Packs or Bales of Spices, par∣ticularly
Cloves and Nutmegs, with other Goods;
we were bid Money here for our Cloves, but the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> advised us not to part with them, and
told us, we should get a better Price at <HI>Aleppo,</HI>
or in the <HI>Levant,</HI> so we prepared for the Ca∣ravan.</P>
<P>We concealed our having any Gold, or Pearls,
as much as we could, and therefore sold Three
or Four Bales of <HI>China</HI> Silks, and <HI>Indian</HI> Callicoes,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o raise Money to buy Camels, and to pay the
<PB N="336" REF="354"/>
Customs, which are taken at several Places, and
for our Provisions over the Desarts.</P>
<P>I travelled this Journey careless to the last De∣gree
of my Goods or Wealth, believing, that as
I came by it all by Rapine and Violence, God
would direct, that it should be taken from me
again in the same Manner; and indeed, I think I
might say, I was very willing it should be so;
but as I had a merciful Protector above me, so I
had a most faithful Steward, Counsellor, Partner,
or whatever I might call him, who was my Guide,
my Pilot, my Governor, my every thing, and
took care both of me, and of all we had; and
tho' he had never been in any of these Parts of
the World, yet he took the Care of all upon him;
and in about Nine and Fifty Days we arriv'd
from <HI>Bassora,</HI> at the Mouth of the River <HI>Tygris</HI>
and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> thro' the Desart, and thro' <HI>Aleppo</HI>
to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or as we call it, <HI>Scanderoon,</HI> in the
<HI>Levant.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>William</HI> and I, and the other two, our
faithful Comrades, debated what we should do;
and here <HI>William</HI> and I resolved to separate from
the other Two, they resolving to go with the
<HI>Dutchman</HI> into <HI>Holland,</HI> and by the Means of
some <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship which lay then in the Road:
<HI>William</HI> and I told them, we resolved to go and
settle in the <HI>Morea,</HI> which then belonged to the
<HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, we acted wisely in it not to let them
know whither we went, seeing we had resolved
to separate, but we took our old Doctor's Di∣rections
how to write to him in <HI>Holland,</HI> and
in <HI>England,</HI> that we might have Intelligence
from him on Occasion, and promised to give
him an Account how to write to us, which
<PB N="337" REF="355"/>
we afterwards did, as may in Time be made
out.</P>
<P>We stay'd here some Time after they were
gone, till at length not being thoroughly resolved
whither to go till then, a <HI>Venetian</HI> Ship touch'd at
<HI>Cyprus,</HI> and put in at <HI>Scanderoon</HI> to look for Freight
Home: We took the Hint, and bargaining for our
Passage, and the Freight of our Goods, we em∣bark'd
for <HI>Venice,</HI> where in two and Twenty
Days we arrived safe with all our Treasure, and
with such a Cargo, take our Goods, and our Mo∣ney,
and our Jewels together, as I believe was
never brought into the City by Two single Men,
since the State of <HI>Venice</HI> had a Being.</P>
<P>We kept our selves here <HI>incognito</HI> for a great
while, passing for Two <HI>Armenian</HI> Merchants still,
as we had done before; and by this Time we had
gotten so much of the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Armenian</HI> Jargon,
which they talk'd at <HI>Bassora,</HI> and <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and eve∣ry
where that we came in the Country, as was
sufficient to make us able to talk to one another,
so as not to be understood by any Body, though
sometimes hardly by our selves.</P>
<P>Here we converted all our Effects into Money,
settled our Abode as for a considerable Time, and
<HI>William</HI> and I maintaining an inviolable Friendship
and Fidelity to one another, lived like two Bro∣thers;
we neither had or sought any separate In∣terest;
we convers'd seriously and gravely, and
upon the Subject of our Repentance continually;
we never changed, that is to say, so as to leave
off our <HI>Armenian</HI> Garbs, and we were called at <HI>Ve∣nice</HI>
the two <HI>Grecians.</HI></P>
<P>I have been two or three times going to give a
Detail of our Wealth, but it will appear incredi∣ble,
and we had the greatest Difficulty in the
<PB N="338" REF="356"/>
World how to conceal it, being justly apprehen∣sive
lest we might be assassinated in that Country
for our Treasure; at length <HI>William</HI> told me, he
began to think now that he must never see <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
any more, and that indeed he did not much
concern himself about it; but seeing we had
gained so great a Wealth, and he had some poor
Relations in <HI>England,</HI> and, if I was willing, he would
write to know if they were living, and to know
what Condition they were in; and if he found
such of them were alive, as he had some Thoughts
about, he would, with my Consent, send them
something to better their Condition.</P>
<P>I consented most willingly, and accordingly
<HI>William</HI> wrote to a Sister, and an Uncle, and in
about five Weeks Time receiv'd an Answer from
them both, directed to himself, under Cover of a
hard <HI>Armenian</HI> Name that he had given himself,
<HI>viz.</HI> Seignior <HI>Constantine Alexion of Ispahan</HI> at <HI>Ve∣nice.</HI></P>
<P>It was a very moving Letter he receiv'd from
his Sister, who after the most passionate Expressi∣ons
of Joy to hear he was alive, seeing she had
long ago had an Account that he was murthered by
the Pirates in the <HI>West Indies;</HI> she intreats him to
let her know what Circumstances he was in; tells
him, she was not in any Capacity to do any thing
considerable for him, but that he should be wel∣come
to her with all her Heart; that she was left
a Widow with Four Children, but kept a little
Shop in the <HI>Minories,</HI> by which she made shift to
maintain her Family; and that she had sent him
Five Pound, lest he should want Money in a
strange Country, to bring him Home.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="357"/>
I could see the Letter brought Tears out of his
Eyes, as he read it, and indeed when he shewed it
me, and the little Bill for Five Pounds upon an
<HI>English</HI> Merchant in <HI>Venice,</HI> it brought Tears out
of my Eyes too.</P>
<P>After we had been both affected sufficiently
with the Tenderness and Kindness of this Letter,
he turns to me, <HI>says he,</HI> what shall I do for this
poor Woman? I mused a while, at last, <HI>says I▪</HI>
I will tell you what you shall do for her; she
has sent you Five Pounds, and she has Four Chil∣dren,
and her self, that's Five; such a Sum from
a poor Woman in her Circumstances, is as much
as Five Thousand Pounds is to us: You shall send
her a Bill of Exchange for Five Thousand Pounds
<HI>English</HI> Money, and bid her conceal her Surprize
at it, till she hears from you again, but bid her
leave off her Shop, and go and take a House some
where in the Country, not far off from <HI>London,</HI>
and stay there in a moderate Figure, till she hears
from you again.</P>
<P>Now, says <HI>William,</HI> I perceive by it that you
have some Thoughts of venturing into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed <HI>William, said I,</HI> you mistake me, but it
presently occurred to me that you should venture;
for what have you done that you may not be seen
there? Why should I desire to keep you from
your Relations purely to keep me Company?</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> look'd very affectionately upon me;
nay, <HI>says he,</HI> we have embarked together so long,
and come together so far, I am resolved I'll never
part with thee as long as I live, go where thou
wilt, or stay where thou wilt; and as for my
Sister, said <HI>William,</HI> I cannot send her such a Sum
of Money; for whose is all this Money we have?
'tis most of it thine.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="358"/>
No, <HI>William, said I,</HI> there is not a Penny of it
mine but what is yours too, and I won't have
any thing but an equal Share with you, and
therefore you shall send it to her, if not, I will
send it.</P>
<P>Why, <HI>says William,</HI> it will make the poor Wo∣man
distracted, she will be so surprized, she will
go out of her Wits; well, <HI>said William,</HI> you may
do it prudently; send her a Bill back'd of a Hun∣dred
Pounds, and bid her expect more in a Post
or two; and that you will send her enough to
live on without keeping Shop, and then send her
more.</P>
<P>Accordingly <HI>William</HI> sent her a very kind Let∣ter,
with a Bill upon a Merchant in <HI>London</HI> for a
Hundred and Sixty Pound, and bid her comfort
her self with the Hope, that he should be able in
a little Time to send her more. About ten Days
after he sent her another Bill of Five Hundred
and Forty Pound, and a Post or two after another
for Three Hundred Pound, making in all a Thou∣sand
Pound; and told her he would send her suf∣ficient
to leave off her Shop, and directed her to
take a House, as above.</P>
<P>He waited then till he received an Answer to
all the Three Letters, with an Account, that she
had received the Money, and which I did not
expect, that she had not let any other Acquain∣tance
know that she had received a Shilling from
any Body, or so much as that he was alive, and
would not till she heard again.</P>
<P>When he shewed me this Letter, well, <HI>William
said I,</HI> this Woman is fit to be trusted with Life
or any thing, send her the rest of the Five Thou∣sand
Pound; and I'll venture to <HI>England</HI> with you,
to this Woman's House, whenever you will.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="359"/>
In a Word, we sent her Five Thousand Pound
in good Bills, and she receiv'd them punctually,
and in a little Time sent her Brother Word, that
she had pretended to her Uncle that she was
sickly, and could not carry on the Trade any
longer, and that she had taken a large House
about Four Miles from <HI>London,</HI> under Pretence of
letting Lodgings for her Livelihood; and, in short,
intimated as if she understood that he intended to
come over to be <HI>Incognito,</HI> assuring him he should
be as retired as he pleased.</P>
<P>This was opening the very Door for us, that
we thought had been effectually shut for this Life;
and in a Word, we resolved to venture, but to
keep our selves entirely concealed, both as to
Name, and every other Circumstance; and ac∣cordingly
<HI>William</HI> sent his Sister Word, how
kindly he took her prudent Steps, and that she
had guessed right, that he desired to be retired,
and that he obliged her not to increase her Fi∣gure,
but live private, till she might perhaps see
him.</P>
<P>He was going to send the Letter away; come,
<HI>William, said I,</HI> you shan't send her an empty Let∣ter,
tell her, you have a Friend coming with
you, that must be as retired as your self, and I'll
send her Five Thousand Pound more.</P>
<P>So in short we made this poor Woman's Fami∣ly
rich, and yet when it came to the Point, my
Heart failed me, and I durst not venture, and
for <HI>William,</HI> he would not stir without me, and so
we stayed about two Year after this, considering
what we should do.</P>
<P>You may think, perhaps, that I was very pro∣digal
of my ill-gotten Goods, thus to load a Stran∣ger
with my Bounty, and give a Gift like a
<PB N="342" REF="360"/>
Prince to one that had been able to merit nothing
of me, or indeed know me: But my Condition
ought to be considered in this Case; though I
had Money to Profusion, yet I was perfectly de∣stitute
of a Friend in the World to have the least
Obligation or Assistance from, or knew not either
where to dispose or trust any Thing I had while I
lived, or whom to give it to, if I died.</P>
<P>When I had reflected upon the Manner of my
Getting of it, I was sometimes for giving of it all
to charitable Uses, as a Debt due to Mankind,
though I was a Roman-Catholick, and not at all
of the Opinion, that it would purchase me any
Repose to my Soul; but I thought, as it was got
by a general Plunder, and which I could make no
Satisfaction for, it was due to the Community,
and I ought to distribute it for the general Good.
But still I was at a Loss how, and where, and by
whom to settle this Charity, not daring to go
Home to my own Country, lest some of my Com∣rades
stroled Home should see and detect me;
and, for the very Spoil of my Money, or the Pur∣chase
of his own Pardon, betray and expose me to
an untimely End.</P>
<P>Being thus destitute, I say, of a Friend, I
pitch'd thus upon <HI>William</HI>'s Sister; the kind Step
of her's to her Brother, who she thought to be
in Distress, signifying a generous Mind, and a
charitable Disposition; and having resolved to
make her the Object of my first Bounty, I did not
doubt but I should purchase something of a Refuge
for my self, and a kind of a Centre, to which I
should tend in my future Actions; for really a
Man that has a Subsistance, and no Residence, no
Place that has a Magnetick Influence upon his
Affections, is in one of the most odd uneasy Con∣ditions
<PB N="343" REF="361"/>
in the World; nor is it in the Power of
all his Money to make it up to him.</P>
<P>It was, as I told you, two Year and upwards,
that we remained at <HI>Venice,</HI> and thereabout, in
the greatest Hesitation imaginable, irresolute and
unfixed to the last Degree. <HI>William</HI>'s Sister im∣portuned
us daily to come to <HI>England,</HI> and won∣dered
we should not dare to trust her, whom we
had to such a Degree obliged to be faithful; and
in a Manner lamented her being suspected by us.</P>
<P>At last I began to incline; and I said to <HI>William,</HI>
Come, Brother <HI>William, said I, for ever since our
Discourse at</HI> Balsara, <HI>I called him Brother,</HI> if you
will agree to two or three Things with me, I'll go
Home to <HI>England</HI> with all my Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Says William,</HI> let me know what they are.</P>
<P>Why first, <HI>says I,</HI> you shall not disclose your
self to any of your Relations in <HI>England,</HI> but your
Sister, no not to one.</P>
<P>Secondly, we will not shave off our Mustachoes
or Beards, (for we had all along worn our Beards
after the <HI>Grecian</HI> Manner) nor leave off our long
Vests, that we may pass for <HI>Grecians</HI> and Foreigners.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That we shall never speak <HI>English</HI> in
publick before any body, your Sister excepted.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That we will always live together,
and pass for Brothers.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> said, he would agree to them all with
all his Heart; but that the not speaking <HI>English</HI>
would be the hardest; but he would do his best
for that too: So, in a Word, we agreed to go
from <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> where we verted a large
Sum of Money in Bales of Silk, left a large Sum
in a Merchant's Hands at <HI>Venice,</HI> and another con∣siderable
Sum at <HI>Naples,</HI> and took Bills of Ex∣change
for a great deal too; and yet we came
<PB N="344" REF="362"/>
with such a Cargoe to <HI>London,</HI> as few <HI>American</HI>
Merchants had done for some Years; for we
loaded in two Ships seventy three Bales of thrown
Silk, besides thirteen Bales of wrought Silks from
the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> shipt at <HI>Genoa;</HI> with all
which I arrived safely, and some time after mar∣ried
my faithful Protectress, <HI>William</HI>'s Sister,
with whom I am much more happy than I deserve.</P>
<P>And now, having so plainly told you, that I
am come to <HI>England,</HI> after I have so boldly own'd
what Life I have led abroad, 'tis Time to leave
off, and say no more for the present, lest some
should be willing to inquire too nicely after</P>
