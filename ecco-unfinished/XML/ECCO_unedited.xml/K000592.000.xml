<P>Pshaw! it's only wasting time and breath. Bawling won't persuade him to budge a bit faster. Things are all alter'd now; and whatever weight it may have in <HI>some</HI> places, bawling, it seems, don't go for argument, here. Plague on't! we are now in the wilds of America.</P>

<P>Lord! Sir, if my master makes no more haste, we shall all be put to sword by the knives of the natives; I'm told they take off heads like hats, and hang 'em on pegs in their parlours. Mercy an us! My head

aches with the very thoughts of it. Holo! Mr. Inkle! master; holo!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Head aches! Zounds, so does mine with your confounded bawling. It's enough to bring all the na∣tives about us, and we shall be stript and plunder'd in a minute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye; stripping is the first thing that wou'd happen to us; for they seem to be woefully off for a wardrobe. I myself saw three at a distance with less cloaths than I have when I get out of bed; all dancing about in black buff; just like Adam in mourning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>This it is to have to do with a schemer! a fel∣low who risques his life, for a chance of advancing his interest.—Always advantage in view! Trying here to make discoveries that may promote his profit in England. Another Botany Bay scheme, mayhap. Nothing else could induce him to quit our foraging party from the ship; when he knows every inhabitant here is not only as black as a pepper-corn, but as hot into the bargain— and <HI>I,</HI> like a fool, to follow him! and then to let him loiter behind.—Why, Nephew!—Why, Inkle.—<STAGE><HI>calling</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why Ink—Well! Only to see the dif∣ference of men; he'd have thought it very hard, now, if I had let him call so often after me. Ah! I wish he was calling after me now in the old jog-trot way again. What a fool was I to leave London for foreign parts! —That ever I shou'd leave Threadneedle-street, to thread an American forest, where a man's as soon lost as a needle in a bottle of hay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Patience, Trudge! Patience! If we once re∣cover the ship —.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord sir, I shall never recover what I have lost in coming abroad. When my master and I were in London, I had such a mortal snug birth of it! Why I was <HI>factotum.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Factotum to a young merchant is no such sine∣cure neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But then the honor of it. Think of that, sir; to be clerk as well as <HI>own man.</HI> Only consider. You find very few city clerks made out of a man now-a-days.
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>
To be king of the counting-house, as well as lord of the bed-chamber. Ah! if I had him but now in the little dressing-room behind the office; tying his hair with a bit of red tape as usual.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, or writing an invoice in lampblack, and shining his shoes with an ink bottle <HI>as usual,</HI> you blun∣dering blockhead!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh if I was but brushing the accounts, or casting up the coats! mercy on us! What's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That! What?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Didn't you hear a noise?</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Inkle.</STAGE>
<P>Now nephew!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So, Mr. Medium.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds, one wou'd think, by your confounded composure, that you were walking in St. James's Park instead of an American forest, and that all the beasts were nothing but good company. The hollow trees here, centry boxes, and the lions in 'em soldiers; the ja<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kalls, courtiers, the crocodiles, fine women, and the baboons, beaux. What the plague made you loiter so long?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Reflection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So I shou'd think; reflection generally comes lagging behind. What, scheming, I suppose? never quiet. At it again, eh? What a happy trader is your father, to have so prudent a son for a partner! Why, you are the carefullest Co. in the whole city; never losing fight of the main chance, and that's the reason perhaps you lost sight of us here on the main of America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Mr. Medium. Arithmetic I own has been the means of our parting at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! A sum in division I reckon.<STAGE><HI>Aside.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, if I may be so bold, what mighty scheme has just tempted you to employ your head, when you ought to make use of your heels?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My heels! Here's pretty doctrine! Do you think I travel merely for motion? A fine expensive plan
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
for a trader truly. What, wou'd you have a man of business come abroad, scamper extravagantly here and there and every where, then return home, and have nothing to tell, but that he has <HI>been</HI> here and there and every where? 'Sdeath, Sir, would you have me travel like a lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, the Lord forbid! <Q>“but I am wrong perhaps! there is something in the air of this forest, ”I believe, that inclines people to be hasty</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Travelling, Uncle, was always intended for improvement, and improvement is an advantage; and advantage is profit, and profit is gain. Which in the travelling translation of a trader, means that you shou'd gain every advantage of improving your profit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How—gain, and advantage, and profit? "Zounds I'm quite at a loss."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You've hit it Uncle! so am I. I have lost <Q>“my clue by your conversation; you have knock'd all ”my meditations on the head.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Its very lucky for you, no-body has done it "before me."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have been comparing the land here, with that of our own country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And you find it like a good deal of the land of our own country—cursedly encumber'd with black legs, I take it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And calculating how much it might be made to produce by the acre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You were?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I was proceeding algebraically upon the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And just about extracting the square root.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hum!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I was thinking too, if so many natives cou'd be caught, how much they might fetch at the West India markets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Now let me ask you a question, or two, young Canibal Catcher, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="8"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Arn't we bound for Barbadoes, partly to trade, but chiefly to carry home the daughter of the go∣vernor, Sir Christopher Curry, who has till now been under your father's care in Threadneedle-street for polite English education?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And isn't it determin'd, between the old folks, that you are to marry Narcissa as soon as we get there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>A fix't thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then what the devil do you do here hunting old hairy negroes, when you ought to be ogling a fine girl in the ship? Algebra too! You'll have other things to think of when you are married, I promise you! a plodding fellow's head in the hands of a young wife, like a boy's slate after school, soon gets all its arithmetick wip'd off, and then it appears in its true simple state: dark, empty, and bound in wood, Master Inkle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not in a match of this kind. Why it's a table of interest from beginning to end, old Medium.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, this is no time to talk. Who knows but instead of sailing to a wedding, we may get cut up here for a wedding dinner, toss'd up for a dingy duke perhaps, or stew'd down for a black baronet, or eat raw by an Inky commoner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why sure you arn't afraid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Who, I afraid! Ha! ha! ha! No, not I! What the deuce should I be afraid of? Thank heaven I have a clear conscience, and need not be afraid of any thing. A scoundrel might not be quite so easy on such an occasion; but it's the part of an honest man not to behave like a scoundrel. I never behav'd like a scoundrel—for which reason I am an honest man you know. But come—I hate to boast of my good qua∣lities.</P>

<P>I Saw her this morning, gentlemen, you may depend on't. My telescope never fails me. I popp'd upon her as I was taking a peep from my balcony. A brave tight ship, I tell you, bearing down directly for Barbadoes here.</P>

<P>And the last brought only madam Narcissa, our Governor's daughter, from England; with a parcel of lazy, idle, white folks about her. Such cargoes will never do for our Trade, neighbour.</P>

<SPEAKER>4<HI>th Plant.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No, no: we want slaves. A terrible dearth of 'em in Barbadoes lately! But your dingy passengers for my money. Give me a vessel like a collier, where all the lading tumbles out as black as my hat. But are you sure now you ar'n't mistaken?<STAGE><HI>to</HI> 1<HI>st Planter</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>Well, Ma'am, as I was saying—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, say no more of what you were saying— Sure, Patty, you forget where you are; a little caution will be necessary now, I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Madam, how is it possible to help talking? We are in Barbadoes here to be sure—but then, Ma'am, one may let out a little in a private morn∣ing's walk by ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it's the same thing with you in doors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to say the truth, Ma'am, tho' we do <Q>“live in your father's house, Sir Christopher Curry, the grand governor that governs all Barbadoes— and a terrible positive Governor he is to be sure; yet, he'll find it a difficult matter to govern a cham∣bermaid's ”tongue, I believe.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That I am sure of, Patty; for it runs as ra∣pidly "as the tide which brought us from England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, Ma'am, and like the tide it "stops for no man.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>"Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, let it run as you please; only for "my sake, take care it don't run away with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Ma'am, it has been too well train'd <Q>“in the course of conversation, I promise you; and if ever it says any thing to your disadvantage, my name ”is not Patty Prink.</Q>—I never blab, Ma'am, never, as I hope for a gown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And your never blabbing, as you call it, de∣pends chiefly on that hope, I believe. The unlocking my chest, locks up all your faculties. An old silk gown makes you turn your back on all my secrets; a large bonnet blinds your eyes, and a fashionable high hand∣kerchief covers your ears, and stops your mouth at once, Patty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Dear Ma'am, how can you think a body so mercenary! Am I always teasing you about gowns and gew-gaws, and fallals and finery? Or do you take me for a conjuror, that nothing will come out of my mouth but ribbons? I have told the story of our voyage, in∣deed, to old Guzzle, the butler, who is very inquisitive; and, between ourselves, is the ugliest old Quiz I ever saw in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I have seen him; pitted with the small-pox and a red face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Right, Ma'am. It's for all the world like his master's cellar, full of holes and liquor; but when he asks me what you and I think of the matter, why I look wise, and cry like other wise people who have nothing to say— All's for the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And, thus, you lead him to imagine I am but little inclin'd to the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Lord, Ma'am, how cou'd that be? Why, I never said a word about Captain Campley.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hush! hush, for heaven's sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay! there it is now.—There, Ma'am, I'm as mute as a mack'rel—That name strikes me dumb in a moment. I don't know how it is, but Captain Camp∣ley somehow or other has the knack of stopping my mouth oftner than any body else, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>

<P>His name again!—Consider.—Never men∣tion it, I desire you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="29" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, Ma'am, not I. But if our voyage from England was so pleasant, it wasn't owing to Mr. Inkle, I'm certain. He didn't play the fiddle in our cabin, and dance on the deck, and come languishing with a glass of warm water in his hand, when we were sea-sick. Ah, Ma'am, that water warm'd your heart, I'm confident. Mr. Inkle! No, no; Captain Cam—<Q>“there, he ”has stopped my Mouth again Ma'am.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>There is no end to this! Remember, Patty, keep your secresy, or you entirely lose my favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me, Ma'am. But if somebody I know is not acquainted with the Governor, there's such a thing as dancing at balls, and squeezing hands when you lead up, and squeezing them again when you cast down, and walking on the Quay in a morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No more of this!"</P>

<P>"This heedless wench, every time she speaks, I dread a discovery of my sentiments." How awkward is my present situation! Promis'd to one, who, per∣haps, may never again be heard of; and who, I am sure, if he ever appears to claim me, will do it merely on the score of interest—press'd too, by another, who has al∣ready, I fear, too much interest in my heart—what can I do? What plan can I follow?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Campley.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Follow my advice, Narcissa, by all means. Enlist with me, under the best banners in the world. General Hymen for my money; little Cupid's his drum∣mer; he has been beating a round rub-a-dub on our hearts, and we have only to obey the word of com∣mand, fall into the ranks of matrimony, and march thro' life together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Halt! halt, Captain! You march too quick; besides, you make matrimony a mere parade."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, I believe, many make it so at present; but we are volunteers, Narcissa! and I am for actual service, I promise you."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Then consider our situation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That has been duly consider'd. In short, the case stands exactly thus; your intended spouse is all for money: I am all for love. He is a rich rogue; I am ra∣ther a poor honest fellow. He wou'd pocket your for∣tune; I will take you without a fortune in your pocket.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But where's Mr. Inkle's view of interest? Hasn't he run away from me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>And I am ready to run away <HI>with</HI> you; <Q>“you won't always meet with such an offer on an emer∣gency.”</Q></P>

<PB N="31" REF="28"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I am sensible of the favour, most gallant Captain Campley; and my father, no doubt, will be very much oblig'd to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, there's the devil of it: Sir Christopher Curry's confounded good character—knocks me up at once. Yet I am not acquainted with him neither; not known to him, even by sight; being here only as a pri∣vate gentleman on a visit to my old relation, out of re∣gimentals, and so forth; and not introduc'd to the Go∣vernor as other officers of the place: But then the re∣port of his hospitality—his odd, blunt, whimsical friend∣ship—his whole behaviour—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>All stare you in the face; eh, Campley?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>They do, till they put me out of countenance. But then again, when I stare <HI>you</HI> in the face, I can't think I have any reason to be asham'd of my proceedings.—I stick here between my Love and my Principle, like a song between a toast and a sentiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And if your love and your principle were put in the scales, you doubt which wou'd weigh most?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no! I shou'd act like a rogue, and let principle kick the beam: For love, Narcissa, is as heavy as lead, and like a bullet from a pistol, cou'd never go thro' the heart, if it wanted weight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Nar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Or rather like the pistol itself, that often <HI>goes off</HI> without any harm done. Your fire must end in smoke, I believe.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never, whilst—</P>

<SP>

<P>Nay, a truce to protestations at present. What signifies talking to <HI>me,</HI> when you have such opposi∣tion from others? Why hover about the city, instead of boldly attacking the guard? Wheel about, captain! face the enemy! March! Charge! Rout 'em—Drive 'em before you, and then—</P>

<P>Well said, old fool's-cap, and it's as mere a blank as a sheet of white paper. <Q>“It bears the traces of neither a bad or a good hand upon it! Zounds! I had rather be a walking libel on honesty, than sit down a ”blank in the library of the world.</Q></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Chr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>"Is like all your other virtues"—A negative one. You are honest, old Medium, by com∣parison, just as a fellow sentenc'd to transportation is happier than his companion condemn'd to the gallows— Very worthy, because you are no rogue, "a good friend, because you never bear malice."—Tender hearted, be∣cause you never go to fires and executions; and an af∣fectionate father and husband, because you never pinch your children, or kick your wife out of bed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>And that, as the world goes, is more than every man can say for himself. Yet, since you force me to speak, my positive qualities—but, no matter—you re∣member me in London; <Q>“and know, there was scarcely

<P>And, dam'me, if I wou'd not kick any man into the New River that had done me an injury. There's the difference of our honesty. Oons! if you want to be an honest fellow, act from the impulse of nature. Why, you have no more gall than a pigeon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>"Med.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That, I think, is pretty evident in my pri∣vate <Q>“life.—Patience, patience you must own, Sir Christopher, is a virtue. And I have sat and heard my best friends abus'd, with as much quiet patience as any ”Christian in Christendom.</Q></P>

<P>"Ha!" You're always so hasty; amongst the hodge-podge of your foibles, passion is always predomi∣nant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Chr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So much the better.—<Q>“A natural man unseason'd with passion is as uncommon as a dish of hogde-podge without pepper, and devilish insipid too, ”old Medium.</Q>—Foibles, quotha? foibles are foils that give additional lustre to the gems of virtue; you have not so many soils as I, perhaps.</P>

<P>Hey day! Here's a stile! the voyage has jumbled the fellow's brains out of their places; the wa∣ter has made his head turn round; but no matter; mine turns round too. I'll go and prepare Narcissa directly; they shall be married slap-dash as soon as he comes from the quay. From Neptune to Hymen, from the hammock to the bridal bed. Ha! old boy!</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Patty.</STAGE>
<P>MERCY on us! what a walk I have had of it! Well, matters go on swimmingly at the governor's—The old gentleman has order'd the carriage, and the young couple will be whisk'd here to the church in a quarter of an hour. My business is to prevent young sobersides, Young Inkle, from appealing to interrupt the ceremony. —Ha! here's the Crown, where I hear he is hous'd. So now to find Trudge, and trump up a story in the true stile of a chambermaid. <STAGE><HI>Goes into the House.</HI></STAGE><STAGE><HI>Patty within.</HI></STAGE> I tell you it don't signify, and I will come up. <STAGE><HI>Trudge within.</HI></STAGE> But it does signify, and you can't come up.</P>

<P>You had better say at once, I shan't.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well then you shan't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Savage! Pretty behaviour you have pick'd up amongst the Hottypots; your London civility, like Lon∣don itself, will soon be lost in smoke, Mr. Trudge; and the politeness you have studied so long in Threadneedle-street, blotted out by the blacks you have been living with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No such thing; I practis'd my politeness all the while I was in the woods. Our very lodging taught me good manners; for I could never bring myself to go into it without bowing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="52" REF="49"/>

<P>Don't tell me! A mighty civil reception you give a body truly after a six weeks parting!</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Patty.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>Oh! very well—I'll take it again.<STAGE><HI>Offers to kiss her.</HI></STAGE></P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>No?</P>

<P>Pshaw! these girls are so plaguy proud of their white and red! but I won't be shamed out of Wows, that's flat. Master, to be sure, while we were in the forest, taught Yarico to read with his pencil and pocket-book. What then? Wows comes on fine and fast in her lessons. A little awkward at first, to be sure. —Ha! ha!—She's so us'd to feed with her hands, that I can't get nor to eat her victuals in a genteel Christian way for the soul of me: when she has stuck a morsel on her fork, she don't know how to guide it; but pops up her knuckles to her mouth, and the meat goes up to her ear. But, no matter—After all the fine flashy London girls, Wowski's the wench for my money.</P>

<P>She'll be here presently. One thing I had forgot; when she is your's, I need not caution you, after the hints I've given, to keep her from the castle. If Sir Christopher should see her, 'twou'd lead, you know, to a discovery of what I wish conceal'd.</P>

<P>I cou'dn't, Sir, I cou'dn't—I intended to say what you bid me—but, I felt such a pain in my throat, I cou'dn't speak a word, for the soul of me, and so, Sir, I fell a crying.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Trudge.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all, Sir. She sat down, with her two hands clasp'd on her knees, and look'd so piti∣fully in my face, I cou'd not stand it. Oh here she comes. I'll go and find Wows. If I must be melan∣choly, she shall keep me company,<STAGE><HI>Exit.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>Oh do not—do not leave me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, simple girl! I'm labouring for your good. My interest here is nothing; I can do nothing from myself; you are ignorant of our country's customs. I
<PB N="67" REF="64"/>
must give way to men more powerful, who will not have me with you. But see, my Yarico, ever anxious for your welfare, I've found a kind, good person, who will protect you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Yarico.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! why not you protect me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I have no means—how can I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Yarico.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Just as I shelter'd you. Take me to yon∣der mountain, where I see no smoke from tall high houses, fill'd with your cruel countrymen. None of your princes there will come to take me from you. And shou'd they stray that way, we'll find a lurking place, just like my own poor cave, where many a day I sat beside you, and bless'd the chance that brought you to it—that I might save your life.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Sir Chr.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>His life! Zounds! my blood boils at the scoundrel's ingratitude!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Yar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, let's go. I always fear'd these cities. Let's fly, and seek the woods; and there we'll wander hand in hand together. No cares will vex us then—We'll let the day glide by in idleness; and you shall sit in the shade, and watch the sun-beam playing on the brook, while I will sing the song that pleases you. No cares, love, but for food—and we'll live cheerily I warrant—In the fresh early morning you shall hunt down our game, and I will pick you berries—and then, at night, I'll trim our bed of leaves, and lie me down in peace—Oh! we shall be so happy!—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“This is mere trifling, the trifling of an unen∣lighten'd ”Indian.</Q> Hear me, Yarico. My coun∣trymen and your's differ as much in minds as in com∣plexions. We were not born to live in woods and caves—to seek subsistence by pursuing beasts—We christians, girl, hunt money, a thing unknown to you. But here, 'tis money which brings us ease, plenty, command, power, every thing, and of course happiness. You are the bar to my attaining this; therefore 'tis necessary for my good—and which I think, you value.—</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Yar.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I gave up all for you—my friends—my coun∣try: all that was dear to me: and still grown dearer since you shelter'd there—All, all was left for you, and were it now to do again—again I'd cross the seas, and follow you all the world over.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Camp.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I never did, Sir.—Since I sailed from England with your daughter, my affection has daily encreased, and when I came to explain myself to you, by a number of concurring circumstances, which I am now partly acquainted with, you mistook me for that gentleman. Yet had I even then been aware of your mistake, I must confess the regard for my own happiness would have tempted me to let you remain undeceiv'd.</P>

<P>I am a Soldier, Sir Christopher; Love and War, is the soldiers motto; and tho' my income is tri∣fling to your <HI>intended</HI> son-in-law's, still the chance of war has enabled me to support the object of my love above indigence.

<P>Suppose, old Gentleman, you had a son?</P>

<P>S'blood! then I'd make him an honest fel∣low, and teach him that the seeling heart never knows greater pride than when it's employ'd in giving succour to the unfortunate: I'd teach him to be his father's own son to a hair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Even so my father tutor'd me; from infancy bending my tender mind, like a young sapling, to his

will—Interest was the grand prop round which he twin'd my pliant, green affections; taught me in childhood to repeat old sayings—all tending to his own fix'd principles: and the first sentence that I ever lisp'd, was <HI>Charity be∣gins at Home.</HI></P>

<P>I shall never like a proverb again as long as I live.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Inkle.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>As I grew up, he'd prove—and by example —were I in want, I might e'en starve, for what the world cared for their neighbours; why then shou'd I care for the world? Men now liv'd for themselves.
