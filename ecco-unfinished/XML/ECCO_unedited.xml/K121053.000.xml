<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>EVER were People more infatuated, and more iudustriously con∣triving each others Ru∣in, than the Inhabitants of this unhappy Island. The <HI>English</HI> who formerly were a Terror to their Enemies, and a Supporter of their Friends and Allies, are now become Foes to none but themselves, and destroyers of their own Happiness.
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
But what adds more to this mis∣fortune, is, that so great mischief should be occasioned by those two Trifling and Insignificant words of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory;</HI> Names invented in Hell, and spread about this King∣dom to brand Honest Men with o∣dious Characters, and turn the whole Nation into Confusion.</P>
<P>The Etymology of these Names, carries in it both <HI>Ill Nature</HI> and <HI>Scan∣dal;</HI> and as we apply them to each other with all the <HI>Bitterness</HI> and <HI>In∣famy,</HI> we can, so we very well an∣swer their Signification. I did call them <HI>insignificant</HI> Names, and in one Sense they are; for tho' they have a <HI>Signification,</HI> yet their Natural <HI>Mean∣ing,</HI> which I shall immediately make pear, is <HI>Poor, Beggarly,</HI> and <HI>Villainous,</HI> to Men of <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Honesty;</HI> and none but <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Knaves</HI> will em∣brace the Distinction, and take ei∣ther of these Characters.</P>
<P>The Former of these <HI>excellent</HI> Names, according to the best Infor∣mation, that I can get, and 'tis no great matter, whether it is true or false, comes from <HI>Scotland,</HI> which signifies a sort of <HI>Butter-Milk</HI> or
<PB N="3" REF="4"/>
<HI>Whey;</HI> which is the worst Part of the <HI>Milk,</HI> that is left after <HI>Butter,</HI> or <HI>Cheese,</HI> is made.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Butter-Milk,</HI> it has a very Sower Tast, not unlike the present Temper of the <HI>English;</HI> for when a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Tory</HI> meet together, they look as Sower upon one another as so many <HI>Crab-Trees;</HI> And their Dis∣course, if they happen to confabu∣late, has as much Sweetness in it, as the Juice of those Apples, which the abovesaid Trees produce; so that <HI>by their Fruit you may know them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Latin</HI> words for a <HI>Whig</HI> are <HI>Homo Fanaticus, Homo Factiosus.</HI> The former, according to <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Phi∣lander</HI>'s Glossary, signifies a Man that is <HI>Mad, Frantick,</HI> or <HI>Fanatick;</HI> The Latter <HI>Factious, Mutinous,</HI> and <HI>Rebellious.</HI> Words exceedingly well adapted for <HI>Abuse</HI> and <HI>Scandal,</HI> and of great use to Blacken Mens Reputa∣tion.</P>
<P>So likewise <HI>Whigism</HI> according to the same Language is call'd <HI>Enthu∣siasmus</HI> and <HI>Perduellio.</HI> The former is agreeable to the word <HI>Fanaticus,</HI> and according to the Ecclesiastical Interpreters, signifies a <HI>Spiritual Mad∣ness,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
or a <HI>vain Pretence</HI> to <HI>Divine In∣spiration;</HI> such as the late <HI>French Pro∣phets</HI> aim'd at, and the good <HI>tolera∣ted</HI> People, now call'd <HI>Quakers,</HI> pretend to have. This by way of Analogy is put for all manner of Madness; and when the Epithet <HI>Whigish</HI> is an∣nex'd to the Substantive <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> it means then <HI>Political Madness.</HI> The latter Word <HI>Perduellio</HI> explains the Word <HI>Faction,</HI> in a very bad Sense, and signifies <HI>High-Treason</HI> a∣gainst Prince and State, according to <HI>Cicero, Livy</HI> and other Authors. This is charging Men with the highest Crimes, that malice can in∣vent, or Human Nature can be guilty of. And therefore they, who keep up such Distinctions, deserve neither the Name of an <HI>Englishman</HI> nor a <HI>Christian;</HI> they are only a Pest to the Nation, and by spreading their Infection, their Contagious Distemper, like a Canker, will eat us up and consume us in Time.</P>
<P>But besides all this Rancour and Malice, with which they treat Men, who are unjustly Stigmatiz'd with the Name of <HI>Whig.</HI> This word al∣so contains in it a <HI>Flout</HI> and a <HI>Jeer,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
unworthy to be cast upon any Man, that has Sense and Wit enough, together with his Honour and Honesty, to be engaged in Go∣vernment. For as the word <HI>Whig</HI> signifies Sower <HI>Butter-Milk,</HI> so it also comprehends <HI>Whey,</HI> which is nothing but the <HI>Water</HI> of the <HI>Milk,</HI> that is left after the Cheese is made; and carrys with it a very Flat and Insipid Tast. This is only in plain <HI>English</HI> to call wise Men <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Blockheads,</HI> and when such opprobrious and pernicious Names shall be publickly applied by a vile sort of People, to reach those by whose Council and Laws we are to be rul'd, and this go off with Im∣punity, Government will at last be brought into Contempt, and the Nation to Ruin and Destruction.</P>
<P>Nor does the Word <HI>Tory</HI> carry in it less Venom and Malice, it bear∣ing no better an Explanation than that of a <HI>Bog-Trotter,</HI> or <HI>Irish Robber;</HI> a Fellow that lives by <HI>Vagrancy,</HI> and upon the <HI>Spoils</HI> he takes from Honest Men. So that according to the Etymology of the Word, he that is a <HI>Tory,</HI> will stick at no manner of
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
Wickedness to enrich himself, and whatsoever he lays his Hand upon, 'tis his own. He was to bring in the <HI>Pretender,</HI> if he could have got any thing by it, and to have kept our Present <HI>Sovereign</HI> from his Crown and Kingdom, which were his just and lawful Right, and all this to have carried on his own Private Interest. Thief-like he was to rob the Nation of what he could, and live upon the common Plunder. This I take to be the Litteral Sense of a <HI>Tory,</HI> or an <HI>Irish</HI> Robber.</P>
<P>And now what a woful Con∣dition is Poor <HI>England</HI> reduced to, that according to this odious distin∣ction she has not one Honest Man left; For we are brought to this unhappy Dilemma, that we must be either <HI>Whig</HI> or <HI>Tory;</HI> and he that is either of these, if we consider the Natural Signification, or the com∣mon Acceptation of the words, can neither be a Man of Loyalty to his Prince, nor Honesty to his Country. For the Words themselves contain in them nothing but <HI>Villany</HI> and <HI>Dis∣honesty,</HI> and the different Parties damn each other for <HI>Knaves</HI> and
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<HI>Rascals.</HI> Now if these things were true, we could not be far from a Ge∣neral Destruction; and if our Unna∣tural Divisions did not by their na∣tural consequences ruin us, yet we must expect, that our <HI>Fatal End</HI> should very soon come to pass by some Remarkable Judgment; For <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> were destroyed for the want of ten Righteous Per∣sons, and if we must be all <HI>Whigs</HI> or <HI>Tories,</HI> we must then be consum'd for want of one Honest Man; for according to the common cry, 'tis impossible to be Honest of any Party.</P>
<P>But thanks be to Providence we are at present in Being, and may be Safe and Happy under his Majesty's Government; for plain it is, that our distinction is only ill Names misap∣plied, and the best Men of the Na∣tion are abus'd by false Characters, that are fixt upon them under the colour of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> I humbly conceive that there are both Knaves and Honest Men, Fools and Wise Men of both Parties; and therefore 'tis not the <HI>Name,</HI> but the <HI>Man</HI> that makes him to be what he is. 'Tis
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
not being of this or that Party, but his Personal Merits or Faults, which render him Worthy or Unworthy; And if a Man, by being of any of these two Parties, can discharge his Duty to his King, Church, and Country, as I shall prove he may, He justly deserves our good Esteem and Commendation, let him be a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory.</HI> Such a one is a Loy∣al Subject to his Sovereign, a Duti∣ful Son of the Church, and a true Patriot of his Country. Such Loy∣alty and Honesty will Shine thro' the thickest Cloud of Scandal and Malice, and the basest Artifices can∣not hurt the Reputation of so good a Man. <HI>His House shall not fall, tho' the Winds blow, the Rain fall and the Floods come, for it is founded upon a Rock.</HI></P>
<P>And as this Distinction of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> will render Men suspected by their King and Country, so it makes them Enemies to the Esta∣blish'd Religion; for according to the receiv'd Maxims of Scandal a∣mongst us, He that is a <HI>Tory,</HI> is a <HI>Pa∣pist,</HI> and He that is a <HI>Whig</HI> is a <HI>Dissenter.</HI> Whereas there is no more
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
Truth in any one of these Asserti∣ons, than if a Man was to say the Grand Seignior is a good Chri∣stian, or that the Moon is made of a Green Cheese.</P>
<P>But the design of Party-Men is not Truth, but to abuse each other, and like <HI>Billinsgate</HI>-Orators, they that make the greatest noise, and call the foulest names, get the better of it, and come off with Flying Co∣lours. 'Tis an excellent Remedy against the Spleen, to hear a <HI>Whig</HI> in the Coffee-House railing against a <HI>Tory,</HI> and damning him for all the <HI>Papist-Rogues,</HI> and <HI>Villains</HI> he can think off: and then have a Second Person commend him for his Railery, and say that this Man is a <HI>very. Honest worthy Gentleman, a good</HI> Protestant, <HI>a true Friend to the</HI> Ha∣nover-<HI>Succession;</HI> just as if a Man could give no better a Demonstrati∣on of his Honesty, Religion and Loyalty to his Sovereign, than by abusing his Fellow Subject and ma∣king him appear blacker than the Devil himself. So again the <HI>Tory</HI> damns the <HI>Whig</HI> for a <HI>Fanatical Dog,</HI> and a <HI>Presbyterian Rascal,</HI> and then
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
his Brother-<HI>Tory</HI> applauds him for a True Church-Man. And notwith∣standing the mighty Zeal of these two great opposite Saints, you may shake them both in a Bag, and he that comes out first is the honestest Man. For I have heard many a <HI>Tory-Rory-Boy</HI> drink a Health to the Church, Swear and Bully for the Church; nay one said, he laid with his Neighbours Wife, that he might get her to persuade her Husband to vote for the Church; and yet none of these come to Church, ex∣cept it be to see a Mistress, or meet a Friend to drink a bottle of Wine, after Evening Service. So again the <HI>Sly Whig,</HI> he returns God thanks for our late deliverance from Popery and Arbitrary Power; he Prays, and Cants; he never drinks a Dish of Tea at the Coffee-House, but pulls of his Hat, lifts up his Eyes and Hands, and says a Formal Grace o∣ver his Liquor. As soon as it is dark, he slips out into the street, picks up a Lady of the Town, goes to the Tavern, gets Drunk, and falls a sleep. Madam takes his Watch and
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
his Rings, drinks his Health silently, withdraws and makes her Hasty <HI>Exit incognito.</HI></P>
<P>Now these are some of your great Party-Men, which are stick∣lers for the Church and Religion, <HI>In nomine Domini incipit omne malum,</HI> while others contend for Liberty and Property. These in short are those, that are call'd by some of both Parties, the Patriots of their Country, whom I should style, ac∣cording to the best Skill that I have in Rhethorick, <HI>Monsters</HI> and <HI>Scan∣dals</HI> of their Country. But not∣withstanding this sort of <HI>Glorious</HI> Men, yet there are not wanting Persons of both Parties, who are neither <HI>Papists</HI> nor <HI>Dissenters,</HI> Rakes nor Hypocrites; but are a credit to the Establish'd Religion, Good Sub∣jects to his present Majesty, and true Friends to their Country. What shall we say of these <HI>Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Tories;</HI> and 'tis undeniably true, there are such of both Parties, who are Men of unspotted Reputation, with respect to their Morals; Men who never go to Meetings, but con∣stantly frequent the Church, and
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
have the Common Prayer daily read in their Families; shall we de∣ny any of these to be <HI>Church-Men,</HI> notwithstanding there be some of them <HI>Whigs.</HI> Give me leave to say, there <HI>are Church-Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Church-To∣ries, Honest Whigs,</HI> and <HI>Honest Tories, Whigs Rogues,</HI> and <HI>Rogues Tories, Good</HI> and <HI>Bad of both Sorts.</HI> Let us then no longer abuse any one for his name, but look upon the Man, ex∣amine his Merits or Faults, and ac∣cording to them pass our Judgment. If we find any one just and honest, in his common dealings, living peace∣ably and quietly under the Govern∣ment, giving no disturbance upon any account whatsoever, but con∣tributing his utmost Endeavours, either privately or publickly, to the Good of the King, Church and Country; He is a valuable Man, let him be a <HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Tory.</HI> Whereas some carry on their private Interest, and for this would Sacrifice the pub∣lick Good, they would sell the Na∣tion for their own Advantage, and like a certain L—d run away with the Money, when they have done. When they Dance, they make o∣thers
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
pay the Fidler, and when they let us into the Secret, they leave us in the Lurch; they never call us till the Reckoning comes to be paid, and while we are for making every Man pay his Club, these Sharpers slip off and give us the Go-by. Now such State-Juglers as these, let them be of what Party soever, are Ene∣mies to the Country, and ought not to be skreen'd by any sort of People; they make Honest Men of their own Party suffer in their Reputation, for we are apt to think, that one Scabby Sheep will infect the whole Flock; therefore both Parties should purge themselves of such Knaves, and bring them to their Condign Punishment, and not shew them a∣ny Favour upon the Account of their pretended Principles; And this would be the way to do all honest Men Justice of what Party soever; and Demonstrate, that the name of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> is only an odious di∣stinction, to create Fears and Jea∣lousies amongst People; and that on both Sides there are to be found Men of Worth and Probity, both with Respect to Church and State.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="15"/>
When therefore any Men are call'd to an Account, let us not be such Fools, as first to run Mad our selves, and then disturb the whole Nation by Tumults and Insurrecti∣ons; because they who are Im∣peach d and should come to a Legal Tryal, are of this or that Party. Consider not the Party, but the Per∣sons, not their Principles, with re∣spect to <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> but their A∣ctions. And as they are good or bad, so let them fall or stand. We should think it very hard, that a Man should be hang'd upon the Ac∣count of his Profession, because he was a Tinker, a Chimney-Sweeper or a Pedler: And we should esteem it as unreasonable for all the Bakers in <HI>London,</HI> to rise up in Arms, a∣gainst the Lord-Mayor, because he order'd one of that Honest Fraterni∣ty, who was suspected for a Cheat, to be tryed according to Law. We are got into the very same State, for Party-Men condemn the contra∣ry Side, purely for opposition-sake; nor will they suffer any of their own Political Perswasion to be brought
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
to Examination upon any Terms whatsoever.</P>
<P>The Conduct of a great Man cannot be enquired into, but pre∣sently the Mob Rise, and they must make themselves Judges of the Case; and what is still worse, punish the Innocent for fear of Justice or Inju∣stice done to the suspected Crimi∣nals. What occasion could there be for any true <HI>Englishman,</HI> to make a disturbance, because of the late Im∣peachments. If the Persons Im∣peach'd were guilty of the crimes laid to their charge, then they deserve Punishment; if Innocent, then they would be acquitted and come off with Honour. And why could we not without molesting the Govern∣ment, let them come to a fair Try∣al, and take their Fate, as we do by Men of less Note?</P>
<P>But then the cry of these Incen∣diaries is, that right or wrong, those Noble Peers were to lose their Heads to satisfy the other Party.</P>
<P>This is a most impudent arraing∣ing the Highest Court of Judicature, and a malicious Suspicion of Inju∣stice, where the highest Justice ought to be found. But admit
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
for Argument-sake, the Case to be as bad, as malice can make it; And that these Lords would have suffer'd unjustly; would this justify a Re∣bellion, in which Ten Thousand Lives, and many more might be lost, and an Ocean of Blood split? Are we to Sacrifice a Million for the Preservation of two or three, and destroy a whole Nation, to save so small a number? Does the well be∣ing of this Kingdom depend upon an <HI>Ox—d,</HI> or an <HI>Or—d,</HI> and are we then to venture our All, to secure them? we could have run no Danger in suffering any one of these to come to their Trial, but we may ruine our selves by endeavouring to hinder it? Far be it from every good Man's Heart, to wish harm to his Fellow Christian and Subject, And Pity is it that a single Hair of any one's Head should be hurt wrongfully; but still we are not to make our selves obnoxious to the Laws upon a bare Suspicion of o∣thers suffering unjustly, and hinder the course of Justice for fear of In∣justice.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="18"/>
Should any one undeservedly lose his Life, let the Blood lie at their doors, who shed it; but let not those who are not Judges, assume to themselves that Office, nor fly in the Face of Authority.</P>
<P>We shall find it to be the best and safest Politicks, to live in Peace and Union, and Subjection to the Civil Power; and that it will not be worth our while to distract the Nation about this or that Person, one Party or the other.</P>
<P>We may see, by what has al∣ready happen'd, the ill Consequen∣ces of our unhappy Divisions, Knock∣ing one another on the Head, pul∣ling down Houses, and rebelling a∣gainst their Lawful Soveraign. And now after all, what have they got by it? Why truly as they have been a Pack of Asses, so they are like to bear the Burden for their Pains. They have put the Government un∣der a necessity of raising new For∣ces, and the Nation must be at the Charges; they have made the Le∣gislative Power, Publish severe Laws against Riots, and thus they have made Rods for their own
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
Backs: And now they complain of severities and hard usage; but who was the occasion of these things, if they be so, but themselves.</P>
<P>A desperate Distemper must have a desperate cure, and mad Dogs must have Medicines proper for their Madness. If People won't go to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> drink Water-Gruel, pick straws, and live in a dark Room, let them walk soberly and quietly about the Streets, and hurt no Body, and the Government will never meddle with them; but if they are snappish and snarling, they must be snapt up themselves; if they grin and catch People by the Heels, they must be kick't off. If they run raving and crying out in the street, the <HI>Pretender,</HI> they must be seized on, and be secur'd; as you would do a mad Man, who calls out <HI>Fire</HI> in the mid'st of the Night, only to awake and disturb the Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>And therefore I wonder at those, who exclaim against suspending the <HI>Habeas-Corpus</HI>-Act for a small Time. They are very much concern'd, and immoderately griev'd for the loss
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
of <HI>Liberty;</HI> this they say was the Subject's Barrier, and ought to be kept Sacred and Inviolate. But if this be taking away the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Subject, 'twas not done, before the Subject destroy'd the Peace of the Kingdom, which ought to be preserv'd as <HI>Sacred,</HI> as any of their <HI>Liberties;</HI> And therefore if they won't lose the one, let them not destroy the other. When the whole Nation was in an uproar, 'twas Time to think of some Expedient to quell the Insurrection, and in Ex∣tremity 'tis excusable and lawful to do then, what would not be ju∣stifiable at another Time; when a Fire is in a Street, 'tis very common to blow up one Man's House, to save the rest, and tho' that Man looses his Property, yet this is al∣lowable, and is a common Practice without being condemn'd by any.</P>
<P>But dear Fellow-Subjects, let not your Blood boil too high, nor cast your selves into such a violent Fever, but let this consideration moderate your Heat and allay your Passion. The Parliament who took off this
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
Act, are as much concern'd in it as your selves, by the way of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property;</HI> and 'tis humbly pre∣sum'd, have as much to loose as any of those, who condemn this Sus∣pension; so that you may rest satis∣fied, that they took care of them∣selves, and by consequence of all o∣ther Subjects. The Commons of <HI>England,</HI> don't pay so great Com∣pliment to the Prerogative, as to give up their Privileges by way of Civility. The Whigs always us'd to be blam'd for the quite contrary Practices, when they were out of Power, they were counted the great Patriots of <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property;</HI> and don't think, they have lost their Senses, because they have got their former Places. This was only as I said before, an Expedient made use of, when in Extremity, and is only for a certain Time, and not a standing Act: For while the Nation is in such a Confusion, and there are so many Enemies to the present Government, they must make use of Extraordinary means to secure such from doing mis∣chief. If those who are publickly
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
raising Mobs, and acting in the <HI>Pretender</HI>'s Interest, should not be confind to Prison, when taken in the Act, but admitted to Bail, and go abroad, they are as capable of doing as much Harm then, as be∣fore; And therefore the Parliament were under a Necessity of making some new Law for the Confine∣ment of such Enemies to the King and Country. But as soon as ever our Tumults are over, and the Na∣tion is settled, never fear Old <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI> but thou shalt have all thy <HI>Liberties</HI> restor'd, and enjoy more than your Soul can desire.</P>
<P>But now Gentlemen, consider what an Influence your disturban∣ces at Home, have had upon the People abroad, we have been threat∣ned with an Invasion, and great Pre∣parations were made for a Descent. In good Faith have a care of your selves, lay aside all Party-Divisions and unite together against the Com∣mon Enemy; or else you'll have your <HI>Liberty</HI> taken from you, more than by the Suspension of the <HI>Habeas-Cor∣pus</HI> Act. Wooden Shoos, <HI>French</HI>-Government,
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
Arbitrary Power, <HI>Po∣pish</HI> Slavery; <HI>Turn</HI> or <HI>Burn</HI> will be your Motto; all these will fall much heavier upon you, than what you feel now. Therefore play not the Fool, but submit to the present Gov∣ernment, and know when you are well. The <HI>Pretender</HI> may give you a great many fine Flattering words; he may tell you, he won't break in upon the Constitution of your Church and State; but you are madder than <HI>March-Hares,</HI> and more distracted than <HI>Bedlamites,</HI> if you believe him. You may strive to get him over; but if you don't catch a Tartar, I'll give you my Grand-mother for a Maid. Mr. <HI>Lesley</HI> gives him a very fine Chara∣cter, the prettiest Gentleman, as e∣ver Eyes beheld; but what is it for, why to extirpate the <HI>Protestant</HI> Religion, and introduce Popery? no says that Gentleman, the <HI>Pretender</HI> will fill up no vacant Bishopricks, but with such Men, whom the <HI>Protestant</HI>-Bishops of this Kingdom shall recommend; which to be sure, will not be <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> and therefore the Church will never be
<PB N="23" REF="24"/>
in danger by him. <HI>A Bite all over,</HI> For who'll take a <HI>Papist's</HI> word, who is bound by the Tenets of his Reli∣gion, to fulfill no promise to <HI>Prote∣stants,</HI> and hold no Faith with <HI>He∣reticks.</HI> We have had too much of the Father, to believe the <HI>Pretender,</HI> if he be King <HI>James</HI>'s Son. That unfortunate Prince was as well be∣lov'd once, as ever any Monarch that sate upon the <HI>English</HI> Throne; and had he kept his Coronation-Oath, he had made both himself and People Happy, and <HI>England</HI> a Glo∣rious Nation. But how long did he keep it, just as long as a Woman can keep a Secret, which is to divulge it to the next She meets? As soon as ever he had an opportunity, he broke his Promise, and that made his Reign so short and transitory. Poor unhappy and misguided Man, he stuck at nothing, that promoted the Mother-Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> and <HI>Magna Charta</HI> was no more to him, than <HI>Magna Farta. Popish</HI> Chapels must be built, and <HI>Protestant</HI> Bishops imprison'd, and the Penal Laws and Test must be taken off, and the whole Constitution of Church and
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
State subverted: <HI>Jehu</HI> like he drove on as fast as he could, and when he found the Kingdom was too hot to hold him, he mounted his <HI>Pegasus,</HI> and rid Post away to <HI>France;</HI> when he came there, he told his Brother <HI>Lewis,</HI> that he had lost three King∣doms upon the account of Religion. But his most Christian Majesty, like a Pious good Prince, answer'd him, that before he would loose three Kingdoms for Religion, they should never know of what Religion he was. How far we may depend up∣on the word of a <HI>Popish</HI>-Prince, I leave it to any one to say, who knows what was done here in <HI>En∣gland</HI> between twenty eight, and one and thirty years ago.</P>
<P>Since then 'tis plain, that there is no dependance upon the word of a <HI>Popish</HI>-Prince, we are infatuated to the last degree, if ever we trust one again. The First Time we are cheated, 'tis the deceivers Fault, but the Second 'tis our own, therefore let us be so wise, as not to be catch't twice in the same Snare. All the Assu∣rances and Warrants, that the <HI>Pre∣tender</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
gives of keeping his Word, you may be certain, they are Seal'd with Butter, which no sooner comes to the Fire Ordeal, but it melts, and slides away; as soon as ever you come to try him, he will flinch immediately, and fly of from his Promise. He is as slippery as an Eale; you can't tell where to take him to keep your hold; He has as many Evasions to falsify his Promise; as he has Promises to make: He'll break thro' an Oath, as fast as any Woman can break thro' her Matrimonal Vow. If he gives you Sweet Meat, you may be sure to have Sower Sawce along with it, for many know, the Bondage and Slavery of a <HI>Popish</HI> Gov∣ernment; you that have now the Bible to read, and can make as many different Religions out of it, as you will, must then be contented with Oral Tradition and Implicit Faith. Consider that you will loose the pleasure of running from Church to Meeting, and from Meeting to Church; that you will be debarr'd of having your Itching Ears pleas'd by the Slight and Cun∣ning
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
devices of Men, and this will not be grateful to those who are pleas'd with Novelties, and Love Variety. When ever you have any Thoughts of a <HI>Pretender,</HI> believe that you are out of order; consult a Physician, let him feel your Pulse, and 'tis ten to one, but he prescribes Bleeding and Purging, &amp;c. And when you have done this to the Purpose, and gone thro' the whole course of the Doctors Pre∣scription, I dare engage, you are cur'd of desiring to have the <HI>Preten∣der.</HI></P>
<P>But to speak more seriously to the Point, should the <HI>Pretender</HI> ever come to rule here, as God forbid, the Religion of the Church of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> which is Pure, Primitive, and Apostolical, must give way to ano∣ther, whose Principles are errone∣ous, and will endanger our Salvati∣on. We cannot live under him, without offering Violence to our Consciences, and contradicting our Reason; for in the First place we must be Perjured, breaking thro' our Baptismal Vow, and Renounce our Holy Faith; we must embrace
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
all the Absurdities, and Contradi∣ctions that are contain'd in the <HI>Ro∣mish</HI>-Creed. We must believe Transubstantiation, tho' it be a plain Imposition upon our Senses and contrary to the Laws of Na∣ture. We must turn Idolaters by Worshipping Idols, and praying to Saints, Martyrs and Confessors, We must have many Intercessors, which must be multiplied to a very high degree; tho the Scriptures ad∣mit but of one Mediator and Ad∣vocate <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> In short we must be Priest-rid even to Death. For their Clergy will be Masters of our Souls and Bodies, our Lives and Fortunes, our Liberties and Pri∣vileges. And thus Gentlemen you see how you are Labouring to work out your Destruction and Ruin, by quarrelling about the names of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory.</HI> Had you not better sit down and be quiet, where every Man may enjoy himself un∣der his own Vine, and make his House his Castle.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="29"/>
But pray Gentlemen, what makes you uneasy under the present Gov∣ernment; you have a King, who is a True Father of his Country, and treats his Subjects like Chil∣dren. He grants you all the Indul∣gences imaginable, you may be Safe under his Protection and Hap∣py under his Government. And if we can but enjoy our Liberties, both Religious and Civil, what can we desire more. So long as we possess these, what need we trou∣ble our Heads, what Ministry his Majesty chooses, or what Parlia∣ment we have, let them be <HI>Whigs</HI> or <HI>Tories.</HI> Confound me Gen∣tlemen, if I know what you mean by that distinction. I go to Church, and there I find Men, that are call'd <HI>Whigs,</HI> and those that are distinguish'd by the Name of <HI>To∣ries;</HI> they all joyn in the same Wor∣ship, and make the same Responses; I look to see whether there is any difference in there Prayer-Books; I peep into a Whiggish Common-Prayer-Book, and after that I cast my Eye over a Tory-Common-Prayer-Book,
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
and if you'll believe me, they are all the same, and all Publish'd by the Authority of the Government. Then again I hear such a Minister is a <HI>Whig,</HI> and such a Clergy-Man is a <HI>Tory;</HI> then I ask, whether both the Whiggish and Tory-Clergy-Men be all ordain'd by <HI>Protestant</HI> Bishops; whether they Subscribe to the Nine and Thirty Articles, and the Canons of the Church; whether they all use the Common Prayer, and pray for King <HI>George,</HI> the Prince, the Princess and the Royal Family; upon Examination it appears they do conform to all these Particulars. This is enough to persuade me, that <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Whigs</HI> in general are the same, and that both are Church of <HI>En∣gland</HI>-Men; when therefore <HI>Tories</HI> are call'd <HI>Papists,</HI> and <HI>Whigs Dissen∣ters,</HI> I am apt to think there is more Malice than Truth. When I speak of <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> I mean only such of both sorts, who publickly profess themselves to be Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and con∣form to her Doctrin and Worship,
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
and the present Government; of these there are Men of both sorts, who are Good Church Men.</P>
<P>If I would take to my self a∣ny of these Names, <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> I would be both; the Rea∣der will say, what do you mean by this, are you run mad too with your Inconsistencies and Con∣tradiction? What has touch't your Noddle? A Man may think this to be very odd and surprizing, that 'tis a Thing impossible, see∣ing that these two Parties agree like Fire and Water, Cats and Dogs, that are always scratching and clawing, biting and tearing one Another; But for the same Man to be <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> is as common, as it is for a <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> to fall out and quarrel, and the wisest of the Nation are so, I question not, but I have fill'd the Reader with Expectati∣on, and that he wants this Rid∣dle to be explain'd. Well, that I may keep you no longer in sus∣pence; that you may not bite
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
your Nails, scratch your Head, stamp upon the Ground, and all this to know my meaning, I'll tell you in a few Words. For a Man to be both a <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> and be a good Man into the Bargain, is to be a <HI>Whig</HI> in State, and a <HI>Tory</HI> in Church; this is what your best States-men are, and what the wisest and Honestest part of the Nation have practic'd. Most of those who are call'd <HI>To∣ries,</HI> have come into the Revoluti∣on, that was founded upon <HI>Whig∣ish</HI> Principles, and so long as they have conform'd to the Governments of those Crown'd Heads, that have reign'd since that happy Time, so long they have in Fact been <HI>Whigs.</HI> So likewise these, as well as a great many profess'd <HI>Whigs,</HI> have been constant Communicants in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> have been Advocates for all its Rites an Ce∣remonies, Doctrin and Worship, and true Friends to Episcopacy and Monarchy. In this they have been <HI>Tories.</HI> So that you see to be a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Tory,</HI> is neither a
<PB N="32" REF="33"/>
Contradiction nor a Discommen∣dable Practice; so far from it that 'tis the Duty of every <HI>English</HI> Sub∣ject, and 'tis the Constitution of the present Establishment. I mean no more by a <HI>Whig,</HI> than one that is for the Revolution, and admits King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Anne</HI> to have been our Lawful Soveraigns, and his present Majesty now up∣on the Throne, to be our rightful King. This is all that your <HI>Church Whigs</HI> contend for, and this is no less than what the <HI>Tories</HI> in Pra∣ctice comply with, how much so∣ever their words may contradict their Actions. And therefore we see that <HI>Church-Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories</HI> are all the same, and we may u∣nite and agree together, without the least Scruple of Consci∣ence.</P>
<P>I am sure <HI>Conscience,</HI> if it be a good one, will bind us to this U∣nion; but I am afraid, where Par∣ty-business is greatest, there <HI>Consci∣ence</HI> and <HI>Honesty</HI> are kick't out of Doors, and have least to do. This
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
Word <HI>Conscience</HI> puts me in mind of a Story concerning a Judge to an Evidence, the latter had a ve∣ry large Beard, which the former reflected upon; says the Judge who had a smooth Face, and little or no Beard, <HI>if your Conscience be like your Beard, 'tis a very large one,</HI> and replied the Witness, <HI>if your Lordships Conscience be like your Beard, you have none at all.</HI> I am afraid the case is much the same betwixt <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> when they grow Noisy and Mutinous. The <HI>Whig,</HI> while he is shewing his Zeal for the cause, he forgets common Cha∣rity and Christianity, and lays on upon the <HI>Tory</HI> most unmercifully. The <HI>Tory</HI> on the other Hand is so much enrag'd with the Zeal of Pas∣sive-Obedience, that he makes In∣surrections, and Flies into open Re∣bellion against the King and Go∣vernment; so that in short the vio∣lent Men of both Parties are Mad. Politicks are grown so ripe now, that you may hear more at <HI>Wapping,</HI> than at St. <HI>James</HI>'s. A Female-Ale-House-Keeper
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
in those Parts, had mixt so much of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>To∣ry</HI> among her <HI>Mild</HI> and <HI>Stale,</HI> that made her Tongue run most extra∣vagantly against the Government, she could not forbear cursing his Majesty: But as she could not confine her Tongue, the Magi∣strates have justly confin'd her in <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>People should have a care how they speak Evil of Dignities and de∣spise Government, for this is a Di∣stemper that has infected the Men more than the Women, who are the weaker Vessels. They must be very weak, be they Males or Fe∣males, who reflect upon the higher Powers. St. <HI>Jude</HI> calls them Filthy Dreamers that defile the Flesh, speaking Evil of those things they know not, they shall Perish in the gainsaying of <HI>Core,</HI> who rebelled against their Superiors <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>A∣ron.</HI> Clouds they are without Wa∣ter, carried about by the high
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
Winds of <HI>Jacobitism,</HI> and Trees, whose Fruit withereth. <HI>Raging Waves of the Sea Foaming of their own Shame, and wandring Stars, for whom is reserved the Blackness of Darkness for ever.</HI> These are Mur∣murers, Complainers, walking after their own Lusts, and their Mouth sendeth forth great Swelling Words, having Mens Persons, <HI>especially that of the Pretender,</HI> in Admiration, be∣cause of Advantage. These I look upon to be rank <HI>Jacobites,</HI> who curse his Majesty; for certainly, they who wish not King <HI>George</HI> well, can desire nothing but the <HI>Preten∣der,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Government, and with these we ought never to U¦nite.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Whigs,</HI> who conform to Church and Govern∣ment, I think they are one and the same, and they differ only in Name, and 'tis ten thousand Pities, that such People should ever quar∣rel and disagree; I am sure 'tis no∣thing
<PB N="36" REF="37"/>
but for want of a good Un∣derstanding, and knowing One A∣nother better. And if it were not for some designing Knaves, who creep in among both Parties, we should be all of one mind. But these make the distinction of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory</HI> and also stigmatize one Party with the Character of <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and the other with that of <HI>Dissenters;</HI> and the Populace, not seeing thro' the design of these Artifices, are so easy as to believe these false Re∣ports, and this begets such un∣natural Divisions, and raises such a Hatred, one against the other: Whereas would Men but take of this vail of Prejudice, and view each others Principles, and Practi∣ces, as they do their naked Faces, they would not find that diffe∣rence, which designing <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories,</HI> so artfully make. Let us cast Knaves as they do at Whisk, and see who and who are together, and we shall find Honest <HI>Tories</HI> and <HI>Whigs</HI> to be the same. But if the Tares grow with the
<PB N="37" REF="38"/>
Wheat, and the Wolves mix a∣mong the Sheep, we can expect nothing but Mischief and Ruin. Let all Honest <HI>Whigs</HI> and <HI>Tories</HI> unite together against those that are Enemies to the Church and King; then we shall so castrate the Distinction of <HI>Whigism</HI> and <HI>To∣rism,</HI> that they will never be able to generate again, nor Sow the Seeds of Strife and Con∣tention. We shall purge our selves of that Bastardly Brood, and never again be Molested with that cursed Political Gene∣ration; we shall Sing old Rose, burn the Bellows, and be as hap∣py as so many Mites in a <HI>Cheshire Cheese.</HI> Now Gentlemen, if you don't find what I say to be true, and like what I have writ, you are welcome upon paying Six pence, the price of this Voluminous work, to apply externally, as an excellent cleanser of the Posteriors, or a Grand Preservative of the Bot∣toms of Pies and Tarts, from
