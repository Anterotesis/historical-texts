<HEAD>A TREATISE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems strange to me, that in a Country where Theatrical Representations are so much admired, and both Kinds of the Drama carried to so great a Perfection, the Business of the Stage should be so little un∣derstood.</P>
<P>Upon the least favourable Calculation, the Number of those called Play-Followers, can∣not be rated at less than twelve thousand in this Metropolis, and yet were I to allow the four and twentieth Part of these, a Capacity of determining on the Excellence, or Imper∣fections of a Performance, or a Performer, I am satisfied I should do the Public more than Justice.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3"/>
Nor is this Judgment the Result of Spleen or Prejudice, but founded on a Combination of Facts, which cannot have escaped the Ob∣servation of those, who are not either cursed with Ignorance, or blinded by Partiality.</P>
<P>I have seen an excellent Actor, whose Form, perhaps, has not been extremely de∣licate, or the Disposition of his Features pleasing, regarded by the Spectators with idle Eyes;
<Q><L>Thinking his Prattle to be tedious.</L></Q>
Whilst another Performer, who from some lucky Circumstance at his setting out, has ac∣quir'd the Favour of the Public, after mistak∣ing a Sentiment of <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s, made his Exit with a louder Plaudit, than is given to <HI>Caesar</HI> at his Entrance. Nor does the Madness end here, for when this Nonpareil, this Phoenix of the Imagination has been puffed as high as the Breath of Popularity can blow him,—why then his Friends, apprehensive that their little Hero's airy Castle will have a Tumble, from a Consciousness of the Weak∣ness of its Foundation, endeavour to prop it by a collateral Pillar; and now, forsooth, he is to commence Poet, he who has given so many Instances of his Taste and Judg∣ment for the best Writers must be able to compose admirably himself; wrought upon by these Adulations, the Pen is drawn, <HI>Mo∣liere, Dancour, Le Sage</HI> besieg'd, their Works ravaged, a Plot and Characters car∣ried
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
off in Triumph, and after about two Months translating, vamping, altering, turn∣ing Verse into Prose, and Prose into Verse, out comes the flimsy Piece, but no more like its Fathers than I am to <HI>Hercules.</HI> No matter for that tho', he is a great Actor, and must be of consequence a great Writer; pri∣vate Assurance has been before given that such a Thing is on the Anvil, that my Lord—, and Dr.—, and Mr.—have seen it, and pro∣nounce it great; thus the Town is prepared, and up flies the Curtain, there may be seen the poor deluded Audience with lack-lustre Eyes gazing at their <HI>Roscius,</HI> applauding as heartily, as if <HI>Nero</HI> was the Performer, and Death was to be the consequence of Dislike; at last we are dismissed, with an Invitation to the same Soop-Meagre Repast the suc∣ceeding Night, all of us in Raptures; I had the Luck to be posted in the Rear of a reverend and greasy Doctor, whose Belches of Applauses at the Moral would have cer∣tainly put (in <HI>Fribble</HI>'s Phrase) a Period to my Existence, had not I met with Relief from the fragrant Whispers of some of the softer Sex in the Boxes behind me, whose Observations, (to do them Justice) were at least as wise as the Parson's before me.</P>
<P><Q>“Well, Miss, how do ye like it? Oh! extravagantly: Lord, he is the comicallest Creature; I thought I should have died with laughing: I vow I was quite a∣sham'd.”</Q>—

<HI>John</HI> with the Chair puts an End to the lisping Prattle of the pretty Igno∣rant. Home they fly with a flaming Ac∣count to Madam; Madam tells my Lady; my Lady, my Lord; my Lord, the ***; and so bounce they all croud to the new Farce, where I shall leave them with this trite Re∣flection.</P>
<Q><L>Qui vult decipi, decipiatur.</L></Q>
<P>And here I am apprehensive least the Ill∣nature and Malice of the World should ap∣ply the above Picture, from a distant Like∣ness in some inconsiderable Feature to an ad∣mired Dramatick Genius, who now resides in the Navel of this Metropolis. Oh fye! no such thing; by the Theology of the <HI>Hot∣tentots</HI> I swear 'tis no such Matter: Alack-a-day, the Man I mean was dead before the other was born; he was indeed once a bright Star that held his Place on high: But, rest his Soul, he has not been one of us these thirty years.</P>
<P>But effectually to destroy the Appearance of any Analogy between the two Gentle∣men, and at the same time do Justice to the Character of the aforesaid Dramatick Genius, whose Reputation has been villainously tra∣duced by some evil-minded People, I shall set the World right with regard to a cruel
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
Mistake that it has eagerly adopted for this Month past.</P>
<P>It has been proclaimed at Market-Crosses, and industriously whispered, even in Churches, that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> was the Author of a paltry Farce, lately exhibited, call'd, <HI>Miss in her Teens.</HI> Oh! nothing so false; for not to mention how improbable it is, that so judicious, correct, and lively a Genius would produce so contemptible and misera∣ble a Work, I happen to be in the Secret, and can trace the Rise and Progress of the Farce.</P>
<P>The Original came over, accompanied by a Kitt, in the interior Pocket of a Refugee from <HI>Rochelle.</HI> This Gentleman, by an In∣vitation from the Mayor and Magistrates of <HI>Sutton Cowfield juxta Litchfield,</HI> has long rejoic'd in the double Vocation of instructing the Masters and Misses of that Corporation in the Arts of speaking <HI>French,</HI> and handling their Legs; his leisure Hours, in order to perfect himself in our Language, were em∣ploy'd in translating the <HI>Parisiene</HI> of <HI>Dancour.</HI> The Parson of the Parish hap∣pened to get a View of the Work, and thinking our Hero an extraordinary Genius in the rapid Acquisition of Tongues, trans∣mitted the Piece to the Head of St. <HI>M—y-H—ll, O—d.</HI> Dr. <HI>K—g</HI> knowing it would suit the Taste and Genius of the B—p of <HI>L—ff,</HI> inclos'd it to that reverend P—e.
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
The B—p was infinitely pleas'd with the Moral and Matter, but a little puzzled as to the Poetry: <HI>S—n D-k</HI>'s Judgment was called in to determine that Point, who happen∣ing to shew it to his Patroness my Lady <HI>T</HI>—, she being a Critick in this way, ima∣gined, that the Characters a little heightened would hit the Gusto of an English Audi∣ence; and in order to do the Piece as much Justice as possible, assign'd the Care of the different Parts to different Genius's. To Mr. <HI>Russel</HI> she committed the comical ones, such as <HI>Fribble</HI> and <HI>Flash;</HI> the Tragical, such as Miss and her Father, and indeed all the other Personages of the Drama, to the Conduct of <HI>S—n D—k.</HI> How far this Triumvirate, this <HI>Augustus, Lepidus,</HI> and <HI>Anthony</HI> of the Republick of Letters, have succeeded in their Attempt, I submit to the Judgment of eighteen different Audi∣ences; different I call them, for I have still so much Charity for the publick Taste as to suppose, that no one Man has seen the Farce twice.</P>
<P>Thus much for Preface, and now for the ge∣neral Design of this Treatise, which is merely calculated to open the Eyes of the Injudicious, and by tracing the Rise and Progress of the Passions, together with their Effects on the Or∣gans of our Bodies, enable them to judge how far the Imitation of those Passions on the Stage be natural, and give them not only an Oppor∣tunity
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
of being rationally pleased, but of communicating to others, why they are so.</P>
<P>I have often heard complaints, and that from Men of allowed Understanding, that their Knowledge was a Burthen to them, that they were never half so happy, as when every Trifle gave them Pleasure, when they could laugh with equal Satisfaction at a <HI>Yates,</HI> as a <HI>Macklin.</HI> But if you examine the in∣trinsic Worth of these Men, you will soon dis∣cover, that they have but barely sipp'd of the Fountain of Knowledge, or else were design∣ed by Nature, as mere Parentheses, that the World might either do with, or without; but from a partial Mistake of their Parents, have been sent to acquire what they can never obtain.</P>
<Q><L>And so bewildered in the Maze of Schools,</L>
<L>They turn out Coxcombs, Nature meant but Fools.</L></Q>
<P>I am not so old, but I can well remember the Time, when <HI>Hippesley,</HI> gave me as much pleasure as <HI>Johnson; Hurlo-Thrumbo,</HI> as <HI>Ho∣race;</HI> but I am not a jot displeas'd at the Improvement of my Taste, and as I have strongly at Heart the Welfare of every Indivi∣dual, do, from the bottom of my Soul, wish that all those to whom Wisdom is burthen∣some, were for their own Happiness, and the Good of Mankind, what they seem de∣sirous
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
of being, absolute Ideots, Blanks in the Creation.</P>
<P>On these Owlets, whose Eyes are too weak to sustain the Shock of Light, I turn my Back, and address myself to those Eagles who are willing to soar, and have Organs capable of surveying the Sun in its Meridian, with them we will endeavour to explore the hid∣den Sources of those Passions, which either deform or dignify the Master-piece of the Creation, and attempt a Description of their fatal Consequences, or salutary Effects.</P>
<P>The word Passion is applied to the different Motions and Agitations of the Soul, ac∣cording to the different Objects, that pre∣sent themselves to the Senses; how or by what means this mutual Action, or Com∣munication between Soul and Body is effect∣ed, remains a Secret to us; all our Attempts to resolve it into any thing prior, or more simple have been fruitless and ineffectual, ex∣cept we refer to the immediate Will and A∣gency of the first Cause itself. As all, who have hitherto treated on the Passions, are puzzled about their Number and Division, I shall not attempt the Discovery of a Secret which has eluded the Searches of so many Philosophers, but content myself with the ordinary Distribution, <HI>viz.</HI> into the Passions of Desire, such as Pleasure, Pain, Love, Ha∣tred, &amp;c. and the irascible ones, namely, Courage, Anger, Despair, &amp;c. but the most
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
natural Division of them in my Judgment, is into painful and pleasureable, and in this Sense, all the Passions may be reduced to Love and Hatred, nay perhaps to one, Love; and even that may be altogether resolved in∣to Self-Love, and this into a Principle of Self-Preservation, or necessary invincible Desire of Pleasure or Happiness. The rest are only Ri∣vulets from this Source, or special Applications of this Principle to particular Occasions, thus, the Desire of any thing under the Appearance of its Goodness, Suitableness, or Necessity; so our Happiness constitutes the Passion of Love; the Desire of avoiding any thing apprehended to be mischievous or hurtful, constitutes Hatred or Aversion; the Desire of a Good, which at the same time appears probable, and in our Reach constitutes Hope, but if the Good appear improbable, difficult, or impossible it constitutes Fear or Despair; the unexpected Ratification of a Wish creates Joy. The Desire of Happiness to another in Affliction is Compassion; the Desire of another's Punishment, Revenge, or Malice. The single Desire of Happiness, then, is the Spring and Motive of all our Passions, as those are of all our Actions, but as it is impos∣sible to persue the Subject before us, with∣out being to metaphysical and abstracted for every Comprehension, and this Treatise is calculated for the Meridian of all Capacities, I shall at present, wave a farther Disquisition
<PB N="12" REF="11"/>
into the Origin of the Passions, and apply my self to their several Effects on the Organs of our Bodies. With the Passion of Rage, we will begin, and here it must be observed that every Passion has several Degrees, suitable to the Subject it is imployed about; the Expres∣sion of the Voice and Eyes are quick, and less violent Rage is different from the Extra∣vagance of that Passion; in the first Circum∣stance, their is a Loudness in the Tone of the Voice, a Rapidity in the Utterance, and a live∣ly Quickness in the Eye; in the last, the Vio∣lence and Force of the Passion are curbs to our natural Powers, the Voice is low, but forcible, the Utterance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lower, and an extra∣vagant Wildness in the Eye. But in every Degree of this Passion, the Muscles are contracted, and their Force encreased, whe∣ther this be occasioned by the Blood or Spirits being rapidly drove from the other Parts of the Body, to the extream and Mus∣cular ones, as the Arms, Legs and Face, we will leave to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Determination of the Physicians. We will now present you with two Instances, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n order to establish the fore∣going Observation, the first in <HI>Richard</HI> the IIId▪ the Reply of that Monarch to the Lord <HI>Stanly;</HI> take the Passage: <HI>Richard,</HI> <Q>“where are thy Forces then to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat the Enemy back?”</Q> <HI>Stanly,</HI> `my Forces are all ready in the North,' <HI>Richard,</HI> <Q>“in the North, why what do they do in the North? when they should serve their S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the West▪”</Q> here observe
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
the Execution and Judgment of Mr. <HI>G.</HI> His Imitation will give you a perfect Know∣ledge of the Effects of the first Degree of this Passion; with regard to the last, tho' the Actor has denied me his Assistance, yet the Poet has done justice to that Mode of the Mind, in the Character of <HI>Othello,</HI> <Q>“Villain be sure you prove my Love a Whore,”</Q> to that Passage, I refer the Reader. But why do I tire the Public with my trifling Obser∣vations on this Passion, when the immortal <HI>Shakespear,</HI> has so finely described the Effects of Rage, in <HI>Harry</HI> the Vth that Monarch before an Engagement, is recommending a Deportment to his Men, and advises them to imitate the Action of the Tyger, stiffen the Sinews, summons up the Blood, to lend the Eye a terrible Aspect; let it pry through the Portage of the Head, to set the Teeth, and stretch the Nostrils wide, hold hard the Breath, and bend up every Spirit to his full Height.</P>
<P>The Effects of the Passions, are so very different in different Men, and often so com∣plicated and mixed, that it would be almost impossible, to trace their several Connections, and describe their various Effects, I shall therefore bid adieu to the Subject in General, but may have many Opportunities in the Course of this Tract, to present you with occasional Observations, on the Passions, so far as they regard the particular Modes of par∣ticular Minds.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
Now let us examine how far the Conduct of the present Actors, is consistent with the foregoing Rules: But as it would be a tedious Difficulty to run through a Disquisition of the several Faults and Perfections of all the Play∣ers, who are arrived to any Degree of Excel∣lence, I shall confine myself to those alone, whom the Good or Prejudice of the Public have ranked in the first Class.</P>
<P>With <HI>G.</HI> whose great Popularity has given him a claim to the Preheminence, we will begin. And as the Eye is the Scence first gratified, or disgusted, it may not be impro∣per to enquire what kind of Prepossession a∣rises in the Mind, from the Appearance of Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. Figure, and here I am afraid frail Nature has been a little unkind, and tho' I must own I have very distinct Ideas of big and great, yet such is the Folly of the Million, that they expect a more than ordinary Ap∣pearance from a Man, who is to perform ex∣traordinary Actions; it is in vain, to tell them, that <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Sweden,</HI> was but five feet five, or <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, a very lit∣tle Man, the false Association is so deeply rooted into their Minds, that you may as well attempt to persuade them that Night and Ap∣paritions have no Connection: they are dis∣satisfied, when they see a Bulls-Pizzle, a dried Elves-Skin, in <HI>Falstaff</HI>'s Language, bullying a Congregation of Heroes, and suspect the Veracity of the Poet, when he tells them, that these Men are
<Q><PB N="15" REF="14"/>
<L>Fit to disturb the Peace of all the World,</L>
<L>And rule it when its wildest.</L></Q></P>
<P>But as the Advantage of a fine Figure, is merely an accidental Good, the Want of it should never draw an Imputation on Mr. <HI>G.</HI> especially as there is nothing offensive in the Frame and Disposition of his Body, and tho' his want of Stature, &amp;c. may lessen the Dignity of some Characters, yet its properly enough adapted for others; nay, in my Opinion, this Defect adds greatly to the Merit of <HI>G.</HI> for if by the Force of Action, he can conquer a first Prejudice, which is generally obstinate, it proves him possessed of a Genius, that few, very few Actors have been blessed with. Thus much for his Person, in the Gross, but as the Face is more essentially concerned in acting, than all the other Parts of the Body, it may not be amiss to examine how the Features of our little Hero are form'd, for what is called the Looking of a Character, his lively and pier∣cing Eyes, are particularly happy in the Ex∣pression of sudden Joy, or quick Rage; but I cannot say they convey the Passions of Love, Grief, and Horror with equal Force: as the Face is the Index of the Mind, the Voice is the Interpreter, which in Mr. <HI>G.</HI> is various, articulate and harmonious, to which, I wish I could add lasting, but to
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
the Mortification of his Hearers, it generally (in the Jockeys Phrase,) rides resty, and stops before half the Course is run.</P>
<P>Thus much for the corporal Defects or Advantages of Mr. <HI>G.</HI> let us now take a View of him in Action, and consider whe∣ther he is artful in the concealing his na∣tural Blemishes, and judicious in the Ap∣plication of his Talents; and for this Pur∣pose, it will be most convenient both to the Reader, and myself, to regard him in a single Light; let it be <HI>Lear,</HI> and I the rather chuse this Character, because Mr▪ <HI>G.</HI> where he is right, is no where so masterly.</P>
<P>The Portrait that <HI>Shakespear</HI> has given us of <HI>Lear,</HI> is that of a good hearted Man, easily provoked, impatient of Contradiction, and hasty in Resolution. The Poet him∣self, who seldom fails to direct the Actor, has thought an Apology necessary at the o∣pening of the Play, for what might appear immoral in the Conduct, or Expressions of his Hero, by laying the Blame on a natural Habit, <HI>'tis said that I am Choleric;</HI> and then, as a Testimony of the Humanity and innate Goodness of his Disposition, upon hear∣ing the tragical End of his unnatural Daugh∣ters, at the Close of the Play, this tender, this affectionate Expression is put into his Mouth.</P>
<LG>
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
<L>Ungrateful as they were,</L>
<L>Tho' the Wrongs they have heaped on me are numberless;</L>
<L>I feel a Pang of Nature for them yet.</L>
</LG>
<P>This I take to be a Sketch of <HI>Lear</HI>'s moral Character, a Circumstance that never ought to escape the View of the Actor.</P>
<P>And here, sorry I am, to set out with an Observation that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> seems quite regardless of, both <HI>Lear</HI>'s Attributes, and that at a junc∣ture too, where the Poet's Excuse is but barely sufficient, and the Player's Assistance abso∣lutely necessary; the Passage I mean, is the Curse at the End of the first Act, which in my Judgment, and I am not singular, should be utter'd with a Rage almost equal to Phren∣zy, quick and rapid as a Whirlwind, no Mark of Malice, no Premeditation, no Solemnity; the Provocation, the Persons against whom the Curse is denounced, <HI>Lear</HI>'s Character, all conspire to render such a Behaviour absurd: nor can I easily pardon the Tears shed at the Conclusion; the whole Passage is a Climax of Rage; that strange Mixture of Anger and Grief is to me highly unnatural; and besides, this unmanly Sniveling lowers the Consequence of <HI>Lear;</HI> this▪ Practice may, with Propriety, be introduced in the Imitation of a vex'd Girl, who cries because she can't (in the vulgar Tongue) gain her Ends. But dear <HI>G.</HI> get
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
your Friend <HI>H—ym—n</HI> to draw an enraged Monarch, and see whether he will make any Use of the Handkerchief: Nor can I admit the ill-judged Applause of the Multitude as a Plea for the Continuation of this Trick. The Transition from one Passion to another, by the Suddenness of the Contrast, throws a stronger Light on the Execution of the Ac∣tor; and thus the Groundlings, who are caught more by the Harmony and Power of the Voice than Propriety, are easily drawn in to applaud what must grieve the Judicious. I have been the longer on the last Particular, because it is not in this Place alone, that Mr. <HI>G.</HI> traps the Unwary by the same Bait, his unreal Mockery in <HI>Macbeth,</HI> and two memo∣rable Speeches in the first Scene of <HI>Chamont,</HI> are Instances which I hope he will hereafter never suffer to rise in Judgment against him. We all now know how the Shilling came un∣der the Candlestick, the Trick is discover'd.</P>
<P>It will now (I presume) be expected that I should, agreeable to my Promise, oppose to this Error in Mr. <HI>G.</HI> one of his Excellencies; but, for the sake of Method, permit me first to discover the Passages wherein I think him mistaken, and then we will proceed to the Recital of his Perfections without Fear of In∣terruption.</P>
<P>The next Scene in which <HI>Lear</HI> is capitally concern'd, and where I think Mr. <HI>G.</HI> some∣times
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
erroneous, is the Middle of the second Act.</P>
<P>The poor old King is introduced in a Storm, exposed to the Fury of the warring Ele∣ments, and that no Circumstance of Horror might be omitted, he is surrounded by Dark∣ness, and has no Companion in his Misery, but a Man in whom he could place no Con∣fidence, as having but just entertain'd him; and here one would think it impossible to ag∣gravate the Distress, or increase our Pity, and yet the Poet has artfully contrived to heighten both, by throwing <HI>Lear</HI> into Madness.</P>
<P>Let us now take a View of the Actor's De∣portment in this Situation; but it may not be improper first to observe, that as Madness is defin'd, to be right Reasoning on wrong Principles, there is always a Consistency in the Words and Actions of a Madman: Thus much may be gathered from a Scene naturally drawn, tho' by no means a Subject for Co∣medy, in the <HI>Pilgrim</HI> of <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s, the sot∣tish <HI>Englishman</HI> does not command the Winds and Seas, nor the Scholar call for Beer; you find the whole Group of Lunaticks employ'd on the Circumstances that first disturb'd their Imaginations; the Parson, whom possibly a long Law-Suit for Tithes had drove to Po∣verty and Despair, does not quit his Claim to a tenth Pig. But we need not have Recourse to foreign Assistance, the Subject before us will sufficiently demonstrate what we want;
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
the Use I would make of the Obfervation is, that it be a Direction to the Actor to em∣ploy his first Enquiry into the Cause of the Madness he is to represent, that his Deport∣ment may be conducted suitably therewith. For example in <HI>Lear;</HI> we find <HI>Lear</HI>'s Mind, at first, entirely possess'd with the Thoughts of his Daughters Ingratitude, which was the immediate Cause of his Distress, to this he subjoins some Reflections on the State and Na∣ture of his Afflictions, and thus far his Rea∣son holds; but when his Mind makes a far∣ther Progress, and looks back to the remote Cause, which was a voluntary Resignation of the Regal Power, then the Idea of his former Grandeur rises to his View; which, when he compares with his present Misery, and ob∣serves the Impossibility of remounting the Throne he had quitted, then his Brains turn, and his Reason forsakes him.</P>
<P>The Desire of Royalty then is the Point that distracts <HI>Lear</HI>'s Judgment; and the Be∣lief that he possesses that Royalty, the State of his Madness; all his Expressions are full of the Royal Prerogative.</P>
<LG>
<L>—I pardon that Man's Life.</L>
<L>You cannot kill me for Coining, I am</L>
<L>The King himself.</L>
<L>Ay, every Inch a King.</L>
</LG>
<P>How then is this mad Monarch to be em∣ployed in picking Straws, and boyish
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
Trifling, or in Actions more <HI>a-propos,</HI> more suitable to his imaginary Dignity, such as fre∣quent Musings, with the Finger on the Brow, as if the Welfare of Kingdoms depend∣ed on his Care, issuing Orders to his Atten∣dan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, or in some Act that expresses Regal Power; I own I am weak enough, tho' in Con∣tradiction to Mr. <HI>G.</HI> to think the last Method best; and if my Advice might be taken, every Motion▪ every Look, should express an Ex∣travagance of State and Majesty; and when mad <HI>Tom</HI> is consulted as a learned <HI>Theban: Lear</HI> should not, if he would be directed by me, pull his Rags, play with his Straws, or betray the least Mark of his knowing the real Man; but with great Solemnity, a con∣tracted Brow, one Hand on <HI>Edgar's</HI> Shoul∣der, his Finger on his Breast, or some Action that should denote Superiority, seem to con∣sult him on a knotty Point, but no Sign of Equality, no Familiarity, no sitting down Cheek by Jowl; this might be a proper Re∣presentarion of a mad Taylor, but by no means corresponds with my Idea of King <HI>Lear.</HI></P>
<P>Nor should he be less in earnest in all his Stratagems; his Project for shoeing a Troop of Horse with Felt, should be delivered with Rapture, as if he had hit on a masterly Ex∣pedient; nor would I have him express less Joy, but with a Tincture of Bitterness and Rancour, at surveying the Execution of his Scheme, when he should have it in his Power to revenge his Wrongs,
<Q><PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<L>Steal upon his Sons-in-law,</L></Q>
and then,
<Q><L>Kill, kill, kill.</L></Q></P>
<P>How far this Passage has been mistaken by Mr. <HI>G.</HI> I submit to the Judicious; and here let me add, that I will undertake to demon∣strate, that <HI>Shakespear</HI> has not put one Ex∣pression into the Mouth of <HI>Lear</HI> throughout the whole Course of his Madness, but what bears a visible Relation to the first Cause of it.</P>
<P>As these are the principal Mistakes we have to lay to Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. Charge, the Gratifica∣tion of his Enemies is at an end; his Friends may now uncloud their Brow, throw aside their Chagrin, and prepare for a Recital of his Perfections.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. whole Behaviour during the first Act (except as before excepted) is natural and masterly, the choleric Man happily marked in the Scenes with <HI>Cordelia, Kent,</HI> and at the Discovery of his eldest Daughter's Ingratitude; and indeed, wherever quick Rage is to be express'd, no Actor does the Poet so much Justice, nor is he less snccessful in tincturiug all the Passions, with a certain Feebleness suitable to the Age of the King, the Design of the Author, and the raising in the Minds of the Audience a stronger
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Feeling, and Compassion for <HI>Lear</HI>'s Suffer∣ings. And tho', in the general Conduct of the▪ mad Scenes, Mr. <HI>G.</HI> is, in my Opinion, faulty; yet in many particular Instances, his Judgment and Execution demands the highest Applause. There is a Mixture of Distraction, with the Joy, that he expresses at
<Q><L>Was it not pleasant to see a Thousand, with red-hot Spits, come hissing in upon them.</L></Q>
that I have seldom seen equall'd; nor can he be easily excell'd where the Tortures of <HI>Lear</HI>'s Mind, and the Fatigues of his Body, throw him into a Swoon, <HI>G</HI>'s Preparation is fine▪ and the Execution of the Thing itself inimitable, such a Death-like Paleness in his Countenance, such an Inactivity in his Limbs, that only <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Words can do him Justice,
<Q><L>He is indeed Death's Counterfeit.</L></Q>
Nor can I leave him without my particular Thanks for the Entertainment he has given me at his Recovery from Madness, and Re∣collection of <HI>Cordelia.</HI> The Passions of Joy, Tenderness, Grief, and Shame are blended together in so masterly a Manner, that the Imitation would do Honour to the Pencil of a <HI>Rubens,</HI> or an <HI>Angelo.</HI></P>
<P>The last Circumstance that I shall trou∣ble the Reader with, is the fatigue, weari∣ness,
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
and at the same time, soldier-like and manly Pleasure that <HI>G.</HI> expresses at having vanquished the Ministers of his inhuman Daughter's last Commands. I could add one Observation to the foregoing, but as I differ from the Actor, tho' I must own some Ar∣guments may be brought in his Defence, and I have promised to mention no more of his Faults, I shall be silent, and am, for once pleased with <HI>Tate</HI>'s Alteration of <HI>Shakespear,</HI> because it has prevented my commenting on Mr. <HI>G</HI>'s. Manner of Dying, about which, I am afraid, we should have some Disputes.</P>
<P>At last then the Task is finished, and hap∣py shall I esteem myself, if these loose Hints can contribute to improve the general Taste of the Publick, or convey the least Instruction to a very great, I wish I could add, perfect Actor.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> next claims our Attention; and as his Superiority in the Character of <HI>Othello</HI> had been universally allow'd, 'till a Caveat was entered by a young and new Actor from <HI>Dublin,</HI> it may not be unentertaining to op∣pose these great Men▪in this Part, and exa∣mine to which the Laurel is due.</P>
<P>As <HI>G</HI>'s. Person is so insignificant and trifling, <HI>Q</HI>'s. is too cumbersome and un∣weildy; as the first is deficient in Characters that require Consequence and Dignity, so is the last in those that demand Ease and Bustle.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="24"/>
<HI>G.</HI> has Variety, but wants Power, or Con∣tinuation of Voice; <HI>Q.</HI> a Monitone that sel∣dom fatigues him, but is now and then a little tiresome to his Hearers. <HI>G</HI>'s. Action is various, but sometimes extravagant; <HI>Q</HI>'s. the same in all Circumstances and Passions.</P>
<P><HI>B.</HI> has more Obligations to Nature than either of these▪ he is tall without Awkward∣ness (I mean whilst his Limbs are in a State of rest) and handsome without Effeminacy; his Voice is sweet and permanent, but the Tone too soft for the Expression of any but the tender Passions, such as Grief, Love, Pity, &amp;c. I would here consider the Dispo∣sition of the Features in these Gentlemen, but as the black Covering in this Part before us, hinders our discerning the Action of the Muscles, we cannot determine to which the Preference ought to be given, only from a general Observation, <HI>Q.</HI> would, were the Blacking removed, be most successful in the Scenes of Rage, <HI>B.</HI> in those of Tenderness.</P>
<P>Arm'd with these Weapons, the Heroes set forth in <HI>Othello; Q.</HI> from a Knowledge of the Stage, and the Happiness of a good level Voice, gets in the Opinion of the Many the first Advantage; my private Judgment, to deal freely, condemns them both. The old Gentleman's Tale, from Want of Varie∣ty, is not quite so entertaining to us, as it was to <HI>Desdemona;</HI> and the young one's, his
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
Friends say, from Diffidence, rather too flat and insipid.</P>
<P>It was a Saying of one of the <HI>Roman</HI> Orators to a Client, who had given him a long Detail of the ill Treatment he had received from a Neighbour: <Q>“Friend, this Account can't be genuine, your Narration is too cold; had you really been as ill-us'd as you say, your Rage, on the Recital, would be equal to the Provocation.”</Q> Can <HI>Othello,</HI> then, a Man of Honour, and a Soldier, hear himself accused of using Spells, and having recourse to Witchcraft, without testifying a Warmth in the Defence of his Reputation: Nor would it be easy for a Man of his Character, who had made the flinty and Steel-couch of War his thrice-driven Bed of Down, to recall to his Mind the Battles, Sieges▪ and disastrous Chances he had en∣counter'd, without being animated with the Story, and shewing different Emotions, sui∣table to the various Accidents of his Life. Turn your Eye to the Deportment of one of your Companions, upon the Repetition of an Adventure that bears but a remote Relation to the Subject before us, your Observations there, will be more convincing than any Ar∣guments I can produce. <HI>B</HI>'s. Design in this Passage, seems to be nearer▪ the Mark than the other's, but from Inexperience, or Timi∣dity, he is vastly defective in the Execution;
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
if the first, it will soon be corrected; and the last, as it flows from a Diffidence of him∣self, and is a Proof of his Respect and Defe∣rence for the Judgment of the Audience, ought to meet with the highest Indul∣gence.</P>
<P>The second Act brings <HI>Othello</HI> and <HI>Des∣demona</HI> to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where the Rapture of both is increased, by the Fears they had sustained for each other, during the late Storm▪ And here, from the Sweetness and Compass of Mr. <HI>B</HI>'s. Voice, he is much superior to Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> There is, indeed, a Mixture of Distress in his Joy, which, as he cannot employ with any Kind of Propriety in this Place, I should be glad he would part with. The next Scene is the quelling of a Broil contrived by <HI>Iago</HI> on the Watch; the Time, the Place, the Persons, one would imagine, should here convey sufficient Instructions to the Actor, and yet neither <HI>Q.</HI> nor <HI>B.</HI> are correctly right: The first has Dignity without Rage, the last Rage without Dignity; when the former re∣proaches the Mutineers with their being in a Town of War,
<Q><L>Yet wild, the People's Hearts brim full of Fear.</L></Q>
his Utterance is as stoical as at
<Q><L>Fathers, we once again are met in Council.</L></Q>
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
And when the latter discharges <HI>Cassio</HI> from the Service, his Behaviour is that of a Gen∣tleman stripping a Valet de Chambre, and not a General cashiering an Officer: Nor is he less mistaken in his Address to <HI>Montano,</HI> his Upbraidings are destitute both of Warmth, and Bitterness. But I cannot quit this Pas∣sage without doing Justice to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> at his Exit, his Tenderness for <HI>Desdemona</HI> is hap∣pily expressed, and the Desire of the Lover succeeds the Fury of the Warrior with great Propriety.</P>
<P>But we must now prepare our Attention for the third Act, the great Scene of Busi∣ness; and here I could wish for a larger Compass than this Tract will afford me; I would then endeavour to pay my little Tri∣bute to the Genius of the Author, at the same time that I am attempting to do Justice to the Skill of the Actor; but circumscribed as I am, I can take no Notice of the for∣mer, but as it assists my Observations on the latter.</P>
<P>The great Fault I have to charge the Actors with in this Scene, is their betraying a Consciousness of what is to succeed; or, in other Words, being jealous before they have reason. <HI>Iago,</HI> in all the Speeches that work up <HI>Othello</HI> to the Height he desires, does not drop the least Hint of the Disloyalty of <HI>Des∣demona,</HI> but only gives his Friend to under∣stand,
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
that he has a Secret, which he is un∣willing to communicate, that nearly concerns him. <HI>Othello</HI> may have some Doubts of the Integrity of <HI>Cassio,</HI> but does not harbour the least Suspicion of his Wife's Virtue; the Mistake commonly begins at <HI>Ha!</HI> which Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> utters as a Mark of Reflection, <HI>B.</HI> of Rage. To be the better able to determine which of their Judgments is best, take the whole Passage.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oth.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'll know thy Thoughts.</L>

<L>Ha!</L>
</SP>
<P>The Increase of Rage at the Obstinacy of <HI>Iago</HI> is natural enough, but why should the Jea∣lousy be received here, more than at any other foregoing Passage of the Play? And be∣sides, the Artifice of <HI>Iago</HI> is destroyed by this Means, who, seeing the Reason of <HI>Othello</HI> dispossessed by a Torrent of contending Passi∣ons, seizes on the Opportunity of pouring into his Mind a Suspicion, which, at another Time, would have been denied Admittance, and so with no other Preparation than the raising a Storm, which he knew how to di∣vert, he comes plump at once with,
<Q><L>O! my Lord, beware of Jealousy.</L></Q>
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
This I take to be the most obvious Explana∣tion of the Passage, and therefore decree in Favour of <HI>B. Q.</HI> in the Words of Mr. <HI>Cibber,</HI> is more than excellent in his Endeavour to conceal from <HI>Iago,</HI> the Grief and Anguish that the Doubts of his Wife gave him,
<Q><L>Not a Jot, not a Jot.</L></Q>
But then he is far short of his Rival in
<Q><L>This Fellow's of exceeding Honesty.</L></Q>
This Speech is a Mixture of deliberate Rea∣soning, and wild Starts of Rage; <HI>Q.</HI> considers it in the first Light only, whilst <HI>B.</HI> gives fire to the one Part, and Sedateness to the other; his Fury begins at,
<Q><L>If I do prove her Haggard.</L></Q>
And subsides at,
<Q><L>Happ'ly for I am black.</L></Q>
Then a sudden Reflection destroys his Cool∣ness, and the Thoughts of her being gone, and that his only Relief was to loath her, hurries him into a fresh Tempest of Impati∣ence and Despair; nor has the Poet less Obligations to <HI>B.</HI> at the Entrance of <HI>Desde∣mona;</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
his immediate Drop from a Whirl∣wind to a Calm, and the Tenderness that accompanies the Declaration of a Belief, that it was impossible so divine a Form could delight in Polution; this, with his whole Behaviour to her at going off, is masterly and affecting. <HI>Q.</HI> claims the Preheminence at the Opening of the next Scene,
<Q><L>What Sense had I.</L></Q>
Tears have no Business here. And in this Place, a Caution which I have to offer Mr. <HI>B.</HI> may be properly introduced.</P>
<P>You have, Sir, I doubt not, been often told; that your Expressions of Grief and Tenderness are very becoming, and they told you Truth; but let not this Persuasion draw you into a Prostitution of the Excel∣lence; for, not to mention that your Judg∣ment will suffer in the Eyes of the Discerning, your hackneying the Passion, and applying it indiscriminately, will take from its Weight, and lower its Force, even with the Injudici∣ous: If you cry one Minute for Joy, and another for Sorrow, as in Lord <HI>Townly,</HI> a Man would be puzzled to know whether you were angry or pleased; and, in the pre∣sent Case, a Degree of Anger is rather the Passion than Sorrow.</P>
<P>The Close of the second Speech has, in∣deed, some Distress; <HI>Othello's Occupation's</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="31"/>
<HI>gone;</HI> and is finely calculated by the Author for the Advantage of the Actor; the Rage that ensues upon the Sight of <HI>Iago,</HI> who was the immediate Cause of <HI>Othello</HI>'s Affliction, is a fine Opposition to the resign'd, calm Despair that preceeds it: I can't boast much of the Execution of either <HI>Q.</HI> or <HI>B.</HI> in the climactick Speech of
<Q><L>Villain, be sure.</L></Q>
I call it one Speech, for those little Breaks of,
<Q><L>My noble Lord, is't come to this?</L></Q>
Are not design'd as Interruptions, but art∣fully thrown in as breathing Places for <HI>Othello. B</HI>'s. Action and Attitude, with the Totterings of <HI>Iago,</HI> convey to my Mind a pretty strong Idea of Wrestling, but do not disturb my Tranquillity with any Emotions of Terror; nor does <HI>Q</HI>'s. Method of Collaring and quitting, and then collaring again, cor∣respond with my Conception of the Passage: There is a Connection through the whole Speech; and, to give the Mind an Opportu∣nity of cooling by a Walk cross the Stage, is an Error that I could not have thought Mr. <HI>Q</HI>'s. Experience would have committed. Nor do I much admire the Utterance of either <HI>Q.</HI> or <HI>B.</HI> in this Place; the Growl of the first
<PB N="33" REF="32"/>
is as far from right, as the Vociferation of the last; the former wants Fury, and the latter a forcible Energy, which Loudness can never couvey. An Octavo would scarce have Room enough for a minute and critical Enquiry into the Defects and Perfections of both these Gentlemen in this Part.</P>
<P>I shall therefore trouble the Reader with but a few more Remarks, by which, and the foregoing, he will be able to make a tolera∣ble Judgment, to which <HI>Shakespear</HI> is most obliged.</P>
<P>The great Difficulty that attends the Ac∣tor in this Part, is the raising in the Minds of the Audience a Compassion for himself superi∣or, if possible, to that they entertain for his Wife; and, for this Purpose, the Strugglings and Convulsions that torture and distract his Mind, upon his resolving to murder her, cannot be too strongly painted, nor can the Act itself be accompanied with too much Grief and Tenderness: In short, let the kil∣ling of <HI>Desdemona</HI> appear as a Sacrifice to the Hero's injur'd Honour, and not the Gratifica∣tion of a diabolic Passion.</P>
<P><Q><L>For naught did I in hate, but</L>
<L>All in Honour.</L></Q>
Are almost the last Words of <HI>Othello.</HI> Sure never has there been a Character more gene∣rally
<PB N="34" REF="33"/>
misunderstood both by Audience and Actor, than this before us, to mistake the most tender-hearted, compassionate, humane Man, for a cruel, bloody, and obdurate Sa∣vage. Is there an Expression of his, even when he has no Doubt remaining of the Incontinence of his Wife, but what is strong∣ly tinctured with Love and Pity. With what Difficulty, with what Anguish of Mind, does he resolve to poison her, and that not before he has recounted her most mi∣nute Excellence, even to her Skill with the Needle: Nor does the Command of,
<Q><L>Get me some Poison, Iago.</L></Q>
Come from him, till he had used every Ar∣gument in her Excuse, and searched, but in vain, for any other Expedient.</P>
<P>How gladly does he exchange the Manner of her Death, for that which appears more suitable to Justice:
<Q><L>Strangle her in the Bed she hath con∣taminated.</L></Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Oth.</SPEAKER>
<L>Good! the Justice of it pleases.</L>
</SP>
<P>And what Anxiety and Care does he testify for the immortal Part of her, even at the Instant before her Death; in how pathetick a Manner does he caution her against the
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
Commission of a Sin which would effectually damn her:
<Q><L>Sweet Soul, take Heed of Perjury.</L></Q>
And what an Earnestness does he express for the Success of her short Prayer,
<Q><L>Amen, with all my Heart.</L></Q></P>
<P>With this, take a View of his Behaviour after the Discovery of her Innocence, and then tell me, whether the Tenderness, Love, Grief and Pity, that <HI>B.</HI> blends with every Incident in the two last Acts, or the stern, brutal, unfeeling Behaviour of <HI>Q.</HI> be most consistent with the true Character of <HI>O∣thello.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but confess, notwithstanding all I have said of Mr. <HI>B.</HI> that frequent Trips are made by him in several Passages of the Play, but as he has the Pleas of Youth and Inexpe∣rience in his Favour, I shall leave him to Time for Amendment and private Correcti∣on; but if through Vanity he continues ob∣stinate, he must expect a publick Admoni∣tion. With one Hint more I shall leave him, and that is with regard to his Deport∣ment: In the Passion of Grief, by a vil∣lainous Habit, he throws his Body out of the Line, his Head is projected, and his Body
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
drawn tottering after. But for a more pic∣turesque Description of his Figure, take this Line of <HI>Pope</HI>'s,
<Q><L>And, like a wounded Snake, draws his slow Length along.</L></Q>
Not to mention the clasping of the Hands together, which is either an aukward Action, or aukwardly executed; but were it ever so graceful, it is too frequently repeated.</P>
<P>There is no Part that I can at present re∣collect, which so absolutely depends on what the Laureat figuratively calls, the Returning of the Ball, as the Character in question. I defy the greatest <HI>Othello</HI> that ever was born, unless he be well provided with an Antient, properly to express either the Hero or the jealous Lover: Nor, indeed, can the Skill and Address of <HI>Iago</HI> be placed in a conspicuous Light without the Assistance of a judicious <HI>Othello.</HI> Suppose then, as these Characters are so closely connected, we bestow a few Periods on the most artful, insinuating, thorough-paced Villain that ever was in∣debted for Detection and Infamy to the Pen of a Poet.</P>
<P>And here, were I inclined to favour the Prejudices of the Public, I should intreat, not demand their Regard to an Actor, who, in the Part of <HI>Iago,</HI> is at least equal to any
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
<HI>Othello</HI> this Age has produced; but as my present Purpose is the Discovery of Absurdity and Ignorance, however protected by partial Popularity, and the drawing from Obscurity real Merit, however depressed by Folly or Faction, take my sincere Sentiments of <HI>Macklin</HI> in the Character of <HI>Iago</HI> without Apology.</P>
<P>Be it our first Care then to consider in what Light (I mean as to Quality and For∣tune) <HI>Shakespear</HI> has presented <HI>Iago</HI> to us. I think we may venture to affirm, that the Ensign was a Dependant on the General; nay, perhaps a Domestick, from the Im∣ployment assign'd to <HI>Emilia,</HI>
<Q><L>I pray thee let thy Wife attend on her.</L></Q>
This may be safely concluded: Besides, we find <HI>Othello</HI> frequently imploying <HI>Iago</HI> in Offices that bear no relation to his Com∣mand,
<Q><L>Go to the Port and disembark my Coffers.</L>
<L>Fetch Desdemona hither, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</L></Q>
My Penetration can discover but one Place where <HI>Iago</HI> offers at disobeying the Injuncti∣ons of his Master,
<Q><L>I do not like the Office.</L></Q>
<PB N="38" REF="37"/>
And here so many other Reasons may be as∣signed besides Equality of Condition, that no Conclusion can be fairly drawn, opposite to what has been advanced. I have been the longer on this Point, because, on the Settling of it, depends the Propriety of <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Deportment thro' the whole Play.</P>
<P>If then there be no Difference between these Characters but what is given by a supe∣rior Commission; that is, was the State of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Army the same as with us, <HI>Mack∣lin</HI>'s Conduct is wrong; but if <HI>Iago</HI>'s Situa∣tion was what I have presum'd it, his distant obsequious Behaviour is critically right, and the Judgment both of his Competitors and Censurers erronecus and absurd.</P>
<P>Let us now proceed to examine whether Mr. <HI>Macklin</HI> is happy in looking this Cha∣racter. I think it is generally agreed that his Muscles are luckily formed for marking the Villain; but it has been objected, that Nature has denied him the Advantage of expressing the open, sincere, honest Man; or, in other Words, of playing the Hypocrite well in this Part. If these witty Gentlemen will tell me what Rules they have for judging of Counte∣nances, I shall think their Criticism worth an Answer; but let <HI>Macklin</HI>'s Visage be ever so unfortunate, I am sure he has the Art of looking more like a Rogue at one Time than another, which is all that either I, they, or
<PB N="39" REF="38" MS="y"/>
the Poet have a Right to expect from him.</P>
<P><HI>Macklin</HI>'s Skill and Judgment cannot be sufficiently commended in the third Act. I have seen an applauded Player, puffed with the low Ambition of being the distinguished Per∣former, crack his Lungs, split his own Trembling-pipe, and our Ears, in order to catch an ignorant <HI>Bene</HI> from the hard Hands of the Gallery. Be it <HI>Macklin</HI>'s peculiar Ex∣cellence not to attempt the obtaining more Consequence, or a higher Regard than the Author has thought fit to allow him; from his modest and decent Deportment, you are always taught that he has a Superior, both in Quality and Character, on the Stage. Oh! curse on those unmannerly bellowing Blus∣terers. Go, go ye <HI>Herods;</HI> go, and learn that Sentiments, nay, Passions can have Energy and Force, without Noise and Vociferation. Reform, ye Ranters! or, by <HI>Thalia, Clio,</HI> and all the Nine, whose Inspirations you have villainously abused, I'll attack you in the Face of the Audience; and, with the Pipe of <HI>Gracchus,</HI> force you to Moderation, ye Termagants!</P>
<P>But to proceed. Heigh ho! Lord! what a Fury am I in: P—x take these Fellows, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y have so rouz'd my Gall, that I am quite unfit for Panegyrick; and as <HI>Macklin</HI> has been such an ill-natur'd Cur as to give me no Open for Invective and Satire in the Play
<PB N="40" REF="39"/>
before us, I shall leave him, till I find myself in a Disposition capable of doing Justice to his Merit, and my Sense of it.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> I suspect, will be thought to make but an odd Kind of Figure in this Pamphlet: Why, be it right or wrong, as he appears in my Eye, you have him; if you except one or two Stoical Characters, Mr. <HI>Q</HI>'s. Merit, as a Tragedian, is not very high in my Opinion. In <HI>Shakespear</HI>'s Plays you have very little De∣clamation; and where the Passions are to be expressed, Mr. <HI>Q.</HI> appears to me, besides the Absence of some natural Powers, to want one Requisite, without which no Performer will ever please me; that is, Feeling.</P>
<P>But tho' this Gentleman does not become the Buskin, no Man appears with more Suc∣cess in the Sock, and glad I should have been had it come within my present Purpose, to have paid him due Acknowledgments for the Pleasure he has given me in <HI>Falstaff, Mask∣well,</HI> and, indeed, all his Comic Parts. But if the publick Regard should attend my pre∣sent Labours, his Excellence, with that of his Fellow-Labourers in the same Vineyard, may be soon the Subject of another Pam∣phlet.</P>
<P>And now, Reader, if thou hast any G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d∣nature indulge me with thy Attention, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I bestow a few Periods on myself and my Work. A young Writer, which I profess

myself, and I don't despair of being believed, has a Kind of Right by Prescription to re∣serve two Pages to himself; not that I should, at this Time, have exerted my Prerogative, had not my Bookseller informed me, that my Copy was deficient almost Half a Sheet: You are, therefore, to regard all that follows, not as calculated for Information or Enter∣tainment, but merely designed to fatisfy the craving Appetite of those who insist on de∣vouring such a Number of Lines and Words for their Twelvepence.</P>

Hold; let me think:—Oh! now I have it, that this Treatise (as its Force is levelled against that <HI>Hydra,</HI> Prejudice) will have many Enemies, I don't doubt; that it will give great Enter∣tainment to the Frequenters of a certain Coffee-House I have as little doubt: Me∣thinks I behold the insulting Tyrants gather round my First-born, my early, only Hope.
