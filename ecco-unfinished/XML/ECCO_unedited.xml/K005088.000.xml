<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the mixed Drama of the last Age,
called <HI>Tragi-Comedy,</HI> has been generally con∣demned
by the Critics, and perhaps not without Rea∣son;
yet it has been found to succeed on the Stage:
Both the Comic and Tragic Scenes have been applaud∣ed
by the Audience, without any particular Excep∣tions.
Nor has it been observed, that the Effect of
either was less forcible, than it would have been, if
they had not succeeded each other in the Entertainment
of the same Night. The Tragic Part of this Play has
been always esteemed extremely Natural and Interest∣ing;
and it would probably, like some others, have
produc'd its full Effect, notwithstanding the Interven∣tion
of the Comic Scenes that are mixed with it: The
Editor therefore, would not have thought of removing
them, if they had not been exceptionable in them∣selves,
not only as indelicate, but as immoral: For this
Reason, he has suffered so much of the Characters of
the <HI>Porter</HI> and the <HI>Nurse</HI> to remain, as is not liable to
this Objection. He is, however, to account, not only
for what he has taken away, but for what he has added.
It will easily be comprehended, that the leaving out
Something, made it absolutely necessary that Some∣thing
should be supplied; and the Public will be the
more easily reconciled to this Necessity, when they are
acquainted that the Additions are very inconsiderable,
and that the Editor has done his utmost to render them
of a Piece with the rest. Several Lines of the Original,
particularly, in the Part of <HI>Isabella,</HI> are printed, though
they are omitted in the Representation. Many Things
please in the Reading, which may have little or no Ef∣fect
upon the Stage. When the Passions are violent,
and the Speeches long, the Performers must either
spare their Powers, or shorten their Speeches. Mrs.
<HI>Cibber</HI> chose the latter; by which she has been able to
exert that Force and Expression which has been so
strongly felt, and so sincerely applauded.</P>

<SPEAKER>CARLOS.</SPEAKER>
<L>THIS Constancy of yours will establish an
immortal Reputation among the Women.</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>If it would establish me with <HI>Isa∣bella</HI>—</L>

<L>Follow her, follow her: <HI>Troy</HI> Town was won

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have follow'd her these seven Years, and now
but live in Hopes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<L>But live in Hopes! why, Hope is the ready
Road, the Lover's Baiting-place; and, for aught you
know, but one Stage short of the Possession of your
Mistress.</L>
</SP>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>But my Hopes, I fear, are more of my own
making, than hers; and proceed rather from my
Wishes, than any Encouragement she has given me.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<L>That I can't tell: The Sex is very various:
There are no certain Measures to be prescrib'd, or fol∣low'd,
in making our Approaches to the Women. All
that we have to do, I think, is to attempt 'em in the
weakest Part: Press 'em but hard, and they will all fall
under the Necessity of a Surrender at last. That Favour
comes at once; and sometimes when we least expect it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>I shall be glad to find it so.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<L>You will find it so. Every Place is to be taken,
that is not to be reliev'd: She must comply.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm going to visit her.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<L>What Interest a Brother-in-Law can have with
her, depend upon.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>I know your Interest, and I thank you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Car.</SPEAKER>
<L>You are prevented; see the Mourner comes;</L>
<L>She weeps, as seven Years were seven Hours;</L>
<L>So fresh, unfading is the Memory</L>
<L>Of my poor Brother's <HI>Biron</HI>'s Death:</L>
<L>I leave you to your Opportunity.</L>
<STAGE>[<HI>Exit</HI> Vil.</STAGE>
<L>Tho' I have ta'en Care to root her from our House,</L>
<L>I wou'd transplant her into <HI>Villeroy</HI>'s—</L>
<L>There is an evil Fate that waits upon her,</L>
<L>To which, I wish him wedded—Only him:</L>
<L>His upstart Family, with haughty Brow,</L>
<L>(Tho' <HI>Villeroy</HI> and myself are seeming Friends)</L>
<L>Looks down upon our House; his Sister too,</L>
<L>Whose Hand I ask'd, and was with Scorn refus'd,</L>
<L>Lives in my Breast, and fires me to Revenge.—</L>
<L>They bend this Way—</L>
<L>Perhaps at last she seeks my Father's Doors;</L>
<L>They shall be shut, and he prepar'd to give</L>
<L>The Beggar and her Brat a cold Reception.</L>
<L>That Boy's an Adder in my Path—they come,</L>
<L>I'll stand a-part, and watch their Motions.</L>

<STAGE>Enter Villeroy, with Isabella and her little Son.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why do you follow me? You know, I am</L>
<L>A Bankrupt every way; too far engag'd</L>
<L>Ever to make Return; I own you've been</L>
<L>More than a Brother to me, been my Friend;</L>
<L>And at a Time when Friends are found no more,</L>
<L>A Friend to my Misfortunes.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>I must be</L>
<L>Always your Friend.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<L>I have known, and found you</L>
<L>Truly my Friend; and wou'd I cou'd be yours;</L>
<L>But the Unfortunate cannot be Friends:</L>
<L>Fate watches the first Motion of the Soul,</L>
<L>To disappoint our Wishes; if we pray</L>
<L>For Blessings, they prove Curses in the End,</L>
<L>To ruin all about us. Pray be gone,</L>
<L>Take Warning, and be happy.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Happiness!</L>
<L>There's none for me, without you: Riches, Name,</L>
<L>Health, Fame, Distinction, Place, and Quality,</L>
<L>Are the Incumbrances of groaning Life,</L>
<L>To make it but more tedious, without you;</L>
<L>What serve the Goods of Fortune for? To raise</L>
<L>My Hopes, that you at last will share 'em with me.</L>
<L>Long Life itself, the universal Prayer,</L>
<L>And Heav'n's Reward of Well-deservers here,</L>
<L>Wou'd prove a Plague to me; to see you always,</L>
<L>And never see you mine! still to desire,</L>
<L>And never to enjoy!</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<L>I must not hear you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>Thus, at this awful Distance, I have serv'd</L>
<L>A seven Years Bondage—Do I call it Bondage,</L>
<L>When I can never wish to be redeem'd?</L>
<L>No, let me rather linger out a Life</L>
<L>Of Expectation, that you may be mine,</L>
<L>Than be restor'd to the Indifference</L>
<L>Of seeing you, without this pleasing Pain:</L>
<L>I've lost myself, and never would be found,</L>
<L>But in these Arms.</L>
</SP>
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<L>O, I have heard all this!</L>
<L>—But must no more—the Charmer is no more:</L>
<L>My bury'd Husband rises in the Face</L>
<L>Of my dear Boy, and chides me for my Stay:</L>
<L>Can'st thou forgive me, Child?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Child.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, have you done a Fault? You cry as if
you had: Indeed now, I have done nothing to offend
you: But if you kiss me, and look so very sad upon me,
I shall cry too.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<L>My little Angel, no, you must not cry;</L>
<L>Sorrow will overtake thy Steps too soon;</L>
<L>I should not hasten it.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>What can I say!</L>
<L>The Arguments that make against my Hopes</L>
<L>Prevail upon my Heart, and fix me more;</L>
<L>Those pious Tears you hourly throw away</L>
<L>Upon the Grave, have all their quick'ning Charms,</L>
<L>And more engage my Love, to make you mine:</L>
<L>When yet a Virgin, free, and undispos'd,</L>
<L>I lov'd, but saw you only with my Eyes;</L>
<L>I cou'd not reach the Beauties of your Soul:</L>
<L>I have since liv'd in Contemplation,</L>
<L>And long Experience of your growing Goodness:</L>
<L>What then was Passion, is my Judgment now,</L>
<L>Thro' all the several Changes of your Life,</L>
<L>Confirm'd and settled in adoring you.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Isa.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, then I must be gone: If you're my Friend,</L>
<L>If you regard my little Interest;</L>
<L>No more of this; you see, I grant you all</L>
<L>That Friendship will allow: Be still, my Friend;</L>
<L>That's all I can receive, or have to give:</L>
<L>I'm going to my Father: He needs not an Excuse</L>
<L>To use me ill; pray leave me to the Trial.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Vil.</SPEAKER>
<L>I'm only born to be what you wou'd have me;</L>

<L>In every thing obey you. I am going:</L>

<L>Well, what's to do now, I trow? You knock

hear of: But I can tell you, you may look twice about
you for a Welcome in a great Man's Family, before you
find it, unless you bring it along with you.</L>

<L>Why, don't you know me, Friend?</L>

<L>Not I, not I, Mistress; I may have seen you
before, or so: But Men of Employment must forget
their Acquaintance; especially such as we are never to

<L>I'm glad you know me, Nurse.</L>

<L>Marry, Heav'n forbid, Madam, that I should
ever forget you, or my little Jewel: Pray go in—[Isabella
<HI>goes in with her Child:</HI>] Now my Blessing go along with
you, wherever you go, or whatever you are about.
Fie, <HI>Sampson,</HI> how could'st thou be such a <HI>Saracen?</HI> A
<HI>Turk</HI> would have been a better Christian, than to have
done so barbarously by so good a Lady.</L>
</SP>
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why look you, Nurse, I know you of old: By
your Good-will you would have a Finger in every bo∣dy's
Pie, but mark the End on't; if I am call'd to Ac∣count
about it, I know what I have to say.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>Marry come up here; say your Pleasure, and
spare not. Refuse his eldest Son's Widow, and poor
Child, the Comsort of seeing him? She does not trou∣ble
him so often.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Not that I am against it, Nurse; but we are
but Servants, you know: We must have no Likings,
but our Lord's; and must do as we are ordered.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>Nay, that's true, <HI>Sampson.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Besides, what I did was all for the best: I
have no Ill-will to the young Lady, as a Body may
say, upon my own Account; only that I hear she is
poor; and indeed I naturally hate your decay'd Gen∣try:
They expect as much waiting upon as when they
had Money in their Pockets, and were able to consider
us for the Trouble.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, that is a Grievance indeed in great Fa∣milies;
where the Gifts at good Times are better than
the Wages: It would do well to be reform'd.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>But what is the Business, Nurse? You have
been in the Family, before I came into the World:
What's the Reason, pray, that this Daughter-in-Law,
who has so good a Report in every Body's Mouth, is so
little set by, by my Lord?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why, I'll tell you, <HI>Sampson;</HI> more nor less:
I'll tell the Truth, that's my Way, you know, without
adding or diminishing.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Ay, marry, Nurse.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>My Lord's eldest Son, <HI>Biron</HI> by Name, the
Son of his Bosom, and the Son that he would have lov'd
best, if he had as many as King <HI>Pyramus</HI> of <HI>Troy.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>How! King <HI>Pyramus</HI> of <HI>Troy!</HI> why how
many had he?</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why the Ballet sings he had fifty Sons: But
no matter for that. This <HI>Biron,</HI> as I was saying, was
a lovely sweet Gentleman, and indeed, no body could
blame his Father for loving him: He was a Son for the
King of <HI>Spain;</HI> God bless him; for I was his Nurse.
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
But now I come to the Point, (<HI>Sampson;</HI> this <HI>Biron,</HI>
without asking the Advice of his Friends, Hand over
Head, as young Men will have their Vagaries, not
having the Fear of his Father before his Eyes, as I may
say, wilfully marries this <HI>Isabella.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>How, wilfully! he should have had her Con∣sent,
methinks.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>No, wilfully marries her: and which was
worse, after she had settled all her Fortune upon a
Nunnery, which she broke out of to run away with
him. They say they had the Church's Forgiveness,
but I had rather it had been his Father's.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why in good Truth, these Nunneries, I see
no Good they do. I think the young Lady was in the
right, to run away from a Nunnery: And I think our
young Master was not in the wrong, but in marrying
without a Portion.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nurse.</SPEAKER>
<L>That was the Quarrel, I believe, <HI>Sampson:</HI>
Upon this, my old Lord would never see him; disinhe∣rited
him; took his younger Brother <HI>Carlos</HI> into Fa∣vour,
whom he never car'd for before; and at last forc'd
<HI>Biron</HI> to go to the Siege of <HI>Candy,</HI> where he was killed.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Samp.</SPEAKER>
<L>A-lack-a-day, poor Gentleman.</L>

<L>For which my old Lord hates her, as if she
had been the Cause of his going thither.</L>

<L>Alas, alas, poor Lady, she has suffer'd for't:
She has liv'd a great While a Widow.</L>

heard,</L>

<L>You say, you drew your Sword in his Defence:</L>
<L>Who were his Enemies? Did he need Defence?</L>
<L>Had he wrong'd any one? Cauld he have Cause</L>
<L>To apprehend a Danger, but from you?</L>
<L>And yet you rescu'd him!—No, no, he came</L>
<L>Unseasonably, (that was all his Crime)</L>
<L>Unluckily to interrupt your Sport:</L>
<L>You were new marry'd—marry'd to his Wife;</L>
