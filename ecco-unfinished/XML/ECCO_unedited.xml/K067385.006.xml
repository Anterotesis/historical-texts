<P>THIS year the sudden death of Henry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612.</NOTE> Prince of
Wales,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Novem. 6. Death of Pr. Henry.</NOTE> diffused an universal grief thro' the na∣tion.
Tho' youth and royal birth, both of them
strong allurements, prepossess men mightily in favour of the
early age of all princes; 'tis with peculiar fondness, that
historians mention Henry: And, in every respect, his merit
seems to have been extraordinary. He had not reached his
eighteenth year, and he possessed already more dignity in his
behaviour, and commanded more respect, than his father,
with all his age, learning, and experience. Neither his high
fortune, nor his youth, had seduced him into any irregular
pleasures: Business and ambition seem to have been his sole
passion. His inclination, as well as exercises, were intirely
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
martial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLVII.</NOTE> The French ambassador, coming to take leave of
him, and ask his commands for France, found him employed
in the exercise of the pike; <HI>Tell your King,</HI> said he, <HI>in what
occupation you left me ingaged</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French monarch had given particular orders to his ministers to cul∣tivate the Prince's friendship; who must soon, said he, have chief authority in England, where the king and queen are held in so little estimation. See <HI>Dep. de la B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derie.</HI></NOTE>. He had conceived great
affection and esteem for the brave Sir Walter Raleigh. It
was his saying, <HI>Sure no king but my father would keeb such
a bird in a cage</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke's Detection, p. 37.</NOTE>. He seems, indeed to have nourished too
violent a contempt for the King, on account of his pedantry
and pusillanimity; and by that means struck in with the
restless and martial spirit of the English nation. Had he
lived, he had probably promoted the glory, perhaps not the
felicity, of his people. The unhappy prepossession, which
men commonly entertain in favour of ambition, courage,
enterprize, and other warlike virtues, ingages generous natures,
who always love fame, into such pursuits as destroy
their own peace, and that of the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>VIOLENT reports were propagated, as if Henry had
been carried off by poison; but the physicians, on opening
his body, found no symptoms to confirm such an opinion<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 690. Coke, p. 37. Welwood, p. 272.</NOTE>.
The bold and criminal malignity of mens tongues and pens
spared not even the King on that occasion. But that prince's
character seems to have failed rather in the extreme of facility
and humanity, than in that of cruelty and violence.
His indulgence to Henry was great, and perhaps imprudent,
by giving him a very large and independent settlement, even
in so early youth.</P>
<P>THE marriage of the Princess Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1613.</NOTE> with Frederic
the Elector Palatine, was finished some time after the death
of the Prince, and served to dissipate the grief which arose
on that melancholy event.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Febr. 14.</NOTE> But this marriage, tho' cele∣brated
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
with great joy and festivity, proved, itself, a very
unhappy event to the King, as well as to his son-in-law, and
had ill consequences on the reputation and fortunes of both.
The Elector,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the Princess Elizabeth with the Palatine.</NOTE> trusting to so great an alliance, engaged in
enterprizes beyond his strength: And the King, not being
able to support him in his distress, lost intirely, in the end
of his life, what remained of the affections and esteem of
his own subjects.</P>
<P>EXCEPT during sessions of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rise of So∣merset.</NOTE> the history of
this reign may more properly be called the history of the
court than that of the nation. A most interesting object
had, for some years, ingaged the attention of the court:
It was a favourite, and one beloved by James with so pro∣fuse
and unlimited an affection, as left no room for any rival
or competitor. About the end of the year 1609, Robert
Carre, a youth of twenty years of age, and of a good fa∣mily
in Scotland, arrived in London, after having passed
some time in his travels. All his natural accomplishments
consisted in good looks: All his acquired abilities, in an
easy air and graceful demeanour. He had letters of recom∣mendation
to his countryman lord Hay; and that Nobleman
no sooner cast-his eye upon him, than he discovered talents
sufficient to entitle him immediately to make a great figure
in the government. Apprized of the King's passion for
youth and beauty, and exterior appearance, he studied
how matters might be so adjusted, that this new object should
make the strongest impression upon him. Without men∣tioning
him at court, he assigned him the office, at a match
of tilting, of presenting to the King his buckler and de∣vice;
and hoped that he would attract the attention of that
monarch. Fortune proved favourable to his design, by an
incident, which bore, at first, a contrary aspect. When
Carre was advancing to execute his office, his unruly horse
flung him, and broke his leg in the King's presence. James
approached him with pity and concern: Love and affection
arose on the sight of his beauty and tender years; and the
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
Prince ordered him immediately to be lodged in the palace,
and to be carefully attended. He himself, after the tilting,
paid him a visit in his chamber, and returned frequently
during his consinement. The ignorance and simplicity of
the boy finished the conquest, begun by his exterior graces
and accomplishments. Other princes have been fond of
chusing their favourites from among the lower ranks of
their subjects, and have reposed themselves on them with
the more unreserved confidence and affection, that the ob∣ject
has been beholden to their bounty for every honour and
acquisition: James was desirous that his favourite should
also derive from him all his sense, experience, and knowlege.
Highly conceited of his own wisdom, he pleased himself
with the fancy that this raw youth, by his lessons and in∣structions,
would, in a little time, be equal to his sagest¦ministers,
and be initiated into all the profound mysteries of
government, on which he set so high a value. And as this
kind of creation was more perfectly. his own work than any
other, he seems to have indulged an unlimited fondness for
his minion, beyond even that which be bore to his own
children. He soon knighted him, created him Viscount Ro∣chester,
gave him the garter, brought him into the privy∣council,
and, tho' at first without assigning him any parti∣cular
office, bestowed on him the supreme direction. of all
his business and political concerns, Agreeable to this rapid
advancement in confidence and honour, were the riches
heaped upon the needy favourite; and while Salisbury and
all the wisest ministers could scarce find expedients sufficient
to keep in motion the o'erburthened machine of govern∣ment,
James, with unsparing hand, loaded with treasures
this insignificant and useless pageant<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 635, 636, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is said, that the King found his pupil so ill educated,
as to be ignorant even of the lowest rudiments of the Latin
tongue; and that the monarch, laying aside the sceptre,
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
took the birch into his royal hand, and insructed him in
the principles of grammar. During the intervals of this
noble occupation, affairs of state would be introduced; and
the stripling, by the ascendant which he had acquired,
was now enabled to repay in political, what he had received in
grammatical instruction. Such scenes, and such incidents,
are the more ridiculous, tho' the less odious, that the pas∣sion
of James seems not to have contained in it any thing
criminal or flagitious. History charges herself willingly
with a relation of the great crimes, or the great virtues of
mankind; but she appears to fall from her dignity, when
necessitated to dwell on such frivolous events and ignoble
personages.</P>
<P>THE favourite was not, at first, so intoxicated with ad∣vancement,
as not to be sensible of his own ignorance and
inexperience. He had recourse to the assistance and advice
of a friend; and he was more fortunate in his choice, than
is usual with such pampered minions. In Sir Thomas Overbury
he met with a judicious and sincere counsellor, who,
building all hopes of his own preferment on that of the
young favourite, endeavoured to instil into him the princi∣ples
of prudence and discretion. By zealously serving every∣body,
Carre was taught to abate the envy, which might at∣tend
his sudden elevation: By <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hewing a preference for the
English, he learned to escape the prejudices which prevailed
against his country. And so long as he was contented to be
ruled by Overbury's friendly counsels, he enjoyed, what is
rare, the highest favour of the prince, without being hated
by the people.</P>
<P>To complete the measure of courtly happiness, nought
was wanting but a kind mistress; and, where high fortune
concurred with all the graces of youth and beauty, this cir∣cumstance
could not be difficult to attain. But it was here
that the favourite met with that rock, on which all his for∣tunes
were wrecked, and which plunged him for ever into
an abyss of infamy, guilt, and misery.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="12"/>
NO sooner had James mounted the throne of England,
than he remembered his friendship for the unfortunate fami∣lies
of Howard and Devereux, who had suffered for their
attachment to the cause of Mary and to his own. Having
restored young Essex to his blood and dignity, and conferred
the titles of Suffolk and Northampton on two brothers of
the house of Norfolk, he sought the farther pleasure of
uniting these families by the marriage of the Earl of Essex
with Lady Frances Howard, daughter to the Earl of Suf∣folk.
She was only thirteen, he fourteen years of age;
and it was thought proper, till both should attain the age
of puberty, that he should go abroad, and pass some time
in his travels<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 686.</NOTE>. He returned into England after four
years absence, and was pleased to find his Countess in the
full lustre of beauty, and possessed of the love and admi∣ration
of the whole court. But, when the Earl approached,
and claimed the privileges of a husband, he met with no∣thing
but symptoms of aversion and disgust, and a flat re∣fusal
of any farther familiarities. He applied to her pa∣rents,
who constrained her to attend him into the country,
and to partake of his bed: But nothing could overcome
her rigid sullenness and obstinacy; and she still rose from
his side, without having shared the nuptial pleasures. Dis∣gusted
with re-iterated denials, he at last gave over the
pursuit, and separating himself from her, thenceforth aban∣doned
her conduct to her own will and discretion.</P>
<P>SUCH coldness and aversion in Lady Effex arose not with∣out
an attachment to another object. The favourite had
opened his adresses, and had been too successful in making
impression on the tender heart of the young Countess<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 687.</NOTE>.
She imagined, that so long as she refused the embraces of
Essex, she never could be deemed his wife, and that a se∣paration
and divorce might still open the way for a new
marriage with her beloved Rochester<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 228.</NOTE>. Though their
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
passion was so violent, and their opportunities of intercourse
so frequent, that they had already indulged themselves in all
the gratifications of love, they still lamented their unhappy
fate, while the union between them was not intire and in∣dissoluble.
And the lover, as well as his mistress, was im∣patient,
till their mutual ardour should be crowned with
marriage.</P>
<P>So momentous an affair could not be concluded without
consulting Overbury, with whom Rochester was accustomed
to share all his secrets. While that faithful friend had con∣sidered
his patron's attachment to the Countess of Essex
merely as an affair of gallantry, he had favoured its progress;
and it was partly owing to the ingenious and passionate let∣ters
which he dictated, that Rochester had met with such
success in his addresses. Like an experienced courtier, he
thought that a conquest of this nature would throw a lustre
on the youthful favourite, and would tend still further to
endear him to James, who was charmed to hear of the
amours of his court, and listened with attention to every
tale of gallantry. But great was Overbury's alarm, when
Rochester mentioned his design of marrying the Countess;
and he used every method to dissuade his friend from so
foolish an attempt. He reprsented, how invidious, how
difficult an enterprize it was to procure her a divorce from
her husband: How dangerous, how shameful, to take into
his own bed a profligate woman, who, being married to a
young nobleman of the first rank, had not scrupled to pro∣stitute
her character, and to bestow favours on the object
of a capricious and momentary passion. And, in the zeal of
friendship, he went so far as to threaten Rochester, that he
would separate himself for ever from him, if he could so far
forget his honour and his interest as to prosecute the intended
marriage<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p, 235, 236, 252. Franklyn, p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="14"/>
ROCHESTER had the weakness to reveal this conversation
to the Countess of Essex;<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 21st.</NOTE> and when her rage and fury broke
out against Overbury, he had also the weakness to enter into
her vindictive projects, and to swear vengeance against his
friend, for the utmost instance, which he could receive, of
his faithful friendship. Some contrivance was necessary for
the execution of their purpose. Rochester addressed himself
to the King; and after complaining, that his own in∣dulgence
to Overbury had begot in him a degree of arro∣gance,
which was extremely disagreeable, he procured a
commission for his embassy to Russia; which he represented
as a retreat for his friend, both profitable and honourable.
When consulted by Overbury, he earnestly dissuaded him
from accepting this offer, and took on himself the talk of
satisfying the King, if he should be any way displeased with
the refusal<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 236, 237, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
To the King again, he aggravated the in∣solence
of Overbury's conduct, and obtained a warrant for
committing him to the Tower, which James intended as a
slight punishment for his disobedience. The lieutenant of
the Tower was a creature of Rochester's, and had lately
been put into the office for this very purpose: He confined
Overbury so strictly, that the unhappy prisoner was debarred
from the sight even of his nearest relations; and no com∣munication
of any kind was allowed with him, during near
six months, which he lived in prison.</P>
<P>THIS obstacle being removed, the lovers pursued their
purpose; and the King himself, forgetting the dignity of his
character, and his friendship for the family of Essex, enter∣ed
zealously into the project of procuring the Countess a di∣vorce
from her husband. Essex also embraced the oppor∣tunity
of separating himself from a bad woman, by whom
he was hated; and he was willing to favour their success by
any honourable expedient. The pretence for a divorce was
his incapacity to fulfil the conjugal duties; and he con∣fessed,
that, with regard to the Countess, he was conscious of
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
such an infirmity, tho' he was not sensible of it with regard
to any other woman. In her place too, it is said, a young
virgin was substituted under a mask, to undergo the legal
inspection by a jury of matrons. After such a trial, second∣ed
by court-influence, and supported by the ridiculous opi∣nion
of fascination or witchcraft, the sentence of divorce was
pronounced between the Earl of Essex and his Countess<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 223, 224, &amp;c. Franklyn's Annals, p. 2, 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
And, to crown the scene, the king, solicitous lest the lady
should lose any rank by her new marriage, bestowed on his
minion the title of Earl of Somerset.</P>
<P>NOT WITHSTANDING this success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Overbury poisoned 16 Sept.</NOTE> the Countess of So∣merset
was not satisfied, till she should further satiate her re∣venge
on Overbury; and she engaged her husband, as well
as her uncle, the Earl of Northampton, in the atrocious de∣sign
of taking him off secretly by poison. Fruitless attempts
were re-iterated by weak poisons; but at last, they gave him
one so sudden and violent, that the symptoms were apparent
to every one, who approached him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 693. State Trials, vol. i. p. 233, 234, &amp;c.</NOTE>. His interment was
hurried on with the greatest precipitation; and, tho' a strong
suspicion immediately prevailed in the public, the full proof
of the crime was not brought to light, till some years after.</P>
<P>THE fatal catastrophe of Overbury increased or begot the
suspicion, that the Prince of Wales had been carried off by
poison, given him by Somerset. Men considered not, that
the contrary inference was much juster. If Somerset was so
great a novice in this detestable art, that, during the course
of five months, a man, who was his prisoner, and attended
by none but his emissaries, could not be dispatched but in so
bungling a manner; how could it be imagined, that a young
prince, living in his own court, surrounded by his own
friends and domestics, could be exposed to Sometset's at∣tempts,
and be taken off by so subtile a poison, if such a
one exist, as should elude the skill of the most experienced
physicians?</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="16"/>
THE ablest minister whom James ever possessed, the Earl
of Salisbury, was dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">14th of May 1612.</NOTE>: Suffolk, a man of slender capa∣city,
had succeeded him in his office: And it was now his
task to supply, from an exhausted treasury, the profusion of
James and of his young favourite. The title of baronet, in∣vented
by Salisbury, was sold; and two hundred patents of
that species of knighthood, were disposed of for so many
thousand pounds: Each rank of nobility had also its price
affixed to it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 11, 33.</NOTE>: Privy seals were circulated to the value
of 200,000 pounds: Benevolences were exacted to the
amount of 52,000 pounds<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 10.</NOTE>: And some monopolies,
of no great value, were erected. But all these expedients
proved insufficient to supply the King's necessities; even tho'
he began to enter into some schemes for retrenching his exp∣ences<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 49.</NOTE>.
However small the hopes of success, a new
parliament must be summoned, and this dangerous expedi∣ent,
for such it was now become, once more be put to trial.</P>
<P>WHEN the commons were assembled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1614.</NOTE> they discovered an
extraordinary alarm, on account of the rumour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th of April.</NOTE> which was
spread abroad concerning <HI>undertakers</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Parliam. Hist. vol. v. p. 286. Kennet, p. 696. Journ. 12 April, 2d May 1614, &amp;c. Franklyn, p. 48.</NOTE>. It was reported,
that several persons, attached to the King, had entered into
a confederacy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and having laid a regular plan for the new
elections, had distributed their interest all over England,
and had undertaken to secure a majority for the court. So
ignorant were the commons, that they knew not this incident
to be the first infallible symptom of any regular or established
liberty. Had they been contented to follow the maxims of
their predecessors, who, as the Earl of Salisbury said to the
last parliament, never, but thrice in six hundred years, re∣fused
a supply<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Journ. 17 Feb. 1609. It appears, however, that Salisbury was somewhat mistaken in this fact: And if the Kings were not oftener refused supply by the Parlia∣ment, it was only because they would not often expose themselves to the ha∣zard of being refused: But it is certain that English Parliaments did antiently carry their frugality to an extreme, and seldom could be prevailed upon to give the necessary support to the government.</NOTE>; they needed not dread, that the crown
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
should ever interest itself in their elections. Formerly, the
Kings even insisted, that none of their houshold should
ever be elected members; and, tho' the charter was after∣ward
declared void, Henry VI. from his great favour to
the city of York, conferred a peculiar privilege on its citizens,
that they should be exempted from this trouble<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Coke's Institutes, part 4. chap. 1, of charters of exemption.</NOTE>. 'Tis well
known, that, in antient times, a seat in the house being con∣sidered
as a burthen, attended neither with honour nor pro∣fit,
it was requisite for the counties and boroughs to pay
fees to their representatives. About this time, a seat began
to be regarded as an honour, and the country-gentlemen con∣tended
for it; tho' the practice of levying wages for the
parliament-men was not altogether discontinued. It was
not till long afterwards, when liberty was thoroughly esta∣blished,
and popular assemblies entered into every branch
of public business, that the members began to join profit to
honour, and the crown found it necessary to distribute
among them all the considerable offices of the kingdom.</P>
<P>So little skill or so small means had the courtiers, in James's
reign, for managing elections, that this house of commons
showed rather a stronger spirit of liberty than the foregoing;
and instead of entering upon the business of supply, as urged
by the King, who made them several liberal offers of grace<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Journ. 11 April 1614.</NOTE>,
they immediately resumed the subjct which had been
broached last parliament, and disputed his Majesty's power
of levying new customs and impositions, by the mere au∣thority
of his prerogative. 'Tis remarkable, that, in their
debates on this subject the courtiers frequently pleaded, as
a precedent, the example, of all the other hereditary mo∣narchs
in Europe, and mentioned particularly the kings of
France and Spain: nor was this reasoning received by the
house, either with surprize or indignation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 21 May 1614.</NOTE>. The mem∣bers
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
of the opposite party, either contented themselves with
denying the justness of the inference, or they disputed the
truth of the observation<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12, 21 May 1614.</NOTE>. And a patriot member in par∣ticular,
Sir Roger Owen, even in arguing against the impo∣sitions,
very frankly allowed, that the king of England was
endued with as ample power and prerogative as any prince in
Christendom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. 18 April 1614.</NOTE>. The nations on the continent, we may ob∣serve,
enjoyed still, in that age, some small remains of li∣berty;
and the English were possessed of little more.</P>
<P>THE commons applied to the lords for a conference with
reward to the new impositions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> A speech of Neile, bishop
of Lincoln, reflecting on the lower house, begot some alter∣cation
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. v. p. 290. So little fixed at this time were the rules of parliament, that the Commons complained to the Peers of a speech made in the Upper House by the bishop of Lincoln, which it belonged only to that house to cen∣sure, and which the other could not regularly be supposed to he acquainted with. These at least are the rules established since the Parliament became a real seat of power, and scene of busness. Neither the King must take no∣tice of what passes in either house, nor either house of what passes in the other, till regularly informed of it. The Commons, in their famous protesta∣tion 1621, fixed this rule with regard to the King, tho' at present they would not bind themselves by it. But as liberty was yet new, these maxims, which guard and regulate it, were unknown and unpractised.</NOTE>; and the King seized the opportunity of dissolving
immediately, with great indignation, a parliament, which
had shown so firm a resolution of retrenching his prerogative,
without communicating, in return, the smallest supply to his
necessities. He carried his resentment so far as even to throw
into prison some of the members, who had been the most for∣ward
in their opposition to his measures<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Kennet p. 696.</NOTE>. In vain did
he plead, in excuse for this violence, the example of Eli∣zabeth
and other princes of the line of Tudor. The peo∣ple
and the parliament, without abandoning for ever all their
liberties and privileges, could acquiesce in none of these pre∣cedents,
however frequent. And were the authority of such
precedents admitted, the utmost, that could be inferred is,
<PB N="13" REF="19"/>
that the constiution of England was, at that time, an in∣consistent
fabrick, whose jarring and discordant parts must
soon destroy each other, and from the dissolution of the old,
beget some new form of civil government, more uniform and
consistent.</P>
<P>IN the public and avowed conduct of the King and the
house of commons, throughout this whole reign, there ap∣pears
sufficient cause of quarrel and disgust; yet we are not
to imagine, that this was the sole foundation of that jealousy,
which prevailed between them. During debates in the
house, it often happened that a particular member, more
ardent and zealous than the rest, would display the highest
sentiments of liberty, which the commons contented them∣selves
to hear with silence and seeming approbation; and the
King, informed of these harangues, concluded the whole
house to be infected with the same principles, and to be en∣gaged
in a combination against his prerogative. The King,
on the other hand, tho' he valued himself extremely on his
king-craft, and was not altogether incapable of dissimulation,
seems to have been very little endued with the gift of secrecy;
but openly, at his table, in all companies, inculcated those
monarchical tenets, which he had so strongly imbibed. Be∣fore
a numerous audience, he had expressed himself with
great disparagement of the common law of England, and
had given the preference, in the strongest terms, to the ci∣vil
law: And for this indiscretion he found himself obliged to
apologize, in a speech to the former parliament<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">K. James's▪ Works, p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>32.</NOTE>. As a
specimen of his usual liberty of talk, we may mention a
story, tho' it passed some time a afterwards, which we meet with
in the life of Waller, and which that poet used frequently to
repeat. When Waller was young, he had the curiosity to
go to court; and he stood in the circle, and saw James dine;
where, among other company, there sat at table two bishops,
Neile and Andrews. The King proposed aloud this question,
<PB N="14" REF="20"/>
Whether he might not take his subjects money, when he
needed it, without all, this formality of parliament? Neile re∣plied,
<HI>God forbid you should not: For you are the breath of
our nostrils.</HI> Andrews declined answering, and said, he
was not skilled in parliamentary cases: But upon the King's
urging him, and saying he would admit of no evasion, the
bishop replied very pleasantly: <HI>Why then I think your Ma∣jesty
may very lawfully take my brother Neile's money: For
he offers it</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Preface to Waller's Works.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE favourite had hitherto escaped the inquiry of justice;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1615.</NOTE>
but he had not escaped that still voice, which can make itself
be heard amidst all the hurry and flattery of a court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somerset's fall.</NOTE>
and astonishes the criminal with a just representation of his
most secret enormities. Conscious of the murder of his
friend, Somerset received small consolation from the enjoy∣ments
of love, or the utmost kindness and indulgence of his
sovereign. The graces of his youth gradually disappeared,
the gaiety of his manners was obscured, his politeness and
obliging behaviour were changed into sullenness and silence.
And the King, whose affections had been engaged by these
superficial accomplishments, began to estrange himself from
a man, who no longer contributed to his amusement.</P>
<P>THE sagacious courtiers observed the first symptoms of
this disgust: Somerset's enemies seized the opportunity, and
offered a new minion to the King. George Villiers, a youth
of one-and-twenty, younger brother of a good family, re∣turned
at this time from his travels, and was remarked for
the advantages of a handsome person, genteel air, and fa∣shionable
apparel. At a comedy, he was purposely placed
full in James's eye, and immediately engaged the attention,
and, in the same instant, the affections of that monarch<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 30. Kennet, vol. ii. p. 693.</NOTE>.
Ashamed of his sudden attachment, the King endeavoured,
<PB N="15" REF="21"/>
but in vain, to conceal the partiality which he felt for the
handsome stranger; and he employed all his profound poli∣tics
to fix him in his service, without seeming to desine it.
He declared his resolution not to confer any office on him,
unless entreated by the Queen; and he pretended, that it
should only be in complaisance to her choice, he would agree
to admit him near his person. The Queen was immediately
applied to; but she, well knowing the extreme to which
the King carried these attachments, refused; at first, to lend
her countenance to this new passion. It was not till en∣treated
by Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury, a decent pre∣late,
and one much prejudiced against Somerset, that she
would condescend to oblige her husband, by asking this fa∣vour
of him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Coke, p. 46, 47. Rush vol. i. p. 456.</NOTE>. And the King, thinking now that all ap∣pearances
were fully saved, no longer constrained his affec∣tion,
but immediately bestowed the office of cup-bearer on
young Villiers.</P>
<P>THE whole court were thrown into parties between the two
minions; while some endeavoured to advance the rising
fortunes of Villiers, and others deemed it safer to adhere to
the established credit of Somerset. The king himself, di∣vided
between inclination and decorum, increased the doubt
and ambiguity of the courtiers; and the stern jealousy of
the old favourite, who refused every advance of friendship
from his rival, begot perpetual quarrels between their seve∣ral
partizans. But the discovery of Somerset's guilt in the
murder of Overbury, at last decided the controversy, and
exposed him to the ruin and infamy which he so well me∣rited.</P>
<P>AN apothecary's 'prentice, who had been employed in
making up the poisons, having retired to Flushing, began
to talk very freely of the whole secret; and the affair at
last came to the ears of Trumbal, the King's envoy in the
Low Countries. By his means, Sir Ralph Winwood, secre∣tary
<PB N="16" REF="22"/>
of state, was informed; and he carried the intelligence
immediately to James. The King, alarmed and astonished
to find such enormous guilt in a man whom he had admitted
into his bosom, sent for Sir Edward Coke, lord chief jus∣tice,
and earnestly recommended to him the most rigorous
and unbyassed scrutiny. This injunction was executed with
great industry and severity: The whole labyrinth of guilt
was carefully unravelled: The lesser criminals, Sir Jervis
Elvis, lieutenant of the Tower, Franklin, Weston, Mrs.
Turner, were first tried and condemned: Somerset and his
Countess were afterwards found guilty: Northampton's
death, a little before, had saved him from a like fate.</P>
<P>IT may not be unworthy of remark, that Coke, in the
trial of Mrs. Turner, told her, that she was guilty of the
seven deadly sins: She was a whore, a bawd, a sorcerer, a
witch, a papist, a felon, and a murderer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. i. p. 230.</NOTE>. And what
may more surprize us, Bacon, then attorney-general, took
care to observe, that poisoning was a popish trick<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 242.</NOTE>. Such
were the bigotted prejudices which prevailed in this age:
Poisoning was not, of itself, sufficiently odious, if it was not
represented as a branch of popery. Stowe tells us, that,
when the King came to Newcastle, on his first entry into
England, he gave liberty to all the prisoners, except those
confined for treason, murder, and papistry. When one
considers these circumstances, that furious bigotry of the
catholics, which broke out in the gunpowder conspiracy,
appears the less surprising.</P>
<P>ALL the accomplices in Overbury's murder received the
punishment due to their crime: But the King bestowed a
pardon on the principals, Somerset and the Countess. It
must be confessed, that James's fortitude had been highly
laudable, had he persisted in his first intention of consigning
over to severe justice all the criminals: But let us still be∣ware
of blaming him too harshly, if, on the approach of
<PB N="17" REF="23"/>
the fatal hour, he scrupled to deliver into hands of the
executioner, persons whom he had once favoured with his
most tender affections. To soften the rigour of their fate,
after some years imprisonment, he restored them to their
liberty, and conferred on them a pension, with which they
retired; and languished out old age in infamy and obscurity.
Their guilty loves were turned into the most deadly hatred;
and they passed many years together in the same house,
without any intercourse or correspondence with each
other<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 699.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SEVERAL historians<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Coke, Walden, &amp;c.</NOTE>, in relating these events, have in∣fisted
much on the dissimulation of James's behaviour, when
he delivered Somerset into the hands of the chief justice;
on the insolent menaces of that criminal; on his peremptory
refusal to stand a trial; and on the extreme anxiety of the
King during the whole progress of this affair. Allowing all
these circumstances to be true, of which some are suspicious,
if not palpably false<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">See Biog. Brit. article Coke, p. 1384.</NOTE>, the great remains of tenderness,
which James still felt for Somerset, may, perhaps, be suffi∣cient
to account for them. That favourite was high-spirited;
and resolute rather to perish than live under the infamy to
which he was exposed. James was sensible that the par∣doning
so great a criminal, which was of itself invidious,
would become still more unpopular, if his obstinate and
stubborn behaviour on his trial should augment the public
hatred against him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Bacon, vol. iv. p. 617.</NOTE>. At least, the urireserved confidence,
in which the, King had indulged his favourite for several
years, might render Somerset master of so many secrets, that
it is impossible, without farther light, to assign the particu∣lar
cause of that superiority, which, 'tis said, he appeared
so much to assume.</P>
<P>THE fall of Somerset,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rise of Bucking∣ham.</NOTE> and his banishment from court,
opened the way for Villiers to mount up at once to the full
<PB N="18" REF="24"/>
height of favour, of honours, and of riches. Had James's
passion been governed, by common rules of prudence, the
office of cup-bearer would have attached Villiers to his per∣son,
and might well have contented one of his age and fa∣mily;
nor would any one, who was not cynically austere,
have much censured the singularity of the King's taste in
amnsement. But such advancement was far inserior to the
fortune which he intended for his favourite. In the course
of a few years, he created him Viscount Villiers, Earl,
Marquis, and Duke of Buckingham, knight of the garter,
master of the horse, chief justice in Eyre, warden of the
cinque ports, master of the king's bench office, steward of
Westminster, constable of Windsor, and lord high admi∣ral
of England<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklin, p. 30. Clarendon, 8vo edit. vol. i. p. 10.</NOTE>. His mother obtained the title of Coun∣tess
of Buckingham: His brother was created Viscount
Purbeck; and a numerous train of needy relations were
all pushed up into credit and authority. And thus the
fond Prince, while he meant to play the tutor to his favou∣rite,
and to train him up in the rules of prudence and poli∣tics,
took an infallible method, by loading him with prema∣ture
and exorbitant honours, to render him, for ever, rash,
precipitant, and insolent.</P>
<P>A YOUNG minion to gratisy with pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1616.</NOTE> a necessitous
family to supply with riches, were enterprizes too great for
the empty exchequer of James. In order to obtain a little
money, the cautionary towns must be delivered up to th
Dutch; a measure which has been severely censured by al∣most
all historians; and I may venture to affirm, that tho'
it must be owned somewhat impolitic, it has been censured
much beyond its real weight and importance.</P>
<P>WHEN Queen Elizabeth advanced money for the support
of the infant republic; besides the view of securing herself
against the exorbitant power and ambition of Spain, she
<PB N="19" REF="25"/>
still reserved the prospect of re-imbursement;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cautionary towns deli∣vered.</NOTE> and she got
consigned into her hands the three important fortresses of
Flushing, the Brille, and Rammekins, as pledges for the
money which was due to her. Indulgent to the necessitous
condition of the states, she agreed that the debt should bear
no interest; and she stipulated, that, if ever England made
a seperate peace with Spain, she should pay the troops
which garrisoned those sortresses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvi. p. 341. Winwood, vol. ii. p. 351.</NOTE>. It appears from Jea∣nin's
letters, that the states had expected a very consider∣able
abatement of the debt, even at a time when James's
exchequer was in tolerable order, from the only considerable
supply which his parliament had ever granted him: much
more were they encouraged in this hope by his present ne∣cessitous
condition. In this negotiation they employed Ca∣ron,
their minister, who offered the King a little above the
third of the money which was due to him, and which
amounted in the whole to 818,408 pounds<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Win∣wood, ubi sup.</NOTE>. It occurred
to James, that the pay of the garrisons was so burthensome
on his slender revenue, that very large arrears were owing
them, and they were ready to mutiny for want of subsist∣ence<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12 April 1614.</NOTE>;
that, since the King's accession, above 300,000
pounds had been expended for their support, and there ap∣peared
no end of these charges; that by the strictest com∣putation,
the third of the sum, paid him presently, was much
preferable to the whole payable ten years after<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Money was then at ten per cent.</NOTE>; that the
states, trusting to his pacific maxims, as well as the close
union of interest and affection with his people, were no∣wise
anxious for the recovery of these places, and migh
allow them to lie long in his hands, if full payment was in∣sisted
on that this union was really so intimate, that no
reasonable measures for mutual support would be wanting
from the Dutch, even tho' freed from the dependence of
these garrisons that the exchequer of the republic was at
<PB N="20" REF="26"/>
present very low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of June.</NOTE> insomuch that they found difficulty, now
that the aids of France were withdrawn, to maintain them∣selves
in that posture of defence, which was requisite du∣ring
the truce with Spain; and that the Spaniards were
perpetually insisting with the King on the restitution of
these towns, as belonging to their crown; and no cordial
alliance could ever be made with that nation, while they
remained in the hands of the English<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 3.</NOTE>. These reasons,
together with his urgent wants, induced the King to accept
of Caron's offer; and he evacuated the cautionary towns,
which held the states in total subjection, and which an
ambitious and enterprizing prince would have regarded as
his most valuable possessions. This is the date of the full
liberty of the Dutch commonwealth.</P>
<P>WHEN the crown of England devolved on James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1617.</NOTE> it
might have been foreseen by the Scots nation, that the in∣dependence
of their kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> the object for which their ancestors had shed such an ocean of blood, would now be
utterly lost;<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> and that, if both states persevered in main∣taining
separate laws and parliaments, the weaker would
feel more sensibly the subjection, than if it had been totally
subdued by force of arms. But these views did not gene∣rally
occur. The glory of having given a sovereign to
their powerful enemy, the advantages of present peace and
tranquillity, the riches acquired from the munificence of
their master; these considerations secured, their dutiful obe∣dience
to a Prince, who daily gave such sensible proofs of
his friendship and partiality towards them. Never had the
authority of any king, who resided among them, been so
firmly established as was that of James, even when absent;
and as the administration had been hitherto conducted with
great order and tranquility, there had happened no occur∣rence
to draw thither our attention. But this summer, the
King was resolved to pay a visit to his native country, in
<PB N="21" REF="27"/>
order to renew his antient friendships and connexions, and
to introduce that change of ecclesiastical discipline and go∣vernment,
on which his mind was extremely bent. The
three chief points, which the King proposed to accomplish,
by his journey to Scotland, were the enlarging episcopal
authority, the establishing a few ceremonies in public wor∣ship,
and the fixing a superiority of the civil above the ec∣clesiastical
jurisdiction.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis an observation, suggested by all history, and by
none more than by that of James, and his successor, that
the religious spirit, when it mingles with faction, contains
in it something supernatural and unaccountable; and that,
in its operations upon society, effects correspond less to their
known causes than is found in any other circumstance of go∣vernment.
A reflection, which may, at once, afford a
source of blame against such sovereigns as lightly innovate in
so dangerous an article, and of apology for such, as being
engaged in an enterprize of that nature, are disappointed
of the expected event, and fail in their undertakings.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scotish nation were first seized with that zeal
for reformation, which, tho' it caused such disturbance du∣ring
the time, has since proved so salutary in the conse∣quences;
the preachers, assuming to themselves a character
little inferior to the prophetic or apostolical, disdained all
subjection to the spiritual rulers of the church, by whom
their innovations were punished and opposed. The reve∣nues
of the dignified clergy, no longer considered as sacred,
were either appropriated by the present possessors, or seized
by the more powerful barons; and what remained, after
mighty dilapidation, was, by act of parliament, annexed to
the crown. The prelates, however, and abbots, maintained
their temporal jurisdictions and their seats in parliament; and
tho' laymen were sometimes endowed with ecclesiastical ti∣tles,
the church, notwithstanding its frequent protestations
to the contrary, was still supposed to be represented by those
spiritual lords, in the states of the kingdom. After many
<PB N="22" REF="28"/>
struggles, the King, even before his accession to the throne
of England, had acquired sufficient influence over the Scots
clergy, to extort from them an acknowlegement of the par∣liamentary
jurisdiction of bishops; though attended with
many precautions, in order to secure themselves against the
spiritual encroachments of that order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1598.</NOTE>. When king of
England, he engaged them, tho' still with great reluctance
on their part, to advance a step farther, and to receive the
bishops as perpetual presidents or moderators in their eccle∣siastical synods;
re-iterating their protestations against all
spiritual jurisdiction of the prelates, and all controuling power
over the presbyters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1606.</NOTE>. And by such gradual innovations,
the King flattered himself, that he would quietly introduce
episcopal authority: But as his final scope was fully seen
from the beginning, every new advance gave fresh occasion
of discontent, and aggravated, instead of softening, the ab∣horrence
entertained against the prelacy.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered the King's aim more apparent, were the
endeavours, which, at the same time, he used to introduce
into Scotland some of the ceremonies of the church of Eng∣land:
The rest, it was easily foreseen, would soon, follow.
The fire of devotion, excited by novelty, and inflamed by
opposition, had so possessed the minds of the Scots reform∣ers,
that all rites and ornaments, and even order of wor∣ship,
were disdainfully rejected as useless burthens; retard∣ing
the imagination in its rapturous ecstasies, and cramping
the operations of that divine spirit by which they supposed
themselves to be animated. A mode of worship was established,
the most naked and most simple imaginable; one that
borrowed nothing from the senses; but reposed itself intirely
on the contemplation of, that divine essence which discovers
itself to the understanding only. This species of devotion, so
worthy of the supreme Being, but so little suitable to hu∣man
frailty, was observed to occasion great disturbances in
the breast, and in many respects to confound all rational
<PB N="23" REF="29"/>
principles of conduct and behaviour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1717.</NOTE> The mind, straining
for these extraordinary raptures, reaching them by short
glances, sinking again under its own weakness, rejecting all
exterior aid of pomp and ceremony, was so occupied in this
inward life, that it fled from every intercourse of society,
and from every sweet or chearful amusement, which could
soften or humanize the character. It was obvious to all dis∣cerning
eyes, and had not escaped the King's, that by the
prevalence of fanaticism, a gloomy and sullen disposition
established itself among the people; a spirit, obstinate and
dangerous; independent and disorderly; animated equally
with a contempt of authority, and a hatred to every other
mode of religion, particularly to the catholic. In order to
mellow these humours, James endeavoured to infuse a small
tincture of ceremony into the national worship, and to intro∣duce
such rites as might, in some degree, occupy the mind,
and please the senses, without departing too far from that simplicity,
by which the reformation was distinguished. The
finer arts too, tho' still rude in these northern kingdoms, were
employed to adorn the churches; and the King's chapel,
in which an organ was erected, and some picturs and sta∣tues
displayed, was proposed as a model to the rest of the
nation. But music was grating to the prejudiced ears of the
Scots clergy; sculpture and painting appeared instruments of
idolatry; the surplide was a rag of popery, and each mo∣tion
or gesture, prescribed by the liturgy, was a step to∣wards
that spiritual Babylon, so much the object of their
horror and aversion. Every thing was deemed impious, but
their own mystical comments on the scriptures, which they
idolized, and whose eastern prophetic style they employed
in every common occurrence of life.</P>
<P>IT will not be necessary to give a particular account of
the ceremonies which the King was so intent to establish.
Such institutions, for a time, are esteemed either too divine
to have proceeded from any other being than the supreme
Creator of the universe, or too diabolical to have been de∣rived

from other than an internal demon. But no sooner is
the mode or the controversy past, than they are universally
discovered to be of so little importance as scarce to be men∣tioned
with dignity amidst the ordinary course of human
transactions. It is here sufficient to remark, that the rites
introduced by James regarded the kneeling at the sacrament,
private communion, private baptism, confirmation of chil∣dren,
and the observance of Christmas and other festivals<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 25. Spotswood.</NOTE>.
These ceremonies were afterwards known by the name of
the articles of Perth, from the place where they were rati∣sied
by the assembly.</P>
<P>A CONFORMITY of discipline and worship between the
churches of England and Scotland, which was James's aim,
he never could hope to establish, but by first procuring an
acknowlegement of his own authority in all ecclesiastical
causes; and nothing could be more contrary to the practice
as well as principles of the presbyterian clergy. The eccle∣siastical
courts possessed the power of denouncing excom∣munication;
and that sentence, besides the spiritual con∣sequences
supposed to follow from it, was attended with
immediate effects of the most important nature. The per∣son
excommunicated was shunned by every one as prosane
and impious; and his whole estate, during his life-time, and
all his moveables, for ever, were forfeited to the crown.
Nor were the previous steps, requisite before insticting this
sentence, formal or regular, in proportion to the weight of
it. Without accuser, without summons, without trial, any
ecclesiastical court, however inferior, sometimes pretended,
in a summary manner, to pronounce a sentence of excom∣munication,
for any cause, and against any person, even
tho' he lived not within the bounds of their jurisdiction<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Spotswood.</NOTE>.
And, by this means, the whole tyranny of the inquisition,
tho' without its order, was introduced into the kingdom.</P>
<P>BUT the clergy contented not themselves with the unli∣mited
jurisdiction, which they exercised in ecclesiastical mat∣ters
<PB N="25" REF="33"/>
They assumed a censorial power over every part of ad∣ministration;
and, in all their sermons, and even prayers,
mingling politics with religion, they inculcated the most se∣ditious
and most turbulent principles. Black, minister of
St. Andrews, went so far<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1596.</NOTE>, in a sermon, as to pronounce
all kings the devil's children; he gave the Queen of England
the appellation of atheist; he said, that the treachery of the
King's heart was now fully discovered; and in his prayers
for the Queen he used these words; <HI>We must pray for her
for the fashion's sake, but we have no cause: She will ne∣ver
do us any good.</HI> When summoned before the privy
council, he refused to answer to a civil court for any thing
delivered from the pulpit, even tho' the crime, of which he
was accused, was of a civil nature. The church adopted
his cause. They raised a sedition in Edinburgh<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">17 Dec. 1596.</NOTE>. The
King, during some time, was in the hands of the enraged
populace; and it was not without courage, as well as dex∣terity,
that he was able to extricate himself<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Spotswood.</NOTE>. A few
days after a minister, preaching in the principal church of
that capital, said, that the King was possessed with a devil;
and, that one devil being expelled, seven worse had en∣tered
in his place<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. To which he added, that the
subjects might lawfully rise, and take the sword out of his
hand. Scarce, even during the darkest night of papal su∣perstition,
are there found such instances of priestly en∣croachments,
as the annals of Scotland present to us during
that period.</P>
<P>BY these extravagant stretches of power, and by the pa∣tient
conduct of James, the church began to lose ground,
even before the King's accession to the throne of England:
But no sooner had that event taken place, than he made the
Scots clergy sensible, that he was become the sovereign of a
great kingdom, which he governed with great authority.
Tho' formerly he would have thought himself happy to have
made a fair partition with them of the civil and ecclesiastical
<PB N="26" REF="34"/>
authority, he was now resolved to exert a supreme jurisdic∣tion
in church as well as state, and to put an end to their se∣ditious
practices. An assembly had been summoned at
Aberdeen<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">July 1604.</NOTE> but, on account of his journey to London,
he prorogued it to the year following. Some of the clergy,
disavowing his ecclesiastical supremacy, met at the time first
appointed, notwithstanding his prohibition. He threw them
into prison. Such of them as submitted, and acknowleged
their error, he pardoned. The rest he brought to their
trial. They were condemned for high treason. He gave
them their lives; but banished them the kingdom. Six of
them suffered this penalty<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Spotswood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE general assembly was afterwards induced<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">6th of June 1610.</NOTE> to ac∣knowlege
the King's authority in summoning ecclesiastical
courts, and to submit to the jurisdiction and visitation of the
bishops. Even their favourite sentence of excommunication
was declared invalid, unless confirmed by the ordinary.
The King recommended to the presbyteries, the members
whom they should elect to this assembly; and every thing
was conducted in it with little appearance of choice and liberty<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Spots∣wood.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY his own prerogative likewise, which he seems to have
stretched on this occasion, the King erected a court of high
commission<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">15 Feb. 1610.</NOTE>, in imitation of that established in England.
The bishops and a few of the clergy, who had been sum∣moned
together, willingly acknowledged this court; and it
proceeded immediately upon business, as if its authority
had been grounded on the full consent of the whole legis∣lature.</P>
<P>BUT James reserved the final blow for the time when he
should himself pay a visit to Scotland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th June.</NOTE> He proposed to the
Parliament, which was then assembled, that they should
enact, that, “whatever his Majesty should determine in the
external government of the church, with the consent of
<PB N="27" REF="35"/>
the archbishops, bishops, and a competent number of the
ministry, should have the force of a law”<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Spotswood. Franklyn, p. 29.</NOTE>. What num∣ber
should be deemed competent was not determined: And
their nomination was left intirely to the King: So that his
ecclesiastical authority, had this bill passed, would have been
established in its full extent. Some of the clergy protested.
They apprehended, they said, that the purity of their church
would, by means of this new authority, be polluted with
all the rites and liturgy of the church of England. James,
dreading clamour and opposition, dropped the act, which
had already passed the lords of articles; and asserted, that
the inherent prerogative of the crown contained more
power than was recognized by this bill.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th July.</NOTE> Some time after, he
called, at St. Andrews, a meeting of the bishops and thirty∣six
of the most eminent clergy. He there declared his reso∣lution
of exerting his prerogative, and of establishing, by
his own authority, the few ceremonies which he had recom∣mended
to them. They entreated him rather to summon a
general assembly, and to procure their consent. The King
asking, <HI>What assurance he might have of the assembly's con∣sent?</HI>
they answered, That they saw no reason to the con∣trary,
and knew that the assembly would yield to any reason∣able
demand of his Majesty. <HI>But if it fall out otherwise,</HI> said
the King, <HI>and my demand be refused; my difficulty shall be
the greater: And when I shall use my authority in establish∣ing
the ceremonies, they will call me tyrant and persecutor.</HI>
All crying out, that none could be so mad; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et experience,</HI>
said the King, <HI>tells me, that it may readily happen. There∣fore,
unless I be made sure, I will not give way to an assembly.</HI>
Galloway, one of the ministers, saying, that the
Archbishop of St. Andrews would answer for them, the
Archbishop refused: For that he had been deceived by
them, and had sufficiently experienced their breach of pro∣mise.
Then said Galloway, <HI>If your Majesty will trust me,
<PB N="28" REF="36"/>
I will answer for them</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Spotswood. Franklyn, p. 29.</NOTE>. The King consented; and an
assembly was summoned on the 25th of November en∣suing.</P>
<P>YET this assembly, which met after the King's depart∣ure
from Scotland, eluded all his applications; and it was
not till the subsequent year, that he was able to procure a
vote for receiving his ceremonies. And thro' every step of
this affair, in the parliament as well as in all the general
assemblies, the nation betrayed the utmost reluctance to
all these innovations; and nothing but James's importu∣nity
and authority had extorted a seeming consent, which
was belied by the inward sentiments of all ranks of people.
Even the few, over whom religious prejudices were not
prevalent, thought the national honour sacrificed by a ser∣vile
imitation of the modes of worship practised in England.
And every prudent man agreed in condemning the measures
of the King, who, by an ill-timed zeal for insignificant ce∣remonies,
had betrayed, tho' in an opposite manner, equal
narrowness of mind with the persons whom he treated with
such contempt. It was judged, that, had not these dan∣gerous
humours been irritated by opposition; had they been
allowed peaceably to evaporate; they would at last have sub∣sided
within the limits of law and civil authority. And as
all fanatical religions naturally circumscribe to very narrow
bounds the numbers and riches of the ecclesiastics; no
sooner is their first fire spent, than they lose the most dan∣gerous
part of their credit over the people, and leave them
under the natural and beneficent influence of their civil and moral obligations.</P>
<P>AT the same time that James shocked, in so violent a
manner, the religious principles of his Scots subjects, he
acted in opposition to those of his English. He had ob∣served,
in his progress thro' England, that a judaical ob∣servance
of the Sunday, chiefly by means of the puritans,
<PB N="29" REF="37"/>
was every day gaining ground throughout the kingdom,
and that the people, under colour of religion, were, contrary
to former practice, debarred from such sports and recreations
as contributed both to their health and their amusement<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 709.</NOTE>.
Festivals, which in other nations and ages are partly dedi∣cated
to public worship, partly to mirth and society, were
here totally appropriated to the offices of religion, and served
to nourish those sullen and gloomy contemplations, to which
the people were, of themselves, so unfortunately subject.
The King falsely concluded, that it would be easy to infuse
chearfulness into this dark spirit of devotion. He issued a
proclamation to allow and encourage, after divine service,
all kinds of lawful games and exercises; and, by his autho∣rity,
he endeavoured to give sanction to a practice which
his subjects regarded as the utmost profaneness and im∣piety<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 31. To show how rigid the English, chiefly the puritans, were in this particular, a bill was introduced into the House of Commons, in the 18th of the King, for the more strict observation of the Sunday, which they affected to call the Sabbath. One Shepherd opposed this bill, objected to the appellation of Sabbath as puritani∣cal, defended dancing by the example of David, and seems even to have justified sports on that day. For this profaneness he was expelled the house, by the suggestion of Mr. Pym. The House of Lords opposed so far this puritanical spirit of the Commons, that they proposed, that the appellation of <HI>Sabbath</HI> should be changed into that of <HI>Lord's Day.</HI> Journ. 15, 16 Feb. 1620. 28 May 1621. In Shepherd's sentence, his offence is said by the House to be great, exorbitant, unparalleled.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>AT the time when Sir Walter Raleigh was first confined
to the Tower,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. XLVIII.</NOTE> his violent and haughty temper had
rendered him the most unpopular man in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1618.</NOTE> and his
condemnation was chiefly owing to that public odium under
which he laboured.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Walter Raleigh's expedition.</NOTE> During the thirteen years imprison∣ment
which he suffered, the sentiments of the nation were
much changed with regard to him. Men had leisure to
reflect on the hardship, not to say injustice, of his sentence;
they pitied his active and enterprizing spirit, which lan∣guished
in the rigours of confinement; they were struck
with the extensive genius of the man, who, being educated
amidst naval and military enterprizes, had surpassed in the
pursuits of literature even those of the most recluse and se∣dentary
lives; and they admired his unbroken magnanimity,
which, at his age and under his circumstances, could en∣gage
him to undertake and execute so great a work as his
history of the world. To increase these favourable dispo∣sitions,
on which he built the hopes of recovering his li∣berty,
he spread the report of a golden mine, which he had
discovered in Guiana, and which was sufficient, according
to his representation, not only to inrich all the adventurers,
but to afford immense treasures to the nation. The King
gave little credit to these mighty promises; both because
he believed that no such mine as that described was any∣where
in nature, and because he considered Raleigh as a
<PB N="31" REF="39"/>
man of desperate fortunes, whose business it was, by any
means, to procure his freedom, and to reinstate himself in
credit and authority. Thinking, however, that he had al∣ready
undergone sufficient punishment, he released him
from the Tower; and when his vaunts of the golden mine
had engaged multitudes to assciate with him, the King
gave them permission to try the adventure, and, at their
desire, conferred on Raleigh authority over his fellow∣adventurers.
Tho' strongly sollicited, he still refused to
grant him a pardon, which seemed a natural consequence,
when he was intrusted with power and command. But
James declared himself still diffident of Raleigh's designs:
and he intended, he said, to reserve the former sentence, as
a check upon his future behaviour.</P>
<P>RALEIGH well knew, that it was far from the King's
purpose to invade any of the Spanish settlements: He there∣fore
firmly denied that Spain had planted any colonies on
that part of the coast where his mine lay. When the am∣bassador
of that nation, the famous Gondomar, alarmed at
his preparations, carried complaints to the King, Raleigh
still protested the innocence of his intentions: And James
assured Gondomar, that he durst not form any hostile at∣tempt,
and that he should pay with his head for so auda∣cious
an enterprize. But the minister wisely concluding,
that twelve armed vessels were not fitted out without some
purpose of invasion, conveyed the intelligence to the court
of Madrid, who immediately gave orders for arming and
fortifying all their settlements, particularly those along the
coast of Guiana.</P>
<P>WHEN the courage and avarice of the Spaniards and
Portuguese had discovered so many new worlds, they were
resolved to shew themselves superior to the barbarous hea∣thens
whom they invaded, not only in arts and arms, but
also in the justice of the quarrel: They applied to Alex∣ander
VI. who then filled the papal chair; and he gene∣rously
bestowed on the Spaniards the whole western, and on
<PB N="32" REF="40"/>
the Portuguese the whole eastern part of the globe. The
more scrupulous protestants, who acknowleged not the
authority of the Roman pontiff, established the first disco∣very
as the foundation of <HI>their</HI> title; and if a pirate or sea∣adventurer
of their nation had but erected a stick or stone
on the coast, as a memorial of his taking possession, they
concluded the whole continent to belong to them, and
thought themselves intitled to expel or exterminate, as
usurpers, the antient possessors and inhabitants. It was in
this manner that Sir Walter Raleigh, about twenty-three
years before, had acquired to the crown of England a claim
to the continent of Guiana, a region as large as the half
of Europe; and tho' he had immediately after left the
coast, he yet pretended that the English title to the whole
remained certain and indefeazable. But it had happened in
the mean time, that the Spaniards, not knowing or not ac∣knowleging
this imaginary claim, had taken possession of
a part of Guiana, had formed a settlement on the river
Oronooko, had built a little town called St. Thomas, and
were there working some mines of small value.</P>
<P>TO this place Raleigh directly bent his course; and, re∣maining
himself at the mouth of the river with five of
the largest ships, he sent up the rest to St. Thomas, under
the command of his son, and of captain Keymis, a person
intirely devoted to him. The Spaniards, who had expected
this invasion, fired on the English at their landing, were
repulsed, and pursued into the town. Young Raleigh, to
encourage his men, called out, <HI>That this was the true mine,
and none but fools looked for any other;</HI> and advancing upon
the Spaniards, received a shot, of which he immediately
expired. This dismayed not Keymis and the others. They
carried on the attack, got possession of the town, which
they afterwards set on fire; and found not in it any thing of
value.</P>
<P>RALEIGH did not pretend that he had himself seen the
mine, which he had engaged so many people to go in quest
<PB N="33" REF="41"/>
of: It was Keymis, he said, who had formerly discovered
it, and had brought him that lump of ore, which pro∣mised
such immense treasures. Yet Keymis, who owned
that he was within two hours march of the place, refused,
on the most absurd pretences, to take any effectual step to∣wards
the finding it; and he returned immediately to Raleigh,
with the melancholy news of his son's death, and the ill suc∣cess
of the enterprize. Sensible to reproach, and dreading
punishment for his behaviour, Keymis, in despair, retired
into his cabbin, and put an end to his own life.</P>
<P>THE other adventurers now concluded that they were de∣ceived
by Raleigh; that he never had known of any such
mine as he pretended to go in search of; that his intention
had ever been to plunder St. Thomas; and having encou∣raged
his company by the spoils of that place, to have thence
proceeded to the invasion of the other Spanish settlements;
that he expected to repair his ruined fortunes by such daring
enterprizes; and that he trusted to the money he should ac∣quire,
for making his peace with England; or if that view
failed him, that he proposed to retire into some other coun∣try,
where his riches would secure his retreat.</P>
<P>THE small acquisitions, gained by the spoil of St. Thomas,
discouraged Raleigh's companions from entering into these
views; tho' there were many circumstances in the treaty and
late transactions between the two nations, which invited them
to engage in such a piratical war against the Spaniards.</P>
<P>WHEN England made peace with Spain, the example
of Henry IV. was imitated, who, at the treaty of Vervins,
finding a difficulty in adjusting all questions with regard to
the Indian trade, had agreed to pass over that article in to∣tal
silence. The Spaniards, having, all along, published
fevere edicts against the intercourse of any European nation
with their colonies, interpreted this silence in their own fa∣vour,
and considered it as a tacit acquiescence of Eng∣land
in the established laws of Spain. The English, on
the contrary, pretended, that, as they had never been ex∣cluded
<PB N="34" REF="42"/>
by any treaty from commerce with any part of the
King of Spain's dominions, it was still as lawful for them to
trade with his settlements in either Indies, as with his Eu∣ropean
territories. In consequence of this ambiguity, many
adventurers from England failed to the Spanish Indies, and
met with severe punishment, when caught; as they, on the
other hand, often stole, and, when superior in power, forced
a trade with the inhabitants, and resisted, nay sometimes
plundered, the Spanish governors. Violences of this nature,
which had been carried to a great height on both sides, it
was agreed to bury in total oblivion; because of the diffi∣culty,
which was found, of remedying them, upon any fixed principles.</P>
<P>BUT as there appeared a great difference between pri∣vate
adventures in single ships, and a fleet acting under
a royal commission; Raleigh's companions thought it safest
to return immediately to England, and carry him along with
them to answer for his conduct. 'Tis pretended, that he
employed many artifices, first to engage them to attack
the Spanish settlements, and, failing of that, to make his
escape into France: But, all these proving unsuccess∣ful,
he was delivered into the King's hands, and strictly
examined, as well as his fellow-adventurers, before the
privy council. The council found no difficulty in pro∣nouncing,
that the former, suspicions, with regard to Ra∣leigh's
intentions, had been well grounded; that he had
abused the King in the representations which he had made
of his projected adventure; that he had acted in an offensive
and hostile manner against his Majesty's allies; and that he had
wilfully burned and destroyed a town belonging to the King
of Spain. He might have been tried either by common
law for this violence and piracy, or by martial law for breach
of orders: But it was an established principle among those of
the long robe, that, as he lay under an actual attainder for
high treason, he could not be brought to a new trial for
any other crime. To satisfy, therefore, the court of
Spain, who raised the loudest complaints against him, the
<PB N="35" REF="43"/>
King made use of that power which he had purposely re∣served
in his own hand, and signed the warrant for his ex∣ecution
upon the former sentence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>SOME of the facts in this narration, which seem to condemn Raleigh, are taken from the King's declaration, which being published by authority, when the facts were recent, being extracted from examinations before the privy council, and subscribed by six counsellors, among whom was Abbot archbishop of Canterbury, a prelate no-wife complaisant to the court, must be allowed to have great weight, or rather to be of undoubted credit. Yet the most material facts are confirmed either by the nature and reason of the thing, or by Sir Walter's own apology and his letters. The King's vindication is in the Harleyan miscellany, Vol. 3. No. 2.</P>
<P>1. THERE seems to be an improbability, that the Spaniards, who knew nothing of Raleigh's pretended mine, should have built a town, in so wide a coast, within three miles of it. The chances are extremely against such a supposition: And it is more natural to think, that the view of plun∣dering the town led him thither, than that of working a mine. 2. No such mine is there found to this day. 3. Raleigh in fact found no mine, and in fact he plundered and burned a Spanish town. Is it not more probable, therefore, that the latter was his intention? How can the secrets of his breast be rendered so visible as to counterpoise certain facts? 4. He confesses, in his letter to Lord Carew, that tho' he knew it, yet he concealed from the King the settlement of the Spaniards on that coast. Does not this fact alone render him sufficiently criminal? 5. His commission impowers him only to settle on a coast possessed by savage and barbarous inhabitants. Was it not the most evident breach of orders to disembark on a coast possessed by Spaniards? 6. His orders to Keymis, when he sent him up the river, are contained in his own apology, and from them it appears, that he knew (what was unavoidable) that the Spaniards would resist, and would oppose the Eng∣lish landing and taking possession of the country. His intentions, therefore, were hostile from the beginning. 7. Without provocation, and even when at a distance, he gave Keymis orders to dislodge the Spaniards from their own town. Could any enterprize be more hostile? And, considering the Spaniards as allies to the nation, could any enterprize be more criminal? Was he not the aggressor, even though it should be true that the Spaniards fired upon his men at landing? 'Tis said, he killed three or four hundred of them. Is that so light a matter? 8. In his letter to the King, and in his apology, he grounds his defence on former hostilities exercised by the Span ards against other companies of Englishmen. These are accounted for by the ambiguity of the treaty between the nations. And it is plain, that tho' these might possibly be reasons for the King's declaring war against that nation, they could never intitle Raleigh to declare war, and, without any commission, or contrary to his commission, to invade the Spanish settlements. He pretends indeed that peace was never made with Spain in the Indies: A most absurd notion! The chief hurt which the Spaniards could receive from England was in the Indies; and they never would have made peace at all, if hostili∣ties had been still to be continued on these settlements. By secret agreement, the English were still allowed to support the Dutch even after the treaty of peace. If they had also been allowed to invade the Spanish settlements, the treaty had been a full peace to England, while the Spaniards were still ex∣posed to the full effects of war. 9. If the claim to the property of that country, as first discoverer, was good, in opposition to present settlement, as Raleigh pretends; why was it not laid before the King with all its circum∣stances, and submitted to his judgment? 10. Raleigh's force is acknow∣leged by himself to have been insufficient to support him in the possession of St. Thomas against the power of which Spain was master on that coast; yet it was sufficient, as he owns, to take by surprize and plunder twenty towns. It was not therefore his design to settle, but to plunder. By these confes∣sions, which I have here brought together, he plainly betrays himself. 11. Why did he not stay and work his mine, as at first he projected? He appre∣hended that the Spaniards would be upon him with a greater force. But be∣fore he left England, he knew that this must be the case if he invaded any part of the Spanish colonies. His intention therefore never was to settle, but only to plunder. 12. He acknowleges that he knew neither the depth nor quantity of the mine, but only that there was some ore there. Would he have ventured all his fortune and credit on so precarious a foundation? 13. Would the other adventurers, if made acquainted with this, have risqued every thing to attend him? Ought a sleet to have been equipped for an ex∣periment? Was there not plainly an imposture in the management of this affair? 14. He says to Keymis, in his orders, Bring but a basket or two of ore, and it will satisfy the King, that my project was not imaginary. This was easily done from the Spanish mines; and he seems to have been chiefly displeased at Keymis for not attempting it. Such a view was a premeditated apology to cover his cheat. 15. The King in his declaration imputes it to Raleigh, that as soon as he was at sea, he immediately fell into such uncer∣tain and doubtful talk of his mine, and said, that it would be suffcient if he brought home a basketful of ore. From the circumstance last-mentioned, it appears, that this imputation was not without reason. 16. There are many other circumstances of great weight in the King's declaration; that Raleigh, when he fell down to Plymouth, took no pioneers along with him, which he always declared to be his intention; that he was no-way provided of instru∣ments for working a mine, but had a sufficient stock of warlike stores; that young Raleigh, in attacking the Spaniards, employed the words, which, in the narration, I have put into his mouth; that the mine was moveable, and shifted as he saw convenient: Not to mention many other public facts which prove him to be highly criminal against his companions as well as his coun∣try. Howel in his letters says, that there lived in London, in 1645, an offi∣cer, a man of honour, who asserted, that he heard young Raleigh speak these words, Vol. ii. Letter 63. That was a time when there was no interest in maintaining such a fact. 17. Raleigh's account of his first voyage to Guiana proves him to have been a man capable of the most extravagant cre∣dulity or most impudent imposture. So ridiculous are the stories which he tells of the Inca's chimerical empire in the midst of Guiana; the rich city of El Dorado, or Manao, two days journey in length, and shining with gold and silver; the old Peruvian prophecies in favour of the English, who, he says, were exprefly named as the discoverers of that country, long before any Eu∣ropean had ever touched there; the Amazons or republic of women; and in general, the vast and incredible riches which he saw on that continent, where nobody has yet found any treasures. This whole narration is a proof that he was extremely defective either in solid understanding, or morals, or both. No man's character indeed seems ever to have been carried to such extremes as Raleigh's, by the opposite passions of envy and pity. In the former part of his lif., when he was active and lived in the world, and was probably best known, he was the object of universal hatred and detestation throughout England; in the latter part, when shut up in prison, he became, much more unreasonably, the object of great love and admiration.</P>
<P>As to the circumstances of the narration, that Raleigh's pardon was re∣fused him, that his former sentence was purposely kept in force against him, and that he went out under these express conditions, they may be supported by the following authorities. 1. The King's word and that of six privy∣counsellors, who affirm it for fact. 2. The nature of the thing. If no suspicion had been entertained of his intentions, a pardon would never have been refused to a man to whom authority was entrusted. 3. The words of the commission itself, where he is simply stiled Sir Walter Raleigh, and not <HI>faith∣ful and well-beloved,</HI> according to the usual and never-failing stile on such occa∣sions. 4. In all the letters which he wrote home to Sir Ralph Winwood and to his own wife, he always considers himself as a person unpardoned, and liable to the law. He seems indeed, immediately upon the failure of his enter∣prize, to have become desperate, and to have expected the fate which he met with.</P>
<P>'TIS pretended, that the King gave intelligence to the Spaniards of Raleigh's project; as if he had needed to lay a plot for the destroying a man, whose life had been fourteen years, and still was, in his power. The Spaniards wanted no other intelligence to be on their guard, but the known and public fact of Raleigh's armament. And these was no reason why the King should conceal from them the project of a settlement, which Raleigh pretended, and the King believed to be intirely innocent.</P>
<P>THE King's chief blame seems to have lain in his negligence, in allowing Raleigh to depart without a more exact scrutiny: But for this he apologizes, by saying, that sureties were required for the good behaviour of Raleigh and all his associates in the enterprize; but that they gave in bonds for one another: A cheat which was not perceived till they had failed, and which increased the suspicion of bad intentions.</P>
<P>PERHAPS the King ought also to have granted Raleigh a pardon for his old treason, and to have tried him anew for his new offences. His punishment in that case would not only have been just, but conducted in a just and unexcep∣tionable manner. But we are told that a ridiculous opinion at that time prevailed in the nation (and it is plainly supposed by Sir Walter in his apo∣logy) that, by the treaty, war was allowed with the Spaniards in the Indies, tho' peace was made in Europe: And while that notion took place, no jury would have found Raleigh guilty. So that had not the King punished him upon the old sentence, the Spaniards would have had a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cause of complaint against the King sufficient to have produced a war, at least to have destroyed all cordiality betwixt the nations.</P>
<P>THIS explication I thought necessary, in order to clear up the story of Raleigh; which, tho' very obvious, is generally mistaken in so gross a man∣ner, that I know not its parallel in the whole English history.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<PB N="39" REF="47"/>
Raleigh. To execute a sentence, which was originally so
hard, which had been so long suspended, and which seemed
to have been tacitly pardoned by conferring on him a new
trust and commission, was deemed an instance of cruelty
and injustice. To sacrisice, to a concealed enemy of Eng∣land,
the life of the only man in the nation, who had a
high reputation for valour and military experience, was re∣garded
as meanness and indiscretion: And the intimate
connexions, which the King was now entering into with
Spain, being universally distasteful, rendered this proof of
his complaifance still more odious and unpopular.</P>
<P>JAMES had entertained an opinion, which was peculiar
to himself, and which had been adopted by none of his
predecessors, that any alliance, below that of a king, was
unworthy a prince of Wales; and he never would allow
other than a daughter of France or Spain, to be mentioned
as a match for his son<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 703, 748.</NOTE>. This instance of pride, which
really implied meanness, as if he could receive honour from
any alliance, was so well known that Spain had founded
on it the hopes of governing, in the most important trans∣actions,
this monarch, so little celebrated for politicks or
prudence. During the life of Henry, the King of Spain
had dropped some hints of bestowing on that Prince his
eldest daughter, whom he afterwards disposed of to the
young King of France, Lewis XIII. At that time, the
view of the Spaniards was to engage James into a neutra∣lity
with regard to the succession of Cleves, which was dis∣puted
between the protestant and popisn line<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 2.</NOTE>. But the bait
did not then take; and James, in confequence of his alli∣ance
with the Dutch, and Henry IV. of France, march∣ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1610.</NOTE>
4000 men, under the command of Sir Edward Cecil,
who joined these two powers, and put the Marquis of
Brandenburgh and the Palatine of Newbourg, in possession
of that duchy.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="48"/>
GONDOMAR was, at this time, the Spanish ambassador
in England; a man whose slattery was the more artful, be∣cause
covered with the appearance of frankness and since∣rity;
whose politics were the more dangerous, because dis∣guised
under the masque of mirth and pleasantry. He now
made offer of the second daughter of Spain to Prince
Charles; and, that he might render the temptation irre∣sistible
to the necessitous monarch, he gave hopes of an im∣mense
fortune which should attend the Princess. The court
of Spain, tho' determined to contract no alliance with a
heretic, entered into negotiations with James, which they
artfully protracted, and, amidst every disappointment, still
redoubled his hopes of success<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 71.</NOTE>. The transactions in Ger∣many,
so important to the Austrian greatness, became every
day a new motive for this duplicity of conduct.</P>
<P>IN that great revolution of manners which happened du∣ring
the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrec∣tions in Bo∣hemia.</NOTE> the only
nations who had the honourable, tho' often melancholy
advantage, of making an effort for their expiring privileges,
were such as, together with the principles of civil liberty,
were animated with a zeal for religious parties and opinions.
Besides the irresistible force of mercenary armies, the Euro∣pean
princes possessed this advantage, that they were de∣scended
from the antient royal families; that they continued
the same appellations of magistrates, the same appearance
of civil government; and restraining themselves by all the
forms of legal administration, could insensibly impose the
yoke on thein unguarded subjects. Even the German na∣tions,
who formerly broke the Roman chains, and restored
liberty to mankind, now lost their own liberty, and saw
with grief the absolute authority of their princes firmly
established amongst them. In their circumstances, nothing
but a pious zeal, which disregards all motives of human
prudence, could have made them entertain hopes of pre∣serving
<PB N="41" REF="49"/>
any longer those privileges, which their ancestors,
through so many ages, had transmitted to them.</P>
<P>As the house of Austria, throughout all her extensive do∣minions,
had ever made religion the pretence of their usur∣pations,
they now met with resistance from a like principle;
and the catholick religion, as usual, had ranged itself on the
side of monarchy; the protestant, on that of liberty. The
states of Bohemia, having taken arms against the Emperor
Mathias, continued their revolt against his successor Ferdi∣nand,
and claimed the observance of all the edicts enacted
in favour of the new religion, together with the restoration
of their antient laws and constitution. The neighbouring
principalities, Silesia, Moravia, Lusatia, Austria, even the
kingdom of Hungary, took part in the quarrel; and through∣out
all these populous and martial provinces, the spirit of
discord and civil war had universally dissused itself<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FERDINAND II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1619.</NOTE> who possessed more vigour and ability,
though not more lenity and moderation, than are usual with
the Austrian princes, strongly armed himself for the recovery
of his authority; and besides employing the assistance of his
subjects, who prosessed the antient religion, he engaged on
his side a powerful alliance of the neighbouring potentates.
All the catholick princes of the empire had embraced his
defence; even Saxony, the most powerful of the pro∣testant:
Poland had declared itself in his favour;<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 13, 1.</NOTE> and,
above all, the Spanish monarch, deeming his own interest
closely connected with that of the younger branch of his
family, prepared powerful succours from Italy, and from
the Low Countries; and he also advanced large sums for
the support of Ferdinand and of the catholic religion.</P>
<P>THE states of Bohemia, alarmed with these mighty pre∣parations,
began also to solicit foreign assistance; and, to∣gether
with that support, which they obtained from the
<PB N="42" REF="50"/>
evangelical union in Germany, they endeavoured to establish
connexions with greater princes. They cast their eyes on
Frederic, Elector Palatine. They considered, that, besides
the power of his own state, which was considerable, he was
son-in-law to the King of England, and nephew to Prince
Maurice, whose authority was become almost absolute in the
United Provinces. They hoped, that these princes, moved
by the connexions of blood, as well as by the tie of their
common religion, would interest themselves in all the fortunes
of Frederic, and would promote his greatness. They
therefore made him a tender of their crowm, which they
considered as elective; and the young Palatine stimulated
by ambition, without consulting either James<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 49.</NOTE> or Maurice,
whose opposition he foresaw, immediately accepted the of∣fer,
and marched all his forces into Bohemia, in support of
his new subjects.</P>
<P>THE news of these events no sooner reached England,
than the whole kingdom was on fire to engage in the quarrel.
Scarce was the ardour greater, with which all the states of
Europe, in former ages, flew to rescue the holy land from
the dominion of insidels. The nation, at that time, were
sincerely attached to the blood of their monarchs, and they
considered their connexion with the Palatine, who had mar∣ried
a daughter of England, as very close and intimate. And,
when they heard of catholics carrying on wars and perse∣cutions
against protestants, they thought their own interest
most deeply concerned, and regarded their neutrality as a
base desertion of the cause of God, and of his holy reli∣gion.
In such a quarrel, they would gladly have marched
to the opposite extremity of Europe, have plunged them∣selves
into a chaos of German politics, and have expended
all the blood and treasure of the nation, by maintaining a
contest with the whole house of Austria, at the very time,
and in the very place, in which it was the most potent, and
almost irresistible.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="51"/>
BUT James, besides that he had too little enterprize for
such vast undertakings, was restrained by another motive,
which had a mighty influence over him. He refused to patronize
the revolt of subjects against their fovereign. From
the very first he denied to his son-in-law, the title of the
King of Bohemia<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 12, 13.</NOTE>: He forbad him to be prayed for in the
churches under that appellation: And though he owned,
that he had no-wife examined the pretensions, privileges,
and constitution of the revolted states<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 48.</NOTE>; so exalted was his
idea of the rights of kings, that he concluded subjects must
ever be in the wrong, when they stood in opposition to
those, who had acquired or assumed that majestic title.
Thus, even in measures, founded on true politics, James
intermixed so many narrow prejudices, as lost him all his
authority, and exposed him to the imputation of weakness
and of error.</P>
<P>MEAN while,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1620.</NOTE> affairs every where hastened to a crisis.
Ferdinand levied a mighty force under the command of the
Duke of Bavaria and the Count of Bucquoy; and advanced
upon his enemy in Bohemia. In the Low Countries, Spi∣nola
collected a veteran army of thirty thousand men.
When Edmonds, the King's resident at Brussels, made re∣monstrances
to the Archduke Albert, he was answered, that
the orders for this armament had been transmitted to Spinola
from Madrid, and that he alone knew the secret intentions of
it. Spinola again told the minister, that his orders were still
sealed; and that, if Edmonds would accompany him in his
march to Coblentz, he would there open them, and give
him full satisfaction<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 44. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 14.</NOTE>. It was more easy to see his intentions,
than to prevent their success. Almost at one time, it was
known in England, that Frederic, being defeated in the
great and decisive battle of Prague, had fled with his family
into Holland, and that Spinola had fallen upon the Palati∣nate,

and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Loss of the Palatinate.</NOTE> meeting with no resistance, except from some
princes of the union, and from one English regiment of
2,400 men, commanded by the brave Sir Horace Vere<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 42, 43. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 15. Kennet, p. 723.</NOTE>, had,
in a little time, made himself master of the greatest
part of that principality.</P>
<P>HIGH were now the murmurs and complaints against the
King's neutrality and unactive disposition. The happiness and
tranquillity of their own country became distasteful to the
English, when they reflected on the oppressions and distresses
of their protestant brethren in Germany. They considered
not, that their interposition in the wars of the continent,
though agreeable to religious zeal, could not, at that time,
be justified by any sound maxims of politics; that, however
exorbitant the Austrian greatness, the danger was still too
distant to give any just alarms to England; that mighty resi∣stance
would yet be made by so many potent and warlike
princes and states in Germany, 'ere they would yield their
neck to the yoke; that France, now engaged to contract
a double alliance with the Austrian family, must necessarily
be soon rouzed from her lethargy, and oppose the progress
of so hated a rival; that in the farther advance of conquests,
even the interests of the two branches of that ambitious fa∣mily
must interfere, and beget mutual jealousy and opposi∣tion;
that a land-war, carried on at such a distance, would
waste the blood and treasure of the English nation, without
any hopes of success; that a sea-war, indeed, might be
both safe and successful against Spain, but would not affect
the enemy in such vital parts as to make them stop their
career of success in Germany, and abandon all their acqui∣sitions;
and that the prospect of recovering the Palatinate
being at present desperate, the affair was reduced to this
simple question, whether peace and commerce with Spain,
or the uncertain hopes of plunder and of conquests in the
Indies, were preferable? A question, which, at the begin∣ing
<PB N="45" REF="55"/>
of the King's reign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiati∣ons with Spain.</NOTE> had already been decided, and
perhaps with reason, in favour of the former advantages.</P>
<P>JAMES might have defended his pacific measures by such
plausible arguments: But these seem not to have been alto∣gether
the motives which swayed him. He had entertained
the Utopian notion, that, as his own justice and modera∣tion
had shone out so conspicuously through all these trans∣actions,
the whole house of Austria, though not awed by
the power of England, would willingly, from mere respect
to his virtue, submit themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o so equitable an arbitra∣tion.
He flattered himself with hopes, that, after he had
formed an intimate connexion with the Spanish monarch,
by means of his son's marriage, the restitution of the Palati∣nate
might be procured, from the motive alone of friend∣ship
and personal regard. He perceived not, that his un∣active
virtue, the more it was extolled, the greater contempt
was it exposed to. He was not sensible, that the Spanish match
was itself attended with such difficulties, that all his art
of negotiation would scarce be able to surmount them; much
less, that that match could in good policy be depended on,
as the means of procuring such extraordinary advantages.
His unwarlike disposition, increased by age, rivetted him still
faster in his errors, and determined him to seek the restora∣tion
of his son-in-law, by remonstrances and entreaties, by
arguments and embassies, rather that by blood and violence.
And the same defect of courage, which held him in awe of
foreign nations, made him likewise afraid of shocking the
prejudices of his own subjects, and kept him from openly
avowing the measures, which he was determined to pursue.
Or, perhaps, he hoped to turn these prejudices to account;
and, by their means, engage his people to furnish him with
supplies, of which their excessive frugality had hitherto made
them so sparing and reserved<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 47. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="56"/>
HE first tried the expedient of a benevolence or free-gift
from individuals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> pretending the urgency of the case, which
would not allow leisure for any other measure: But the jea∣lousy
of liberty was now rouzed, and the nation regarded
these pretended benevolences as real violences, contrary to
law and pernicious to freedom, however authorized by antient
precedent. A parliament was found to be the only resource,
which could furnish any large supplies; and writs were
accordingly issued for summoning that great council of the
nation.</P>
<P>THIS parliament is remarkable for being the epoch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1621.</NOTE> in
which were first regularly formed, though without acquiring
these denominations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of June.</NOTE> the parties of COURT and COUNTRY;
parties, which have ever since continued, and which, while
they oft threaten the total dissolution of the government, are
the real causes of its permanent life and vigour. In the an∣tient
feudal constitution, of which the English partook with
other European nations, there was a mixture, not of au∣thority
and liberty, which we have since enjoyed in this
island, and which now subsist uniformly together; but of
authority and anarchy, which perpetually shocked with each
other, and which took place alternately, according as cir∣cumstances
were more or less favourable to either of them.
A parliament, composed of barbarians, summoned from their
fields and forests, uninstructed by study, conversation, or
travel; ignorant of their own laws and history, and unac∣quainted
with the situation of all foreign nations; a parliament
called precariously by the King, and dissolved at his pleasure;
sitting a few days, debating a few points prepared for them,
and whose members were impatient to return to their own
castles, where alone they were great, and to the chace, which
was their favourite amusement: Such a parliament was very
little fitted to enter into a discussion of all the questions of go∣vernment,
and to share, in a regular manner, the legal ad∣ministration.
The name, the authority of the king alone
<PB N="47" REF="57"/>
appeared, in the common course of government; in extra∣ordinary
emergencies, he assumed, with still better reason,
the sole direction; the imperfect and unformed laws left, in
every thing, a latitude of interpretation; and when the
ends, pursued by the monarch, were, in general, agreeable
to his subjects, little scruple or jealousy was entertained,
with regard to the regularity of the means. During the
reign of an able, fortunate, or popular prince, no member
of either house, much less of the lower, durst think of en∣tering
into a formed party, in opposition to the court; since
the dissolution of the parliament must, in a few days, leave
him unprotected, to the vengeance of his sovereign, and to
those stretches of prerogative, which were then so easily
made, in order to punish an obnoxious subject. During an
unpopular and weak reign, the current commonly ran so
strong against the monarch, that none durst inlist themselves
in the court-party; or if the prince was able to engage any
considerable barons on his side, the question was decided
with arms in the field, not by debates or arguments in a fe∣nate
or assembly. And upon the whole, the chief circum∣stance,
which, during antient times, retained the prince in
any legal form of administration, was, that the sword, by
the nature of the feudal tenures, remained still in the hands
of his subjects; and this irregular and dangerous check had
much more influence than the regular and methodical limits
of the laws and constitution. As the nation could not be
compelled, it was necessary that every public measure of
consequence, particularry that of levying new taxes, should
seem to be adopted by common consent and approbation.</P>
<P>THE princes of the house of Tudor, partly by the vi∣gour
of their administration, partly by the concurrence of
favourable circumstances, had been able to establish a more
regular system of government; but they drew the constitu∣tion
so near to despotism, as diminished extremely the autho∣rity
of the parliament. That senate became, in a great de∣gree,
the organ of royal will and pleasure: Opposition would

<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
have been regarded as a species of rebellion: And even reli∣gion,
the most dangerous article in which innovations could
be introduced, had admitted, in the course of a few years,
four several alterations, from the authority alone of the sove∣reign.
The parliament was not then the road to honour and
preferment: The talents of popular intrigue and eloquence
were uncultivated and unknown: And though that assembly
still preserved authority, and retained the privilege of making
laws and bestowing public money, the members acquired
not, upon that account, either with prince or people, much
more weight and consideration. What powers were neces∣sary
for conducting the machine of government, the King
was accustomed, of himself, to assume. His own revenues
supplied him with money sufficient for his ordinary expences.
And when extraordinary emergencies occurred, the prince
needed not to solicit votes in parliament, either for the making
laws or imposing taxes, both of which were now become re∣quisite
for public interest and preservation.</P>
<P>THE security of individuals, so necessary to the liberty of
popular councils, was totally unknown in that age. And as
no despotic princes, scarce even the eastern tyrants, rule in∣tirely
without the concurrence of some assemblies, which sup∣ply
both advice and authority; little, but a mercenary force,
seems then to have been wanting towards the establishment of
a simple monarchy in England. The militia, though more
favourable to regal authority, than the feudal institutions, was
much inferior, in this respect, to disciplined armies; and if it
did not preserve liberty to the people, it preserved, at least,
the power, if ever the inclination should arise, of recover∣ing
it.</P>
<P>BUT so low, at that time, ran the inclination towards li∣berty,
that Elizabeth, the last of that arbitrary line, herself
no less arbitrary, was yet the most renowned and most popu∣lar
of all the sovereigns, who had filled the throne of Eng∣land.
It was natural for James to take the government as he
found it, and to pursue her measures, which he heard so
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>
much applauded; nor did his penetration extend so far as to
discover, that neither his circumstances nor his character
could support so extensive an authority. His narrow reve∣nues
and little frugality began now to render him dependent
on his people, even in the ordinary course of administration:
Their increasing knowlege discovered to them that advantage,
which they had obtained; and made them sensible of the
inestimable value of civil liberty. And as he possessed too
little dignity to command respect, and too much good-nature
to impress fear, a new spirit discovered itself every day in the
parliament; and a party, jealous of a free constitution, was
regularly formed in the house of commons.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding these advantages acquired to liber∣ty,
so extensive was royal authority, and so firmly establish∣ed
in all its parts, that it is probable the patriots of that age
would have despaired of ever resisting it, had they not been
stimulated by religious motives, which inspire a courage un∣surmountable
by any human obstacle.</P>
<P>THE same alliance, which has ever prevailed between
kingly power and ecclesiastical authority, was now fully
established in England; and while the prince assisted the
clergy in suppressing schismatics and innovators, the clergy,
in return, inculcated the doctrine of an unreserved submission
and obedience to the civil magistrate. The genius of the
church of England, so kindly to monarchy, forwarded the
confederacy; its submission to episcopal jurisdiction; its at∣tachment
to ceremonies, to order, and to a decent pomp and
splendor of worship; and in a word, its affinity to the tame
superstition of the catholics, rather than to the wild fanati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m
of the puritans.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, opposition to the church, and the per∣secutions
under which they laboured, were sufficient to throw
the puritans into the country party, and to beget political
principles little favourable to the high pretensions of the sove∣reign.
The spirit too of enthusiasm; bold, daring, and
uncontrouled; strongly disposed their minds to adopt repub∣lican
<PB N="50" REF="62"/>
tenets; and inclined them to arrogate, in their actions and
conduct, the same liberty, which they assumed, in their rap∣turous
flights and ecstasies. Ever since the first origin of that
sect, through the whole reign of Elizabeth as well as of
James, <HI>puritanical</HI> principles had been understood in a dou∣ble
sense, and expressed the opinions favourable both to po∣litical
and to ecclesiastical liberty<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">D'Erves, p. 328.</NOTE>. And as the court, in or∣der
to discredit all parliamentary opposition, affixed the de∣nomination
of puritans to its antagonists; the religious puri∣tans
willingly adopted this idea, which was so advantageous
to them, and which confounded their cause with that of the
patriots or country party. Thus were the civil and ecclesi∣astical
factions regularly formed; and the humour of the na∣tion,
during that age, running strongly towards fanatical ex∣travagancies,
the spirit of civil liberty gradually revived from
its lethargy, and by means of its religious associate, from
which it reaped more advantage than honour, it secretly en∣larged
its dominion over the greatest part of the kingdom.</P>
<P>IN this parliament, however, it must be owned, there ap∣peared,
at first, nothing but duty and submission on the part
of the commons; and they seemed determined to sacrifice
every thing, in order to maintain a good correspondence with
their prince. They would allow no mention to be made of
the new customs or impositions, which had been so eagerly
disputed in the former parliament<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Journ. 5 Dec. 1621.</NOTE>: The imprisonment of
the members of that parliament was here, by some, com∣plained
of; but, by the authority of the graver and more
prudent part of the house, that grievance was buried in ob∣livion<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Journ. 12, 16 Feb. 1620.</NOTE>:
And being informed, that the King had remitted
several considerable sums to the Palatine, they voted him two
subsidies without a negative<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Journ. 16 Feb. 1620.</NOTE>; and that too, at the very be∣ginning
of the session, contrary to the maxims frequently
adopted by their predecessors.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="63"/>
AFTERWARDS, they proceeded, but in a very temperate
manner, to the examination of grievances. They found,
that patents had been granted to Sir Giles Mompesson and Sir
Francis Michel, for the licensing inns and ale-houses; that
great sums of money had been levied, under pretext of these
licences; and that such innkeepers as prefumed to continue
their business, without satisfying the rapacity of the paten∣tees,
had been severely punished by fines, imprisonments,
and other vexatious prosecutions.</P>
<P>THE same persons had also procured a patent, which
they shared with Sir Edward Villiers, brother to Bucking∣ham,
for the sole making of gold and silver thread and lace,
and had obtained very extraordinary powers for preventing
any rivalship in these manufactures: They were armed with
authority to search for all goods, which might interfere with
their patent; and even to punish, at their own will and dis∣cretion,
the makers, importers, and venders of such com∣modities.
Many had grievously suffered by this exorbitant
jurisdiction; and the lace, which had been manufactured by
the patentees, was found universally to be adulterated, and
to be composed more of copper than of the precious me∣tals.</P>
<P>THESE grievances the commons represented to the King;
and they met with a very gracious and very cordial reception.
He seemed even thankful for the information given him; and
declared himself ashamed, that such abuses, unknowingly
to him, had crept into his administration. “I assure you,”
said he, “had I before heard these things complained of, I
would have done the office of a just King, and out of par∣liament
have punished them, as severely, and peradven∣ture
more, than you now intend to do<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 51. Rushworth, p. 25.</NOTE>.” A sentence was
past for the punishment of Michel and Mompesson<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 52. Rush∣worth, vol. i. p. 27.</NOTE>. It was
executed on the former. The latter broke prison and escaped.

and his guilt being less enormous or less appa∣rent
than that of the others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bacon's fall.</NOTE> he was easily protected by the
credit of his brother, Buckingham<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Yelverton the attorney general was accused by the commons for draw∣ing the patents for these monopolies, and for supporting them.

<P>ENCOURAGED by this success, the commons carried
their scrutiny, and still with a respectful hand, into other
abuses of great importance. The seals were, at that time,
in the keeping of the celebrated Bacon, created Viscount St.
Albans; a man universally admired for the greatness of his
genius, and beloved for the courteousness and humanity of
his behaviour. He was the great ornament of his age and
nation; and nought was wanting to render him the orna∣ment
of human nature itself, but that strength of mind,
which might check his intemperate desire of preferment,
that could add nothing to his dignity, and restrain his pro∣fuse
inclination to expence, that could be requisite neither
for his honour nor entertainment. His want of oeconomy
and his indulgence to servants had involved him in necessi∣ties;
and, in order to supply his prodigality, he had been
tempted to take bribes, and that in a very open manner,
from suitors in chancery. 'Tis pretended, that notwith∣standing
this enormous abuse, he had still, in the seat of
justice, preserved the integrity of a judge, and had given
just decrees against those very persons from whom he had
received the wages of iniquity. Complaints rose the louder
on that account, and at last reached the house of commons,
who sent up an impeachment against him to the peers. The
chancellor, conscious of guilt, deprecated the vengeance of
his judges, and endeavoured, by a general avowal, to escape
the confusion of a stricter inquiry. The lords insisted on a
<PB N="53" REF="67"/>
particular confession of all his corruptions. He acknow∣ledged
twenty-eight articles; and was sentenced to pay a fine
of 40,000 pounds, to be imprisoned in the Tower during
the King's pleasure, to be for ever incapable of any office,
place, or employment; and never again to sit in parliament,
or come within the verge of the court.</P>
<P>THIS dreadful sentence, dreadful to a man of nice sensi∣bility
to honour, he survived five years; and being released,
in a little time, from the Tower, his genius, yet unbroken,
supported itself amidst involved circumstances and a de∣pressed
spirit, and shone out in literary productions, which
have made his guilt or weaknesses be forgotten or overlooked
by posterity. In consideration of his great merit, the King
remitted his fine, as well as all the other parts of his sen∣tence,
conferred on him a large pension of 1800 pounds a
year, and employed every expedient to alleviate the weight
of his age and misfortunes. And that great philosopher, at
last, acknowleged with regret, that he had too long neglect∣ed
the true ambition of a fine genius; and by plunging into
business and affairs, which require much less capacity, but
greater firmness of mind, than the pursuits of learning, had
exposed himself to such grievous calamities.</P>
<P>THE commons had entertained the idea, that they were
the great patrons of the people, and that the redress of all
grievances must proceed from them; and to this principle
they were chiefly beholden for the regard and consideration
of the public. In the execution of this office, they now
kept their ears open to complaints of every kind; and they
carried their researches into many grievances, which, though
of no great importance, could not be touched, without sen∣sibly
affecting the King and his ministers. The prerogative
seemed, each moment, to be invaded; the King's authority,
in every article, was disputed; and James, who was willing
to correct the abuses of his power, would not submit to
have his power itself questioned and denied. After the
<PB N="54" REF="68"/>
house, therefore, had sat near six months, and had, as yet,
brought no considerable business to a full conclusion, the
King resolved, under pretence of the advanced season, to in∣terrupt
their proceedings; and he sent them word, that he was
determined, in a very little time, to adjourn them till
next winter. The commons made application to the lords,
and desired them to join in a petition for delaying the ad∣journment;
which was refused by the upper house. The
King regarded this project of a joint petition as an attempt
to force him from his measures: He thanked the peers for
their refusal to concur in it, and told them, that if it was
their desire, he would delay the adjournment, but would not
so far comply with the request of the lower house<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 35.</NOTE>. And
thus, in these great national affairs, the same peevishness,
which, in private altercations, often raises a quarrel from
the smallest beginnings, produced a mutual coldness and dis∣gust
between the King and the commons.</P>
<P>DURING the recess of parliament, the King used every
measure to render himself popular with the nation, and to
appease the rising ill humour of their representatives. He
had voluntarily offered to the parliament to circumscribe his
own prerogative, and to abrogate his power of granting any
monopolies for the future. He now recalled all the patents of
that kind, and redressed every article of grievance, to the
number of thirty-seven, which had ever been complained of
in the house of commons<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 36. Kennet, p. 733.</NOTE>. But he gained not the end,
which he proposed. The disgust, which had appeared at
parting, could not so suddenly be dispelled. He had like∣wise
been so imprudent as to commit to prison Sir Edwin Sandys<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1 Dec. 1621.</NOTE>, and Mr. Selden, without any known cause, be∣sides
their activity and vigour, in discharging their duty as
members of parliament. And above all, the transactions in
Germany were sufficient, when joined to the King's cau∣tions,
<PB N="55" REF="69"/>
negotiations, and delays, to inflame that jealousy of
honour and religion, which prevailed throughout the na∣tion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">To show to what degree the nation was enflamed with regard to the Palatinate, there recurs a remarkable story this session. One Floyd, a prisoner in the Fleet, a catholic, had dropt some expressions as if he were pleased with the misfortunes of the Palatine and his wife. The commons were in a flame; and pretending to be a court of judicatory and of record, proceeded to condemn him to a severe punishment. The house of lords checked this encroachment; and what was extraordinary, considering the present humour of the lower house, they acquiesced in the sentiments of the lords. This is almost the only pretension of the English commons, in which they have not prevailed. Happily for the nation, they have been successful in almost all their other claims. See Parliamentary History, vol. v. p 428, 429, &amp;c. Journ. 4, 8, 12, May, 1621.</NOTE>.
This summer, the ban of the empire was publish∣ed
against the Elector Palatine; and the execution of it was
committed to the Duke of Bavaria<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 73.</NOTE>. The Upper Palatinate
was, in a little time, conquered by that prince, and mea∣sures
were taking in the empire for bestowing on him the
electoral dignity, of which the Palatine was despoiled. Fre∣deric
now lived with his numerous family, in poverty and
distress, either in Holland, or at Sedan with his uncle the
Duke of Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illon. And throughout all the new conquests
in both the Palatinates as well as in Bohemia, Austria, Lu∣satia,
the progress of the Austrian arms was attended with
rigours and severities, exercised against the professors of the
reformed religion.</P>
<P>THE zeal of the commons immediately moved them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of Nov.</NOTE>
upon their assembling, to take all these transactions into con∣sideration.
They framed a remonstrance, which they in∣tended
to carry to the King. They represented, that the
enormous growth of the Austrian power threatened the liber∣ties
of all Europe; that the progress of the catholic religion
in England bred the most melancholy apprehensions, lest it
should again acquire an ascendant in the kingdom; that the
indulgence of his Majesty towards the professors of that re∣ligion
had encouraged their insolence and temerity; that the
uncontrouled conquests, made by the Austrian family in
<PB N="56" REF="70"/>
Germany, raised mighty expectations in the English papists;
but above all, that the prospect of the Spanish match ele∣vated
them so far as to hope for an intire toleration, if not
a final re-establishment of their religion. The commons,
therefore, entreated his Majesty, that he would immedi∣ately
undertake the defence of the Palatine, and maintain
it by force of arms; that he would turn his sword against
Spain, whose armies and treasures were the chief support
of the catholic interest in Europe; that he would enter into
no negotiation for the marriage of his son but with a pro∣testant
princess; that the children of popish recusants
should be taken from their parents, and be committed to the
care of protestant teachers and schoolmasters; and that the
fines and confiscations, to which the catholics were by law
liable, should be levied with the utmost severity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 58, 59. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 40, 41. Kennet, p. 737.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this <HI>bold</HI> step, unprecedented in England for many
years, and scarce ever heard of in peaceable times, the com∣mons
attacked at once all the King's favourite maxims of
government; his cautious and pacific measures, his lenity
towards the Romish religion, and his attachment to the Spa∣nish
alliance, from which he promised himself such mighty
advantages. But what most disgusted him was, their seem∣ing
invasion of his prerogative, and their pretending, under
colour of advice, to direct his conduct in such transactions,
as had ever been acknowleged to belong solely to the ma∣nagement
and direction of the sovereign. He was, at that
time, absent at Newmarket; but so soon as he heard of the
intended remonstrance of the commons, he wrote a letter
to the speaker, in which he sharply rebuked the house for
debating openly of matters far above their reach and capa∣city,
and he strictly forbad them to meddle with any thing,
that regarded his government or deep matters of state, and
especially not to touch on his son's marriage with the daugh∣ter
of Spain, nor to attack the honour of that King or any
other of his friends and confederates. In order the more
<PB N="57" REF="71"/>
to terrify them, he mentioned the imprisonment of Sir Ed∣win
Sandys; and though he denied, that the confinement
of that member had been owing to any offence committed
in the house, yet he plainly told them, that he thought
himself fully intitled to punish every misdemeanour in par∣liament,
as well during its sitting as after its dissolution;
and that he intended thenceforward to chastize any man,
whose insolent behaviour there should minister occasion of
offence<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 60. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 43. Kennet, p. 741.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>violent</HI> letter, in which the King, though he here
imitated former precedents of Elizabeth, may be thought
not to have acted altogether on the defensive, had the effect,
which might naturally have been expected from it: The
commons were enflamed, not terrified. Conscious of their
own popularity, and of the bent of the nation towards a
war with the catholics abroad, and the persecution of popery
at home, they little dreaded the menaces of a prince, who
was unsupported by a military force, and whose gentle
temper would, of itself, so soon disarm his severity. In a
new remonstrance, therefore, they still insisted on their
former remonstrance and advice; and they maintained,
though in respectful terms, that they were intitled to inter∣pose
with their council in all matters of government; that
it was their antient and undoubted right, and an inheritance
transmitted to them from their ancestors, to possess intire
freedom of speech in their debates of public business; and
that, if any member abused this liberty, it belonged to the
house alone, who were witnesses of his offence, to inflict a
proper censure upon him<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn p. 60. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 44. Kennet, p. 741.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So <HI>vigorous</HI> an answer was no wise calculated to appease
the King. 'Tis said, when the approach of the committee,
who were to present it, was notified to him, he ordered
twelve chairs to be brought: For that there were so many
<PB N="58" REF="72"/>
kings a coming<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 743.</NOTE>. His answer was prompt and sharp. He
told the house, that their remonstrance was more like a de∣nunciation
of war than an address of dutiful subjects; that
their pretension to inquire into all state-affairs, without ex∣ception,
was such a plenipotence as none of their ancestors,
even during the reign of the weakest princes, had ever pre∣tended
to; that public transactions depended on a compli∣cation
of views and intelligence, with which they were in∣tirely
unacquainted; that they could not better show their
wisdom, as well as duty, than by keeping within their
proper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ne sutor ultra crepidam.</HI> This expression is imagined to be insolent and disobliging: But it was a Latin proverb famili∣arly used on all occasions.</NOTE> sphere; and that in any business, which depended
on his prerogative, they had no title to interpose with their
advice, except when he was pleased to desire it. And he
concluded with these memorable words; <HI>And though we
cannot allow of your stile, in mentioning your antient and
undoubted right and inheritance, but would rather have
wished, that ye had said, that your privileges were derived
from the grace and permission of our ancestors and us (for
the most of them grew from precedents, which shows rather
a toleration than inheritance); yet we are pleased to give
you our royal assurance, that as long as you contain your∣selves
within the limits of your duty, we will be as careful
to maintain and preserve your lawful liberties and privileges
as ever any of our predecessors were, nay, as to preserve our
own royal prerogative</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 62, 63, 64. Rushworth, vol i. p. 46, 47, &amp;c. Kennet, p. 743.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS open pretension of the King deservedly gave great
alarm to the house of commons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Dec.</NOTE> They saw their title to
every privilege, if not plainly denied, yet considered, at
least, as very precarious. It might be forfeited by abuse,
and they had already abused it. They thought proper,
therefore, immediately to oppose pretension to pretension.
<PB N="59" REF="73"/>
They framed a protestation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestation of the com∣mons.</NOTE> where they repeated all their
former claims for freedom of speech, and an unbounded
authority to interpose with their advice and counsel. And
they asserted, <HI>That the liberties, franchises, privileges, and
jurisdictions of parliament are the antient and undoubted
birth-right and inheritance of the subjects of England</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This protestation is so remarkable, that it may not be improper to give it in its own words. “The commons now assembled in parliament, being justly occasioned thereunto, concerning sundry liberties, franchises, and privileges of parliament, amongst others here mentioned, do make this protestation following; That the liberties, franchises, and jurisdictions of parliament are the antient and undoubted birth-right and inheritance of the subjects of England; and that the urgent and arduous affairs con∣cerning the king, state, and defence of the realm and of the church of England; and the maintenance and making of laws, and redress of mischiess and grievances, which daily happen within this realm, are proper subjects and matter of council and debate in parliament, and that in the handling and proceeding of those businesses, every member of the house of parliament hath, and, of right, ought to have, freedom of speech to propound, treat, reason, and bring to conclusion the same; and that the commons in parliament have like liberty and freedom to treat of these matters, in such order as in their judgment shall seem fittest, and that every member of the said house hath like freedom from all im∣peachment, imprisonment, and molestation (other than by censure of the house itself) for or concerning any speaking, reasoning, or declaring of any matter or matters touching the parliament or parliament-business. And that if any of the said members be complained of and questioned for any thing done or said in parliament, the same is to be shown to the King by the advice and assent of all the commons assembled in parlia∣ment, before the King give credence to any private information.” Frank∣lyn, p. 65. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 53. Kennet, p. 747. Coke, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, informed of these increasing heats and jea∣lousies
in the house, hurried to town. He sent immediately
for the journal-book of the commons; and, with his own
hand, before the council, he tore out this protestation<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 18 Dec. 1621.</NOTE>;
and ordered his reasons to be inserted in the council-book.
He was doubly displeased, he said, with the protestation of
the lower house, on account of the manner of framing it,
as well as of the matter which it contained. It was tumul∣tuously
<PB N="60" REF="74"/>
voted, at a late hour, and in a thin house; and it was
expressed in such general and ambiguous terms, as might
serve for a foundation to the most enormous claims, and
to the most unwarrantable usurpations upon his preroga∣tive<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 65.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE meeting of the house might have proved dangerous
after so violent a breach. It was no longer possible, while
men were in such a temper, to finish any business. The
King, therefore, prorogued the parliament, and soon after
dissolved it by proclamation; in which he also made an apo∣logy
to the public for his whole conduct.</P>
<P>THE leading members of the house, Sir Edward Coke
and Sir Robert Philips, were committed to the Tower:
Selden, Pym, and Mallory to other prisons<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">lb. p. 66. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 55.</NOTE>. As a lighter
punishment, Sir Dudley Digges, Sir Thomas Crew, Sir
Nathaniel Rich, Sir James Perrot, joined in commission
with others, were sent to Ireland, in order to execute some
business<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Frank∣lyn, p. 66. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 55.</NOTE>. The King, at that time, enjoyed, at least ex∣ercised,
the prerogative of employing any man, even with∣out
his consent, in any branch of public service.</P>
<P>SIR John Saville, a powerful man in the house of com∣mons,
and a zealous opponent of the court, was made
comptroller of the houshold, a privy counsellor, and
soon after, a baron<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 749.</NOTE> This event is memorable; as be∣ing
the first instance, perhaps, in the whole history of
England, of any king's advancing a man, on account of
parliamentary interest, and of opposition to his measures.
However irregular this practice, it will be regarded by po∣litical
reasoner, as one of the most early and most infalli∣ble
symptoms of a regular established liberty.</P>
<P>THE King having thus, with so rash and indiscreet a
hand, torn off that secret veil, which had hitherto covered
<PB N="61" REF="75"/>
the English constitution, and which threw an obscurity upon
it, so advantageous to royal prerogative, every man began
to indulge himself in political reasonings and inquiries; and
the same factions, which commenced in parliament, were
propagated throughout the nation. In vain did James,
by re-iterated proclamations, forbid the discoursing of state
affairs<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 56. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 21, 36, 55. The King also, in imitation of his predecessors, gave rules to preachers. Franklyn, p. 70. The pulpit was at that time much more dangerous than the press.</NOTE>. Such proclamations, if they had any effect, served
rather to inflame the curiosity of the public. And in every
company or society, the late transactions became the subject
of argument and debate.</P>
<P>ALL history, said the partizans of the court, as well as
the history of England, justify the King's position with
regard to the origin of popular privileges; and every rea∣sonable
man must allow, that, as monarchy is the most
simple form of government, it must first have occurred to
rude and uninstructed mankind. The other complicated
and artificial additions were the successive invention of
sovereigns and legislators; or, if they were obtruded on
the prince by seditious subjects, their origin must appear,
on that account, still more precarious and unfavourable. In
England, the authority of the King, in all the exterior
forms of government and in the common style of law, ap∣pears
totally absolute and sovereign; nor does the real spirit
of the constitution, as it has ever discovered itself in prac∣tice,
fall much short of these appearances. The parlia∣ment
is created by his will; by his will it is dissolved. 'Tis
his will alone, though at the desire of both houses, which
gives authority to laws. To all foreign nations, the ma∣jesty
of monarch seems to merit sole attention and regard.
And no subject, who has exposed himself to royal indig∣nation,
can propose to live with safety in the kingdom; nor
can he even leave it, according to law, without the consent
<PB N="62" REF="76"/>
of his master. If a magistrate, invironed with such power
and splendor, should consider his authority as sacred, and
regard himself as the anointed of heaven, his pretensions
may bear a very favourable construction. Or, allowing
them to be merely pious frauds, we need not be surprized,
that the same stratagem, which was practised by Minos,
Numa, and the most celebrated legislators of antiquity,
should now, in these restless and inquisitive times, be em∣ployed
by the King of England. Subjects are not raised
above that quality, though assembled in parliament. The
same humble respect and deference is still due to their prince.
Though he indulges them in the privilege of laying before
him their domestic grievances, with which they are supposed
to be best acquainted, this warrants not their bold intrusion
into each province of government. And, to every judici∣ous
examiner, it must appear, “That the lines of duty
are as much transgressed by a more independent and less
respectful exercise of acknowleged powers, as by the
usurpation of such as are new and unusual.”</P>
<P>THE lovers of liberty, throughout the nation, reasoned
after a very different manner. 'Tis in vain, said they, that
the King traces up the English government to its first origin,
in order to represent the privileges of parliament as depend∣ent
and precarious: The prescription and practice of so
many ages, must, long ere this time, have given a sanction
to these assemblies, even though they had been derived from
an origin no more dignified, than that which he assigns
them. If the written records of the English nation, as asserted,
represent parliaments to have arisen from the con∣sent
of monarchs, the principles of human nature, when
we trace government a step higher, must show us, that
monarchs themselves owe all their authority to the volun∣tary
submission of the people. But, infact, no age can be
shown, when the English government was altogether an un∣mixed
<PB N="63" REF="77"/>
monarchy: And if the privileges of the nation have,
at any particular period, been overpowered by violent ir∣ruptions
of foreign force or domestic usurpation; the ge∣nerous
spirit of the people has ever seized the first opportu∣nity
of re-establishing the antient government and constitu∣tion.
Though in the style of the laws, and in the usual
forms of administration, the royal authority may be repre∣sented
as sacred and supreme; whatever is essential to the
exercise of sovereign and legislative power, must still be re∣garded
as equally divine and inviolable. Or, if any dis∣tinction
be made in this respect, the preference is rather due
to those national councils, by whose interposition the exor∣bitancies
of tyrannical power are restrained, and that sacred
liberty is preserved, which heroic spirits, in all ages, have
deemed more precious than life itself. Nor is it sufficient to say,
that the mild and equitable administration of James, affords
little occasion, or no occasion, of complaint. However
moderate the exercise of his prerogative, however exact his
observance of the laws and constitution; “If he founds his
authority on arbitrary and dangerous principles, it is re∣quisite
to watch him with equal care, and to oppose him
with equal vigour, as if he had indulged himself in all
the excesses of cruelty and tyranny.”</P>
<P>AMIDST all these disputes, the wife and moderate in the
nation endeavoured to preserve as much as possible, an
equitable neutrality between the opposite parties; and the
more they reflected on the course of public affairs, the
greater difficulty they found of fixing just sentiments with
regard to them. On the one hand, they regarded the very
rise of opposite parties as a happy prognostic of the esta∣blishment
of liberty; nor could they ever expect to enjoy,
in a mixed government, so invaluable a blessing, without
suffering that inconvenience, which, in such governments, has
ever attended it. But, when they considered, on the other
hand, the necessary aims and pursuits of both parties, they
<PB N="64" REF="78"/>
were struck with apprehension of the consequences, and
could discover no feasible plan of accommodation between
them. From long practice, the crown was now possessed
of so exorbitant a prerogative, that it was not sufficient for
liberty to remain on the defensive, or endeavour to secure
the little ground, which was left her: It was become neces∣sary
to carry on an offensive war, and to circumscribe, within
more narrow, as well as more exact bounds, the authority
of the sovereign. Upon such provocation, it could not but
happen, that the prince, however just and moderate, would
endeavour to repress his opponents; and, as he stood upon
the very brink of arbitrary power, it was to be feared,
that he would, hastily and unknowingly, pass those limits,
which were not precisely marked by the constitution. The
turbulent government of England, ever <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luctuating between
privilege and prerogative, would afford a variety of prece∣dents,
which might be pleaded on both sides. In such deli∣cate
questions, the people must be divided: The arms of
the state were still in their hands: A civil war must ensue;
a civil war, where no party or both parties would justly bear
the blame, and where the good and virtuous would scarce
know what vows to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orm; were it not that liberty, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cessary

all his applications. When Lord Digby, his ambassador to

of his dominions, were vigorous. Three armies were
levied in Germany by his authority, under three com∣manders,
Duke Christian of Brunswick, the Prince of
Baden-Dourlach, and Count Mans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eldt. The two former
generals were defeated by Count Tilly and the Imperialists:
The third, tho' much inferior in force to his enemies, still
maintained the war; but with no equal supplies of money
either from the Palatine or the King of England. It was
chiefly by pillage and free quarters in the Palatinate, that
he subsisted his army. As the Austrians were regularly
paid, they were kept in more exact discipline; and James
became justly apprehensive, lest so unequal a contest, besides
ravaging the Palatine's hereditary dominions, would end in
the total alienation of the people from their antient sove∣reign,
by whom they were plundered, and in an attach∣ment
to their new masters, by whom they were protected<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. v. p. 484.</NOTE>.
<PB N="67" REF="83"/>
He therefore wisely persuaded his son-in-law to disarm, under
colour of duty and submission to the Emperor: And accord∣ingly,
Mansfeldt was dismissed from the Palatine's service;
and that famous general withdrew his army into the Low
Countries, and there received a commission from the states
of the United Provinces.</P>
<P>To shew how little account was made of James's nego∣tiations
abroad, there is a pleasantry which is mentioned by
all historians, and which, for that reason, shall have place
here. In a farce, acted at Brussels, a courier was intro∣duced
carrying the doleful news, that the Palatinate would
soon be wrested from the house of Austria; so powerful
were the succours, which, from all quarters, were hastening
to the relief of the despoiled Elector: The King of Den∣mark
had agreed to contribute to his assistance a hundred
thousand pickled herrings, the Dutch a hundred thousand
butter-boxes, and the King of England a hundred thousand
ambassadors. On other occasions, he was painted with a
scabbard, but without a sword; or with a sword which no∣body
could draw, though several were pulling at it<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Kennet, p. 749.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was not from his negotiations with the Emperor or
the Duke of Bavaria, that James expected any success in
his project of restoring the Palatine: His eyes were intirely
turned towards Spain; and if he could effectuate his son's
marriage with the Infanta, he doubted not, but that, after
so intimate a conjunction, this other point could easily be
obtained. The negotiations of that court being naturally
dilatory, it was not easy for a prince of so little penetration in
business, to distinguish whether the difficulties which occurred
were real or affected; and he was surprized, after negotiate∣ing
five years on so simple a demand, that he was not more
advanced than at the beginning. The dispensation of Rome
was requisite for the marriage of the Infanta with a protest∣ant
<PB N="68" REF="84"/>
prince; and the King of Spain, having undertaken to
procure that dispensation, had thereby acquired the means
of retarding at pleasure, or of forwarding the marriage,
and at the same time of concealing intirely his artifices from
the court of England.</P>
<P>IN order to remove all obstacles, James dispatched Digby,
soon afterwards created Earl of Bristol, as his ambassador
to Philip IV. who had lately succeeded his father in the
crown of Spain. He secretly employed Gage as his agent
at Rome; and finding that the difference of religion was
the principal, if not sole difficulty which retarded the mar∣riage,
he resolved to soften that objection as much as pos∣sible.
He issued public orders for discharging all popish
recusants who were imprisoned; and it was daily appre∣hended,
that he would forbid, for the future, the execution
of the penal laws enacted against them. For this step, so
opposite to the rigid spirit of his subjects, he took care to
apologize; and he even endeavoured to ascribe it to his
great zeal for the reformed religion. He had been making
applications, he said, to all foreign princes for some indulg∣ence
to the distressed protestants; and he was still answered
by objections derived from the severity of the English laws
against catholics<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 69. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 63.</NOTE>. And indeed, it might probably occur
to him, that, if the extremity of religious zeal was ever to
abate among the christian sects, one of them must begin;
and nothing would be more honourable for England, than
to have led the way in sentiments so wise and moderate.</P>
<P>NOT only the religious puritans murmured at this tole∣rating
measure of the King: The lovers of civil liberty
were alarmed at so important an exertion of his prerogative.
But, among other dangerous articles of authority, the
Kings of England were at that time possessed of the dispens∣ing
power; at least, were in the constant practice of exer∣cising
it. Besides, tho' the royal prerogative in civil mat∣ters
<PB N="69" REF="85"/>
was then exorbitant, the princes, during some late
reigns, had been accustomed to assume still higher in eccle∣siastical.
And the King failed not to represent the tolera∣tion
of catholics as a measure intirely of that nature.</P>
<P>BY James's concession in favour of the catholics, he ob∣tained
his end. The same religious motives, which had hi∣therto
rendered the court of Madrid insincere in all the steps
taken with regard to the marriage, were now the chief
cause of promoting it. By its means, it was there hoped
the English catholics would for the future enjoy ease and
indulgence; and the Infanta would be the happy instrument
of procuring to the church some tranquillity, after the
many severe persecutions which it had hitherto undergone.
The Earl of Bristol, a minister of vigilance and penetration,
and who had formerly opposed all alliance with catholics<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 292.</NOTE>,
was now fully convinced of the sincerity of Spain; and he
was ready to congratulate the King on the intire completion
of all his views and projects<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 69.</NOTE>. A daughter of Spain, whom
he represents as extremely accomplished, would soon, he
said, arrive in England, and bring with her an immense
fortune of two millions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It ap∣pears by Buckingham's narrative, that these two millions were of pieces of eight, and made 600,000 pounds sterling: A very great sum, and almost equal to all the sums which the parliament, during the whole course of this reign, had hitherto bestowed on the King.</NOTE>, a sum four times greater than
Spain had ever before given with any princess. But what
was of more importance to the King's honour and happi∣ness,
Bristol considered this match as an infallible progno∣stic
of the Palatine's restoration; nor would Philip, he
thought, ever have bestowed his sister and so large a for∣tune,
under the prospect of entering next day into a war
with England. So exact was his intelligence, that the most
secret counsels of the Spaniards, he boasts, had never
escaped him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 272.</NOTE>; and he found that they had all along consi∣dered

the marriage of the Infanta and the restitution of the
Palatinate as measures closely connected, or altogether inse∣parable<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">We find by private letters between Philip IV. and the Condé Olivarez, shown by the latter to Buckingham, that the marriage and the restitution of the Palatinate were always considered by the court of Spain as inseparable. See Franklyn, p. 71, 72. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 71, 280, 299, 300. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 66.</NOTE>.
However little calculated James's character to
extort so vast a concession; however improper the meafures
which he had pursued for obtaining that end; the ambas∣sador
could not withstand the plain evidence of facts, by
which Philip now demonstrated his sincerity. Perhaps too,
like a wise man, he considered that reasons of state, which
are supposed solely to influence the councils of monarchs,
are not always the motives which there predominate; that
the milder views of gratitude, honour, friendship, genero∣sity,
are frequently able, among princes as well as private
persons, to counterbalance these selfish considerations; that
the justice and moderation of James had been so conspicuous
in all these transactions, his reliance on Spain, his confidence
in her friendship, that he had at last obtained the cordial
alliance of that nation, so celebrated for honour and fidelity.
Or if politics must still be supposed the ruling motive of all
public measures, the maritime power of England was so
great, the Spanish dominions so divided, as might well in∣duce
the council of Philip to think that a sincere friendship
with the masters of the sea could not be purchased by too
many concessions<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 72.</NOTE>. And as James, during so many years,
had been allured and seduced by hopes and protestations, his
people enraged by delays and disappointments; it would
probably occur, that there was now no medium left between
the most inveterate hatred and the most intimate alliance be∣twixt
the nations. Not to mention, that, as a new spirit
began about this time to animate the councils of France, the
friendship of England became every day more necessary to
the greatness and security of the Spanish monarchy.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="89"/>
ALL measures being, therefore, agreed between the par∣ties,
nought was wanting but the dispensation from Rome,
which might be considered as a mere formality<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 66.</NOTE>. The
King, justified by success, now exulted in his pacific coun∣sels,
and boasted of his superior sagacity and penetration;
when all these flattering prospects were blasted by the teme∣rity
of a man whom he had fondly exalted from a private
condition to be the bane of himself, of his family, and of
his people.</P>
<P>EVER since the fall of Somerset,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Bucking∣ham.</NOTE> Buckingham had go∣verned,
with an uncontroled sway, both the court and na∣tion;
and could James's eyes have been opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1623.</NOTE> he had
now full opportunity of observing how unfit his favourite
was for the high station to which he was raised. Some ac∣complishments
of a courtier he posseffed: Of every talent of
a minister he was utterly devoid. Headlong in his passions,
and incapable equally of prudence and of dissimulation:
Sincere from violence rather than candor; expensive from
profusion more than generosity: A warm friend, a furious
enemy; but without any choice or discernment in either:
With these qualities he had early and quickly mounted to
the highest rank; and partook at once of the insolence which
attends a fortune newly acquired, and the impetuosity which
belongs to persons born in high stations, and unacquainted
with opposition.</P>
<P>AMONG those who had experienced the arrogance of this
overgrown favourite, the Prince of Wales himself had not
been intirely spared; and a great coldness, if not an enmity,
had, for that reason, taken place between them. Bucking∣ham,
desirous of an opportunity which might connect him
with the Prince, and overcome his aversion, and at the same
time envious of the great credit acquired by Bristol in the
Spanish negotiation, bethought himself of an expedient, by
<PB N="72" REF="90"/>
which he might at once gratify both these inclinations. He
represented to Charles, That persons of his exalted station
were peculiarly unfortunate in their marriage, the chief cir∣cumstance
in life; and commonly received into their arms
a bride, unknown to them, to whom they were unknown;
not endeared by sympathy, not obliged by services; wooed
by treaties alone, by negotiations, by political interests: That
however accomplished the Infanta, she must still consider
herself as a melancholy victim of state, and could not but
think with aversion of that day when she was to enter the
bed of a stranger; and passing into a foreign country and
a new family, bid adieu for ever to her father's house and to
her native land: That it was in the Prince's power to
soften all these rigours, and lay such an obligation on her, as
would attach the most indifferent temper, as would warm
the coldest affections: That his journey to Madrid would
be an unexpected gallantry, which would equal all the
fictions of Spanish romance, and suiting the amorous and
enterprising character of that nation, must immediately in∣troduce
him to the Princess under the agreeable character of
a devoted lover and daring adventurer: That the negotia∣tions
with regard to the Palatinate, which had hitherto lan∣guished
in the hands of ministers, would quickly be termi∣nated
by so illustrious an agent, seconded by the mediation
and intreaties of the grateful Infanta: That the Spanish
generosity, moved by that unexampled trust and confidence,
would make concessions beyond what could be expected
from political views and considerations: And that he would
quickly return to the King with the glory of having re∣established
the unhappy Palatine, by the same enterprize
which procured him the affections and the person of the
Spanish Princess<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mind of the young prince, replete with candor,
was inflamed by these generous and romantic ideas. He
<PB N="73" REF="91"/>
agreed to make application to the King for his approbation.
They chose the moment of his kindest and most jovial hu∣mour;
and more by the earnestness which they expressed,
than by the force of their reasons, they obtained a hasty
and unguarded consent to their undertaking. And having
engaged his promise to keep their purpos secret, they left
him, in order to make preparations for their journey.</P>
<P>No sooner was the King alone, than his temper, more
cautious than sanguine, suggested very different views of
the matter, and represented every difficulty and danger
which could occur. He reflected, that, however the world
might pardon this sally of youth in the Prince, they would
never forgive himself, who at his years, and after his expe∣rience,
could entrust his only son, the heir of his crown,
the prop of his age, to the discretion of foreigners, with∣out
so much as providing the frail security of a safe conduct
in his favour: That, if the Spanish monarch was sincere in
his professions, a few months must finish the treaty of mar∣riage,
and bring the Infanta into England; if he was not
sincere, the folly was still more egregious of committing the
Prince into his hands: That Philip, when possessed of so
invaluable a pledge, might well rise in his demands, and im∣pose
harder conditions of treaty: And that the temerity of
this enterprize was so apparent, that the event, however
prosperous, could never justify it; and if disastrous, it would
render himself infamous to his people, and ridiculous to all
posterity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TORMENTED with these reflections, so soon as the
Prince and Buckingham returned for their dispatches, he in∣formed
them of all the reasons which had determined him
to change his resolution; and he begged them to desist
from so foolish an adventure. The Prince received the dis∣appointment
with sorrowful submission and silent tears:
Buckingham presumed to speak in an imperious tone, which
<PB N="74" REF="92"/>
he had ever experienced to be prevalent over his too easy master.
He told the King, that nobody for the future
would believe any thing he said, when he retracted so soon
the promise so solemnly given; that he plainly discerned
this change of resolution to proceed from another breach of
his word, in communicating the matter to some rascal, who
had furnished him with those pitiful reasons which he had
alleged, and he doubted not but he should hereafter know
who his counsellor had been; and that if he receded from
what he had promised, it would be such a disobligation to
the Prince, who had now set his heart upon the journey,
after his Majesty's approbation, that he could never forget
it, nor forgive any man who had been the cause of it<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King with great earnestness, fortified by many
oaths, made his apology, by denying that he had communi∣cated
the matter to any man; and finding himself assailed,
as well by the boisterous importunities of Buckingham, as
by the warm entreaties of his son, whose applications had
hitherto, on other occasions, been always dutiful, never
earnest; he had again the weakness to assent to their pur∣posed
journey. It was agreed that Sir Francis Cottington
alone, the Prince's secretary, and Endymion Porter, gentle∣man
of his bed-chamber, should accompany them; and the
former being at that time in the anti-chamber, he was im∣mediately
called in by the King's orders.</P>
<P>JAMES told Cottington, that he had always been an ho∣nest
man, and therefore he was now to trust him in an
affair of the highest importance, which he was not, upon
his life, to disclose to any man whatever. “Cottington,”
added he, “here is baby Charles and Stenny” (these ridi∣culous
appellations he usually gave to the Prince and Buck∣ingham)
“who have a great mind to go post into Spain,
and fetch home the Infanta: They will have but two
more in their company, and have chosen you for one
<PB N="75" REF="93"/>
What think you of the journey?” Sir Francis, who
was a prudent man, and had resided some years in Spain as
the King's agent, was struck with all the obvious objections
to such an enterprize, and scrupled not to declare them.
The King threw himself upon his bed, and cried, <HI>I told
you this before;</HI> and fell into new passion and lamentation,
complaining that he was undone, and should lose baby
Charles.</P>
<P>THE Prince showed by his countenance, that he was ex∣tremely
dissatisfied with Cottington's discourse; but Buck∣ingham
broke into an open passion against him. The King,
he told him, asked him only of the journey and of the
manner of travelling; particulars, of which he might be a
competent judge, having gone the road so often by post;
but that he, without being called to it, had the presump∣tion
to give his advice upon matters of state and against his
master, which he should repent so long as he lived. A thou∣sand
other reproaches he added, which put the poor King
into a new agony in behalf of a servant, who, he foresaw,
would suffer for answering him honestly. Upon which he
said with some commotion: <HI>Nay, by God, Stenny, you are
much to blame for using him so: He answered me directly
to the question which I asked him, and very honestly and
wisely; and yet, you know, he said no more than I told you
before he was called in.</HI> However, after all this passion on
both sides, James renewed his consent; and proper direc∣tions
were given for the journey. Nor was he now at any
loss to discover that the whole intrigue was originally con∣trived
by Buckingham, as well as pursued violently by his
spirit and impetuosity.</P>
<P>THESE circumstances, which so well characterize the
persons, seem to have been related by Cottington to Lord
Clarendon, from whom they are here transcribed; and tho'
minute, are not undeserving of a place in history.</P>
<P>THE Prince and Buckingham, with their two attendants,
and Sir Richard Graham, master of horse to Buckingham,
<PB N="76" REF="94"/>
passed disguised and undiscovered thro' France; and they
even ventured into a court-ball at Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th March.</NOTE> where Charles saw
the Princess Henrietta,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prince's journey to Spain.</NOTE> whom he afterwards espoused, and
who was at that time in the bloom of youth and beauty.
In eleven days after their departure from London, they ar∣rived
at Madrid; and surprized every-body by a step so little
usual among great princes. The Spanish monarch imme∣diately
paid Charles a visit, expressed the utmost gratitude
for the confidence reposed in him, and made warm protesta∣tions
of a correspondent confidence and friendship. By the
most studied civilities, he showed the respect which he bore
his royal guest. He gave him a golden key, which opened
all his apartments, that the Prince might, without any intro∣duction,
have access to him at all hours: He took the left
hand of him on every occasion, except in the apartments
assigned to Charles; for there, he said, the Prince was at
home: Charles was introduced into the palace with the same
pomp and ceremony which attend the kings of Spain on
their coronation: The council received public orders to
obey him as the King himself: Olivarez himself, though a
grandee of Spain, who are always covered before their own
king, would not put on his hat in the Prince's presence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 73.</NOTE>:
All the prisons of Spain were thrown open, and all the pri∣soners
received their freedom, as if the event, the most ho∣nourable
and most fortunate, had happened to the mon∣archy<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 74.</NOTE>. And every sumptuary law with regard to apparel
was suspended during his residence in Spain. The Infanta,
however, was only shown to her lover in public; the Spa∣nish
ideas of decency being so strict, as not to allow of any
more intercourse till the arrival of the dispensation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE point of honour was carried so far by that gene∣rous
people, that no attempt was made, on account of the
advantage which they had acquired, of imposing any harder
conditions of treaty: Their pious zeal only prompted them,
<PB N="77" REF="95"/>
on one occasion, to desire more concessions in the rellgious
articles; but, on the opposition of Bristol, accompanied
with some reproaches, they immediately desisted. The
Pope, however, hearing of the Prince's arrival in Madrid,
tacked some new clauses to the dispensation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 84.</NOTE>; and it be∣came
necessary to transmit the articles to London, that the
King might there ratify them. This treaty, which was
made public, consisted of several articles, chiefly regarding
the exercise of the catholic religion by the Infanta and her
family. Nothing could reasonably be found fault with,
except one article, in which the King promised, that the
children should be educated by the Princess, till ten years
of age. This condition could not be insisted on, but with
a view of seasoning their minds with catholic prejudices;
and tho' so tender an age seemed little susceptible of theo∣logical
tenets, yet the same reason, which made the Pope
insert that article, should have induced the King to re∣ject
it.</P>
<P>BESIDES the public treaty, there, were separate articles,
privately sworn to by the King; in which he promised
to suspend the penal laws enacted against catholics, to pro∣cure
a repeal of them in parliament, and to grant a toleration
for the exercise of the catholic religion in private houses<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 80. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 89. Kennet, p. 769.</NOTE>.
Great murmurs, we may believe, would have arisen against
these articles, had they been made known to the public;
since we find it to have been imputed as an enormous crime
to the Prince, that, having received, about this time, a very
civil letter from the Pope, he was induced to return a very
civil answer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 82. Franklyn, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while Gregory XV. who granted the dispen∣sation,
died; and Urban VIII. was chosen in his place.
Upon this event, the nuncio refused to deliver the dispen∣sation,
till it should be renewed by Urban; and that crafty
<PB N="78" REF="96"/>
pontiff delayed the sending a new dispensation, in hopes,
that, during the Prince's residence in Spain, some expedient
might be fallen upon to operate his conversion. The King
of England, as well as the Prince, became impatient,
On the first hint, Charles obtained permission to return;
and Philip graced his departure with all the circumstances of
elaborate civility and respect, which had attended his ar∣rival.
He even erected a pillar, on the spot where they
took leave of each other, as a monument of mutual friend∣ship:
and the Prince, having sworn to the observance of
all the articles, entered on his journey, and embarked on
board the English fleet at St. Andero.</P>
<P>THE character of Charles, composed of decency, re∣serve,
modesty, sobriety; virtues so agreeable to the man∣ners
of the Spaniards; the unparalleled confidence, which
he had reposed in their nation; the romantic gallantry,
which he had practifed towards their princess; all these cir∣cumstances,
joined to his youth and advantageous figure,
had endeared him to the whole court of Madrid, and had
impressed the most favourable ideas of him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 80. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 103.</NOTE>. But, in the
same proportion, that the Prince was beloved and esteemed,
was Buckingham despised and hated. His behaviour, com∣posed
of English familiarity and French vivacity; his sallies
of passion, his indecent freedoms with the Prince, his dis∣solute
pleasures, his arrogant, impetuous temper, which he
neither could, nor cared to disguise; qualities like these,
could, most of them, be esteemed no where, but to the
Spaniards were the objects of peculiar aversion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 101.</NOTE>. They
could not conceal their surprize, that such a youth could in∣trude
into a negotiation, now conducted to a period, by so
accomplished a minister as Bristol, and could assume to him∣self
all the merit of it. They lamented the Infanta's fate,
who must be approached by a man, whose temerity seemed
to respect no laws, divine or human<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 36.</NOTE>. And when they ob∣served,
<PB N="79" REF="97"/>
that he had the imprudence to insult the Condé Duke
of Olivarez, their prime minister; every one, who was am∣bitious
of paying court to the Spanish, became desirous of
showing a contempt for the English favourite.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Buckingham told Olivarez, that his own
attachment to the Spaish nation and to the King of Spain
was extreme; that he would contribute to every measure,
which could cement the friendship between England and
them; and that his peculiar ambition would be to facilitate
the Prince's marriage with the Infanta. But, he added, with
a sincerity equally insolent and indiscreet, <HI>With regard
to you, Sir, in particular, you must not consider me as your
friend, but must ever expect from me all possible enmity and
opposition.</HI> The Condé Duke replied, with a becoming
dignity, that he very willingly accepted of what was prof∣fered
him: And on these terms the favourites parted<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 103. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUCKINGHAM, sensible how odious he was become to
the Spaniards, and dreading the influence which that na∣tion
would naturally acquire after the arrival of the
Insanta, resolved to employ all his credit, in order to prevent the
marriage. By what arguments he could engage the Prince
to offer such an insult to the Spanish nation, from whom he
had met with such generous treatment; by what colours he
could disguise the ingratitude, and imprudence of such a
measure; these are totally unknown to us. It only appears,
that his impetuous and domineering character had acquired,
what it ever after maintained, a total ascendant over the
gentle and modest temper of Charles; and, when the
Prince left Madrid, he was firmly determined, notwith∣standing
all his professions, to break off the treaty with Spain.</P>
<P>IT is not likely, that Buckingham prevailed so easily
with James to abandon a project, which, during so many
<PB N="80" REF="98"/>
years, had been the object of all his wishes, and which he
had now unexpectedly conducted to a happy period<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Hacket's Life of Williams.</NOTE>. A
rupture with Spain, the loss of two millions, were pro∣spects
little agreeable to this pacific and indigent monarch:
But finding his only son bent against a match, which had al∣ways
been opposed by his people and his parliament, he
yielded to difficulties, which he had not courage nor strength
of mind sufficient to resist. The Prince, therefore, and
Buckingham, on their arrival at London, assumed in∣tirely
the direction of the negotiation; and it was their bu∣siness
to seek for pretences by which they could give a co∣lour
to their intended violation of treaty.</P>
<P>THO' the restitution of the Palatinate had ever been con∣sidered
by James as a natural or necessary consequence of the
Spanish alliance, he had always forbid his ministers to insist
on it as a preliminary article to the conclusion of the mar∣riage-treaty.
He considered, that that principality was now
intirely in the hands of the emperor and the Duke of Bavaria;
and that it was no longer in the King of Spain's power, by
a single stroke of his pen, to restore it to the antient proprie∣tor.
The strict alliance of Spain with these princes would
engage Philip, he thought, to soften so disagreeable a de∣mand
by every art of negotiation; and many articles must
of necessity be adjusted, before such an important point
could be effectuated. It was sufficient, in James's opinion,
if the sincerity of the Spanish court could, for the present,
be ascertained; and, dreading farther delays of the marriage,
so long wished for, he was resolved to trust the Palatine's
full restoration to the event of future counsels and delibera∣tions
<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Parl, Hist. vol. vi. p. 57.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS whole system of politics, Buckingham now re∣versed;
and he overturned every supposition upon which the
treaty had hitherto been conducted. After many fruitless
<PB N="81" REF="99"/>
artifices were employed to delay or prevent the espousals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage treaty broken.</NOTE> Bri∣stol
received positive orders not to deliver the proxy, which
had been left in his hands, nor to finish the marriage, till
security was given for the full restitution of the Palatinate<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 105, Kennet, p. 776.</NOTE>. Philip understood this language. He had been acquainted
with the disgust received by Buckingham; and deeming
him a man capable of sacrificing, to his own ungoverna∣ble
passions, the greatest interests of his master and of his
country, he had expected that the unbounded credit of that
favourite would be employed to embroil the two nations.
Determined, however, to throw the blame of the rupture
intirely on the English, he delivered into Bristol's hand a
written promise, by which he bound himself to procure the
restoration of the Palatine, either by persuasion, or by every
other possible means; and, when he found that that concession
gave no satisfaction, he ordered the Infanta to lay aside the
title of Princess of Wales, which she bore after the arrival
of the dispensation from Rome, and to drop the study of the
English language<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 80. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 112.</NOTE>. And thinking that such rash councils
as now governed the court of England would not stop at the
breach of the marriage treaty, he ordered preparations for
war immediately to be made throughout all his dominions<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 114.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS James, having, by means inexplicable from all
the rules of politics, conducted, so near an honourable end,
the marriage of his son and the restoration of his son-in∣law,
sailed at last of his purpose, by means equally unac∣countable.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' the expedients already used by Buckingham
were suffciently inglorious, both for himself and for the na∣tion;
it was necessary for him, ere he could fully effect his
purpose, to employ artifices still more shameful and dis∣honourable.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="100"/>
THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1624.</NOTE> having broke with Spain, was obliged to
concert new measures;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia∣ment.</NOTE> and, without the assistance of par∣liament,
no effectual step of any kind could be taken.
The benevolence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Feb.</NOTE> which, during the interval, had been
rigorously exacted for the recovery of the Palatinate, tho'
levied for so popular an end, had procured the King less
money than ill-will from his subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To show by what violent measures this benevolence was raised, John∣stone tells us, in his <HI>Rerum Britannicarum historia,</HI> that Barnes, a citizen of London, was the first who refused to contribute any thing; upon which, the treasurer sent him word, that he must immediately prepare himself to carry by post a dispatch into Ireland. The citizen was glad to make his peace by paying a hundred pounds; and no one durst afterwards refuse the benevolence required. See farther, Coke, p. 80.</NOTE>. Whatever dis∣couragements,
therefore, he might receive from his ill agree∣ment
with former parliaments, there was a necessity of sum∣moning
once more this assembly; and, it might be hoped,
that the Spanish alliance, which gave such umbrage, being
abandoned, the commons would now be better satisfied with
the King's administration. In his speech to the houses,
James dropped some hints of the causes of complaint which
he had against Spain; and he graciously condescended to ask
the parliament's advice, which he had ever before rejected,
with regard to the conduct of so important an affair as his
son's marriage<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 79. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 115· Kennet, p. 778.</NOTE>. Buckingham delivered, to a committee of
lords and commons, a long narrative, which he pretended
to be true and compleat, of every step taken in the negotia∣tions
with Philip: But partly by the suppression of some
facts, partly by the false colouring laid on others, this nar∣rative
was calculated intirely to mislead the parliament, and
to throw on the court of Spain the reproach of artifice
and insincerity. He said, that, after many years negotia∣tion,
the King found not himself any nearer his purpose;
and that Bristol had never brought the treaty beyond ge∣neral
professions and declarations: That the Prince, doubt∣ing
the good intentions of Spain, resolved at last to take a
<PB N="83" REF="101"/>
journey to Madrid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1624.</NOTE> and put the matter to the utmost trial:
That he there found such artificial dealing as made him con∣clude
all the steps taken towards the marriage to be false and
deceitful: That the restitution of the Palatinate, which had
ever been regarded by the King as an essential preliminary,
was not seriously intended by Spain: And that, after endur∣ing
much ill-usage, the Prince was obliged to return to Eng∣land,
without any hopes, either of obtaining the Infanta,
or of restoring the Elector Palatine<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 89, 90, 91, &amp;c. Rus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>worth, vol. i. p. 119, 120, &amp;c. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 20, 21, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS narrative, which, considering the importance of the
occasion, and the solemnity of that assembly to which it
was delivered, deserves great blame, was yet vouched for
truth by the Prince of Wales, who was present; and
the King himself lent it, indirectly, his authority, by telling
the parliament, that it was by his order Buckingham laid
the whole affair before them. The conduct of these princes
it is difficult fully to excuse. 'Tis in vain to plead the
youth and inexperience of Charles; unless his inexperience
and youth, 'as is probable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The moment the prince em∣barked at St. Andero's, he said, to those about him, that it was folly in the Spaniards to use him so ill, and allow him to depart: A proof that the Duke had made him believe they were insincere in the affair of the marriage and the Palatinate: For, as to his reception, in other respects, it had been alto∣gether unexceptionable: Besides, had not the Prince believed the Spaniards to be insincere, he had no reason to quarrel with them, tho' Buckingham had. It appears, therefore, that Charles himself must have been deceived. The multiplied delays of the dispensation, tho' they arose from accident, af∣forded Buckingham a plausible <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>retext for charging the Spaniards with insin∣cerity.</NOTE>, if not certain, really led him
into error, and made him swallow all the falsities of Buck∣ingham.
And, tho' the King was here hurried from his
own measures by the impetuosity of others; nothing should
have induced him to prostitute his character, and vouch the
impostures, at least false colourings, of his favourite, of
which he had so good reason to entertain a suspicion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">It must, however, be confessed, that the King afterwards warned the house not to take Buckingham's narrative for his, tho' it was laid before them by his order. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 104. The King was pro∣bably ashamed to have been carried so far by his favourite.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="102"/>
BUCKINGHAM's narrative, however artfully disguised,
contained yet so many contradictory circumstances as were
sufficient to open the eyes of all reasonable men; but it con∣curred
so well with the passions and prejudices of the par∣liament,
that no scruple was made of immediately adopting it<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 75.</NOTE>.
Charmed with having obtained at last the opportunity,
so long wished for, of going to war with papists, they little
thought of future consequences; but immediately advised
the King to break off both treaties with Spain, as well that
which regarded the marriage, as that for the restitution
of the Palatinate<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 98. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 128. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 103.</NOTE>. The people, ever greedy of war, till they
suffer by it, displayed their triumph at these violent measures
by public bonfires and rejoicings, and by insults on the
Spanish ministers. Buckingham was now the favourite of
the publick and of the parliament. Sir Edward Coke, in
the house of commons, called him the Saviour of the na∣tion<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 6.</NOTE>.
Every place resounded with his praises. And he
himself, intoxicated by a popularity, which he enjoyed so
little time, and which he so little deserved, violated all duty
to his indulgent master, and entered into cabals with the pu∣ritan
members, who had ever opposed the royal authority.
He even encouraged schemes for abolishing the order of
bishops, and selling the dean and chapter lands, in order to
defray the expences of a Spanish war. And the King, tho'
he still entertained projects for temporizing, and for form∣ing
an accommodation with Spain, was so borne down by
the torrent of popular prejudices, conducted and increased
by Buckingham, that he was at last obliged, in a speech to
parliament, to declare in favour of hostile measures, if they
would engage to support him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 94, 95. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 129, 130.</NOTE>. Doubts of their sincerity
<PB N="85" REF="103"/>
in this respect; doubts which the event showed not to be
ill grounded; had probably been one cause of his former
pacific and dilatory measures.</P>
<P>IN his speech on this occasion, the King began with la∣menting
his misfortune, that, having so long valued himself
on the epithet of the pacific monarch, he should now, in
his old age, be obliged to exchange the blessings of peace
for the inevitable calamities of war. He represented to them
the immense and continued expence, requisite for military
armaments; and besides supplies, from time to time, as
they should become necessary, he demanded a vote of six
subsidies and twelve fifteenths, as a proper stock before the
commencement of hostilities. He told them of his into∣lerable
debts and burthens, chiefly contracted by the sums
remitted to the Palatine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other particulars, he mentions a sum of 80,000 pounds bor∣rowed from the king of Denmark. In a former speech to the Parliament, he told them, that he had expended 500,000 pounds in the cause of the Palatine, besides the voluntary contribution given him by the people. See Franklyn, p. 50. But what is more extraordinary, the treasurer, in order to show his own good services, boasts to the parliament, that, by his contrivance, 60,000 pounds had been saved on the head of exchange in the sums remitted to the Palatinate. This seems very great, nor is it conceivable wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce the King could procure such vast sums as would require a sum so great to be paid in exchange. From the whole, however, it appears, that the King had been far from neglecting the interests of his daughter and son-in-law, and had even gone much beyond what his narrow revenue could afford.</NOTE>; but he added, that he did not
insist on any supply for his own relief, and that it was suf∣ficient
for him, if the honour and security of the public
were provided for. To remove all suspicion, he, who had
ever strenuously maintained his prerogative, and even ex∣tended
it into some points esteemed doubtful, now made a
most imprudent concession, of which the consequences might
have proved fatal to royal authority: He voluntarily offered,
that the money voted should be paid in to a committee of par∣liament,
and should be issued by them, without being in∣trusted
to his management<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 137.</NOTE>. The commons willingly ac∣cepted
<PB N="86" REF="104"/>
of this concession, so unprecedented in an English
monarch; they voted him only three subsidies and three fif∣tenths
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Less than 300,000 pounds.</NOTE>; and they took no notice of the complaints which
he made of his own wants and necessities.</P>
<P>ADVANTAGE was also taken of the present good agree∣ment
between the King and parliament, in order to pass
the bill against monopolies, which had formerly been encouraged
by the King, but which had failed by the rupture between
him and the last house of commons. This bill was con∣ceived
in such terms as to render it merely declarative; and
all monopolies were condemned, as contrary to law and to
the known liberties of the people. It was there supposed,
that every subject of England had intire power to dispose
of his own actions, provided he did no injury to any of his fellow
subjects; and that no prerogative of the King, no power of
any magistrate, nothing but the authority alone of laws,
could restrain that unlimited freedom. The full prosecution
of this noble principle into all its necessary consequences,
has, at last, thro' many contests, produced that singular and
happy government, which at present we enjoy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>How little this principle had pre∣vailed, during any former period of the English government, particularly during the last reign, which was certainly not so perfect a model of liberty as some writers would represent it, will easily appear from many passages in the history of that reign. But the ideas of men were much changed, du∣ring about twenty years of a gentle and peaceful administration. The com∣mons, tho' James, of himself, had recalled all patents of monopolies, were not contented without a law against them, and a declarative law too; which was gaining a great point, and establishing principles very favourable to liber∣ty: But they were extremely grateful, when Elizabeth, upon petition (after having once refused their requests) recalled a few of the most oppressive pa∣tents; and employed some soothing expressions towards them.</P>
<P>THE parliament had surely reason, when they confessed, in the seventh of James, that he allowed them more freedom of debate, than ever was indulged by any of his predecessors. His indulgence in this particular, joined to his easy temper, was probably one cause of the great power assumed by the commons. Monsieur de la Boderie, in his dispatches, Vol. i. p. 449, mentions the liberty of speech in the house of commons as a new prac∣tice.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="105"/>
THE house of commons also corroborated, by a new
precedent, the important power of impeachment, which,
two years before, they had exercised, in the case of Chan∣cellor
Bacon, and which had lain dormant for more than a
century before, except when they served as instruments of
royal vengeance. The Earl of Middlesex had been raised
by Buckingham's interest from the rank of a London mer∣chant,
to be Lord high treasurer of England; and, by his
activity and address, seemed not unworthy of that prefer∣ment.
But, having incurred the displeasure of his patron,
by scrupling or refusing some demands of money, during
the Prince's residence in Spain, that favourite vowed revenge,
and employed all his credit among the commons to procure
an impeachment of the treasurer. The King was extremely
dissatisfied with this measure, and prophesied to the Prince
and Duke, that they would live to have their fill of parlia∣mentary
prosecutions<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 23.</NOTE>. In a speech to the parliament, he
endeavoured to apologize for Middlesex, and to soften the
accusation against him<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 191.</NOTE>. The charge, however, was still
maintained by the commons; and the treasurer was found
guilty by the peers, tho' the misdemeanors proved against
him, were neither numerous nor important. The accept∣ing
two presents, of five hundred pounds apiece, for the
passing two patents, was the article of greatest weight. His
sentence was, to be fined 50,000 pounds for the King's
use, and to suffer all the other penalties formerly inflicted
upon Bacon. The fine was afterwards remitted by the
Prince, when he mounted the throne.</P>
<P>THIS session, an address was also made, very disagree∣able
to the King, craving the severe execution of the laws
against catholics. His answer was gracious and conde∣scending<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 101, 102.</NOTE>:
tho' he declared against persecution; as being
an improper measure for the suppression of any religion:
<PB N="88" REF="106"/>
according to the received maxim, <HI>That the blood of the
martyrs was the seed of the church.</HI> He also condemned
an intire indulgence of the catholics; and seemed to repre∣sent
a middle course, as the most humane and most politic.
He went so far as even to affirm, with an oath, that he ne∣ver
had entertained any thought of granting a toleration to
these religionists<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">See farther, Franklyn, p. 87.</NOTE>. The liberty of exercising their religion
in private houses, which he had secretly agreed to in the
Spanish treaty, he did not esteem deserving that name; and
it was probably by means of this evasion, he thought that
he had saved his honour. And as Buckingham, in his
Narrative<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 37.</NOTE>, confessed, that the King had agreed to a tem∣porary
suspension of the penal laws against the catholics,
which he distinguished from a toleration, a term at that
time extremely odious, James deemed his meaning to be
sufficiently explained, and fear'd not any reproach of fals∣hood
or duplicity,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9th May.</NOTE> on account of this asseveration. After
all these transactions, the parliament was prorogued by the
King, who let fall some hints, tho' in gentle terms, of the
sense which he entertained of their unkindness, in not
supplying his necessities<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>JAMES, unable to resist so strong a combination as that
of his people, his parliament, his son, and his favourite,
had been compelled to embrace measures, for which, from
temper as well as judgment, he had ever entertained a most
settled aversion. Tho' he dissembled his resentment, he be∣gan
to estrange himself from Buckingham, to whom he as∣cribed
all those violent counsels, and whom he considered as
the author, both of the Prince's journey into Spain, and of
the breach of the marriage treaty. The arrival of Bristol
he impatiently longed for; and it was by the assistance of that
minister, whose wisdom he respected, and whose views he ap∣proved,
that he hoped in time to extricate himself from his
present difficulties.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="107"/>
DURING the Prince's abode in Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Return of Bristol.</NOTE> that able nego∣tiator
had ever opposed, tho' unsuccessfully, to the impe∣tuous
measures suggested by Buckingham, his own wise and
well tempered counsels. After Charles's departure, upon
the first appearance of a change of resolution, he still in∣terposed
his advice, and strenuously insisted on the sincerity
of the Spaniards in the conduct of the treaty, as well
as the advantages which England must reap from the com∣pletion
of it. Enraged to find that his successful and skil∣ful
labours should be rendered abortive by the levities and
caprices of an insolent minion, he would understand no
hints; and nothing but express orders from his master could
engage him to make that demand, which he was sensible
would put a final period to the treaty. He was not there∣fore
surprised to hear that Buckingham had declared him∣self
his open enemy, and, both before the council and par∣liament,
had thrown out many scandalous reflections against
him. Upon the first order, he prepared for leaving Madrid;
and he was conducted to the King of Spain and the Condé
Duke, in order to fulfil the ceremonial of his departure.</P>
<P>PHILIP, by the mouth of his minister, expressed much
regret, that Bristol's services should meet with so unworthy
a reward, and that his enemies should so far have prevailed
as to infuse prejudices into his master and his country against
a minister, who had so faithfully done his duty to both. He
entreated him to fix his abode in Spain, rather than expose
himself to the inveterate malice of his rival and the ungovern∣able
fury of the people. He offered him every advantage of rank and
fortune, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>often the rigors of banishment; and, lest his honour should suffer by the desertion of his native
country, the monarch promised to confer all these advan∣tages,
with a public declaration, that they were bestowed
merely for his fidelity to the trust committed to him. And
he added, that he esteemed such a conduct of importance to
his own service; that all his ministers, observing his regard
<PB N="90" REF="108"/>
to virtue even in a stranger, might be the more animated to
exert their fidelity towards so generous a master.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Bristol, while he expressed the utmost gra∣titude
for this princely offer, thought himself obliged to de∣cline
the acceptance of it. He said, that nothing would
more confirm all the calumnies of his enemies than his re∣maining
at Madrid, and his receiving honour and prefer∣ment
from his catholic Majesty; that the highest dignity of
the Spanish monarchy, however valued, would be but an
unequal compensation for the loss of his honour, which he
must sacrifice to the obtaining it; that he trusted to his own
innocence for protection against all the fury of popular pre∣judice;
and that his master was so just and gracious, that,
however he might for a time be seduced by calumny, he
would surely afford him an opportunity of defending him∣self,
and would in the end restore him to his favour and good
opinion.</P>
<P>So magnanimous an answer increased the esteem which
Philip had conceived of the ambassador. That prince beg∣ged
him, at least, to accept of a present of 10,000 ducats,
which might be requisite for his support, till he could dissi∣pate
the prejudices contracted against him; and he pro∣mised,
that this compliance should for ever remain a secret
to all the world, and should never come to the knowlege of
his master. <HI>There is one person,</HI> replied the generous Eng∣glishman,
<HI>who must necessarily know it: He is the Earl
of Bristol, who will certainly reveal it to the King of Eng∣land</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 86. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTHING could be of greater consequence to Bucking∣ham,
than to keep Bristol at a distance both from the King
and the parliament; lest the power of truth, enforced by
so powerful a speaker, should open scenes, which were but
suspected by the former, and of which the latter had as yet
entertained no manner of jealousy. He applied therefore
<PB N="91" REF="109"/>
to James, whose weakness, disguised to himself under the
appearance of finesse and dissimulation, was now become
absolutely incurable. A warrant for sending Bristol to the
Tower was issued immediately upon his arrival in Eng∣land<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 145.</NOTE>; and though he was soon released from that confine∣ment,
yet orders were carried him from the King, to retire
to his country seat, and to abstain from all attendance on
parliament. He obeyed; but loudly demanded an oppor∣portunity
of justifying himself, and of laying his whole
conduct before his master. On all occasions, he protested
his innocence, and threw on his enemy the blame of every
miscarriage. Buckingham, and, at his instigation, the
Prince, declared, that they would be reconciled to Bristol,
if he would but acknowlege his errors and ill conduct: But
the spirited nobleman, jealous of his honour, refused to buy
favour at so high a price. James had the equity to say,
that the insisting on that condition was a strain of unex∣ampled
tyranny: But Buckingham scrupled not to assert,
with the utmost presumption, that neither the King, the
Prince, nor himself, were as yet satisfied of Bristol's in∣nocence<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 259.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the attachment of the Prince to Buckingham,
while the timidity of James, or the shame of changing his
favourite, kept the whole court in awe; the Spanish am∣bassador,
Inoiosa, endeavoured to open the King's eyes,
and to cure his fears by instilling greater fears into him.
He privately slipt into his hand a paper, and gave him a
signal to read it alone. He there told him, that he was as
much a prisoner at London as ever Francis I. was at Ma∣drid;
that the Prince and Buckingham had conspired toge∣ther,
and had the whole court at their devotion; that ca∣bals
among the popular leaders in parliament were carrying
on to the extreme prejudice of his authority; that the pro∣ject
was to confine him to some of his hunting seats, and to

commit the whole administration of affairs to the manage∣ment

vigorous effort, to vindicate his liberty, and to punish those
who had so long and so much abused his goodness and fa∣cility<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 144. Hacket's Life of Williams, Coke, p. 107.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT credit James gave to this representation does
not appear. He only discovered some faint symptoms, which
he instantly retracted, of dissatisfaction with Buckingham.
All his public measures, and all the alliances into which he
entered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with Spain.</NOTE> were founded on the system of enmity to the Au∣strian
family, and of war to be carried on for the recovery
of the Palatinate.</P>
<P>THE states of the United Provinces, at this time, were
governed by Maurice; and that aspiring prince, sensible
that his credit would languish during peace, had, on the
expiration of the twelve years truce, renewed the war with
the Spanish monarchy. His great capacity in the military
art would have compensated for the inferiority of his forces,
had not the Spanish armies been commanded by Spinola, a
general equally renowned for conduct, and more celebrated
for enterprize and activity. In such a situation, nothing
could be more welcome to the republic than the prospect
of a rupture between James and the catholic King; and
they flattered themselves, as well from the natural union
of interests between them and England, as from the in∣fluence
of the present conjuncture, that powerful suc∣cours
would soon march to their relief. Accordingly, an
army of six thousand men was levied in England, and sent
over into Holland, commanded by four young noblemen,
Essex, Oxford, Southampton, and Willoughby, who were
ambitious of distinguishing themselves in so popular a
cause, and of acquiring military experience under so re∣nowned
a captain as Maurice.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="113"/>
IT might reasonably have been expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with France.</NOTE> that, as reli∣gious
zeal had made the recovery of the Palatinate appear
a point of such vast importance in England; the same effect
must have been produced in France, by the force merely
of political views and considerations. While that princi∣pality
remained in the hands of the house of Austria, the
French dominions were surrounded on all sides by the pos∣sessions
of that ambitious family, and might be invaded by
superior forces from every quarter. It concerned the King
of France therefore to prevent the peaceable establishment
of the Emperor in his new conquests; and both by the
situation and greater power of his state, he was better en∣abled
than James to give succour to the distressed Palatine.
But tho' these views escaped not Louis, nor Cardinal Rich∣lieu,
who now began to acquire an ascendant in the French
court; that minister was determined to pave the way for
his enterprizes by first subduing the Hugonots, and thence
to proceed, by mature counsels, to humble the house of
Austria. The prospect, however, of a conjunction with
England was presently embraced, and all imaginable encou∣ragement
was given to every proposal for conciliating a
marriage between Charles and the Princess Henrietta.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the sensible experience which
James might have acquired of the unsurmountable anti∣pathy
entertained by his subjects against all alliance with ca∣tholics,
he still persevered in the opinion that his son would
be degraded by receiving into his bed a princess of less than
royal extraction. After the rupture, therefore, with Spain,
nothing remained but an alliance with France; and to that
court he immediately applied himself<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 152.</NOTE>. The same allure∣ments
had not here place, which had so long entangled him
in the Spanish negotiation: The portion promised was much
inferior; and the peaceable restoration of the Palatine could
not thence be expected. But James was afraid lest his son

should be altogether disappointed of a bride; and therefore,
as soon as the christian king demanded, for the honour of
his crown, the same terms which had been granted to the
catholic, he was prevailed with to comply. And as the
Prince, during his abode in Spain, had given a verbal pro∣mise
to allow the Infanta the education of her children till
the age of thirteen, this article was here inserted in the
treaty; and to that imprudence is generally imputed the pre∣sent
distressed condition of his posterity. The court of
England, however, it must be confessed, always pretended,
even in their memorials to the French court, that all the fa∣vourable
conditions, granted to the catholics, were inserted
in the marriage treaty merely to please the Pope, and that
their strict execution, by an agreement with France, was se∣cretly
dispensed with<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xviii. p. 224. 'Tis certain that the young Prince of Wales, afterwards Charles II. had protestant governors from his early in∣fancy; first the Earl of Newcastle, then the Marquis of Hertford. The King, in his memorial to foreign churches after the commencement of the civil wars, insists on his care in educating his children in the protestant reli∣gion, as a proof that he was no-wise inclined to the catholic. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 752. It can scarce, therefore, be questioned, but this article, which has so odd an appearance, was inserted only to amuse the Pope, and was never intended by either party to be executed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As much as the conclusion of the marriage treaty was
acceptable to the King, as much were all the military enter∣prizes
disagreeable, both from the extreme difficulty of the
undertaking in which he was engaged, and from his own
incapacity for such a scene of action.</P>
<P>DURING the Spanish negotiation, Heidelberg and Man∣heim
had been taken by the imperial forces; and Franken∣dale,
tho' the garrison was entirely English, was closely be∣sieged
by them. Upon re-iterated remonstrances from
James, Spain interposed, and procured a suspension of arms
during eighteen months. But as Frankendale was the only
place of Frederic's antient dominions, which continued in his
hands, Ferdinand, being desirous of withdrawing his
<PB N="95" REF="117"/>
forces from the Palatinate, and of leaving that state in se∣curity,
was unwilling that so important a fortress should
remain in the possession of the enemy. To compromise all
differences, it was agreed to sequestrate it in the Infanta's
hands as a neutral person; upon condition that, upon the
expiration of the truce, it should be delivered to Frederic;
tho' peace should not, at that time, be concluded between
him and Ferdinand<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 74.</NOTE>. After the unexpected rupture with
Spain, the Infanta, when James demanded the execution
of the treaty, offered him peaceable possession of Franken∣dale,
and even promised a safe conduct for the garrison
thro' the Spanish Netherlands: But there was some terri∣tory
of the empire interposed between her state and the
Palatinate; and for passage over that territory, no terms
were stipulated<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>51.</NOTE>. By this chicane, which certainly had
not been employed if amity with Spain had been preserved,
the Palatine was totally dispossessed of all his patrimonial
dominions.</P>
<P>THE English nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mansfeldt's expedition.</NOTE> however, and James's warlike coun∣cil,
were not discouraged. It was still determined to re∣conquer
the Palatinate; a state lying in the midst of Ger∣many,
possessed intirely by the Emperor and Bavaria, sur∣rounded
by potent enemies, and cut off from all communi∣cation
with England. Count Mansfeldt was taken into pay;
and an English army of 12,000 foot and 200 horse was
levied by a general press throughout the kingdom. During
the negotiation with France, vast promises had been made,
tho' in general terms, by the French ministry; not only
that a free passage should be granted to the English troops,
but also that powerful succours should join them in their
march towards the Palatinate. In England, all these pro∣fessions
were hastily interpreted to be positive engagements.
The troops under Mansfeldt's command were embarked at
Dover; but, upon sailing over to Calais,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE> found no orders
<PB N="96" REF="118"/>
yet arrived for their admission.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1625.</NOTE> After waiting in vain for
some time, they were obliged to sail towards Zealand;
where no proper measures were yet concerted for their dis∣embarkation;
and some scruples arose among the states on
account of the scarcity of provisions. Mean while, a pes∣tilential
distemper crept in among the English forces, so
long cooped up in narrow vessels. Half the army died
while on board; and the other half, weakened by sickness,
appeared too small a body to march into the Palatinate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 104. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 154. Dugdale, p. 24.</NOTE>.
And thus ended this ill-concerted and fruitless expedition;
the only disaster which happened to England during the
prosperous and pacific reign of James.</P>
<P>THAT reign was now drawing towards a conclusion.
With peace, so successfully cultivated, and so passionately
loved by this monarch, his life also terminated. This
spring, he was seized with a tertian ague; and, when en∣couraged
by his courtiers with the common proverb, that
this distemper, during that season, was health for a king,
he replied, that the proverb was meant of a young king.
After some fits, he found himself extremely weakened, and
sent for the Prince, whom he exhorted to bear a tender
affection for his wife, but to preserve a constancy in reli∣gion;
to protect the church of England; and to extend
his care towards the unhappy family of the Palatine<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 155.</NOTE>.
With decency and courage, he prepared himself for his
end;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the King.</NOTE> and he expired on the 27th of March, after a reign
over England of twenty-two years and a few days; and in
the fifty-ninth year of his age. His reign over Scotland was
almost of equal duration with his life.</P>
<P>No prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His cha∣racter.</NOTE> so little enterprising and so inoffensive, was
ever so much exposed to the opposite extremes of calumny
and flattery, of satire and panegyric. And the factions,
which began in his time, being still continued, have made
<PB N="97" REF="119"/>
his character be as much disputed to this day, as is com∣monly
that of princes who are our contemporaries. Many
virtues, however, it must be owned, he was possessed of;
but no one of them pure, or free from the contagion of the
neighbouring vices. His generosity bordered on profusion,
his learning on pedantry, his pacific disposition on pusillani∣mity,
his wisdom on cunning, his friendship on light fancy
and boyish fondness. While he imagined that he was only
maintaining his own authority, he may perhaps be suspected,
in some of his actions, and still more of his pretensions,
to have encroached on the liberties of his people: While
he endeavoured, by an exact neutrality, to acquire the
good will of all his neighbours, he was able to preserve
fully the esteem and regard of none. His capacity was con∣siderable;
but fitter to discourse on general maxims than
to conduct any intricate business: His intentions were just;
but more adapted to the conduct of private life, than to the
government of kingdoms. Aukward in his person, and
ungainly in his manners, he was ill qualified to command
respect; partial and undiscerning in his affections, he was
little fitted to acquire general love. Of a feeble temper
more than of a frail judgment: Exposed to our ridicule
from his vanity; but exempt from our hatred by his free∣dom
from pride and arrogance. And upon the whole, it
may be pronounced of his character, that all his qualities
were fullied with weakness, and embellished by humanity.
Political courage he certainly was devoid of; and from
thence chiefly is derived the strong prejudice which pre∣vails
against his personal bravery: An inference, however,
which must be owned, from general experience, to be ex∣tremely
fallacious.</P>
<P>HE was only once married, to Anne of Denmark, who
died on the 3d of March 1619, in the forty-fifth year of
her age; a woman eminent neither for her vices nor her
virtues. She loved expensive amusements and shows; but
possessed no taste in her pleasures. A great comet appeared
about the time of her death; and the vulgar esteemed it

the forerunner of that event. So considerable in their eyes
are even the most insignificant princes.</P>
<P>HE left only one son, Charles, then in the twenty-fifth
year of his age; and one daughter, Elizabeth, married to
the Elector Palatine. She was aged twenty-nine years.
Those alone remained of six legitimate children born to him.
He never had any illegitimate; and he never discovered any
tendency, even the smallest, towards a passion for any mistress.</P>
<P>THE archbishops of Canterbury during this reign were,
Whytgift, who died in 1604; Bancroft, in 1610; Abbot,
who survived the King. The chancellors, Lord Ellesmore,
who resigned in 1617; Bacon was first Lord keeper till
1619, then was created chancellor, and was displaced in
1621; Williams, bishop of Lincoln, was created lord
keeper in his place. The high treasurers were the Earl of
Dorset, who died in 1609; the Earl of Salisbury, in 1612;
the Earl of Suffolk fined and displaced for bribery in 1618;
Lord Mandeville, resigned in 1621; Earl of Middlesex, dis∣placed
in 1624; the Earl of Marlborough succeeded. The
lord admirals were, the Earl of Nottingham, who resigned
in 1618; the Earl, afterwards Duke of Buckingham. The
secretaries of state were the Earl of Salisbury, Sir Ralph
Winwood, Nanton, Calvert, Lord Conway, Sir Albertus
Moreton.</P>
<P>THE numbers of the house of lords, in the first parlia∣ment
of this reign, beside the bishops, were seventy-eight
temporal peers. The numbers in the first parliament of
Charles were ninety-seven. Consequently James, during
that period, created nineteen new peerages above those that
expired.</P>
<P>THE house of commons, in the first parliament of this
reign, consisted of four hundred and sixty-seven members.
It appears, that four boroughs revived their charters, which
they had formerly neglected. And as the first parliament of
Charles consisted of four hundred and ninety four members,
we may infer that James erected ten new boroughs.</P>

<P>IT may not be improper, at this period, to make a
pause; and take a survey of the state of the kingdom,
with regard to government, manners, finances, arms, trade,
learning. Where a just notion is not formed of these parti∣culars,
history can be very little instructive, and often will
not be intelligible.</P>
<P>WE may safely pronounce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil go∣vernment of England,</NOTE> that the English government,
at the accession of the Scottish line, was much more arbi∣trary,
than it is at present, the prerogative less limited,
the liberties of the subject less accurately defined and secured.
Without mentioning other particulars, the courts alone of
high commission and star-chamber
were sufficient to lay
the whole kingdom at the mercy of the prince.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="124"/>
THE court of high commission had been erected by Eliza∣beth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Appendix.</NOTE>
in, consequence of an act of parliament, passed at the
beginning, of her reign: By this act, it was thought proper,
during the great revolution of religion, to arm the sovereign
with full powers, in order to discourage and suppress oppo∣sition.
All appeals from the inferior ecclesiastical courts
were carried before the high commission; and, of conse∣quence,
the whole life and doctrine of the clergy lay di∣rectly
under its inspection. Every breach of the act of uni∣formity,
every refusal of the ceremonies, was cognizable in
this court; and during the reign of Elizabeth, had been
punished by deprivation, by fines, confiscations, and impri∣sonment.
James contented himself with the gentler penalty
of deprivation; nor was that punishment inflicted with ri∣gour
on every offender<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Archbishop Spotswood tells us, that he was informed by Bancroft, several years after the King's accession, that not above 45 clergymen had been deprived.</NOTE>. All the catholics too were liable
to be punished by this court, if they exercised any act of
their religion, or were any way active in sending abroad
their children or other relations, to receive that education,
which they could not procure them in their own country.
Popish priests were thrown into prison, and might be deli∣vered
over to the law, which punished them with death;
though that severity had been sparingly exercised by Eliza∣beth,
and never almost by James. In short, that liberty of
conscience, which we so highly and so justly value at present,
was totally suppressed; and no exercise of any religion, but
the established, was permitted throughout the kingdom.
Any word or writing, which tended towards heresy or schism or
sedition, was punishable by the high commissioners
or any three of them: They alone were judges what ex∣pressions
had that tendency: They proceeded not by infor∣mation,
but upon rumour, suspicion, or according to their
own fancy: They administered an oath, by which the party
<PB N="101" REF="125"/>
cited before them, was bound to answer any question,
which should be propounded to him: Whoever refused this
oath, though on pretence that he might thereby be brought
to accuse himself or his dearest: friend, was punishable by
imprisonment: And in short, an inquisitorial tribunal, with
all its terrors and iniquities, was erected in the kingdom.
Full discretionary powers were bestowed with regard to the
inquiry, trial, sentence, and penalty inflicted; excepting
only that corporal punishments were restrained by that pa∣tent
of the prince, which erected that court, not by the
act of parliament, which empowered him. By reason of
the uncertain limits, which separate ecclesiastical from civil
causes, all accusations of adultery and incest were tried by
the court of high commission; and every complaint of
wives against their husbands was there examined and dis∣cussed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 200.</NOTE>.
On like pretences, every cause, which regarded
couscience, that is, every cause, could have been brought
under their jurisdiction.</P>
<P>BUT there was a sufficient reason, why the king would
not be solicitous to stretch the jurisdiction of this court:
The star-chamber possessed the same authority in civil mat∣ters;
and its methods of proceeding were equally arbitrary
and unlimited. The origin of this court was derived from
the most remote antiquity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 473. In Chambers's case it was the unanimous opinion of all the court of King's Bench, that the court of star-chamber was not derived from the statute of Henry VII. bat was a court many years before, and one of the most high and ho∣nourable courts of justice. See Croke's rep. term. Mich. 5 Car. I. See further Camden's Brit. vol. i. introd. p. 254. Edit, of Gibson.</NOTE>; though, it is pretended, that its
power had been first carried to the utmost height by Henry
VII. In all times, however, it is confessed, it enjoyed au∣thority;
and at no time was its authority circumscribed, or
method of proceeding directed, by any precise law or
statute.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="126"/>
WE have had already, or shall have sufficient occasion,
during the course of this history, to mention the dispensing
power, the power of imprisonment, of exacting forced loans<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During the two last centuries, no reign had passed without some forced loans from the subject.</NOTE>
and benevolence, of pressing and quartering soldiers, of altering
the customs, of erecting monopolies. These branches of
power, if not directly opposite to the principles of all free
government, must, at least, be acknowleged dangerous to
freedom in a monarchical constitution; where an eternal
jealousy must be preserved against the sovereign, and no dis∣cretionary
powers must ever be entrusted to him, by which
the property or personal liberty of any subject can be af∣fected.
The kings of England, however, had almost con∣stantly
exercised these powers; and if, on any occasion, the
prince had been obliged to submit to laws enacted against
them, he had ever, in practice, eluded these laws, and re∣turned
to the same arbitrary administration. During more
than a century before the accession of James, the regal au∣thority,
in almost all these particulars, had never once been
called in question.</P>
<P>WE may also observe, that the principles in general,
which prevailed during that age, were so favourable to
monarchy, that they bestowed on it an authority almost ab∣solute
and unlimited, sacred and indefeasible.</P>
<P>THE meetings of parliament were so precarious; their
sessions so short, compared to the vacations; that, when
men's eyes were turned upwards in search of sovereign
power, the prince alone was apt to strike them as the only
permanent magistrate, invested with the whole majesty and
authority of the state. The great complaisance too of par∣liaments,
during so long a period, had extremely degraded
and obscured those assemblies; and as all instances of oppo∣sition
to prerogative must have been drawn from a remote
age, they were unknown to a great many, and had the less
<PB N="103" REF="127"/>
authority even with those, who were acquainted with them.
These examples, besides, of liberty, had commonly been
accompanied with such circumstances of violence, convul∣sion,
civil war, and disorder, that they presented but a dis∣agreeable
idea to the inquisitive part of the people, and af∣forded
small inducement to renew such dismal scenes. By a
great many, therefore, monarchy, simple and unmixed,
was conceived to be the government of England; and those
popular assemblies were supposed to form only the ornament
of the fabric, without being, in any degree, essential to its
being and existence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>“Monarchies,” according to Sir Walter Raleigh, “are of two forts touching their power or authority, <HI>viz.</HI> I. Entire, where the whole power of ordering all state matters, both in peace and war, doth, by law and custom, appertain to the prince, as in the English kingdom; where the prince hath the power to make laws, league and war; to create ma∣giftrates; to pardon life; of appeal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Though, to give a content∣ment to the other degrees, they have a suffrage in making laws, yet ever subject to the prince's pleasure and negative will.—2. Limited or restrain∣ed that hath no full power in all the points and matters of state, as the military king, that hath not the sovereignty in time of peace, as the making of laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But in war only, as the Polonian king. <HI>Maxims of State.</HI>”</P>
<P>And a little after, “In every just state, some part of the government is, “ or ought to be, imparted to the people, as in a kingdom, a voice and suffrage in making laws; and sometimes also of levying of arms (if the charge be great, and the prince forced to borraw help of his subjects) the matter rightly may be propounded to a parliament, that the tax may <HI>seem</HI> to have proceeded from themselves. So consultations and some proceed∣ings in judicial matters may, in part, be referred to them. The reason, left, seeing themselves to be in no number nor of reckoning, they mislike the state or government.” This way of reasoning differs little from that of the King, who considered the privileges of the parliament as matters of grace and indulgence, more than of inheritance. It is remarka∣ble, that Raleigh was thought to lean towards the puritanical party, not∣withstanding these positions. But ideas of government change much in dif∣ferent times.</P>
<P>Raleigh's sentiments on this head are still more openly expressed, in his <HI>Prerogative of parliaments,</HI> a work not published till after his death. It is a dialogue between a courtier or counsellor and a country justice of peace, who represents the patriot party, and defends the highest notions of liberty, which the principles of that age would bear. Here is a passage of it: <HI>Counsellor.</HI> That which is done by the King, with the advice of his private or privy council, is done by the King's absolute power. <HI>Justice.</HI> And by whose power is it done in parliament but by the King's absolute power! Mistake it not, my Lord: The three estates do but advise as the privy council doth; which advice, if the King embrace, it becomes the King's own act in the one, and the King's law in the other, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>The Earl of Clare, in a private letter to his son-in-law Sir Thomas Wentworth, afterwards Earl of Strafford, thus expresses himself, “We live under a prerogative government, where book law submits to lex loquens.” He spoke from his own, and all his anceslors, experience. There was no single instance of power, which a King of England might not, at that time, exert, on pretence of necessity or expediency: The continuance alone or frequent repetition of arbitrary administration might prove dangerous, for want of force to support it. It is remarkable that this letter of the Earl of Clare was wrote in the first year of Charles's reign; and consequently must be meant of the general genius of the government, not the spirit or temper of the mon∣arch. See Strafford's letters, vol i. p. 32. From another letter in the same collection, vol. i. p. 10. it appears that the council sometimes assumed the power of forbidding persons, disagreeable to the court, to stand in the elec∣tions. This authority they could exert in some instances; but we are not thence to infer, that they could shut the door of that house to every one who was not acceptable to them. The genius of the antient government reposed more trust in the King, than to entertain any such suspicion, and it allowed scattered instances, of such a kind as would have been totally destructive of the constitution, had they been continued without interruption.</P>
<P>I have not met with any English writer of that age, who speaks of England as a limited monarchy, but as an absolute one, where the people have many privileges. That is no contradiction. In all European monarchies, the people have privileges; but, whether dependant or independant on the will of the monarch, is a question, that, in most governments, it is best to forbear. Surely that question was not determined, before the age of James. The, rising spirit of the parliament, together with that King's love of general, speculative principles, brought it from its obscurity, and made it he com∣monly canvassed. The strongest testimony, which I remember from a writer of James's age, in favour of English liberty, is in Cardinal Bentivoglio, a foreigner, who mentions the English government as similar to that of the Low-country provinces under their princes, rather than to that of France or Spain. Englishmen were not so sensible that their prince was limited, because they were sensible, that no individual had any full security against a stretch of pre∣rogative: But foreigners, by comparison, could perceive, that these stretches were, at that time, from custom or other causes, less frequent in England than in other monarchies. Philip de Comines too remarked the English con∣stitution to be more popular, in his time, than that of France. But in a paper, wrote by a patriot in 1627, it is remarked that the freedom of speech in parliament had been lost in England, since the days of Comines, See Franklyn, p. 238.</P></NOTE>;. The prerogative of the crown was
<PB N="104" REF="128"/>
represented by lawyers as something real and durable; like
those eternal essences of the schools, which no time nor
<PB N="105" REF="129"/>
force could alter. The sanction of religion, was, by divines,
called in aid; and the Monarch of heaven was supposed to
be interested in supporting the authority of his earthly vice∣gerent.
And though these doctrines were perhaps more
openly inculcated and more strenuously insisted on during
the reign of the Stuarts, they were not then invented; and
were only found by the court to be more necessary at that
period, by reason of the opposite doctrines, which <HI>began</HI>
to be promulgated by the puritanical party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Passive obedience is expressly and zealously inculcated in the homilies, composed and published by authority, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The convocation, which met in the very first year of the King's reign, voted as high monarchical principles as are contained in the decrees of the university of Oxford, voted during the rule of the tories. These principles, so far from being deemed a novelty, introduced by King James's influence, passed so smoothly, that no historian has taken notice of them: They were never the subject of controversy, or dispute, or discourse; and it is only by means of bishop Overall's Convocation-book, printed near seventy years after, that we are acquainted with them. Would James, who was so cautious, and even timid, have ventured to begin his reign with a bold stroke, which would have given just ground of jealousy to his subjects? It appears, from that monarch's Basilicon Doron, written while he was in Scotland, that the republican ideas of the origin of power from the people were, at that time, esteemed puritanical novelties. The patriarchal scheme, it is remarkable, is inculcated in those votes of the convocation preserved by Overall; nor was Filmer the first inventer of those absurd notions.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN consequence of these exalted ideas of kingly authority, the prerogative, beside the instances of jursdiction, founded on precedent, was, by many, supposed to possess an inex∣haustible fund of latent powers, which might be exerted on any emergence. In every government, necessity, when real, supersedes all laws, and levels all limitations: But, in the English government, convenience alone was conceived to au∣thorize any extraordinary act of regal power, and to render it obligatory on the people. Hence the strict obedience re∣quired to proclamations, during all periods of the English histo∣ry

and, if James has incurred blame on account of his
edicts, it is only because he issued them at a time, when they
began to be less regarded, not because he first assumed or
extended to an unusual degree that exercise of authority.
Of his maxims in a parallel case, the following is a pretty
remarkable instance.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth had appointed commissioners for the
inspection of prisons, and had bestowed on them full dis∣cretionary
powers to adjust all differences between prisoners
and their creditors, to compound debts, and to give liberty to
such debtors as they found honest, and incapable of making
full payment. From the uncertain and undefined nature of
the English constitution, doubts sprang up in many, that
this commission was contrary to law; and it was represented
in that light to James. He forbore therefore to renew the
commission, till the fifteenth of his reign; when complaints
rose so high, with regard to the abuses practised in prisons,
that he thought himself obliged to overcome his scruples,
and to appoint new commissioners, invested with the same
discretionary powers, which Elizabeth had formerly con∣ferred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xviii. p. 117, 594.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, we must conceive that monarchy, on
the accession of the house of Stuart, was possessed of a
very extensive authority: An authority, in the judgment of
all, not exactly limited; in the judgment of some, not limit∣able.
But, at the same time, this authority was founded
merely on the opinion of the people, influenced by antient
precedent and example. It was not supported either by
money or by force of arms. And, for this reason, we need
not wonder, that the princes of that line were so extremely
jealous of their prerogative; being sensible, that, when
those claims were ravished from them, they possessed no in∣fluence,
by which they could maintain their dignity. By
the changes, which have since been introduced, the liberty
<PB N="107" REF="133"/>
and independence of individuals has been rendered much
more full, intire, and secure; that of the public more un∣certain
and precarious.</P>
<P>WE have had occasion to remark,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ecclesiasti∣cal govern∣ment.</NOTE> in so many instances,
the bigotry which prevailed in that age, that we can look
for no toleration among the different sects. Two Arians,
under the title of heretics, were punished with fire during
this period; and no one reign, since the reformation, had
been free from like barbarities. Stowe says, that these
Arians were offered their pardon at the stake, if they would
merit it by a recantation. A madman, who called himself
the Holy Ghost, was, without any indulgence for his frenzy,
condemned to the same punishment. Twenty pounds a month,
by law, could be levied from every one, who frequented
not the established worship. This rigorous law, however,
had one indulgent clause, that the fines exacted should not
exceed two thirds of the yearly income of the person. It
had been usual for Elizabeth to allow those penalties to run
on for several years; and to levy them all at once, to the
utter ruin of such catholics, as had incurred her displeasure.
James was more humane in this, as in every other respect.
The puritans formed a sect, which secretly lurked in the
church, but pretended not to any separate worship or disci∣pline.
An attempt of that kind would have been universally
regarded as the most unpardonable enormity. And had the
King been disposed to grant the puritans a full toleration for
a separate exercise of their religion, it is certain, from the
spirit of the times, that that sect itself would have despised
and hated him for it, and would have reproached him with
luke-warmness and indifference in the cause of religion. They
maintained, that they themselves were the only pure church;
that their principles and practices ought to be established by
law; and that no others ought to be tolerated. It may be
questioned, therefore, whether the administration at this
time could with propriety deserve the appellation of perse∣cutors
<PB N="108" REF="134"/>
with regard to the puritans. Such of the clergy as
refused to comply with the legal ceremonies were indeed
deprived of their livings, and sometimes were otherwise
punished: And ought any man to accept of an office or
benefice in an establishment, while he declines compliance
with the fixed and known rules of that establishment? But
puritans were never punished for frequenting separate con∣gregations;
because there were none such in the kingdom;
and no protestant ever assumed or pretended to the right of
erecting them. Even the greatest well-wishers of the puri∣tanical
sect would have condemned a practice, which in
that age was universally regarded as subversive of civil so∣ciety<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Even so great a philosopher as Lord Bacon, thought that uniformity in religion was necessary to the support of government, and that no toleration ought to be given to sectaries. See his essay <HI>de unitate ecclesioe.</HI></NOTE>.
And nothing but the imputation of idolatry, which
was thrown on the catholic religion, could justify in their
eyes the separation made by the Hugonots and other pro∣testants,
who lived in popish countries.</P>
<P>THE liberty of the press was incompatible with such
maxims and such principles of government, and was there∣fore
quite unknown in that age. Besides employing the
two terrible courts of star-chamber and high commission,
whose power was unlimited; Queen Elizabeth exerted her
authority by restraints upon the press. She passed a decree
in her court of star-chamber, that is, by her own will and
pleasure, forbidding any book to be printed in any place
but in London, Oxford, and Cambridge<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">28th of Elizabeth. See state-trials: Sir Robert Knightly, vol. vii, edit. 1.</NOTE>: And another, in
which she prohibited, under severe penalties, the publishing
any book or pamphlet <HI>against the form or meaning of any
restraint or ordinance, contained or to be contained, in any
statute or laws of this realm, or in any injunction made or set
forth by her Majesty or her privy council, or against the true
sense or meaning of any letters patent, commissions or prohi∣bitions
<PB N="109" REF="135"/>
under the great seal of England</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom, xvii. p. 522.</NOTE>;. James extended
the same penalties to the importing such books from abroad<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>.
And to render those edicts more effectual, he afterwards
inhibited the printing any book without a permission from the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, the
bishop of London, or the vice-chancellor of one of the
universities, or of some person appointed by them<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 616.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE manners of the nation were agreeable to the mo∣narchical
government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners.</NOTE> which prevailed; and contained not
that strange mixture, which, at present, distinguishes Eng∣land
from all other countries. Such violent extremes were
then unknown, of industry and debauchery, frugality and
profusion, civility and rusticity, fanatacism and scepticism.
Candour, sincerity, modesty are the only qualities, which
the English of that age possessed in common with the
present.</P>
<P>HIGH pride of family then prevailed; and it was by a
dignity and stateliness of behaviour, that the gentry and
nobility distinguished themselves from the common people.
Great riches, acquired by commerce, were more rare, and
had not, as yet, been able to confound all ranks of men,
and render money the chief foundation of distinction.
Much ceremony took place in the common intercourse of
life, and little familiarity was indulged by the great. The
advantages, which result from opulence, are so solid and
real, that those possessed of them need not dread the near
approaches of their inferiors. The distinctions of birth
and title, being more empty and imaginary, soon vanish,
upon familiar access and acquaintance.</P>
<P>THE expences of the great consisted in pomp and show,
and a numerous retinue, rather than in convenience and
true pleasure. The Earl of Nottingham, in his embassy to
Spain, was attended with 500 persons: The Earl of Hert∣ford,
<PB N="110" REF="136"/>
in that to Brussels, carried 300 gentlemen along with
him. Lord Bacon has remarked, that the English nobility,
in his time, maintained a larger retinue of servants than the
nobility of any other nation, except, perhaps, the Po∣landers<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Essays Deproser. sin, imp.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CIVIL honours, which now hold the first place, were,
at that time, subordinate to the military. The young
gentry and nobility were fond of distinguishing themselves
by arms. The fury of duels too prevailed more than at any
time before or since<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 5.</NOTE>. This was the turn, that the ro∣mantic
chivalry, for which the nation was formerly so re∣nowned,
had lately taken.</P>
<P>LIBERTY of commerce between the sexes was indulged;
but without any licentiousness of manners. The court was
very little an exception to this observation. James had ra∣ther
entertained an aversion and contempt for the females;
nor were those young courtiers, of whom he was so fond,
able to break through the established manners of the na∣tion.</P>
<P>THE country life prevails at present in England beyond
any cultivated nation of Europe: but it was then much
more generally embraced by all the gentry. The increase of
arts, pleasures, and social commerce, was just beginning to
produce an inclination for the softer and more civilized life
of the city. James discouraged, as much as possible, this
alteration of manners. “ He was wont to be very earnest,”
as Lord Bacon tells us, “ with the country gentlemen to go
“ from London to their country feats”. And sometimes he
would say thus to them: “ <HI>Gentlemen, at London, yon are
“ like sbips in a sea, which show like nothing; but, in your
“ country villages, you are like ships in a river, which lesk
“ like great things</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Apophthegms.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>HE was not contented with reproof and exhortation. As
Queen Elizabeth had perceived, with regret, the increase of
<PB N="111" REF="137"/>
London, and had restrained all new buildings by proclama∣tion;
James, who found that these edicts were not exactly
obeyed, frequently renewed them; though a strict execution
seems still to have been wanting. Re-iterated proclamations
he also issued, in imitation of his predecessor; containing
severe menaces against the gentry, who lived in town<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 632.</NOTE>.
This policy is contrary to that, which has ever been prac∣tised
by all princes, who studied the increase of their au∣thority.
To allure the nobility to court; to engage them
in expensive pleasures or employments, which dissipate their
fortune; to increase their subjection to ministers by attend∣ance;
to weaken their authority in the provinces by ab∣sence;
These have been the common arts of arbitrary go∣vernment.
But James had no money to support a splendid
court, or bestow on a numerous retinue of gentry and nobi∣lity.
He thought too, that, by their living together, they
became more sensible of their own strength, and were apt
to indulge too curious researches into matters of government.
To remedy the present evil, he was desirous of dispersing
them into their country seats; where, he hoped, they would
bear a more submissive reverence to his authority, and re∣ceive
less support from each other. But the contrary effect
soon followed. The riches, amassed, during their residence
at home, rendered them independant. The influence ac∣quired
by hospitality, made them formidable. They would
not be led by the court: They could not be driven: And
thus the system of the English government received a total
and a sudden alteration in the course of less than forty
years.</P>
<P>THE first rise of commerce and the arts had contributed,
in preceding reigns, to scatter those immense fortunes of the
barons, which rendered them so formidable both to King
and people. The farther progress of these advantages be∣gan,
during this reign, to ruin the small proprietors of
<PB N="112" REF="138"/>
land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cabbala, p. 224. first edit.</NOTE>; and, by both events, the gentry, or that rank
which composed the house of commons, enlarged their
power and authority. The early improvements in luxury
were seized by the greater nobles, whose fortunes, placing
them above frugality, or even calculation, were soon dis∣sipated
in expensive pleasures. These improvements reached
at last all men of property; and those of slender fortunes,
who, at that time, were often men of family, imitating
those of a rank immediately above them, reduced them∣selves
to poverty. Their lands, coming to sale, swelled the
estates of those, who possessed riches sufficient for the fashion∣able
expences; but who were not exempted from some care
and attention to their domestic oeconomy.</P>
<P>THE gentry also of that age were engaged in no expence,
except that of country hospitality. No taxes were levied,
no wars waged, no attendance at court expected, no bribery
or profusion required at elections<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Men soem then to have been ambitious of representing the counties, but careless of the boroughs.

<P>THE condition of the King's revenue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Finances.</NOTE> as it stood in 1617,
is thus stated<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See abstract, or brief declaration of his Majesty's revenue, with the assignations and defalcations upon the same.</NOTE>. Of crown lands, 80,000 pounds a year;
by customs and new impositions, near 190,000; by wards
and other various branches of revenue, beside purveyance,
180,000. The whole amounting to 450,000. The King's
ordinary disbursements, by the same account, are said to ex∣ceed
this sum thirty-six thousand pounds<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The excess was formerly greater, as appears by Salisbury's account See chap. 2.</NOTE>. All the ex∣traordinary
<PB N="113" REF="139"/>
sums, which he had raised by subsidies, loans,
sale of lands, sale of the title of baronet, money paid by the
states, and by the King of France, benevolences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were,
in the whole, about two millions two hundred thousand
pounds. Of which the sale of lands afforded seven hundred
and seventy-five thousand pounds. The extraordinary dis∣bursements
of the King amounted to two millions; beside
above four hundred thousand pounds given in presents.
Upon the whole, a sufficient reason appears, partly from ne∣cessary
expences, partly from want oeconomy, why the
King, even early in his reign, was very deeply involved in
debt, and found great difficulty to support the government.</P>
<P>FARMERS, not commissioners, levied the customs. It
seems, indeed, requisite, that the former method should
always be tried before the latter; though a preferable one.
When men's own interest is concerned, they fall upon an hun∣dred
expedients to prevent frauds in the merchants; and
these the public may afterwards imitate, in establishing pro∣per
rules for its officers.</P>
<P>THE customs were supposed to amount to five <HI>per cent.</HI>
of the value, and were levied upon exports, as well as im∣ports.
Nay, the imposition upon exports, by James's ar∣bitrary
additions, is said to amount, in some few instances,
to twenty-five <HI>per cent.</HI> This practice, so hurtful to in∣dustry,
prevails still in France, Spain, and most countries of
Europe. The customs in 1604, yielded 127,000 pounds
a year<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. 21 May, 1604.</NOTE>: They rose to 160,000 towards the end of
the reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. 31 May, 1621.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INTEREST, during this reign, was never below eight <HI>per
cent.</HI> An indication of the great profits and small progress
of commerce.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary supplies granted by the parliament,
during this whole reign, amounted not to more than
<PB N="114" REF="140"/>
630,000 pounds; which, divided among twenty-one years,
makes 30,000 pounds a year. I do not include those sup∣plies,
amounting to 300,000 pounds; which were given
the King by his last parliament. These were paid in to their
commissioners; and the expences of the Spanish war were
much more than sufficient to exhaust them. The distressed
family of the Palatine was a great burthen on James, during
part of his reign. The King, it must be owned, possessed
not frugality, proportioned to the extreme narrowness of his
revenue. Splendid equipages, however, he did not affect, nor
costly furniture, nor a luxurious table, nor prodigal mis∣tresses.
His buildings too were not sumptuous; though the
banquetting-house must not be forgot, as a monument,
which does honour to his reign. Hunting was his chief
amusement, the cheapest pleasure in which a King can in∣dulge
himself. His expences were the effects of liberality,
rather than of luxury.</P>
<P>ONE day, it is said, while he was standing amidst some
of his courtiers, a porter passed by, loaded with money,
which he was carrying to the treasury. The King observed,
that Rich, afterwards Earl of Holland, one of his handsome
agreeable favourites, whispered somewhat to one standing
near him. Upon enquiry, he found, that Rich had said,
<HI>How happy would that money make me!</HI> Without hesitation,
James bestowed it all upon him, though it amounted to
3000 pounds. He added, <HI>You think yourself very happy
in obtaining so large a sum; but I am more happy, in
having an opportunity of obliging a worthy man, whom I
love.</HI> The generosity of James was more the result of a
benign humour or light fancy than of reason or judgment,
The objects of it were such as could render themselves
agreeable to him in his loose hours; not such as were en∣dowed
with great merit, or who possessed talents or popu∣larity,
which could strengthen his interest with the people.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="141"/>
SUBSIDIES and fifteenths are frequently mentioned by
historians; but neither the amount of these taxes, nor the
method of imposing them, have been well explained. It
appears, that the fifteenths formerly corresponded to the
name, and were that proportinable part of the moveables<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Coke's Inst. book iv. cap. i. Of fifteens, quinzins.</NOTE>.
But a valuation being made, during the reign of Edward III.
that valuation was always adhered to, and each town paid
unalterably a particular sum, which they themselves assessed
upon the inhabitants. The same tax in corporate towns
was called a tenth; because there it was, at first, a tenth
of the moveables. The whole amount of a tenth and fif∣teenth
through the kingdom, or a fifteenth, as it is often
more concisely called, was about 29,000 pounds<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. subsidies temporary.</NOTE>. The
amount of a subsidy was not invariable, like that of a fif∣teenth.
In the eighth of Elizabeth, a subsidy amounted to
120,000 pounds: In the fortieth, it was not above 78,000<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Journ, 11 July 1610.</NOTE>. It afterwards fell to 70,000; and was continu∣ally
decreasing<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Coke's Inst. book iv. chap. I. Subsidies temporary.</NOTE>. The reason is easily collected from the
method of levying it. We may learn from the subsidy
bills<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See statutes at large.</NOTE>, that one subsidy was given for four shillings in the
pound on land, and two shillings and eight pence on move∣ables
throughout the counties; a considerable tax, had it
been strictly levied. But this was only the antient state of
a subsidy. During the reign of James, there was not paid
the twentieth part of that sum. The tax was so far perso∣nal,
that a man paid only in the county where he lived,
though he should possess estates in other counties; and the
assessors formed a loose estimation of his property, and
rated him accordingly. To preserve, however, some rule
in the estimation, it seems to have been the practice to keep
an eye to former assessments, and to rate every man accord∣ing
as his ancestors, or men of such an estimated property,
were accustomed to pay. This was a sufficient reason, why
<PB N="114" REF="142"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="115" REF="143"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="116" REF="144"/>
subsidies could not increase, notwithstanding the great in∣crease
of money and rise of rents. But there was an evi∣dent
reason, why they continually decreased. The favour,
as is natural to suppose, ran always against the crown;
especially during the latter end of Elizabeth, when subsi∣dies
became numerous and frequent, and the sums levied
were considerable, compared to former supplies. The assessors,
though accustomed to have an eye to antient estimations,
were not bound to observe any such rule; but
might rate anew any person, according to his present in∣come.
When rents fell, or parts of an estate were sold off,
the proprietor was sure to represent these losses, and obtain a
diminution of his subsidy; but where rents rose, or new
lands were purchased, he kept his own secret, and paid no
more than formerly. The advantage, therefore, of every
change was taken against the crown; and the crown could
obtain the advantage of none. And to make the matter
worse, the alterations, which happened in property during
this age, were, in general, unfavourable to the crown. The
small proprietors, or twenty pound men, went continually
to decay; and when their estates were swallowed up by a
greater, the new purchaser increased not his subsidy. So
loose indeed is the whole method of rating subsidies, that the
wonder was not how the tax should continually diminish;
but how it yielded any revenue at all. It became at last so
unequal and uncertain, that the parliament was obliged to
change it for a land tax.</P>
<P>THE price of corn, during this reign, and by conse∣quence,
that of the other necessaries of life, was no lower,
or was rather higher, than at present. By a proclamation
of James, establishing public magazines, whenever wheat
fell below thirty-two shillings a quarter, rye below eighteen,
barley below sixteen, the commissioners were empowered to
purchase corn for the magazines<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 526.</NOTE>. These prices then are
to be regarded as low; though they would pass for high
<PB N="117" REF="145"/>
by our present estimation. The best wool, during the
greatest part of James's reign, was at thirty-three shillings a
tod: At present, it is not above two-thirds of that value;
though it is to be presumed, that our exports in woollen
goods are considerably increased. The finer manufactures
too, by the progress of art and industry, have rather di∣minished,
notwithstanding the great increase of money. In
Shakespear, the hostess tells Falstaff, that the shirts she
bought him were holland at eight shillings a yard; a very
high price at this day, even supposing, what is not proba∣ble,
that the best holland at that time was equal in good∣ness
to the best which can now be purchased. In like man∣ner,
a yard of velvet, about the middle of Elizabeth's reign,
was valued at two and twenty shillings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a compendium or dialogue inserted in the Memoirs of Wool, chap. 23.</NOTE>. I have not been
able by any inquiry to learn the common price of butcher's
meat during the reign of James<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The author has since discovered in Dr. Birch's Life of Prince Henry, that that Prince made an allowance of near a groat a pound for all the beef and mutton used in his family. See p. 449. This price agrees very well with the calculations here delivered.</NOTE>. But as bread is the chief
article of food, and its price regulates that of every thing
else, we may presume, that cattle bore a high value as well
as corn. Besides, we must consider, that the general turn
of that age, which no laws could prevent, was the con∣verting
arable land into pasture: A certain proof that the
latter was found more profitable, and consequently that all
butcher's meat, as well as bread, was considerably higher
than at present. We have a regulation of the market with
regard to poultry and some other articles, very early in
Charles the First's reign<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix. p. 511.</NOTE>; and the prices are high. A
turkey cock four shillings and sixpence, a turkey hen three
shillings, a pheasant cock fix shillings, a pheasant hen five
shillings, a partridge one shilling, a goose two shillings, a
capon two and sixpence, a pullet one and sixpence, a rab∣bit
<PB N="118" REF="146"/>
eight pence, a dozen of pigeons six shillings<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">We may judge of the great grievance of purveyance by this circumstance, that the purveyors often gave but sixpence for a dozen of pigeons, and two peace for a fowl. Journ. 25 May, 1626.</NOTE>. We
must consider, that London at present is more than three
times the bulk it was at that time A circumstance, which
much increases the, price of poultry, and of every thing
that cannot conveniently be brought from a distance. The
chief difference in expence between that age and the present
consists in the imaginary wants of men, which have since
extremely multiplied. These are the principal reasons, why
James's revenue would go farther than the same money in
our time; though the difference is not near so great as is
usually imagined.</P>
<P>THE public was entirely free from the great danger and
expence of a standing army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> While James was vaunting
his divine vicegerency, and boasting of an almost unlimited
prerogative, he possessed not so much as a single regiment
of guards to maintain his extensive claims: A sufficient
proof, that he sincerely believed his pretensions to be
well grounded, and a strong presumption, that they were at
least built on what were then deemed plausible arguments.
The militia of England, amounting to 160,000 men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1 March, 1623.</NOTE>,
were the sole defence of the kingdom. It is pretended,
that they were kept in very good order during this reign<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Stowe. See also Sir Walter Raleigh of the prerogatives of parliament, and Johnstoni hist. lib. 18.</NOTE>.
The city of London procured officers, who had served
abroad, and who taught the trained bands their exercises in
Artillery garden; a practice which had been discontinued
since 1588. All the counties of England, in emulation of
the capital, were fond of showing a well ordered and well
appointed militia. It appeared, that the natural propen∣sity
of men towards military shows and exercises will always
be sufficient, with a little attention of the sovereign, to
excite and support this spirit in any nation. The very
<PB N="119" REF="147"/>
boys, at this time, in mimickry of their elders, inlisted
themselves voluntarily into companies, elected officers, and
practised the discipline, of which the models were every
day exposed to their view<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE>. Sir Edward Harwood, in, a
memorial composed at the beginning of the subsequent reign,
says, that England was so unprovided of horses fit for war,
that 2000 men could not possibly be mounted throughout
the whole kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the Harleyan miscellany, vol. iv. p. 255.</NOTE>. At present, the breed of horses is so
much improved, that almost all those employed, either for
the plough, waggon, or coach, would be fit for that
purpose.</P>
<P>THE disorders of Ireland obliged James to keep up some
forces there, and put him to a great expence. The com∣mon
pay of a private man in the infantry was eight pence a
day, a lieutenant two shillings, an ensign eighteen pence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ry∣mer, tom. xvi. p. 717.</NOTE>.
The armies in Europe were not near so numerous, during
that age; and the private men, we may observe, were
drawn from a better rank than at present, and approaching
nearer to that of the officers<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In older times, soldiers were still of a higher rank. The Duke of Clarence, son to Edward III. when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, had for the pay of his army these appointments. For himself thirteen shillings and fourpence a day, for his knights two shillings a piece, for his archers six pence. This last would now be equal to a crown a day.

<P>IN the year 1583, there was a general review made of all
the men in England capable of bearing arms; and these
were found to amount to 1,172000 men, according to
Raleigh<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Of the invention of shipping. This number is much superior to that contained in Marden, and delivered by Sir Edward Coke to the house of commons; and is more likely.</NOTE>. It is impossible to warrant the exactness of this
computation; or rather, we may fairly presume it to be
somewhat inaccurate. But if it approached near the truth,
England has probably, since that time, increased much in
populousness. The growth of London, in riches and
<PB N="120" REF="148"/>
beauty, as well as numbers of inhabitants, has been prodi∣gious.
From 1600, it doubled every forty years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William Petty.</NOTE>; and
consequently in 1680, it contained four times as many in∣habitants,
as at the beginning of the century. It has ever
been the center of all the trade in the kingdom; and almost
the only town which affords society and amusement. The
affection, which the English bear to a country life, makes
the provincial towns be little frequented by the gentry.
Nothing but the allurements of the capital, which is fa∣voured
by the residence of the king, by being the seat of
government, and of all the courts of justice, can prevail
over their passion for their rural villas.</P>
<P>LONDON, at this time, was almost intirely built of wood,
and in every respect was certainly a very ugly city. The Earl
of Arundel first introduced the practice of brick buildings<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's political discourses, p. 270.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE navy of England was esteemed very formidable in

and the growth of popery: Such violent propensity have
men to complain of the present times, and to entertain dis∣contents
against their fortune and condition. The King
himself was deceived by these popular complaints, and was
at a loss to account for the total want of money, which he
heard so much exaggerated<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 413.</NOTE>. It may, however, be affirmed,
that, during no preceding period of English history, was
there a more sensible increase, than during the reign of this
monarch, of all the advantages which distinguish a flou∣rishing
people. Not only the peace which he maintained,
was favourable to industry and commerce: His turn of mind
inclined him to promote the peaceful arts: And trade being
as yet in its infancy, all additions to it must have been the
more evident to every eye, which was not blinded by me∣lancholy
prejudices<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That of the honest historian Stowe seems not to have been of this number. “The great blessings of God, says he, through increase of wealth in the common subjects of this land, especially upon the citizens of London; such within men's memory, and chiefly within these few years of peace, that, except there were now due mention of some sort made thereof, it would in time to come be held incredible, &amp;c.” In another place, Amongst the manifold tokens and signs of the infinite blessings of Al∣mighty God bestowed upon this kingdom, by the wondrous and merciful establishing of peace within ourselves, and the full benefit of concord with all christian nations and others: Of all which graces let no man dare to presume he can speak too much; whereof in truth there can never be enough said, neither was there ever any people less considerate and less thankful than at this time, being not willing to endure the memory of their present happiness, as well in the universal increase of commerce and traffic throughout the kingdom, great building of royal ships and by private merchants, the re-peopling of cities, towns, and villages, beside the discernable and sudden increase of fair and costly buildings, as well within the city of London as the suburbs thereof, especially within these twelve years, &amp;c.”</NOTE>.</P>

BY an account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The trade's increase in the Harleyan misc. vol. iii.</NOTE>, which seems judicious and accurate, it
appears, that all the seamen, employed in the merchant ser∣vice,
amounted to 10000 men, which probably exceeds not
the sixth part of their present number. Sir Thomas Over∣bury
says, that the Dutch possessed three times more ship∣ping
than the English, but that their ships were of inferior
burden to those of the latter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Remarks on his travels, Harl misc. vol. ii. p. 349.</NOTE>. Sir William Monson com∣puted
the English naval power to be little or nothing infe∣rior
to the Dutch<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Naval Tracts, p. 329, 350.</NOTE>, which is surely an exaggeration.</P>
<P>A CATALOGUE of the manufactures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manufac∣tures.</NOTE> for which the
English were then eminent, would appear very contempti∣ble,
in comparison of those which flourish among them at
present. Almost all the more elaborate and curious arts
were only cultivated abroad, particularly in Italy. Ship∣building
and founding of iron cannon were the sole, in
which the English excelled. They seem, indeed, to have
possessed alone the secret of the latter; and great complaints
were made every parliament against the exportation of Eng∣lish
ordnance.</P>
<P>NINE tenths of the commerce of the kingdom consisted
in woollen goods<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26 May 1621.</NOTE>. Wool, however, was allowed to be
exported, till the 19th of the King. Its exportation was
then forbid by proclamation; tho' that edict was never
strictly executed. Most of the cloth was exported raw,
and was dyed and dressed by the Dutch; who gained, 'tis
pretended, 700,000 pounds a year by this manufacture<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Journ. 20th May 1614. Raleigh, in his observations, computers the loss at 400,000 pounds to the na∣tion. There are about 80,000 undressed cloths, says he, exported yearly. He computes, besides, that about 100,000 pounds a year had been lost by kersies; not to mention other articles.</NOTE>. A prohibition, issued by the King, to export cloth in that
condition, had succeeded so ill, during one year, by the re∣fusal
of the Dutch to buy the dressed cloth, that great
murmurs arose against it; and this measure was retracted
<PB N="123" REF="151"/>
by the King, and complained of by the nation, as if it
had been the most impolitic in the world. It seems indeed
to have been premature.</P>
<P>IN so little credit was the fine English cloth even at home,
that the King was obliged to seek expedients, by which he
might engage the people of fashion to wear it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 415.</NOTE>. The
manufacture of fine linen was totally unknown in the king∣dom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE company of merchant-adventurers, by their patent,
possessed the sole commerce of woollen goods, tho' the staple
commodity of the nation. An attempt, made during the
reign of Elizabeth, to lay open this important trade, had
been attended with bad consequences for a time, by a con∣spiracy
of the merchant-adventurers, not to make any pur∣chases
of cloth; and the Queen immediately restored them
their patent.</P>
<P>THEY were groundless fears of a like accident, that en∣slaved
the nation to those exclusive companies, which con∣fined
so much every branch of commerce and industry.
The parliament, however, annulled, in the third of the
King, the patent of the Spanish company; and the trade
to Spain, which was, at first, very insignificant, soon be∣came
the most considerable in the kingdom. 'Tis strange
that they were not thence encouraged to abolish all the
other companies, and that they went no farther than ob∣liging
them to enlarge their bottom, and to facilitate the
admission of new adventurers.</P>
<P>A BOARD of trade was erected by the King in 1622<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 410.</NOTE>. One of the reasons, assigned in the commission, is to re∣medy
the low price of wools, which begot complaints of
the decay of the woollen manufactory. 'Tis more pro∣bable,
however, that this fall of prices proceeded from the
increase of wool. The King likewise recommends it to the
<PB N="124" REF="152"/>
commissioners to inquire and examine, whether a greater
freedom of trade and an exemption from the restraint of
exclusive companies, would not be beneficial. Men were
then fettered by their own prejudices; and the King was
justly afraid of embracing a bold measure, the consequences
of which might be uncertain. The digesting of a naviga∣tion
act, of a like nature with the famous one executed
afterwards by the republican parliament, is likewise recom∣mended
to the commissioners. The arbitrary powers, then
commonly assumed by the privy council, appear evidently
thro' the whole tenor of the commission.</P>
<P>THE silk manufacture had no footing in England: But,
by James's direction, mulberry-trees were planted, and silk∣worms
introduced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stowe.</NOTE>. The climate seems unfavourable to
the execution of this project.</P>
<P>GREENLAND is thought to have been discovered during
this reign; and the whale-fishery was carried on with great
success: But the industry of the Dutch, in spite of all op∣position,
soon deprived the English of this source of riches.
A company was erected for the discovery of the north-west
passage; and many fruitless attempts were made for that
purpose. In such noble projects, despair ought never to be
admitted, till the absolute impossibility of success be fully
ascertained.</P>
<P>THE passage to the East-Indies had been opened to the
English during the reign of Elizabeth; but the trade to
those parts of the world was not intirely established till this
reign, when the East India company received a new patent,
enlarged their stock to 1,500,000 pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26th Nov. 1621.</NOTE>, and fitted out
several ships on these adventures. In 1609 they built a
vessel of 1200 ton, the largest merchant-ship which Eng∣land
had ever known. She was unfortunate, and perished
by shipwreck. In 1611, a large ship of the company, as∣sisted
by a pinnace, maintained five several engagements
<PB N="125" REF="153"/>
with a squadron of Portuguese, and gained a complete vic∣tory
over forces much superior. During the following
years, the Dutch company were guilty of great injuries to∣wards
the English, in expelling many of their factors, and
destroying their settlements: But these violences were re∣sented
with a proper spirit by the court of England. A na∣val
force was equipped under the Earl of Oxford<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1622.</NOTE>, and
lay in wait for the return of the Dutch East-India fleet.
By reason of cross winds, Oxford failed of his purpose, and
the Dutch escaped. Some time after, one ship, full of
riches, was taken by Vice-admiral Merwin; and it was
sti∣pulated by the Dutch to pay 70,000 pounds to the English
company, in consideration of the injuries which that com∣pany
had sustained<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Johnstoni hist. lib. 19.</NOTE>. But neither this stipulation, nor the
fear of reprisals, nor the sense of that friendship which sub∣sisted
between England and the states, could restrain the
avidity of the Dutch company, or render them equitable in
their proceedings towards their allies. Impatient to have
sole possession of the spice-trade, which the English then
shared with them, they assumed a jurisdiction over a factory
of the latter in the island of Amboyna; and on very impro∣bable,
and even absurd pretences, seized all the factors with
their families, and put them to death with the most inhu∣man
tortures. This dismal news arrived in England at the
time when James, by the prejudices of his subjects and the
intrigues of his favourite, was constrained to make a breach
with Spain; and he was obliged, after some remonstrances,
to acquiesce in this indignity from a state, whose alliance
was now become necessary to him. 'Tis remarkable that
the nation, almost without a murmur, submitted to this
injury from their protestant confederates; an injury, which,
besides the horrid enormity of the action, was of much
deeper importance to national interest, than all those which
they were so impatient to resent from the house of Au∣stria.</P>

WHAT chiefly renders the reign of James memorable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colonies.</NOTE> is
the commencement of the English colonies in America; co∣lonies
established on the noblest footing that has been known
in any age or nation. The Spaniards, being the first disco∣verers
of the new world, immediately took possession of the
precious mines which they found there; and, by the allure∣ment
of great riches, they were tempted to depopulate their
own country as well as that which they conquered; and
added the vice of sloth to those of avidity and barbarity,
which had attended their adventurers in those renowned en∣terprizes.
That fine coast was intirely neglected, which
reaches from St. Augustine to Cape Breton, and which lies
in all the temperate climates, is watered by noble rivers, and
offers a fertile soil, but nothing more, to the industrious
plánter. Peopled gradually from England by the necessitous
and indigent, who, at home, increased neither wealth nor
populousness, the colonies, which were planted along that
tract, have promoted the navigation, encouraged the in∣dustry,
and even multiplied the inhabitants of their mother-country.
The spirit of independency, which was reviving
in England, here shone forth in its full lustre, and received
new accession of force from the aspiring character of those,
who, being discontented with the established church and
monarchy, had sought for freedom amidst those savage de∣sarts.</P>
<P>QUEEN Elizabeth had done little more than given a name
to the continent of Virginia; and, after her planting one
feeble colony, which quickly decayed, that country was in∣tirely
abandoned. But when peace put an end to the mili∣tary
enterprizes against Spain, and left ambitious spirits no
hopes of making any longer such quick advances towards
honour and fortune, the nation began to second the pacific
intentions of its monarch, and to seek a surer, tho' slower
expedient, for acquiring riches and glory. In 1606, New∣port
carried over a colony, and began a settlement; which
the company, erected by patent for that purpose in London
<PB N="127" REF="157"/>
and Bristol, took care to supply with yearly recruits of pro∣visions,
utensils, and new inhabitants. About 1609, Ar∣gal
discovered a more direct and shorter passage to Vir∣ginia,
and left the tract of the antient navigators, who had
first directed their course southwards to the tropic, sailed
westward by means of the trade winds, and then turned
northward, till they reached the English settlements. The
same year, five hundred persons under Sir Thomas Gates
and Sir George Somers were embarked for Virginia. So∣mers's
ship, meeting with a tempest, was driven into Ber∣mudas,
and laid the foundation of a settlement in those
islands. Lord Delawar afterwards undertook the govern∣ment
of the English colonies: But notwithstanding all his
care, seconded by supplies from James, and by money
raised from the first lottery ever known in the kingdom,
such difficulties attended the settlement of these countries,
that, in 1614, there were not alive more than 400 men,
of all that had been sent thither. After supplying them∣selves
with provisions more immediately necessary for the
support of life, the new planters began the cultivating to∣bacco;
and James, notwithstanding his antipathy to that
drug, gave them permission to enter it in England; and he
inhibited by proclamation all importation from Spain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xviii. p. 621, 633.</NOTE>. By
degrees, new colonies were established in that continent, and
gave new names to the places where they settled, leaving
that of Virginia to the province first planted. The island
of Barbadoes was also planted in this reign.</P>
<P>SPECULATIVE reasoners, during that age, raised many
objections to the planting those remote colonies; and fore∣told,
that, after draining their mother-country of inhabit∣ants,
they would soon shake off her yoke, and erect an in∣dependent
government in America: But time has shown,
that the views, entertained by those who encouraged such
generous undertakings, were more just and solid. A mild
government and great naval force have preserved, and may
<PB N="128" REF="158"/>
long preserve the dominion of England over her colonies.
And such advantage have commerce and navigation reaped
from these establishments, that more than a fourth of the
English shipping is at present computed to be employed in
carrying on the traffick with the American settlements.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE was antiently very imperfect in England.
The sudden transitions, so often mentioned by historians,
from the lowest to the highest prices of grain, and the pro∣digious
inequality of its value in different years, are suffi∣cients
proofs, that the produce depended intirely on the
season, and that art had as yet done nothing to fence against
the injuries of the heavens. During this reign, consider∣able
improvements were made, as in most arts, so in this,
the most beneficial of any. A numerous catalogue might be
formed of books and pamphlets, treating of husbandry,
which were wrote about this time. The nation, however,
was still dependent on foreigners for daily bread; and tho'
its exportation of grain now forms a considerable branch of
its commerce, notwithstanding its increase of people, there
was in that period, a regular import from the Baltic as well
as from France; and if ever it stopped, the bad conse∣quences
were very sensibly felt by the nation. Sir Walter
Raleigh in his observations computes, that two millions
went out at one time for corn. It was not till the fifth of
Elizabeth, that the exportation of corn had ever been al∣lowed
in England; and Camden observes, that agriculture,
from that moment, received new life and vigour.</P>
<P>THE endeavours of James, or, more properly speaking,
those of the nation, for the promotion of trade, were at∣tended
with greater success than those for the encourage∣ment
of learning. Tho' the age was by no means destitute
of eminent writers, a very bad taste in general prevailed
during that period; and the monarch himself was not a
little infected with it.</P>
<P>ON the origin of letters among the Greeks,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Learning and arts.</NOTE> the genius of
poets and orators, as might naturally be expected, was dis∣tinguished
<PB N="129" REF="159"/>
by an amiable simplicity, which, whatever rude∣ness
may sometimes attend it, is so fitted to express the ge∣nuine
movements of nature and passion, that the composi∣tions
possessed of it must for ever appear valuable to the
discerning part of mankind. The glaring figures of dis∣course,
the pointed antithesis, the unnatural conceit, the
jingle of words; such false ornaments were not employed
by early writers; not because they were rejected, but be∣cause
they scarce ever occurred to them. An easy, unforced
strain of sentiment runs thro' their compositions; tho' at
the same time we may observe, that, amidst the most ele∣gant
simplicity of thought and expression, one is sometimes
surprised to meet with a poor conceit, which had presented
itself unsought for, and which the author had not acquired
critical observation enough to condemn<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of Polynices, one of Oedipus's sons, means in the original <HI>much quarrelling.</HI> In the altercations betwixt the two brothers, in Æschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, this conceit is employed; and 'tis remarkable, that so poor a conundrum could not be rejected by any of these three poets, so justly celebrated for their taste and simplicity. What could Shakespeare have done worse? Terence has his <HI>inceptio est amentium, non amantium.</HI> Many similar instances will occur to the learned. 'Tis well known that Aristotle treats very seriously of puns, divides them into several classes, and recom∣mends the use of them to orators.</NOTE>. A bad taste
seizes with avidity these frivolous beauties, and even per∣haps
a good taste, ere surfeited by them: They multiply
every day more and more in the fashionable compositions:
Nature and good sense are neglected: Laboured ornaments
studied and admired: And a total degeneracy of style and
language prepares the way for barbarism and ignorance.
Hence the Asiatic manner was found to depart so much
from the simple purity of Athens: Hence that tinsel elo∣quence,
which is observable in many of the Roman writers,
from which Cicero himself is not wholly exempted, and
which so much prevails in Ovid, Seneca, Lucan, Martial,
and the Plinys.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="160"/>
ON the revival of letters, when the judgment of the
public is as yet raw and unformed, this false glister catches
the eye, and leaves no room, either in eloquence or poetry,
for the durable beauties of solid sense and lively passion.
The reigning genius is then diametrically opposite to that
which prevails on the first origin of arts. The Italian wri∣ters,
'tis evident, even the most celebrated, have not reached
the proper simplicity of thought and composition; and in
Petrarch, Tasso, Guarini, frivolous witticisms and forced
conceits are but too predominant. The period, during
which letters were cultivated in Italy, was so short as scarce
to allow leisure for correcting this adulterated relish.</P>
<P>THE more early French writers are liable to the same re∣proach.
Voiture, Balzac, even Corneille, have too much
affected those ambitious ornaments, of which the Italians in
general, and the least pure of the antients, supplied them
with so many models. And it was not till late, that ob∣servation
and reflection gave rise to a more natural turn of
thought and composition among that elegant people.</P>
<P>A LIKE character may be extended to the first English
writers; such as flourished during the reign of Elizabeth
and James, and even till long afterwards. Learning, on its
revival in this island, was attired in the same unnatural
garb, which it wore at the time of its decay among the
Greeks and Romans. And, what may be regarded as a
misfortune, the English writers were possessed of great ge∣nius
before they were endued with any degree of taste, and
by that means gave a kind of sanction to those forced turns
and sentiments which they so much affected. Their dis∣torted
conceptions are attended with such vigour of mind,
that we admire the imagination which produced them, as
much as we blame the want of judgment which gave them
admittance. To enter into an exact criticism of the writers
of that age, would exceed our present purpose. A short
character of the most eminent, delivered with the same free∣dom
which history exercises over kings and ministers, may
<PB N="131" REF="161"/>
not be improper. The national prepossessions, which pre∣vail,
may perhaps render the former liberty not the least pe∣rilous
for an author.</P>
<P>IF Shakespeare be considered as a MAN, born in a rude
age, and educated in the lowest manner, without any in∣struction,
either from the world or from books, he may be
regarded as a prodigy: If represented as a POET, capable
of furnishing a proper entertainment to a refined or intelli∣gent
audience, we must abate somewhat of this eulogy. In
his compositions, we regret, that many irregularities, and
even sometimes absurdities should so frequently disfigure the
animated and passionate scenes intermixed with them; and
at the same time, we perhaps admire the more those beau∣ties,
on account of their being surrounded with such de∣formities.
A striking peculiarity of sentiment, adapted to a
singular character, he frequently hits, as it were by inspira∣tion;
but a reasonable propriety of thought he cannot, for
any time, uphold. Nervous and picturesque expressions,
as well as descriptions, abound in him; but 'tis in vain we
look either for continued purity or simplicity of diction.
His total ignorance of all theatrical art and conduct, how∣ever
material a defect; yet, as it affects the spectator rather
than the reader, we can more readily excuse, than that want
of taste which often prevails in his productions, and which
gives way, only by intervals, to the irradiations of genius.
A great and fertile genius he certainly possessed, and one
enriched equally with a tragic and comic vein; but, he
ought to be cited as a proof, how dangerous it is to rely
on these advantages alone for the attaining an excellence in
the finer arts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Invenire etiam barbari solent, disponere et ornare non nisi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cruditus. <HI>PLIN.</HI></NOTE>. And there may even remain a suspicion,
that we over-rate, if possible, the greatness of his genius;
in the same manner as bodies often appear more gigantic, on
account of their being disproportioned and mishapen. He
died in 1617, aged 53 years.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="162"/>
JOHNSON possessed all the learning which was wanting to
Shakespeare, and wanted all the genius of which the other
was possessed. Both of them were equally deficient in
taste and elegance, in harmony and correctness. A servile
copist of the antients, Johnson translated into bad English
the beautiful passages of the Greek and Roman authors,
without accommodating them to the manners of his age and
country. His merit has been totally eclipsed by that of
Shakespeare, whose rude genius prevailed over the rude art
of his cotemporary. The English theatre has ever since
taken a strong tincture of Shakespeare's spirit and character;
and thence it has proceeded, that the nation have undergone,
from all their neighbours, the reproach of barbarism, from
which their many valuable productions in other parts of
learning would otherwise have exempted them. Johnson
had a pension of a hundred marks from the King, which
Charles afterwards augmented to a hundred pounds. He
died in 1637, aged 63.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX has translated Tasso with an elegance and ease,
and, at the same time, with an exactness, which, for that
age, are surprising. Each line in the original is faithfully
rendered by a correspondent line in the translation. Har∣rington's
translation of Ariosto is not likewise without its
merit. 'Tis to be regretted, that these poets should have
imitated the Italians in their stanza, which has a prolixity and
uniformity in it, that displeases in long performances. They
had otherwise, as well as Spencer, who went before them,
contributed much to the polishing and refining the English
versification.</P>
<P>IN Donne's satires, when carefully inspected, there appear
some flashes of wit and ingenuity; but these totally suffo∣cated
and buried by the harshest and most uncouth expres∣sion
which is any-where to be met with.</P>
<P>IF the poetry of the English was so rude and imperfect
during that age, we may reasonably expect that their prose
<PB N="133" REF="163"/>
would be liable to still greater objections. Tho' the latter
appears the more easy, as it is the more natural method of
composition; it has ever in practice been found the more
rare and difficult; and there scarce is an instance, in any
language, that it has reached a degree of perfection, before
the refinement of poetical numbers and expression. English
prose, during the reign of James, was wrote with little regard
to the rules of grammar, and with a total disregard of the
elegance and harmony of the period. Stuffed with Latin
sentences and citations, it likewise imitated those inversions,
which, however forcible and graceful in the antient lan∣guages,
are intirely contrary to the idiom of the English.
I shall indeed venture to affirm, that, whatever uncouth
phrases and expressions occur in old books, they were owing
chiefly to the unformed taste of the author; and that the
language, spoke in the courts of Elizabeth and James, was
very little different from that which we meet with at present
in good company. Of this opinion, the little scraps of
speeches which are found in the parliamentary journals, and
which carry an air so opposite to the laboured orations, seem
to be a sufficient proof; and there want not productions of
that age, which, being wrote by men who were not authors
by profession, retain a very natural manner, and may give
us some idea of the language which prevailed among men
of the world. I shall particularly mention Sir John Davis's
discovery, Throgmorton's, Effex's, and Nevile's letters.</P>
<P>THE great glory of literature in this island, during the
reign of James, was my Lord Bacon. Most of his perform∣ances
were composed in Latin; tho' he possessed neither the
elegance of that, nor of his native tongue. If we consider
the variety of talents displayed by this man; as a public
speaker, a man of business, a wit, a courtier, a companion,
an author, a philosopher; he is justly the object of great
admiration. If we consider him merely as an author and
philosopher, the light in which we view him at present, tho'
very estimable, he was yet inferior to his cotemporary Gali∣laeo,
<PB N="134" REF="164"/>
perhaps even to Kepler. Bacon pointed out at a dis∣tance
the road to true philosophy: Galilaeo both pointed
it out to others, and made himself considerable advances in
it. The Englishman was ignorant of geometry: The Flo∣rentine
revived that science, excelled in it, and was the first
who applied it, together with experiment, to natural philo∣sophy.
The former rejected, with the most positive dis∣dain,
the system of Copernicus: The latter sortified it with
new proofs, derived both from reason and the senses. Ba∣con's
style is stiff and rigid: His wit, tho' often brilliant, is
sometimes unnatural and far-fetched; and he seems to be the
original of those pointed similies and long-spun allegories,
which so much distinguish the English authors: Galilaeo is a
lively and agreeable, tho' somewhat a prolix writer. But
Italy, not united in any single government, and perhaps fa∣tiated
with that literary glory, which it has possessed both
in antient and modern times, has too much neglected the
renown which it has acquired by giving birth to so great
a man. That national spirit, which prevails among the
English, and which forms their great happiness, is the cause
why they bestow on all their eminent writers, and on Bacon
among the rest, such praises and acclamations, as may often
appear partial and excessive. He died in 1626, in the 66th
year of his age.</P>
<P>IF the reader of Raleigh's history can have the patience to
wade thro' the Jewish and Rabbinical learning which com∣pose
the half of the volume, he will find, when he comes to
the Greek and Roman story, that his pains are not unre∣warded.
Raleigh is the best model of that antient style,
which some writers would affect to revive at present. He
was beheaded in 1618, aged 66 years.</P>
<P>CAMDEN'S history of Queen Elizabeth may be esteemed
good composition, both for the style and the matter. It
is wrote with simplicity of expression, very rare in that age,
and with a regard to truth. It would not perhaps be too
much to affirm, that it is among the best historical produc∣tions
<PB N="135" REF="165"/>
which have yet been composed by any Englishman.
'Tis well known that the English have not much excelled in
that kind of literature. He died in 1623, aged 73 years.</P>
<P>WE shall mention the king himself at the end of these
English writers; because that is <HI>his</HI> place, when considered
as an author. It may safely be affirmed, that the mediocrity
of James's talent in literature, joined to the great change in
national taste, is the chief cause of that contempt under
which his memory labours, and which is often carried by
party-writers to a great extreme. 'Tis remarkable, how
different from ours were the sentiments of the antients with
regard to learning. Of the first twenty Roman emperors,
counting from Caesar to Severus, above the half were au∣thors;
and tho' few of them seem to have been eminent in
that profession, it is always remarked to their praise, that,
by their example, they encouraged literature. Not to men∣tion
Germanicus, and his daughter Agrippina, persons so
nearly allied to the throne, the greater part of the classic
writers, whose works remain, were men of the highest qua∣lity.
As every human advantage is attended with inconve∣niences
the change <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ideas in this particular may
probably be ascribed to the invention of printing; which
has rendered books so common, that men even of slender
fortunes can have access to them.</P>
<P>THAT James was but a middling writer may be allowed:
That he was a contemptible one can by no means be ad∣mitted.
Whoever will read his Basilicon Doron, particularly
the two last books, the true law of free monarchies, his an∣swer
to Cardinal Perron, and almost all his speeches and mes∣sages
to parliament, will confess him to have possessed no
mean genius. If he wrote concerning witches and appari∣tions;
who, in that age, did not admit the reality of these
fictitious beings? If he has composed a commentary on the
Revelations, and proved the Pope to be Antichrist; may
not a similar reproach be extended to the famous Napier;

and even to Newton, at a time when learning was much
more advanced than during the reign of James? From the
grossness of its superstitions, we may infer the ignorance of
an age; but never should pronounce concerning the folly of
an individual, from his admitting popular errors, consecrated
with the appearance of religion.</P>
<P>SUCH a superiority do the pursuits of literature possess
above every other occupation, that even he, who attains but
a mediocrity in them, merits the pre-eminence above those
who excel the most in the common and vulgar professions.
The speaker of the house of commons is usually an eminent
man; yet the harangue of his Majesty we shall always find
much superior to that of the speaker, in every parliament
during this reign.</P>
<P>EVERY science, as well as polite literature, must be con∣sidered
as being yet in its infancy. Scholastic learning and
polemical divinity retarded the growth of all true knowlege.
Sir Henry Saville, in the preamble of that deed by which
he annexed a salary to the mathematical and astronomical
professors in Oxford, says, that geometry was almost totally
abandoned and unknown in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xvii. p. 217.</NOTE>. The best learning
of that age was the study of the antients. Casaubon, emi∣nent
for this knowlege, was invited over from France by
James, and encouraged by a pension of 300 a year, as well
as by church preferments<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 709.</NOTE>. The famous Antonio di Do∣minis,
Archbishop of Spalato, no despicable philosopher,
came likewise into England; and afforded great triumph to
the nation, by their gaining so considerable a proselyte from
the papists. But the mortification followed soon after. For
the Archbishop, tho' advanced to some ecclesiastical prefer∣ments<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 95.</NOTE>,
received not encouragement sufficient to satisfy his
ambition, and he made his escape into Italy, where soon after
he died in confinement.</P>

<P>NO sooner had Charles taken into his hands the
reins of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27 March.</NOTE> than he showed an impa∣tience
to assemble the great council of the nation;
and he would gladly, for the sake of dispatch, have called
together the same parliament which had sat under his father,
and which lay at that time under prorogation. But being
told that this measure would appear unusual, he issued writs
for the summoning a new parliament on the 7th of May;
and it was not without regret that the arrival of the Prin∣cess
Henrietta,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parliment at Westmin∣ster.</NOTE> whom he had espoused by proxy, obliged
him to delay, by repeated prorogations, their meeting till
the eighteenth of June,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th June.</NOTE> when they assembled at Westminster
for the dispatch of business. The young Prince, unexpe∣rienced
and impolitic, regarded as sincere all the praises and
caresses with which he had been loaded, while active in pro∣curing
the rupture with the house of Austria. And besides
that he laboured under great necessities, he hastened with
alacrity to a period, when he might receive the most un∣doubted
testimonies of the dutiful attachment of his sub∣jects.
His discourse to the parliament was full of simplicity
<PB N="138" REF="170"/>
and cordiality.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. L</NOTE> He lightly mentioned the occasion which he
had for supply<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 171. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 346. Franklyn, p. 108.</NOTE>. He employed no intrigue to influence the
suffrages of the members. He would not even allow the
officers of the crown, who had seats in the house, to men∣tion
any particular sum which might be expected by him.
Secure of the affections of the commons, he was resolved
that their bounty should be intirely their own deed; un∣asked,
unsolicited; the genuine fruit of sincere confidence
and regard.</P>
<P>THE house of commons accordingly took into considera∣tion
the business of supply. They knew that all the money
granted by the last parliament had been expended on naval
and military armaments; and that great anticipations were
likewise made on the revenues of the crown. They were
not ignorant that Charles was loaded with a large debt, con∣tracted
by his father, who had borrowed money both from
his own subjects and from foreign princes. They had
learned by experience, that the public revenues could with
difficulty maintain the dignity of the crown, even under the
ordinary charges of government. They were sensible that
the present war was, very lately, the result of their own
importunate applications and entreaties, and that they had
solemnly engaged to support their sovereign in the manage∣ment
of it. They were acquainted with the difficulty of
military enterprizes, directed against the whole house of
Austria; against the King of Spain, possessed of the greatest
riches and most extensive dominions of any prince in Eu∣rope;
against the Emperor Ferdinand, hitherto the most
fortunate monarch of his age, who had subdued and asto∣nished
Germany by the rapidity of his victories. Deep im∣pressions,
they saw, must be made by the English sword,
and a vigorous offensive war be waged against these mighty
potentates, ere they would resign a principality, which they
had now fully subdued, and which they held in secure pos∣session
<PB N="139" REF="171"/>
by its being surrounded with all their other terri∣tories.</P>
<P>To answer, therefore, all these great and important ends;
to satisfy their young King in the first request which he made
them; to prove their sense of the many royal virtues, par∣ticularly
oeconomy, with which Charles was endued; the
house of commons, conducted by the wisest and ablest se∣nators
that had ever flourished in England, thought proper
to confer on the King a supply of two subsidies, amounting
to 112,000 pounds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A subsidy was now fallen to about 56,000 pounds. Cabbala, p. 224. first edit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS measure, which discovers rather a cruel mockery
of Charles, than any serious design of supporting him, ap∣pears
so extraordinary, when considered in all its circum∣stances,
that it naturally summons up our attention, and
raises an inquiry concerning the causes of a conduct unpre∣cedented
in an English parliament. So numerous an assem∣bly,
composed of persons of various dispositions, were not,
'tis probable, all influenced by the same motives; and few
declared openly their true reason. We shall, therefore, ap∣proach
nearer the truth, if we mention all the views which
the present conjuncture could suggest to them.</P>
<P>IT is not to be doubted, but spleen and ill-will against
the Duke of Buckingham had a great influence with many.
So vast and rapid a fortune, so little merited, could not fail
to excite public envy; and, however men's hatred might
have been suspended for a moment, while the Duke's con∣duct
seemed to gratify their passions and their prejudices, it
was impossible for him long to preserve the affections of the
people. His influence over the modesty of Charles exceeded
even that which he had acquired over the weakness of James;
nor was any public measure conducted but by his counsel
and direction. His impetuous temper prompted him to
<PB N="140" REF="172"/>
raise suddenly, to the highest elevation, his flatterers and
dependents: And, upon the least occasion of displeasure,
he threw them down with equal fury and violence. Impla∣cable
in his hatred; fickle in his friendships: All men were
either regarded as his enemies, or dreaded soon to become
such. The whole power of the kingdom was grasped by
his infatiable hand; while he both engrossed the intire con∣fidence
of his master, and held, invested in his single per∣son,
the most considerable offices of the crown.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the ill humour of the commons might have
been increased by these considerations, we are not to sup∣pose
them the sole motives. The last parliament of James,
amidst all their joy and festivity, had given him a supply
very disproportioned to his demand and to the occasion.
And, as every house of commons, which was elected during
forty years, succeeded to all the passions and principles of
their predecessors; we ought rather to account for this ob∣stinacy
from the general situation of the kingdom during
that whole period, than from any circumstances which
attended this immediate conjuncture.</P>
<P>THE nation were very little accustomed at that time to
the burthen of taxes, and had never opened their purses
in any degree for the supplying their sovereign. Even Eli∣zabeth,
notwithstanding her vigour and frugality, and the
necessary wars in which she was engaged, had great reason
to complain of the commons in this particular; nor could
the authority of that Princess, which was otherwise almost
absolute, ever extort from them the requisite supplies of
money. Habits, more than reason, we find, in every thing,
to be the governing principle of mankind. In this view like∣wise
the sinking of the value of subsidies must be considered
as a loss to the King. The parliament, swayed by custom,
would not augment their number in the same proportion.</P>
<P>THE puritanical party, tho' disguised, had a very great
authority over the kingdom; and many of the leaders among
<PB N="141" REF="173"/>
the commons had secretly embraced the rigid tenets of that
sect. All these were disgusted with the court, both by
the prevalence of the principles of civil liberty, essential to
their party, and on account of the restraint under which
they were held by the established hierarchy. In order to
fortify himself against the refentment of James, Buckingham
had affected popularity, and entered into the cabals of the
puritans: But, being secure of the confidence of Charles,
he had since abandoned that party; and, on that account,
was the more exposed to their hatred and resentment. Tho'
the religious schemes of many of the puritans, when ex∣plained,
appear pretty frivolous, we are not thence to ima∣gine,
that they were pursued by none but persons of weak
understanding. Some men of the greatest parts and most
extensive knowlege, whom the nation, at that time, pro∣duced,
could not enjoy any peace of mind; because obliged
to hear prayers offered up to the Divinity, by a priest, co∣vered
with a white linen vestment.</P>
<P>THE match with France, and the articles in favour of catho∣lics,
which were suspected to be in the treaty, were likewise
causes of disgust to this whole party: Tho' it must be re∣marked,
that the alliance with that crown was infinitely less
obnoxious to the protestants, and less favourable to the catho∣lics,
than that formerly projected with Spain, and was
therefore received rather with pleasure than dissatisfaction.</P>
<P>To all these causes we must yet add another, of consi∣derable
moment. The house of commons, we may observe,
were almost intirely governed by a set of men of the most
uncommon capacity and the largest views: Men, who were
now formed into a regular party, and united, as well by fix∣ed
aims and projects, as by the hardships which some of
them had undergone in prosecution of them. Among these
we may mention the names of Sir Edward Coke, Sir Edwin
Sandys, Sir Robert Philips, Sir Francis Seymour, Sir Dud∣ley Digges,
Sir John Elliot, Sir Thomas Wentworth, Mr.
<PB N="142" REF="174"/>
Selden, Mr. Pym. Animated with a warm regard to liberty,
these generous patriots saw with regret an unbounded power
exercised by the crown, and were resolved to seize the op∣portunity,
which the King's necessities offered them, of re∣ducing
the prerogative within more reasonable compass.
Tho' their ancestors had blindly given way to practices and
precedents favourable to kingly power, and had been able,
notwithstanding, to preserve some small remains of liberty;
it would be impossible, they thought, when all these pre∣tensions
were methodized and prosecuted by the increasing
knowlege of the age, to maintain any shadow of popular
government, in opposition to such unlimited authority in
the sovereign. It was necessary to fix a choice: Either to
abandon intirely the privileges of the people, or to secure
them by firmer and more precise barriers than the constitu∣tion
had hitherto provided for them. In this dilemma, men
of such aspiring genius and such independent fortunes could
not long deliberate: They boldly embraced the side of
freedom, and resolved to grant no supplies to their necessi∣tous
Prince, without extorting concessions in favour of civil
liberty. The end, they esteemed beneficent and noble:
The means, regular and constitutional. To grant or refuse
supplies was the undoubted privilege of the commons. And
as all human governments, particularly those of a mixed
frame, are in continual fluctuation; it was as natural, in
their opinion, and allowable, for popular assemblies to take
advantage of favourable incidents, in order to secure the
subjects; as for monarchs, in order to extend their own
authority. With pleasure, they beheld the King involved
in a foreign war, which rendered him every day more de∣pendent
on the parliament; while at the same time the situa∣tion
of the kingdom, even without any military prepara∣tions,
gave it sufficient security against all invasion from
foreigners. And perhaps, it had partly proceeded from ex∣pectations
of this nature, that the popular leaders had been
so urgent for a rupture with Spain; nor is it credible, that
<PB N="143" REF="175"/>
religious zeal could so far have blinded all of them as to
make them discover, in such a measure, any appearance of
necessity, or any hopes of success.</P>
<P>BUT, however natural all these sentiments might appear
to the country-party, it is not to be imagined that Charles
would entertain the same ideas. Strongly prejudiced in
favour of the Duke, whom he had heard so highly extolled
in parliament, he could not conjecture the cause of so sud∣den
an alteration in their opinions. And when the war,
which they themselves had so earnestly solicited, was at last
commenced, the immediate desertion of their sovereign could
not but seem very strange and unaccountable. Even tho'
no farther motive had been suspected, the refusal of supply,
in such circumstances, would naturally to him appear cruel
and deceitful: But when he perceived that this measure
proceeded from an intention of encroaching on his authority,
he failed not to regard these aims as highly criminal and
traiterous. Those losty ideas of monarchical power, which
were very commonly adopted during that age, and to which
the ambiguous nature of the English constitution gave so
plausible an appearance, were firmly rivetted in Charles;
and however moderate his temper, the natural and unavoid∣able
prepossessions of self-love, joined to the late uniform
precedents in favour of prerogative, had made him conceive
his political tenets as certain and uncontroverted. Taught
to regard even the antient laws and constitution more as
lines to direct his conduct than barriers to withstand his
power; a conspiracy to erect new ramparts, in order to
straiten his authority, appeared but one degree removed
from open sedition and rebellion. So atrocious in his eyes
was such a design, that he seems even unwilling to impute
it to the commons: And,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th July.</NOTE> tho' he was obliged to adjourn
the parliament by reason of the plague, which at that time
raged in London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st of Aug.</NOTE> he immediately re-assembled them at
<PB N="144" REF="176"/>
Oxford, and made a new attempt to gain from them some
supplies in such an urgent necessity.</P>
<P>CHARLES now found himself obliged to depart from
that delicacy which he had formerly maintained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament at Oxford.</NOTE> By him∣self
or his ministers, he entered into a particular detail, both
of the alliances which he had formed, and of the military
operations which he had projected<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 25, 26.</NOTE> He told the parlia∣ment,
That, by a promise of subsidies, he had engaged
the King of Denmark to take part in the war; that that
monarch intended to enter Germany by the north, and to
rouze to war those princes, who impatiently longed for an
opportunity of asserting the liberty of the empire; that
Mansfeldt had undertaken to penetrate with an English army
into the Palatinate, and by that quarter to excite the mem∣bers
of the evangelical union; that the states must be sup∣ported
in the unequal warfare which they maintained with
Spain; that no less a sum than 700,000 pounds a year had
been found, by computation, requisite for all these pur∣poses;
that the maintenance of the fleet and the defence of
Ireland demanded an annual expence of 400,000 pounds;
that he himself had already exhausted and anticipated, in
the public service, his whole revenue, and had scarce left
sufficient for the daily subsistence of himself and of his
family<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 396.</NOTE>; that, on his accession to the crown, he found a
debt of above 300,000 pounds, contracted by his father,
in support of the Palatine; and that, while Prince of
Wales, he had himself contracted debts, notwithstanding
his great frugality, to the amount of 70,000 pounds, which
he had expended intirely on naval and military armaments.
After mentioning all these facts, the King even condescended
to use entreaties. He said, that this request was the first
which he had ever made them: that he was young and in the
commencement of his reign; and, if he now met with
<PB N="145" REF="177"/>
kind and dutiful usage, it would endear to him the use of
parliaments, and would for ever preserve an intire harmony
between him and his people<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 177, 178, &amp;c. Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 399. Frank∣lyn, r. 108, 109. Journ. 10 Aug, 1625.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To these reasons the commons remained inexorable. Not∣withstanding
that the King's measures, on the supposition of
a foreign war, which they had constantly demanded, were al∣together
unexceptionable, they obstinately refused any far∣ther
assistance. Some members, favourable to the court,
having insisted on an addition of two fifteenths to the former
supply, even this pittance was refused<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 190.</NOTE> tho' it was known,
that a fleet and army were lying at Portsmouth, in great
want of pay and provisions; and that Buckingham, the
admiral, and the treasurer of the navy, had advanced on
their own credit near an hundred thousand pounds for the
sea-service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 390.</NOTE>. Besides all their other motives, the house of
commons had made a new discovery, which, as they wanted
but a pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence for their refusal, inflamed them against the
court and against the Duke of Buckingham.</P>
<P>WHEN James deserted the Spanish alliance, and courted
that of France, he had promised to furnish Louis, who
was intirely destitute of naval force, with one ship of
war, and seven armed vessels, hired from the merchants.
These the French court had pretended they would em∣ploy
against the Genoese, who, being firm and use∣ful
allies to the Spanish monarchy, were naturally re∣garded
with an evil eye, both by the King of France and
of England. When these vessels, by Charles's orders, ar∣rived
at Diepe, there arose a strong suspicion that they were
to serve against Rochelle. The sailors were enflamed. That
race of men, who are at present both careles and ignorart
in all matters of religion, were at that time only ignorant.
They drew up a remonstrance to Pennington, their com∣mander;
and, signing all their names in a circle, left he
should discover the ring-leaders, they laid it under his
<PB N="146" REF="178"/>
prayer-book. Pennington declared, that he would rather
be hanged in England for disobedience, than fight against
his brother-protestants in France. The whole squadron
failed immediately to the Downs. There they received new
orders from Buckingham, lord admiral, to return to Diepe.
As the Duke knew that authority alone would not suffice,
he employed much art and many subtilities to engage them
to obedience; and a rumour, which was spread, that peace
had been concluded between the French King and the hu∣gonots,
assisted him in his purpose. When they arrived at
Diepe, they found that they had been deceived. Sir Ferdi∣nando
Gorges, who commanded one of the vessels, broke
thro' and returned to England. All the officers and sailors
of all the other ships, notwithstanding great offers made
them by the French, immediately deserted. One gunner
alone preferred duty towards his King to the cause of reli∣gion;
and he was afterwards killed in charging a cannon before Rochelle<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 109. Rush. vol. i. p. 175, 176, &amp;c. 325, 326, &amp;c.</NOTE> The care which historians have taken
to record this frivolous event, shows with what pleasure the
news was received by the whole nation.</P>
<P>THE house of commons, when informed of these trans∣actions,
showed the same attachment with the sailors for the
protestant religion; nor was their zeal much better guided
by reason and found policy. It was not considered, that,
if the force of Spain was really so exorbitant as they ima∣gined,
the French monarch was the only prince who could
oppose its progress, and preserve the balance of Europe;
that his power was at present fettered by the hugonots,
who, being possessed of many privileges and even of forti∣fied
towns, formed an empire within his empire, and kept
him in perpetual jealousy and inquietude; that an insurrec∣tion
had been at that time wantonly and voluntarily formed
by their leaders, who, being disgusted in some court-intrigue,
took advantage of the never-failing pretence of religion, in
<PB N="147" REF="179"/>
order to cover their rebellion; that the Dutch, influenced
by these views, had ordered a squadron of twenty ships to
join the French fleet, employed against the inhabitants of
Rochelle<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 18 April 1626.</NOTE> that the Spanish monarch, sensible of the same
consequences, secretly supported the protestants in France;
and that all princes had ever sacrificed to reasons of state the
interest of their religion in foreign countries. All these ob∣vious
considerations had no influence. Great murmurs and
discontents still prevailed in parliament. The hugonots,
tho' they had no ground of complaint against the French
court, were thought to be as much intitled to assistance
from England, as if they had taken arms in defence of their
liberties and religion against the persecuting rage of the ca∣tholics.
And i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plainly appears from this incident, as well
as from many others, that, of all European nations, the
British were at that time, and till long after, the most under
the influence of that religious spirit, which tends rather to
inflame bigotry than increase peace and mutual charity.</P>
<P>ON this occasion, the commons renewed their eternal
complaints against the growth of popery, which was ever
the chief of their grievances, and now their only one<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>
They demanded a strict execution of the penal laws against
the catholics, and remonstrated against some late pardons
which had been granted to priests<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Parl, Hist. vol. vi. p. 374. Journ. 1 Aug. 1625.</NOTE>. They attacked Mon∣tague,
one of the King's chaplains, on account of a mode∣rate
book which he had lately composed, and which, to
their great disgust, saved virtuous catholics, as well as other
christians, from eternal torments<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 353. Journ. 7 July 1625.</NOTE>. Charles gave them a
gracious and a compliant answer to all their remonstrances.
He was, however, in his heart, extremely averse to these
furious measures. Tho' a determined protestant, by prin∣ciple
as well as inclination, he had entertained no violent
<PB N="148" REF="180"/>
horror against popery; and a little humanity, he thought,
was due by the nation to the religion of their ancestors.
That degree of liberty, which is now indulged to catholics,
tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> party much more obnoxious than during the reign of
the Stuarts, it suited neither with Charles's sentiments, nor
the humour of the age, to allow them. An abatement of
the more rigorous laws was all he intended; and his engage∣ments
with France, notwithstanding that their regular exe∣cution
had never been proposed nor expected, required of
him some indulgence. But so unfortunate was this Prince,
that no measure, embraced during his whole reign, was ever
attended with more unhappy and more fatal consequences.</P>
<P>THE extreme rage against popery was a sure characteristic
of puritanism. This house of commons discovered other
infallible symptoms of the prevalence of that party. They
petitioned the King for replacing such able clergy as had
been silenced for want of conformity to the ceremonies<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 281</NOTE>.
They also enacted laws for the strict observance of Sunday,
which the puritans affected to call the Sabbath, and which
they sanctified by the most melancholy indolence<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Car. I. cap. 1. Journ. 21 June 1625.</NOTE> 'Tis
to be remarked, that the different appellations of this festi∣val
were at that time known symbols of the different par∣ties.</P>
<P>THE King, finding that the parliament were resolved to
grant him no supply, and would furnish him with nothing
but empty protestations of duty<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 113. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 190.</NOTE> or disagreeable com∣plaints

<P>To supply the want of parliamentary aids,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 12,</NOTE> Charles issued

10,000 men. Sir Edward Cecil, lately created Viscount
Wimbleton, was entrusted with the command. He sailed
immediately for Cadiz, and found the bay full of Spanish ships
of great value. He either neglected to attack these ships,
or attempted it preposterously. The army was landed, and
a fort taken: But the undisciplined soldiers, finding store
of wine, could not be restrained from the utmost excesses.
Farther stay appearing fruitless, they were re-imbarked;
and the fleet put to sea with an intention of waiting for the
Spanish galleons. But the plague having seized the seamen
and soldiers, they were obliged to abandon all hopes of this
prize, and return to England. Loud complaints were made
against the court for entrusting so important a command to
a man like Cecil, whom, tho' he possessed-great experience,
the people, judging by the event, esteemed of very slender
capacity<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Frank∣lyn, p. 113.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1626.</NOTE> having failed of so rich a prize, was obliged
again to have recourse to a parliament. Tho' the ill suc∣cess
of his enterprizes diminished his authority, and showed
every day more plainly the imprudence of the Spanish war;
tho' the increase of his necessities, rendered him more de∣pendent,
and more exposed to the encroachments of the
commons; he was resolved to try once more that regular
and constitutional expedient for supply. Perhaps too, a
little political art, which at that time he practised, was
<PB N="150" REF="182"/>
much trusted to. He had named four popular leaders she∣riffs
of counties; Sir Edward Coke, Sir Robert Philips,
Sir Thomas Wentworth, Sir Francis Seymour; and tho'
this question had been formerly much contested<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is always an express clause in the writ of summons, that no sheriff shall be chosen; but the contrary practice had often prevailed. D'Ewes, p. 38. Yet still great doubts were entertained on this head. See Journ. 9 April 1614.</NOTE> he thought
that he had by that means incapacitated them for being
elected members. But this intention, being so evident, ra∣ther
put the commons more upon their guard. Enow of pa∣triots
still remained to keep up the ill humour of the house;
and men needed but little instruction or rhetoric to recom∣mend
to them practices which increased their own import∣ance
and consideration. The weakness of the court also
could not more evidently appear, than by its being reduced
to so ineffectual an expedient, in order to obtain an influence
over the commons.</P>
<P>THE views,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 6.</NOTE> therefore, of the last parliament were im∣mediately
adopted; as if the same men had been every∣where
elected, and no time had intervened since their last
meeting. When the King laid before the house his necess∣ties,
and asked for supply, they immediately voted him three
subsidies and three fifteenths; and tho' they afterwards added
one subsidy more, the sum was little proportioned to the
greatness of the occasion, and ill fitted to promote those views
of success and glory, for which the young Prince, in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
first enterprize, so ardently longed. But this circumstance
was not the most disagreeable one. The supply was only
voted by the commons. The passing that vote into a law
was reserved till the end of the session<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Journ, 27 Mar. 1626.</NOTE>. A condition was
thereby made, in a very undisguised manner, with their so∣vereign.
Under colour of redressing grievances, which,
during this short reign, could not be very numerous; they
were to proceed in regulating and controuling every part of
government which displeased them: And if the King either
<PB N="151" REF="183"/>
cut them short in this undertaking, or refused compliance
with their demands, he must lay his account with the want
of all supply. Great dissatisfaction was expressed by Charles
with a method of treatment which he deemed so harsh and
undutiful<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Parliamentary History, vol. vi. p. 449. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 224.</NOTE>. But his urgent necessities obliged him to sub∣mit;
and he waited with patience, observing to what side
they would turn themselves.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impeach∣ment of Bucking∣ham.</NOTE> formerly obnoxious to the
public, became every day more odious, by the symptoms
which appeared both of his want of temper and prudence,
and of the uncontrouled ascendant which he had acquired
over his matter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His credit with the King had given him such influence, that he had no less than twenty proxies granted him this parliament by so many peers; which occasioned a vote, that no peer should have above two proxies. The earl of Leicester in 1585 had once ten proxies. D'Ewes, p. 314.</NOTE>. Two violent attacks he was obliged
this session to sustain; one from the Earl of Bristol, another
from the house of commons.</P>
<P>As long as James lived, Bristol, secure of the concealed
favour of that monarch, had expressed all duty and obe∣dience;
in expectation that an opportunity would offer of
re-instating himself in his former credit and authority.
Even after Charles's accession, he despaired not. He sub∣mitted
to the King's order of remaining in his country-feat,
and of absenting himself from parliament. Many trials he
made to regain the good opinion of his master; but finding
them all fruitless and observing Charles to be intirely go∣verned
by Buckingham, his implacable enemy, he resolved
no longer to keep any measures with the court. A new
spirit, he saw, and a new power, arising in the nation; and
to these he was resolved for the future to trust for his secu∣rity
and protection.</P>
<P>WHEN the parliament was summoned, Charles, by a
stretch of prerogative, had given orders that no writ, as is
<PB N="150" REF="184"/>

customary, should be sent of Bristol<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 236.</NOTE>. That nobleman ap∣plied
to the house of lords by petition; and crayed their
good offices with the King for obtaining what was his due
as a peer of the realm. His writ was sent him; but accom∣panied
with a letter from the lord keeper, Coventry, com∣manding
him, in the King's name, to absent himself from
parliament. This letter Bristol conveyed to the lords, and
asked advice how to proceed in so delicate a situation<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 237. Franklyn, p. 120, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
The King's prohibition was withdrawn, and Bristol took
his feat. Provoked at these repeated instances of vigour,
which the court denominated contumacy, Charles ordered
his attorney-general to enter an accusation of high treason
against him. By way of recrimination, Bristol impeached
Buckingham of high treason. The Earl's defence of him∣self
and accusation of the Duke both remain<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 256, 262, 263, &amp;c Frank∣lyn, p. 123, &amp;c.</NOTE>; and toge∣ther
with some original letters still exant, contain the fullest
and most authentic account of all the negotiations with the
house of Austria. From the whole, the great imprudence
of the Duke evidently appears, and the sway of his ungo∣vernable
passions; but it would be difficult to collect thence any action which in the eye of the law could be deemed a
crime; much less could subject him to the penalty of high
treason.</P>
<P>THE impeachment of the commons was still less dangerous
to the Duke, were it estimated by the standard of law and
equity. The house, after having voted, upon some que∣ries
of Dr. Turner's, <HI>that common fame was a sufficient
ground of accusation by the commons</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. i. p. 217, Whitlocke, p. 5.</NOTE>, proceeded to frame
regular articles against Buckingham. They accused him,
of having united many offices in his person; of having
bought two of them; of neglecting to guard the seas, in∣fomuch
that many merchant-ships had fallen into the hands
of the enemy; of delivering ships to the French King, in
<PB N="153" REF="187"/>
order to serve against the hugonots; of being employed in
the sale of honours and offices; of accepting extensive
grants from the crown; of procuring many titles of honour
for his kindred; of administring physic to the late King
without acquainting his physicians. All these articles ap∣pear,
from comparing the accusation and reply, to be either
frivolous or false, or both<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rushworth vol. i. p. 306, &amp;c. 375, &amp;c. Journ. 25 March 1626.</NOTE>. The only charge, which could
be regarded as important, was, that he had extorted a sum
of ten thousand pounds from the East-India company, and
that he had confiscated some goods belonging to French
merchants, on pretence of their being the property of Spa∣nish.
The impeachment never came to a full determina∣tion;
so that it is difficult for us to give a decisive opinion
with regard to these articles: But it must be confessed, that
the Duke's; answer in these particulars, as in all the rest, is
so clear and satisfactory, that it is impossible to refuse our
assent to it<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 7.</NOTE>. His faults and blemishes were in many re∣spect
very great; but rapacity and avarice were vice with
which he was intirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>'TIS remarkable that the commons, tho' so much at a
loss to find articles of charge against Buckingham, never
adopted Bristol's accusation, or impeached the Duke for his
conduct in the Spanish treaty, the most blameable circum∣stance
of his whole life. He had reason to believe the Spa∣niards
sincere in their professions yet, in order to gratify
his private passions, he had hurried his master and his coun∣try
into a war pernicious to the interests of both. But so
riveted throughout the nation were the prejudices with re∣gard
to Spanish deceit and falshood, that very few of the
commons seem as yet to have been convinced that they had
been seduced by Buckingham's narrative: A certain proof
that a discovery of this nature was not, as is imagined by
<PB N="154" REF="188"/>
several historians, the cause of so sudden and surprising a
variation in the measures of the parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By a speech of Sir Simon D'Ewes, in the first year of the long parlia∣ment, it clearly appears, that the nation never had, even to that time, been rightly instructed in the transactions of the Spanish negotiation, and still believed the court of Madrid to have been altogether insincere in all their pro∣fessions. What reason, upon that supposition, had they to blance either the Prince or Buckingham for their conduct, or for the narrative delivered to the parliament? This is a capital fact, and ought to be well attended to. D'Ewes's speech is in Nalson, vol. ii. p. 368. No author or historian of that age mentions the discovery of Buckingham's impostures as a cause of disgust in the parliament. Whitlocke, p. 1. only says, that the commons began to suspect, <HI>that it had been spleen in Buckingham,</HI> not zeal for public good, <HI>which bad induced him to break the Spanish match:</HI> A clear proof that his falshood was not suspected. Wilson, p. 780, says, that Buckingham lost his popularity after Bristol arrived, not because that nobleman discovered the falf∣hood of his narrative, but because he proved that Buckingham, while in Spain, had prosessed himself a papist; which is false, and which was never said by Bristol. In all the debates which remain, not the least hint is ever given, that any falshood was suspected in the narrative. I shall farther add, that even if the parliament had discovered the deceit in Buckingham's narra∣tive, this ought not to have altered their political measures, or made them re∣fuse supply to the King. They had supposed it practicable to wrest the Pala∣tinate from the house of Austria; they had represented it as prudent to ex∣pend the blood and treasure of the nation on such an enterprize; they had believed that the King of Spain never had any sincere intention of reftoring that principality. 'Tis certain that he had not now any such intention: And tho' there was reason to suspect, that this alteration of his views had proceed∣ed from the ill conduct of Buckingham, yet past errors could not be retrieved; and the nation was undoubtedly in the same situation, which the parliament had ever supposed, when they so much harassed their sovereign, by their impatient, importunate, and even undutiful solicitations. To which we may add, that Charles himself was certainly deceived by Buckingham, when he corroborated his favourite's narrative by his testimony. Party historians are somewhat inconsistent in their representations of these transactions: They represent the Spaniards as totally insincere, that they may reproach James with credulity in being so long deceived by them: They represent them as sincere, that they may reproach the King, the Prince, and the Duk, with falshood in their narrative to the parliament. The truth is, they were in∣sincere at first; but the reasons, proceeding from bigotry, were not suspe&amp;cted by James, and were at last overcome. They became sincere; but the Prince, deceived by the many unavoidable causes of delay, believed that they were still deceiving him.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="189"/>
WHILE the commons were thus warmly engaged against
Buckingham, the King seemed desirous of embracing every
opportunity by which he could express a contempt and
disregard for them. No one was at that time sufficiently
sensible of the great weight which the commons bore in
the balance of the constitution. The history of England
had never hitherto afforded an instance, where any great
movement or revolution had proceeded from the lower
house. And as their rank, both considered in a body and
as individuals, was but the second in the kingdom; nothing
less than fatal experience could engage the English princes to
pay a due regard to the inclinations of that formidable as∣sembly.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Suffolk, chancellor of the university of
Cambridge, dying about this time, Buckingham, tho' lying
under impeachment, was yet, by means of court-interest,
chosen in his place. The commons resented and loudly
complained of this affront; and the more to enrage them,
the King himself wrote a letter to the university, extolling
the Duke, and giving them thanks for his election<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 371.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lord keeper, in the King's name, commanded the
house expresly not to meddle with his minister and servant,
Buckingham; and ordered them to finish in a few days the
bill which they had begun for the subsidies, and to make
some addition to them; otherwise they must expect to sit no
longer<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. vi. p. 444.</NOTE>. And tho' these harsh commands were endeavoured
to be explained and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollified, a few days afterwards, by a
speech of Buckingham<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Parliam. Hist. vol. vi. p. 451. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 225. Franklyn, p. 118.</NOTE>, they failed not to leave a very
disagreeable impression behind them.</P>
<P>BESIDES a more stately style which Charles in general
affected to this parliament than to the last, he went so far, in
a message, as to threaten the commons, that if they did not
<PB N="156" REF="190"/>
furnish him with supplies, he would be obliged to try <HI>new
councils.</HI> This language was sufficiently clear: Yet, lest
any ambiguity should remain, Sir Dudley Carleton, vice∣chamberlain,
took care to explain it.
“I pray you con∣sider,”
said he, “what these new councils are or may
be. I fear to declare those that I conceive. In all chris∣tian
kingdoms, you know that parliaments were in use
antiently, by which those kingdoms were governed in a
most flourishing manner; until the monarchs began to
know their own strength, and, seeing the turbulent spirit
of their parliaments, at length they, by little and little,
began to stand on their prerogatives, and at last over∣threw
the parliaments, throughout Christendom, except
here only with us.—Let us be careful then to pre∣serve
the King's good opinion of parliaments, which
bringeth such happiness to this nation, and makes us en∣vied
of all others, while there is this sweetness between
his Majesty and the commons; lest we lose the repute of
a free people by our turbulency in parliament<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 359. Whitlocke, p. 6.</NOTE>.” These
imprudent suggestions rather gave warning than struck ter∣ror.
A precarious liberty, the commons thought, which
was to be preserved by unlimited complaisance, was no liberty
at all. And it was necessary, while yet in their power, to
secure the constitution by such invincible barriers, that no
king or minister should ever for the future, dare to speak
such a language to any parliament, or even to entertain such
a project against them.</P>
<P>Two members of the house, Sir Dudley Digges and Sir
John Elliott, who had been employed as managers of the
impeachment against the Duke, were thrown into prison<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 356.</NOTE>.
The commons immediately declared, that they would pro∣ceed
no farther upon business till they had satisfaction in
their privileges. Charles alleged, as the reason of this vio∣lent
measure, certain seditious expressions, which, he said,
<PB N="157" REF="191"/>
had, in their accusation of the Duke, dropped from these
members. Upon inquiry, it appeared, that no such ex∣pressions
had been used<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 358, 361. Franklyn, p. 180.</NOTE>. The members were released;
and the King reaped no farther benefit from this attempt,
tham to exasperate the house still farther, and to show some
degree of precipitancy and indiscretion.</P>
<P>MOVED by this example, the house of peers were roused
from their inactivity; and claimed liberty for the Earl of
Arundel, who had been lately confined in the Tower.
After many fruitless evasions, the King, tho' somewhat
ungracefully, was at last obliged to comply<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 363, 364, &amp;c. Franklyn, p. 181.</NOTE>. And in this
incident, it sufficiently appeared, that the lords, however
little inclined to popular courses, were not wanting in a just
sense of their own dignity.</P>
<P>THE ill humour of the commons, thus wantonly irritated
by the court, and finding no gratification in the legal im∣peachment
of Buckingham, sought other materials on which
it might exert itself. The never-failing cry of popery here
served them in stead. They again claimed the execution of
the penal laws against catholics; and they presented to the
King a list of persons, entrusted with offices, most of them
insignificant, who were either convicted or suspected recu∣sants<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 195. Rushworth.</NOTE>.
In this particular, they had, perhaps, some reason
to blame the King's conduct. He had promised to the last
house of commons a redress of this religious grievance:
But he was apt, in imitation of his father, to imagine, that
the parliament, when they failed of supplying his necessi∣ties,
had, on their part, freed him from the obligation of a
strict performance. A new odium, likewise, by these re∣presentations,
was attempted to be thrown upon Bucking∣ham.
His mother, who had great influence over him, was
a professed catholic; his wife was not free from suspicion:
<PB N="156" REF="192"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="157" REF="193"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="158" REF="194"/>
And the indulgence given to catholics was of course sup∣posed
to proceed intirely from his credit and authority. So
violent was the bigotry of the times, that it was thought a
sufficient reason for disqualifying any one from holding an
office, that his wife or relations, or companions, were pa∣pists,
tho' he himself were a conformist<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">See the list in Franklyn and Rushworth.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, that persecution was here chiefly pushed
on by laymen; and that the church was willing to have
granted more liberty than would be allowed by the commons.
The reconciling doctrines likewise of Montague failed not
anew to meet with severe censures from that zealous as∣sembly<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 209.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE next attack made by the commons, had it pre∣vailed,
would have proved decisive. They were preparing
a remonstrance against the levying of tonnage and poundage
without consent of parliament. This article, together with
the new impositions laid on merchandize by James, consti∣tuted
near a half of the crown-revenues; and by depriving
the King of these resources, they would have reduced him
to total subjection and dependence. While they retained
such a pledge, besides the supply already promised, they were
sure that nothing could be refused them. Tho', after can∣vassing
the matter near three months, they found themselves
utterly incapable of fixing any legal crime upon the Duke,
they justly regarded him as a very unable and even dan∣gerous
minister; and they intended to present a petition,
which would then have been equivalent to a command,
for removing him from his Majesty's person and councils<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 400. Franklyn, p. 199.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was alarmed at the yoke which he saw pre∣pared
for him. Buckingham's great guilt, he thought, was
the being his friend and favourite<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 178.</NOTE>. All the other com∣plaints
against him were mere pretences. A little before,
<PB N="159" REF="195"/>
he was the idol of the people. No new crime had since been
discovered. After the most diligent inquiry, prompted by
the greatest malice, the smallest appearance of guilt could
not be fixed upon him. What idea, he asked, must all
mankind entertain of his honour, should he sacrifice his in∣nocent
friend to pecuniary considerations? What farther
authority would he retain in the nation, were he capable, in
the beginning of his reign, to give, in so signal an instance,
such matter of triumph to his enemies, and discouragement
to his adherents? To-day, the commons pretended to wrest
his minister from him. To-morrow, they would attack
some branch of his prerogative. By their remonstrances,
and promises and protestations, they had engaged the crown
in a war. So soon as they saw a retreat impossible, without
waiting for new incidents, without covering themselves with
new pretences, they immediately deserted him, and refused
him all reasonable supply. It was evident, that they desired
nothing so much as to see him plunged in inextricable diffi∣culties,
of which they intended to take advantage. To such
deep perfidy, to such unbounded usurpations, it was neces∣sary
to oppose a proper firmness and resolution. And any
extremity was preferable to the contempt of subjects, to
the insults of mean adversaries.</P>
<P>PROMPTED by these motives, Charles was determined
immediately to dissolve the parliament. When this resolu∣tion
was known, the house of peers, whose compliant be∣haviour
intitled them to some authority with him, endea∣voured
to interpose<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 398.</NOTE>; and they petitioned him, that he
would allow the parliament to sit some time longer. <HI>Not a
moment longer,</HI> cried the King hastily<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanderson, Life of Charles I. p. 58.</NOTE>; and he soon after
ended this session by a dissolution.</P>
<P>As this measure was foreseen, the commons took care to
finish and disperse their remonstrance, which they intended
<PB N="160" REF="196"/>
as a justification of their conduct to the people.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5th June.</NOTE> The King
likewise, on his part, published a declaration, where he
gave the reasons of his disagreement with the parliament,
and of their sudden dissolution, before they had time to
conclude any one act<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 203, &amp;c. Parl. Hist. vol. vii. p. 300.</NOTE>. These papers furnished the parti∣zans
on both sides with ample matter of apology or of re∣crimination.
But all impartial men judged, “<HI>That</HI> the
commons, tho' they had not violated any law, yet, by
their unpliableness and independence, were insensibly
changing, perhaps improving, the spirit and genius,
while they preserved the forms, of the constitution:
And <HI>that</HI> the King was acting altogether without any
plan; running on in a road surrounded on all sides with
the most dangerous precipices, and concerting no proper
measures, either for submitting to the obstinacy of the
commons, or for subduing it.”</P>
<P>AFTER a breach with the parliament, which seemed so
difficult to repair, the only rational counsel, which Charles
could pursue, was immediately to conclude a peace with
Spain, and to render himself, as far as possible, independent
of his people, who discovered so little inclination to support
him, or rather who seem to have formed a determined reso∣lution
to abridge his authority. Nothing could be more
easy in the execution than this measure, nor more agreeable
to his own and to national interest. But, besides the trea∣ties
and engagements which he had entered into with Hol∣land
and with Denmark, the King's thoughts were at this
time intirely averse to pacific counsels. There are two cir∣cumstances
in Charles's character, seemingly incompatible,
which attended him during the whole course of his reign,
and were in part the cause of all his misfortunes: He was
very steddy and even obstinate in his purpose; and he was
easily governed, by reason of his facility, and of his defer∣ence
to men much inferior to himself both in morals and
<PB N="161" REF="197"/>
understanding. His great ends he inflexibly maintained:
But the means of attaining them, he readily received from
his ministers and favourites; tho' not always fortunate in
his choice. The violent, impetuous Buckingham, inflamed
with a desire of revenge for injuries which he himself had
committed, and animated with a love for glory which he
had not talents to merit, had at this time, notwithstanding
his profuse licentious life, acquired an invincible ascendant
over the virtuous and gentle temper of the King.</P>
<P>THE <HI>new Councils,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Violent measures of the court.</NOTE> which Charles had mentioned to the
parliament, were now to be tried, in order to supply his ne∣cessities.
Had he possessed any military force, on which he
could depend, 'tis not improbable that he had at once taken off
the mask, and governed without any regard to parliamentary pri∣vileges:
So high an idea had he received of kingly preroga∣tive,
and so contemptible a notion of the rights of those popu∣lar
assemblies, from which, he very naturally thought he had
met with such ill usage. But his army was new levied, ill paid,
and worse disciplined; no-wise sperior to the militia, who
were much more numerous, and who were in a great measure
under the influence of the country gentlemen. It behoved him,
therefore, to proceed cautionsly, and to cover his enterprizes
under the pretence of antient precedents, which, considering
the great authority commonly enjoyed by his predecessors,
could not be wanting to him.</P>
<P>A COMMISSION was openly granted to compound with
the catholics, and agree for a dispensation with the penal
laws enacted against them<NOTE N="P" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 413. Whitlocke, P. 7.</NOTE>. By this expedient, the king
both filled his coffers, and gratified his inclination of giving
indulgence to these religionists: But he could not readily
have employed any branch of prerogative, which would
have been more disagreeable, or would have appeared more
exceptionable to his protestant subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="198"/>
FROM the nobility, he desired assistance: From the city,
he required a loan of 100,000 pounds. The former con∣tributed
slowly: But the latter, covering themselves under
many pretences and excuses, gave him at last a flat denial<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 415. Franklyn, p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to equip a fleet, a distribution, by order of the
council, was made to all the maritime towns; and each of
them was required, with the assistance of the adjacent coun∣ties,
to arm so many vessels as were appointed them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rush. ut supra.</NOTE> The
city of London was rated at twenty ships. This is the first
appearance, in Charles's reign, of ship-money; a taxation
which had once been imposed by Elizabeth, but which af∣terwards,
when carried some steps farther, by Charles, cre∣ated
such violent discontents.</P>
<P>OF some, loans were required<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rashworth, vol. i. p. 416.</NOTE>: To others, the way of
benevolence was proposed: Methods supported by prece∣dents,
but always invidious even in times more submissive
and compliant. In the most absolute governments, such
expedients would be regarded as irregular and disorderly.</P>
<P>THESE councils for supply were conducted with some
moderation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th Aug.</NOTE> till news arrived, that a great battle was fought between the King of Denmark and Count Tilly, the impe∣rial general; in which the former was totally defeated. Mo∣ney
now, more than ever, became necessary, in order to
repair so great a breach in the alliance, and to support a
prince who was so nearly related to Charles, and who had
been engaged in the war chiefly by the intrigues, sollicita∣tions,
and promises of the English monarch. After some
deliberation, an act of council was passed, importing, that,
as the urgency of affairs admitted not the way of parlia∣ment,
the most speedy, equal, and convenient method of
supply was by a GENERAL LOAN from the subject, ac∣cording
as every man was assessed in the rolls of the last
subsidy. That precise sum was required, which each would
<PB N="163" REF="199"/>
have paid, had the vote of four subsidies been passed into a
law: But care was taken to inform the people, that the
sums exacted were not to be called subsidies, but loans<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 418. Whitlocke, p. 8.</NOTE>.
Had any doubt remained, that forced loans were a violation
of liberty, and musst, by necessary consequence, render all
parliaments superfluous; this was the proper expedient for
opening the eyes of the whole nation.</P>
<P>THE commissioners appointed to levy these loans, among
other articles of secret instruction, were enjoined, “If
any sall refuse to lend, and shall make delays or excuses,
and persist in his obstinacy, that they examine him upon
oath, whether he has been dealt with to deny or refuse to
lend, or make an excuse for not lending? Who has dealt
with him, and what speeches or persuasions were used to
that purpose? And that they also shall charge every such
person, in his Majesty's name, upon his allegiance, not
to disclose to any one what his answer was<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. P. 419. Franklyn, p. 207.</NOTE>.” So vio∣lent
an inquisitorial power, so impracticable an attempt at
secrecy, were the objects of indignation, and even in some
degree of ridicule.</P>
<P>THAT religious prejudices might support civil authority,
fermons were preached by Sibthorpe and Manwaring, in fa∣vour
of the general loan; and the court very indusrrously
spread them over the kingdom. Passive obedience, was there
recommended in its full extent, the whole authority of the
state was represented as belonging to the King alone, and
all limitations of laws and constutions were rejected as fe∣ditious
and impious<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. i. p. 422. Franklyn, p. 208.</NOTE>. So openly was this doctrine espoused
by the King, that Archbishop Abbot, a popular and virtu∣ous
prelate, because he would not license Sibthorpe's fer∣mon,
was suspended from the exercise of his office, banished
from London, and confined to one of his country-feats<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 431</NOTE>.
Abbot's principles of liberty, and his opposition to Buck∣ingham,
<PB N="164" REF="200"/>
had always rendered him very ungracious at court,
and had acquired him the character of a puritan. For 'tis
remarkable, that that party made the privileges of the na∣tion
as much a part of their religion, as the church-party
did the prerogatives of the crown; and nothing tended
farther to recommend among the people, who always take
opinions in the lump, the whole system and principles, of
the former sect. The King soon found, by fatal experience,
that this engine of religion, which with so little necessity
was introduced into politics, falling under more fortunate
management, was played with the most terrible success
against him.</P>
<P>WHILE the King, instigated by anger and necessity, thus
employed the whole extent of his prerogative, the spirit
of the people was far from being subdued. Throughout
all England, many refused these loans, and some were even
active in encouraging their neighbours to insist upon their
common rights and privileges. By warrant of the council,
<HI>these</HI> were thrown into prison<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 429. Franklyn, p. 210.</NOTE>. Most of them with pa∣tience
submitted to confinement, or applied by petition to
the King, who commonly released them. Five gentlemen
alone, Sir Thomas Darnel, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter
Earl, Sir John Heveningham, and Sir Edmond Hambden,
had spirit enough, at their own hazard and experice, to defend
the public liberties, and to demand releasement, not
as a favour from the court, but as their due, by the laws
of their country<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. i. p. 458. Franklyn, p. 224. Whitlocke, P. 8.</NOTE> No particular cause was assigned of
their confinement. The special command alone of the King
and council was pleaded. And it was asserted, that, by law,
this was not sussicient reason for refusing bail or releasement
to the prisoners.</P>
<P>THIS question was brought to a solemn trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November</NOTE> before the
king's bench; and the whole kingdom was attentive to the
<PB N="165" REF="201"/>
issue of a cause, which was of much greater consequence
than the event of many battles.</P>
<P>BY the debates on this subject, it appeared, beyond con∣troversy,
to the nation, that their ancestors had been so
jealous of personal liberty, as to secure it against arbitrary
power in the crown, by six<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">25 Edw. III. cap. 4. 28 Edw. III. cap. 3. 37 Edw. III. cap. 18, 38 Edward III. cap. 9. 42 Edward III. cap. 3. I Richard II. cap. 12.</NOTE> several statutes, and by an
article<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chap. 29.</NOTE> of the GREAT CHARTER itself, the most sacred
foundation of the laws and constitution. But the kings of
England, who had not been able to prevent the enacting
these laws, had sufficient authority, when the tide of liberty
was spent, to hinder their regular execution; and they
deemed it superfluous to attempt the formal repeal of sta∣tutes,
which they found so many expedients and pretences
to elude. Turbulent and seditious times frequently oc∣curred,
when the safety of the people absolutely required
the confinement of factious leaders; and by the genius of
the old constitution, the prince, of himself, was accustomed
to assume every branch of prerogative which was found ne∣cessary
for the preservation of public peace and of his own
authority. Expediency, at other times, would cover itself
under the appearance of necessity; and, in proportion as
precedents multiplied, the will alone of the sovereign was
sufficient to supply the place of expediency, of which he
constituted himself the sole judge. Tho' rebellious sub∣jects
had frequently, in the open field, resisted the King's
authority; no person had been found so bold, while con∣fined
and at mercy, as to set himself in opposition to regal
power, and to claim the protection of the laws and consti∣tution,
against the will of the sovereign. It was not till
this age, when the spirit of liberty was universally diffused,
when the principles of government were nearly reduced to
a system, that these five gentlemen above-mentioned, by a
noble effort, ventured, in this national cause, to bring the
<PB N="166" REF="202"/>
question to a final determination.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1627.</NOTE> And the King was asto∣nished
to observe, that a power, exercised by his predeces∣sors
almost without interruption, was found, upon trial, to
be directly opposite to the clearest laws, and supported by
few undoubted precedents in courts of judicature. These
had scarcely, in any instance, refused bail upon the com∣mitments
by special command of the king; because the
persons committed had seldom or never dared to demand it;
at least insist on their demand.</P>
<P>SIR Randolf Crew, lord chief justice, had been dis∣placed,
as unfit for the purposes of the court: Sir Nicholas
Hyde, esteemed more obsequious, had obtained that high
office: Yet the judges, by his direction, went no farther
than to remand the gentlemen to their prisons, and refuse
the bail which was offered<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rushwerth, vol. i. p. 462.</NOTE> Heathe, the attorney-general,
insisted, that the court, in imitation of the judges in the
34th of Elizabeth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 147.</NOTE>, should enter a general judgment, that
no bail could be granted, upon a commitment by the King
or council<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">State Trials, ibid. p. 161.</NOTE>. But the judges wisely declined complying.
The nation, they saw, were already, to the last degree, ex∣asperated.
In the present disposition of mens minds, uni∣versal
complaints prevailed, as if the kingdom were reduced
to slavery. And the most invidious prerogative of the crown,
it was said, that of imprisoning the subject, is here openly
and solemnly, and in numerous instances, exercised for the
most invidious purpose; in order to extort loans, or rather
subsidies, without consent of parliament.</P>
<P>BUT this was not the only hardship, of which the na∣tion
then thought that they had reason to complain. The
army, which had made the fruitless expedition to Cadiz,
were dispersed throughout the kingdom; and money was
levied upon the counties, for the payment of their quar∣ters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 419.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="203"/>
THE soldiers were billetted upon private houses, contrary
to custom, which required, that, in all ordinary cases,
they should be quartered in inns and public houses<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush worth, vol. i. p. 419.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOSE, who had refused or delayed the loan, were sure
to be loaded with a greater number of these dangerous and
disorderly guests.</P>
<P>MANY too, of low condition, who had shewn a refractory
disposition, were pressed into the service, and inlisted in the
fleet or army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid, vol. i. p. 422.</NOTE>. Sir Peter Hayman, for the same reason,
was dispatched on an errand into the Palatinate<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 431.</NOTE>: Glan∣ville,
an eminent lawyer, had been obliged, during the
former interval of parliament, to accept of an office in the
navy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Parlia. Hist. vol. vii. p. 310.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE soldiers, ill-paid and undisciplined, committed
many crimes and outrages; and increased extremely the
public discontents. To prevent these disorders, martial
law, so necessary to the support of discipline, was ex∣ercised
upon the soldiers. By a contradiction, which is
very natural, when the people are exasperated, the out∣rages
of the army were complained of; the remedy was
thought still more intolerable<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 419. Whitlocke, p. 7.</NOTE>. Though the expediency,
if we are not rather to say the necessity, of martial law,
had formerly been deemed, of itself, a sufficient ground for
establishing it; men, now become more jealous of liberty,
find more refined reasoners in questions of government, re∣garded,
as illegal and arbitrary, every exercise of autho∣rity,
which was not supported by express statute, or unin∣terrupted
precedent.</P>
<P>IT may safely be affirmed, that, except a few courtiers
or ecclesiastics, all men were displeased with this high exer∣tion
of prerogative, and this new spirit of administration.
Though, antient precedents were pleaded in favour of the
King's measures; a great difference, upon comparison, was
<PB N="168" REF="204"/>
observed between the cases. Acts of power, however irre∣gular,
might; casually and at intervals be exercised by a
prince, for the sake of dispatch or expediency; and yet li∣berty
still subsist, in some tolerable degree, under his admi∣nistration.
But where all these were reduced into a system,
were exerted without interruption, were studiously sought
for, in order to supply the place of laws, and subdue the
refractory spirit of the nation; it was necessary to find some
speedy remedy, or finally to abandon all hopes of preserving
the freedom of the constitution. Nor could moderate men
esteem the provocation, which the King had received, though
great, sufficient to warrant all these violent measures. The
commons, as yet, had no wise invaded his authority: They
had only exercised, as best pleased them, their own privi∣leges.
Was he excusable, because, from one house of par∣liament,
he had met with harsh and unkind treatment, to
make, in revenge, an invasion on the rights and liberties of
the whole nation?</P>
<P>BUT great was at this time the surprize of all men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with France.</NOTE> when
Charles, baffled in every attempt against the Austrian domi∣nions,
embroiled with his own subjects, unsupplied with any
treasure but what he extorted by the most, invidious and most
dangerous measures; as if the half of Europe, now his
enemy, was not sufficient for the exercise of military prowess;
wantonly attacked France, the other great kingdom in
his neighbourhood, and engaged at once in war against
these two powers, whose interests were hitherto esteemed so
incompatible, that they could never, it was thought, agree
either in the same friendships or enmities. All authentic
memoirs, both foreign and domestic, ascribe to Bucking∣ham's
counsels this war with France, and represent him, as
actuated by motives, which would appear incredible, were
we not sufficiently acquainted with the extreme violence and
temerity of his character.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="205"/>
THE three great monarchies of Europe were at this time
ruled by young princes, Philip, Louis, and Charles, who
were nearly of the same age, and who had resigned the go∣vernment
of themselves, and of their kingdoms, to their
creatures and ministers, Olivarez, Richelieu, and Buckingham.
The people, whom the moderate temper or narrow genius of
their princes, would have allowed to remain for ever in tranqui∣lity,
were strongly agitated by the emulation and jealousy of
the ministers. Above all, the towering spirit of Richelieu,
incapable of rest, promised an active age, and gave indica∣tions
of great revolutions throughout all Europe.</P>
<P>THIS man had no sooner, by suppleness and intrigue, got
possession of the reins of government, than he formed, at
once, three mighty projects; to subdue the turbulent spirits
of the great, to reduce the rebellious hugonots, and to curb
the encroaching power of the house of Austria, Undaunted
and implacable, prudent and active; he braved all the oppo∣sition
of the French princes and nobles in the prosecution of
his vengeance; he discovered and dissipated all their most
secret cabals and conspiracies. His sovereign himself he
held in subjection, while he exalted the throne. The
people, while they lost their liberties, acquired, by means
of his administration, learning, order, discipline, and re∣nown.
That confused and inaccurate genius of govern∣ment,
which France partook in common with other Euro∣pean
kingdoms, he changed into a simple monarchy; at the
very time, when the incapacity of Buckingham encouraged
the free spirit of the commons to establish in England a re∣gular
system of liberty.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, unequal the comparison between these mi∣nisters,
Buckingham had entertained a mighty jealousy against
Richelieu; a jealousy not founded on rivalship of power and
politics, but of love and gallantry; where the Duke was
as much superior to the Cardinal, as he was inferior in every
other particular.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="206"/>
AT the time, when Charles married by proxy the Princess,
Henrietta, the, Duke of Buckingham had been dispatched into
France, in order to grace the nuptials, and conduct the new
Queen into England. The eyes of the whole French court
were directed by curiosity towards that man, who had enjoyed
the unlimited favour of two successive monarchs, and who,
from a private station, had mounted, in the earliest youth,
to the absolute government of three kingdoms. The ex∣treme
beauty of his person, the gracefulness of his air, the
splendor of his equipage, his fine taste in dress, festivals,
and carousals, corresponded to the prepossessions enter∣tertained
in his favour: The affability of his behaviour,
the gaiety of his manners, the magnificence of his expence,
increased still farther the general admiration which was paid
him. All business being already concerted, the time was
intirely spent in mirth and entertainments; and, during
those splendid scenes, among that gay people, the Duke
found himself in a situation, where he was perfectly quali∣fied
to excel<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Chrendon, vol. i. p. 38.</NOTE>. But his great success at Paris proved as
fatal as his former failure at Madrid. Encouraged by the
smiles of the court, he dared to carry his ambitious ad∣dresses
to the Queen herself; and he failed not to make im∣pression
on a heart not undisposed to the tender passions.
That attachment, at least, of the mind, which appears so
delicious, and is so dangerous, seems to have been en∣couraged
by the Princess; and the Duke presumed so far
on her good graces, that, after his departure, he secretly
returned upon some pretence, and, paying a visit to the
Queen, was dismissed with a reproof, which favoured more
of kindness than of anger<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Memoires do Mad. de Motteville.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INFORMATION of this correspondence was, soon carried
to Richelieu. The vigilance of that minister was here
farther rouzed by jealousy. He too, either from vanity or
politics, had ventured to pay his addresses to the Queen.
<PB N="171" REF="207"/>
But a priest, past middle age, of a severe character, and
occupied in the most extensive plans of ambition or ven∣geance,
was but an unequal match in that contest, for a
young courtier, intirely disposed to gaiety and gallantry.
The Cardinal's disappointment strongly inclined him to
counter-work the amorous projects of his rival. When the
Duke was making preparations for a new embassy to Paris,
a message was sent him from Louis, that he must not think
of such a journey. In a romantic passion, he swore, <HI>That
he would see the Queen, spite of all the power of France;</HI>
and, from that moment, he was determined to engage
England in a war with that kingdom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE first took advantage of some quarrels, excited by the
Queen of England's attendants; and he persuaded Charles
to dismiss, at once, all her French servants, contrary to the
articles of the marriage treaty<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 423, 424.</NOTE>. He encouraged the
English ships of war and privateers to seize vessels belonging
to French merchants; and <HI>these</HI> he forthwith condemned as
prizes by a sentence of the court of admiralty. But
finding, that all these injuries produced only remonstrances
and embassies, or at most reprizals, on the part of France;
he resolved to second the intrigues of the Duke of Soubize,
and to undertake at once a military expedition against that
nation.</P>
<P>SOUBIZE, who, with his brother, the Duke of Rohan,
was the leader of the hugonot faction, was at that time in
London, and strongly sollicited Charles to embrace the pro∣tection
of these distressed religionists. He represented, That,
after the inhabitants of Rochelle had been repressed by the
combined squadrons of England and Holland, after peace
was concluded with the French King under Charles's me∣diation,
the ambitious Cardinal was still meditating the
destruction of the hugonots; that preparations were silently
making in every province of France for the suppression of
<PB N="172" REF="208"/>
their religion; that forts were erected in order to bridle
Rochelle, the most considerable bulwark of the protestants;
that the reformed in France cast their eyes on Charles as the
head of their faith, and considered him as a prince engaged
by interest, as well as inclination, to support them; that so
long as their party subsisted, Charles might rely on their
obedience, as much as on that of his own subjects; but,
if their liberties were once ravished from them, the power
of France, freed from this impediment, would soon be∣come
formidable to England, and to all the neighbouring
nations.</P>
<P>THOUGH Charles probably bore but small favour to the
hugonots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of July. Expendition to the isle of Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> who so much resembled the puritans, in discipline
and worship, in religion and politics; he yet allowed him∣self
to be gained by these arguments, inforced by the so∣licitations
of Buckingham. A fleet of an hundred sail,
and an army of 7000 men, were fitted out for the invasion
of France, and both of them entrusted to the command of
the Duke, who was altogether unacquainted both with land
and sea-service. The fleet appeared before Rochelle: But
so ill-concerted were the Duke's measures, that the inhabi∣tants
of that city shut their gates, and refused to admit al∣lies,
of whose coming they were not previously informed<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 426.</NOTE>.
All his military operations showed equal incapacity and in∣experience.
Instead of attacking Oleron, a fertile island
and defenceless, he bent his course to the isle of Rhé, which
was well garrisoned and fortified: Having landed his men,
tho' with some loss, he followed not the blow, but allowed
Toiras, the French governor, five days respite; during
which St. Martin was victualed and provided for a siege<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 8. Sir Philip War∣wick, p. 25.</NOTE>.
He left behind him the small fort of Prie, which could
at first have made no manner of resistance: Though resolved
<PB N="173" REF="209"/>
to starve St. Martin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Oct.</NOTE> he guarded the sea negligently, and
allowed provisions and ammunition, to be thrown into it:
Despairing to reduce it by famine, he attacked it without
having made any breach, and rashly threw away the lives of
the soldiers: Having found, that a French army had stolen
over in small divisions, and had landed at Prie, the fort
which he had at first overlooked; he began to think of a
retreat; but made it so unskilfully, that it was equivalent
to a total rout: He was the last, of the whole army, that
embarked; and he returned to England, having lost two
thirds of his land forces; totally discredited both as an ad∣miral
and a general; and bringing no praise with him, but
that vulgar one of courage and personal bravery.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Rohan, who had taken arms as soon as
Buckingham appeared upon the coast, discovered the dan∣gerous
spirit of the sect, without being able to do any
mischief: The inhabitants of Rochelle, who had at last
been induced to join themselves to the English, hastened the
vengeance of their master, exhausted their provisions in
supplying their allies, and were threatened with an imme∣diate
siege. Such were the fruits of Buckingham's expe∣dition
against France.</P>

<P>THERE was reason to apprehend some disorder or in∣surrection
from the discontents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1628.</NOTE> which prevailed
among the people. Their liberties, they believed, were
ravished from them; illegal taxes extorted; their commerce,
which had met with a severe check from the Spanish, was
totally annihilated by the French war; those military ho∣nours,
transmitted to them from their ancestors, had re∣ceived
a grievous stain, by two unsuccessful and ill-con∣ducted
expeditions; scarce an illustrious family but mourn∣ed,
from the last of them, the loss of a son or brother;
greater calamities were dreaded from the war with these,
powerful monarchies, concurring with the internal disorders,
under which the nation laboured. And these ills were
ascribed, not to the refractory disposition of the two for∣mer
parliaments, to which they were partly owing; but
solely to Charles's obstinacy, in adhering to the counsels of
Buckingham; a man no wise intitled, by his birth, age,
services, or merit, to that unlimited confidence, reposed in
him. To be sacrificed to the interest, policy, and ambi∣tion
of the great, is so much the common lot of the people,
that they may appear unreasonable, who would pretend to
complain of it: But to be the victim of the frivolous gal∣lantry
of a favourite, and of his boyish caprices, seemed
the subject of peculiar indignation.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="211"/>
IN this situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LI.</NOTE> it may be imagined, the King and the
Duke dreaded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Par∣liament.</NOTE> above all things, the assembling a parliament:
But, so little foresight had they possessed in their enter∣prizing
schemes, that they found themselves under an abso∣lute
necessity of embracing that expedient. The money
levied, or rather extorted, under colour of prerogative, had
come in very slowly, and had left such ill-humour in the nation,
that it appeared dangerous to renew the experiment. The
absolute necessity of supply, it was hoped, would engage
the commons to forget all past injuries; and, having expe∣rienced
the ill effects of former obstinacy, they would pro∣bably
assemble with a resolution of making some reasonable
compliances. The more to soften them, it was concerted,
by Sir Robert Cotton's advice<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 230.</NOTE>, that Buckingham should
be the first person, who proposed in council the calling a
new parliament. Having laid in this stock of merit, he
expected, that all his former misdemeanors would be over∣looked
and forgiven, and that, instead of a tyrant and op∣pressor,
he should be regarded as the first patriot in the
nation.</P>
<P>THE views of the popular leaders were much more ju∣dicious
and profound.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 17.</NOTE> When the commons assembled,
they appeared to be men of the same independent spirit with
their predecessors, and possessed of such riches, that their
property was computed to surpass three times that of the
house of peers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Sanderson, p. 106. Walker, p. 339.</NOTE>; they were deputed by boroughs and
counties, inflamed, all of them, by the late violations of
liberty; many of the members themselves had been cast
into prison, and had suffered by the measures of the court;
yet, notwithstanding all these circumstances, which might
prompt them to embrace violent resolutions, they entered
upon business with perfect temper and decorum. They
considered, that the King, disgusted at these popular assem∣blies,
and little prepossessed in favour of their privileges,
<PB N="176" REF="212"/>
wanted but a fair pretence of breaking with them, and
would seize the first opportunity offered by any incident or
undutiful behaviour of the members. He fairly told them,
in his first speech, that, “If they should not do their du∣ties,
in contributing to the necessities of the state, he
must, in discharge of his conscience, use those other
means, which God had put into his hands, in order to
save that which the follies of some particular men may
otherwise put in danger. Take not this for a threaten∣ing,”
added the King,“for I scorn to threaten any but
my equals; but as an admonition from him, who, by
nature and duty, has most care of your preservation and
prosperity<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 477. Franklyn, p. 233.</NOTE>.” The Lord keeper, by the King's direction,
subjoined, “This way of parliamentary supplies, as his
Majesty told you, he hath chosen, not as the only way,
but as the fittest; not because he is destitute of others,
but because it is most agreeable to the goodness of his own
most gracious disposition, and to the desire and weal of
his people. If this be deferred, necessity and the sword
of the enemy make way to the others. Remember his
Majesty's admonition, I say, remember it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 479. Franklyn, p. 234.</NOTE>.” From
these avowed maxims, the commons foresaw, that, if the
least handle was afforded, the King would immediately dis∣solve
them, and would thenceforward deem himself justi∣fied
for violating, in a manner still more open, all the antient
forms of the constitution. No remedy could then looked
for, but from insurrections and civil war, of which the
issue would be extremely uncertain, and which must, in
all events, prove infinitely calamitous to the whole nation.
To correct the late disorders in the administration required
some new laws, which would, no doubt, appear harsh to
a prince, so enamoured of his prerogative; and it was re∣quisite
to temper, by the decency and moderation of their
debates, the rigour, which must necessarily attend their
<PB N="177" REF="213"/>
determinations. Nothing can give us a higher idea of the
capacity of those men, who now guided the commons, and
of the great authority, which they had acquired, than the
forming and executing so judicious and so difficult a plan of
operations.</P>
<P>THE decency, however, which the popular leaders had
prescribed to themselves, and recommended to others,
hindered them not from making the loudest and most
vigorous complaints against the grievances, under which
the nation had lately laboured. Sir Francis Seymour said,
“This is the great council of the kingdom, and here with
certainty, if not here only, his Majesty may see, as in a
true glass, the state of the kingdom. We are called hither
by his writs, in order to give him faithful counsel; such as
may stand with his honour: And this we must do with∣out
flattery. We are all sent hither by the people, in
order to deliver their just grievances: And this we must
do without fear. Let us not act like Cambyses's judges,
who, when their approbation was demanded by the
prince to some illegal measure, said, that, <HI>Though there
was a written law, the Persian kings might follow their
own will and pleasure.</HI> This was base flattery, fitter for
our reproof than our imitation; and as fear, so flattery,
taketh away the judgment. For my part, I shall shun
both; and speak my mind with as much duty, as any
man, to his Majesty, without neglecting the public.</P>
<P>BUT how can we express our affections, while we re∣tain
our fears; or speak of giving, till we know whe∣ther
we have any thing to give. For, if his Majesty
may be persuaded to take what he will, what need we
give?</P>
<P>THAT this hath been done, appeareth by the billetting
of soldiers, a thing no wise advantageous to the King's
service, and a burthen to the commonwealth: By the
imprisonment of gentlemen for refusing the loan, who,
<PB N="178" REF="214"/>
if they had done the contrary, for fear, had been a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
blameable as the projectors of that oppressive measure.
To countenance these proceedings, hath it not been
preached in the pulpit, or rather prated, that <HI>All we
have is the King's by divine right?</HI> But when preachers
forsake their own calling, and turn ignorant statesmen;
we see how willing they are to exchange a good consci∣ence
for a bishopric.</P>
<P>HE, I must confess, is no good subject, who would
not, willingly and cheerfully, lay down his life, when
that sacrifice may promote the interests of his sovereign,
and the good of the commonwealth. But he is not a good
subject, he is a slave, who will allow his goods to be
taken from him against his will, and his liberty against
the laws of the kingdom. By opposing these practices,
we shall but tread in the steps of our forefathers, who
still preferred the public before their private interest, nay,
before their very lives. It will in us be a wrong done
to ourselves, to our posterities, to our consciences, if we
forego this claim and pretension<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 243. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 499.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“I read of a custom,” said Sir Robert Philips, “among
the old Romans, that, once every year, they held a so∣lemn
festival, in which their slaves had liberty, without
exception, to speak what they pleased, in order to ease
their afflicted minds; and, on the conclusion of the
festival, the slaves severally returned to their former ser∣vitudes.</P>
<P>THIS institution may, with some distinction, well set
forth our present state and condition. After the revolu∣tion
of some time, and the grievous sufferance of many
violent oppressions, we have now, at last, as those slaves,
obtained, or a day, some liberty of speech: But shall
not, I trust, be hereafter slaves: For we are born free
<PB N="179" REF="215"/>
Yet, what new illegal burthens our estates and persons have
groaned under, my heart yearns to think of, my tongue
falters to utter.—</P>
<P>THE grievances, by which we are oppressed, I draw
under two, heads; acts of power against law, and the
judgments of lawyers against, our liberty.”</P>
<P>HAVING mentioned three illegal judgments, passed within
his memory; that by which the Scots, born after James's
accession, were admitted to all the privileges of English sub∣jects;
that by which the new impositions had been warrant∣ed;
and the last, by which arbitrary imprisonments were
authorized; he thus proceeded.</P>
<P>“I CAN live, though another, who has no right, be put
to live along with me; nay, I can live, though burthened
with impositions, beyond what at present I labour under:
But to have my liberty, which is the soul of my life, ra∣vished
from me; to have my person pent up in a jail,
without relief by law, and to be so adjudged,—O!
improvident ancestors! O! unwise forefathers! to be so
curious in providing for the quiet possession of our lands,
and the liberties of parliament; and, at the same time,
to neglect our personal liberty, and let us lie in prison,
and that during pleasure, without redress or remedy! If
this be law, why do we talk of liberties? Why trouble
ourselves with disputes about a constitution, franchises,
property of goods, and the like? What may any man
call his own, if not the liberty of his person?</P>
<P>I AM weary of treading these ways; and therefore
conclude to have a select committee, in order to frame a
petition to his Majesty for redress of these oppressions.
And this petition being read, examined, and approved,
may be delivered to the King; of whose gracious answer
we have no cause to doubt, our desires being so reasonable,
our intentions so loyal, and the manner so dutiful. Neither
<PB N="180" REF="216"/>
need we fear, that this is the critical parliament, as has
been insinuated; or that this is the way to distraction:
But assure ourselves of a happy issue. Then shall the
the King, as he calls us his great council, find us his
true council, and own us his good council<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 245. Parlia. Hist. vol. vii. p. 363. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 502.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE same topics were inforced by Sir Thomas Went∣worth.
After mentioning projectors and ill ministers of
state,
“These,” said he, “have introduced a privy coun∣cil,
ravishing, at once, the spheres of all ancient govern∣ment;
destroying all liberty; imprisoning us without
bail or bond. They have taken from us—What shall
I say? Indeed, what have they left us? By tearing up
the roots of all property, they have taken from us every
means of supplying the King, and of ingratiating our∣selves
by voluntary proofs of our duty and attachment
towards him.</P>
<P>To the making whole all these breaches, I shall app<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
myself; and, to all these diseases, shall propound a re∣medy.
By one and the same thing, have the King and
the people been hurt, and by the same must they be
cured. We must vindicate: What? New things? No:
Our an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient, legal, and vital liberties; by re-inforcing
the laws, enacted by our ancestors; by setting such a
stamp upon them, that no licentious spirit shall dare
henceforth to invade them. And shall we think this a
way to break a parliament? No: Our desires are modest
and just. I speak both for the interest of King and
people. If we enjoy not these rights, it will be im∣possible
for us to relieve him. Let us never therefore,
doubt of a favourable reception from his goodness<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 243. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 500.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THESE sentiments were unanimously embraced by the
whole house. Even the court party pretended not to plead,
in defence of the late measures, any thing but the necessity,
to which the King had been reduced, by the obstinacy of
<PB N="181" REF="217"/>
the two former parliaments. A vote, therefore, was passed
without opposition, against arbitrary imprisonments and
forced loans<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 251. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 513. Whitlocke, p, 9.</NOTE>. And the spirit of liberty having obtained
some satisfaction by this exertion of itself, the King's re∣iterated
messages, who pressed for supply, were attended to
with better temper. Five subsidies were voted him; with
which, though much inferior to his wants, he declared
himself well satisfied; and even tears of affection started
in his eye, when he was informed of this concession. The
Duke's approbation too was mentioned by Secretary Coke;
but the conjunction of a subject with the sovereign was ill
received by the house<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 526. Whitlocke, p. 9.</NOTE>. Though disgusted with the King,
the jealousy, which they felt for his honour, was more sen∣sible
than that, which his unbounded confidence in the
Duke would allow even himself to entertain.</P>
<P>THE supply, though voted, was not, as yet, passed
into a law; and the commons resolved to employ the interval,
in providing some barriers to their rights and liberties, so
lately violated. They knew, that their own vote, declaring
the illegality of the former measures, had not, of itself,
sufficient authority to secure the constitution against all fu∣ture
invasion. Some act to that purpose must receive the
sanction of the whole legislature; and they appointed a
committee to prepare the model of so important a law. By
collecting into one effort all the dangerous and oppressive
claims of his prerogative, Charles had exposed them to the
hazard of one assault; and had farther, by presenting a
nearer view of the consequences attending them, rouzed the
independent genius of the commons. Forced loans, bene∣volences,
taxes without consent of parliament, arbitrary
imprisonments, billetting soldiers, martial law; these were
the grievances complained of, and against these an eternal
remedy was to be provided. The commons pretended not,
<PB N="182" REF="218"/>
as they affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Petition of Right.</NOTE> to any unusual powers or privileges:
They aimed only at securing those transmitted them from their
ancestors: And their law they resolved to call a PETITION
OF RIGHT; as implying that it contained a corroboration
or explanation of the antient constitution, not any infringe∣ment
of royal prerogative, or acquisition of new liberties.</P>
<P>WHILE the committee was employed in framing the pe∣tition
of right, the favourers of each party, both in par∣liament
and throughout the nation, were engaged in dis∣disputes
about this bill, which, in all likelihood, was to
form a memorable aera in the English government.</P>
<P>THAT the statutes, said the partizans of the commons,
which secure English liberty, are not become obsolete, ap∣pears
hence, that the English have ever been free, and have
ever been governed by law and a limited constitution. Pri∣vileges
in particular, which are founded on the GREAT
CHARTER, must always remain in force, because derived
from a source of never-failing authority; regarded in all
age, as the most sacred contract between king and people.
Such attention was paid to this charter by our generous an∣cestors,
that they got the confirmation of it re-iterated
thirty several times; and even secured it by a law, which
seems in the execution impracticable. They enacted, <HI>That
no statute, which should be afterwards enacted in contra∣diction
to any article of that charter, should ever have any
force or validity.</HI> But with regard to that important ar∣ticle,
which secures personal liberty; so far from attempt∣ing,
at any time, any legal infringement of it, they have
corroborated it by six statutes, and put it out of all doubt
and controversy. If in practice it has often been violated,
abuses can never come in place of rules; nor can any rights
or legal powers be derived from injury and injustice. But
the subjects title to personal liberty is not founded only on
antient, and therefore, the most sacred laws: It is con∣firmed
by the whole ANALOGY of the government and
<PB N="183" REF="219"/>
constitution. A free monarchy, in which every individual
is a slave, is a glaring contradiction; and it is requisite,
where the laws assign privileges to the different orders of
the state, that it likewise secure the independence of all the
members. If any difference could be made in this particu∣lar,
it were better to abandon even life or property to the
arbitrary will of the prince; nor would such immediate
danger ensue, from that concession, to the laws and to the pri∣vileges
of the people. To bereave of his life a man not con∣demned
on any legal trial, is so egregious an exercise of
tyranny, as must at once shock the natural humanity of
princes, and convey an alarm through the whole common-wealth.
To confiscate a man's fortune, besides its being a
most atrocious act of violence, exposes the monarch so
much to the imputation of avarice and rapacity, that it
will seldom be attempted in any civilized government. But
confinement, though a less striking, is no less severe a pu∣nishment; nor is there any spirit, so erect and independent,
as not to be broke by the long continuance of the silent and
inglorious sufferings of a jail. The power of imprison∣ment,
therefore, being the most natural and potent engine
of arbitrary government, it is absolutely necessary to remove
it from a government which is free and legal.</P>
<P>THE partizans of the court reasoned after a different
manner. The true rule of government, said they, during
any period, is that to which the people, from time, imme∣morial,
have been accustomed, and to which they naturally
pay a prompt obedience. A practice, which has ever
struck their senses, and of which they have seen and heard
innumerable precedents, has an authority with them much
superior to that which attends maxims derived from anti∣quated
statutes and mouldy records. In vain do the lawyers
establish it as a principle, that a statute can never be abrogated
by opposite custom; but requires to be expressly repeatled
by a contrary statute: While they pretend to inculcate an
<PB N="184" REF="220"/>
axiom, peculiar to English jurisprudence, they violate the most
established principles of human nature; and even, by neces∣sary
consequence, reason in contradiction to law itelf, which
they would represent as so sacred and inviolable. A law, to
have any authority, must be derived from a legislature, which
has right. And whence do all legislatures derive their
right but from long custom and established practice? If a
statute, contrary to public good, has, at any time, been
rashly voted and assented to, either from the violence of
faction, or the inexperience of senates and princes; it can∣not
be more effectually abrogated, than by a train of con∣trary
precedents, which prove, that, from common consent,
it has tacitly been set aside, as inconvenient and impracti∣cable.
Such has been the case with all those statues
enacted during turbulent times, in order to limit royal pre∣rogative,
and cramp the sovereign in his protection of the
public, and his execution of the laws. But above all the
branches of prerogative, that which is most necessary to be
preserved, is the power of imprisonment. Faction and dis∣content,
like diseases, frequently arise in every political
body; and, during these disorders, 'tis by the salutry ex∣ercise
alone of this discretionary power, that rebellions and
civil wars can be prevented. To circumscribe this power,
is to destroy its nature: Intirely to abrogate it, is impracti∣cable;
and the attempt itself must prove dangerous, if not
pernicious to the public. The supreme magistrate, in cri∣tical
and turbulent times, will never, agreeable either to
prudence or duty, allow the state to perish, while there re∣mains
a remedy, which, however irregular, it is still in his
power to apply. And if, moved by a regard to public good,
he employs any exercise of power, condemned by recent
and express statute; how greedily, in such dangerous times,
will factious leaders seize this pretence of throwing on his
government the imputation of tyranny and despotism?
Were the alternative quite necessary, it were surely much
<PB N="185" REF="221"/>
better for human society to be deprived of liberty than to be
destitute of government.</P>
<P>IMPARTIAL reasoners will confess, that this subject is
not, on both sides, without its difficulties. Where a ge∣neral
and rigid law is enacted against arbitrary imprison∣ments,
it would appear, that government cannot in times of
sedition and faction, be conducted but by temporary sus∣pensions
of the law; and such an expedient, during the age
of Charles, was never thought of. The meetings of par∣liament
were too precarious, and their determinations might
be too dilatory, to serve in cases of urgent necessity. Nor
was it then conceived, that a King did not possess of him∣self
sufficient power for the security and protection of his
people, or that the authority of these popular assemblies
was ever to become so absolute, that the prince must always
conform himself to it, and could never have any occasion to
guard against <HI>their</HI> practices, as well as against those of his
other subjects.</P>
<P>THOUGH the house of lords were not insensible to the
reasons urged in favour of the pretensions of the commons,
they deemed the arguments, pleaded in favour of the crown,
still more cogent and convincing. That assembly seems,
during this whole period, to have acted, in the main, a
reasonable and a moderate part; and if their byass inclined
a little too much, as is natural, to the side of monarchy,
they were far from entertaining any design of sacrificing to
arbitrary will the liberties and privileges of the nation.
Ashley, the King's serjeant, having asserted, in a pleading
before the peers, that the King must sometimes govern by
acts of state as well as by law; this position gave such of∣fence,
that he was immediately committed to prison, and
was not released but upon his recantation and submission<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Whitlo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p. 10.</NOTE>.
Being, however, afraid, that the commons would go too
a far in their projected petition, the peers proposed a plan of
<PB N="186" REF="222"/>
one more moderate, which they recommended to the con∣sideration
of the other house. It consisted meerly in a ge∣neral
declaration, That the great charter and the six statutes,
conceived to be explanations of it, stand still in force, to all in∣tents
and purposes; that, in consequence of the charter and
the statutes, and by the tenor of the antient customs and laws
of the land, every subject has a fundamental property in his
goods, and a fundamental liberty of his person; that his pro∣perty
and liberty are as intire at present as during any former
period of the English government; that in all common cases,
the common law ought to be the standard of proceedings:
“And in case, that, for the security of his Majesty's per∣son,
the general safety of his people, or the peaceable go∣vernment
of the kingdom, the King shall find just cause,
for reasons of state, to imprison or restrain any man's
person; he was petitioned graciously to declare, that
within a <HI>convenient</HI> time, he shall and will express the
cause of the commitment or restraint, either general or
special, and upon a cause so expressed, will leave the pri∣soner
immediately to be tried according to the common
law of the land.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 187. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 546.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Abbot was employed by the lords to re∣commend,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a conference, this plan of a petition to the
house of commons. The prelate, as was, no doubt, fore∣seen
from his known principles, was not extremely urgent in
his applications; and the lower house were fully convinced,
that the general declarations signified nothing, and that the
latter clause left their liberties rather in a worse condition
than before. They proceeded, therefore, with great zeal,
in framing the model of a petition, which should contain
expressions, more precise, and more favorable to public
freedom.</P>
<P>THE King could easily see the consequences of these pro∣ceedings.
Though he had offered at the beginning of the
session, to give his consent to any law for the security of the
<PB N="187" REF="223"/>
rights and liberties of the people; he had not expected,
that such inroads should be made on his prerogative. In
order, therefore, to divert the commons from their inten∣tion,
he sent a message, wherein he desired the houses,
“ Clearly to let him know, whether they will rest upon his
royal promise in favour of their liberties: Which promise
he had given at several times, and chiefly by the Lord
Keeper's speech made in his own presence. If they rely
on it, he assured them, it should be really and royally
performed<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 189. Rushworth, vol. i, p. 552.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>SECRETARY Coke, who delivered this message, after
some preamble, and some apology for past grievances, pro∣ceeded
in this manner. “When means were denied his
Majesty, being a young King and newly come to the
crown, which he found engaged in a war; what could
we expect in such necessities? His Majesty has called this
parliament to make up the breach: His Majesty assures
us, that we shall not have like cause to complain: He
assures us, that the laws shall be eftablished. What can
we desire more? The important point is, that we pro∣vide
for posterity, and prevent the like practices for the
future. Were not the same means provided by them be∣fore
us? Can we do more? We stand at present on the
confines between the liberty of the subject and the prero∣gatives
of the King. I hope, that we shall not pretend
to add any thing for ourselves, in order to depress
him. I will not divine: Yet I think, that, in such pre∣tensions,
we shall find difficulty with the King; nay, perhaps,
with the lords. For my part, I shall not, as
counsellor to his Majesty, deliver any opinion, which I
will not openly declare and justify, here, or at the coun∣cil-board.
Will we, in this necessity, strive to bring
ourselves into a better condition and greater liberty than
our fathers enjoyed, and reduce the crown to a worse
than ever? I dare not advise his Majesty to give way to
such measures. What we now desire, if it be no inno∣vation,
<PB N="186" REF="224"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="187" REF="225"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="188" REF="226"/>
is all contained in those acts and statutes; and
whatever more we shall add is a diminution to the King's
power, and an accession to our own. We deal with a
wise and valiant prince, who hath a sword in his hand for
our good; and this good cannot be attained without
power. Do not think, that, by parliamentary debates,
or even by clauses of statutes, we can make that to be
unlawful, which, by experience, we have found to be
derived from necessity, and from a necessity so urgent,
that it admits not of remedy from any law.—And I
beseech you to consider, whether those, who have been
in the same place, which I now occupy, have not freely
given warrants for commitment; and yet no doubt been
entertained, nor any complaint made by the subject<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 189, 190, Rush. vol. i. p. 553.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>UPON this speech there arose a great debate in the house.
Many reasons were a-new urged on both sides: But, Sir
Thomas Wentworth closed the debate, by saying, “That
never house of parliament, so far as regarded themselves,
trusted more than the present to the goodness of their
King: But we are ambitious,” said he, “that his Ma∣jesty's
goodness may remain to posterity, and we are ac∣countable
for a public trust. There hath been a public
violation of the laws by the King's ministers; and nothing
can satisfy the nation but a public reparation. Our desire
to vindicate the subjects right by bill, will carry us no
farther than what is contained in former laws, with some
modest provision for instruction, performance, and execu∣tion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush vol. i. 554.</NOTE>.”
This contained so much the sentiments of the
house, that it was universally acquiesced in.</P>
<P>THE King, however, was not discouraged. By another
message, he attempted to divert the commons from their pur∣pose.
He there acknowleged past errors, and promised, that,
hereafter, there should be no just cause of complaint. And
<PB N="189" REF="227"/>
he added, “That the affairs of the kingdom press him so,
that he could not continue the session above a week or two
longer: And if the house be not ready, by that time,
to do what is fit for themselves it shall be their own
fault<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">State Trials vol. vii. p. 193.</NOTE>.”
On a subsequent occasion, he asked them,
“Why demand explanations, if you doubt not the per∣formance
of the statutes, according to their true mean∣ing.
Explanations will hazard an encroachment upon
the prerogative. And it may well be said, What need a
new law to confirm an old, if you repose confidence in
the declarations, which his Majesty made to both
houses<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 190. Rush. vol. i. p. 556.</NOTE>.” The truth is, the great charter and the old
statutes were sufficiently clear in favour of liberty; But
as all Kings of England, had ever, in cases of necessity or
expediency, been accustomed, at intervals, to elude them;
and as Charles, in a complication of instances, had lately
violated them; the commons judged it requisite to enact a
new law, which might not be eluded or violated, by any
interpretation, construction, or contrary precedent. Nor
was it sufficient, they thought, that the King promised to re∣turn
into the way of his predecessors. His predecessors, in
all times, had enjoyed, at least, exercised, too much dis∣cretionary
power; and by his recent abuse of it, the whole world
had reason to see the necessity of intirely retrenching
it.</P>
<P>SIR Edward Coke urged on this occasion, with the ap∣probation
of the whole house, “Was it ever know, that
general words were a sufficient satisfaction for particular
grievances? Was ever a verbal declaration of the King
the world of the sovereign? When grievances are com∣plained
of, the parliament is to redress them. Did ever
the parliament rely on messages? They have ever put up
petitions of their grievances, and the King has ever
answered them. The Kings message is very gracious;
<PB N="190" REF="228"/>
but, what is the law of the realm? that is the question.
I have no diffidence of his Majesty; but the King must
speak by record, and in particulars. Did you ever
know the King's message come into a bill of subsidies?
All succeeding kings will say, <HI>Ye must trust me as you did
my predecessor, and ye must have the same confidence in
my messages.</HI> But messages of love never come into
a parliament. Let us put up a petition of right: Not
that I distrust the King; but that I cannot give trust ex∣cept
in a parliamentary way<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 197. Rush. vol. i. p. 558.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE King still persevered in his endeavours to elude the
petition. He sent a letter to the house of lords, in which
he went so far as to make a particular declaration, “That
neither he nor his privy-council shall or will, at any time
hereafter, commit or command to prison, or otherwise
restrain, any man for not lending money, or for any other
cause, which, in his conscience, he thought not to con∣cern
the public good, and the safety of King and people.”
And he farther declared, “That he never would be guilty
of so base an action as to pretend any cause, of whose
truth he was not fully satisfied<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 198. Rush. vol. i. p. 560. Parlia. Hist. vol. viii. p. III.</NOTE>.” But this promise,
though inforced to the commons by the recommendation of
the upper house, made no more impression than all the
former messages.</P>
<P>AMONG the other evasions of the King, we may reckon
the proposal of the house of peers, to subjoin, to the in∣tended
petition of right, the following clause, “We hum∣bly
present this petition to your Majesty, not only with a
care of preserving our own liberties, but with due re∣gard
to leave intire that <HI>sovereign power,</HI> with which
your Majesty is entrusted for the protection, safety, and
happiness of your people<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 199. Rush. vol. i. p. 56. Parlia. Hist. vol. viii. p. 116. Whitlocke, p. 10.</NOTE>.” Less penetration, than

what was possessed by the leaders of the house of commons,
could easily discover how captious this clause was, and how
much it was calculated to elude the whole force of the
petition.</P>
<P>THESE obstacles, therefore, being surmounted, the pe∣tition
of right passed the commons, and was sent to the
upper house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>This petition is of so great importance, that we shall here give it at length.</HI> Humbly shew unto our Sovereign Lord the King, the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in parliament assembled, That, whereas it is de∣clared and enacted, by a statute made in the time of the reign of King Edward I. commonly called <HI>Statutum de tallagio non concedendo,</HI> that no tal∣lage or aid shall be levied by the King or his heirs in this realm, without the good will and assent of the archbishops, bishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses, and other the freemen of the commonalty of this realm: And, by authority of parliament holden in the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward III. it is declared and enacted, That, from thence∣forth, no person should be compelled to make any loans to the King against his will, because such loans were against reason, and the franchise of the land: And, by other laws of this realm, it is provided, that none should be charged by any charge or imposition called a benevolence, or by such like charge: By which the statutes before-mentioned, and other the good laws and statutes of this realm, your subjects have inherited this freedom, that they should not be compelled to contribute to any tax, tallage, aid, or other like charge, not set by common consent in parliament.</P>
<P>II. Yet nevertheless, of late divers commissions directed to sundry com∣missioners in several counties, with instructions, have issued; by means whereof your people have been in divers places assembled, and required to lend certain sums of money unto your Majesty, and many of them, upon their refusal so to do, have had an oath administered unto them not warrant∣able by the laws or statutes of this realm, and have been constrained to be∣come bound to make appearance and give attendance before your privy council, and in other places, and others of them, have been therefore imprisoned, confined, and sundry other ways molested and disquieted: And divers other charges have been laid and levied upon your people, in several counties, by lord-lieutenants, deputy-lieutenants, commissioners for mus∣ters, justices of peace, and others, by command or direction from your Ma∣jesty, or your privy council, against the laws and free customs of this rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>III. And whereas also, by the statute called <HI>The great charter of the liberties of England,</HI> it is declared and enacted, That no freeman may be taken or imprisoned, or be disseized of his freehold or liberties, or his free customs, or be outlawed or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</P>
<P>IV. And, in the eight and twentieth year of the reign King Edward III. it was declared and enacted, by authority of parliament, That no man, of what estate or condition that he be, should be put out of his land or tenements, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disherited, nor put to death, without being brought to answer by due process of law.</P>
<P>V. Nevertheless, against the tenor of the said statutes, and other the good laws and statutes of your realm to that end provided, divers of your subjects have of late been imprisoned without any cause shewed: And, when, for their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they were brought before justice, by your Ma∣jesty's writs of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> there to undergo and receive as the court should order, and their keepers commanded to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the causes of their de∣tainer, no cause was certified, but that they were detained by your Ma∣jesty's special command, signified by the lords of your privy council, and yet were returned back to several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, without being charged with any thing to which they might make answer according to the law.</P>
<P>VI. And whereas of la<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e great companies of soldiers and mariners have been dispersed into divers counties of the realm, and the inhabitants, against their wills, have been compelled to receive them into their houses, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to suffer them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, against the laws and customs of this realm, and to the great grievance and vexation of the people.</P>
<P>VII. And whereas also, by authority of parliament, in the five and twentieth year of the reign of King Edward III. it is declared and enacted, That no man should be fore-judged of life or limb against the form of the <HI>Great charter</HI> and law of the land: And, by the said <HI>Great charter,</HI> and other the laws and statutes of this your realm, no man ought to be judged to death b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by the law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tablished in this your realm, either by the customs of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> realm, or by acts of parliament: And whereas no offender, of what kind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oever, is exempted from the proceedings to be used, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> punishments to be inflicted by the laws and statutes of this your realm: Nevertheless, of late divers commissions, under your Majesty's great seal, have issued forth, by which certain persons have been assigned and appointed commissioners, with power and authority to proceed within the land, according to the justice of martial law, against such soldiers and mariners, or other dissolute persons joining with them, as should commit any murther, robbery, felony, muti∣ny, or other outrage or misdemeanor whatsoever, and by such summary course and order as is agreeable to martial law, and as is used in armies in time of war, to proceed to the trial and condemnation of such offenders, and them to cause to be executed and put to death according to the law martial.</P>
<P>VIII. By pretext whereof some of your Majesty's subjects have been, by some of the said commissioners, put to death, when and where, if, by the laws and statutes of the land, they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deserved death, by the same laws and statutes also they might, and by no other ought, to have been judged and executed.</P>
<P>IX. And also sundry grievous offenders, by colour thereof claiming an exemption, have escaped the punishments due to them by the laws, and sta∣tutes of this your realm, by reason that divers of your officers, and ministers of justice have unjustly refused or forborn to proceed against such offenders, according to the same laws and statutes, upon pretence that the said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were punishable only by martial law, and by authority of such com∣missions as aforesaid: Which commissions, and all other of like nature, are wholly and directly contrary to the said laws and statutes of this your realm.</P>
<P>X. They do therefore humbly pray your most excellent Majesty, That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man hereafter be compelled to make or yield any gift, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, benevolence, tax, or such like charge, without common consent by act of parliament: And that none be called to make answer, or take such oath, or to give at∣tendance, or be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or otherways <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or disquieted concerning the same. or for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereof: And that no freeman, in any such manner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is before-mentioned, be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or detained: And that your Majesty would be pleased to remove <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said soldiers and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ners, and that your people may not be so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in time to come: And that the aforesaid commissions, for proceeding by martial law, may be revoked and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnulled: And that hereafter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/>.</P></NOTE> The peers, who were probably well
<PB N="192" REF="230"/>
pleased in secret, that all their sollicitations had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luded
by the commons, quickly passed the petition without any
<PB N="193" REF="231"/>
material alteration; and nothing but the royal assent was
wanting to give it the force of a law. The King accord∣ingly
came to the house of peers; sent for the commons;
and, being seated in his chair of state, the petition was
read to him. Great was now the astonishment of all men,
<PB N="194" REF="232"/>
when, instead of the usual concise, and clear form, by
which a bill is either confirmed or rejected, Charles said,
in answer to the petition, “The King willeth, that right
be done according to the laws and customs of the realm,
and that the statutes be put into execution; that his sub∣jects
may have no cause to complain of any wrong or
oppression, contrary to their just rights and liberties, to
the preservation whereof he holds himself in conscience
as much obliged as of his own prerogative<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 212. Rush. vol. i. p. 590.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>IT is surprizing, that Charles, who had seen so many
instances of the jealousy of the commons, who had hims<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
so much rouzed that jealousy by his frequent eva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
messages during this session, could imagine, that they would
remain satisfied with an answer so vague and undetermined.
It was evident, that the unusual form alone of the answer
must excite their attention; that the disappointment must
inflame their anger; and that therefore it was necessary,
the petition seemed to bear hard on royal, prerogative,
come early to some fixed resolution, either gracefully to
comply with it, or courageously to reject it.</P>
<P>IT happened, as might have been foreseen. The com∣mons
returned in very ill humour. Usually, when in that
disposition, their zeal and jealousy for religion, and their
enmity against the unfortunate catholics, ran extremely
high. But they had already, in the beginning of the session,
presented to the King their petition of religion, and had
received a satissactory answer; though they expected, that
the execution of the laws against papists would, for the fu∣ture,
be no more exact and rigid, than they had hitherto
found it. To give vent to their present indignation, they
fell, with their utmost force, on Dr. Manwaring.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing, which tends more to excuse, if not
to justify, the extreme rigour of the commons towards
<PB N="194" REF="233"/>

<PB N="199" REF="234"/>

<PB N="195" REF="236"/>
Charles, than his open encouragement and avowal of such
general principles, as were altogether incompatible with a
limited government. Manwaring had preached a sermon,
which the commons found, upon inquiry, to be printed by
special command from the King<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 206.</NOTE>; and, when this sermon
was looked into, it contained doctrines subversive of all
civil liberty. It taught, That, though property was com∣monly
lodged in the subject, yet, whenever any exigency
required supply, all property was transferred to the King;
that the consent of parliament was not requisite for the im∣position
of taxes; and that the divine laws required com∣pliance
with every demand, however irregular, which the
prince should make upon his subjects<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 585, 594. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 168, 169, 170, &amp;c. Welwood, p. 44.</NOTE>. For these doc∣trines,
the commons impeached Manwaring before the
peers. The sentence, pronounced upon him, was, That
he should be imprisoned during the pleasure of the house,
be fined a thousand pounds to the King, make submission
and acknowledgement for his offence, be suspended during
three years, be incapable of holding any ecclesiastical dig∣nity
or secular office, and that his book be called in and
burnt<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i, p. 65. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 212.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be worth notice, that, no sooner was the session
ended, than this man, so justly disagreeable to both houses,
received a pardon, and was promoted to a living of consi∣derable
value<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 635. Whitlocke, p. II.</NOTE> Some years after, he was raised to the see
of St. Asaph. If the republican spirit of the commons in∣creased,
beyond all reasonable bounds, the monarchical
spirit of the court, this latter, carried to so high a pitch,
tended still farther to augment the former. And thus ex∣tremes
were every where affected, and the just medium was
gradually deserted by all men.</P>
<P>FROM Manwaring, the house of commons proceeded to
censure the conduct of Buckingham, whose name, hitherto,
<PB N="196" REF="237"/>
they had cautiously forborne to mention<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 607.</NOTE>. In vain did the
King send them a message, in which he told them, that the
session was drawing near a conclusion; and desired, that
they would not enter upon new business, nor cast any as∣persions
on his government and ministry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. p. 605.</NOTE>. Though the
court endeavoured to explain and soften this message by a
subsequent message<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. i. 610. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 197.</NOTE>; as Charles was apt hastily to correct
any hasty step, which he had taken; it served rather to in∣flame
than appease the commons: As if the method of their
proceeding had here been prescribed to them. It was fore∣seen:,
that a great tempest was ready to burst on the Duke;
and in order to divert it, the King thought proper, upon a
joint application of the lords and commons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 613. Journ. 7 June, 1628. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 201.</NOTE>, to endeavour
the giving them satisfaction, with regard to the petition of
right. He came, therefore, to the house of peers, and
pronouncing the usual form of words, <HI>Let it be law as is
desired,</HI> gave full sanction and authority to the petition.
The acclamations, with which the house refounded, and
the universal joy diffused over the nation, showed how
much this petition had been the object of all mens vows
and expectations<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 613.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be affirmed, without any exaggeration, that the
King's assent to the petition of right produced such a change
in the government, as was almost equivalent to a revolu∣tion;
and by circumscribing, in so many articles, the royal
prerogative, gave additional security to the liberties of the
subject. Yet were the commons far from being satisfied
with this important concession. Their ill humour had been
so much irritated by the King's frequent evasions and de∣lays,
that it could not be presently appeased by an assent,
which he allowed to be so ungracefully extorted from him.
Perhaps too, the popular leaders, implacable and artful,
<PB N="197" REF="238"/>
saw the opportunity favourable; and turning against the
King those very weapons, with which he had furnished
them, resolved to pursue the victory. The bill, however,
for five subsidies, which had been formerly voted, immedi∣ately
passed the house; because the granting that supply
was, in a manner, tacitly contracted for, upon the royal
assent to the petition; and had faith been here violated, no
farther confidence could have subsisted between King and
parliament. Having made this concession, the commons
continued to carry their scrutiny into every part of govern∣ment.
In some particulars, their industry was laudable; in
some, it was liable to censure.</P>
<P>A LITTLE after writs were issued for summoning this par∣liament,
a commission had been granted to Sir Thomas
Coventry, lord keeper, the Earl of Marlborough, high
treasurer, the Earl of Manchester, lord president
of the council, the Earl of Worcester, privy seal, the Duke of
Buckingham, high admiral, and all the considerable offi∣cers
of the crown, in the whole thirty-three. By this com∣mission,
which, from the number of persons named in it,
could be no secret, the coimmissioners were empowered to
meet, and to concert among themselves the methods of le∣vying
money by impositions, or otherwise; <HI>Where form and
circumstance,</HI> as expressed in the commission, <HI>must be dis∣pensed
with, rather than the susbtance be lost or hazarded</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 614. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 214</NOTE>.
In other words, this was a scheme for finding expedients,
which might raise the prerogative to the greatest height,
and render parliaments intirely useless. The commons ap∣plied
for cancelling the commission<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3 june, 1628.</NOTE>; and were, no doubt,
desirous, that all the world should conclude the King's
principles to be extremely arbitrary, and should observe
what little regard he was disposed to pay to the liberties and
privileges of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="239"/>
A COMMISSION had likewise been granted, and some
money remitted, in order to raise a thousand German horse,
and transport them into England. These were supposed to be
levied, in order to support the projected impositions or ex∣ercises;
though the number seems very insufficient for such
a purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 612.</NOTE>. The house took notice of this design in very se∣vere
terms: And no measure, surely, could be projected more
generally odious to the whole nation. It must, however,
be confessed, that the King was so far right, that he had,
now at last, fallen on the only effectual method of support∣ing
his prerogative. But at the same time, he should have
been sensible, that, till provided of a sufficient military
force, all his attempts, in opposition to the rising spirit
of the nation, must, in the end, prove intirely fruitless; and
that the higher he screwed up the springs of government,
while he had so little real power to retain them in that forced
situation, with more fatal violence must they fly out, when
any accident occurred to restore them to their natural ac∣tion.</P>
<P>THE commons next resumed their censure of Bucking∣ham's
conduct and behaviour, against whom they were im∣placable.
They agreed to present a remonstrance to the
King, in which they recapitulated all national grievances
and misfortunes, and omitted no circumstance, which
could render the whole administration despicable and odious.
The compositions with catholics, they said, amounted to
no less than a toleration, hateful to God, full of dishonour
and disprofit to his Majesty, and of extreme scandal and
grief to his good people: They took notice of the viola∣tions
of liberty above-mentioned, against which the peti∣tion
of right seems to have provided a sufficient remedy:
They mentioned the decay of trade, the unsuccessful expe∣ditions
to Cadiz and the isle of Rhé, the encouragement
given to Arminians, the commission for transporting Ger∣man
<PB N="199" REF="240"/>
horse, that for levying new impositions; and all these
grievances they ascribed solely to the ill conduct of the Duke
of Buckingham<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 619. Parl. Hist. vol. viii, p. 219, 220, &amp;c.</NOTE>. This remonstrance was, perhaps, not
the less provoking to Charles, that, joined to the extreme
acrimony of the subject, there were preserved in it, as in
most of the protestations and remonstrances of that age, an
affected civility and submission in the language.</P>
<P>IT was not without good grounds, that the commons
were so fierce and assuming. Though they had already
granted the King the supply of five subsidies, they still re∣tained
a pledge in their hands, which, they thought, en∣sured
them success in all their applications, Tonnage and
poundage had not yet been granted by parliament; and the
commons had artfully,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prorogation, 26 of June.</NOTE> this session, concealed their inten∣tion
of invading that branch of revenue, till the royal as∣sent
had been obtained to the petition of right, which they
justly esteemed of such importance. They then openly as∣serted,
that the levying tonnage and poundage without con∣sent
of parliament, was a palpable violation of all the an∣tient
liberties of the people, and an open infringement of
the petition of right, so lately granted<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 628. Journ. 18, 20 June, 1628.</NOTE>. The King, in
order to prevent the finishing and presenting this remon∣strance,
came suddenly to the parliament, and ended this
session by a prorogation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 26 June, 1628.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEING freed, for some time, from the embarrassment of
this assembly, Charles began to look towards foreign wars,
where all his efforts were equally unsuccessful, as in his do∣mestic
government. The Earl of Denbigh, brother-in-law
to Buckingham, was dispatched to the relief of Rochelle,
now closely besieged by land, and threatened with a
blockade by sea: But he returned without effecting any
<PB N="200" REF="241"/>
thing; and having declined to attack the enemy's fleet, he
brought on the English arms the imputation, either of coward∣ice
or ill conduct. In order to repair this dishonour, the Duke
went to Portsmouth, where he had prepared a considerable
fleet and army, on which all the subsidies, given by par∣liament,
had been expended. This supply had very much
disappointed the King's expectations. The same mutinous
spirit, which prevailed in the house of commons, had dif∣fused
itself over the nation; and the commissioners, ap∣pointed
for making the assessments, had connived at all
frauds, which might diminish the supply, and reduce the
crown to still greater necessities. This national discontent,
communicated to a desperate enthusiast, soon broke out in an
event, which may be considered as very remarkable.</P>
<P>THERE was one Felton, of a good family, but of an
ardent, melancholic temper, who had served under the Duke,
in the station of lieutenant. His captain being killed in
the retreat at the isle of Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Felton had sollicited for the
company; and when disappointed, he threw up his com∣mission,
and retired in discontent from the army. While
private resentment was boiling in his sullen, unsociable mind,
he heard the nation refound with complaints against the
Duke; and he met with the remonstrance of the commons,
in which his enemy was represented as the cause of every
national grievance, and as the great enemy of the public.
Religious fanaticism farther inflamed thes vindictive reflec∣tions;
and he fancied, that he should do heaven acceptable
service, if, at one blow, he dispatched this dangerous foe
to religion and to his country<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">May's Hist. of the Parliam, p. 10.</NOTE>. Full of these dark views,
he secretly arrived at Portsmouth, at the same time with
the Duke, and watched for an opportunity of effecting his
bloody purpose.</P>
<P>BUCKINGHAM had been engaged in conversation with
Soubize and other French gentlemen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Aug.</NOTE> and a difference of
<PB N="201" REF="242"/>
sentiments having arisen, the dispute, though conducted
with temper and decency, had produced some of those ve∣hement
gesticulations and lively exertions of voice, in which
that nation, more than the English, are apt to indulge
themselves. The conversation being finished, the Duke
drew towards the door; and in that passage, turning him∣self
to speak to Sir Thomas Fryar, a colonel in the army,
he was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Bucking∣ham.</NOTE> on the sudden, over Sir Thomas's shoulder, struck
upon the breast with a knife. Without uttering other
words than <HI>The villain has killed me;</HI> in the same moment,
pulling out the knife, he breathed his last.</P>
<P>No man had seen the blow, nor the person who gave it;
but in the confusion, every one made his own conjecture;
and all agreed, that the murder had been committed by the
French gentlemen, whose angry tone of voice had been
heard, while their words had not been understood, by the
bystanders. In the hurry of revenge, they had instantly
been put to death, had they not been saved by some of
more temper and judgment, who, though they had the
same opinion of their guilt, thought proper to reserve them
for a judicial trial and examination.</P>
<P>NEAR the door, there was found a hat, in the inside of
which was sowed a paper, containing four or five lines of
that remonstrance of the commons, which declared Bucking∣ham
an enemy to the kingdom; and under these lines was a
short ejaculation or attempt towards a prayer. It was easily
concluded that this hat belonged to the assassin: But the dif∣ficulty
still remained, <HI>Who that person should be?</HI> For the
writing discovered not the. name; and whoever he was, it
was natural to believe, that he had already fled far enough,
not to be found without a hat.</P>
<P>IN this hurry, a man without a hat was seen walking
very composedly before the door. One crying out, <HI>Here
is the fellow, who killed the Duke;</HI> every body ran to ask,
<HI>Which is he?</HI> The man very sedately answered, <HI>I am he.</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="243"/>
The more furious immediately rushed upon him with draw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
swords: Others, more deliberate, defended and protected
him: He himself, with open arms, very calmly and chear∣fully
exposed his breast to the swords of the most enraged;
being willing to fall a sudden sacrifice to their anger, rather
than be reserved for that public justice, which he knew
must be executed upon him.</P>
<P>HE was now known to be that Felton, who had served
in the army. Being carried into a private room, it was
thought proper so far to dissemble as to tell him, that Buck∣ingham
was only grievously wounded, but not without
hopes of recovery. Felton smiled, and told them, that
the Duke, he knew full well, had received a blow, which
had terminated all their hopes. When asked, at whose insti∣gation
he had performed that horrid deed? He answered,
that they needed not to trouble themselves in that inquiry;
that no man living had credit enough with him to have dis∣posed
him to such an action; that he had not even entrust∣ed
his purpose to any one; that the resolution proceeded
only from himself and the impulse of his own conscience;
and that his motives would appear, if his hat was found;
For that, believing he would perish in the attempt, he had
there taken care to explain them<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 27, 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN the King was informed of this assassination, he
received the news in public with an unmoved and undis∣turbed
countenance; and the courtiers, who studied his
looks, concluded, that secretly he was not displeased to be
rid of a minister, so generally odious to the nation<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 34.</NOTE>. But
Charles's command of himself proceeded intirely from the
gravity and composure of his temper. He was still, as much
as ever, attached to his favoruite; and, during his whole
life, he retained an affection for Buckingham's friends, and
a prejudice against his enemies. He urged too, that Felton
<PB N="203" REF="244"/>
should be put to the question, in order to extort from him
a discovery of his accomplices: But the judges declared,
that, though that practice had been formerly very usual, it
was altogether illegal. So much more exact reasoners, with
regard to law, had they become, from the jealous scruples
of the house of commons.</P>
<P>MEAN while the distress of Rochelle had risen to the ut∣most
extremity. That vast genius of Richlieu, which
made him form the greatest enterprizes, led him to attempt
their execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Oct.</NOTE> by means equally great and extraordinary.
In order to deprive Rochelle of all succour, he had dared
to project the throwing cross the harbour a mole of a mile's

project, he now held the town closely blockaded on all sides.
The inhabitants, though pressed with the greatest rigours of
famine, still refused to submit; being supported, partly by
the lectures of their zealous preachers, partly by the daily
hopes of assistance from England. After Buckingham's death,
the command of the fleet and army was conferred on
the Earl of Lindesey; who arriving before Rochelle, made
some attempts to break through the mole, and force his
way into the town: But by the delays of the English, that
work was now fully finished and fortified; and the Ro∣chellers,
finding their last hopes to fail them, were reduced
to surrender at discretion, even in sight of the English
admiral. Of fifteen thousand persons, who had been shut up
in the town, four thousand alone survived the fatigues and
famine, which they had undergone<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 636.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS was the first necessary step towards the prosperity
of France. Foreign enemies, as well as domestic factions,
being deprived of this resource, that kingdom began now
to shine forth in its full splendor. By a steddy prosecution
of wife plans, both of war and policy, it gradually gained

an ascendant over the rival power of Spain; and every or∣der
of the state, and every sect, were reduced to pay sub∣mission
to the lawful authority of the sovereign. The vic∣tory,
however, over the hugonots was, at first, pushed by
the French King with great moderation. A toleration was
still continued to them; the only avowed and open tole∣ration,
which, at that time, was granted in any European kingdom.</P>

taken notice of: Sibthorpe and Cosins, two clergymen,

Montague, who had been censured for moderation to the
catholics, the greatest of crimes, had been created bishop
of Chichester. They found, likewise, upon inquiry, that
all the copies of the petition of right, which were dispersed,
had, by the King's orders, annexed to them the first an∣swer,
which had given so little satisfaction to the commons<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 216. Rush. vol. i. p. 643.</NOTE>.

ears, by a discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the star∣chamber<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. p. 216. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 246.</NOTE>.
So apt were they on their part, to stretch the
petition into such consequences as might deprive the crown
of powers, which, from immemorial custom, were sup∣posed
inherent in it.</P>
<P>BUT the great article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tonnage and pound∣age.</NOTE> on which the house of commons
broke with the King, and which finally created in Charles a
disgust to all parliaments, was their claim with regard to
tonnage and poundage. On this occasion, therefore, it is
necessary to give an account of the controversy.</P>
<P>THE duty of tonnage and poundage, in more antient
times, had been commonly a temporary grant of the par∣liament;
but it had been conferred on Henry V. and all the
succeeding princes, during life, in order to enable them to
maintain a naval force for the protection of the kingdom.
The necessity of levying this duty had been so apparent,
that each King had ever claimed it from the moment of his
accession; and the first parliament of each reign had ever
by vote conferred on the prince what they found him al∣ready
in possession of. Agreeable to the inaccurate genius
of the old constitution, this abuse, however considerable,
had never been perceived nor remedied; though nothing
could have been easier than for the parliament to have pre∣vented
it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 339, 340.</NOTE>. By granting this duty to each prince, during his
own life, and, for a year after his decease, to the successor,
all his inconveniences had been obviated; and yet the duty
had never, for a moment, been levied without proper au∣thority.
But contrivances of that nature were not thought
of during those rude ages: And as so complicated and jealous
a government as the English cannot subsist without many
such refinements; it is easy to see, how favourable every
inaccuracy must formerly have proved to royal autho∣rity,
which, on all emergencies, was obliged to supply,
<PB N="206" REF="248"/>
by discretionary power, the great deficiency of the laws.</P>
<P>THE parliament did not grant the duties of tonnage and
poundage to Henry VIII. till the sixth year of his reign:
Yet this prince, who had not then raised his power to its
greatest height, continued, during that whole time, to levy
these duties: The parliament, in their very grant, blame
the merchants, who had neglected to make payment to the
crown; and though some expressions of that bill seem am∣biguous
and equivocal, they employ the plainest terms in
calling tonnage and poundage the King's due, even before
they were conferred on him by parliamentary authority<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">6 Henry VIII. cap. 14.</NOTE>.
Four reigns, and above a whole century, were since elapsed;
and these duties had still been levied before they were
voted by parliament. So long had this inaccuracy conti∣nued,
without being remarked or corrected!</P>
<P>DURING that short interval, which elapsed, between
Charles's accession and his first parliament, he had followed
the example of his predecessors; and no fault was found
with his conduct in this particular. But what was most
remarkable in the proceedings of that house of commons,
and what proved beyond controversy, that they had seri∣ously
formed a plan for reducing their prince to dependence,
was, that, instead of granting this supply during the King's
life, as it had been enjoyed by all his immediate prede∣cessors,
they voted it only for a year; and, after that should
be elapsed, reserved to themselves the power of renewing or
refusing the same concession<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Journ. 5 July, 1625.</NOTE>. But the house of peers, who
saw that this duty was now become more necessary than
ever to supply the growing necessities of the crown, and
who did not approve of this encroaching spirit of the com∣mons,
rejected the bill; and the dissolution of that par∣liament
followed so soon after, that no attempt seems to
<PB N="207" REF="249"/>
have been made for the obtaining tonnage and poundage in
any other form<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reason assigned by Sir Philip Warwick, p. 2. for this unusual mea∣sure of the commons, is, that they intended to deprive the crown of the pre∣rogative, which it had assumed, of varying the rates of the impositions, and at the same time were resolved to cut off the new rates laid on by James. These were considerable diminutions both of revenue and prerogative; and whether they would have there stopt, considering their present disposition, may appear somewhat uncertain. The King, it seems, and the lords, were resolved not to trust them; nor to render a revenue once precarious, which perhaps they might never afterwards be able to get re-established on the old footing.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES, mean while, continued still to levy these du∣ties
by his own authority; and the nation was so accustomed
to this exertion of royal power, that no scruple was at first
entertained of submitting to it. But the succeeding parlia∣ment
excited doubts in every one. The commons made
there some steps towards declaring it illegal to levy tonnage
and poundage without consent of parliament, and they openly
showed their intention of employing this engine, in order
to extort from the crown concessions of the most important
nature. But Charles was not yet sufficiently tamed to com∣pliance;
and the abrupt dissolution of that parliament, as
above related, put an end, for the time, to their farther
pretensions.</P>
<P>THE following interval, between the second and third
parliament, was distinguished by so many exertions of pre∣rogative,
that men had little leisure to attend to this affair of
tonnage and poundage, where the abuse of power in the
crown might seem to be of a more disputable nature. But
after the commons, during the precedent session, had reme∣died
all these grievances by means of their petition of right,
which was become so necessary; they afterwards proceeded
to take this matter into consideration, and they showed the
same intention, as formerly, of exacting, in return for the
grant of this revenue, very large compliances on the part
of the crown. Their sudden prorogation prevented them
from bringing their pretensions to a full conclusion.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="250"/>
WHEN Charles opened this session, he had foreseen that
the same controversy would arise; and he therefore took
care, very early, among many mild and reconciling expres∣sions,
to inform the commons, “That he had not taken
these duties as appertaining to his hereditary prerogative;
but that it ever was, and still is, his meaning to enjoy
them as a gift of his people: And that, if he had hitherto
levied tonnage and poundage, he pretended to justify
himself only by the necessity of so doing, not by any
right which he assumed<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 644. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 256, 346.</NOTE>.” This concession, which pro∣bably
proceeded from the King's moderate temper, now
freed from the impulse of Buckingham's violent counsels,
might have satisfied the commons, had they entertained no
other view than that of ascertaining their own rights and
privileges. But they carried their pretensions much higher.
They insisted, as a necessary preliminary, that the King should
once intirely desist from levying these duties; after which
they were to take into consideration, how far they would
restore him to the possession of a revenue, of which he had
clearly divested himself. But besides that this extreme
rigour had never been exercised towards any of his prede∣cessors,
and many obvious prejudices must follow the in∣termission
of the customs; there were other reasons, which
deterred Charles from complying with so hard a condition.
It was probable, that the commons might renew their for∣mer
project of making this revenue only temporary, and
thereby reducing their prince to perpetual dependence; they
certainly would cut off all the new impositions which Mary
and Elizabeth, but especially James, had levied, and which
formed no despicable part of the public revenue; and they
openly declared, that they had, at present, many important
pretensions, chiefly with regard to religion; and if compli∣ance
was refused, no supply must be expected from the commons.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="251"/>
IT is easy to see in what an inextricable labyrinth Charles
was now involved. By his own concessions, by the general
principles of the English government, and by the form of
every bill which had granted this duty, tonnage and poundage
was derived entirely from the free gift of the people; and,
by consequence, might be withdrawn at their pleasure. If
unreasonable in their refusal, they still refused nothing but
what was their own. If public necessity required this sup∣ply,
it also required the King's compliance with those con∣ditions
which were the price of obtaining it. Tho' the mo∣tive
of granting it had been the enabling the King to guard
the seas; it did not follow, that, because he guarded the seas,
he was therefore entitled to this revenue, without any farther
formality: since the people had still reserved to themselves
the right of judging how far that service merited such a
supply. But Charles, notwithstanding his public declara∣tion,
was far from assenting to this conclusion, in its full ex∣tent.
The plain consequence, he saw, of all these rigours,
and refinements, and inferences, was, that he, without any
public necessity, and without any default of his own, must
of a sudden, even from his accession, become a magistrate
of a very different nature from any of his predecessors, and
must fall into a total dependence on subjects, over whom
former kings, especially those immediately preceding, had
exercised an authority almost unlimited. Entangled in a
chain of consequences, which he could not easily break,
he was inclined to go higher, and rather deny the first prin∣ciple,
than admit of conclusions which to him appeared so
absurd and unreasonable. Agreeable to the ideas hitherto
entertained both by natives and foreigners, the monarch he
esteemed the essence and soul of the English government;
and whatever other power pretended to annihilate or even
abridge the royal authority, must necessarily, he thought,
either in its nature or exercise, be deemed no better than an
usurpation. Willing to preserve the antient harmony of
<PB N="210" REF="252"/>
the constitution, he had ever intended to comply, as far as
he <HI>easily</HI> could, with the antient forms of administration:
But when these forms appeared to him, by the inveterate
obstinacy of the commons, to have no other tendency than
to disturb that harmony, and to introduce a new constitu∣tion;
he concluded, that, in this violent situation, what
was subordinate must necessarily yield to what was principal,
and the privileges of the people, for a time, give place to
royal prerogative. From the rank of a monarch, to be de∣graded
into a slave of his insolent subjects, seemed, of all
indignities, the greatest; and nothing, in his judgment,
could exceed the humiliation attending such a state, but the
meanness of tamely submitting to it, without making some
efforts to preserve the authority transmitted to him by his
predecessors.</P>
<P>THO' these were his reflections and resolutions before the
parliament assembled, he did not immediately break with
them, upon their delay of voting him this supply. He
thought that he could better justify any strong measure
which he might afterwards be obliged to take, if he allowed
them to carry to the utmost extremity their attacks upon
his government and prerogative<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 642.</NOTE>. He contented himself,
for the present, with soliciting the house by messages and
speeches. But the commons, instead of hearkening to his
solicitations, proceeded to carry their censorial scrutiny into
his management of religion<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 651. Whitlocke, p. 12.</NOTE>, which was the only griev∣ance
to which they had not as yet, by their petition of
right, applied a sufficient remedy.</P>
<P>IT was not possible that this century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arminian∣ism.</NOTE> so fertile in reli∣gious
sects and disputes, could escape the controversy con∣cerning
fatalism and free-will, which, being strongly inter∣woven
both with philosophy and theology, had in all ages
thrown every school and every church into such inextricable
<PB N="211" REF="253"/>
doubt and perplexity. The first reformers in England, as
in other European countries, had embraced the most rigid
tenets of predestination and absolute decrees, and had com∣posed,
upon that system, all the articles of their religious
creed. But these principles having met with opposition
from Arminius and his sectaries, the controversy was soon
brought into this island, and began here to diffuse itself.
The Arminians, finding more encouragement from the su∣perstitious
spirit of the church than from the fanaticism of
the puritans, gradually incorporated themselves with the
former; and some of that sect, by the indulgence of James
and Charles, had attained the highest offices and preferments
in the hierarchy. But their success with the public had not
been altogether answerable to that which they met with in
the church and the court. Throughout the nation, they
still lay under the reproach of innovation and heresy. The
commons now levelled against them their formidable censures,
and made them the objects of daily invective and declama∣tion.
Their protectors were stigmatized; their tenets can∣vassed;
their views represented as dangerous and pernicious.
To impartial spectators surely, if any such had been at that
time in England, it must have given great entertainment, to
see a popular assembly, enflamed with faction and enthu∣siasm,
pretend to handle questions, for which the greatest
philosophers, in the tranquillity of retreat, had never hi∣therto
been able to find any satisfactory solution.</P>
<P>AMIDST that complication of disputes in which men
were involved, we may observe, that the appellation <HI>puritan</HI>
stood for three parties, which, though commonly united to∣gether,
were yet actuated by very different views and mo∣tives.
There were the political puritans, who maintained
the highest principles of civil liberty; the puritans in disci∣pline,
who were averse to the ceremonies and episcopal go∣vernment
of the church; and the doctrinal puritans, who
rigidly defended the speculative system of the first reformers.
In opposition to all these stood the court-party, the hierarchy,
<PB N="212" REF="254"/>
and the Arminians; only with this distinction, that the latter
sect, being introduced a few years before, did not as yet
comprehend all those who were favourable to the church
and to monarchy. But, as the controversies on every sub∣ject
grew daily warmer, men united themselves more inti∣mately
with their friends, and separated themselves wider
from their antagonists; and the distinction gradually be∣came
quite uniform and regular.</P>
<P>THIS house of commons, which, like all the preceding
ones during the reigns of James and Charles, and even of
Elizabeth, had been much governed by the puritanical
party, thought that they could not better serve their cause,
than by stigmatizing and punishing the Arminian sect, which,
introducing an innovation in the church, were the least fa∣voured
and least powerful of all their antagonists. From
this measure, it was easily foreseen, that, besides gratifying
the animosity of the doctrinal puritans, both the puritans
in discipline and those in politics would reap considerable
advantages. Laud, Neile, Montague, and other bishops,
who were the chief supporters of episcopal government,
and the most zealous partizans of the discipline and cere∣monies
of the church, were all supposed to be tainted with
Arminianism. The same men and their disciples were the
strenuous preachers of passive obedience, and of entire sub∣mission
to princes; and if these could once be censured,
and be expelled the church and court, it was concluded,
that the hierarchy would receive a mortal blow, the cere∣monies
be less rigidly insisted on, and the King, deprived
of his most faithful friends, be obliged to abate those high
claims of prerogative on which at present he insisted.</P>
<P>BUT Charles, besides a view of the political consequences
which must result from a compliance with such pretensions,
was strongly determined, from principles of piety and con∣science,
to oppose them. Neither the dissipation incident
to youth, nor the pleasures attending a high fortune, had
<PB N="213" REF="255"/>
been able to prevent this virtuous Prince from embracing
the most sincere sentiments of religion; and that character,
which in that religious age ought to have been of infinite
advantage to him, proved in the end the chief cause of his
ruin: Merely because the religion adopted by him was not
of that precise mode and sect which began to prevail among
his subjects. His piety, tho' remote from popery, had a
tincture of superstition in it; and, being averse to the
gloomy spirit of the puritans, was represented by them as
tending towards the abominations of antichrist. Laud also
had unfortunately acquired a great ascendant over him:
And as all those prelates, struck at by the commons, were
regarded as his chief friends and most favoured courtiers;
he was resolved not to disarm and dishonour himself, by
abandoning them to the resentment of his enemies. Being
totally unprovided of military force, and finding a refractory
independent spirit to prevail among the people; the most
solid basis of his authority, he thought, consisted in the
support which he received from the hierarchy.</P>
<P>IN the debates of the commons, which are transmitted to
us, 'tis easy to discern so early some sparks of that enthu∣siastic
fire, which afterwards set the whole nation in com∣bustion.
One Rouse made use of an allusion, which, tho'
very familiar, seems to have been borrowed from the writings
of Lord Bacon. “If a man meet a dog alone,” said he,
“the dog is fearful, tho' never so fierce by nature: But,
if the dog have his master with him, he will set upon
that man, from whom he fled before. This shows, that
lower natures, being backed by higher, increase in cou∣rage
and strength; and certainly man, being backed with
omnipotency, is a kind of omnipotent creature. All
things are possible to him that believes; and where all
things are possible, there is a kind of omnipotency.
Wherefore, let it be the unanimous consent and resolu∣tion
of us all to make a vow and covenant from hence∣forth
<PB N="214" REF="256"/>
to hold fast our God and our religion; and then shall
we henceforth expect with certainty happiness in this
world<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 646. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 260.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>OLIVER CROMWEL, at that time a young man of no
account in the nation, is mentioned in these debates, as comp∣laining
of one, who, he was told, preached flat popery<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 655. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 289.</NOTE>.
'Tis amusing to observe the first words of this fanatical
hypocrite correspond so exactly to his character.</P>
<P>THE enquiries and debates concerning tonnage and
poundage went hand in hand with these theological or me∣taphysical
controversies. The officers of the custom-house
were summoned before the commons, to give an account by
what authority they had seized the goods of merchants who
had refused to pay these duties: The barons of the exche∣quer
were questioned concerning their decrees on that
head<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 654. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 301.</NOTE>. The sheriff of London was com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itted to the Tower
for his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in supporting the officers of the custom∣house:
The goods of Rolles, a merchant, and member of
the house, being seized for his refusal to pay the duties,
complaints were made of this violence, as if it were a breach
of privilege<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 653.</NOTE>: Charles supported his officers in all these
measures; and the quarrel grew every day higher between
him and the commons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 658.</NOTE>. Mention was made in the house
of impeaching Sir Richard Weston, lord treasurer<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 326.</NOTE>; and
the King began to entertain thoughts of finishing the session
by a dissolution.</P>
<P>SIR John Elliot framed a remonstrance against levying
tonnage and poundage without consent of parliament, and
offered it to the clerk to read. It was refused. He read
it himself. The question being then called for, the speaker,
Sir John Finch, said, <HI>That he had a command from the
<PB N="215" REF="257"/>
King to adjourn, and to put no questions</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King's power of adjourning, as well as proroguing the parliament, was scarce ever questioned. In the 19th of the late King, the judges deter∣mined, that the adjournment by the King kept the parliament <HI>in statu quo</HI> until the next sitting; but that then no committees were to meet: But if the adjournment be by the house, then the committees and other matters do continue. Parl. Hist. vol. v. p. 466.</NOTE>. Upon which
he rose and left the chair. The whole house was in an
uproar. The speaker was pushed back into the chair, and
forcibly held in it by Hollis and Valentine, till a short re∣monstrance
was framed, and was passed by acclamation ra∣ther
than by vote. Papists and Arminians were there de∣clared
capital enemies to the commonwealth. Those, who
levied tonnage and poundage, were branded with the same
epithet. And even the merchants, who should voluntarily
pay these duties, were denominated betrayers of English
liberty, and public enemies. The doors being locked, the
gentleman usher of the house of lords, who was sent by
the King, could get no admittance till this remonstrance
was finished. By the King's order, he took the mace from
the table, which ended their proceedings<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 660. Whitlocke, p. 12.</NOTE>. And a few
days after the parliament was dissolved.</P>
<P>THE discontents of the nation ran extremely high, on
account of this violent rupture between the King and par∣liament.
These discontents Charles inflamed by his affecta∣tion
of a severity, which he had not power, nor probably
inclination, to carry to extremity. Sir Miles Hobart,
Sir Peter Heyman, Selden, Coriton, Long, Strode, were com∣mitted
to prison, on account of the last tumult in the house,
which was called sedition<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. i. p. 661, 681. Parl. Hist. vol. viii. p. 354. May, p. 13.</NOTE>. With great difficulty, and
after several delays, they were released; and the law was
generally supposed to be wrested, in order to prolong their
imprisonment. Sir John Elliot, Hollis, and Valentine, were
summoned to their trial in the king's bench, for seditious
speeches and behaviour in parliament; but refusing to an∣swer
<PB N="216" REF="258"/>
before an inferior court for their conduct, as members
of a superior, they were condemned to be imprisoned du∣ring
the King's pleasure, to find sureties for their good be∣haviour,
and to be fined, the two former a thousand pounds
a-piece, the latter five hundred<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. i. p. 684, 691.</NOTE>. This sentence, procured
by the influence of the crown, served only to show the
King's disregard to the privileges of parliament, and to ac∣quire
an immense stock of popularity to the sufferers,
who had so bravely, in opposition to arbitrary power, defended
the liberties of their native country. The commons of
England, tho' an immense body, and possessed of the greatest
part of the national property, were naturally somewhat de∣fenceless;
because of their personal equality and their want
of leaders: But the King's severity, if these illegal prose∣cutions
deserve the name, here pointed out leaders to them,
whose resentment was inflamed, and whose courage was
no-wise daunted, by the hardships which they had under∣gone
in so honourable a cause.</P>
<P>So much did these prisoners glory in their sufferings,
that, though they were promised liberty on that condition,
they would not condescend even to present a petition to the
King, expressing their sorrow for having offended him<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 13.</NOTE>.
They unanimously refused to find sureties for their good
behaviour; and disdained to accept of deliverance on such
easy terms. Nay, Hollis was so industrious to continue his
meritorious distress, that when one offered to bail him, he
would not yield to the rule of court, and be himself bound
with his friend. Even Long, who had actually found sure∣ties
in the chief justice's chamber, declared in court, that
his sureties should no longer continue<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ken∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et, vol. iii. p. 49.</NOTE>. Yet because Sir
John Elliot happened to die while in custody, a great cla∣mour
was raised against the administration; and he was
universally regarded as a martyr to the liberties of England<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 440.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THERE now opens to us a new scene. Charles, na∣turally
disgusted with parliaments, was resolved not
to call any more, till he should see greater indications of
a compliant disposition in the nation. Having lost his great
favourite, Buckingham, he became his own minister; and
never afterwards reposed in any one such unlimited confi∣dence.
As he chiefly follows his own genius and disposi∣tion,
his measures are henceforth less rash and hasty; tho'
the general tenor of his administration still wants somewhat
of being intirely legal, and more of being intirely prudent.</P>
<P>WE shall endeavour to exhibit a just idea of the events
which followed for some years; so far as they regard foreign
affairs, the state of the court, and the government of the
nation. The incidents are neither numerous nor illustrious;
but the knowlege of them is necessary for understanding the
subsequent transactions, which are so memorable.</P>
<P>CHARLES, destitute of all supply, was obliged from ne∣cessity
to embrace a measure, which ought to have been the
result of reason and sound policy: He made peace with the
two crowns, against whom he had hitherto waged a war,
which was entered upon without necessity, and was con∣ducted
without glory. Notwithstanding the distracted and
helpless condition of England, no attempt was made, either
<PB N="218" REF="260"/>
by France or Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LII.</NOTE> to invade their enemy; nor did they
entertain any farther project, than to defend themselves
against the feeble and ill-concerted expeditions of that king∣dom.
Pleased that the jealousies and quarrels between King
and parliament had disarmed so formidable a power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with France and Spain. April 14.</NOTE> they
carefully avoided any enterprize which might rouse either
the terror or anger of the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1630.</NOTE> and dispose them to do∣mestic
union and submission. The endeavours to regain
the good-will of the nation were carried so far by the king
of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 5.</NOTE> that he generously released and sent home all the
English prisoners taken in the expedition against Cadiz.
The example was imitated by France, after the retreat of
the English from the isle of Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. When princes were in
such dispositions, and had so few pretensions on each other,
it could not be difficult to conclude a peace. The treaty
was first signed with France<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 23, 24.</NOTE>. The situation of the King's
affairs did not intitle him to demand any conditions for the
hugonots, and they were abandoned to the will of their so∣vereign.
Peace was afterwards concluded with Spain;
where no conditions were made in favour of the Palatine,
except that Spain promised in general to use her good offices
for his restoration<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 75. Whitlocke, p. 14.</NOTE>. The influence of these two wars on
domestic affairs, and on the dispositions of King and people,
was of the utmost consequence: But no alteration was made
by them on the foreign interests of the kingdom.</P>
<P>NOTHING more happy can be imagined than the situa∣tion
in which England then stood with regard to foreign
affairs. Europe was divided between the rival families of
Bourbon and Austria, whose opposite interests, and still
more their mutual jealousies, secured the tranquillity of this
island. Their forces were so nearly counterpoised, that no
apprehensions were entertained of any event which could
suddenly disturb the balance of power between them. The
<PB N="219" REF="261"/>
Spanish monarch, deemed the most powerful, lay at greatest
distance; and the English, by that means, possessed the
advantage of being engaged by political motives into a more
intimate union and confederacy with the neighbouring po∣tentate.
The dispersed situation of the Spanish dominions
rendered the naval power of England very formidable to
them, and kept that empire in continual dependence. France,
more vigorous and more compact, was every day rising in
policy and discipline; and reached at last an equality of
power with the house of Austria: But her progress, slow
and gradual, left it still in the power of England, by a
timely interposal, to check her superiority. And thus
Charles, could he have avoided all diffensions with his own
subjects, was in a situation to make himself be courted and
respected by every power in Europe; and, what has scarce
ever since been attained by the princes of this island, he
could either be active with dignity, or neutral with secu∣rity.</P>
<P>A NEUTRALITY was embraced by the King; and, du∣ring
the rest of his reign, he seems to have little regarded
foreign affairs, except so far as he was engaged by honour,
and by friendship for his sister and the Palatine, to endea∣vour
the procuring some relief for that unhappy family. He
joined his good offices to those of France, and mediated a
peace between the kings of Sweden and Poland, in hopes of
engaging the former to embrace the protection of the op∣pressed
protestants in the empire. This was the famous
Gustavus, whose heroic genius, seconded by the wisest po∣licy,
made him in a little time the most distinguished mon∣arch
of the age, and rendered his country, formerly un∣known
and neglected, of great weight in the balance of
Europe. To encourage and assist him in his projected in∣vasion
of Germany, Charles agreed to furnish him with six
thousand men; but, that he might preserve the appearance
of neutrality, he made use of the Marquis of Hamilton's
<PB N="220" REF="262"/>
name, a nobleman allied to the crown<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. i. p. 46, 53, 62, 83.</NOTE>. Hamilton entered
into an engagement with Gustavus; and, inlisting these
troops in England and Scotland at Charles's expence, he
landed them in the Elbe. The decisive battle of Leipsic
was fought soon after; where the conduct of Tilly and
the valour of the imperialists, were overcome by the supe∣rior
conduct of Gustavus and the superior valour of the
Swedes. What remained of this hero's life was one conti∣nued
series of victory, for which he was less beholden to
fortune, than to those personal endowments which he de∣rived
from nature and from industry. That rapid progress
of conquest, which we so much admire in antient history,
was here renewed in modern annals; and without that
cause, to which, in former ages, it had ever been owing.
Military nations were not now engaged against an undisci∣plined
and unwarlike people; nor heroes set in opposition
to cowards. The veteran troops of Ferdinand, conducted
by the most celebrated generals of the age, were foiled in
every encounter, and all Germany was over-run in an instant
by the victorious Swede. But by this extraordinary and
unexpected success of his ally, Charles failed of the purpose
for which he framed the alliance. Gustavus, elated by pro∣sperity,
began to form more extensive plans of ambition;
and in freeing Germany from the yoke of Ferdinand, he in∣tended
to reduce it to subjection under his own. He re∣fused
to restore the Palatine to his principality, except on con∣ditions
which would have kept him in total dependence<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 415.</NOTE>.
And thus the negotiation was protracted; till the battle of
Lutzen, where the Swedish monarch perished in the midst
of a complete victory, which he obtained over his ene∣mies.</P>
<P>WE have carried on these transactions a few years beyond
the present period, that we might not be obliged to return
<PB N="221" REF="263"/>
to them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the court and ministry.</NOTE> nor be henceforth interrupted in our account of
Charles's court and kingdoms.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider Charles as presiding in his court, as
associated with his family, it is difficult to imagine a cha∣racter
at once more respectable and more amiable. A kind
husband, an indulgent father, a gentle master, a stedfast
friend; to all these eulogies, his conduct in private life
fully intitled him. As a monarch too, in the exterior quali∣ties,
he excelled; in the essential, he was not defective. His
address and manner, tho' perhaps inclining a little towards
stateliness and formality, in the main corresponded to his high
rank, and gave grace to that reserve and gravity which were
natural to him. The moderation and equity, which shone
forth in his temper, <HI>seemed</HI> to secure him against rash and
dangerous enterprizes: The good sense, which he displayed
in his discourse and conversation, <HI>seemed</HI> to warrant his suc∣cess
in every reasonable undertaking. Other endowments
likewise he enjoyed, which, in a private gentleman, would
have been highly ornamental, and which, in a great mon∣arch,
might have proved extremely useful to his people.
He was possessed of an excellent taste in all the fine arts;
and the love of painting was in some degree his favourite
passion. Learned beyond what is common in princes, he
was a good judge of writing in others, and possessed, him∣self,
no mean talent in composition. In any other age or
nation, this monarch had been secure of a prosperous and
a happy reign. But the high idea of his own authority,
with which he had been imbued, made him incapable of
giving way to the spirit of liberty which began to prevail
among his subjects. His politics were not supported with
such vigour and foresight as might enable him to subdue
their privileges, and maintain his prerogative at the high
pitch to which it had been raised. And above all, the spirit
of enthusiasm, being universally diffused over the nation,
disappointed all the views of human prudence, and dif∣turbed
<PB N="222" REF="264"/>
the operation of every motive which usually influ∣ence
society.</P>
<P>BUT the misfortunes, produced by these causes, were
yet remote, Charles now enjoyed himself in the full exer∣cise
of his authority, in a social intercourse with his friends
and courtiers, and in a moderate use of those pleasures
which he most affected.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Buckingham,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the Queen.</NOTE> who had somewhat alienated Charles from the Queen, she is to be considered
as his chief friend and favourite. That rustic contempt
of the fair sex, which James affected, and which, banish∣ing
them from his court, made it resemble more a fair or
an exchange, than the feat of a great prince, was very wide
of the disposition of this monarch. But tho' full of com∣plaisance
to the whole sex, Charles reserved all his passion
for the Queen, to whom he attached himself with unshaken
fidelity and confidence. By her sense and spirit, as well as
by her beauty, she justified the fondness of her husband;
tho' it is allowed, that, being somewhat of a passionate
temper, she precipitated him into hasty and imprudent coun∣sels.
Her religion likewise, to which she was much ad∣dicted,
must be regarded as a great misfortune; since it
augmented the jealousy which prevailed against the court,
and engaged her to procure for the catholics some in∣dulgences
which were generally distasseful to the nation<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">May, p. 21.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the former situation of the English government, when
the sovereign was in a great measure independent of his sub∣jects,
the King chose his ministers, either from personal
favour, or from an opinion of their ability; without any
regard to their parliamentary interest or talents. It has
since been the maxim of princes, where-ever popular leaders
encroach too much on royal authority, to confer offices on
them; in expectation that they will afterwards become
<PB N="223" REF="265"/>
more careful not to diminish that power which has become
their own. These politics were now embraced by Charles;
a sure proof that a secret revolution had happened in the
constitution, and had necessitated the prince to adopt new
maxims of government<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Sir Ed. Walker, p. 328.</NOTE> But the views of the King were
at this time so repugnant to those of the puritans, that the
leaders, whom he gained, lost from that moment all interest
with their party, and were even pursued as traitors, with
implacable hatred and resentment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strafford</NOTE> This was the case with
Sir Thomas Wentworth, whom the King created, first a
baron, then a viscount, and afterwards earl of Strafford;
made him president of the council of York, and Lord de∣puty
of Ireland; and regarded him as his chief minister and
counsellor. By his eminent talents and abilities, Strafford
merited all the confidence which the King reposed in him:
His character was stately and austere; more fitted to pro∣cure
esteem than love: His sidelity to his master was un∣shaken;
but as he now employed all his counsels to support
the prerogative which he had formerly bent all his endea∣vours
to diminish, his virtue seems not to have been intirely
pure, but to have been susceptible of strong impressions
from private interest and ambition, Sir Dudley Digges was
about the same time created master of the rolls: Noy, at∣torney-general:
Littleton, sollicitor-general. All these had
been likewise parliamentary leaders; and were men very
eminent in their profession<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 13. May, p. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN all ecclesiastical affairs, and even in many civil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laud.</NOTE> Laud,
bishop of London, had great influence on the King. This
man was virtuous, if severity of manners alone and absti∣nence
from pleasure could deserve that name. He was
learned, if polemical knowlege could intitle him to that
praise. He was disinterested, but with unceasing industry
he studied to exalt the priestly and prelatical character, which
was his own. His zeal was unrelenting in the cause of reli∣gion;
<PB N="224" REF="266"/>
that is, in imposing, by the most rigorous measures,
his own tenets and pious ceremonies on the obstinate puri∣tans,
who had prosanely dared to oppose him. In prosecu∣tion
of his holy purposes, he overlooked every human con∣sideration;
or, in other words, the heat and indiscretion
of his temper made him neglect the views of prudence and
rules of good manners. He was in this respect happy, that
all his enemies were also imagined by him the declared ene∣mies
to loyalty and true piety, and that every exercise of
his revenge, by that means, became in his eyes a merit and
a virtue. This was the man who acquired so great an
ascendant over Charles, and who led him, by the facility of
his temper, into a conduct which proved so fatal to him∣self
and to his kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE humour of the nation ran at that time into the ex∣treme
opposite to superstition;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Innovations in the church.</NOTE> and it was with difficulty
that the antient ceremonies, to which men had been accus∣tomed,
and which had been sanctified by the practice of
the first reformers, could be retained in divine service:
Yet was this the time which Laud chose for the introduction
of new ceremonies and observances. Besides that these were
sure to displease as innovations, there lay, in the opinion of
the public, another very forcible objection against them,
Laud, and the other prelates who embraced his measures,
were generally well instructed in sacred antiquity, and had
adopted all those religious sentiments which prevailed during
the fourth and fifth centuries; when the christian church,
as is well known, was already sunk into those superstitions
which, were afterwards continued and augmented by the po∣licy
of Rome. The revival, therefore, of the ideas and
practices of that age could not fail of giving the English
faith and liturgy some resemblance to the catholic supersti∣tion,
which the kingdom in general, and the puritans in
particular, held in the greatest horror and detestation. Men
also were apt to think, that, without some secret purpose,
<PB N="225" REF="267"/>
such insignificant observances would not be imposed with
such unrelenting zeal on the refractory spirit of the nation;
and that Laud's scheme was to lead back the English, by
gradual steps, to the religion of their ancestors. They
considered not, that the very insignisicancy of these
ceremonies recommended them to the superstitious prelate, and
made them appear the more peculiarly sacred and religious,
that they could serve no other purpose. Nor was the re∣semblance
to the Romish ritual any objection, but rather a
merit, with Laud and his brethren; who bore a much
greater kindness to the mother-church, as they called her,
than to the sectaries and presbyterians, and frequently re∣commended
her as a true christian church; an appellation
which they refused, or at least scrupled, to the others<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">May, p. 25.</NOTE>. So
openly were these tenets espoused, that not only the dis∣contented
puritans believed the church of England to be
relapsing fast into Romish superstition: The court of Rome
itself entertained hopes of regaining its authority in this
island; and, in order to forward Laud's good intentions, an
offer was twice made him, in private, of a cardinal's hat,
which he declined accepting<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 190. Welwood, p. 61.</NOTE>. His answer was, as he says
himself, <HI>That something dwelt within him, which would not
suffer his compliance, till Rome was other than it is</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1327. Whitlocks, p. 97.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A COURT lady, daughter of the Earl of Devonshire,
having turned catholic, was asked by Laud the reasons of
her conversion. <HI>'Tis chiefly,</HI> said she, <HI>because I hate to
travel in a crowd.</HI> The meaning of this expression being
demanded, she replied, <HI>I perceive your Grace and many
others are making haste to Rome; and therefore, in order
to prevent my being crowded, I have gone before you.</HI> It
must be confessed, that, tho' Laud deserved not the appel∣lation
of papist, the genius of his religion was, tho' in a
less degree, yet the same with that of the Romish: The
<PB N="226" REF="268"/>
same profound respect was exacted to the sacerdotal cha∣racter,
the same submission required to the creeds and de∣crees
of synods and councils, the same pomp and ceremony
was affected in worship, and the same superstitious regard
to days, postures, meats, and vestments. No wonder, there∣fore,
that this prelate was, every-where, among the puri∣tans,
regarded with horror, as the forerunner of anti∣christ.</P>
<P>As a specimen of the new ceremonies to which Laud
sacrificed his own quiet and that of the nation, it may not
be amiss to relate those which he was accused of employing
in the consecration of St. Catherine's church, and which
were the object of such general scandal and offence.</P>
<P>ON the bishop's approach to the west door of the church,
a loud voice cried, <HI>Open, open, ye everlasting doors, that
the king of glory may enter in!</HI> Immediately the doors of
the church flew open, and the bishop entered. Falling
upon his knees, with eyes elevated and arms expanded, he
uttered these words: <HI>This place is holy; the ground is holy▪
In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, I pronounce
it holy.</HI></P>
<P>GOING towards the chancel, he several times took up
from the floor some of the dust, and threw it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.
When he approached, with his attendants, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar to the
communion-table, he bowed frequently towards it: And on
their return, they went round the church, repeating as they
marched along, some of the psalms: And then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form
of prayer, which concluded with these words: <HI>We conse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
crate this church, and separate it unto thee as holy ground,
not to be profaned any more to common uses.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this, the bishop, standing near the communion∣table,
solemnly pronounced many imprecations upon such
as should afterwards pollute that holy place by musters of
soldiers, or keeping in it profane law-courts, or carrying
<PB N="227" REF="269"/>
burthens, thro' it. On the conclusion of every curse, he
bowed towards the east, and cried, <HI>Let all the people say,
amen.</HI></P>
<P>THE imprecations being all so piously finished, there
were poured out a number of blessings upon such as had
any hand in framing and building that sacred and beautiful
edifice, and on such as had given, or should hereafter give
to it, any chalices, plate, ornaments, or utensils. At every
benediction, he in like manner bowed towards the east, and
cried, <HI>Let all the people say, amen.</HI></P>
<P>THE sermon succeeded; after which, the bishop conse∣crated
and administered the sacrament in the following
manner:</P>
<P>As he approached the communion-table, he made many
lowly reverences: And coming up to that part of the table
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bread and wine lay, he bowed seven times.
After the reading of many prayer's, he approached the sa∣cramental
elements, and gently lifted up the corner of the
napkin, in which the bread was laid. When he beheld
the bread, he suddenly let fall the napkin, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew back a step
or two, bowed three several times towards the bread; then
he drew near again, opened the napkin, and bowed as be∣fore.</P>
<P>NEXT, he laid his hand on the cup, which had a cover
upon it, and was full of wine. He let go the cup, fell
back, and bowed thrice towards it. He approached again;
and lifting up the cover, peeped into the cup. Seeing the
wine, he let fall the cover, started back, and bowed as be∣fore.
Then he received the sacrament, and gave it to others.
And many prayers being said, the solemnity of the conse∣cration
ended. The walls and floor and roof of the fabric
were then supposed to be sufficiently holy<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 76, 77. Welwood, p. 275. Frahklyn, p. 386.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="270"/>
ORDERS were given, and rigorously insisted on, that the
communion‐table should be removed from the middle of the
area, where it hitherto stood in all churches, except in ca∣thedrals<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rushworth vol. ii. p. 207. Whitlocke, p. 24.</NOTE>.
It was placed in the east end, railed in, and de∣nominated
an ALTAR; as the clergyman, who officiated,
received commonly the appellation of PRIEST. 'Tis not
easy to imagine the discontents excited by this innovation,
and the suspicions which it gave rise to.</P>
<P>THE kneeling at the altar, and the using of copes, a
species of embroidered vestment, in administering the sacra∣ment,
were also known to be great objects of scandal, as
being popish practices; But the opposition rather increased
than abated the zeal of the prelate, for the introduction of
these habits and ceremonies.</P>
<P>ALL kinds of ornament, especially pictures, were neces∣sary
for supporting that mechanical devotion, which was
proposed to be raised in this model of religion: But as
these had been so much employed by the church of Rome,
and had given rise to so much superstition, or what the pu∣ritans
called idolatry; it was impossible to introduce them
into English churches, without exciting the most general
murmurs and complaints. But Laud, possessed of present
authority, persisted in his purpose, and made several at∣tempts
towards acquiring these ornaments. Some of the
pictures, introduced by him, were also found, upon in∣quiry,
to be the very same which might be met with in
the mass book. The crucifix too, that eternal consolation
of all pious catholics, and terror to all sound protestants,
was not forgot on this occasion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 272, 273.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was much remarked, that Sherfield, the recorder of
Salisbury, was tried in the star‐chamber, for having broke,
contrary to the bishop of Salisbury's express injunctions, a
painted window of St. Edmond's church in that city. He
<PB N="229" REF="271"/>
boasted, that he had destroyed these monuments of ido∣latry:
But for this effort of his zeal, he was fined <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
pounds, removed from his office, condemned to make a
public acknowlegement and be bound to his good beha∣viour<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 152. State Trials, vol. v. p. 46. Franklyn, p. 410, 411, 412.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOT only such of the clergy, as reglected to observe
every ceremony, were suspended and deprived by the high∣commission
court: Oaths were, by many of the bishops,
imposed on the churchwarden, and they were sworn to
inform against any one who acted contrary to the ecclesiastical
canons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 186.</NOTE> Such a measure, though practised during
the reign of Elizabeth, gave much offence; as resembling
too nearly the practice of the Romish inquifition.</P>
<P>To show the greater alienation from the churches reformed
after the presbyterian model, Laud advised, that the disci∣pline
and worship of the church should be imposed on the
English regiments and trading companies abroad<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p 249. Franklyn, p. 451.</NOTE> All
foreigners of the Dutch and Walloon congregations were
commanded to attend the established church; and indulg∣ence
was granted to none after the children of the first deni∣zens<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 272.</NOTE>
Scudamore too, the king's ambassador at Paris,
had orders to withdraw himself from the communion of the
hugonots. Even men of sense were apt to blame this con∣duct,
not only because it gave offence in England, but be∣cause,
in foreign countries, it lost the crown the advantage
of being considered as, the head and support of the re∣formation.</P>
<P>ON pretence of pacifying disputes, orders were issued
from the council, forbidding, on both sides, all preaching,
and printing with regard to the controverted points of pre∣defination
and free-will. But it was complained of, and
probably with reason, that the impartiality was altogether
<PB N="230" REF="272"/>
confined to the orders, and that the execution of them was
only meant against the calvinists.</P>
<P>IN return for Charles's indulgence towards the church,
Laud and his followers took care to magnify, on every oc∣casion,
the regal authority, and to treat, with the utmost
distain or detestation, all puritanical pretensions to a free
and, independent constitution. But while these prelates
were so liberal in raising the crown at the expence of pub∣lic
liberty, they made no scruple of incroaching, them∣selves,
on the royal rights the most incontestable; in order
to exalt the hierarchy, and procure to their own order do∣minion
and independence. All the doctrines which the
Romish church had borrowed from some of the fathers,
and which freed the spiritual from subordination to the
civil power, were now adopted by the church of England,
and interwoven with her political and religious tenets. A
divine and apostolical charter was insisted on, preferably to
a legal and parliamentary one<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 22.</NOTE>. The sacerdotal character
was magnified as sacred and in indefeizable: All right to spi∣ritual
authority, or even to private judgment in spiritual
subjects, was refused to profane laymen: Ecclesiastical
courts were held by the bishops in their own name, without
any notice taken of the King's authority: And Charles, tho'
extremely jealous of every claim in popular assemblies, seemed
rather to encourage than repress those encroachments of his
clergy. Having felt some sensible inconveniences from the
independent spirit of parliaments, he attached himself in∣tirely
to those who professed a devoted obedience to his
crown and person; nor did he foresee, that the ecclesiastical
power which he exalted, not admitting of any precise
boundary, might in time become more dangerous to public
peace, and no less fatal to royal prerogative than the
other.</P>
<P>So early as the coronation, Laud was the person, accord∣ing
to general opinion, who introduced a novelty, which,
<PB N="231" REF="273"/>
though overlooked by Charles, made a deep impression on
many of the byestanders. After the usual ceremonies,
these words were recited to the King: “ Stand and hold
fast, from henceforth, the place to which you have
been heir by the succession of your forefathers, being
now delivered to you by the authority of Almighty God,
and by the hands of us and all the bishops and servants
of God. And, as you see the clergy to come nearer
the altar than others, so remember, that, in all places
convenient, you give them greater honour; that the
Mediator of God and man may establish you on the
kingly throne, to be a mediator betwixt the clergy and
the laity; and that you may reign for ever with Jesus
Christ, the King of kings, and Lord of lords<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Franklyn, p. 114, Rushworth, vol. i. p. 201.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE principles, which exalted prerogative, were not
entertained by the King, merely as soft and agreeable to
his royal ears: They were also put in practice during all
the time that he ruled without parliaments. Tho' frugal
and regular in his expences, he wanted money for the
support of government; and he levied it, either by the
revival of obsolete laws, or by violations, same more open,
some more disguised, of the privileges of the nation. Tho'
humane and gentle in his temper, he gave way to severities
in the star-chamber and high-commission, which
seemed necessary, in order to support the present model of admi∣nistration,
and repress the rising spirit of liberty through∣out
the kingdom. Under these two heads, may be reduced
all the remarkable transactions of this reign, during some
years: For, in peaceable and prosperous times, where a
neutrality in foreign affairs is observed, scarce any thing
is remarkable, but what is, in some degree, blamed, or
blameable. And, left the hope of relief or protection
from parliament might encourage opposition, Charles issued
a proclamation, in which he declared, “That, whereas,
<PB N="232" REF="274"/>
for several ill ends, the calling again of a parliament is
divulged; though his Majesty has shown, by frequent,
meeting with his people, his love to the use of parlia∣ments:
Yet the late abuse having, for the present,
driven him unwillingly out of that course; he will ac∣count
it presumption for any one to prescribe to him
any time for the calling that assembly<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Parliam. Hist. vol. viii. p. 359. Rushworth, vol. ii. p.</NOTE>” This was ge∣nerally
construed as a declaration, that, during this reign,
no more parliaments were intended to be summoned<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Cla∣rendon, vol. i. p. 4. May, p. 14.</NOTE>
And every measure of the King confirmed a suspicion, so
disagreeable to the generality of the people.</P>
<P>TONNAGE and poundage were continued to, be levied by
the royal authority alone.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Irregular levies of money.</NOTE> The former arbitrary imposi∣tions
were still exacted. Even new impositions were laid
on several kinds of merchandize<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 8. May, p. 16.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE custom-house officers received orders from the
council to enter into any house, warehouse, or cellar; to
search any trunk or chest; and to break any bulk what∣ever;
in default of the payment of customs<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush. ibid. p, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN order to exercise the militia, and keep them in good
order, each county, by an edict of the council, was assessed
in a certain sum, for the entertainment of a muster-master,
appointed, for that service<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COMPOSITIONS were openly made with recusants, and,
the popisn religion became a regular part of the revenue.
This was all the persecution which it underwent during
the reign of Charles<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 11, 12, 13. 247.</NOTE></P>
<P>A COMMISSION was granted for compounding with such
as were possessed of crown- lands upon desective titles;
and, on this pretence, some money was exacted from the
people<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 49.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="275"/>
THERE was a Edward II.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Statutum de militibus.</NOTE> That whoever was
possessed of twenty pounds a year in land, should be ob∣liged,
when summoned, to appear and to receive the order
of knighthood. Twenty pounds, at that time, partly by
the change of denomination, partly by that in the value of
money, were equivalent to 200 in the sixteenth and seven∣teenth
century; and it seemed just, that the King should
not insist strictly on the letter of the law, and oblige people
of so small revenue to accept of that expensive honour.
Edward VI.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rymer, tom. xv. p. 124.</NOTE> and Queen Elizabeth<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. 493, 504.</NOTE> who had both of
them made use of this expedient for raising money, had
summoned only those possessed of forty pounds a year and
upwards to receive knighthood, or compound for their ne∣glect;
and Charles imitated their example, in granting the
same indulgence. Commissioners were appointed for fixing
the rates of composition; and instructions were given to
these commissioners, not to accept of a less sum than would
have been due by the person, upon a tax of three subsidies,
and a half<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii, p. 70, 71, 72. May, p. 16.</NOTE> Nothing proves more plainly, how ill-disposed
the people were to the measures of the crown, than to ob∣serve
that they loudly complained of an expedient founded
on positive statute, and warranted by such recent precedents.
The law was pretended to be obsolete; tho' only one reign
had intervened since the last execution of it.</P>
<P>BARNARD, lecturer of St. Sepulchre's, London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Severities of the star-chamber and high commission.</NOTE> had this
expression in his prayer before sermon; <HI>Lord, open the eyes
of the Queen's Majesty, that she may see Jesus Christ, whom
she has pierced with her infidelity, superstitution, and idolatry.</HI>
He was questioned in the high commission court<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush. ubi sup. p. 32.</NOTE> for this
insult on the queen; but, upon his submission; dismissed.
Leighton, who had wrote libels against the King, the
Queen, the bishops, and the whole administration, was
<PB N="234" REF="276"/>
condemned by a very severe, if not a cruel, sentence; but
the execution of it was suspended for some time, in expecta∣tion
of his submission<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Kennet's compleat history, vol. iii. p. 60, Whitlocke, p. 15.</NOTE>. All the severities, indeed, of this
reign, were exercised against those who triumphed in their
sufferings, who courted persecution, and braved authority:
And, on that account, their punishment may be deemed the
more just, but the less prudent. To have neglected them
intirely, had it been consistent with order and public safety,
had been the wisest measure which could have been, em∣braced;
as perhaps it had been the most severe punishment
which could have been inflicted on these zealots.</P>
<P>IN order to gratify the clergy with a magnificent fabric,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">1631.</NOTE> subscriptions were set on foot, for the repairing and rebuild∣ing
St. Paul's; and the King, by his countenance and ex∣ample,
encouraged this laudable undertaking<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 17.</NOTE>. By order
of the privy-council, St. Gregory's church was removed,
as an impediment to the project of extending and beautify∣ing
the cathedral. Some houses and shops likewise were
pulled down; and compensation was made to the propr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣etors<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 88, 89, 90. 207, 462, 718.</NOTE>
As there was no immediate prospect of assembling
a parliament, such acts of power in the King became ne∣cessary;
and in no former age would the people have en∣tertained
any scruple with regard to them. It must be re∣marked,
that the puritans were extremely averse to the
raising this ornament to the capital. It favoured, as they
pretended, of popish superstition.</P>
<P>AN office was erected for the sealing of cards: A new
tax, which, of itself, was liable to no objection; but was
of the most dangerous consequence, when considered as ar∣bitrary
and illegal<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 103.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MONOPOLIES were revived; an oppressive method of le∣vying
taxes, being unlimited as well as destructive of in∣dustry.
<PB N="235" REF="277"/>
The last parliament of James, which abolished
monopolies, had left a very equitable exception in favour of
new inventions; and on pretence of these, and of erecting
new companies and corporations, was this grievance now
renewed. The manufacture of soap was given to a com∣pany,
who paid a. sum for their patent<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 136, 142, 189, 252.</NOTE> Leather, salt,
and many other commodities, even down to linen rags, were
likewise put under restrictions.</P>
<P>'TIS affirmed by Clarendon, that so little benefit was
reaped from these projects, that of 200,000 pounds levied
from the people scarce 1500 came into the King's coffers.
Tho' we ought not to suspect the noble historian of exag∣gerations
to the disadvantage of Charles's measures; this
fact, it must be owned, appears incredible. The same au∣thor
adds, that the King's intention was to teach his subjects
how unthristy a thing it was to refuse reasonable supplies to
the crown. An imprudent project! to offend a whole na∣tion,
under the view of punishment; and to hope, by acts
of violence, to break their refractory spirits, without being
possessed of any forces to prevent resistance.</P>
<P>THE council of York had been first erected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1632.</NOTE> after a re∣bellion,
by a patent from Henry VIII. without any auth∣ority
of parliament; and this exercise of power, like many
others, was indulged to that arbitrary monarch. That
council had long acted chiefly as a criminal court; but, be∣sides
some innovations, introduced by James, Charles thought
proper, some time after Wentworth was made president, to
extend its powers, and to give it a large civil jurisdiction,
and that, in some respects, discretionary<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid, p. 158, 159, &amp;c. Franklyn, p. 412.</NOTE> 'Tis not impro∣bable,
that the King's intention was only to prevent incon∣veniences,
which arose from the bringing every cause, from
the most distant parts of the kingdom, into Westminster∣hall:
<PB N="236" REF="278"/>
hall: But the consequence, in the mean time, of this mea∣sure,
was the putting all the northern counties out of the
protection of ordinary law, and the subjecting them to an
authority somewhat arbitrary. Some irregular acts of that
council were, this year, complained of<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rashworth, vol. ii, p, 202, 203.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE court of star-chamber extended very far its autho∣rity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1633.</NOTE> and it was matter of complaint, that it encroached
upon the jurisdiction of the other courts; imposing heavy
fines and inslicting severe punishment, beyond the usual
course of justice. Sir David Foulis was fined 5000 pounds,
chiefly because he had dissuaded a friend from compounding
with die commissioners of knighthood<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 215, 216, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRYNNE, a barrister of Lincoln's-Inn, had wrote an
enormous quarto of a thousand pages, which he called
<HI>Historio-Mastyx.</HI> Its professed pnrpose was to decry stage∣plays,
comedies, interludes, music, dancing; but the au∣thor
likewise took occasion to declaim against hunting, pub∣lic
festivals, Christmas-keeping, bonfires, and May-poles.
His zeal against all these levities, he says, was first moved, by
observing, that plays sold better than the choicest sermons,
and that they were frequently printed on finer paper than
the Bible itself. Besides, that the players were often pa∣pists,
and desperately wicked; the play-houses, he affirms,
are Satan's chapels, the play-haunters little better than in∣carnate
devils; and so many steps in a dance, so many paces
to hell. The chief crime of Nero he represents to have
been, his frequenting and acting of plays; and those, who
nobly conspired his death, were principally moved to it, as
he affirms, by their indignation at that enormity. The rest
of his thousand pages were of a like strain. He had obtained
a licence from Archbishop Abbot's chaplain; yet was he in∣dicted
in the star-chamber as a libeller. It was thought
somewhat hard, that general invectives against plays, should
<PB N="237" REF="279"/>
be interpreted into satires against the King and Queen,
merely because they frequented these amusements, and be∣cause
the Queen sometimes acted a part in pastorals and in∣terludes,
which were represented at court. The author, it
must be owned, had, in plainer terms, blamed the hierar∣chy,
the ceremonies, the innovations in religious worship,
and the new superstitions, introduced by Laud<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The music in the churches, he affirmed not to be the noise of men, but a bleating of brute beasts; choiristers bellow the tenor, as it were oxen; bark a counterpart, as it were a kennel of dogs; roar out a treble, as it were a sort of bulls; and grunt out a base, as it were a number of hogs: Christmas, as it is kept, is the devil's Christmas; and he employed a great number of pages to persuade men to asfect the name of <HI>Puritan,</HI> as if Christ were a puritan; and so he saith in his Index, Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 223.</NOTE>; and this
probably, together with the obstinacy and petulance of his
behaviour before the star-chamber, was the reason why his
sentence was so severe. He was condemned to be put from
the bar; to stand on the pillory in two places, Westminster
and Cheapside; to lose both his ears, one in each place;
to pay 5000 pounds fine to the King; and to be imprisoned
during life<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. ibid, p. 220, 221, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS same Prynne was a great hero among the puritans;
and it was chiefly with a view to mortify that sect, that, tho'
of an honourable profession, he was condemned by the star∣chamber
to so ignominious a punishment. The thorough∣paced
puritans were distinguishable by the sourness and au∣sterity
of their manners, and by their aversion to all pleasure
and society<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 2.</NOTE>. To inspire them with better humour, was
certainly, both for their own sake and that of the public,
a very laudable intention in the court; but whether pillo∣ries,
fines, and prisons, were proper expedients for that
purpose, may admit of some question.</P>
<P>ANOTHER expedient which the King tried, in order to
infuse chearfulness into the national devotion, was not much
more successful. He renewed his father's edict for allowing
<PB N="238" REF="280"/>
sports and recreations on Sunday to such as attended, public
worship; and he ordered, his proclamation for that purpose
to be publicly read by the clergy after divine service<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 193, 459. Whitlocke, p. 16, 17. Frankly<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, p. 437.</NOTE>. Those
who were puritanically affected, refused obedience, and were
punished by suspension or deprivation. The differences be∣tween
the sects were before sufficiently great; nor was it
necessary to widen them farther by these inventions.</P>
<P>SOME encouragement and protection, which the King
and the bishops gave to wakes, church-ales, bride-ales, and
other chearful festivals of the common people, were the ob∣jects
of like scandal to the puritans<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 191, 192, May, p. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS year,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12. June.</NOTE> Charles made a journey into Scotland, at∣tended
by his court, in order to hold a parliament there, and
to pass thro' the ceremony of his coronation. The nobility
and gentry of both kingdoms rivaled each other, in expres∣sing
all duty and respect to the King, and in showing mu∣tual
friendship and regard to each other. No one could
have suspected, from exterior appearances, that such dreadful
scenes were approaching.</P>
<P>ONE chief article of business (for it deserves the name),
which the King transacted in this parliament, was, besides
the obtaining some supply, to procure authority for order∣ing
the habits of clergymen<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rush. ibid, p. 183.</NOTE>. The act passed not without
opposition and difficulty. The dreadful surplice was before
mens eyes; and they apprehended, with some reason, that,
under sanction of this law, it would soon be introduced
among them. Tho' the King believed that his prerogative
intitled him to a general power of directing whatever be∣longed
to the exterior government of the church; this was
esteemed a matter of too great importance to be ordered
without the sanction of a particular statute.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="281"/>
IMMEDIATELY after the King's return to England, he
heard of Archbishop Abbot's death: And, without delay,
he conferred that dignity on his favourite, Laud; who, by
this accession of authority, was now enabled to maintain ec∣clesiastical
discipline with greater rigour, and to aggravate
the general discontent of the nation.</P>
<P>LAUD obtained the bishopric of London for his friend
Juxon; and, about a year after Portland's death, had in∣terest
enough to engage the King to make that prelate lord
high treasurer. Juxon was a person of great integrity,
mildness, and humanity, and endued with a good under∣standing
<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 23. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 99.</NOTE>. Yet did this last promotion give general dis∣content.
His birth and character were too obscure for a
man raised to one of the highest offices of the crown. And
the clergy, it was thought, were already too much elated
by former instances of the King's attachment to them, and
needed not this farther encouragement to assume dominion
over the laity<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 97. May, p. 23.</NOTE>. The puritans, likewise, were much dissa∣tisfied
with Juxon, notwithstanding all his eminent virtues;
because he was a lover of profane field-sports and hunting.</P>
<P>SHIP-MONEY was now introduced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1634.</NOTE> The first writs of
this kind had been only directed to sea-port-towns: But
ship-money was at this time levied on the whole kingdom;
and each county was rated at a particular sum,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ship-money.</NOTE> which was
afterwards assessed upon individuals<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 257, 258, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The amount of the
whole tax was very moderate, little exceeding 200,000
pounds; it was levied upon the people with justice and
equality; and this money was intirely expended upon the
navy, to the great honour and advantage of the kingdom:
Yet all these circumstances could not reconcile the people to
the imposition. It was intirely arbitrary: By the same right
any other tax might be imposed: And men esteemed a power∣ful
<PB N="240" REF="282"/>
fleet, tho' very desireable, both for the credit and secu∣rity
of the kingdom, but an unequal recompence for their
liberties, which were thus sacrificed to the obtaining it.</P>
<P>ENGLAND, it must be owned, was, in this respect, un∣happy
in its present situation, that the King had entertained
a very different idea of the constitution, from that which
<HI>began,</HI> in general, to prevail among his subjects. He did
not regard the privileges of the people as so sacred and in∣violable,
that nothing but the most extreme necessity could
justify an infringement of them. He considered himself as
the supreme magistrate, to whose care heaven, by his
birth-right, had committed his people, whose duty it was
to provide for their security and happiness, and who was
vested with very ample discretionary powers for that salutary
purpose. If the observance of the antient laws and customs
was consistent with the present convenience of government;
he thought himself obliged to comply with that rule; as
the easiest, the safest, and what procured the most prompt
and willing obedience. But when a change of circumstances;
especially if derived from the obstinacy of the people, re∣quired
a new plan of administration; national privileges,
he thought, must yield to supreme power; nor could any
order of the state oppose any right to the will of the sove∣reign,
directed to the good of the public<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. iv, P. 535, 542.</NOTE>. That these
principles of government were derived from the uniform
tenor of the English laws, it would be rash to affirm. The
fluctuating nature of the constitution, the impatient hu∣mour
of the people, and the variety of events, had, no
doubt, in different ages, produced many exceptions and
contradictions. These observations alone may be established
on both sides, <HI>that</HI> the appearances were sufficiently strong
in favour of the King to apologize for his following such
maxims, and <HI>that</HI> public liberty must be so precarious under
<PB N="241" REF="283"/>
this exorbitant prerogative, as to render an opposition not
only excuseable, but laudable, in the people.</P>
<P>SOME laws had been enacted, during the reign of
Henry VII. against depopulation, or the converting arable
lands into pasture. By a decree of the star-chamber, Sir
Anthony Roper was fined 4000 pounds for an offence of
this nature<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 270. Vol. iii. App. p. 106</NOTE>. This severe sentence was intended to terrify
others into composition; and above 30,000 pounds were
levied by that expedient<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. iii; p. 333. Franklyn, p. 478</NOTE>. Like compositions, or, in de∣fault
of them, heavy fines, were required for encroachments
on the King's forests; whose bounds, by decrees esteemed
arbitrary, were extended much beyond what was usual<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May, p. 16.</NOTE>.
The bounds of one forest, that of Rockingham, were in∣creased
from six miles to sixty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strafford's letters and dispatches, vol. ii. p. 117.</NOTE>. The same humour, which
made the people refuse to the King voluntary supplies, dis∣posed
them, with much better reason, to murmur against
these irregular methods of taxation.</P>
<P>MORLEY was fined 10,000 pounds, for reviling, chal∣lenging,
and striking, in the court of Whitehall, Sir George
Theobald, one of the King's servants<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 270.</NOTE>; This fine was
thought exorbitant; but whether it was compounded, as
was usual in fines imposed by the star-chamber, we are not
informed.</P>
<P>ALLISON had reported, that the Archbishop of York
had incurred the King's displeasure, by asking a limited
toleration to the catholics, and an allowance to build some
churches for the exercise of their religion. For this slander
against the Archbishop, he was condemned in the star-chamber
to be fined 1000 pounds, to be committed to pri∣son,
to be bound to his good behaviour during life, to be
whipped, and to be set on die pillory at Westminster, and
in three other towns in England. Robins, who had been
<PB N="242" REF="284"/>
an accomplice in the guilt, was condemned by a sentence
equally severe<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 269</NOTE>. Such events are rather to be considered
as rare and detached instances, collected by the severe scru∣tiny
of historians, than as proofs of the prevailing genius
of the King's administration. And it is also certain, that
scandal against the great, tho' seldom prosecuted at present,
is, however, in the eye of the law, a great crime, and sub∣jects
the offender to very heavy penalties.</P>
<P>THERE are other instances of the high respect paid
to the nobility and to the great in that age; when the
powers of monarchy, tho' disputed, still maintained them∣selves
in their pristine vigour. Clarendon<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Life of Clarendon, vol. i. p. 72.</NOTE> tells us a pleasant
incident to this purpose: A waterman, belonging to a man
of quality, having a squabble with a citizen about his fare,
showed his badge, the crest of his master, which happened
to be a swan; and thence insisted on better treatment from
the citizen. But the other replied carelessly, that he did
not trouble his head about that goose. For this offence, he
was summoned before the marshal's court; was fined, as
having opprobriously defamed the nobleman's crest, by call∣ing
the swan a goose, and was in effect reduced to ruin.</P>
<P>SIR Richard Granville had been very ill used by the Earl
of Suffolk in a law-suit; and he was accused before the
star-chamber of having said of that nobleman, that he was
a base lord. The evidence against him was somewhat weak;
yet for this slight offence, insufficiently proved, he was con∣demned
to pay a fine of 8000 pounds; one half to the
Earl, another to the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Lord Lansdown, p. 514.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR George Markham, following a chace where the
Lord Darcy's huntsman was exercising his hounds, kept
closer to the dogs than was thought proper by the
huntsman, who, besides other rudeness, gave him foul
language, which Sir George returned with a stroke of
his whip. The fellow threatened to complain to his mas∣ter
<PB N="243" REF="285"/>
The Knight replied, If his master would justify such
insolence, he would serve him in the same manner, or words
to that effect. Sir George was cited to the star-chamber,
and fined 10,000 pounds. <HI>So fine a thing was it in those
days to be a lord!</HI>—A very natural reflection of Lord Lans∣down's,
in relating this incident<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Lansdown, p. 515.</NOTE>. The people, in vindi∣cating
their liberties from the authority of the crown, threw
off also the yoke of the nobility. It is proper to remark,
that this last affair happened early in the reign of James.
The present practice of the star-chamber was no inno∣vation;
though the present dispositions of the people made
them repine more at this grievous servitude.</P>
<P>CHARLES had imitated the example of Elizabeth and
James,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1635.</NOTE> and had issued proclamations forbidding the landed
gentlemen and the nobility to live idly in London, and or∣dering
them to retire to their country-feats<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 144.</NOTE>. For disobe∣dience
to this edict, many were indicted by the attorney∣general,
and were fined in the star-chamber<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid ii. p. 288.</NOTE>. This occa∣sioned
discontents; and the sentences were complained of, as
illegal. But if proclamations had authority, of which no∣body
pretended to doubt, must they not be put in execu∣tion?
In no instance, I must confess, does it more evidently
appear, what confused and uncertain ideas were, during
that age, entertained concerning the English constitution.</P>
<P>RAY, having exported fullers-earth, contrary to the King's
proclamation, was, besides the pillory, condemned in the
star-chamber to a fins of 2000 pounds<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 348.</NOTE>. Like fines were
levied on Terry, Eman, and others, for disobeying a pro∣clamation
which forbad the exportation of gold<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 350.</NOTE>. In order
to account for the subsequent convulsions, even these in∣cidents
are not to be overlooked, as frivolous or contempti∣ble.
Such severities as these were afterwards magnified
into the greatest enormities.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="286"/>
THERE remains a proclamation of this year, prohibiting
hackney coaches to stand in the street<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 316.</NOTE>. We are told, that
there were not above twenty coaches of that kind in Lon∣don.
There are, at present, near eight hundred.</P>
<P>THE effects of ship-money began now to appear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1636.</NOTE> A
formidable sleet of sixty sail, the greatest which England
had ever known, was equipped under the Earl of Northum∣berland,
who had orders to attack the herring busses of the
Dutch, which fished in what were called the British seas.
The Dutch were content to pay 30,000 pounds for a licence
during this year. They openly denied however, this claim
of dominion in the seas, beyond the friths, bays, and shores;
and it may be questioned whether the laws of nations war∣rant
any farther pretensions.</P>
<P>THIS year the King sent a squadron against Sallee; and
with the assistance of the emperor of Morocco, destroyed
that receptacle of pirates, by whom the English commerce
and even the English coasts had been long infested. This
small exploit was of consequence, and the utmost that could
be expected from a prince who had no army nor revenue;
and who had not been able, without employing the most
difficult and even dangerous expedients, to equip a fleet,
and thereby provide in some degree for the reputation and
safety of his kingdoms.</P>
<P>BURTON a divine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1637.</NOTE> and Bastwick a physician, were tried
in the star-chamber for seditious and schismatical libels, and
were condemned to the same punishment which had been
inflicted on Prynne. Prynne, himself was tried for a new
offence; and, together with another fine of 5,000 pounds,
was condemned to lose what remained of his ears. Besides,
that these writers had attacked, with great severity, and even
an intemperate zeal, the ceremonies, rites, and government
<PB N="245" REF="287"/>
of the church; the very answers, which they gave in to the
court, were so full of contumacy and of invectives against
the prelates, that no lawyer could be prevailed with to sign
them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 381, 382, &amp;c. State Trials, vol. v. p. 66.</NOTE>. The rigors, however, which they underwent, be∣ing
so unworthy men of their profession, gave general of∣fence;
and the patience, or rather alacrity, with which they
suffered, increased still farther the indignation of the public<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. p. 80.</NOTE>. The severity of the star-chamber, which was generally ascribed to Laud's passionate disposition, was perhaps, in it∣self,
somewhat blameable; but will naturally, to us, appear
enormous, who enjoy, in the utmost latitude, that liberty
of the press, which is so necessary in every monarchy, con∣fined
by legal limitations. But as these limitations were not
regularly fixed during the age of Charles, nor at any time
before; so was the freedom of speech totally unknown, and
was generally deemed, as well as religious toleration, incom∣patible
with all good government. No age nor nation, among the moderns,
had ever set an example of such an in∣dulgence:
And it seems unreasonable to judge of the mea∣sures,
embraced during one period, by the maxims which
prevail in another.</P>
<P>BURTON, in his book where he complained of innova∣tions,
mentioned, among others, that a certain Wednesday
had been appointed for a fast, and that the fast was ordered
to be celebrated without any sermons<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 74. Franklyn, p. 839.</NOTE>. The intention, as
he pretended, of that novelty, was, by the example of a
fast without sermons, to suppress all the Wednesday's lectures
in London. 'Tis observable, that the church of Rome and
that of England, being, both of them, lovers of form and
ceremony and order, are more friends to prayer than preach∣ing;
while the puritanical sectaries, who find that the lat∣ter
method of address, being directed to a numerous audi∣ence
present and visible, is more inflaming and animating,
<PB N="246" REF="288"/>
have always regarded it as the chief part of divine service.
Such circumstances, tho' minute, it may not be improper
to transmit to poscerity; that those, who are curious of
tracing the history of the human mind, may remark, how
far its several singularities coincide in different ages.</P>
<P>CERTAIN zealots had erected themselves into a society
for buying in of impropriations, and transferring them to
the church; and great sums of money had been bequeathed
to the society for these purposes. But it was soon observed,
that the only use which they made of their funds, was, to
establish lecturers in all the considerable churches; men,
who, without being subjected to episcopal authority, em∣ployed
themselves intirely in preaching and in spreading the
fire of puritanism, Laud took care, by a decree which was
passed in the court of exchequer, and which was much
complained of, to abolish this society, and to stop their pro∣gress<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 15<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 15<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

It was, however, still observed, that, throughout
England, the lecturers were all of them puritanically af∣fected;
and from them the clergymen, who contented them∣selves
with reading prayers and homilies to the people, com∣monly
received the reproachful appellation of <HI>dumb dogs.</HI></P>
<P>THE puritans, restrained in England, shipped themselves
off for America, and laid there the foundations of a govern∣ment,
which possessed all the liberty, both civil and reli∣gious,
of which they found themselves deprived in their
native country. But their enemies, unwilling that they
should any-where enjoy case and contentment, and dreading,
perhaps, the dangerous consequences of so disaffected a co∣lony,
prevailed with the King to issue a proclamation, de∣barring
these devotees access even into those inhospitable
deserts<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. ii. p. 409. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. Eight ships, lying in the Thames, and ready
to fail, were stayed by order of council; and in these were
<PB N="247" REF="289"/>
embarked Sir Arthur Hazelrig, John Hambden, and Oliver
Cromwel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mather's History of New England, book 1. Dugdale. Bates.</NOTE>, who had resolved for ever to abandon their na∣tive
country, and fly to the other extremity of the globe;
where they might enjoy lectures and discourses of any length
or form which pleased them. The King had afterwards
full leisure to repent this exercise of his authority.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Norwich, by rigorously insisting on uni∣formity,
had banished many industrious tradesmen from
that city, and chaced them into Holland<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">May, p. 82.</NOTE>. The Dutch
began to be more intent on commerce than on orthodoxy; and
thought that useful arts and obedience to the laws formed a
good citizen; tho' attended with errors in subjects, where
it is not allowable for human nature to expect any positive
truth or certainty.</P>
<P>COMPLAINTS about this time were made, that the peti∣tion
of right was, in some instances, violated, and that,
upon a commitment by the King and council, bail or re∣leasement
had been refused to Jennings, Pargiter, and
Danvers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WILLIAMS, bishop of Lincoln, a man of great spirit
and learning, a very popular prelate, and who had been
lord keeper, was fined 10,000 pounds, committed to the
Tower during the King's pleasure, and suspended from his
office. This severe sentence was founded on very frivolous
pretences, and was more ascribed to Laud's vengeance, than
to any guilt of the bishop<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 416, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Laud, however, had owed
his first promotion intirely to the good offices of that pre∣late
with King James. But so implacable was the haughty
primate, that he raised up a, new prosecution against Wil∣liams,
on the strangest pretence imaginable. In order to
levy the fine above-mentioned, some officers had been sent
to seize all the furniture and books of his episcopal palace
of Lincoln; and in rummaging the house, they found in a
<PB N="248" REF="290"/>
corner some neglected letters, which had been thrown by,
as useless. These letters were wrote by one Osbaldistone,
a schoolmaster, and were directed to Williams. Mention
was there made of <HI>a little great man;</HI> and in another pas∣sage,
the same person was denominated <HI>a little urchin.</HI> By
inferences and constructions, these epithets were applied to
Laud; and on no better foundation was Williams tried anew,
as having received scandalous letters, and not discovering
that private correspondence. For this offence, another fine
of 8000 pounds was levied on him by a sentence of the
star-chamber: Osbaldistone was likewise brought to trial,
and condemned to pay a fine of 5000 pounds, and to have
his ears nailed to the pillory before his own school. He
saved himself by flight; and left a note in his study, where
he said, “That he was gone beyond Canterbury<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 803, &amp;c. Whitlocke, p. 25.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THESE prosecutions of Williams seem to be the most ini∣quitous
measure, pursued by the court during the time that
the use of parliaments were suspended. Williams was a
man who had been indebted for all his fortune to the favour
of James; but having quarreled, first with Buckingham,
then with Laud, he threw himself into the country party;
and with great firmness and vigour opposed all the measures
of the King. A creature of the court to become its obsti∣nate
enemy, a bishop to countenance paritans; these cir∣cumstances
excited indignation, and engaged the ministers
in these severe measures. Not to mention, what some
writers relate, that, before the sentence was pronounced
against him, Williams was offered a pardon upon his sub∣mission,
which he refused to make. The court was apt to
think, that so re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ractory a spirit must by any expedient be
broken and subdued.</P>
<P>IN a format trial, which Williams underwent<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 416.</NOTE> (for these
were not the first) there was mentioned, in court, a story,
<PB N="249" REF="291"/>
which, as it discovers the genius of parties, may be worth
reciting. Sir John Lambe, urging him to prosecute the
puritans, the prelate asked, what sort of people these same
puritans were? Sir John replied, “That to the world they
seemed to be such as would not swear, whore, nor-be
drunk; but they would lye, cozen, and deceive: That
they would frequently hear two sermons a-day, and re∣peat
them too, and that sometimes they would fast all day
long.” This character must be conceived to be satiri∣cal;
but yet, it may be allowed, that that sect was more
averse to such irregularities as proceed from the excess of
gaiety and pleasure, than to those enormities, which are
the most destructive of society. The former were opposite
to the very genius and spirit of their religion; the latter
were only a transgression of its precepts: And it was not
difficult for a gloomy enthusiast to convince himself, that a
strict observance of the one would attone for any violation
of the other.</P>
<P>IN 1632, Lord treasurer Portland had insisted with the
vintners, that they should submit to a tax of a penny a quart,
upon all the wine which they retailed. But this proposal
they utterly refused. In order to punish them, a decree
suddenly, without enquiry or examination, passed in the
star-chamber, prohibiting them to sell or dress victuals
in their houses<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 197.</NOTE>. Two years after, they Were questioned
for the breach of this decree; and in order to avoid pu∣nishment,
they agreed to lend the King six thousand pounds.
Being threatened, during the subsequent years, with fines
and prosecutions, they at last compounded thb matter, and
submitted to pay half the duty, which was at first demand∣ed
of them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 451.</NOTE>. It required little forefight to perceive, that
the King's right of issuing proclamations must, if prose∣cuted,
draw on a power of taxation.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="292"/>
LILBURNE was accused before the star-chamber, of
publishing and dispersing seditious pamphlets. He was or∣dered
to be examined; but refused to take the oath, usual
in that court, that he would answer interrogatories, by
which he might be led to accuse himself. For this con∣tempt,
as it was interpreted, he was condemned to be
whipped, pilloried, and imprisoned. While he was whipped
at the cart, and stood on the pillory, he harangued the po∣pulace,
and declaimed violently against the tyranny of bi∣shops
From his pockets also he scattered pamphlets, said
to be seditious; because they attacked the hierarchy. The
star-chamber, who were sitting at that very time, ordered
him immediately to be gagged. He ceased not, however,
though both gagged and pilloried, to stamp with his foot
and gesticulate, in order to show the people, that, if he had
it in his power, he would still harangue them. This be∣haviour
gave fresh provocation to the star-chamber; and
they condemned him to be imprisoned in a dungeon, and to
be loaded with irons<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol ii. p. 465, 466, 467.</NOTE>. It was found very difficult to break
the spirits of men, who placed both their
honour and their conscience in suffering</P>
<P>THE jealousy of the church appeared in another instance
less tragical. Archy, the King's fool, who, by his office,
had the privilege of jesting on his master, and the whole
court, happened unluckily to try his wit upon Laud, who
was too sacred a person to be played with. News having
arrived from Scotland of the first commotions excited by
the liturgy, Archy, seeing the primate pass by, called to
him, <HI>Who's fool, now, my Lord?</HI> For this offence, Archy
was ordered, by sentence of the council, to have his coat
pulled over his head, and to be dismissed the King's ser∣vice<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 470. Wel∣wood; p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="293"/>
HERE is another instance of that rigorous subjection, in
which all men were held by Laud. Some young gentle∣men
of Lincoln's-inn, heated by their cups, having drank
confusion to the Archbishop, were, at his instigation,
cited before the star-chamber. They applied to the Earl of Dor∣set
for protection. <HI>Who bears against you?</HI> said
Dorset. <HI>One of the drawers,</HI> they replied. <HI>Where did he
stand, when you were supposed to drink this health?</HI> sub∣joined
the Earl. <HI>He was at the door,</HI> they replied, <HI>going
out of the room. Tush!</HI> cried he; <HI>the drawer was mista∣ken:
You drank to the confusion of the Archbishop of Can∣terbury's
enemies; and the fellow was gone before you pro∣nounced
the last word.</HI> This hint supplied the young gen∣tlemen
with a new method of defence: And being advised
by Dorset to behave with great humility and great submis∣sion
to the primate; the modesty of their carriage, the in∣genuity
of their apology, with the patronage of that noble
Lord, saved them from any severer punisment than a re∣proof
and admonition, with which they were dismissed.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 180.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS year, John Hambden deservedly acquired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Hambden.</NOTE> by his
spirit and courage, uniyersal popularity throughout the na∣tion,
and has merited great renown with posterity for the
bold stand, which he made, in defence of the laws and li∣berties
of his country. After the laying on of ship-money,
Charles, in order to discourage all opposition, had proposed
this question to the judges; “Whether, in a case of ne∣cessity,
for the defence of the kingdom, he might not
impose this taxation? and whether he was not sole judge
of the necessity?” These guardians of law and liberty
replied, with great complaisance, “That in a case of ne∣cessity
he might impose that taxation, and that he was
sole judge of the necessity<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. ii. p. 355. Whitlocke, p. 24.</NOTE>” Mr. Hambden had been
rated at twenty shillings for an estate, which he held in the
<PB N="252" REF="294"/>
county of Buckingham: Yet notwithstanding this declared
opinion of the judges, notwithstanding the great power,
and sometimes rigorous maxims of the crown, notwithstand∣ing
the little prospect of relief from parliament; he re∣solved,
rather than tamely submit to so illegal an imposi∣tion,
to stand a legal prosecution, and expose himfelf to all
the indignation of the court. The case was argued during
twelve days, in the exchequer-chamber, before all the
judges of England; and the nation regarded, with the ut∣most
anxiety, every circumstance of this celebrated trial.
The event was easily foreseen: But the principles, and
reasonings, and behaviour of all the parties, engaged in the
trial, were much canvassed and enquired into; and nothing
could equal the favour paid to the one side, except the
hatred which attended the other.</P>
<P>IT was urged by Hambden's council, that the plea of ne∣cessity
was in vain introduced into a trial of law; since it was the
nature of necessity to abolish all law, and, by irresistible
violence, to dissolve all the weaker and more artificial ties
of human society. Not only the prince, in cases of ex∣treme
distress, is exempted from the ordinary rules of ad∣ministration:
All orders of men are then levelled; and any
individual may consult the public safety by any expedient,
which his situation enables him to employ. But to pro∣duce
so violent an effect, and so hazardous to every community,
an ordinary danger or difficulty is not sufficient;
much less, a necessity, which is merely factitious and pre∣tended.
Where the peril is urgent and extreme, it will be
palpable to every member of the society; and though all
antient rules of government are in that case abrogated, men
will readily, of themselves, submit to that irregular autho∣rity,
which is exerted for their preservation. But what is
there in common between such suppositions, and the pre∣sent
condition of the nation? England enjoys a profound
peace with all her neighbours: And what is more, all her
neighbours are engaged in furious and bloody wars among
<PB N="253" REF="295"/>
themselves, and by their mutual enmities farther ensure her
tranquillity. The very writs themselves, which are issued for
the levying of ship-money, contradict the supposition of ne∣cessity,
and pretend only, that the seas are insested with py∣rates;
a slight and temporary inconvenience, which may
well wait a legal supply from parliament. The writs like∣wife
allow several months for equipping the ships; which
proves a very calm and deliberate specics of necessity, and
one that admits of delay much beyond the sorty days requisi∣te
for summoning that assembly. 'Tis strange too, that
an extreme necessity, which is always apparent, and usually
comes to a sudden crisis, should now have continued, with∣out
interruption, for near four years, and should have re∣mained,
during so long a time, invisible to the whole king∣dom.
And as to the pretension, that the King is sole
judge of the necessity; what is this, but to subject: all the
privileges of the nation to his arbitrary will and pleasure?
To expect that the public will be convinced by such reason∣ing,
must aggravate the general indignation; by adding, to
violence against mens persons, and their property, so cruel a
mockery their understanding.</P>
<P>IN most national debates, though the reasons may not be
equally ballanced, yet are there commonly some plausible
topics, which may be pleaded even in favour of the weaker
side;so complicated are all human affairs, and so uncer∣tain;
the views, which give rise to every public measure:
But it must be confessed, that, in the present case, no legal
topics of any weight can be thrown into the opposite scale.
The imposition of ship-money, is apparently one of the most
dangerous invasions of national privileges, not only which
Charles was ever guilty of, but which the most arbitrary
prince in England, since any liberty had been ascertained to
the people, had ventured upon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must, however, be allowed, that Queen Elizabeth ordered the sea∣ports to fit out ships at their own expence during the time of the Spanish in∣vasion. <HI>Monsou's Naval Tracts.</HI></NOTE> In vainwere precedents
<PB N="254" REF="296"/>
of antient writs produced: These writs, when examined, were
only found to require the sea-ports, sometimes at their own
charge, sometimes at the charge of the counties, to send their
ships for the defence of the nation. Even the prerogative,
which empowered the crown to issue such writs, was abolish∣ed,
and its exercise almost intirely discontinued, from the time
of Edward III.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. p. 245, 255.</NOTE> and all the authority, which remained or
was afterwards exercised, was to press ships into the public
service, to be payed for by the public. How wide were
these precedents from a power of arbitrarily obliging the
people, at their own charge, to build new ships, to victual
and pay them, for the public; nay, to furnish money to
the crown for that purpose? What security either against
the farther extension of this claim, or against employing to
other purposes the public money, so levied? The plea of
necessity would warrant any other taxation as well as that
of ship-money; and it was difficult to conceive the king∣dom
in a situation, where that plea could be urged with
less plausibility than at present. And if such maxims and
such practices prevail; what has become of national liberty?
What authority is left to the great charter, to the statutes,
and to that very petition of right, which in the present
reign, had been solemnly enacted, by the concurrence of
the whole legislature?</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all these reasons, the prejudiced or
prostituted judges, four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See State Trials: Article, ship money, which contains the speeches of four judges, in favour of Hambden.</NOTE> excepted, gave sentence in favour of
the crown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The power of taxing themselves is an undoubted and most important privilege of the people of England. The only apology, which could be made for the King in imposing ship-money, is derived from a topic, which could not justly be admitted by any court of judicature; that all the privileges of the people were so far subordinate to royal prerogative, that in cases of necessity they might lawfully be dispensed with. Such a doctrine may be tolerable, where the necessity is supposed evident, extreme, and inevitable. But the King thought, that a less necessity, if it proceeded from the obstinacy of the people, might warrant this extraordinary exertion of prerogative: A principle, it must be owned, very dangerous to national liberty, and such as no lawyer ought to be allowed to plead. What∣ever therefore may be advanced in excuse for the King, nothing reasonable can be said in favour of the judges.</NOTE> Hambden, however, obtained by the trial the
<PB N="255" REF="297"/>
end, for which he had so generously sacrificed his safety and
his quiet: The people were rouzed from their lethargy,
and became sensible of the danger, to which their liberty
was exposed. These national questions were canvassed in
every company; and the more they were examined, the
more evidently did it appear to many, that liberty was to∣tally
subverted, and an unusual and arbitrary authority ex∣ercised
over the kingdom. Slavish principles, they said,
concurred with illegal practices; ecclesiastical tyranny gave
aid to civil usurpation; iniquitous taxes were supported by
arbitrary punishments; and all the rights of the nation,
transmitted through, so many ages, secured by so many laws,
and purchased by the blood of so many heroes and patriots,
now lay prostrate at the feet of the monarch. What tho'
public peace and national industry encreased the commerce
and opulence of the kingdom? This advantage was temp∣orary,
and due alone, not to any encouragement given by
the crown, but to the spirit of the English, the remains of
their antient freedom. What though the personal charac∣ter
of the King, amidst all his misguided councils, might
merit indulgence, or even praise? He was but one man;
and the privileges of the nation, the inheritance of millions,
were too valuable to be sacrificed to his prejudices and mis∣takes.
Such, or more severe, were the sentiments promoted
by a great party in the nation: No excuse on the King's
part, or alleviation, however reasonable, could be hearkened
to or admitted: And to redress these grievances, a par∣liament
was impatiently longed for; or any other incident,
however calamitous, which might secure the people against,
those oppressions, which they felt, or the greater ills, which
they apprehended, from the combined encroachments of
church and state.

<P>THE grievances, under which the English laboured,
when considered in themselves, without regard to
the constitution, scarce deserve the name; nor were they
either burthensome on the people's properties, or any way
shocking to the natural humanity of mankind. Even the
taxation of ship-money, independent of the consequences,
was rather an advantage to the public; by the judicious
use, which the King made of the money levied by that
expedient. And though it was justly apprehended that such
precedents, if patiently submitted to, would end in a total
disuse of parliaments, and in the establishment of arbitrary
authority; Charles dreaded no opposition from the people,
who are not commonly much affected with consequences,
and require some striking motive, to engage them into
a resistance of established government. All ecclesiasti∣cal
affairs Were settled by law and uninterrupted prece∣dent;
and the church was become a considerable barrier
to the power, both legal and illegal, of the crown. Peace
too, industry, commerce, opulence; nay, even justice and
lenity of administration, notwithstanding some few exceptions;
<PB N="257" REF="301"/>
All these were enjoyed by the people;<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LIII.</NOTE> and every
other blessing of government, except liberty, or rather the
present exercise of liberty and its proper security<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, p. 74, 75. May, p. 18. Warwick, p. 62.</NOTE> It
seemed probable, therefore, that affairs might long have
continued on the same footing in England, had it not been
for the neighbourhood of Scotland; a country more turbu∣lent,
and less disposed to submission and obedience. It was
from thence the commotions first arose; and 'tis therefore
time for us to return thither, and to give an account of the
situation of that country.</P>
<P>THOUGH the pacific,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents in Scotland.</NOTE> and not unskilful government of
James, and the great authority, which he had acquired,
had much allayed the feuds among the great families, and
had established law and order throughout the kingdom;
the Scots nobility were still possessed of the chief power and
influence over the people. Their property was very ex∣tensive;
their hereditary jurisdictions and the feudal tenures
increased their authority; and the attachment of the gentry
to the heads of families established a kind of voluntary ser∣vitude
under the chieftains. Besides that long absence had
much loosened the King's connexion with the nobility,
who resided chiefly at their country seats; they were, in
general, at this time, though from slight causes, very much
disgusted with the court. Charles, from the natural piety
or superstition of his temper, was extremely attached to the
ecclesiastics: And as it is natural for men to persuade
themselves, that their interest coincides with their inclina∣tion;
he had established it as a fixed maxim of policy, to
increase the power and authority of that order. The pre∣lates,
he thought, established regularity and discipline
among the clergy; the clergy inculcated obedience and
loyalty among the people: And as that rank of men had
no separate authority, and no dependance but on the crown;
the royal power, it would seem, might, with the greatest
<PB N="258" REF="302"/>
safety, be entrusted in their hands. Many of the prelates,
therefore, he raised to the chief dignities of the state<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 386. May, p. 29.</NOTE>:
Spotswood, Archbishop of St. Andrew's, was created chan∣cellor:
Nine of the bishops were privy counsellors: The
bishop of Ross aspired to the office of treasurer: Some of
the prelates possessed places in the exchequer: And it
was even endeavoured to revive the first institution of the col∣lega
of justice, and to share equally between the clergy and
laity the whole judicial authority<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Guthry's Memoirs, p. 14. Bunet's Mem. p. 29, 30.</NOTE> These advantages,
which were possessed by the church, and which the bi∣shops
did not always enjoy with suitable modesty, disgusted
the haughty nobility, who, deeming themselves so much
superior in rank and quality to this new order of men,
were displeased to find themselves inferior in power and in∣fluence.
Interest joined itself to ambition; and begot a
jealousy, left the episcopal sees, which, at the reformation,
had been pillaged by the nobles, should again be enriched
at their expence. By a most useful and beneficial law, the
impropriations had already been ravished from the great
men: Power had been given to assign, to the impoverished
clergy, competent livings from the tythes of each parish:
And what remained, the proprietor of the land was im∣powered
to purchase at a low valuation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration, p. 7. Franklyn, p. 611.</NOTE>. The King like∣wife,
warranted by antient law and practice, had declared for
a general resumption of all crown-lands, alienated by his
predecessors; and though he took no step towards the exe∣cution
of this project, the very pretension to such power
had excited jealousy and discontent<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration, p. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the tender regard, which Charles
bore to the whole church, he had been able in Scotland, to
acquire only the affection of the superior rank among the
clergy. The ministers, in general, equalled, if not ex∣ceeded
<PB N="259" REF="303"/>
the nobility, in their prejudices against the court,
against the prelates, and against episcopal authority<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Mem. p. 29, 30.</NOTE>.
Though the establishment of the hierarchy might seem ad∣vantageous
to the inferior clergy, both as it erected digni∣ties,
to which all of them might aspire, and as it bestowed a
lustre on the whole body, and allured men of family into
it; these views had no influence on the Scots ecclesiastics.
In the present disposition of mens minds, there was another
circumstance, which drew consideration, and counter-bal∣lanced
power and riches, the usual foundations of distinc∣tion
among men; and that was, the fervour of piety, and
the rhetoric, however barbarous, of religious lectures
and discourses. Checked by the prelates in the licence of preach∣ing,
the clergy regarded episcopal jurisdiction both as
a tyranny and an usurpation, and maintained a parity among
ecclesiastics to be a divine privilege, which no human law
could alter or infringe. While such ideas prevailed, the
most moderate exercise of authority would have given dis∣gust;
much more, that extensive power, which the King's
indulgence encouraged the prelates to assume. The juris∣diction
of presbyteries, synods, and other democratical
courts, was, in a manner, abolished by the bishops; and the
general assembly itself had not been summoned for several
years<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">May, p. 29.</NOTE>. A new oath was arbitrarily exacted of intrants, by
which they swore to observe the articles of Perth, and sub∣mit
to the liturgy and canons. And in a word, the whole
system of church government, during a course of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hirty
years, had been changed by means of the innovations intro∣duced
by James and Charles.</P>
<P>THE people, under the influence of the nobility and
clergy, could not fail to partake of the discontents, which
prevailed among these two orders; and where real grounds
of complaint were wanting, they greedily laid hold of ima∣ginary
ones. The same horror against popery, with which
<PB N="260" REF="304"/>
the English puritans were possessed, was observable among
the populace in Scotland; and among these, who were more
uncultivated and uncivilized, seemed rather to be inflamed
into a higher degree of ferocity. The genius of religion,
which prevailed with the court and prelacy, was of an op∣posite
nature; and having some affinity with the Romish
worship, led them to mollify, as much as possible, these
severe prejudices, and to speak of the catholics in more cha∣ritable
language, and with more reconciling expressions.
From this foundation, a panic fear of popery was easily
raised; and every new ceremony or ornament, introduced
into divine service, was part of that great mystery of ini∣quity,
which, from the encouragement of the King and
the bishops, was to overspread the nation<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Mem. p. 29, 30, 31.</NOTE>. The few innova∣tions,
which James had made, were considered as prepara∣tives
to this grand design; and the farther alterations, at∣tempted
by Charles, were represented as a plain declaration
of his intentions. Through the whole course of this reign,
nothing had more fatal influence, in both kingdoms, than
this groundless apprehension, which, with so much indus∣try,
was propagated, and with so much credulity, was em∣braced
by all ranks of men.</P>
<P>AMIDST these dangerous complaints and terrors of reli∣gious
grievances, the civil and ecclesiastical privileges of the
nation were imagined, and with some reason, not to be al∣together
free from invasion.</P>
<P>THE establishment of the high-commission by James,
without any authority of law, seemed a considerable en∣croachment
of the crown; and erected the most dangerous
and arbitrary of all courts, by a method equally dangerous
and arbitrary. All the steps towards the settlement of epis∣copacy
had indeed been taken with consent of parliament:
The articles of Perth were confirmed in 1621: In 1633,
the King had obtained a general ratification of every ecclesi∣astical
<PB N="261" REF="305"/>
establishment: But all these laws had less authority
with the nation, as they were known to have passed con∣trary
to the sentiments even of those who voted for them,
and were in reality extorted by the authority and importu∣nity
of the sovereign. The means, however, which both
James and Charles had employed, in order to influence the
parliament, were intirely regular; and no reasonable pre∣tence
had been afforded for representing these laws as null or
invalid.</P>
<P>BUT there prevailed among the greatest part of the nation
another principle, of the most important and most danger∣ous
consequence, and which, if admitted, destroyed in∣tirely
the validity of all such statutes. The ecclesiastical
authority was supposed to be totally independent of the
civil; and no act of parliament, nothing but the consent of
the church itself, was represented as sufficient ground for
the introduction of any change in religious worship or dis∣cipline.
And though James had obtained the vote of as∣semblies
for receiving episcopacy and his new rites; it must
be confessed, that such irregularities had prevailed in con∣stituting
these ecclesiastical courts, and such violences in con∣ducting
them, that there were some grounds for denying the
authority of all their acts. Charles, sensible that an ex∣torted
consent, attended with such invidious circumstances,
would rather be prejudicial to his measures, had intirely
laid aside the use of assemblies, and was resolved, in con∣junction
with the bishops, to govern the church by an au∣thority,
to which he thought himself fully intitled, and which he believed absolutely uncontroulable.</P>
<P>THE King's great aim was to compleat the work, so hap∣pily
begun by his father, to establish discipline upon a re∣gular
system of canons, to introduce a liturgy into public
worship, and to render the ecclesiastical government of all
his kingdoms intirely regular and uniform. Some views of
policy might move him to this undertaking: But the chief
<PB N="262" REF="306"/>
motives were derived from mistaken principles of zeal and
conscience.</P>
<P>THE canons for establishing ecclesiastical jurisdiction
were promulgated in 1635;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Introducti∣on of the canons and liturgy.</NOTE> and were received by the na∣tion,
though without much appearing opposition, yet with
great inward apprehension and discontent. Men felt dis∣pleasure,
at seeing the royal authority highly exalted by them,
and represented as absolute and uncontroulable. They saw
these speculative principles reduced to practice, and a whole
body of ecclesiastical laws established, without any previous
consent either of church or state<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 106.</NOTE>. They dreaded, that,
by a parity of reason, like arbitrary authority, from like
pretences and principles, would be assumed in civil matters:
They remarked, that the delicate boundaries, which sepa∣rate
church and state, were already passed, and many civil
ordinances established by the canons, under colour of ec∣clesiastical
institutions: And they were apt to deride the
negligence, with which these important edicts had been
compiled; when they found, that the new liturgy or ser∣vice-book
was every where, under severe penalties, en∣joined
by them, though it had not yet been composed or
published<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 105.</NOTE>. It was, however, soon expected; and in the
reception of it, as the people are always most affected by
what is external and exposed to the senses, it was appre∣hended,
that the chief difficulty would consist.</P>
<P>THE liturgy, which the King, from his own authority,
imposed on Scotland, was copied from that of England:
But lest a servile imitation might shock the pride of his antient
kingdom, a very few alterations, in order to save appearances,
were made in it; and in that shape it was transmitted to
the bishops at Edinburgh<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration, p. 18. May, p. 32.</NOTE>. But the Scots had univer∣sally
entertained a notion, that, though riches and worldly
glory had been shared out to them with a sparing hand,
<PB N="263" REF="307"/>
they could boast of spiritual treasures more abundant and
more genuine, than were enjoyed by any nation under
heaven. Even their southern neighbours, they thought,
though separated from Rome, still retained a great tincture
of the primitive pollution; and their liturgy was represented
as a species of mass, though with some less show and em∣broidery<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 20.</NOTE>.
Great prejudices, therefore, were entertained
against it, even considered in itself; much more, when re∣garded
as a preparative, which was soon to introduce into
Scotland all the abominations of popery. And as the very
few alterations, which distinguished the new liturgy from
the English, seemed to approach nearer to the doctrine of
the real presence; this circumstance was deemed an un∣doubted
confirmation of every suspicion, with which the
people were possessed<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Mem. p. 31. Rush. vol. ii. p. 396. May, p. 31.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EASTER-DAY was, by proclamation, appointed for the
first reading of the service in Edinburgh: But in order to
judge more surely of mens dispositions, the council delayed
the matter till the 23d of July; and they even gave no∣tice,
the Sunday before, of their intention to commence the
use of the new liturgy. As no considerable symptoms of
discontent appeared, they thought that they might safely
proceed in their purpose<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 22. Clarendon ol. p. 108. Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 387.</NOTE>; and accordingly, in the cathe∣dral
church of St. Giles, the dean of Edinburgh, arrayed
in his surplice, began the service; the bishop himself and
many of the privy council being present.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumult at Edinburgh.</NOTE> But no sooner
had the dean opened the book, than a multitude of the
meanest sort, most of them women, clapping their hands,
cursing, and crying out, <HI>A pope! a pope! antichrist! stone
him!</HI> raised such a tumult, that it was impossible to pro∣ceed
with the service. The bishop, mounting the pulpit,
in order to appease the populace, had a stool thrown at
him: The council were insulted: And it was with diffi∣culty,
<PB N="264" REF="308"/>
that the magistrates were able, partly by authority,
partly by force, to expel the rabble, and to shut the doors
against them. The tumult, however, still continued with∣out:
Stones were thrown at the doors and windows: And
when the service was ended, the bishop, going home, was
attacked, and narrowly escaped from the hands of the en∣raged
multitude. In the afternoon, the lord privy seal, be∣cause
he carried the bishop in his coach, was so pelted with
stones, and whooted at with execrations, and pressed upon by
the eager populace, that, if his servants, with drawn swords,
had not kept them off, the bishop had run the utmost ha∣zard
of his life<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 23, 24, 25. Rush. vol. ii. p. 388.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH it was violently suspected, that the low rabble,
who alone appeared, had been instigated by some of higher
condition, yet no proof of it could ever be produced; and
every one spake with disapprobation of the licentiousness of
the giddy multitude<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 26, 30. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 109.</NOTE>. It was not thought safe, however,
to hazard a new insult by any new attempt to read the litur∣gy;
and the populace seemed, for the time, to be appeased
and satisfied. But it being known, that the King still per∣severed
in his intentions of imposing that mode of worship,
men fortified themselves still farther in their prejudices
against it; and great multitudes resorted to Edinburgh,
in order to oppose the introduction of so hated a novelty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 32. Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 400.</NOTE>.
It was not long before they broke out into the most violent
disorder.<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th Oct.</NOTE> The bishop of Galloway was attacked in the
streets, and chased into the chamber, where the privy coun∣cil
was sitting. The council itself was besieged and violently
attacked: The town-council met with the same fate: And
nothing could have saved the lives of all of them, but their
application to some popular lords, who protected them, and
dispersed the multitude. In this sedition, the actors were
<PB N="265" REF="309"/>
of some better condition than in the former; though no∣body
of rank seemed, as yet, to countenance them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 35, 36, &amp;c. Rush, vol. ii. p. 404.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL men, however, began to unite and to encourage
each other, in opposition to the religious innovations in∣troduced
into the kingdom. Petitions to the council were
signed and presented by persons of the highest quality: The
women took party, and, as is usual, with great violence:
The clergy, every where, loudly declaimed against popery
and the liturgy, which they represented as the same: The
pulpits resounded with vehement invectives against anti∣christ:
And the populace, who first opposed the service,
was often compared to Balaam's ass, an animal, in itself,
stu∣pid and senseless, but whose mouth had been opened by the
Lord, to the admiration of the whole world<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 31.</NOTE>. In short,
fanaticism mingling with faction, private interest with the
spirit of liberty, symptoms appeared, on all hands, of the
most dangerous insurrection and disorder.</P>
<P>THE primate, a man of wisdom and religion, who was
all along averse to the introduction of the liturgy, repre∣sented
to the King the state of the nation: The Earl of
Traquaire, lord treasurer, set out for London, in order to
lay the matter more fully before him: Every circumstance,
whether the condition of England or of Scotland was con∣sidered,
should have engaged him to desist from so ha∣zardous
an attempt: Yet was Charles inflexible. In his
whole conduct of this affair, there appeared no marks of
the good sense, with which he was undoubtedly endowed:
A lively instance of that species of character, so frequently
to be met with; where there are found parts and judgment
in every discourse and opinion; in many actions, indiscre∣tion
and imprudence. Mens views of things are the result
of their understanding alone: Their conduct is regulated
by their understanding, their temper, and their passions.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="310"/>
To so violent a combination of an whole kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1638.</NOTE>
Charles had nothing to oppose but a proclamation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Feb.</NOTE> in which
he pardoned all past offences, and exhorted the people to be
more obedient for the future, and to submit peaceably to
the use of the liturgy. This proclamation was instantly en∣countered
with a public protestation, presented by the Earl
of Hume and Lord Lindesey: And this was the first time,
that men of quality had appeared in any violent act of op∣position<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 47, 48, &amp;c. Guthry, p. 28. May, p. 37.</NOTE>.
But this proved a crisis. The insurrection,
which had been advancing by a gradual and slow progress,
now blazed out at once. No disorder, however, attended
it. On the contrary, a new order immediately took place.
Four <HI>tables,</HI> as they were called, were. formed in Edinburgh.
One consisted of nobility, another of gentry, a third of mi∣nisters,
a fourth of burgesses. The table of gentry was
divided into many subordinate tables, according to their
different counties. In the hands of the four tables, the
whole authority of the kingdom was placed. Orders were
issued by them, and every where obeyed, with the utmost
regularity<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cla∣reendon, vol. i. p. III. Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 734.</NOTE>. And among the first acts of their government was the production of the COVENANT.</P>
<P>THIS famous covenant consisted first of a re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unciation
of popery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cove∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant,</NOTE> formerly signed by James in his youth, and
composed of many invectives, fitted to inflame the minds
of men against their fellow creatures, whom heaven has en∣joined
them to cherish and to love. There followed a bond
of union, by which the subscribers obliged themselves to
resist religious innovations, and to defend eath other against
all opposition whatever: And all this, for the greater glory
of God, and the greater honour and advantage of their
king and country<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 57, 58. Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 734. May, p. 38.</NOTE>. All ranks and conditions, all ages and
sexes, flocked to the subscription of this covenant: Few,
in their judgment, disapproved of it; and still fewer dared
<PB N="267" REF="311"/>
openly to condemn it. The King's ministers and counsellors
themselves were, most of them, seized by the general con∣tagion.
And none but rebels to God, and traitors to their
country, it was thought, would withdraw themselves from
so salutary and so pious a combination.</P>
<P>THE treacherous, the cruel, the unrelenting Philip, ac∣companied
with all the terrors of a Spanish inquisition, was
scarcely, during the preceding century, opposed in the Low
Countries with more determined fury, than was now, by
the Scots, the mild, the humane Charles, attended with
his inoffensive liturgy.</P>
<P>THE King began to apprehend the consequences.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June</NOTE> He
sent the Marquis of Hamilton, as commissioner, with au∣thority
to treat with the covenanters. He required the co∣venant
to be renounced and recalled: And he thought, that
on his part he had made very satisfactory concessions, when
he offered to suspend the canons and the liturgy, till, in a
fair and legal way, they could be received; and so to mo∣del
the high commission, that it should no longer give of∣fence
to his subjects<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 754, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Such general declarations could
not well give content to any, much less to those who car∣ried
so much higher their pretensions. The covenanters
found themselves seconded by the zeal of the whole nation.
Above sixty thousand people were assembled in a tumultuous
manner about Edinburgh. Charles possessed no regular
forces in either of his kingdoms. And the discontents in
England, tho' secret, were believed so violent, that the King,
it was thought, would find it very difficult to employ in such
a cause the power of that nation. The more, therefore, the
popular leaders in Scotland considered their situation, the less
apprehension did they entertain of royal power, and the more
rigorously did they insist on intire satisfaction. In answer
to Hamilton's demand of renouncing the covenant, they
plainly told him, that they would sooner renounce their
baptis<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 87.</NOTE>. And the ministers invited the commissioner himself
<PB N="268" REF="312"/>
to subscribe it; by informing him; “ With what peace
and comfort it had filled the hearts of all God's people;
what resolutions and beginnings of reformation of man∣ners
were sensibly perceived in all parts of the nation,
above any measure they had ever before found or could
have expected; how great glory the Lord had received
thereby; and what confidence they had, that God would
make Scotland a blessed kingdom<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 88. Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 751.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>HAMILTON returned to London:<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th Sept.</NOTE> Made another fruit∣less
journey, with new concessions, to Edinburgh: Return∣ed
again to London; and was immediatly sent back with
still more satisfactory concessions. The King was now
willing intirely to abolish the canons, the liturgy, and the
high commission court. He was even resolved to limit ex∣tremely
the power of the bishops, and was content, if, on
any terms, he could retain that order in the church of
Scotland<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 137. Rush. vol. ii. p. 762.</NOTE>. And to ensure all these gracious offers, he gave
Hamilton authority to summon first an assembly, then a par∣liament,
where every national grievance might be redressed
and remedied. These successive concessions of the King,
which yet came still short of the rising demands of the
malecontents, discovered his own weakness, encouraged their
insolence, and gave no satisfaction. The offer, however,
of an assembly and a parliament, in which they expected to
be intirely masters, was very willingly embraced by all the
covenanters.</P>
<P>CHARLES, perceiving what advantage his enemies had
reaped from their covenant, resolved to have a covenant on
his side; and he ordered one to be drawn up for that
purpose. It consisted of the same violent renunciation of
popery above-mentioned; which, though the King did not
approve of it, he thought it safest to adopt, in order to re∣move
all the suspicions entertained against him. As the
<PB N="269" REF="313"/>
covenanters, in their bond of mutual defence against all op∣position,
had been careful not to accept the King; Charles
had formed a bond, which was annexed to this renunciation,
and which expressed the subscribers duty and loyalty to his
Majesty<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">King's Decl, p. 140, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But the covenanters, perceiving, that this new
covenant was only meant too weaken and divide them, re∣ceived
it with the utmost scorn and detestation. And with∣out
delay, they proceeded to the modelling the future as∣sembly,
from which such great atchievements were ex∣pected<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. ii. p. 772.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE genius of that religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general assembly.</NOTE> which prevailed in Scot∣land,
and which, every day, was secretly gaining ground in
England, was far from inculcating deference and submission
to the ecclesiastics, merely as such: Or rather, by nourish∣ing
in every individual, the, highest raptures and ecstasies of
devotion, it consecrated, in a manner, every individual, and
in his own eyes, bestowed a character on him, much supe∣rior
to what forms and ceremonious institutions could alone
confer. The clergy of Scotland, though such tumult was
excited about religious worship and discipline, were both
poor, and in small numbers; nor are they, in general, to
be considered, at least in the beginning, as the ringleaders
of the sedition, which was raised on their account. On
the contrary, the laity, apprehending, from several instances,
which occurred, a spirit of moderation in that order, re∣solved
to domineer intirely in the assembly, which was
summoned, and to hurry on the ecclesiastics by the same
furious zeal, with which they were themselves transported<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 188, 189. Rushworth, vol. ii. p. 761.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT had been usual, before the establishment of prelacy,
for each presbytery to send to the assembly, besides two or
three ministers, one lay-commissioner<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">A presbytery in Scotland is an inferior ecclesiastical court, the same which was afterwards called a classes in England, and is composed of the clergy of the neigh∣bouring parishes to the number commonly of between twelve and twenty.</NOTE>; and, as all the bo∣roughs
<PB N="270" REF="314"/>
and universities sent likewise commissioners, the lay∣members,
in that ecclesiastical court, very nearly equalled
the ecclesiastics. Not only this institution, which James,
apprehensive of zeal in the laity, had abolished, was now
revived by the covenanters: They also introduced an inno∣vation,
which served still farther to reduce the clergy to
subjection. By an edict of the tables, whose authority was
supreme, an elder, from each parish was ordered to at∣tend
the presbytery, and to give his vote in the choice both
of the commissioners and ministers, who should be deputed
to the assembly. As it is not usual for the ministers, who
are put in the list of candidates, to claim a vote, the whole
elections, by that means, fell into the hands of the laity: The
most furious of all ranks were chosen: And the more to
over-awe the clergy, a new device was fallen upon, of
chusing, to every commissioner, four or five lay-assessors,
who, though they could have no vote, yet might interpose
with their counsel and authority in the assembly<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 190, 191, 290. Guthry, p. 39, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE assembly met at Glasgow: And, besides a great con∣course
of the people, all the nobility and gentry of any fa∣mily
or interest were present, either as members, assessors,
or spectators; and it was apparent, that the resolutions,
taken by the covenanters, could here meet with no manner
of opposition. A firm determination had been entered into,
of utterly abolishing episcopacy; and as a preparative to
it, there was laid before the presbytery of Edinburgh, and
solemnly read in all the churches of the kingdom, an accu∣sation
against the bishops, as guilty, all of them, of heresy,
simony, bribery, perjury, cheating, incest, adultery, for∣nication,
common swearing, drunkenness, gaming, breach
of the sabbath, and every other crime, which had occurred
to the accusers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">King's Decl, p. 218. Rush. vol. ii. p. 787.</NOTE>. The bishops sent a protest, declining the
authority of the assembly; the commissioner too protested
<PB N="271" REF="315"/>
against that court, as illegally constituted and elected; and,
in his Majesty's name, dissolved. This measure was fore∣seen,
and little regarded. The court still continued to sit,
and to finish their business<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">May, p. 44.</NOTE>. All the acts of assembly, since
the accession of James to the crown of England, were,
upon pretty reasonable grounds, declared null and invalid.
The acts of parliament, which affected ecclesiastical affairs,
were supposed, on that very account, to have no manner of
authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Episcopacy abolished.</NOTE> And thus episcopacy, the high commission, the
articles of Perth, the canons, and the liturgy, were abo∣lished
and declared unlawful: And the whole fabric, which
James and Charles, in a long course of years, had been
rearing with so much care and policy, fell at once to the
ground. The covenant likewise was ordered to be signed
by every one, under pain of excommunication<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">King's Decl. p. 317.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE independency of the ecclesiastical upon the civil
power was the old presbyterian principle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1639.</NOTE> which had been
zealously adopted at the reformation, and which, though
James and Charles had obliged the church publicly to dis∣claim
it, had secretly been adhered to by all ranks of people.
It was commonly asked, whether Christ or the King were
superior? And as the answer seemed obvious, it was in∣ferred,
that the assembly, being Christ's council, was su∣perior,
in all spiritual matters, to the parliament, which
was only the King's. But as the covenanters were sensible,
that this consequence, though it seemed to them irrefraga∣ble,
would not be assented to by the King; it became re∣quisite
to maintain their religious tenets by military force,
and not to trust intirely to supernatural assistance, of which,
however, they held themselves well assured. They cast
their eyes on all sides, abroad and at home, whence ever
they could expect any aid or support.</P>
<P>AFTER France and Holland had entered into a league
against Spain, and framed a treaty of partition, by which
<PB N="272" REF="316"/>
they were to conquer and to divide between them the Low∣country-provinces,
England, was invited to preserve a neu∣trality
between the contending parties, while the French
and Dutch should attack the maritime towns of Flanders.
But the King replied to d'Estrades, the French ambassador,
who opened the proposal, that he had a squadron ready,
and would cross the seas, if necessary, with an army of
15,000 men, in order to prevent these projected conquests<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mem. d'Estrades, vol. i.</NOTE>.
This answer, which proves, that Charles, though he ex∣pressed
his mind with an imprudent candor, had, at last,
acquired a just idea of national interest, irritated extremely
Cardinal Richlieu; and in revenge, that politic and enter∣prizing
minister carefully fomented the first commotions
in Scotland, and secretly supplied the covenanters with money
and arms, in order to encourage them in their opposition
against their sovereign.</P>
<P>BUT the chief resource of the Scots malecontents, was
in themselves, and in their own vigour and ability. No
regular established commonwealth could take juster measures,
or execute them with greater promptitude, than did this
tumultuous combination, inflamed with bigotry for reli∣gious
trifles; and faction without a reasonable object. The
whole kingdom was, in a manner, engaged; and the men
of greatest ability, soon acquired the ascendant, which
their family interested enabled them to maintain. The Earl
of Argyle, though he long seemed to temporize, had, at
last, embraced the covenant; and he became the chief leader
of that party: A man equally supple and inflexible,
cautious and determined, and intirely qualified to make a
figure during a factious and turbulent period. The Earls
of Rothes, Cassils, Montrose, Lothian, the Lords Lindesey,
Loudon, Yester, Balmerino, distinguished themselves in
that party. Many Scots officers had acquired reputation in
the German wars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War,</NOTE> particularly under Gustavus; and these
<PB N="273" REF="317"/>
were invited over to assist their country in her present ne∣cessity.
The command was entrusted to Lesly, a soldier of
experience and ability. Forces were regularly inlisted and
disciplined. Arms were commissioned and imported from
foreign countries. A few castles, which belonged to the
King, being unprovided of victuals, ammunition, and gar∣risons,
were soon seized. And the whole country, except
a small part; where the Marquis of Huntley still adhered to
the King, being in the covenanters hands, was, in a very
little time, put into a tolerable posture of defence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">May, p. 49.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fortifications of Leith were begun and carried on
with great rapidity. Besides the inferior sort, and those
who laboured for pay, incredible numbers of volunteers,
even noblemen and gentlemen, put their hand to the work,
and deemed the most abject employment to be dignified by
the sanctity of the cause. Women too, of rank and con∣dition,
forgetting the delicacy of their sex, and the decorum
of their character, were intermingled with the lowest rabble;
and carried, on their shoulders, the rubbish, requisite for
compleating the fortifications<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Guthry's Memoirs, p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE must not omit another auxiliary of the covenanters,
and no inconsiderable one; a prophetess, who was much
followed and admired by all ranks of people. Her name
was Michelson, a woman full of whimsies, parly hysterical,
partly religious; and inflamed with a zealous concern for
the ecclesiastical discipline of the presbyterians. She spoke
only at certain times, and had often interruptions of days and
weeks: But when she began to renew her ecstasies, warn∣ing
of the happy event was conveyed over the whole country,
thousands crowded about her house, and every word, which
she uttered, was received with veneration, as the most sa∣cred
oracles. The covenant was her perpetual theme. The
true, genuine covenant, she said, was ratified in heaven:
The King's covenant was an invention of Satan: When
<PB N="274" REF="318"/>
she spoke of Christ, she commonly called him by the name
of the covenanting Jesus. Rollo, a popular preacher, and
zealous covenanter, was her great favourite; and payed her,
on his part, no less veneration. Being desired by the spec∣tators
to pray with her, and speak to her; he answered,
“That he durst not, and that it would be ill manners in
him to speak, while his master Christ was speaking in
her<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">King's Declaration at large, p. 227. Burnet's Memoirs of Hamilton.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>CHARLES had agreed to reduce episcopal authority so
much, that it would no longer have been of any service to
support the crown; and this sacrifice of his own interest he
was willing to make, in order to obtain public peace and
tranquility. But he could not consent entirely to abolish an
order, which he esteemed as essential to the being of a
christian church, as his Scots subjects thought it incom∣patible
with that sacred institution. This narrowness of
mind, if we would be impartial, we must either blame or
excuse equally on both sides; and thereby anticipate, by a
little reflection, that judgment, which time, by introducing
new subjects of controversy, will undoubtedly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>render quite
familiar to posterity.</P>
<P>So great was Charles's aversion to violent and sanguinary
measures, and so strong his affection to his native kingdom,
that, it is probable, the contest in his breast would be
nearly equal between these laudable passions, and his attach∣ment
to the hierarchy. The latter affection, however, pre∣vailed
for, the time, and made him hasten those military
preparations, which he had projected for subduing the re∣fractory
spirit of the Scots nation. By regular oeconomy,
he had not only payed all the debts contracted during the
Spanish and French wars; but had amassed a sum of two
hundred thousand pounds, which he had reserved for any
sudden exigency. The Queen had great interest with the
catholics, both from the sympathy of religion, and from the
<PB N="275" REF="319"/>
favours and indulgences, which she had been able to pro∣cure
them. She now employed her credit, and persuaded
them, that it was reasonable to give large contributions, as
a mark of their duty to the King, during this urgent ne∣cessity<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1329. Franklyn, p. 767.</NOTE>.
A considerably supply was gained by this means;
to the great scandal of the puritants, who were mightily of∣fended
at seeing the King on such good terms with the pa∣pists,
and repined, that others should give what they them∣selves
were disposed to refuse him.</P>
<P>CHARLES'S fleet was formidable and well supplied.
Having, put 5000 land forces on board, he entrusted it to
the Marquis of Hamilton, who had orders to sail to the
frith, of Forth, and to cause a diversion in the forces of the
malecontents. An army was levied of near 20,000 foot,
and above 3000 horse, and was put under the command of
the Earl of Arundel, a Nobleman of great family, but ce∣lebrated
neither for military nor political abilities. The
Earl of Essex, a man of strict honour, and extremely popular,
especially among the soldiery, was apponted lieutenant-general:
The Earl of Holland was general of the horse. The King
himself joined the army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th May.</NOTE> and he summoned all, the peers of
England to attend him. The whole had the appearance of
a splendid court, rather than of a military armament; and
in this situation, carrying More show than real force with
it, the camp arrived at Berwick<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 115, 116, 117.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Scots army was as numerous as that of the King,
but inferior in cavalry. The officers had more reputation
and experience; and the soldiers, though undisciplined and
ill armed, were animated, as Well by the national aversion
to England and the dread of becoming a province to their
old enemy, as by an unsurmountable servour of religion.
The pulpits had extremely assisted the officers in levying re∣cruits,
and had thundered out anathemas upon all those
<HI>who went not out to assist the Lord against the mighty</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs of Hamilton.</NOTE>.

Yet so prudent were the leaders of the malecontents, that
they immediately sent very submissive messages to the King,
and craved leave to be admitted to a treaty.</P>
<P>CHARLES knew, that the force of the covenanters was
considerable, their spirits high, their zeal furious; and as
they were not yet daunted by any ill success, no reasonable
terms could be expected from them. With regard there∣fore
to a treaty, great difficulties occurred on both sides.
Should he submit to the pretensions of the malecontents;
besides that the prelacy must be sacrificed to their religious
prejudices; such a check would be given to regal authority,
which had, very lately, and with much difficulty, been
thoroughly established in Scotland, that he must expect
for ever after, to retain, in that kingdom, no more than the
appearance of majesty. The great men, having proved,
by so sensible a trial, the impotence of law and prerogative,
would return to their former licentioussness: The preachers
would retain their innate arrogance: And the people, un∣protected
by justice, would recognize no other authority,
than that which they found to domineer over them. Eng∣land
also, it was much to be feared, would imitate so bad
an example; and having already a strong propensity to∣wards
republican and puritanical factions, would expect, by
the same seditious practices, to attain the same indulgence.
To advance so far, without bringing the rebels to a total
submission, at least to reasonable concessions, was to pro∣mise
them, in all future time, an impunity for rebellion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, Charles considered, that Scotland
was never before, under any of his ancestors, so united,
and so animated in its own defence; and yet had often been
able to foil or elude the force of England, combined heartily
in one cause, and enured by long practice to the use of
arms. How much greater difficulty should he find, at pre∣sent,
to subdue, by violence, a people, enflamed with reli∣gious
prejudices; while he could only oppose to, them a
nation, enervated by long peace, and lukewarm in his ser∣vice
<PB N="277" REF="323"/>
or what was more to be feared, many of them en∣gaged
in the same party with the enemy<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. iii. p. 936.</NOTE>. Should the war
be only protracted beyond a summer; (and who could ex∣pect
to finish it in that period?) his treasure would fail him;
and, for supply, he must have recourse to an English par∣liament,
whom, by fatal experience, he had ever found
more ready to encroach on the prerogatives, than to aid the
necessities, of the crown. And what if he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eceive a defeat
from the rebel army? This misfortune was far from im∣possible.
They were engaged in a national cause, and
strongly actuated by mistaken principles. His army was
retained entirely by pay, and looked on the quarrel with the
same indifference, which naturally belongs to mercenary
troops, without possessing the discipline, by which such
troops are commonly distinguished. And the consequences
of a defeat, while Scotland was enraged and England dis∣contented,
were so dreadful, that no motive should persuade him to venture it.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that Charles, by mistakes and oversights,
had brought himself to such a situation, that, whatever
side he embraced, his errors must be dangerous: No won∣der,
therefore, he was in great perplexity. But he did in∣finitely
worse, than embrace the worst party: For, pro∣perly
speaking, he embraced no party at all. He concluded
a sudden pacification, in which it was stipulated, That he
should withdraw his fleet and army; that, within eight and
forty hours, the Scots should dismiss their, forces, that the
King's forts should be restored to him; his authority ac∣knowleged;
and a general assembly and a parliament be im∣mediately
summoned, in order to compose all differences<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 945.</NOTE>. What were the <HI>reasons,</HI> which engaged the King to admit
such strange articles of peace, it is in vain to enquire: For
there could be none. The <HI>causes</HI> of that event may admit

<P><PB N="278" REF="326"/>
THE <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had been very indnstrious, in repre∣senting
to the English, the grievances under which Scotland
laboured, and the ill counsels, which had been suggested to
their, sovereign. Their liberties, they said, were invaded:
The prerogatives of the crown extended beyond all former
precedent: Illegal courts erected: The hierarchy exalted
at the expence of national privileges: And so many new
superstitions introduced by the haughty tyrannical prelates,
as begot a just suspicion, that a project was seriously formed
for the restoration of popery. The King's conduct, surely,
in Scotland, had been, in every thing, except in establish∣ing
the ecclesiastical canons, more legal and justifiable, than
in England; yet was the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e such a general resemblance in
the complaints of both kingdoms, that the English readily
assented to all the representations of the Scots malecontents,
and believed that nation to have been driven, by oppression,
into the violent counsels, which they had embraced. So
far, therefore, from being willing to second the King in
subduing the free spirits of the Scots; they rather pitied
that unhappy people, who had been reduced to those ex∣tremities:
And they thought, that the example of such
neighbours, as well as their assistance, might, soms time,
be advantageous to England, and encourage her to recover,
by a vigorous effort, her violated laws and liberties. The
gentry and nobility, who, without attachment to the
court, without command in the army, attended in great
numbers the English camp, greedily seized, and propagated,
and gave authority to these sentiments: A retreat, very
little honourable, which the Earl of Holland, with a con∣siderable
detachment of the English forces, had made before
a detachment of the Scots, caused all these humours to
blaze up at once: And the King, whose character was not
sufficiently vigorous nor decisive, and who was apr, from
facility, to embrace hasty counsels, suddnaly assented to a
measure, which was recommended by all about him, and
<PB N="279" REF="327"/>
which favoured his natural propension towards the misguided
subjects of his native kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 122, 123. May, p. 46.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES, having so far advanced in pacific measures,
ought, with a steddy resolution, to have prosecuted them,
and have submitted to every tolerable condition, demanded
by the assembly and parliament; nor should he have recom∣menced
hostilities, but on account of such enormous and
unexpected pretensions, as would have justified his cause,
if possible, to the whole English nation. So far, indeed,
he adopted this plan, that he agreed, not only to confirm
his former concessions, of abrogating the canons, the li∣turgy,
the high commission, and the articles of Perth; but
also to abolish the order itself of bishops, for which he had
so zealously contended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. iii. p. 946.</NOTE>. But this concession was gained
by the utmost violence, which he could impose on his dis∣position
and prejudices: He even secretly retained an in∣tention
of seizing favourable opportunities, in order to reco∣ver
the ground, which he had lost<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs, p. 154. Rush. vol. iii. p. 951.</NOTE>. And one step farther
he could not prevail with himself to advance. The assem∣bly,
when it met, payed not due deference to the king's
prepossessions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 17th</NOTE> but gave full indulgence to their own. They
voted episcopacy to be unlawful in the church of Scotland:
He was willing to allow it contrary to the constitutions of
that church. They stigmatised the liturgy and canons, as
popish: He agreed simply to abolish them. They deno∣minated
the high commission, tyranny: He was content
to set it aside<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. 958. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The parliament, which sat after the
assembly, advanced pretensions, which tended to dimi∣nish
the civil power of the monarch; and what pro∣bably
affected Charles much more, they were proceeding
to ratify the acts of assembly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War re∣newed.</NOTE> when,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 955.</NOTE> by the King's in∣structions,
Traquaire, the commissioner, prorogued them.
And on account of these claims, which might easily have
been foreseen, was the war renewed; with great advantages
<PB N="280" REF="328"/>
on the side of the covenanters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1638.</NOTE> and disadvantages on that
of the King.</P>
<P>No sooner had Charles concluded the pacification with∣out
conditions, than the necessity of his affairs, and his
want of money, obliged him to disband his army; and, as
they had been held together solely by mercenary views, it
was not possible without great trouble, and expence, and
loss of time, again to assemble them. The more prudent
covenanters had concluded, that their pretensions being
so contrary to the interest, and still more to the inclinations,
of the King, it was likely, that they should again be obliged
to support their cause by arms; and they were therefore
careful, in dismissing their troops, to preserve nothing but
the appearance of a pacific disposition. The officers had
orders to be ready on the first summons: The soldiers
were warned not to think the nation secure from an English
invasion: And the religious zeal, which animated all ranks
of men, made them immediately <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to their standards, so
soon as the trumpet was sounded by their spiritual and tem∣poral
leaders. The credit, which, in their last exp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dition,
they had acquired, by obliging their sovereign to depart
from all his pretensions, gave courage to every one, in un∣dertaking
this new enterprize<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 125. Rush. vol. iii. p. 1023.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1640.</NOTE> with great difficulty, made shift to draw to∣gether
an army:<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 13th.</NOTE> But soon found, that, all savings being
gone, and great debts contracted, his revenues would be
insufficient to support them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th English parliament.</NOTE> An English parliament, there∣fore,
formerly so unkind and intractable, must now, after
above eleven intermissions, trying many irregular methods of
taxation, after multiplied disgusts given to the puritanical
party, be summoned to assemble, amidst the most pressing
necessities of the crown.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Traquaire had intercepted a letter, wrote
to the King of France by the Scots malecontents; and had
<PB N="281" REF="329"/>
conveyed this letter to the King. Charles, partly repenting
of the large concessions which he had made to the Scots,
partly disgusted at their fresh insolences and pretensions,
seized this opportunity of breaking with them. He had
thrown into the Tower, the Lord Loudon, commissioner
from the covenanters; one of the persons who had signed
the treasonable letter<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Carendon, vol. i. p. 129. Rush. vol. iii. p. 956. May, p. 56.</NOTE> And he now laid the matter before
the parliament, whom he hoped to inflame by the resent∣ment,
and alarm by the danger, of this application to a
foreign power. By the mouth of the lord keeper, Finch, he
discovered his wants, and informed them, that he had been
able to assemble his army, and to subsist them, not by any
revenue which he possessed, but by means of a large debt
of above 300,000 pounds, which he had contracted, and
for which he had given security upon the crown-lands. He
represented, That it was necessary to grant supplies for the
immediate and urgent demands of his military armaments:
That the season was far advanced, the time precious, and
none of it must be lost in deliberation: That though
his coffers were empty, they had not been exhausted by un∣necessary
pomp, or sumptuous buildings, or any other kind
of magnificence: That whatever supplies had been levied
from his subjects, had been employed for their advantage
and preservation, and like vapours rising out of the earth,
and gathered into a cloud, had fallen in sweet and refreshing
showers on the same fields from which they had, at first,
been exhaled: That though he desired such immediate as∣sistance
as might prevent, for the time, a total disorder in
the government, he was far from any intention of pre∣cluding
them of their right to inquire into the state of the
kingdom, and to offer him petitions for the redress of their
grievances: That as much as was possible of this season should
be afterwards allowed them for that purpose: That as he
expected only such supply at present as the current service
<PB N="282" REF="330"/>
necessarily required, it would be necessary to assemble them
again next winter, when they should have full leisure to
conclude whatever business had, this season, been left im∣perfect
and unfinished: That the parliament of Ireland had
twice put such trust in his good intentions as to grant him,
in the beginning of the session, a very large supply, and had
ever experienced good effects from the confidence reposed in
him: And that, in every circumstance, his people should
find his conduct suitable to a just, pious, and gracious
King, and such as was calculated to promote an intire har∣mony
between prince and parliament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. iii. p. 1114.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOWEVER plausible these topics, they made small im∣pression
on the house of commons. By some illegal, and
several suspicious and imprudent measures of the crown,
and by the courageous opposition, which particular persons
amidst dangers and hardships, had made to them; the
minds of men, throughout the nation, had taken such a
turn as to ascribe every honour to the refractory oppo∣sers
of the King and the ministers. These were the
only patriots, the only lovers of their country, the only
heroes, and, perhaps too, the only true christians. A
reasonable compliance with the court, was slavish
de∣pendance; a regard to the King, servile flattery; a confi∣dence
in his promises, shameful prostitution. This general
cast of thought, which has, more or less, prevailed in
England, during near a century and a half, and which has
been the cause of much good and much ill in public affairs,
never predominated more than during the reign of Charles.
The present house of commons, being composed intirely of
country gentlemen, who came into parliament with all their
native prejudices about them, could not fail to contain a
majority of these stubborn patriots.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS likewife, by means of the Scots insurrection,
and the general discontents in England, were drawing so
near a crisis, that the leaders of the house, sagacious and
<PB N="283" REF="331"/>
penetrating, began to foresee the consequences, and to hope,
that the time, so longed wished for, was now come, when
royal authority must fall into a total subordination on popu∣lar
assemblies, and when public liberty must acquire a full
ascendant. By reducing the crown to necessities, they had
hitherto found, that the King had been pushed into violent
counsels, which had served extremely the purposes of his
adversaries: And by multiplying these necessities, it was
foreseen, that his prerogative, undermined on all sides,
must, at last, be overthrown, and be no longer dangerous
to the privileges of the people. Whatever, therefore, tended
to compose the differences between King and parliament,
and to preserve the government uniformly in its present
channel, was zealously opposed by these popular leaders;
and their past conduct and sufferings gave them credit suffi∣cient
to effect all their purposes.</P>
<P>TIS the situation which decides chiefly of the fortunes
and characters of men. The King, it must be owned,
though praiseworthy in many respects, was not endowed
with that masterly genius, which might enable him to ob∣serve,
in their infancy, the changes that arose in national
manners, and know how to accommodate his conduct to
them. He had not perceived, that his best policy was not,
by opposition, much less by invasions and encroachments,
to enrage the republican spirit of the people; but that he
ought, by gently departing from some branches of his he∣reditary
authority, to endeavour, as far as possible, to pre∣serve
the rest from the inroads of his jealous subjects. Still
tenacious of his prerogative, he found, that he could not
preserve the old claims of the crown without assuming new
ones: A principle similar to that which many of his sub∣jects
seem to have formed with regard to the liberties of the people.</P>
<P>THE house of commons, therefore, moved by these and
many other obvious reasons, instead of taking notice of the
<PB N="284" REF="332"/>
King's complaints against his Scots subjects, or his applica∣tions
for supply, entered immediately upon grievances; and
a speech, which Pym made them on that subject, was much
more hearkened to, than that which the lord keeper had de∣livered
them in the name of their sovereign. The subject
of Pym's harangue has been sufficiently explained above;
where we gave an account of all the grievances, imaginary
in the church, more real in the state, of which the nation,
at that time, so loudly complained<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 133. Rush. vol. iii. p. 1131. May. p. 60.</NOTE>. The house began
with examining the behaviour of the speaker the last day of
the former parliament; when he refused, on account of the
King's command, to put the question: And they declared it
a breach of privilege. They proceeded next to inquire in∣to
the imprisonment and prosecution of Sir John Elliot,
Hollis, and Valentine<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1136.</NOTE>: The affair of ship-money was can∣vassed:
And plentiful subject of inquiry was suggested on
all hands. Grievances were regularly classed under three
heads; those with regard to the privileges of parliament,
the property of the subject, and religion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Idem <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, p. 1147.</NOTE>. The King,
seeing a large and inexhaustible field opened, pressed them
again for supply; and finding his message ineffectual, he
came to the house of peers, and desired their good offices
with the commons. The peers were very sensible of the
King's urgent necessities; and thought, that supplies, on
this occasion, ought, both in reason and in decency, to go
before grievances. They ventured to represent their sense
of the matter to the commons; but their intercession did
harm. The commons had always claimed, as their pecu∣liar
province, the granting supplies; and, though the peers
had gone no farther than offering advice, they immediately
thought proper to vote so unusual and unprecedented an in∣terp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sition
to be a breach of privilege<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, vol. i. p. 134.</NOTE>. Charles, in order
<PB N="285" REF="333"/>
to bring the matter of supply to some issue, solicited the
house with the new messages: And finding, that the business
of ship-money gave great alarm and disgust; besides in∣forming
them, that he never intended to make a constant re∣venue
of it, that all the money levied had been regularly, with
other great sums, expended on equipping the navy; he
now went so far as to offer them intirely to abolish that im∣position,
by any law, which the commons should think
proper to present to him. In return, he asked only for his
urgent necessities, a supply of twelve subsidies, about six
hundred thousand pounds, and that payable in three years;
but, at the same time, he let them know, that considering
the situation of his affairs, a delay, would be equivalent to a
denial<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 135. Rush. vol. iii. p. 1154.</NOTE>. The King, though the majority was against him,
never had more friends in any house of commons; and the
debate was carried on for two days, with great zeal and
warmth on both sides.</P>
<P>IT was urged by the partizans of the court, That the
happiest occasion, which the fondest wishes could suggest,
was now presented, of composing all disgusts and jealousies
between King and people, and of reconciling their sove∣reign,
for ever, to the use of parliaments. That if they,
on their part, laid aside all enormous claims and pretensions,
and provided, in a reasonable manner, for the public ne∣cessities;
they needed entertain no suspicion of any insatiable
ambition or illegal usurpation in the crown. That though
due regard had not always been paid, during this reign, to
the rights of the people, yet no invasion of them had been
altogether deliberate and voluntary; much less, the result of
wanton tyranny and injustice; and still less, of a formed
design to subvert the constitution. That to repose a reason∣able
confidence in the King, and generously supply his pre∣sent
wants, which proceeded neither from prodigality nor
misconduct, would be the true way to gain on his generous
nature, and to extort, by a gentle violence, such concessions
<PB N="286" REF="334"/>
as were requisite for. the establishment of public liberty.
That he had promised, not only on the word of a. prince,
but also on that of a gentleman (the expression which he
had been pleased to use) that, after the supply was granted,
the parliament should still have the liberty to continue their
deliberations: Could it be suspected, that any man, any
prince, much less such a one, whose word was, as yet, sa∣cred
and inviolate, would, for so small a motive, forfeit his
honour, and, with it, all future trust and confidence, by
breaking a promise, so public and so solemn? That even if
the parliament should be deceived in reposing this confidence
in him, they neither lost any thing, nor incurred any danger;
since it was evidently necessary, for the security of public
peace, to supply him with money, in order to suppress the
Scots rebellion. That he had so far suited his first demands
to their prejudices, that he only asked a supply for a few
months, and was willing, after so short a trust, to fall again
into dependance, and to trust them for his farther support
and subsistence. That if he now seemed to desire some∣thing
farther, he also made them, in return, a considerable
offer, and was willing, for the furture, to depend on them for
a revenue, which was quite requisite for public honour and
security. That the nature of the English constitution sup∣posed
a mutual confidence between King and parliament:
And if they should refuse it on their part, especially with
circumstances of such outrage and indignity; what could
be expected but a total dissolution of government, and
violent factions, followed by the most dangerous convulsions
and intestine disorders?</P>
<P>IN opposition to these arguments, it was urged by the
malecontent party, That the court had discovered, on their
side, but few symptoms of that mutual trust and confidence,
to which they now so kindly invited the commons. That
eleven years intermission of parliaments, the longest which
was to be found in the English annals, was a sufficient indi∣cation
of the jealousy entertained against the people; or
<PB N="287" REF="335"/>
rather of designs formed for the suppression of all their li∣berties
and privileges. That the ministers might well plead
necessity; not could any thing, indeed, be a stronger proof
of some invincible necessity, than their embracing a measure,
for which they had conceived so violent an aversion, as the
assembling of an English parliament. That this necessity,
however, was purely ministerial, not national. And if the
same grievances, ecclesiastial and civil, under which this
nation itself laboured, had pushed the Scots to extremities;
was it requisite, that the English should forge their own
chains, by imposing chains on their unhappy neighbours?
That the antient practice of parliaments was to give
grievances the precedency of supply; and that this order,
so carefully observed by their ancestors, was founded on a
jealousy inherent in the constitution, and was never inter∣preted
as any particular diffidence of the present sovereign.
That a practice, which had been upheld, during times the
most favourable to liberty, could not, in common prudence,
be departed from, where such undeniable reasons for suspicion
had been afforded. That it was ridiculous to plead
the advanced season, and the urgent occasion for supply;
when it plainly appeared, that, in order to afford a pretence
for this topics, and to seduce the commons, great political
contrivance had been employed. That the writs for elec∣tions
were issued early in the winter; and if the meeting of
the parliament had not purposely been delayed, till so near
the commencement of military operations, there had been
leisure sufficient to have redressed all national grievances, and
to have proceeded afterwards to an examination of the
King's occasion for supply<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The reason probably why the King summoned the parliament so late, was, that he was resolved to try, whether this house of commons would be more compliant than their predecessors, and grant him supply on any reasonable terms. The urgency of the occasion, and the little time allowed for debate were motives and reasons, which he reserved against the male-contents in the house. He would not trust them with a long session, till he had seen some better proofs of their compliance: A sentiment natural enough in his situation.</NOTE> That the intention of so
<PB N="288" REF="336"/>
gross an artifice was to engage the commons, under pretence, of necessity, to violate the regular order of parliament;
and a precedent of that kind being once established, no inquiry
into public measures would afterwards be permitted.
That scarce any argument, more unfavourable, could be
pleaded for supply. than an offer to abolish ship-money; a
taxation, the most illegal and the most dangerous, which
had ever, in any reign, been imposed upon the nation. And
that, by bargaining for the remission of that duty, the
commons would,: in a manner, ratify, the authority, by
which it had been levied; or, at least, give encouragement
for advancing new pretensions of a like nature, in hopes of
resigning them on like advantageous conditions.</P>
<P>THESE reasoas, joined to so many, occasions of ill humour,
seemed to sway with the greater number: But to
make the matter worse, Sir Harry Vane, the secretary, told
the commons, without any authority from the King, that
nothing less than twelve subsidies would be accepted as a
recompence for the abolition of ship-money. This assertion,
proceeding from the indiscretion, if we are not rather
to call it the treachery, of Vane, displeased the house,
by showing a stissness and rigidity in the King, which, in
a claim so ill grounded, was deemed inexcusable<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 138</NOTE> We are
informed likewise, that some men, who were thought to
understand the state of the nation, affirmed in the house,
that the amount of twelve subsidies was a greater sum than
could be found in all England. Such were the happy ignorance
and inexperience those times, with regard to
taxes<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 136.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>THE King was in great doubt and perplexity. He saw,
that his friends in the house were out-numbered by his
enemies, and that the same counsels were still prevalent,
which had ever bred such opposition and disturbance. In∣stead
<PB N="289" REF="337"/>
of hoping, that any supply would be given him, to
carry on war against the Scots, whom the majority of the
house regarded as their best friends and sirmest allies; he
expected every day, that they would present him an address
for making peace with those rebels. And if the house met
again, a vote, he was informed, would certainly pass, to
blast his revenue of ship-money: and thereby renew all
the opposition, which, with so much difficulty, he had
surmounted, in levying that taxation. Where great evils
lie on all sides, it is very difficult to follow the best coun∣sels;
nor is it any wonder, that the King, whose ca∣pacity
was not equal to situations of such extreme delicacy,
should hastily have formed and executed a resolution of dis∣solving
this parliament:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissolution.</NOTE> A measure, however, of which he
soon after repented, and which the subseqent events, more
than any convincing reason, inclined every one to condemn.
The last parliament, which had ended with such rigour and
violence, had yet, at first, covered their intentions with a
greater appearance of moderation than this parliament had
hitherto assumed.</P>
<P>AN abrupt and violent dissolution must necessarily excite
great, discontents among the people, who usually put intire
confidence in their representatives, and expect from them
the redress of all grievances. As if there were not already
sufficient grounds of complaint, the King persevered still
in those counsels, which from experience, he might have
been sensible, were so dangerous and unpopular. Bellasis
and Sir John Hotham were summoned before the council;
and refusing to give any account of then conduct in parliament,
were committed to prison. All the petitions and
complaints, which had been sent to the committee of reli∣gion,
were demanded from Crew, chairman to that com∣mittee;
and on his refusal to deliver them, he was sent to
the Tower. The studies and even the pockets of the Earl
of Warwick and Lord Broke before the expiration of pri∣vilege,
<PB N="290" REF="338"/>
were searched, in expectation of finding treasonable
papers. These acts of authority were interpreted, with
some appearance of reason, to be invasions on the rights of
national assemblies<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol iii. p. 1167. May p. 61.</NOTE>. But the King, after the first provo∣cation
which he met with, never respected sufficiently the
privileges of the parliament; and, by his example, he far∣ther
confirmed their, resolution. when they should acquire
power, to pay like disregard to the prerogatives of the
crown.</P>
<P>THOUGH the parliament was dissolved, the convocation
was still allowed to sit; a practice, of which, since the
reformation, there were but few instances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was one in 1586. See history of Archbishop Laud, p. 80. The authority of the convocation was indeed quite independent of the parliament, and there was no reason, which required the one to be dissolved upon the dissolution of the other</NOTE>, and which was
for that reason supposed by many to be irregular. Besides
granting to the King a supply from the spirituality, and
framing many canons, the convocation, jealous, of like in∣novations
with those which had taken place in Scotland,
imposed an oath on the clergy, and the graduates in the
universities, by which every one swore to maintain the
established government of the church by archbishops, bishops,
deans, chapters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 33.</NOTE>. These steps, in the present
discontented humour of the nation, were commonly deemed,
illegal; because not ratified by consent of parliament, in
whom all authority was supposed to be centered. And no∣thing,
besides, could afford more subject of ridicule, than an
oath, which contained an <HI>et caetera</HI> in the midst of it.</P>
<P>THE people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontents in England</NOTE> who generally abhorred the convocation as
much as they adored the parliament, could scarce be
kept from insulting and abusing this assembly; and the
King was obliged to give them guards, in order to protect
them<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>. An attack too was made during the night upon
<PB N="291" REF="339"/>
Laud, in his palace of Lambeth, by above 500 persons;
and he found it necessary to fortify himself for his defence<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Dugdale; p. 62. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>.
A multitude of two thousand sectaries entered St. Paul's,
Where the high commission then sat; tore down all the
benches; and cried out, <HI>No bishops, no high commission</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 65</NOTE>.
All these instances of discontent were presa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of some great
revolution; had the court possessed sufficient skill to discern
the danger, or sufficient power, to provide against it.</P>
<P>IN this disposition of mens minds, it was in vain that
the King issued a declaration, in order to convince his people
of the necessity, which he lay under, of dissolving the last
parliament<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, volume iii. page 1166.</NOTE>. The chief topic, on which he insisted, was,
that the commons imitated the bad example of all their pre∣decessors,
of late years, in making continual encroachments
on his authority, in censuring his Whole administration and
conduct, in discussing every circumstance of public gover∣nment,
and in their indirect bargaining and contracting with
their King for supply; as if nothing ought to be given
him but what he should purchase, either by quitting some∣what
of his royal prerogative, or by diminishing and lessening
his standing revenue. These practices, he said, were con∣trary
to the maxims of their ancestors; and these practices
were totally incompatible with monarchy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>IT must be confessed, that the King here touched upon that circum∣stance in the English constitution, which it is most difficult, or rather alto∣ther impossible, to regulate by laws, and which must be governed by certain delicate ideas of propriety and decency, rather than by any exact rule or prescription. To deny the parliament all right of remonstrating against what they esteem grievances, were to reduce that assembly to a total insigni∣ficancy, and to deprive the people of every advantage, which they could reap from popular councils. To complain of the parliament's employing the power of taxation, as the means of extorting concessions from their sove∣reign, were to expect, that they would intirely disarm themselves, and re∣nounce the sole expedient, provided by the constitution, for ensuring to the kingdom a just and legal administration. In different periods of English story, there occur instances of their remonstrating with their princes in the freest manner, and sometimes of their refusing supply, when disgusted with any circumstance of public conduct. 'Tis, however, certain, that this power, though essential to parliaments, may easily be abused, as well by the frequency and minuteness of their remonstrances, as by their intrusion into every part of the King's counsels and determinations. Under colour of ad∣vice, they may give, disguised orders; and in complaining of grievances, they may draw to themselves every power of government, Whatever mea∣sure is embraced, without consulting them, may be pronounced an oppression of the people; and till corrected, they may refuse the most necessary sup∣plies to their indigent sovereign. From the very nature of this parliame∣ntary liberty, 'tis evident, that it must be left unbounded by law: For who can foretell, how frequently grievances may occur, or what part of admi∣nistration may be affected by them? From the nature too of the human frame, it may be expected, that this liberty would be exerted in its full ex∣tent, and no branch of authority be allowed to remain unmolested in the hands of the prince: For, will the weak limitations of respect and deco∣rum be sufficient to restrain human ambition, which so frequently breaks through all the prescriptions of law and justice?</P>
<P>BUT here it is observable, that the wisdom of the English constitution, or rather, the concurrence of accidents, has. provided, in different periods certain irregular checks to this privilege of parliament, and thereby main∣tained, in some tolerable measure, the dignity and authority of the crown.</P>
<P>IN the antient constitution, before the beginning of the seventeenth cen∣tury, the meetings of parliament were precarious, and were not frequent. The sessions were very short; and the members had no leisure, either to get acquainted with each other, or with public business. The ignorance of the age made men more submissive to that authority which governed them. And above all, the large demesnes of the crown, with the small expence of government during that period, rendered the prince almost independent, and taught the parliament to preserve a great submission and duty towards him.</P>
<P>IN our present constitution, many accidents which have rendered, govern∣ments, everywhere, as well as in Britain, much, more burthensome than formerly, have thrown into the hands of the crown the disposal of a very large revenue, and have enabled the King, by the private interest and ambi∣tion of the members, to restrain the public interest and ambition of the body. While the, opposition (for we must still have an opposition, open or disguised) endeavours to draw every branch of administration under the cog∣nizance of parliament, the courtiers reserve a part to the disposal of the crown; and the royal prerogative, though diminished of its antient powers, still maintains a due weight in the ballance of the constitution.</P>
<P>IT was the fate of the house of Stuart to govern England at a period, when the former source of authority was already much diminished, and be∣fore the latter began to flow in any tolerable abundance. Without a regu∣lar and fixed foundation, the throne continually tottered; and the prince sat upon it anxiously and precariously. Every expedient, used by James and Charles, in order to support their dignity, we have seen attended with sen∣sible inconveniences. The majesty of the crown, derived from antient powers and prerogatives, procured respect; and checked the approaches of insolent intruders: But it begot in the King so high an idea of his own rank and station, as made him incapable of stooping to popular courses, or submitting, in any degree, to the controul of parliament. The alliance with the hierarchy strengthened law by the sanction of religion: But it en∣raged the puritanical party, and exposed the prince to the attacks of ene∣mies, numerous, violent, and implacable. The memory too of these two Kings, from like causes, has been attended, in some degree, with the same infelicity, which pursued, them during the whole course of their lives. Tho' it must be consessed, that their skill in government was not proportioned to the extreme delicacy of their situation; a sufficient indulgence has not been given them, and all the blame, by several historians, has been unjustly thrown on <HI>their</HI> side. Their violations of law, particularly those of Charles, are sometimes transgressions of a plain limit, which was marked out to royal authority. But the encroachments, of the commons, though less positive and determinate, are no less discernible by good judges, and were equally capable of destroying the just ballance of the constitution. While they exercised the powers, transmitted to them, in a manner more independent, and less complaint than had ever before been practised; the Kings were, perhaps imprudently, but, as they imagined; from necessity, tempted to assume powers, which had scarce ever been exercised, or had been exercised in a different manner, by the crown. And from the shock of there opposite pretensions, together with religious controversy, arosed all the factions, convulsions, and disorders, which attended that period.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="340"/>
THE King, disappointed of parliamentary subsidies,
was obliged to have recourse to other expedients, in order
<PB N="293" REF="341"/>
to supply his urgent necessities. The ecclesiastical subsidies
served him in some stead: and it seemed but just, that the
clergy should contribute to a war, which was, in a great
measure, of their own raising<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">May, page 48.</NOTE>. He borrowed money from
his ministers and courtiers; and so much was he beloved
among them, that above 30,000 pounds were subscribed
in a few days: Though nothing surely could be more dis∣agreeable
<PB N="294" REF="342"/>
to a prince, full of dignity, than to be a burthen
on his friends, instead of being a support to them. Some
attempts were made towards forcing a loan from the citi∣zens;
but still repelled by the spirit of liberty, which was
now become unconquerable<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii, p. 1181.</NOTE>. A loan of 40,000 pounds
was extorted from the Spanish merchants, who had bullion
in the Tower, exposed to the attempts of the King. Coat
and conduct-money for the soldiery was levied on the coun∣ties;
an antient practice<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Idem vol. i. p. 168.</NOTE>, but supposed to be abolished by
the petition of right. All the pepper was bought from the
East-India company upon trust, and sold, at great discount,
for ready money<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">May p. 63.</NOTE>. A scheme was proposed for coining two
or three hundred thousand pounds of base money<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol iii. p. 1216. May p. 63.</NOTE>. Such
were the extremities to which Charles was reduced. The
fresh difficulties, which, amidst the present distresses, were,
every day, raised, with regard to the payment of ship∣money,
obliged him to exert continual acts of authority,
augmented extremely the discontents of the people, and in∣creased
his indigence and necessities<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1173, 1182, 1184, 1199, 1200, 1203, 1204.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE present expedients, however, enabled the King,
though with great difficulty, to march his army, consisting
of 19,000 foot and 2000 horse<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 1279.</NOTE>. The Earl of Northum∣berland
was appointed general: The Earl of Strafford, who
was called over from Ireland, lieutenant-general: Lord
(Conway, general of the horse. A very small fleet was
thought sufficient to serve the purposes of this expedition.</P>
<P>So great are the effects of zeal and unanimity, that the
Scots army, though somewhat superior, were sooner ready
than the King's; and advanced to the borders of England.
To engage them to proceed, besides their general know∣ledge
of the secret discontents of that kingdom, Lord Saville
<PB N="295" REF="343"/>
had forged a letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Aug.</NOTE> in the name of six noblemen, the most
considerable of England, in which the Scots were in∣vited
to assist their neighbours, in procuring a redrefs of
their grievances<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 427.</NOTE>. Notwithstanding these wariike prepara∣tions
and hostile attempts, the covenanters still preserved
the most pacific and most submissve language; and en∣tered
England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Aug.</NOTE> as they said, with no other view, than to
obtain access to the King's presnce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rout at Newburn.</NOTE> and lay their humble
petition at his royal feet. At Newburn upon Tyne, they
were opposed by a detachment of 4500 men under Con∣way,
who seemed resolute to dispute with them the passage
of the river. The Scots first entreated them, with great
civility, not to stop them in their march to their gracious
sovereign; and then attacked them with great, bravery,
killed several, and chased the rest from their ground. Such
a panic seized the whole English army, that the forces at
Newcastle fled immediately to Durham; and not yet think∣ing
themselves safe, they deserted that town, and retreated,
into Yorkshire<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 143.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE. Scots took possession of Newcastle; and though
sufficiently elated with their victory, they preserved exact dis∣cipline,
and persevered in their resolution of paying for every∣thing,
in order to maintain still the appearance of an amica∣ble
correspondence with England. They also dispatched
messengers to the King, who was arrived at York; and they
took care, after the advantage which they had obtained,
to redouble their expressions of loyalty, duty, and submis∣sion
to his person, and even made apologies, full of sorrow
and contrition, for their late victory<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1255</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES was in a very distressed situation, The na∣tion
was universally and highly discontented. The army
was discouraged, and began likewise to be discontented, both
<PB N="296" REF="344"/>
from the contagion of general disgust, and as an excuse for
their misbehaviour, which they were desirous of represent∣ing
rather as want of will than of courage to fight. The
treasury too was quite exhausted, and evesy expedient for
a supply had been tried to the uttermost. No event had
happened, but what might have been foreseen as necessary,
or at least, as very probable; yet such was the King's situa∣tion,
that no provision could be made, nor was even any
resolution taken against such an exigency.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent the advance of the Scots upon him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty at Rippon.</NOTE> the
King agreed to a treaty, and named sixteen English noblemen,
who met with eleven Scots commissioners at Rippon. The
Earls of Hertford, Bedford, Salisbury, Warwick, Essex, Hol∣land,
Bristol, and Berkshire, the Lords Kimbolton, Whar∣ton,
Dunsmore, Paget, Broke, Saville, Paulet, and How∣ard
of Escric, were chosen by the King; all of them popu∣lar
men, and consequently supposed no-wife averse to the
Scots invasion, nor unacceptable to that nation<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 155.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN address arrived from the city of London, petitioning
for a parliament; the great point, to which all mens pro∣jects
at this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me tended<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1263.</NOTE>. Twelve noblemen presented a
petition to the same purpose<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Cla∣rendon, vol. i. p. 146. Rush. vol. iii. p. 1260, May, p. 66. Warwick, p. 151.</NOTE>. But the King contented
himself with summoning a great council of the peers to
York; a measure, which had formerly been taken in cases
of sudden emergency, but which, at present, could serve
to no manner of purpose. Perhaps, the King, who dreaded,
above all things, the house of commons, and who ex∣pected
no supply from them on any reasonable terms,
thought, that in his present urgent distresses, he might
be enabled to levy subsidies by the authority of the peers
alone. But the employing, so long, a plea of necessity
<PB N="297" REF="345"/>
which was very distant and doubtful, rendered it impossible
for him to avail himself of a necessity, which was now at
last become real, urgent, and inevitable.</P>
<P>BY Northumberland's sickness, the command of the army
had devolved on Strafford. That nobleman possessed more
vigour of mind than the King or any of the council. He
advised Charles rather to put all to hazard, than submit
to such unworthy terms as were likely to be imposed upon
him. The loss sustained at Newburn, he said was in∣considerable;
and though a panic had, for the time, seized
the army, that was nothing strange among new levied
troops; and the Scots, being in the same condition, would,
no doubt, be liable, in their turn, to a like accident. His
opinion, therefore, was, that the King should push for∣ward,
and attack the Scots, and bring the affair to a quick:
decision; and, if he was ever so unsuccessful, nothing worse
could befal him, than what, from his inactivity, he would
certainly be exposed to<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 5.</NOTE>, To show how easy it would be
to execute this project, he ordered an assault to be made on
some quarters of the Scots, and he gained an advantage
over them. No cessation of arms had, as yet, been agreed
to, during the treaty at Rippon; yet great clamour pre∣vailed,
on account of this act of hostility. And when it
was known, that the officer, who conducted the attack,
was a papist, a violent outcry was raised against the King,
for employing that hated sect, in the murder of his pro∣testant
subjects<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 159.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT may be worthy of remark, that several mutinies had
arisen among the English, troops, when marching to join
the army; and some officers had been murdered, merely
on the suspicion of their being papists<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1190, 1191, 1192, &amp;c. May, p. 64.</NOTE>. The petition of
right had abolished all martial law; and by an inconveni∣ence
<PB N="298" REF="346"/>
which naturally attended the plan,. as yet new and
unformed, of regular and rigid liberty, it was found ab∣solutely
impossible for the generals to govern the army, by
all the authority which the King could legally confer upon
them. The lawyers had declared, that martial law could not
be exercised, except in the very presence of an enemy; and
because it had been found necessary to execute a mutineer,
the generals thought it adviseable, for their safety, to apply
for a pardon from the crown. This weakness, however,
was carefully concealed from the army; and Lord Conway
said, that, if any lawyer was so imprudent as to discover
the secret to the soldiers, it would be necessary instantly to
refute him, and to hang the lawyer himself, by sentence of
a court―martial<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1199.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN army new levied, undisciplined, frightened, seditious,
ill-paid, and governed by no proper authority, was very
unsit for withstanding a victorious and high-spirited enemy,
and retaining in subjection a discontented and zealous na∣tion.</P>
<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24 Sept</NOTE> in despair of being able to stem the torrent,
at last resolved to yield to it: And as he foresaw, that the
great council of the peers would advise him to call a par∣liament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great coun∣cil of the peers.</NOTE>
he told them, in his first speech, that he had al∣ready
taken that resolution. He informed them likewise,
that the Queen, in a letter, which she had wrote to him,
had very earnestly recommended that measure. This, good
Prince, who was extremely attached to his consort, and
who passionately wished to render her popular in the na∣tion,
forgot not, amidst all his distress, the interest of his
domestic tenderness<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 154. vol. iii, p. 1275</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to subsist both armies (for the King was obliged,
in order to save the northern counties, to pay his enemies)
<PB N="299" REF="347"/>
Charles wrote to the city, desiring a loan of 200,000
pounds. And the peers at York, whose authority was now
much greater than that of their sovereign, joined in the
same request<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iii. p. 1279.</NOTE>. So low was this Prince already fallen, in the
eyes of his own subjects!</P>
<P>As many difficulties occurred in the negotiation with the
Scots, it was proposed to transfer the treaty from Rippon
to London: A proposal willingly embraced by the Scots,
who were now sure of treating with advantage, in a place,
where the King, they foresaw, would be, in a manner, a
prisoner, in the midst of his implacable enemies, and their
determined friends<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 1305.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE causes of disgust, which, for above thirty years,
had every day been multiplying in England, were
now come to full maturity, and threatened the kingdom
with some great revolution or convulsion. The uncertain
and undefined limits of prerogative and privilege had been
eagerly disputed during that whole period; and in every
controversy between prince and people, the question, how∣ever
doubtful, had always been decided, by each party, in
favour of its own pretensions. Too lightly moved by the
appearance of necessity, the King had even assumed powers
incompatible with the principles of limited government, and
had rendered it impossible for his most zealous partizans
intirely to justify his conduct, except by topics so odious,
that they were more sitted, in the present disposition of mens
minds, to inflame, than appease, the general discontent.
Those great supports of public authority, law and religion,
had likewise, by the unbounded compliance of judges and
prelates, lost much of their influence over the people; or
rather, had in a great measure gone over to the side of fac∣tion,
and authorized the spirit of opposition and rebellion.
<PB N="301" REF="349"/>
The nobility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LIV.</NOTE> likewise, whom the King had no means of
retaining by offices and preferments suitable to their rank,
had been seized with the general discontent, and unwarily
threw themselves into the scale, which began already too
much to preponderate. Sensible of some encroachments
which had been made by royal authority, men entertained no
jealousy of the commons, whose enterprises, for the acqui∣sition
of power, had ever been covered with the appearance
of public good, and had hitherto gone no farther than some
disappointed efforts and endeavours. The progress of the
Scots malecontents reduced the crown to an intire depend∣ence
for supply: Their union with the popular party in
England brought great accession of authority to the latter:
The near prospect of success roused all the latent murmurs
and pretensions of the nation, which had hitherto been held
in such violent constraint: And the torrent of general in∣clination
and opinion ran so strong against the count, that the
King was in no sitnation to refuse any reasonable pretensions
of the popular leaders, either for defining or limiting the
powers of his prerogative. Even many exorbitant claims,
in the present situation, would probably be made, and must
necessarily be complied with.</P>
<P>THE triumph of the malecontents over the church was
not yet so immediate or certain. Tho' the political and re∣ligious
puritans mutually lent assistance to each other, there
were many who joined the former, and yet declined all
manner of connexion with the latter. The hierarchy had
been established in England ever since the reformation: The
Romish church, in all ages, had carefully maintained that
form of ecclesiastical government: The antient fathers too
bore testimony to episcopal jurisdiction: And tho' parity
may seem at first to have had place among christian pastors,
the period, during which it prevailed, was so short, that
few undisputed traces of it remained in hislory. The bishops
and their more zealous partizans inferred thence, the divine
<PB N="302" REF="350"/>
indefeizable right of prelacy: Others regarded that institu∣tion
as venerable and useful: And, if the love of novelty led
some to adopt the new rites and discipline of the puritans;
the reverence to antiquity retained many in their attachment
to the liturgy and government of the church. It behoved,
therefore, the zealous innovators in parliament to proceed
with some caution and reserve. By promoting all measures
which reduced the exorbitant powers of the crown, they
hoped to disarm the King, whom they justly regarded, from
principle, inclination, and policy, to be the determined pa∣tron
of the hierarchy. By declaiming against the supposed
encroachments and tyranny of the prelates, they endeavoured
to carry the nation, from a hatred of their persons, to an
opposition against their office and character. And when
men were inlisted in party, it would not be difficult, they
thought, to lead them by degrees into many measures, for
which they formerly entertained the greatest aversion. Tho'
the new sectaries composed not, at first, the majority of the
nation, they were inflamed, as is usual among innovators,
with extreme zeal for their opinions. Their unsurmount∣able
passion, disguised to themselves, as well as to others,
under the appearance of holy fervours, was well qualified
to make proselytes, and to seize the minds of the ignorant
multitude. And one furious enthusiast was able, by his
active industry, to surmount the indolent efforts of many
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ober and reasonable antagonists.</P>
<P>WHEN the nation, therefore, was so generally discon∣tented,
and little suspicion was entertained of any design to
subvert the church and monarchy; no wonder, that almost
all elections ran in favour of those, who, by their high pre∣tensious
to piety and patriotism, had encouraged the national
prejudices. 'Tis an usual compliment to regard the King's
inclination in the choice of a speaker; and Charles had in∣tended
to advance Gardiner, recorder of London, to that
important trust: But so little interest did the crown, at that
time, possess in the nation, that Gardiner was disappointed
<PB N="303" REF="351"/>
of his election, not only in London, but in every other
place where it was attempted: And the King was obliged
to make the choice of speaker fall on Lenthal, a lawyer of
some character, but not sufficiently qualified for so high and
difficult an office<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE eager expectations of men with regard to a parlia∣ment,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of the long parliment, Nov. 3.</NOTE> summoned at so critical a juncture, and during such
general discontents; a parliament, which, from the situa∣tion
of public affairs, could not be abruptly dissolved, and
which was to execute every thing left unfinished by former
parliaments; these views, so important and interesting, en∣gaged
the attendance of all the members; and the house of
commons was never observed to be, from the beginning, so
numerous and frequent. Without, any interval, therefore,
they entered upon business, and by unanimous consent they
immediately struck a blow, which may, in a manner, be
regarded as decisive.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Strafford was considered as chief minister
of state, both on account of the credit which he possessed
with his master, and of his own great and uncommon vi∣gour
and capacity. By a concurrence of accidents, this
man laboured under the severe hatred of all the three na∣tions
which composed the British monarchy. The Scots,
whose authority now ran extremely high, looked on him as
the capital enemy of their country, and one whose counsels
and influence they had most reason to apprehend. He had
engaged the parliament of Ireland to advance large subsidies,
in order to support a war against them: He had levied an
army of 9000 men, with which he had menaced all their
Western coast: He had obliged the Scots, who lived under
his government, to renounce the covenant, their national
idol: He had in Ireland proclaimed the Scots covenanters
rebels and traitors, even before the King had issued any
<PB N="304" REF="352"/>
such declaration against them in England: And he had ever
dissuaded his master against the late treaty and suspension of
arms, which he regarded as dangerous and dishonourable.
So avowed and violent were the Scots in their resentment of
all these measures, that they had refused, to send commis∣sioners
to treat at York, as was first proposed; because,
they said, the lieutenant of Ireland, their capital enemy,
being general of the King's forces, had there the chief com∣mand
and authority.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD, first as deputy, then as lord lieutenant,
had governed Ireland during eight years with great vigilance,
activity, and prudence, but with very litde popularity. In
a nation so averse to the English government and religion,
these very virtues were sufficient to draw on him the public
hatred. The manners too and character of this great man,
tho' to all full of courtesy, and to his friends full of af∣fection,
were, at bottom, haughty, rigid, and severe. His
authority and influence, during the time of his govern∣ment,
had been unlimited; but no sooner did adversity
seize him, than the concealed aversion of the nation blazed
up at once, and the Irish parliament used every expedient
to aggravate the charge against him.</P>
<P>THE universal discontent, which prevailed in England
against the court; was all pointed towards the Earl of Straf∣ford;
tho' without any particular reason, but because he
was the minister of state, whom the King most favoured
and most trusted. His extraction was honourable, his pa∣ternal
fortune considerable: Yet envy attended his sudden
and great elevation. And his former associates in popular
councils, finding that he owed his advancement to the de∣sertion
of their cause, represented him as the great apostate
of the commonwealth, whom it behoved them to sacrifice,
as a victim to public justice.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD, sensible of the load of popular prejudices.
Under which he laboured, would gladly have declined at∣tendance
<PB N="305" REF="353"/>
on the parliament; and he begged the King's per∣mission
to withdraw himself to his government of Ireland,
or at least to remain at the head of the army in Yorkshire;
wheremany opportunities, he hoped, would offer, by rea∣son
of his distance, to elude the attacks of his enemies.
But Charles, who had intire confidence in the Earl's capa∣city,
thought that his counsels would be extremely useful
during the critical session which approached. And when
Stasford stil insisted on the danger of appearing amidst so
many enraged enemies, the King, little apprehensive that
his own authority was so suddenly to expire, promised him
protection, and assured him, that not a hair of his head
should be touched by the parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>No sooner was Strafford's arrival known,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th Nov.</NOTE> than a concerted
attack was made upon him in the house of commons. Pym,
in a long, studied discourse, divided into many heads after
his manner, enumerated all the grievances under which the
nation, laboured; and, from a complication of such op∣pressions,
inferred, that a deliberate plan had been formed of
changing intirely, the frame of government, and subverting
the antient laws and liberties of the kingdom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>. Could any
thing, he said, increase our indignation against so enormous
and criminal a project, it would be to find, that, during
the reign of the best of princes, the constitution had been
endangered by the worst of ministers, and that the virtues
of the King had been seduced by wicked and pernicious
counsels. We must inquire, added he, from what fountain
these waters of bitterness flow; and tho' doubtiess many
evil counsellors will be found to have contributed their en∣deavours,
yet there is one who challenges the infamous pre∣eminence,
and who, by his courage, enterprize, and capa∣city
is intitled to the first place among these betrayers of
their country. HE is the Earl of Strafford, lieutenant of
Ireland, and president of the council of York, who, in both
<PB N="306" REF="354"/>
places, and in all other provinces where he has been en∣trusted
with authority, has raised ample monuments of ty∣ranny,
and will appear, from a survey of his actions, to be
the chief promoter of every arbitrary counsel. Some in∣stances
of imperious expressions, as well as actions, were
given by Pym; who afterwards entered into a more personal
attack of that minister, and endeavoured to expose his whole
character and manners. The austere genius of Strafford,
occupied in the pursuits of ambition, had not rendered his
breast altogether inaccessible to the tender passions, or se∣cured
him from the dominion of the fair;and in that sullen
age, when the irregularities of pleasure were more reproach∣ful
than the most odious crimes, these weaknesses were
thought worthy of being mentioned, together with his trea∣sons,
before so great an assembly. And upon the whole,
the orator concluded, that it belonged to the house to pro∣vide
a remedy proportionable to the disease, and to prevent
the farther mischiefs justly to be apprehended from the in∣fluence
which this man had acquired over the measures and
counsels of their sovereign<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIR John Clotworthy an Irish gentleman, Sir John Ho∣tham
of Yorkshire, and many others, entered into the same
topics: And after several hours spent in bitter invective,
when the doors were locked, in order to prevent all disco∣very
of their, purpose; it was moved, in consequence of
the resolution secretly taken, that Strafford should imme∣diately
be impeached of high treason. This motion was
received with universal approbation; nor was there, in all
the debate, one person who offered to stop the torrent by
any testimony in favour of the Earl's conduct. Lord
Falkland alone, tho' known to be his enemy, modeistly de∣sired
the house to consider, whether it would not better
fuit the gravity of their proceedings, first to digest, by a
committee, many of those particulars which had been men∣tioned
<PB N="307" REF="355"/>
before they sent up an accusation against, him.
It was ingenuously answered by Pym, That such a delay might
probably blast all their hopes, and put it out of their power
to proceed any farther in the prosecution: That when Straf∣ford
should learn, that so; many of his enormities were dis∣covered,
his conscience would dictate his condemnation;
and so great was his power and credit, he would immedi∣ately
procure the dissolution of the parliament, or attempt
some other desperate measure for his own preservation:
That the commons were only accusers, not judges; and
it was the province of the peers to determine, whether such
a complication of enormous crimes in one person, did not
amount to the highest crime known by the law<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 174</NOTE>. Without
farther debate, the accusation was voted: Pym was chosen
to carry up the impeachment: Most of the house accom∣panied
him on so agreeable an errand: And Strafford, who
had just entered the house of peers, and who little expected
so speedy a prosecution, was immediately, upon this general
charge, ordered into custody, with several symptoms of
violent prejudice in his judges, as well as in his prose∣cutors.</P>
<P>IN the inquiry concerning grievances and the censure of
past measures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laud im∣peached</NOTE> Laud could not long escape the severe scru∣tiny
of the commons; who were led too in their accusa∣tion
of that prelate as well by their prejudices against his
whole order, as by the extreme antipathy which his intem∣perate
zeal had drawn upon him. After a deliberation
which scarce listed half an hour, an impeachment of high
treason was resolved on against this subject:, the first, both
in rank and in favour, throughout the kingdom. Though
this incident, considering the example of Stafford's im∣peachment
and the present disposition of the nation and
parliament, needed be no surprize to him; yet was he be∣trayed
into some passion, when the accusation was presented.
<PB N="308" REF="356"/>
<HI>The commons themselves,</HI> he said, <HI>though his accusers, did
not believe him guilty of the crimes with which they charged
him:</HI> An indiscretion, which, next day, upon more mature
deliberation, he desired leave to retract; but so little favour∣able
were the peers, that they refused him this advantage
or indulgence. Laud was immediately, upon this general
charge, sequestered from parliament, and committed to cus∣tody<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 177. Whitlocke, P. 38. Rushworth, vol. iii. P, 1365.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE capital article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord keeper Finch flies.</NOTE> insisted on against these two great
men, was the design which the commons supposed to have
been formed for subverting the laws and constitution of
England, and introducing arbitrary and unlimited authority
into the kingdom. Of all the King's ministers, no one was
so obnoxious in this respect as the lord keeper, Finch. He
it was, who, being speaker in the King's third parliament,
had left the chair, and refused to put the question, when
ordered by the house. The extrajudicial opinion of the
judges in the case of ship-money had been procured by his
intrigues, persuasions, and even menaces. In all unpopular
and illegal measures, he was ever most active; and he was
even believed to have declared publickly, that while he was
keeper, an order of the council should always with him be
equivalent to a law. To appease the rising displeasure of
the commons, he desired to be heard at their bar. He
prostrated himself with all humility before them; but this
submission availed him nothing. An impeachment was re∣solved
on; and in order to escape their fury, he thought
proper secretly to withdraw, and to retire into Holland. As
he was not esteemed equal to Strafford, or even to Laud,
either in capacity or in sidelity to his master; it was gene∣rally
believed, that his escape had been connived at by the
popular leaders<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 177. Whitlocke, P. 38. Rushworth, vol. i. p. 129, 136.</NOTE>. His impeachment, however, in his ab∣sence,
was carried up to the house of peers.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="357"/>
SIR Francis Windebank, the secretary, was a creature of,
Laud; and that was sufficient reason for his being ex∣tremely
obnoxious to the commons. He was secretly su∣spected
too of the crime of popery; and it was known,
that, from complaisance to the Queen, and indeed in comp∣liance
with the King's maxims of government, he had
granted many indulgences to catholics, and had signed war∣rants
for the pardon of priests, and their delivery from con∣finement.
Grimstone, a popular member, called him, in
the house, the very pander and broker to the whore of
Babylon<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 122.</NOTE>, Finding that the scrutiny of the commons was
pointing towards him, and being sensible that England was
no longer a place of safety for men of his character, he sud∣denly
made his escape into France<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 178. Whit∣locke, p. 37.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, in a few weeks, this house of commons, not op∣posed
or rather seconded by the peers, had produced such
a revolution in the government, that the two most powerful
and most favoured ministers of the King were thrown into the
Tower, and daily expected to be tried for their life: Two
other ministers had, by slight alone, saved themselves from
a like fate: All the King's servants saw evidently, that no
protection could be given them by their master: A new
jurisdiction was erected in the nation; and before that tri∣bunal
all those trembled, who had before exulted moil in
their credit and authority.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered the power of the commons the more
sormidable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great au∣thority of the com∣mons.</NOTE> was, the extreme prudence with which it was
conducted. Not contented with the authority which they
had acquired by attacking these great ministers, they were
resolved to render the most considerable bodies of the na∣tion
obnoxious to them. Tho' the idol of the people, they
determined to fortify themselves likewise with terrors, and
<PB N="310" REF="358"/>
to overawe those who might still be inclined to support the
falling ruins of monarchy.</P>
<P>DURING the ate military operations, several powers had
been exerted by the heute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and deputy-lieutenants of
the counties: And these powers, though necessary for the
defence of the nation, and even warranted by all former
precedents, yet not being authorized by statute, were now
voted to be illegal; and the porsons who had assumed them,
declared <HI>delinquents.</HI> This term was newly come into
vogue, and expressed a degree and species of guilt not ex∣actly
known nor ascertained. In consequence of that deter∣mination,
many of the nobility and prime gentry of the
nation, while only exerting, as they justly thought, the
legal powers of magistracy, unexpectedly found themselves
involved in the crime of delinquency. And the commons
reaped this multiplied advantage by their vote: They dis∣armed
the crown; they, established the maxims of rigid
law and liberty; and they spread the terror of their own
authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 176.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE writs for ship-money had been directed to the she∣riffs,
who were required, and even obliged under severe pe∣nalties,
to assess the sums upon individuals, and to levy
them by their authority: Yet were all the sheriffs, and all
those employed in that illegal service, voted by a very ri∣gorous
sentence, to be delinquents. The King, by the
maxims of law, could do no wrong: His ministers and ser∣vants,
of whatever degree, in case of any violation of the
constitution, were alone culpable<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the farmers and officers of the customs, who had
been employed, during so many years, in levying tonnage
and poundage and the new impositions, were likewise de∣clared
criminal, and were afterwards glad to compound for
a pardon by paying a fine of 150,000 pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="359"/>
EVERY discretionary or arbitrary sentence of the star∣chamber
and high commission; courts, which, from their
very constitution, were arbitrary; underwent a severe scru∣tiny:
And all those, who had any hand in such sentences,
were voted to be liable to the penalties of the law<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 177.</NOTE>. No
minister of the King, no member of the council, but what
found himself exposed by this determination.</P>
<P>THE judges, who had given their votes against Hamb∣den
in the trial of ship-money, were accused before the
peers, and obliged to find security for their appearance.
Berkeley, one of the judges of the king's bench, was seized
by order of the house, even when sitting in his tribunal;
and all men saw with astonishment the irresistible authority
of their jurisdictionn<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 39.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE sanction of the lords and commons, as well as that
of the King, was declared necessary for the confirmation of
all ecclesiastical canons<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. i. p. 678.</NOTE>. And this judgment, it must be
confessed, however reasonable, at least useful, it would have
been difficult to justify by any precedent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An act of parliament, 25 Hen. VIII. cap. 19. al∣lowed the convocation with the King's consent to make canons. By the fa∣mous act of submison to that Prince, the clergy bound themselves to enact no canons without the King's consent. The parliament was never mentioned nor thought of. Such pretensions as the commons advanced at present, would, in any former age, have been deemed it strange usurpations.</NOTE>. But the pre∣sent
was no time for question or dispute. That decision,
which abolished all legislative power except that of parlia∣ment,
was requisite for compleating the new plan of liberty,
and rendering it quite uniform and systematical. Almost all
the bench of bishops, and the most considerable of the in∣ferior
clergy, who had voted in the late convocation, found
themselves exposed, by these new principles, to the impu∣tation
of delinquency<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Claren∣don, vol. i. p. 206. Whitlocke, p. 37. Rush. vol. v. p. 235, 359. Nal∣son, vol. i. p. 807.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="360"/>
THE most unpopular of all Charles's measures, the most
unpolitic, the most oppressive, and even, excepting ship∣money,
the most illegal, was the revival of monopolies, so
solemnly abolished, after re-iterated endeavours, by a recent
act of parliament. Sensible of this unhappy measure, the
Kind had, of himself, recalled, during the time of his first
expedition against Scotland, many of these destructive pa∣tents,
and the rest were now annihilated by authority of
parliament, and every one concerned in them declared de∣linquents.
The commons carried so far their detestation of
this odious measure, that they assumed a power which had
formerly been seldom practised<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord C'arendon says it was intirely new; but there are some instances of it in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eign of Elizabeth. D'Ewes, p. 296, 352.</NOTE>, and expelled all their
members who were monopolists or projectors: An artifice,
by which, besides increasing their own privileges, they
weakened still farther the very small party which the King
secretly retained in the house. Mildmay, a notorious mono∣polist,
yet having associated himself with the ruling party,
was still allowed to keep his seat. In all questions indeed of
elections, no steddy rule of decision was observed; and no∣thing
farther was regarded than the affections and attach∣ment
of the parties<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 176.</NOTE>. Mens passions were too much
heated to be shocked with any instance of injustice, which
served ends so popular as those pursued by this house of
commons.</P>
<P>THE whole sovereign power being thus in a manner
transferred to the commons, and the government, without
any seeming violence or disorder, changed, in a moment,
from a monarchy almost absolute; to a pure democracy;
the popular leaders seemed willing for some time to suspend
their active vigour, and to consolidate their authority ere
they proceeded to any violent exercise of it. Every day
produced some new harangue on past grievances. The de∣testation
<PB N="313" REF="361"/>
of former usurpations, was farther enlivened: The
jealousy of liberty roused: And agreeable to the true spirit
of free government, an equal indignation was excited, by
the view of a violated constitution, as by the ravages of the
most enormous tyranny.</P>
<P>Now was the time when genius and capacity of all kinds,
freed from the restraint of authority, and nourished by un∣bounded
hopes and projects, began to exert themselves, and
be distinguished by the public. Then was celebrated the
sagacity of Pym, more, fitted for use than ornament; matured,
not chilled, by his advanced age and long experience: Then
was displayed the mighty ambition of Hambden, taught dis∣guise,
not moderation, from former constraint; supported by
courage, conducted by prudence, embellished by modesty;
but whether founded in a love of power or zeal for liberty,
is still, from his untimely end, left doubtful and uncertain:
Then too were known the dark, ardent, and dangerous
character of St. John; the impetuous spirit of Hollis, vio∣lent
and sincere, open and intire in his enmities and in his
friendships; the enthusiastic genius of young Vane, extra∣vagant
in the ends which he pursued, sagacious and pro∣found
in the means which he employed; incited by the
appearances of religion, negligent of the duties of mora∣lity.</P>
<P>So little apology would be received for past measures, so
contagious the general spirit of discontent, that even men
of the most moderate tempers, and the most attached to the
church and monarchy, exerted themselves with the utmost
vigour in the redress of grievances, and in prosecuting the
authors of them. The lively and animated Digby dis∣played
his eloquence on this occasion, the firm and un∣daunted
Capel, the modest and candid Palmer. In this list
too of patriot-royalists are found the virtuous names of
Hyde and Falkland. Tho' in their ultimate views and in∣tentions,
these men differed widely from the former; in
<PB N="314" REF="362"/>
their present actions and discourses, an intire concurrence
and unanimity was observed.</P>
<P>BY the daily harangues and invectives against illegal
usurpations, not only the house of commons inflamed them∣selves
with the highest animosity towards the court: The
nation caught new fire from the popular leaders, and seemed
now to have made the first discovery of the many disorders
of the government. While the law, in many instances,
seemed to be violated, they went no farther than some se∣cret
and calm murmurs; but mounted up into rage and
fury, as soon as the constitution was thought to be restored
to its former integrity and vigour. The capital especially,
being, the seat of parliament, was highly animated with the
spirit of mutiny and disaffection. Tumults were daily
raised; seditious assemblies encouraged; and every man,
neglecting his own business, was wholly intent on the de¦fence
of liberty and religion. By stronger contagion, the
popular affections were communicated from breast to breast,
in this place of general rendezvous and society.</P>
<P>THE harangues of members, now first published and
dispersed, kept alive the discontents against the King's ad∣ministration.
The pulpits, delivered over to puritanical
preachers and lecturers, whom the commons arbitrarily
settled in all the considerable churches, resounded with fac∣tion
and fanaticism. Vengeance was fully taken for that
long silence and constraint, in which, by the authority of
Laud and the high commission, these preachers had been
retained. The press, freed from all fear or reserve, swarmed
with productions, dangerous by their seditious zeal and ca∣lumny
more than by any art or eloquence of composition.
Noise and fury, cant and hypocrisy, formed the sole rhe∣toric,
which, during this tumult of various prejudices and
passions, could be heard or attended to.</P>
<P>THE severe sentence, which had been executed against
Prynne, Bastwic, and Burton, now suffered a revisal from
<PB N="315" REF="363"/>
parliament. These libellers, far from being tamed by the
rigorous punishments which they had undergone, showed
still a disposition of repeating the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offence; and the mini∣sters
were afraid, lest new satires should issue from their
prisons, and inflame still farther the prevailing discontents.
By an order, therefore, of the council, they had been re∣moved
to remote prisons; Bastwic to Scilly, Prynne to
Jersey, Burton to Guernsey; all access to them was denied;
and the use of books, and of pen, ink, and paper, was
refused them. The sentence for these additional punish∣ments
was immediately reversed by the commons: Even the
first sentence, upon examination, was declared illegal; and
the judges, who passed it, were ordered to make reparation
to the sufferers<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. i. p. 783. May, p. 79.</NOTE>. When the prisoners landed in England,
they were received and entertained with the highest demon∣strations
of affection, were attended with a mighty conflu∣ence
of company, their charges were borne with great mag∣nificence,
and liberal presents bestowed on them. On their
approach to any town, all the inhabitants crowded to re∣ceive
them, and welcomed their reception with shouts and
acclamations. Their train still increased, as they drew near
to London. Several miles from the city, the zealots of
their party met them in great multitudes, and attended
their triumphant entrance: Boughs were carried in this
tumultuous procession; the roads were strewed with
flowers; and amidst the highest exultations of joy, were
intermingled loud and virulent invectives against the pre∣lates,
who had so cruelly persecued such godly personages<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 199, 200, &amp;c. Nalson, vol. i. p. 570. May, p. 80.</NOTE>.
The more ignoble these men were, the more sensible was
the insult upon royal authority, and the more dangerous
was the spirit of disaffection and mutiny which it discovered
among the people.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="364"/>
LILBURNE, Leighton, and every one who had been pu∣nished
for seditious libels during the precedent administration,
now recovered their liberty, and were decreed damages on
the judges and ministers of justice<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 228. Nalson, vol. i. p. 800.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOT only the present disposition of the nation ensured
impunity to all libellers: A new method of framing and
dispersing libels was invented by the leaders of popular dis∣content.
Petitions to parliament were drawn, craving re∣dress
against particular grievances; and when a sufficient
number of subscriptions were procured, the potitions were
presented to the commons, and immediately published.
These petitions became secret bonds of association among
the subscribers, and seemed to give undoubted sanction and
authority to the complaints which they contained.</P>
<P>'TIS pretended by historians favourable to the royal
cause<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dugdale. Cla∣rendon, vol. i. p. 203.</NOTE>, and even asserted by the King himself in a declara∣tion
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Husb. Coll. p. 536.</NOTE>, that a most disingenuous or rather criminal practice
prevailed, in conducting many of these addresses. A peti∣tion
was first framed; moderate, reasonable, such as men
of character willingly subscribed. The names were after∣wards
torn off, and affixed to another petition, which served
better the purposes of the popular faction. We may judge
of the wild fury which prevailed throughout the nation,
when so scandalous an imposture, which affected such num∣bers
of people, could be openly practised, without draw∣ing
infamy and ruin upon the managers.</P>
<P>So many grievances were offered, both by the members,
and by petitions without-doors, that the house was divided
into above forty committees, charged, each of them, with
the examination of some particular violation of law and
liberty which had been complained of. Besides the general
committees of religion, trade, privileges, laws; many sub∣divisions
of these were framed, and a strict scrutiny was
<PB N="317" REF="365"/>
every-where carried on. 'Tis to be remarked, that, before
the beginning of this century, when the parliament assumed
less influence and authority, complaints of grievances were
usually presented to the house, by any members who had had
particular opportunity of observing them. These ge∣neral
committees, which were a kind of inquisitorial courts,
had not then been established; and we find, that the King,
in a former declaration<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Published on dissolving the third parliament. See Parl, Hist. vol. viii. p. 347.</NOTE>, complains loudly of this innova∣tion,
so little favourable to royal authority. But never was
so much multiplied, as at present, the use of these com∣mittees;
and the commons, tho' they themselves were the
greatest innovators, employed the usual artifice of complain∣ing
against innovations, and pretending to recover the an∣tient
and established government.</P>
<P>FROM the reports of their committees, the house daily
passed votes, which mortified and astonished the court, and
inflamed and animated the nation. Ship-money was de∣clared
illegal and arbitrary; the sentence against Hambden
cancelled; the court of York abolished; compositions of
knighthood stigmatized; the enlargement of the forests con∣demned;
patents for monopolies annulled; and every late
measure of the administration treated with reproach and
obloquy. To-day, a sentence of the star-chamber was ex∣claimed
against: To-morrow, a decree of the high-com∣mission.
Every discretionary act of council was represented
as arbitrary and tyrannical: And the general inference was
still inculcated, that a formed design had been laid to sub∣vert
the laws and constitution of the kingdom.</P>
<P>FROM necessity, the King remained intirely passive during
all these violent operations. The few servants, who con∣tinued
faithful to him, were seized with astonishment at the
rapid progress made by the commons in power and popu∣larity,
and were glad, by their inactive and inoffensive be∣haviour,
<PB N="318" REF="366"/>
to compound for impunity. The torrent rising
to so dreadful and unexpected a height, despair seized all
those, who, from interest or habit, were most attached to
monarchy. And as for those, who maintained their duty to
the King, merely from their regard to the constitution,
they seemed, by their concurrence, to swell that inundation
which began already to deluge every thing. “You have
taken the whole machine of government in pieces,” said
Charles in a discourse to the parliament; “a practice fre∣quent
with skilful artists, when they desire to clear the
wheels from any rust which may have grown upon them.
The engine,” continued he, “may again be restored to
its former use and motions, provided it be put up intire;
so as not a pin of it be wanting.” But this was far
from the intention of the commons. The machine, they
thought with fome reason, was encumbered with many
wheels and springs, which retarded and crossed its opera∣tions,
and destroyed its utility. Happy! had they pro∣ceeded
with moderation, and been contented, in their pre∣sent
plenitude of power, to remove such parts only as might
justly be deemed superfluous and incongruous.</P>
<P>IN order to maintain that high authority which they had
acquired, the commons, besides confounding and over∣awing
their opponents, judged it requisite to inspire cou∣rage
into their friends and adherents; particularly into the
Scots, and the religious puritans, to whose assistance and
good offices they were already so much beholden.</P>
<P>No sooner were die Scots masters of the northern counties,
than they laid aside their first professions, which they had
not indeed means to support, of paying for every thing;
and in order to prevent the destructive expedient of plunder
and free quarters, the country consented to give them a re∣gular
contribution of 850 pounds a day, in full of their
subsistence<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. iii. p. 1295.</NOTE>. The parliament, that they might relieve the
<PB N="319" REF="367"/>
northern counties from so grievous an oppression, agreed to
remit pay to the Scots, as well as to the English army; and
because subsidies would be levied too slowly for so urgent an
occasion, money was borrowed from the citizens upon the
security of particular members. Two subsidies, a very
small sum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears, that a subsidy was now fallen to 50,000 pounds.</NOTE>, were at first voted; and as the intention of
this supply was to indemnify the members, who, by their
private, had supported public credit, this pretence was im∣mediately
laid hold of, and the money was ordered to be
paid, not into the treasury, but into commissioners appointed
by parliament: A practice, which, as it diminished the au∣thority
of the crown, was very willingly embraced, and was
afterwards continued by the commons, with regard to every
branch of revenue which they granted the King. The in∣vasion
of the Scots had evidently been the cause of assem∣bling
the parliament: The presence of their army reduced
the King to that total subjection in which he was now held:
The commons, for this reason, very openly prosessed their
intention of retaining these invaders till all their enemies
should be suppressed, and all their purposes effected. <HI>We
cannot yet spare the Scots,</HI> said Strode plainly in the house;
<HI>the sons of Zeruiah are still too strong for us</HI><NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Dug∣dale, p. 71.</NOTE>: An allusion
to a passage of scripture, according to the mode of that age.
Eighty thousand pounds a month Were requisite for the sub∣sistence
of the two armies; a sum much greater than the
kingdom had ever been accustomed, in any former period,
to pay to the public. And tho' several subsidies, together
with a poll-tax, were from time to time voted to answer the
charge; the commons took care still to be in debt, in order
to render the continuance of the session the more neces∣sary.</P>
<P>THE Scots being such useful allies to the malecontent
party in England, no wonder they were courted with the
<PB N="320" REF="368"/>
most unlimited complaisance and the most important services.
The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, in his first speech, having called them <HI>rebels,</HI>
observed, that he had given great offence to the parliament;
and he was immediately obliged to soften, and even retract
that expression. The Scots commissioners, of whom the
most considerable were the Earl of Rothes and Lord Loudon,
found every advantage in conducting their treaty; and yet
made no haste in bringing it to an issue. They were lodged
in the city, and kept an intimate correspondence, as well
with the magistrates, who were extremely disaffected, as
with the popular leaders in both houses, St. Antholine's
church was assigned them for their devotions; and their
chaplains, here, began openly to practise the presbyterian
form of worship, which, except in foreign languages, had
never hitherto been allowed any indulgence or toleration.
So violent was the general propensity towards this new reli∣gion,
that multitudes of all ranks crowded into the church.
Those, who were so happy as to find access early in the
morning, kept their places the whole day: Those, who
were excluded, clung to the doors or windows in hopes of
catching, at least, some distant murmurs or broken phrases
of the holy rhetoric<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 189.</NOTE>. All the eloquence of parliament,
now well refined from pedantry, animated, with the spirit of
liberty, and employed in such important interests, was not
attended to with such insatiable avidity, as were these lec∣tures,
delivered with ridiculous cant, and a provincial ac∣cent,
full of barbarism and of ignorance.</P>
<P>THE most effectual expedient for paying court to the
zealous Scots was to promote the presbyterian discipline and
worship throughout England; and to this innovation, the
popular leaders among the commons, as well as their most
devoted partizans, were, of themselves, sufficiently inclined.
The puritanical party, whose progress, though secret, had
hitherto been gradual in the kingdom, taking advantage of
<PB N="321" REF="369"/>
the present disorders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bishops attacked.</NOTE> began openly to prosess their tenets,
and to make surious attacks on the established religion. The
prevalence of that sect in the parliament discovered itself,
from the beginning, by infensible, but decisive symptoms.
Marshall and Burgess, two puritanical clergymen, were
chosen to preach before them, and entertained them with
discourses seven hours in length<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. i. p. 530, 533.</NOTE>. It being the custom of
the house always to take the sacrament before they entered
upon business, they ordered, as a necessary preliminary,
that the communion table should be removed from the east
end of St. Margaret's into the middle of the area<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 537.</NOTE>. The
name of the <HI>spiritual lords</HI> was commonly left out in acts
of parliament; and the laws ran in name of the king,
lords, and commons. The clerk of the upper house, in
reading bills, turned his back on the bench of bishops;
nor was his insolence ever taken notice of. On a day ap∣pointed
for a solemn fast and humiliation, all the orders of
temporal peers, contrary to former practice, in going to
church, took place of the spiritual; and the Lord Spencer
remarked, that the humiliation, that day, seemed confined
alone to the prelates.</P>
<P>EVERY meeting of the commons produced some Vehe∣ment
harangue against the usurpations of the bishops, against
the high-commission, against the late convocation, against
the new canons. So disgusted were all lovers of civil liberty
at the doctrines promoted by the clergy, that these invectives
were received without controul; and no distinction, at first,
appeared between such as desired only to repress the exor∣bitances
of the hierarchy, and such as pretended totally to
annihilate episcopal jurisdiction. Encouraged by these fa∣vourable
appearances, petitions against the church were
framed in different parts of the kingdom. The epithet of
the ignorant and vicious priesthood was commonly applied
<PB N="322" REF="370"/>
to all churchmen, addicted to the established discipline and
worship; though the episcopal clergy in England, during
that age, seem to have been, as they are at present, suffi∣ciently
learned and exemplary. An address against episco∣pacy
was presented by twelve clergymen to the committee of
religion, and pretended to be signed by many hundreds of
the puritanical persuasion. But what made most noise was
the city petition for a total alteration of church govern∣ment;
a petition, to which 15,000 subscriptions were an∣nexed,
and which was presented by Alderman Pennington,
the city-member<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 203. Whitlocke, p. 37. Nalson, vol. i. p. 666.</NOTE>. 'Tis remarkable, that, among the
many ecclesiastical abuses there complained of, an allowance
given by the licencers of books, to publish a translation
of Ovid's Art of Love, is not forgot by these rustic cen∣sors<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the favourable disposition of the
people, the leaders in the house resolved to proceed with
caution. They introduced a bill for prohibiting all clergy∣men
the exercise of any civil office. As a consequence, the
bishops were to be deprived of their seats in the house of
peers; a measure not unacceptable to the zealous friends of
liberty, who observed, with regret, the devoted attachment
of that order to the will of the monarch. But when this
bill was presented to the peers, it was rejected by a; great
majority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 237.</NOTE>. The first check which the commons had re∣ceived
in their popular career, and a prognostic of what
they might afterwards expect from the upper house, whose
inclinations and interest could never be totally separated from
the throne. But to show how little they were discouraged,
the puritans immediately brought in another bill for the total
abolition of episcopacy; tho' they thought proper to let
that bill sleep at present, in expectation of a more favour∣able
opportunity for reviving it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 237.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="371"/>
AMONG other acts of regal, executive power, which the
commons were every day assuming; they issued orders for
the demolishing all images, altars crucifixes. The zealous
Sir Robert Harley, to whom the execution of these orders
was committed, removed all crosses even out streets and
markets; and from his abhorrence to that superstitious
figure; would riot any-where allow two pieces of wood or
stone to lie over each other at right angles<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE bishop of Ely and other clergymen were attacked
on account of innovations<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 351.</NOTE>. Cozens, who had long been
obnoxious, was exposed to new censures. This person,
who Was dean of Peterborough, was extremely zealous for
ecclesiastical ceremonies: And so far from permitting the
communicants to break the sacramental bread with their
fingers; a privilege on which the puritans very strenuously
insisted; he would not so much as allow it to be cut with
an ordinary houshold instrument. A consecrated knife
must perform that sacred office, and must never afterwards
be profaned by any vulgar service<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ib. p. 203.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COZENS likewise was accused of having said, <HI>The King
has no more authority in ecclesiastical matters, than the boy
who rubs my horse's heels</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Parl. Hist. v 1. vii. p. 282. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 209.</NOTE>. The expression was violent:
But 'tis certain, that all those high churchmen, who were
so industrious in reducing the laity to submission, were ex∣tremely
fond of, their own privileges and independency, and
were desirous of exempting the, mitre from all subjection to
the crown.</P>
<P>A COMMITTEE was erected by the commons as a court
of inquisition upon the clergy, and was commonly denomi∣nated
the committee of <HI>scandalous ministers.</HI> The politi∣cians
among the commons were apprized of the great im∣portance
of the pulpit for guiding the people; the bigots
<PB N="324" REF="372"/>
were enraged against the prelatical cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgy; and both of
than knew, that no established government could be over∣thrown
by observing strictly the principles of justice; equity,
or clemency. The proceedings, therefore, of this famous
committee, which continued for several years, were, to the
last degree, cruel and arbitrary, and made dreadful havock
both on the church and the universities. They began with
harassing, imprisoning, and molesting the clergy; and ended
with sequestring and ejecting them. In order to join con∣tumely
to cruelty, they gave the sufferers the epithet of
<HI>scandalous,</HI> and endeavoured to render them as odious as
they were miserable<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 199. Whitlocke, p. 122. May, p. 81.</NOTE>. The utmost vices, however, which
they could reproach to a great part of them, were, bowing
at the name of Jesus, placing the communion-table in the
east, reading the King's orders for forts on Sunday, and
other practices, which the established government, both in
church and state, had strictly enjoined them.</P>
<P>IT may be worth observing, that all the historians, who
lived near that age, or what perhaps is more decisive, all
authors, who have casually made mention of those public
transactions, still represent the civil disorders and convulsions
as proceeding from religious controversy, and consider the
political disputes about power and liberty as intirely subor∣dinate
to the other. 'Tis true, had the King been able to
abstain from all invasion of national privileges, it is not pro∣bable
that the puritans ever could have acquired such au∣thority
as to overturn the whole constitution: Yet so intire
was the subjection into which Charles was now fallen, that,
if the wound had not been poisoned by the infusion of
theological hatred, it must have admitted of a very easy
remedy. Disuse of parliaments, imprisonment and prosecu∣tion
of members, ship-money, an arbitrary and illegal ad∣ministration;
these were loudly complained of: But the
<PB N="325" REF="373"/>
grievances, which tended chiefly to inflame the parliament
and nation, especially the latter, were, the surplice, the
rails placed about the altar, the bows exacted on approach∣ing
it, the liturgy, the breach of the sabbath, embroidered
copes, lawn sleeves, the use of the ring in marriage, and
of the cross in baptism. On account of these, were both
parties contented to throw the government into such violent
convulsions; and to the disgrace of that age and of this
island, it must be acknowleged, that the disorders in Scot∣land
intirely, and those in England mostly, proceeded from
so mean and contemptible an origin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Clarendon, vol. i. p. 233. says, that the parliamentary party were not agreed about the intire abolition of episcopacy: They were only the <HI>root and branch men,</HI> as they were called, who insisted on that measure. But those who were willing to retain bishops, insisted on reducing their authority to a low cbb; as well as on abolishing the ceremonies of worship and vest∣ments of the clergy. The controversy, therefore, between the parties was almost wholly theological, and that of the most frivolous and ridiculous kind.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME persons, partial to the leaders who now defended
public liberty, have ventured to put them in balance with
the most illustrious, characters of antiquity; and mention
the names of Pym, Hambden, Vane, as a just parallel to
those of Cato, Brutus, Cassius. Profound capacity, indeed,
undaunted courage, extensive enterprize; in these particu∣lars,
perhaps the Roman do not much surpass the English
patriots: But what a difference, when the discourse, con∣duct,
conversation, and private as well as public behaviour,
of both are inspected! Compare only one circumstance,
and consider its consequences. The leisure of those noble
antients was totally employed in the study of Grecian elo∣quence
and philosophy; in the cultivation of polite letters
and civilized society: The whole discourse and language of
the moderns were polluted with mysterious jargon, and full
of the lowest and most vulgar hypocrisy.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="374"/>
THE laws, they stood at present, protected the church;
but they exposed the catholics to the utmost rage of the
puritans; and these unhappy religionists, so obnoxious to
the prevailing sect could not hope to remain long unmo∣lested.
The Voluntary contribution, which they had made,
in order to assist the King in his war against the Scots co∣venanters,
was inquired into, and represented as the greatest
enormity<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 160.</NOTE>. By an address from the commons, all officers
of that religion were removed from the army, and applica∣tion
was made to the King for seizing two thirds of recu∣sants
lands; a proportion to which, by law, he was intitled,
but which he had always allowed them to possess upon very
easy compositions. The severe and bloody laws against
priests were insisted on: And one Goodman, a jesuit who
was found in prison, was condemned to a capital punish∣ment.
Charles, however, agreeable to his usual principles,
scrupled to sign the warrant for his execution; and the com∣mons
expressed great resentment on that occasion<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 158, 159. Nalson, vol. i. p. 739.</NOTE>. There
remains a very singular petition of Goodman, begging to be
hanged, rather than prove a source of contention between
the King and his people<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 166. Nalson, vol. i. p. 749.</NOTE>. He escaped with his life; but
it seems more probable that he was overlooked, amidst af∣fairs
of greater consequence, than that such unrelenting
hatred would be softened by any consideration of his courage
and generosity.</P>
<P>FOR some years, Con, a Scotsman; afterwards, Rosetti,
an Italian, had openly resided at London, and frequented
the court, as vested with a commission from the Pope. The
Queen's zeal, and her authority with her husband, had been
the cause of this imprudence, so offensive to the nation.
But the spirit of bigotry now rose too high to permit any
longer such indulgences<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="375"/>
HAYWARD, a justice of peace, having been wounded,
when employed in the. exercise of his office, by one, James,
a catholic madman, this enormity was ascribed to the po∣pery,
not to the frenzy of the assassin: and great alarms
seized the nation and parliament<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 249. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 57.</NOTE>. An universal conspiracy
of the papists was supposed to have taken place; and every
man, for some days, imagined that he had a sword at his
throat. Tho' some, persons of family and distinction were
still attached to the catholic superstition; 'tis certain that
the numbers of that sect did not compose the fortieth part
of the nation: And the frequent panics, to which men,
during this period, were so subject, on account of the ca∣tholics,
were less the effects of fear, than of extreme rage
and aversion entertained against them.</P>
<P>THE Queen Mother of France, having been forced into
banishment by some court-intrigues, had retired into Eng∣land;
and expecting shelter, amidst her present distresses, in
the dominions of her daughter and son-in-law. But, tho'
she behaved in the most inoffensive manner, she was in∣sulted
by the populace on account of her religion; and was
even threatened with worse treatment. The Earl of Hol∣land,
Lord lieutenant of Middlesex, had ordered a hundred
musqueteers to guard her; but finding that they had im∣bibed
the same prejudices with the rest of their country∣men,
and were very unwillingly employed in such a service,
he laid the case before the house of peers: For the King's
authority was now intirely annihilated. He represented the
indignity of the action, that so great a Princess, mother
to the King of France, and to the Queens of Spain and
England, should be affronted by the base multitude. He
observed the indelible reproach which would fall upon the
nation, if that unfortunate Queen should suffer any violence
from the misguided zeal of the people. He urged the sacred
rights of hospitality, due to every one, much more to a
<PB N="328" REF="376"/>
person in distress, of so high a rank, with whom the na∣tion
was so nearly connected. The peers thought proper
to communicate the matter to the commons, whose autho∣rity
over the people was absolute. The commons agreed
to the necessity of protecting the Queen Mother; but at
the same time desired, that she might be desired to depart
the kingdom; “For the quieting those jealousies in the
hearts of his Majesty's well-affected subjects, occasioned
by some ill instruments about that Queen's person, by
the flowing of priests and papists to her house, and by
the use and practice of the idolatry of the mass, and
exercise of other superstitious services of the Romish
church, to the great scandal of true religion<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 267.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>CHARLES, in the former part of his reign, had endea∣voured
to overcome the intractable and incroaching spirit
of the commons, by a perseverance in his own measures, by
a stately dignity of behaviour, and by maintaining, at their
utmost height, and even stretching beyond former precedent,
the rights of his prerogative. Finding by experience how
unsuccessful those measures had proved, and observing the
low condition to which he was now reduced, he resolved to
alter his whole conduct, and to regain the confidence of his
people, by pliableness, by concessions, and by a total con∣formity
to their inclinations and prejudices. He did not
consider, that the true rule of government, in so difficult
a situation, as that, in which, from the beginning of his
reign, he was placed, consisted neither in steddiness nor fa∣cility,
but in such a judicious mixture of both, as would
exactly suit the present circumstances of the nation, and the
particular pretensions of his opponents. And it may safely
be averred, that this new extreme, into which'the King,
for want of proper counsel or support, was fallen, became
equally dangerous to the constitution, and pernicious to
<PB N="329" REF="377"/>
public peace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tonnage and poundage.</NOTE> as the other in which he had so long and so
unfortunattely perserved.</P>
<P>THE pretensions with regard to tonnage and poundage
were revived, and with certain assurance of success, by the
commons<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">It appears not, that the commons, tho' now intirely masters, abolished the new impositions of James, against which they had formerly so loudly complained: A certain proof that the rates of customs, settled by that Prince, were in most instances just, and proportioned to the new price of commodities. They seem rather to have, been low: For they raised only die customs a third; whereas prices had certainly augmented five or six times. See journ. 10 Aug. 1625.</NOTE>. The levying these duties, as formerly, with∣out
consent of parliament, and even increasing them at plea∣sure,
was such an incongruity in a free constitution, where
the people, by their fundamental privileges, cannot be
taxed but by their own consent, as could no longer be en∣dured
by these jealous patrons of liberty. In the preamble,
therefore, to the bill by which the commons granted these
duties to the King, they took care, in the strongest and
most positive terms, to assert their own right of bestowing
this gift, and to divest the crown of all independent title of
assuming it. And that they might increase, or rather, finally
fix, the intire dependence and subjection of the King, they
voted these duties only for two months; and afterwards
from time to time, renewed their grant for very short pe∣riods<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It Was an instruction given by the house to the committee which framed one of these bills, to take care that the rates upon the home-commodities may be as light as possible; and upon fo∣reign commodities as heavy as trade will bear: A proof, that the nature of commerce began now to be understood.

Charles, in order to show that he entertained no
intention ever again to separate himself from his parlia∣ment,
passed this important bill, without any scruple or
hesitation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Cla∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndon, vol. i. p. 208.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH regard to the bill for triennial parliaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triennial bill.</NOTE>
he made a little difficulty. By an old statute, passed during
the reign of Edward III. it had been enacted, that parlia∣ments
should be held once every year, or more frequently,
<PB N="330" REF="378"/>
if necessary: But as no provision had been made in cafe
of failure, and no precise method pointed out for execu∣tion;
this statute had been considered merely as a general
declaration, and was dispensed with at pleasure. The defect
was supplied by those vigilant patriots, who now assumed
the reins of government. It was enacted, that if the chan∣cellor,
who was first bound under severe penalties, failed
to issue writs by the third of September in every third year,
any twelve or more of the peers should be impowered to
exert this authority: In default of the peers, the-sheriffs,
mayors, bailiffs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> should summon the voters: And in
their default, the voters themselves should meet and proceed
to the election of members, in the same manner as if writs
had been regularly issued from the crown. Nor could the
parliament, after it was assembled, be adjourned, prorogued,
or dissolved, without their own consent, during the space of
fifty days. By this bill, some of the noblest and most va∣luable
prerogatives of the crown were retrenched; but at
the same time, nothing could be more necessary than such
a statute, for completing a regular plan of law and liberty.
A great reluctance to assemble parliaments must be expected
in the King; where these assemblies, as of late, establish
it as a maxim to carry their scrutiny into every part of go∣vernment.
During long intermissions of parliament, griev∣ances
and abuses, as was found by recent experience, would
naturally creep in; and it would even become necessary for
the King and council to exert a great discretionary autho∣rity,
and, by acts of state, to supply, in every emergence,
the legislative power, whose meeting was so uncertain and
precarious. Charles, finding that nothing less would satisfy
his parliament and people, at last gave his assent to this
bill, which produced so great an innovation in the constitu∣tion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 209. Whitlecke, p. 39. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 189.</NOTE>. Solemn thanks were presented him by both houses.
Great rejoicings were expressed both in the city and through∣out
<PB N="331" REF="379"/>
the nation. And mighty professions were every-where
made of gratitude and mutual returns of supply and con∣fidence.
This concession of the King, it must be owned,
was not intirely voluntary: It was of a nature too import∣ant
to be voluntary. The sole inference, which his parti∣zans
were intitled to draw from the submissions so frankly
made to present necessity, was, that he had certainly adopted
a new plan of government, and, for the future, was re∣solved,
by every indulgence, to acquire the confidence and
affections of his people.</P>
<P>CHARLES thought, that what concessions were made to
the public were of little consequence, if no gratifications
were bestowed on the individuals, who had acquired the
direction of public counsels and determinations. A change
of ministers, as well as of measures, was therefore resolved
on. In one day several new privy-counsellors were sworn;
the Earls of Hertford, Bedford, Essex, Bristol; the Lords
Say, Saville, Kimbolton: Within a few days after, was
admitted the Earl of Warwick<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 195.</NOTE>. All these noblemen were
of the popular party; and some of them afterwards, when
matters were pushed to extremity by the commons, proved
the greatest support of monarchy.</P>
<P>JUXON, bishop of London, who had never desired the
treasurer's staff, now earnestly solicited for leave
to resign it, and retire to the care of that turbulent diocese which
was committed to him. The King gave his assent; and it
is remarkable, that, during all the severe inquiries carried
on against the conduct of ministers and prelates, the mild
and prudent virtues of this man, who bore both these in∣vidious
characters, remained unmolested<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 95.</NOTE>. It was intended,
that Bedford, a popular man, of great authority, as well
as wisdom and moderation, should succeed Juxon: But
that nobleman, very unfortunately both for King and people,
<PB N="332" REF="380"/>
died about this very time.. By some promotions, place was
made for St. John, who was created folicitor-general. Hollis
was to be made secretary of state, in place of Windebank,
who had fled: Pym, chancellor of the exchequer, in
place of Lord Cottington, who had resigned: Lord Say,
master of the wards, in place of the same nobleman: The
Earl of Essex, governor; and Hambden, tutor to the
Prince.</P>
<P>WHAT retarded the execution of these projected changes,
was the difficulty of satisfying all those, who, from their
activity and authority in parliament, had pretensions for
offices, and who had it still in their power to embarrass and
distress the public measures. Their associates too in popu∣larity,
whom the King intended to distinguish by his favours,
were unwilling to undergo the reproach of having driven a
separate bargain, and of sacrificing, to their own ambitious
views, the cause of the nation. And as they were sensible
that they must owe their preferment intirely to their weight
and consideration in parliament, they were most of them re∣solved
still to adhere to that assembly, and both to promote
its authority, and to preserve their own credit in it. On all
occasions, they had no other advice to give the King, than
to allow himself to be directed by his great council; or, in
other words, to resign himself passively to their guidance
and government. And Charles found, that, instead of ac∣quiring
friends by the honours and offices which he should
bestow, he should only arm his enemies with more power to
hurt him.</P>
<P>THE end, on which the King was most intent in change∣ing
ministers, was, to save the life of the Earl of Strassord,
and to mollify, by these indulgences, the rage of his most
furious prosecutors. But so high was that nobleman's re∣putation
for experience and capacity, that all the new coun∣sellors
and intended ministers plainly saw that if he escaped
<NOTE PLACE="foot">w Clarendon, vol. i. p. 210, 211.</NOTE>
<PB N="333" REF="381"/>
their vengeance, he must return into favour and authority;
and they regarded his death as the only security which they
could have, both for the establishment of their present
power, and for success in their farther enterprizes. His
impeachment, therefore, was pushed on with the utmost
vigour;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strafford's trial.</NOTE> and, after long and solemn preparations, was brought
to a final issue.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after Strafford was sequestred from par∣liament,
and consined in the Tower, a committee of thir∣teen
were chosen by the lower house, and entrusted with
the office of preparing a charge aginst him. These, joined
to a small committee of lords, were vested with authority
to examine all witnesses, to call for every paper, and to use
any means of scrutiny, with regard to any part of the Earl's
behaviour and conduct<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 192.</NOTE>. After so general and unbounded
an inquisition, exercised by such powerful and implacable
enemies; a man must have been very cautions or very inno∣cent,
not to afford, during the whole course of his life,
some matter of accusation against him.</P>
<P>THIS committee, by direction from both houses, took an
oath of secrecy; a practice very unusual, and which gave
them the appearance of conspirators, more than ministers of
justice<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 37.</NOTE>. But the intention of this strictness, was to render
it more difficult for the Earl to elude their search, or pre∣pare
for his justification.</P>
<P>APPLICATION was made to the King, that he would
allow this committee to examine privy-counsellors with re∣gard
to opinions delivered at the board. A concession which
charles unawrily made, and which thenceforth banished all
mutual confidence from the deliberations of council; where
every man is supposed to have intire freedom, without fear of
future punishment and inquiry, of proposing any expedient,
questioning any opinion, or supporting any argument<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Cla∣rendon, vol. i. p. 193.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="382"/>
SIR George Rat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liffe, the Earl's intimate friend and
confident, was accused of high treason, sent for from Ire∣land,
and committed to close custody. As no charge
ever appeared or was prosecuted against him, it is im∣possible
to give a more charitable interpretation to this
measure, than that the commons thereby intended to de∣prive
Strafford, in his present distress, of the assistance of
his best friend, who was most enabled, by his testimony,
to justify the innocence of his patron's conduct and beha∣viour<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 214.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence arrived in Ireland of the plans laid for
Strafford's ruin, the Irish house of commons, tho' they had
very lately bestowed most ample praises on his administration,
entered into all the violent counsels against him, and prepared
a representation of the miserable state, into which, by his
misconduct, they supposed the kingdom to be fallen. They
sent over a committee into England, to assist in the prosecution
of their unfortunate governor; and by intimations from this
committee, who entered into close confederacy with the po∣pular
leaders in England, was every measure of the Irish
parliament governed and directed. Impeachments, which
were never prosecuted, were carried up against Sir Richard
Bolton the chancellor, Sir Gerard Louther chief justice,
and Bramhall bishop of Derry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 214.</NOTE>. This step, which was an
exact counterpart to the proceedings in England, served also
the same purposes: It deprived the King of the ministers
whom he most trusted; it discouraged and terrified all the
other ministers; and it prevented those persons, who were
best acquainted with Strafford's counsels, from giving evi∣dence
in his favour before the English parliament.</P>
<P>THE bishops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1641.</NOTE> being forbid by the antient canons to assist
in any trial for life, and being unwilling, by any opposition,
to irritate the commons, who were already much prejudiced
<PB N="335" REF="383"/>
against them, thought proper, of themselves, to Withdraw<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 216.</NOTE>.
The commons also voted, that the new-created peers ought
to have no voice in this trial; because the accusation being
agreed to, while they were commoners, their consent to it
was implied with that of all the commons of England.
Notwithstanding this decision, which was meant only to de∣prive
Strafford of so many friends, the Lord Seymour, and
some others, still continued to keep their seat; nor was their
right to it any farther questioned<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE></P>
<P>To bestow a greater solemnity on this important trial,
scaffolds were erected in Wesminster-hall; where both
houses sat, the one as accusers, the other as judges. Be∣sides
the chair of state, a close gallery was prepared for the
King and Queen, who attended during the whole trial<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 40. Rush, vol. iv. p. 41. May, 90.</NOTE></P>
<P>AN accusation, carried on by the united effort of three
kingdoms, against one man, unproteced by power, unas∣sisted
y council, discountenanced by authority, was likely
to prove a very unequal contest: Yet such was the capacity,
genius, presence of mind, displayed, by this magnanimous
statesman, that, while argument and reason and law had any
place, he obtained an undisputed victory. And, he perished
at last, overwhelmed and still unsubdued, by the open vio∣lence
of his fierce and unrelenting antagonists.</P>
<P>THE articles of impeachment against Strafford are twenty∣eight
in number; and regard his conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 22</NOTE> as president of
the council of York, as deputy or lieutenant Ireland, as
counsellor or commander in England. But tho' four months
were employed by the managers in framing the accusation,
and all Strafford's answers were extemporary; it appears
from comparison, not only that he was free from the crime
of treason, of which there is not the least appearance, but
that his conduct, making allowance for human infirmities,
<PB N="336" REF="384"/>
exposed to such severe scrutiny, was innocent, and even
laudable.</P>
<P>THE powers of the northern council, while he was pre∣sident,
had been extended, by the King's instructions, be∣yond
what formerly had been practised: But that court be∣ing,
at first, instituted by a stretch of royal prerogative, it
had been usual for the prince to vary his instructions; and
the largest authority, committed to it, was altogether as,
legal as the most moderate and most limited. Nor was it
reasonable to conclude, that Strafford had used any art to
procure those extensive powers; since he never once sat as
president, nor exercised one act of jurisdiction, after he
was invested with the authority so much complained of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. iv. p. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the government of Ireland, his administration had
been equally promotive of his master's interest, and that of
the subjects committed to his care. A large debt he had
paid off: He had left a considerable sum in the exchequer:
The revenues, which before never answered the charges of
government, were now raised to be equal to them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 120, 247. War∣wick, p. 115.</NOTE>. A
small standing army, formerly kept in no order, was aug∣mented,
and was governed by the most exact discipline:
And a great force was there raised and paid, for the support
of the King's authority against the Scots covenanters.</P>
<P>INDUSTRY, and all the arts of peace, were intro∣duced
among that savage people: The shipping of the
kingdom augmented a hundred fold<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 45.</NOTE>: The customs tri∣pled
upon the same rates<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. iv. p. 124.</NOTE>: The exports double in value
to the imports: Manufactures, particularly that of linen,
introduced and promoted<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 115.</NOTE>. Agriculture, by means of the
English and Scots plantations, gradually advancing: The
<PB N="337" REF="385"/>
protestant religion encouraged, without the persecution
or discontent of the catholics.</P>
<P>THE springs of authority he had enforced without over∣straining
them. Discretionary acts of jurisdiction, indeed,
he had often exerted, by holding courts-martial, billetting
soldiers, deciding causes upon paper-petitions before the
council, issuing proclamations; and punishing their infrac∣tion.
But discretionary authority, during that age, was
usually exercised even in England. In Ireland, it was still
more requisite, among a wild people, not yet thoroughly
subdued, averse to the religion and manners of their con∣querors,
ready on all occasions to relapse into rebellion and
disorder. While the managers of the commons demanded,
every moment, that the deputy's conduct should be exa∣mined
by the line of rigid law and severe principles; he
appealed still to the practice of all former deputies, and to
the uncontroulable necessity of his situation.</P>
<P>So great was his art of managing elections, and balancing
parties, that he had engaged the Irish parliament to vote
whatever was necessary, both for the payment of former
debts, and for support of the new-levied army; nor had he
ever been reduced to the illegal expedients practised in Eng∣land,
for the supply of public necessities. No imputation
of rapacity could justly lie against his administration. Some
instances of imperious expressions and even actions may be
met with. The case of Lord Mountnorris, of all those
collected with so much industry, is the most slagrant and
the least excusable.</P>
<P>IT had been reported at the table of the Lord chancel∣lor
Loftus, that one of the deputy's attendants, a relation
of Mountnorris, in moving a stool, had sorely hurt his
master's foot, who was at that time afflicted with the gout.
<HI>Perhaps,</HI> said Mountnorris, who was present at table, <HI>it
was done in revenge of that public affront which my Lord
deputy formerly put upon me:</HI> BUT I HAVE A BROTHER,
<PB N="338" REF="386"/>
WHO WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN SUCH A REVENGE.
This casual, and seemingly innocent, at least very ambi∣guous,
expression, was reported to Strassord; who, on
pretence that Mountnorris was an officer, ordered him to be
tried by a court-martial for mutiny and sedition against his
general. The court, which consisted of the chief officers
of the army, found the crime to be capital, and condemned
that nobleman to lose his head<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. iv. p. 187.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN vain did Strafford plead in his own defence against
this article of impeachment, That the sentence against
Mountnorris was the deed, and that too unanimous, of the
court, not the act of the deputy; that he spoke not to a
member of the court, nor voted in the cause, but sat un∣covered
as a party; and then immediately withdrew, to leave them to
their freedom; that sensible of the iniquity
of the sentence, he procured his Majesty's free pardon to
Mountnorris; that he did not even keep that nobleman a
moment in suspence with regard to his sate, but instantly
told him, that he himself would sooner lose his right hand
than execute such a sentence, nor was his lordship's life
in any manner of danger; and that, upon the whole, the only
hardship which Mountnorris suffered, was imprisonment
during two days, after which his liberty was restored him.
In vain did Strafford's friends add, as a further apology,
that Mountnorris was a man of an infamous character, who
paid court, by the lowest adulation, to all deputies, while
present; and blackened their character, by the vilest ca∣lumnies,
when recalled: And that Strafford, expecting like
treatment, had used this expedient for no other purpose
than to subdue the petulant spirit of the man. These ex∣cuses
alleviate the guilt; but there still remains enough to
prove, that the mind of the deputy, tho' great and firm,
had been not a little debauched by the riot of absolute
power, and uncontrouled authority.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="387"/>
WHEN Strafford was called over into England, he found
every thing falling into such confusion, by the open rebel∣lion
of the Scots, and the secret discontents of the English,
that, if he had counselled or executed any violent measure,
he might perhaps have been able to apologize for his con∣duct,
from the great law of necessity, which admits not,
while the necessity is extreme, of any scruple, ceremony,
or delay<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. iv. p. 559.</NOTE>. But in fact, no illegal advice or action was
proved against him; and the whole amount of his guilt,
during this period, was some peevish, or at most imperious
expressions, which, amidst such desperate extremities, and
during a bad state of health, had unhappily fallen from
him.</P>
<P>IF Strafford's apology was, in the main, so satisfactory,
when he pleaded to each particular article of the charge, his
victory was still more decisive, when he brought the whole
together, and repelled the imputation of treason; the crime
which the commons would infer from the full view of his
conduct and behaviour. Of all species of guilt, the law of
England had, with the most scrupulous exactn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, defined
that of treason; because on that side it was found most
necessary to protect the subject against the violence of the
king and of his ministers. By the famous statute of Ed∣ward
III. all the kinds of treason are enumerated, and every
other crime, besides such as are there expressly mentioned,
is carefully excluded from that denomination. But with
regard to this guilt, <HI>An endeavour to subvert the funda∣mental
laws,</HI> the statute of treason is totally silent: And
arbitrarily to introduce it into the fatal catalogue, is itself a
subversion of all law; and, under colour of desending
liberty, reverses a statute the best calculated for the security
of liberty, which had ever been enacted by an English par∣liament.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="388"/>
As this species of treason, discovered by the commons,
is intirely new and unknown to the laws; so is the species
of proof by which they pretend to fix that guilt upon the
prisoner. They have invented a kind of <HI>accumulative</HI> or
<HI>constructive</HI> evidence, by which many actions, either totally
innocent in themselves, or criminal in a much inferior de∣gree,
shall, when united, amount to treason, and subject
the person to the highest penalties inflicted by the law. A
hasty and unguarded word, a rash and passionate action,
assisted by the malevolent fancy of the accuser, and tortured
by doubtful constructions, is transmuted into the deepest
guilt; and the lives and fortunes of the whole nation, no
longer protected by justice, are subjected to arbitrary will
and pleasure.</P>
<P>“WHERE has this species of guilt lain so long con∣cealed?”
said Strafford in conclusion: “Where has this
fire been so long buried, during so many centuries, that
no smoke should appear, till it burst out at once, to con∣sume
me and my children? Better it were to live under
no law at all, and by the maxims of cautious prudence,
to conform ourselves, the best we can, to the arbitrary will
of a master; than fansy we have a law on which we can
rely, and find at last, that this law shall inflict a punish∣ment
precedent to the promulgation, and try us by
maxims unheard-of, till the very moment of the prose∣cution.
If I sail on the Thames, and split my vessel on
an anchor; in case there be no buoy to give warning, the
party shall pay me damages: But, if the anchor <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
marked out, then is the striking on it at my own <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Where is the mark set upon this crime? Where is the
token by which I should discover it? It has lain concealed
under water; and no human prudence, no human inno∣cence,
could save me from the destruction with which I
am at present threatened.</P>
<P><PB N="341" REF="389"/>
IT is now full two hundred and forty years since trea∣sons
were defined; and so long has it been, since any man
was touched to this extent, upon this crime, before my∣self.
We have lived, my lords, happily to ourselves at
home: we have lived gloriously abroad, to the world:
Let us be content with what our fathers have left us:
Let not our ambition carry us to be more learned than
they were, in these killing and destructive arts. Great
wisdom it will be in your lordships, and just providence,
for yourselves, for your posterities, for the whole king∣dom,
to cast from you, into the fire, these bloody and
mysterious volumes of arbitrary and constructive treasons,
as the primitive christians did their books of curious arts,
and betake yourselves to the plain letter of the statute,
which tells you where the crime is, and points out to
you the path by which you may avoid it.</P>
<P>LET us not, to our own destruction, awake those sleep∣ing
lions, by rattling up a company of old records, which
have lain, for so many ages, by the wall, forgotten and
neglected. To all my afflictions, add not this, my
lords, the most severe of any; that I, for my other sins,
not for my treasons, be the means of introducing a pre∣cedent,
so pernicious to the laws and liberties of my na∣tive
country.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, these gentlemen at the bar say they speak
for the commonwealth; and they believe so: Yet, under
favour, it is I who, in this particular, speak for the com∣monwealth.
Precedents, like those endeavoured to be
established against me, must draw along such inconve∣niences
and miseries, that, in a few years, the kingdom
will be in the condition expressed in a statute of HenryIV.;
and no man shall know by what rule to govern his words
and actions.</P>
<P>IMPOSE not, my lords, difficulties insurmountable upon
ministers of state, nor disable them from serving with
<PB N="342" REF="390"/>
chearfulness their king and country. If you examine
them, and under such severe penalties, by every grain,
by every little weight; the scrutiny will be intolerable.
The public affairs of the kingdom must be left waste;
and no wise man, who has any honour or fortune to lose,
will ever engage himself in such dreadful, such unknown
perils.</P>
<P>MY lords, I have now troubled your lordships a great

therefore I shall leave it.</P>
<P>AND now, my lords, I thank God, I have been, by
his blessing, sufficiently instructed in the extreme vanity
of all temporary enjoyments, compared to the importance
of our eternal duration. And so, my lords, even so,
with all humility, and with all tranquillity of mind, I

who expresses himself in these terms, was himself
<PB N="343" REF="391"/>
chairman of that committee which conducted the impeach∣ment
against this unfortunate statesman. The accusation
and defence lasted eighteen days. The managers divided
the several articles among them, and attacked the prisoner
with all the weight of authority, with all the vehemence of
rhetoric, with all the accuracy of long preparation. Straf∣ford
was obliged to speak with deference and reserve towards
his most inveterate enemies, the commons, the Scots nation,
the Irish parliament. He took only a very short time, on
each article, to recollect himself: Yet he alone, without as∣sistance,
mixing modesty and humility with firmness and
vigour, made such a defence, that the commons saw it im∣possible,
by a legal prosecution, ever to obtain a sentence
against him.</P>
<P>BUT the death of Strafford was too important a stroke
of party to be left unattempted by any expedient, however
extraordinary. Besides the great genius and authority of
that minister, he had threatened some of the popular leaders
with an impeachment; and, had he not been suddenly pre∣vented
by an accusation of the commons, he had, that very
day, it was thought, charged Pym, Hambden, and others,
with treason, for having invited the Scots to invade Eng∣land.
A bill of attainder was therefore brought into the
lower house immediately after finishing these pleadings; and
preparatory to it, a new proof of the Earl's guilt was pro∣duced,
in order to remove such scruples as might be enter∣tained
with regard to a method of proceeding so unusual and
irregular.</P>
<P>SIR Henry Vane, secretary, had taken down some notes
of a debate in council, after the dissolution of the last par∣liament;
and being at a distance, he had sent the keys of
his cabinet, as was pretended, to his son, Sir Henry, in
order to search for some papers, which were necessary for
completing a marriage-settlement. Young Vane, falling
upon this paper of notes, deemed the matter of the utmost
consequence; and immediately communicated it to Pym,

<PB N="343" REF="393"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="344" REF="394"/>
who now produced the paper before the house of commons.
The question before the council was; <HI>Offensive or defensive
war with the Scots.</HI> The King proposes this difficulty,
“But how can I undertake offensive war, if I have no more
money?”
The answer ascribed to Strafford was in these
words: Borrow of the city a hundred thousand pounds:
Go on vigorously to levy ship-money. Your Majesty
having tried the affections of your people, you are ab∣solved
and loose from all rules of government, and may
do what power will admit. Your Majesty, having tried
all ways, shall be acquitted before God and man. And
you have an army in Ireland, which you may employ to
reduce THIS kingdom to obedience: For I am confident
the Scots cannot hold out five months.” There followed
some counsels of Laud and Cottington, equally violent, with re∣gard
to the King's being absolved from all rules of government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 223, 229, 230, &amp;c. Whitlocke, p. 41. May, p. 93.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS paper, with all the circumstances of its discovery
and communication, was pretended to be equivalent to two
witnesses, and to be an unanswerable proof of those perni∣cious
counsels of Strafford, which tended to the subversion
of the laws and constitution. But it was replied by Straf∣ford
and his friends, That old Vane was his most inveterate
and declared enemy; and if the secretary himself, as was
by far most probable, had willingly delivered to his son this
paper of notes, to be communicated to Pym, this implied
such a breach of oaths and of trust as rendered him totally
unworthy of all credit. That the secretary's deposition was
at first exceedingly dubious: Upon two examinations, he
could not remember any such words: Even the third time,
his testimony was not positive, but imported only, that
Strafford had spoke such or such-like words: And words
may be very like in sound, and differ much in sense; nor
ought the lives of men to depend upon grammatical criti∣cisms
of any expressions, much less of those delivered by
<PB N="345" REF="395"/>
the speaker without premeditation, and committed by the
hearer, for any time, however short, to the uncertain record
of memory. That, in the present case, changing. <HI>This
kingdom</HI> into <HI>That kingdom,</HI> a very slight alteration<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>excl; the
Earl's discourse could regard nothing but Scotland, and im∣plies
no advice unworthy of an English counsellor. That
even retaining the expression, <HI>This kingdom,</HI> the words may
fairly be understood of Scotland, which alone was the king∣dom
that the debate regarded, and which alone had thrown
off allegiance, and could be reduced to obedience. That it
could be proved, as well by the evidence of all the King's
ministers, as by the known disposition of the forces, that
the intention, never was to land the Irish army in England,
but in Scotland. That of six other counsellors present,
Laud and Windebank could give no evidence; Northum∣berland,
Hamilton, Cottington, and Juxon, could recol∣lect
no such expression; and the advice was too remarkable
to be easily forgot. That it was no-wise probable such a
desperate counsel would be openly delivered at the board,
and before Northumberland, a person of that high rank, and
whose attachments to the court were so much weaker than
his attachments to the country. That tho' Northumberland,
and he alone, had recolle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted some such expression, as that
<HI>Of being absolved from rules of government;</HI> yet, in such
desperate extremities as those into which the King and king∣dom
were then fallen, a maxim of that nature, allowing it
to be delivered by Strafford, may be defended, upon prin∣ciples
the most favourable to law and liberty. And that
nothing could be more iniquitous, than to extract an accu∣sation
of treason from an opinion simply proposed at the
council-table; where all freedom of debate ought to be
permitted, and where it was not unusual for the members,
in order to draw forth the sentiments of others, to propose
counsels very remote from their own secret advice and judg∣ment<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. iv. p. 560.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="396"/>
THE evidence of Secretary Vane, though exposed to
such unsurmountable objections, was the real cause of Straf∣ford's
unhappy fate; and made the bill of attainder pass the
commons with no greater opposition than that of fifty-nine
dissenting votes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill of at∣tainder.</NOTE> But there remained two other branches
of the legislature, the King and the lords, whose assent was
requisite; and these, if left to their free judgment, it was
easily foresseen, would reject the bill without scruple or deli∣beration.
To overcome this difficulty, the popular leaders
employed expedients, for which they were beholden partly
to their own industry, partly to the imprudence of their
adversaries.</P>
<P>NEXT Sunday after the bill passed the commons, the pu∣ritanical
pulpits resounded with declamations concerning the
necessity of executing justice upon great delinquents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 43</NOTE>. The
populace took the alarm. About six thousand men, armed
with swords and cudgels, slocked from the city, and fur∣rounded
the houses of parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE> The names of the fifty-nine commoners, who had voted against the bill of at∣tainder,
were posred up under the title of <HI>Straffordians,
and betrayers of f their country.</HI> These were exposed to all
the insults of the ungovernable multitude. When any of
the lords paired, the cry for <HI>Justice</HI> against Strafford resounded
in their ears: And such as were suspected of friendship to
that obnoxious minister, were sure to meet with menaces,
not unaccompanied with symptoms of the most desperate re∣solutions
in the furious populace<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 232, 256. Rush. vol. v. p. 248, 1279.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COMPLAINTS in the house of commons being made
against these violences as the most slagrant breach of privi∣lege,
the ruling members, by their affected coolness and
indifference, showed, plainily-, that the popular tumults were
not disagreeable to them<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, ut supra.</NOTE> But a-new discovery, made about
<PB N="347" REF="397"/>
this time, served to throw every thing into still greater
flame and combustion.</P>
<P>SOME principal officers, Piercy, Jermyn, O Neale, Goring,
Wilmot, Pollard, Ashburnham, partly attached to the court,
partly disgusted with the parliament, had formed a plan of
engaging into the King's service the English army, whom
they observed to be displeased at some marks of preference
given by the commons to the Scots. For this purpose, they
entered into an association, took an oath of secrecy, and
kept a close correspondence with some of the King's ser∣vants.
The form of a petition to the King and parliament
was concerted; and it was proposed to get this petition sub∣scribed
by the army. The petitioners there represent the
great and unexampled concessions made by the King for the
security of public peace and liberty; the endless demands of
certain insatiable and turbulent spirits, whom nothing less will
content than a total subversion of the antient constitution;
the frequent tumults which these factious malecontents had
excited, and which endangered the liberty of parliament.
To prevent these mischiefs, the army offered to come up
and guard that assembly. “So shall the nation,” as they
express themselves in the conclusion, “not only be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indi∣cated
from precedent innovations, but be secured from
the future which are threatened, and which are likely to
produce more dangerous effects than the forme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 247. whitlocke, p. 43.</NOTE>.” The
draught of this petition being conveyed to the King, he was
prevailed on, somewhat imprudently, to countersign <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣self,
as a mark of his approbation. But as several difficul∣ties
occurred, the project was laid aside two months before
any public discovery was made of it.</P>
<P>IT was Goring who betrayed the secret to the popular
leaders. The alarm may easily be imagined, which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in∣telligence
conveyed. Petitions from the military to the civil
<PB N="348" REF="398"/>
power are always looked on as disguised, or rather undis∣guised
commands; and are of a nature widely different from
petitions presented by any other rank of men. Pym opened
the matter in the house<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 240.</NOTE>. On the first intimation of a dis∣covery,
Piercy concealed himself, and Jermyn withdrew be∣yond
sea. This farther confirmed the suspicion of a dangerous
conspiracy. Goring delivered his evidence before the house.
Piercy wrote a letter to his brother, Northumberland, con∣fessing
most of the particulars<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 255.</NOTE>. Both their testimonies
agree with regard to the oath of secrecy; and as this cir∣cumstance
had been denied by Pollard, Ashburnham, and
Wilmot, in all their examinations, it was regarded as a
new proof of some desperate resolutions which had been
taken.</P>
<P>To convey more quickly the terror and indignation at
this plot, the commons voted, that a protestation should be
signed by all the members. It was sent up to the lords, and
signed by all of them, except Southampton and Robarts.
Orders were given by the commons alone, without other
authority, that it should be subscribed by the whole nation.
The protestation was in itself very inoffensive, and even in∣significant,
and contained nothing but general declarations
that the subscribers would defend their religion and liber∣ties<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Cla∣rendon, vol. i. p. 252. Rush. vol. v. p. 241. Warwick, p. 180.</NOTE>. But it tended to increase the popular panic, and in∣timated,
what was more expressly declared in the preamble,
that these blessings were now exposed to the utmost peril.</P>
<P>ALARMS were every day given of new conspiracies<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Dug∣dale, p. 69. Franklyn, p. 901.</NOTE>. In
Lancashire, great multitudes of papists were gathering to∣gether:
Secret meetings were held by them in caves and
under-ground in Surrey: They had entered into a plot to
blow up the river with gun-powder, in order to drown the
city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Edw. Walker, p. 349.</NOTE>: Provisions of arms were making beyond-sea: Some∣times
France, sometimes Denmark, was forming designs
<PB N="349" REF="399"/>
against the kingdom: And the populace, who are always
terrified with present, and enraged with distant dangers,
were still farther animated in their demands of justice against
the unfortunate Strafford.</P>
<P>THE King came to the house of lords: And tho' he ex∣pressed
his resolution, for which he offered them any secu∣rity,
never again to employ Strafford in any branch of pub∣lic
business; he professed himself totally dissatisfied with
regard to the circumstances of treason, and on that account
declared his difficulty in giving his assent to the bill of at∣tainder<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 239.</NOTE>.
The commons took fire, and voted it a breach
of privilege for the King to take notice of any bill depend∣ing
before the house. Charles did not perceive, that his at∣tachment
to Strafford was the chief motive of the bill; and
that, the greater proofs he gave of anxious concern for this
minister, the more inevitable did he render his destruction.</P>
<P>ABOUT eighty peers had constantly attended Strafford's
trial; but such apprehensions were entertained on account
of the popular tumults, that only forty-five were present
when the bill of attainder was brought into the house. Yet
of these, nineteen had the courage to vote against it. A
certain proof, that, if intire freedom had been allowed, the
bill had been rejected by a great majority.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, p. 43.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN carrying up the bill to the lords, St. John, the solicitor∣general,
advanced two topics, well suited to the fury of the
times; that, tho' the testimony against Strafford were not
clear, yet, in this way of bill, private satisfaction to each
man's conscience was sufficient, even should no evidence at
all be produced; and that the Earl had no title to plead
law, because he had broke the law. It is true, added he,
we give law to hares and deer; for they are beasts of chace.
But it was never accounted either cruel or unfair to destroy
foxes or wolves, where-ever they can be found; for they
are beasts of prey<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cla∣rendon, vol. i. p. 232.</NOTE>.

AFTER popular violence had prevailed over the lords;
the same batteries were next applied to force the King's as∣sent.
The populace flocked about Whitehall, and accom∣panied
their demand of justice with the loudest clamours
and most open menaces. Rumors of conspiracies against
the parliament were anew spread abroad: Invasions and in∣surrections
talked of: And the whole nation was raised into
such a ferment, as threatened some great and imminent
convulsion. On which-ever side the King cast his eyes, he
saw no resource nor security. All his servants, consulting
their own safety, rather than their master's honour, declined
interposing with their advice between him and his parlia∣ment.
The Queen, terrified with the appearance of so
mighty a danger, and bearing formerly no good-will to
Strafford, was in tears, and pressed him to satisfy his people
in this demand, which, it was hoped, would finally content
them. Juxon alone, whose courage was not inferior to his
other virtues, ventured to advise him, if, in his conscience;
he did not approve of the bill, by no means to assent to
it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 257. Warwick, p. 160.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD, hearing of the King's irresolution and an∣xiety,
took a very extraordinary step: He wrote a letter, in
which he intreated the King, for the sake of public peace,
to put an end to his unfortunate, however innocent life, and
to quiet the tumultuous people by granting them that re∣quest,
for which they were so importunate<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, ut supra, p. 258. Rush. vol. v. p. 251.</NOTE>. “In this,”
added he, “my consent will more acquit you to God than
all the world can do besides. To a willing man there is
no injury. And as, by God's grace, I forgive all the
world with a calmness and meekness, of infinite content∣ment
to my dislodging soul; so, Sir, to you, I can re∣sign
the life of this world with all imaginable chearful∣ness,
in the just acknowlegement of your exceeding fa∣vours.”
<PB N="351" REF="403"/>
Perhaps, Strafford hoped, that this unusual in∣stance
of generosity would engage the King still more stre∣nuously
to protect him: Perhaps, he gave his life for lost;
and finding himself in the hands of his enemies, and ob∣serving
that Balfour, the lieutenant of the Tower, was intirely
devoted to the popular party<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 44. Franklyn, p. 896.</NOTE>; he absolutely despaired of
ever escaping the multiplied dangers with which he was
every-where invironed. We might ascribe this step to a
noble effort of disinterestedness not unworthy the great
mind of Strafford; if the measure which he advised had
not been, in the event, as pernicious to his master, as it
was immediately fatal to himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Carte, in his life of the duke of Ormond, has given us some evidence to prove, that this letter was intirely a forgery of the popular leaders, in order to induce the King to sacrifice Strafford. He tells us, that Strafford said so to his son, the night before his execution. But there are some reasons, why I adhere to the com∣mon way of telling this story. The account of the forgery came thro' several hands, and from men <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> characters not fully known to the public. A circumstance which weakens every evidence. 'Tis a hearsay of a hearsay, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. It seems impossible, but young Lord Strafford must inform the King, who would not fail to trace the forgery, and expose his enemies to their merited <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 3. 'Tis not to be conceived but Clarendon and Whitlccke, not to mention <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, must have heard of the matter. 4. Sir George Ratcliffe, in his life <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Strafford, tells the story the same way that Clarendon and Whitlocke do. Would he also, who was Strafford's intimate friend, never have heard of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>? 'Tis remarkable, that this life is dedicated or addressed to young Strafford. Would not he have put Sir George right in so material and inter∣esting a fact?</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER the most violent anxiety and doubt, Charles at
last granted a commission to four noblemen to give the royal
assent, in his name, to the bill: Flattering himself, proba∣bly,
in this extremity of distress, that, as neither his will
consented to the deed, nor was his hand immediately en∣gaged
in it, he was the more free from all the guilt which
attended it. These commissioners he impowered, at the
same time, to give assent to the bill which rendered the par∣liament
perpetual.

THE commons, from policy, more than from necessity,
had embraced the expedient of paying the two armies by
borrowing money from the city; and this loan they had re∣paid
afterwards by taxes levied upon the people. The citi∣zens,
either of themselves or by suggestion, began to start
difficulties with regard to a farther loan which was de∣manded.
We make no scruple of trusting the parliament,
said they, were we certain that the parliament was to con∣tinue
till our repayment. But, in the present precarious
situation of affairs, what security can be given us for our
money? In order to obviate this objection, a bill was sud∣denly
brought into the house, and passed with great unani∣mity
and rapidity, that the parliament should not be dis∣solved,
prorogued, nor adjourned, without their own con∣sent.
It was hurried in like manner thro' the house of
peers; and was instantly carried to the King for his assent.
Charles, in the agony of grief, shame, and remorse, for
Strafford's doom, perceived not that this other bill was of
still more fatal consequence to his authority; and rendered
the power of his enemies perpetual, as it was already un∣controulable<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i., p. 261, 262.</NOTE>.
In comparison of the bill of attainder, by
which he deemed himself an accomplice in his friend's
murder, this concession made no figure in his eyes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What made this bill appear of less consequence was, that the parliament voted ton∣nage and poundage for no longer a period than two months: And as that branch was more than half of the revenue, and the government could not possibly subsist without it; it seemed indirectly in the power of the parlia∣ment to continue themselves as long as they pleased. This indeed was true in the ordinary administration of government: But on the approaches towards a civil war, which was not then foreseen, it had been of great consequence to the King to have reserved the right of dissolution, and to have suffered any extremity, rather than allow the continuance of the parliament.</NOTE>: A
circumstance, which, if it lessens our idea of his resolution
or penetration, serves to prove the integrity of his heart, and
the goodness of his disposition. It is indeed certain, that
strong compunction for his consent to Strafford's execution
<PB N="353" REF="407"/>
attended this unfortunate Prince during all the remainder of
his life; and even at his own fatal end, the memory of this
guilt, with great sorrow and remorse, recurred upon him.
All men were so sensible of the extreme violence which was
done him, that he suffered the less, both in character and inter∣est,
from this unhappy measure; and tho' he abandoned his
best friend, yet was he still able to preserve, in some degree,
the attachment of all his adherents.</P>
<P>SECRETARY Carleton was sent by the King to inform
Strafford of the final resolution which necessity had extorted
from him. The Earl seemed surprised, and, starting up,
exclaimed in the words of the scripture, <HI>Put not your trust
in princes, nor in the sons of men; For in them there is no
salvation</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 44.</NOTE>. He was soon able, however, to collect his
courage; and he prepared himself to suffer the fatal sen∣tence.
Only three days interval was allowed him. The
King, who made a new effort in his behalf, and sent, by the
hands of the young Prince, a letter addressed to the peers,
in which he entreated them to confer with the commons
about a mitigation of Strafford's sentence, and begged at
least for some delay, was refused in both requests<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 265.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>STRAFFORD,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Stafford.</NOTE> in passing from his apartment to Tower∣hill,
where the scaffold was erected, stopped under Laud's
windows, with whom he had long lived in intimate friend∣ship;
and intreated the assistance of his prayers, in those
awful moments which were approaching: The aged pri∣mate
dissolved is tears; and having pronounced, with a
broken voice, a tender blessing on his departing friend, sunk
into the arms of his attendants<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 198.</NOTE>. Strafford, still superior
to his fate, marched on with an elated countenance, and
with an air even of greater dignity than what usually at∣tended
him. He wanted that consolation which commonly
supports those who perish by the stroke of injustice and op∣pression:
<PB N="354" REF="408"/>
He was not buoyed up by glory, nor by the af∣fectionate
compassion of the specta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors: Yet his mind, erect
and undaunted, found resources within itself, and maintained
its unbroken resolution, amidst the terrors of death, and
the triumphant exultations of his misguided enemies. His
discourse on the scaffold was full of decency and courage.
“He feared,” he said, “that the omen was bad for the in∣tended
reformation of the slate, that it commenced with
“the shedding of innocent blood.” Having bid a last
adieu to his brother and friends who attended him, and
having sent a blessing to his nearer relations who were ab∣sent;
“And now,” said he, “I have nigh done! One
stroke will make my wife a widow, my dear children fa∣therless,
deprive my poor servants of their indulgent mas∣ter,
and separate me from my affectionate brother and all
my friends! But let God be to you and them all in all!”
Going to disrobe, and prepare himself for the block, “I
thank God,” said he, “that I am no way afraid of death,
nor am daunted with any terrors; but do as chearfully
lay down my head at this time, as ever I did when going
to repose!” With one blow was a period put to his life
by the executioner<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 267.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS perished, in the 49th year of his age, the famous
Earl of Strafford, one of the most eminent personages who
has appeared in England. Tho' his death was loudly de∣manded
as a satisfaction to justice, and an atonement for the
many violations of the constitution; it may safely be af∣firmed,
that the sentence, by which he fell, was an enormity
greater than the worst of those which his implacable enemies
prosecuted with so much cruel industry. The people, in
their rage, had totally mistaken the proper object of their
resentment. All the necessities, or, more properly speaking,
the difficulties, by which the King had been induced to use
violent expedients for raising money, were the result of
<PB N="355" REF="409"/>
measures precedent to Strafford's favour; and if they arose
from ill conduct, he, at least, was intirely innocent. Even
those violent expedients themselves, which occasioned the
complaint that the constitution was subverted, had been, all
of them, conducted, so far as appeared, without his coun∣sel
or assistance. And whatever his private advice might be<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That Strafford was secretly no enemy to arbitrary counsels, appears from some of his letters and dispatches, particularly vol. ii. p. 60. where he seems to wish that a standing army were established.</NOTE>, this salutary maxim he failed not, often and publickly,
to inculcate in the King's presence, that, if any inevitable
necessity ever obliged the sovereign to violate the laws, this
licence ought to be practised with extreme reserve, and, as
soon as possible, a just atonement be made to the constitu∣tion,
for any injury which it might sustain from such dan∣gerous
precedents<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. iv. p. 567, 568, 569, 570.</NOTE>. The first parliament after the restora∣tion
reversed the bill of attainder; and even a few weeks
after Strafford's execution, this very parliament remitted to
his children the more severe consequences of his sentence:
As if conscious of the violence with which the prosecution
had been conducted.</P>
<P>IN vain did Charles expect, as a return for so many
instances of unbounded compliance, that the parliament
would at last show him some indulgence, and would cor∣dially
fall into that unanimity, to which, at the expence of
his own power, and of his friend's life, he so earnestly
courted them. All his concessions were poisoned by their
suspicion of his insincerity; and the supposed attempt to
engage the army against them, served with many as a con∣firmation
of this jealousy. It was natural for the King to
seek some resource, while all the world seemed to desert
him, or combine against him; and this probably was the
utmost of that embryo-scheme which was formed with regard
to the army. But the popular leaders still insisted, that a
desperate plot was laid to bring up the forces immediately,
<PB N="356" REF="410"/>
and offer violence to the parliament: A design of which
Piercy's evidence acquits the King, and which the near
neighbourhood of the Scots army seems to render absolutely
impracticable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The project of bringing up the army to London, according to Piercy, was proposed to the King; but he rejected it as foolish: Because the Scots, who were in arms, and lying in their neighbourhood, must be/at London as soon as the English army. This reason is so solid and convincing, that it leaves no room to doubt of the veracity of Piercy's evidence; and consequently acquits the King of this terrible plot of brining up the army, which made such a noise at that time, and was a pretence for so many violences.</NOTE>. By means, however, of these suspicions,
was the same implacable spirit still kept alive; and the com∣mons,
without giving the King any satisfaction in the settlement
of his revenue, proceeded to carry their inroads, with
great vigour, into his now defenceless prerogative<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 266.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE two ruling passions of this parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">High-com∣ission and star-cham∣ber abolissh∣ed.</NOTE> were zeal
for liberty, and an aversion to the church of England; and
to both of these, nothing could appear more exceptionable,
than the court of high-commission, whose institution
ren∣dered it intirely arbitrary, and assigned to it the defence of
the ecclesiastical establishment. The star-chamber also was
a court, which exerted very high discretionary powers; and
had no precise rule or limit, either with regard to the causes
which came under its jurisdiction, or the decisions which it
formed. A bill unanimously passed the houses, to abolish
these two courts; and, in them, to annihilate the principal
and most dangerous articles of the King's prerogative. By
the same bill, the jurisdiction of the council was regulated,
and its authority abridged<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 283, 284. Whitlocke, p. 47 Rushworth, vol. iii. p. 1383, 1384.</NOTE>. Charles hesitated before he
gave his assent. But finding that he had gone too far to
retreat, and that he possessed no resource in case of a rup∣ture,
he at last affixed the royal sanction to these excellent
bills. But, to show the parliament that he was sufficiently
apprised of the importance of his grant, he observed to them,
that these new statutes altered in a great measure the funda∣mental
<PB N="357" REF="411"/>
laws, ecclesiastical and civil, which many of his pre∣decessors
had established<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 307.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY removing the star-chamber, the King's power of bind∣ing
the people by his proclamations, was indirectly abo∣lished;
and that important branch of prerogative, the strong
symbol of arbitrary power, and unintelligible in a limited
constitution, being at last removed, left, the system of go∣vernment
more consistent and uniform. The star-chamber
alone was accustomed to punish infractions of the King's
edicts: But as no courts of judicature now remained, ex∣cept
those in Westminster-hall, which take cognizance only
of common and statute law, the King may thenceforth issue
proclamations, but no man is bound to obey them. It must,
however, be confessed, that the experiment here made by
the parliament, was not a little rash and adventurous. No
government, at that time, appeared in the world, nor is per∣haps
to be found in the records of any history, which sub∣sisted
without the mixture of some arbitrary authority, com∣mitted
to some magistrate; and it might reasonably, before∣hand,
appear doubtful, whether human society could ever
arrive at that state of perfection, as to support itself with
no other controul, than the general and rigid maxims of law
and equity. But the parliament justly thought that the
King was too eminent a magistrate to be trusted with discre∣tionary
power, which he might so easily turn to the destru∣ction
of liberty. And in the event it has been found, that,
though some inconveniencies arise from the maxim of ad∣hering
strictly to law, yet the advantages so much overba∣lance
them, as should render the English for ever grateful
to the memory of their ancestors, who, after repeated con∣tests,
at last established that noble principle.</P>
<P>AT the request of the parliament, Charles, instead of the
patents during pleasure, gave all the judges patents during

their good behaviour<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">May, p. 107.</NOTE>. A circumstance of the greatest
moment towards securing their independency, and barring
the entrance of arbitrary power into the ordinary courts of
judicature.</P>
<P>THE marshal's court, which took cognizance of offensive
words, and was not thought sufficiently limited by law, was
also, for that reason, abolished<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nalson. vol. i. p. 778.</NOTE>. The stannary courts,
which exercised jurisdiction over the miners, being liable to
a like objection, underwent a like fate. The abolition of
the council of the north and the council of Wales followed
from the same principles. The authority of the clerk of
the market, who had a general inspection over the weights
and measures throughout the kingdom, was transferred to
the mayors, sheriffs, and ordinary magistrates.</P>
<P>IN short, if we take a surve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the transactions of this
memorable parliament, during the first period of their ope∣rations,
we shall find, that, excepting Strafford's attainder,
which was a complication of cruel iniquity, their merits, in
other-respects, so much overbalance their mistakes, as to in∣title
them to very ample praises from all lovers of liberty.
Not only former complaints were remedied and grievances
redressed: Great provision, for the future, was made by
excellent laws against the return of like complaints. And if
the means, by which they obtain such mighty advantages,
favour often of artifice, sometimes of violence; it is to be
considered, that revolutions of government cannot be effected
by the mere force of argument and reasoning: And that
factions being once excited, men can neither so firmly regu∣late
the tempers of others, nor their own, as, to ensure
themselves against all exorbitances.</P>
<P>THE parliament now came to a pause. The King had
promised his Scots subjests, that he would this summer pay
them a visit, in order to settle their government; and tho'
<PB N="359" REF="415"/>
the English parliament was very importunate with him,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of Aug. King's journey to Scotland.</NOTE> that he should lay aside that journey, they could not pre∣vail
with him so much as to delay it. As he must necessarily
in his journey have passed through the troops of both na∣tions,
the commons seem to have entertained great jealousy
on that account, and to have now hurried on, as much as
they formerly delayed, the disbanding the armies. The
arrears therefore of the Scots were intirely paid them; and
those of the English in part. The Scots returned home,
and the English were separated into their several counties,
and dismissed.</P>
<P>AFTER this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Sept.</NOTE> the parliament adjourned to the 20th of
October; and a committee of both houses, a thing altoge∣ther
unprecedented, was appointed to fit during the recess,
with very ample powers<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 387.</NOTE>. Pym was appointed chairman
of the lower house. Farther attempts were made by the
parliament, while it sat, and even by the commons alone,
for assuming sovereign executive powers, and publishing
their ordinances, as they called them, instead of laws. The
committee too, on their parts, were ready to imitate this
example.</P>
<P>A SMALL committee of both houses were appointed to
attend the King into Scotland, in order, as it was pretended,
to see that the articles of pacification were executed; but
really to be spies upon him, and extend still farther the ideas
of parliamentary authority, as well as eclipse the majesty of
the King. The Earl of Bedford, Lord Howard, Sir Philip
Stapleton, Sir William Armyne, Fiennes, and Hambden, were
the persons chosen<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 376.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ENDEAVOURS were used, before Charles's departure, to
have a protector of the kingdom appointed, with a power
to pass laws without having recourse to the King. So
<PB N="360" REF="416"/>
little regard was now paid to royal authority, or to the esta∣blished
constitution of the kingdom.</P>
<P>AMIDST the great variety of affairs which occurred du∣ring
this busy period, we have almost overlooked the mar∣riage
of the Princess Mary with William Prince of Orange.
The King concluded not this alliance without communicating
his intentions to the parliament, who received the proposal
with satisfaction<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 38.</NOTE>. This was the commencement of the
connections with the family of Orange: Connections, which
were afterwards attended with the most important conse∣quences,
both to the kingdom and the house of Stuart.</P>

<P>THE Scots, who first began these fatal commotions,
thought, that they had finished a very perilous un∣dertaking,
much to their profit and reputation, Besides the
large pay voted them for lying in good quarters during a
twelvemonth, the English parliament had conferred on them
a present of 300,000 pounds for their brotherly assistance<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. i. p. 747. May, p. 104.</NOTE>.
In the articles of pacification, they were declared to have
ever been good subjects; and their military expeditions
were approved of, as enterprizes calculated and intended
for his Majesty's honour and advantage: To carry farther
the triumph over their sovereign, these terms, so ignomi∣nious
to him, were ordered, by a vote of parliament, to
be read in all churches, upon a day of thanksgiving ap∣pointed
for the national pacification<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 365. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 293.</NOTE>: All their claims, for
their restriction of prerogative, were agreed to be ratified:
And what they more valued than all these advantages; they
had a near prospect of spreading the presbyterian discipline
in England and Ireland, from the seeds., which they had
scattered, of their religious principles. Never did refined

in the view of law and order established by her victorious
arms; as the Scots now rejoiced, in communicating their
barbarous zeal, and theological fervour, to the neighbouring
nations.</P>
<P>CHARLES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 14</NOTE> despoiled in England of a considerable part
of his authority, and dreading still farther encroachments
upon him, arrived in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of Scotland.</NOTE> with an intention of abdi∣cating
almost intirely the small share of power, which <HI>there</HI>
remained to him, and of giving full satisfaction, if possible,
to his restless.subjects in that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE lords of articles were an antient institution in the
Scots parliament. They were constituted after this man∣ner.
The lords chose eight bishops: The bishops elected
eight lords: These sixteen named eight commissioners of
counties, and eight burgesses: And without the previous
consent of the thirty-two, who were denominated lords of
articles, no motion could be made in the parliament. As
the bishops were intirely devoted to the court, it is evident,
that all the lords of articles, by necessary consequence, de∣pended
on the King's nomination; and the prince, besides
one negative after the bills passed through the parliament,
possessed indirectly another before their introduction; a
prerogative of much greater consequence than the former.
The bench of bishops being now abolished, the parliament
wisely laid hold of the opportunity, and totally set aside the
lords of articles: And till this important point was ob∣tained,
the nation, properly speaking, could not be said to
enjoy any regular freedom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Mem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that, notwithstanding this institution,
which had no parallel in England, the royal authority was
always deemed much lower in Scotland than in the former
kingdom. Bacon represents it as one advantage to be ex∣pected
<PB N="363" REF="421"/>
from the union, that the too extensive prerogative of
England would be abridged by the example of Scotland,
and the too narrow prerogative of Scotland be enlarged from
imitation of England. The English were, at that time, a
civilized people, and obedient to the laws: But among the
Scots, it was of little consequence how the laws were
framed, or by whom voted, while the exorbitant aristo∣cracy
had it so much in their power to prevent their regular
execution.</P>
<P>THE peers and commons formed only one house in the
Scots parliament: And as it had been the practice of James,
continued by Charles, to grace English gentlemen with
Scots titles; all the determinations of parliament, it was
to be feared, would in time depend upon the prince, by
means of these votes of foreigners, who had no interest nor
concern in the nation. It was therefore a law, deserving
great approbation, that no man should be capable of being
created a Scots peer, who possessed not 10,000 marks
(above 500 pounds) of annual rent in the kingdom<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burner, Mem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A LAW for triennial parliaments was likewise passed;
and it was ordained, that the last act of every parliament
should be to appoint the time and place for holding the par∣liament
next ensuing<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was deprived of that power, formerly exer∣cised,
of issuing proclamations which enjoined obedience,
under the penalty of treason: A prerogative, which in∣vested
him with the whole legislative authority, even in
matters of the highest consequence<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So far was laudable: But the most fatal blow given to
royal authority, and what, in a manner dethroned the
Prince, was the article, that no member of the privy
council, in whose hands, during the King's absence, the
whole administration lay, no officer of state, none of the
<PB N="364" REF="422"/>
judges, should be appointed but by advice and approba∣tion
of parliament. Charles even agreed to deprive, of
their seats, four judges who had adhered to his interests;
and their place was supplied by others more agreeable to
the ruling party. Several of the covenanters were also
sworn of the privy council. And all the ministers of state,
counsellors, and judges, were, by law, to hold their places
during life or good behaviour<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Mem.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, while in Scotland, conformed himself in∣tirely
to the established church; and assisted at the long
prayers and longer sermons, with which the presbyterians
endeavoured to regale him. He bestowed pensions and pre∣ferments
on Henderson, Gillespy, and other popular preachers;
and practised every art to soften, if pot to gain, his greatest
enemies. The Earl of Argyle was created a Marquis, Lord
Loudon an Earl, Lesley was dignified with the title of Earl
of Leven<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 309.</NOTE>. His friends, he was obliged, for the present,
to neglect and overlook: Some of them were disgusted:
And his enemies were not reconciled; but ascribed all his
caresses and favours to artifice and necessity.</P>
<P>ARGYLE and Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 20.</NOTE> being seized with an apprehen∣sion,
real or counterfeit, that the Earl of Crawfurd and
others intended to assassinate them, left the parliament sud∣denly,
and retired into the country: But upon invitation
arid assurances, returned in a few days. This event, which
had neither cause nor effect that was visible, nor purpose,
nor consequence, was commonly denominated the <HI>incident.</HI>
But though this event had no effect in Scotland; what was
not expected, it was attended with consequences in England.
The English parliament, which was now assembled, being
willing to awaken the people's tenderness by exciting their
fears, immediately took the alarm; as if the malignants, so
they called the King's party, had laid a plot at once to mur∣der
them and all the godly in both kingdoms. They ap∣pied,
<PB N="365" REF="423"/>
therefore, to Essex, whom the King had left
general in the south of England; and he ordered a guard to attend
them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 49. Dugdale, p. 72. Burnet's Memoirs of the House of Hamilton, p. 184, 185. Clarendon, p. 299.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT while the King was employed in pacifying the com∣motions
in Scotland, and was preparing to return to Eng∣land,
in order to apply himself to the same salutary work in
that kingdom; he received intelligence of a dangerous re∣bellion
broke out in Ireland, with circumstances of 'the ut∣most.
horror, bloodshed, and devastation. On every side,
this unfortunate Prince was pursued with murmurs, discon∣tent,
faction, and civil wars; and the fire, from all quar∣ters,
even by the most independent accidents, at once blazed
up about him.</P>
<P>THE great plan of James, in the administration of Ireland,
continued by Charles, was, by justice and peace to recon∣cile
that turbulent people to the authority of laws, and, in∣troducing
art and indusrry among them, to cure that sloth
and barbarism to which they had ever been subject. In or∣der
to serve both these purposes, and, at the same time, se∣cure
the dominion of Ireland to the English crown, great
colonies of British had been carried over, and, being inter∣mixed
with the Irish, had every where introduced a new
face of things into that country. During a peace of near
forty years, the inveterate quarrels between die nations seem∣ed,
in a great measure, to be obliterated; and though much
of the landed property, forfeited by rebellion, had been
conferred on the new planters, a more than equal return had
been made, by their instructing the natives in tillage, build∣ing,
manifactures, and all the civilized arts of life<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sir John Tem∣ple Irish Rebellion, p. 12.</NOTE>. This
had been the course of things during the successive admi∣nistrations
of Chichester, Grandison, Falkland, and, above
all, of Strafford. Under the government of this last no∣bleman

<PB N="365" REF="425"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="366" REF="426"/>
the pacific plans, now come to greater maturity,
and forwarded by his vigour and Industry, seemed to have
operated with full successs, and to have bestowed, at last,
on that savage country, the face of an European settle∣ment.</P>
<P>AFTER Strafford fell a victim to popular rage, the ru∣mours,
excited in Ireland by that great event, could not
suddenly be composed; but continued to produce the greatest
innovations in the government.</P>
<P>THE British protestants transplanted into Ireland, having,
every moment, before their eyes all the horrors of popery,
had naturally been carried into the opposite extreme, and
had universally adopted the highest principles and practices
of the puritans. Monarchy, as well as the hierarchy, was
become odious to them; and every method of limiting the
authority of the crown, and detaching themselves from the
King of England, was greedily adopted and pursued. They
considered not, that, as they scarce composed the sixth part
of the people, and were secretly obnoxious to the antient
inhabitants; their only method of. supporting themselves
was by maintaining royal authority, and preserving a great
dependance on their mother-country. The English com∣mons
likewise, in their furious prosecution of Strafford,
had overlooked the most obvious consequences; and, while
they imputed to him, as a crime, every discretionary act of
authority, they despoiled all succeeding governors of that
power, by which alone the Irish could be retained in sub∣jection.
And so strong was the current for popular go∣vernment
in all the three kingdoms, that the most establis∣ed
maxims of policy were every where abandoned, in order
to gratify this ruling passion.</P>
<P>CHARLES, unable to resist, had been obliged to yield
to the Irish, as to the Scots and English parliaments; and
found too, that their encroachments still rose in proportion
to his concessions. Those subsidies, which themselves had
<PB N="367" REF="427"/>
voted, they reduced, by a subsequent vote, to a fourth part:
The court of high commission was determined to be a griev∣ance:
Martial law abolished: The jurisdiction of the council
annihilated: Proclamations and acts of state declared of no
authority: Every order or institution, which depended on
monarchy, was invaded; and the Prince was despoiled of
all his prerogative, without the least pretext of any violence
or illegality in his administration.</P>
<P>THE standing army of Ireland was usually abont 3000
men; but in order to assist the King in suppressing the Scots
covenanters, Strafford had raised 8000 more, and had in∣corporated
with them a thousand men, drawn from the old
army; a necessary expedient for bestowing order and disci∣pline
on the new-levied soldiers. The private men in this
army were all catholics; but the officers, both commission
and non-commission, were protestants, and could intirely be
depended on by Charles. The English commons enter∣tained
the greatest apprehensions on account of this army;
and never ceased soliciting the King, till he agreed to break
it: Nor would they consent to any proposals for augment∣ing
the standing army to 5000 men; a number which
the King judged requisite for retaining Ireland in obe∣dience.</P>
<P>CHARLES, thinking it dangerous, that 8000 men, ac∣customed
to idleness, and trained to the use of arms, should
be dispersed among a nation so turbulent and unsettled,
agreed with the Spanish ambassador to have them transported
into Flanders, and inlisted in his master's service. The
English commons, apprehensive, that regular bodies of
troops, disciplined in the Low Countries, would prove still
more dangerous, showed some aversion to this expedient;
and the King reduced his allowance to 4000 men. But
when the Spaniards had hired ships for transporting these
Droops, and the men were ready for embarkation; the com∣mons,
willing to show their power, and not displeased with
<PB N="368" REF="428"/>
an opportunity of curbing and affronting the King, prohi∣bited
every one from furnishing vessels for that service.
And thus the project, formed by Charles, of freeing the
country from these men, was unfortunately disappointed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. i. p. 281. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 381. Dugdale, p. 75. May, book ii. p. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE old Irish catholics remarked all these false steps
of the English, and resolved to take advantage of them.
Though their animosity against that nation, for want of an
occasion to exert itself, seemed to be extinguished, it was
only composed into a temporary and deceitful tranquillity<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 14.</NOTE>.
Their interests, both with regard to <HI>property</HI> and to <HI>reli∣gion,</HI>
secretly simulated them to a revolt. No individual
of any sept, according to the antient customs, had the pro∣perty
of any particular estate; but as the Whole sept had
a title to a whole territory, they ignorantly preferred this
barbarous community before the more secure and narrower
possessions assigned them by the English. An indulgence,
amounting almost to a toleration, had been given the catho∣lic
religion: But so long as the churches and the ecclesiasti∣cal
revenues were kept from the priests, and they were
obliged to endure the neighbourhood of profane heretics,
being themselves discontented, they endeavoured continually
to retard any cordial reconcilement between the English and
the Irish nations.</P>
<P>THERE was a gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspiracy in Ireland.</NOTE> called Roger More, who,
though of a narrow fortune, was descended from a very
antient Irish family, and was much celebrated among his
countrymen for valour and capacity. This man first formed
the project of expelling the English, and assterting the inde∣pendency
of his native country<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nalson vol. ii. p. 543.</NOTE>. He secretly went from
chieftain to chieftain, and rouzed up every latent principle
of discontent. He maintained a close correspondence with
Lord Maguire and Sir Phelim O Neale, the most powerful of
<PB N="369" REF="429"/>
the old Irish. By conversation, by letters, by his emissaries,
he represented to his countrymen the motives of a revolt.
He observed to them, That, by the rebellion of the Scots,
and factions of the English, the King's authority in Britain
was reduced to so low a condition, that he never could ex∣ert
himself with any vigour, in maintaining the English do∣minion
over Ireland; that the catholics, in the Irish house
of commons, assisted by the protestants, had so diminished
the royal prerogative and the power of the lieutenant, as
would much facilitate the conducting, to its desired effect,
any conspiracy or combination, which could be formed;
that the Scots, having so successfully thrown off dependance
on the crown of England, and assumed the government into
their own hands, and set an example to the Irish, who had
so much greater oppressions to complain of; that the English
planters, who had expelled them their possessions, suppressed
their religion, and bereaved them of their liberties, were
but a handful in comparison of the natives; that they lived
in the most supine security, interspersed. with their numerous
enemies, trusting to the protection of a small army, which
was itself scattered in inconsiderable divisions throughout
the whole kingdom; that a great body of men, disciplined
by the government, were now thrown loose, and were
ready for any daring or desperate enterprize; that though
the catholics had hitherto enjoyed, in some tolerable mea∣sure,
the exercise of their religion, from the moderation of
their indulgent prince, they must henceforth expect, that
the government will be conducted by other maxims and
other principles; that the puritanical parliament, having at
last subdued their sovereign, would, no doubt, so soon as
they had consolidated their authority, extend their ambi∣tious
enterprizes to Ireland, and make the catholics in that
kingdom feel the same furious persecution, to which their
brethren in England were at present exposed; and that a
revolt in the Irish, tending only to vindicate their native
liberty against the violence of foreign invaders, could never,
<PB N="370" REF="430"/>
at any time, be deemed rebellion; much less, during the
the present confusions, when their Prince was, in a man∣ner,
a prisoner, and obedience must be paid, not to him,
but to those who had traiterously usurped his lawful au∣thority<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Temple, p 72, 73, 78. Dugdale, P. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY these considerations, More engaged all the heads of
the native Irish into the conspiracy. The English of the
pale, as they were called, or the old English planters, being
all catholics, it was hoped, would afterwards join the party,
which restored their religion to its antient splendor and au∣thority.
The intention was, that Sir Phelim Oneale, and the
other conspirators, should begin an insurrection on one day,
throughout the provinces, and should attack all the English
settlements; and that, on the very same day, Lord Maguire
and Roger More should surprize the castle of Dublin. The
commencement of this revolt they fixed on the approach of
winter; that there might be more difficulty in transporting
forces from England. Succours to themselves and supplies
of arms they expected from France, in consequence of a
promise made them by Cardinal Richelieu. And many Irish
officers, who served in the Spanish troops, had given assu∣rances
of their concurrence, so soon as they saw an insur∣rection
entered upon by their catholic brethren. News,
which every day arrived from England, of the fury
expressed by the commons against all papists, struck fresh
terror into the Irish nation, and both stimulated the con∣spirators
to execute their fatal purpose, and gave them assured
hopes of the concurrence of their countrymen<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 74.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH propensity to a revolt was discovered in all
the Irish, that it was deemed unnecessary, as it was dangerous,
to entrust the secret to many hands; and the appointed day
drew nigh, nor had any discovery been yet made to the go∣vernment.
The King, indeed, had received information
from his ambassadors, that something was in agitation
<PB N="371" REF="431"/>
among the Irish in foreign parts; but though he gave warn∣ing
to the administration in Ireland, the intelligence was in∣tirely
neglected<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 408. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 565.</NOTE>. Secret rumours, likewise, were heard
of some approaching conspiracy; but no attention was paid
to them. The Earl of Leicester, whom the King had ap∣pointed
lieutenant, remained in London. The two justices;
Sir William Parsons and Sir John Borlace, were men of
small ability, and, by an inconvenience common to all fac∣tious
times, owed their advancement to nothing but their
zeal for that party, by whom every thing was now govern∣ed.
Tranquil from their ignorance and inexperience, these
men indulged themselves in the most profound repose, on
the very brink of destruction.</P>
<P>BUT they were awakened from their security, the very
day before that appointed for the commencement of hostilities.
The castle of Dublin, by which the capital was
commanded, contained arms for 10,000 men, with thirty∣five
pieces of cannon, and a proportionable quantity of
ammunition: Yet was this important place guarded, and
that too without any care, by no greater force than fifty
men. Maguire and More were already in town with a
numerous band of their retainers: Others were expected
that night: And, next morning, they were to enter upon,
what they esteemed the easiest of all enterprizes, the fur∣prizal
of the castle. Oconolly, an Irishman, but a pro∣testant,
betrayed the secret to Parsons<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rush vol. v. p. 399. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 520. May, book ii. p. 6.</NOTE>. The justices and
council, for safety, fled immediately into the castle; and
re-inforced the guards. The alarm was conveyed to the
city, and all the protestant prepared for defence. More
escaped Maguire was taken; and Mahone, one of the
conspirators, being likewise seized, first discovered, to the
justices, the project of a general insurrection, and redoubled
<PB N="372" REF="432"/>
the apprehendsions<NOTE PLACE="marg">Irish insurrection and massacre.</NOTE>, which were already universally diffused
throughout Dublin<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 17, 18, 19, 20. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 400.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though Oconolly's discovery saved the castle from a
surprize, the confession, extorted from Mahone, came too
late to prevent the intended insurrection. Oneale and his
confederates had already taken arms in Ulster. The Irish,
every where intermingled with the English, needed but a
hint from their leaders and priests to begin hostilities against
a people, whom they hated on account of their religion,
and envied for their riches and prosperity<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 39, 40, 79.</NOTE>. The houses,
cattle, goods, of the unwary English were first seized.
Those, who heard of the commotions in their neighbour∣hood,
instead of deserting their habitations, and flocking
together for mutual protection, remained at home, in hopes
of defending their property; and fell thus separately into
the hands of their enemies<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 42.</NOTE>. After rapacity had fully
exerted itself, cruelty, and the most barbarous, that ever,
in any nation, was known or heard of, began its operations.
An universal massacre commenced of the English, now de∣fenceless,
and passively resigned to their inhuman foes. No
age, no sex, no condition, was spared. The wife weeping
for her butchered husband, and embracing her helpless
children, was pierced with them, and perished by the same
stroke<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 40.</NOTE>. The old, the young, the vigorous, the infirm,
underwent a like fate, and were confounded in one com∣mon
ruin. In vain did slight save from the first assault:
Destruction was, every where, let loose, and met the hunted
victims at every turn. In vain was recourse had to relations,
to companions, to friends: All connexions were dissolved,
and death was dealt by that hand, from which protection
was implored and expected. Without provocation, with∣out
opposition, the astonished English, living in profound
peace and full security, were massacred by their nearest
<PB N="373" REF="433"/>
neighbours, with whom they had long upheld a continued
intercourse of kindness and good offices<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 39, 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT death was the lightest punishment, inflicted by
those more than barbarous savages: All the tortures, which
wanton cruelty could devise, all the lingering pains of body,
the anguish of mind, the agonies of despair, could not sa∣tiate
revenge excited without injury, and cruelty derived
from no cause. To enter into particulars would shock the
least delicate humanity. Such enormities, though attested
by undoubted evidence, appear almost incredible. De∣praved
nature, even perverted religion, though encouraged
by the utmost licence, reach not to such a pitch of ferocity;
unless the pity, inherent in human breasts, be destroyed by
that contagion of example, which transports men beyond
all the usual motives of conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P>THE weaker sex themselves, naturally tender to their
own sufferings, and compassionate to those of others, here
emulated their more robust companions, in the practice of
every cruelty<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 96, 101. Rush. vol. v. p. 415.</NOTE>. Even children, taught by the example,
and encouraged by the exhortation, of their parents, essayed
their feeble blows on the dead carcasses or defenceless
children of the English<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 100.</NOTE>. The very avarice of the Irish
was not a sufficient restraint to their cruelty. Such was
their frenzy, that the cattle, which they had seized, and by
rapine had made their own, yet, because they bore the
name of English, were wantonly slaughtered, or, when
covered with wounds, turned loose into the woods and
desarts<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 84.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE stately buildings or commodious habitations of the
planters, as if upbraiding the sloth and ignorance of the
natives, were consumed with fire, or laid level with the
ground. And where the miserable owners, shut up
in their houses, and preparing for defence, perished in
<PB N="374" REF="434"/>
the flames, together with their wives and children, a double
triumph was afforded to these insulting butchers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 99, 106. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 414.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF any where a number assembled together, and, assuming
courage from despair, were resolved to sweeten death by a
revenge of their assassins; they were disarmed by capitu∣lations,
and promises of safety, confirmed by the most so∣lemn
oaths. But no sooner had they surrendered, than the
rebels, with perfidy equal to their cruelty, made them share
the fate of their unhappy countrymen<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 47. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 416.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OTHERS, more ingenious still in their barbarity, tempted
their prisoners, by the fond love of life, to embrue their
hands in the blood of friends, brothers, parents; and
having thus rendered them accomplices in guilt, gave them
that death, which they sought to shun by deserving it<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 100.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST all these enormities, the sacred name of RELI∣GION
resounded on every side; not to stop the hands of
these savages, but to enforce their blows, and to steel their
hearts against every movement of human or social sympa∣thy.
The English, as heretics, abhorred of God, and de∣testable
to all holy men, were marked out by the priests for
slaughter; and, of all actions, to rid the world of these
declared enemies to catholic faith and piety was represented
as the most meritorious<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 852 105.</NOTE>. Nature, which, in that rude
people, was sufficiently inclined to atrocious deeds, was far∣ther
stimulated by precept; and national prejudices em∣poisoned
by those aversions, more deadly and incurable,
Which arose from an enraged superstition. While death
finished. the sufferings of each victim, the bigotted assassins,
with joy and exaltation, still echoed in his expiring ears,
that these agonies were but the commencement of torments,
Infinite and eternal<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 94, 107, 108. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 407.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="435"/>
SUCH were the barbarities, by which Sir Phelim Oneale
and the Irish in Ulster signalized their rebellion: An event,
memorable in the annals of human kind, and worthy to be
held in perpetual detestation and abhorrence. The generous
nature of More was shocked at the recital of such enormous
cruelties. He flew to Oneale's camp; but found, that his
authority, which was sufficient to excite the Irish to an in∣surrection,
was too feeble to restrain their inhumanity.
Soon after, he abandoned a cause, polluted with so many
crimes; and he retired into Flanders. Sir Phelim, recom∣mended
by the greatness of his family, and perhaps too,
by the unrestrained brutality of his nature; though without
any courage or capacity, acquired the intire ascendant over the northern rebels<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 44.</NOTE>. The English colonies were totally
annihilated in the open country of Ulster: The Scots, at
first met with more favourable treatment. In order to
engage them to a passive neutrality, the Irish pretended to
distinguish between the British nations; and claiming friendship
and consanguinity with the Scots, extended not over
them the fury of their massacres. Many of them found an
opportunity to fly the country: Others retired into places
of security, and prepared themselves for defence: And by
this means, the Scots planters, most of them at least,
escaped with their lives<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 41. Rush, vol. i. p. 416.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM Ulster, the flames of rebellion diffused themselves,
in an instant, over the other three provinces of Ireland. In
all places, death and slaughter were not uncommons; tho'
the Irish, in these other provinces, pretended to act with
more moderation and humanity. But cruel and barbarous
was their humanity! Not contented with expelling the
English their houses, with despoiling them of their goodly
manors, with wasting their cultivated fields; they stripped
them of their very cloaths, and turned them out naked and
<PB N="376" REF="436"/>
defenceless, to all the severities of the season<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 42.</NOTE>. The
heavens themselves, as if conspiring against that unhappy
people, were armed with cold and tempest, unusual to the
climate, and executed what the merciless sword of the bar∣barians
had left unfinished<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 64.</NOTE>. The roads were covered with
crowds of naked English, hastening towards Dublin and the
other cities, which yet remained in the hands of their
countrymen. The feeble age of children, the tender sex of
women, soon sunk under the multiplied rigours of cold and
hunger. Here, the husband, bidding a final adieu to his
expiring family, envied them that fate, which he himself
expected so soon to share: There, the son, having long sup∣ported
his aged parent, with reluctance obeyed his last com∣mands,
and abandoning him in 'this uttermost distress, re∣served
himself to the hopes of avenging that death, which
all his efforts could not prevent nor delay. The astonishing
greatness of the calamity deprived the sufferers of any relief
from the view of companions in affliction. With silent
tears, or lamentable cries, they hurried on through the
hostile territories; and sound every heart, which was not
steel'd by native barbarity, guarded by the more implaca∣ble
furies of mistaken piety and religion<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 88.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE saving of Dublin preserved in Ireland the remains
of the English name. The gates of that city, though ti∣morously
opened, received the wretched supplicants, and
discovered to the view a scene of human misery, beyond
what any eye had ever before beheld<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem, p. 62.</NOTE>. Compassion seized
the amazed inhabitants, aggravated with the. fear of like
calamities; while they observed the numerous foes, without
and within, which every where invironed them, and re∣flected
on the weak resources, by which they were them∣selves
supported. The more vigorous of the unhappy fu∣gitives,
to the number of three thousand, were inlisted into
three regiments: The rest were distributed into the houses;
<PB N="377" REF="437"/>
and all care was taken, by diet and warmth, to recruit their
feeble and torpid limbs. Diseases of unknown name and
species, derived from these multiplied distresses, seized ma∣ny
of them, and put a speedy period to their lives: Others,
having now leisure to reflect on their mighty loss of friends
and fortune, cursed that being which they had saved.
Abandoning themselves to despair, refusing all succour, they
expired; without other consolation, than that of receiving,
among their countrymen, the honours of a grave, which,
to their slaughtered companions, had been denied by the
inhuman barbarians<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 43, 62.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY some computations, those, who perished by all those
cruelties, are made to amount to an hundred and fifty, or
two hundred thousand: By the most moderate, and proba∣bly
the most reasonable account, they must have been near
forty thousand.</P>
<P>THE justices ordered to Dublin all the bodies of the
army, which were not surrounded by the rebels; and they
assembled a force of 1500 veterans. They soon inlisted,
and armed from the magazines above 4000 men more.
They dispatched a body of 600 men to throw relief into
Tredah, besieged by the Irish. But these troops, attacked
by the enemy, were seized with a panic, and were most of
them put to the sword. Their arms, falling into the hands
of the Irish, supplied them with what they most wanted<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 905.</NOTE>.
The justices afterwards thought of nothing more than the
providing for their own security and that of the capital.
The Earl of Ormond, their general, remonstrated against
such timid counsels; but was obliged to submit to au∣thority.</P>
<P>THE English of the pale, who probably were not, at first,
in the secret, pretended to. blame the insurreclion, and to
detest the barbarity, with which it was. Accompanied<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 33. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 402.</NOTE>. By
<PB N="378" REF="438"/>
their protestations and declarations, they engaged the justices
to supply them with arms, which they promised to employ
in desence of the government<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Temple, p. 60. Borlase His;t. p. 28.</NOTE>. But in a little time, the
interests of religion were found more prevalent over them
than regard and duty to their native country. They chose
Lord Gormanstone their leader; and, joining the old Irish,
rivaled them in every act of cruelty towards the English
protestants. Besides many smaller bodies, dispersed over
the whole kingdom, the principal army of the rebels
amounted to twenty thousand men, and threatened Dublin
with an immediate siege<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 49.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BOTH the English and Irish rebels conspired in one im∣posture,
with which they seduced many of their deluded
countrymen: They pretended authority from the King and
Queen, but chiefly from the latter, for their insurrection;
and they affirmed, that the cause of their taking arms, was
to vindicate royal prerogative, now invaded by the purita∣tanical
parliament<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. v. p. 400, 401.</NOTE>. Sir Phelim Oneale, having found a
royal patent in Lord Caufield's house, whom he had mur∣dered,
tore off the seal, and affixed to it a commission,
which he had forged for himself<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 402.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King received an account of this insurrection by a
messenger, dispatched from the north of Ireland. He im∣mediately
communicated his intelligence to the Scots par∣liament,
He expected, that the mighty zeal, expressed by
the Scots, for the protestant religion, would immediately
engage them to fly to its defence, where it was so violently
invaded: He hoped, that their horror against popery, a re∣ligion
which now appeared in its most horrible aspect,
would second all his exhortations: He had observed with
what alacrity they had twice run to arms, and assembled
troops in opposition to the rights of their sovereign: He
saw with how much greater facility they could now collect
<PB N="379" REF="439"/>
forces, which had been very lately disbanded, and which
had been so long enured to military discipline. The cries of
their affrighted and distress;ed brethren in Ireland, he pro∣mis;ed
himself, would powerfully incite them to send over
succours, which could arrive so quickly, and aid them with
such promptitude in this uttermos;t distress. But the zeal
of the Scots, as is usual among religious sects, was very
seeble, when not stimulated either by faction or by interest.
They now considered themselves intirely as a republic, and
made no account of the authority of their prince, which
they had utterly annihilated, Conceiving hopes from the
present dislress;es of Ireland, they resolved to make an ad∣vantageous
bargain for the succours, with which they
should supply their neighbouring nation. And they cas;t
their eye on the Englisli parliament, with whom they were
already so clos;ely connected, and who could alone fulfil any
articles which might be agreed on. Except dispatching a
small body to support the Scots colonies in Ulster, they
would, therefore, go no farther at present, than to send
commissioners to London, in order to treat with that power,
to whom the sovereign authority was now in reality trans∣ferred<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 407.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King too, sensible of his utter inability to subdue
the Irish rebels, found himself obliged, in this exigency, to
have recourse to the English parliament, and depend on
their assistance for supply. After communicating to them
the intelligence which he had received, he informed them,
that the insurreclion was not, in his opinion, the result of
any rash enterprize, but of a formed conspiracy against the
crown of England. To their care and wisdom, therefore,
he said, he committed the conduct and prosecution of the
war, which, in a cause so important to national and reli∣gious
interests, must. of necessity be immediately entered upon, and vigorously pursued<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="380" REF="440"/>
THE English parliament was now assembled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meeting of the English parliament.</NOTE> and disco∣vered,
in every vote, the same dispositions in which they
had separated. The exalting their own authority, the di∣minishing
the King's, were still the objects pursued by the
majority. Every attempt, which had been made to gain
the popular leaders, and by offices to attach them to the
crown, had failed of success, either for want of skill in
conducting it, or by reason of the slender preferments which
it was then in the King's power to confer. The ambitious
and enterprising patriots disdained to accept, in detail, of a
precarious power; while they esteemed it so easy, by one bold
and vigorous assault, to possess themselves for ever of the in∣tire
sovereignty of the state. Sensible that the measures which
they had hitherto pursued, rendered them extremely ob∣noxious
to the King; were many of them in themselves ex∣ceptionable;
some of them, strictly speaking, illegal; theyre∣solved
to seek their own security, as well as greatness, by enlarg∣ing
popular authority in England. The great necessities to
which the King was reduced; the violent prejudices which
generally, throughout the nation, prevailed against him;
his facility in making the most important concessions; the
example of the Scots, whose encroachments had totally
subverted monarchy: All these circumstances farther insti∣gated
the commons in their invasion of royal prerogative.
And the danger, to which the conslitution seemed to have
been so lately exposed, persuaded many, that it never could
be sufficiently secured, but by the intire abolition of that
authority which had invaded it.</P>
<P>BUT this project, it had not been in the power, scarce
in the intention, of the popular leaders to execute, had it
not been for the passion which seized the nation for presby∣terian
discipline, and for the wild enthusiasm which at that
time accompanied it. The licence which the parliament
had bestowed on this spirit, by checking ecclesiastic autho∣rity;
the countenance and encouragement with which they
had honoured it; had alrealy diffused its influence to a won∣derful
<PB N="381" REF="441"/>
degree: And all orders of men had drunk deep of
the intoxicating poison. In each discourse or conversation,
this mode of religion entered; in all businss, it had a share;
every elegant pleasure or amusement, it utterly annihilated;
many vices or corruptions of mind, it promoted; even dis∣eases
and bodily distempers were not totally exempted from
it; and it became requisite, we are told, for all physicians
to be expert in the spiritual profession, and, by theological
considerations, to allay those religious terrors with which
their patients were so generally haunted. Learning itself,
which tends so much to enlarge the mind, and humanize the
temper, rather served on this occasion to exalt that epi∣demical
frenzy which prevailed. Rude as yet, and imper∣fect,
it supplied the dismal fanaticism with a variety of
views, founded it on some coherency of system, enriched
it with different figures of elocution; advantages with which
a people, totally ignorant and barbarous, had been happily
unacquainted.</P>
<P>FROM policy, at first, and inclination, now from necessity,
the King attached himself extremely to the hierarchy:
For like reasons, his enemies made account, by one and
the same effort, to overpower the church and monarchy.</P>
<P>WHILE the commons were in this disposition, the Irish
rebellion was the event which tended most to promote the
views in which all their measures terminated. A horror
against the papists, however innocent, they had constantly
encouraged; a terro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against the conspiracies of that sect,
however improbable, they had at all times endeavoured to
excite. Here was broke out a rebellion, dreadful and un∣expected;
accompanied with circumstances the most detest∣able,
of which there ever was any record: And what was
the peculiar guilt of the Irish catholics, it was no difficult
matter, in the present disposion of men's minds, to at∣tribute
to that whole sect, who already were so much the
object of general abhorrence. Accustomed, in all invec∣tives,
<PB N="382" REF="442"/>
to join the prelatical party with the papist, the people
immediately supposed this insurrection to be the resuit of
their united counsels. And when they heard that the Irish
rebels pleaded the King's commission for all their violences;
bigotry, ever credulous and malignant, assented without
scruple to that gross imposture, and loaded the unhappy
prince with the whole enormity of a contrivance so barba∣rous
and inhuman<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is now so universally allowed, notwithstanding some muttering to the contrary, that the King had no hand in the Irish rebellion, that it will be superfluous to insist on a point which scems so clear. I shall only suggest a very few arguments, among an infinite number which occur. (1) Ought the affirmation of persidious, infamous rebels ever to have passed for any autho∣rity? (2) Nobody can tell us what the words of the pretended commission were. That commission which we find in Rushworth, vol. v. p. 400, and in Milton's works, Toland's edition, is plainly an imposture; because it pre∣tends to be dated in October 1641, yet mentions facts which happened not till some months after. It appears that the Irish rebels, observing some inconsistence in their first forgery, were obliged to forge this commission anew, yet could not render it coherent nor probable. (3) Nothing could more obvi∣ously be pernicious to the King's cause than the Irish rebellion; because it increased his neccssities, and rendered him still more dependent on the parlia∣ment, who had before sufficiently shown oil what terms they would assist him. (4) The instant the King heard of the rebellion which was a very few days after its commencement, he wrote to the parliament, and gave over to them the management of the war. Had he built any projects on that rebellion, would he not have waited some little time, to see how they would succeed? Would he presently have adopted, a measure which was obviously so hurtful to his authority? (5) What can be imagined to be the King's projects? To raise the Irish to arms, I suppose, and bring them over to England for his assistance. But is it not plain, that the King never intended to raise war in England? Had that been his intention, would he have rendered the parlia∣ment perpetual? Does it not appear, by the whole train of events, that the parliament forced him into the war? (6) The King conveyed to the justices intelligence which ought to have prevented the rebellion. (7) The Irish ca∣tholics, in all their future transactions with the King, where they endeavoar to excuse their insurrection, never had the assurance to plead his commission. Iven amongst themselves they dropped that pretext. It appears that Sir Phc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im Oneale, chiefly, and he only at first, prompted that imposture. See Carte's Ormond, vol. iii. No 100, 111, 112, 114, 115, 121, 132, 137. (8) Oneale himself confessed the imposture on his trial and at his execution. Sea Nalson, vol. ii, p. 528. (9) It is ridiculous to mention the justification which Charles II. gave to the Marquis of Antrim, as if he had acted by his father's commission. Antrim had no hand in the first rebellion and the massacre. He joined not the rebels till two years after, and he performed important services to the King, in sending over a body of men to Montrose.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="443"/>
BY the difficulties and distresses of the crown, the com∣mons,
who possessd alone the power of supply, had ag∣grandized
themselves; and it seemed a peculiar happiness,
that the Irish. rebellion had succeeded, at so critical a junc∣ture,
to the pacification of Scotland. That expression of
the King, by which he committed to them the care of Ire∣land,
they immediately laid hold of, and interpreted in the
most unlimited sense. They had, on other occasions, been
gradually encroaching on the executive power of the crown,
which forms its principal and most. natural branch of au∣thority;
but, with regard to Ireland, they at once assumed
it, fully and intirely, as if delivered over to them by a regu∣lar
gift or assignment. And to this usurpation the King
was obliged passively to submit; both because of his ina∣bility
to resist, and lest he should expose himself still more
to the reproach of favouring the progress of that odious
rebellion.</P>
<P>THE project of introducing farther innovations in Eng∣land
being once formed by the leaders among the commons,
it became a necessary consequence, that their operations with
regard to Ireland would, all of them, be considered as subordinate
to the former, on whose success, when once under∣taken,
their own grandeur, security, and even being, must
intirely depend. While they pretended the utmost zeal
against the Irish insurrection, they took no steps towards its
suppression, but such as likewise tended to give them the
superiority in those commotions, which they foresaw must
so soon be excited in England<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii p. 435, Sir Ed, Walker, p. 6.</NOTE>. The extreme contempt
entertained towards the natives in Ireland, made the popular
leaders believe that it would be easy at any time to suppress
their rebellion, and recover that kingdom: Nor were they
<PB N="384" REF="444"/>
willing to lose, by too hasty success, the advantage which
that rebellion would afford them in their projected encroach∣ments
on the prerogative. By assuming the total manage∣ment
of the war, they acquired the courtship and depend∣ence
of every one who had any connexion with Ireland, or
who was desirous of inlisting in these military enterprizes:
They levied money under pretence of the Irish expedition;
but reserved it for purposes which concerned them more
nearly: They took arms from the King's magazines; but
still kept them, with? <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecret intention of employing them
against himself: Whatever law they deemed necessary for
aggrandizing themselv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was voted, under colour of en∣abling
them to recover Ireland; and if Charles with-held
the royal assent, his refusal was imputed to those pernicious
counsels which had a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excited the popish rebellion, and
which stiil threatened total destruction to the protestant
interest throughout all his dominions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 618. Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 590.</NOTE>. And though no
forces were for a long time sent over to Ireland, and very
little money remitted, during the extreme distress of that
kingdom; so strong was the people's attachment to the
commons, that the fault was never imputed to those pious
zealots, whose votes breathed nothing but death and de∣struction
to the Irish rebels.</P>
<P>To make the attack on royal authority by regular ap∣proaches,
it was thought proper to form a general remon∣strance
of the state of the kingdom; and accordingly the
committee, which, at the first meeting of the parliament,
had been chosen for that purpose, and which had hitherto
made no advance in their work, received fresh injunctions
to finish that undertaking.</P>
<P>THE committee brought into the house that remonstrance
which has become so memorable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The remon∣strance.</NOTE> and which was soon after∣wards
attended with such important consequences. It was
<PB N="385" REF="445"/>
not addressed to the King; but was openly declared to be
an appeal to the people. The harshness of the matter was
equalled by the severity of the language.
It consists
of many gross falshoods, intermingled with some evident
truths: Malignant insinuations are joined to open invec∣tives:
Loud complaints of the past, accompanied with
jealous prognostications of the future. Whatever un∣fortunate,
whatever invidious, whatever suspicious mea∣sure,
had been embraced by the King from the commence∣ment
of his reign, is insisted on and aggravated with merci∣less
rhetoric: The unsuccessful expedition to Cadiz and the
isle of Rh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are mentioned: The sending ships to France for
suppression of the hugonots: The forced loans: The ille∣gal
confinement of men for not obeying illegal commands.
The violent dissoludon of four parliaments: The arbitrary
government which always succeeded: The questioning,
fining, and imprisoning members for their conduct in the
house: The levying taxes without content of the commons.
The introducing superslitious innovations into the church,
without authority of law: In short, every thing, which,
either with or without reason, had given offence, during
the course of fifteen years, from the accession of the King
to the calling of the present parliament. And, though all
these grievances had been already redressed, and even laws
enacted for future security against their return, the praise of
all these advantages was ascribed, not to the King, but to the
parliament, who had extorted his consent to such salutary
slatutes. Their own merits too, they asserted, towards the
King, were equally great, as towards the people. Though
they had seized his whole revenue, rendered it totally preca∣rious,
and made even their temporary supplies be paid in to
their own commisioners, who were independent of him;
they pretended, that they had very liberally supported him
in his necessities. By an insult still more egregious, the
very giving money to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for levying war against
their sovereign, they represented as an instance of their duty
<PB N="386" REF="446"/>
towards him. And all their grievances, they said, which
amounted to no less than a total subversion of the constitu∣tion,
proceeded intirely from the formed combination of a
popish faction, who had ever swayed the king's counsels,
who had endeavoured, by an uninterrupted effort, to intro∣duce
their superstition into England and Scotland, and who
had now, at last, excited an open and bloody rebellion in
Ireland<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 438. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 694.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS remonstrance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Nov.</NOTE> so full of acrimony and violence,
was a plain signal for some farther attacks intended on royal
prerogative, and a declaration, that the concessions, already
made, however important, were not to be regarded as sa∣tisfactory.
What pretensions would be advanced, how un∣precedented,
how unlimited, were easily imagined; and
nothing less was soreseen, whatever ancient names might be
preserved, than an abolition, almost total, of the monar∣chical
government of England. The opposition, therefore,
which the remonstrance met with in the house of commons,
was very great. For above fourteen hours, the debate was
warmly managed; and from the weariness of the King's
party, which probably consisted chiefly of the elderly peo∣ple,
and men of cool spirits, the vote was at last carried by
a small majority of eleven<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 49 Dugdale, p. 71. Nalson, ubi sup. p. 668.</NOTE>. Some time after, the remon∣strance
was ordered to be printed and published, without
being carried up, as is usual in such cases, to the house of
peers, for their assent and approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN this remonstrance was dispersed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons on both sides.</NOTE> it excited every∣where
the same violent controversy which attended it when
introduced into the house of commons. This parliament,
said the partizans of that assembly, have at last prosited by
the fatal example of their predecessors; and are resolved
that the fabric, which they have generously undertaken to
rear for the protection of liberty, shall not be left to future
<PB N="387" REF="447"/>
ages insecure and imperfect. At the time when the petition
of right, that requisite vindication of a violated constitu∣tion,
was extorted from the unwilling prince; who but
ima∣gined, that liberty was at last secured, and that the laws
would thenceforth maintain themselves in opposition to arbi∣trary
authority? But what was the event? A <HI>right</HI> was in∣deed
acquired to the people, or rather their antient right
was more exactly defined: But as the <HI>power</HI> of invading it
still remained in the prince, no sooner did an opportunity
offer, than he totally disregarded all laws and preceding en∣gagements,
and made his will and pleasure the sole rule of
government. Those lofty ideas of monarchical government,
which he had derived from his early education, which are
united in his mind with the irresistible illusions of self-love,
which are corroborated by his mistaken principles of reli∣gion,
it is in vain to hope, that, in his more advanced age,
he will sincerely renounce, from any subsequent reflection or
experience. Such conversions, if ever they happen, are ex∣tremely
rare; but to expect that they will be derived from
necessity, from the jealousy and resentment of antagonists,
from blame, from reproach, from opposition, must be
the result of the fondest and most blind credulity. These vio∣lences,
however necessary, are sure to irritate a prince against
limitations so cruelly imposed upon him; and each conces∣sion,
which he is inforced to make, is regarded as a tem∣porary
tribute paid to faction and sedition, and is secretly
attended with a resolution of seizing every favourable oppor∣tunity
to retract it. Nor should we imagine, that oppor∣tunities
of that kind will not offer in the course of human
affairs. Governments, especially those of a mixed kind,
are in continual fluctuation: The humours of the people
change perpetually from one extreme to another: And no
resolution can be more wife, as well as more just, than that
of employing the present advantages against the King, who
had formerly pushed much less tempting ones to the ut∣most
extremity against his people and his parliament. It
<PB N="388" REF="448"/>
is to be feared, that if the religious rage, which has seized
the multitude, be allowed to evaporate, they will quickly
return to the antient ecclesiastical establishment; and em∣brace,
with it, those principles of slavery which it incul∣cates
with such zeal on its submissive proselytes. Those pa∣triots,
who are now the public idols, may then become the
objects of general detestation; and equal shouts of joy at∣tend
their ignominious execution, with those which second
their present advantages and triumphs. Nor ought the ap∣prehension
of such an event to be regarded in them as a
selfish consideration: In their safety is involved the security
of the laws: The patrons of the constitution cannot suffer
without a fatal blow to the constitution: And it is but jus∣tice
in the public to protect, at any hazard, those who have
so generously exposed themselves to the utmost hazard for
the public interest. What though monarchy, the antient
government of England, be impaired, during these con∣tests,
in many of its former prerogatives: The laws will
flourish the more by its decay; and it is happy, allowing
that matters are really carried beyond the bounds of mode∣ration,
that the current at least runs towards liberty, and
that the error is on that side which is safest for the general
interests of mankind and society.</P>
<P>THE best arguments of the royalists against a farther in∣vasion
of the prerogative, were founded more on opposite
ideas which they had formed of the past events of this
reign, than on opposite principles of government. Some
invasions, they said, and those too of no small consequence
had undoubtedly been made on national privileges: But
were we to look for the cause of these violences, we should
never find it to consist in the wanton tyranny and injustice
of the prince, not even in his ambition or immoderate ap∣petite
for authority. The hostilities with Spain, in which
the King, on his accession, found himself engaged, how∣ever
imprudent and unnecessary, had proceeded from the
advice, and even importunity of the parliament,; who de∣serted
<PB N="389" REF="449"/>
him immediately after they had embarked, him in
those warlike measures. A young prince, jealous of ho∣nour,
was naturally afraid of being foiled in his first enter∣prize,
and had not as yet attained such maturity of counsel,
as to perceive that his greatest honour lay in preserving the
laws inviolate, and gaining the intire confidence of his
people. The rigour of the subsequent parliaments had been
extreme with regard to many articles, particularly tonnage
and poundage; and had reduced the King to an absolute
necessity, if he would preserve intire the royal prerogative,
of levying those duties by his own authority, and of break∣ing
through the forms, in order to maintain the spirit of
the constitution. Having once made so perilous a step, he
was naturally induced to continue, and to consult the public
interest, by imposing ship-money, and other moderate, tho'
irregular, burthens and taxations. It is now full time to
free him from all these necessities, and to apply cordials and
lenitives, after those severities which have already had their, full
course against him. Never sovereign was blessed with more
moderation of temper, with more justice, more humanity,
more honour, or a more magnanimous disposition. What
pity that such a prince should so long have been harrassed
with rigours, suspicions, calumnies, complaints, encroach∣ments;
and been forced from that path, in which the recti∣tude
of his disposition would have inclined him to have
constantly trod! If some few instances are found of viola∣tions
made on the petition of right, which he himself had
granted; there is an easier and more natural way for pre∣venting
the return of like inconveniences, than by a total
abolition of royal authority. Let the revenue be settled,
suitable to the antient dignity and splendor of the crown;
let the public necessities be fully supplied; let the remaining
articles of prerogative be left untouched: And the King, as
he has already lost the power, will lay aside the will, of in∣vading
the constitution. From what quarter can jealousies
<PB N="390" REF="450"/>
now aris? What farthersecurity can be desired or ex∣pected?
The King's precedent concessions, so far from. be∣ing
insussicient for public security, have rather erred on the
other extreme; and, by depriving him of all power of self∣defence,
are the real cause why the commons are embold∣ened
to raise pretensions hitherto unheard of in the king∣dom,
and to subvert the whole, system of the constitution.
But would they be contented with moderate advantages, is
it not evident, that, besides other important concessions,
the present parliament may be continued till the government
is accustomed to the new track, and every part is restored
to full harmony and concord? By the triennial act, a per∣petual
succession of parliaments is established, as everlasting
guardians to the laws; while the king possesses no independ∣ent
power or military force, by which he can be supported
in his invasion of them. No danger remains, but what is
inseparable from all free constitutions, and what forms the
very essence of their liberty: The danger of a change in
the people's disposition, and of general disgust, contracted
against popular privileges. To prevent such an evil, no
expedient is more proper, than to contain ourselves within
the bounds of moderation, and to consider, that all ex∣tremes,
naturally and infallibly, beget each other. In the
same manner as the past usurpations of the crown, however
excusable on account of the necessity or provocations from
whence they arose, have excited an immeasurable appetite
for liberty; let us beware, left our encroachments, by in∣troducing
anarchy, make the people seek shelter under the
peaceable and despotic rule of a monarch. Authority, as
well as liberty, is requisite to government; and is even re∣quisite
to the support of liberty itself, by maintaining the
laws which can alone regulate and protect it. What mad∣ness,
while every thing is so happily settled under antient
forms and institutions, now more exactly poised and adjusted,
to try the hazardous experiment of a new constitution, and
<PB N="391" REF="451"/>
renounce the mature wisdom of our ancestors for the crude
whimsies of turbulent innovators! Besides the certain and
inconceivable mischiess of civil war; are not the perils ap∣parent,
which the delicate frame of liberty musf inevitably
run amidst the furious shock of arms? Whichever side pre∣vails,
<HI>she</HI> can scarce hope to remain inviolate, and may suf∣fer
no less or rather greater injuries from the boundless pre∣tensions
of forces engaged in her cause, than from the in∣vasion
of inraged troops, inlisted on the side of monarchy.</P>
<P>THE King, upon his return from Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 25</NOTE> was received
in London with the shouts and acclamation: of the people,
and with every demonstration of regard and affection<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 429.</NOTE> Sir Richard Gournay, lord mayor, a man of merit and au∣thority,
had promoted these, savourable dispositions, and had
engaged the populace, who so lately insulted the King, and
who so soon afterwards made furious war upon him, to give
him these marks of the most dutiful attachment. But all
the pleasiure which he reaped from this joyful reception was
soon damped by the remonstrance of the commons, which
was presented him; together with a petition of a like strain.
The had counsels which he followed, are there complained
of; his concurrence in the Irish rebellion plainly insinuated;
the scheme, laid for the introduction of popery and super∣stition,
inveighed against; and, for a remedy to all these
evils, he is desired to intrust every office and command to
persons in whom his parliament should have cause to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
side<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Idem Ib. p. 437. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 692.</NOTE> SBy this phrase, which is so often repeated in all
the memorials and addresses of that time, the commons meant
themselves and their adherents.</P>
<P>As soon as the remonstrance of the commons was pub∣lished,
the King dispersed an answer to it. In this contest,
he lay under mighty disadvantages. Not only the ears of
the people were extremely prejudiced against him; the best
<PB N="392" REF="452"/>
topics upon which he could justify, or at least apologize for
his former conduct, were such as it was not safe nor prudent
for him at this time to employ. So high was the national
idolatry towards parliaments, that to blame the past conduct
of these assemblies, had been very ill received by the gene∣rality
of the people: So loud were the complaints against
regal usurpations, that had the King asserted the preroga∣tive
of supplying, by his own authority, the desiciencies in
government, arising from the obstivacy of parliaments, he
would have increased the clamours with which the whole
nation already resounded. Charles, therefore, contented
himself with observing, in general, that even during that
period, so much complained of, the people enjoyed a great
measure of happiness, not only comparatively, in respect of
their neighbours, but even in respect of those times which
were justly accounted the most fortunate. He made warm
protestations of sincerity in the reformed religion; he pro∣mised
indulgence to tender consciences with regard to the
ceremonies of the church; he mentioned his great conces∣sions
to national liberty; he blamed the infamous libels
every-where dispersed against his person and the national
religion; he complained of the general reproaches thrown
out in the remonstrance, with regard to ill counsels, though
he had protected no minister from parliamentary justice,
retained no unpopular servant, and conferred offices on no
one who enjoyed not a high character and estimation in the
public. “If, notwithstanding this,” he adds, “any ma∣lignant
party shall take heart, and be willing to sacrifice
the peace and happiness of their country to their own
smister ends and ambition, under whatever pretence of
religion and conscience; if they shall endeavour to lessen
my reputation and interest, and to weaken my lawful
power and authority; if they shall attempt, by discoun∣tenancing
the present laws, to loosen the bands of go∣vernment,
that all disorder and confusion may break in
upon us; doubt not but God, in his good time, will
<PB N="393" REF="453"/>
discover them to me, and that the wisdom and courage of
my high court of parliament will join with me in their
suppression and punishment<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 748.</NOTE> Nothing shows more
evidently the hard situation in which Charles was placed,
than to observe, that he was obliged to confine himself
within the limits of civility towards subjects who had trans∣gressed
all bounds of regard, and even of good manners, in
their treatment of their sovereign.</P>
<P>THE first instance of those parliamentary encroachments
which Charles was now to look for, was, the bill for press∣ing
soldiers to the service of Ireland. This bill quickly
passed the lower house. In the preamble, the King's power
of pressing, a power exercised during all former times, was
declared illegal, and contrary to the liberty of the subject.
By a necessary consequence, the prerogative which
the crown had ever assumed, of obliging men to accept of any
branch of public service, was abolished and annihilated:
A prerogative, it must be owned, not very compatible with
a limited monarchy. In order to elude this law, the King
offered to raise 10,000 volunteers for the Irish service: But
the commons were afraid left such an army would be too
much at his disposal. Charles, still unwilling to submit to
so considerable a diminution of power, came to the house
of peers, and offered to pass the law without the preamble;
by which means, he said, that ill-timed question with re∣gard
to the prerogative would for the present be avoided,
and the pretensions of each party be left intire. Both
houses took fire at this precipitant measure, which, from a
similar instance, while the bill of attainder against Stras∣ford
was in dependence, Charles might foresee, would be
received with resentment. The lords, as well as commons,
passed a vote, declaring it to be a high breach of privilege
for the King to take notice of any bill which was in agita∣tion
<PB N="394" REF="454"/>
in either of the houses, or to express his sentiments
with regard to it, before it be presented to him for his
assent in a parliamentary manner. The King was obliged
to compose all matters by an apology.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 458. &amp;c. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 327 Nalson, vol. ii. 738, 750, &amp;c</NOTE></P>
<P>THE general question, we may observe, with regard to
privileges of parliament, has always been, and still conti∣nues,
one of the greatest mysteries of the English constitu∣tion;
and, in some respects, notwithstanding the accurate
genius of that government, these privileges are at present
as undetermined as were formerly the prerogatives of the
crown. Such privileges as are founded on long precedent
cannot be controverted: But tho' it were certain, that for∣mer
kings had not in any instance taken notice of bills lying
before the houses (which yet appears to have been very
usual); it follows not, merely from their never exerting
such a power, that they had renounced it, or never were
possessed of it. Such privileges also as are essential to all
free assemblies which deliberate, they may be allowed to
assume, whatever precedents may prevail: But though the
King's interposition, by an offer or advice, does in some de∣gree
over-awe or restrain liberty; it may be doubted, whe∣ther
it imposes such evident violence as to intitle the parlia∣ment,
without any other authority or concession, to claim
the privilege of excluding it. But this was the savourable
time for extending privileges; and had none more exorbit∣ant
or unreasonable been challenged, few bad consequences
had followed. The establishment of this rule, it is cer∣tain,
contributes to the order and regularity, as well as free∣dom,
of parliamentary proceedings.</P>
<P>THE interposition of peers in the election of commoners
was likewise about this time declared a breach of privilege;
and continues ever since to be condemned by votes of the
<PB N="395" REF="455"/>
commons, and universally practised throughout the na∣tion.</P>
<P>ENERY measure pursued by the commons, and, still more,
every attempt made by their partizans, was full of the most
inveterate hatred against the hierarchy, and showed a deter∣mined
resolution of subverting the whole ecclesiastical esla∣blishment.
Besides numberless vexations and persecutions
which the clergy underwent from the arbitrary power of
the lower house; the peers, while the King was in Scot∣land,
having passed an order for the observance of the laws
with regard to public worship, the commons assumed such
authority, that, by a vote alone of their house, they full∣pended
those laws, though enacted by the whole legisla∣ture:
And they particularly forbade bowing at the name of
JESUS; a practice which gave them the highest scandal,
and which was one of their capital objections against the
established religion<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 385, 356. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 482.</NOTE> They complained of the King's shill∣ing
five vacant sees, and considered it as an insult upon
them, that he should complete and strengthen an order
which they intended soon intirely to abolish<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nal∣son, vol. ii. p. 511.</NOTE> They had
accused thirteen bishops of high treason, for enacting ca∣nons
without consent of parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 359.</NOTE>, though, from the
foundation of the monarchy, no other method had ever
been practised: And they now insisted, that the peers,
upon this general accusation, should sequester those bishops
from their seats in parliament, and commit them to prison.
Their bill for taking. away the bishops votes had last winter
been rejected by the peers: But they again introduced the
same bill, though no prorogation had intervened; and they
endeavoured, by some minute alterations, to elude that rule
of parliament which opposed, them. And when they sent
up this bill to the lords, they made a demand, the moll ab∣surd
in the world, that the bishops, being all of them par∣ties,
<PB N="396" REF="456"/>
should be refused a vote with regard to that question<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 304.</NOTE>.
After the resolution was once formed by the commons, of
invading the established government of church and state, it
could not be expected that their proceedings, in such a vio∣lent
attempt, would thenceforth be altogether regular and
equitable: But it must be confessed, that, in their attacks
on the hierarchy, they still more openly transgressed all
bounds of moderation; as supposing, no doubt, that the
sacredness of the cause would sufficiently atone for employ∣ing
means the most irregular and unprecedented. This
principle, which prevails so much among zealots, never
displayed itself so openly as during the transactions of this
whole period.</P>
<P>BUT, notwithstanding all these efforts of the commons,
they could not expect the concurrence of the upper house,
either to this law, or to any other which they should introduce
for the farther limitation of royal authority. The
majority of the peers adhered to the King, and plainly fore∣saw
the depression of nobility, as a necessary consequence of
popular usurpations on the crown. The insolence, indeed,
of the commons, and their haughty treatment of the lords,
had already risen to a great height, and gave sufficient
warning of their future attempts upon that order. They
muttered somewhat of their regret, that they should be en∣forced
to save the kingdom alone, and that the house of
peers would have no part in the honour. Nay, they went
so far as openly to tell the lords, “That they themselves
were the representative body of the whole kingdom,
and that the peers were nothing but individuals, who
held their sears in a particular capacity: And therefore,
if their lerdships will not consent to the pass;ing acts “ne∣cessary
for the preservation of the people, the commons,
together with such of the lords as are more sensible of
<PB N="397" REF="457"/>
the danger, must join together, and represent the matter
to his Majesty<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii, p. 415.</NOTE>” So violent was the democratical, en∣thusiastic
spirit diffused throughout the nation, that a total
confusion of all ranks and orders was justly to be appre∣hended;
and the wonder was not, that the majority of the
nobles should seek shelter under the throne, but that any of
them should venture to desert it. But the tide of popu∣larity
seized many, and carried them wide of all the most esta∣blished
maxims of civil policy. Among the opponents of the
King are ranked the Earl of Northumberland, lord admiral,
a man of the first family and fortune, and endowed with
that dignified pride which so well became his rank and sta∣tion:
The Earl of Essex, who inherited all his father's po∣pularity,
and having, from his early youth, fought renown
in arms, united to a middling capacity that rigid inflexibility
of honour which forms the proper ornament of a nobleman
and a soldier: The Lord Kimbolton, soon after Earl of
Manchester, a person distinguished by humanity, generosity,
affability, and every amiable virtue. These men, finding
that their credit ran very high with the nation, ventured to
encourage those popular disorders, which, they vainly ima∣gined,
they possessed authority sufficient to regulate and con∣troul.</P>
<P>IN order to maintain a majority in the upper house, the
commons had recourse to the populace, who, on other oc∣casions,
had done them such important services. Amidst
the greatest security, they affected continual fears of destruc∣tion
to themselves and the nation, and seemed to quake at
every breath or rumour of danger. They again excited
the people by never-ceasing inquiries after conspiracies, by
reports of insurrections, by feigned intelligence of invasions
from abroad, by discoveries of dangerous combinations at
borne among papists and their adherents. When Charles

dismissed the guard which they had ordered during his ab∣sence,
they complained; and, upon his promising them a
new guard, under the command of the Earl of Lindesey,
they absolutely refused the offer, and were well pleased to
insinuate, by this instance of jealousy, that their danger
chiefly arose from the King himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. 30th Nov. 1641. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 688.</NOTE>. They ordered hal∣berts
to be brought into the hair where they assembled, and
thus armed themselves against those conspiracies with which
they pretended they were hourly threatened. All stories of
plots, however ridiculous, were willingly attended to, and
were dispersed among the multitude, to whose capacity they
were well adapted. Beale, a taylor, informed the com∣mons,
that, walking in the fields, he had hearkened to the
discourse of certain persons, unknown to him, and had
heard them talk of a most dangerous conspiracy. A hundred
and eight ruffians, as he learned, had been appointed to
murder a hundred and eight lords and commoners, and were
promised rewards for these assassinations, ten pounds for
each lord, forty shillings for each commoner. Upon this
notable intelligence, orders were issued for seizing priests
and jesuits, a conference was desired with the lords, and the
deputy-lieutenants of some suspected counties were ordered
to put the people in a posture of defence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nalson, ibid, p. 646. Journ. 16th Nov. 1641, Dugdale, p. 77.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE pulpits likewise were called in aid, and resounded
With the dangers which threatened religion, from the de∣sperate
attempts of papists and malignants. Multitudes of
people flocked owards Westminster, and insulted the pre∣lates
and such of the lords as adhered to the crown. The

to the other house; but these refused their concurrence<NOTE PLACE="foot">‡Rush. part III. vol. i. p. 710.</NOTE>.

the commons<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 784, 792.</NOTE>. The sheriffs and justices having appointed
constables with strong watches to guard the parliament;
the commons sent for the constables, and required them to
discharge the watches, convened the justices, voted their
orders a breach of privilege, and sent one of them to the
Tower<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 792. Journ. 27, 28, and 29th of December 1641.</NOTE>. Encouraged by these indications of their plea∣sure,
the populace crouded about Whitehall, and threw out
insolent menaces against the King himself. Several reduced
officers and young gentlemen of the inns of court, during
this time of disorder and danger, offered then service to his
Majesty. Between them and the populace there passed fre∣quent
skirmishes, which ended not without bloodshed. By
way of reproach, these gentlemen gave the rabble the ap∣pellation
of ROUNDHEADS; on account of the short cropt
hair which they wore: These called the others CAVALIERS.
And thus the nation, which was before sufficiently provided
of religious as well as civil causes of quarrel, was also sup∣plied
with party-names, under which the factious might
rendezvous and signalize their mutual hatred<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while the tumults,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decem. 27.</NOTE> still continued, and even in∣creased,
abut Westminster and Whitehall. The cry conti∣nually
resounded against <HI>bishops and rotten-hearted lords</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 336.</NOTE>.
The former especially, being; easily distinguishable by their
habit, and being the object of violent hatred to all the
sectaries, were exposed to the mod dangerous insults<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 78.</NOTE>.
Williams, now Created archbishop of York, having been
abused by the populace, hastily called a meeting of his bre∣thren.
By his advice, a protestation was drawn and ad∣derssed
to the King and the house of lords. The bishops
there set forth, that, tho' they had an undoubted right to
fit and vote in parliament, yet, in coming thither, they had
been menaced, assaulted, affronted, by the unruly multi∣tude,
and could no longer with safety attend their duty in
<PB N="400" REF="464"/>
the house.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impeach∣ment of the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shops.</NOTE> For this reason they protested against all laws,
votes, and resolutions, as null and invalid, which should
pass during the time of their forced and violent absence.
This protestation, which, though just and legal, was cer∣tainly
very ill-timed, was signed by twelve bishops, and
communicated to the King, who hastily approved of it.
As soon as it was presented to the lords, that house desired
a conference with the commons, whom they informed of
this unexpected protestation. The opportunity was seized
with joy and triumph. An impeachment of high treason
was immediately sent up against the bishops, as endeavour∣ing
to subvert the fundamental laws, and to invalidate the
authority of the legislature<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 51. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 466. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 794.</NOTE>. They were, on the first de∣mand,
sequestred from parliament, and committed to cus∣tody.
No man, in either house, ventured to speak a word
in their vindication; so much displeased was every one at
the egregious imprudence of which they had been guilty.
One person alone said, that he did not believe them guilty
of high treason; but that they were stark mad, and there∣fore
desired they might be sent to bedlam<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 355.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FEW days afterwards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1624.</NOTE> the King was guilty of another
indiscretion, much more fatal: An indiscretion, to which all
the ensuing disorders and civil wars ought, immediately and
directly, to be ascribed. This was the impeachment of
Lord Kimbolton and the five members.</P>
<P>WHEN the commons employed, in their remonstrance,
language so severe and indecent, they had not been actuated
intirely by insolence and passion: Their views were much
more solid and profound. They considered, That, in a
violent attempt, such as an invasion of the antient constitu∣tion,
the more leisure was afforded the people to reflect, the
less would they be inclined to second that rash and danger∣ous,
enterprize; that the peers would certainly refuse their
<PB N="401" REF="465"/>
concurrence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1642.</NOTE> nor were there any hopes of prevailing on them
but by exciting the populace to tumult and disorder; that
the employing such odious means for so invidious an end
would, at long-run, lose them all their popularity, and turn
the tide of favour to the contrary party; and that, if the
King only remained in tranquillity, and cautiously eluded
the first violence of the tempest, he would, in the end,
certainly prevail, and be able at least to preserve intire the
antient laws and constitution. They were therefore resolved,
if possible, to excite him to some violent passion; in hopes
that he would commit indiscretions, of which they might
make advantage.</P>
<P>IT was not long before they succeeded beyond their fondest
wishes. Charles, enraged to find that all his concessions
but increased their demands; that the people, who were
returning to a sense of duty towards him, were again roused
to sedition and tumults; that the blackest calumnies were
propagated against him, and even the Irish massacre ascribed
to his counsels and machinations; that a method of adderss
was adopted, not only unsuitable towards so great a prince,
but which no private gentleman could bear without resent∣ment:
When he considered all these increasing insolences
in the commons, he was apt to ascribe them, in a great
measure, to his own indolence and facility. The Queen and
the ladies of the court farther stimulated his passion, and re∣presented,
that, if he exerted the vigour, and displayed
the majesty of a monarch, the daring usurpations of his
subjects would shrink before him. Lord Digby, a man of
fine parts, but full of levity, and hurried on by precipitant
passions, suggested like counsels; and Charles, who, tho'
commonly moderate in his temper, was ever disposed to
hasty resolutions, gave way to the fatal importunity of his
friends and servants<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 360.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="402" REF="466"/>
HERBERT, attorney-general, appeared in the house of
peers, and, in his Majesty's name, entered an accusation
of high treason against Lord Kimbolton and five com∣moners,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accusation of the five members.</NOTE> Hollis, Sir Arthur Hazlerig, Hambden, Pym, and
Strode. The articles were, That they had traiterously en∣deavoured
to subvert the fundamental laws and government
of the kingdom, to deprive the King of his regal power,
and to impose on his subjects an arbitrary and tyrannical
authority; that they had endeavoured, by many foul asper∣sions
on his Majesty and his government, to alienate the
affections of his people, and make him odious to them;
that they had attempted to draw his late army to disobedi∣ence
of his royal commands, and to side with them in their
traiterous designs; that they had invited and encouraged a
foreign power to invade the kingdom; that they had aimed
at subvertmg the rights and very being of parliaments; that,
in order to complete their traiterous designs, they had en∣deavoured,
as far as in them lay, by force and terror, to
compel the parliament to join with them, and, to that end,
had actually raised and countenanced tumults against the
King and parliament; and that they had traiterously cons∣pired
to levy, and actually had levied, war against the King<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 50. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 473. Nalson, vol. ii. p. 811. Franklyn, p. 906.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE whole world stood amazed at this important accusa∣tion,
so suddenly entered upon, without concert, deliberation,
or reflection. Some of these articles of accusation, men said,
to judge by appearance, seem to be common between the
impeached members and the parliament; nor did these
persons appear any farther active in the enterprizes, of which
they were accused, than so far as they concurred with the
majority in their votes and speeches. Tho' proofs might,
perhaps, be produced, of their privately inviting the Scots
to invade England; how could such an attempt be consi∣dered
as treason, after the act of oblivion which had passed,
<PB N="403" REF="467"/>
and after that both houses, with the King's concurrence,
had voted that nation three hundred thousand pounds for
their brotherly assistance? While the house of peers are
scarce able to maintain their independency, or reject the
bills sent them by the commons; will they ever be permitted
by the populace, supposing them inclined, to pass a sen∣tence
which must totally subdue the lower house, and put
an end to their ambitious undertakings? These five mem∣bers,
at least Pym, Hambden, and Hollis, are the very
heads of the popular party; and if these be taken off, what
fate must be expected by their followers, who are many of
them accomplices in the same treason? The punishment of
leaders is ever the last triumph over a broken and routed
party; but surely was never before attempted, in opposition
to a faction, during the full tide of its power and suc∣cess.</P>
<P>BUT men had not leisure to wonder at the extreme indis∣cretion
of this measure: Their astonishment was excited
by new attempts, still more precipitant and imprudent. A
serjeant at arms, in the King's name, demanded of the
house the five members; and was sent back without any
positive answer. Messengers were employed to search for
them, and arrest them. Their trunks, chambers, and stu∣dies,
were sealed, and locked. The house voted all these
violences to be a breach of privilege, and commanded every
one to defend the liberty of the members<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 50. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 474, 475.</NOTE>. The King,
irritated by all this opposition, resolved next day to come
in person to the house, with an intention to demand, perhaps
seize in their presence, the persons whom he had accused.</P>
<P>THIS strange resolution was discovered to the Countess
of Carlisle, sister to Northumberland, a lady of great spirit,
wit, and intrigue<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whit∣locke, p. 51. Warwick, p. 204.</NOTE>. She privately sent intelligence to the
five members; and they had time to withdraw, a moment
<PB N="404" REF="468"/>
before the King entered. He was accompanied with his or∣dinary
retinue to the number of above two hundred, armed
as usual, some with halberts, some with walking swords.
The King left them at the door, and he himself advanced
alone thro' the hall; while all the members stood up to re∣ceive
him. The speaker withdrew from his chair, and the
King took possession of it. The speech which he made
was as follows; “Gentlemen, I am sorry for this occasion
of coming to you. Yesterday, I sent a serjeant at arms
to demand some, who, by my order, were accused of
high treason. Instead of obedience, I received a message,
I must here declare to you, that, though no King, that
ever was in England, could be more careful of your pri∣vileges
than I shall be, yet in cases of treason no person
has privilege. Therefore, am I come to tell you, that
I must have these men wheresoever I can find them.
Well, since I see all the birds are shown, I do expect that
you will send them to me as soon as they return. But I
assure you, on the word of a king, I never did intend
any force, but shall proceed against them in a fair and
legal way: For I never meant any other. And now since
I see I cannot do what I came for, I think this no unfit
occasion to repeat what I have said formerly, that what∣ever
I have done in favour and to the good of my sub∣jects,
I do intend to maintain it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 50.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>WHEN the King was looking around for the accused
members, he asked the speaker, who stood below, whether
any of these persons were in the house? The speaker, fall∣ing
on his knee, very prudently replied: “I have, Sir,
neither eyes to see, nor tongue to speak in this place, but
as the house is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am.
And I humbly ask pardon, that I cannot give any other
answer to what your Majesty is pleased to demand of
me<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid, May, book ii. p. 20.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="469"/>
THE commons were in the utmost disorder; and, when
the King was departing, some members cried aloud, so as
he might hear them, <HI>Privilege! privilege!</HI> And the house
immediately adjourned till next day<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT evening, the accused members, to show the
greater apprehension, removed into the city, which was
their fortress. The citizens were, the whole night, in arms.
Some people, who were appointed for that purpose, or per∣haps
actuated by their own terrors, ran from gate to gate,
crying out, that the cavaliers were coming to fire the city,
and that the King himself was at their head.</P>
<P>NEXT morning Charles sent to the mayor, and ordered
him to call a common council immediately. About ten
o'clock, he himself, attended only by three or four lords,
went to Guildhall. He told the council, That he was sorry
to hear of the apprehensions entertained of him; that he
was come to them without any guard, in order to show how
much he relied on their affections; that he had accused cer∣tain
men of high treason, against whom he would proceed
in a legal way, and therefore presumed that they would
not meet with protection in the city. After many other
gracious expressions, he told one of the sheriffs, who of
the two was esteemed the least inclined to his service, that
he would dine with him. He departed the hall without re∣ceiving
the applause which he expected. In passing thro'
the streets, he heard the cry, <HI>Privilege of parliament!
privilege of parliament!</HI> resounding from all quarters. One
of the populace, more insolent than the rest, drew nigh to
his coach, and called out with a loud voice, <HI>To your tents,
O Israel!</HI> the words employed by the mutinous Israelites,
when they abandoned Rehoboam, their rash and ill-counselled
sovereign<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 479. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 361.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="470"/>
WHEN the house of commons met, they affected the
greatest dismay and terror; and, adjourning themselves for
some days, ordered a committee to sit in merchant-taylors
hall in the city. The committee made an exact inquiry
into each circumstrance attending the King's entry into
the house: Every passionate speech, every menacing gesture of
any, even the meanest, of his attendants, was recorded and
aggravated. An intention of offering violence to the par∣liament,
of seizing the accused members in the very house,
and of murdering all who should make resistance, was in∣ferred.
And that unparalleled breach of privilege, for so
it was called, was still ascribed to the counsels of papists
and their adherents. This expression, which recurs every
moment in speeches and memorials, and which, at present,
is so apt to excite laughter in the reader, begot at that time
the deepest and most real confirmation throughout the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>A LETTER was pretended to be intercepted, and was
communicated to the committee, who pretended to lay
great weight upon it. One catholic there congratulates an∣other
on the accusation of the members; and represents
that event as a branch of the same pious contrivance which
had excited the Irish insurrection, and by which the pro∣fane
heretics would soon be extirpated in England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 836.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE house met; and, after confirming the votes of
their committee, instantly adjourned, as if exposed to the
most imminent perils from the violence of their enemies.
This practice they continued for some time. When the
people, by these affected panics, were wrought up to a
sufficient degree of rage and terror, it was thought proper,
that the accused members should, with a triumphant and
military procession, take their seats in the house. The
Thames was covered with boats, and other vessels, laden
with small pieces of ordnance, and prepared for fight.
<PB N="407" REF="471"/>
Skippon, whom the parliament had appointed, by their own
authority, major-general of the city-militia<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 833.</NOTE>, conducted the
members, at the head of this tumultuary army, to West∣minster-hall.
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tumults.</NOTE> And when the populace, by land and by
water, passed Whitehall, they still asked, with insulting
shouts, <HI>What has become of the King and his cavaliers?
And whither are they fled?</HI><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 52. Dugdale, p. 82. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 380.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King leaves London.</NOTE> apprehensive of danger from the enraged
multitude, had retired to Hampton-court, deserted by all
the world, and overwhelmed with grief, shame, and re∣morse;
for the fatal measures into which he had been hur∣ried.
His deplorable situation he could no longer ascribe
to the rigors of destiny, or the malignity of enemies: His
own precipitancy and indiscretion must bear the blame of
whatever disasters should henceforth befal him. The most
faithful of his adherents, between sorrow and indignation,
were confounded with reflections on what had happened,
and what was likely to follow. Seeing every prospect
blasted, faction triumphant, the discontented populace en∣flamed
to a degree of fury, they utterly despaired of success,
in a cause, to whose ruin, friends and enemies seemed
equally to conspire.</P>
<P>THE prudence of the King, in his conduct of this af∣fair,
nobody pretended to justify. The legality of his pro∣ceedings
met with many and just apologies; tho' generally
offered to unwilling ears. No maxim of law, it was said,
is more established, or more universally allowed, than that
privileges of parliament extend not to treason, felony, or
breach of peace; nor has either house, during former
ages, ever pretended, in any of those cases, to interpose in
behalf of its members. Tho' some inconveniences should
result from the observance of this maxim; that would not
be sufficient, without other authority, to abolish a principle
<PB N="408" REF="472"/>
established by uninterrupted precedent, and founded on the
tacit consent of the whole legislature. But what are the
inconveniences so much dreaded? The King, on pretence of
treason, may seize any members of the opposite faction,
and, for a time, gain to his partizans the majority of voices.
But if he seize only a few; will he not lose more friends, by
such a gross artifice, than he confines enemies? If he seize a
great number; is not this expedient force, open and bare∣faced?
And what remedy, in all times, against such force,
but to oppose to it a force which is superior? Even allow∣ing
that the King intended to employ violence, not autho∣rity,
for seizing the members; though at that time, and
ever afterwards, he positively asserted the contrary; yet
will his conduct admit of excuse. That the hall, where,
the parliament assembles, is an inviolable sanctuary, was
never yet pretended. And if the commons complain of the
affront offered them, by an attempt to arrest their members
in their very presence; they ought only to blame themselves,
who had formerly refused compliance with the King's mes∣sage,
when he peaceably demanded these members. The
sovereign is the great executor of the laws; and his presence
was here legally employed, both in order to prevent oppo∣sition,
and to protect the house against those insults which
their disobedience had so well merited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“In a parliament of Queen Elizabeth, when Sir Edward Coke was speaker, the Queen sent a messenger or serjeant at arms into the house of commons, and took out Mr. Morrice, and committed him to prison with divers others, for some speeches spoken in the house. Thereupon Mr. Wroth moved the house, that they would be humble suitors to her Majesty, that she would be pleased to enlarge those members of the house that were restrained; which was done accordingly. And answer was sent by her privy council, That her Majesty had committed them for causes best known to herself; and to press her Highness with this suit, would but hinder the whole good they sought: That the house must not call the Queen to an account for what she doth of her royal authority: That the causes for which they are restrained, may be high and dangerous: That her Majesty liketh no such questions, neither doth it become the house to search into matters of that nature.” See HOWELL's <HI>Inspection into the carriage of the late long parliament,</HI> p. 61.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="409" REF="473"/>
CHARLES knew to how little purpose he should urge
these reasons against the present fury of the commons.
He proposed, therefore, by a message, that they would agree
upon a legal method, by which he might carry on his pro∣secution
against the members, lest farther misunderstand∣ings
happen with regard to privileges. They desired him
to lay the grounds of accusation before the house; and pre∣tended,
that they must first judge whether it were proper
to abandon their members to a legal trial. The King then
informed them, that he would wave, for the present, all
rosecution: By successive messages, he afterwards offered
a pardon to the members; offered to concur in any law that
should acquit or secure them; offered any reparation to
the house for the breach of privilege, of which, he ac∣knowleged,
they had reason to complain<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 84. Rush. vol. v. p. 484, 488, 492, &amp;c.</NOTE>. They were re∣solved
to accept of no satisfaction, unless he would discover
his advisers in that illegal measure: A condition, to which
they knew that, without rendering himself for ever vile and
contemptible, he could not possibly submit. Mean while,
they continued to thunder against the violation of parlia∣mentary
privileges, and, by their violent outcries, to in∣flame
the whole nation. The secret reason of their dis∣pleasure,
however obvious, they carefully concealed. In
the King's accusation of the members, they plainly saw his
judgment of late parliamentary proceedings; and every
member of the ruling faction dreaded the same fate, should
royal authority be re-established in its antient lustre. By
the most unhappy conduct, Charles, while he extremely
augmented, in his opponents, the will, had also increased
the ability, of hurting him.</P>
<P>IN order farther to excite the people, whose dispositions
were already very seditious, the expedient of petitioning
was renewed. A petition from the county of Buckingham
was presented by six thousand men, who promised to live
<PB N="410" REF="474"/>
and die in defence of the privileges of parliament<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 487.</NOTE>. The
city of London, the county of Essex, that of Hertford,
Surrey, Berks, imitated this example. A petition from the
apprentices was graciously received<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 462.</NOTE>. Nay, one
was encou∣raged from the porters; whose numbers amounted, as they
said, to fifteen thousand<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 87.</NOTE>. The address of that great body
contained the same articles with all the others; the privileges
of parliament, the danger of religion, the rebellion of Ire∣land,
the decay of trade. The porters further desired,
that justice might be done upon offenders, as the atrocious∣ness
of their crimes had deserved. And they added, <HI>That
if such remedies were any longer suspended, they would be
forced to extremities not fit to be named, and make good the
saying,</HI> “That necessity has no law<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 412.</NOTE>”.</P>
<P>ANOTHER petition was presented by several poor people,
in the name of many thousands more; in which the peti∣tioners
proposed as a remedy for the public miseries, <HI>That
those noble worthies of the house of peers, who concur with
the happy votes of the commons, may sparate themselves
from the rest, and sit and vote as one intire body.</HI> The
commons gave thanks for this petition<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 413.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE very women were seized with the same rage. A
brewer's wife, followed by many thousands of her sex,
brought a petition to the house; in which the petitioners
expressed their terror of the papists and prelates, and their
dread of like massacres, rapes, and outrages, with those
which had been exercised upon their sex in Ireland. They
had been necessitated, they said, to imitate the example of
the woman of Tekoah: And they claimed equal right with
the men, of declaring, by petition, their sense of the pub∣lic
cause; because Christ had purchased them at as dear a
rate, and in the free enjoyment of Christ consists equally
<PB N="411" REF="475"/>
the happiness of both sexes. Pym came to the door of the
house; and, having told the female zealots that their peti∣tion
was thankfully accepted, and was presented in a sea∣sonable
time, he begged that their prayers for the success
of the commons might follow their petition. Such low
arts of popularity were affected! And by such illiberal cant
were the unhappy people incited to civil discord and con∣vulsions!</P>
<P>ALL petitions, in the mean time, which favoured the
church or monarchy, from whatever hand they came, not
only were discouraged; but the petitioners were sent for,
imprisoned, and prosecuted as delinquents: And this un∣equal
conduct was openly avowed and justified. Whoever
desire a change, it was said, must express their inclination;
for how, otherwise, shall it be known? But those who fa∣vour
the established government in church or state, should
not petition; because they already enjoy what they wish
for<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 449.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King had possessed a very great party in the lower
house, as appeared in the vote for the remonstrance; and
this party, had every new cause of disgust been carefully
avoided, would soon have become the majority; from the
odium attending the violent measures employed by the po∣pular
leaders. A great majority he always possessed in the
house of peers, even after the bishops were consined or
chased away; and this majority could not have been over∣come,
but by outrages, which, in the end, would have
drawn disgrace and ruin on those who incited them. By
the present fury of the people, as by an inundation, were
all these obstacles swept away, and every rampart of royal
authority laid level with the ground. The victory was
pursued with impetuosity by the sagacious commons, who
knew the importance of a favourable moment in all popular
commotions. The terror of their authority they extended
<PB N="412" REF="476"/>
over the whole nation; and all opposition, and even all
blame vented in familiar discourse, were treated as, the most
atrocious crimes, by these severe inquisitors. Scarcely was
it permitted to find fault with the conduct of any particular
member, if he made a figure in the house; and reflections,
thrown out on Pym, were at this time treated as breaches
of privilege. he populace without-doors were ready to
execute, from the least hint, the will of their leaders; nor
was it safe for any member to approach either house, who
pretended to controul or oppose the general torrent. After
so undisguised a manner was this violence conducted, that
Hollis, in a speech to the peers, desired to know the names
of such members as should vote contrary to the sentiments
of the commons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King's Declar. of 12th of August 1642.</NOTE>: And Pym said in the lower house, that
the people must not be restrained in the expressions of their
just desires<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the flight, or terror, or despondency, of the King's
party, an undisputed majority remained every-where to their
opponents; and the bills sent up by the commons, which
had hitherto stopped with the peers, and would certainly
have been rejected, now passed, and were presented for the
royal assent. These were, the pressing bill with its pre∣amble,
and the bill against the bishops votes. The King's
authority was at that time reduced to the lowest ebb. The
Queen too, being secretly threatened with an impeachment,
and finding no resource in her husband's protection, was
preparing to retire into Holland. The rage of the people,
on account of her religion, as well as her spirit and activity,
was universally levelled against her. Usage, the most igno∣minious,
she had hitherto borne with a silent indignation.
The commons, in their fury against priests, had seized her
very confessor; nor would they release him upon her re∣peated
applications. Even a visit of the prince to his mo∣ther
had been openly complained of, and remonstrances
<PB N="413" REF="477"/>
against it had been presented to her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 512.</NOTE>. Apprehensive of
attacks still more violent, she was desirous of facilitating her
escape; and she prevailed with the King to pass these bills,
in hopes of appeasing, for a time, the rage of the multi∣tude<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 428.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THESE new concessions, however important, the King
immediately found to have no other effect, than had all
the preceding ones: They were made the foundation of
demands still more exorbitant. From the facility of his
diposition, from the impotence of his situation, the com∣mons
believed that he could now refuse them nothing. And
they regarded the least moment of relaxation, in their inva∣sion
of royal authority, as highly impolitic, during the un∣interrupted
torrent of their successes. The very moment
they were informed of these last acquisitions, they affronted
the Queen, by opening some intercepted letters wrote to her
by Lord Digby: They carried up an impeachment against
Herbert, attorney-general, for obeying his master's com∣mands
in accusing their members<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 489. Clarendon, ut supra, p. 385.</NOTE>. And they prosecuted
with sresh vigour their plan of the militia, on which they
rested all future hopes of an uncontrouled authority.</P>
<P>THE commons were sensible, that monarchical govern∣ment,
which, during so many ages, had been established in
England, would soon regain some degree of its former dig∣nity,
after the present tempest was overblown; nor would
all their new-invented limitations be able totally to suppress
an authority to which the nation had ever been accus∣tomed.
The sword alone, to which all human ordinances
must submit, could guard their acquired power, and fully
ensure to them personal safety against the rising indignation
of their sovereign. This point, therefore, became the
chief object of their aims. A large magazine of arms
was placed in the town of Hull, and they dispatched thither

Sir John Hotham a gentleman of considerable fortune in
the neighbourhood, and of a very antient family; and gave
him the authority of governor. They sent orders to Go∣ring,
governor of Portsmouth, to obey no commands but
such as he should receive from the parliament. Not con∣tented
with having obliged the King to displace Luns∣ford,
whom he had made governor of the Tower<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 459.</NOTE>, they
never ceased soliciting him till he had also displaced Sir
John Biron, a man of unexceptionable character; and had
bestowed that command on Sir John Conyers, in whom
alone, they said, they could repose confidence. After mak∣ing
a fruitless attempt, in which the peers refused their
concurrence, to give public warning to the kingdom to put
themselves in a posture of defence against the enterprizes of
<HI>papists and other ill-affected persons</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Nalson, vol. ii. p. 850.</NOTE>, they now resolved, by
a bold and decisive stroke, to seize at once the whole power
of the sword, and to confer it intirely on their own crea∣tures
and adherents.</P>
<P>THE severe votes, passed in the beginning of this parliament,
against lieutenants and their deputies, for exercising
powers assumed by all their predecessors, had totally disarmed
the crown, and had not left in any magistrate military au∣thority
sufficient for the defence and security of the nation.
To remedy this inconvenience now appeared necessary. An
ordinance was introduced and passed the two houses, which
restored to lieutenants and deputies the same powers, of
which the votes of the commons, had bereaved them; but
at the same time the names of all the lieutenants were in∣serted
in the ordinance; and these consisted intirely of men.
in whom the parliament could confide. And for their con∣duct,
they were accountable, by the express terms of the
ordinance, not to the King, but to the parliament.</P>
<P>THE policy pursued by the commons, and which had
hitherto succeeded to admiration, was, to astonish the King
<PB N="415" REF="481"/>
by the boldness of their enterprizes, to intermingle no
sweetness with their severity, to employ expressions no less
violent than their pretensions, and to make him sensible
what little estimation they made either of his person or his
dignity. To a bill so destructive of royal authority, they
prefixed, with an insolence seemingly wanton, a preamble
equally dishonourable to the personal character of the King.
These are the words: “Whereas there has been of late a
most dangerous and desperate design upon the house of
commons, which we have just cause to believe an effect
of the bloody counsels of papists and other ill-affected
persons, who have already raised a rebellion in the king∣dom
of Ireland. And whereas, by reason of many dis∣coveries,
we cannot but fear they will proceed, not only
to stir up the like rebellions and insurrections in this
kingdom of England; but also to back them with forces
from abroad, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 519.</NOTE></P>
<P>HERE Charles first ventured to put a stop to his conces∣sions;
and that not by a refusal, but a delay. When this
demand was made; a demand, which, if granted, the
commons justly regarded as the last they should ever have
occasion to make; he was at Dover, attending the Queen
and the Princess of Orange, in their embarkation. He re∣plied,
that he had not now leisure to consider a matter of so
great importance, and must therefore respite his answer till
his return<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 521.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d Feb.</NOTE> The parliament instantly dispatched another
message to him, with solicitations still more importunate.
They expressed their great grief on account of his Majesty's
answer to their just and necessary petition. They repre∣sented,
that any delay, during dangers and distractions so
great and pressing, was not less unsatisfactory and destruc∣tive
than an absolute denial. They insisted, that it was
their duty to see put in execution a measure so necessary for
public safety. And they affirmed, that the people in many
<PB N="416" REF="482"/>
counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th Feb.</NOTE> had applied to them for that purpose, and, in some
places, were, of themselves and by their own authority,
providing against those urgent dangers with which they
were threatened<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 521.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EVEN after this insolence, the King durst not venture
upon a flat denial. Besides excepting to the preamble,
which threw such dishonour upon him, and protesting the
innocence of his intentions, when he entered the house of
commons; he only desired that the military authority, if it
was defective, should first be conferred upon the crown;
and he promised to bestow commissions, but such as should
be revokeable at pleasure, on the very same persons whom
the parliament had named in the ordinance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>. By a former
message, he had expressed his wishes that they would lay be∣fore
him, in one view, all the demands which they deemed
requisite for the settlement of the nation. They pretended,
that they were exposed to perils so dreadful and imminent,
that they had not leisure for such a work<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Idem ib. p. 516, 517.</NOTE>. The expedient
proposed by the King seemed a sufficient remedy during this
emergence; and yet preserved the prerogative of the crown
intire and unbroken.</P>
<P>BUT the intentions of the commons were very wide of
this purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1st March.</NOTE> and their panics could be cured by one re∣medy
alone. They instantly replied, that the dangers and
distempers of the nation were such as could endure no longer
delay; and unless the King speedily complied with their de∣mands,
they should be inforced, for the safety of the King
and kingdom, to dispose of the militia by the authority of
both houses, and were resolved to do it accordingly. They
asserted, that those parts of the kingdom, which have, from
their own authority, put themselves in a posture of defence
during these prevailing jealousies and fears, had acted suit∣able
to the declarations and directions of both houses, and
<PB N="417" REF="483"/>
conformable to the laws of the kingdom. And while they
thus menaced the King with their power, they invited him
to fix his residence at London, where they knew he would
be intirely at their mercy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rush. part iii. vol. i. chap. iv. p. 523.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“I AM so much amazed at this message,” said the King
in his prompt reply, “that I know not what to answer.
You speak of jealousies and fears! Lay your hands on
your hearts, and ask yourselves, whether I may not like∣ways
be disturbed with fears and jealousies: And if so,
I assure you, that this message has nothing lessened
them.”</P>
<P>“AS to the militia, I thought so much of it before I
gave that answer, and am so much assured, that the an∣swer
is agreeable to what in justice or reason you can ask
or I in honour grant, that I shall not alter it in any point.”</P>
<P>“FOR my residence near you, I wish it might be safe
and honourable, and that I had no cause to absent my∣self
from Whitehall: Ask yourselves whether I have
not<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Idem, vol. v. p. 524</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>“WHAT would you have? Have I violated your laws?
Have I denied to pass any bill for the ease and security of
my subjects? I do not ask, what you have done for
me.”</P>
<P>“HAVE any of my people been transported with fears
and apprehensions? I offer as free and general a pardon
as yourselves can devise. All this considered, there is a
judgment of heaven upon this nation, if these distractions
continue.”</P>
<P>“GOD so deal with me and mine as all my thoughts
and intentions are upright for the maintenance of the
true protestant profession, and for the observance and
preservation of the laws; and I hope God will bless and
assist those laws for <HI>my</HI> preservation<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Idem▪ ibid. p. 532.</NOTE>.”

No sooner did the commons despair of obtaining the
King's consent to their ordinance, than they instantly voted,
that those who advised his Majesty's answer were enemies
to the state, and mischievous projectors against the safety of
the nation; that this denial is of such dangerous conse∣quence
that, if his Majesty persist in it, it will hazard the
peace and tranquillity of all his kingdoms, unless some speedy
remedy be applied by the wisdom and authority of both
houses; and that such of the subjects as have put them∣selves
in a posture of defence against the common danger,
have done nothing but what is justifiable, and approved by
the house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, part iii. vol. i. chap. iv. p. 524.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LEST the people, who in no instance had ever seen any
authority of parliament exerted without the concurrence of
the king, might be averse to the seconding all these usurpa∣tions,
they were plied with rumours of danger, with the
terrors of invasion, with the dread of the English and Irish
papists; and the most unaccountable panics were spread
throughout the nation. Lord Digby having entered Kings∣ton
in a coach and six, attended with a few livery-servants,
the intelligence was conveyed to London; and it was imme∣diately
voted, that he had appeared in a hostile manner, to
the terror and affright of his Majesty's subjects, and had le∣vied
war against the King and kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Clarendon. Rush. ubi supra, chap. ii. p. 495.</NOTE>. Petitions from
all quarters Loudly demanded of the parliament to put the
nation in a posture of defence; and the county of Stafford
in particular expressed such dread of an insurrection among
the papists, that every man, they said, was constrained to
stand upon his guard, not even daring to go to church un∣armed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT the same violence, by which he had so long been
oppressed, might not still reach him, and extort his con∣sent
to the ordinance of the militia, Charles had resolved to
<PB N="419" REF="487"/>
remove farther from London:<NOTE PLACE="marg">King arrives at York.</NOTE> And accordingly, taking the
Prince of Wales and the Duke of York along with him,
he arrived, by slow journies, at York, which he was deter∣mined
for some time to make the place of his residence.
The distant parts of the kingdom, being removed from that
furious vortex of new principles and opinions which had
transported the capital, still retained a sincere regard for the
church and monarchy; and the King here found marks of
attachment beyond what he had before expected<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 208.</NOTE>. From
all quarters of England, the prime nobility and gentry, ei∣ther
personally or by messages and letters, expressed their
duty towards him; and exhorted him to save himself and
them from that ignominious slavery with which they were
threatened. The small interval of time, which had passed
since the fatal accusation of the members, had been suffi∣cient
to open the eyes of many, and to recover them from
the astonishment with which at first they had been seized.
One rash and passionate attempt of the King seemed but a
small counterbalance to so many acts of deliberate violence
which had been offered to him, and every other branch of
the legislature: And, however sweet the sound of liberty
many resolved to adhere to that moderate freedom trans∣mitted
them from their ancestors, and now better secured by
such important concessions; rather than, by engaging in a
giddy search after greater independence, run a manifest∣risque,
either of incurring a cruel subjection, or abandon∣ing
all law and order.</P>
<P>CHARLES, finding himself supported by a considerable
party in the kingdom, began to speak in a firmer tone, and
to retort the accusations of the commons with a vigour which
he had never before exerted. Notwithstanding all their
remonstrances, and menaces, and insults, he still persisted
is refusing the militia ordinance; and they proceeded to
frame a new ordinance, in which, by the authority of the
<PB N="420" REF="488"/>
two houses, without the King's consent, they named lieu∣tenants
for all the counties, and conferred on them the com∣mand
of the whole military force, of all the guards, garri∣sons,
and forts of the kingdom. He issued proclamations
against this manifest usurpation; and, as he professed a re∣solution
strictly to observe the law himself, so was he deter∣mined,
he said, to oblige every other person to pay it a
like obedience. The name of the King was so essential to
all laws, and so familiar in all acts of executive authority,
that the parliament were afraid, had they totally omitted
it, that the innovation would be too sensible to the people.
In all commands, therefore, which they conferred, they
bound the persons to obey the orders of his Majesty, signi∣fied
by both houses of parliament. And, inventing a dis∣tinction,
hitherto unheard of, between the office and the
person of the King; those very forces, which they em∣ployed
against him, they levied in his name and by his au∣thorityt<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 526.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable how much the topics of argument were
now reversed between the parties. The King, while he
acknowleged his former error, of employing a plea of neces∣sity,
in order to infringe the laws and constitution, warned
the parliament not to imitate an example on which they threw
such violent blame; and the parliament, while they cloathed
their personal fears or ambition under the appearance of
national and imminent danger, made unknowingly an apo∣logy
for the most exceptionable part of the King's conduct.
That the liberties of the people were no longer exposed to
any peril from royal authority, so narrowly circumscribed,
so exactly defined, so unsupported by revenue and by mili∣tary
power, might be maintained upon very plausible to∣pics:
But that the danger, allowing it to have any existence,
was not of that kind; great, urgent, inevitable; which
dissolves all laws and levels all limitations, seems apparent
<PB N="421" REF="489"/>
from the simplest view of these transactions. So obvious
indeed was the King's present inability to invade the consti∣tution,
that the fears and jealousies, which operated on the
people, and pushed them so furiously to arms, were un∣doubtedly
not of a civil, but of a religious nature. The
distempered imaginations of men were agitated with a con∣tinual
dread of popery, with a horror for prelacy, with an
antipathy to ceremonies and the liturgy, and with a violent
affection for whatever was most opposite to these objects of
aversion. The fanatical spirit, let loose, confounded all
regards to ease, safety; interest; and dissolved every moral
and civil obligation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great courage and conduct, displayed by many of the popular lead∣ers, have commonly inclined men to do them, in one respect, more honour than they deserve, and to suppose, that, like able politicians, they employed pretences which they secretly despised, in order to serve their selfish purposes. It is, however, probable, if not certain, that they were, generally speaking, the dupes of their own zeal. Hypocrisy, quite pure and free from fanaticism, is perhaps as rare as fanaticism intirely purged from all mixture of hypocrisy. So congenial to the human mind are religious sentiments, that it is impossible to counterfeit long these holy servors, without feeling some share of the as∣sumed warmth: And, on the other hand, so precarious and temporary, from the frailty of human nature, is the operation of these spiritual views, that the religious ecstasies, if constantly employed, must often be counterfeit, and must be warped by those more familiar motives of interest and ambition, which insensibly gain upon the mind. This indeed seems the key to most of the celebrated characters of that age. Equally full of fraud and of ardour, these pious patriots talked perpetually of-seeking the Lord, yet still pursued their own purposes; and have left a memorable lesson to posterity, how delu∣sive, how destructive, that principle is by which they were animated.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>EACH party was now willing to throw on its antagonist
the odium of commencing a civil war; but both of them,
prepared for an event which they deemed inevitable. To
gain the people's favour and good opinion was the chief
point on both sides. Never was there a people less cor∣rupted
by vice, and more actuated by principle, than the
English during that period: Never were there individuals
who possessed more capacity, more courage, more public
spirit, more disinterested zeal. The infusion of one ingre∣dient
<PB N="422" REF="490"/>
in too large a proportion had corrupted all these noble
principles, and converted them into the most virulent poi∣son.
To determine his choice in the approaching contests,
every man hearkened with avidity to the reasons proposed on
both sides. The war of the pen preceded that of the sword,
and daily sharpened the humours of the opposite parties.
Besides private adventurers without number, he King and
parliament themselves carried on the controversy, by mes∣sages,
remonstrances, and declarations, where the nation
was really the party to whom all arguments were addressed.
Charles had here a double advantage. Not only his cause
was more favourable, as supporting the antient government
of church and state against the most illegal pretensions: It
was also defended with more art and eloquence. Lord
Falkland had accepted the office of secretary; a man who
adorned the purest virtue with the richest gifts of nature,
with the most valuable acquisitions of learning. By him,
assisted by the King himself, were the memorials of the royal
party chiefly composed. So sensible was Charles of his su∣periority
in this particular, that he took care to disperse
every-where the papers of the parliament together with his
own, that the people might be the more enabled, by com∣parison,
to form a judgment between them: The parlia∣ment,
while they distributed copies of their own, were
anxious to suppress all the King's compositions<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 751.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To clear up the principles of the constitution, to mark
the boundaries of the powers entrusted by law to the several
members, to slow what great improvements the whole po∣litical
system had received from the King's late concessions,
to demonstrate his intire confidence in his people, and his
reliance on their affections, to point out the ungrateful re∣turns
which had been made him, and the enormous en∣croachments,
insults, and indignities, to which he had been
exposed; these were the topics, which, with so much just∣ness
<PB N="423" REF="491"/>
of reasoning and propriety of expression, were insisted
on in the King's declarations and remonstrances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In some of these declarations, supposed to be penned by Lord Falkland, is found the first, regular definition of the constitution, according to our pre∣sent ideas of it, that occurs in any English composition; at least any published by authority. The three species of government, monarchical, aristocratical, and democratical, are there plainly distinguished, and the English government is expresly said to be none of them pure, but all of them mixed and tempered together. This stile, tho' the sense of it was implied in many in∣stitutions, no former king of England would have used; and no subject would have been permitted to use. Banks and the crown-lawyers against Hambden, in the case of ship-money, insist plainly and openly on the king's absolute and sovereign power: And the opposite lawyers do not deny it: They only Wert, that the subjects have also a fundamental property in their goods, and that no part of them can be taken but by their own consent in parliament, But that the parliament was instituted to check and controul the king, and share the supreme power, would, in all former times, have been esteemed very blunt and indiscreet, if not illegal, language. We need not be surprized that government should long continue, tho' the boundaries of authority, in their several branches, be implicit, confused, and undetermined. This is the case all over the world. Who can draw an exact line between the spiritual and temporal powers in catholic states? What code ascertained the precise autho∣rity of the Roman senate, in every occurrence? Perhaps the English is the first mixed government, where the authority of every part has been very ac∣curately defined: And yet there still remain many very important questions between the two houses, that, by common consent, are buried in a discreet silence. The king's power is, indeed, more exactly limited; but this pe∣riod, of which we now treat, is the time at which that accuracy commenced. And it appears from Warwick and Hobbes, that many royalists blamed this philosophical precision in the King's penman, and thought that the veil was very imprudently taken off the mysteries of government. 'Tis certain, that liberty reaped mighty advantages from these controversies and inquiries; and the royal authority itself became more secure, within those provinces which were assigned to it. <HI>Since the first publication of this history, the sequel of Lord Clarendon has been published; where that nobleman asserts, that be was the author of most of these remnonstrances and memorials of the King.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THO' these writings were of consequence, and tended
much to reconcile the nation to Charles, it was evident that
they would not be decisive, and that keener weapons must
determine the controversy. To the ordinance of the par∣liament
concerning the militia, the King opposed his com∣missions
of array. The counties obeyed the one or the
other, according as they stood affected. And in many
<PB N="424" REF="492"/>
counties where the people were divided, mobbish combats
and skirmishes ensued<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">May, book ii. p. 99.</NOTE>. The parliament, on this occasion,
went so far as to vote, “That when the lords and com∣mons
in parliament, which is the supreme court of judi∣cature,
shall declare what the law of the land is, to have
this not only questioned, but contradicted, is a high breach
of their privileges<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 534.</NOTE>.” This was a plain assuming the
whole legislative authority, and exerting it in the most mate∣rial
article, the government of the militia. Upon the same
principles they pretended, by a verbal criticism on the tense
of a Latin verb, to ravish from the King his negative voice
in the legislature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King, by his coronation oath, promises, that he would maintain the laws and cus∣toms which the people had chosen, <HI>quas vulgus clegerit:</HI> The parliament pre∣tended that <HI>elegerit</HI> meant <HI>shall choose;</HI> and consequently, that the King had no right to refuse any bills which should be presented him. See Rush. vol. v p. 580.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE magazine of Hull contained the arms of all the
forces levied against the Scots; and Sir John Hotham, the
governor, though he had accepted of a commission from
the parliament, was not thought to be much disaffected to
the church and monarchy. Charles, therefore, entertained
hopes, that, if he presented himself at Hull before the
commencement of hostilities, Hotham, overawed by his
presence, would admit him with his retinue; after which
he might easily render himself master of the place. But
the governor was on his guard. He shut the gates, and re∣fused
to receive the King, who desired leave to enter with
twenty persons only. Charles immediately proclaimed him
traitor, and complained to the parliament of his disobedi∣ence.
The parliament avowed and justified the action<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 55. Rush. vol. v. p. 565, &amp;c. May, book ii. p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE county of York levied a guard for the King of 600
men:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations for civil war.</NOTE> For the kings of England had hitherto lived among
their subjects like fathers among their children, and had
<PB N="425" REF="493"/>
derived all their security from the dignity of their character,
and from the protection of the laws. The two houses, tho'
they had already levied a guard for themselves, had at∣tempted
to seize all the military power, all the navy, and
all the sorts of the kingdom; had openly employed their
authority in every kind of warlike preparation: Yet imme∣diately
voted, “That the King, seduced by wicked coun∣sel,
intended to make war against his parliament, who,
in all their consultations and actions, had proposed no
other, end, but the care of his kingdoms, and the per∣formance
of all duty and loyalty to his person; that this
attempt was a breach of the trust reposed in him by his
people, contrary to his oath, and tending to a dssolution
of the government; and that whoever should assit him
in such a war, were traitors by the fundamental laws of
the kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 57. Rushworth, vol. v. p. 717. Dugdale, p. 93. May, book ii. p. 54.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THE armies, which had been every-where raised on pre∣tence
of the service of Ireland, were henceforth more openly
inlisted by the parliament for their own purposes, and the
command of them was given to the Earl of Essex. In London
no less than four thousand men inlisted in one day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vicar's God in the mount.</NOTE>. And the
parliament voted a declaration, which they required every
member to subscribe, that they would live and die with their
general.</P>
<P>THEY issued orders for bringing in loans of money and
plate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th June.</NOTE> in order to maintain forces which should defend the
King and both houses of parliament: For this style they
still preserved. Within ten days, vast quantities of plate
were brought to their treasurers. Hardly were there men
enough to receive it, or room sufficient to slow it. And
many with regret were obliged to carry back their offerings,
and wait till the treasurers could find leisure to receive
them. Such zeal animated the pious partizans of the par∣liament
<PB N="426" REF="494"/>
especially in the city! The women gave up all
the plate and ornaments of their houses, and; even their silver
thimbles and bodkins, in order to support the <HI>good cause</HI>
against the malignants<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 58. Dugdale, p. 96, 99.</NOTE></P>
<P>MEAN while the splendor of the nobility, with which the
King was environed, much eclipsed the appearance at West∣minster.
The lord keeper, Littleton, after sending the great
seal before him, had fled to York. Above forty peers of
the first rank attended the King<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">May, book ii. p. 59.</NOTE>, whilst the house of lords
seldom consisted of more than sixteen members. Near the
moiety too of the lower house absented themselves from
counsels which they esteemed so full of danger. The com∣mons
sent up an impeachment against nine peers, for desert∣ing
their duty in parliament. Their own members also,
who should return to them, they voted not to admit, till
satisfied concerning the reason of their absence.</P>
<P>CHARLES made a declaration to the peers who attended
him, that he expected from them no obedience to any com∣mands
which were not warranted by the laws of the land.
The peers answered this declaration by a protest, in which
they declared their resolution to obey no commands but such
as were warranted by that authority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 626, 627. May, book ii. p. 86. Warwick, p. 210.</NOTE>. By these deliberate
engagements, so worthy of an English prince and English
nobility, they meant to confound the furious and tumultu∣ary
resolutions taken by the parliament.</P>
<P>THE Queen, disposing of the crown-jewels in Holland,
had been enabled to purchase a large cargo of arms and
ammunition. Part of these, after escaping many perils,
arrived safely to the King. His preparations were not near
so forward as those of the parliament. In order to remove
all jealousy, he had resolved that their usurpations and illegal
pretensions should be apparent to the whole world, and
<PB N="427" REF="495"/>
Thought, that; to recover the confidence of the people,
was a point much more material to his interest than the
collecting any magazines, stores, or armies, which might
breed apprehensions of violent or illegal counsels. But the
urgent necessity of his situation no longer admitted of delay.
He now prepared himself for defence. With a spirit, acti∣vity,
and address, which neither the one party apprehended,
nor the other expected, he employed all the advantages
which remained to him, and roused up his adherents to
arms. The resources of this Prince's genius increased in
proportion to his difficulties; and he never appeared greater
than when plunged into the, deepest perils and distresses.
From the mixed character, indeed, of Charles, arose in part
the misfortunes in which England was at this time involved.
His political errors, or rather weaknesses, had raised him
inveterate enemies: His eminent moral virtues had pro∣cured
him zealous partisans: And between the hatred of
the one and the affections of the other, was the nation
agitated with the most violent convulsions.</P>
<P>THAT the King might despair of all composition, the
parliament sent him the conditions on which they were
willing to come to agreement. Their demands, contained
in nineteen propostions, amounted to a total abolition of
monarchical authority. They required, that no man should
remain in the council, who was not agreeable to parliament;
that no deed of the King's should have validity, unless it
passed the council, and was attested under their hand; that
all the officers of slate should be chosen with consent of
parliament; that none of the royal family should marry
without consent of parliament or council; that the laws
should be executed against catholics; that the votes of
popish lords should be excluded; that the reformation of
the liturgy and church-government should have place, ac∣cording
to advice of parliament; that the ordinance, with
regard to the militia, be submitted to; that the justice of
parliment may pass upon all delinquents; that a general
<PB N="428" REF="496"/>
pardon be granted, with such exceptions as should be ad∣vised
by parliament; that the sorts and castles be disposed
of by consent of parliament; that no peers be made but
with consent of both, houses<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 722. May, book ii. p. 54.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>“Should I grant these demands;” said the King in re∣ply,
I may be waited on bareheaded; I may have my
hand kissed; the title of majesty be continued to me;
and <HI>The King's authority, signified by both houses</HI> may be
still the style of your commands; I may have swords and
maces carried before me, and please myself with the fight
of a crown and sceptre (tho' even these twigs would not
long flourish, when the stock upon which they grew was
dead): But as to true and real power, I should remain but
the outside, but the picture, but the sign of a King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 728. Warwick, p. 189.</NOTE>.”
War on any terms was esteemed, by the King and all his
counselors, preferable to so ignominious a peace. Charles
accordingly made account of supporting his authority by
arms. “His towns,” he said,
were taken from him,
his ships, his arms, his money; but there dill remained
to him a good cause, and the hearts of his loyal subjects,
which, with God's blessing, he doubted not, would re∣cover
all the rest.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 22.</NOTE> Collecting therefore some forces, he
advanced southwards; and, at Nottingham, he erected his
royal standard, the open signal of discord and civil war
throughout the nation.</P>

<P>WHEN two names,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Commence∣ment of the civil war.</NOTE> so sacred in the English. consti∣tution
as those of KING and PARLIAMENT, were
placed in opposition to each other; no wonder the people
were divided in their choice, and were agitated with the
most violent animosities and factions.</P>
<P>THE nobility, and more considerable gentry, dreading
a total consusion of rank from the fury of the populace,
inlifted themselves in defence of the monarch, from whom
they received, and to whom they communicated their lustre.
Animated with the spirit of loyalty derived from their an∣cestors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of parties.</NOTE>
they adhered to the ancient principles of the consti∣tution,
and valued themselves on exerting the maxims, as
well as inheriting the possessions, of the old English fami∣lies.
And while they passed their time mostly in their
country-feats, they were surprised to hear of opinions pre∣vailing,
with which they had ever been unacquainted, and
<PB N="430" REF="498"/>
which implied not a limitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LVI.</NOTE> but an abolition almosl total,
of monarchical authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among the other nobility, the Earl of Bristol, tho' long in the opposi∣tion, when matters came to extremity, adhered to the court, and was prose∣cuted with implacable hatred by the parliament, He died France in 1652</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE city of London, on the other hand, and most of the
great corporations, took part with the parliament, and ad∣opted
with zeal those democratical principles, on which the
pretensions of that assembly were founded. The govern∣ment
of cities, which, even under absolute monarchies, is
commonly republican, inclined them to this party: The
small hereditary influence which can be retained over the
industrious inhabitants of towns; the natural independence
of citizens; and the force of popular currents over those
more numerous associations of mankind; all there causes
gave, there, authority to the new principles propagated
throughout the nation. Many families too, which had
lately been enriched by commerce, saw with indignation,
that, notwithstanding their opulence, they could not raise
themselves to a level with the antient gentry: They there∣fore
adhered to a power, by whose success they hoped to
acquire rank and consideration,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 4.</NOTE> And the new splendor
and glory of the Dutch commonwealth, where liberty sa
happily supported industry, made all the commercial part
of the nation ardently desire to see a like form of govern∣ment
established in England.</P>
<P>THE genius of the two religions, so closely at this time
interwoven with politics, corresponded exactly to these divi∣sions.
The presbyterian religion was new, republican, and
suited to the genius of the populace: The other had an
air of greater show and ornament, was established on an∣tient
authority, and bore an affinity to the kingly and aristo∣cratical
parts of the conisitution. The devotees of presby∣tery
became of course zealous partizans of the parliament:
<PB N="431" REF="499"/>
The friends of the episcopal church valued themselves on
defending the rights of monarchy.</P>
<P>SOME men also there were of liberal education, who,
being either careless or ignorant of those disputes, bandied
about by the clergy of both sides, aspired to nothing but
an easy enjoyment of life, amidst the jovial entertainment and social intercourse of their companions. All these flocked
to the King's standard; where they breathed a freer air, and
were exempted from that rigid preciseness and melancholy
austerity which reigned among the parliamentary party.</P>
<P>NEVER was a quarrel more unequal than seemed at first
that between the contending parties: Almost every advan∣tage
lay against the royal cause. The King's revenue had
been seized, from the beginning, by the parliament, who
issued out to him, from time to time, small sums for his
present subsistence;, and as soon as he withdrew to York,
they totally stopped all payments. London and all the sea∣ports,
except Newcastle, being in their hands, the customs
yielded them a certain and considerable supply of money;
and all contributions, loans, and impositions, were more
easily raised from the cities which possessed the ready money,
and where men lived under their inspection, than they could
be levied by the King in those open countries, which, after
some time, declared for him.</P>
<P>THE seamen naturally followed the disposition of the
sea-ports to which they belonged: And the Earl of North∣umberland,
lord admiral, having embraced the party of the
parliament, had named, at their desire, the Earl of Warswick
for his lieutenant; who at once astablished his autho∣rity
in the fleet, and kept the intire dominion of the sea in
the hands of that assembly.</P>
<P>ALL the magazines of arms and ammunition were at first
seized by the parliament; and their fleet intercepted the
greatest part of those which were sent by the Queen from
<PB N="432" REF="500"/>
Holland. The King was obliged, in order to arm his fol∣lowers,
to borrow the weapons of the train-bands, under
promise of restornig them as soon as peace should be settled
in the kindom.</P>
<P>THE veneration for parliaments was at that time extreme
throughout the nation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 336.</NOTE>. The custom of reviling those as∣semblies
for corruption, as it had no pretence, so was it un∣known,
during all former ages. Few or no instances of
their encroaching ambition or selfish claims had hitherto been
observed. Men considered the house of commons in no
other light than as the representatives of the nation, whose
interest was the same with that of the public, who were the
eternal guardians of law and liberty, and whom no motive,
but the necessary defense of the people, could ever engage
in an opposition to the crown. The torrent, therefore, of
general affection, ran to the parliament. What is the. great
advantage of popularity; the privilege of affixing epithets
fell of course to that party. The Kings adherents were the
<HI>Wicked</HI> and the <HI>Malignant:</HI> Their adversaries were the
<HI>Godly</HI> and the <HI>Well-affected.</HI> And as the force of the cities
was more united than that of the country, and at once gave
shelter and protection to the parliamentary party, who could
easily suppress the royalisis in their neighbourhood; almost
the whole kingdom, at the commencement of the war, seemed
to be in the hands of the parliament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 318.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT alone gave the King some compensation for all
the advantages possessed by his adversaries, was, the nature
and qualities of his adherents. More bravery and activity
were hoped for, from the generous spirit of the nobles
and gentry, than from the base disposition of the multitude.
And as the men of esates, at their own expense, levied and
armed their tenants; besides an attachment to their masters,
greater force and courage were to be expected in these
<PB N="433" REF="501"/>
rustic troops, than in the vicious and enervated populace of
cities.</P>
<P>THE neighbouring states of Europe, being engaged in
violent wars, little interested themselves in these civil com∣motions;
and this island enjoyed the singular advantage (for
such it surely was) of sighting out its own quarrels without
the interposition of foreigners. France, from policy, had
fomented the first disorders in Scotland; had sent over arms
to the Irish rebels: and continued to give countenance to
the English parliament: Spain, from bigotry, furnished the
Irish with some supplies of money and arms. The Prince
of Orange, closely allied to the crown, encouraged English
officers, who served in the Low-countries, to inlist in the
King's army: The Scots officers, who had been formed in
Germany, and in the late commotions, chiefly took part
with the parliament.</P>
<P>THE contempt, entertained by the parliament of the
King's party, was so great, that it was the chief cause of
pushing matters to such extremity against him; and many
believed that he never would attempt resistance, but must
at last yield to the pretensions, however enormous, of the
two houses. Even after his standard was erected, men
could not be brought to apprehend the danger of a civil
war: nor was it imagined that he would have the impru∣dence
to enrage his implacable enemies, and render his own
condition more desperate, by opposing a force which was
so much superior. The low condition, in which he ap∣peared
at Nottingham, consirmed all these hopes. His ar∣tillery,
though far from numerous, he had been obliged to
leave at York, for want of horses to transport it: Besides
the trained bands of the county, raised by Sir John Digby,
the sheriff, he had not got together above three hundred
infantry. His cavalry, in which consisted his chief strength,
exceeded not eight hundred, and were very ill provided of
arms. The forces of the parliament lay at Northampton,
<PB N="434" REF="502"/>
within a few days march of him; and consisted of above
six thousand men, well armed and well appointed. Had
these troops advanced upon the King, they must soon have
dissipated the small force which he had assembled. By
pursuing him in his retreat, they would have so discredited
his cause and discouraged his adherents, as to have for ever
prevented his gathering an army able to make head against
them. But the Earl of Essex, the parliamentary general,
had not yet received any orders from his masters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 1, 2.</NOTE> What
rendered them so backward, after such precipitant steps as
they had formerly taken, is not easily explained. 'Tis pro∣bable,
that in the extreme distress of his party consised the
present safety of the King. The parliament hoped, that the
royalists, sensible of their feeble condition, and convinced
of their slender resources, would disperse of themselves,
and leave their adversaries a victory, so much the more
complete and secure, that it would be gained without the
appearance of force, and without bloodshed. Perhaps too,
when it became necessary to make the concluding step, and
offer barefaced violence to their sovereign, their scruples and
apprehensions, tho' not susficient to overcome their resolu∣tions,
were able to retard the execution of them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>SIR Jacob Astley, whom the King had appointed major∣general
of his intended army, told him, that he could not
give him assurance but he might be taken out of his bed,
if the rebels should make a brisk attempt to that purpose.
All the King's attendants were full of well-grounded appre∣hensions.
Some of the lords having desired that a message
might be sent to the parliament, with overtures to a treaty;
Charles, who well knew that an accommodation, in his pre∣sent
condition, meant nothing but a total submission, hastily
broke up the council, left this proposal should be farther
insisted on. But next day, the Earl of Southampton, whom
no one could suspect of base or timid counsels, having
<PB N="435" REF="503"/>
offered the same advice, it was hearkened to with more
coolness and deliberation. He urged, That, tho' such a
step would probably increase the insolence of the parlia∣ment;
this was so far from being an objection, that such
dispositions must necessarily turn to the advantage of the
royal cause: That if they refused to treat, which was most
probable, the very sound of peace was so popular, that
nothing could more disgust the nation than such haughty
severity: That if they admitted of a treaty, their propo∣sals,
considering their present condition, would be so exor∣bitant,
as to open the eyes of their most partial adherents,
and gain the general favour to the King's party: And that,
at worst, time might be gained by this expedient, and a
delay of the imminent danger with which the King was at
present threatened<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>CHARLES, on assembling the council, had declared
against all advances towards an accommodation; and had
said, that, having now nothing left him but his honour,
that last possession he was resolved steddily to preserve, and
rather to perish than yield any farther to the pretensions of
hid enemies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE> But by the concurrent desire of the coun∣sellors,
he was prevailed with to embrace Southampton's
advice. Thai nobleman, therefore, with Sir John Cole∣peper
and Sir William Uvedale, was dispatched to London
with offers of a treaty<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. v. p. 784.</NOTE> The manner in which they were
received gave little hopes of success. Southampton was
not allowed by the peers to take his feat; but was ordered
to deliver his message to the usher, and to depart the city
immediately: The commons showed little better disposition
to Colepeper and Uvedale<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 10.</NOTE> Both houses replied, that they
could admit no treaty with the King, till he took down his
standard, and recalled his proclamations, in which the par∣liament
supposed themselves to be declared traitors. The

<PB N="435" REF="505"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="436" REF="506"/>
King, by a second message, denied any such intention against,
the two houses; but offered to recall these proclamations,
provided the parliament agreed to recall theirs, in which
his adherents were declared traitors. They desired him in
return to dismiss his forces, to reside with his parliament,
and give up delinquents to their justice; that is, abandon
himself and his friends to the mercy of his enemies<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 786. Dugdale, p. 102.</NOTE>. Both
parties flattered themselves, that, by these messages and re∣plies,
they had gained the ends which they proposed<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 59.</NOTE>.
The King believed, at the people were sufficiently satis∣fied
of the parliament's insolence and aversion to peace: The
parliament intended, by this vigour in their resolutions, to
support the vigour of their military operations.</P>
<P>THE courage of the parliament was supported, besides
their great superiority of force, by two recent events which
had happened in their favour. Goring was governor of
Portsmouth, the best fortified town in the kingdom, and,
by its situation, of great importance. This man seemed
to have rendered himself an implacable enemy to the King,
by betraying, probably magnifying, the secret cabals of the
army; and the parliament thought that his fidelity to them
might, on that account, be intirely depended on. But the
same levity of mind still attended him, and the same dis∣regard
to engagements and professions. He took under∣hand
his measures with the court, and declared against the
parliament. But, tho' he had been sufficiently supplied
with money, and long before knew his danger; so small
was his forefight, that he had left the place intirely destitute
of provisions, and, in a few days, he was obliged to sur∣render
to the forces of the parliament<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. v. p. 683. Whitlocke, p. 60. Cla∣rendon, vol. iii. p. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of Hertford was a nobleman of the greatest
quality and character in the kingdom, and, equally with
<PB N="437" REF="507"/>
the King, descended, by a female, from Henry VII. During
the reign of James, he had attempted, without having ob∣tained
the consent of that monarch, to marry Arabella
Stuart, a lady nearly related to the crown; and, upon dis∣covery
of his intention, had been obliged, for some time,
to fly the kingdom. Ever after, he was looked on with an
evil eye at court, from which, in a great measure, he with∣drew;
and, living in an independent manner, he addicted
himself intirely to literary occupations and amusements. In
proportion as the King declined in popularity, Hertford's
character flourished with the people; and when this parlia∣ment
assembled, no nobleman in the kingdom possessed more
general favour and authority. By his sagacity, he soon
perceived that the commons, not content with correcting
the abuses of government, were carried, by the natural
current of power and popularity, into the opposite extreme,
and were committing violations, no less dangerous than the
former, upon the English constitution. Immediately he
devoted himself to the support of the King's falling autho∣rity,
and was prevailed with to be governor to the young
Prince, and reside in the court, to which, in the eyes of
all men, he gave; by his presence, a new lustre and autho∣rity.
So high was his character for mildness and humanity,
that he still preserved, by means of these popular virtues,
the public favour; and every one was sensible of the true
motive of his change. Notwithstanding his habits of case
and study, he now bestirred himself in raising an army for
the King; and being named general of the western counties,
where his interest chiefty lay, he began to assemble forces
in Somersetshire. By the assistance of Lord Seymour, Lord
Paulet, John Digby, son to the Earl of Bristol, Sir Francis
Hawley, and others, he had drawn together fome appear∣ance
of an army; when the parliament, apprehensive of the
danger, sent the Earl of Bedford, with a considerable force
against him. On his appearance, Hertford was obliged to
retire into Sherborne castle; and, finding that place inca∣pable
<PB N="438" REF="508"/>
of defence, he himself passed over into Wales, leav∣ing
Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir John Berkeley, Digby, and other
officers, with their horse, consisting of about a hundred
and twenty, to march into Cornwall, in hopes of finding
that county better prepared for their reception<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. vi. p. 2, 3, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL the dispersed bodies of the parliament's army were
now ordered to march to Northampton; and the Earl of
Essex, who had joined them; found the whole amount to
15,000 men<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 60.</NOTE>. The King, though his camp had been gra∣dually
reinforced from all quarters, was sensible that he
had no army which could cope with so formidable a force;
and he thought it prudent, by slow marches, to retire to
Derby, and thence to Shrewsbury, in order to countenance
the levies which his friends were making in those quarters.
At Wellington, a day's march from Shrewsbury, he made
a rendezvous of all his forces, and caused his military orders
to be read at the head of each regiment. That he might
bind himself by reciprocal ties, he solemnly took the fol∣lowing
protestation before his whole army:</P>
<P>“ I do promise, in the presence of Almighty God, and
as I hope for his blessing and protection, that I will, to
the utmost of my power, defend and maintain the true
reformed protestant religion, established in the church of
England, and, by the grace of God, in the same will
live and die.”</P>
<P>“ I desire that the laws may ever be the measure of my
government, and that the liberty and property of the
subject may be preserved by them with the same care as
my own just rights. And if it please God, by his bles∣sing
on this army, raised for my necessary defence, to pre∣serve
me from the present rebellion; I do solemnly and
faithfully promise, in the sight of God, to maintain the
just privileges and freedom of parliament, and to govern
<PB N="439" REF="509"/>
to the utmost of my power, by the known statutes and
customs of the kingdom, and particularly, to observe
inviolably the laws to which I have given my consent this
parliament. Mean while, if this emergence, and the
great necessity to which I am driven, beget any violation
of law, I hope it shall be. imputed by God and man to
the authors of this war; not to me, who have so ear∣nestly
laboured to preserve the peace of the kingdom.”</P>
<P>“ WHEN I willingly fail in these particulars, I shall ex∣pect
no aid or relief from man, nor any protection from
above: But in this resolution, I hope for the chearful
assistance of all good men, and am consident of the bles∣sing
of heaven<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 16, 17. Dugdale, p. 104.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>THOUGH the concurrence of the church undoubtedly
increased the King's adherents, it may safely be affirmed,
that the high monarchical doctrines, so much inculcated by
the clergy, had never done him any real service. The bulk
of that generous train of nobility and gentry, who now at∣tended
the King in his distresses, breathed the spirit of li∣berty
as well as of loyalty: And in the hopes alone of his
submitting to a legal and limited government, were they
willing in his defence to sacrifice their lives and fortunes.</P>
<P>WHILE the King's army lay at Shrewsbury, and he was
employing himself in collecting money, which he received,
though in no great quantities, by voluntary contributions,
and by the plate of the universities, which was sent him;
the news arrived of an action, the first which had happened
in these wars, and where he was successful.</P>
<P>ON the appearance of commotions in England, the
princes Rupert and Maurice, sons of the unfortunate Pala∣tine,
had offered their service to the King; and the for∣mer,
at that time, commanded a body of horse, which had
been sent to Worcester, in order to watch the motions of

Essex, who was marching towards that city. No sooner
had the Prince arrived, than he saw some cavalry of the
enemy approaching the gates. Without delay, he briskly
attacked them, as they were defiling from a lane, and form∣ing
themselves. Colonel Sandys, who led them, and who
fought with valour, being mortally wounded, fell from his
horse. The whole party was routed, and was pursued
above a mile. The Prince, hearing of Essex's approach,
retired to the King<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 25. May, book iii. p. 10.</NOTE>. This recounter, though in itself of
small importance, raised mightily the reputation of the roy∣alists,
and acquired universally to Prince Rupert the charac∣ter
of promptitude and courage; qualities, which he emi∣nently
displayed, during the whole course of the war.</P>
<P>THE King, on mustering his army, found it about
10,000 men. The Earl of Lindesey, who in his youth
had sought experience of military service in the Low-countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was then Lord Willoughby.</NOTE>,
was general: Prince Rupert commanded the
horse: Sir Jacob Astley, the foot: Sir Arthur Aston, the
dragoons: Sir John Heydon, the artillery. The Lord Ber∣nard
Stuart was at the head of a troop of guards. The
estate and revenue of this single troop, according to Lord
Clarendon's computation, was at least equal to that of all
the members, who, at the commencement of war, voted
in both houses. Their servants, under the command of
Sir William Killigrew, made another troop, and always
marched with their masters<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 41. Warwick, p. 231.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WITH this army the King left Shrewsbury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th Oct.</NOTE> resolving to
give battle as soon as possible to the army of the parliament,
which he heard was continually augmenting by supplies
from London. In order to bring on an action, he directed
his course towards the capital, which, he knew, the enemy
would not abandon to him. Essex had now received his
<PB N="441" REF="513"/>
instructions. The import of them was, to present a most
humble petition to the King, and to rescue him and the
royal family from those desperate malignants who had seized
their persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 59. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 27, 28, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Two days after the departure of the roy∣alists
from Shrewsbury, he left Worcester. Though it be
easy in civil wars to get intelligence, the two armies were
within six miles of each other, ere either of the generals
was acquainted with the approach of his enemy. Shrewsbury
and Worcester, the places from which they set out,
are not above twenty miles distant; yet had the two armies
marched ten days in this mutual ignorance. So much had
military skill, during a long peace, decayed in England<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Cla∣rendon, vol. iii. p. 44.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE royal army lay near Banbury:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Edge-hill.</NOTE> That of the parlia∣ment,
at Keinton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23rd of Oct.</NOTE> in the county of Warwick. Prince Ru∣pert
sent intelligence of the approach of the enemy, Tho'
the day was far advanced, the King resolved upon the at∣tack:
Essex drew up his men to receive him. Sir Faithful
Fortescue, who had levied a troop for the Irish wars, had
been obliged to serve in the parliamentary army, and was
now posted on the left wing, commanded by Ramsay, a
Scotsman. No sooner did the King's army approach, than
Fortescue, ordering his troop to discharge their pistols in
the ground, put himself under the command of Prince
Rupert. Partly from this accident, partly from the furious
shock made upon them by the Prince; that whole wing
of cavalry immediately fled, and were pursued for two
miles. The right wing of the parliament's army had no
better success. Chaced from their ground by Wilmot and
Sir Arthur Aston, they also took to flight. The King's
body of reserve, commanded by Sir John Biron, judging,
like raw soldiers; that all was over, and impatient to have
some share in the action, heedlessly followed the chace,
which their left wing had precipitately led them. Sir
<PB N="442" REF="514"/>
William Balfour, who commanded Essex's reserve, per∣ceived
the advantage: He wheeled about upon the King's
infantry, now quite unfurnished of horse, and made great
havock among them. Lindesey, the general, was mortally
wounded, and taken prisoner. His son, endeavouring his
rescue, fell likewise into the enemy's hands. Sir Edmund
Verney, who carried the King's standard, was killed, and
the standard taken; but it was afterwards recovered. In
this situation, Prince Rupert, on his return, found af∣fairs.
Every thing bore the appearance of a defeat, instead
of a victory, with which he had hastily flattered himself.
Some advised the King to leave the field: But that prince
rejected such pusillanimous counsel. The two armies faced
each other for some time, and neither of them retained
courage sufficient for a new attack. All night they lay un∣der
arm's; and next morning found themselves in sight of
each other. General, as well as soldier, on both sides,
seemed averse to renew the battle. Essex first drew off,
and retired to Warwick. The King returned to his former
quarters. Five thousand men are said to have been found
dead on the field of battle; and the loss of the two armies,
as far as we can judge by the opposite accounts, was nearly
equal. Such was the event of this first battle, fought at
Keinton or Edge-hill,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 44, &amp;c. May, book iii. p. 16, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME of Essex's horse, who had been drove off the
field in the beginning of the action, flying to a great distance,
carried news of a total defeat, and struck a mighty
terror into the city and parliament. After a few days, a
more just account arrived; and then the parliament pre∣tended
to a complete victory<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Whit∣locke, p. 61. Clarendon, ut supra, p. 59.</NOTE>. The King also, on his
part, was not wanting to display his advantages; tho', ex∣cept
the taking of Banbury, a few days after, he had few
<PB N="443" REF="515"/>
marks of victory to boast of. He continued his march,
and took possession of Oxford, the only town in his domi∣nions
which was altogether at his devotion.</P>
<P>AFTER the royal army was recruited and refreshed; as
the weather still continued favourable, it was again put in
motion. A party of horse approached to Reading, of which
Martin was appointed governor by the parliament. Both
governor and garrison were seized with a panic, and fled
with precipitation to London. Charles, hoping that every
thing would yield before him, advanced with his whole
army to Reading. The parliament, who? instead of their
fond expectations that Charles would never be able to col∣lect
an army, had now the prospect of a civil war, bloody,
and of uncertain event; were farther alarmed at the near
approach of the royal army, while their own forces lay at
a distance. They voted an address for a treaty. The
King's nearer approach to Colebroke quickened their ad∣vances.
Northumberland and Pembroke, with three com∣moners,
presented the address of both houses; in which
they besought his Majesty to appoint some convenient place
where he might reside, till committees could attend him with
proposals. The King named Windsor, and desired that the
garrison might be removed, and his own troops admitted
into that castle<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 62. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 73.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MEAN while Essex,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th Nov.</NOTE> advancing by hasty marches, had
arrived at London. But neither the presence of his army,
nor the precarious hopes of a treaty, retarded the King's
approaches. Charles attacked; at Brentford, two regiments
quartered there, and, after a sharp action, beat them from
that village, and took about 500 prisoners. The parli∣ament
had sent orders to forbear all hostilities, and had ex∣pected
the same compliance from the King; though no
stipulations to that purpose had been mentioned by their
<NOTE PLACE="foot">x Whitlocke, p. 62. Clarendon, ubi sup. p. 75.</NOTE>
<PB N="444" REF="516"/>
commissioners. Loud complaints were raised against this
attack, as if it had been the most apparent perfidy, and
breach of treaty<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 62. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 75.</NOTE>. Enflamed with resentment, as well as
anxious for its own defence, the city marched its trained
bands in excellent order, and joined the army under Essex.
The force of the parliamentary army now amounted to
above 24,000 men, and was much superior to that of the
King's<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 62.</NOTE>. After both armies had faced each other for some
time, the King drew off and retired to Reading, and from
thence to Oxford.</P>
<P>WHILE the principal armies on both sides were kept in
inaction by the winter-season, the King and parliament were
employed in real preparations for war, and in seeming advances
towards peace. By means of contributions or assessments,
levied by the horse, Charles maintained his cavalry:
By loans and voluntary presents, sent him from all parts of
the kingdom, he supported his infantry: But the supplies
were still very unequal to the necessities under which he
laboured<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 87.</NOTE>. The parliament had much greater resources for
money; and had, by consequence, every military preparation
in much greater order and abundance. Besides an imposition
levied in London, amounting to the five-and-twentieth
part of every one's substance, they established on that
city a weekly assessment of 10,000 pounds, and another of
23,518, on the rest of the kingdom<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 171.</NOTE>. And as their authority
was at present established in most counties, they levied
these taxes with great regularity; though they amounted to
sums much beyond what the nation had formerly paid to
the public exigencies.</P>
<P>THE King and parliament sent reciprocally their demands;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1643.</NOTE>
and a treaty commenced, but without any cessation
of hostilities, as had at first been proposed. The Earl of
<PB N="445" REF="517"/>
Northumberland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiation at Oxford.</NOTE> and four members of the lower house
came to Oxford as commissioners<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 64.</NOTE>. In this treaty, the
King perpetually insisted on the re-establishment of the
crown in its legal powers, and on the restoration of his con∣stitutional
prerogative<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 202.</NOTE>: The parliament still required new
concessions, and a farther abridgment of regal authority, as
a more effectual remedy to their fears and jealousies. Find∣ing
the King supported by more forces and a greater party
than they had ever looked for, they seemingly abated some∣what
of those exorbitant conditions which they had formerly
claimed; but their demands were still too great for an equal
treaty. Besides other articles, to which a complete victory
could alone intitle them, they required the King, in ex∣press
terms, utterly to abolish episcopacy; a demand, which,
before, they only insinuated: And they required, that all
other ecclesiastical controversies should be determined by
<HI>their</HI> assembly of divines; that is, in the manner the most
repugnant to the inclinations of the King and all his parti∣zans.
They likewise desired him to acquiesce in their set∣tlement
of the militia, and to confer on their adherents the
intire authority of the sword. And in answer to the King's
proposal, that his magazines, towns, forts, and ships, should
be restored to him, the parliament required, that they should
be put into such hands as they could confide in<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 166. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 119.</NOTE>: The
nineteen propositions, which they formerly sent the King,
shewed their <HI>inclination</HI> to abolish monarchy: They only
asked, at present, the <HI>power</HI> of doing it. And having
now, in the eye of the law, been guilty of treason, by le∣vying
war against their sovereign; it is evident, that their
fears and jealousies must, on that account, have multiplied
extremely; and have rendered their personal safety, which
they interwove with that of the nation, still more incom∣patible
with the authority of the monarch. Though the

gentleness and lenity of the King's temper might have ensured
them against all schemes of future vengeance; they
preferred, as is no doubt but too natural, an independent
security, accompanied too with sovereign power, before the
station of subjects, and that not intirely guarded from all
apprehensions of danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, who was one of the commissioners, says, p. 65, “ In this treaty, the King manifested his great parts and abilities, strength of reason and quickness of apprehension, with much patience in hearing what was objected against him; wherein he allowed all freedom, and would himself sum up the arguments, and give a most clear judgment upon them. His unhappiness was, that he had a better opinion of others judgments than of his own, though they were weaker than his own; and of this the par∣liament-commissioners had experience to their great trouble. They were often waiting on the King, and debating some points of the treaty with him, until midnight, before they could come to a conclusion. Upon one of the most material points, they pressed his Majesty with their reasons and best arguments they could use to grant what they desired. The King said, he was fully satisfied, and promised to give them his answer in writing according to their desire; but, because it was then past midnight, and too late to put it into writing, he would have it drawn up next morn∣ing (when he commanded them to wait on him again) and then he would give them his answer in writing, as it was now agreed upon. But next morning the King told them, that he had altered his mind: And some of his friends, of whom the commissioners inquired, told them, that after they were gone, and even his council retired, some of his bed-chamber never left preffing and persuading him till they prevailed on him to change his former resolutions.” It is difficult, however, to conceive, that any treaty could have succeeded betwixt the King and parliament, while the latter insisted, as they all along did, on a total submission to all their demands; and challenged the whole power, which they intended to employ, to the punishment of all the King's friends.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conferences went no farther than the first demand
on each side. The parliament, finding that there was no
likelihood of coming to any agreement, suddenly recalled
their commissioners.</P>
<P>A MILITARY enterprize, which they had concerted
early in the spring, was immediately undertaken. Reading,
the garrison of the King, which lay nearest London, was
esteemed a place of considerable strength, in that age, when
<PB N="447" REF="521"/>
the art of attacking towns was not well understood in Eur∣ope,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE>
and was totally unknown in England. The Earl of
Essex sat down before this place with an army of 18,000
men; and carried on his attacks by regular approaches.
Sir Arthur Aston,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th April</NOTE> the governor, being wounded, Colonel
Fielding succeeded to the command. In a little time the
town was found to be no longer in a condition of defence;
and though the King approached, with an intention of ob∣liging
Essex to raise the siege, the disposition of the parlia∣mentary
army was so strong, as rendered that design imprac∣ticable.
Fielding, therefore, was contented to yield the
town, on condition that he should bring off all the garrison
with the honours of war, and deliver up deserters. This
last condition was thought so ignominious and so prejudi∣cial
to the King's interest, that the governor was tried by
a council of war, and condemned to lose his life for con∣senting
to it. His sentence was afterwards remited by the
King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi, p. 265, &amp;c. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 237, 238, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX's army had been fully supplied with all necessaries
from London: Even many superfluities and luxuries were
sent them by the care of the zealous citizens: Yet the hard∣ships
which they suffered from the siege, during so early a
season, had weakened them to such a degree, that they were
no longer fit for any new enterprize. And the two armies,
for some time, encamped in the neighbourhood of each
other, without attempting, on either side, any action of
moment.</P>
<P>BESIDES the military operations between the principal
armies, which lay in the centre of England; each county,
each town, each family almost, was divided within itself;
and the most violent convulsions shook the whole kingdom.
Throughout the winter, continual efforts had every-where
<PB N="448" REF="522"/>
been made by each party to surmount its, antagonist;
and the English, rouzed from the lethargy of peace, with
eager, though unskilful hands, employed against their fel∣low-citizens
their long-neglected weapons. The furious
zeal for liberty and presbyterian discipline, which had hi∣therto
run uncontrouled through the nation, now at last
excited an equal ardour for monarchy and episcopacy; when
the intention of abolishing these antient modes of govern∣ment
was openly avowed by the parliament. Conventions
for neutrality, though, in several counties, they had been
entered into, and confirmed by the most solemn oaths, yet,
being voted illegal by the two houses, were immediately
broke<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 137, 139.</NOTE>; and the fire of discord was spread into every
quarter. The altercation of discourse, the controversies of
the pen, but, above all, the declamations of the pulpit, in∣disposed
the minds of men towards each other, and propa∣gated
the blind rage of party<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 95.</NOTE>. Fierce, however, and in∣flamed
as were the dispositions of the English, by a war both
civil and religious, that great destroyer of humanity; all the
events of this period are less distinguished by atrocious deeds
either of treachery or cruelty, than were ever any intestine
discords which had so long a continuance. A circumstance
which will be found to imply great praise of the national
character of that people, now so unhappily rouzed to arms.</P>
<P>IN the north, the Lord Fairfax commanded for the par∣liament,
the Earl. of Newcastle for the King. This last
nobleman began those associations which were afterwards so
much practised in other parts of the kingdom. He united
in a league for the King the counties of Northumberland,
Cumberland, Westmoreland, and the Bishoprick, and en∣gaged,
some time after, other counties in the same associa∣tion.
Finding that Fairfax, assisted by Hotham and the
garrison of Hull, was making progress in the southern parts
of Yorkshire; he advanced with a body of four thousand
<PB N="449" REF="523"/>
men, and took possession of York. At Tadcaster, he at∣tacked
the forces of the parliament, and dislodged them:
But his victory was not decisive. In other rencounters he
obtained some inconsiderable advantages. But the chief
benefit, which resulted from his eaterprizes, was, the esta∣blishing
the King's authority in all the northern provinces.</P>
<P>IN another part of the kingdom, the Lord Broke was
killed by a shot, while he was taking possession of Litchfield
for the parliament<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was taking a view from a window of St. Chad's cathedral in Litch∣field, where a party of the royalists had fortified themselves. He was cased in complete armour, but was shot through the eye by a random-ball. He was a zealous puritan; and had formerly said, that he hoped to see with his eyes the ruin of all the cathedrals of England. It was a superstitious remark of the royalists, that he was killed on St. Chad's day by a shot from St. Chad's cathedral, which pierced that very eye by which he hoped to see the ruin of all cathedrals, Dugdale, p. 118. Clarendon, &amp;c.</NOTE>. After a sharp combat, near Stafford,
between the Earl of Northampton and Sir John Gell, the
former, who commanded the King's forces, was killed
while he fought with extreme valour; and his forces, discou∣raged
by his death, tho' they had obtained the advantage in
the action, retreated into the town of Stafford<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whit∣locke, p. 66. Rush. vol. vi. p. 152. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR William Waller began to distinguish himself among
the generals of the parliament. Active and indefatigable in
his operations, rapid and enterprising; he was fitted by his
genius to the nature of the, war; which being managed by
raw troops, conducted by unexperienced commanders, af∣forded
success to every bold and sudden undertaking. After
taking. Winchester and Chichester, he advanced, towards
Gloucester, which was in a manner blockaded by Lord
Herbert, who had levied considerable forces in Wales for
the royal party<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 92, 100.</NOTE>. While he attacked the Welsh on one side,
a sally from Gloucester made impression on the other. Her∣bert
was defeated; five hundred of his men killed on the
spot; a thousand taken prisoners; and he himself escaped
<PB N="450" REF="524"/>
with some difficulty to Oxford. Hereford, esteemed a strong
town, defended by a considerable garrison, was surrendered
to Waller, from the cowardice of Colonel Price the go∣vernor.
Tewkesbury underwent the same fate. Worcester
refused him admittance; and Waller, without placing any
garrisons in his new conquests, retired to Gloucester, and
from thence he joined the army under the Earl of Essex<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 263.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the most memorable actions of valour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victories of the royalists in the west.</NOTE> during this
winter-season. were performed in the west, When Sir
Ralph Hopton, with; his small troop, retied into Cornwall
before the Earl of Bedford, that nobleman, despising so in∣considerable
a force, abandoned the pursuit, and committed
the task of suppressing the royal party to the sheriffs of the
County. But the affections of Cornwall were much inclined
to the King's service. While Sir Richard Buller and Sir
Alexander Carew lay at Launceston, and employed them∣selves
in executing the parliament's ordinance for the mili∣tia,
a meeting of the county was assembled at Truro; and
after Hopton produced his commission from the Earl of
Hertsord, the King's general, it was agreed to execute the
laws, and to expel these invaders of the county. The trained
bands were accordingly levied, Launceston taken, and all
Cornwall reduced to peace and to obedience under the
King.</P>
<P>IT had been usual for the royal party, on the com∣mencement
of these disorders, to claim, on all occasions, the
strict: execution of the laws, which they knew were favour∣able
to them; and the parliament, rather than have recourse
to the plea of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessity, and avow the transgression of any
statute, bad also been accustomed to warp the laws, and,
by forced construclions, to interpret them in their own fa∣vour<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Clarendn, vol. iii. p. 130.</NOTE>.
But though, the King was naturally the gainer by
such a method of conducting war, and it was by favour of
law that the trained bands were raised in Cornwall; it ap∣peared
<PB N="451" REF="525"/>
that these maxims were now prejudicial to the royal
party. These troops could not legally, without their own
consent, be carried out of the county; and consequently,
it was impossible to push into Devonshire the advantage
which, they had obtained. The Cornish royalists, there∣fore,
bethought thermselves of levying a force which might
be more serviceable. Sir Bevil Granville, the most beloved
man of that country, Sir Ralph Hopton, Sir Nicholas Slan∣ning,
Arundel, and Trevannion, undertook, at their own
charges, to raise an army for the King; and their great in∣terest
in Cornwall soon enabled them to effect their purpose.
The parliament, alarmed at this appearance of the royalists,
gave a commission to Ruthven, a Scotsman, governor of
Plymouth, to march with all the forces of Dorset, Somerset,
and Devon, and make an intire conquest of Cornwall. The
Earl of Stamford followed him, at some distance, with a
considerable supply. Ruthven, having entered Cornwall
by bridges thrown over the Tamar, hastened to an action;
left Stamford should join him, and obtain the honour of
that victory which he looked for with assurance. The roy∣alists,
in like manner, were impatient to bring the affair to
a decision, before Ruthven's army should receive so consi∣derable
a reinforcement. The battle was fought on Bradock
down; and the King's forces, though inferior in number,
gave a total, defeat to their enemies. Ruthven, with a few
broken troops, fled to Saltash; and when that town was
taken, he escaped, with some difficulty, and almost alone
into Plymouth. Stamford retired, and distributed his forces
into Plymouth and Exeter.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING these advantages, the extreme
want both of money and ammunition, under which the
Cornish royalists laboured, obliged them to enter into a
convention of neutrality with the parliamentary party in
Devonshire; and this neutrality, held all the winter-season.
In the spring it was broken by the authority of the two
<PB N="452" REF="526"/>
houses;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Stratton, May 16th.</NOTE> and war recommenced with great appearance of
disadvantage to the King's party. Stamford, having as∣sembled
a strong body of near seven thousand men, well
supplied with money, provisions, and ammunition, ad∣vanced
upon the royalists, who were not, half his number,
and were oppressed by every kind of necessity. Despair,
joined to the natural gallantry of these troops, commanded
by the prime gentry of the county, made them resolve, by
one vigorous effort, to overcome all these disadvantages.
Stamford being encamped on the top of a high hill near
Stratton, they attacked him in four divisions, at five in
the morning, having lain all night under arms. One division
was commanded by Lord Mohun and Sir Ralph Hopton, an∣other
by Sir Bevil Granville and Sir John Berkeley, a third
by Slanning and Trevannion, a fourth by Basset and Go∣dolphin.
In this manner the action began; the King's
forces pressing with the utmost vigour those four ways up
the hill, and their enemies as obstinately defending them∣selves.
The fight continued with very doubtful success,
till word was brought to the chief officers of the Cornish,
that their ammunition was spent to less than four barrels
of powder. This defect, which they concealed from the sol∣diers,
they resolved to supply by then valour. They agreed
to advance without firing till they should reach the top of
the hill, and could be on equal ground with the enemy.
The courage of the officers was so well seconded by the
soldiers, that the royalists began on all sides to gain ground.
Major-general Chidley, who commanded the parliament∣army
(for Stamford kept at a distance) failed not in his duty;
and when he saw his men recoil, himself advanced with a good
stand of pikes, and, piercing into the thickest of the enemy,
was at last overpowered with numbers and taken prisoner.
His army, upon this disaster, gave ground apace; insomuch
that the four parties of the royalists, growing, nearer and
nearer as they ascended, at last all met together upon the
plain at the top; where they embraced with great joy, and
<PB N="453" REF="527"/>
signalized their victory with loud shouts and mutual congratulations<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 267, 273. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 269, 279.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this success,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Lansdown.</NOTE> the attention of both King and par∣liament
was turned towards the west,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th July.</NOTE> as to a very import∣ant
scene of action. The King sent the Marquis of Hert∣ford
and Prince Maurice with a reinforcement of cavalry;
who, having joined the Cornish army, soon over-ran the
county of Devon; and advancing into that of Somerset,
began to reduce it to obedience. On the other hand, the
parliament having supplied Sir William Waller, in whom
they much trusted, with a complete army, dispatched him
westwards, in order to check the progress of the royalists.
After some skirmishes, the two armies met at Lansdown,
near Bath, and fought a pitched battle, with great loss on
both sides, but without any decisive event<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rush. ut supra, p. 284. Clarendon, ut supra, p. 282.</NOTE>. The gallant
Granville was there killed; and Hopton, by the blowing
up of some powder, was dangerously hurt. The royalists
next attempted to march eastwards, and to join their forces
to the King's at Oxford: But Waller hung on their rear,
and infested their march till they reached the Devizes. Re∣inforced
by additional troops, which flocked to him from
all quarters; he so much surpassed the royalists in number,
that they durst no longer continue their march, or expose
themselves to the hazard of an action. It was resolved that
Hertford and Prince Maurice should proceed with the ca∣valry;
and, having procured a reinforcement from the
King, should hasten back to the relief of their friends in
the Devizes. Waller was so confident of taking this body
of infantry, now abandoned by their friends, that he wrote
to the parliament, that their work was done, and that,
by the next post, he would inform them of the number
and quality of the prisoners. But the King, even be∣fore
Hertford's arrival, hearing of the great difficulties to
<PB N="454" REF="528"/>
which his western army was reduced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Roundway∣down. 13th July.</NOTE> had prepared a con∣siderable
body of horse, which he immediately dispatched
under the command of Lord Wilmot. Waller drew up on
Roundway-down, about two miles from the Devizes; and
advancing with his horse to fight Wilmot, and prevent his
conjunction with the Cornish infantry, was received with
equal valour by the royalists. After a sharp action he was
totally routed, and, flying with a few horse, escaped to
Bristol. Then Wilmot, seizing the enemy's cannon, and hav∣ing
joined his friends whom he came to relieve, attacked
Waller's infantry with redoubled courage; drove them off
the field, and routed and dispersed the whole army<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 285. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 291.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS important victory, following so quick after many
other successes, struck great dismay into the parliament, and
gave an alarm to their principal army commanded by Essex.
Waller exclaimed loudly against that general, for allowing
Wilmot to pass him, and proceed without any interruption
to the succour of the distressed infantry at the Devizes. But
Essex, finding that his army fell continually to decay after
the siege of Reading, was resolved to remain upon the de∣fensive;
and the weakness of the King, and the want of
all military stores, had also restrained the activity of the
royal army. No action had happened in that part of Eng∣land,
except one skirmish, which, of itself, was of no great
consequence, and was rendered memorable by the death
alone of the famous Hambden.</P>
<P>COLONEL Urrey, a Scotsman, who served in the parlia∣ment's
army, having received some disgust, came to Ox∣ford,
and offered his service to the King. In order to
prove the sincerity of his conversion, he informed Prince.
Rupert of the loose disposition of the enemy's quarters, and
exported him to form some attempt upon them. The
Prince, who was intirely fitted for that kind of service,
falling suddenly upon the dispersed bodes of Essex's army,
<PB N="455" REF="529"/>
routed two regiments of cavalry and one of infantry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of Hambden.</NOTE> and
carried his ravages within two miles of the general's quar∣ters.
The alarm being given, every one mounted on horse∣back,
in order to pursue the Prince, to recover the prison∣ers,
and to repair the disgrace which the army had sustained.
Among the rest, Hambden, who had a regiment of infantry
that lay at a distance, joined the horse as a volunteer; and
overtaking the royalists on Chalgrave field, entered into the
thickest of the battle. By the bravery and activity of Ru∣pert,
the King's troops were brought off, and a great booty,
together with two hundred prisoners, was conveyed to Ox∣ford.
But, what most pleased the royalists, was, the expecta∣tion
that some distaster had happened to Hambden, their
capital and much-dreaded enemy. One of the prisoners
taken in the action said, that he was confident Mr. Hamb∣den
was hurt: For he saw him, contrary to his usual cus∣tom,
ride off the field, before the action was finished; his
head hanging down, and his hands leaning upon his, horse's
neck. Next day, the news arrived, that he was shot in the
shoulder with a brace of bullets, and the bone broke.
Some days after, he died, in exquisite pain, of his wound;
nor could his whole party, had their army met with a total
overthrow, have been cast into greater consternation. The
King himself so highly valued him, that, either from ge∣nerosity
or policy, he intended to have sent him his own
surgeon to assist at his cure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warwick's Memoirs, p. 241. Clarendon, vol. i. p. 264.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MANY were the virtues and talents of this eminent per∣sonage;
and his valour, during the war, had shone out
with a lustre equal to that of all the other accomplishments
by which he had ever been so much distinguished. Affabi∣lity
in conversation; temper, art, and eloquence in debate;
penetration and discernment in counsel; industry, vigilance
and enterprize in action; all these praises are unanimously
ascribed to him by historians of the most opposite parties.
<PB N="456" REF="530"/>
His virtue too and; integrity, in all the duties of private life,
are allowed to have been beyond exception. We must only
be cautious, notwithstanding his generous zeal for liberty,
not hastily to ascribe to him the praises of a good citizen.
Through all the horrors of civil war, he sought; the aboli∣tion
of monarchy, and subversion of the constitution; an
end, which, had it been attainable by peaceful measures,
ought carefully to have been avoided by every lover of his
country. But Whether, in the pursuit of this violent enter∣prize,
he was actuated by private ambition, or by honest
prejudices, derived from former abuses of royal authority,
it belongs not to an historian of this age, scarce even to an
intimate friend, positively to determine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author is sensible, that much blame may be thrown upon him, on, account of this last clause in Mr. Hambden's character; as if he was willing to entertain a suspicion of bad intentions, where the actions were praise-worthy. But the author's, meaning is directly contrary: He esteems the last actions of Mr. Hambden's life to have been very blameable; though, as they were de∣rived from good motives, only pushed to an extreme, there is room left to be∣lieve, that the intentions of that patriot, as well as of many of his party, were extremely laudable. Had the preceding administration of the King, which we, are apt to call arbitrary, proceeded from ambition, and an unjust design of encroaching on the ancient liberties, of the people, there would have been less reason for giving him any trust, or leaving in his hands a con∣siderable hate of that power which he had so much abused. But if his con∣duct was derived in a great measure from necessity, and from a natural desire of defending that prerogative which was transmitted to him from his ancestors, and which his parliament was visibly encroaching on; there is no reason why he may not be esteemed a very virtuous prince, and intirely worthy of trust from his, people. The attempt, therefore, of totally annihilating monarchi∣cal power, was a very blameable extreme; especially as it was attended with the danger, to say the least, of a civil war, which, besides the numberless ills attending it, exposed liberty to much greater perils than, it could have in∣curred under the now limited authority of the King. But as these points, could not be supposed so clear during the time as they are, or may be, at pre∣sent; there are great reasons of alleviation for men who were heated by the controversy, or engaged in the action. And it is remarkable, that even at present (such is the force of party prejudices) there are few people who have, coolness enough to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e these matters in a proper light, or are convinced that the parliament could prudently have stopped in their pretensions. They still plead the violations of liberty attempted by the king after granting the pe∣tition of right; without considering the extreme harsh treatment which he met with, after making what great concession, and the impossibility of sup∣porting the government by the revenue then settled on the crown. The worst of it is, that there was a great tang if enthusiasm in the conduct of the par∣liamentary leaders, which, though it might render their conduct sincere, will not much enhance their character with posterity. And tho' Hambden was, perhaps, less infected with this spirit than many of his associates, he ap∣pears not to have been altogether free from it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="457" REF="531"/>
ESSEX, discouraged by this event, dismayed by the total
rout of Waller, was farther informed that the Queen, who
had landed in Burlington-bay, had arrived at Oxford, and
had brought from the north a reinforcement of three thou∣s
and foot and fifteen hundred horse. Dislodging from Thame
and Aylesbury, where he had hitherto lain, he thought pro∣per
to retreat nearer London, and he showed to his friends
his broken and disheartened forces, which a few months
before he had led into the field in so flourishing a condition.
The King, freed from this enemy, sent his army westward
under Prince Rupert; and, by their conjunction with the
Cornish troops, a very formidable force, for numbers as
well as reputation and valour, was composed. That an en∣terprize,
correspondent to mens expectations, might be
undertaken, the Prince resolved to lay siege to Bristol, the
second town for riches and greatness in the kingdom. Na∣thaniel
Fiennes, son to Lord Say, himself, as well as his
father, a great parliamentary leader, was governor, and
commanded a garrison of two thousand five hundred foot,
and two regiments, one of horse, another of dragoons.
The fortifications not being complete or regular, it was re∣solved
by Prince Rupert to storm the city; and next morn∣ing,
with little other provisions, suitable to such a work,
besides the courage of the troops, the assault began. The
Cornish, in three divisions, attacked the west fide, with a
resolution which nothing but death could controul: But
though the middle, division had already mounted the wall;
so great was the disadvantage of the ground, and so brave
<PB N="458" REF="532"/>
the defence of the garrison,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bristol taken. 25th July.</NOTE> that in the end the assailants
were repulsed, with a considerable loss both of officers and
soldiers. On the Prince's side, the assault was conducted
with equal courage, and almost with equal loss, but with
better success. One party, led by Lord Grandison, was
beat off, and the commander himself mortally wounded:
Another, conducted by Colonel Bellasis, met with a like
fate: But Washington, with a less party, finding a place in
the curtain weaker than the rest, broke in, and quickly
made room for the horse to follow. By this irruption,
however, nothing but the suburbs was yet gained: The
entrance into the town was still more difficult: And by the
loss already sustained, as well as by the prospect of farther
danger, every one was extremely discouraged: When, to the
great joy of the whole army, the city, beat, a parley. The
garrison were allowed to march out with, their arms and
baggage, leaving their cannon, ammunition, and colours.
For this instance of cowardice, Fiennes was afterwards tried
by a court-martial, and condemned to lose his head; but
the sentence was remitted by the general<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Rusthworth, vol. vi. p. 284. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 293, 294, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREAT complaints were made of violences exercised on
the garrison, contrary to the capitulation. An apology was
made, by the royalists, as if these were a retaliation for
some violences committed on their friends at the surrender
of Reading. And under pretence of like retaliations, but
really from the extreme animosity of the parties, were such
irregularities continued during the whole course, of the
war<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, ubi sup. p. 297.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE loss, sustained by the royalists in the assault
of Bristol, was considerable. Five hundred excellent soldiers
perished. Among those of condition were Grandison, Slan∣ning,
Trevannion, and Moyle: Bellasis, Ashley, and Sir
John Owen, were wounded: Yet was the success, upon
<PB N="459" REF="533"/>
the whole, so considerable as mightily elated the courage of
the one party, and depressed that of the other. The King,
to show that he was not intoxicated with good fortune, nor
aspired to a total victory over the parliament, published a
manifesto, in which he renewed the protestation, formerly,
taken, with great solemnity, at the head of his army, and
expressed his firm intention of making peace upon the re∣establishment
of the constitution. Having joined the camp
at Bristol, and sent Prince Maurice with a detachment into
Devonshire, he deliberated how to employ the remaining
forces in an enterprise of importance. Some proposed, and
seemingly with great reason, to march directly to London;
where every thing was in great confusion, where the army
of the parliament was baffled, weakened, and dismayed,
and where, it was hoped, either by an insurrection, by vic∣tory,
or by treaty, a speedy end might be put, to the civil
disorders. But this undertaking, by reason of the great
number and force of the London militia, was thought by
many to be attended with considerable difficulties. Glo∣cester,
lying within twenty miles, presented an easier, and
yet a very important conquest. It was the only remaining
garrison possessed by the parliament in those parts. Could
that city be reduced, the King held the whole course of the
Severn under his command; the rich and male-content
counties of the west, having lost all protection from their
friends, might be enforced to pay high contributions, as an
atonement for their disaffection; an open communication
could be preserved between Wales and these new conquests;
and half of the kingdom, being intirely freed from the
enemy, and thus united into one firm body, might be em∣ployed
in re-establishing the King's authority throughout the
remainder. These were the reasons for embracing, that re∣solution;
fatal, as it was ever esteemed, to the royal party<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 69. May, book iii. p. 91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="460" REF="534"/>
THE governor of Glocester was one Massey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Glocester.</NOTE> a soldier
of fortune, who, before he engaged with the parliament,
had offered his service to the King; and as he was free from
the fumes of enthusiasm, by which most of the officers on
that side were intoxicated, he would lend an ear, it was
presumed, to proposals for accommodation. But Massey
was resolute to preserve an intire fidelity to his masters; and
though no enthusiast himself, he well knew how to em∣ploy
to advantage that enthusiastic spirit so prevalent in his
city and garrison.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th Aug.</NOTE> The summons to surrender allowed two
hours for an answer: But before that time expired, there
appeared before the King two citizens, with lean, pale,
sharp, and dismal visages: Faces, so strange and uncouth,
according to Lord Clarendon; figures, so habited and ac∣coutered;
as at once moved the most severe countenances to
mirth, and the most chearsul hearts to sadness: It seemed
impossible that such ambassadors could bring less than a,
desiance. The men, without any circumstance of duty or
good manners, in a pert, shrill, undismayed accent, said,
that they brought an answer from the godly city of Glo∣cester:
And extremely ready were they, according to the
historian, to give insolent and seditious replies to any ques∣tions;
as if their business were chiefly, by provoking the
King, to make him violate his own safe conduct. The an∣swer
from the city was in these words:“We the inhabit∣ants,
magistrates, officers and soldiers, within the garri∣son
of Gloucester, unto his Majesty's gracious message,
return this humble answer: That we do keep this city,
according to our oaths and allegiance, to and for the
use of his Majesty and his royal posterity: And do ac∣cordingly
conceive ourselves wholly bound to obey the
commands of his Majesty signified by both houses of par∣liament:
And are resolved by God's help to keep this
city accordingly<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 28<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 315. May, book iii. p. 96.</NOTE>.” After these preliminaries, the siege
<PB N="461" REF="535"/>
was resolutely undertaken by the army, and as resolutely
sustained by the citizens and garrison.</P>
<P>WHEN intelligence of the siege of Glocester arrived in
London, the, consternation among the inhabitants was as
great as if the enemy were already at their gates. The ra∣pid
progress of the royalists threatened the parliament with
immediate subjection: The factions and discontents among
themselves, in the city and throughout the neighbouring
counties, prognosticated some dangerous division or insur∣rection.
Those parliamentary leaders, it must be owned,
who had introduced such mighty innovations into the Eng∣lish
constitution, and who had projected so much greater,
had not engaged in an enter prize which had exceeded their
courage and capacity. Great vigour, from the beginning,
as well as wisdom, they had displayed in all their counsels;
and a furious, headstrong body, broke loose from the re∣straint
of law, had hitherto been retained in subjection
under their authority, and firmly united by zeal and pas∣sion,
as by the most legal and established government. A
small committee, on whom the houses devolved their
power, had directed all their Counsels, and had preserved a
secrecy in deliberation, and a promptitude in execution,
beyond what the King, notwithstanding the advantages pos∣sessed
by a single leader, had ever been able to attain. Sen∣sible
that no jealousy was by their partizans entertained
against them, they had on all occasions exerted an authority
much more despotic than the royalists, even during the
pressing exigencies of war, could with patience endure in
their sovereign. Whoever incurred their displeasure, or
was exposed to their suspicion, was committed to prison,
and prosecuted under the notion of delinquency: After all
the old jails were full, many new ones were erected; and
even the ships were crowded with the royalists, both gentry
and clergy, who languished below decks, and perished in
those unhealthy confinements: They imposed taxes, the
<PB N="462" REF="536"/>
heaviest, and of the most unusual nature, by an ordinance
of the two houses: They voted a commission for seqnestra∣tion;
and they seized, where-ever they had power, the re∣venues
of all the King's party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The King afterwards copied from this example; but, as the far greatest part of the nobility and landed gentry were his friends, he reaped much less profit from this measure.</NOTE>: And knowing that them∣selves,
and all their ministers, were, by resisting the prince,
exposed to the penalties of law, they resolved, with a fe∣vere
administration, to overcome these terrors, and retain
the people in obedience, by penalties of a more immediate
execution. In the beginning of this summer, a combina∣tion,
formed against them in London, had obliged them
to exert the plenitude of their authority.</P>
<P>EDMOND WALLER, the first refiner of English versifi∣cation,
was a member of the lower house; a man of con∣fiderable
fortune, and not more distinguished by his poetical
genius than by his parliamentary talents, and by the polite∣ness
and elegance of his manners. As full of keen satire
and invective in his eloquence, as of tenderness and pane∣gyric
in his poetry, he caught the attention of his hearers,
and exerted the utmost boldness in blaming those violent
counsels by which the commons were governed. Finding
all opposition within doors to be fruitless, he endeavoured to
form a party without, which might oblige the parliament
to accept of reasonable conditions, and restore peace to the
nation. The charms of his conversation, joined to his, cha∣racter
of courage and integrity, had procured him the in∣tire
confidence of Northumberland, Conway, and every
eminent person of either sex who resided in London. They
opened their breast to him without reserve, and expressed
their disapprobation of the furious methods pursued, by the
commons, and their wishes that some expedient could be
found for stopping so impetuous a career. Tomkins, Wal∣ler's
brother-in-law, and Chaloner, the intimate friend of
<PB N="463" REF="537"/>
Tomkins, had entertained like sentiments: and as the con∣nexions
of these two gentlemen lay chiefly in the city, they
informed Waller, that the same abhorrence of war prevailed
there, among all men of reason and moderation. Upon
reflection, it seemed not impraclicable that a combination
might be framed between the lords and citizens; and, by
mutual concert, the illegal taxes be refused, which the par∣liament,
without the royal assent, imposed on the people.
While this affair was in agitation, and lists were forming of
such as they conceived to be well-affected to their design;
a servant of Tomkins, who had overheard their discourse,
immediately carried the intelligence to Pym. Waller, Tom∣kins,
and Chaloner were seized, and tried by a court-martial<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 326. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 249, 250, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
They were all three condemned, and the two
latter executed on gibbets erected before their own doors.
A covenant, as a test, was taken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">6th of June.</NOTE> by the lords and com∣mons,
and imposed on their army and on all who lived
within their quarters. Besides resolving to amend and re∣form
their lives, the covenanters vow that they will never
lay down their arms so long as the papists, now in open war
against the parliament, shall, by force of arms, be protected
against justice; they express their abhorrence of the late
conspiracy; and they promise to assist to. the Utmost the
forces raised by both houses, against the forces levied by the
King<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 325. Clarendon, vol. ii. p. 255.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WALLER, so soon as imprisoned, sensible of the great
danger into which he was fallen, was so seized with the
dread of death, that all his former spirit deserted him; and
he confessed whatever he knew, without sparing his most in∣timate
friends, without regard to the confidence reposed in
him, without distiguishing between the negligence of fa∣miliar
conyersation and the schemes of a regular conspiracy.
With the most profound dissimulation, he counterfeited
<PB N="464" REF="538"/>
such remorse of conscience, that his execution was put off,
out of mere christian compassion, till he might recover the
use of his understanding. He invited visits from the ruling
clergy of all sects; and while he expressed his own peni∣tence,
he received their devout exhortations with humility
and reverence, as conveying clearer conviction and informa∣tion
than in his life he had ever before attained. Presents
too, of which, as well as of flattery, these holy men were
not insensible, were distributed among them; as a small
retribution for their prayers and ghostly counsel. And by
all these artifices, more than from any regard to the beauty
of his genius, of which, during that time of furious cant
and faction, small account would be made, he prevailed so
far as to have his life spared, and a fine of ten thousand
pounds accepted in lieu of it<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 66. Rushworth. vol. vi. p. 330. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 253, 254, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE severity, exercised against the conspiracy or rather
project of Waller, increased the authority of the parlia∣ment,
and seemed to ensure them against like attempts for
the future. But, by the progress of the King's arms, the
defeat of Sir William Waller, the taking of Bristol, the siege
of Glocester, a cry for peace was renewed, and with more
violence than ever. Crowds of women, with a petition
for that purpose, flocked about the house, and were so
clamorous and importunate, that orders were given for
dispersing them; and some of the females were killed in
the fray<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 357.</NOTE>. Bedford, Holland, and Conway, had deserted
the parliament, and had gone to Oxford; Clare and Love∣lace
had followed them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 67.</NOTE>. Northumberland had retired
to his country-seat: Essex himself shewed extreme dissatis∣faction,
and exhorted the parliament to make peace<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rush, vol. vi. p. 290.</NOTE>.
The upper house sent down terms of accommodation more
moderate than had hitherto been insisted on. It even passed
by a majority among the commons, that these proposals
<PB N="465" REF="539"/>
should be transmitted to the King. The zealots took the
alarm. A petition against peace was framed in the city,
and presented by Pennington, the factious mayor. Multi∣tudes
attended him, and renewed all the former menaces
against the moderate party<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 356.</NOTE>. The pulpits thundered, and
rumours were spread of twenty thousand Irish who had
landed, and were to cut the throats of every protestant<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 320. Rush. vol. vi. p. 588.</NOTE>.
The majority was again turned to the other side; and all
thoughts of pacification being laid aside, every preparation
was made for resistance, and for the immediate relief of
Glocester, on which, the parliament were sensible, all
their hopes of success in the war did so much depend.</P>
<P>MASSEY, resolute to make a vigorous defence, and hav∣ing
under his command a city and garrison ambitious of
the crown of martyrdom, had hitherto maintained the
siege with courage and capacity, and had much retarded
all the advances of the King's army. By continual sallies,
he infested them in their trenches, and gained sudden ad∣vantages
over them: By disputing every inch of ground,
he repressed the vigour and alacrity of their courage; elated
by former successes. His garrison, however, was reduced
to the last extremity; and he failed not, from time to time,
to inform the parliament, that, unless speedily relieved, he
should be necessitated, from the extreme want of provisions
and ammunition, to open his gates to the enemy.</P>
<P>THE parliament, in order to repair their broken condi∣tion,
and put themselves in a posture of defence, now
exerted to the utmost their power and authority. They
voted that an army should be levied under Sir William
Waller, whom, notwithstanding his misfortunes, they loaded
with extraordinary caresses. Having associated in their cause
the counties of Hertford, Essex, Cambridge, Norfolk, Susfolk,
Lincoln, Huntingdon, they gave the Earl of Manchester a
<PB N="466" REF="540"/>
commission to be general of the association, and appointed.
an army to be levied under his command. But, above all,
they were intent that Essex's army, on which their whole
fortune depended, should be put in a condition of, marching
against the King. They afresh excited their preachers to
furious declamations against the royal cause. They, even
employed the expedient of pressing, tho' abolished by a late
law, for which they liad strenuously contended<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 291.</NOTE>. And
they engaged the city to send four regiments of its militia to
the relief of Gloucester. All shops, in the mean while, they
ordered to be shut; and every man expected, with the utmost
anxiety, the event of that important enterprise<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ESSEX, carrying with him a well-appointed, army of
14000 men, took the road of Bedford and Leicester; and,
though inferior in cavalry, yet, by the mere force of conduct
and discipline, he passed over those open champaign coun∣tries,
and defended himsels from the enemy's horse, who had
advanced to meet him, and who infested him during his
whole march. As he approached to Glocester, the King was
obliged to raise the siege, and open the way for Essex to enter
into that city. The necessities of the garrison were extreme.
One barrel of powder was their whole stock of ammuni∣tion.
remaining; and their other provisions were in the same,
proportion. Essex had brought with him military stores;
and the neighbouring country abundantly supplied him with
victuals of every kind. The inhabitants had carefully con∣cealed
all provisions from the King's army, and, pretending
to be quite exhausted, had reserved their stores for that
cause which they so much favoured<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 344.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE chief difficulty still remained. Essex dreaded a
battle with the King's army, on account of their great supe∣riority
of horse; and he resolved to return, if possible, with∣out
running that hazard. He lay five days at Tewkesbury,
<PB N="467" REF="541"/>
which was his first stage after leaving Glocester; and he
feigned, by some preparations, to point towards Worcester.
By a forced march, during the night, lie reached Cirences∣ter,
and obtained the double advantage of passing unmolested
an open country, and of surprising a convoy of provisions
which lay in that town<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 292.</NOTE>. Without delay, he proceeded to∣wards
London; but, when he reached Newbury, he was
surprised to find that the King, by hasty marches, had ar∣rived
before him, and was already possessed of that place.</P>
<P>AN action was now unavoidable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th Sept.</NOTE> and Essex prepared for
it with presence of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Newbury.</NOTE> and not without military conduct.
On both fides the battle was fought with desperate valour
and a steddy bravery. Essex's horse were several times broke
by the King's, but his infantry maintained themselves infirm
array; and, besides giving a continued fire, they presented
an invincible rampart of pikes against the furious impulse
of Prince Rupert, and those gallant, troops of gentry of
which the royal cavalry was chiefly composed, The Lon∣don
militia especially, though utterly unacquainted with
action, though drawn but a few days before from their or∣dinary
occupations, yet, having exactly learned all military
exercises, and being animated with unconquerable zeal for
the cause in, which they were engaged, equalled, on this
occasion, what could be expected from the most veteran
forces. While the armies were engaged with the utmost
ardour, night put an end to the action, and left the event
undecided. Next morning, Essex proceeded on his march;
and though his rear was once put into some disorder by an
incursion of the King's horse, he reached London in safety,
and received deserved applause for his conduct and success
in the whole enterprize. The King followed him on his
march; and having taken possession of Reading, after the
Earl left it, he there established a garrison; and strait∣ened
<PB N="468" REF="542"/>
by that means, London and the quarters of the
enemy<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 293. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 347.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the battle of Newbury, on the part of the King, be∣fides
the Earls of Sunderland and Carnarvon, two noblemen
of promising, hopes, was unfortunately slain, to the great
regret of every lover of ingenuity and virtue throughout
the kingdom, Lucius Cary, Lord Viscount Falkland, fecre∣tary
of slate. Before assembling the present parliament,
this man, devoted to the pursuits of learning, and to the
society of all the polite and elegant, had enjoyed himself in
every pleasure, which a fine genius, a generous disposition,
and an opulent fortune could afford. Called into public
Life, he stood foremost in all attacks on the exorbitant pre∣rogative
of the crown; and displayed that masculine elo∣quence,
and undaunted love of liberty, which, from his
intimate acquaintance with the sublime spirits of antiquity,
he had greedily imbibed. When civil convulsions proceeded
to extremity, and it became requisite for him to choose his
side; he tempered the ardour of his zeal, and embraced the
defence of those limited powers which remained to mon∣archy,
and which he deemed necessary for the support of
the English constitution. Still anxious, however, for his
country, he seems to have dreaded the too prosperous success
of his own party as much as of the enemy; and, among
his intimate friends, often, after a deep silence, and frequent
fighs, he would, with a fad accent, re-iterate the word,
<HI>Peace.</HI> In excuse for the too free exposing of his person.
Which seemed unsuitable in a secretary of state, he alleged,
that it become him to be more active than other men in all
hazardous enterprizes, left his impatatience for peace might
bear the imputation of cowardice or pusillanimity. From
the commencemet of the war, his natural chearfulness and
vivacity became clouded; and even his usual attention to

dress, required by his birth and station, gave way to a ne∣gligence
which was easily observable. On the morning of
the battle in which he Fell, he had shown some care for
the adorning his person; and gave for a reason, that the
enemy should not find his body in any slovenly, indecent
situation. “I am weary,” subjoined he, “of the times,
and forsee much misery to my country; but believe, that
I shall be out of it ere night<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 70. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 350, 351, &amp;c.</NOTE>.” This excellent person
was but thirty-four years of age, when a period was put to
his life.</P>
<P>THE loss sustained on both sides, in the battle of New∣bury,
and the advanced season, obliged the armies to retire
into winter-quarters.</P>
<P>IN the north,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Actions in the north.</NOTE> during this summer, the great interest and
popularity of the Earl, now created Marquis of Newcastle,
had raised a very considerable force for the King; and great
hopes of success were entertained from that quarter. There
appeared, however, in opposition to him, two men, on
whom the event of the war finally depended, and who be∣gan
about this time to be remarked for their valour and mi∣litary
conduct. These were Sir Thomas Fairfax, son to the
lord of that name, and Oliver Cromwel. The former
gained a considerable advantage at Wakefield<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">21st of May.</NOTE> over a de∣tachment
of royalists, and took General Goring prisoner:
The latter obtained a victory at Gainsborow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">31st of July.</NOTE> over a party
commanded by the gallant Cavendish, who perished in the
action. But both these defeats of the royalists were more
than sufficiently compensated by the total rout of Lord
Fairfax at Atherton moor<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">30th of June.</NOTE>, and the dispersion of his whole
army. After this victory, Newcastle, with an army of
15000 men, fat down before Hull. Hotham was no longer
governor of this place. That gentleman and his son, partly
from a jealousy of Lord Fairfax, partly repenting of
<PB N="470" REF="544"/>
their engagements against the King, had entered into a cor∣respondence
with Newcastle, and had expressed an intention
of delivering Hull into his hands. But their conspiracy be∣ing
discovered, they were arrested and sent prisoners to
London; where, without any regard to their former ser∣vices,
they fell, both of them, victims to the severity of the
parliament<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 275</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NEW CASTLE, having carried on the attack of Hull for
some time, was beat off by a sally of the garrison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">12th of October.</NOTE>, and
suffered so much, that he thought proper to raise the siege.
About the same time, Manchester, who advanced from the
eastern associated counties, having joined Cromwel and
young Fairfax, obtained a considerable victory over the
royalists at Horn Castle; where the two officers last-mentioned
gained great renown for their conduct and gallantry. And
though fortune had thus balanced her favours, the King's
party still remained much superior in those parts of Eng∣land;
and had it not been for the garrison of Hull, which
kept Yorkshire in awe, a conjunction of the northern forces
with the army in the south might have been made, and had
probably enabled the King, instead of entering on the un∣fortunate,
perhaps imprudent, enterprize of Glocester, to
march directly to London, and put an end to the war<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 261. Walker, p. 278.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the military enterprizes were carried on with
vigour in England, and the event became every day more
doubtful, both parties cast their eyes towards the neigh∣bouring
kingdoms, and sought assistance for the finishing
that enterprize, in which their own forces experienced such
furious opposition. The parliament had recourse to Scot∣land;
the King, to Ireland.</P>
<P>WHEN the Scots covenanters obtained that end for which
they so earnestly contended, the establishment of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
discipline in their own country, they were not sarisfied,
<PB N="471" REF="545"/>
but indulged still an ardent passion of propagating, by all
methods, that mode of religion in the neighbouring king∣doms.
Having flattered themselves, in the fervor of their
zeal, that, by supernatural assistances, they would be en∣abled
to carry their triumphant covenant to the gates of
Rome itself, it behoved them first to render it prevalent in
England, which already showed so great a disposition to re∣ceive
it. Even in the articles of pacification, they expressed
a desire of uniformity in worship with England; and the
King, employing general expressions, had approved of this
inclination, as pious and laudable. No sooner was there any
appearance of a rupture, than the English parliament, in
order to allure that nation into a close consederacy, openly
declared their wishes of ecclesiastical reformation, and of
imitating the example of their northern brethren<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. Clasendon, vol. iii. p. 68.</NOTE>. When
war was actually commenced, the same artifices were used;
and the Scots beheld, with the utmost impatience, a scene
of action of which they could not deem themselves indif∣ferent
spectators. Should the King, they said, be able, by
force of arms, to prevail over the parliament of England,
and re-establish his authority in that powerful kingdom, he
will undoubtedly retract all those concessions, which, with
so many circumstances of violence and indignity, the Scots
have extorted from him. Besides a sense of his own in∣terest,
and a regard to royal power, which has been intirely
annihilated in this country; his very passion for prelacy and
for religious ceremonies must lead him to invade a church
which he has ever been taught to regard as antichristian and
unlawful. Let us but consider who the persons are that
compose the factions now so furiously engaged in arms.
Does not the parliament consist of those very men who have
ever opposed all war with Scotland, who have punished the
authors of our oppressions, who have obtained us the re∣dress
of every grievance, and who, with many honourable
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>
<PB N="474" REF="546"/>
being likewise denied this request, they returned with ex∣treme
dissatisfaction to Edinburgh.</P>
<P>THE office of conservators of the peace was newly erected
in Scotland, in order to maintain the confederacy between
the two kingdoms; and these, instigated by the clergy,
were resolved, since they could not obtain the King's con∣sent,
to summon, in his name, but by their own authority,
a convention of estates; and to bereave their sovereign of
this article, the only one which remained, of his preroga∣tive.
Under colour of providing for national peace, en∣dangered
by the neighbourhood of English armies, was a
convention called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">22d of June.</NOTE>; an assembly, which, though it meets
with less solemnity, has the same authority as a parliament,
in raising money and levying forces. Hamilton, and his
brother the Earl of Laneric, who had been sent into Scot∣land,
in order to oppose these measures, wanted either autho∣rity
or sincerity; and passively yielded to the torrent. The
general assembly of the church met at the same time with
the convention, and exercising an authority almost absolute
over the whole civil power, made every political considera∣tion
yield to their theological zeal and prejudices.</P>
<P>THE English parliament were, at that time, fallen into
great distress, by the progress of the King's arms; and they
gladly sent to Edinburgh commissioners, with ample powers,
to treat of a nearer union and confederacy with the Scots
nation. The persons employed were the Earl of Rutland,
Sir William Armyne, Sir Henry Vane the younger, Thomas
Hatcher, and Henry Darley, attended with Marshal and
Nye, two clergymen of signal authority<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 73. Rush. vol. vi. p. 466. Cla∣rendon, vol. iii. p. 300.</NOTE>. In this negotia∣tion,
the man chiefly trusted to was Vane, who, in elo∣quence,
address, capacity, as well as in art and dissimula∣tion,
was not surpassed by any one, even during that age,
so famous for active talents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Solemn league and covenant.</NOTE> By his persuasion was framed
at Edinburgh that SOLEMN LEAGUE AND COVENANT;
<PB N="475" REF="547"/>
which effaced all the former protestations and vows taken in
both kingdoms; and long maintained its credit and autho∣rity.
By this covenant, the subscribers, besides engaging
mutually to defend each other against all opponents, bound
themselves to endeavour, without respect of persons, the
extirpation of popery and prelacy, superstition, heresy,
schism, and profaneness; to maintain the rights and privi∣leges
of parliaments, together with the king's authority; and
to discover and bring to justice all incendiaries and malig∣nants<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 373.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE subscribers to the covenant vowed also to preserve
the reformed religion established in the church of Scotland;
but by the artifice of Vane no declaration more explicit∣was
made with regard to England and Ireland, than that
these kingdoms should be reformed, according to the word
of God and the example of the purest churches. The Scots
zealots, when prelacy was abjured, deemed this expression
quite free from ambiguity, and regarded their own model
as the only one which corresponded, in any degree, to such
a description: But that able politician had other views; and
while he employed his great talents in over-reaching the
presbyterians, and secretly laughed at their simplicity, he
had blindly devoted himself to the maintenance of systems
still more absurd and more dangerous.</P>
<P>IN the English parliament there remained some members,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 17.</NOTE> who, tho' they had been induced, either by private ambi∣tion
or by zeal for civil liberty, to concur with the majority,
still retained an attachment to the hierarchy and to the an∣tient
modes of worship. But in the present danger, which
threatened their cause, all scruples were laid aside; and the
covenant, by whose means alone they could expect to ob∣tain
so considerable a reinforcement as the accession of the
whole Scots nation, was received without opposition. The
parliament, therefore, having first subscribed it themselves,
ordered it to be received by all who lived under their au∣thority.

GREAT were the rejoicings among the Scots,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arming of the Scots.</NOTE> that they
should be the happy instruments of extending their mode
of religion, and dissipating that profound darkness in which
their neighbouring nations were involved. The general
assembly applauded this glorious imitation of the piety dis∣played
by their ancestors, who, they said, by three different
applications, during the reign of Elizabeth, had endeavoured
to engage the English, by persuasion, to lay aside the use
of the surplice, tippet, and corner-cap<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 388.</NOTE>. The convention
too, in the height of their zeal, ordered every one to swear
to this covenant, under the penalty of confiscation, beside
what farther punishment it should please the ensuing par∣liament
to inflict on the refusers, as enemies to God, to the
king, and to the kingdom. And being determined that the
sword should carry conviction to all refractory minds, they
prepared themselves, with great vigilance and activity, for
their military enterprizes. By means of a hundred thou∣sand
pounds, which they received from England; by the
hopes of good pay and warm quarters; not to mention
mens favourable disposition towards the cause; they soon
completed their levies. And having added, to their other
levies, the troops which they had recalled from Ireland,
they Were ready, about the end of the year, to enter Eng∣land,
under the command of their old general, the Earl of
Leven, with an army of above twenty thousand men<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 383.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King, foreseeing this tempest which was gathering
upon him, endeavoured to secure himself by every expe∣dient;
and he cast his eye towards Ireland, in hopes that that
kingdom, from which his cause had already received so
much prejudice, might at last contribute somewhat towards
his protection and security.</P>
<P>AFTER the commencement of the Irish insurrection,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE> the English parliament, though they undertook the suppression,
of it, had ever been too much engaged, either in military
projects or expeditions at home, to take any effectual step
<PB N="477" REF="551"/>
towards the finishing that enterprize. They had entered
indeed into a contract with the Scots, for sending over an
army of ten thousand men into Ireland; and in order to
engage that nation into such-an undertaking, beside the
promise of pay, they agreed to put Carickfergus into their
hands, and to invest their general with an authority quite
independent of the English government. These troops, so
long as they were allowed to remain, were useful, by di∣verting
the force of the Irish rebels, and protecting in the
north the small remnants of the British planters. But ex∣cept
this contract with the Scots nation, all the other mea∣sures
of the parliament were hitherto either absolutely insig∣nificant,
or tended rather to the prejudice of the protestant
cause in Ireland. By continuing their violent persecution,
and still more violent menaces against priests and papists,
they rendered the Irish catholics obstinate in their rebellion,
and cut off all hopes of indulgence and toleration. By
disposing beforehand of all the Irish forfeitures to sub∣scribers
or adventurers, they rendered all men of property
desperate, and seemed to threaten a total extirpation of the
natives. And while they thus infused spirit and animosity
into the enemy, no measure was pursued, which could tend
to support or encourage the protestants, now reduced to
the last extremity.</P>
<P>So great is the ascendant, which, from a long course of
successes, the English has acquired over the Irish nation,
that though the latter, when they receive military discipline
among foreigners, are not surpassed by any troops, they have
never, in their own country, been able to make any vigo∣rous
effort for the defence or recovery of their liberties.
In many rencounters, the English, under Lord More, Sir
William St, Leger, Sir Frederick Hamilton, and others
had, though under great disadvantages of situation and
numbers, put the Irish to rout, and returned in triumph
to Dublin. The rebels raised the siege of Tredah, after
<PB N="478" REF="552"/>
an obstinate defence made by the garrison<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 506.</NOTE>. Ormond had
obtained two complete victories, at Kilrush and Ross; and
had brought relief to all the forts which were besieged or
blockaded in different parts of the kingdoma<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 512.</NOTE>. But not∣withstanding
all these successes, even the most common ne∣cessaries
of life were wanting to the victorious armies. The
Irish, in their wild rage against the British planters, had
laid waste the whole kingdom, and were themselves totally
unfit, from their barbarous sloth and ignorance, to raise
any convenience of human life. During the course of six
months, no supplies had come from England; except the
fourth part of one small vessel's lading. Dublin, to save
itself from starving, had been obliged to send the greatest
part of its inhabitants to England. The army had little
ammunition, scarce exceeding forty barrels of powder; not
even shoes or cloaths; and for want of food, the cavalry
had been obliged to eat their own horses. And though the
distresses of the Irish were not much inferior<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 555.</NOTE>; besides
that they were more hardened against such extremities, it
was but a melancholy prospect, that the two nations, while
they continued their furious animosities, should make deso∣late
that fertile island, which might serve to the subsistence
and happiness of both.</P>
<P>THE justices and council of Ireland had been engaged,
chiefly by the interest and authority of Ormond, to fall into
an intire dependence on the King. Parsons, Temple, Lof∣tus,
and Meredith, who seemed to incline towards the op∣posite
party, had been removed; and Charles had supplied
their place by others better affected to his service. A com∣mittee
of the English house of commons, which had been
sent over to Ireland, in order to conduct the affairs of that
kingdom, had been excluded the council, in obedience to
orders transmitted from the King<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 530. Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 167.</NOTE>. And these were rea∣sons
sufficient, besides the great difficulties under which they
themselves laboured, why the parliament were unwilling, to
<PB N="479" REF="553"/>
send supplies to an army, which, though engaged in a
cause they much favoured, was intirely governed by their
declared enemies.</P>
<P>THE King, as he had neither money, arms, ammuni∣tion,
nor provisions to spare from his own urgent wants,
resolved to embrace an expedient, which might at once re∣lieve
the necessities of the Irifsh protestants, and contribute
to the advancement of his affairs in England. A cessation
with the rebels, he thought, would enable his subjects in
Ireland to provide for their own support, and procure him
the assistance of the army against the English parliament.
But as a treaty with a people, so odious for their religion and
their barbarities, might be represented in very invidious co∣lours,
and renew all those calumnies with which he had
been loaded; it was necessary to proceed with great caution
in conducting that measure. A remonstrance from the
army was made to the Irish council, representing their in∣tolerable
necessities, and craving permission to leave the
kingdom: And if that was refused, <HI>We must have recourse,</HI>
they said, <HI>to that first and primary law, with which God
has endowed all men; we mean the law of nature, which
teaches every creature to preserve itself</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rush. vol. vi. p. 537.</NOTE>. Memorials both
to the King and parliament were transmitted by the justices
and council, in which their wants and dangers are strongly
set forth<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem ibid. p. 538.</NOTE>; and though the general expressions in these me∣morials
might perhaps be suspected of exaggeration, yet,
from the particular facts mentioned, from the confession of
the English parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Idem. ib. p. 540.</NOTE>; and from the very nature of
things, it is apparent, that the Irish protestants were reduced
to great extremities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See farther Carte's Ormond, vol. iii. N<SUP>o</SUP> 113, 127, 128, 129, 134, 136, 141, 144, 149, 158, 159. All these papers put it past doubt, that the necessities of the English army in Ireland were extreme. See farther, Rush vol. vi. p. 527. and Dugdale, p. 853, 854.</NOTE>; and it became prudent in the King,
if not absolutely necessary, to embrace some expedient,
<PB N="480" REF="554"/>
which might secure them, for a time, from the ruin and
misery with which they were threatened.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the King gave orders<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">7th of September. See Rush. vol. vi. p. 537, 544, 547.</NOTE> to Ormond and
the justices to conclude, for a year, a cessation with the coun∣cil
of Kilkenny, by whom the Irish were governed, and to
leave both sides in possession of their present advantages.
The parliament whose business it was to find fault with
every measure adopted by the opposite party, and who would
not lose so fair an opportunity of reproaching the King with
his favour to the Irish papists, exclaimed loudly against this
cessation. Among other reasons, they insisted upon the di∣vine
vengeance, which England might justly dread for tole∣rating
antichristian idolatry, on pretence of civil contracts
and political agreements<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Idem▪ ib. p. 557.</NOTE>. Religion, though every day
employed as the engine of their own ambitious purposes,
was supposed too sacred to be yielded up to the temporal
interests or safety of kingdoms.</P>
<P>AFTER the cessation, there was little necessity, as well as
no means, of subsisting the army in Ireland. The King or∣dered
Ormond, who was intirely devoted to him, to send
over considerable bodies of it to England. Most of them
continued in his service: But a small part of them, having
imbibed in Ireland a high animosity against the catholics,
and hearing the King's party universally reproached with
popery, soon after deserted to the parliament.</P>
<P>SOME Irish catholics came over with these troops, and
joined the King's army, where they continued the same
cruelties and disorders to which they had been accustomed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 78, 103.</NOTE>.
The parliament voted, that no quarter, in any action, should
ever be granted them: But Prince Rupert, by using some
reprizals, soon repressed this inhumanity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rushworth, vol. vi. p. 685, 783.</NOTE>.</P>
