<OPENER>Mr. <HI>Osnay</HI> to <HI>Isabella.</HI></OPENER>
<P>“WILL my lovely Isabella pardon
a deceit which had its origin in her beau∣ty?
such charms would justify the black∣est
crimes. Then frown not, my fair,
on the innocent stratagem which procur∣ed
us perfect happiness.—I married
Lady Mary purely to oblige the Earl;
she possesses but the empty title of a wife,
while my fortune, heart, and person
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
are devoted to my Isabella. Come, my
sweet girl, throw off this peevish virtue,
and own with me you have the better bar∣gain.
Settlements are needless, when
all I call my own is yours; but I inclose
you a deed which entitles you to two
hundred pounds per ann. for your life.—As
soon as I can quit this house of
jollity, I shall be with you. Isabella, as
you value your future happiness, let no
cloud overcast that lovely brow; still
bless your lover with your smiles, and
you shall find him”</P>

<P>“This insolent epistle roused my re∣sentment,
and silenced each softer impulse.
I went directly to Mrs. M—'s. It is im∣possible,
Madam, to imagine my indigna∣tion,
while, with the most dauntless ef∣frontery,
she unfolded the blackest scene
of villainy, a sham marriage, and all the
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
hellish arts this practised deluder could in∣vent.
She openly avowed that the cus∣tomer
who sent for her was but pretended;
that she went to inform my father, and,
by enraging a temper already too much ex∣asperated,
easily induced him to accompa∣ny
her, and be himself the witness of my
disobedience. It was she, likewise, who
prevailed upon him to bar his doors against
an unfortunate and deluded daughter.”</P>
<P>“Conscious that apparent stoicism would
deprive this malicious woman of the plea∣sure
she promised herself, I endeavoured to
appear as indifferent as possible, while she
gloried in the successful stratagem.”</P>
<P>“I left her, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent my faltering steps
to the peaceful sanctuary of perfect inno∣cence,
flattering myself it would afford a
ready asylum to a friendless, repentant
daughter, and trusting that a father would
forgive.—I knocked at the door, but was
inexpressibly disappointed to see it opened
by a stranger, who told me, that Mr.
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
L—had left the house some months, and
that he believed he was gone abroad, as he
ordered all parcels brought there for him to
be sent to Portsmouth. This was all he
could inform me. Though I had not seen
my father since my marriage, and he had
returned all my letters unopened, yet this
blow was entirely unexpected. Alas, I
was destined a melancholy proof, that
what we think the greatest misfortune,
may be followed by a still greater; and in
the loss of this offended parent, I was a se∣cond
time deceived. Robbed of the only
friend who could screen me from an ill-na∣tured
world, or administer a ray of com∣fort
to my bleeding heart, together with
the wounding reflection that I had consign∣ed
him to sorrow, and imbittered every
moment of his future life, augmented all
my pangs. I had no friend, no home, no
shelter from the storms of life. Perhaps,
Madam, to this excessive cruelty of for∣tune,
I owe a miserable existence. The
mind, obliged to exert itself, and consci∣ous
it leans not on another for support, col∣lects
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
all its force; or, perhaps, all-pity∣ing
heaven, in this trying hour, lent invi∣sible
assistance, and enabled me to sustain
the most acute afflictions.”</P>
<P>“I returned to Mr. Osnay's lodgings,
and ordered my faithful Betty to pack up
all the things I brought from my father's.
When she had fulfilled my desire, I paid
her what I owed her.”</P>
<P>“Ah, Madam, said this unalterable
friend, believe not your Betty can forsake
you: still suffer her attendance.”</P>
<P>“My good girl, I go I know not
where; but whatever my situation, your
partaking my sufferings will but the more
increase them; nor shall you connect your
fortunes with the ruined happiness of your
afflicted mistress.”</P>
<P>“In vain she remonstrated, I was inex∣orable;
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
and, embracing with a flood of
tears, we parted.”</P>
<P>“Soon after she was gone, I put up all
the baubles, once highly valued, as the
dear testimonies of a passion I then
thought innocent, as it was delightful, and
enclosing them with his letters, and all the
remaining money I had received from him,
sent it to the Earl's by a porter, whom I
ordered not to wait, even if commanded.
I then left the house, resolving never to en∣ter
it, or see this faithless betrayer more.
Ordering a hackney coach to follow with
my trunk, I set out in search of a ready
furnished lodging. I went into the first
house where I saw a bill on the window,
and agreed for a two pair of stai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s apart∣ment.”</P>
<P>“Ah, Madam, what a fate was mine,
with but one shilling in my pocket, friend∣less,
destitute, forsaken! I hoped by sell∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
my cloathes, to support myself till I
could get into service.”</P>
<P>“My landlady, a good kind of woman,
made it her business to enquire; and
through her assistance and recommendati∣on,
I was received into Lady Beverley's
service, to whom she was very well known.
Since that time, my life has glided on,
though without pleasure, yet exempt from
additional anguish, and I wait in calm ex∣pectation
of that period which will release
me at once from life and misery.”</P>

<HEAD>Miss <HI>Montsort</HI> in Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>MY Fanny, were we disposed to mora∣lize,
where shall we find a fairer subject?—That
we are less miserable, is it not
because we are less perfect, that we have
not adorned afflictions by sustaining them?</P>
<P>Let those who, exulting in their own
goodness, their virtue, or their fortitude,
condemn the amiable Isabella; let them
consider how vain the triumph of that good∣ness
which never succoured the distressed;
let them glory in that virtue which never
stood temptation, or that fortitude never
exercised with sufferings.</P>
<P>I have sent you the whole of Isabella's
history in one packet, and am certain you
will agree with me, that it is infinitely more
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
interesting than it would have been in se∣parate
letters.</P>
<P>My Fanny, favour me with your reflec∣tions:
<HI>I</HI> think of nothing but the faithless
Harcourt. But does not the lovely Isabella de∣monstrate,
that what we call fate or chance,
is the direction of an all-ruling provi∣dence?
Of that providence, my friend,
foreseeing future misery from the sweet
connection, has taught me, through Har∣court's
inconstancy, to think no more of
him. Ah, Fanny, can your Eliza then e∣ver
cease to think of the amiable Edmond?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXV.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Edmond Harcourt, Es{que} to Lord Charles
Rainsford.</OPENER>
<P>WHY, faith, “'tis strange, 'tis pas∣sing
strange, 'tis pitiful, 'tis wonderous
pitiful,” that I, Edmond Harcourt, till
now the most renowned in the world for
<HI>bagatelle</HI> and <HI>gaieté de coeur,</HI> am over head
and ears in a confounded scrape, which
even half the whining devils this and the
last age have produced, would have been
ashamed of having fallen into. In good
truth, though those whining devils would
find it no very melancholy affair to have a
lovely, amiable, accomplished girl, of
fortune superior to their own, declare an
attachment to them; or you perhaps,
Rainsford, at first sight, may not find any
thing in it, to destroy the <HI>gaietè de coeur</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
I boasted. But marked ye not, I said of
<HI>superior fortune?</HI> and know ye not, that I
have sworn never to accept from a wife,
those riches my own inheritance could not
give me? There's my pride, my feelings,
and my misfortune; but, such is my obsti∣nacy,
no power on earth can make me
change my resolution.</P>
<P>And yet am I not, in this self-denial,
this pride of mine, shewing the absolute
inconsistency of human nature? Three
months ago, while I believed it impossible
to make the slightest impression on Miss
Montfort's heart, I was assiduous to excess
in my endeavours to gain it.—A letter
of hers has now fallen into my hands, in
which she owns she loves me—and I treat
her with indifference:</P>
<Q><L>“I choose the coldest words my heart to hide,</L>
<L>And cure her sex's weakness thro' it's pride.”</L></Q>
<P>The poor girl seems rather unhappy up∣on
the occasion, and hardly knows whether
or not to think it <HI>honour.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="14" REF="13"/>
<L>“It comes in such a questionable shape.”</L></Q>
<P>But trust that thirty years hence, sitting
with some humble friend in the mansion
house of a large estate, just charmed with
her son's alliance, or her daughter's suitors,
she will tell the follies of her youth, and
own—Hey, Rainsford, What shall
she own?—that “Brutus was an honoura∣ble
man.” Ha! ha! ha!</P>
<P>You ask what I laugh at. Why, faith,
'tis more than I can tell you; but finding
in myself a strange propensity to yawn,
and concluding your ideas must be pretty
much in the same situation, I was deter∣mined
to make an attempt at the <HI>derángé,</HI>
and I have practised it too much, during
the whole course of my life, to entertain
the least doubt of success. That same de∣rangement,
Rainsford, is the very soul of
society: who would wish for an existence
which should “one even tenor keep?”
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
—Not I, upon my soul.—And of all
<HI>orders</HI> of beings, let me <HI>shine</HI> in the dis∣orderly.
There's my <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> though
it must be a devilish dark night indeed
which can make it glitter.</P>
<P>Rainsford, didst ever see a set of stroll∣ing
players, the head of which, deter∣mined
to outdo all predecessors, struts on
as Julius Caesar—and himself, forgetting
his razor and his bason, imagines all his
hearers do the same? But his companions
in toil cannot so easily lose the recollection
of what he was—and though deceived
himself, and <HI>generally</HI> deceiving those who
knew the facetious Dick Johnson, excellent
as a barber, and a companion, would ill-relinquish
him for the awkward hero.—So
I, sometimes imagine the charming
Eliza preferred the “Man of Feeling,” to
the “Man of Honour.”</P>
<P>I pass my time, though very agreeably—very
much at my case too, for a man in
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
love. Edwards, Williamson, and some
other very good sort of fellows, are in
town: I traverse the park, and lounge in
the coffee-house with them: sometimes es∣cort
the ladies to Vauxhall and Mary-bone:
pretty often contrive to meet the
Montforts; then swear it was the luckiest
accident in the world; teaze the poor girl
a little, not from ill-nature upon my soul,
for I doat upon her, but for the dear de∣light
of seeing she still loves me; in return
for which I let her see that I treat no other
woman with more attention.</P>
<P>One would swear, Rainsford, you had
fallen in love with me too, that I should
thus think myself at liberty to plague you.
I am convinced my letter must be extreme∣ly
diverting, and very much to the pur∣pose:
all I can say for it, therefore, is
comprized in telling you, it is an epitome

<OPENER>Sir George Ashby to Augustus Richmond, Es{que}</OPENER>
<P>YES, Richmond, I have this moment
wrote the important letter, which invites
my Emilia to my arms, and have unfold∣ed
thy too successful plot. Dare not to re∣dicule
the remaining honour that dictated
the avowal, Had you been witness to the
astonishing alteration in my lovely girl,
even thy hardened heart must have relent∣ed,
and have dried the mistaken tear which
flowed for a friend's unkindness. The
blush that shamed the rose, her dimpled
smiles are vanished, while the sweetest ele∣gance,
the most engaging softness, render
her doubly attractive. Upon my soul,
were it possible to place my Emilia in the
situation from which my arts occasioned
her removal, to reinstate her in Lady Ash∣by's
favour, I would with transport forego
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
every gratification I promise myself; but
Mrs. Burton informs me, that my mother,
finding we set off together, vowed never
more to receive her.—“Receive who?”
you cry.—Ah, Augustus, the innocent,
the deluded Emilia, while the malicious
part of the world, ever ready to satirize
the virtue they cannot imitate, condemn
the amiable girl.—I am all impatience
for her answer. That she loves me I am
thoroughly assured: and can the tender
Emilia refuse my pressing solicitations,
when seconded by her own heart?</P>
<P>How is the lovely cottager, your Mari∣an?
Richmond, what if, for once in your
life, you act a borrowed part, and shine a
man of honour? You say you are con∣vinced
her virtue is imp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egnable: for
shame them cease to attempt it. But thou
art blest with such a dauntless front, that
I question whether even being baffled by a
woman (though in thy opinion the most
mortifying thing in the world) would dis∣compose
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
compose it.—However, take my advice,
content thyself with the sprightly widow,
take compassion upon her, and the other
belles of the Castle, who, by your own
account, (which none can doubt) are dy∣ing

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss Lesley to Miss Winchester.</OPENER>
<P>AH, my amiable Henrietta, and are
you too deceived by the injurious calumny
of a malevolent world?—Cruel girl!
this is indeed a barbed arrow that has sunk
deeper into the soul of your once favoured
Emilia than all her other misfortunes: a
misfortune too clearly evident to admit a
shadow of hope; for had illness prevented
your writing, some friend had undertaken
the task of comfort, and alleviated the sor∣rows
of an ill-fated girl, alike unknowing
real guilt, and imputed crimes.</P>
<P>Why do I take up my pen, since I have
no reason to expect you will receive my
letters? It is not to intreat forgiveness, or
to implore your pity: my heart disdains a
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
pardon it would scorn to merit. And
when I am no more, till which these sheets
shall not be delivered to you, it is not in
my Henrietta to refuse a tear.</P>
<P>Sir George is still brotherly in his assi∣duities;
but I cannot prevail with him to
let me leave this sweet retreat, where even
the dejection of my countenance cannot
cast a gloom, and where the air still blows
fresh and chearful, as if it had never
borne my sighs.</P>
<P>A letter from Sir George Ashby.—Ah,
my ill-boding heart!</P>
<DIV2>
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
<HEAD>EMILIA in Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>YES, Henrietta, the grief I expect∣ed
is at length come to pass, and the mis∣fortunes
of your Emilia are accomplished.—All-gracious
heaven! there neeeded
but this—nay, scarcely needed it—to put
a final period to an existence, wretched be∣yond
the power of human nature to support.—Miss
Winchester, my heart is broke.—Sir
George Ashby has made dishonour∣able
proposals; and his cruelty, though not
his passion, shall be gratified. I fall an
early victim to the cold hand of death, by
<HI>his</HI> hands, for whose sake alone I could wish
existence: pleased too in that death, that
I save the man I love from a crime which
would for ever fix the sharpest stings of
remorse in his breast.—Yes, my friend, I
have long loved the inimitable Ashby.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22"/>
Unpractised in the deceits of man. My
fond imagination pictured his mind lovely
as his person; and thought my heart,
though it was all I had to bestow, too poor
a tribute to such merit. Fool that I was,
not to perceive I gave away all hopes of
happiness!</P>
<P>Engaged to Lady Harriet, what had I
to expect from Sir George Ashby?—A
letter such as he has sent me—and I have
nothing to offer in palliation of my weak∣ness,
but that I was ignorant of its
excess.</P>
<P>In the first emotion Sir George's letter
raised in me, I was on the point of re∣proaching
him in the bitterest terms my
pen could communicate; for he owns it
was he who, through the means of Mrs.
Burton, infused suspicions of my carrying
on an intrigue with him, into the mind of
Lady Ashby—and it was <HI>he</HI> intercepted
my tale of sorrow to you. But when I
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
reflected on the balm the confession poured
into my soul, that Lady Ashby would one
day be undeceived, and that my Henriet∣ta
was still faithful, my resentment ceased;
but I could not resist the desire I felt of
wounding him to the very soul.</P>
<P>I know my existence cannot be of many
days duration. Already the pen seems
dropping from my trembling hand—Sleep
has forsaken my weary eye-lids—I can∣not
read, or walk, or eat with satisfaction,
and I feel within me an assurance of a
speedy deliverance from this scene of trou∣ble.
Still is my resolution of not letting
this reach you till after my decease, the
same. The sight of you, was you kind
enough to fly to my assistance, would only
make me regret leaving a world which
has now no charms to induce my stay.</P>
<P>I have wrote a little billet by way of
answer to Sir George, which, though
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
clothed in terms really expressive of my
situation, has a very different appearance.</P>
<P>I said, I was not yet in the state I wish∣ed,
begged he would not yet think of see∣ing
me.—That when it was out of the
power of malevolence and slander to affect
me, which would soon be the case, a note
from me should inform him, and I should
expect him instantly to obey the summons.</P>
<P>The good woman of the house, to
whom I have told my story, has acted the
part of a mother. Ah, could mine look
down, and behold the sorrows of her in∣jured
child!—The thought is agony—I
will hope she cannot.</P>
<P>The farmer and his son have not for
some time seen me. To my friendly hos∣tess,
therefore, I have given my orders,
which I am perfectly satisfied she will obey.—I
have desired to be buried at the foot of
a favourite tree, near the ruin I have de∣scribed
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
to you. A plain urn is to be my
monument, with the initials of my name,
and the following text:</P>
<P>“Boast not thyself of to-morrow, for
thou knowest not what a day may bring
forth.”</P>
<P>Adieu, my Henrietta; may you have
many friends, and may they all love you
as sincerely as your Emilia has done; but
may the tale of her misfortunes be all they
will ever feel of them; may the reality
be buried with</P>

<OPENER>Mr. Willmott to Miss Lucy Montfort.</OPENER>
<P>AFTER so long an absence, will Miss
Montfort still own her once loved Will∣mott?
Has she not rather yielded to a
more amiable, a wealthier victor, and for∣got
the honest courtship of the heart, in
elegance, in pomp, and pleasure?</P>
<P>Your sister, I hope, is as well and as
sprightly as ever. Your friend, Charlotte
Watson, likewise, is she still my advo∣cate?
And is my charming Lucy as lively
and as tender as in those delightful hours
of happiness we lately knew? Say, my
love, are the shades of Montfort-Hall still
beautiful as when every tree afforded a
shelter for innocence and truth?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27"/>
You desired an account of Bengal:
would it were in my power to obey you,
but your Willmott was never a nice ob∣server.</P>
<P>Calcutta is a very populous place, and
in that part of it inhabited by the natives,
the houses are much crowded. Our Euro∣peans,
indeed, live more agreeably, and
are careful to build in the most airy situati∣ons.
The soil is fruitful, and the culti∣vated
part, inclosed for rice grounds, makes
a very pretty appearance. The more de∣sart
part of India, is much covered with
small shrubs, which lead me to imagine
the soil capable of affording many valuable
products, if it were properly managed—but
I am in expectation of being soon sent
up the country, when I shall be able to
give you a clearer idea of this part of the
world.</P>
<P>We live here much at our ease, take ex∣ercise
in our verrandos, and have palan∣quins
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
at command; and I am so well con∣vinced
that it is impossible, after spend∣ing
much time in Calcutta, to be happy
in England, that I am not ambitious of
returning.</P>
<P>I have been unfortunate, my sweet
friend, in all my undertakings. How,
indeed, could I be otherwise, when my
luckiest planet had withdrawn its chearing
influence?</P>
<P>By the treachery of a trusted friend, I
was deprived of the wealth I had amassed
with the most careful diligence, cheated
of that which I doubted not would prove
my highest happiness, as I flattered myself
the treasure would be sweetened by my Lu∣cy's
participation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Winter, a widow of excellent for∣tune,
blest with great sweetness of temper,
and in all the bloom of beauty, with hu∣manity
peculiar to herself, relieved my
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
woes. O, Miss Montfort, were it not for
her assistance, your Willmott had indeed
been miserable.—A thousand little inad∣vertencies
declare she does not hate him,
declare her heart is his, her hand and for∣tune
at his disposal—but still I hope to be
happy in my Lucy's society. O, Madam,
do not hate the man who, to maintain his
constancy for Miss Montfort, sacrifices
youth, beauty, and fortune.</P>
<P>I find, from my father's letters, that it
is reported I am going to be married.
Perhaps my sweet Lucy is miserable
through the groundless report: but do not
believe it. Were it even possible for the La∣dy
to whom I am given to be more amiable,
more lovely than her who first received my
vows, I should blush to have it said Harry
Willmott was inconstant.—Convinced of
this, you have no longer cause to be un∣easy.
I can suffer, but I will never forfeit
my word: the hand I once offered Miss
Montfort is still at her disposal.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30"/>
It is a charming evening, and Mrs.
Winter desires I will accompany her in a
walk.—You see, my dear Lucy, we live
perfectly <HI>a l' Angloise.</HI> This the more tem∣perate
part of the year is absolutely de∣lightful;
and there needs but yours, and
the company of a few more female friends,

<HEAD>Sir George Ashby in Continuation.</HEAD>
<P>THE happiest of human beings did
I say?—Ah, Richmond, no pangs can
match the daggers thou hast planted in
this heart!</P>
<P>Talk not to me of pleasure, or of friend∣ship,
I renounce them both—but chief thy
correspondence, thou plotting fiend, who,
like the traiterous viper, hast stung the
breast that nourished thee.</P>
<P>See there she lies, all pale! Yet still the
tender smile beams on her lovely counte∣nance,
as if ambitious to accompany the
sweet Emilia to the cold regions of the
grave, and gild its horrors.—Ah, go, ye
lovely, ye delusive fugitives, ye are use∣less
here; for when she died, all pleasure
<PB N="35" REF="34"/>
died with her, and ye but mock misfor∣tune.</P>
<P>Fondly dreaming of future joys, and
roving through the fields of fancy, I ar∣rived
at Osnay Dale.—The flowers put on
their sweetest tints, the birds greeted the
enraptured Ashby with their most melodi∣ous
warblings, while all nature seemed to
share his transports.</P>
<P>I flew to my Emilia's apartment to
breathe the sincerest vows of love, and clasp
the consenting beauty to my heart.—Ah,
Richmond, even imagination cannot paint
the horrors that presented themselves before
me.—Emilia, the once blooming Emi∣lia,
pale, wan, yet lovely still—too true a
prophetess!—died indeed for me! Foolish,
not clearly to perceive her meaning, or
dream her angel purity ever meant to bless
my guilty passion!—She lay (her lovely
form, the sweetest emblem of her fairer
mind) she lay—Ah, Richmond!—in her
<PB N="36" REF="35"/>
cossin!—The freshest roses covered her
shrowd, and blushed to bloom when she
was dead.</P>
<P>It was too much to support.—Horror,
anguish and despair robbed me, for a time,
of life; and I recovered but to execrate
Augustus Richmond. Are these thy boast∣ed
plots? this thy method of procuring
happiness? and is it thus thy friends ac∣knowledge
thy assistance, thou cool deceit∣ful
villain?—But you claim the merit of
your plot—your too successful plot.—Thou
hast, indeed, a head admirably turned for
scheming, witness my poor Emilia; but
you can never feel for the misery you have
occasioned, till you have seen her, have
beheld that lovely blossom, nipped like the
morning flower.—Ah, death, when couldest
thou boast so fair a captive? Appear but
as Emilia, and even the most happy will
court thy hand.</P>
<P>How delightful the days I have spent at
my angel's sweet retreat; how soft, how
<PB N="37" REF="36"/>
elegant her converse; how animated every
scene!—My God! and who could think
the flowery path led but to despair?</P>
<P>When pleasure would attract or passion
subdue, I can propose a never-failing anti∣dote.
Think you behold the lovely Lesley
on the bed of death, and hear her last
sigh accuse her Ashby.</P>
<P>But why did I arraign thy conduct; why
condemn my friend?—Richmond but
shewed the dagger—'twas Ashby point∣ed
it to his Emilia's breast.—You never
saw the lovely victim; and I only am to
blame, who knowing the sweetly-noble
Lesley, knew not, that she preferred death,
even to the shadow of guilt—and yet,
Augustus—But who can blame the Indi∣an,
who ignorant of heaven, courts not
its joys?—Oh, come, administer comfort
to thy wounded friend!—But my Emilia
is dead—and</P>
<Q><PB N="38" REF="37"/>
<L>“What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?</L>
<L>Whose tongue is music now?”</L></Q>
<P>Ah, Richmond, stop—and if it is pos∣sible
for thee to moralize, reflect one mi∣nute
on thy Ashby—see him miserable,
though blest by fortune to profuseness—while
Emilia Lesley, richer in inborn
greatness, in death has taught us</P>
<Q><L>“Not with the purple colouring of success</L>
<L>Is Virtue best adorned.”</L></Q>
<P>Augustus, if I have too much complain∣ed
of thee, let us exchange reciprocal for∣giveness.
What was the famed Lucretia,
to our chaster heroine?—Her virtue lan∣guishes,
if set in competition with Emilia's,
and yields the palm to her who knew to
conquer the tender inclinations of her soft∣ened
heart.</P>
<P>Richmond, you knew not my murdered
love, and thought no woman chaste, but
<PB N="39" REF="38"/>
the untempted.—But I cease to complain
of thee, since every accusation returns to
my own breast with sharpened stings.</P>
<P>Pardon this wildly-inconsistent letter.
Can the dark murderer compose his style
Or can you hope that he who has destroyed
the loveliest work of heaven; should send
you a sheet less incoherent than his mind?—My

<P>DEAD! Why, this it is to have to do
with your sentimental Misses. Could you,
Bevill, have conceived it possible the girl
should have taken it so much to heart?—Upon
my soul I am sorry for it; but I on∣ly
meant to make her happy—And faith
whose afraid?—Let it be said, that <HI>I</HI> was
the cause of her death: with all my heart.
The girl was a good girl, and you know,</P>

What I write to you for, Bevill, is to
desire you will immediately take post for

comfort him.—Tell him that I am ashamed
to see him—that I know not how to write

<OPENER>Miss Lucy Montfort, to Miss Charlotte Watson.</OPENER>
<P>MY Charlotte, the report is true; the
faithless Willmott “has found a richer
maiden.” Could you have believed this
affectionate lover appeared amiable but to
deceive; and won my heart that he might
break it?</P>
<P>My sister enclosed Mr. Willmott's letter
for your perusal. I blush to own that, for
some days after I received it, I was inca∣pable
of writing. But my resentment, my
slighted love (Charlotte, where shall I find
a name to express my feelings?) obliged
me to answer that epistle which caused me
so much pain. Take then the copy of it.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="42"/>
Miss <HI>Lucy Montfort</HI> to Mr. <HI>Wilmott.</HI></P>
<P>“A three years silence almost convin∣ced
me Mr. Willmott was too much a
man of the world to” “sacrifice youth,
beauty, and fortune,” “to maintain an
old-fashioned constancy; but, wonder∣ing
at his exalted generosity, I retract
my mistaken opinion.—You are really
commendable, Sir; and the” “sacri∣fice,”
so very uncommon, that I would
by no means detract from your merit;
a merit of which I confess myself as
sensible, as even <HI>you</HI> could wish me.
But the same sense that dictated this he∣roic
conduct might have likewise inform∣ed
Mr. Willmott that the woman with
whom love, only, made him equal, will
easily regain her superiority, and, by a
glorious effort, resign this East-India
phoenix, to “a widow of excellent for∣tune,
and in all the bloom of beauty.”</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="43"/>
“When I declare you free, Sir, the only
emotion I feel is that of shame: I blush
ever to have been connected with a man
I so heartily despise.”</P>
<P>Charlotte, could he read this heart! Ah
how different from the deceitful paper!—
Should I not rather have said,</P>
<P>“MY Willmott, I see the struggle
between your love and honour; and
though you are inconceivably dear to
your affectionate Lucy, she knows to
conquer the tenderest attachment, when
in competition with your interest—nor
is it so hard a task; she must be blessed,
while you are happy.”</P>
<P>Sure this were better—for it is more
sincere.</P>
<P>My friend, give yourself the trouble
once more to peruse his letter. Does he
not make a merit of his constancy?—
<PB N="45" REF="44"/>
“You have no cause to be uneasy.—I can
suffer, but will never forfeit my word.
He would be ashamed to have it said
he changed.”</P>
<Q><L>“And fall these sayings from that gentle tongue</L>
<L>Where civil speech and soft persuasion hung?”</L></Q>
<P>But I have no reason to reproach him.—Mrs.
Winter's charms—the prospect of
superior fortune—her flattering partiality—and
still (indeed Willmott thou hast cause
to boast) my Henry's heart retains the
flame it first received—the object is but
altered.—And this, Charlotte, if our grand∣mamas
say true, is the invariable conduct
of the sex. Falshood appears their crite∣rion
of perfection; and who shall longer
say—no man is perfect?</P>
<P>Since I wrote to Mr. Willmott, Lord
Charles Rainsford solicits my affection.—My
friend, to love, and be deceived, are
synonimous—and is the deception then so
sweet as to be again embraced by your</P>

<OPENER>Captain Bevill to Augustus Richmond, Es{que}</OPENER>
<P>COULD a letter, bearing the signa∣ture
of Augustus Richmond, be receiv∣ed
with regret, it was your last. I set off
immediately to console the penitent Sir
George.</P>
<P>The good people of the farm-house,
where he lodged, directed me to Osnay
Dale, where it seems he passes the greatest
part of his time.</P>
<P>Richmond, you can have no idea of
the alteration a few days have made in
him.</P>
<P>I found him in a walk, which, I am
told, his loved Emilia used to frequent.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="46"/>
He seemed pleased to see me; and press∣ing
my hand to his heart, “My Bevill,
how kind this friendly visit!—But
I will nobly overpay your trouble.”</P>
<P>Saying this, he turned towards the
house, and conducted me to Emilia's apart∣ment.</P>
<P>Ah, Richmond, even a stoic must have
wept the woes which there appeared before
me.</P>
<P>He led me to the coffin, then taking his
Emilia's hand; “Bevill,” said he, “it
was <HI>I</HI> who played the dark assassin, and
directed the fatal stroke.”</P>
<P>He could no longer contain himself;
and waving his hand, as if wishing me to
depart, I left the room.</P>
<P>I did not see him for some time after.—He
at last approached me, his
eyes red with weeping.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="47"/>
“Ah, my friend,” said he, “can you
excuse me?—But I am convinced:
to Captain Bevill there needs no apolo∣gy
for my weakness.”</P>
<P>I assured him of my concern for him,
and how much I was interested in his mis∣fortune.
—He begged me to make La∣dy
Ashby acquainted with his sorrows,
and to do justice to his Emilia.</P>
<P>In compliance with his desire, I took
post for London, and found her ladyship
at home.</P>
<P>She was inexpressibly affected with the
recital, sometimes accused Sir George,
but, more frequently, condemned herself
for leaving the sweet Miss Lesley friendless
and destitute.</P>
<P>Mrs. Burton was dismissed with ignomi∣ny.
Her ladyship entreated me to return
to Osnay Dale, and endeavour to calm her
Ashby's troubled mind.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="48"/>
Before we parted, we agreed that I
should, if possible, prevail on him to take
a little tour, to dissipate his melancholy.</P>
<P>On my return, I found Sir George still
at Osnay Dale, and it was with the greatest
difficulty I could persuade him to accom∣pany
me to the farm-house.</P>
<P>The next morning, intending to pay
his daily visit to his lovely Emilia, he en∣tered
the chamber, but the corpse was
gone. The good woman, fearing it
would too much affect him were he present,
had interred it, according to Miss Lesley's
orders, near a favourite ruin.</P>
<P>He flew to the grave, lamented that he
should no longer behold the only object he
wished to see, and decked the urn with the
most blooming flowers.</P>
<P>He has promised to accompany me to
Italy, but wishes me to defer my journey
<PB N="50" REF="49"/>
for a few days. I assure him my business is
so urgent that I might be a loser by the least
delay, and he thinks too much of Emilia
to question my veracity.</P>
<P>I shall write to you as soon as we leave
this place, and flatter myself I shall have it
in my power to inform you, Sir George
Ashby regains his chearfulness. That he
may, is the sincere wish of your</P>

<OPENER>Edmond Harocurt, Es{que} to Lord Charles

<P>HUZZA! Rainsford! Here's trans∣port
for you, my boy!—Not the sober
refinements of delicate sensibility, with
all the long et-cetera of fine-spun sensa∣tions,
but real and substantial happiness:
such as none but thy mad friend can feel;
for none, before, was ever blessed like him.
But if I could descend a little from these al∣titudes,
and recount these amazing chan∣ges,
I presume it would be more accepta∣ble
to a fellow of your gravity.</P>
<P>You know then the little expectation my
uncle's marriage left me of his fortune;
but the faithless Caroline, as if willing, by
her crimes, to occasion me that felicity her
virtue had not been great enough to ac∣complish,
disobliged the old gentleman so
much by a <HI>faux-pas,</HI> that he has left <HI>her</HI> no∣thing,
<PB N="52" REF="51"/>
and his estate entirely to <HI>me.</HI>—Be∣hold
me then possessed of three thousand a
year, and doubt whether I have thrown
myself at my Eliza's feet.—Yes, Rains∣ford,
I flew to Lady Beverley's; and, hav∣ing
the good fortune to find Miss Mont∣fort
alone, poured out my whole soul be∣fore
her.—But guess my confidence in
her affection, when I did not, till her lips
had ratified the dear confession of her love,
declare to her my increase of riches. It
seemed, I thought, rather to mortify her;
and she was evidently charmed that, by
my not disclosing it before, it had given
her an opportunity of evincing the sinceri∣ty
of her affection. Dear girl! my whole
life, devoted to a return of thy goodness,
would be insufficient to accomplish it.—Lady
Beverley is so obliging as to appear
much pleased with the alliance, and a few
days will compleat my happiness.—Do,
my Lord, quit those groves and rivulets
which, I am sure, must have grown wea∣ry
of your sighs; come and be a witness
of my joys: your heart is too good not to
<PB N="53" REF="52"/>
bear a part in them.—Lucy Montfort
enquires for you; can you refuse to come
and lessen <HI>her sorrows,</HI> if you are deaf to
the entreaty of heightening <HI>my enjoyments?</HI></P>
<P>As for Caroline, I should be sorry if
the remembrance of the faithless mistress
should destroy the respect due to the widow
of him to whom I owe my fortune, and,
what is infinitely dearer me, my Eliza.
I have therefore, insisted on her accepting
five hundred a year, and a pretty little
house enough in the town of D—,which
fell to me by my uncle's death.
She professes gratitude; but it is a virtue,
and as such, never could find entrance in
<HI>her</HI> breast.</P>
<P>Adieu, Rainsford; suffer me to entreat
you to be present at my nuptials, and ac∣company

<P>WELL, Maria, the Marquis is at
length arrived. He is perpetually here,
and has found the method to make the com∣pany
of the most agreeable man in the
world unpleasing.—My friend, he
talks to me of love—Ah, how I hate
the subject!—Who can appear eloquent
after Sir George Ashby, or touch the heart
<HI>he</HI> knew to charm?—My brother too
is warm in his friend's commendation:
and if the utmost elegance of person
and conversation can deserve his praises,
they are well bestowed.</P>
<P>The amiable Sir George has left Eng∣land,
and left it even without seeing Lady
Ashby.—He was too much dejected to
see the mother he had offended; and could
not revisit those scenes where he first be∣came
<PB N="55" REF="54"/>
acquainted with his Emilia, without
emotion.</P>
<P>Maria, how unjust your Harriet, when
she accused Miss Lesley!—I have wept
Sir George Ashby's inconstancy—but
the innocent Emilia fell a martyr to his
love.—Captain Bevill, urged by her
ladyship's intreaties, and his own friend∣ship,
accompanies the mourning Ashby.</P>
<P>Can you excuse so much of this subject?
My pen, as if it caught the infection from
its mistress, dwells with pleasure on his
name,—Maria, teach me to hate the
dear encroacher, place every error in the
strongest view, but take care, my friend,
one virtue does not veil them all.</P>
<P>Still this Marquis.—Indeed I will not
see him.—What can he want with me?—My
Ashby taught me that men are cruel
and inconstant: and once convinced,</P>
<Q><PB N="56" REF="55"/>
<L>“That, in love's ritual, we shall never find,</L>

<P>STILL Rainsford, in expectation of
the happy morn, how provoking these
lawyers! Not all my entreaties can rouze
their stupidity; and they settle the deeds
with as much caution and composure as if
I were going to marry my grandmother.
Eliza laughs at my impetuosity, and I dare
not hint a suspicion that she too regrets the
delay.—The ladies however, are solicitous
to amuse me (good souls!) while I receive
all their assiduities with the <HI>hauteur</HI> and ma∣jesty
of the grand Signior.—These ne∣cessary
delays, Rainsford, give a man infi∣nite
importance. Then I lay all the blame
upon Eliza. “What occasion for writings?
my whole estate is your's.” I then throw
her a <HI>carte blanche</HI>—pretend to be exceed∣ingly
out of humour—swear at the scoun∣drels—while
the poor girl says the kindest
<PB N="59" REF="58"/>
things to dispel my chagrin—it vanishes
in a moment, and I press the attractive
charmer to my heart.</P>
<P>Though this assumed pettishness may to
you appear the most errant folly; yet, let
me tell thee, it is a source of inconceivable
pleasure to thy friend. There would be no
supporting the delay without it.—How∣ever,
Charles, I will endeavour to atone
the former part of this letter, by relating
the prettiest adventure—quite in your own
stile too, your shades, your brooks, your
flower-enamelled meads.</P>
<P>Know then that, on Tuesday last, Lady
Beverley and Lucy Montfort left Brook-Street,
and in a chaise and four set off for
Lady Beverley's seat at Beaufort Hall, fol∣lowed
by your Edmond and his Eliza.
The journey was delightful. Could it be
otherwise, in <HI>tête á tête</HI> with the loveliest
woman in the world?</P>
<P>About ten miles from Beaufort Hall, the
wheel of our chaise flew off. My Eliza
<PB N="60" REF="59"/>
was alarmed, and the postillion, fortu∣nately
discovering a small thatched cottage,
within a few yards of us, I supported her
thither in my arms.</P>
<P>We found the good man and his wife,
like Baucis and Philemon, happy in each
other, and surveying, with pleased atten∣tion,
the infant amusements of two bloom∣ing
children. The honest pair gave us the
warm welcome of social hospitality, and, re∣commending
my lovely charge to their care,
I returned to look after the chaise. The
servants assured me it could not be well re∣paired,
and that if we ventured further in
it, we were liable to more dangerous acci∣dents.</P>
<P>You may easily imagine how disagreea∣ble
this delay, but it was unavoidable, and
I was obliged to send to the next town
(about five miles distant) for a fresh equi∣page.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60"/>
At my return to the cottage, I found
my Eliza with a smiling cherub on either
knee, listening to their innocent prattle,
while the woman of the house was busily
preparing her frugal repast.</P>
<P>“Harcourt,” said the sweet girl, I find,
“by what I can gather from these little
chatterers, that they are the grand chil∣dren
of our good hostess.—Their mo∣ther
lives near: shall we accompany
them home? Surely there is something
very interesting in these little innocents!”</P>
<P>I readily agreed to the proposal, and
with the old woman's permission, we fol∣lowed
our pretty guides.</P>
<P>We had not proceeded far, ere we
reached a cottage, most romantically seat∣ed
on the declivity of a hill.—You
know, Rainsford, I have no hand at the
picturesque; your lively imagination, there∣fore,
must supply the deficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="61"/>
The melodious warblings of the fea∣thered
songsters, the freshness of the air,
the rural beauty of the situation, inspired
inconceivable delight;</P>
<Q><L>“For nature, here, wanton'd as in her prime,</L>
<L>And play'd at will her virgin fancies,</L>
<L>Wild beyond rule or art.”</L></Q>
<P>My Eliza was never more enchanting,
never so tender; and, in this sweet retreat,
we exchanged mutual vows of everlasting
love.</P>
<P>“My Eliza,” said I, “how delightful
that arbour! the jasmine and honey∣suckle
seem ambitious to outvie each o∣ther,
and put on their gayest beauties to
attract yon roving butterfly.”</P>
<P>“A pretty pastoral speech!—On my
my word, Harcourt, you want but a flock,
and a sheep-hook, to be the prettiest Co∣rydon
in the country,” and the Sylvan pen
<PB N="63" REF="62"/>
of rural lovers, that every tree may record
Eliza's charms.”</P>
<P>By this time we had reached the arbour,
and were entering it, when Eliza started
back, surprised at the appearance of a wo∣man,
who rose immediately and accosted
us with a politeness which would have en∣gaged
our attention, had her situation been
less interesting. “A faultless form, shap∣ed
by the hand of harmony,” an inexpres∣sible
elegance, rendered her infinitely at∣tractive.—Our
pretty friends ran to their
delighted mother, who tenderly caressed
them, and led us to her cottage.—It is
impossible to describe rhe neatness of her
habitation, or the simplicity of her dress.</P>
<P>Her rooms were hung with her own draw∣ings,
and furnished with her work: in∣deed
every thing around her seemed to bor∣row
propriety and grace from its lovely
mistress.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="63"/>
Eliza related our accident, and I inform∣ed
her of the happiness I expected.</P>
<P>She fixed her eyes upon me, and sud∣denly
starting up, under pretence of look∣ing
out of the window, endeavoured to
conceal her emotion.</P>
<P>My Eliza followed her, begged to know
the reason of her tears, assured this
charming afflicted of her fondest friendship,
and of the interest she took in her con∣cerns.</P>
<P>The lovely mourner pressed my Eliza's

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>From the same to the same.
Dear Rainsford,</OPENER>
<P>IF you possess an equal share of curiosi∣ty
with your friend, you will own your∣self
obliged to him for the earliest accounts
of the fair cottager.</P>
<P>Eliza went to see her last Thursday, but
I was not permitted to be of the party.</P>
<P>Clarinda received her with the highest
pleasure, thanked her for her generous
friendship, which she acknowledged her∣self
unable to return, but by disclosing her
motives for this close retirement. She de∣sired
I might accompany her in the ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
visit, and she would relate her history;
<PB N="67" REF="66"/>
conscious that, though prudence might
condemn, Miss Montfort and Colonel Har∣court,
judging from their own hearts,
would approve her conduct. Eliza staid
with her above an hour, and fixed the
next morning for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he recital.</P>
<P>We set out very early, and found the
amiable Clarinda instructing her lovely
children. She desired we would excuse her
absence for a short time, as it was her in∣variable
rule, to spend three hours, every
morning, in the improvement of her little
ones; a regulation which she resolved ne∣ver
to infringe. In this charming spot it
were impossible we should want amuse∣ment,
every object conveyed pleasure,
and we wandered for some time in the
sweet Elysium.</P>
<P>In a covered walk, leading to the house,
we met Clarinda, who came in search of
us. She slightly apologized for her ab∣sence,
and, after some indifferent conver∣sation,
<PB N="68" REF="67"/>
we requested the performance of
her promise. She blushed, but confessed
she had no claim to our friendship till she
had disclosed her secret; and if we then
thought her unworthy of it, she should
have the satisfactory assurance, that she
had not maintained our partiality by dis∣guise.</P>
<P>We seated ourselves beneath a spread∣ing
oak, and the lovely Clarinda related
her artless tale.</P>
<P>“MY parents formerly possessed an
estate, which, though it could not raise
them to luxurious affluence, afforded the
gratification of every reasonable desire.”</P>
<P>“Naturally ambitious, they were not
contented with their lot, and infinitely
exceeded their income. One extrava∣gance
prepared them for another, and
every repeated excess weakened resist∣ance.”</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68"/>
“Convinced, at last, that a longer con∣tinuance
in this fatal course, would en∣tirely
deprive them of subsistence, they
collected the remains of their shattered
fortune, and intended settling in some
country village.”</P>
<P>“Chance directed them to this rural
spot; it caught the youthful fancy, and,
at my pressing solicitation, they bought
the farm.”</P>
<P>“My father determined to devote his
hours to husbandry, while my mother
spent her time between houshold oecono∣my
and her daughter's education.”</P>
<P>“I was then twelve years of age. Eve∣ry
scene was new; and I rambled from
field to field, as inclination directed;
played with the bleating lamb, and
thought my happiness unbounded.”</P>
<P>“Four years passed in this delightful
calm, when, returning home one even∣ing
<PB N="70" REF="69"/>
later than usual, my father chid me
for delay, and told me they had a young
nobleman at the cottage, who had met
with an unfortunate accident, and by a
fall from his horse was rendered incapa∣ble
of pursuing his journey; adding,
that he had sent his servants to a neigh∣bouring
village, as his moving might
be dangerous.”</P>
<P>“My Mother never left his room; and
I prepared every medicine, and assisted
her as much as possible, without enter∣ing
the chamber.”</P>
<P>“He recovered much sooner than we
expected, and in less than a fortnight
ventured down stairs. It was then I
first saw him.—Ah! my friends, an
emotion, till then unknown, interested
me in his fate, and from that moment
my life seemed to depend on his reco∣very.”</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="70"/>
“He was surprised at my appearance;
wondered such charms were</P>
<Q><L>—Born to blush unseen,</L>
<L>And waste their sweetness on the desart air.”</L></Q>
<P>“My parents now resumed their do∣mestic
cares, and we were inseparable.
He directed my taste in drawing, read
to me, and by his melodious voice and
agreeable manner, every subject assumed
fresh beauties. Our evening rambles
were delightful, he vowed eternal friend∣ship,
and I was too artless to disguise
the pleasure this assurance gave me.
Every field wore fresher verdure at his
approach, while every prospect disco∣vered
ten thousand charms, till then
unknown.”</P>
<P>“I gave myself up to these delightful
sensations without reserve, nor blushed
to own the innocent partiality.”</P>
<P>“My friend rewarded my parents for
<PB N="72" REF="71"/>
their trouble, and agreed for his board
till his health was perfectly re-establish∣ed.
How unnecessary the feint, while
a blooming countenance contradicted
his pretensions!”</P>
<P>“One evening my father congratulated
me on the conquest of a neighbouring
farmer's son, from whom he had just
received proposals of marriage.”</P>
<P>“The young man is amiable,” said he,
“and my Clarinda, ever obedient to her
parents, will not refuse compliance.”</P>
<P>“My friend appeared embarrassed; he
fixed his intelligent eyes upon my face,
as if ambitious to discover every emoti∣on
of my heart.”</P>
<P>“I begged my father to allow me a few
hours for consideration, before I returned
a decisive answer.”</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72"/>
“The request, he said, was reasonable;
but, my dear girl,” continued he, you
“are now of an age to marry: your mo∣ther
and myself cannot live long, and
we wish to see you settled.”</P>
<P>“I curtsied and withdrew, flew to an
arbour where I had oftened listened to
my friend's discourse, and gave vent to
my tears.”</P>
<P>“In my return to the house, I met this
amiable friend, his arms folded, and the
perfect picture of despair.”</P>
<P>“My own sorrows vanished at the
sight, or gave place to a concern for his
apparent dissatisfaction. I ran to him,
but was unable to speak. He gazed on me
for some moments with the most flatter∣ing
tenderness, then seizing my trem∣bling
hand, he pressed it to his heart.”</P>
<P>“My Clarinda,” said he, “how cruel
<PB N="74" REF="73"/>
my situation!—and, with a deep sigh,
hurried from me.”</P>
<P>“I saw him not again that evening,
and the next morning when we were all
assembled at breakfast, I declared my
aversion to the thoughts of marriage;
begged my parents to indulge their
daughter, and they should find her in
all things else ever obedient to their
will.”</P>
<P>“My noble friend seemed rejoiced at
the declaration, and the liveliest trans∣port
revelled in his eyes.—My father
too kindly assured me he never would
controul my inclinations; and happi∣ness
was again restored to our little
circle.”</P>
<P>“Our rambles were more frequent than
usual: we carried our books to the ar∣bour,
and I employed myself with my
needle, while this tender friend ennobled
<PB N="75" REF="74"/>
my heart with examples of heroism, or
softened it with tales of love, and each
recital inforced conviction of our mutual
sentiments.”</P>
<P>“But why, my friends, do I dwell
with such pleasure on the avowal of a
guilty passion?—Can Colonel Harcourt,
can Miss Montfort maintain a friendship
for the unwedded woman who owns her∣self
a mother, nor can complain of hav∣ing
been deceived?”</P>
<P>“The Marquis, alarmed at his son's
long absence, wrote to him at the villa;
my friend had sent his servants there,
with orders to bring his letters to our
cottage. He immediately answered his
father's letter, and gave an account of
his accident, with a promise of being
soon in town. Unfortunately, the mes∣senger
he had sent, informed the Mar∣quis
of his son's habitation, and gave a
circumstantial description of the family.”</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75"/>
“A girl about seventeen, if beautiful as
the man described her, must certainly
have great influence with his Fortescue.
He trembled at the idea of a dispropor∣tionate
marriage, and was alarmed for
the cottager's peace.”</P>
<P>“The Marquis ordered his chaise, and,
conducted by this faithless servant, ar∣rived
in the evening at our peaceful ha∣bitation.”</P>
<P>“We were at supper when he entered.—Judge,
my friends of our conster∣nation.”</P>
<P>“He staid but a few minutes, and in∣sisted
on my lover's accompanying him
to town.”</P>
<P>“It was in vain to refuse, we parted
without the power of taking a fond
farewell; and our eyes were the only
vouchers of eternal constancy.”</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76"/>
“Every post brought letters from my
noble lover, which breathed the very
soul of tenderness; and some months
after our affection was encreased by the
most endearing cement.”</P>
<P>Here the sweet girl shed a flood of tears,
and fondly embraced her twin prattlers.
The little innocents wondering at their
mother, jumped upon her knee; and,
with the corner of their frocks, wiped off
the pearly drops. Delighted with this art∣less
testimony of their love,</P>
<Q><L>“Her face still combating with smiles and tears.”</L></Q>
<P>she seated them on the grass, and thus re∣sumed
her narrative.</P>
<P>“Soon after this, the Marquiss died—and,
when I expected to see this tender
lover at my feet, imagine, if you can,
my sufferings at receiving the following
letter.”</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="77"/>
“HOW can I submit to give my
sweet friend an account which, I am
convinced, must sensibly affect her? O,
my angel! my more than wife! summon
all your resolution.—Scorn, despise, de∣test
your pusillanimous lover—but grieve
not that we meet no more.—The man
my love, who would willingly part with
life to ensure your happiness, is himself
reduced to wound it.—Could my Cla∣rinda
have beheld the Marquis on the
bed of death, have seen the supplicating
hand, or heard the parental command,
like her Fortescue, she must have sunk
beneath the trial.—Her tender heart,
formed in the same mould, awake to
the same pleasures, and sensible of the
same afflictions, must like his have yield∣ed,
and by a fatal oath have made a
parent easy, at the expence—my God!
at the expence of each, fair bloom∣ing
prospect of felicity.—My
love, we meet no more.—Farewell, fare∣well,
for ever.—Believe thy Fortescue
<PB N="79" REF="78"/>
shares all thy sorrows—Ah, more than
shares them; he feels all thy grief.—How
are our dear little ones?—My an∣gel,
how difficult to conquer the lover
and the father! Each attempt to break
the sweet connexion but stronger binds
the tie.—I shall send frequently for our
children, and in their sweet society, and
opening beauties, still see their lovely
mother, whose interest in this heart,
neither time, nor absence, can efface,
and who will be ever dear, to her con∣stant</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>“FORTESCUE.”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>“My affliction was too poignant to be
endured, and I was for some weeks con∣fined
to my bed. Maternal love still
bound me to the world. My Fortescue's
<PB N="80" REF="79"/>
children were inconceivably dear to me,
and I resolved to spare no expense in
their education. This generous man has
amply provided for us, and inclosed a
deed of settlement, for five hundred
pounds a year.—I bought this little cot∣tage,
and for these six years past can
boast of perfect happiness.”</P>
<P>“He sends for the children frequently:
and you cannot imagine the pleasure I
take in preparing them for their visit,
or my ambition to unfold the opening
thought, and make some new improve∣ment
against the returning day: while
my Fortescue, obliged by this cruel
oath, neither to write to, or see me, de∣lights
to teach the little prattlers some
pretty lesson, some soft message of eter∣nal
love, which, while they repeat, I
press them in my arms, and snatch their
father's kisses from their lips.”</P>
<P>“Thus, my friends, we live, we love
<PB N="81" REF="80"/>
at second hand: and if our pleasures are
not so tumultuous, they are infinitely
more delightful than the transports of
successful love.”</P>
<P>The sweet girl might have talked for
ever, we were not disposed to interrupt
her.</P>
<P>She arose, and talking Eliza's hand,—“Can
you, Madam, still think I deserve
your friendship?”</P>
<P>My angel embraced her, and assured her
of her fond regard.</P>
<P>We pressed her to give us the pleasure
of her company at H—, and I saw
the proposal was not disagreeable to her—as
she might make London in the way,
and fix her children's tutors.</P>
<P>Now Rainsford, what think you of our
amiable cottager? the greatest part of the
<PB N="82" REF="81"/>
world would condemn her; but shall we
accuse a failing which offers so soft an ex∣cuse?—I
will not search too deeply. Cla∣rinda
is sensible, modest, polite; and if she
fell, she doubtless erred from ignorance.</P>
<P>You are greatly obliged to me for this
packet, since it has robbed me of so much
time from the company of my dear Eliza.
But her smiles shall efface the remembrance
of the painful hour.—Rainsford, I fly to

<HEAD>LETTER XXXVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss Lucy Montfort, to Miss Charlotte Watson.</OPENER>
<P>I KNOW my dear Charlotte takes so
large a part in all that concerns her friends,
that my sister's happiness will give her the
sincerest pleasure.</P>
<P>My last informed you, that fortune had
for once reconciled love with honour,
and was to lead them last Tuesday to the
temple of Hymen, in the form of Ed∣mond
Harcourt.</P>
<P>The bride and bridegroom were in white
for the day, the next was to see them reas∣sume
the sable garb, which custom has
rendered necessary to respect.</P>
<P>I flattered myself with the pleasure of
our society being agreeably encreased by
<PB N="84" REF="83"/>
Lord Charles Rainsford. Colonel Har∣court
pressed him much for that purpose;
but the plea he urged was, indeed, too
good a one to allow a renewed application.
It would but have revived the remembrance
of all his sorrows, in reminding him of
the scene he so lately passed in joy and tri∣umph
with his Delia. His place, there∣fore,
was supplied by an old acquaintance
of my brother's; more elegant in person
than Lord Charles, but of a mind less amia∣ble.—Let
me see if I can give you any
idea of him.</P>
<P>The well known Augustus Richmond
then, is much above the common size ra∣ther
thin than otherwise, but astonishingly
well formed. His face is long, his com∣plexion
extremely good, and his mouth
and teeth beautiful to a degree. His nose
aquiline; his eyes rather large, and of a
dark hazle; a prodigious quantity of the
finest auburn hair, which he is too fond of
to disguise with powder in the country:
<PB N="85" REF="84"/>
add to all this, an easy elegance of man∣ners;
an animated expression in his counte∣nance;
lively wit in his conversation; and
you must own, that even the most con∣summate
vanity must leave him a divinity.</P>
<P>Who can wonder that, left in possession
of a large estate, just come from the uni∣versity,
and master of his actions, though
not of his passions, Augustus Richmond
should have “followed the multitude to do
evil;” and, hurried away by the torrent
of admiration and applause his personal
attractions gained him, should forget how
much more solid were the satisfactions of a
well regulated mind.</P>
<P>Thus, Charlotte, did those same personal
attractions, which, by prejudicing all
the world in his favour, would have ren∣dered
their love an easier acquisition, tend
only to render him despised in the end; as
they taught him to rest content with <HI>admi∣ration,</HI>
when nothing less than <HI>adoration</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="85"/>
would have been his due. The former, by
its glitter, astonished the multitude; but
the latter would have rendered him dear
only to the discerning few.</P>
<P>Talk to the thoughtless Richmond of
his faults, and he will tell you,</P>
<Q><L>“Great wits, sometimes, may gloriously offend,</L>
<L>And rise to faults, true critics dare not mend;</L>
<L>From vulgar bounds, with brave disorder part,</L>
<L>And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.”</L></Q>
<P>Talk to him of marriage, and he will
swear he loves the whole sex so well he
knows not which to select from it; and
will not, for the sake of particularizing
one, offend the rest.</P>
<P>Talk to him of religion, and he will
ask you if Caesar and Alexander were Ca∣tholics;
if Alfred, the Henry's, the Ed∣wards,
were Protestants; if the Duke
of Marlborough was a Mahometan.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86"/>
Such then is Augustus Richmond, and
such as a friend, nobody can be desirous of
his acquaintance; but as a companion, as
a visiter, every one must be charmed with
him.</P>
<P>He was dressed, (for dress is one of his
accomplishments) the day of the wedding,
in a coat almost white, with a light tint of
salmon colour, frogs the same, lined with
<HI>serge de sois</HI> of lead colour; the waistcoat
and breeches of the same silk, worked with
two chains of gold spangles thrown over
each other, and some flowers of twist,
the colour of the coat, ran carelessly over
them. I assure you nothing could be more
attractive than his appearance; except that
nameless charm, that careless elegance,
which renders Edmond Harcourt, where∣ever
he appears, the most pleasing object.
Lively before, his good fortune seems
to have thrown down all bounds to his vi∣vacity.
My sister loves him, he doats up∣on
her, and their happiness seems com∣plete.
Amidst all these joys, can I find
<PB N="88" REF="87"/>
time to sigh? Yes, my friend, the idea of
Willmott would find entrance even into
Paradise, and cast dejection there. Rich∣mond,
by his good humour, tries to keep
up my spirits; Harcourt swears my solem∣nity
has checked many of his brightest
ideas; Eliza endeavours to console me;
Lady Harriet and the fair cottager pity
me; and Lord Charles Rainsford is ex∣pected
here soon.—Ah, Charlotte!—But
they have sent for me to accompany them
upon the water. We are to land at a de∣lightful
little summer-house, in a grove
near which the feathered songsters are to
find their sweetest notes, rivalled by the
clarinets and French horns.</P>
<P>Adieu, Charlotte.—Would, with that
word, your Lucy could bid adieu to her
melancholy ideas!</P>

<OPENER>Augustus Richmond, Es{que} to Captain Bevill.</OPENER>
<P>AH! Frederick! (the first time I was
ever guilty of an ejaculation in my life)
this I owe to my confounded folly in join∣ing
the sober faces at Harcourt's wedding:
but Ashby's cursed affair hung so much up-upon
my mind, I was glad of an oppor∣tunity
to give a new turn to my ideas, by
entering upon a scene, new indeed to me.</P>
<P>You are going now, with a share of asto∣nishment,
to ask what strange adventure
presented itself? What imagination can
suggest an idea which has not been realized
in the thoughtless round which has ever en∣gaged
the gay Richmond? Heigh-ho!
Frederick (again an ejaculation) that <HI>I</HI>
who have boldly stepped forth, the hero
of adventure and intrigue, should
<PB N="90" REF="89"/>
<Q><L>“Leave that name, at which the world grew pale,</L>
<L>To point a moral, and adorn a tale;”</L></Q>
that I should, I say, be caught in those
toils, in which I have made it my glory to
involve thousands; and that
<Q><L>“My fall was destined to a barren strand,”</L></Q>
is wonderful indeed.—But to commence
historian.</P>
<P>Willing to amuse myself in passing
through a country with which I was before
exceedingly pleased, I began my rout
through Burgundy. Frederick, if you was
never in that delightful province, during
their vintage, you have not yet visited the
region where nature has been most profuse∣ly
lavish of her favours. Happy Burgun∣dians!
since, in your peaceful vallies,
content and plenty seem to flourish, as na∣tives
of the fruitful soil. Happy, that
on your well cultivated hills, the labour of
<PB N="91" REF="90"/>
the husbandman, is less conspicuous than
his enjoyments.</P>
<P>I was just contemplating these advanta∣ges,
heightened by the beauties of the set∣ting
sun; when the postillion stopped to
inform me that it was impossible to proceed
to the town I intended, as one of the horses
was unable to go above a mile farther. To
reproach the poor devil, would have been
useless: and as I saw a cottage about two
fields distant, I bent my steps thither; not
doubting shelter for the night. Ah! Fre∣derick,
the most inclement skies had been
less pernicious than the fair sun that now
greeted my approach. Youth, beauty,
wit, good-humour, and accomplishments,
with all the nameless graces, to which the
soul of man has ever-yielded itself captive,
were here fixed to prove, that Richmond
had a heart to bestow, and that <HI>that</HI> heart
was destined for the sweet Lavinia. It is
evident they are English. I am not yet to
learn, that birth cannot be disguised by ob∣scurity,
<PB N="92" REF="91"/>
and that merit, such as my Lavi∣nia's,
cannot be born the inhabitant of a
cottage: but to whom that merit really
owes its origin, I am ignorant. That I
love her, and that my happiness depends
on hers, is beyond a doubt: can I then
long remain in uncertainty? No, Frede∣rick;
a post or two shall inform you of
the success of my enquiries; and if her birth
proves equal to what my fond imagination
paints it, I shall be proud to raise her to
that sphere of life her beauties were designed
to embellish.—Adieu, Bevill: though

<OPENER>From the same to the same.</OPENER>
<P>THY friend, Frederick, was not mis∣taken
in his conjectures. Could he be so,
when elegance was stampt on every word
Lavinia uttered, and every graceful action
declared her noble birth?—My sweet
girl then is of a Scotch family, and the
daughter of Lord—, who died a rebel
to his king and country.—His estate was
confiscated, and his widow and child, with
a narrow income, retired to grace a cot∣tage.—Here,
Frederick, they might have
lived unknown, and buried in obscurity
that beauty, and those accomplishments,
which could have taught the haughtiest
monarch to abdicate his throne, and own
Lavinia's smile o'erpaid the loss of empire.
But your friend's good genius conducted
him hither. Prithee, Bevill, seek out thy
<PB N="94" REF="93"/>
kindred mind; for, however we may boast
of our insensibility, and glory in indiffer∣ence,
believe thy Richmond, the Stoic ne∣ver
yet was blessed. “Joy flies monopo∣lists;”
and in the soil of virtuous love,
selicity delights to blossom.</P>
<P>“Bless me!” you cry,</P>
<Q><L>“Is this the gallant, gay Augustus,</L>
<L>That dear perfidious?”</L></Q>
<P>Upon my soul, Lavinia, nothing but
charms like thine could work the reforma∣tion.
Prithee, Bevill, be not malicious;
declare my fair one is a Hebe, some per∣fect
divinity, that, charmed by the all-at∣tractive
Richmond, flies to. Venus, and
borrows the powerful Cestus: swear too,
he made a stout resistance, till at length,
fatigued with indisputed sway, this con∣quering
Jupiter suffered himself in turn to
be subdued.</P>
<P>You desire me to exert my skill in paint∣ing,
and send you a portrait of those
charms, matchless indeed, if they could
<PB N="95" REF="94"/>
touch your Richmond's heart. Now dost
thou really imagine the transported, impe∣tuous
Augustus, though with eyes constant∣ly
rivetted on that blooming countenance,
can paint one charming feature?—But ab∣solutely,
Bevill, thy request had been very
pretty, and very much in character from
a Zeno, or a Methusalah. Pray, my
good sober friend, how many hundred
years has the idol of your heart basked in
the smiles of felicity?</P>
<P>In a few weeks I hope to be supremely
happy; shall bring my fair partner to
London; and, with such an excuse, fear
not your raillery. As your friend has al∣ways
been distinguished for gaiety, for wit,
and for pleasure, so, in future times, when
men of fashion shall no longer blush at
conjugal fidelity, and wish to select the
fond, the affectionate, the happy husband,
they will point to</P>

<P>IT is with pleasure I inform your Lady∣ship,
that our tour has been even of more
service to amiable Sir George, than we could
have expected—his illness in Italy (which
knowing the excess of Lady Ashby's mater∣nal
love, I did not dare sooner to disclose)
though violent while it lasted, seems to
have in some measure restored tranquility
to his mind.</P>
<P>In the height of his fever, he raved in∣cessantly
of his Emilia, and now frequent∣ly
mentions her; but he talks of her, as
of a pure angelic spirit, or Being of ce∣lestial
race.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to engage him in
some slight attachment, some pleasing fro∣lic,
which too light to sink into the heart,
<PB N="97" REF="96"/>
might rouze its dormant feelings: but the
attempt is vain. Shew him a fine woman,
she but reminds him of Emilia: carry
him into the society of wits, of <HI>belles esprit,</HI>
and he discovers some feint traces of his
Emilia: lead him to the more attractive
fair ones, where wit is tempered with dis∣cretion,
and beauty heightened by mo∣desty;
where softness is refined by senti∣ment,
and vivacity endeared by sensibility—it
is there his Emilia shines▪</P>
<P>He delights in solitary rambles, in which
I am his only companion. He plucks the
freshest rose-buds, and says, “My Bevill,
they boast the blooming beauties of Emilia—as
bright, almost as transient.”</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, Sir George Ashby some∣times
gives vent to his melancholy: but
in his gayer hours, he talks with pleasure
of returning to London, of seeing your
Ladyship, and revisiting his old associates;
but Lady Harriet seems banished from his
remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97"/>
In one of our excursions I ventured to
mention her, and hinted how much you
wished the alliance.</P>
<P>“Ah, Frederick,” said he, would I
“could oblige Lady Ashby!” but still
doating on Emilia—How poor a present
were this hand! My heart is fixed on
her! she is my sweet companion; and
imagination shews some emblem of
her lovely form in every pleasing object.—Thy
friend, my Bevill, must either
retain his hopeless passion, or once freed,
can never prove again the fading pleasure.”</P>
<P>I fear, Madam, we must give up our
flattering hopes. He seems averse to mar∣riage:
his Emilia was formed by nature to
enchant, and time alone can dissipate his
woes.</P>
<P>Sir George Ashby is the universal fa∣vourite
in every place he visits. The
<PB N="99" REF="98"/>
young nobility are all assiduous to culti∣vate
his friendship; but he politely rejects
their offers.—The ladies too are charm∣ed
with the amiable Englishman; and try
every female art to attract attention. They
accuse him of insensibility. “So young—so
handsome—so indifferent!”
But my friend passes unwounded their
smiles and pointed glances.</P>
<P>We shall be with you soon after this
letter. To restore Sir George Ashby to his
friends, with recovered serenity, will be
the highest pride of your Ladyship's</P>
<P>Most obedient,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLI.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Miss Lucy Montfort to Miss Charlotte Watson.</OPENER>
<P>MY dear Miss Watson, instruct your
friend,—teach her to refuse these pressing
solicitations.—Lady Harriet, Clarinda, even
Harcourt and his Eliza, combine against
me, and are warm in Lord Charles Rains∣ford's
praises.—I own with them his Lord∣ship
amiable; his mind humane; while
the tenderest affection dwells in his heart,
and points to social happiness.</P>
<P>Cut off from joy in the full blossom of
his expectations, I have learnt to pity him—But,
Ah, Charlotte, can your Lucy love
again?—yet so they have decreed it.—Why,
my friend, may I not prove the sin∣gle
state, which, though not highly blest,
is yet exempt from misery, knows not the
<PB N="101" REF="100"/>
anguish of contempt, the torments of ne∣glected
love?</P>
<P>Since my last, our little coterie has been
agreeably encreased. How shall I intro∣duce
our new acquaintance, any otherwise
than by informing you that the Marquis
of—, an admirer of Lady Harriet Som∣ners,
called at H—, in the way to his
feat, to see her Ladyship?</P>
<P>We were all assembled in the library,
and Richmond entertaining us with infinite
pleasantry, when our fair cottager came
running to us, with a nest of wood-pigeons
she had brought from a neighbouring
grove.</P>
<P>She started on entering the room, and
the birds fell from her trembling hand.</P>
<P>The Marquis ran to her, and threw him∣self
at her feet.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101"/>
“My Clarinda!”—“My Fortescue!”
was all they could distinctly utter; and he
sustained the almost lifeless beauty in his
arms.</P>
<P>Our attention was drawn from the lo∣vers
by Lady Harriet, who rose with majes∣tic
loveliness; and,</P>
<Q><L>“Supremely happy in th'awakened power,</L>
<L>Of giving joy,”</L></Q>
<P>went up to the astonished Marquis. “My
friend,” said she, “you have often assured
me this hand is at my disposal: now e∣vince
the sincerity of your professions.—I
give it to Clarinda; and be assured that
providence, by this heaven-directed
meeting, has destined you for each other,
and cancels the guilty oath.”</P>
<P>She took Clarinda's hand, and putting it
into the amiable Fortescue's, “my friends,”
added she, “give me the satisfaction of
hearing your lips confirm my wishes.”</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102"/>
The Marquis gazed on Lady Harriet
with the most grateful admiration, and once
more throwing himself on his knees, vowed
to make the fair cottager his wife. We
took the earliest opportunity of leaving the
room, and it being a charming morning,
we wandered in the wood till joined by
Fortescue, Clarinda and the children. The
delighted parents seemed to vie with each
other in caressing their little innocents.</P>
<P>Clarinda had informed the Marquis of our
first acquaintance; and he was lavish in ac∣knowledging
his obligations for our friend∣ship.
—Harcourt insisted on his remaining
with us; and the day following was to con∣firm
their union.—Lord Charles Rainsford
comes. He requests a few minutes conver∣sation.—Ah,
my prophetic heart!</P>
<P>In Continuation.</P>
<P>MY God! to be mistress of the world, I
would not prove again the mournful inter∣view.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="103"/>
He accosted me with an air of tenderness—of
expectation—an air which seemed to
say, “My Lucy, make me happy—yet
think not I forget the lovely Delia.”—He
pressed me to make a double wedding.</P>
<P>Ah, Charlotte! how much like Will∣mott's
his melodious accents!</P>
<P>My heart, already softened by the dear
recollection of those tender vows, (alas! too
fond for permanence); could I do other∣wise
than weep?</P>
<P>Rainsford caught me in his arms, and
kissed off the flowing tears.—“My Lucy,
what means this concern? Ah, how ami∣able
this tender weakness!—Your lover,
my angel respects your sorrows, and had
rather forfeit happiness, than recall the
sad remembrance.”</P>
<P>I disengaged myself from him.—“Leave
me, my Lord—”</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="104"/>
The rising sigh prevented utterance; and
I could say no more. He obeyed; but</P>
<Q><L>“Gazed, as he slowly withdrew.”</L></Q>
<P>Soon after he was gone, I took up the
pen I had lately employed in writing to my
Charlotte, and sent the following billet:</P>
<P>“I blush that Lord Charles Rainsford
has been the witness of his Lucy's weak∣ness,
and discovered how little consist¦ent
her love and reason—Ah, my
friend!—the subject—Your elegant ex∣pressions—and
a thousand nameless
charms, recalled the once loved Will∣mott.
If this ill-placed tenderness has
sunk me below your notice, my Lord,
this heart does not easily receive, nor can
it lightly eradicate impressions! but if
you still love me, I am yours.—I could
wish the ceremony postponed for a few
weeks. Will you, my amiable friend,
in this request oblige your</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>“LUCY?”</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<PB N="106" REF="105"/>
<P>I received an answer, filled with the warm∣est
gratitude, and vows of eternal love. He
will with pleasure wait my time, but flat∣ters
himself his Lucy will make allowance
for a lover's impatience. My friends ap∣pear
delighted with, as they kindly term
it, my obliging compliance.</P>
<P>Lady Harriet leaves us immediately after
Clarinda's marriage, as she imagines her
presence may check Fortescue's joy. She
goes to London; but has promised to give
us her company at my nuptials.—Ah,
Charlotte, with what different emotions
do I look forward to that time! How can
I dispel ideas I have so long entertained;
how forget my Willmot? Yet, Rainsford,
I scorn to be unjust. This is the last time
my pen shall mention Henry; nor shall
you receive the hand till you wholly pos∣sess
the heart of</P>

<OPENER>Sir George Ashby to Captain Bevill.</OPENER>
<P>LISTEN with astonishment, Bevill, to
the narration of an accident which will per∣haps
constitute the future felicity of your
friend.</P>
<P>I was indulging my melancholy, on one
of the finest mornings you ever beheld, in
a retired part of Kensington Gardens,
when raising my eyes (which had for some
time been bent upon the ground) at the
sound of footsteps, I saw Lady Harriet,
the once loved Harriet, gazing at me with
a look of the most tender concern.—With
an involuntary emotion I sei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed her hand,
and pressing it between mine—“Ah,
Lady Harriet,” said I, “is it possible
you can behold the faithless Ashby with∣out
detestation?”</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="107"/>
Surprized at my address, she fainted in
my arms.</P>
<P>Accusing myself for my indiscretion, I
looked wildly round for help, and perceiv∣ing
Lady Harriet's woman who was at∣tending
her at a little distance, I gave her
my hat and bid her run with it to the
nearest water: in the mean time I kissed
those beauteous lips a hundred times, which
had so often confessed they loved me—those
dear eyes, which owned they loved
me still.</P>
<P>The water succeeded as I expected; but
endeavouring by averting her face to con∣ceal
her blushes—“Ah, Sir George,”
said she, “why this needless concern, this
cruel caution, to restore me to an exist∣ence
which I had lost with pleasure in
your arms?”</P>
<P>Apprehensive she had said too much,
she disengaged herself from my embrace,
<PB N="109" REF="108"/>
and taking hold of her maid, curtesied,
and was retiring.</P>
<P>“Hold,” said I, “my dearest Harriet;
is it so lately I have found you, and will
you punish me with the loss of your
company?”</P>
<P>I then entreated to escort her home, to
which she consented, and ordering her
coach to drive slowly, we walked by the
side of the rail, through Hyde Park. Her
spirits seemed to gain additional strength,
and she made no use of her carriage. We
parted at her door, after I had gained her
permission to attend her in the evening.</P>
<P>I flew to her before the usual hour of
visiting, and found her dressed most ele∣gantly.
Never did she appear so lovely.</P>
<P>I entered upon the subject of my incon∣stancy.
She kindly stopped me; and, in
pity for my poor Emilia, seemed to forget
<PB N="110" REF="109"/>
my crime. Charmed with her goodness,
I entreated her permission to devote the
rest of my life to a return for it.—She
generously accepted this divided heart;
and, oh Bevill, since the fatal assignation,
never has a gleam of joy found entrance
in my breast till now.—A few days will,
I hope, entirely restore that peace to Lady
Harriet, that bliss to me, which have so
long been strangers to us both; and love
will bring me to the altar, where justice
has long demanded my appearance. Time,
by banishing Emilia from my remem∣brance,
will strengthen Lady Harriet in
my heart.</P>
<P>Adieu, Bevill. May you in misfortune
ever find as firm a friend, in love as faith∣ful
a mistress, as have been found in you
and Lady Harriet, to bless your</P>

<OPENER>Miss Lennox to Mrs. Lennox.</OPENER>
<P>CONGRATULATE me, my dear
mother, that the day is passed which has
given to my amiable friend that husband
whose worthy soul seemed formed to con∣stitute
her happiness. Peace and festivity
reign throughout this house; and never
before did any little society seem so sin∣cerely
to experience</P>
<Q><L>“The soul's calm sunshine, and the heart-felt joy.”</L></Q>
<P>That society consists of the amiable Sir
George and his lovely bride: Colonel Har∣court;
the most agreeable, lively, elegant,
careless creature in the world; his wife,
and her sister; Captain Bevill, Mr. Bar∣ton,
and your humble servant.</P>
<P>To-morrow we are to set off for Sir
George Ashby's country seat, where Lord
<PB N="112" REF="111"/>
Charles Rainsford, an admirer of Miss
Montfort, is to join the party.</P>
<P>To be sure you expect from the pen of
a female, the dress of the bride and bride∣groom.</P>
<P>Sir George, then, had chosen a coat of
the most beautiful pearl colour, lined with
a white corded tabby; the waistcoat and
breeches of the same silk, worked in
bunches of flowers the colour of the coat,
tied with knots of silver spangles.</P>
<P>Lady Harriet's negligee was white lus∣tring,
the flounces of Turkey gauze, on
which were embroidered the most delightful
moss roses, tied with a ribbon of silver
spangles like Sir George Ashby's waistcoat,
which was her work. A short apron, and
the trimming of her chip hat, were done
in the same manner. Her ear-rings were
small tops of exceeding fine brilliants;
and from a diamond bow, in the middle
of a narrow velvet collar, hung a long
<PB N="113" REF="112"/>
chain of diamonds, at the botttom of
which, was her Ashby's picture, careless∣ly
fastened with the ends of a small blond
teresa, under a sprig of flowering myrtle.</P>
<Q><L>“Such their attire; but oh! no pen can trace,</L>
<L>No words can shew the beauties of each face;</L>
<L>So kind! so winning! so divinely fair!</L>
<L>Eternal youth and pleasure flourish there;</L>
<L>There all the little loves and graces meet,</L>
<L>And ev'ry thing that's soft, and ev'ry thing that's”
“sweet.”</L></Q>
<P>Do, my dear mother, persuade Mis.
Wilson to come and stay with you; for,
absolutely, this society is so bewitching I
cannot find in my heart to leave it,—or
at least, if I do leave it, I believe that said
heart of mine will take the liberty of stay∣ing
behind me.</P>
<P>Mr. Barton is so agreeable, I should real∣ly
fall in love with him if it was not for
Colonel Harcourt: and Colonel Harcourt
is so witty he would steal one's affections,
if any body could do it in Mr. Barton's
<PB N="114" REF="113"/>
presence.—Though to think of the poor
Emilia Lesley were an antidote to love,
since the tomb, not the temple of Hymen,
followed the loss of her heart.—Poor
Poor Emilia! though dead to the world, the
idea of thee will be ever cherished by the
inhabitants of this mansion; and to possess
a place in their remembrance and esteem,
is to enjoy a triumph far superior to the
common lot of happiness.—I would
have died as Emilia to have been wept like
her.</P>
<P>From so melancholy a subject as this,
it were sacrilege to let my pen return again
to characterize the jovial throng.—Yes,
my dear mother, in the midst of festivity,
the tear of pity has its charms, and cannot
fail of adding to the thankfulness we owe
that divine Being,</P>
<Q><L>“Who, with an eye of pity, views distress,</L>
<L>And thro' his wisdom only—fails to bless.”</L></Q>
