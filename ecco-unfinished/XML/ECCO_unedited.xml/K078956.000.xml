<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Court of East-India Directors, having, perhaps
industriously, involved the affairs of the Carnatic in
obscurity, by their voluminous Defence, the Author of the fol∣lowing
Work found himself obliged to deduce his accounts,
from an early period of time. To extricate the subject from
difficulty, he has connected the controversial part of the
discussion, with an authentic and impartial narrative of the
most important transactions, on the coast of Coromandel.
His arguments and reasonings are only such, as naturally
result from his facts; and his facts are founded upon the
most incontrovertible evidence, to which the Reader is
referred, at the bottom of every page.</P>
<P>The Directors, in the volumes of Original Papers, pub∣lished
under their inspection, have furnished the Author,
with authentic materials, sufficient to overset entirely the
system, which they wished to defend. He has also availed
himself of the information of other papers of EQUAL AU∣THORITY,
which a Gentleman employed by the Crown, for
some years, in a public capacity on the Coast, was pleased
to place in his hands. Private papers and documents, to∣gether
with written evidences of a PRIVATE nature, which
unveil the springs of many measures, have come into his
possession. But as his object has been, to expose PUBLIC
<PB REF="5"/>
injustice, and not to trace the delinquency of INDIVIDUALS,
he has made no use of such information. Though some
may think or, at least, allege, that public bodies, as well
as public measures, are treated with a degree of severity,
in the following Volume, the Writer cannot be accused of
harshness to private characters. Should any of the actors,
in the scene, which he has chosen to exhibit, complain of
their parts, the Author of the piece assures them and the
Public, that much of the business is concealed, behind
the curtain.</P>
<P>The labour and toil, which attended the selection of the
materials, upon which this Volume is founded, employed
a considerable portion of time. The facts and authorities
were weighed, with the most scrupulous attention to truth
and impartial justice. The relation of transactions is sup∣ported,
every where, by a cloud of witnesses; and where
the conduct of the Company is most blamed, the founda∣tion
of censure is placed, on their own records, as pub∣lished
by their Directors. In the printing, and even in the
composition, of the Work, the shortness of the time al∣lotted
to both may have been productive of errors. But
as the arrangement has not been subject to that inconveni∣ence,
it is to be hoped, the matter of fact is established,
beyond the reach of any just reply.</P>
<P>Without presumption, we trust, it may be affirmed,
that the system, which the Directors endeavoured, with so much
<PB N="4" REF="6"/>
labour and expence, to defend, has been completely over∣turned.
That they have not only failed “in refuting any
one of the heavy charges brought against them,” in
former publications relative to Tanjore; but that many
other charges equally heavy are established, on their own
evidence. That it only remains for them to retrieve their
characters, by acknowledging their errors and doing justice.
That a contrary conduct will probably remind the nation of
their solemn appeal to the Public, in their Declaration of
the 26th of March 1777. Their words were, “That could
the heavy charges brought against them be proved, those
charges would not only render them unfit to conduct
the affairs of the Company, but utterly unworthy of
every degree of public trust and confidence.” If the
charges are actually proved, the World will draw the in∣ference.</P>
<P>In the authorities, at the bottoms of the pages, the pa∣pers
published by the Directors, in their own defence, are
cited, under the title of Mr. Rous's Appendix. This ap∣pellation
was adopted merely to distinguish those papers,
from others published by the Directors. As the Court had
disavowed Mr. Rous's pamphlet, by refusing to authenticate
it, that gentleman, strictly speaking, had no <HI>legal</HI> right to
an Appendix, printed at the expence of the Company.</P>
<P>The writers, who have espoused the cause of the Di∣rectors,
are seldom alluded to, and never mentioned, in
<PB REF="7"/>
the course of the following Volume. This seeming neg∣lect
proceeded neither from any disrespect for their genius,
nor any want of attention to their labours. Their toil has
surely been rewarded, by their employers, in proportion to
the badness of their cause. With that boon they ought to
sit down contented; and to add to the account of profit,
their present escape from censure. To pursue phantoms,
through the foggy regions of romance, was no part of the
labour, which the Author imposed on himself. Truth, and
only truth, was his object; and the advocates of his oppo∣nents
are completely answered, if he has attained his end.</P>
<P>The wading through the sink of East-India corruption
and mismanagement is a task, which adds disgust to toil.
But the Author fears he has gone too far, not to go further
still. Bengal is a fruitful scene of peculation, injustice,
and even death; and the Northern Circars, though scarcely
twelve years, in our hands, present oppressions proportion∣able
to their extent and <HI>our</HI> time. The secret intrigues in
Leadenhall-Street, though less important and instructive,
than the revolutions of kingdoms, merit some attention;
and the world may chuse to be made acquainted with the
actors in the secret scenes of domestic management. These
considerations may, perhaps, induce the Author, to give a
SECOND VOLUME to the Public, in the course of a few
months.</P>

to the Year 1744.</HEAD>
<P>DURING the decline and after the fall of the Roman Empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. I</NOTE>
the western provinces received, in a certain degree, new in∣habitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu∣rope after the fall of the Ro∣mans.</NOTE>
and consequently new manners, from those vast
countries, which comprehend the northern divisions of Europe and
Asia. The fierce nations who triumphed over Rome had scarcely
brought any virtue, except valour, from home; and, therefore,
their ravages were too general and too destructive to leave any ex∣amples
of that civilization, which in some degree atones for the
desolations of war. In the midst of that barbarity, which had
cramped the liberal exertions of their minds in the north, the
invaders sat down in the regions of the south; where many ages
passed over them, without having been distinguished by any of those
improvements, which, by rendering life comfortable, enlarge the
<PB N="2" REF="11"/>
views of mankind. The peculiar opinions, which annexed every
honour to the sword, threw contempt on the arts of civil life; and
the insecurity of property prevented even avarice, which disregards
contempt, from pursuing industry and commerce, as they could
produce nothing but toil.</P>
<P>Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revival of arts and com∣merce.</NOTE> however, was not destined to remain always under that
gloomy barbarism, which had clouded its annals for near a thousand
years. The first dawn of improvement arose in Italy, where its last
ray had set. The revival of letters, in that country, was followed by
the encouragement of genius. Men becoming acquainted with the
improvements of former ages, began to transfer their discoveries to
their own times. The human mind, being softened by the acces∣sion
of knowledge, acquired a taste for the sweets of peace and the
comforts of life. Government, relaxing its habitual severity, and
laying aside its former pride, gave security to property, and some
protection to industry. A free intercourse of commerce was esta∣blished
at home; its communication with foreign states became less
obstructed; and either rivalship or imitation soon extended a degree
of the same kind of improvement to the rest of Europe.</P>
<P>A commercial intercourse had been opened between Europe and
India,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of Indian com∣merce in an∣cient times.</NOTE> in remote antiquity. The Greeks knew it, when the Persian
empire flourished; and they continued it, during the existence of
their own. The Syrians, under the Seleucidae, who were the im∣mediate
successors of Alexander, in his Asiatic conquests, brought
the manufactures of India to the western markets, through the
gulph of Persia. The Egyptians, when subject to the Ptolemies,
supplied Europe, in the same manner, by the Red Sea. The Ro∣mans
succeeded both, in their commerce, as well as in their power;
and transferred the trade of India, with the seat of their empire, to
Constantinople. During the decline of the eastern empire, the Ita∣lian
states, particularly the Venetians, engrossed the commerce of
<PB N="3" REF="12"/>
Asia. The Portuguese had the merit, by exploring a new passage
to the East,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Portu∣guese the first who found a new course to India.</NOTE> to lay open, though contrary to their inclination, that
beneficial trade to the rest of Europe. The subjects of John the
Second, after coasting the western side of Africa, doubled the Cape
of Good Hope; and Emanuel improved the plan established by his
predecessor. In the reign of the latter prince, the famous Vasco
de Gama, with four ships, penetrated, beyond the Cape, into seas
before unknown, and arrived on the coast of Malabar in 1498, about
six years after Columbus had discovered America.</P>
<P>The success of the Portuguese on the coast of India,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why they were the first.</NOTE> and the rich
cargoes which they imported from that country, raised the envy,
but did not immediately excite the imitation of the rest of Europe.
A whole century passed before those nations, who now, in a man∣ner,
engross the commerce of the East, turned their eyes to that
part of the world. The veil of secrecy, with which the Portu∣guese
had industriously covered their course to India, was not the
only cause which prevented them from having rivals in their con∣quests
as well as their commerce. The principles of navigation and
internal policy were still in their infancy in England. France was
only just emerging from the savage rudeness of its feudal system;
and the Dutch had not yet emancipated themselves from the stern
tyranny of the heirs of the house of Burgundy, strengthened by
their accession to the crown of Spain.</P>
<P>The Dutch, sensible of the advantages of an Indian commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch were the next.</NOTE>
from the success of the Portuguese, had turned their speculations to∣wards
a new and a more expeditious passage to India, than that
which the latter had found, by doubling the southern point of Africa.
They endeavoured to make their way, by the north-east, to the seas
of China and Japan; and to arrive first on those coasts, which to
<PB N="4" REF="13"/>
the Portuguese were the most remote in the East-Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Discours sur le Passage par le Nord-est de I' Europe, dans les Mers des Indes.—Grot. Annal. Le Clerc, Basnage.</NOTE> A disco∣very
of that kind would not only shorten the voyage, but diminish
its dangers; as the commerce of the Portuguese, together with the
dominion of their country, had fallen to Philip the Second, the
mortal enemy of the Dutch nation. Their attempts to find a north-east
passage were suddenly undertaken, and as suddenly laid aside.
But an accident supplied what their industry bad, in vain, endea∣voured
to acquire. A Dutch seaman, whose name was Houtman,
and who had been seized in Portugal, in the year 1594, discovered
the route of the Portuguese, by the Cape of Good Hope<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Avertissement à la tête de Recueil de Voy∣ages de la Compagnie, p. 27.</NOTE> Under
the direction of Houtman a fleet was equipped, and in the year
1596 sailed from the Texel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide Journal of this Voyage, printed a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> London, 1601.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The English nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">After them the English.</NOTE> like the Dutch, had attempted to find a new
passage to India. Before their neighbours on the continent had
turned their attention to the north-east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of the India Com∣pany.</NOTE> they had made three differ∣ent
attempts to explore a passage to Tartary and China, by the
north-west. But the lights furnished by Drake, Cavendish, and
other eminent navigators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1600.</NOTE> pointed out a more direct way to the
trade of India. Encouraged by their discoveries, several wealthy
merchants of London petitioned Queen Elizabeth for a charter em∣powering
them to undertake this trade. On the 31st of December
1600, the prayer of their petition was granted. They were erected
into a body corporate, by the stile of “The Governor and Company
of Merchants of London, trading to the East Indies.” The charter
granted a common seal: Thomas Smith, an alderman, was ap∣pointed
Governor, with twenty Directors, to be chosen annually on
the 1st of July, or six days after. They were vested with powers
<PB N="5" REF="14"/>
to make bye-laws, to export goods free from custom, for four years,
to send to India by every voyage 30,000 l. in foreign coin, provided
they brought that sum by their commerce from foreign countries.
The charter was exclusive; the Queen bound herself to grant none
to other merchants, for the space of fifteen years; but a provision
was made, that if it appeared the new Corporation should prove, in
any respect, detrimental to the Public, the charter, upon two years
warning, under the Privy Seal, should become void. The exclu∣sive
commerce, granted in the charter, extended to all places of Asia,
Africa, and America, beyond the Cape of Good Hope, and the
Streights of Magellan; and to execute the design, a joint stock of
72,000 l. was quickly subscribed and paid into the treasurer's hands.</P>
<P>This capital enabled the Company to equip and man five ships
of small burden;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first▪ ex∣pedition to In∣dia successful.</NOTE> and to send a considerable sum in money and
goods, as a trading stock, The fleet put to sea, under the command
of Captain James Lancaster; and after a tedious and sickly passage,
came to anchor in the road of Achin, in the island of Sumatra, on
the 5th of June 1602. The voyage was, however, so prosperous,
in point of commerce, that a second trading expedition, to India,
was undertaken in the year 1604, under the conduct of Sir Henry
Middleton. The success of Middleton was still greater than that of
Lancaster. But both yielded, in good fortune, to Captain Keeling,
who returned in May 1610, with three ships committed to his care,
richly laden, and without the loss of a man.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the profit derived from these voyages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But still they labour under us uncon∣veniences <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the
trade to India was still inconsiderable, and liable to great incon∣veniency.
The success of the adventurers depended entirely on
chance, on the civility of the natives, or on the address of their
officers. Without settlements to accommodate their factors, desti∣tute
of defences to protect their persons and property, they were
subject to disappointment, and exposed to insult. Other nations
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
had harbours, which they could command; forts, which they had
either built themselves, or had bought from the Indians; and even
territories, acquired by treachery or conquest. On the other hand,
the Company were so far from commanding respect abroad, that
they were ill-provided with resources at home. Though the
English nation had already exhibited a great deal of spirit, and a
considerable degree of knowledge in navigation, they had made but
little progress in the art of ship-building. The Company, during
the first ten years of their desultory commerce to Asia, had even been
obliged to purchase their ships from the <HI>Hanse</HI> Towns of Germany.</P>
<P>Though the Company laboured under these disadvantages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their com∣merce, consi∣dering the times valu∣able.</NOTE> their
profits, if compared to their capital, were very considerable; and,
considering the state of commerce in those times, an acquisition to
the wealth of the nation. Government, therefore, enlarged the
time of their charter; and, encouraged by the countenance of the
State, they themselves began to build their own ships. In the year
1609,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1609.</NOTE> they launched a ship of twelve hundred tons, in the presence
of King James, and his son the Prince of Wales. This ship,
together with two others of considerable burden, under the conduct
of Sir Henry Middleton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their quarrel with the Por∣tuguese.</NOTE> sailed for Surat; where the jealousy of the
Portuguese frustrated the intention of the voyage. Middleton made
up for his loss in trade, by a species of piracy. He seized some
rich ships belonging to the Portuguese, on the coast of Malabar;
and, steering his course to the Red Sea, plundered the trade of
Mocha, under the pretence of procuring satisfaction for damages he
had formerly sustained at that place.</P>
<P>The injustice and power of the Portuguese had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1610.</NOTE> hitherto, pre∣vented
the English from establishing themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">English, in a manner, ex∣cluded from the continent of India.</NOTE> or even from pur∣suing
commerce, with any degree of success, on the coast of Hin∣dostan.
The house of Tamerlane, who had reigned near a century
at Delhi, had uniformly encouraged foreigners to trade in their do∣minions.
<PB N="7" REF="16"/>
But, as they were possessed of no naval power, they could
not enforce their authority beyond their own shores, or prevent
hostilities at sea, between the rivals for their trade. Though in the
year 1608, the third of the reign of Jehangire, an envoy from the
Company had obtained the usual privileges of settlement and com∣merce
from that prince, they had been debarred from the advan∣tages
of both,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They defeat the Portu∣guese.</NOTE> by the intrigues of the Portuguese. Force only could
obtain justice from that jealous nation, who claimed, from their
long possession, a kind of exclusive right to the commerce of India.
Four ships of considerable burden were, therefore, put under the
command of Captain Thomas Best, a resolute officer. He arrived at
Surat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1612.</NOTE> in September 1612; and having defeated, in two actions,
the Portuguese squadron, enabled the factors of the Company to
avail themselves of the privileges, which they had obtained in the
Empire.</P>
<P>To secure the advantages obtained by the victory of Best,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1614.</NOTE> the Com∣pany
prevailed with King James the First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An ambassa∣dor sent by King James I. to the Mogul.</NOTE> to send a royal ambassa∣dor
to the court of Hindostan. The person vested with this high
character, was Sir Thomas Roe, who arrived in the end of 1614, at
Ajmere, the capital of the province of that name, where the Em∣peror
Jehangire, at that time, kept his court. But though the am∣bassador
was received with every mark of esteem by Jehangire, he
found an enemy in his son, Sultan Kurrum; to whom, as lord of
Surat, the department of redressing the grievances of the English
had been assigned. The Emperor's favour prevailed at last, in some
degree, over the prejudices of the prince. In the month of Janu∣ary
1615,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1615.</NOTE> new firmâns were obtained, for the establishment of fac∣tories
in various provinces; but they were worded with caution,
and the privileges granted, were defective and circumscribed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dow, vol. iii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="17"/>
Radical defects in the constitution of the Company at home, mis∣conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1622.</NOTE>
and even misfortune abroad, the smallness of their capital
in Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The affairs of the Company decline.</NOTE> their having no solid establishments, or fortified settle∣ments
in Asia, the want of protection from a government, which,
soon after, could not protect itself, together with the jealousy of two
powerful, and even faithless rivals in trade, the Portuguese and
Dutch, all combined to cramp, and, at length, to annihilate a com∣merce,
which, at its best, depended merely on lucky adventures.
The History of the Company, from this period forward, consists of
instances of misfortunes in trade, and instances of spirit in adventure
and seats of valour in war. Rivalled, and even ruined ashore, by the
Portuguese and Dutch, they revenged themselves of the former at sea;
but the latter, by their barbarous feverities at Amboyna, in the year
1622, put, in a manner, an end to their trade with the islands of Asia.
On the coasts of Hindostan, and even in some inland cities of that
great empire, they continued to carry on a languid commerce for
several years. The government of the Moguls had, then, arrived
at a degree of vigour, sufficient to command peace, and even justice,
between the Europeans under its protection. The advantages de∣rived
from the commerce of foreigners, had even procured for them
privileges, which had been denied to the natives.</P>
<P>It was during this untoward state of the English commerce in Asia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1636.</NOTE>
the servants of the Company obtained that establishment in Bengal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet they ob∣tain <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n esta∣blishment in Bengal.</NOTE>
which time and accident have since improved into so many and great
national advantages. Though the Portugueze had visited Bengal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>,
before it sell under the power of the Moguls, they had never esta∣blished
regular governments and garrisons in that country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, vol. ii. p. 7.</NOTE>. The
Dutch had settled there about the year 1625, in the reign of the
Emperor Jehangire<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">L' Expedition de trois Vaisseaux, tom. ii.</NOTE>. In 1636, when his son Shaw Jehan sat on
<PB N="9" REF="18"/>
the throne, one Boughton, an English surgeon, sent from Surat to
Agra, had the good fortune to cure the emperor's favourite daugh∣ter,
who laboured under an illness, which had baffled the skill of the
natives. Among other favours, Boughton was gratified with a pa∣tent,
or Dustue, for a free trade throughout the empire. Having
proceeded to Bengal, his skill in physic procured for him the friend∣ship
of the Nabob of that province; who extended the privileges
given to Boughton, to the whole English nation<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 8.</NOTE>. The Company's
servants at Surat, availing themselves of the influence of Boughton,
built a factory at Hughley, on the western branch of the Ganges,
one hundred miles from the mouth of the river.</P>
<P>But the privileges obtained by Boughton, for his countrymen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their com∣merce lost during the civil war.</NOTE>
were incapable of restoring vigour to a commerce, which had fallen
into an irrecoverable decline. Harassed abroad by European rivals,
who, from their superior advantages, could bring their imports
cheaper to market at home, the Company lost their spirit with their
success. To hasten their fate, the civil commotions, which after∣wards
terminated in the subversion of the constitution of the state,
engaged the whole attention, and employed the whole exertion of
the nation. The Dutch, availing themselves of the decline of the
Portugueze, and the distractions in England, engrossed the com∣merce
of the East; and even Cromwell, though he gained a supe∣viority
over them in war, neglected, as perhaps he understood not,
the interests of the nation in India, in a peace, the conditions of
which he dictated himself. He, however, renewed to the Company
their ancient privileges in 1657;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1657.</NOTE> but before they could avail them∣selves
of the support of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter re∣newed by Cromwell.</NOTE> his death threw the nation
back into those public distractions, from which it had emerged
but a few years before.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="19"/>
The revolution, which restored England to its ancient constitu∣tion,
brought back,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1661.</NOTE> soon after, the commerce of India to its former
channel.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New charter granted by Charles II.</NOTE> Charles the Second, though addicted to pleasure, was ca∣pable
of useful exertions, and he loved commerce. His brother, the
Duke of York, though possessed of less ability, was endued with
greater perseverance; and, by a peculiar felicity, placed his chief
amusement in commercial schemes, whilst he possessed the whole in∣fluence
of the state. Under his auspices, a new charter was issued,
on the 3d of April 1661. The animosity of the two royal brothers
against the Dutch, the manifest advantage to the revenue, as
well as to the nation, which was likely to be derived from the
commerce of India, insured the support of government to the
Company.</P>
<P>The charter which had been granted by Queen Elizabeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great privi∣leges and powers granted.</NOTE> in the
forty-third year of her reign, invested the Company with an exclu∣sive
right of commerce for fifteen years. They had been erected
into a perpetual body-politic, by a charter which they had obtained
in the seventh of James the First. In that of April 3, 1661, new
privileges were added to the old, which were all confirmed. The
Company were invested with a civil jurisdiction and a military
authority, with a power of making war or concluding peace with
the INFIDELS of India; the state reserving to itself, by this distinc∣tion,
those prerogatives, with respect to Europeans. They were
also impowered to export bullion to the amount of 150,000 l. in
every voyage, provided they re-exported foreign goods to the same
amount. The clause in the charter granted by Elizabeth was
reserved, which declared, that it should become void and of no
effect, after three years notice given, should the privileges granted
prove detrimental to the general interest of the nation. A capital of
369, 890 l. was subscribed, though only one half was paid, to derive
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
immediate advantage from privileges as extensive in themselves, as
they were liberally bestowed by the Crown.</P>
<P>Charles the Second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Company much favour∣ed by the King and Duke of York.</NOTE> having espoused the Infanta of Portugal in
1662, obtained the possession of the island of Bombay in the year
1663, as a part of the portion of that Princess. Finding that the
revenues of the place were unequal to its expence, the King ceded
it, in fee-tail, to the Company, in the twentieth year of his reign;
and, five years after, he also granted to them the island of St. He∣lena.
To this cession of territory, Government added its whole sup∣port,
in the encouragement and protection of the Company's trade.
The injuries which they had received from the jealousy of the Dutch
Company, had formed one of the ostensible reasons for entering into
the first Dutch war. The Commons, by the management of Govern∣ment,
which then was swayed by the Duke of York, addressed the
Crown, against the wrongs and indignities done to the East-India
Company. The Duke himself, who spent half his time in the bu∣siness
of commerce in the city, presided frequently at the meetings
of the Court of Directors. In short, no aid was wanting to the
prosperity of the Company, that either the assiduity of the Duke or
his influence in the state could procure.</P>
<P>The encouragement and protection of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their success raises jealou∣sies.</NOTE> joined to their
own industry, raised the Company, in outward appearance, to a state
of amazing affluence in the space of a few years. In 1680 and the
three succeeding years, the price of India stock was 360 per cent.
with proportionable dividends. Circumstances so favourable could
not fail to raise the jealousy of foreigners, and to inflame the avarice
of individuals at home. The mercantile interest and the court be∣came,
at length, divided, on a subject of so much importance. The
first were prompted, by their eagerness for gain, to invade the
exclusive rights contained in the charter; the latter, won by the
influence, and perhaps the money, of the Company, as eagerly op∣posed
their designs.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="21"/>
During the latter years of the life of Charles the Second, the vic∣tory
obtained by the court over the city, repressed the complaints
of the merchants of London,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More ample privileges given by Charles II.</NOTE> as they were likely to produce no good
effect against a society favoured by government. Charles had re∣newed
the charter, in the twenty-eighth year of his reign; he had
extended the privileges of the Company in the thirty-fifth; but when
his brother James the Second acceded to the throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James II. grants still more exten∣sive powers.</NOTE> he poured his
favours, with a very lavish hand, on a body whom he had before
patronized. To raise them into an equality with the Dutch Com∣pany,
and, perhaps, to give them a superiority over their republican
rivals, he not only increased their immunities, but even transferred
to them many of his own prerogatives. He impowered them to
build fortresses, to levy troops, to determine causes, under the form
of courts martial, and to coin money. Encouraged by so many
privileges, under the patronage of a Prince, who both knew and
loved trade, the Company not only assumed the pride, but even the
tyranny of sovereignty. Instead of repressing the encroachments of
their foreign rivals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> they persecuted such of their countrymen as
seemed inclined to invade their exclusive commerce. The principal
servants abroad, encouraged and protected by those who managed
the affairs of the Company at home, carried insolence, oppression,
and injustice into every department of their government.</P>
<P>Unlimited power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the tyranny of great socie∣ties, particu∣larly of com∣mercial bo∣dies.</NOTE> in the hands of a single person, may be pre∣vented
from degenerating into acts of tyranny, by the terrors of ig∣nominy
or by personal fears. But a body of men, vested with autho∣thority,
is seldom swayed by restraints of either kind. As they derive,
individually, but little applause from their best measures, so the
portion of infamy which may fall to each for the worst public
actions, is too small to affect personal character. Having, therefore,
no generous inducements to follow virtue, the most fordid passions
frequently lead them into vice. It is from this circumstance, that the
decisions of public bodies sometimes partake of that mortifying
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
species of tyranny, which is incapable of redress, and yet is be∣yond
revenge. These observations may be applied, without the
least injustice, to the actions of the India Company both at home
and abroad. Avarice, the most obstinate and hardened passion of
the human mind, being the first principle of commerce, was the
original bond of their union; and humanity, justice, and even policy,
gave way to the prospect or love of gain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beside that want of generous principle, which seems excluded from the very institution of a sovereign corporation of commerce, the great distance of their administration in India secured the Company from a general inspection into their conduct, and consequently furnished ample opportunities for a wanton and uncon∣trolled exercise of power. All resistance, there∣fore, to their arbitrary edicts, whether they regarded their own servants or the natives of the country, was considered as treason, and punished with severity. The rulers at home had their favourites abroad, whom they pro∣tected in the most cruel and oppressive mea∣sures by their authority. Hence it happen∣ed that private resentments and selfish views were too frequently the only rules of their conduct; and that their administration had scarce any other principle of union, than a mutual permission to commit injustice. Even the exclusive privilege, which was thought ne∣cessary for the prosperity of their commerce, became an engine of tyranny against all those whom they considered as interlopers; and such instances of their barbarity might be pro∣daced, supported by facts, as would excite horror.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The mismanagement of the Company at home had been long
covered by that veil of secrecy which the private interests of the
leaders had industriously thrown over their affairs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iniquitous conduct of the Company at home.</NOTE> It afterwards
appeared, that those leaders had usurped an absolute dominion over
the other adventurers. That, by their private contracts and un∣heard∣of
deductions, and by the most iniquitous frauds in both, the
joint stock had suffered a loss to near one half of its original
amount. That when, by embezzlement, avarice, and inattention
to their trust, they had in a manner devoured the property of
their constituents, by unjust and unreasonable dividends, to give
the fallacious appearance of health to a body fallen into a deep
decline. That, though in prosecution of the same system of de∣ception,
they had doubled their capital, in the year 1682, they had
not taken in but one half of the sum at first subscribed. That,
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
whilst they were making extravagant dividends to the proprietors,
the Company was languishing under a debt of two millions at in∣terest.
That, instead of answering legal demands, the Directors had
fixed a paper on the Treasury-door, declaring that they could pay
no more till a certain period; and all this at a time, when they
pretended the affairs of the Company were in the most flourishing
condition<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">White's account of the India trade.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>These iniquitous deceptions at home naturally produced frauds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their oppres∣sions, injus∣tice, and pi∣racies abroad.</NOTE>
oppression, and injustice abroad. To repair the ruins made by the
avarice of the Directors, they issued orders to their governors and
factors to borrow large sums in India on the credit of the Company.
Their conduct, upon this occasion, was treacherous, base and un∣worthy
of the subjects of any civilized state. In their letters to
their factors they intimated, that as soon as they had pushed their
credit to the utmost extent, they would then contrive means of
quarrelling with the creditors, and of putting a stop to their trade<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hamilton, vol. i. p. 187.—Harris, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The commands of the Directors were faithfully executed by
servants suitable to such masters. Having borrowed from the
merchants of Surat, under the mask of friendship, near three hun∣dred
thousand pounds, they followed the orders they had received,
and retired to Bombay. To complete the injustice and even villany
of these transactions, they began to make spoil of the ships and
goods of their creditors and benefactors. One Sir John Child, a
representative worthy of a vicious society, without any declaration,
without the least pretence to justify hostilities, seized thirteen rich
ships, belonging to the merchants of Surat, to the amount of more
than a million sterling<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As afterwards appeared upon oath in the court of exchequer. The value of three hun∣dred thousand pounds of this spoil was sent home to the committee of Directors who had issued the orders.—White's Account of the India Trade.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this treachery to foreigners,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cruelty to their ser∣vants</NOTE> the Company had added the most
dreadful oppressions towards their own nation. They had seized
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
the ships and condemned the property of interlopers, after having
put the crews in irons, and killed some of the captains<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hamilton, vol. i. Harris, vol. ii.</NOTE>. Their
injustice at sea was preceded and followed by unheard-of instances of
tyranny ashore. The merchants and inhabitants of Bombay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">occasions a revolt.</NOTE> exas∣perated
into a degree of madness by the oppressions of their masters,
had revolted from their authority, declared for the King and nation,
imprisoned their president, and had taken the reins of government
into their own hands<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dodsley, vol. ii, Hamilton, vol. ii.</NOTE>. When, upon a promise of pardon, and upon
stipulated conditions, they returned to their duty, the faith of the
Company was broken, and they were treated with insolence, tyranny,
and wanton cruelty. To such a degree of oppression had the Governor
of Bombay stretched his authority, that he actually erected an in∣quisition
under the presidency of a refugee Greek; to harass, ruin,
and destroy, by a religious persecution, such as, in other respects,
had eluded his vengeance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dodsley, Hamilton, &amp;c. Universal His∣tory, vol. x.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Company towards their subjects and servants
was uniformly oppressive,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their hostili∣ties against the subjects of the Mogul.</NOTE> unjustifiable, and cruel; yet, from its be∣ing
unknown or disregarded at home, they escaped those animad∣versions,
and, perhaps, punishments, which they had so much
deserved. But Aurungzebe, who then sat on the throne of Delhi,
resolved to obtain justice for his own subjects at Surat, for the piracies
committed by the Company. Having demanded that justice in vain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE>
by messages to the government of Bombay, he had ordered an army
into that island. The conduct of the governor was as pusillanimous
in war, as it had been insolent and unjust in time of peace. Being
pressed by a siege, three deputies, in the name of the Company,
were dispatched to Aurungzebe, who then resided at Jehanabad.
They presented themselves in the presence of the offended monarch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their abject submission to Aurungzebe,</NOTE>
with their hands tied before them; and having prostrated themselves
<PB N="16" REF="25"/>
on the ground, they implored his clemency, confessed their faults,
and humbly requested his pardon. The Emperor, having severely
reprimanded them, consented to withdraw his army, and to renew
the Phirman, which they had so justly forfeited, upon condition
of their making satisfaction to his subjects at Surat for the injuries
which they had sustained<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hamilton, vol. i.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE></P>
<P>Soon after these transactions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1691.</NOTE> both at home and abroad, the vehe∣mence
of persons injured by the injustice of the Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their affairs brought un∣der discussion in parliament.</NOTE> and the
jealousy of the merchants of London, brought their affairs into
public discussion, and under the consideration of parliament. The
House of Commons, having examined the subject in three different
sessions, had proposed regulations for carrying on, in future, the
commerce with the East Indies. But the Company had eluded all the
endeavours of that assembly, by procuring a new charter from Queen
Mary, who managed the affairs of the kingdom in the absence of King
William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1694. September.</NOTE> in September 1694. The House of Commons having,
in the beginning of 1695,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1695.</NOTE> detected various flagrant abuses in
the management of public affairs, were led to conclude, that the
court, the camp, the city, and even parliament, had been infected
with one general contagion of bribery, corruption, and venality.
The East India Company, having had the influence to remove the
consideration of their affairs from the legislature to the privy coun∣cil,
were naturally suspected of having gained the King's principal
servants by bribes. The Commons, therefore, ordered a committee
to inspect the books of the Company.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are de∣tected in bribery and corruption.</NOTE> The abstracts of the sums
paid for special services soon led to a discovery. In the reign of
James the Second, the annual charges of the management at home
had scarcely exceeded 1200 l.; but in the year 1693, when the
charter was first renewed, they had amounted to 90,000 l. Sir Thomas
Cooke, the governor of the Company, on whose notes the money
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
had been lent, terrified by a bill of pains and penalties passed by
the Commons, made a discovery which was not satisfactory. Ten
thousand pounds were, however, traced to the king himself; and
other sums to his ministers and principal servants<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Journals, April 1695.</NOTE>. The duke of
Leeds, as being the most obnoxious, was impeached for receiving a
gratuity of five thousand pounds; but king William, by putting
suddenly an end to the session, quashed at once the impeachment
and all further enquiry<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though the weight of the Crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The affair re∣sumed in 1698, by means of the associated merchants.</NOTE> and the influence of the Com∣pany,
as well as those who had received bribes, had quashed the
enquiry, in the year 1695, the associated merchants, or, as they
were called by the Company, the <HI>interlopers,</HI> found means to bring
the charter obtained in 1694, under the consideration of parliament
in the beginning of 1698. Exclusive of the mismanagements of the
Company at home and their tyranny in India, together with the
general arguments against the expediency and justice of a commer∣cial
monopoly, the principal objection offered against the charter,
was its not being confirmed by an act of the legislature.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government resolves to support those who paid most.</NOTE> Govern∣ment,
standing in need of a supply, had resolved to support the
cause of that party which should pay the most for their favour. The
Company, apprized of that circumstance, offered 700,000 l. at four
<HI>per cent.</HI> upon condition of having the charter confirmed by act of
parliament. The <HI>interlopers,</HI> protected by Mr. Montague, then
Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposed to advance two millions, at
eight <HI>per cent.</HI> in consideration of an exclusive trade to be vested in
the subscribers.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> June.</NOTE> A bill was accordingly passed on this affair, not∣withstanding
the petitions and opposition of the Old Company. The
latter, however, obtained in the succeeding year the sanction of par∣liament
to their charter; and thus the nation had two East-India
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
Companies by parliamentary authority, instead of one by prero∣gative<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ralph, vol. ii. p. 845.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The animosities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700.</NOTE> which had subsisted for many years between the
Old Company and the <HI>interlopers,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrels be∣tween the Old and New Company.</NOTE> who had been comprehended in
the New, were increased by mutual jealousies, after both had been
confirmed by the sanction of the legislature. They were now as so∣licitous
for the destruction of each other, as each had before been
for their respective establishment. Having both tasted the sweets
of the East-India commerce, both were inflamed with that envy
and irreconcilable resentment which ambition and avarice never fail
to inspire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both guilty of bribery and corruption.</NOTE> In the general elections which happened in the year 1700,
they had been both detected in bribery and corruption. “The
Old began with corrupting members and purchasing voices in the
house. The New, instead of purchasing votes, bought seats; in∣stead
of corrupting the representatives bribed the constituents, and
endeavoured to secure a majority in the house<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Universal Hist. vol. x.</NOTE>.” Their feuds and
jealousies in the mean time continued; nor did these in the least
subside till more than two years after the charter of the Old Com∣pany
had been confirmed by parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They unite into one com∣pany.</NOTE> Tired, at length, of a
quarrel which might possibly terminate in the ruin of both, they
resolved upon an union of stocks; and agreed that the future ma∣nagement
of their joint trade should be according to the charter of
the New Company, bearing date the 5th of September 1698.</P>
<P>During these contests in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Despotism and tyranny of the com∣pany, both at home and abroad.</NOTE> the same mismanagements and
the same oppressions continued in the settlements of the Company
in India. The principles of the Company's government abroad,
may be collected from the orders sent by their governor at home.
This commercial despot, in writing to the judge appointed by the
Company for civil affairs, makes use of the following remarkable
words: “I expect my will and orders shall be your rule, and not
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
the laws of England, which are a heap of nonsense, compiled by
a number of ignorant country gentlemen, who hardly know how
to govern their own families, much less the regulating companies
and foreign commerce.”—“Having now the power of condemning
the Company's enemies, or such as shall be deemed so, particular∣ly
those who shall question the Company's power over all the Bri∣tish
subjects in India, I expect my orders, from time to time, shall
be obeyed and observed as statute laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hamilton, vol. ii.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Though the judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The oppressed inhabitants of Bombay re∣volt.</NOTE> to whom this letter had been written, was
too prudent to <HI>promise</HI> obedience to the arbitrary mandates which
it contained, the governors of the different settlements seemed to
have thoroughly imbibed the despotic principles of their masters in
England. The profligate Sir John Child had been followed in the
government of Bombay and the generalship of India, by a succession
of petty tyrants. The union of the two Companies brought only a
fresh supply of rapacity and injustice, to the old stock of avarice
and tyranny. In some instances, the oppressed found themselves
obliged to strike the reins of government from the hands of their
oppressors. This was the fate of Sir Nicholas Waite, whose loose∣ness
of morals, bare-faced perversion of justice, and arbitrary exer∣tion
of his authority incensed to such a degree the inhabitants and
soldiers of Bombay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They send thé President pri∣soner to Eng∣land.</NOTE> that they seized his person and sent him pri∣soner
to England. A train of similar oppressions, joined with other
misfortunes, at length reduced that island to a solitary and dismal de∣sart.
War and pestilence had reduced the English inhabitants from
eight hundred to sixty persons. “Still the spirit of injustice re∣mained,
which neither war nor pestilence could subdue. The un∣fortunate
few, who survived those dreadful calamities, were de∣nied
the liberty of returning to their native country, or even of
removing to other parts of India. They were detained in the
<PB N="20" REF="29"/>
Company's service, under the lash of authority, insolence, and
oppression, without a glimmering of hope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Harris, Dodsley, &amp;c.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The union of the two Companies in England was found inca∣pable
of reconciling their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in India.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarrels be∣tween the ser∣vants of the two Compa∣nies after their union.</NOTE> The same principle of
avarice and self-interest, which had joined the former in one scheme

rancour, jealousy, and enmity. Those passions had their rise among
the leaders of the Companies at home, from the phlegmatic, though
vigilant and eager principle of avarice: but in India, self-interest,
selfish notions, rapacity, and consequently injustice, became blended,
as it were by fermentation, with the whole constitution of the mind.
The affairs of the united Company must naturally have languished,
as they were conducted by men more attentive to their own mutual
destruction, than to their duty to their masters. Neither honour,

ruining each other, or enriching themselves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The instances of rapacity, oppression, and injustice, committed by the superior servants of the Company, are too mean for the pen of an historian; at least, they are too numerous to be comprehended in a disquisition, where brevity is to be studied.

<P>The State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negligence of Govern∣ment in not interfering.</NOTE> whose correcting hand ought to have been stretched
forth to petty despots, whose quarrels and oppressions had disgraced
the nation, was too much embroiled at home, to extend its attention
to India. A disputed succession, the events, the hurry, the expence
of a great war, and, above all, the contests for places, which parties
dignify with the name of principle, occupied the whole attention of
the great body of the people. Men in office had neither leisure,
nor, perhaps, sufficient knowledge of the subject, to rectify abuses
in commerce; and thus, whilst the great interests of the nation
<PB N="21" REF="30"/>
were neglected, the Ministry were engaged in defending their places
from the attacks of rivals, and not in executing the duties of their
station.</P>
<P>Time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Self-interest, at length, be∣gets unanimi∣ty at home.</NOTE> which smoothes down, in its progress, the most furious
passions of the mind, extinguished, at length, the jealousies between
the leaders of the two united Companies in England. Their com∣mon
interest created unanimity in their measures; and, in looking
back to the conditions on which they had been united, they per∣ceived
defects and inconveniences, which they wished to remove.
The two Companies, when separate, had been conversant in the
means of gaining the favour of individuals with money; but, now,
the necessities of the State itself had rendered it an object for bribery.
To obtain such a law as would settle their affairs on a proper foot∣ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1708.</NOTE> they resolved, in the sixth year of Queen Anne, to lend to
Government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They pur∣chase a new law, in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by a loan to the State.</NOTE> at a stated interest, 1,200,000 l. over and above the
2,000,000 l, lent, when the New Company was established, about
ten years before. The Earl of Godolphin, then at the head of the
public finances, seized the offer with all the eagerness of a minister
who wants a supply. In consideration of a trivial sum, which
might have been borrowed upon common interest from individuals,
Parliament was ready to grant to the Company whatever privileges
and powers they required, for the benefit of their trade. A bill
was accordingly passed, in which the above sum of 1,200,000 l,
was declared an addition to the stock of the Company, free from
all taxes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Publication of the times.</NOTE>.</P>

waste, industry and trade were revived, and the East-India Com∣pany
<PB N="22" REF="31"/>
obtained its own share of the general prosperity. The leaders
in the Court of Directors, either guided by chance, or swayed by
judgment, had sent persons of prudence and commercial abilities, in
quality of chiefs, to their settlements, which gave a prosperous turn
to their affairs.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Compa∣ny prospers.</NOTE> Envy and jealousy, which tread close on the heels
of prosperity, again raised enemies to the Company. Men of emi∣nence
and weight joined, in the general cry, against an exclusive
commerce. A variety of arguments, plausible, at least, if not just,
were urged, with great vehemence, on that head. “The whole
kingdom was filled with complaints of the injustice of a mono∣poly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nation complains of their mono∣poly. 1729.</NOTE>
by which a body of private merchants satiated their avarice,
at the expence of all the other subjects of the state<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Publications of the times.</NOTE>.” To obviate
the consequences of speculative reasonings, become so general,
the Company had recourse to the never-failing argument of the
purse. They bribed the State, by what the State, perhaps igno∣rantly,
thought advantageous proposals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These were 200,000 l. as a gratuity, and a reduction of the annuity of 160,000l. upon their capital stock lent to Government, to 128,000l.

<P>The East-India Company continued in the same flourishing and
secure condition, both at home and abroad, till the war, which was
declared between France and England, in the year 1744. The
French having failed, for near eighty years, in all their attempts to
erect and support an East-India Company, at length accomplished
their object about the year 1720. The regular returns made by the
French, ever since their complete establishment in India, had been
so considerable, that the jealousy of the British Company was raised.
Government, entering with some degree of warmth into that jea∣lousy,
turned a part of their attention towards the East, when war
<PB N="23" REF="32"/>
was likely to arise between the two nations. The French, fearing
hostilities, as they were anxious to promote a commerce still in its
infancy, had proposed a neutrality between the two Companies, as
early as the year 1742. The Court of Directors, at first, accepted
and then rejected the proposal; but, whether instigated by Govern∣ment,
or swayed by their own versatility, is uncertain. When,
therefore, war commenced in Europe, its flame spread to Asia.
Their respective sovereigns assisted each Company; and, thus, the
business of commerce yielded to the occupations of arms. New
scenes were opened; and events arose, which became the founda∣tion
of that state of things, to explain which is the principal object
of this work.</P>

who sixed on a sterile and inconvenient spot, merely on account of
its vicinity to the Portuguese settlement of St. Thomas, where he
had a mistress. This injudicious choice was made, during the great
civil war in England, when the trade to India had languished so

death.</P>
<P>BOMBAY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Bombay.</NOTE> which has long presided over the factories on the coast
of Malabar, was itself formerly dependent on Surat, and governed
by a Deputy sent from that settlement. Their naval power enabled
the Portuguese to possess themselves of that island, soon after their
first arrival in Hindostan. Secured by the force which acquired it,
Bombay had scarcely any defences but the sea, by which it was sur∣rounded.
Being a part of the portion assigned to the Infanta of
Portugal, when she became Queen of England in 1662, it fell into
the hands of Charles II. in the end of 1663. That prince, finding
that it was not worth its expence to the State, transferred it, in fee∣tail,
to the Company, about the year 1669.</P>
<P>The English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Bengal.</NOTE> extending their commerce to Bengal, under the pa∣tronage
of Boughton, a surgeon, were permitted, about the year
1640, to build a kind of factory at Hughley, a port on the western
branch of the Ganges. But such was the jealousy of the Mogul
Government, that, for the space of forty years, the Company were
only allowed to retain thirty soldiers and an ensign in their pay, to
do honour to their principal agents. The war kindled by Sir John
Child, on the coast of Malabar, extending itself to Bengal, the
English were obliged to quit Hughley; and, soon after, to retire to
Madras. Upon the pacification made in 1689, with the Court of
Delhi, the factory was permitted to return, first to Soota-nutty, and
afterwards to settle at the village of Calcutta. Upon an insurrection
of the Rajahs, on the western side of the river Hughley, in the year
1696, the factory declared for the Mogul Government. The Nabob
of Bengal ordered them to defend themselves against the enemy;
and they raised walls with a few bastions, which they called Fort
William, in honour of the reigning king.</P>

lay between the Ganga and the Soan; and the domi∣nions
of the king of Bijapour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bijapour.</NOTE> who resided in a city of the same
name, seem to have extended themselves from the sources of the
Cristna, to the southern extremity of the kingdom of Mysore. The
territories of the king of Golconda,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Golconda.</NOTE> beginning, on the East and North,
on the banks of the Gandevari and Ganga, comprehended the whole
coast, from Orissa to Cape Comorin; being separated, on the West,
from the kingdom of Bijapour, by the vast mountains of Gata,
which divide the coast of Coromandel from that of Malabar.</P>
<P>The authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Constitution of their go∣vernment.</NOTE> which those princes exercised over the territories,
which they affected to comprehend within their respective king∣doms,
seems to have been various, both in its kind and degree.
Contrary to the usages of other Mahommedans, they permitted ho∣nours,
governments, and real property to descend, in regular suc∣cession,
from father to son. Those hereditary chiestains, though they
owned themselves subjects, executed all the functions of sovereignty,
within their governments. They fortified their places of resi∣dence
against the tyranny of their prince, as well as against the
injustice of neighbours; and they not only made war upon one an∣other,
<PB N="37" REF="46"/>
but frequently took up arms against their sovereign. They
were bound by their tenures to give an annual tribute to support his
dignity; but the regularity of the payments depended on his power
to enforce them. The rights of the Mahommedans, in short, dif∣fered
in nothing from those claimed by the hereditary Rajahs; who,
upon agreeing to perform military service, and to pay an annual tri∣bute,
were left in the management of their respective dominions.
As long as they performed the conditions of their dependence, the
prince never interfered with the internal management of their coun∣tries;
but when they failed in their duty, and he found himself
possessed of power sufficient to enforce his authority, either he stript
them entirely of their territories, or made them pay severely for
their refractory conduct.</P>
<P>To these disadvantages at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fears from the claims of the empire of Delhi.</NOTE> were added perpetual fears from
abroad. The empire of Delhi had never relinquished its preten∣sions
to the sovereignty of the Decan; and nothing had hitherto
prevented its enforcing its claims, but the want of power. The
martial character of Ackbar had impressed with such terror the
mind of Mubarick Shaw, king of Chandez, that in the year 1563
he paid homage at Mendu, the capital of Malava, which the emperor
had just reduced into the form of a province<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dow, vol. ii. p. 238.</NOTE>. Though Ackbar
always viewed the Decan “with an eye of conquest,” an opportu∣nity
for hostilities did not offer itself for more than twenty years.
In 1585, the brother of Murtiza Nizam, king of Golconda, flying
to Agra, prevailed upon the emperor to order the Mogul governor
of Malava to invade the Decan; but the princes of that country
joining in confederacy against the invaders, the imperialists were
obliged to retreat<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 279.</NOTE>. In the year 1588, the emperor dispatched am∣bassadors
to the four states of the Decan, less to gain their favour
than to learn their weakness<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 284.</NOTE>; and to derive, from their expected
<PB N="38" REF="47"/>
refusal of demands, which could not be granted, a pretence for
war.</P>
<P>The favourable opportunity so long sought by Ackbar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor Ackbar con∣quers two of the sove∣reignties of the Decan.</NOTE> presented
itself in the year 1593. A disputed succession had kindled a civil
war in the kingdom of Berar, and one party applied for aid to the
Mogul. A numerous army laid siege to Ahmednagur, the capital,
in 1595; but the views of the emperor were, for this time, frus∣trated
by powerful succours sent to the besieged, by the other princes
of the Decan. In the year 1600, Ackbar having taken Ahmedna∣gur,
the capital of Berar, by his generals, and Asere, in the do∣minion
of Chandez, in person, both kingdoms were reduced into
the form of provinces<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dow, vol. ii. p. 295.</NOTE>. Ibrahim Adil, king of Bijapour, terrified
by the success and vicinity of the Moguls, solicited peace, paid ho∣mage,
and subjected himself to an annual tribute to the empire<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>;
upon which Ackbar annexed his conquests, in the Decan, to his
other royal titles, in a proclamation.</P>
<P>The emperor Ackbar dying in 1605,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1605.</NOTE> was succeeded in the throne
of the Moguls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ackbar dy∣ing, is suc∣ceeded by his son Jehangire.</NOTE> by his only surviving son Sultan Selim, who as∣sumed,

himself prince of Hydrabad and Tellingana. Shaw Jehan marched
from Agra on the fourth of February 1631,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1631.</NOTE> with 300,000 men;
and having arrived at the capital of the province of Chandez,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shaw Jehan, having march∣ed against the princes of that country,</NOTE>

the activity and abilities of Lodi, who commanded the

field, they shut themselves up in their fortresses. Shaw Jehan laid
waste the country; and a dreadful famine was added to the cala∣mities
of war. The vizier Asiph Jâh, having ravaged with fire and
sword the kingdom of Bijapour, the sovereign of that country came
into terms, when nothing worthy of defence was left. The kings

<P>To awe the tributaries into an observance of the treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The emperor retains all the forts he had taken,</NOTE> Shaw
Jehan occupied with garrisons all the places, which he had taken in

war, which had effectually broken the spirit of the vanquished. The
tribute, which they had undertaken to pay, and which they durst
not evade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">to supply the waste made by the war.</NOTE> lay heavy upon their finances. They resolved, there∣fore,
to search for resources beyond the limits of their immediate
dominions, and to extort from their tributaries those sums which
they were obliged to pay to the empire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The most wealthy, and
<PB N="42" REF="51"/>
consequently the most powerful, of those tributaries was the Rajah of
the Carnatic; a country then better known by the name of Bigen∣agur.
The Rajah had furnished a pretence for war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kings of Bijapour and Golconda re∣solve to attack the Carnatic.</NOTE> by refusing or
neglecting to send, as tributary, the stipulated succours, upon the
requisition of the king of Bijapour, when the emperor Shaw Jehan
invaded his dominions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thevenot's Travels, part iii. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To explain this subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ancient his∣tory of that country.</NOTE> it is necessary to recur to a period of
more remote antiquity. When the Mahommedans penetrated into
the Carnatic, under the conduct of Malleck Caffoor, in the year
1310<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dow, vol. i.</NOTE>, Bellaldeo, king of that country, was sovereign of the king∣doms
of Canara, Mysore, and Travancore, together with Tanjore,
Marava, and Madura<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De Faria, vol. i. p. 55, &amp;c. vol. ii. p. 83–142.</NOTE>. To secure his wealth and family in the
mountains, whilst he opposed the Mahommedans in the plain
country, he built the city of Bigenagur<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dow, vol. i.</NOTE>, about a hundred and
eighty geometrical miles to the fouth-east from Goa<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lettres Edisiantes, tom. xxiii.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The new city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its depend∣ence on the Mohamme∣dans.</NOTE> becoming the capital, communicated its name to
the dominions of Bellaldeo; which, for some centuries, were distin∣guished
by the title of the empire of Bigenagur. When the Decan
was lost to the crown of Delhi in 1347, the dependence of the tri∣butary
Rajahs passed to the new sovereignties, erected by the Mogul
mercenaries, who had revolted. The intermediate history of the
Carnatic, between the revolt and the middle of the sixteenth cen∣tury,
is involved in darkness, which has not hitherto been pene∣trated.
In the year 1565,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacked by the united force of the four princes of the Decan.</NOTE> Bigenagur was attacked, by the united
force of the four Mahommedan princes of the Decan<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">De Faria, p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2.</NOTE>. Having
defeated the king in battle, they entered and plundered his capital;
and though they did not retain their conquests, the distractions
which followed their victory broke the empire to pieces,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kingdom of Bigenagur dissolved.</NOTE> and di∣vided

of the empire, all its provinces seem to have been united under
one king in 1597. This prince, whom we only know by the disfi∣gured
name of Wentakapati, kept his court at Kande-Gheri<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Lettres Edisiantes, passim.—Jesuit's Collect. p. 774–803.</NOTE>,
three miles from the famous Pagoda at Tripeti, and fifty-three to
the north-east of Arcot. His ancestors were said to have compre∣hended
within their dominions all the countries from Goa to Cape
Comorin;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolt of the Naigs of Ma∣dura, Tan∣jore, &amp;c.</NOTE> but it appears that, lately, the Naigs of Travancore, Ma∣dura,

the king of the Carnatic<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Epist. de Reb. Japan. et Indic. ab <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ayo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nothing of importance is recorded concerning the Carnatic from
this period forward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Entire con∣quest of the Carnatic.</NOTE> till its entire conquest by the Mahommedans,
about the middle of the seventeenth century. The kings of Bija∣pour
and Golconda, offended with the Rajah for refusing succours
against Shaw Jehan, and desirous to supply the waste made by the
war in their own trasures by the wealth of the Carnatic, invaded
that country with all their forces. The king of Bijapour, having
entered it through the mountains, seized Velore, which was then
the capital, and having taken Gingee and several other places of
strength, penetrated as far as Porto Novo and the cape of Negapa∣tam.
The famous Amir Jumla, who made afterwards so great a
figure under the emperor Aurungzebe, led the troops of Golconda,
and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eized the provinces along the coast of Coromandel. The war
began in 1650, and lasted six years, before the Mahommedans re∣duced
the Carnatic and its dependencies, with all their strong for∣tresses,
into the form of a province.</P>

friendship and claimed the protection of Aurungzebe, who com∣manded
for his father Shaw Jehan in the neighbouring countries.
When Jumla withdrew himself from the service of Cuttub,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jumla takes refuge with Aurungzebe.</NOTE> that
prince imprisoned his son, as the best hostage for his father's return.
The influence of Jumla turned the arms of the Moguls against his

with the management of this war;<NOTE PLACE="marg">War, on his account, against the king,</NOTE> a brave, a haughty, and

Hydrabad. He defeated Cuttub before the old city of Golconda.

his daughter Rizia.<NOTE PLACE="marg">who is stript of every thing but the title of prince.</NOTE> Her beauty softened the rigour of Ma∣hommed;

<P>Whilst the sovereign of Tellingana was reduced to this abject con∣dition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1557, War with Bi∣japour,</NOTE>
a similar fate hovered over the head of the king of Bijapour.
Upon the death of Adil Shaw, his son, without asking the permis∣mission
of his lord paramount, mounted his father's throne. This
conduct was highly resented by Shaw Jehan, who considered Bija∣pour
as an appendage of his empire. Jumla, who had been appoint∣ed
visier, was ordered with an army to depose the son of Adil. Au∣rungzebe,
who commanded in the province of Chandez, joined the
visier with his forces. That prince took the strong city of Bider
by assault, where he found all the wealth of Bijapour. He de∣feated
the young king before Kilburga; he besieged and took the

placed in all the strong places within the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dow, vol. iii. p. 207, 208, 209.</NOTE>. Aurungzebe
had settled the affairs of the Decan with such prudence and ability
that the southern provinces remained quiet under the government of
his second son Mahommed Mauzim, during the civil wars, which
ended in placing him on the throne of the Moguls.</P>

dethroned, and murdered so many princes, instead of endeavouring
to restore the vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His indo∣lence.</NOTE> which the empire had lost, he resigned himself
to indolence and the enervating pleasures of the Haram. An unset∣tled
succession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The confu∣sions attend∣ing revolu∣tions encou∣rage the go∣vernors of provinces to tender them∣selves inde∣pendent; particularly the Nizam of the Decan.</NOTE> and the confusions arising from so many revolutions,
encouraged the Nabobs of the remote provinces to pay little atten∣tion
to the mandates of a government, which possessed neither
steadiness nor strength to enforce its own commands. The most
powerful, the most artful, and, perhaps, the most ambitious of those
governors, was the Nizam, who had, for several years, commanded
all the provinces of the Decan. Being sensible of the debility of the
empire, he maintained a great standing army, under pretence of
awing the Marattas; but his real design seems to have been, to
found an independent kingdom for himself, in the southern pro∣vinces,
after the example of Hassen Caco Bemini, who mounted a
throne at Kilburga, in 1347<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dow's Decline of the Mogul Empire, p. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="61"/>
The Nizam, though bent upon royalty, was too prudent to break
forth into open rebellion, till time and circumstances should render
the power of the declining empire still less formidable. He,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His designs upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyalty.</NOTE> there∣fore,

which that fierce invader brought upon an empire already hastening

The artifice of the Nizam succeeded to the utmost extent of his de∣sign.
When Nadir Shaw evacuated Hindostan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1739.</NOTE> the management of
affairs fell entirely into his hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam pos∣sessed of the whole power of the Em∣pire.</NOTE> He nominated his creatures to

government of the Decan, to the office of captain-general of the
Imperial armies. Without the name, he possessed the power of king,
whilst the indolent Mahommed languished under the faded ensigns
of despised royalty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dow's Decline, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst the Nizam carried every thing before him at Delhi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolutions in the Car∣natic.</NOTE> some
revolutions in the Carnatic, which had partly sprung from his own
intrigues, turned his eyes towards his government, on which that
province of the empire was immediately dependent. To explain the
causes of those revolutions, which formed the foundation of the
power and influence of the British nation in Hindostan, we must re∣cur
to facts, further back in point of time, than some of those al∣ready
related.</P>
<P>The Nizam or Viceroy of the Decan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A short ac∣count of the Carnatic, since it became sub∣ject to the Empire.</NOTE> being accountable to the
empire for the whole government of that extensive country, was in∣vested
with a power of appointing deputies in the various provinces.
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
It appears, however, that Aurungzebe had retained, during his reign,
that prerogative in his own hands, with respect to the Carnatic.
The first Nabob he appointed was Zulfukar Chan, who afterwards
obtained the high office of Buckshi, or paymaster-general of the
forces, under the Emperor Bahader Shaw. Zulfukar was succeeded
in the government of the Carnatic by Daood Chan. In the year
1710, Sadatulla Chan obtained the Nabobship, which he held, with
reputation, till his death in 1732<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 37.</NOTE>. Having no issue male, he
adopted the two sons of his brother; Doost Ali, who succeeded him
in the Nabobship; and Bâkir Ali, whom he had appointed to the
government of Velore, which had been the capital, when the pro∣vince
was conquered by the kings of Bijapour and Golconda. When
Doost Ali acceded to the government, upon the death of his uncle
Sadatulla, his son Sipadar Ali was arrived at man's estate; and, to
strengthen the ties of blood by those of affinity, he gave one of his
daughters to his nephew, Mortaz Ali, the son of Bakir Ali; and
another to Chunder-Saheb, a near but more distant relation.</P>
<P>In the Carnatic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Gentoo chiefs lest in possession of their native territories.</NOTE> as well as in every province of the Mogul empire,
the conquerors had left, in possession of their territories, several Ra∣jahs
and petty chiefs, who, upon paying an annual tribute, and

their people, but even to entertain a standing force, to add authority
and dignity to their government. The most considerable of those
dependent chieftains, were the Rajahs, or rather the Naigs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epist. de Reb. Japan. &amp; Indic. ab Hayo collect. p. 774–803.</NOTE>, of

Ali, and his son-in-law and relation Chunder Saib. The latter,
having seized the capital by a stratagem, extinguished the power of
the natives;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Held by Chunder Saib.</NOTE> and, having assumed the government in his own per∣son,
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
but in the name of the Nabob, fortified himself against the
power of a master, whose authority he still pretended to own<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol, i. p. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Things remained in a state of tranquillity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nabob, Doost Ali, deseated and slain by the Marattas.</NOTE> for three years; but
in 1740, new and dangerous enemies appeared upon the frontiers of
the Carnatic. These were the Marattas, being privately urged against
Doost Ali by the Nizam, whom the troubles of the empire and an
attention to the preservation of the power, which he had acquired in
the management of affairs, had detained, for several years, at Delhi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Doost Ali, endeavouring to oppose the enemy in the passes of Da∣mal-cherri,
was defeated and slain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1740. May 20th.</NOTE> together with his son Hassen-Ali.
The eldest son of the Nabob, Sipadar Ali, who had not been
present in the action, retired to Vellore; and Chunder Saib, who
had entertained hopes of the government, shut himself up in Trit∣chinopoly.
The enemy ravaged the country, without controul;
till they were bribed to retreat by Sipadar Ali,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marat∣tas bribed to retreat.</NOTE> with the promise of
one hundred lacks, to be paid at stated times. As a security for the
payment of this enormous sum, it was privately stipulated, that they
should be put in possession of the fort and territory of Tritchino∣poly,
which Chunder-Saib then held, as a kind of property<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Dow's Decline of the Moguls, p. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Six months after their retreat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They return and take Tritchino∣poly.</NOTE> the Marattas returned to the Car∣natic,
in consequence of the private article in the treaty with Sipa∣dar
Ali, which had ceded to them Tritchinopoly. Chunder-Saib,
having sustained a siege of three months, was obliged to sur∣render
at diseretion, on the 26th of March 1741. Sipadar Ali, in
dread of the Nizam, the determined enemy of all authority assumed
without his consent, took up his residence at Vellore, then possessed
by his cousin Mortaz Ali, as the heir of his father Bakir Ali. The
Nabob, by assessing Mortaz Ali, with a part of the ransom due to
the Marattas, had imprudently alarmed the avarice and rouzed the
resentment of that prosligate man. The consequence was, that on
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>

by the procurement of Mortaz Ali,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1742.</NOTE> who proclaimed himself

father to the present Nabob, who succeeded Abdalla in his

seems to have had its sole foundation in the idle tales of a suspicious
vulgar. These tales, however, have been since imposed upon the
world, as matters of fact, by the enemies of the family of Anwar-ul-dien;
who, either swayed by interest, hired by party, or
warped by passion, revenge themselves of the living, by raking up
the ashes of the dead.</P>

<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
Omar<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Account of his Family.</NOTE>, the first Caliph, had signalized themselves in the ser∣vice
of the princes of the Mogul race, before they descend∣ed
from the mountains of Afganistân into the plains of
India. His father, having distinguished himself, by his erudition
and piety, acquired the favour and experienced the munificence of
the Emperor Aurungzebe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 52.</NOTE>; who gave him a considerable estate,
and conferred upon him the office of Duan of the province of
Patna. He himself had passed, in the course of a long life, through
various important trusts and public employments. He had succes∣sively
held the governments of Kurra-Jehanabad, Cambay, and
Putlad; and he had been Nabob of the provinces of Yalore and
Raja-Mundrum, for many years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 53.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Nizam was so far from suspecting Anwar-ul-dien of having
been instrumental in the death of his predecessor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nizam confers on him the guardianship of the son of Sipadar Ali,</NOTE> that he committed
to his guardianship and care, Mahommed the young son of Sipadar

was so much beloved in the provinces, which his family had so long
governed, that the Nizam had probably designed to appoint him to the
Nabobship after the death of Anwar-ul-dien, then in the decline of
life. The Nabob arriving in his government, in the month of April
1744,<NOTE PLACE="marg">whom he treats with kindness, and maintains with magni∣ficence.</NOTE> placed Mahommed in the palace of Arcot, where he was

murdered his father, or rather exasperated by affronts, received from

<P>Having explained the general state of the Carnatic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Facts relative to the de∣pendent pro∣vinces.</NOTE> and enume∣rated

within its bounds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tritchino∣poly Madura.</NOTE> The country of Tritchinopoly with its ca∣pital,
and Madura, as depending upon it, with its territory, though
formerly tributary to the Mahommedans, had not fallen entirely into
their hands, till the year 1736, as has been already related. The
next, in situation and extent, is the province of Tanjore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanjore.</NOTE> which has
been, of late, as much the source of altercation among party-writers'
as it has been an object of contest between parties. A brief state of
the history of that country will throw light on a subject, which,
though it has been much discussed, is hitherto little known.</P>
<P>The province of Tanjore forms the figure of a triangle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of that province.</NOTE> one side
of which stretches itself for seventy miles, along the western shore
of the bay of Bengal. The river Coleroon, the name given to the
largest branch of the Cavery, delineates the northern boundaries; and
its limits are terminated on the south, partly by the sea, beyond
Cape Negapatam, and partly by the country of the two Marawars.
Near the western angle, within twenty miles of Tritchinopoly, is
situated the capital, bearing the name of the country; which, like
many other places of strength in India, was originally no more
than a fortified Pagoda. The river Cavery, rising in the mountains
of Malabar, and after a course of four hundred miles, passing near
Tritchinopoly, is divided by art, and not by nature, into numerous
branches, and having watered the country, falls, by many mouths,
into the bay of Bengal. This circumstance, which gives fertility to
Tanjore, must have always rendered it dependent on its neighbours;
as the artificial bank, near Coiladdy, which diverts the Cavery from
<PB N="56" REF="67"/>
its natural course, into other channels, lies beyond the limits of the
province.</P>
<P>The province of Tanjore formed anciently a part of the exten∣sive

Two of his sons Mahommed Mauzim, who afterwards assumed the
title of Bahadar Shaw, and Mahommed Azem, disputing for the
succession, took the field with two powerful armies. Zulfukar

lest a son, Baba-Saib, who succeeded to the government of Tanjore.
Baba-Saib did not long survive his accession to that dignity, and,
having left no issue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A disputed succession.</NOTE> and the son of his brother Nana, being still an
infant, his widow was dignified with the titles of government,
whilst Seid, the commander of the fort, possessed the whole power.
But she was soon divested of even the appearance of authority, and
thrown into prison. Seid raised a real or pretended son of Shurfa-jî,
to the office of Naig; but that wretched figure soon fell a sacrifice
to the rage or convenience of his maker. Sahu jee, the son of
Tucko-jî, was then placed in the government; but either his own
incapacity, or the jealousy of Seid, deprived him of his authority.
Seid sent for Pretaupa-Sing, natural son of Tucko jî, who lived in
a distressed condition at Madeopatnam, and placed him in the
government, in the year 1741. One of the first acts of authority
executed by Pretaupa-Sing, was the assassination of the man to
whom he owed his elevation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revolutions of Tanjore, MS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The internal troubles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Naigs of Tanjore re∣main long obedient to the Nabobs of Arcot.</NOTE> arising from these disputed successions, did
not prevent the persons, who happened to be in possession of the
government, from paying regularly the tribute to the Nabob of Ar∣cot,
or from executing their duty, as feudatories of the empire.
During the Nabobship of Daood Chan, and the long government of
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
Sadatulla, they conducted themselves, in every respect, as dutiful
subjects<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. VI. p. 70.</NOTE>. In the Subahdarry of Doost-Ali, the Tanjorines exhi∣bited
a spirit of refractoriness and disobedience. He, therefore,
ordered his son, Sipadar-Ali, to proceed, with a large force, against
them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanjore taken from them by the Nabob Doost Ali.</NOTE> Having first broke down the mound near Coiladdy, which
turns the waters of the Cavery, from their natural course, into the
province of Tanjore, he marched into that country, seized the capi∣tal,
imprisoned the Naig, placed the government in the hands of his
own preceptor, Meer Assud, and garrisoned the place with a force,
under the command of Sheik Lutfulla.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They recover it at his death.</NOTE> But that officer, terrified
by the defeat and death of the Nabob, Doost-Ali, which happened
on the 20th of May 1740, restored Tanjore to its former masters.
When the Nizam came to settle the affairs of the Carnatic, in 1743,
he sent a detachment of his numerous army, under Abdulla, whom
he had made Nabob of Arcot, to take Tanjore; but Pretaupa-Sing
bought his peace with a sum of money, upon agreeing to increase
his annual tribute to fifty lacks of rupees<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">6<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5,000 l.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The preceding chain of facts has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion of facts, relative to the absolute de∣pendence of Tanjore,</NOTE> it is hoped, rendered more clear
a subject hitherto very imperfectly understood. It appears, that the
Mahommedans acquired that most indisputable of all rights, the
right of conquest, in a regular and solemn war, to the Carnatic and
its dependencies. That the province of Tanjore had always been
considered a division of the Carnatic, and an appendage or rather
a part of its sovereignty. That the Naigs of that country had been
originally the subjects of the kings of the Carnatic of the Indian
race. That their allegiance had been transferred, by a particular as
well as a general conquest, to the kings of Golconda and Bijapour.
That the Moguls, as the conquerors of those princes, acquired an
undoubted general title to all their claims of dominion, over their
dependents. That, in enforcing that title, they had acquired the still
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
more incontestible right of particular conquest to the territory of Tan∣jore.
That the present race of Rajahs obtained, by treachery, and not
by war, possession of that country, several years after the Moguls had
acquired a right of conquest to the Carnatic and its dependencies.
That the seizure of Tanjore by Ecko-jî was considered, as it actually
was, an invasion of the rights of the Moguls. That the emperor,
in asserting those rights, stript the son of Ecko-jî of his govern∣ment.
That his receiving back that government, upon the condi∣tions
on which it was received, was establishing a constitution and
tenure, rendering him, his posterity and successors, vassals of the
empire. That, by breaking the conditions upon which that con∣stitution
and that tenure were founded, subsequent Rajahs had been
subjected to punishments, to fines and even to deprivation. That
they owed the continuance of their authority and government to
favourable accidents, and neither to any acquiescence in their rights,
or opinion of their power.</P>
<P>It has,<NOTE PLACE="marg">on the empire of the Mo∣guls.</NOTE> upon the whole, appeared, that the Rajahs of Tanjore of
the race of Ecko-jî were, in the strictest sense of the word, feuda∣tories,
liable to lose their territories to their sovereign, upon any
breach of their duty, as subjects. It has been shewn, that the em∣peror
of the Moguls was their undoubted sovereign, who governed
them through the medium of his deputy, the Nabob of the Carna∣tic.
It has been proved, that the emperor possessed various and ir∣refragable
titles to their allegiance. That he had been lord para∣mount
of their territories, before they wrested them, by injustice
and treachery, from the hereditary Naig. That he had acquired a
fresh right to their duty, as subjects, in a regular war, which ter∣minated
in conquest. That they themselves had placed that right
beyond the power of cavil, in written testimonies of their “humi∣liation,
submission, penitence, and dejection.” That, whilst they
acknowledged the condition of subjects, they had performed their
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
duty as such, without murmuring, for more than thirty years.
That, when they deviated from their obedience, they were deprived
of their lands, and even subjected to corporal punishment. That
they were so far from assuming the state and independence of sove∣reignty,
that they solicited and obtained, from the emperor, the
title of Rajah for their family; and that, by this act, they not only
acknowledged their dependence on the empire, but likewise, that,
neither by birth nor acquisition, they had any right to that dignity.</P>
<P>Such was the real state of Tanjore in the year 1744,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mogul government the only ac∣knowledged and effective sovereignty in the Carnatic.</NOTE> though some
late writers, blinded by zeal, misled by faction, or swayed by in∣terest,
have erected that province into a kingdom, and encircled the
brows of its Naig with a crown. The truth is, that there was no
acknowledged, no effective, no independent, no sovereign power in
the Carnatic, at that time, except the Mogul, who had delegated
his authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anwar-ul-dien the legal representative of that sove∣reignty.</NOTE> in a regular and legal manner, to the Nizam. That
viceroy, according to the constitution of the empire, had invested
Anwar-ul-dien, in the same regular and legal manner, with the go∣vernment
of the province. All persons of every nation, and of
every degree, who held lands or pursued trade in that province,
were therefore subject to his authority, according to the tenures,
by which they held their possession, or the privileges, by which
they carried on their commerce. Being invested with all the autho∣rity
of the crown, the Nabob had a right to enforce the performance
of all the duties which subjects owe to the sovereign power; and,
in the execution of that high privilege, he naturally involved the
prerogative of making peace and war. Every hostility, committed
without his consent, must, therefore, have been an act of rebellion.</P>
<P>The servants of the East-India Company had not yet extended
their ambition to the renown attainable by seats of arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State and te∣nure of the English Com∣pany in that country.</NOTE> Confined
within the circle of a few miles of a sandy beach round Madras, the

<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
they had been indulged with the privilege of fortisying themselves,
they had neglected that first of all duties, self-defence. They had
works, but such as seemed rather built by chance, than design.
They had bastions, but they were placed contrary to all rule; and
the curtain was no better than a long, unflanked garden-wall<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commodore Barnets Account.</NOTE>. Ill-provided
with implements of war, yet destitute of skill and even
courage to use the few they possessed, they naturally trusted their
protection to the Moguls, under whose government they had lived
so long in security. They, therefore, congratulated, with sincerity,
Anwar-ul-dien, on his arrival in his government. They praised
his valour, celebrated his wisdom, and hoped every thing from his
justice; and they thought themselves favoured by Almighty God,
by his sending them so good and just a governor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. I.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The intriguing abilities of M. Dupleix,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reslexions on the character and views of M. Dupleix.</NOTE> who governed for the
French East-India Company at Pondicherry, had already begun to
plan or to foresee the disturbances, which soon after followed, on the
coast of Coromandel. The circumscribed circle of commerce was too
narrow for his talents, too confined for his ambition. Perceiving
the declining state of the empire of the Moguls, he wished and
hoped for a share of its spoils. With a self-sufficiency, which is
too often blended with good parts, he foresaw no difficulties which
he thought he could not surmount. Conversant in the character of
the Indians, he had imbibed their spirit for management and in∣trigue;
and, by combining the informations he had received from
various quarters, he hoped to obtain a principal influence in the
affairs of Hindostan. A desire to gratify his excessive vanity had
tinctured his mind with avarice; and the vehement demands of his
ambition had unfettered his mind, from those ties of sincerity and
honour, which bind more moderate men. But the passions, as well
as the talents of M. Dupleix, lay hitherto concealed within the walls
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
of Pondicherry; where he brooded over his mighty schemes of con∣quest,
with scarce three hundred men to defend the place.</P>
<P>War had been declared between Great Britain and France in
1744; but its operations were not extended to India, till the ensu∣ing
year. Some actions, which happened at sea, like most ren∣counters
on that element, were attended by no decisive consequence;
and nothing was attempted by land, between the two nations, till
September 1746.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1746.</NOTE> On the third of that month<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Universal Hist. vol. x. p. 176.</NOTE>, a body of French
troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French take Madras.</NOTE> under M. de la Bourdonnais, landed near Madras; and, on
the tenth, the town surrendered, without killing a man to the ene∣my,
and without losing but five lives, and that by accident, within
the walls.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob be∣sieges the French in that place in vain.</NOTE> The Nabob, who, as disposer of peace and war in his
own government, had forbidden hostilities by land, was so much
offended at the capture of Madras, that he besieged the place. The
French, by a spirited effort, defeating his army at St. Thomè, drove
them from the field; and, thus, gained the first decisive advantage
obtained by Europeans, against the troops of the Mogul empire,
in the space of one hundred years<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1746.</NOTE> irritated at the defeat of his army, resolved to recover
the laurels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His troops take the field against them.</NOTE> which his troops had lost. The French, encouraged by
their victory, determined to pursue their advantage, by attacking the
British settlement of Fort St. David. Two bodies of the Mogul forces
took the field, under the Nabob's two sons. These were Mapheus
Chan, and Mahommed Ali; the latter destined by the Nizam and
the court of Delhi, to succeed his father in the government of the
Carnatic.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His two sons defeat them, and save Fort St. David.</NOTE> The first, setting upon a body of French, defeated them

was disappointed, by the determined adherence of the Nabob to
the Company's cause<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 84.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French, in revenge, carry fire and sword into the Carnatic.</NOTE> To form a diversion for the troops of the
Carnatic, the French carried fire and sword, from Madras, into the
defenceless villages around. But, in this expedition, they lost ho∣nour,
and gained nothing but plunder. The Nabob's troops still
remained at Fort St. David; and the mind of that prince “was more
exasperated than before,” against the French cause<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these obvious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Party-writers cofuted.</NOTE> great, and decisive services render∣ed,
by the Nabob, to the Company, his conduct has been much
misrepresented by the prejudices of individuals and the malice of
party. Some profligate writers, either inflamed by passion them∣selves,
or hired by others to inflame and deceive the public, have
not scrupled to affirm, that Anwar-ul-dien was throughout INIMI∣CAL<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">This awkward, unanalogical word seems to have been purloined from those respectable bodies of men, the American Committees of Safety.</NOTE> to the British nation. They say, that “he prohibited the
British fleet from acting in the Carnatic:”—He was the governor
of that province, and the guardian of its peace. “He permitted
the French to take Madras:”—Yet he sent a messenger to M. Du∣pleix
“expressing his great surprise at the presumption of the French
in attacking Madras, and threatening to send his army thither, if
the siege was not immediately raised<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 68.</NOTE>.”—Finding that the town had
been unexpectedly and even shamefully surrendered, he resolved to
retake it by force;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1747.</NOTE> and, being disappointed, he gave that effectual
assistance, which, by saving Fort St. David, preserved the very ex∣istence
of the Company on the coast.—The same writers af∣firm,
that the Nabob declined “to assist the English, in the de∣fence
of Fort St. David, till they had stipulated to pay the ex∣pences
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
of his army:”—Yet the authority, which they cite for this
assertion, says, “the Nabob readily engaged to send his army to
Fort St. David, on condition that the English would furnish a
<HI>part of the expence:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 79.</NOTE>”—And why not? was not the war their
own?</P>
<P>The managers of the Company's affairs at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">January. Gloomy state of affairs on the coast.</NOTE> having neglect∣ed
to send any assistance whatsoever to their servants abroad<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 85.</NOTE>, their
affairs wore a very gloomy aspect, on the coast of Coromandel, in
the beginning of the year 1747. The king's squadron, which had
performed no service of importance, in the preceding year, had
quitted the coast on the 23d of August 1746; and there was no
appearance of its return. The French, to separate the Nabob from
the British interest, had carried a destructive war into the defence∣less
parts of his dominions; while, at the same time, they endea∣voured,
by management, misrepresentation, intimidation, and pre∣sents,
to gain his neutrality.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob makes a peace, wherein he stipulates with the French,</NOTE> The tranquillity of his government
was the great object of Anwar-ul-dien. Though the affairs of the
British Company were not entirely desperate, there was no proba∣bility,
without assistance from Europe, of restoring them to their
former prosperity. He, therefore, listened to the proposals of the
French; and, having received near 20,000 l. as an indemnification
for losses sustained, he concluded a treaty of peace, in which it was
“expressly stipulated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">not to molest the English.</NOTE> that the French should give no further mo∣lestation
to the British at Fort St. David<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. I. p. 13.</NOTE>.” The French, faithless
to their stipulation, prepared to attack that fort, in the beginning of
March 1747<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 20.</NOTE>; but they retreated, upon the appearance of the
British squadron, which, being reinforced from Europe, had re∣turned
from Bengal<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 87.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="78"/>
The Nabob, highly incensed at the flagrant breach of a treaty so
lately concluded, had already begun to make preparations for chas∣tising
the French<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. I. p. 13.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is highly incensed at their breach of that stipu∣lation.</NOTE> His son Mahommed Ali, the present Nabob

exhibited, ever since, to the British cause. He affirmed, that it
was the delay of the return of the squadron, that induced his father
to conclude the treaty of neutrality. He was incensed at the breach
of it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncommon attachment of Mahommed Ali to the British.</NOTE> and declared, that, “as the French had transgressed his or∣ders,
and proceeded against Fort St. David, he would chastise them,
and send a force to assist the British, if they required it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” The
presidency of Fort St. David were so sensible of the sincerity of Ma∣hommed

of their president, they returned thanks, in words expressive of
their thorough persuasion of his good intentions to serve the British

<P>During the remaining part of 1747,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War suspend∣ed.</NOTE> the war between the two
Companies remained suspended on the coast of Coromandel. The
squadron, under Commodore Griffin, being superior to that of the
French, and the force at Pondicherry too weak to encounter the
united power of the Nabob and the Company, both sides remained
quiet, expecting succours from Europe. The succours, however,
did not arrive;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1748.</NOTE> and more than one half of the year 1748 passed in
the same state of suspended hostilities. But on the 29th of July<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Universal Hist. vol. x.</NOTE>
admiral Boscawen arrived from England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral Bos∣cawen lays siege to Pon∣dicherry.</NOTE> with a reinforcement of

joined to those already on the coast, formed the greatest marine
force, that had ever been seen in the East Indies. The admiral, pos∣sessing
a decided superiority, immediately began to act offensively,
and laid siege to Pondicherry. The negligence of the Company's
<PB N="68" REF="79"/>

engineers, and, perhaps, of the admiral in military operations by

they obtained the object destined for themselves. His dethroned

insisted strongly on his being delivered into his hands<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>Rous's Appendix, No. I. p. 32—33. Extract of Fort St. David Consultations, 30th June, 1749.</P>
<P>The President having received a letter from Major Lawrence at Devi-Cotah, in answer to the proposals sent him the 28th instant, to make to the ambassadors towards forwarding a peace, which were rejected by them; that they were highly incensed at the article of allowing a maintenance for the support of Sahajee Rajah, and insisted strongly upon his being delivered up to them; but that after a long conference they had offered the following proposals, which Ma∣jor Lawrence writes the President he believes to be the best terms they can be brought to:</P>
<P>To pay one lack of rupees on account of the expences of the expedition.</P>
<P>To give a grant of the fort of Devi-Cotah to the Company for ever, with lands about it to the yearly value of 9000 pagodas.</P>

interposed; and insisted on their refusing the <HI>modest</HI> de∣mand
of the reigning <HI>king</HI> of Tanjore. But neither the honour
of Admiral Boscawen, nor any regard for their own, could induce
the Board to reject, with spirit, the insolent demands of Pretaupa
Sing. On the contrary, they gratified his resentment and pacified
his fears, with a breach of public faith, scarce paralleled by any
instance in history. It was stipulated by a secret article, that “they
“should prevent the Pretender,” the very person, whom they had
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
called in a solemn treaty “the right and lawful king” of Tanjore,
“from giving any further molestation to Pretaupa Sing; to ensure
“which, it was necessary to secure his person.” The wretched
Shaw-jî having found means to escape, from the hands of his faith∣less
allies, they seized his uncle and, by a strange perversion of jus∣tice,
detained him a prisoner at Fort St. David, for nine years, till
he was released by the French, when they took the place, in 1758<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 318.</NOTE>.</P>

the terms he granted were not the effects of his fears from
the British arms. A storm, which threatened more serious conse∣quences,
than the efforts for the pretended restoration of Shaw-jî,
had been advancing, for some time, and had partly fallen already
in the neighbourhood of Tanjore. Mahommed, emperor of the
Moguls, having languished upon his throne, ever since the villainy
of his servants and the violence of Nadir Shaw broke the power of
the Empire, had died in the year 1747. His death was soon after
followed by that of the Nizam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of the old Nizam.</NOTE> who had arrived, notwithstanding
the anxieties and inquietudes arising from a life of intrigue, iniquity
and ambition, to the amazing age of one hundred and four years.
The reverence impressed by great age and long continuance of power
had effectually established his authority; and, as he had, in a man∣ner,
outlived the memory of half his crimes, he was much respected
throughout an empire, which his villainy had ruined<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dow's Decline of the Empire, p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Nizam left five sons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His family.</NOTE> some of whom inherited his talents,
but all his crimes. When he moved the whole machine of govern∣ment
at Delhi, after the departure of Nadir Shaw, he obtained the
office of Captain-general of the Imperial troops, for his eldest son,
Ghazi-ul-dien, who had remained at the capital, disturbing, by in∣trigue
and faction, the government of the prince, whose commission
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
he bore. Nazir Jung, the second son, had accompanied his father to
the Decan, and had borne a part of the weight of his government.
The other three sons passed their time, in their father's court
or camp, in that unimportant obscurity, which ever attends princes,
who are not employed in public affairs. The absence of the eldest
son at Delhi had encouraged Nazir Jung to expect the government of
the Decan, after his father's demise; but the inclinations of the
Nizam, for he had no constitutional power to dispose of the succes∣sion,
seem to have leaned to his grandson, Muziffer Jung, the son of
Nazir<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dow's Decline of the Empire, p. 52. Orme says, that Muzisser, to whom he gives the name of Maizafa, was the Nizam's grand∣son by a daughter.

Rajah of Tanjore. Pretending an illegality in all acts of govern∣ment,
ever since the murder of Sipadar Ali, in 1742, he made a
demand of the arrears of tribute, and marched with his army to
support that demand. Pretaupa-Sing, terrified by the invasion, yet
unwilling to pay so large a sum, endeavoured to protract affairs by
negociation. He corresponded, in the mean time, with Mahommed
Ali at Tritchinopoly; and both joined in exhorting Nazir Jung at
Golconda,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Extorts the tribute, as Nabob of the Carnatic.</NOTE> to come in person, after the example of his father, to
settle the affairs of the Carnatic. Chunder-Saib, but especially his
French auxiliaries, tired by this studied delay, attacked and carried
one of the gates of his capital; and, though they were prevented
by strong retrenchments, from entering the town, Pretaupa was so
thoroughly intimidated, that he agreed to pay 875,000 l. to Chun∣der-Saib,
as Nabob, and 25,000 l. to the French troops, as his
auxiliaries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 136.</NOTE>. But a sudden change in the state of affairs saved his

<P>The Emperor Mahommed had been succeeded in the throne of Delhi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum∣stances which led to another revolution in the Carnatic.</NOTE>
by his son Ahmed, a weak, irresolute, and unfortunate prince. Ghazi∣ul-dien,
the eldest son of the late Nizam, had obtained from Ahmed
the government of the Decan. Nazir Jung, hearing of his brother's
appointment, had marched with a great army from Aurungabad to∣wards
Delhi; not on pretence of war, but to pay his respects to the

Nazir Jung, in consequence of his victory, was acknowledged every
where Viceroy of the Decan, and his acts of government were conse∣quently
legal. M. Dupleix, whose schemes were rather retarded,
than frustrated, by the apparent ruin of his allies and friends, wrote
him a letter of pretended submission;<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Dupleix writes against Mahommed Ali.</NOTE> though he had the presump∣tion

<P>This insolent requisition neither deserved nor received any answer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negligent conduct of Nazir Jung.</NOTE>
Nazir Jung, in the mean time, retired to Arcot, where he resigned
himself to his favourite pleasures of the Haram and hunting.
Without abilities and destitute of application, he suffered his mi∣nisters
to propose measures, upon which he instantly decided with∣out
examination, or any regard either to their justice or iniquity.
The absurdity of his conduct offended his friends;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He offends his friends.</NOTE> and his inatten∣tion
to all business raised the contempt of his enemies. The num∣ber
of the latter was great, within his camp and near his person;
<PB N="75" REF="88"/>
and, having formed a secret design against his life and government,
they held a correspondence with M. Dupleix and advised him to
proceed to open hostility.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A conspiracy against his life.</NOTE> The French, accompanied by Chunder-Saib,

were,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French defeat Ma∣hommed Ali.</NOTE> therefore, ordered to quit his standard. The next night, after
this desertion, the French surprised the Nabob in his camp; and,
with little loss to themselves, routing and dispersing his undisci∣plined
army, forced him to fly to Arcot<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 151.</NOTE>. Pursuing their victory,
they took Gingee by assault; which, at length, rouzed Nazir Jung
from that dream of pleasure, which he had indulged ever since the
defeat and imprisonment of his son. Having, therefore, assem∣bled
a considerable army, in the end of September 1750, he moved
his standards, from Arcot, towards Gingee<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme and Lawrence, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nazir Jung's taking the field was the great point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspi∣racy against Nazir Jung.</NOTE> towards which the
conspirators had turned their eyes, for accomplishing, with certainty
and security, his destruction. Whilst he remained in a settled place
of residence, the pomp and numerous attendants surrounding his
person rendered any attempt upon his life doubtful in the exe∣cution
and dangerous to the assassin, should he even succeed in his
design. But, in any expedition, the conspirators, from their rank,
were certain of commanding one half of his army, and they had it
in their power to make the events of war subservient to their views.
The most considerable of those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Headed by the Nabobs of Cuddupa and Cano<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</NOTE> who were engaged in the plot, were
the Nabobs of Cuddupa and Canoul, who had attended Nazir Jung,
in his expedition to the Carnatic, from their respective governments.
Both were Patans by birth, and both led their native troops; a race
of men, though fierce and bold, less remarkable for valour against
declared enemies, than for treachery to those who hired their service.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="89"/>
The unwieldy army of Nazir Jung, being obstructed, in its
march, by the rains, which set in at that season of the year, was
forced to remain in a camp,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nazir Jung's camp attack∣ed by the French.</NOTE> within sixteen miles of Gingee. Whilst
he suffered himself to be amused by a negociation, which was car∣ried
on with M. Dupleix at Pondicherry, the conspirators had settled
their plan of operations, which was to be carried into execution, in
concert with the French at Gingee. Things being, at length,
prepared, M. de la Touche, who now commanded the troops<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Crme and Lawrence, passim.</NOTE>,
marched from Gingee with eight hundred Europeans and three
thousand sepoys. With this small force, he surprised, in the night,
the camp of Nazir Jung, who expected nothing less than hostilities
from a nation, with whom he had just ratified a treaty. The im∣mense
rabble, rather than army, which were next the enemy, were
soon thrown into confusion. Riding on an elephant, to bring up the
Patans, who were in his rear, to action, the Subah questioned harshly
the Nabob of Cuddupa;<NOTE PLACE="marg">He himself murdered.</NOTE> who answered him with his carrabine, and
shot him with two bullets through the heart. He had scarcely fallen
to the ground, when his head was severed from his body, fixed on
a spear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Muziffer de∣clared Subah.</NOTE> and carried to Muziffer Jung; who was instantly released,
and declared Nizam, amidst the shouts of the whole army.</P>
<P>Though such revolutions are not uncommon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intemperate vanity of the French.</NOTE> in the annals of the
East, the French, with their usual vanity, magnified an event ac∣complished,
by mere assassination, into one of the most brilliant ac∣tions
that had ever happened in war. M. Dupleix, whose reputation
seemed to require, that the part he had acted, in this disgraceful
business, should remain concealed, formed a plan for perpetuating
the memory of it to future ages. He proposed to build a city on the
spot, under the name of Dupleix-Fatteabad<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The city of Victory.</NOTE>; thus branding, by
excessive vanity, his own name to posterity, by connecting it with a
detestable murder. To those, who may chuse to consider this subject
<PB N="77" REF="90"/>
with attention, it will, perhaps, appear that events, which became af∣terwards
destructive in their consequences, proceeded more from Bri∣tish
negligence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negligence of the Compa∣ny's servants the true cause of these mis∣fortunes.</NOTE> than French valour. Had the Presidency accepted
the offer of Admiral Boscawen, in the preceding year, the influence
of the nation, and the interests of the family of Anwar-ul-dien,
might have been supported without the aid of Nazir Jung. Had
Major Lawrence accompanied that viceroy to Arcot, according to
his most earnest desire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣stances.</NOTE> he should not have fallen by French perfidy.
Had the Presidency not recalled the British troops from the aid of the
Nabob, the French could not have obtained the victory at Trivadi;
which enabled them to give a Subah to the Decan, and a Nabob to the
Carnatic. But it would appear, that Major Lawrence suffered his own
gallant spirit to be cramped and confined, by the narrow councils of a
commercial Board.</P>
<P>The murder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conspira∣tors discon∣tented with Muziffer.</NOTE> which raised Muziffer to the Subahship of the
Decan, subjected him to the insolence of those, to whom he owed
his power. Though assassination was but a light crime in the eyes
of the Patan Nabobs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1750.</NOTE> they valued its reward at a high rate. That
reward they instantly asked,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their inso∣lence.</NOTE> in terms more suited to create terror
than to excite gratitude. Having evaded, without refusing their
demands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December 15.</NOTE> Muziffer entered Pondicherry, on the 15th of December,
whither he was followed, the next day, by the clamourous Nabobs.
They explained to M. Dupleix the promises of Muziffer, and their
own claims, which were a remission of all past arrears, a total exemp∣tion
from future tribute, and an augmentation of territory, with one
half of the treasure of Nazir Jung. Finding that M. Dupleix was

<P><PB N="78" REF="91"/>
Though the Patan Nabobs complained of Muziffer's deficiency in
gratitude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Muziffer's gratitude to the French.</NOTE> he seems to have carried that virtue to a degree of extra∣vagance
towards M. Dupleix and the French nation. He raised

and Cape Comorin; he ceded to the latter considerable territories
in the Carnatic, together with the city of Masulipatnam in Gol∣conda.
Chunder-Saib obtained the Nabobship of Arcot, in subor∣dination
to M. Dupleix;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declares Chunder-Saib Nabob.</NOTE> and others were rewarded in proportion to
their merit in the late revolution. As the personal safety of a prince,
who owed his power to the intrigues of M. Dupleix, and the arms
of the French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is attend∣ed by a body of French troops.</NOTE> was a matter of the last importance, a body of
French troops, under M. Bussy, was ordered to attend the new Su∣bah
to Golconda. It consisted of three hundred Europeans, and two
thousand Sepoys, with ten field-pieces; and, under this escort,
Muziffer left Pondicherry, on the fourth of January 1751<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lawrence, Orme, India Papers, Private Information, passim.</NOTE>.</P>

with vigour or with success. The chiefs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Various in∣stances.</NOTE> attached to the family
of Sadatulla had contributed to the expence, as long as Chunder-Saib
lived. But they had withdrawn their supplies, on account of
the weakness of his son. Mortaz-Ali, whom M. Dupleix raised
to the titular office of Nabob, could neither be trusted nor supported
by the friendship of his family; and the only appearance of virtue
he possessed, was a dissidence of himself. The Marattas, whom
M. Dupleix had gained to his aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All his mea∣sures broken and ruined.</NOTE> were scarcely less dangerous, as
friends, than they had been, as enemies. His acquisition of the
Mysoreans, though it gave trouble to his opponents, brought no
benefit to himself. Their commander was weak, credulous, and
undecisive; mistaking perpetually his own interest, and, instead of
giving aid, standing always in need of support. His obstinacy,
however, supplied, in some degree, the place of firmness. Deter∣mined
to obtain an object, which would ruin him in the possession,
he remained three years, in the neighbourhood of Tritchinopoly;
and nothing but a serious invasion at home, could recal him,
at last, from his wild schemes abroad. Having remained, in a

and splendour, accompanied by three thousand horse and two hun∣dred

convinced, that it was his own interest<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 281.</NOTE>, as it certainly was his

<P>A conduct so faithless to his superior and so adverse to the English

Pretaupa Sing paid his respects to the Nabob and the English com∣mander
in chief, he entertained an agent from the Mysoreans, at
Tanjore.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He entertaine their agent at his capital.</NOTE> That agent, having bribed the minister with money, and

with specious pretexts of losses sustained, from the Mysoreans and
their allies the Marattas. He alleged, that the detachments of the
latter had already destroyed to the value of 100,000 l. in his country.
But “this pretended mischief was no more than what all other parts

Instead of being able to form magazines, the army near Tritchino∣poly

had been formerly subject to the empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wretched state of India.</NOTE> were involved in all the
horrors of a civil war. “Villainy was practised in every form;
all law and religion were trodden under foot; the bands of private
friendships and connections, as well as of society and government,
were broken; and every individual, as if in a forest full of wild
beasts, found no safety, but in the strength of his own arm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dow's Decline of the Empire.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Sullabut Jung,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of the Decan.</NOTE> whom the French had raised to the office of Subah
of the Decan, upon the death of his nephew, Muziffer Jung, in
the month of February 1751, still possessed the dignity of Nizam,
in opposition to the court of Delhi. Supported by the arms of
those, to whom he owed his power, he held a considerable degree of
authority in the provinces, which lay nearest to his capital. The
Marattas, who had been formidable, for many years, to the whole
empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French obtain four provinces,</NOTE> had torn several large districts, from the dominion of Sul∣labut
Jung<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 329.</NOTE>; and his friends the French had obtained, from his fa∣vour,
or rather extorted from his fears, the four maritime provinces
of Mustaphanagur, Yalore, Rajamundrum and Chicacole. These
acquisitions, together with the province of Condavir, put the French
in possession of “the sea-coast of Coromandel and Orissa, in an un∣interrupted
line of six hundred miles, from the Gondegama to the
famous Pagoda of Jagganat<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 334, 335.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">which yield annually half amillion.</NOTE> This extensive territory, yielding
annually more than half a million sterling, was the greatest domi∣nion,

cessions so valuable, the French lent their arms to the Subah, to re∣cover
<PB N="95" REF="108"/>
the tribute due to the empire, from the rich and extensive
province of Mysore. It was his march into that country, which de∣livered
the Carnatic, in April 1755, from the troublesome, though
ineffectual, war carried on at Tritchinopoly by the Mysorean re∣gent.</P>
<P>The conditional treaty concluded in 1754 had introduced a sus∣pension
of hostilities between the English and French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A suspension of arms be∣tween the English and French.</NOTE> not only as
enemies to one another, but as allies to the country-powers. Ma∣hommed
Ali, now acknowledged Nabob of the Carnatic, was still
far from prossessing that decisive authority over the country, which
the nature of his office implied.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unsettled state of the Carnatic.</NOTE> The Zemindars of the province of
Madura, and the Polygars of Tinnevelly raised disturbances in the
south; and though the Polygars of the north had made some com∣pensation,
for the tribute, which they had retained during the late
civil war, their submission had only the appearance of being
temporary, as they were not deprived of the means of supporting
future disobedience.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mortaz-Ali supported by the French.</NOTE> Mortaz-Ali, the Phousdar of Velore, was not
only a powerful, and, therefore, a dangerous dependent; but had
even been, and still might be, the rival of the Nabob, as governor
of the country, should the present state of the English influence
suffer any change. When a force had marched from Arcot, to de∣mand
the customary tribute, the interference of the French, in fa∣vour
of Mortaz-Ali, had convinced the Nabob, that they only
waited for a future opportunity to renew their former exertions
against his title and power.</P>
<P>To add to his embarrassment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah of Tanjore re∣fractory.</NOTE> the Rajah of Tanjore, whom he had

against Tondiman, a Polygar, whose allegiance had been transferred
<PB N="96" REF="109"/>
to the Moguls, as a dependent on Tritchinopoly, when that city and
province came under their power. His territories lay between
Tanjore and Madura, bordering, in part, to the north, on the pro∣vince
of Tritchinopoly, to the Naig of which the Polygar had been

and its districts to Tondeman, for services performed, in
a season of distress, he disavowed the cession, when that distress was
removed. Mona-jî, who was, at the time, general and minister of
Tanjore, enraged at his master's perfidy, “purloined the use of the
seal, and delivered the patents, thus apparently authenticated, ac∣cording to promise.” Captain Calliaud, who commanded at Tritchi∣nopoly,
by working on Pretaupa-Sing's natural timidity, suspended
hostilities, but could not induce the Rajah to lay aside the design of
war<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 403. Cambridge's Trans∣actions on the Coust of Coromandel, p. 99.</NOTE></P>
<P>In May 1756,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War between Great Britain and France.</NOTE> war was declared between Great Britain and
France. But the two Companies, on the coast of Coromandel, had

happened during the year 1757.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disturbances in the Carna∣tic.</NOTE> The disturbances of the Carnatic
still continued. Two of the Nabob's brothers, aiming at indepen∣dence,
took arms in the two extremities of his government. Ma∣pheus

in his government of Nellore. To add to the public cala∣mities

<P>Though Captain Calliaud had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War ketween Tanjore and Tondiman still continues.</NOTE> by his spirited conduct, suspended
the war between Pretaupa-Sing and Tondiman in 1756, the Rajah
had resumed his hostile intentions in the beginning of 1757. Kelly∣nelly-cotah,
the object of contest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanjore re∣fuses to aid the English.</NOTE> was taken by Mona-jî, the general
of Tanjore, in the month of January. But though Calliaud made a
journey to Tanjore, as well to re-establish peace, as to obtain troops,
from both the contending parties, to assist in the reduction of Ma∣dura,
he failed, in all his efforts, and found the difference between
them irreconcileable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 198.</NOTE>. Both promised fair; but Tondiman only
adhered to his word.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rajah's treacherous conduct.</NOTE> A thousand of his horse and one hundred
colleries joined Calliaud at Anwashul. Five hundred horse were
expected from Tanjore; but none came. Calliaud “being convinced
that the Rajah, notwithstanding his promises, did not intend to send
any, made a merit of rejecting what he was not likely to obtain<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">A late writer censured.</NOTE>
Yet a late writer dogmatically affirms, from the historian just cited,
<PB N="98" REF="111"/>
that Pretaupa-Sing “had attached <HI>his self</HI> to the cause of the Eng∣lish,
had supported their ally, had fought his and their battles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Defence of Lord Pigot, p. 40.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>On the 28th of April 1758,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1758. M. Lally ar∣rives at Pon∣dicherry.</NOTE> a considerable reinforcement of
troops arrived at Pondicherry, under the command of the Count
de Lally. The known superiority of the French on the coast, prior
to the coming of this force, had determined the English Presidency
to suspend all operations in the field, and to distribute the troops in
the different garrisons<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cambridge, p. 123.</NOTE>. On the very evening of Lally's landing
at Pondicherry, he ordered one thousand men, under Count
d'Estaign, to march towards Fort St. David; but it was the 26th
of May before he opened his batteries against the place.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes Fort St. David.</NOTE> On the
first of June the fort surrendered, after a feeble resistance; and
Devi-Cotah was evacuated before the enemy marched that way.
Nothing less, than the total expulsion of the British from the coast
of Coromandel, if not from all India, was the object of the French;
who were, now, possessed of a greater force of Europeans, than was
ever before, at one period, in that country. Madras was the next
object, after the taking of Fort St. David. But the superiority of
the British squadron rendered it difficult, if not impracticable, to
transport, by sea, the necessary stores from Pondicherry for besieg∣ing
the place; and Lally had neither money nor influence in the
country, to enable him to carry them by land.</P>
<P>The wealth of the Rajah of Tanjore had rendered him a fit object
of plunder;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To supply his wants, he re∣selves to at∣tack Tanjore.</NOTE> and, besides, the French government at Pondicherry
were possessed of such a claim as might give a colour of justice to
demands upon that wealth. When, in the year 1751, Muziffer∣Jung,
as Subah of the Decan, and Chunder-Saib, in quality of Na∣bob
of Arcot, had reduced Pretaupa-Sing to extremity, he com∣pounded
the arrears of tribute,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His claims on the Rajah.</NOTE> from the death of Sipadar Ali in 1742,
at 5,600,000 rupees<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">632,500l.</NOTE>. Unable, or rather unwilling, to pay this
<PB N="99" REF="112"/>
sum, he had given his bond to Chunder-Saib; and Chunder-Saib
had transferred his property, in that deed, to the French government.
To add political importance to this kind of private claim, the Count
de Lally, in imitation of the English in 1749, espoused the cause of
a pretender to the government of Tanjore. The wretched figure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He raises up a pretender.</NOTE>
whom he resolved to raise, on this occasion, to favour his views,
was one Gatica, the uncle of Shaw-jî, whose pretensions the Eng∣lish
Presidency had asserted, where they suffered themselves to be
purchased from his cause by the cession of Devi-Cotah. His ho∣nourable
allies had agreed to detain Shaw-jî, in prison, when they
settled matters with his rival; but the unfortunate man found means
to escape from their hands. In revenge for his flight, or to secure
his inactivity, they threw Gatica into the fetters from which his ne∣phew
had extricated himself. With Fort St. David, he fell into the
hands of Lally, who produced him at Pondicherry, “with much
ostentation and ceremony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 318.</NOTE>,” to raise the apprehensions, and con∣sequently
to open the treasure, of Pretaupa-Sing to his intended de∣mands<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme and Lawrence, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The preparations and intentions of Lally having reached the ears
of Pretaupa-Sing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah solicits the aid of the Nabob, &amp;c.</NOTE> he solicited the aid of the Nabob and the protec∣tion
of the English. Though his former conduct had given him no
claim to assistance from either, they were both willing to give, from
policy, what he had no right to ask from their gratitude. They,<NOTE PLACE="marg">which he is ordered to re∣ceive.</NOTE>
therefore, authorized Captain Calliaud, who then commanded at
Tritchinopoly, to act as occasion might require. But that officer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His undeci∣sive and treacherous conduct.</NOTE>
from his personal knowledge of the character of the Rajah, toge∣ther
with “the continual and authentic accounts, which he obtained
of the duplicity of his councils<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 322.</NOTE>,” was afraid of “sending succours,
which might be betrayed to the enemy<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” He was apprehensive,
<PB N="100" REF="113"/>
on the other hand, that his with-holding assistance might furnish the
timidity of Pretaupa, with a pretext to make terms with the
French. “He, therefore, at all risques, detached five hundred
Sepoys with ten European artillery-men, and three hundred Col∣leries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 322.</NOTE>,” to Tanjore.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distrusted by Major Cal∣liaud.</NOTE> This force, he deemed, was sufficient to
keep up the hopes of the Rajah of receiving more; having pru∣dently
resolved to accommodate his own future aid to the conduct
of Pretaupa; which, as he had reason to distrust it, he gave direc∣tions
should be narrowly watched<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Lally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah treats with the French.</NOTE> marching from Pondicherry on the 18th of June, arrived
on the same day of July, within six miles of Tanjore. Pretaupa∣Sing,
having endeavoured to amuse the French in their march with
negociation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Folly and precipitation of Lally.</NOTE> their commander, with a precipitate folly, inseparable
from his character, exposed his own incapacity of enforcing any
terms, by the nature of those he proposed. Having reduced his
claim of more than five millions of rupees, to one million; he in∣sisted
upon receiving ten thousand pounds weight of gun-powder.
Though the want of an article,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1758.</NOTE> so necessary to the operations of war,
might be thought a sufficient encouragement against all treaty, the
feeble spirit of Pretaupa gave way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah is inti∣midated.</NOTE> upon the arrival of some bat∣tering
cannon, from Karrical<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 324.</NOTE>. “He conferred in earnest with
Lally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 29.</NOTE> and concluded a treaty, the terms of which were founded on
that commander's declaration, that he intended to march from Tan∣jore
against Tritchinopoly<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">He agrees to aid the French against the Nabob and English.</NOTE> To aid the French against his supe∣rior,
the Nabob, as well as the English, the allies of that prince, whose
troops were actually defending his capital, the treacherous and timid
Pretaupa “agreed to lend three hundred of his best horse, to furnish
one thousand Coolies and Mattockmen, and to supply the French
army with provisions during the siege<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” He also consented “to
<PB N="101" REF="114"/>
deliver two respectable hostages, and to give five hundred thousand
rupees<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">62,5<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0l.</NOTE>, to be paid, at different periods, and upon the execution of
stated terms<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. pr 324, 325.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The languor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rashness of Lally breaks the treaty.</NOTE> with which his part of the treaty was executed by
Pretaupa Sing, inflamed the irascible spirit of Lally, into a re∣newal
of the war. The puerile threats of that officer improved
the natural timidity of the Rajah into despair. He resolved to de∣fend
himself to the last extremity. He redoubled his solicitations for
aid from Tritchinopoly. Captain Calliaud, who was no stranger to
the late negociations, “had hitherto thought it unsafe to trust any
more troops in the Rajah's power, whilst making engagements to
assist the French, in the reduction of Tritchinopoly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 326.</NOTE>.” But, being
convinced, from this last rupture, that the time of negociation was
past, he detached on the 6th of August a considerable reinforcement
to Tanjore. Lally, having opened his batteries on the 2d, had on
the 7th made a breach in the wall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He raises the siege.</NOTE> But, having expended his am∣munition,
and being also terrified, by the defeat of the French
squadron, on the coast, he called a council of war, in which it was
resolved to raise the siege<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orme, Cambridge, India Papers, Pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im.</NOTE>. In his retreat he was harassed by the
Tanjorines; and, thus, ended an expedition, undertaken through
distress, carried on in folly, and defeated by passion and impatience.</P>
<P>Though the ineffectual hostilities against Tanjore had demonstrated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French superior in force to the English.</NOTE>
that the French were destitute of the means of war, as well as of an
able commander for carrying it on, their superiority in numbers still
induced the British to confine themselves within their forts. The
Count de Lally, with all the intemperance and impatience of his
violent mind, quarrelled with his friends, whilst he made rapid pre∣parations
for attacking his enemies. His disappointment, rather
than defeat, before Tanjore, had roused his indignation, as having
<PB N="102" REF="115"/>
proceeded from a contemptible enemy; and he resolved to recover
from a more respectable foe, the laurels, which his own precipitate
folly had lost.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lally takes Arc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</NOTE> Having taken the field, in the end of September,

<P>On the 12th of the same month, a considerable reinforcement,
from the French settlements in Golconda, having crossed the moun∣tains,
behind the pagoda of Tripetti, arrived at Arcot. This addi∣tional
force escorted a considerable sum of money, which, with sup∣plies
of the same kind from Mauritius, enabled Lally to prosecute
the war, with vigour<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Orme, India Papers, passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Presidency at Fort St. George,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations for the de∣fence of Ma∣dras.</NOTE> no longer in doubt concern∣ing
Lally's intention to lay siege to that place, began to prepare for
a vigorous defence. An officer of the most distinguished merit,
Colonel Lawrence, commanded the garrison; but the nominal “de∣fence
of the siege<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 388.</NOTE>” was committed, by a vote of the Council, to
Mr. George Pigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Pigot to have the command.</NOTE> then President for the Company, at Madras.
This gentleman, though bred to trade, was possessed of personal re∣solution;
and he had once seen the face of an enemy, about seven
years before<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 181.</NOTE>. “Every good officer being in the field,” in the
middle of July 1751, Mr. Saunders, then Governor of Fort St.
David, ordered Mr. Pigot, one of the Council, to conduct a convoy
of stores to Verdachellum, a sort to the north of the river Coleroon.
This service he performed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His former military ac∣tions.</NOTE> without loss; but being attacked, upon
his return, by the troops of a Polygar, with match lock guns, Mr.
Pigot had the good fortune to save himself, by the speed of his

the siege<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 388.</NOTE>,” directed him to consult Colonel Lawrence, on all occa∣sions,
<PB N="103" REF="116"/>
and on extraordinary emergencies to assemble a council of the
superior officers of the garrison<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 388.</NOTE>. Mr. Pigot, during the subsequent
siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His assiduity and care of the provisions.</NOTE> exhibited resolution and activity. He visited the works every
day, encouraged the garrison, and rewarded their services, with
money. But the most commendable part of his conduct was his

<P>To these arrangements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparations made, without the sort.</NOTE> within the walls of Fort St. George, pre∣parations
were made, without, to disturb the siege, with which it
was threatened. The garrison of Chingleput was reinforced. Cap∣tain
Calliaud, with a party, was ordered from Tritchinopoly, upon
which the command and protection of that city were committed to
Captain Joseph Smith, who has since made such a distinguished
figure, on the coast of Coromandel. That officer had, by orders

Major Calliaud, after having encountered various difficulties and

he thought the English did not care what befel the territories of their
allies, provided they could defend their own. But as he could not
allege this indifference to himself, when attacked by the French, he
cited the unconcern,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His sarcasm on the Eng∣lish.</NOTE> with which they had suffered “that nation to
take every fort belonging to the Nabob, and even his capital of Ar∣cot,
without making any efforts to protect them;” yet “he knew

<P>To add insult to his want of attention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He refuses as∣sistance, and favours the French.</NOTE> the Rajah permitted the two
French hostages, whom he had detained, ever since Lally's ineffectual

with the Major, he alleged, that he had sufficiently exposed himself
to the resentment of the French, by having already sent three hun∣dred
horse to the assistance of the English. Yet these horse were not
furnished by the Rajah, but hired in his territories, by the Nabob's
agents<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 399.</NOTE> The Rajah,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1758. His evasve conduct.</NOTE> knowing that Calliaud could raise no money,

affairs, offered four hundred horse, provided he would discharge
their arrears. In vain did Calliaud apply for money at Tanjore, at
Negapatam and even at Tritchinopoly. The agents, who had
been accustomed, in the first of those places, to give money, for bills
on the Presidency, were either intimidated by the Rajah, or terrified
by the untoward aspect of the times. The Dutch of Negapatam,
though they proffered a loan, took such advantage of the state of
things, that they demanded a discount of 25 per cent. upon bills;
and the Shroff at Tritchinopoly “retracted his promise, and refused
to supply money, upon any terms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 439.</NOTE>.” But though Mr. Norris, a
member of the Council, who happened to pass through Tanjore, on

he and his allies despaired of being able to keep the place. The
Nabob announced by his agent, that he intended to come into the
city of Tanjore, on his way to Tritchinopoly; and that he expected,
as usual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He refuses to admit him into Tanjore, or to visit him.</NOTE> to be met by the Rajah on the road. But the Rajah, “ei∣ther
from the malignant pleasure of insulting his superior in dis∣tress,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 439.</NOTE>,”
or from his dread of the French, refused either to admit
the Nabob into the city, or to pay him the customary visit, without

Calliaud, “who endeavoured to correct his contumacy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” The

the infirmities of age and by disease, found himself obliged to re∣linquish

Colonel Draper, the next in command, whose health was impaired
by the climate, found himself obliged to quit the coast. Major
Calliaud succeeded the first, in the command of the Company's
troops; and Major Brereton the latter, at the head of those of the
king. After some movements of no consequence, the two armies,
as it were by mutual consent, remained inactive during the greatest

French were mutinous, for want of clothing and pay. About three

of their arms in the eyes of the country powers; and the pos∣session
of that place was of so much importance to the French,
that they fat down before it in the month of January. Lieutenant-Colonel
Coote, in relieving Wandewash, defeated the whole force
of the enemy in a regular battle. Having lost near eight hundred
dead and wounded in the action and left all their cannon and other
trophies and spoils of war on the field, they were obliged to shut
themselves up in Pondicherry.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arcot taken,</NOTE> Arcot, the capital of the Carnatic,

<P>During these transactions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob pro∣poses to return to Arcot.</NOTE> in the Carnatic, the Nabob remained,

returning to the centre of his government<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 599.</NOTE>. Solicitous to make his

without having performed any service<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 495.</NOTE> After the battle of Wande∣wash,
changing with the current of fortune, not only the Rajah had
sent horse and foot, but even the two Marawars their Colleries to the

soon withdrew his troops. When Smith arrived at Tanjore,
the Rajah, who either was, or pretended to be, indisposed, with dif∣ficulty
admitted his visit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Evasive con∣duct of the Rajah.</NOTE> He recommended him to his Dubbeer,

<P>The blockade of Pondicherry employed the arms of the English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blockade of Pondicherry.</NOTE>
during the remaining part of the year 1760. M. Lally, to extricate
himself, from his distressed situation, had entered into a treaty with
the Mysoreans, with whom the French had maintained a correspon∣dence,
ever since the war, they had jointly carried on, from 1752 to
1755.<NOTE PLACE="marg">French treaty with Hyder-Ali.</NOTE> A revolution had happened in Mysore, by which Lally had
hoped to profit. Hyder-Ali, a Mahommedan partizan, who had
distinguished himself in the service of the Rajah of Mysore as a soldier
of fortune, had found means to become his minister. Having displaced
the uncle of the young prince, he seized the reins of government;
but to provide against a reverse of fortune, he was anxious to ac∣quire
a place of retreat. Such a place Lally promised to procure
for him in the Carnatic; which, together with other terms, beyond
the power of the French to fulfil, induced the new regent to send
troops and provisions to Pondicherry. But the first soon failed;
<PB N="110" REF="123"/>
and the latter, with the usual fickleness of Asiatics, retired. The

<P>With Pondicherry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of the French expires in In∣dia.</NOTE> the power of France, on the continent of In∣dia,
expired. Some forts of little consequence, in the center of the
Carnatic, were garrisoned by French troops; but when the trunk

in February, to Major Preston, at discretion; and the almost im∣pregnable
fortress of Gingee could only secure the honours of war
to its garrison, which capitulated to Captain Smith on the fifth of
April<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. ii. p. 733.</NOTE>. The fall of that place terminated the war which had con∣tinued,
with little intermission, for fifteen years, between the Eng∣lish
and French, on the coast of Coromandel. The same current of
misfortune had overwhelmed the latter, in every other part of In∣dia.
Their government and commerce were extirpated in Bengal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their go∣vernment and commerce ex∣tirpated.</NOTE>
They had lost the northern provinces, which had been their reward
for the murder of Nazir Jung, the untimely death of his son Mu∣ziffer
and their support of his brother Sullabut, as Subah of the
Decan. A few military adventurers of their nation had retired to
Mysore, in pursuit of fortune and subsistence; and these, with some
trading houses on sufferance at Surat and Calicut, became a kind of
insult on the former power of the French, by connecting its memory
with misfortune.</P>
<P>Though the hostilities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The English and French only auxili∣aries.</NOTE> between the English and French Compa∣nies,
had become a part of the war between the two nations, as each
was assisted by its respective sovereign, they were both, strictly
speaking, but auxiliaries to the rivals for the Nabobship of the Car∣natic.
The English,<NOTE PLACE="marg">English con∣sidered them∣selves as sub∣jects of the Mogul em∣pire.</NOTE> at least, considered themselves, as only con∣tending
for the legal government, under which they had so long

of the empire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He supported the assertion with indisputable
facts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The family of Anwar-ul-dien its legal officers.</NOTE> Anwar-ul-dien was the acknowledged, undoubted, and legal

assassinated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The French, by opposing them, become rebels.</NOTE> by the intrigues of the French; and they continued their
rebellion against the Mogul, in the person of his undoubted repre∣sentative
Mahommed Ali, as his rights to his government had not
only been derived from a legal viceroy, but had also been approved
by the court of Delhi<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 35, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The French,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They support usurpers,</NOTE> on the other hand, had uniformly supported usur∣pation,
rebellion, and assassination. Having contributed to the
murder of Nazir-Jung, the lawful viceroy of the Decan, they raised
Muziffer-Jung to the vacant Musnud. This Suba, whose only title to
office arose from murder, appointed Chunder-Saib, his deputy, in the
Carnatic. The usurpation of Muziffer terminating with his life, scarce
two months after his elevation, the French created another fictitious
viceroy in the Decan. Under this illegal viceroy, they obtained some
provinces for themselves and disposed of the governments of others,
by his illegal commissions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">who never re∣ceived com∣missions from Delhi.</NOTE> Notwithstanding the declining state of
the empire, and the weakness of the prince, who sat upon the throne,
<PB N="112" REF="125"/>
the court of Delhi could never be persuaded to give validity, by
commissions, to such daring invasions, upon its authority. Upon
the death of Nazir Jung, his eldest brother Ghazi-ul-dien was ap∣pointed
governor-general of the Decan; and when that viceroy was
poisoned, by the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urement of Sullabut Jung, his son of the same

<P>It appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion of facts.</NOTE> by the acknowledgment of the President, acting in his

settled on the coast of Coromandel, owned themselves, on all occa∣sions,

that they considered the French, who were on the same footing with

owned, that they executed, with so much spirit and so effectually,
that duty, that they deserved every reward, consistent with their
original condition and fundamental tenure, in the empire.</P>
<P>There is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nabob's supporting them, the ori∣ginal cause of the misfor∣tunes of his family.</NOTE> however, great reason to believe, that the war, which
was brought to such a happy conclusion, by the spirit of the British,
had originally sprung from the “adherence of the family of Anwar-ul-dien,
to their cause. Had the Nabob continued to observe the
treaty of neutrality, concluded with the French, in the end of 1746,
M. Dupleix would not, probably, have had recourse to a prison at
Satarah, to raise a rival, for the government of the Carnatic. But
when Fort St. David was threatened, in March 1747, the Nabob,
studious to preserve the peace of the province, made preparations,
which plainly indicated his determined resolution, to support the
English interest, then greatly on the decline, on the coast. His son,
the present Nabob, with whom and his brother the French had set∣tled
the treaty of neutrality, made no secret of the indignation,
which the conduct of that nation had excited in his mind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. To
these sources ought, perhaps, to be traced, the extreme animosity,
which the French exhibited, upon every occasion, against the family
of Anwar-ul-dien<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de Dupleix's Letter to Naz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Jang.</NOTE>. Be that as it will, it is certain, that the pre∣sent
Nabob ascribed all the succeeding wars with the French, the
death of his father, and the ruin of all his fortune and country, to
<PB N="114" REF="127"/>
the zeal, which he himself had shewn in favour of the English,
in the years 1747 and 1748<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Letter to Mr. Secretary Pitt, Feb. 1761.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They, how∣ever, extricate him from it.</NOTE> This circumstance occasioned no
diminution of that gratitude, which he owed to their successful ex∣ertions
in extricating him and his family, from the difficulties,
in which they had been involved, by their attachment.</P>
<P>When the French were inclosed within the bound-hedge of Pon∣dicherry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nabob thinks seri∣ously of an agreement between him and the Eng∣lish.</NOTE>
in 1760, the Nabob began seriously to think of forming
a new government, or rather a new constitution, between himself
and his successful allies. The ravages of the French, Mysoreans
and Marattas; the public calamities inseparable from a long series of
hostilities; the refractory conduct of Rajahs, Polygars and Kille∣dars,
in not only with-holding their just tribute, but even aiding the
enemies of the lawful government, had impoverished the country,
and ruined the finances of the prince. The treasure of Anwar-ul-dien
had been long exhausted, by the misfortunes of his family.
The precarious revenue, irregularly collected, from such districts, as
had not been entirely ruined, by the depredations, or possessed by
the power of the enemy, had been expended, as soon as received.
But the late defeat of the French, and the almost certain prospect of
their being driven entirely from the country, seemed to promise
times of tranquillity and prosperity, which, with proper manage∣ment,
might supply the waste made by a war of near fifteen years.</P>
<P>On the 13th of June 1760,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Terms of that agreement.</NOTE> the Nabob wrote a letter to Mr. Pigot,
the Company's President at Madras, containing terms, which, though
less than his gratitude wished to give<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Papers, passim.</NOTE>, were greater than his abili∣ties.
His propositions were, that twenty-eight lacks of rupees,
charged upon the gross revenue of the Carnatic, should be paid <HI>per
annum</HI> to the Company, till his debts should be extinguished: That
this annual allowance should commence, on the 11th of July 1760:
That, besides the sum mentioned, which was to be paid at Madras,
<PB N="115" REF="128"/>
the Nabob should advance annually three lacks of rupees to the pay∣master
at Tritchinopoly, “for defraying the expence of the Com∣pany's
people in that garrison.” That should Pondicherry be re∣duced,
the whole money, due to the Company, should be paid, in
one year, provided the English should add a proper force to the
troops of the Nabob, to bring to account such vassals of the Carna∣tic,
as had with-held their tribute and allegiance, during the late
troubles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot to the Nabob, June 23d, 1760. Nabob's Papers, vol. iii. p. 44, 45.</NOTE>. That, as the sum reserved for the expences of his govern∣ment
was the least, to which those expences could be reduced, he ex∣pected,
in case any of the districts, between Nellore and Tinnevelly,
should either be lost to himself, or plundered by the French or Marat∣tas,
the amount of such loss, being fairly and reasonably settled, should
be deducted from the twenty-eight lacks, assigned to the Company.</P>
<P>In return for this large assignment on his revenues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His demands on that ac∣count</NOTE> the Nabob
declared, that he expected the Company were not to countenance
the refractoriness of dependents, Killedars or Polygars. That the
English officers, in the different garrisons, should not interfere in the
affairs of the country, nor the disputes of the inhabitants. That the
Presidency should write to such chiefs as depended, by different te∣nures,
on the Carnatic, announcing the present agreement. That
the Company should aid, upon requisition, the different renters, in
the collection of the revenue. That they should not employ, in
their service, any person in an office of trust, under the Nabob's
government. That the Nabob's flag should be hoisted, in the differ∣ent
forts, instead of that of the English. And to conclude the
whole, the Nabob desired, that the friendship between him and the
Company should be transferred, after his death, to his children and
continue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">are agreed to,</NOTE> as long as Madras should remain. Mr. Pigot, in the most
explicit manner, agreed to all these articles; and declared, “that he
made the agreement, in full hopes, that it will for ever remain
<PB N="116" REF="129"/>
firm, and be truly performed by both parties, as long as the Eng∣lish
shall remain in Hindostan. By the blessing of God,” conti∣nues
the President, “the Company will never fail to give proofs of
their friendship and sincerity to you and your family, and will be
firm in supporting you and your posterity, in the Subadary of the
Carnatic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pigot to the Nabob, June 23d, 1760, ubi supra.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this solemn agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presiden∣cy's breach of faith.</NOTE> the President and Coun∣cil,
soon after, applied to the Nabob, for fifty lacks of rupees, instead
of the sum specified in Mr. Pigot's letter of the 23d of June 1760.
Driven to extremities, by the earnest instances of the Presidency, he
was obliged to borrow money from individuals, to silence the cla∣morous
demands of the government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first cause of the misfor∣tunes of the Nabob.</NOTE> Hence first proceeded that

“the residence of his friends.” But those friends charged him

the subjects of the Mogul empire<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Governor Saunders's Letter to the French Deputies, passim.</NOTE>, and had supported its

wished for nothing less, than the prosperity of the affairs of the

they had directed Governor Pigot to write a circular letter to those
chiefs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They write a circular letter to the tribu∣taries.</NOTE> expressive of their sentiments. They informed the Rajahs,

of Mahommed Ali, and is obedient to his Highness's
orders. You are, therefore, implicitly to obey his orders and
commands, which will be for your advantage<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Pigot's General Letter, ubi supra.</NOTE>.” Governor
Pigot, in his private capacity, expressed the sentiments, which he
now, enforced, in his public character. In his letter to the Nabob's
wife, dated the first of July 1760, he says: “The Company has,
with great pleasure, agreed to all his Excellency's business, agree∣able

purport of the general letter to the chiefs of the Carnatic, he says:
“By the blessing of God, the WHOLE Carnatic is entirely and
firmly established in the Nabob and his posterity. As long as

<PB N="119" REF="132"/>
to have subsided, in the summer of 1761. That prince, there∣fore,
renewed his requisition of assistance, in the month of August,
by laying before them an account of the tribute, which had been
with-held, from his government, during the late troubles. The
infamous Mortaz-Ali, who had murdered two princes of his own
family, and usurped the title of Nabob of the Carnatic, still remain∣ed
in possession of the strong fortress of Velore. Having, not only,
refused his tribute, but even the very shew of obedience, though
within a few miles of the capital of the province, he was the first of
the refractory vassals of the Carnatic, who was called to account.

He was, accordingly, reduced; but the trouble and time, which the
conquest cost, furnished the President with a specious excuse<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 53.</NOTE>, for
a change of sentiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1762. January.</NOTE> no less sudden than it was, at that time, un∣accountable.</P>
<P>The Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob's claims upon Tanjore.</NOTE> in his letter in the month of August 1761, had ex∣plained

empire, accountable to him for his tribute and feudal services, as
Nabob of the Carnatic, by the fundamental laws of the empire. He
said, “that Sadatulla Cawn, during his government, had only re∣ceived
annually ten lacks of rupees, from the Rajah; but that his
nephew Doost-Ali, who succeeded him in the government, obliged
him to pay ninety lacks at one time. That Sipadar Ali, the son of
Doost-Ali, having obtained the Nabobship, upon the defeat and
death of his father, in the month of May 1740, not only obliged
the Rajah to pay eighty lacks, but, upon his continuing refractory,
<PB N="120" REF="133"/>
seized his capital and person, placed a garrison in Tanjore, and gave
the management of civil affairs to one of his own officers. That
when the Marattas took Chunder-Saib and Tritchinopoly, in March
1741, Pretaupa-Sing, recovered, by their means, his liberty and
government. That, when the Nizam came to regulate the affairs
of the Carnatic in 1743, Coja Abdulla, whom he had appointed
Nabob, received fifty lacks, from that Rajah. That Anwar-ul-dien,
who obtained the government, upon the death of Abdulla, settled
the tribute, at the annual sum of seven lacks, together with two
lacks more as presents and Durbar charges; which was one lack
less, than the Rajah's predecessors had paid, under the regular and
peaceable government of Sadatulla. That, as the Rajah, neglected
or postponed the payment of his tribute, Anwar-ul-dien had been
obliged to march an army against him, three different times. That,
the last of those times, the Rajah had amicably paid a part of his
tribute, and granted a bond for seven lacks, to be paid with interest.
That the Rajah, taking advantage of the civil wars, had neglected
for the last fourteen years, to pay his tribute to the lawful go∣vernment;
but the Nabob, at the same time, owned that Muziffer
Jung and Chunder-Saib had received eleven lacks, out of seventy
which the Rajah had promised, when they besieged Tanjore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. VI. p. 50.</NOTE>. As a
deduction from the sum due for tribute, the Nabob acknowledged,
that, during his distress when Tritchinopoly was besieged, the Ra∣jah
had obtained some exemptions in the arrears, to induce him to
give heartily his assistance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 51.</NOTE>.</P>

in settling accounts, with the “principal powers,” he should have
said vassals, of the Carnatic. As for pitiful Killedars or petty Poly∣gars,
he consigned them, without di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinction, to the discipline of the
sword<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But he declared, “that he thinks it proper to try what
can be done with the <HI>king</HI> of Tanjore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His extraor∣dinary conduct.</NOTE> by way of treaty.” In pur∣suing
this peaceable system, Mr. Pigot forgot his former professions
and his present station. Though he actually was, and had owned
himself a subject of the Mogul empire, and consequently promised
obedience to the Nabob of the Carnatic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Governor Pigot to the Nabob's Wife, July 1, 1760.</NOTE>, the legal representative
of the emperor, he assumed the functions of sovereignty; and, with∣out

a war<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. VI. p. 53.</NOTE>. To explain the nature of the office, thus arbitrarily
assumed by Mr. Pigot, a short disquisition may be necessary.</P>
<P>Though the terms <HI>mediator</HI> and <HI>arbitrator</HI> are sometimes indis∣criminately
used by writers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distinction between a mediator and an arbitrator.</NOTE> who have treated on the law of nature
and nations, there seems to be an essential difference, in point of
degree, in their meaning. When two states, independent of each
other, enter into disputes, which may terminate in a war, they may
chuse another power, as an umpire to decide their differences; and
that umpire is properly called a <HI>mediator.</HI> When two private men
mutually refer the decision of their disputes to a third person, that
person is rightly named an <HI>arbitrator.</HI> In both cases, the consent
of the parties is necessary, to constitute not only the power, but
even the very existence of the <HI>mediator</HI> or <HI>arbitrator.</HI> This regu∣lar
appointment to the office invests it with decisive authority;
“for every man makes him the supreme judge of his own ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the office of a mediator.</NOTE>

sovereign states quarrel about their respective rights and possessions,
a third frequently interposes and endeavours, by authority, by ar∣gument,
and even by intreaty, to bring them to terms of accommo∣dation.
But the interposing state is not properly a mediator<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pussendor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lib. v. cap. 13. § 7.</NOTE>. In
this case, the decision of the self-created mediator is not binding
on the parties; as any one of them is at liberty either to accept
or refuse the offer<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Many necessary qualifications were evidently wanting to Mr. Pi∣got,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Pigot had no title to that office.—Facts, reasons, and arguments.</NOTE>
to give him a title to the character of <HI>mediator</HI> between the
Nabob of the Carnatic and the Rajah of Tanjore. The quarrel was
not between two independent states. Had that even been the case,
Mr. Pigot was neither an independent prince himself, nor the repre∣sentative
of an independent state, to give him a colour of right to
interpose. The Rajah was a tributary, a feudatory, a vassal, to the
Mogul empire; the Nabob was the deputy of that empire in the
Carnatic, the mediate power, to whom the Rajah was accountable,
for his duty to the throne. The Nabob, finding that the Rajah had
failed in that duty, had an undoubted right by his office, to require
the performance of the terms of his tenure. Should the Rajah's
obstinacy render hostility necessary, it could not be called a war, but
a rebellion, on his part. Should even the demands, made by the
Nabob, have been unjust, he was alone accountable for his conduct
to the emperor, his sovereign, and not to Mr. Pigot, who was him∣self
an inferior subject to the Mogul. The truth is, the Nabob had
no right, strictly speaking, to diminish, either by treaty or com∣promise,
the tribute or the feudal duties, which the Rajah owed
to the empire; and had he even consented to Mr. Pigot's me∣diation,
the latter, by accepting that office, would have infringed

In a letter to the Nabob, dated May 31st, the President says, “The

political character of the Rajah, and the tenure by which he held his
government, Mr. Pigot adds a specimen of his own knowledge of the
law of nations. “It is a custom,” says he, “when <HI>two</HI> states dis∣agree,

<P>Though there is some impropriety in calling one's self a STATE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His princely language.</NOTE>
the language of the President is truly PRINCELY, in the preceding

<P>The event shewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His exertion of power.</NOTE> that the President assumed no greater power,

that he could not inforce his own. In vain he requested, that the
discussion of a point, which he perceived was to be interpreted against
his claims, should be postponed. The President was bent on a
treaty, and a treaty was consequently made. Mr. Du Prè, a gen∣tleman

agent from the Nabob and Mr. Pigot.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Du Prè examines the claims of the Nabob, and allegations of the Rajah.</NOTE> Having examined the alle∣gations

It was proved, that the Rajah had fallen in arrear, for the tribute of
many years; but it also appeared, that the Nabob had relinquished,
in his distress, his claim to the sums payable for ten of those years;
as an inducement to the Rajah to give his assistance in the late war;
which, however, he never heartily gave. The Nabob affirmed, that
the Rajahs of Tanjore, had paid annually twenty lacks, during the
Nabobships of Sadatulla and Doost-Ali. He owned, however, that
his father, the late Nabob, had settled it at seven lacks, with two
lacks of Durbar charges. Pretaupa Sing, on the contrary, alleged,
that though large sums had been extorted by force, the stated and
regular Peishcuish was no more than two lacks, <HI>per annum,</HI> to
the Mogul, and two to the Nabob of Arcot, as a customary

It is impossible to reconcile so wide a difference, in a manner con∣sistent

was much larger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Facts relative to both.</NOTE> even in peaceable times, than Pretaupa Sing

sums paid to Sipadar Ali, to Chunder-Saib, to Coja Abdulla, and
other Nabobs, ought not to form precedents, as they were rather
fines for disobedience, than arrears of tribute. Besides, when re∣fractory
subjects in India force the sovereign to have recourse to arms,
he obliges them, when reduced, to pay the expences of the war;

“friendly letter,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">which are re∣fused by Mr. Pigot.</NOTE> by the hands of Sambo-jî Punt, he says: “I looked
upon the treaty, as it now stands, to be so favourable to You, that
I really flattered myself, that you would have been well satisfied
<PB N="128" REF="141"/>
with it, and particularly the article of future Peishcuish. I need
not recal to your remembrance, the transactions of former go∣vernments
a very slight reflection must convince you, that in
this article you are <HI>highly</HI> favoured. It has cost me a great deal
of trouble to <HI>reduce</HI> it, to the sum stipulated, and I should be really
ashamed to ask the Nabob to make any abatement<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. VI. p. St, 82.</NOTE> It appears,
from the passage cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Real opinion of Mr. Pigot of his own treaty.</NOTE> that the very man, who made the treaty,
thought it more favourable to the Rajah, than to his superior the
Nabob. That the Peishcuish had been reduced, from what it had for∣merly
been; and that Mr. Pigot himself was convinced, he had al∣ready
used so much freedom with the claims of the Nabob, that
“he should be ashamed” to encroach further on his rights.</P>
<P>The Presidency were themselves sensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presiden∣cy write their excuses for their conclud∣ing it, to the Directors.</NOTE> that the treaty, which
had been forced on the Nabob, was so inadequate to his just claims,
that they shewed an inclination to excuse it to the Court of Directors,
in their letter of the 9th of November 1762. Instead of urging the
right the Rajah had to such favourable conditions, they pleaded their
own inability to bring him to justice, as their chief motive to the
treaty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 83.</NOTE>. Their want of a sufficient force, the expence of an expe∣dition,
the danger of raising other enemies, in case of a rupture
with the Rajah, the incapacity of the Nabob to recover a single ru∣pee,
without the assistance of the Company, were the arguments
produced, to justify their conduct<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But what necessity was there,
for making any demands, as they own they could enforce none?
The Nabob wished to postpone the business, till a more fit opportu∣nity.
Pretaupa Sing would have been glad to have retained the pal∣try
sum, he advanced. The best, and perhaps the only reason, for
precipitating the measure, is mentioned by the President, that he
himself “had thoughts of leaving India shortly<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 74.</NOTE>.” The event
<PB N="129" REF="142"/>
shewed, that neither arguments nor reasons were necessary, to con∣vince
the Court of Directors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">That respect∣able body desire to par∣take of the spoil.</NOTE> That respectable body, with the true
spirit of their institution, instead of being anxious about the justice
of the transaction, wished to partake of its profit. Having under∣stood,
that in addition to the twenty-two lacks, obtained as arrears
of peishcuish, four lacks had been given, as a present, the honour∣able
Court say, in their letter of the 30th of December 1763:
Now if this last named sum was given as a present, it seems as if
the Company ought to have it for their interposition and guarantee
of the treaty. We shall be glad to have this affair explained to
us, that we may know the real state of the case, with respect to
that donation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. VI. p. 85.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Such is the history of the treaty of 1762,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion of facts, concerning the treaty of 1752.</NOTE> faithfully extracted from
the papers, which the Court of Directors have published, in justifi∣cation
of their own conduct. It has appeared, that the Presidency,
instead of aiding a friend and ally, in the recovery of his just de∣mands
upon a vassal, depending on his government, supported that
vassal, in his refractory conduct, though he had uniformly acted,
during a long series of hostility and public calamity, an undutiful
part towards his superior and had been treacherous to themselves.
That, when they ought to have made him pay his proportion of the
expences of a war, which protected him and his dominions, they
not only permitted him to “sit rent-free<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot's expression, in his letter to the Rajah, dated Jan. 30th, 1762. Rous's Ap∣pendix, p. 55.</NOTE>,” but had reduced his cus∣tomary
tribute, to less than one-half of the sum usually paid, in the
most regular and peaceable times. That, though he was bound, by
the nature of his tenure, as well as the laws of self-preservation, to
give his assistance in the war, they allowed him to set off against the
unsettled arrears of his tribute, a kind of exemption, which he had
extorted from the Nabob in his distress; and that merely as an in∣ducement
<PB N="130" REF="143"/>
to do his duty, which he otherwise refused to perform. That,
when they stripped smaller delinquents, though possessing equal rights
with him by the constitution of the country, of their territories, and
deprived them of their liberty, they soothed, flattered, and favoured
Pretaupa Sing, more guilty—but more wealthy than them all. That
the President, either ignorant of the nature of his station, or assuming
powers, to which he had no title, had arbitrarily taken to himself
the office of mediator, without any authority from the parties, upon
whose differences he was to decide. That, under this usurped cha∣racter,
he concluded a treaty, without either the communication or
consent of the Nabob; and that to give it validity, he had forcibly
seized the chop of that prince, and affixed it to the paper, with his
own hand.</P>
<P>But though the treaty of 1762 was evidently forced upon the Na∣bob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General ob∣servations.</NOTE>
as he afterwards acquiesced under the terms, he was certainly
bound to pay attention to its due performance on his part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 673.</NOTE>. This
circumstance neither he himself, nor any who has espoused his cause,
has ever once denied. The treaty had but two objects, the liquida∣tion
of past arrears of Peishcuish, and the settling the amount of
the future tribute. The very gentleman, who negociated the treaty
itself, has declared, that it “related only to matters of account<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Pie's Vindication, p. 16.</NOTE>,”
and could not “preclude the Nabob from his constitutional claims<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>”
upon the Rajah of Tanjore, as a vassal and dependent. The gua∣rantee
of the Company went only to the point of Peishcuish. “If
there existed in both, or either of the parties, any <HI>original, con∣stitutional</HI>
RIGHTS, which were not the subject of the treaty, the
Company were not bound,” they had no right, “to interfere<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11.</NOTE>.”
But, should the Nabob demand a greater tribute than that settled by
the treaty, or the Rajah either neglect or refuse to pay the stipulated
<PB N="131" REF="144"/>
sum, then the Company, though they had arbitrarily constituted
themselves umpires, were obliged to adhere to their <HI>own</HI> agreement,
and “assist the party performing against the party failing to per∣form”
his stipulation. The enforcement of their guarantee
might, as it actually happened, lead the Company, as allies or auxi∣liaries
into a war; but when a solemn war is once declared and ter∣minates
in success, the PRINCIPAL, and <HI>not</HI> the ALLY or AUXILI∣ARY,
acquires the property of what he takes from the enemy, and
that without rule or measure; so that he and his assigns are to be

possessed by the French in the Carnatic, put an end to the national

before the end of the year. Spain having suffered the elder branch
of the house of Bourbon to experience all the calamities, which
follow unsuccessful hostilities, threw its own weight into the scale of
France, when the affairs of that kingdom were too desperate to be
retrieved. The tide of British success, instead of being stopped by
this obstruction, in a manner, acquired vigour from resistance; and
the new enemy was soon involved in the same misfortunes and dis∣graces
with the old.</P>
<P>In little more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But a general peace ensues.</NOTE> than the space of a year from the commencement

acknowledged lawful Nabob of Arcot, and guaranteed, in all the

letter he informed the minister, that he had supplied the army with
provisions, during the siege. That he had prevented twenty thou∣sand
Mahommedans, who had been invited by M. Lally, from com∣ing
to the assistance of the French. That he had been, for fourteen
years, connected in their adversity as well as prosperity, with the
English. That he had assisted them at Fort St. David, before either
Mr. Griffin or Admiral Boscawen arrived. That the misfortunes of
his family proceeded, from the inveteracy of the French, on account
of his known attachment to the English; and hence he deduced the

any one of those rights.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every en∣croachment on his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the subj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cts of ei∣ther crown</NOTE> Every encroachment, upon the im∣munities

justified the interference of the party, who had adhered to the treaty,
in opposition to the party, by whom it had been violated. A consti∣tution
was formed, for the government of the Carnatic, which the
subjects of Great-Britain and France were to observe, at their peril.
Should either of these presume to invade that constitution, it was
the duty of the sovereign of such invaders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">liable to pu∣nishment, as a high misde∣meanour.</NOTE> to bring them to con∣dign
punishment, and to oblige them to make reparation; otherwise
he himself became a party, and furnished the other guarantee, with
a justifiable cause of war.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Servants of the Company conceal the guarantee from the Na∣bob.</NOTE> The servants of the East-India Company
were so sensible of the restraint, which the eleventh article of the
treaty of Paris had laid upon their avarice and ambition, that they
industriously concealed its contents from the Nabob, for several years.</P>
<P>Intelligence of the treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In contempt of the gua∣rantee, they seize a part of the Carnatic.</NOTE> which guaranteed Mahommed Ali, in
the ENTIRE possession of the Carnatic, had scarce arrived on the
coast, when the Presidency shewed their disregard, for the solemn
stipulation of their sovereign, by seizing a considerable portion of
his ally's territories. The expences of the sieges of Madras and
Pondicherry, together with that of the war in other places, being
placed to the Nabob's account, that prince had been involved in a
heavy debt to the Company. Towards the payment of this debt,
he had assigned, as has been already related, the annual sum of
twenty-eight lacks of rupees, charged upon his whole revenue.
Notwithstanding this settlement, they had demanded near double
that sum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay to the Secretary of State, Oct. 13th, 1770.</NOTE>, in one year, which his country could not afford to pay.
Mr. Pigot, the Company's President, having resolved to return to
Europe, in the end of 1763, shewed an inclination to close his go∣vernment,
with a measure, which, by bringing some splendid ad∣vantage
to the Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pre∣tence to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, not future ser∣vices.</NOTE> might throw credit on himself<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot to the Nabob, June 4th, 1763.</NOTE>. He,
therefore, desired the Nabob to cede a territory to the Company
<PB N="135" REF="148"/>
in Jaghire, as a reward for past, not as a condition of future ser∣vices<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot to the Nabob, August 13th, 1763.</NOTE></P>
<P>But before Mr. Pigot made this decisive requisition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Art and du∣plicity of Mr. Pigot,</NOTE> he had ma∣naged
matters, with an art, if not with a duplicity, unsuitable to
those lofty ideas of political honour, with which the defenders of
his conduct attempt to adorn his character. In a conversation with
the Nabob, at the Admiralty-house in Fort St. George, he first only
asked for some villages round Madras; and these only, after the
discharge of his debt to the Company<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. X. p. 160.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">who rises gra∣dually in his demands.</NOTE> At another meeting
he rose in his demands; and asked Conjaveram and other three dis∣tricts.
The Nabob, after remarking, that from soliciting for vil∣lages,
the President had increased his requisition to whole countries,
reminded him of his having ceded, at different times, St. Thomé,
Turendaporum, together with the fort and territory of Punamallee;
and, that, besides, he had relinquished the Peishcuish for Madras,
which the Company were bound to pay, by the tenure by which they
held that place<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He offers very favourable conditions.</NOTE> To this Mr. Pigot replied, “that if the four dis∣tricts
mentioned were given, the Company would be extremely
pleased and obliged to the Nabob, and would ever assist him and
his children with a proper force of Europeans, without desiring
any thing further. That till the Nabob had cleared off his debts
to the Company, the revenues of those districts, after defraying
the expences of the soldiers, should be placed to the credit of his
account<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 161.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>When the time fixed by Mr. Pigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He proceeds from solicita∣tion to requi∣sition.</NOTE> for his return to Europe, ap∣proached,
he proceeded from solicitation to requisition, as has been
already observed. The Nabob endeavoured to obtain, in writing,
those terms, which the President had verbally agreed to grant. He
<PB N="136" REF="149"/>
sent, therefore, the copy of an agreement, containing the terms al∣ready
specified; which he wished the Governor and Council to sign,
prior to their receiving his Sunneds for the Jaghire.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He refuses to ratify his own terms.</NOTE> But Mr. Pigot
returned the agreement unsigned, with every symptom of resent∣ment.
This mark of disrespect was followed, by a severe letter from
the President, in which he reminded the Nabob of his obligations to
the English; and accused him, in almost direct terms, of ingrati∣tude.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His severity to the Nabob,</NOTE>
He told him, that it did not become a man, who owed his
whole country to the Company, to ask any conditions for a part of
it; “for (said he) they do not take any thing from you; but they
“are the givers, and you are a receiver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot to the Nabob, August 13th,
1763.</NOTE>.” In confequence of these
threats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">who is forced to give un∣conditional Sunneds.</NOTE> the unfortunate Nabob was obliged to issue unconditional
Sunneds, for an extent of country, to the annual amount of fourteen
lacks of rupees<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">175,000 l.</NOTE>. The utmost favour he could obtain from his im∣perious
vassals,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is permit∣ted to rent the lands he had granted away.</NOTE> was the privilege of renting the lands, which he had
granted away. This he requested, not from hopes of profit, for
the sum is much greater, than the revenue yielded by the Jaghire;
but merely to preserve appearances, with his own subjects, by keep∣ing
up a shew of authority in districts, which were once his own<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay's Narrative, Oct. 13th,
1770.</NOTE>.
These arbitrary encroachments on the rights secured to Mahommed
Ali, by the treaty of Paris, were begun by Mr. Pigot, after he had
formally announced to the Nabob that treaty, but without mention∣ing
the guarantee<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. Pigot to the Nabob, June 4th, 1763. Mr. Pigot, in a letter to the Nabob, dated August 14th, 1763, acknowledges the receipt of the articles of the treaty, but says, they are <HI>too long to be written.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The news of the treaty of Paris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam Ali murders his brother Sul∣labut.</NOTE> which arrived at Golconda, in
autumn 1763, proved fatal to Sullabut Jung, whom the French had
raised to the Subahship of the Decan, upon the death of his ne∣phew
Muziffer, in February 1751. That weak and unfortunate
<PB N="137" REF="150"/>
prince having been divested of his authority, by his brother Nizam
Ali, had remained, for several years, in consinement. As an insult
upon his misfortunes, the usurper of his authority had permitted
him to retain the titles of government. But Sullabut owed this dis∣tinction
and the continuance of his life, to Nizam Ali's fears of the
French, who, he believed, were attached to a Subah raised by them∣selves.
But when he found, that they were excluded, by the treaty
of Paris, from his part of the Decan, he dipped his hand in his
brother's blood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nabob to Governor Palk, October 31st,

<P>Though Pretaupa Sing had been so much savoured,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretaupa had shewn no in∣clination to observe the treaty of 1762.</NOTE> in the treaty

Notwithstanding this reluctance, in the performance of his

swelled, that his country should be thereby cultivated to produce
money to pay off the debts.” He affirmed, that “even the

was not diverted from falling into the Coleroon, by its natural

friendship, which I have PROCURED in every respect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XIII. p. 187, 188.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Though Mr. Pigot had exhibited every mark of a partial friend∣ship

country of Mysore, falls through the mountains, which se∣parate
the two coasts, into the Carnatic; and, about six miles to the

The northern branch assuming the name of Coleroon, falls
into the sea at Devi-Cotah<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lawrence's Narrative, p. 17.</NOTE>; but the southern branch, retaining
that of Cavery, separates itself, about twenty miles to the eastward
of Tritchinopoly, into several large branches, which, passing through
the province of Tanjore, give its fertility to that country<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 177.</NOTE>. The
streams of the Coleroon and Cavery form, by their separation, the
island of Seringham, famous for the pagoda, from which it derives
its name. The banks of the two rivers, for some miles above and
below Tritchinopoly, “are in no part two miles asunder, in many
scarcely one: and at Coiladdy, a small fort fifteen miles to the
east of Tritchinopoly<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>,” the stream of the Cavery was certainly
intended by nature, to rejoin the Coleroon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great mound near Coiladdy, which turns its waters into Tanjore, is in the territory of Tritchino∣poly.</NOTE> But a mound of

Tanjore never extended to within many miles of the bank, that
country must have depended, from all antiquity, on the government

his pardon, for his invasion of the districts of the Marawar, in ex∣press opposition to the injunctions of his superior; for his assisting
Usoph Chan in his rebellion; and for all his past offences. He pro∣mised,
that in future neither himself nor his sons should do any
thing disagreeable to the Nabob. That, instead of aiding Usoph,
he would take the whole burden of the war against him, on himself.
That he would join the Nabob, “both in body and soul;” and that
he would consider the Nabob's enemies as his enemies, his friends
as his friends. These declarations “he confirmed with an oath, a
stronger than which, in his religion, cannot be taken<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XIII. p. 196, 197.</NOTE>.”</P>

his unwillingness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the Nabob's un∣willingness to repair the mound.</NOTE> but complied. Besides, the reluctance,
with which he was brought to confer favours upon a man, who had
added insult to injury, the Nabob had a political reason, for defer∣ring
the repairs of the bank. The Rajah's assistance was wanted
for the siege of Madura; and he knew that nothing, but necessity,
would induce him to perform his duty to his superior<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Extract of Minutes of Consultation, 28th April 1777.</P>
<P>As the Honourable Court of Directors, in their separate letter per Grenville 12th April 1775, order the Rajah of Tanjore to be re∣stored to the full and entire possession of his do∣minions
as held by him in 1762, without in∣fringing the rights of the Nabob of the Carna∣tic; and as it appears from the letters mentioned hereafter from Rajah Pretaub Sing, as well as the opinions of this Government subsequent to the conclusion of the treaty of 1762, that the right of repairing or amending the Annacutta was then acknowledged to be vested in the Na∣bob. Resolved, it is the opinion of this Board, that this right doth exist in the Nabob alone, as Soubahdar of the Carnatic, and that the Ra∣jah of Tanjore is not to begin, or carry on any repai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s whatever, unless permitted to do so by the Nabob. That agreeably to the Nabob's request, the people sent by the Rajah of Tan∣jore to the Annacutta should be forthwith re∣called, and that the Rajah be informed, it ap∣pears from the Company's records, as well as from his father's Pretaub Sing's letters, that he has no right to repair the bank, unless privi∣leged so to do by the Nabob. That the Rajah of Tanjore be also informed, the Nabob hath granted permission for the repairing the Anna∣cutta at our desire, and will send orders to his Amildar at Tritchinopoly to give every reason∣able assistance, that it may be put in the same state it was during the life of Pretaub Sing. Re∣solved also, as this has been a subject of con∣stant dispute between the Nabob and the Rajah of Tanjore, that the following references to the Records be inserted on this day's Consultation, to shew at one view to the Honourable Court of Directors, that the right now claimed by the Nabob, has ever been admitted; but that this Board have at all times considered it as a matter of great moment, that the Annacutta should be repaired whenever the banks were broken down or washed away.</P>

To explain this subject, we must recur to former times. The
city of Madura, with the province of the same name, being depen∣dent
on Tritchinopoly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jesuit's Letters, vol. ii.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion to ex∣plain the re∣bellion of Isoph Chan.</NOTE> fell into the hands of the Moguls, when
they conquered the last mentioned province. During the captivity of
Chuder-Saib in the capital of the Marattas, Madura, with the rest of
the Carnatic, became subject to the Nabob Anwar-ul-dien. When Chun∣der-Saib,
in the revolution in favour of Muziffer Jung, assumed the
title of Nabob of Arcot, Madura was seized by Allum Chan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orme, vol. i. p. 169.</NOTE>, one of his
adherents; but the power of that officer declining at the death of his
patron, the Nabob recovered the city, and placed his brother Mapheus
Chan in the government. Mapheus Chan was succeeded, in the
year 1758, by Moodally<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay's Narrative. Tetarapa
Moodally, renter of the Tinnevelly and Ma∣dura

owed his rise, like some greater men, to accident. Having en∣graved
the Company's arms on a gold plate, he suspended it from

on various occasions; and his gaining the support and friend∣ship

been a little repugnant to the latter character.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He retains the rent.</NOTE> Though the rent.

first, the most eager, sincere and powerful of those friends, was
Pretaupa Sing, Rajah of Tanjore. This approved ally of the
English and faithful dependent of the Nabob of the Carnatic en∣tered
into a correspondence with Usoph,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The corre∣spondence be∣tween them.</NOTE> and fostered those seeds of
rebellion, which that refractory chief had sown. He advised him

should the English fail to <HI>order</HI> the Nabob, to permit the mound of
the Cavery to be repaired, that he would send his troops to the
place and expect the assistance of Usoph<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. These assurances were

was uncle to the wretched Shaw-jî, lawful Rajah of Tanjore, whose
interests and liberty, the Presidency, in a manner, sold to Pretaupa
Sing, in the year 1749. Shaw-jî, having made his escape from the
hands of the Presidency, the unhappy Gatica, was confined in his

<P>When Tulja-jî had rid himself of every cause of domestic fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Having se∣cured himself, by those murders,</NOTE>
he turned his eyes towards his allies abroad. Upon receiving a
letter from Usoph Chan, who was, now, besieged in Madura, he
returned an answer, in which are the following remarkable words:
“I am convinced that you heartily wish for my prosperity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">he corre∣sponds with Usoph,</NOTE> which

some of his troops were in the camp of the besiegers of Ma∣dura.<NOTE PLACE="marg">whom he re∣solves to assist.</NOTE>
But that circumstance would facilitate the performance of
his promise to Usoph, should any reverse of fortune happen to the
arms of the Nabob and the Company. Tulja-jî and his father
permitted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He like his father sends French troops to join him.</NOTE> or rather ordered, a body of French, who were in the

punctuality,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He neglects to pay his Kists to the Company.</NOTE> his part of the treaty. Though his country yielded

was the more inexcusable, that the Nabob had relinquished four

<P>The taking of Madura,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam Ali invades the Carnatic.</NOTE> in the end of 1764, only restored the

army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He ravages the country;</NOTE> With a destructive species of war, he laid waste the open

He subjected every place, through which he directed his

the latter were only reserved for slavery. The ravages, which he had
committed, joined to the heat of the season, for it was now the middle
of April, reduced his army to great distress for want of provisions
and water. Colonel Campbell, who then commanded the joint forces of
the Nabob and Company, having marched from Arcot, came in sight

<P>During these transactions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Clive arrives at Madras. 1765.</NOTE> Lord Clive arrived at Madras on his

were much more disadvantageous, than those upon which the

were to have enjoyed the Circârs in Jaghire, on the sole condition
of military aid. By the present treaty, they promised service and
an annual rent. To pave the way for the treaty, such as it was,
the Presidency obliged the Nabob to pay five lacks of rupees to Ni∣zam
Ali<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay's Narrative. India Papers, Passim.</NOTE>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob oblig∣ed to pay him five lacks.</NOTE> though he was not to derive the value of “a single

<P>This disadvantageous and even disgraceful treaty sowed the seeds

to Nizam Ali, the Presidency ordered Colonel Smith to march to
Hydrabad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nizam Ali joined by the English.</NOTE> with a few Sepoys and a troop of horse to join that

The capture of Bengalore seems to have been the ob∣ject
of the treaty of Hydrabad, though that condition is not parti∣cularly
expressed. In Nizam Ali's march towards Mysore, and dur∣ing
his progress in that country, he was joined by different de∣tachments
of the Company's troops, under Colonel Tod, Major
Fitzgerald and others, to the number of one thousand Europeans,
and five or six battalions of Sepoys. These reinforcements enabled

notwithstanding the terms of the treaty of Hydrabad had been
much more advantageous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is displeas∣ed with the English, on account of the Circârs.</NOTE> than he had any reason to expect, he
was not pleased with the conduct of the Company, in obtaining a

Hyder Ali was equally displeased with the treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyder Ali also displeased.</NOTE> as the Presi∣dency

which they discovered to assist the Subah in invading his country.
That, prior to his expedition to Mysore, Nizam Ali had sent a
copy of his agreement to Hyder Ali. That, from these and other
circumstances, he, the Nabob, concluded that both would soon ter∣minate
their own differences, and, with their united force, attack

<P>The Subah,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768. A treaty con∣cluded.</NOTE> bent upon a peace, separated his army, accordingly,

was conferred upon the Company, for which they were to
pay seven lacks to the Nizam, and a Chout to the Marattas<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In
return the Nabob and the Company agreed to furnish Nizam Ali,
with two battalions of Sepoys, and six pieces of cannon, upon his
requisition, should the necessity of their own affairs permit them to
comply. In consideration of the losses sustained by the Company,
the Subah agreed to deduct twenty-five lacks, from the revenue
paid to him from the northern Circârs; besides two lacks for five
years from Chicacole<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vide Treaty. India House.</NOTE>. The losses and expences of war had fallen
upon the Nabob; the profits of victory were appropriated by the

<P>When the junction of Nizam Ali with Hyder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Tanjore.</NOTE> threatened the Car∣natic

that he had given orders for enlarging an old gutter, which
conveyed a part of the waters into the Coleroon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 212.</NOTE>. Upon receiving a
letter from the President, the Nabob gave instantly directions for re∣moving

aid<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 215.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He <HI>promises</HI> aid to the English; but actually assists their enemies.</NOTE> He accordingly promised publicly his aid to the English<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. “The Rajah amused them for

“Depending,” says the Rajah, “on your firm friendship, I am

<P>When Colonel Smith had separated the Company's troops from
those of Nizam Ali,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Correspon∣dence be∣tween those allies.</NOTE> and retreated into the Carnatic<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In September 1767.</NOTE>, Hyder an∣nounced
that event to his ally the Rajah of Tanjore. “You must
not imagine,” said Hyder in his letter to Tulja-jî, “that I
attend to any thing, but the destruction of our mutual enemy;
you may rest assured of this. My reason for marching into
Ballagaut is, that the English troops are retired from my coun∣try,
and are marched six or seven stages toward Trenomele. I
will, by the assistance of God, bring all the army together and
<PB N="156" REF="169"/>
punish the enemy.”—“You need not fear the enemy; depend
upon your strength, and give no money to them, nor send them
any troops, but put them off with delays; and write privately
to all the Polygars, dependent upon you, to be in readiness with
all their troops<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 51. This letter seems to have been written in the beginning of September 1767: for it alludes to the expedition of 5000 horse, under Hyder's son, who penetrated to Madras in that month. Tulja-jî wrote a very friendly answer to Hyder, to which the reader is referred. Ibid. p. 52.</NOTE>.”—The Rajah religiously observed the instruc∣tions
of his friend and ally. But so much perverted has truth been
by party, that the advocate of the Court of Directors asserts, that
the Rajah of Tanjore was persecuted by Hyder, for his uniform
attachment to the interests of the Company<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Mr. Rous's Restoration, &amp;c. con∣sidered.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>Prior to the treaty concluded in February 1768,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presidency re∣solve to carry the war into Mysore.</NOTE> with Nizam Ali,
the Presidency, encouraged by Colonel Smith's victory over the joint
forces of the allies, had resolved, not only to carry the war into
Mysore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their deceit∣ful and con∣tradictory conduct.</NOTE> but to make an absolute conquest of that country. Their
letter of the 21st of December 1767 to the Nabob, upon that sub∣ject,
is a curious instance of clumsy artifice and ill-covered Jesuitry.
They press that prince to join the army, promising to give him the
management of the conquered country: “But,” continues the Pre∣sident,
“I cannot now tell you, whom I am to appoint to manage
those parts.” They inform the Nabob, “the Company would
not desire any other countries.”—“But,” say they in the same
sentence, “the Company intend taking under their government
some other neighbouring countries at Bombay<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">President Bourchier to the Nabob, Dec.
21, 1767.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">They saddle the Nabob with the ex∣pences.</NOTE> They advise
him, that they intend to place two lacks of Pagodas to his account
of the extraordinary expences of the war. Yet they say, that it is
very uncertain whether Nizam Ali began, from his displeasure
against the Company, or on purpose to distress the Nabob. The
<PB N="157" REF="170"/>
truth is, that the war had proceeded from the rooted resentment of the
Subah against the Company, for their manner of stripping him of
the northern provinces. The Nabob appealed to themselves that this
was the case; but, as they seemed to think that his presence might
be useful to their affairs, he promised to join the army<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay's Narrative, Oct. 13th, 1770.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The object of the Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their artifice to six upon him those ex∣pences.</NOTE> in sending Mahommed Ali to the
camp, was to make a war, which the ambition of the Company had
kindled, the war of the Nabob; to furnish a colour of justice, for
their charging him with the expence. Though he was sensible of
their artifice, he thought it prudent to comply. He accordingly
joined the army; but the hands of the commanding officer being
tied up,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An inactive campaign.</NOTE> by the timidity and ignorance of field-deputies, the whole
summer of 1768 passed in inactivity and fruitless negociations for
peace. Though, by the original agreement, between the Nabob and
the Company it had been stipulated, that no business with the coun∣try
powers should be transacted, without his participation, the field∣deputies,
at the instigation of Hyder's vackeel, excluded him from
having any share,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presidency wish for peace.</NOTE> in the conferences. But Hyder, being well in∣formed,
that the Presidency wished eagerly for peace, only amused
their deputies, to stop the progress of the war; till the impatience
or terror of his enemies should enable him to dictate the terms.
Though he affected to wish, for an accommodation, he did not neg∣lect
such hostilities, as promised success. He took the important fort
of Mulwaggle. He gained some advantages over Colonel Wood,
who had attempted in vain to take the place<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Though these hostilities might have convinced the Presidency at
Fort St. George,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyder not sincere in his pacific propo∣sals.</NOTE> and their deputies in the field, that Hyder meant
nothing less, than to negociate, on equal terms, they still continued
in a manner to solicit peace. The deputies, thinking that the pre∣sence
<PB N="158" REF="171"/>
of the Nabob impeded their negociations, pressed him to re∣turn
to Madras. The Nabob argued in vain, that his presence in
the army would contribute to keep the Polygars and commanders of
forts steady to the English interest. The Presidency, entering into
the views of their deputies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insolence and injustice of the Presi∣dency.</NOTE> COMMANDED him to return. They
had even threatened him with deprivation, in a letter to the field∣deputies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay's Narrative, Oct. 13th,
1770.</NOTE>;
and, when he wrote to them complaining of this insult,
they refused to receive his letter<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He thought it prudent to return
to Madras; where he arrived, in the month of November 1768.
Colonel Donald Campbell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mismanage∣ments and misfortunes.</NOTE> a gallant and experienced officer, was ob∣liged
to quit the field, on account of his health; and he was, soon
after, followed by the field-deputies. All these things discouraged
the army, and added spirit to the enemy. Hyder attacked Colonel
Wood, plundered his baggage, and recovered all the conquered coun∣tries,
except a few places of strength. Thus ended the year 1768,
in mismanagement, disaster and disgrace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">India Papers, passim. Sir John Lindsay's
Narrative. Country Correspondence. India-House.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hyder Ali,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyder Ali in∣vades the Carnatic.</NOTE> having thus, by his address and spirit, rendered the
efforts of the Presidency against his own country abortive, prepared
to carry the war into that of the enemy. In December 1768, he
entered the Carnatic “with a considerable body of horse and foot
lightly equipped<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 15.</NOTE>,” and penetrated into the province of Tritchi∣nopoly.
Having advanced towards Tanjore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is supplied with money and provi∣sions, by the Rajah of Tan∣jore.</NOTE> his friend and secret
ally, the Rajah of that country, supplied him with four lacks of ru∣pees<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay's Narrative. Mr. Du

generals, into the provinces of Madura and Tinnevelly, who plun∣dered
<PB N="159" REF="172"/>
and destroyed the country. No part of the southern division
of the Carnatic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ravages the country.</NOTE> except the territories of the friendly Rajah of Tan∣jore,
escaped the destructive ravages of the active and enterprising
Mysorean. The English army were unprovided with cavalry, and
could neither overtake his march nor stop his progress. The horse,
which the Rajah of Tanjore had sent to the English, as a cover for
his secret connection with Hyder<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 12.</NOTE>, had been long recalled, by their
persidious master<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The Mysorean pursued his predatory operations
without obstruction. He went twice to Pondicherry to confer with
the French;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amuses the English with hopes of peace.</NOTE> and, at the same time, amused the English Presidency
with hopes, rather than offers, of accommodation. Having, at

to pay the debt owing to vanity, by gratifying the demands

and receiving their places, was to provide for their own relations
and friends.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little solicit∣ous about the interests of the Company.</NOTE> This object being obtained, they became little solicit∣ous
about the interests of their constituents. To support the appear∣ance
of authority, some ignorant clerk, who thought insolence a
mark of dignity, penned their dispatches, and assumed the manner
<PB N="161" REF="174"/>
and diction of despotic power; but their orders were only obeyed,
when they suited the views of those, to whom they were addressed.</P>
<P>Unimportant as the condition of the common herd of Directors
might appear to have been at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet their situ∣ation, an ob∣ject of ambi∣tion to their returned ser∣vants,</NOTE> it became an object of ambition
to their servants, when they returned from abroad. The latter, to∣gether
with the spoils having acquired the manners of the East, fre∣quently
took arms against the authority, to which they owed their
power; till by force, by negociation or compromise, they obtained
seats at the Board. The first use they made of their power was to
cover the retreat of their own fortunes from India; and to support,
in some friend, favourite, or partner in plunder, the same system of
venality and corruption, which had enriched themselves. Their local
knowledge being blended with local prejudices, instead of enlight∣ening
the ignorance of other Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">who mislead them,</NOTE> perverted their judgment.
Inflamed by disappointments, but forgetful of favours, they seldom
failed to suggest such measures, as might contribute to distress those,
who had failed to extend their liberality to the utmost limits of their
avarice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and support that system of corruption, which had en∣riched them∣selves.</NOTE> Thus, the injustice and oppression committed by the ser∣vants

of the Directors, were too frequently encouraged by their
approbation. These general observations are not intended, as a ge∣neral
censure; for, in the conduct of the Court, we sometimes meet
with some commendable deviations, from the lines we have above
described and stigmatised.</P>
<P>To return to the affairs of India:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty with Hyder.</NOTE> In the negociation with Hyder
Ali, which terminated in the treaty of the 3d of April 1769, the
Presidency having proposed, that some chiefs, who had assisted the
Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He desires to include the Rajah of Tan¦jore as <HI>his</HI> friend.</NOTE> should be included in the treaty; Hyder demanded the
same advantage, for the Rajah of Tanjore, on <HI>his</HI> part<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 15.</NOTE>. The
Presidency justly conceived, that this demand was made, at the re∣quest
<PB N="162" REF="175"/>
of the Rajah, to preclude any animadversion upon his conduct,
for having furnished Hyder Ali, the enemy of the Carnatic, with
money and provisions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 15.</NOTE>, for carrying on war against his superior,
the Nabob and his protectors the English. The stipulation, in his
favour, proved to a demonstration the Rajah's guilt; and that cir∣cumstance
ought to have induced the Presidency to reject, with re∣sentment,
a proposal, which converted a subject of the Carnatic,
into an ally to its greatest foe. But, it seems, that peace was, at
that moment, such a desirable object, that indignation gave place to
necessity. As Hyder shewed no inclination to desert his ally, the
Presidency proposed to include him in the treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presiden∣cy insist on in∣cluding him, as <HI>their</HI> friend.</NOTE> as <HI>their</HI> friend and
ally; to prevent him, from becoming still more attached to Hyder,
by permitting that chief to become his avowed protector and guaran∣tee<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.
Hyder, whose sole object, in the proposition, seems to have
been a security to the Rajah, from animadversion, acquiesced in
the offers of the Presidency, as still better for his friend, than his
own guarantee.</P>
<P>This proposal on the part of the Presidency “did not proceed
from any opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This proceed∣ed, not from <HI>his</HI> merit.</NOTE> that the Rajah's conduct merited their at∣tention
to his interest<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” They had been no strangers to his
duplicity and treachery during the whole course of the war.
Though,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His faithless conduct.</NOTE> at the requisition of the Presidency in July 1767<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XIII. p. 213.</NOTE>, he had
promised to assist them with a thousand horse and twelve hundred sepoys,
he neither sent that number, nor did those he sent join the
army, till the 19th of February 1768<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 11.</NOTE>. Had he ordered a body of
cavalry to the aid of the English, when they were first required, they
might have been of essential service, “whilst the united forces of
the Nizam and Hyder were acting in the Carnatic<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 12.</NOTE>.” Their ap∣pearance
could not then be obtained. But when the Nizam deserted
<PB N="163" REF="176"/>
Hyder, and evacuated the Carnatic, Tulja-jî sent his cavalry to join
the English, “when their service could be of little use<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 12.</NOTE>.” “This
pretended aid was only given to save appearances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His pretended aid only given to save ap∣pearances.</NOTE> and to furnish,
in case of need, a future plea to both the contending parties; to
the Nabob, that he had <HI>assisted;</HI> to Hyder, that he only <HI>seemed</HI> to
assist<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” His cavalry, soon after they had joined Colonel Wood,
in the Coïmbettour country, “dropped off by parties at a time;”
till, at length, the whole either deserted of themselves, or were re∣called
by their master, long before the conclusion of the war<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The dilatory and suspicious conduct of the Rajah,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His suspicious conduct ani∣madverted upon by the Presidency.</NOTE> his inattention
to the requisition of the government of the Carnatic, which had
<HI>constitutionally</HI> a right to his assistance in war<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>, his acting, upon al∣most
every occasion, contrary to that spirit of mutual friendship,
which had been the oftensible basis of the treaty of 1762, had nei∣ther
escaped the notice, nor had been suffered to pass, without the
animadversion of the Presidency. In their letter of the 8th of Oc∣tober
1767<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">East-India House.</NOTE>, they had signified, to the Court of Directors, their
reasons for being dissatisfied with the conduct of the Rajah of Tan∣jore.
The Court of Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court of Directors of∣fended at his behaviour.</NOTE> happening at the time to be led, by
men of comprehensive ideas and political talents, did not hesitate,
upon a subject, which involved the peace and security of the Carna∣tic.
Conscious, that the treaty of 1762, having only the <HI>quantum</HI>
of the annual peishcuish for its object, did neither infringe nor abo∣lish “the right of the Carnatic to the military service of Tanjore<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Piè's Vindication, p. 12.</NOTE>,”
without insinuating the least doubt on that subject, they delivered
their sentiments to the Council at large, and sent decisive orders to
the Select Committee, on the 17th of March 1769; whilst the war
with Hyder Ali was still depending.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="177"/>
These sentiments and orders explain the delinquency of the Rajah
of Tanjore, at the same time that they define the mode of punishing
him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Send decisive orders to aid the Nabob against the Rajah.</NOTE> for his unjustifiable conduct. “We observe with great dissa∣tisfaction (say the Directors to the Council at large) the conduct of
the Rajah of Tanjore, who forbore so long to join you with his
horse; and when they did join you, they seem to have been of no
manner of use. It is very extraordinary, that when the safety of
the Carnatic was in danger<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When attacked, in September 1767, by
the united forces of the Nizam and Hyder Ali.</NOTE>, he should have acted so dubious or
so pusillanimous a part. When we consider the protection we have
given that Rajah, and the long and uninterrupted tranquillity his
country has enjoyed by it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their well∣founded re∣sentment against him.</NOTE> we cannot but feel the strongest resent∣ment
at his conduct. Our further sentiments on this subject,
and powers of acting therein, are entrusted to the Select Com∣mittee<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Directors to Governor and Council, March
17th, 1769. India-House.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Those powers were accordingly addressed to the Select Committee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tenor of the orders.</NOTE>
in the following words: “It appears most unreasonable to us, that
the Rajah of Tanjore should hold possession of the most fruitful
part of the country, which can alone supply our army with sub∣sistence,
and not contribute to the defence of the Carnatic. We
observe the Nabob makes very earnest representations to you on
this subject, in his letter entered in the book of Country Corre∣spondence;
wherein he takes notice, that the Zemindars of the
Carnatic have been supported and their countries preserved to them
by the operations of our forces, employed in his cause, and that
nothing was more notorious, than that three former princes of
the Carnatic had received from the Tanjore Rajah seventy, eighty,
nay, even one hundred lacks of rupees at a time; that to the pre∣ceding
Nizam he had paid a contribution of fifty lacks; and the
present, if he had met with success against our army, would not
<PB N="165" REF="178"/>
have been content with less than a crore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About a million sterling.</NOTE> of rupees from the Ra∣jah.
How just then does it appear, that he should be made to
bear some part of the expence of those measures, to which he
owes his security and the peace of his country! We, therefore,
enjoin you to give the Nabob such support in his pretensions on
the Rajah of Tanjore, as may be effectual; and if the Rajah re∣fuses
to contribute a just proportion to the expences of the war,
you are then to pursue such measures, as the Nabob may think
consistent with the justice and dignity of his government<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Letter to the Select Committee, March
17th, 1769. India-House.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The sentiments of the East-India Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their purport recapitulated.</NOTE> with regard to the
constitution of Tanjore as well as the conduct of its Rajah, may be
collected, from the above letter and orders. It appears, that, though
the treaty of 1762 had limited the annual tribute to four lacks,
the ancient <HI>constitutional</HI> right of the Carnatic to the military service
of Tanjore, remained unimpaired<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 16.</NOTE> That the Rajah, having long
evaded that service, had at last industriously given it, in a way, which
“had been of no manner of use.” That the Court of Directors
considered Tanjore, as a <HI>part</HI> of the Carnatic, and consequently sub∣ject,
by a certain tenure, to its government. That they judged the
contributions raised, from former Rajahs, proper precedents for the
present Nabob, in the sums he might think just to demand, as a part
of the expences of a war, during which Tanjore had been protected
from the ravages of invaders. That they seemed to allow, that the
Rajah was no more than “a Zemindar of the Carnatic,” depending
on its government, and deriving from it his protection; and that
the Company, as allies to the Nabob, were not only justified, but
even bound “to pursue such measures, as that prince might think
consistent with the justice and dignity of his government,” in pu∣nishing
<PB N="166" REF="179"/>
a vassal, who had, neither with arms nor money, contri∣buted
to the general defence.</P>
<P>The positive orders of the Court of Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why the Presidency suspended the execution of the orders.</NOTE> for calling the
Rajah of Tanjore to account, for his conduct in the war, did not
arrive till autumn 1769, when the season was too far advanced, for
carrying them into effect. But other reasons, besides those, which
arose from the climate, weighed with the Presidency, when they
resolved to suspend the execution of the orders, till a more proper
opportunity should present itself. The ravages of Hyder Ali, the
vigour with which he had carried on the late war, the earnest if not
commanding manner, with which he had insisted, that the Rajah
should be comprehended in the peace, the animosity, which he had
exhibited on every occasion, against the Nabob, rendered it highly
probable, that he would not remain a tame spectator, should an ex∣pedition
against Tanjore take place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXV. p. 939.</NOTE>. Though he was engaged in
disputes with Nizam Ali and the Marattas, he might be induced to
compromise matters, with both those powers, and turn his arms
against the Carnatic, which he had resolved, it was believed, on all
occasions to distress<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. These were the ostensible motives, which
prevented the Presidency from carrying “the commands of their
masters into execution;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They declare that the Rajah deserved chas∣tisement,</NOTE>” for they declared, “that the Rajah cer∣tainly
deserved chastisement; and not only for the supply of mo∣ney
and provisions, with which he had furnished the enemy, in∣stead
of assisting the Nabob and the English, but for since delay∣ing
the payment of the peishcuish,<NOTE PLACE="marg">for delaying the payment of the tribute.</NOTE> settled by the treaty of 1762,
which had become due in the month of July 1769<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” This last
he had done “under the pretence of poverty, and soliciting to have
the whole remitted, in consideration of the expence of the troops
<PB N="167" REF="180"/>
he had sent to the assistance of the English, during the late war;
and which gave the English no assistance<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXV. p. 939.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>They affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasonable∣ness of his contributing to the expence of the war, deduced from various argu∣ments.</NOTE> at the same time, that had no constitutional de∣pendence
in the Rajah, no acknowledged superiority in the Nabob
existed, it was “undoubtedly most reasonable, that Tanjore should
bear a part of the charge of repelling the invaders of the Carna∣tic,
by which it was surrounded on all sides<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 938.</NOTE>. That this prin∣ciple,
even if it had not been established, by any particular
compact, treaty, or agreement, was clear and determinate, as
resulting from equity and the natural rights of governments.
That it was certainly contrary to sound policy in the Carnatic to
suffer the existence of such a state. That, if the Nabob possessed
the whole power of the Carnatic, it would be good policy in
him, and consistent with the principles of the Hindostan govern∣ments,
to reduce Tanjore to the same terms of obedience and
control, to which other Rajahs had been reduced; and that it
would be equally good policy in the Company to do the same,
had they possessed the whole power of the Carnatic<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” That
the impropriety and inconvenience of such a state subsisting, in the
<HI>heart</HI> of the province, had been evident from the Rajah's con∣duct,
in the war with Hyder Ali; and that this conduct might
have furnished the Presidency, with a just plea for calling him to
an account, had not the state of the neighbouring powers rendered
an expedition against his capital, dangerous in the execution and
uncertain in the event<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst the Presidency were arguing thus,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court of Directors en∣raged at the peace with Hyder Ali.</NOTE> at Madras, intelligence
of the peace with Hyder Ali arrived in England. The letters of
the Court of Directors are full of indignation at a treaty, which,
they said, could be only justified by necessity. After accusing the
<PB N="168" REF="181"/>
Presidency of having misrepresented the Nabob, on account of his
disapproving of a peace, in which he is not so much as once
named<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XX. p. 534.</NOTE>, they recapitulated some instances of their unjustifiable
conduct to that prince, during the war. They reprimanded them,
for “having pompously appointed him Phousdar of Mysore;”
and for accusing him, on account of his accepting that nugatory
gift, “of an insatiable desire of extending his dominions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 532.</NOTE>.” They
insinuated, that by following their advice, “he found himself re∣duced,
disappointed, and almost despised,” yet that they “blamed
him for want of temper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” Having repeated some passages in their
several dispatches, they endeavoured to condemn them on their own
evidence. They accused them of irresolution as men, disability as
negociators, weakness and deficiency as politicians. They affirm∣ed,
that though they had rashly dared to rouse the jealousy of the
country powers, they had not discovered, on trying occasions, the
becoming firmness necessary to support the dignity of the English
name; and that by their feeble conduct in war, and their pusilla∣nimity
in submitting to a treaty dictated by an enemy, “they had
laid a foundation for the natives of Hindostan to think they may
insult the Company at pleasure, with impunity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 533.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>Proceeding from this general censure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Full of indig∣nation at the Rajah of Tanjore's being comprehend∣ed in the treaty.</NOTE> they dwelt with particular
severity on the article in the treaty with Hyder, which compre∣hended,
at the recommendation, or rather at the command, of that
chief, the Rajah of Tanjore. “Had you indeed obtained,” say the
Directors, “from the Rajah of Tanjore the horse and assistance
you solicited; had he thereby drawn upon himself the resent∣ment
of the enemy; had it been difficult, on the Rajah's account,
to have appeased Hyder, there might have been some merit, in
procuring the Rajah safe terms. But we do not conceive that
<PB N="169" REF="182"/>
Hyder has discovered so much want of penetration, in his trans∣actions
with you, as to warrant a supposition, that he could
himself be imposed upon by such an artifice; and his <HI>warm at∣tachment</HI>
to the Rajah of Tanjore, manifested by strenuously insist∣ing
he should be included in the treaty, could scarcely be un∣known
to that prince. What their sentiments must be of persons,
whom they had reduced to the necessity of practising arts of this
nature, it is not difficult to determine.—We cannot discern any
advantage gained, by this extraordinary effort of your skill in
negociation, which you make matter of so much merit. The
plain fact is, that the Rajah of Tanjore, who, as tributary to the
Nabob, <HI>ought</HI> to have furnished his quota towards carrying on
the war, which he has <HI>not</HI> done, is still styled by you, a <HI>friend</HI>
to the Carnatic; and by Hyder's adherence to him, for <HI>refusing</HI>
to assist you, he is, as we conceive, effectually sheltered by the
faith of a treaty, from being compellable to contribute a single
rupee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pretend∣ed uspension of the orders of 1769.</NOTE> towards defraying the expence of the war. Our former
orders, therefore, in <HI>this respect,</HI> relative to the Rajah of Tan∣jore
must be <HI>suspended,</HI> because they are, by <HI>your</HI> conduct, ren∣dered
utterly impossible to be carried into execution without com∣mitting
a breach of the treaty you have concluded<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XX. p. 535.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The concluding paragraph of the above quotation has been held
forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That subject discussed.</NOTE> by the advocates of faction and party, as a revocation of the
orders of the 17th of March, 1769, relative to the calling the Ra∣jah
of Tanjore to account, for his conduct in the late war. It ap∣pears,
however, by the subsequent conduct of the Court of Di∣rectors,
that they themselves did not extend the meaning of their
own words to the pitch, to which they have been since wound
up, by hirelings or too busy friends. In the letter of the Presi∣dency
to the Court, dated the 31st of January, 1770, they “point∣edly
<PB N="170" REF="183"/>
declare, that they do not think the treaty with Hyder any
obstacle to the execution of the orders they had received<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">M. Du Piè's Vindication, p. 21.</NOTE>.” That
letter was received in July, just four months after the pretended
revocation had been dispatched to India. Instead of enforcing the
paragraph, as revoking their orders of the 17th of March 1769,
“the Directors never thought proper to take notice of the subject
directly or indirectly.” The Presidency, therefore, had every
reason to consider the paragraph, which is now set up as a revoca∣tion
of the orders of 1769, as the strongest confirmation and en∣forcement
of those orders<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The Court, instead of doubting of the
propriety of their own orders, express much displeasure and disap∣pointment,
at the article of the treaty with Hyder, which, as they
conceived, opposed the execution of those orders. The truth is,
the part of the paragraph, which factious writers construe into a
revocation, appears to have been merely an effusion of passion, from
minds chagrined, irritated and enraged, at the manner and terms
of the treaty with Hyder Ali. But this is not the place for finally
discussing a subject, which must be resumed in the order of time.</P>
<P>The unsuccessful war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Supervisors appointed to regulate the affairs of In∣dia.</NOTE> which had raged, for some time, on the
coast of Coromandel, together with mismanagements in all parts of
India, had not only roused the attention of the Court of Directors,
but turned the eyes of government towards the East. In autumn,
1769, the Directors having appointed three commissioners, to examine
and superintend the affairs of the Company, in all the Presidencies,
applied to Government, for a squadron of men of war, “to give coun∣tenance
to their affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XX. p. 531.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir John Lind∣say commands a squadron to the East.</NOTE> The commander of this squadrom was
Sir John Lindsay, an officer of distinguished merit in his profes∣sion;
who received also a commission from the Company, as their
plenipotentiary to all powers, upon or near the gulph of Persia; at
the same time, appointing him “commander in chief of all their
<PB N="171" REF="184"/>
ships, frigates, and armed vessels, in and through all parts of
India<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's App. No. XVII. p. 241.</NOTE>.” The commissioners, appointed for superintending and
managing affairs, throughout India, were Messieurs Vansittart,
Scrafton, and Forde, men of character and experience, whose me∣lancholy
fate is still recent in every one's mind.</P>
<P>Sir John Lindsay was invested with still higher powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is ap∣pointed his Majesty's plenipoten∣tiary to In∣dian princes; but particu∣larly to the Nabob.</NOTE> than those
conferred by the Company. He was appointed by a commission
under the great seal, his Majesty's Minister, with plenipotentiary
powers, to Indian princes in general; but more particularly to the
Nabob of Arcot, who had become an ally of the crown of Great Bri∣tain,
by the eleventh article of the treaty of Paris. The managers of
the affairs of the Company at home, as well as their servants abroad,
had industriously concealed, from that prince, the nature and im∣port
of that article for several years. The success, with which this
secret was preserved, furnishes an irrefragable proof, that every in∣dividual
thought it his own interest, to keep the Nabob in a state
of ignorance of his rights. Though that prince had obtained, at
length, some knowledge of the nature of the guarantee, which se∣cured
to him the possession of the Carnatic, he had found it almost
impossible to avail himself of that knowledge. The authors of his
grievances were the only channels, through which he could convey
his complaints; and self-preservation effectually prevented them,
from becoming their own accusers. In the beginning of 1769,
some account of his sufferings had been conveyed to the throne;
and, before the end of the year, Sir John Lindsay, as plenipoten∣tiary
from his Majesty, was on his voyage to India.</P>
<P>On the 26th of July 1770,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He arrives at Madras.</NOTE> Sir John, after having remained
some months at Bombay, arrived at Fort St. George<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sir J. Lindsay to Lord Weymouth, Oct. 13, 1770.</NOTE>. Having
laid his commission before the Nabob, he opened to that prince
the object of his embassy and the nature of his instructions. He
<PB N="172" REF="185"/>
assured him, that it was his Majesty's firm design to adhere to all
the promises made by his late royal grandfather,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His assurances in the name of his Majesty to the Nabob.</NOTE> in his letter
of the 21st of February 1760<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Counter-signed by Mr. Secretary Pitt.</NOTE>. That it was his Majesty's per∣manent
resolution, like that of the late king, to continue firm to
all his allies, in every part of the world. That the king was
determined to support those engagements, into which he had en∣tered,
by the treaty of Paris, with other European powers, to se∣cure
the Carnatic to the Nabob and his posterity. That should it
appear, upon examination, that the distressed situation of the affairs
of that country, had proceeded from the intrigues of any of his
Majesty's trading subjects, the Nabob might depend on the royal
protection and friendly assistance; when the real state of the hard∣ships,
under which he laboured, should be laid at the foot of
the throne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He demands, in the king's name, an ac∣count of the Nabob's grievances.</NOTE> That to enable his Majesty to vindicate his justice
and good faith to the whole world, he had laid his commands on
the plenipotentiary, to demand in his Majesty's name, a full and
succinct account of the Nabob's transactions with the Company,
since the treaty of Paris; that, upon a full information of all
affairs, his Majesty might have it in his power, not only to re∣dress
past evils, but to prevent future oppressions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay to the Secretary of State, Oct. 13, 1770.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In answer to these assurances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob's grateful an∣swer.</NOTE> the Nabob expressed himself, in
terms full of gratitude, for such distinguished marks of his Majesty's
friendship, and the repeated assurances of the royal protection to
him and family. He assured the plenipotentiary, that he could
find no words to express the deep sense he had of his Majesty's
goodness, in so seasonably interposing in his behalf, and offering his
royal assistance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">But is <HI>afraid</HI> to avail him∣self of the protection of the Crown.</NOTE> when he most stood in need of support<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But not∣withstanding
those expressions of gratitude, he was still afraid to
avail himself of the protection of the Crown against men, who
might continue to possess that power, under the rigour of which
<PB N="173" REF="186"/>
he had already so much suffered. To improve his fears, various
reports were industriously propagated. Some insinuated a want of
powers in the plenipotentiary; others the insufficiency of those
powers, had they really existed, in opposition to the charter of the
Company. Jealousy, disappointment and resentment arose, at
once, in arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His reasons.</NOTE> The Nabob, knowing the fate of other princes,
who had fallen victims to the displeasure of the Company, began
to dread, that resentment might induce them to deprive him of his
country, as their servants had threatened, two years before<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay to Mr. Wood, Oct. 13,
1770.</NOTE>. The
example of the Nabobs of Bengal was constantly present to his
eyes, with all its melancholy circumstances<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay to Lord Weymouth,
Oct, 13, 1770.</NOTE>; and he shuddered at
giving offence to a body of men, whose insolence, tyranny, rigour
and injustice he had so frequently experienced. Disappointed ambi∣tion,
and a still more hardened and vindictive passion, disappoint∣ed
avarice, were likely to lie in wait, for a proper time, to satiate
themselves, with the utmost exertions of revenge. The support
offered was at a great distance and in itself uncertain; but the ene∣my
was near and sure of seizing every opportunity, to wreck their
resentment upon an unfortunate man, who presumed to appeal
for protection, from the dictates of insolence and the demands
of rapacity.</P>
<P>The event shewed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The event shewed his fears were just.</NOTE> that the Nabob's fears were better founded
than the hopes of support presented by the plenipotentiary. In a
government, subject to frequent changes of men and consequently
liable to fluctuations in opinions, promises of protection are, at best,
but unintentional deceptions, which may lead the credulous into
ruin. This observation has actually been verified, in the person of
Mahommed Ali, Nabob of the Carnatic. The oppressions of the
Company, the imperious rapacity of its servants, had forced him to
throw himself under the protection of the state. The state, in
<PB N="174" REF="187"/>
the most solemn manner, promised its protection; and, in the
person of an ambassador, vested by the seal of Great Bri∣tain
with every legal power to pledge the public faith, as∣sured
the Nabob, that it was only necessary for him to specify
his grievances to have them redressed. He accordingly specified
his grievances; but, after having been amused during three years,
with the vain parade of an embassy, he found himself, in a much
worse condition than before. The royal commission was recalled,
without having accomplished the least article of the avowed ob∣ject,
for which it had been granted. The plighted faith of the
Crown was broken; the credit due to the great seal of one of
the first states in the world was destroyed, at the requisition of a
body, who had tarnished the honour of a free nation, by in∣numerable
acts of tyranny and oppression. To this source may
be traced all the late misfortunes of the Nabob of the Carnatic.
Government, instead of fulfilling engagements, which every state
holds sacred, remanded back the wretched fugitive to the fetters,
from which he had attempted to escape. The Company enraged
at the PRESUMPTION of his defection, have added revenge to those
sordid and unjustifiable passions, from which he had already suf∣fered
so much; and with a peculiar refinement on cruelty, whilst
they divest him of his rights, they deprive him of his reputation,
the last comfort of the unfortunate.</P>
<P>The Nabob had sufficient discernment to foresee a part of those
misfortunes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His scruples at length overcome,</NOTE> which have since fallen on himself and his family, on
account of his having appealed, from the oppressions of the Com∣pany,
to the justice of the Crown. He, therefore, expressed the
greatest anxiety about his own perilous situation, when the plenipo∣tentiary
demanded a faithful account of his grievances. But, upon
the plenipotentiary's “promising, in his Majesty's name, that should
it become necessary for his protection, and the security of his fa∣mily,
<PB N="175" REF="188"/>
he would enter into a solemn treaty with him, as soon as he
should make the necessity of such a measure evident<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir John Lindsay to Lord Weymouth,
Oct. 13th, 1770.</NOTE>,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">by the pleni∣potentiary's pledging the faith of the crown, in the most solemn manner.</NOTE> the Nabob
gave a full detail of his transactions with the servants of the Com∣pany,
from the year 1760, when he was dignified with the title of an
ally by the late king. He justly considered, that his being acknow∣ledged
the ally of that monarch, had entitled him to the royal pro∣tection
against the injustice of the subjects of Great-Britain, as well
as against the force of foreign Europeans. This protection had been
pledged in the most solemn manner; but the Nabob's neglecting to
secure himself, by the treaty offered by the plenipotentiary, frus∣trated,
in the event, his hopes of redress.</P>
<P>Though the servants of the Company on the Coast had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Court of Directors, for the time, fa∣vour the Na∣bob.</NOTE> almost
uniformly, during the wars with the Nizam and Hyder Ali, treated
the Nabob with contempt and injustice, the Court of Directors seem
to have respected his rights, in the year 1769. In their instructions
to the three commissioners, dated the 15th of September 1769,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their instruc∣tions concern∣ing him to the supervisors.</NOTE> they
enjoined them “to provide effectually for the honour and security of
their FAITHFUL ally, Mahommed Ali, Nabob of Arcot.” They
blamed the Presidency, for their injustice to that prince; and stigma∣tized
their conduct, as a most “flagrant breach of their repeated or∣ders.”
They declared their sorrow to find, that the imprudent
and impolitic schemes of the Presidency had eventually increased the
debts of the Nabob, and accumulated his distress. “When we re∣flect
(continued the Court of Directors) on the long experience we
have had of Mahommed Ali's faithful attachment to the English
Company, we are surprised at the idea entertained by the Governor
and Council, in their letters of the 8th March and 27th June
1768, to reduce him to a <HI>mere nominal Nabob</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To complete the whole, as the Com∣pany's servants found the expence of the war with Hyder increasing, and as the appear∣ance of troubles in Bengal forbade them to hope for assistance from that quarter, as they probably had then a prospect of making peace with Hyder, or little hopes of conquering his country, they resolved to take the Car∣natic into their own hands, as the only means of paying the expence of the war, which they had undertaken contrary to the advice of the prince of the country; to leave the Nabob, though included in the treaty of Pa∣ris, and an acknowledged ally by their so∣vereign,” a name only, “without a country.

the treaty of Paris, by which treaty PUBLIC FAITH became the

in, and dependent on, such title, should be by us countenanced

<P>The pretensions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah's pre∣tensions.</NOTE> by which the Rajah justified his hostilities, against
the Marawar, were founded upon prior transactions, which require
to be explained. In the year 1716, some disputes arising between
the Rajah of Tanjore and the Marawar, the former invaded the ter∣ritories
of the latter; who, though he was assisted by his superior,
the Rajah of Tritchinopoly, was defeated, and lost a part of his
country to the victor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXII. p. 680.</NOTE>. Sadatulla Chan, then Nabob of the Car∣natic,
being the lawful superior of both the contending parties,
having interfered, transferred their disputes into his Divan, who
settled them under certain restrictions, with regard to the countries
seized by the Rajah of Tanjore<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 681.</NOTE>. Upon the death of the Marawar,
in the year 1725, his successor was displaced, by a relation, aided
by the arms of Tanjore. Another pretender arising was assisted, in
the same manner, by the Tanjorines; but, after he got possession of
the government, he proved ungrateful to his benefactors, and having
defeated them, in the field, expelled them from the countries, which
they had seized in 1716<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. In the time of Pretaupa Sing, his gene∣ral,

himself of those territories, in the year 1764, when the Na∣bob

they added their fears from foreign powers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Irresolute conduct of the Presi∣dency.</NOTE> especially from the Ma∣rattas<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.
Mistaking the insolence of Tulja-jî for a confidence de∣rived
from the certainty of aid, from the neighbouring states, they
became irresolute and indecisive in their councils; if a judgment
may be formed from the perusal of their minutes. But there is rea∣son

<P>Tossed between the expediency and even necessity of bringing

animosity against the Nabob, the Presidency became irresolute, in∣decisive, and fluctuating in their councils. On the one side, a
sense of duty and an attention to the public safety erected a bul∣wark
of facts and arguments, to support their resolution; on the
<PB N="184" REF="197"/>
other, animosity and excessive caution stept in and levelled all again.
In deliberating on the subject, they brought before them such of
the Company's orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They delibe∣rate on the subject of Tanjore,</NOTE> as seemed to affect what they called “their
present critical situation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 659.</NOTE>.” The Court of Directors, in their letter
of the 27th of June, 1770, had strictly forbidden them “to become
parties in any disputes between the powers of India<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.”—But the
Rajah of Tanjore was <HI>not</HI> an independent power, but a feudatory,
a vassal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and different orders of the Court of Di∣rectors.</NOTE> who had failed in his duty to the Carnatic, of the peace
of which, the Presidency were the guardians. The Court of Di∣rectors
had declared, in their letter of the 23d of March, in the
same year, “that they were bound by the treaty of Paris to ac∣knowledge,
and strongly urged by honour and interest to sup∣port
Mahommed Ali as Nabob of the Carnatic. Yet they strictly
forbid their servants, even in support of their ally, to invade the
dominions of those, who desire the friendship of the Company, and
do not forfeit it, by becoming themselves the AGGRESSORS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 660.</NOTE>.”
But the Rajah of Tanjore had not only leagued with their enemies,
but had become “the aggressor,” by kindling a war in the heart of
the Carnatic, the peace and tranquillity of which they had been or∣dered
to defend and vindicate<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 662.</NOTE>. The Court of Directors had, in
their letter of the 17th of March, 1769, given strict orders for
bringing the Rajah to account, as a vassal of the Carnatic, for his
conduct during the Mysore war; yet in their letter of the 23d
March, 1770, in a fit of passion with their servants, on account of
the treaty with Hyder Ali, they seem to <HI>suspend</HI> the execution of their
orders relative to Tanjore. But the Presidency were of opinion,
that the article of the treaty, which included the Rajah, was so far
from securing him, from being brought to account, for any breach
on the constitutional rights of his superior, that it could not be con∣strued
<PB N="185" REF="198"/>
to defend him against animadversion, for his unjustifiable be∣haviour
during the war<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, p. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Without having recourse to the orders of the Court of Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion of the Rajah's un∣justifiable conduct.</NOTE>
which, however positive, as they were made for general purposes,

the expediency of the measure, founded upon the constitutional
rights of the Nabob and the Rajah. It appears that the Rajah's
conduct was not only unjustifiable, but deserved immediate chas∣tisement,
“because, being himself a tributary of the Carnatic, his
taking up arms against its dependents, was an act of hostility
against the government to which he was a vassal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">President to the Nabob, Feb. 20, 1771.

Nabob of the Carnatic<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXI.</NOTE>. That, as his lighting the flames of war,

That,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His intrigues with Euro∣pean as well as Indian powers.</NOTE> besides his intrigues with the powers of India, he had not

had sent a large sum of money to the French, a thing much in

observed, “that things were now come to such a pass, between the

which the former had gone<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>,” that he really believed Tanjore
would join any enemy of the Carnatic.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His reasons.</NOTE> That the reduction of a
force so hostile was essential to the safety of the Nabob and to
the interests of the Company. That an expedition of the na∣ture
of that proposed must ever be attended with risk, and
might be productive of an invasion by the Marattas; but that their
coming, at that time of the year, would be attended with less loss
and danger, than in the season, in which the Nabob had been so
eager for the expedition. That, as to the French, it was indeed
most probable, they would join the Rajah, as soon as they were in
any condition for that purpose; but, that this circumstance, instead
of being an objection to the expedition, was the most urgent mo∣tive
to the undertaking it, before they had acquired the power of
giving effectual aid to the enemy. That, as to Hyder, there was
little to be apprehended from that chief, considering the present
untoward state of his own affairs<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="202"/>
To these reasons, the Nabob replied, “that he was under the or∣der”
of the Presidency. But the committee, who had waited upon
him, on the occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob agrees to the mea∣sure.</NOTE> thinking that he wished to shelter the measure,
under that expression, declared that every thing depended, on the
resolution he himself should form. Doubting no longer the sincerity
of their intentions, he begged leave to ask three questions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">His three rea∣sons.</NOTE> Whether
the object of the expedition was merely to chastise the Rajah? The
recovery of a sum of money, for his contumacy? Or the absolute
conquest of the country? The committee answered, That could the
Rajah be brought to the payment of a large sum of money, and to
submit to such regulations, as might remove all future apprehensions,
it were better than to proceed to absolute conquest. But that, as it
was doubtful, whether the Rajah could be brought to secure terms,
without coming to that extremity, it was necessary to adapt the pre∣parations
for the expedition to that ultimate object. The result was,
that the Nabob became, for the time, reconciled to the proposals of
the committee, upon their assuring him, that whatever sums of mo∣ney
might be taken from the Rajah, should be applied to the discharge
of his debts to private creditors, after deducting from those sums,
the expences of the expedition<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 687</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He recurs to his former ob∣jections.</NOTE> But after this acquiescence of the
Nabob, he recurred, in the beginning of July, to his former objec∣tions.
These, however, were again over-ruled, by the eagerness of
the Presidency for an expedition, which the insolent conduct and
dangerous intrigues of the Rajah had, now, rendered absolutely ne∣cessary<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 690.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this second acquiescence to the inclinations of the
Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He prefers negociation to force;</NOTE> the Nabob's aversion to a military expedition recurred.
Preferring negociation, to a recourse to war, it appears, that he pro∣posed
to bring about an accommodation, by the means of the Maratta
vackeel<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 693.</NOTE>. In a conference with the President, on the 22d of July,
<PB N="190" REF="203"/>
he insinuated his aversion to hostile measures, stated difficulties, and
hinted the expediency of remaining quiet at present, and deferring
the expedition to another time<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 694, 695.</NOTE>. In another conference, on the
23d<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 695, 696.</NOTE>, “he expressed his disinclination to an immediate expedition,
chusing rather an accommodation with the Rajah, to be negociated
by himself, without their interposition; but desiring, neverthe∣less,
their support to the measure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 726.</NOTE>.” It appears, that the Select
Committee, taking the whole seriously to their consideration, had
come to a resolution to leave the negociation to the Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">which is left in his hands.</NOTE> and to
give him every support<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 718, 719.</NOTE>. “By the minutes of the 29th of July it
also appears, that the Nabob had opened his demands to the Tan∣jore
vackeel; but that the vackeel declared, he had no powers to
accommodate the matter; that finding the negociations at Madras
might be attended with ruinous delays,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presidency promise to support him.</NOTE> he had proposed to send his
eldest son to Tritchinopoly, requesting the Presidency to support
him, with the appearance of resolution, to compel the Rajah, if
necessary, by military force<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 716.</NOTE>.” On the other hand, the Rajah,
meaning nothing less than a reasonable accommodation, “used de∣lays,
procrastinations, and evasions, in order to waste the time,
till the setting in of the rains, and the rising of the Monsoon,
should deprive the Nabob and English of the power of military
compulsion, for the season<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 718, 720.</NOTE>”</P>
<P>The designs of the Rajah appeared so evident to the Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders issued to the army.</NOTE>
that they perceived no probability of his submitting to safe and ho∣nourable
terms, without military compulsion<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 728.</NOTE>. Orders were, there∣fore,
issued to General Smith, on the 30th of July, to prepare the
army assembled at Tritchinopoly, for taking the field. These orders
mentioned, “that the Nabob had determined to accept terms from
<PB N="191" REF="204"/>
the Rajah;” but the Presidency, at the same time, declared that
it was highly probable, the Rajah would never comply with such
terms, as should be deemed safe, honourable and sufficient, unless
compelled by force of arms<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 722.</NOTE>.” Under the supposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eventual ar∣rangements, in case of war.</NOTE> that
matters might proceed to an absolute conquest of Tanjore, they made
prior arrangements for that event. Upon the requisition of the Na∣bob,
they agreed to place the country and capital in his hands; in
the same manner, as the Company had done, on former occasions,
with respect to the forts and territories of other Zemindars, who had
been reduced, on account of actual rebellion against the government
of the Carnatic, or for withholding the customary tribute<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 727.</NOTE>. In return, the Nabob promised to pay to the Company a free gift of
ten lacks of pagodas<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">400,000l.</NOTE>, with a donation to the troops, in compensa∣tion
for the plunder, should the place be taken by storm. But he
refused to receive a garrison of the Company's troops, as a matter
of <HI>right,</HI> into the fort; though he declared, “that whenever there
should be occasion, he should desire and solicit the Presidency to
garrison the place<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 727.</NOTE>, in the same manner as Tritchinopoly and Ve∣lore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In addition to the facts and arguments, in the preceding pages, it is thought proper to throw into a note the SUBSTANCE of Mr. Du Prè's Vindication of the Expedition of 1771. Though that gentleman's reasonings are not so forcibly expressed, in the following abstract, as in his own work, some advantage may be de∣rived from their being compendiously collected into one point of view. Whoever will be at the trouble of reading the ENORMOUS volumes published by the Court of Directors, in their own desence, will readily allow, that Mr. Du Prè is, at least, an IMPARTIAL authority, in whatever regards the interests of the Nabob of Arcot. <HI>Substance of Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The motives to the expedition of 1771 were partly in obedience to particular orders; partly to fulfil the guarantee of the treaty of 1762; but chiefly from just apprechensions that the ge∣neral peace of the Carnatic, and even the im∣mediate possessions of the Nabob and Company would be endangered, should not the power of the Rajah of Tanjore be checked.</P>
<P>The temporizing and deceitful conduct of the Rajah, in the Mysore war, had excited the resentment of the Court of Directors. This they express in very pointed terms, in their letters to Madras, of the 17th of March 1769. In the 7th paragraph of <HI>that</HI> to the Select Committee, after animadverting severely on the conduct of the Rajah, for not contributing to the defence of the Carnatic, which he ought to have done as a tributary, they enjoin them to give the Nabob such support in his pretensions on the Rajah, as he might think consistent with the justice and dignity of his govern∣ment.</P>
<P>These orders were <HI>positive.</HI> But before the Committee had taken any measures in conse∣quence of them, they had the mortification to find that the indignation of the Court of Direc∣tors, so lately expressed against the Rajah of Tanjore, was transferred to themselves. In the treaty with Hyder Ali, at the close of the Mysore war, the President and Council of Ma∣dras had, for political reasons, included the Ra∣jah, on the part of the Carnatic, though his conduct deserved no attention to his interest. From their mistaking the nature and extent of this transaction, it was condemned by the Court of Directors, in terms full of acrimony and re∣proach. In their letter to the President and Council, of March 23, 1770, after some sar∣castic observations on the skill of their servants in negotiation, they say, that the King of Tan∣jore, who, as tributary to the Nabob, ought to have furnished his quota towards carrying on the war, is effectually sheltered by the faith of a treaty from being compellable to contribute a single rupee; and that, therefore, their former orders, relative to the King of Tanjore, were necessarily suspended, as being rendered utterly impossible to be carried into execution.</P>
<P>The chagrin rather than the conviction of the Directors, relative to the consequences of the treaty with Hyder, is evident. The Presidency, in their own vindication, wrote their sentiments very fully in their letter of January 31, 1770. They explained the motives of the war and peace with Hyder, and declared it as their opi∣nion, that the stipulation with respect to the Rajah could neither be an obstacle to the exe∣cution of the orders of the 17th of March 1769, nor shelter him from any constitutional claims of the Nabob for military service or otherwise.</P>
<P>The same sentiments were repeated at differ∣ent times. If, therefore, the Court thought them inadmissible, they ought to have signified their disapprobation, and thereby have prevent∣ed the execution of orders which appeared to them inconsistent with the treaty. So far from that, however, they took no further notice of the matter. The Presidency, therefore, thought themselves warranted, from the silence of the Company, to consider the orders of 1769 as still standing in force, whenever the situation of affairs should demand their execution. They accordingly mentioned them in their dispatches of the 20th of July 1771, as one reason, among others, for calling the Rajah to account. Those dispatches were received in England in January 1772; and the Court of Directors ap∣proved of the conduct of their servants to that period.</P>
<P>From these circumstances, it is submitted, whether the Presidency had not reason to un∣derstand the silence of the Court of Directors as an acquiescence in their explanations on that subject; and whether they judged amiss in con∣sidering the angry paragraph, which is now set up as a revocation of the orders of 1769, to be rather a motive for their enforcement. The Court signify much displeasure with their ser∣vants for a certain article in their treaty with Hyder; but what they say is evidently more expressive of their <HI>fears</HI> left that article should prove an obstacle to the execution of their for∣mer orders, than of a <HI>wish</HI> that those orders should be suspended. Were one permitted to hazard a conjecture, it might be supposed that there was not an intention to <HI>suspend,</HI> much less to <HI>revoke,</HI> those orders, until the <HI>new</HI> arrange∣ments for restoring the Rajah in 1775 render∣ed a disapprobation of <HI>old</HI> measures necessary.</P>
<P>With what colour of justice, therefore, can the Court of Directors pass so severe a censure upon their servants as to tell them that, in the expedition of 1771, they had departed from the letter and spirit of the Company's orders? If the duplicity of the Rajah's conduct in the My∣sore war appeared to the Company in such a light, as to warrant the decisive orders which they had given to their servants in 1769; how much more forcibly did both the <HI>letter</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of those orders speak, when the Rajah not only refused to pay to the Nabob the ar∣rears of a tribute stipulated by the treaty of 1762, and for the performance of which the Company had made themselves the guarantees; but when, at the same time, in defiance of all remonstrances, and in direct violation of the treaty with Hyder, he became an aggressor, and took up arms against the dependents of the Car∣natic!</P>
<P>Had the treaty with Hyder stipulated any thing in favour of the Rajah which could even be <HI>supposed</HI> to impede the execution of the or∣ders of 1769, his following conduct plainly re∣moved the obstacle. By a breach of the treaty, he forfeited all right to its benefits; and conse∣quently the orders, instead of being any longer <HI>doubtful,</HI> became instantly clear and decisive, and resumed the same force and vigour as if no such treaty had ever existed.</P>
<P>But the Presidency have no need to appeal to <HI>suppositions,</HI> and the deductions arising from them, in their own vindication. They can plead the express declaration of the Company themselves for the justice of their proceedings. The Directors, in their letter to the Nabob of March 25, 1772, acknowledge, that the rash∣ness of the Rajah in taking up arms against the Marawar and Nalcooty would, at all events, have urged them to unsheath the sword in or∣der to chastife him, had the Nabob ensured the necessary resources. When, therefore, the Nabob did <HI>ensure</HI> the necessary resources, the expedition had their sanction.</P>
<P>Such was their own sense in 1772, of the principle upon which their servants had pro∣ceeded in 1771. They avow the spirit of the orders of 1769 in its fullest extent. Whatever, therefore, may be now alleged to invalidate those orders, it is evident that a different mode of construction was not adopted till after that period. But the expedition of 1773 made a very material change in the state of the Carna∣tic. That change of circumstances seems to have suggested a change of measures; and, to justify the <HI>new</HI> system, it became necessary to condemn the old.</P>
<P>Enough, it is hoped, has been now produced, both from the records of the Company and their servants, to convince the impartial public that the expedition of 1771 was strictly conformable to the orders of 1769. But there were other motives, besides an obedience to those orders, which rendered that measure not only expedient but even necessary.</P>
<P>The Rajah of Tanjore refused to pay the tribute stipulated by the treaty of 1762, for which the Company were responsible; he would not contribute his quota towards the charges of the Mysore war; he had rebelliously invaded the rights of other subjects of the Car∣natic, by force of arms; and there were the strongest reasons to suspect, that he had been in negociation with the Marattas, Hyder, the Dutch, Danes, and French. From all these circumstances collected together, the servants of the Company thought they saw sufficient cause, not only to be upon their guard, but even to make use of compulsive measures, should the refractory conduct of the Rajah continue to render them necessary.</P>
<P>They proceeded, however, with deliberation. Being averse to a decision by arms, if it possibly could be avoided, they first had recourse to le∣nient methods. They remonstrated to him on the impropriety of his behaviour, and repre∣sented the consequences to which it must ex∣pose him. They promised him the protection of the Company, as soon as he shewed that he deserved it; but assured him, at the same time, that a regular payment of the peishcuish, and a strict compliance, in all other respects, with the treaty of 1762, were the only conditions on which he could either hope to obtain their friendship, or even escape their resentment. But nothing would do. Persuasion and threats were equally employed in vain. The Rajah was not to be moved by the one, nor intimidated by the other. The former he treated either with contempt or neglect, and he seemed to set the latter at defiance; for he sometimes carried the insolence of his answers so far as to exceed all bounds of forbearance.</P>
<P>Had the Rajah discovered any symptoms of a conciliatory disposition, there might have been hopes of an amicable accommodation. But his obstinate and contemptuous behaviour, not only precluded every expectation of that kind, but naturally gave just alarm. It seemed clearly to point out, that he had a dependence on foreign connections; as it was not to be supposed that he could rely on his own force alone against the united power of the Nabob and the Company. In such a situation, what were the servants of the Company to do? The safety of the Carnatic was in imminent danger. The Nabob solicited the assistance of the Com∣pany, both as their own ally and as the ally of the Crown. The Company were bound to protect his government and rights; and the security of their own possessions added weight to that obligation. As, therefore, no hopes of an accommodation were left, there remained no other alternative, but to reduce the power of the Rajah to such a degree as to be no longer dangerous.</P>
<P>Compelled by these considerations, the Com∣mittee, at length, yielded to the Nabob's soli∣citations. He agreed to bear the expences of the war; and they, as auxiliaries, gave him the assistance of the Company's troops, to support the demands of his eldest son, who was sent to Tritchinopoly, with powers to propose terms to the Rajah. He remained obstinate. His ca∣pital was besieged; but, when the breach be∣came almost practicable, he submitted to the Nabob's propositions, and the army returned to Tritchinopoly.</P>
<P>It was easy to foresee, however, that this compromise would not be of long duration; at least, on the part of the Rajah. Accordingly, fresh differences soon arising between the Na∣bob and him, a second expedition was under∣taken against him in 1773, which ended in the total reduction of his country. In the letter of the Court of Directors of the 12th of April 1775, both expeditions have been much censured, though the first was once ap∣proved. But, as the same principal servants were not in office at Fort St. George, at those different periods, it is only to vindicate the ex∣pedition of 1771 that the present observations are submitted to the public. Those gentle∣men, who are chargeable for the succeeding measures, can, no doubt, if necessary, sufficiently answer for themselves.</P>
<P>It is therefore to be hoped, that enough has been said to vindicate the government of Fort St. George, on that occasion. But, should any thing further be wanting, to satisfy the mind of the reader, it is supplied by the Court of Di∣rectors themselves, in their minute of the 18th of August 1773; wherein their Chairman, in their name, complimented the Governor on his return to England, in very high terms of ap∣probation, for his wife and upright manage∣ment of their affairs; for his good conduct to∣wards their ally the Subah of the Carnatic; and, in particular, for his invariable regard to their orders in all cases.</P></NOTE>.”</P>

Men, who neither understood the constitution of the Carnatic, nor
the peculiar situation of the Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole ar∣gument stat∣ed, relative to the preten∣sions of the Company to the disposal of Tanjore.</NOTE> have stigmatised these terms
<PB N="193" REF="206"/>
with the name of concessions, and, as such, have ascribed them to
private and selfish motives. These ought to have considered, that as
<PB N="194" REF="207"/>
the dispute related only to the feudal rights of the Carnatic over
a dependent on its government, the risque and expence of the war
were to fall on the Nabob; and that, therefore, by the law of
nations, he was entitled to the reward of victory. That the
Company could only appear, as allies in his cause, either as gua∣rantees
of the treaty of 1762, or as guardians of the peace of the
Carnatic, a character, which they had uniformly assumed, ever since
<PB N="195" REF="208"/>
the French power had been annihilated on the coast. That, as allies,
auxiliaries, or mercenaries, they could acquire no inherent right to any
territory, they might over-run, to no fortress, they might seize. That
the keeping possession of Tanjore, which is a part of the Carnatic,
would have been a direct breach of the treaty of Paris, by which
Mahommed Ali is guaranteed in the entire and exclusive possession
of that country. That should it be granted, a concession which we
are, by no means, inclined to make, that Tanjore was <HI>not</HI> a part of
the Carnatic, yet, if conquered in a regular and solemn war, it must
have become such, as that war was the war of the Nabob, not the war
of his auxiliaries and mercenaries, the Company. That, as the Com∣pany
neither were nor could be principals in hostilities, which might
terminate in the capture of Tanjore, their taking possession of that
place for themselves, or for any other than the Nabob, who was the
principal, would have been an act of private injustice, if not robbery,
punishable by the common law of the state, of which they are the
subjects. That, granting they may have had a right, in some cases, to
become principals in war in the Carnatic, they had evidently no such
right, in the present dispute; for though the Rajah had broken the
treaty of 1762, by his refusing to pay, for the last two years, the stipu∣lated
peishcuish, that treaty was not <HI>their</HI> treaty, and they had no right
to enforce its terms, but upon the express requisition of the Nabob.
That this requisition could only place the Company, in the light of
allies; and that, as allies, they had no claim to the disposal of any
conquests, made in the war, either by the law of nature or nations.</P>

doubtful, whether this vulgar minister exhibited most insolence or

the English,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">He threatens to <HI>thresh</HI> the English.</NOTE> so that they will long remember” the correction of
this hand. “I will order my Sepoys to fire, from the great smoke
of which the English<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> will not be able to see any thing; then I
will fall upon them with <HI>my</HI> horse; the dust kicked up by their

is dispersed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” “This is an excellent scheme (Seid Muckdoom
replied), and certainly the true way of threshing the English<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.”
The Barawar-minister, still continuing his <HI>apt</HI> allusions, said, “the
way to catch birds is to put a piece of wax on their heads, when
the sun is perpendicular; which melting the wax, the same will
run into the eyes of the birds, and then they may be taken<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.

<P>This wise and modest minister having finished his conference with
Seid Muckdoom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah's inso∣lence to the English.</NOTE> that officer was sent for by the Rajah; who ab∣ruptly
asked him, why he had come to Tanjore? “I have brought
(said Seid Muckdoom) letters from the English governor, the
English general, and the eldest son of the Nabob.” “What have
<PB N="197" REF="210"/>
I to do (replied the Rajah) with the governor? I do not desire <HI>him</HI>
to guarantee<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè, who was governor of Ma∣dras
in 1771, had settled the treaty of 1762.</NOTE> the treaty now<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXIV. p. 865.</NOTE>.” But when he saw the letter
from the Nabob's son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771.</NOTE> he flew into a violent passion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He desires not their guaran∣tee.</NOTE> and expressed
himself in terms, with respect to the Nabob, which seemed so inde∣cent,
that they could not be repeated by Seid Muckdoom. The Ra∣jah's
answer in writing is marked, with the insolence and folly of
his character.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His counter∣demands on the Nabob.</NOTE> He insisted that the Nabob, instead of receiving the
arrears of tribute, and satisfaction, for the Rajah's own rebellion and
injustice, “should defray the expences of <HI>his</HI> troops; and, in short, in
opposition to each demand, he set up a like demand of his own<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.”
He concludes his letter, with saying: “I, on my part, sent my
demands in writing, which, I hope, you will take into considera∣tion.
I am ready to undertake the same business” (that of war)
which you come upon at present<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 866.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>All hopes of negociation being at an end,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Army marches.</NOTE> General Smith marched,
with the army, from Tritchinopoly, about the middle of September.

by the enemy, on the 20th of the month<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 868.</NOTE>. On the 23d, the army
encamped before Tanjore<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXII. p. 788.</NOTE>; but the batteries against the place were
not opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">French and Dutch assist the Rajah.</NOTE> till the beginning of October<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 789.</NOTE>. The French of Pondi∣cherry
and the Dutch at Negapatam had both sent Europeans to the
assistance of the Rajah; and the Dutch, besides, had supplied him
with guns and ammunition in abundance<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 753.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanjore well provided for defence.</NOTE> The fort of Tanjore
was accommodated with every necessary, for an obstinate defence;
a numerous garrison, composed of Arabs and disciplined Sepoys,
plenty of provisions, and an inexhaustible magazine of military
<PB N="198" REF="211"/>
stores. The care and success, with which Tulja-jî had provided the
means of war, proved, that he had long meditated a revolt; and
had his foreign allies seconded his hopes, he might, perhaps, as he
afterwards threatened, have “driven the English, not only from
“Tanjore, but from the coast.”</P>
<P>During the siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The siege.</NOTE> in which instances of spirit and courage were
exhibited, on both sides, the Rajah, in the usual manner of the
East, continued to treat for peace, to retard, if possible, the ope∣rations
of war. The season was far spent; the rains and mon∣soon
were near; and should these set in, he knew that the enemy
must break up the siege, and consequently put an end to treating;
and another year might procure new allies, or obtain the effectual
assistance of old friends.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A breach made.</NOTE> On the 25th day, after the trenches had
been opened, a breach, which was thought practicable, was made.
This circumstance induced the Rajah to think seriously of a tem∣porary
accommodation, to save his capital. The rains had, now,
set in, and the Nabob's son, dreading the consequences of a repulse,
in the assault, communicated the offers of the Rajah to General
Smith. He, at the same time, told the General, that if he thought
the fort could be taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace con∣cluded.</NOTE> he would delay the negociation; but the
General spoke so undecisively, on that head, that the terms offered
by Tulja-jî were accepted on the 27th of October<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 877, 878.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The most material conditions of this treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The articles.</NOTE> which, however, the
Rajah never meant to perform, were these: The immediate payment
of eight lacks, being the peishcuish of the two preceding years;
thirty-two lacks, and 50,000 rupees, for the expences of the army;
for which districts of his country, capable of paying that sum, in
two years, were assigned. The Rajah agreed, besides, to cede the
fort of Vellum, to give up his claim to the districts of Elangad and
Coiladdy, and to relinquish the Jaghire district of Arni. He pro∣mised
<PB N="199" REF="212"/>
mised to restore the lands, money and effects, which he had extort∣ed
from the greater and lesser Marawar; to send troops to the assist∣ance
of the Nabob, upon that prince's requisition; to be a friend
to the friends, an enemy to the enemies, of the Carnatic; to de∣liver
up European deserters, to give no protection to the run-away
Polygars of Warriarpollam and Arialore. He, also, engaged to
permit the trade of the English Company to extend itself through
his whole country; and to treat their weavers and other depend∣ents
with kindness<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's App. No. XXIV. p. 853, 854.</NOTE>. The Rajah had scarcely signed the treaty,
when he began to equivocate about the terms<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXV. p. 931.</NOTE>. But, as the guns
had not yet been drawn from the batteries, dispositions were made
for recommencing hostilities; and a fresh negociation ensued<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.

<P>When intelligence arrived at Madras of these transactions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presidency offended at any settle∣ment short of conquest; think the peace inse∣cure.</NOTE> the
Presidency expressed their concern and surprise at the terms of the
treaty, as inadequate to their expectations, and, in themselves, to∣tally
insecure. They were so much convinced of the latter, that
they declared, in their letter of the 7th of November, 1771, to
General Smith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771.</NOTE> that it appeared “necessary, that, in the very com∣mencement
<PB N="200" REF="213"/>
of peace they should be providing as if they were
on the eve of a war. They ordered him, therefore, as soon as
possible, to transmit to the Board a general return of the artillery,
ammunition and stores remaining, with their state and condition,
accompanied with an indent of what might be further requisite,
in case it should become necessary to recommence hostilities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 799.</NOTE>
They, however, declared that they would, on no account, have
the idea entertained, that they meant to renew the war; for that
they even wished to conceal from the public, they were appre∣hensive
another expedition against Tanjore might become neces∣sary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They express their dissatis∣faction to the Nabob,</NOTE> They expressed their dissatisfaction at the treaty, in still
stronger terms to the Nabob, in their letter of the 9th of Novem∣ber.
“Had the Rajah,” they said, submitted himself, and had
your Excellency then granted such terms, as should have been
thought safe and honourable to your government and the Com∣pany,
safe and honourable terms might have been adviseable.
But the Rajah has acted a very different part. He set both your
government and the Company at defiance, and compelled the
army to lay a regular siege to his capital. Many lives have been
lost, and great quantities of stores have been expended. The
siege advanced successfully, the breach was almost practicable, and
the officers and soldiers were in good spirits. Under these cir∣cumstances,
there was every reason to hope, that the fort might
soon have been taken; and then your Excellency might have
given the law, and settled the affairs of Tanjore, in a proper
manner<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p▪ 801, 802.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The Presidency expressed the same sentiments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and to the Court of Di∣rectors.</NOTE> in terms equally
strong, in their dispatches to the Court of Directors, dated the 28th
of February 1772<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXV. p. 929, 930, 931.</NOTE>. General Smith, in his letter to the Presidency
<PB N="201" REF="214"/>
of the 6th of November, 1771, makes use of the following re∣markable
expressions; “I have very freely given my sentiments,
with respect to the Rajah of Tanjore.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1771.</NOTE> I urged, that I thought
no medium could be preserved with him; but, at the time I did
so, I hoped whenever an expedition did take place, that it
would be with a firm resolution on the part of the Nabob, as
well as the Board, to REDUCE HIM ENTIRELY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 804.</NOTE>.” The Nabob,
urged by the discontent of the Presidency, became highly offended
with his son, for concluding a peace, when there was such a cer∣tain
prospect of terminating the war, by the taking of Tanjore.
Having expostulated with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob ex∣postulates with his son.</NOTE> in severe terms, for his conduct, he
told him, that he could only ascribe it, to his want of abilities, his
facility of disposition, or his having been corrupted by the Rajah<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXIV. p. 881.</NOTE>.
In short, the peace appeared so insecure in itself, so inadequate to the
claims of the Nabob and the delinquency of the Rajah, that it raised
a general discontent among the English as well as the natives.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A general dis∣satisfaction at any peace short of abso∣lute conquest.</NOTE> No∣thing
was talked of in the settlement, nothing was read but letters
from the army, representing the certainty of their taking Tanjore, had
not the peace prevented it; and every one declared, “that it was
shameful thus to stop the progress and tarnish the glory of the
British arms, in the moment that fortune presented the laurel<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXV. p. 930.</NOTE>.”
Such universal discontents at a peace, which saved his capital
and country to Tulja-jî, demonstrate, that he had deserved to have
lost both, in the opinion of all, who, from their being on the spot,
were the best judges of his delinquency<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The Court of Directors, in their letter of the 10th of April, 1770, make use of the fol∣lowing remarkable word: “As to what re∣lates to the Nabob, and the conduct, which you are to hold in the present troubles in your parts of India, a great deal must be left to your decision on the spot. You have certainly more opportunities than <HI>we</HI> of coming at the true knowledge of the causes, the origin and tendency of disputes, as on a sudden arise, among the powers of India, as of relations of interest in which we stand to them.” Rous's App. No. XVII. p. 404.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="215"/>
To the preceding account of the expedition of 1771, it may not
be improper to annex the opinion of Sir Robert Harland, then his
Majesty's Plenipotentiary on the coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Robert Harland's ac∣count of the expedition and treaty of 1771.</NOTE> concerning the conduct of the
Presidency of Fort St. George. That officer, after blaming their in∣activity,
from the month of February to September, proceeds thus,
in his letter to the Earl of Rochford: “The country of Tanjore
was then, as I have been informed, unprepared. The fort was
unprovided with the means of defence, the Rajah's troops were
neither formed nor disciplined. On the contrary, the Company's
servants possessed plenty of stores and ammunition; and an army
lay idle and inactive at Tritchinopoly, within a very short march
of Tanjore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Harland to the Secretary of State, February 15th, 1772.</NOTE>.” After specifying the unaccountable delays in un∣dertaking
the expedition, the Plenipotentiary states the equally in∣explicable
treaty, which terminated the war. “The army was
thirty-six days before Tanjore. The walls were breached, and
dispositions made for storming the place, when the whole was set∣tled
by negociation. The Nabob disavowed his share in that ne∣gociation.
The Governor was dissatisfied. The Nabob's son, in
his letters to his father, which I have read, says, that it was with
the advice, consent, knowledge, and approbation of the general,
he agreed to terms. The general, denying this charge, con∣siders
the whole, as a contrivance between the Nabob and his
son<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” After stating the improbability of the Nabob's being
concerned in frustrating the object of the expedition, Sir Robert
Harland proceeds: “To conclude the whole, when I consider
every thing, the situation, the strength, the riches of Tanjore,
its vicinity to the French at Pondicherry, the uneasiness of the
Rajah at his present state of dependence, the danger of future
inconveniencies, in case of his junction with the enemies of
<PB N="203" REF="216"/>
Great-Britain, it appears very difficult to discover a due attention
to the interests either of the Company or nation, through the
whole of this transaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Harland to the Secretary of
State, February 15th, 1772.</NOTE>.”—“The Rajah's peishcush had been
much reduced, by the treaty of 1762, from what it had formerly
been; and even that reduced tribute he did not pay. The trou∣bles,
which at any time arise in the Carnatic, are settled solely at
the expence of the Nabob; but though Tanjore is protected, the
Rajah contributes nothing towards the general defence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. There were very weighty reasons
for concluding the treaty; but they are foreign
to the object of this work.</NOTE>.”</P>

of 1771, the squadron was ordered to sail in the month of
March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Robert Harland suc∣ceeds Sir John Lindsay as plenipoten∣tiary.</NOTE> under the command of Sir Robert Harland, Baronet, Rear-Admiral
of the Blue. That officer, on his departure, was vested
with the same plenipotentiary powers from his Majesty to the princes
of India, which had been given to Sir John Lindsay, in the year
1769.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Object of his commission.</NOTE> The object of the commission, which was dated the 15th of
March, was to “inquire how far the eleventh article of the defi∣nitive
treaty of peace and friendship, between the King of Great
Britain, the most Christian King, and the King of Spain, con∣cluded
at Paris, the 10th of February, 1763, had been complied
with by the parties concerned; as also, to treat with any of the
princes or powers in India, to whom the eleventh article might
relate, with regard to the most effectual means of having the
stipulations, therein contained, punctually observed and carried
into execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVIII. p. 417.</NOTE>.” His Majesty, at the same time, promised,
That he would approve, ratify, and confirm what should be

Harland<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVIII. p, 417.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>On the second of September,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He arrives at Fort St. George.</NOTE> the Rear Admiral arrived at Fort St.
George<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 408.</NOTE>; and, on the 13th, he communicated to the Presidency
the following article of his instructions, as Plenipotentiary from his
Majesty, to the Princes and powers of India<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 409.</NOTE>. The words were;
“You will represent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Article of in∣struction, re∣lative to the Nabob.</NOTE> in the freest manner, to the Governor and
Council at Madrass, any complaints, which in your judgment shall
be well-founded, that may be made by the Nabob of Arcot, and
transmit to us the earliest intelligence thereof, with your senti∣ments
thereon<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 410.</NOTE>.” This royal interposition, expressed in such
explicit terms, raised the hopes of the Nabob, and expelled his fears.
Depending on the protection of the Sovereign, he naturally became
less anxious about retaining the favour of trading subjects; uncon∣scious
that this little glimpse of sun-shine was so soon to be extin∣tinguished by a storm.</P>
<P>The East India Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the character of the Com∣pany's origi∣nal manage∣ment.</NOTE> founded originally on the principles of
commerce, had carried very early into every department of their
management, all the hardened and unrelenting passions, which
never fail to accompany an insatiable love of gain. Their misde∣meanours
had made them known to the world, before their conse∣quence
had rendered them objects of attention; and their original
annals are stained with oppressions, piracies, frauds, and circum∣ventions.
Their limited power had confined their misdemeanors for
more than one hundred and fifty years, to a narrow circle; and
these were partly concealed, under the veil of secrecy, with which
they affected to cover their transactions. But it must be acknow∣ledged,
that, in those early times, their circumscribed commerce had
confined the management of their affairs to mean and unskilful
hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their affairs at h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in mean and un∣skilful hands.</NOTE> Their Directors at home were no more than low and
<PB N="206" REF="219"/>
rapacious tradesmen; and their servants abroad were chiefly
drawn from hospitals, appointed by charity for rearing indigent
and deserted boys. When the means of advantage grew more ex∣tensive,
by the concurrence of various revolutions in the East, the
management and service of the Company became objects of ambi∣tion
to persons of a better education, and more enlarged minds.
Some men of talents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some men of talents con∣cerned in their affairs.</NOTE> some of honour, several possessed of spirit and
courage conducted affairs at their boards, and fought their battles in
the field.<NOTE PLACE="marg">These were swayed by avarice, &amp;c.</NOTE> But even these were not able to resist that sordid prin∣ciple
of avarice, which is inherent in every mercantile institution;
to which also the almost equally obdurate passion of ambition was
annexed, when they acquired a controul over Princes, and the ma∣nagement
of provinces and kingdoms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“These are men, who are now become governors and viceroys of kingdoms larger, if we take our possessions from Surat to Ben∣gal, than made half the Roman empire; and these are the men, who by the rapid and im∣mense riches they acquire, from amongst the <HI>lowest</HI> of the people, who are to be expected to lock government in the face, with that as∣surance that has taught them to think, that money may decide any thing. Nor will they easily submit to part with power, however they came by it, they have so long been al∣lowed to exercise; and that has brought them such an immoderate degree of wealth, without violent opposition to every thing and every man, employed to prevent it.” Sir Robert Harland to the Secretary of State, Jan. 9th, 1773.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the period,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men of ability and principle, at this time, on the coast. But these can∣not resist jea∣lousy.</NOTE> which is the object of the present discussion, several
men of talents and strict principles were in the Direction at home,
and in the management of affairs on the Coast. But even these
were incapable of divesting themselves entirely of jealousy, when
they found that a Prince, whom they had been accustomed to con∣troul,
had obtained the protection of the Sovereign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com∣pany, from subjects, be∣come rivals to the Crown.</NOTE> The exten∣sive
possessions of the Company, an ample revenue, a large army,
the many lucrative, and even honourable places in their gift had,
in a manner, raised them from the rank of subjects, to that of rivals
to the crown. Their principal servants, conscious of their own for∣mer
consequence, could not permit themselves to be deprived of any
part of that consequence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intemperance in correspon∣dence and consultations.</NOTE> without resentment. This circumstance
introduced a degree of intemperance into their consultations and
<PB N="207" REF="220"/>
correspondence; and gave birth to unnecessary complaints of
the conduct of the Nabob to their Superiors at home.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Complaints proceeding from jealousy made the foundation of injustice.</NOTE> Those com∣plaints
were greedily seized, by a more unprincipled DIRECTION,
than that which subsisted at the time; and were made the specious
pretexts of coercive measures against the Nabob; which measures
sprung, in fact, from an unforgiving jealousy, and self-interested mo∣tives.
But these were the measures of succeeding times. The Directors
of 1771, though they expressed their jealousy of the interference of the
crown, were sensible of the independent rights of the Nabob. In
their dispatch of the 10th of April, they used the following remark∣able
words:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Direc∣tors own, that they have no right to in∣terfere in the Nabob's af∣fairs.</NOTE> “We have no natural ally but the Nabob.—Our con∣nection
with the Nabob stands entirely on ancient friendship, and
reciprocal kindness, and we wish to continue it on the same foot∣ing.
But as <HI>we</HI> cannot be compelled to follow his projects, when
they appear totally repugnant to our interests, so, on the other
hand, <HI>he</HI> cannot be forced into our views, if they are disagreeable
to him: All we have, therefore, left, is to expostulate with him.
He must determine for himself, and we for ourselves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVII. p. 401.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>In the passage just cited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet jealous of the interfe∣rence of the Crown.</NOTE> the Directors defined the limits of the
Company's power, with respect to the affairs of the Carnatic.
How a succeeding Court trampled down this fence shall be, here∣after,
both explained and exposed. The Directors of 1771, not∣withstanding
their moderation, with regard to the independent
rights of the Carnatic, were, at the very moment of writing their
opinion on that subject, sapping the foundation of those rights, by
endeavouring to remove the support of the Crown from the Nabob.
They lamented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They lament that a royal commission is sent.</NOTE> that an unusual commission had been granted,
without any communication with themselves; and consequently
without previous steps being taken, for the prevention of those jea∣lousies,
which might naturally be supposed to arise from such cir∣cumstances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 403.</NOTE>.
Though they did not chuse then to deny the <HI>right</HI> of
<PB N="208" REF="221"/>
the Crown to send representatives to its allies, they insinuated, that
the rights and privileges of the Company rested upon as high autho∣rity
as the King's commission<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVII. p. 403.</NOTE>. These sentiments, expressed to their
Servants, prove, that they had already made applications to Govern∣ment,
for the redelivering the fugitive Nabob into the hands of his
former keepers.</P>
<P>In a country tossed by faction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections on the disposition of govern∣ment.</NOTE> and stunned by clamour, ministers
destitute of ambition, and fond of ease, too frequently become little
solicitous, about the honour of the state. When the dog of discontent
growls at the door of the Cabinet, they throw to him a fragment of
the prerogative, as a sop, to procure his silence; and, with a pernici∣ous
want of dignity, they hope to diminish their cares, by lessening
their authority. This torpid disposition of mind is terrified at an ex∣tension
of power, as it is accompanied by an increase of labour; and in∣formation
is disagreeable and irksome, as it may bring on the trouble
of doing justice. Each demand, for circumscribing the consequence
of the state and the rights of the crown, is heard by such men with
avidity, as every diminution of power contracts the circle of public
business. This ruinous system of frigid policy, they endeavour to im∣pose
upon the world under the name of moderation; but, by prose∣cuting
it too far, the honour of the state is tarnished, and the pledged
faith of the sovereign violated.</P>
<P>The East-India Company might have felt this self-denying princi∣ple
in government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">East-India Company had experienced the self-deny∣ing principle of the state.</NOTE> almost during the whole of the present reign.
That Company had obtained countries, provinces, and kingdoms,
under the protection and assisted by the power of the state. But go∣vernment,
instead of asserting the State's claim of sovereignty, seemed
afraid to question the Company's rights; for fear the trouble of a
revenue of near six millions a year should fall into their own hands.
The anxiety of the Court of Directors, about a royal commission to
<PB N="209" REF="222"/>
Indian princes, was vain and superfluous. The state had permitted
them to rise from the rank of subjects to that of sovereigns, to hold
dominions more extensive, and scarcely less valuable, than its own;
to maintain an army more numerous than that of Great-Britain; to
appoint their relations, dependents and servants, to offices of more
power and emolument, than any in the gift of the Crown; to carry
insolence and oppression to every quarter of Asia; to dethrone
princes, and to invest mean persons with the pomp and authority of
royalty. It was, therefore, highly improbable, that a government
so indulgent to the Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nabob deserted by government, and delivered back to the Company.</NOTE> would refuse one poor Nabob to his
former lords. It accordingly happened, that when the Directors
mustered sufficient courage to demand the truant, the royal commis∣sion
was immediately withdrawn; and he was delivered into their
hands, to be punished for his credulity in the support of govern∣ment,
as well as his defection from the authority of the Company.</P>
<P>But had the royal commission continued in India,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Royal com∣mission nuga∣tory.</NOTE> unless the pro∣mise
of the Crown to redress grievances, and to draw clear lines be∣tween
the power of the Nabob and that of the Company, had been
also performed, it was not worth the price of the sheep-skin, on
which it was written. Though the managers of the affairs of the
Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">yet alarms the Company,</NOTE> both in England and abroad, were at first alarmed, they
soon found, that a commission, neither supported nor followed by an
enquiry, was no more than a paper-kite, suspended over their heads.
Unfortunately for the Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and deceives the Nabob.</NOTE> having been accustomed to the validity
of seals in India, he reposed implicit confidence in the faith of that
of Great-Britain. This confidence was encouraged and confirmed,
by the paper-war, which was carried on between the plenipoten∣tiaries
and the Presidency; for he was then to learn, that the autho∣rity
of a king, to which his principles had annexed the idea of in∣vincibility,
was destined to yield to that of trading subjects.</P>
<P>The contest by letters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The contest between Sir John Lindsay and the Presi∣dency,</NOTE> between Sir John Lindsay and the Presi∣dency,
which had begun, soon after his arrival in July 1770, had
<PB N="210" REF="223"/>
languished in the course of the summer of 1771. When Sir John
Lindsay left the coast in October, he was succeeded in his differences
with the Presidency, as well as in his powers to the Nabob, by Sir
Robert Harland.<NOTE PLACE="marg">taken up by Sir Robert Harland.</NOTE> That plenipotentiary, either impressed with the in∣justice
of the Company to the Nabob, or anxious to acquire his confi∣dence,
by an appearance of zeal, espoused his cause, with a vehemence,
which created obstructions to its progress, by its own rapidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Rous's Appendix, No. XVIII. p.
415, 416, &amp;c.</NOTE>.
The Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob for an alliance with the Marattas.</NOTE> impressed by fears from the Marattas, or gained by their
promises, had shewn a great eagerness, for an alliance with that na∣tion,
for more than a year.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presi∣dency favour Hyder Ali.</NOTE> The Presidency, on the other hand,
either afraid of Hyder Ali, or bound by secret promises to that chief,
had opposed the alliance; and, with perseverance, and perhaps with
prudence, had hitherto adhered to a strict neutrality<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1401.</NOTE>. The Ma∣rattas
had wooed them, as the lion does his mate, mixing threats
with courtship. Hyder was extremely polite; and as they had smarted
under his force, his present kindness acquired value from the me∣mory
of former injuries<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1387, &amp; passim.</NOTE>. They thought it, therefore, expedient
to support Hyder Ali against the Marattas, “provided the revenues
and resources of the Carnatic were under <HI>their</HI> controul<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.” The
result, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marattas in the pay of the Rajah of Tanjore.</NOTE> was, that neither Hyder nor the Marattas were as∣sisted.
The latter, willing to gain five lacks of rupees<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1394.</NOTE>, which the
Rajah of Tanjore had engaged to pay, upon condition of their in∣vading
the Carnatic<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1395.</NOTE>, entered the passes before the end of the year
1771. To save his country, from the ravages of those marauders,
the Nabob was obliged to pay down a considerable sum of money,
besides presents of jewels, fire-arms and elephants<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Harland takes the merit of
having induced the Marattas to retreat. (Ap∣pendix,
p. 444.) But it is probable, that the
money and jewels of the Nabob added some
weight to his interposition.</NOTE>.</P>

In the correspondence, between the plenipotentiary and the Presi∣dency,
relative to the Marattas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Robert Harland ex∣plains the right, which the Nabob had to rely on the Crown.</NOTE> the former explained, in ample
terms, the right, which the Nabob had, to rely on the protection of
his Majesty and the support of the Crown. “In the Nabob's pre∣sent
circumstances (says Sir Robert Harland), he claims the royal
protection, so often promised to him, by his late Majesty George
the Second, and repeated by his present Majesty, our sovereign,
in several letters addressed to his Highness, strongly expressive of
the greatest friendship and most perfect regard for him and his
family. At the same time, he throws himself upon the nation for
protection, agreeable to his expectations, from the eleventh article
of the treaty with France and Spain in 1763<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVIII. p. 416.</NOTE>.” Having speci∣fied
the Nabob's right to the support of the state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He animad∣verts on the jealousy of the Presidency.</NOTE> he animadverts
with severity, on the opposition given, by the Company's servants,
to that support. Having demanded an account of their transactions
with the country powers, they had told him, that they “could not,
consistently with their trust, render an account of their conduct to
him, or to any but a constitutional power<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 419.</NOTE>.” This expression,
appearing to deny the authority of his commission, threw the pleni∣potentiary
into a violent rage.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He accuses them of pre∣sumption and arrogance.</NOTE> “Your charge seems to me (he said)
to be directly pointed at the royal authority, and the undoubted
rights of the Crown. When you take upon you to censure a
measure, which is the sacred privilege of majesty, and the consti∣tutional
right of our sovereign, let me tell you, it is very unbe∣coming,
it is presumptuous, it is arrogant<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 427.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>This angry language terrified the Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are ter∣rified.</NOTE> and, by raising the
hopes of the Nabob, led that unfortunate Prince into error. He
could no longer doubt of the permanent support of a Crown, whose
authorised servant had irritated the Company beyond their common
pitch of forgiveness. In proportion as the Nabob's expectations of
<PB N="212" REF="225"/>
royal favour increased; the confidence of the Presidency, in their
own safety, diminished. “The heavy charge brought against us,”
they said, “evidently shews what is intended against us, and ren∣ders
any attempt to justify our conduct to Sir Robert Harland im∣proper;
as it is necessary we should reserve our defence, until we
are called upon to make it in a legal and constitutional course<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVIII. p. 22.</NOTE>.”
Trivial as these circumstances are in themselves, they deserve to be
recorded, as they influenced the conduct of the Nabob; and con∣sequently
the subsequent measures of the Company.</P>
<P>During these disputes between the Plenipotentiary and the Presi∣dency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expedition against the Marawars meditated.</NOTE>
the latter were meditating an expedition against the Greater
and Lesser Marawars, Polygars dependent on the government of the
Carnatic. The country of Marawar, as has been already mentioned,
depended anciently on the province of Madura,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of their depend∣ence on the Carnatic.</NOTE> which was itself
subject to the Rajah of Tritchinopoly, long before the country fell
by conquest into the hands of the Mahommedans. The state of
the subjection of the Marawars to the government of Tritchinopoly
was, that they paid a certain annual tribute; and brought, upon re∣quisition,
a certain number of troops into the field, at their own ex∣pence,
when their superior was engaged in war<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXVI. p. 941.</NOTE>. In case of either
neglect or disobedience of orders they were fined, like other Zemin∣dars;
and when they sent a less force than the established number
of troops, government used to levy a proportionable sum upon the
revenues of their countries. During the troubles which succeeded
the death of Anwar-ul-dien, father of the present Nabob, the Ma∣rawars
paid little attention to the government of the Carnatic.
When peace was restored,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣tory conduct.</NOTE> they sometimes sent small presents, but
no regular tribute, to the Nabob; but, in time of war, they neither
sent troops nor furnished money for the general defence. When
the Rajah of Tanjore invaded their territories in the beginning of
<PB N="213" REF="226"/>
1771, they owned their errors and professed their entire submission
to the Nabob<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXI. p. 577.</NOTE>; but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refuse their assistance a∣gainst Tan∣jore.</NOTE> though the expedition against Tanjore was
partly undertaken on their account, they furnished neither troops
nor provisions during the siege, when required by their superior, in
terms of their tenure and dependence<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXVI. p. 912. 946.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Ramnadaporam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1772. Capital 100 miles from Tritchino∣poly.</NOTE> the capital of the Greater Marawar, is situated
on that point of the continent which advances nearest to the island
of Ceylon<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXVI. p. 950.</NOTE>. That of the Nalcooty Polygar, or Lesser Marawar, is
called Tripatore<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The first lies at the distance of little more than
one hundred miles to the South of Tritchinopoly; the latter is forty
miles nearer to the last-mentioned city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The two Marawars could
bring, upon an emergency, twenty thousand men into the field<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>;
but their troops, like those of other Polygars, were rather a rabble,
than soldiers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They prepare to resist.</NOTE> Having received intelligence of the intended expedition,
they assembled their native troops in the beginning of March 1772;
and entering into a treaty with the Dutch, the Presidency of Nega∣patam
promised to write to the Governor of Colombo, for fifteen
hundred Europeans and as many Malays<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 952.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Army marches against them.</NOTE> The hostile appearance
of the Marattas on the borders of the Carnatic, had suspended the
expedition for more than seven months; but that fear being re∣moved,
orders were issued to General Smith to march, with the
troops in the South, against the refractory Polygars. The plan and
conduct of the expedition were left entirely to the General. But, as
the Company only acted as friends and allies to the Nabob, nego∣tiation
and treaty were left wholly to that Prince<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 956.</NOTE>. The Presi∣dency,
at the same time that they own, that the right of peace and
war was vested in the Nabob, insinuated to the General, that he
<PB N="214" REF="227"/>
ought not to agree to any treaty till the Polygars were entirely re∣duced<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVI. p. 956.</NOTE></P>
<P>General Smith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ramnadapo∣ram taken.</NOTE> having marched from Tritchinopoly on the 11th
of May 1772, before the end of the month sat down before Ramna∣daporam<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 989.</NOTE>.
The town being ill fortified and worse defended, was
taken by assault, on the 2d of June, with very inconsiderable loss on
the side of the victors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 990.</NOTE>. As the plunder of the place, by the laws
of war, became the property of the captors, the Nabob's eldest son,
who attended General Smith, on the part of his father, in the expe∣dition,
agreed to pay a stipulated sum to the army for the right to
the spoil<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 998.</NOTE>. The other forts belonging to the Greater Marawar soon
followed the fate of the capital<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1002.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Army marches against Nal∣cooty;</NOTE> General Smith then directed his
march against the Polygar of Nalcooty, or the Lesser Marawar.
That unfortunate Polygar fell a victim to the negligence of his own
Vackeels, who had negotiated a treaty of submission with the young
Nabob. Lieutenant-colonel Bonjour, whom the Presidency had ordered
to proceed from Madura with a detachment, to support the operations
of the main army, was advancing with hasty strides towards the resi∣dence
of the Little Marawar. When the terms of the treaty were
settled, General Smith delivered letters to be sent, by the Polygar's
agents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">who is killed in an assault, owing to the negligence of his Vackeels.</NOTE> to stop the progress of Bonjour. But they delayed to send the
letters; and the result was, that the Lieutenant-colonel attacked the
strong post into which the Lesser Marawar had retired<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 1085.</NOTE>; and in the
assault the Polygar was slain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1006.</NOTE>. The death of the Lesser Marawar left
his whole country to the entire disposal of the victors. This event
happened on the 25th of June 1772<NOTE N="§§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1007. 1027. The conquest of
the two Marawars was obtained with the loss
of twenty men. Ibid. p. 1012.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The expedition against Tanjore in the year 1771,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new quar∣rel with Tan∣jore.</NOTE> had rather
irritated than humbled the Rajah. The retaining of the fort of
<PB N="215" REF="228"/>
Vellum, which had been intended by the Presidency as a check on
Tulja jî<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1100.</NOTE>, had hurt his pride and rouzed his resentment. He,
therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah pre∣vents provi∣sions from be∣ing sent to Vellum.</NOTE> refused to permit provisions to be carried to the place;
alleging, “That the stipulation was merely the cession of the fort,
which could by no means be construed as an engagement to ren∣der
its market flourishing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1099, 1100.</NOTE>” To this quibble, in evasion of the
late agreement with his superior, he added serious and dangerous
intrigues for disturbing the peace of the Carnatic. In the month
of June 1772,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He negotiates with the Marattas.</NOTE> he was known to negotiate with the Marattas; and
to have offered to that government ten lacks of rupees, upon con∣dition
of their sending an army of horse to his aid<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.</NOTE>. The objects
the Rajah wished to obtain by the assistance of the Marattas were,
“the reduction of Vellum, the removal of the Nabob's people in
the assigned lands from his country, and an acquittal of the
Peishcush<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1099.</NOTE>.” Those rash schemes were entirely planned by the
Rajah himself;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nego∣tiation carried on by his vulgar fa∣vourites.</NOTE> for, as he knew that both Mona-jî and the Dob∣beer<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>
would dissuade him from measures likely to involve him in
inextricable difficulties, he carried on this negotiation secretly, by
his mean dependents and vulgar friends. Whilst he solicited fo∣reign
enemies to invade the Carnatic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He protects the fugitive Polygars.</NOTE> he received, protected, and
encouraged the fugitive Polygars of the Marawar country, who
were meditating new disturbances<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1101, 1102.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the beginning of 1773,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is led by men of low birth and mean ta∣lents.</NOTE> the Rajah seems to have re-admitted
into a degree of his confidence Hussein Chan Soor, the Mahommedan
fisherman, who had been his minister during a part of the year
1770<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1104. 1106.</NOTE>. Several other persons of mean birth and abilities planned
his measures and shared his favours. The friends of the expelled
Marawars flattering his vanity and inflaming his passions by their
<PB N="216" REF="229"/>
intrigues, endeavoured to obtain his aid to restore their affairs.
Having applied to Hyder Ali for a force to recover their respective
possessions, that chief told them, “That he knew who <HI>they</HI> were,
but that, if they would bring him a letter from the Rajah of Tan∣jore,
he would then agree to give them some assistance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1105.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">He corre∣sponds with Hyder.</NOTE> Hav∣ing
carried this intelligence to Tulja-jî, he agreed, with joy,
to give them a favourable and full letter, agreeably to their utmost
wishes. He received, at the same time, into his capital, with great
ceremony and civility, Vencata Narrain, the Vackeel of Hyder<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The
Vackeel promised, in his master's name, that immediately, on his
return to Seringapatam, from an expedition in which he was then
engaged, he would send and promote the assistance of the Ma∣rattas<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1106.</NOTE>. To prevent a discovery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He loads his Vackeel with civilities and presents.</NOTE> the Rajah dismissed the Vackeel,
after loading him with marks of respect; whilst, at the same time,
he wrote letters to the Maratta government, full of the most
flattering expressions<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But whilst he was planning measures
of danger, he was busy in disgracing such of his old servants, as
were possessed of abilities to carry them into execution.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He strikes off the allowance of Mona-jî.</NOTE> He de∣prived
Mona-jî, not only of all power, but his allowance from go∣vernment,
except two villages, which that chief possessed by way
of Jaghire<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> Hussein Chan Soor, the fisherman, so often men∣tioned,
rose in favour, in proportion as Mona-jî declined. This
vulgar statesman, deriving boldness from ignorance, advised the Ra∣jah
to with-hold the money due to the Nabob, and set that prince
at open defiance<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Secret intelligence of these transactions was received at Madras
in the month of April;<NOTE PLACE="marg">His intrigues at Poonah dis∣covered by Mr. Moslyn.</NOTE> and that part of the intrigues of Tulja-jî,
which regarded the Marattas, was fully discovered in May, by Mr.
Mostyn, the Company's resident at the court of Poonah. In a letter
<PB N="217" REF="230"/>
of the 14th of May, Mr. Mostyn informs the Presidency at Fort
St. George, that a Gozamie, by name Mohim Geer, applied to the
Maratta government, as Vackeel from the Rajah of Tanjore,
for leave to raise ten thousand horse, which he made no secret
were to be employed against the Nabob of the Carnatic<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1105.</NOTE>. The
same intelligence had been conveyed, on the 6th of May, by Mr.
Mostyn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Marattas first agree to his levying troops in their country.</NOTE> to his immediate superiors, the Presidency of Bombay<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>
Though the Maratta government yielded, at first, to the Rajah's
request, by means of presents to some of the ministers, the levying
the troops was afterwards stopt, by the influence of Sacaram Bapoo,
who pointed out the bad consequences, which might attend the
measure; but the Vackeel of the Rajah still retained hopes, as he
had received no positive denial<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst the Rajah's emissaries were employed in soliciting the as∣sistance
of the Marattas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He applies again to Hy∣der.</NOTE> he himself used every art of entreaty and
persuasion, to gain the support of Hyder Ali. He sent for Vencata
Narain, the Vackeel of that chief, and told him, that he had no
other protector, but his master<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1111.</NOTE>. That no union, no friendship,
no cordial alliance could ever subsist between himself, the Nabob
and the English Company.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He promises to join him with his whole force,</NOTE> That it was incumbent on Hyder to
come with his whole force; and that he himself would collect his
own forces and join him, as well as the expelled Polygars of Ma∣rawar

against the Nabob and the Company admitted of little doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and to make over to him Madura, &amp;c.</NOTE> the
provinces of Madura and Tinnevelly might be easily taken, which
two countries should be made over to Hyder for his assistance, to∣gether
with some supplies of money. The Rajah earnestly solicited
the Vackeel to write to his master, in the most persuasive terms,
to prevail upon him to advance speedily, with his whole force. He,
<PB N="218" REF="231"/>
at the same time and to the same purpose, wrote a long letter to
Hyder himself; and to give more weight to the negociation, the
old Dobbeer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hyder's an∣swer.</NOTE> or Duan, wrote another letter<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1111.</NOTE>. To these letters Hy∣der
sent an answer desiring to know, how much ready money the
Rajah would give? By what means he proposed to take and cede
over to him the provinces of Madura and Tinnevelly? What friends
he had in those countries? Who of the Polygars were his allies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1112.</NOTE>?
That he must determine, on all these circumstances, and inform him

<P>Though the intrigues of Tulja-jî,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He deviates in every point from his duty.</NOTE> with the Marattas and Hyder
Ali, were not likely to produce any serious or immediate effect, their
existence proved the dangerous and restless conduct of that Rajah.
During his applications for assistance beyond the limits of the Car∣natic,
he deviated, in almost every point, from his duty, as a de∣pendent
on that country. In the expedition against the two Ma∣rawars, he chose to neglect to obey the requisition of his superior,
for the assistance of his troops<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1109.</NOTE>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">He had aided the Marawar.</NOTE> on the contrary, he dismissed a

agreement signed, sealed and sworn to, at the gates of Tanjore,
in October 1771, to refuse his protection to the runaway Polygars
<PB N="219" REF="232"/>
of Warrior-pollam and Alianore, and to restore their effects. But
he not only detained their effects, but had assigned them a place of
refuge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">whose effects he detains.</NOTE> in the district of Cumcurrum belonging to Tanjore. He
permitted, or rather persuaded the Collories of his own country to
make incursions, into the province of Tritchinopoly; and to drive
the cattle of the inhabitants away.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Will not pay a debt owing to the Com∣pany.</NOTE> He neglected to discharge the

the English garrison at Vellum, from being regularly supplied with
provisions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1110.</NOTE>. Though he was in considerable arrears to the Nabob<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>,
he appears to have been in no want of money, by the sums, which
he had offered, and actually sent, to other powers, to induce them
to invade the Carnatic<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1105.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Determined to support his disobedience and refractory conduct to∣wards

obtain a considerable loan from Goland Moodaly, “who was Dubash
to most of the GREAT FOLKS at Madras<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1113.</NOTE>.” Had he pursued
this plan, with more constancy, and to a much larger extent, the
GREAT FOLKS, who were the masters of Goland Moodely, might
have had an interest, in overlooking for some time longer his designs.
But Tulja-jî, though not more faithless, was less prudent, than his
father Pretaupa Sing; who had always an expert agent at Madras to
negociate a <HI>loan,</HI> when he wished to obtain a favour. But the present
Rajah chose rather to enter into dangerous connexions, with the
Dutch, than to negociate with the English Presidency. These con∣nexions
were deeply rooted, and, therefore, full of peril to the
<PB N="220" REF="233"/>
Company, as well as the Nabob. The latter had written to the Ge∣neral
of Batavia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Governor of Batavia avows his support of the Rajah.</NOTE> complaining of his subordinates at Negapatnam,

was busy in breaking every article of the agreement of 1771, the

the Presidency to listen to the requisition of the Nabob, for
the assistance of the Company to reduce entirely an inmate so dan∣gerous
to the peace and security of the Carnatic. Mr. Du Prè, who
had been President during the first expedition against Tanjore,
had resigned the government, and returned to Europe, in the end
of February 1773; and Mr. Hastings, who had been designed to
succeed him in the chair, had left the coast, more than a year before

Mr. Wynch, the second in Council, had succeeded Mr. Du Prè,

to the reduction of Tanjore, was made. The Select Committee,
in deliberating on the subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The treaty of 1762 declared null and void.</NOTE> declared, that the treaty of 1762 had
been cancelled, by the conduct of the Rajah, which obliged the gua∣rantees
of that treaty to take up arms, and enter into a solemn war<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1110.</NOTE>.
That it is established by the law of nations, that when a rupture
happens, all treaties between the contending parties, prior to that

or that others may be substituted in their place<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII p. 725.</NOTE>. That the
treaty of 1762 was so far from having been restored by the agree∣ment,
which had terminated the war of 1771, that it was not even
mentioned or alluded to, in that agreement. That, at the commence∣ment
of the expedition, the Presidency had promised and agreed,
not to interfere in any negociations between the Nabob and the Ra∣jah;
but to leave the whole to be settled by the former<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXVII. p. 1116.</NOTE>. That the
Nabob had actually settled the whole, without a single allusion to
the treaty of 1762. That, upon the whole, as war, which extin∣guishes
all treaties, had intervened, the Company could not be con∣sidered,
as guarantees to a treaty, which no longer existed.</P>
<P>Though the measures of the Presidency,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments and facts, re∣lative to the necessity of calling the Rajah to ac∣count.</NOTE> who were vested with the
whole executive powers or the Company, were, in their <HI>political ca∣pacity,</HI>
decisive, and when they regarded the country powers IRRE∣VOCABLE,

foundation for applause. But, neither in the present case, nor in
any other, beyond the trading powers, granted to the Company by
charter, are the motives, reasons or arguments of the servants of the
Company to be admitted, by the dispassionate, as a justification of
wrong measures, or a confirmation of those, which were right. This
observation is, by no means, made to invalidate the justness of their
reasonings upon the treaty of 1762.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Even if both he and his an∣cestor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been inde∣pendent.</NOTE> Had the Rajah and his ances∣tors

<PB N="222" REF="235"/>
not only render it justifiable, but, from self-preservation, necessary,
in the Nabob, to prevent the intended mischief, by the power, which
Providence had placed in his hands. The Presidency joining, or re∣fusing
to join, could alter, in no degree or respect, the nature of the
case.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Company had no claim to appear as principals.</NOTE> They had no claim to appear, as principals in the war, they
had no right to decide upon its issue. The only thing of which they
were the competent judges was the expediency of the measure, with
regard to the interests of their constituents. That this expediency
existed, is apparent from the state of things, as well as from their
own declaration. If their masters thought otherwise, they had a
right to censure, to suspend, to dismiss their servants; but they had
no right to interfere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No right to reverse the effect of the war.</NOTE> none to reverse the effect of the measure, in

<P>The Presidency were so sensible of the expediency of the expedi∣tion

they were much more eager for that measure, than the Nabob<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1124.</NOTE>.
That prince, dividing his fears between Hyder and the Marattas, the
allies of the Rajah, was unwilling to risque the ruin of his own
country, from an invasion made by either of those powers, by an
expedition of uncertain event, against Tanjore<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. It was known,
that the object of each of those powers was to take Tanjore into pos∣session,
and not under protection<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1122.</NOTE>; and the march of the Nabob's
forces against the place would probably be a signal, for their invading
his dominions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He declares his unwilling∣ness.</NOTE> The Nabob, therefore, declared that he was unwil∣ing
to press a service of such danger, unless it suited in every respect
the Company's affairs<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. He promised, however, to find the re∣sources,
in the same proportion, as during the last siege. He de∣clared
his doubt of the event, as the Rajah, besides his connexion
<PB N="223" REF="236"/>
with the country powers, was in friendship with the French, and
had promises of assistance, from the Danish factory of Tranquebar<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XVII Ibid. p. 1123.</NOTE>
The Select Committe represented to the Nabob,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Select Committee urge him to the expedi∣tion.</NOTE> that in case the ex∣pedition
against Tanjore should take place at all, it ought to be un∣dertaken,
in time sufficient to bring it to a conclusion, before the
setting in of the rains<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. They, at the same time, resolved in their
minutes, that “it was proper and <HI>necessary</HI> that the expedition
against Tanjore be undertaken; and that the present opportunity,
all circumstances considered, is the most favourable for carrying
the same into execution<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1125.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Council confirm their resolutions.</NOTE> The resolution of the Select Com∣mittee
was confirmed, by the Council at large, on the 29th of June
1773. In their minutes upon the subject, they recapitulated old
arguments and advanced new. They agreed, that as the treaty of
1762 was annulled and extinguished, by an intervening war, fol∣lowed
by another treaty, in which the Company were not mention∣ed;
that “all idea of the existence of a guarantee was removed.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">All idea of a guarantee had been removed.</NOTE>

body could not have, with any justice, accused their subjects of ne∣glecting
the interests of the Company, in their stipulations with the
Nabob. They insisted, that he should not only pay for the future,
but replace the pay already issued to three thousand Seapoys, which
the Presidency had thought proper to levy some time before<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1118.</NOTE>. But

and the garrison, consisting of twenty thousand fighting men<NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, p. 1216.</NOTE>, ex∣cept
a few, not expecting an attack, “had retired from the breach

usually attend a conquest acquired by assault<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1217.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Whilst Tanjore was pressed by a siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Operations against the Dutch.</NOTE> the Dutch Presidency of
Negapatnam took possession of Nagore, a considerable sea-port, be∣longing
to the province of Tanjore<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1362.</NOTE>, together with several valuable
districts, on the pretence of having purchased them from the Rajah.
To support their usurpation, they had assembled a considerable body
of troops in the neighbourhood of Nagore, to defend their new ac∣quisitions.
The Nabob, after representing the invalidity of those
transactions, between his tributary and the Dutch, and likewise
the bad consequences, which might result to his government, and
consequently to the Company, from the addition of influence
and consequence, which any other European power in India might
derive from territorial possessions, requested the assistance of the
troops to recover the alienated districts, should the Dutch refuse to
relinquish their claims in an amicable manner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. But the Presi∣dency,
though sensible of the danger and inconvenience of per∣mitting
any other Company to increase their power on the coast,
shewed an unwillingness to adopt a measure, which might be con∣structed
into a violation of treaties subsisting between the Crown of
Great Britain and the States of the United Provinces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. They con∣sulted
therefore, Sir Robert Harland, his Majesty's Minister Pleni∣potentiary,
on that subject; and he gave it clearly as his opinion,
that “the Company's assisting the Nabob, in recovering lands un∣justly
alienated by his Feudatory, could be considered, in no re∣spect,
<PB N="227" REF="240"/>
as an infringement of treaties, which could not have re∣garded
any encroachments wantonly made on dominions, to the
disposal of which the Crown, much less the Company, had no right.
That as the Presidency, as auxiliaries, had actually assisted the Na∣bob,
in the reduction of Tanjore, it was equally incumbent upon
them to give their aid to put him in possession of the country de∣pendent
on that capital. That he himself, as the representative of
the King of Great Britain, would have no objection to assist the
Company with the force under his command, should it be re∣quired<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1363.</NOTE>.”</P>
<P>The Presidency were sensible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the army.</NOTE> “that from the system of govern∣ment,
and the nature of tenures in India, the Rajah of Tanjore,
not being Lord Paramount of his country, but tributary to the
Nabob, had no right to alienate any part of his lands, without
the consent of his Liege Lord, the Ruler of the Carnatic Payen∣ghaut<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1368.</NOTE>;”
but notwithstanding this resolution of the Presidency,
the army, who expected little benefit from a contest with Europe∣ans,
shewed an apparent unwillingness to proceed on that service<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXVII. passim.</NOTE>;
and “consequently, nothing was done with spirit<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Harland to the Secretary of
State, Oct. 29th, 1773.</NOTE>.” Accounts of
this unwillingness were soon carried to Negapatnam; and the Dutch
became consequently obstinate<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. The troops were, at length, pre∣vailed
on to proceed, but with a peculiar refinement on the opera∣tions
of war. The Nabob's troops were placed in the front, to ex∣pel
the Dutch; and those of the Company were only to assist, in
case of necessity, hoping, by this subterfuge, to seem not to have
acted against the Dutch.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs set∣tled.</NOTE> This conceit was practised with such a
minute ceremony, that some of the Company's Officers, who led
the Nabob's cavalry, “unsashed, and declared themselves off
<PB N="228" REF="241"/>
“duty<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. passim.</NOTE>.” But the Dutch thought proper to relieve them from
their embarrassment, by relinquishing the territory and town of Na∣gore
to the Nabob, upon his replacing the money which they had
paid to the Rajah<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Honourable</HI> Company have agreed, in

<P>Thus fell Tanjore into the hands of the Nabob of the Carnatic,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanjore fell by a regular conquest.</NOTE>
by a regular conquest accomplished in a solemn and necessary war.
To the incontestible right which that Prince acquired by this event,
to the territory of his dangerous and rebellious feudatory, was added
the sanction of the King of Great-Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Great Britain gives his sanction to that conquest in his own person,</NOTE> not only in the person of
his representative acting in India by the authority of the great seal,
but even by his Majesty's personal approbation of the measure.
Sir Robert Harland had ordered, at the desire of the Presidency,
two of his Majesty's ships, the Dolphin and the Swallow, to bring
troops and stores from Masulipatam, to assist at the reduction of Tan∣jore.
He,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and by his Plenipoten∣tiary.</NOTE> at the same time, signified to the Governor and Council,
That should they find it expedient for the present service, he was
ready to land the marine forces under his command to do duty in
the garrisons or to act in the field. He assured them, that should
they judge it necessary to require any further assistance of his Ma∣jesty's
ships, or of the force under his command, they had only to
signify their wishes; as he was well-disposed to co-operate with them,
in every thing, for the public good<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1134,
1135.</NOTE>. His Majesty had approved
of the first expedition against Tanjore, in a letter under his own
hand; and it may consequeutly be inferred, that he approved of the
second expedition, which was founded upon the same grounds of
justice, expediency, and necessity. The words in his Majesty's letter
to the Nabob, which is dated April 7, 1772<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Papers published by the Company in 1777, vol. i. p. iv.</NOTE>, are these: “It gave

The Directors of 1773 had, in the most public and decisive
manner, approved of the expedition of 1771, which differed neither
in justice nor propriety from that of 1773. They had thanked
Mr. Du Prè, who had concerted and executed the measure, for his
eminent services to the Company, in every part of his conduct,
during his government, and, in particular, in his SUPPORT of the
rights of the Nabob. They had rewarded Mr. Hastings, who
had been Second in Council at Fort St. George, when the expedition
of 1771 was planned and executed, with the government of Ben∣gal.
For near thirteen months after intelligence of taking Tanjore
was received, at the India-House, the Court of Directors, like their
predecessors in 1773, seem to have entirely approved of the mea∣sure,
by their total silence on the subject. It was not till the 12th
of April, 1775, the very day on which the Court of Proprietors
were met to chuse new Directors, that the old disapproved, cen∣sured,
stigmatized, and reversed not only the measures of their pre∣decessors
but even their own. How and from whence this sudden
light fell on the India-House, and kindled in the minds of the
Directors, when their power was just expiring, such a fervour
for justice, is less important, than it is difficult to explain.</P>
<P>The more points,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A brief state of facts.</NOTE> in which the subject of Tanjore is viewed,

1775 appear.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mahommed Ali possessed the only sove∣reign power</NOTE> It has been already proved, beyond the power of a
just reply, that Mahommed Ali possessed the only sovereign authority
in the Carnatic. That the Company, neither by charter nor even
by usurpation, either could possess, or even pretended to hold any
sovereignty in that country. That in no war, which, either the
disobedience or ambition of the Nabob's vassals might kindle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Company had no right to appear as principals.</NOTE> or
render absolutely necessary, the Company had any right to appear,
as principals. That, by their connection with Mahommed Ali, their
interest in the security of his government, they thought themselves
<PB N="232" REF="247"/>
bound in duty to appear as his allies, when he found himself
obliged to take the field against foreign invaders or refractory
subjects.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bound to appear as his all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</NOTE> That the servants of the Company abroad never claimed
any other title to themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They never claimed any other title.</NOTE> than that of allies, nor to their troops
but that of auxiliaries to the government of the Carnatic. That,
in the two expeditions against Tanjore, the Presidency had been uni∣formly
careful to mention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D clare them∣selves auxili∣aries.</NOTE> in almost all their minutes on the sub∣ject,
that their forces were only auxiliaries in the Nabob's army.
That, as they had laid no claim to the war, as their own, they had
most solemnly relinquished every idea of having any right to the
making of peace. That, in the first expedition, they were so sen∣sible
of their own want of every right to interfere, they acquiesced
in a treaty, which they declared to be insecure; and withdrew their
troops from the walls of Tanjore, when a practicable breach was
made. That, when the expedition of 1773 was undertaken, the
Governor and Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Disavows every claim to conquest.</NOTE> who were vested with definitive powers rela∣tive
to all agreements with Indian princes, disavowed every claim to
any conquest, that might be made. That having accordingly as∣sisted
the Nabob in making a conquest, that conquest was solemnly
and irrevocably vested in that prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conquest <HI>irrevocable</HI> by them.</NOTE> as the acknowldged principal
in the war. That, when a territory is acquired in a regular and
solemn war, by any power, that power has the most decided, the
most indisputable and irreversible title to that conquest, by the law
of nature and nations. That, by the same law, both the victor and
his assigns are to be defended in the possession of whatever he has
taken from his enemies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plato de Leg. lib. i. Arislot. de Repub. vii. cap. 5. Grot. lib. iii. cap. 6. sect. 2 Jib. i. cap. 4. Xenophoa. de Inst. Cyr. lib.

of territories acquired, by the rights of conquest, such interference
would amount to actual hostilities, and place the injuring party in a
state of war with the party injured. That, should the subjects of

any other power, under any pretence whatsoever, seize or alter the
possession of any conquest, such power is bound by the law of na∣ture

of his undoubted and acknowledged rights.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Company pu∣nishable for invading that right, &amp;c.</NOTE> That, should

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Restoration of Tanjore examined.</HEAD>
<P>THE East India Company, ever since their first institution,
had industriously,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of the secrecy of the Company. Jealousy of Commerce.</NOTE> and, till lately, very successfully, covered
their transactions with a veil of secrecy; which few had the curio∣sity,
and fewer still the means to penetrate. This maxim of mys∣tery
naturally sprung from the jealous principles of commerce,
which hopes to preclude rivals, by a suppression of its profits. When
states and kingdoms, by scarcely accountable revolutions, came un∣der
the management of the Company, the silence, which had been
thought necessary for preserving commercial advantages, was trans∣ferred
to a still more necessary business,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concealment of plunder.</NOTE> the concealment of plunder.
The principal servants, having fabricated fortunes under a myste∣rious
cloud, had an interest in remaining quiet; and the fear of dis∣mission,
and consequently of ruin, deterred those in inferior stations
from divulging that small portion of the delinquency of their supe∣riors,
which fell within their knowledge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why their secrets were so well kept.</NOTE> Besides, the enviable
situation of tyranny and pillage, was a prize in the wheel, into
which they had thrown their own lots; and even a kind of mis∣placed
honour sometimes prevented men of principle from detecting
peculation, injustice, and vice; to avoid the disgrace, which the
world has, perhaps injudiciously, annexed to the character of an
informer.</P>
<P>The distance of the scene of iniquity naturally diminished the im∣pression
made by vague reports of crimes;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The distance of the scene of iniquity.</NOTE> and the national curio∣sity,
<PB N="235" REF="250"/>
with regard to the affairs of the East, was lessened by the
national aversion to a monopoly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aversion of the nation to their mono∣poly.</NOTE> which precludes the people at large
from their natural rights to universal commerce. The plunder of
Asia, in a manner, brought the first authentic accounts of Asiatic
revolutions to Europe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vanity of their ser∣vants,</NOTE> Mankind began to enquire, “how, and
whence such splendor came;” and when they saw, that persons of
mean parts had amassed great and sudden riches, they naturally
suspected, that rapacity, injustice and tyranny had supplied their
want of talents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and their ostentation, create suspi∣cions.</NOTE> Instead of prudently brooding over their ill-got
hoards, the Company's servants, upon their return from their pro∣vinces,
flew in the face of nobility itself; rivalled it in the possession
of lands, outstripped it in dissipation, oftentation, and luxury; and
sometimes overcame it in parliamentary influence. Jealousy and
resentment, which are too often more powerful passions, than a de∣sire
of redressing the injured, excited a degree of revenge. Some
men of talents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a disco∣very was made.</NOTE> who precipitately thought, that national indigna∣tion
might produce national justice, unveiled some of the fountains
of corruption in the East. Their discoveries were heard with atten∣tion
by the nation; but a benumbed state seconded not the ardour
of the people, for restoring public honour, by exhibiting examples
of public justice.</P>
<P>An enquiry into abuses,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enquiries not followed by punishment,</NOTE> when it is not followed by animadver∣sion
and punishment, instead of repressing vice, produces a larger
crop of delinquency.<NOTE PLACE="marg">encourage crimes.</NOTE> The Company's servants in the East, instead
of “shortening their hands from vice,” if an Asiatic expression may
be used, on an Asiatic subject, “lengthened” them to every act of
insolence and oppression.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Direc∣tors fly in the face of the state.</NOTE> Their masters in the West, finding that
the storm, which threatened the mismanagements of the Company,
had dissipated without falling, slew in the face of a state, which,
from its inactivity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fear of punishment being remov∣ed, rancour returned.</NOTE> they had great reason to despise. When the
fear of future punishment was removed, former rancour and ani∣mosity

peculations of their servants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They reverse the decisions of their pre∣decessors, &amp;c.</NOTE> a Court of Directors, not only re∣versed
the most solemn and decisive measures of their predecessors
in office, but invaded and frustrated the most sacred engagements
of the state. Some writers of spirit and information took arms in
the cause of humanity and justice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are arraigned at the public tribunal.</NOTE> They dragged forth the delin∣quents
from the cloud, in which they had involved themselves, and
brought them bound to the tribunal of the public. The public,
before sentence was passed, shewed a laudable inclination to hear
the culprits, in their own defence.</P>
<P>The Court of Directors undertook this defence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They under∣take their own defence.</NOTE> with an appear∣ance
of conviction or their own integrity and the rectitude of their
measures; a circumstance calculated to impose upon the world.
In a public advertisement<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">March 26th, 1777.</NOTE>, they assured their constituents and the
nation at large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Promise to re∣sute the charges, or to quit their office.</NOTE> “That from the materials before them, they had
not the least doubt of refuting the heavy charges brought against
them, which, could they be proved, would not only render <HI>them</HI>
unfit to conduct the affairs of the Company, but utterly unworthy
of every degree of public trust and confidence.” To support
this precipitate declaration, they proceeded to what they called a
defence of their conduct. But, when they ought to have stated
their case in the plain and simple garb which conscious integrity
and truth always chuse and love,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They over∣whelm and frighten the public with enormous volumes of re∣cords.</NOTE> they overwhelmed and frightened
the nation, with many enormous volumes, printed from the heavy
and contradictory records of the Company. The Directors, by this
clumsy artifice, hoped, perhaps, to create a general disgust against a
subject,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hope to dis∣gust the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the subject.</NOTE> which few had abilities and scarcely any the perseverance to
expiscate, in such a confused mass. Under the cover of a dull and
torpid publication, they thought they had secured a safe retreat from
further censure. This Asiatic mud-fort formed of consultations,

from those facts, contained in the preceding pages, and founded
<PB N="250" REF="265"/>
chiefly on the authority of the papers published by the Directors, in

the public.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A narrative of succeeding transactions.</NOTE> But the carrying forward a concise narrative of transac∣tions
to the restoration of Tanjore, may not be disagreeable to some
readers. In the year 1772, the mismanagements of the Company
abroad, but chiefly their pecuniary distresses at home, reached the
ears of the nation, and rouzed, in some degree, the attention of
government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observations on parliamen∣tary enquiries.</NOTE> The matter, when set afloat in parliament, was tossed
and tumbled, with all that vehemence and indecision, which are the
characteristics of numerous assemblies. A subject rude and without
form, extensive in itself, and rendered still more intricate and per∣plexed,
by those who dreaded an enquiry, was not likely to receive
much light or benefit, from the desultory examination of men averse
to application and labour. Committees were appointed to interrogate
witnesses, and to examine records. Much time was lost, but little
information gained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A bill for the regulation of India affairs.</NOTE> A bill was, at length, introduced and passed,
which was so much amended in its progress, that it fell short of its
object. A change made in the government of Bengal rendered that
opulent province less subject than formerly to the controul of the
Court of Directors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The COAST left <HI>clear</HI> to the Directors.</NOTE> But the less fortunate coast of Coromandel was
left as a field for the exercise of their talents, and the exertion of
their authority.</P>
<P>The principal discovery made by the Committees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A permanency given to the members of that court,</NOTE> who examined
the affairs of India, was, in all appearance, conveyed to them, by
some members of the Court of Directors, who were displeased, at
the short duration of their own power. They represented, that the
mismanagements abroad arose chiefly, from that disregard to the or∣ders
sent from home, which had been naturally encouraged, by those
sluctuations in men and opinions, which had sprung from a frequent
choice of Directors. To give permanency to the power of Directors,
was the only way to secure the obedience of Presidencies. This sug∣gestion
was seized with eagerness, by men averse to the labour of an
<PB N="251" REF="266"/>
annual exertion of influence. Vainly imagining that gratitude was
a stronger passion than fear, they hoped to gain by a favour, persons
whom that very favour placed beyond their controul. The perma∣nency
so much recommended and requested was accordingly given
to the Court of Directors;<NOTE PLACE="marg">which, instead of amending, perpetuates error and ab∣sordity.</NOTE> but, instead of producing amendment, it
served to confirm, and perpetuate the old system, with all its errors
and absurdity. The Court became, at once, independent of Go∣vernment
and the Proprietors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proprie∣tors reduced to cyphers.</NOTE> The latter were, in fact, reduced to
mere cyphers, though they were still amused, with the yearly mockery
of voting for six Directors; who had actually secured their election,
by an agreement with the eighteen brethren, whom they had left
behind the bar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Directors elect them∣selves.</NOTE> the year before. Thus the Directors themselves, like
the parliament of Paris, became their own electors; whilst an im∣provident
Government and an ill-used Proprietary were left specta∣tors
of measures, which they could not prevent, and which were too
troublesome to be reversed.</P>
<P>The Court feeling their own independence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They think of turning their independence to advantage.</NOTE> began to think of the
means of turning it to the best advantage. The law, which had
rendered them perpetual dictators, had unluckily deprived them of
Bengal, their best and most desireable province. On the Coast, some
advantages and much resentment still remained.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanjore pro∣mises that ad∣vantage.</NOTE> A conquest had
been made of an opulent province, under the auspices of a governor,
who, having come by accident to the chair, had not, perhaps, of∣fered
the customary <HI>Nazir,</HI> to his superiors. Mahommed Ali, though
persecuted by servants, had not yet felt the heavy hand of the mas∣ters,
to correct him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob deli∣vered by go∣vernment into their hands.</NOTE> for his defection to the state. The state, with
peculiar respect to the Company, had delivered the victim into their
hands; but the hurry arising from a parliamentary enquiry, had hi∣therto
prevented the building of the altar, on which the sacrifice was
to be made.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They prepare to make a sacrifice of the victim.</NOTE> A new governor for Madras, to officiate as high-priest,

The intrigues of Leadenhall-Street are frequently too dark to be
traced, and are seldom worth the labour of detection. The Court of
Directors having,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new go∣vernor.</NOTE> by a small majority, nominated a governor for Fort
St. George, in the beginning of 1775, their nomination was reversed
by the Proprietors, by a still smaller superiority of votes. The object
of the Company's choice was Lord Pigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Pigot.</NOTE> who, before he attained
the rank of an Irish Baron, had managed the affairs of the Compa∣ny,
for some years, as their President, on the coast of Coromandel.
Such parts of the conduct of Mr. Pigot, in that station, as suited the
public eye, have been explained, with the strictest impartiality, in
the preceding part of this work. Other things we have chosen to
leave in the shade,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An indul∣gence to be shewn to the dead.</NOTE> from a respect due to the dead. Besides,
the misfortunes, which attended the latter part of Lord Pigot's life,
though they cannot justify his measures, claim an indulgence, against
the severity of animadversion. But an undeviating attention to such
truths, as are absolutely necessary to explain our subject, must super∣sede
every other consideration.</P>
<P>Mr. Pigot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rise of Lord Pigot.</NOTE> having returned to Europe, soon after the conclu∣sion

probably suggested this resolution to his Lordship. The treaty of
1762, which had settled money-matters between the Nabob of Ar∣cot

the favourite measure of his former government. The vague
reports, concerning the deprivation of the Rajah, had been con∣firmed
to his Lordship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mondeo∣Kistna wries a letter.</NOTE> by a letter from Moodoo-Kistna, a Dubash,
whose steady friendship had remained unimpaired, during an absence of

many years. This faithful Dubash, having rented lands to a very
considerable amount from Tulja-jî<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original Papers, vol. iii. p. 124.</NOTE>, lamented the fall of that
Rajah, with all the sincerity of a grateful tenant. In the warmth
of his zeal, he probably represented to his noble friend, the case of
“that monarch” in a very different light, from that established,

Moodoo-Kistna probably added those reports of the cruelties of
the Nabob, which were industriously circulated in the beginning of
1775, in Leadenhall-Street. It was alleged that Tulja-jî was closely
confined in a dungeon at Tanjore; and, at the same time, that
he was in irons at Tritchinopoly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rajah in a <HI>dungeon</HI> at Tanjore and in <HI>irons</HI> at Tritchinopo∣ly at the same time.</NOTE> Though these two stories could
not possibly be true, they were both believed, by some tender-hearted
persons in the India-house; if their own allegations deserve any
credit. Some feeling clerks in office dissolved into tears, upon
hearing the melancholy tale;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clerks in the India-house in tears.</NOTE> and even a few Directors, at the
weekly feast in the London Tavern, were observed to abstain from
the delicacies of the Company's table,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Direc∣tors abstain from their food.</NOTE> when they heard the sad re∣verse
of fallen MAJESTY. Lord Pigot himself, transferring all his
friendship for Pretaupa, to the unfortunate Tulja-jî, resolved to pass
immediately to Asia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Pigot resolves to pass into Asia.</NOTE> to save the life of the devoted Rajah, from
the dagger of Mahommed Ali. That hardened prince, it had been
found by experience, was capable of any injustice. Though he had
appointed Lord Pigot his agent in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob had neglected to remit a sala∣ry.</NOTE> much of the salary
annexed to the office remained unpaid. The Nabob, it seems, had
sheltered himself under the trite maxim, “that no reward ought
to be given, where no service is performed;” and had conse∣quently
been UNPARDONABLY negligent, in his remittances.</P>
<P>Though a majority of the Court of Directors had voted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Lord∣ship's party pursue their victory.</NOTE> for an∣other
Governor, they were not so much attached to their former
<PB N="254" REF="269"/>
choice, as to carry their resentment to any steady opposition to the
measures proposed, by the noble Lord recommended, by their con∣stituents.
The party, who had opposed the nomination of Mr.
Rumbold, acquired credit and consequently influence, by the deci∣sion
of the Proprietors, in favour of Lord Pigot. The event of the
contest brought to the latter all the advantages, derived from victo∣ry.
A new light fell upon the India-house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new light falls on the India-house.</NOTE> which laid open at
one view, to the Directors, all their own negligences and the errors
of their predecessors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An India go∣vernment, without a revolution contemptible.</NOTE> The obtaining or enjoying a government in
India, without the splendour of some great revolution, was an ob∣ject
beneath the dignity of a noble person, who had already made a
distinguished figure, in the affairs of the East. The example of
another Lord, who had new-modelled the tenure of the Company in
Bengal, was an inducement to emulation, though not an object of
jealousy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gratitude to the Rajah.</NOTE> The distress of Tulja-jî, and the merits of his father,
brought the softer feelings of pity and gratitude to the aid of the
more sturdy passion of ambition.</P>
<P>The Nabob of Arcot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resentment to the Na∣bob.</NOTE> though he had uniformly fulfilled his engage∣ments
to the Company, had, in his attention to friends in the East,
neglected those in the West. He had besides, been sufficiently hardy
to have appealed to a Government, who had suffered a signal defeat,
in the contest, which had given a new governor to Fort St. George.
These reasons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Lord∣ship's party arbiters of the fate of the Carnatic.</NOTE> combining themselves with the wishes of a success∣ful
opposition in the India-House, left Lord Pigot and his party the
arbiters of the fate of the Carnatic. Orders and instructions were
framed, less consistent with the former conduct of the Directors, than
suitable to their present views. These views were so powerful, in
their effect, that, in the pursuit of them, all regard to matter of fact,
as well as to justice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal begets absurdity and presumption.</NOTE> was overlooked. The orders of the Court of
Directors, for removing Mr. Wynch and appointing Lord Pigot, to∣gether
<PB N="255" REF="270"/>
with the commission to the latter, we may safely affirm, are
not to be paralleled, in the records of any body of men vested with
authority.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ignorance, which only merits con∣tempt, raises indignation.</NOTE> Ignorance, which by itself only merits contempt, as∣sumes,
in those papers, a presumptuous form, which might justify
indignation, were the authors worthy of a passion of any dignity.
In every sentence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Directors contradict fact, and their own records.</NOTE> nay in every line, the Directors not only contra∣dict
matter of fact, but fly in the face of their own records, with a
total want of caution, which is liable to detection, and consequently
must meet with disgrace, and ought to suffer punishment. The facts,
which we have established, by incontrovertible evidence, in the preced∣ing
pages, are diametrically opposite to all the allegations contained
in the orders of April the 12th 1775.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are wrong, or have imposed on the public.</NOTE> If the Directors will chuse to
deny this truth, they must own, that they have imposed SPURIOUS
RECORDS on the world, in the volumes, which they have published in
their own defence.</P>
<P>To pursue these orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders exa∣mined.</NOTE> through all their mazes of absurdity and
ignorance, would be a laborious and undignified task. We shall,
however, examine briefly the most material; though to answer ill∣founded
allegations, may give them a consequence, which they do
not deserve “We have been uniform in our orders,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pre∣tended uni∣formity stated.</NOTE> say the Di∣rectors
of 1775, “prohibiting our servants from extending the ter∣ritories
of the Company and the Nabob<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. IX. p. 145. Paragraph 27.</NOTE>.” But the reduction of
Tanjore was not extending the Nabob's territories.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Facts, argu∣ments and reasons.</NOTE> That country
was already in the heart of his dominions, defended by his resources
and arms, subject, under certain stipulations, to his government,
liable to fall as a forfeiture into his hands, upon the disobedience of
its Rajah, and in every respect a part of the Carnatic. The true
meaning of former orders, against enlarging territories, was to cir∣cumscribe
the extent of country to be defended, and to limit the ex∣pence
of defence. The reduction of Tanjore, instead of increasing
<PB N="256" REF="271"/>
the present expence, was providing against a future waste. It was
the removing an internal enemy, and the obtaining resources against
foreign invaders. Besides, the treaty of 1762 was superior, in au∣thority,
to any orders from the Court of Directors, could even these
orders be construed to extend to territories, within the limits and go∣vernment
of the Carnatic. The Rajah had broke that treaty. The
Company were bound to assist the Nabob. A war was begun, which
terminated in a conquest. That conquest vested an indefeasible right
to the territory of Tanjore, in the Nabob; and the Company's or∣ders
could not affect that right, without violating the law of nature
and nations, the guarantee of their sovereign, and the tenure, by
which they held their own settlements on the coast.</P>
<P>“We can by no means allow,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Directors convicted of a misrepresen∣tation of facts from their own records.</NOTE> say the Directors, “that you were
warranted in recurring to arms, so long as the king of Tanjore's
vackeel declared himself ready and willing to settle affairs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. IX. p. 146, para∣graph
31.</NOTE>.”
The Directors allude to the expedition of 1771, of which they
themselves had approved in the most ample and solemn manner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide public thanks to Mr. Du Prè for
every part of his conduct, during his govern∣ment,
especially for his supporting the rights
of the Nabob of Arcot. Aug. 177<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.
They aver, that the Rajah's vackeel was ready and willing to settle
affairs. But it appears, from the papers which they have published,
in their own defence, “that the Nabob had opened his demand to
the Tanjore vackeel. But that the vackeel declared, he had no
powers to accommodate the matter<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXII. p. 726.</NOTE>.” How could the vackeel
have powers, when his master meant nothing less, than a reasonable
accommodation<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 718. 72.</NOTE>? The Directors have since owned in their defence,
that Tulja-jî “used delays, procrastinations and evasions, in order to
waste the time, till the setting in of the rains and the rising of the
monsoon should deprive the Nabob and the English of the power
<PB N="257" REF="272"/>
of the power of military compulsion, for the season.” What are
we to think of the morality of men, who advance falsehoods for
facts? what of their knowledge, when they are ignorant of the
very records, which they published in their own defence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The noted orders of April 12th 1775,
seem to confound together men and things,
seasons and years, treaties and agreements, in
one confused mass.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>The Directors affirm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are convicted of misrepresent∣ing other facts.</NOTE> in their orders for the restoration of Tan∣jore
to the Rajah, that it was, at the <HI>request</HI> of the Nabob and Pre∣taupa
Sing, that the Presidency became guarantees to the treaty of
1762<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. IX. p. 153.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>True</HI> state of the matter.</NOTE> But we have already shewn, that the treaty was forced on
the Nabob. That Mr. Pigot framed it without his consent. That
he seized the Nabob's chop, and put it, with his own hand, to the
paper<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 127.</NOTE>; and that even Pretaupa Sing would have been glad to fore∣go
the benefit of that treaty, could he have retained the money, ex∣pended
in the course of the negociation<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">P. 128.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are a∣gain convict∣ed.</NOTE> The reduction of Tan∣jore,
say the intelligent Directors, was “a direct violation of the
treaty of 1762, and contrary to our repeated instructions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. IX. p. 153.</NOTE>.”
The first is an extraordinary position in politics, and worthy of the
wisdom of a body, who dispose of kingdoms, with the dash of a
pen. Why are treaties formed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Facts, argu∣ments and reasons.</NOTE> but to be equally binding on the
parties? Had not the Rajah broken that treaty, and forced the gua∣rantees
to take up arms against him? Did not a regular and solemn
war commence, which ended in another treaty, in which the former
was not so much as mentioned? Does not war, according to the law
of nations and the universal consent of mankind, extinguish all
prior treaties<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. XXII. p. 725.</NOTE>? Can any treaties, established before a rupture, re∣cover
their former force, without being named, in the agreement,
between the contending parties, which terminates the rupture?
Would the Directors hold it forth, as a maxim, that an agreement
<PB N="258" REF="273"/>
between a superior and his vassal is binding on the former, and not
on the latter? If neither Pretaupa Sing nor his son were bound, by
the treaty of 1762, or amenable to animadversion, for a breach of
it, why was the treaty sent to Tanjore, to be confirmed by the signa∣ture
and oath of the Rajah? And if the Rajah was not accountable
for deviating from the treaty, what meaning do the Directors annex
to the Company's guarantee, who solemnly promised to assist the party,
who should adhere to the treaty, against the party failing to adhere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Treaty Sept. 20th, 1762.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>“We have determined,”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Directors contradict themselves.</NOTE> say the Directors, “to replace the king
of Tanjore on the <HI>throne of his ancestors,</HI> upon certain terms and
conditions, for the mutual benefit of himself and the Company,
without infringing the rights of Mahmud Ally Khan, Nabob of the
Carnatic<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Orders, pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 5. No. IX. p. 154.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mock restoration of the Rajah.</NOTE> This self-contradicting paragraph must be separated,
to be exposed. But how have the Directors restored their mock-monarch
to his throne? They insist, that he shall admit a garrison of
their troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They seize his revenues.</NOTE> into his capital<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. That he shall assign revenues to the
Company sufficient for the maintenance of the said troops, and for
providing military stores<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. That, “if the expence of the garrison
shall exceed the amount of the revenues so assigned, then the <HI>king</HI>
of Tanjore shall make good the deficiency<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Repair his forts at <HI>his</HI> expence, yet seize them for <HI>themselves.</HI></NOTE> That all repairs of

by the <HI>king,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They strip their monarch of all his pre∣rogative.</NOTE> without the concurrence of the Company<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 155.</NOTE>.
That the number of native guards, necessary for supporting the

and Council of Fort St. George, and not exceeded nor aug∣mented,
by the <HI>king,</HI> on any account or pretence whatever<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE>. Such
is the manner, in which the East India Company restore a king “to
<PB N="259" REF="274"/>
the throne of his ancestors!” They place a military force in his
capital, make an indefinite demand on his revenues, preclude him
from the prerogative of every SOVEREIGN, to make any treaty, and
limit the number of guards for his person:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet make “no dimini∣nution of his authority.”</NOTE> yet these very men de∣clare,
in the same page<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. IX. p. 154.</NOTE>, “that no diminution of his authority is
intended by them!” The division of Poland, which lately astonished
Europe, was not half so barefaced a perversion of the established
laws of nature and nations, as the pretended restoration, made by a
trading society, under the eye of a state of which they are subjects.</P>
<P>The Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They resolve not to “in∣fringe the rights of the Nabob.”</NOTE> in the paragraph just cited, say, “That they had
determined to replace the King of Tanjore on the throne of his
ancestors, without infringing the rights of Mahmud Ally Khan,
Nabob of the Carnatic.” How often must we repeat facts, to
convict such men of ignorance, or wilful deception! It has been
proved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are again con∣victed, by matter of fact.</NOTE> by the most incontestible evidence, that neither the Rajah,
nor his ancestors, possessed the title, rights, or independence of roy∣alty.
That the first of the race was a MARATTA PLUNDERER,
who seized Tanjore, by perfidy, about eighty years ago, and ex∣pelled
the hereditary Naig. That Tanjore, before it was seized by
that Maratta, was subject to the Mogul empire. That the Nabob of
the Carnatic, in vindication of the right of his Sovereign to Tan∣jore,
reduced the son of the Maratta to a total dependence on the
Nabobship of Arcot. That the tribute of Tanjore was settled at the
annual sum of thirty lacks of rupees; and that the Naig of that
country was so far from arrogating to himself the appellation of
King, that he, for the first time, received the title of Rajah, from
his SOVEREIGN, the Mogul<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide passim. chap. iii. p. 56, 57, 58, 59,

It reminds us of the answer of a late great statesman, who, when

“vigorous measures with MODERATION.”<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ridicule in making a se∣rious reply to nonsense.</NOTE> There is a degree of

of Mahommed Ali infringed, by depriving him of a country, which
fell under his government, by a regular conquest, in a solemn, just
and necessary war? Was not Tanjore a province of the Mogul em∣pire,
depending and paying tribute to the Nabob of the Carnatic,
long before the Company extended their views beyond the sands of
Madras?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion of their infringe∣ments, from their own records.</NOTE> Was not the Rajah often punished, and sometimes deprived,
when he failed in the performance of his duty, as a vassal to the
Nabob of the Carnatic? Did not the Company themselves, in the
treaty of 1762, acknowledge, in the most solemn manner, the an∣cient
dependence of Tanjore on the Carnatic, whilst they settled the
amount of the future tribute? Did that treaty comprehend any thing
relative to Tanjore, except the mere adjustment of accounts and the
settlement of the peishcush, to be annually paid by the Rajah? Did
it preclude, or even mention, the acknowledged and undoubted <HI>con∣stitutional
rights</HI> of the Carnatic, to the Rajah's assistance, in time of
war? Did the Rajah give that assistance? On the contrary, did he not
aid the enemy of the Carnatic and English with money and provi∣sions?
Was not a former Court of Directors so sensible of the Ra∣jah's
having broken every tie, which bound him to his superior,
that they sent positive orders, the 17th of March, 1769, to bring
him to a severe account for his conduct; and to assist the Nabob
against him, in a manner suitable to the justice of his claims, and the
dignity of his government?</P>
<P>Did the Rajah of Tanjore adhere to the treaty of 1762,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Recapitula∣tion from the records of the Directors continued.</NOTE> of which
the Company were the pledged guarantees? Did he not, for two
years, prior to the expedition of 1771, with-hold the stipulated
<PB N="261" REF="276"/>
tribute? Did he not kindle a war, in the heart of the Carnatic, by
invading its vassals and dependents? Did he pay any attention to the
friendly interference of the Presidency, to prevent a rupture be∣tween
him and the Nabob? On the contrary, did he not disregard
the guarantee of the Company; and force their servants, from self-preservation,
as well as in support of the rights of the Nabob, to
take the field? Did he not make treaties with foreign powers, send
bribes to foreign states, to invade the territories of his superior, after
a solemn treaty had been settled between him and the Nabob? Did
he not form connections with other European Companies, alienate
to them a part of his country, and receive their aid, to support him
against his superior, and the English Company? Was not a second
expedition undertaken against his capital, in which the Company's
troops were declared, by the Presidency, to be only auxiliaries? Did
not the Presidency of Fort St. George, under the seal of the Com∣pany,
enter into an eventual agreement, that Tanjore should re∣main
in the hands of the Nabob, in case of conquest? Did not that
conquest take place, and give the Nabob, as PRINCIPAL in the war,
a decisive and incontestible title to Tanjore?</P>
<P>Did not the Nabob fulfil ALL his stipulations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The black catalogue of their acts of injustice fur∣ther conti∣nued.</NOTE> relative to Tanjore,
with the Presidency? Did he not defray the whole expences of the
expedition, pay the captors for their right to the plunder of the
place, advance seven lacks of pagodas, as a present to the army?
Did he not, upon the reduction of Tanjore, pay all the Rajah's
debts to the English and others? Did he not redeem those districts
of the province of Tanjore, which the Rajah had alienated, sold or
mortgaged to the Dutch at Nagore, to the Danes near Tranquebar,
and to the French, round their settlement at Carical? Did he not
enter into regular treaties with those three nations, under the sanc∣tion
of the Plenipotentiary of the King of Great Britain, and the
Representatives of the East India Company at Madras? Was not the
<PB N="262" REF="277"/>
Nabob obliged to borrow money, to discharge all those engagements,
from the inhabitants of Madras, and the country bankers, or sou∣cars?
Was not the country of Tanjore the Nabob's right, by a kind
of purchase, as well as by forfeiture and conquest? Have not the
Company, though only auxiliaries, or rather <HI>mercenaries</HI> in the war,
deprived the PRINCIPAL in that war of his conquest, in breach of
every law, which binds public societies? And do a set of Directors
presume to affirm, in the face of the world, that they have restored
Tanjore, “without infringing the RIGHTS of Mahommed Ali?”</P>
<P>The manner in which this flagrant injustice was committed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their bare∣faced con∣duct.</NOTE> was
scarcely less barefaced, than the presumption of defending such a
a breach of the faith of treaties, before an insulted Public. We have
already shewn, that the Court of Directors, after having the most
full and regular information of the motives, which induced the Pre∣sidency
to assist the Nabob against the Rajah in 1771,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They approve of the expedi∣tion of 1771;</NOTE> approved of
that measure, in the most ample manner<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Du Prè's Vindication, last page.</NOTE>. That the same Court
had received,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and by their silence ap∣prove of that of 1773.</NOTE> on the 26th of March, 1774<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rous's Appendix, No. XXVII. p. 1361.
1364. 1366.</NOTE>, three weeks before
the latter ships of the season sailed, intelligence of the taking of
Tanjore, with the whole materials relative to the expedition; but
that they remained totally silent. That, in the course of the summer
1774, they received several dispatches relative to the same subject,
and the subsequent measures, which arose from the same transaction.
That during the winter of 1774, and for more than two months of
1775, they observed the same mysterious silence, which seemed to
imply a thorough approbation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Measures re∣lative to Tan∣jore origina∣ted early in 1775.</NOTE> at least a tacit consent. The truth is,
the resolution relative to the restoration of Tanjore, originated in the
appointment of Lord Pigot to the government of Madras. Though the
restoration was the principal motive, which induced his Lordship to
brave the dangers of a long voyage, and the diseases of a hot cli∣mate,
<PB N="263" REF="278"/>
at an advanced period of life, the measure was so STRONG,
that he proceeded with extreme caution. Having opened his mind
to the Chairman and Deputy-chairman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cautious de∣velopement of that mea∣sure.</NOTE> men of distinguished PUBLIC
VIRTUE, he awakened the feelings of humanity, for decayed
MAJESTY, in their sympathetic bosoms. But, notwithstanding this
thaw in the breasts of the two leaders, it was still feared, that some
more hardened Directors, would revolt at an absolute restoration.
It was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They first propose to <HI>intercede</HI> with the Nabob.</NOTE> therefore, only proposed, at first, to intercede with the Na∣bob,
for the assignment of a proper allowance, for the maintenance

who would not approve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nabob always willing to give a handsome establishment to Tula-ji.</NOTE> who would not applaud the measure? The
Nabob has always been, he still continues, willing to grant a Jaghire, a

person, or to gratify his vanity. When the country was in the possession
of his superior,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His humanity to that Rajah, when in his hands.</NOTE> Tulja-jî was not only treated with humanity, but with an
almost unbounded generosity, which was denied nothing but the power
of doing harm. He remained within his palace, which was surround∣ed
with gardens of pleasure, more than a mile in circumference, with
his family, women, relations, and friends. Not a person belonging
to the Nabob ever entered the gates, not one belonging to the Rajah
was ever refused admittance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who passed his time in festivity,</NOTE> The soldiers, who mounted guard
without, were instructed to behave themselves as his servants; with∣in
there was a perpetual scene of festivity and joy, dancing, piping,
and every demonstration of happiness. No sums were refused to ad∣minister
to the pleasures of the Rajah, none to satisfy his most ex∣travagant
follies. Freed from the weight of a government, which
had been too heavy for the weak shoulders of a man devoted to vice
and debauchery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and in intem∣perate plea∣sures.</NOTE> he resigned himself to those intemperate pleasures,
which had been disturbed before by his ungovernable ambition and

unbridled folly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All these particulars are well known, and,

<P>Your Highness has, from the beginning shewed kindness towards me, and on my part, as a means to increase your favour, I was hear∣tily disposed to act agreeably to your pleasure, but some of my servants, by many specious rea∣sons to which I gave ear, prevailed upon me to act in a different manner, and so became guilty of a great fault, the consequences of which I now feel. Your Highness, in consideration of the friendship which subsisted between you and the deceased Maha Rajah, has been pleased to pardon my fault, and to send a letter to Nabob Madaur ul Mulk Bahauder, the contents of which he explained to me word by word, in which letter you have been pleased to signify very particularly your intention to protect me at all events, which did me great honour. It is now my resolution to act in every respect con∣formably to your Highness's pleasure, that I may merit an increase of your favour from you day by day; your Highness is more dear to me in my esteem than the deceased Maha Rajah was, for your Highness has manifested a greater degree of kindness than he ever did. When children are in fault, their parents should for∣give them, and restore them to favour; my ho∣nour, and every thing that is dear to me are in your Highness's hands.</P>
<P><HI>Translation of a Letter from Mahommed Nagif Cawn, dated 1st Jummaudalouwell</HI> 1189</P>
<P>Hegira, received on the 4th.</P>
<P>I have received the favour of your Highness's gracious letter dated the 29th Rabbasauney, wherein your Highness is pleased to mention, that your enemies report that the Rajah Tul∣jagee and his wife killed themselves; and that I should particularly inform your Highness of the present situation of the Rajah, and all his family.</P>
<P>I am astonished at what your Highness men∣tions. This story was made by people who wanted something to talk about, and disturbers invent lies; no such thing has happened in the Rajah's family since the reduction of Tanjore, to give rise to any such report as disturbers have propagated: however, by the blessing of God and your Highness's favour, the Rajah, his mother, his father's other widow, his own two wives, his younger brother, his daughter and his son, were all in good health and spirits, be∣sides his relations, slaves both men and women, and his attendants, who are in house, are all very well. Of all the people who have been from the beginning in the Rajah's house, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has but one died, who was a relation, and above eighty years old; he was carried off four or five months ago, by a tedious sickness. This I informed your Highness of at the time it hap∣pened; all the other people are in good health and spirits, and Tuljagee often expresses his thanks to your Highness, and his satisfaction in his manner of living. The Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>car people who are at his gates, act entirely as his servants, except in taking care of the gates according to my order.</P></NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="280"/>
But no establishment, no jaghire, no guards could enable Tulja-jî
to gratify the humanity of old friends,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No compro∣mise will sa∣tisfy the Di∣rectors.</NOTE> or to gain the favour of
new. Besides the paltry sum of 400,000 l. promised as a present by
the Nabob, was too small an acknowledgment to the <HI>Honourable</HI>
Company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their reasons at large.</NOTE> whose troops had served him as auxiliaries in the reduc∣tion
of Tanjore. The Presidency, with a negligence not to be par∣doned,
had relinquished the conquest to the PRINCIPAL in the war.
The troops had received prize-money to a large amount, the civil
servants had not probably been <HI>unconcerned</HI> spectators of the scene;
but their worthy masters at home, had been entirely forgot. The
security, which the removal of an opulent enemy from the heart of
the Carnatic, was likely to procure for that country, would render
the COAST an unprofitable field, for the exertion of the talents of
the friends and relations of the Directors. Trade had been long
dead; and should emulation and war between princes, be also de∣stroyed,
writers and even governors might quit their posts. The
Carnatic was the only spot left by the legislature to the management
of the leaders of the Company; and as the soil is poor, it must
be <HI>cultivated,</HI> to yield any thing of a good harvest. An irritated
<PB N="266" REF="281"/>
Nabob, and a restored <HI>monarch,</HI> had a chance of creating an auction
for favour, which might be turned to a good account. Besides, it was
but equitable, at any rate, that as the State had got a <HI>Nabob</HI> on the
Coast, the Company should have a <HI>King</HI> to keep up “the balance
of power<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It has been observed in a late publication, that if interested views had influenced the late proceedings relative to Tanjore, the obvious arrangement would have been to support the Nabob, who had made large offers, public as well as private, and not the Rajah who was a mere prisoner stript of every resource, and consequently could have no favours to confer.</P>
<P>A free examination of measures, and not a dissection of party-misrepresentations, has been the object of our discussion. There might be an indelicacy, perhaps, in any illusions to a corrupt influence, when it points to individuals. But when a public body, such as the India Company, acts with so much seeming incon∣sistency and injustice, as to leave no explana∣tion of their conduct but upon grounds of un∣fair influence, the charge may be brought with more freedom, as being attended with pre∣sumptions to establish itself. The miscon∣duct of individuals may sometimes be excused, as proceeding more from error than design. But the same indulgence cannot be allowed to large societies of men; whose measures, from the greater variety of opinions upon which they are formed, must be considered as the re∣sult of a more poised and deliberate resolu∣tion.</P>
<P>To determine more clearly on the merits of the Court of Directors in this business, it is necessary to state a few facts, relative to the re∣spective situations of the Nabob and the Rajah at the time of transferring Tanjore to the latter.</P>
<P>1st, The Nabob has declared, and the de∣claration is known to be true, that, upon the reduction of Tanjore, he paid all the Rajah's debts to the English and others; and that he redeemed those districts of country, which the Rajah had sold or mortgaged to the Dutch. He, in the same manner, settled with the Danes about their possessions at Tranquebar, as likewise with the French about their settle∣ments of Carical. These are facts which can∣not be controverted; and regular treaties, un∣der the sanction of the Company, and that of the Plenipotentiary of Great Britain, were con∣cluded between the Nabob and those foreign powers, on the subject of their respective pos∣sessions in the Tanjore country.</P>
<P>2dly, But the disbursements of the Nabob, at that period, were not consined to those pur∣poses alone. Besides the payment of the Ra∣jah's debts, and the redemption of the districts which had been mortgaged, what was given as prize-money to the army, as well as the whole expence of a long campaign, must be taken into the account. All these together amounted to an immense sum; and the money was bor∣rowed, by the Nabob, from the inhabitants of Madras, and the country bankers or Soucârs, at a very high rate of interest.</P>
<P>The advocates of the Rajah have asserted, that these loans were only a political manoeuvre of the Nabob to get the property of the coun∣try into his own hands.</P>
<P>It is generally more easy to disprove the as∣sertions of party than to conquer their ob∣stinacy; for the same bold position continues often to be advanced, when there is not even a colour of probability, to support it. In the pre∣sent instance, this is evidently the case. If his adversaries speak truth, it was certainly a very extraordinary kind of policy in the Nabob, to borrow millions of Pagodas at an exorbitant in∣terest, if there was no occasion for the loan. It was not certainly by a policy like this, that he could have amassed the hidden stores, which he has been said to possess. But so far were the Nabob's finances from being in the flourish∣ing state represented by his enemies, that, long before the Tanjore orders arrived, and even before they were thought of in Leadenhall∣street, he was obliged, for want of money, to submit to the daily clamours and insults of his Madras creditors; and the whole power of the Presidency was denounced against him, unless he assigned his country to discharge their de∣mands.</P>
<P>It has been said, and perhaps not without some foundation, that the Nabob himself once told a <HI>certain</HI> India Governor, who was speak∣ing of his secret wealth, that there was but one way of convincing the English of that matter, and that he was <HI>ready,</HI> if the Company and their servants <HI>approved</HI> of it, to give the English Parliament that conviction, which was to lay before them his receipts and <HI>particular</HI> dis∣bursements since his accession to the Nabob∣ship. The officious Governor seemed startled at so unexpected a reply; and, for <HI>obvious</HI> reasons, no doubt, he was never heard to say any more upon that subject.</P>
<P>But to return to the public point in this af∣fair. It is certain, when the orders for the restoration of Tanjore arrived, that the revenues of the country, together with those of the Carnatic, were assigned, by orders and mortgage, to the Nabob's different cre∣ditors, and to the Soucârs of the country. This is the common manner in which the princes of India anticipate their revenues. They borrow money, through the Soucârs, up∣on assignments of the Government share of the crop and produce of the ground for the ensuing year; and it is wed known, how effectual is the validity of a Soucâr security to the posses∣sors of the lands. Even a conqueror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Orme upon Soucars.</NOTE> never attempts to invade or annu' it; as that would be destroying the very <HI>medium</HI> by which his conquest was to become useful to himself after∣wards. We are sorry to observe, however, that the very reverse of that conduct, which would have been observed by a conqueror, has taken place in the affair of Tanjore. The consequence has been, that the Nabob, who was reduced be∣fore to the utmost state of distress by his cre∣ditors, was not only deprived of the best part of his dominions, but his credit, in raising mo∣ney upon the part that was lest, was utterly destroyed. For who would lend him upon any assignments upon countries that might be wrested from him, in the same manner as Tan∣jore had been? On the contrary, the nume∣rous merchants and Soucârs, who attended at the restoration of Tanjore, saw that the only real security in the country was that of the Rajah, who had many advantages on his side. He, at that time, had not a shilling of debt; and, without being burdened with any of the expences of royalty, he was instantly put in possession of 800,000 l. a-year, out of which he only paid the Company 160,000 l. for their military charges. Beside all this income, the particular situation of his country, which se∣cured it against the incursions of an enemy, en∣abled the Rajah to anticipate his revenues for not only the ensuing year, but for <HI>years</HI> there∣after.</P>
<P>Thus, on the one hand, do we see the old and faithful ally of the Company, with whom their prosperity began, and who, for his services, was guaranteed by the treaty of Paris, ruited and deserted by those who ought to have sup∣ported him, and lest without money, credit, or resource; and that too at a time when he was loaded with a heavy debt of near<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nabob's Tanjore debts, lately consolidated, are near three millions, as appears by the Company's records.</NOTE>
<HI>four millions</HI> sterling to English subjects alone. But this is not all. Insult has been added to missortune; and, by an an uncommon wantonness of power, the Company have further charged that injured Prince with the pay and maintenance of those very troops whom they had employed in de∣priving him of his dominions. Oppressed and borne down by so many calamities, his Durbar became a scene of misery and distress. His army, having large arrears due to them, muti∣nied and surrounded his palace. His own life and the lives of his family were in danger. And nothing was to be heard, in every quarter, but the threats of a tumultuous soldiery, mingled with the clamours of creditors whom he could not satisfy, and the cries of subjects whom he could not relieve.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we see the Rajah, a man, who, so far from having ever rendered any ser∣vice to this country, has always proved its most determined and inveterate enemy; a man, who has long enjoyed, in the interior parts of the Carnatic, a perfect security derived from those wars which have ruined his superior, and in which much of the blood of Britain has been shed; a man, who never had an English gar∣rison in any of his forts, who paid not a shil∣ling towards our expences, and in whose good or bad fortune England has not an interest; and yet this very man, this Rajah, has been cherished by the Company's favour, exalted by their power, and now triumphs in the spoils of his lawful master and superior.</P>
<P>Such are the outlines of the measures which the Company have adopted, and of the conse∣quences which have ensued; and such is a saint sketch of the merits and pretensions of two men whom they have thought proper to treat in so very different a manner. Can we behold such a striking contrast of characters and fortunes, with∣out equal wonder and resentment? Can we think on the authors of so much undeserved injustice on the one hand, and ill-placed savour on the other, without an equal mixture of indignation and contempt? Or can we possibly give any but one reason for a conduct so diametrically opposite to every principle of policy and vir∣tue?</P>
<P>But the evil will cure itself. The Nabob's creditors for so immense a sum, feel their own distress, and know who are its authors. The effects of their distress extend, with their con∣nexions, to almost every corner of Great Bri∣tain. They are entitled to redress; and it is the opinion of the best lawyers, that they can force it from the contrivers and managers of the or∣ders for restoring Tanjore.</P>
<P>From a moment's survey of the genuine state of facts we have here given, it will be easy to determine, on whose side remained the power of procuring an unjust influence in the East, that of the Nabob or the Rajah. But, if future proofs are wanted, they may be found, perhaps, in the zeal and amazing exertions which the Rajah's <HI>virtues</HI> have been able to create for him, in reserve, in this country: while the cause of the Nabob, who has made the fortunes of thousands, both in his service and by his generosity, has hardly an advocate to stand up in his defence.</P>
<P>We will not, however, anticipate this sub∣ject; but hope that justice will be effectually rendered to the Nabob, that his creditors may be secured; and even that the Rajah himself, in∣stead of his present mock royalty, may be placed on such an establishment of security, as may be most suited to his real rappiness. In a word, we wish he may find the deputies of the India Company, in whose hands he now is, as faithful guardians of his life and honour, as he found that very Nabob, against whom he has been made to complain, but who, during his power over him, contrary to the custom of the East, saved not only his life, but left him undisturbed in his palace, with the most ample allowances for his support.</P></NOTE>.”</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="282"/>
These public-spirited motives, joined to that humane sympathy
for fallen MAJESTY, which such <HI>good subjects,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The most ob∣durate Directors begin to relent.</NOTE> as the Directors
<PB N="268" REF="283"/>
have always felt, wrought gradually a change in the most obdurate
Members of the Court. The orders, which we have partly exa∣mined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The orders penned by a ready scribe; yet a <HI>legal</HI> number of signatures not obtained.</NOTE>
were penned by a ready scribe, a clerk in the India-House,
under the inspection of Lord Pigot. But notwithstanding the
<PB N="269" REF="284"/>
strength of the argument, the acuteness of the reasoning and the
eloquence of the diction, they lay a fortnight on the table, before a
legal number of signatures could be obtained. The fate of a <HI>kingdom</HI>
hung,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lord Pigot threaten, to resign, and Mr. Harrison to go to Bath.</NOTE> at last, on the point of a moment. Lord Pigot threatened
to resign, Mr. Harrison was just retiring to Bath on account of his
health, Mr. Wheeler himself became indifferent about the promised
seat in the Supreme Council at Bengal. The infectious sorrow
spread itself to the very clerks in office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. Holt is in tears.</NOTE> Mr. Wilks ceased to pore
upon dispatches and records; and one solitary tear was observed to
wander upon the cheek of Mr. Holt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Direc∣tors again re∣lent.</NOTE> To brighten up the face of
the India-House some of the opposing Directors thought it expedient
to relent. The orders were accordingly signed on the 12th of
April 1775, on the very day of the annual election, when the
Court of Proprietors were met to chuse new Directors, and had
consequently suspended the authority of the old.</P>
<P>Such is the history of the restoration of Tanjore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Concluding observations.</NOTE> which is de∣livered
with all due deference to the public, by whose judgment we
shall abide. To those who may chuse to examine the subject with
attention, it will appear extraordinary, that, amidst all the usurpa∣tions
of the arms of the Company, the only conquest made by the
orders of the Court of Directors, is that which they have chosen to
select as an exhibition of their retributive justice.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Signal <HI>virtue</HI> of the Direc∣tors.</NOTE> Not satisfied with
a common act of reparation, that <HI>honourable</HI> body have refined,
upon what they denominate “public honour.” In all the history
of their ravaging wars in India, they could produce but one instance
in which their SOVEREIGN, both by his plenipotentiary and per∣sonal
approbation, had given a sanction to their hostilities. That
was the act which <HI>they</HI> thought the most worthy of being stigma∣tized.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Usual pro∣gress of the Company's wars.</NOTE>
The usual progress of the Company, in their military trans∣actions,
had been to begin as allies, to grow into Duans, to con∣clude
as usurpers. In the business of Tanjore their conduct has
<PB N="270" REF="285"/>
been more mysterious, and of course less suitable to their common
principles. They began as guarantees, remonstrated as advisers,
aided as allies, fought and conquered as auxiliaries. In the course
of a few years they affected to relent; and with peculiar feeling,
knowledge, and propriety, restored, as PRINCIPALS, what they
and their servants had been paid for reducing as MERCENARIES.</P>
<P>Where was the black chronicle of Indian devastations when the
Honourable Court began to relent? Had they,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <HI>public virtue</HI> had va∣rious oppor∣tunities to be exercised.</NOTE> in the hour of
affected sympathy, thrown their eyes on the melancholy history of
the Company's ambition, they might find many acts more worthy
of being redressed than the reduction of Tanjore; acts committed by
their servants, not executed by their OWN ORDERS. From the
banks of the Nirbidda, where the unfortunate Nabob of Broach
commenced his alliance and ruin under their auspices: from the
Cristna to the mouths of the Ganges, a field fruitful in the SILENT
change and destruction of Rajahs; from the mouths of the Ganges
to its source, a tract marked with the blood and wreck of Nabobs and
Rajahs; and blackened with the most horrid treachery to the un∣fortunate
Emperor, whose servants they prosess themselves. In
all that extensive scene of desolation, was there no object that called
for redress, no Prince worthy of being restored, but the Rajah of
Tanjore, whom, for his own PERFIDY, they themselves had
ordered to be chastifed? Perhaps not—where the Company act a
part, death generally closes the scene!</P>
<P>But to do justice to the Court of Directors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their real motives.</NOTE> let it be supposed for a
moment, that all the Nabobs, Rajahs, and Princes, over whose
dominions the hand of ambitious rapacity has passed, are still alive.
That the Nabob of Broach had an early claim upon the friendship
of any gentleman, or, if the Directors are fond of a title, any
NOBLEMAN, appointed to the government of Bombay. That such
gentleman or such nobleman had received a letter from India,
<PB N="271" REF="286"/>
describing the situation of the Nabob; expressing, at the same time,
his remembrance of past favours and assurances of future gratitude.
Let it also be supposed, that the deprived Rajahs and Zemindars of
the northern Circars had similar claims on gentlemen, about to be
sent from Leadenhall-street to be Chiefs in these provinces. That
the JAFFIERS, the SINGS, the COSSIMS, the SHAW ALLUMS,
along the banks of all the branches of the Ganges, had pretensions
to the favour and hopes from the support of some old friends
preparing to embark for India as Governors in or near their
respective countries. In such an intelligible situation, who could
doubt the relentings of the leaders among the Directors, or the
RESTORING influence of the India-House cabinet? Who could
suspect their integrity, or who refuse his applause to their PUBLIC
VIRTUE?</P>
<P>Should it unfortunately happen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Relative to Tanjore ex∣plained.</NOTE> that the RESTORING Chief, or
Governor, should throw discredit on that public virtue, by his capri∣cious,
violent, and arbitrary conduct upon his arrival at the scene
of action. That every condition that could be asked, for the in∣terest
of the Company and honour of the nation is rejected. That
no consideration of public inconvenience, none of private distress can
either soften his mind, or suspend his resolution. That the most
ample security and provision, for the party SUPPOSED to be injured,
is rejected: That nothing but revolution itself, with every conco∣mitant
influence of terror, can satisfy this umpire of the fate of
States and Princes: That, to complete the object of his mission, a
sanction, under every denunciation of vengeance, is to be extorted,
under the seal of the party aggrieved. In that case, the most igno∣rant
spectator can understand the PIECE, and enter into the conduct
of the author, the managers, and the actors, in all the <HI>liaison des
scenes,</HI> from the first idea of the plot to the catastrophe.</P>
