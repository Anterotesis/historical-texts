<HEAD>TO HIS GRACE WILLIAM Duke of DEVONSHIRE, Lord Chamberlain of his Majesty's Houshold.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE MINOR, who is indebted for his appear∣ance on the stage, to your grace's indulgence, begs leave to desire your grace's further protection, at his entering into the world.</P>
<P>Though the allegiance due from the whole dramatic people to your grace's station, might place this address in the light of a natural tribute; yet, my lord, I should not have taken that liberty with the duke of Devonshire, if I could not, at the same time, plead some little utility in the design of my piece; and add, that the public approbation has stamped a value on the execution.</P>
<P>The law, which threw the stage under the absolute government of a lord chamberlain, could not fail to fill the minds of all the objects of that power, with very gloomy apprehensions; they found themselves (through their own licentiousness, it must be confess'd) in a more precarious dependant state, than any other of his majesty's subjects. But when their direction was lodged in the hands of a nobleman, whose an∣cestors had so successfully struggled for national liber∣ty, they ceased to fear for their own. It was not from a patron of the liberal arts, they were to expect an oppressor; it was not from the friend of freedom, and of man, they were to dread partial monopolies, or the establishment of petty tyrannies.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5"/>Their warmest wishes are accomplished; none of their rights have been invaded, except, what without the first poetic authority, I should not venture to call a right, the Jure Nocendi.</P>
<P>Your tenderness, my lord, for all the followers of the Muses, has been in no instance more conspicuous, than in your late favour to me, the meanest of their train; your grace has thrown open (for those who are deny'd admittance into the palaces of Parnassus) a cottage on its borders, where the unhappy migrants may be, if not magnificently, at least, hospitably en∣tertained.</P>
<P>I shall detain your grace no longer, than just to eccho the public voice, that, for the honour, progress, and perfection of letters, your grace may long conti∣nue their candid CENSOR, who have always been their generous protector.</P>
<P>I have the honor, my lord, to be, with the greatest respect, and gratitude,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your grace's most dutiful, Most oblig'd, And obedient servant, SAMUEL FOOTE.</SIGNED>

<P>Ha, ha, ha, what, hard at it, my boy!— Here's your old friend Canker and I come for a peep. Well, and hey, what is your plan?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plan?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, what are your characters? Give us your groupe; how is your cloth fill'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Characters!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay.—Come, come, communicate. What, man, we will lend thee a lift. I have a damn'd fine original for thee, an aunt of my own, just come from the north, with the true Newcastle bur in her throat; and a nose and a chin.—I am afraid she is not well enough known: But I have a remedy for that. I'll bring her the first night of your piece, place her in a con∣spicuous station, and whisper the secret to the
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
whole house. That will be damn'd fine, won't it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, delicious!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>But don't name me. For if she smokes me, for the author, I shall be dash'd out of her codicil in a hurry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, never fear me. But I shou'd think your uncle Tom a better character.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, the politician?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay; that every day, after dinner, as soon as the cloth is remov'd, fights the battle of Min∣den, batters the French with cherry-stones, and pursues 'em to the banks of the Rhine, in a stream of spilt port.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, damn it, he'll do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or what say you to your father-in-law, Sir Timothy? Who, tho' as broken-winded as a Hounslow post horse, is eternally chaunting Venetian ballads. Kata tore cara higlia.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admirable! by heavens! — Have you got 'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then in with 'em, my boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pr'ythee why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why look'ee, Smart, tho' you are, in the language of the world, my friend, yet there is one thing you, I am sure, love better than any body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, pr'ythee —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>How now, am I sure that you, who so readily give up your relations, may not have some design upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, as soon as my characters begin to circulate a little successfully, my mouth is stopp'd in a minute, by the clamour of your relations, — Oh, damme, — 'tis a shame, — it shoul'd not be, — people of distinction brought upon the stage. — And so out of compliment to your cousins I am to be beggar'd, for treat∣ing the public with the follies of your family, at your own request.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you think I wou'd be such a dog. What the devil, then, are we to have nothing personal? Give us the actors however.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, that's stale. Besides, I think they have, of all men, the best right to complain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, by rendering them ridiculous in their profession, you, at the same time, injure their pockets. Now, as to the other gentry, they have providentially something besides their understanding to rely on; and the only injury they can receive is, that the whole town is then diverted, with what before, was only the amusement of private parties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give us then a national portrait: a Scotch∣man or an Irishman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean merely the dialect of the two countries, I can't think it either a subject of satyr or humour; it is an accidental unhappi∣ness, for which a man is no more accountable, than the colour of his hair. Now affecta∣tion I take to be the true comic object. If, in∣deed, a north Briton, struck with a scheme of reformation, should advance from the banks of the Tweed, to teach the English the true pro∣nunciation of their own language, he would, I think, merit your laughter: nor would a Dub∣lin mechanic, who, from heading the Liberty boys in a skirmish on Ormond Quay, should think he had a right to prescribe military laws
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
to the first commander in Europe, be a less ridiculous object.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there such?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mean that the blunders of a few pea∣sants, or the partial principles of a single scoun∣drel, are to stand as characteristical marks of a whole country; your pride may produce a laugh, but, believe me, it is at the expence of your understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heyday, what a system is here! Laws for laughing! And pray, sage Sir, instruct us when we may laugh with propriety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>At an old beau, a superannuated beauty, a military coward, a stuttering orator, or a gouty dancer. In short, whoever affects to be what he is not, or strives to be what he cannot, is an object worthy the poet's pen, and your mirth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha, I don't know what you mean by your is nots, and cannots — damn'd abstruse jar∣gon. Ha, Canker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but if you will not give us persons, let us have things. Treat us with a modern amour, or a state intrigue, or a —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so amuse the public ear, at the expence of private peace. You must excuse me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so, with these principles, you expect to thrive on this spot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, it won't do. I tell thee the plain roast and boil'd of the theatres will never do at this table. We must have high season'd ragoûts, and rich sauces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, perhaps, by way of desert, I may produce something that may hit your palate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your bill of fare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What think you of one of those itinerant field orators, who tho' at declar'd enmity with common sense, have the address to poison the principles, and, at the same time, pick the pockets, of half our industrious fellow sub∣jects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have a care. Dangerous ground. Ludere cum sacris, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I look upon it in a different manner. I consider these gentlemen in the light of public performers, like myself; and whether we ex∣hibit at Tottenham-court, or the Hay-market, our purpose is the same, and the place is im∣material.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed if it be considered—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, more, I must beg leave to assert, that ridicule is the only antidote against this perni∣cious poison. This is a madness that argument can never cure: and, should a little wholsome severity be apply'd, persecution would be the immediate cry: where then can we have re∣course, but to the comic muse; perhaps, the archness and severity of her smile, may redress an evil, that the Laws cannot reach, or reason reclaim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CANKER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if it does not cure those already di∣stemper'd, it may be a means to stop the in∣fection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how is your scheme conducted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of that you may judge. We are just going upon a repetition of the piece. I should be glad to have your opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will give it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FOOTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>One indulgence: As you are Englishmen, I think, I need not beg, that as from necessity most of my performers are new, you will al∣low for their inexperience, and encourage their timidity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMART.</SPEAKER>
<P>But reasonable.</P>

<P>What's the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEARSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. O-Shochnesy has return'd the part of the bawd; she says she is a gentlewoman, and it would be a reflection on her family to do any such thing.</P>

<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PEARSE.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it had been only a whore, says she, I should not have minded it; because no lady need be asham'd of doing that.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>OME, come, brother, I know the world. People, who have their at∣tention eternally fix'd upon one ob∣ject, can't help being a little narrow in their notions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A sagacious remark that, and highly pro∣bable, that we merchants, who maintain a constant correspondence with the four quarters of the world, should know less of it than you fashionable fellows, whose whole experience is bounded by Westminster bridge.</P>

<SP>

<P>Ha, ha, prejudice!</P>

<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, indeed, you remov'd him to the uni∣versity; where, lest his morals should be mend∣ed, and his understanding improv'd, you fairly set him free from the restraint of the one, and the drudgery of the other, by the priviledg'd distinction of a silk gown and velvet cap.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>And all these evils, you think, a city-edu∣cation would have prevented?</P>

<P>Why truly, brother, had you stuck to your old civic vices, hypocrisy, couzenage, and ava∣rice, I don't know, whether I might not have committed George to your care; but, you cockneys now beat us suburbians at our own weapons. What, old boy, times are chang'd since the date of thy intendures; when the sleek, crop-ear'd 'prentice us'd to dangle after his mistress, with the great gilt Bible under his arm, to St. Bride's, on a Sunday; bring home the text, repeat the divisions of the discourse, dine at twelve, and regale, upon a gaudy day, with buns and beer at Islington, or Mile-End.</P>

<P>It is sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did Mr. Capias drop any hint of my bus'ness with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. He only said, with his spectacles on his nose, and his hand upon his chin, Sir William Wealthy is a respectable personage, and my client; he wants to retain you in a certain affair, and will open the case, and give you your brief himself: if you adhere to his instructions, and carry your cause, he is gene∣rous, and will discharge your bill without taxation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, my friend Capias to a hair. Well sir, this is no bad specimen of your abilities. But see that the door is fast. Now sir, you are to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A moment's pause, if you please. You must know, Sir William, I am a prodigious admirer of forms. Now Mr. Capias tells me, that it is always the rule, to administer a re∣taining fee before you enter upon the merits.</P>

<P>Oh, sir, I beg your pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not that I question'd your generosity; but forms you know —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>No apology, I beg. But as we are to have a closer connection, it may not be amiss, by way of introduction, to understand one another a little. Pray sir, where was you born?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>At my father's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hum.—And what was he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was you bred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like a gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd nothing induce you to unbosom yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Loke'e Sir William, there is a kind of some∣thing in your countenance, a certain openness and generosity, a je ne sçai quoi in your man∣ner,
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
that I will unlock: You shall see me all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will oblige me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know then, that Fortune, which frequently delights to raise the noblest struc∣tures from the simplest foundations; who from a taylor made a pope, from a gin-shop an em∣press, and many a prime minister, from nothing at all, thought fit to raise me to my present height, from the humble employment of Light your Honour, — A link boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pleasant fellow. —Who were your parents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was produced, sir, by a left-handed mar∣riage, in the language of the news papers, between an illustrious lamp-lighter, and an eminent itinerant cat and dog butcher. — Cat's meat, and dog's meat.— I dare say, you have heard my mother, sir. But as to this happy pair, I owe little besides my being; I shall drop them where they dropt me, in the street.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My first knowledge of the world I owe to a school, which has produced many a great man; the avenues of the Play-house: There sir, lean∣ing on my extinguish'd link, I learn'd dexterity
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
from pick-pockets, connivance from constables, politics and fashions from footmen, and the art of making and breaking a promise, from their masters. Here, sirrah, light me across the kennel.—I hope your honour will remember poor Jack,— You ragged rascal, I have no halfpence—I'll pay you the next time I see you.—But, lack-a-day, sir, that time I saw as seldom as his tradesmen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>To these accomplishments from without the Theatre, I must add one that I obtain'd within.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did you gain admittance there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My merit, sir, that, like my link, threw a radiance round me. — A detachment from the head quarters here, took possession in the summer, of a country corporation, where I did the honours of the barn, by sweeping the stage, and clipping the candles. There my skill and address was so conspicuous, that it procur'd me the same office the ensuing winter, at Drury-Lane, where I acquir'd intrepidity; the crown of all my virtues.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did you obtain that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my post. For I think, sir, he that dares stand the shot of the gallery in lighting, snuf∣fing, and sweeping, the first night of a new play, may bid defiance to the pillory, with all its customary compliments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some truth in that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But an unlucky crab-apple, apply'd to my right eye, by a patriot gingerbread baker from the Borough, who would not suffer three dancers from Switzerland, because he hated the French, forced me to a precipitate retreat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor devil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Broglio and Contades have done the same. But as it happen'd, like a tennis-ball, I rose higher from the rebound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>My misfortune, sir, mov'd the compassion of one of our performers, a whimsical man, he took me into his service. To him I owe, what, I believe, will make me useful to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Explain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, sir, my master was remarkably happy in an art, which however disesteemed at pre∣sent,
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
is, by Tully, reckon'd amonst the per∣fections of an orator, Mimickry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are deeply read, Mr. Shift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A smattering. —But as I was saying, sir, nothing came amiss to my master. Bypeds, or quadrupeds; rationals, or animals; from the clamours of the bar, to the cackles of the barn door; from the soporific twang of the tabernacle at Tottenham-Court, to the melo∣dious bray of their long-ear'd brethren in Bun∣hill Fields; all were objects of his imitation, and my attention. In a word, sir, for two whole years, under this professor, I study'd and starv'd, impoverish'd my body, and pam∣per'd my mind, till thinking myself pretty near equal to my master, I made him one of his own bows, and set up for myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been successful, I hope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well. I can't complain. My art, sir, is a pass-par-tout. I seldom want employment. Let's see how stand my engagements, <STAGE><HI>pulls out a pocket-book,</HI></STAGE> Hum,—hum, —Oh, Wed∣nesday at Mr. Gammut's near Hanover-square; there, there, I shall make a meal upon the Min∣gotti, for her ladyship is in the opera interest: but, however, I shall revenge her cause upon herrival, Mattei. Sunday evening at Lady Susti∣nuto's

Friday I am to give the amorous parly of two intriguing cats in a gutter, with the disturbing of a hen-roost, at Mr. Deputy Sugarsops, near the Monument. So, sir, you see my hands are full. In short, Sir William, there is not a buck or a turtle devoured within the bills of mortality, but there, I may, if I please, stick a napkin under my chin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid, Mr. Shift, I must break in a little upon your engagements; but you shall be no loser by the bargain.</P>
</SP>

<P>Enough.—You must know then, the hopes of our family, are, Mr. Shift, center'd in one boy.</P>

<P>And, I warrant he is a hopeful one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>No interruption I beg. George has been abroad these four years, and from his late be∣haviour, I have reason to believe, that had a certain event happened, which I am afraid he wished, — my death. —</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; that's natural enough.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, pray, — there wou'd soon be an end to an ancient and honourable family.</P>

<P>Very melancholy indeed. But families, like besoms, will wear to the stumps, and finally fret out, as you say.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that will be a coup de maîtro.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have prevail'd upon his uncle, a wealthy citizen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't like a city plot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I tell thee it is my own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother, I say, some time since, wrote him a circumstantial account of my death; upon which, he is returned, in full expectation of succeeding to my estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Immediately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; when at age. In about three months.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, sir, guessing into what hands my heedless boy would naturally fall, on his return, I have, in a feign'd character, associated myself
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
with a set of rascals, who will spread every bait that can flatter folly, inflame extravagance, allure inexperience, or catch credulity. And when by their means, he thinks himself re∣duc'd to the last extremity; lost even to the most distant hope—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then will I step in like his guardian-angel, and snatch him from perdition. If, mortify'd by misery, he becomes conscious of his errors, I have sav'd my son; but if, on the other hand, gratitude can't bind, nor ruin reclaim him, I will cast him out, as an alien to my blood, and trust for the support of my name and family to a remoter branch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravely resolv'd. But what part am I to sustain in this drama?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>

<P>Out of your sight!</P>
</SP>

<P>How do you escape your son's notice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>His firm persuasion of my death, with the extravagance of my disguise.—Why, I wou'd engage to elude your penetration, when I am beau'd out for the baron. But of that by and by. He has recourse, after his ill success, to the cent. per cent. gentry, the usurers, for a far∣ther supply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Natural enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do you know, — I forget his name, — a wrinkled old fellow, in a thread-bare coat? He sits every morning from twelve till two, in the left corner of Lloyd's coffee-house; and every evening, from five till eight, under the clock, at the Temple-exchange.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. Do you know him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Know him! Ay, rot him. It was but last Easter Tuesday, he had me turn'd out at a feast, in Leather-seller's Hall, for singing Room for Cuckolds, like a parrot; and vow'd it meant a reflection upon the whole body corporate.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have reason to remember him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes. I recommended a minor to him myself, for the loan only of fifty pounds; and wou'd you believe it, as I hope to be sav'd, we din'd, supp'd, and wetted five and thirty guineas upon tick, in meetings at the Cross-keys, in order to settle the terms; and after all, the scoundrel would not lend us a stiver.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Cou'd you personate him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SHIFT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Him! Oh, you shall see me shift into his shamble in a minute: and, with a wither'd face, a bit of a purple nose, a cautionary stammer, and a sleek silver head, I would un∣dertake to deceive even his banker. But to speak the truth, I have a friend that can do this inimitably well. Have not you something of more consequence for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir WILLIAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have. Cou'd not you, master Shift, assume another shape? You have attended auctions.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, you stare, I don't wonder at it. This is an elegant refinement, unknown to the gross voluptuaries of this part of the world. This is, Mr. Loader, what may be called a debt to your dignity: for an opera girl is as essential a piece of equipage for a man of fa∣shion, as his coach.</P>

<P>Ever since my last visitation of the gout. Upon my first fit, seven years ago, I began to have my doubts, and my waverings; but I was lost in a labyrinth, and no body to shew me the road.

<P>So, sir, what, I suppose, this is a spice of your foreign breeding, to let your uncle kick

his heels in your hall, whilst your presence chamber is crowded with pimps, bawds, and gamesters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a proof of my respect, dear nuncle. Would it have been decent now, nuncle, to have introduc'd you into such company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wonderfully considerate! Well, young man, and what do you think will be the end of all this! Here, I have received by the last mail, a quire of your draughts from abroad. I see you were determin'd our neighbours should taste of your magnificence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I think I did some credit to my country.</P>

<P>From me!—Not a souse to keep you from the Counter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then let the scoundrels stay. It is their duty. I have other demands, debts of honour, which must be discharg'd.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a diabolical distinction! Here's a pro∣stitution of words!—Honour! Sdeath, that a

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a truce to this threadbare trumpery, dear nuncle. I confess my folly. But make yourself easy; you won't be troubled with many more of my visits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I was weak enough to design a short expostulation with you; but as we in the city know the true value of time, I shall take care not to squander away any more of it upon you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. I neither know her, nor have seen her; enquired after her, or ever intend it.</P>

<P>You have hit it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, now we come to the point. Well, and pray—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why it is not so much a dislike to your per∣son, tho' that is exceptionable enough, but your profession, dear nuncle, is an insuperable obstacle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good lack! And what harm has that done, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Done! So stain'd, polluted, and tainted the whole mass of your blood, thrown such a blot on your 'scutcheon, as ten regular successions can hardly efface.</P>

<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The duce.</P>

<P>And could you now, consistently with your duty as a faithful guardian, recommend my union with the daughter of a trader?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, indeed, I ask pardon; I am afraid I did not weigh this matter as maturely as I ought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, a horrid, barbarous scheme?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then I thought her having the honour to partake of the same flesh and blood with yourself, might prove in some measure, a kind of Fuller's-earth, to scoure out the dirty spots, contracted by commerce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Impossible!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, here it has been the practice even of peers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't mention the unnatural intercourse! Thank heav'n, Mr. Richard Wealthy, my edu∣cation has been in another country; where I have been too well instructed in the value of nobility, to think of intermixing it with the offspring of a Burgois. Why, what apology cou'd I make to my children, for giving them such a mother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think of that. Then I must de∣spair, I am afraid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can afford but little hopes. Tho', upon recollection—Is the Grissette pretty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A parent may be partial. She is thought so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah la jòlie petite Bourgoise; Poor girl, I sin∣cerely pitty her. And I suppose, to procure

her emersion from the mercantile mud, no con∣sideration wou'd be spar'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, for such an honour, one wou'd strain a point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, not totally to destroy your hopes, I do recollect an edict in favour of Britany; that when a man of distinction engages in commerce, his nobility is suffer'd to sleep.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And upon his quitting the contagious con∣nexion, he is permitted to resume his rank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's fortunate.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, nuncle Richard, if you will sell out of the stocks, shut up your counting-house, and quit St. Mary Ax for Grosvenor-square—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>R. WEALTHY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when your rank has had time to rouse itself, for I think your nobility, nuncle, has had a pretty long nap, if the girl's person is pleasing, and the purchase money is adequate to the honour, I may in time, be prevail'd upon to restore her to the right of her family.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite an accident, as I may say. You must have known my predecessor, Mr. Prig, the greatest man in the world, in his way, ay, or that ever was, or ever will be, quite a jewel of a man, he would touch you up a lot; there was no resisting him. He would force you to bid, whether you would or no. I shall never see his equal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are modest, Mr. Smirk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, but his shadow. Far be it from me, to vie with that great man. But as I was saying, my predecessor, Mr. Prig, was to have a sale as it might be on a Saturday. On Fri∣day at noon, I shall never forget the day, he was suddenly seiz'd with a violent cholic. He sent for me to his bed-side, squeez'd me by the hand; dear Smirk, said he, what an acci∣dent! You know what is to-morrow; the greatest shew this season; prints, pictures, bronzes, butterflies, medals, and minionettes; all the world will be there; lady Dy Toss, Mrs. Nankyn, the dutchess of Dupe, and every bo∣dy at all: You see my state, it will be impos∣sible for me to mount. What can I do? It was not for me, you know, to advice that great man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>At last, looking wishfully at me, Smirk, says he, d'you love me? — Mr. Prig, can you doubt it? — I'll put it to the test, says he; sup∣ply my place to-morrow. — I, eager to shew my love, rashly and rapidly replied, I will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was bold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Absolute madness. But I had gone too far to recede. Then the point was, to prepare for the aweful occasion. The first want that oc∣curr'd to me, was a wig; but this was too ma∣terial an article, to depend on my own judge∣ment. I resolv'd to consult my friends. I told them the affair — you hear, gentlemen, what has happen'd; Mr. Prig, one of the greatest men, in his way, the world ever saw, or ever will, quite a jewel of a man, taken with a violent fit of the cholic; to-morrow, the greatest shew this season; prints, pictures, bronzes, butterflies, medals, and minionettes; every body in the world to be there; lady Dy Toss, Mrs. Nankyn, dutchess of Dupe, and all mankind; it being impossible he should mount, I have consented to sell—They star'd— It is true, gentlemen. Now I should be glad
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
to have your opinions as to a wig. They were divided: some recommended a tye, others a bag; one mentioned a bob, but was soon over∣rul'd. Now, for my part, I own, I rather inclin'd to the bag; but, to avoid the imputa∣tion of rashness, I resolv'd to take Mrs. Smirk's judgment, my wife, a dear good woman, fine in figure, high in taste, a superior genius, and knows old china like a Nabob.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was her decision?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told her the case — My dear, you know what has happen'd. My good friend, Mr. Prig, the greatest man in the world, in his way, that ever was, or ever will be, quite a jewel of a man, a violent fit of the cholic—the greatest shew this season, to-morrow, pictures and every thing in the world; all the world will be there: now, as it is impossible he should, I mount in his stead. You know the importance of a wig; I have ask'd my friends — some recommend a tye, others a bag — what is your opinion? Why, to deal freely, Mr. Smirk, says she, a tye for your round, regular, smiling face would be rather too formal, and a bag too boyish, deficient in dignity for the solemn occasion; were I worthy to advise, you should wear a something between both. I'll be hang'd, if you don't mean a major. I jumpt at the hint, and a major it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, that was fixt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>
<P>Finally. But next day, when I came to mount the rostrum, then was the trial. My limbs shook, and my tongue trembled. The first lot was a chamber-utensil, in Chelsea chi∣na, of the pea-green pattern. It occasioned a great laugh; but I got thro' it. Her Grace, indeed, gave me great encouragement. I over∣heard her whisper to lady Dy, Upon my word, Mr. Smirk does it very well. Very well, in∣deed, Mr. Smirk, addressing herself to me. I made an acknowledging bow to her Grace, as in duty bound. But one flower flounc'd invo∣luntarily from me, that day, as I may say. I remember, Dr. Trifle call'd it enthusiastic, and pronounc'd it a presage of my future great∣ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SMIRK.</SPEAKER>

<P>Some months ago, sir, I was consider'd as she joint heiress of a respectable, wealthy

</SP>

<P>There you must pardon me. Unkind and cruel tho' he has been to me, let me discharge the duty of a daughter, suffer in silence, nor bring reproach on him who gave me being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>I applaud your piety.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>At this happy period, my father judging an addition of wealth must bring an increase of happiness, resolv'd to unite me with a man, sordid in his mind, brutal in his manners, and riches his only recommendation. My refusal of this ill-suited match, tho' mildly given, enflam'd my father's temper, naturally cho∣leric, alienated his affections, and banish'd me his house, distrest and destitute.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wou'd no friend receive you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, how few are friends to the unfor∣tunate! Besides, I knew, sir, such a step wou'd be consider'd by my father, as an appeal from his justice. I therefore retir'd to a remote corner of the town, trusting, as my only ad∣vocate, to the tender calls of nature, in his cool, reflecting hours.</P>

<P>How came you to know this woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Accident plac'd me in a house, the mistress of which profess'd the same principles with my infamous conductress. There, as enthusiasm is the child of melancholy, I caught the in∣fection. A constant attendance on their as∣semblies procur'd me the acquaintance of this woman, whose extraordinary zeal and devotion first drew my attention and confidence. I trusted her with my story, and in return, re∣ceiv'd the warmest invitation to take the pro∣tection of her house. This I unfortunately accepted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir GEORGE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unfortunately indeed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUCY.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the decency of appearances, I was some time imposed upon. But an accident, which you will excuse my repeating, reveal'd all the horror of my situation. I will not trouble you with a recital of all the arts us'd to seduce me: Happily they hitherto have fail'd. But this morning I was acquainted with my destiny; and no other election left me, but immediate compliance, or a jail. In this desperate con∣dition, you cannot wonder, sir, at my choosing rather to rely on the generosity of a gentleman, than the humanity of a creature, insensible to pity, and void of every virtue.</P>

He'll make me an excise-man, I suppose, a gauger of beer barrels. No, that will never do. This lad here is no fool. Foppish, indeed. He does not want parts, no, nor principles neither.

<L>Old-nick will soon a football make of him!</L>
<L>For foremost rows in side-boxes you shove,</L>
<L>Think you to meet with side-boxes above?</L>
<L>Where giggling girls, and powder'd fops may sit,</L>
<L>No, you will all be cram'd into the pit,</L>
<L>And crowd the house for satan's benefit.</L>
<L>Oh, what you snivel; well, do so no more,</L>
<L>Drop, to attone, your money at the door,</L>
<L>And, if I please,—I'll give it to the poor.</L></Q></P>
