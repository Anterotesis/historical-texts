<HEAD>THE
Convocation:
A
POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN Vertue's Standard Ecclesia∣sticks bear,</L>
<L>Their sacred Robe the noblest Minds revere.</L>
<L>All to its Guidance do their Thoughts submit,</L>
<L>But such who triumph in licentious Wit;</L>
<L>And nauseous Mirth as high Desert esteem,</L>
<L>When rais'd by Scorn upon Religion's Theme!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<L>As Kings by Right Divine o'er Nations sway,</L>
<L>As the most worthy, their high Pow'rs obey;</L>
<L>Homage by all is to the Priesthood born,</L>
<L>And none but Fools their Heav'nly Pastors scorn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet censure not the Muse's Freedom here:</L>
<L>If urg'd by Errors, she must seem severe!</L>
<L>Tho' keen her Satyr, she no Envy bears;</L>
<L>Tho' Priests she lashes, she their Function spares.</L>
<L>Nor for ill Members such the Clergy calls,</L>
<L>But on their Shame, and not their Glory, falls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Of all the Plagues with which the World is curst,</L>
<L>Time has still prov'd that <HI>Priestcraft</HI> is the worst.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4"/>
By some, what Notions thro' the World are spread?</L>
<L>On Falshoods grounded, and from Int'rest bred;</L>
<L>Errour has still the giddy World perplext,</L>
<L>Whilst Scripture gilds it with some sacred Text.</L>
<L>This wild Opinions Strife and Faction brings,</L>
<L>The Bane of Nations, the Misrule of Kings.</L>
<L>Priests oft profane what they from Heav'n de∣rive;</L>
<L>Some live by Legends, some by Murders thrive,</L>
<L>Some sell their Gods, and Altar-Rites deface,</L>
<L>With Doctrines some the Brain-sick People craze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Pagan prey on slaughter'd Wretches Fates,</L>
<L>The <HI>Romish</HI> fatten on the best Estates,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5"/>
The <HI>British</HI> stain what Heav'n has right confest,</L>
<L>And <HI>Sectaries</HI> the Scriptures falsly wrest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Amongst the Tribe, how few are, as they ought,</L>
<L>Clear in their Souls, instructive in their Thought!</L>
<L>The Good, like Prophets, shew their Precepts pure;</L>
<L>The Ill with Craft the Heav'nly Light obscure;</L>
<L>False to their Trust, they lead their Flocks astray,</L>
<L>And with their Errors cloud the sacred Way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' artless Numbers may my Verses throng,</L>
<L>Yet now Religion's Cause inspires my Song:</L>
<L>Undaunted then, my Muse, thy Purpose say,</L>
<L>And for the <HI>Church</HI> thy warmest Zeal display!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
<L>And <HI>Erring Prelate</HI> let thy Lays proclaim,</L>
<L>And sing the <HI>Convocation</HI>'s sacred Fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When dire Confusion bore a dreadful Hand,</L>
<L>And sore Divisions shook the guilty Land;</L>
<L>When Schisms rent the Church, Faction the State,</L>
<L>And Schoolmens Quarrels did new Broils create;</L>
<L>'Midst Crowds of <HI>Libels</HI> publish'd to enrage,</L>
<L>Writ to corrupt, but not t'improve the Age,</L>
<L>Forth to the World from a Learn'd Author came</L>
<L><HI>Two,</HI> which bear Censures equal to their Fame:</L>
<L>By some admired, and by some contemn'd,</L>
<L>Prais'd by the Vulgar, by his Peers condemn'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
<L>Some pleas'd with Charms the Syren Stile may give,</L>
<L>Regard not Poysons that their Souls receive:</L>
<L>But the sage Brethren lurking Dangers find,</L>
<L>Against the Laws of God and Man design'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His first Essay was 'gainst <HI>Nonjurors</HI> wrote,</L>
<L>With equal Spleen and false Quotations fraught;</L>
<L>Which shews how easie 'tis in each Dispute,</L>
<L>T'asperse those Reasons which we can't confute.</L>
<L>But why such Treatment does that Clan de∣serve?</L>
<L>Must they not pray, because they almost starve?</L>
<L>They for their Consciences their <HI>All</HI> have lost;</L>
<L>Many, Preferment: Few such Zeal can boast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
<L>God's Fav'rites yet he calls 'em 'cause <HI>sincere:</HI></L>
<L>A Name he makes <HI>Jews, Turks</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI> bear,</L>
<L>Persuasions true, and those which Errors throng,</L>
<L><HI>Sincerely</HI> holy, and <HI>sincerely</HI> wrong.</L>
<L>Tyrants in Bliss, like Martyrs, shall appear,</L>
<L>'Cause their Ill Zeal is, like the Good, <HI>sincere!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Can't the <HI>Nonjurors</HI> then this Favour claim?</L>
<L>Are they Exceptions from its gen'ral Aim?</L>
<L>Shall <HI>Sect'ries, Jews,</HI> nay <HI>Heathens</HI> thus enjoy</L>
<L>What he wou'd them of Christian Faith deny?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another's Conscience, none, he holds, can know;</L>
<L>Why then presumes he theirs to censure so?</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="9"/>
If from <HI>Sincerity</HI> Faith ought can claim,</L>
<L>Hard <HI>Deprivations</HI> theirs aloud proclaim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, <HI>Ordination</HI> to explode he seems,</L>
<L>Orders are <HI>Trifles,</HI> Church-Commissions <HI>Dreams!</HI></L>
<L>The Sense it self these Explanations own,</L>
<L>Which none unbyass'd, can as just disown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What more can Deists to the Church reply?</L>
<L>They in this wise her Sacraments deny;</L>
<L>Against her Canons and her Forms combine,</L>
<L>And with such Wretches will a Bishop joyn?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Topmost Sequel next, of his Essays,</L>
<L>The Pulpit trumpets, and the Press displays.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="10"/>
New Doctrines still advanc'd, the World alarm,</L>
<L>And all his Brethren with Resentment warm.</L>
<L>Ye Pow'rs! If Priests thus their own Craft be∣tray,</L>
<L>If what they should conceal, themselves display,</L>
<L>Atheists may well mysterious Rights deride,</L>
<L>Nor suffer sacred Faith as Reason's Guide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But whilst th' Infection thro' the Nation flies,</L>
<L>A Rev'rend Author to the Work replies.</L>
<L>Oh <HI>SNAPE!</HI> what Charms thy <HI>Genius</HI> here bestows;</L>
<L>Where nervous Sense in candid Smoothness flows.</L>
<L>Sublime thy Thought! with no harsh Stile defil'd,</L>
<L>Bold in thy Charge! yet in Expressions mild:</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="11"/>
Reason Divine in each illustrious Page,</L>
<L>Points out those Errors, which you here engage▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So <HI>Henry</HI> wrote, by Heav'n inspir'd, when he</L>
<L>From <HI>Luther</HI>'s Errors strove the Faith to free:</L>
<L>When that great Title in Return was born,</L>
<L>Which has e're since by <HI>British</HI> Kings been worn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Gospel's Light does here such Clouds dispel,</L>
<L>As <HI>Magus</HI>'s Witchcraft by th' Apostle fell.</L>
<L>So wrote that Tribe in sacred Annals past,</L>
<L>When Nations yielded, and the Faith embrac'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Clergy now in <HI>Convocation</HI> meet,</L>
<L>And in Debate on these new Doctrines sit.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="12"/>
No Contest in th' inferiour House arose;</L>
<L>But one Consent these dang'rous Errors shews.</L>
<L>None cou'd oppose! So plain did they appear:</L>
<L>Nor Doubts could rise their Innocence to clear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He, who a Priest, a Prelate's Doctrine blam'd,</L>
<L>Is, now a Prelate, here himself arraign'd.</L>
<L>He, who did once a worthy Doctor gall,</L>
<L>Finds now just Judgment on his Errors fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The first is <HI>Moss</HI> appointed in this Cause;</L>
<L>Who the sharp Charge against this Church-man draws.</L>
<L>On his sweet Tongue learn'd Elocution dwells,</L>
<L>Which in loud Strains the World their Duty tells.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="13"/>
His smooth Persuasions Men from Ills entice,</L>
<L>Reveal the Gospel, and dipel their Vice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, Learned <HI>Sprat</HI> in this Performance joins,</L>
<L>Who sprung from a late Pious Prelate's Loins:</L>
<L>His Father's Goodness did his Function grace,</L>
<L>And the Son's Vertues do his Footsteps trace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next, Florid <HI>Biss</HI> the glorious Cause main∣tains,</L>
<L>Who vast Applause from just Attention gains.</L>
<L>Vert'ous his Soul, his Mind does Wisdom shew,</L>
<L>And wholsome Doctrines from his Learning flow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Sherlock</HI>'s a Name that ever will survive:</L>
<L>For the dead Sire does in the Son revive.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="14"/>
Amidst the Clan, the Son is nam'd t'oppose</L>
<L>The Ill that from such Innovations grows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next in the List, but not the least, is <HI>Friend,</HI></L>
<L>Worthy the Cause now chosen to defend!</L>
<L>Let tutour'd Youth his wondrous Learning prove,</L>
<L>As to the Church his Actions do his Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Cannon</HI> and <HI>Davies, Barrel, Dawson,</HI> stand,</L>
<L>And act in Concert with this sacred Band.</L>
<L>These, to the Upper House are nam'd to give</L>
<L>The Charge, which there they with Consent receive.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
<L>But e're the Aim of all this Zeal was done,</L>
<L>It here was vanquish'd when 'twas scarce begun.</L>
<L>As <HI>Jove</HI> on high <HI>Olympus</HI> feign'd to sway,</L>
<L>With Thunder parted an immortal Fray:</L>
<L>To end the Jarrs that in Religion fall,</L>
<L><HI>GEORGE</HI> from the Throne at once prorogues 'em all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But thus the Parties, more incens'd with Rage,</L>
<L>Cease not the Contest; but new Conflicts wage.</L>
<L>In Print their Quarrels still confuse the World,</L>
<L>And Libels now promiscuously are hurl'd!</L>
<L>Their Trumpet Scandal loud Detraction sounds,</L>
<L>Diffuses Lies, and Reputations wounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="15" REF="16"/>
<L>Thus Paper-Squibs wing'd from the Presses fly!</L>
<L>Alarm! inflame! and loud for Answers cry!</L>
<L>Answers pursue th' Attack! Both Parties write!</L>
<L>Pens are their Swords, and Papers urge the Fight!</L>
<L>The Chiefs with Conduct both maintain the Day;</L>
<L>Others confound; but none decide the Fray.</L>
<L>Those best succeed, whose Works the Curious buy,</L>
<L>Whilst Scrawls neglected, on the Compter lie.</L>
<L>But still the Press supplies each empty Brain,</L>
<L>No <HI>Cyclop</HI> Authors form the Bolts in vain,</L>
<L>Thence they rush forth, and do the War sustain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
<L>As thus they 'ngage amidst this Clash of Arms,</L>

<L>Strives here to raise dull Satyr from the Times.</L>
<L>The High Church now with double Rage he wounds,</L>
<L>Faith serves for Mirth, the Clergy for Buffoons.</L>
<L>Yet the wise Work to aid a <HI>Churchman</HI> means,</L>

<L>'Gainst thee, O <HI>Sherlock!</HI> Such Efforts are
vain:</L>
<L>They but asperse what they can never slain.</L>
<L>Thy Foes augment by Scandal, Crimes they'd
clear,</L>

<L>Thy Strength of Reason stems the rapid Course,</L>
