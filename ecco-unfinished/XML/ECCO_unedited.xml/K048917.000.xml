<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no State of men more wretch∣ed
than that of <HI>Authors;</HI> If they mis∣manage,
they meet with the deserved
and unpitied Contempt, of all who see their
Works, or even hear of their Names. And let
them behave with all the sense and Address
imaginable, they shall move the Spleen of
the <HI>Wou'd be</HI>'s, these <HI>Insects</HI> who make the
greatest Splutter and Noise on the face of this
Earth: If they write for the whole Herd,
they raise as many Enemys, as there are half-witted
Pretenders (i. e. ninty nine parts of
an hundred) in the Book-learn'd World:
And if they lay in only for the Few, These
others shall have 'em on the Head of Obscu∣rity
and Pride. So that upon the whole
matter, to write well is only tolerable, but
not to write at all, is the wisest thing a Man
of Sense can do. And I am sure, nothing can
encourage an honest Man to instruct the
World in despite of it self, but a conscious∣ness
<PB REF="3"/>
he is doing his Duty, and promoting
one part of the Design of his Creation, <HI>viz.
The universal Benefit of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doctor Pitcairn,</HI> as the Nature of his
Employment required and as his own
singular A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilities and Advantages enabled him,
was going on in adorning the Province com∣mitted
to his trust, and had imparted to the
publick, some of his privat Meditations
and Observations; But no sooner did
he appear in Print, but he was in hazard
of being Worried and torn in peices, by
two Bloody minded Beasts of Prey, who
fell upon him from different quarters; But
both with the same intent, being acted by
the same principle: However as good Luck
wou'd have it, It happened their rage was
only like that of Women, Impotent and loud:
The first has already got his Reward, and is
gone to his Place of Oblivion and Contempt,
and the other will in due time follow.</P>
<P>In order to this, I have been tempted to
consider the Quarrel a little, and to examin
two <HI>Pamphlets</HI> written by <HI>D. Oliphant</HI> against
<HI>D. Pitcairns Dissertations,</HI> and <HI>The New
Theory of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evers:</HI> and I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> m mistaken if I have
not managed the matter so, as that his Ob∣jections
have not only had their own, but an
additional Force; and that the answers do
<PB REF="4"/>
not only meet them, but take in all that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
possible to be said on these Heads.</P>
<P>It is very hard to apply <HI>Geometry</HI> to <HI>Phy∣siology,</HI>
with such Accuracy and Niceness, as
to exclude all possibility of Wrangling: We
must make some Allowances, &amp; assume some
<HI>Data</HI> (especially in the first Attempts of this
Kind) else we shall never be able to enter
throughly into the Matters we design to
handle: But then, if we reason fairly, and
reckon justly from these Allowances, all
ingenious Men will be satisfied with such
Performances, since it is all can be done in
the present Condition of <HI>Medicine</HI> and <HI>Philo∣sophie.</HI>
Much Malice, a very little Wit
and a superficial Knowledge of the Matter,
may furnish out wherewith seemingly to ex∣pose
the most accurat Performances of this
Kind: But to find out where the Matter
truely halts, and to discover where <HI>Theories</HI>
are truely defective, requires other Mettle
than <HI>C. O.</HI> is made of. Such as he may raise
a little Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, break a Window, or beat down
a Chimney (tho in his late attacks, he has
not done so much as these) But the Fort
will stand safe and secure, when he and all
his weak Efforts, and the vain Assaults of such
poor Enemies, have ebb'd into the Nothing
whence they came. Had I been of his coun∣sel,
<PB REF="5"/>
I cou'd have told him some Objecti∣ons
he might have made, with more shew of
Reason, than these he has adduc'd; But who∣ever
had the Capacity of making such, must
have had the Ingenuity to acknowledge, they
were such as were unavoidable in the present
low Estate of <HI>Medicine;</HI> Both which re∣quir'd
a better Turn of Head &amp; more Honesty,
than <HI>C. O.</HI> has shown in his late Works.</P>
<P>I acknowledge I have written these Papers
with more Edge, than became so grave a sub∣ject
of Debate; But I'm affraid, those who
consider the Maner after which he has treated
my <HI>Friend,</HI> and the Personal Provocations I
have receiv'd, will rather condemn me of <HI>In∣sensibility</HI>
than <HI>Passion.</HI> It is impossible to
read over his scurrilous and abusive Pamph∣letes,
without some degree of <HI>Indignation;</HI>
And <HI>C. O.</HI> (if he has any Sincerity) must
acknowlege, I have treated him more civil∣ly,
than he deserv'd at my Hands, and have
left many things unsaid, to bring him to a
Sense of his Folly and ungratitude if possible.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Names</HI> he calls me, I do not
much trouble my self about them; they serve
only (in all wise mens Opinions) to show
the weakness of his Cause, the Distemper
of his Mind, and how little able he is to
manage a Debate without Weapons from
<PB REF="6"/>
<HI>Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lingsgate.</HI> Call me what he pleases, I
am sure he can not call me <HI>Charles Oliphant.</HI>
He tells his Reader, He never intended to do
me any <HI>Harm,</HI> For which I thank him heartily,
and in Return I tell him, that neither he nor
any body else, ever dar'd to do me au inju∣ry,
which I cou'd six upon him, which I
would not resent as became a <HI>Gentleman.</HI>
For <HI>that fellow,</HI> and such like Compliments,
I have not much to say. I do not design to
bring in any into this Quarrel, but those who
will necessarly intrude themselves; And I
think Vanity alone, sufficient to poison the
best Qualities belonging to the greatest men:
But one thus provok'd wou'd say something,
that he might not be acconted Stupid; And
therefore, without any further Ceremony, I
tell <HI>C. O.</HI> that I reckon my self his Superior
in every thing, for which one Gentleman is
justly more valuable than another; And I
challenge him to instance, wherein he thinks
the Advantage or Equality lyes on his Side.
There were once a few <HI>Problems</HI> of the mixt
kind, and of some use both in <HI>Philosophie</HI>
and <HI>Medicin</HI> which were hinted at in <HI>A. P</HI>'s
<HI>Dissertations</HI> and <HI>The New Theory of Fevers,</HI>
propos'd to him in may Name, to shew he
did perfectly understand ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther of these
Books: They were indeed such easie triffles,
<PB REF="7"/>
that I shou'd have been asham'd, to have of∣fered
them to any body else; But I knew a
<HI>Proposition</HI> of <HI>Euclid</HI> wou'd be too hard for
him; He very wisely declin'd 'em, disdain∣ing
to receive a Challenge from such a Hand:
But ev'ry body saw into the Matter, had he
been able for 'em, we had heard of it; For
ev'ry one knows that it is not the Hand from
whom they are sent, but the Usefullness of
the things, &amp; the Difficulty of their <HI>Investi∣gation,</HI>
that is to be considered in such Mat∣ters.
I can when he pleases send hin a Score
such, of much greater difficulty, and of excel∣lent
use in <HI>Medicine,</HI> any one of which if he
will undertake to solve of himself, we shall
grant him to be <HI>non adeo</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as he
brags: On the other Hand. If he will please
to send me One, either relating to <HI>Philosophie,
Mathematicks</HI> or <HI>Medicine,</HI> which himself
can solve and I decline, I shall Subscibe my
self <HI>that little Pedan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> he is pleas'd to call me.
All he has said, or can say against me or any
thing I have written, shou'd never have pro∣vok'd
me once to put Pen to Paper in Answer.
I despise him too much, to have honour'd
him with a Reply; For I do not value what
they think of me, who can think well of <HI>C.
O.</HI> But when my <HI>Friend</HI> was injured, and at
the same time render'd uncapable of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="8"/>
himself right, by business of the greatest im∣portance
to Mankind, I was willing to throw
away a few leisure Hours, to expose the
Weakness and Malice of his Adversary.</P>
<P>I was once resolv'd to have treated <HI>C. O.</HI>
and his Labours only in <HI>Ridicule,</HI> and to
have diverted the Reader at his Expense,
without entring upon any thing that was se∣rious;
But upon second Thoughts, I consi∣dered
that such a way of handling Matters,
was more in the power of a <HI>Player</HI> or a <HI>Fid∣ler,</HI>
than that of even the most accomplished
<HI>Philosopher;</HI> That to form a just and true
Knowledge of <HI>Nature,</HI> requir'd much La∣bour
and industry, close thinking and Ap∣plication,
an exact Knowledge of <HI>Geometry</HI>
and <HI>Numbers,</HI> and nice Observations on the
manifold Appearances; But that toward a
<HI>Jester</HI> or <HI>Punster,</HI> there went nothing but
much Forwardness, a triffling Humor and a
wanton Fancy; And upon this Consideration,
I resolv'd to lay the Debate upon the right
Foot, and to make it go down with those
who will not concern themselves about our
Matters, I have giv'n several Hints of a Jus∣ter
and newer manner of Explaining some
Appearances in the <HI>Animal OEconomy,</HI> than
has hitherto been published.</P>
<P><PB REF="9"/>
<HI>C. O.</HI> is very angry with me, for speaking
so advantagiously of <HI>A. P.</HI> in the <HI>New
Theory of Fevers:</HI> I do not intend here to
make his <HI>Panegyrick;</HI> I may perhaps have a
fitter Occasion to acknowledge my Obligati∣ons
to him; But this I can say, that what I
there spoke of him, was not meant in Pre∣judice
of any, who might lay a just Claim to
a share of the Gratitude of their Countrey,
for improving <HI>Medicine</HI> or any other Art or
Science in it. I cou'd instance a great many
of other Countries, who have publickly said
much more to his Advantage, than I did. If
some other Physicians of our Countrey (whom
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will not mention, without their own per∣mission)
had made the same Complaint,
ho' they had no reason given them so to do,
had had less to say; But of all <HI>Scots-men</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>O.</HI> had the least reason to quarrel this:
For him (whose Talent may ly in passing
a smutty Jest, singing a Bawdy Song, or
puning a little profainly on <HI>Religion,</HI> or so)
to take this so very highly, I think very
surprising: I assure him if I must flatter, these
are not the Endowments I mean to bedawb.
I ow Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> all the Acknowledgments
in the World, for if ever I be able to do any
thing in <HI>Medicine,</HI> it was by him the Foun∣dations
were laid, and by his incouragment
<PB REF="10"/>
and Conversation I profited more, than by
that of all Mankind's besides: But I neither
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow him nor any body else, Obligations of any
other Nature, which I am not able to repay
in their own Coin: And Time will discover,
whether he has laid out his Civilities on <HI>C.
O.</HI> (who ows him as much as one Man can
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow Another) or me to best Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>C. O</HI> complains he is not allou'd the same
Liberty of <HI>Philosophising</HI> that others take;
But realy I think, they are his best Friends
who hold his Hands fastest: Edg'd Tools ought
to be kept from <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Mad-men;</HI>
and <HI>C. O.</HI> shou'd no more be suffered to use
Pen, and Ink, than to Swallow <HI>Ratsbane</HI>
or <HI>Hemlock;</HI> for the one will no more infal∣libly
take away his Life, than the other will
ruin his Reputation, which most prefer to
Life it self. I have sufficiently discovered in
the <HI>New Theory of Fevers</HI> how ridiculously
he has blundred on that Head; And I appeal
to any one who pretends to understand the
Matter (even not excepting himself) after
they have considered the following Sheets,
whether he has said any thing to the Pur∣pose
in his late Performances. <HI>C. O.</HI> might
have stoln through this sinful World with a
Reputation Unquestion'd, because never en∣quir'd
into, had it not been for Writing; he
<PB REF="11"/>
might have liv'd unthought of and unhear'd
of dy'd, had it not been for the Press: It is
true, he had plum'd himself with Foreign
Feathers; He had made a Bustle and an ado;
Spoke things he did not understand, and pre∣tended
to what he did not know; But that
was only in a Corner or among his Translators,
who took things on Trust; or if he mistook
his Man, People were well natur'd, and did
not much incline to <HI>Knight-errantry;</HI> They
thought it wiser to flatter Fools than fight
them, and they pretended no <HI>Call</HI> to humble
Pretending <HI>Quacks</HI> or dispoil Vain <HI>Jack-daws:</HI>
But when he once dar'd to attack his Superi∣ors,
he sees what is come on't; But now his
Hand is in, I'd advise him to scrible on,
<Q>He that is down can fall no lower.</Q></P>
<P>He values himself mightily, that the Lan∣guage
of his first <HI>Volume</HI> was suspected to be
a <HI>Friend's</HI> of his, whom he takes Occasion
most invidously to bedawb, with a Load of
false Paint; And how he hugs himself in this
Suspicion, as he calls it! But I am strangly
surprised, he should have shown himself so
little acquainted with Mankind, as to ima∣gin
the <HI>Philologist</HI> wou'd let such a Heap of
Fine Words pass under another's Name; He
had too much Vanity<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and too little Sincerity
for that; Besides, did he not see that the
<PB REF="12"/>
Texture of the Whole betray'd too much of
the <HI>Pedant,</HI> and smell'd too rank of the <HI>Birch,</HI>
not to discover the <HI>Interpreter,</HI> the <HI>Purpu∣reus
late qui splendeat unus &amp; alter, assui∣tur
pannus,</HI> wou'd have infallibly directed us▪
The Seams are too course, and the Tacking<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of these Glittering Raggs too little artfull
not to have fixt before our Eyes that Man
of <HI>Meer Memory:</HI> It is true, the <HI>Author</HI> and
his <HI>Translator</HI> are so very alike (which is
generaly the Foundation of Friendship) that
it might have been suspected, they wou'd have
keept one anothers Secrets; But I can al∣ways
lay an Ods on <HI>Natur's</HI> Side; The <HI>Phi∣lologist</HI>
cou'd not bear it, for all their Resem∣blance,
in the Vanity of their Tempers, the
Insolence of their Behaviour, and their Ingra∣titude
to their best Friends; Out it wou'd
what Part each club'd toward the Production
of the <HI>Brat.</HI> The <HI>Translators Character</HI> and
<HI>Legend</HI> is too well known, to be here insist∣ed
on.</P>
<Q><L>(<HI>I' th' most sincere Advice he ever gave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>He had a Grudging still to be a knave</HI>)</L></Q>
<P>And he is too far below the Dignity both
of <HI>Verse</HI> and <HI>Prose,</HI> to merit any further
Notice: I shall dismiss him with this Ad∣vice
<HI>viz.</HI> That he continue to encourage the
Absence of his <HI>Pupils,</HI> that by their <HI>Mulcts</HI>
<PB REF="13"/>
he may have the Heart to purchase a <HI>Faber</HI> (the
Stock whereby he drives his Critical Trade)
of his own, and be able to drink <HI>Genever</HI> at
Home, and not meddle with things without
his Sphere and beyond the reach of his Ca∣pacity.
<HI>C. O.</HI> has done Abundance of Hon∣our
to our Conutry in pawming upon the
World his <HI>Translator,</HI> as our Ablest Judge
in both the Learn'd Languages: If he be our
best <HI>Critick,</HI> and the <HI>Translation</HI> the best E∣vidence
of his Abilities, I shall say no more,
but that we are in a very hopeful Way.</P>
<P>In Fine, All I wou'd beg of 'em both, is,
that if I must have an Answer to these <HI>Remarks,</HI>
they wou'd not be rash, but before they com∣mit
themselves to the wide World again,
they wou'd consult some Honest Friend,
(if any such they have) who at least has
Common Sense, understands <HI>Euclide</HI> and has
read <HI>Bartholine,</HI> And then they shall have
their Humble Servant at Command.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS
Upon Two Pamphlets, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE main objections made by <HI>C. O.</HI> a∣gainst
<HI>A. P's. Dissertations</HI> are those
two, 1. That they are no ways useful
to the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>Medicine</HI> 2. That they are
stoln from others namely from <HI>Borelli</HI> and
<HI>Bellini.</HI></P>
<P>As to the first, I'd gladly know, who told
<HI>C. O.</HI> that <HI>A. P's.</HI> only design in writing
these <HI>Dissertations,</HI> was to promote the
<HI>practice</HI> of <HI>Medicine:</HI> If there be other uses
and that very good ones too, of these his,
<HI>Works,</HI> it can not be said, that he has laid
out his pains to no purpose. Wherefore ab∣stracting
at present from the advantages to
be reap'd thence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>Medi∣cine,</HI>
I will tell him two very good uses of
<HI>A. P</HI>'s. <HI>Dissertations.</HI> 1. They are a genu∣ine
explication, of some of the noblest and
least accounted for <HI>appearances</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI>
and on this score <HI>A. P.</HI> comes into share in
<PB N="2" REF="15"/>
the gratitude and regard of all honest and in∣genious
men, with Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hu∣gens,
Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini,</HI> and many others,
who have labour'd to instruct our minds, and
explain the wonders of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P>2. These <HI>Dissertations,</HI> with those of the
like nature, serve to demonstrat the <HI>Infinit
wisdom</HI> of the <HI>CONTRIVER</HI> of the <HI>Universe,</HI>
of which the animal body is the noblest part;
That <HI>GOD ALMIGHTY</HI> has adjusted the
whole <HI>Fabrick</HI> by weight and measure; that
the same <HI>uniformity</HI> and <HI>simplicity,</HI> shine
through all his <HI>works</HI> of <HI>wonder;</HI> that the
same laws of <HI>Mechanism</HI> are observed in the
lesser, as in the greater bodies of this <HI>Sy∣steme:</HI>
In a word that the same effects fol∣low,
and the same <HI>appearances</HI> mani∣fest
themselves, as if <HI>Infinit wisdom</HI> had
directed their secret springs and given them
their first impulses. But perhaps this may
be the reason why <HI>C. O.</HI> despises such things;
However his <HI>singular taste</HI> will be no rule to
the wiser and better part of mankind. If an
<HI>humble servant of his</HI> should undertake to de∣monstrat,
<HI>That there are evident footsteps
of Infinit wisdom, to be trat'd in the ranging
figures and motions of the Celestial bodies, in
general, and of each planet in particular; in
the frame and figure of this our Globe, and in
<PB N="3" REF="16"/>
the Texture and Mechanism of Animals, Ve∣getables
and Minerals; in the alternations of
Seasons and Tides, and in the propagation of
Light and Sound; in the causes of the Vari∣ations
of Heat and Cold, and in many other
particular appearances in this our Systeme of
things,</HI> borrowing the instances already sug∣gested
by <HI>A. P</HI> and these other forementi∣oned
<HI>Authors,</HI> (and they will indeed plen∣tifully
supply him) he wou'd think him∣self
but hardly dealt by, if the rest of man∣kind
shou'd treat him as <HI>C. O.</HI> has done <HI>A. P.</HI></P>
<P>It is very observable, that such Vermine
have occasioned more <HI>Posthumous</HI> works of
ingenious men, than all the Diseases in the
Bills of Mortality: For few men care for
having their labours only for their pains,
and losing their quiet to the bargain: And
these very considerations are at this very time
in hazard of robing us, of one of the noblest
and most useful pieces of <HI>Philosophie,</HI> I mean
Mr. <HI>Newton's</HI> Treatises of <HI>Light and Colours.</HI>
Now if these uses of <HI>A. P</HI>'s. <HI>Dissertations</HI>
be good ones, I would beg leave to ask,
what <HI>C. O</HI>'s two <HI>Elaborat pieces</HI> are good for;
If <HI>A. P</HI>'s <HI>Dissertations</HI> be useful for other
purposes than that of the <HI>practice of Medi∣cine,</HI>
and if he wrote them with this design,
then <HI>C. O.</HI> has said nothing to the purpose,
<PB N="4" REF="17"/>
and his <HI>Surprising Sally</HI> into Print, serving
neither to instruct nor direct (the common
design of all the rest of mankind in writing)
after the filing and finishing of his two
<HI>Translators</HI> and the rest of the profound as∣sisting
<HI>Club,</HI> will be found only to betray
the weakest malice and the most consummate
ingratitude.</P>
<P>Ay, but says <HI>C. O.</HI> Dr. P. calls his Book
<HI>Dissertationes Medicae,</HI> and it has acquired
him a mighty reputation which has hugely
encreas'd his <HI>gains by practice,</HI> to the great
detriment of the <HI>COMPLAINER.</HI> (<HI>Hint
illae Lachrymae!</HI>) And seeing <HI>C. O.</HI> has prov'd
that these <HI>Dissertations</HI> are no ways usefull
to the <HI>Practice of Medicine,</HI> he would cun∣ningly
have his Reader to infer, that all <HI>A.
P's Patients</HI> ought to leave him and employ
the <HI>COMPLAINER.</HI> This is the true state
of the affair, whatever face <HI>O.</HI> may put u∣pon
it. We shall now therefore consider
how just this bold Charge is; In order to
which we ought to reflect,</P>
<P>1. That it would be very rash to conclude
that such discoveries are useless towards such
ends, because we had not as yet discovered
their uses toward these ends. Neither one
man nor a few are sufficient to perfect a
Science: When the <HI>Load-Stone</HI> was first found
<PB N="5" REF="18"/>
out, none knew that it would prove of such
use in <HI>Navigation;</HI> Nor when the <HI>Cycloid</HI>
was first taken notice of, that it would per∣fect
<HI>Clock-Work:</HI> When <HI>Harvey</HI> first show'd
the necessity of the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Blood,</HI>
he did not forsee that it wou'd ascertain the
Doctrine of <HI>Blood-letting</HI> and <HI>Secretions.</HI> Nei∣ther
does <HI>C. O.</HI> know, but that <HI>A. P.</HI> (be∣sides
what he has already done that way) or
some body for him, may apply his Theorems
to the weightiest concerns of Practice. Be∣sides,
admitting the Doctrine of the <HI>Circula∣tion</HI>
of the <HI>Blood,</HI> had not much altered the
<HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Physick;</HI> Nor <HI>Malpigi's</HI> and <HI>Grew's</HI>
Anatomy of Plants, much improv'n Gard'n∣ing;
Yet none but <HI>C. O.</HI> will condemn these
as useless Speculations. But</P>
<P>2. I wou'd fain know how it follows,
because these <HI>Dissertations</HI> do not improve
<HI>C. O</HI>'s practice, (as I really believe they do
not, because he does not understand 'em)
that therefore they do not improve <HI>A. P</HI>'s.
For if he do affirm they do, (and he is not
obliged to show how, for that were indeed
to let <HI>C. O.</HI> know as much as himself) I'm
sure <HI>C. O.</HI> cannot disprove it. Me thinks
<HI>C. O.</HI> shou'd have a better opinion of <HI>A. P's</HI>
practice, for all who know them both, can∣not
be Ignorant, that it is to the imitation
<PB N="6" REF="19"/>
of it, <HI>C. O.</HI> ows that liquor which has in∣spir'd
him to kick against his <HI>Master.</HI></P>
<P>3. The true state of the debate is, Whe∣ther,
<HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> a <HI>Mathematician</HI> who
knows the Reason of what he does, and
consequently can accomodat his art to all
particular emergencies, wou'd not make a
better Sailer, than a meer Tar, who works
like a Machine, as he is acted by Powers un∣known
to him; and who, if he be put out
of his Road by any unforseen accident, knows
not what to do: Or whether <HI>Captain Halley's</HI>
conduct of a Ship to the <HI>East</HI> or <HI>West Indies,</HI>
were not more to be trusted to, than that of
the <HI>Masters</HI> of some little Frigat, who ne∣ver
read a Book but his Sea mans Almanack.
If <HI>C. O</HI>'s advice were to be taken, he wou'd
give it in favours of the last, for more rea∣sons
than one: For you must know, <HI>That wor∣thy
and usefully learned Gentleman,</HI> stole
from <HI>C. O.</HI> (if you'll believe himself) the
<HI>Solution</HI> of the <HI>universal dioptrick probleme,</HI>
printed in the <HI>Transactions.</HI> I will not say
(for manners sake) with his dear Friend,
(<HI>i. e.</HI> himself) the elegant Translator of
<HI>his devise</HI> in the <HI>Frontis-peice</HI> of the Refuta∣tion,
that he
<Q>With Impudence averrs damn'd lyes,</Q>
<PB N="7" REF="20"/>
But this I will say for <HI>C. O.</HI> that he does
not understand the first steps of the <HI>Investiga∣tion</HI>
of that <HI>probleme,</HI> nor can so much as hint
the <HI>Lemmata</HI> necessary to them. I would ad∣vise
<HI>C. O.</HI> for the Future, to chuse his com∣pany
better, and take <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s way (both
in Medicine and Mathematicks)
<Q><L>Who much of either did afford</L>
<L>To those who never had a word.</L></Q></P>
<P>However, to show you that he was not
<HI>adeo</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, he tells you that a false
<HI>Thecvie</HI> in <HI>Medicine,</HI> can do no more hurt
to the <HI>Practice</HI> thereof, than the false Hypo∣thesis
of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> or <HI>Tycho,</HI> can wrong <HI>Navi∣gation.</HI>
For my part I hate all false things
whatsoever; Both false <HI>Theories</HI> and false
<HI>Friends,</HI> and all those who plead for them:
But I'd very gladly know, who helpt <HI>C. O.</HI>
to this Similitude, for I'm sure he can nei∣ther
prove the <HI>Ptolomaick</HI> nor <HI>Tychonick</HI> Sy∣stemes
true nor false; Nor that their Truth
nor Falsehood, can either promote or hinder
the Emprovement of <HI>Navigation.</HI> And that
this is not <HI>Maliciously</HI> said, I offer my self
to defend against him, that the <HI>Tychonick
Systeme</HI> is true, and that the Determination
of the true one would promote <HI>Navigation;</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="21"/>
providing he take no assistance but from his
own rich Stock (I do not mean of <HI>Impudence</HI>
but) of <HI>LEARNING.</HI> However, as to the only
thing which he must point to in this <HI>Similitude,</HI>
namely whether the <HI>Earth</HI> or the <HI>Sun</HI> moves,
(for if he understand the whole <HI>Systeme</HI> of
the <HI>Planets,</HI> his assertion is absolutly false:
For every one besides himself knows, that a
perfect Theory and Exact Tables of the <HI>Moon</HI>
would compleat the <HI>Longitude,</HI> the main <HI>de∣sideratum</HI>
in <HI>Navigation</HI>) It is no more to
the purpose, than if he had said, it matters
not to the cure of the diseases of the Head,
whether the under Jaw-bone move the upper
being fixt, or the upper Jaw-bone move the
under being fixt. Neither indeed does it,
nor do any such remote <HI>appearances</HI> influence
particular ones. But as in <HI>Navigation,</HI> (to
keep near his <HI>Similitude</HI>) from the precepts
of <HI>Geometers,</HI> a <HI>Tar</HI> may make an <HI>observa∣tion,</HI>
and go by the help thereof to his tables,
to bring out the Numbers for his <HI>Latitude</HI>
in general cases; But if a particular emergen∣cy
which is not included in his Rules, (And
every one knows that such dayly occur, not
can precepts reach all particular cases)
should happen, he is at his wits end, and
can go no farther; Whereas a <HI>Mathematici∣an,</HI>
who besides the <HI>Practice,</HI> understands
<PB N="9" REF="22"/>
the <HI>Theory,</HI> will find <HI>Expedients</HI> for all <HI>E∣mergencies,</HI>
&amp; show his Skill most where the
Difficulty is greatest. And this is one princi∣pal
Difference, as to the Practice of all Kinds,
betwixt a meer <HI>Mechanick</HI> and a true <HI>Philo∣sopher,</HI>
who can both think and act. Just
so <HI>C. O.</HI> from the long and familiar Conver∣sation
<HI>A. P.</HI> has allow'd him, may have
learn'd to practise in common and general
Cases, much after the same Manner <HI>A. P.</HI>
does; But when an uncommon Case happens,
or a common Distemper is compounded with
others; When a new Disease arises<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or an old
changes some of its principal Symptoms
(and we know all these dayly fall out) one
Difference (there are a million of others as
<HI>C. O.</HI> numbers) betwixt <HI>A. P.</HI> and <HI>C. O.</HI>
or (which is the same as shall be afterward
shown) betwixt a true Physician and a very
Quack, may be evidently discovered. But</P>
<P>4. Has not <HI>A. P.</HI> in all his <HI>Dissertations</HI>
shown, how such and such <HI>Theoremes</HI> he has
there demonstrated, serve either to overthrow
the bad <HI>Practice</HI> of some, or to confirm the
Sound Practice of others; or lastly, to sug∣gest
one different from any yet used<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Has he
not hinted a better <HI>Practice</HI> in the <HI>Gutta sere∣na</HI>
&amp; <HI>Suffusio oculi,</HI> than the very common
one by <HI>Collyria</HI> and such like stuff from a de∣monstrated
<PB N="10" REF="23"/>
<HI>Theory</HI> of these Diseases? Does
not the true Doctrine of <HI>Secretions</HI> which he
has advanced, teach u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two things of very
great Importance in the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Medicine,
viz.</HI> That the Encreasing of one <HI>Secretion</HI> will
respectively lessen all the others, and that
any <HI>Miasma</HI> may be evacuated by any secre∣tion
whatsoever? These two <HI>Theoremes</HI> right∣ly
understood and discreedy apply'd, will
form a Sounder Practice, than some Volums
of <HI>Observations.</HI> Do not these, together
with another he has taught, <HI>viz.</HI> that all Ob∣structions
must necessarly happen in the
<HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Arteries,</HI> tend to shorten the Study
of <HI>Medicine,</HI> making that plain sense, which
in most Books is nothing but a Heap of hard
Words without any distinct Meaning, and to
contract Physicians Bills into one half of what
they used to be, when the Fashion was to
write, rather for the Benefit of the <HI>Apothe∣cary</HI>
than the <HI>Patient.</HI> Do they not teach
<HI>Physicians</HI> to lav the stress of the cure of most
Distempers, on some Evacuation to be pro∣moted,
such as <HI>Blood-letting, Vomiting, Purg∣ing,
Sweating, Salivation, Perspiration, Fo∣mentation,
Bathing, Blistring</HI> and the other
Varieties or Compositions of these Secretions?
Does not the knowledg of the manner how
<HI>Mercury, Steel</HI> and other attenuating or <HI>Anti∣scurbutical
<PB N="11" REF="24"/>
Medicines</HI> work, and by what
Properties they bring about the design'd Ef∣fects,
teach us in what Diseases and in what
circumstances they must be used, and in what
Quantities administred, and serve to over∣throw
the Pretences of <HI>Qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks,</HI> who brag of
curing some malignant Distempers by Medi∣cines,
which can only palliat, but are not endu∣ed
with force, sufficient to root out the Ma∣lady?
Does not the true Knowledge of the
manner &amp; Organs of <HI>Respiration,</HI> inform us
in the true nature of all the <HI>Epidemick Dis∣eases,</HI>
which depend on the several Varieties
of the Elasticity and Gravity of the Air, and
suggest a sound Practice in all <HI>Pestilential</HI>
and <HI>Consumptive</HI> Cases, where the Lungs
and Stomach are principally affected? Does
not the Knowledge of the true Man∣ner
of Digestion, overthrow the Admi∣nistration
of Med'cines to correct the fer∣ment
of the Stomach, and teach us that the
most universal <HI>Preservative</HI> of Health, and
<HI>Preventive</HI> of most Diseases, whose Causes
are internal, is either by the cleansing the
<HI>primae Viae</HI> by Vomits and Purges, or by aug∣menting
the Muscular Force of their Fibres
by sutable <HI>Liquors</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> or lastly by
administring Food, that needs little or no
Comminution as <HI>Broths, Jellies, Milks</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="12" REF="25"/>
Has he not <HI>Pag.</HI> 115. Suggested the Method
of the Cure of <HI>Sleepy Distempers</HI> from his
own Principles? Has he not shown, that
the celebrated Distinction of <HI>Acids</HI> and <HI>Al∣cali</HI>'s,
serve neither to explain the nature of
Diseases, nor to suggest a true Method of
Cure, but that the faculties of Medicines and
the Nature of Diseases, are to be brought
from other guess Principles. This is a short
hint of the <HI>Improvements</HI> of the <HI>Practice</HI> of
<HI>Medicine,</HI> which <HI>A. P.</HI> has deducte'd from
evident principles by found reasoning: And
tho' perhaps it may be thought, that the
same Methods have been follow'd in the
Practice of Medicine by good Physicians,
both before he published his <HI>Dissertations</HI> and
since that time, without his Principles; Yet
it must be granted me, that what was be∣fore
only Guessing or (as it is still by some
reproach'd) a conjectural Art, is now rend∣red
scientifical, and he has confuted beyond
any possibility of a Reply, the idle pretences
of those who pursue other Methods. There
are many other noble Hints for promoting a
sound practice in his Works, which those
only will discover who read his Book with
Candor, and come instructed with the prepa∣ratory
Sciences; of both which <HI>C. O.</HI> has no
very large Share. But</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="26"/>
5. The true Reason, why we do not at pre∣sent
reap all the Advantages in Practice from
<HI>Mechanick Theories,</HI> which they are capable
of bringing, is, that as yet, even for all the
Performances of these three or four learned
Men, whose principal Design it was to im∣prove
the <HI>Theory</HI> of <HI>Medicine,</HI> The whole
<HI>Animal aeconomy</HI> is not perfected, much less
are the Faculties of the <HI>Materia medica,</HI> and
the manner of their Operation, distinctly and
fully discovered and explain'd; And till both
these come to pass, and the mutual Depen∣dence
of the one upon the other be put in a
clear Light, we cannot expect to have a per∣fect
Practice: But notwithstanding of this,
He is no less to be esteem'd a Promoter of
Medicine, who discovers a New <HI>Theoreme</HI>
or <HI>Probleme</HI> in either of these Parts, than he
is to be accounted an Improver of the <HI>Ma∣thematicks,</HI>
who discovers and demonstrates
any Theoreme or Probleme in any of its se∣veral
Branches. And</P>
<P>6. Lastly, since every one who practises
Medicine, founds his Practice upon some
one Theory or other, (unless it be <HI>C. O.</HI>
and the rest of the Honourable Society of
Quacks, who will not so much as consider
what they do, least they shou'd turn that in∣to
Murder, which else wou'd be only Chance-medley
<PB N="14" REF="27"/>
or Man-slaughter) The debate then
is brought to this Issue, whether one who
practises by a certain demonstrable <HI>Theory,</HI>
be not to be esteem'd a truer Physician, than
one who practises by a false Precarious and
Contradictory one; Or (seeing a False The∣ory
is worse and more Prejudicial to Pra∣ctice
than none at all) whether an able Phy∣sician,
be not to be trusted too rather than a
meer Quack. <HI>C. O.</HI> is of this last Opinion, and
may he Eternally persist in it: which is all
the harm I wish Him.</P>
<P>But oh, says <HI>C. O.</HI> there are a Million of
other things more necessary to be known,
than such an accurate Knowledge of Animal
aeconomy. But pray good <HI>C. O.</HI> where has
<HI>A. P.</HI> or any of his little Pedants Insinuated,
that they despis'd or disapprov'd of the Study
of these Million of other things; Or (since
you will most valiantly oppose your self on∣ly
to <HI>A. P.</HI>) which of these Million of other
things, dare you pretend to know better
than <HI>A. P.</HI> I'll engage, distinctly to enume∣rate
a million of things which <HI>A. P.</HI> knows,
of which you are not only Ignorant, but inca∣pable,
when you name one thing which you
know and <HI>A. P.</HI> does not: Wherefore if
<HI>A P.</HI> knows the million of other things in∣finitly
better than you, and understands ac∣curatly
<PB N="15" REF="28"/>
the Animal aeconomy to the Bargain,
which Knowledge (to speak in the Language
of the Schools) you are not only depriv'd of,
but ev'n deny'd by Nature, I think none will
be at a Loss where to give the Preference.</P>
<P>To a Reader not acquainted with <HI>C. O</HI>'s
Temper and way, it wou'd seem as if he took
up Arms in Defence of his Injur'd Brethren
and Sisters, the <HI>Qûacks, Mountebanks, Gard'∣ners</HI>
and <HI>Midwives;</HI> But whoever entertains
this Opinion of him, hugely injures him; for
he'll fight for nothing but his OWN DEAR
SELF. Besides, He has a profoundly blind re∣spect
for the Mathematicks and Mechanical
Philosophie, he most implicitly believes in
'em, and is ally'd to 'em more ways than
one; And his only Motive for writting thus,
was to be reveng'd on <HI>A. P.</HI> for overtopping
him so far in Reputation, but especially in
Practice. It is true, the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> (as
much their Friend as he is) have received
some Harm in the <HI>Scuffle;</HI> But that was for
their being too hard for him, and for their
enabling a certain <HI>Little Pedant who talks
of a Curve, a Quadrature and a Series,</HI> to rein
and spurr him as he pleases, and to make
him believe Black's white, and White's black,
just as he has a Mind to it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29"/>
Any one who considers <HI>C. O</HI>'s many Contra∣dictions
with himself, sometimes railing at,
other times commending (but a little awk∣wardly)
this kind of Learning, may evident∣ly
see, that <HI>C. O.</HI> wou'd willingly part with
all his <HI>Million of other things,</HI> to understand
but the Millionth part of that Kind of Learn∣ing,
which <HI>A. P.</HI> and his little Pedants know;
Which since he never can (like <HI>Montaign</HI>
with Nobility) <HI>he takes his Revenge on it,
by railing heartily at it.</HI> The Author of <HI>A∣pollo
Mathematicus</HI> managed the like Cause
much more <HI>Cavalierly,</HI> He told plainly that
the applying <HI>Mathematicks</HI> to <HI>Physick</HI> was
<HI>Conjuring, Astrology, Witchcraft, Raising the
Devil</HI> and all that; He shows how ridiculous
it is to pretend to cure diseases by <HI>Squares</HI> and
<HI>Triangles;</HI> He greatly despises and heartily
hates every thing that bears the resemblance
of a <HI>Scheme</HI> or a <HI>Figure;</HI> But for a <HI>Vir non
adeo</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to rail at such kind of
Learning, <HI>Even when it never intended to do
him any harm,</HI> is so little and mean, that I
cannot sufficiently admire, how he <HI>Physick'd</HI>
himself into it. I can tell him one thing,
that the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> take it very ill at his
Hands, to have been thus abus'd by their old
Friend and manifold <HI>All<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> And for the Ter∣ror
of others who may in Time to come of∣fend
<PB N="17" REF="30"/>
in like Manner have decreed, that <HI>C.
O.</HI> and his <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>English Translators</HI> shall
never get over <HI>Pons Asinorum</HI> in their days.</P>
<P>Thus I think I have sufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly answered
<HI>C O's</HI> first Objection, and if the second prove
no fitter <HI>Engine</HI> to Buoy his sinking Reputa∣tion
and declining Practice, I'm afraid that
in a Short Time he be reduc'd to the condition
of being only admir'd by himself and his
<HI>Translators,</HI> and employ'd by the <HI>Ladies</HI> of
the <HI>Cowgate.</HI> Let us now therefore consider
his second Objection; In Order to which it
will not be am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss to premise this General
Answer to all his <HI>Cavills</HI> of this kind <HI>viz</HI> that
allowing <HI>A. P,</HI> had taken any Hints from
<HI>Borelli</HI> or <HI>Bellini,</HI> and had improv'd them to
good Purpose as he has done, and had set
the whole Affair in a clearer <HI>Light,</HI> is he not
to be commended for so doing? Or wou'd
any thing except <HI>C. O.</HI> have blam'd him?
All who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e read <HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini's</HI>
Works carefully, can't but see that the <HI>Lat∣ter</HI>
has borrow d more from the <HI>Former,</HI> than
<HI>A. P.</HI> has done from <HI>either:</HI> And sure I am,
none ever twitted that <HI>Great Man</HI> with this,
except they have been of <HI>C. O's. Kidney.</HI> I
cou'd adduce many Instances in men of the
greatest and fairest Characters among the
<HI>Learned,</HI> who might have taken Hints from
<PB N="18" REF="31"/>
one another; But no Man of Ingenuity ever
condemn'd them for so doing, if they either
extended the borrow'd Notion, or apply'd it
to Purposes unthought of by him who first
advanc d it, or lastly gave it a Finer Turn
and set it in a Better Light: And if <HI>A. P.</HI> has
taken any thing from these two <HI>Fathers</HI> of
the <HI>Mechanical Medicine,</HI> all honest men
who understand their several Performances,
will allow that it his lost nothing in his
Hands. They oft deserve better of Man∣kind,
who unite the scattered Parts of a Sci∣ence,
&amp; make the whole Affair of a Piece, &amp;
show the Connexion of one Part upon ano∣ther,
than those who were the Inventors of
the several Branches. But besides, Is it not
very ordinary to see those who reason justly
from different <HI>Methods,</HI> fall into the same
Conclusions, without borrowing the least
Hint from one another or knowing of one
anothers Designs? This happens dayly in
those Matters to which <HI>Mathematicks</HI> can be
apply'd: And tho' the first <HI>Discoverer</HI> must
be reckon'd the <HI>Publick Inventer,</HI> yet the se∣cond
may justly pretend to a Share in the
<HI>Glory,</HI> if he is known to have brought it out
of his own <HI>Fond.</HI> I heartily wish there were
many who stole at <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Rate, I'm sure
<HI>Medicine</HI> in a Short Time wou'd make another
<PB N="19" REF="32"/>
Appearance than it now does. But as to the
Particulars objected,</P>
<P>I. The plain meaning of that Place in <HI>A.
P</HI>'s. <HI>Dissertations</HI> viz. <HI>Posth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c facilius pote∣rimus
dijudicare.</HI> &amp;c. whose mystery <HI>C. O.</HI>
cou'd not unfold, is briefly this. Says <HI>A. P.</HI>
Now that we know <HI>Secretions</HI> to be perform'd
after so plain and intelligible a Manner, the
Half of our Business is done; for there re∣mains
nothing to be enquir'd into, but to
find <HI>Medicines,</HI> not of a numerous and com∣plicated
Train of Qualities, as was formerly
believ'd, but of a few simple ones, which
may answer to these Motions whereby the
respective <HI>Secretions</HI> are perform'd. Thus
he not only shorrens the Study of Medicine,
but points at the true <HI>Enquires:</HI> And that
this is his Meaning, is evident from what
follows <HI>viz. Neq; enim nihil erit artis
longae cultori ingenuo ad tot perpetuos com∣pilatores
damnari.</HI> So that <HI>C. O</HI>'s. Quaint
<HI>Conundrum</HI> about <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ureticks</HI> and <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phore∣ticks</HI>
is intirely his own, and much good may
it do him.</P>
<P>II. There are so many <HI>Ingenious</HI> and even
new <HI>Theorems</HI> in this first <HI>Dissertation</HI> of <HI>A.
P</HI>'s. that none but <HI>C. O.</HI> wou'd pretend to un∣derstand
and despise 'em at the same Time:
He has determin'd the True Figure of the
<PB N="20" REF="33"/>
<HI>Secretory Canals</HI> from diversevery important
Considerations, and demonstrated the <HI>Conti∣nuity</HI>
of the <HI>Arteries</HI> with the <HI>Veins,</HI> which
are the two Fundamental <HI>Theo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ems</HI> upon
which all the sound Reasoning about <HI>Animal
aeconomy</HI> is builded. But says <HI>C. O. Bellini</HI>
hinted this <HI>Continuity</HI> before him; And for
Proof of this he adduces a part of the 70
Page of his book <HI>De Urinis &amp; Pulsibus.</HI>
There cannot be brought a plainer Evidence
of <HI>C. O</HI>'s. profound Ignorance in these Mat∣ters,
for it is clear not only from that place
but from the whole Discourse, that <HI>Bellini</HI>
thought only there cou'd be no <HI>Parenchima∣tous</HI>
Separation betwixt the <HI>Evanescent Ar∣teries</HI>
and <HI>Veins,</HI> as was commonly believ'd,
and that therefore they behoov'd to be <HI>Con∣tiguous</HI>
or inferred by <HI>Anastomoses</HI> into one
another. But this is far from being <HI>A. P</HI>'s.
Doctrine on this Head, for he proves that they
are not only <HI>Contiguous</HI> but <HI>Continuous</HI> to
one another, and that the very same <HI>Artery
returning</HI> becomes the <HI>Vein;</HI> And indeed
without this the Matter had been intirely
Lame, if you once suppose the <HI>Arteries</HI> and
<HI>Veins</HI> different, tho not disjoyn'd, you make
an End of the Circulation: It must be the
<HI>Continuity</HI> of the same <HI>Elastick Fibres</HI> that
must propagate the Impulse communicated
<PB N="21" REF="34"/>
to the Blood. But these were things too hard
for <HI>C. O.</HI> to conceive. Besides all these,
allowing <HI>Bellini</HI> had given the Hint of the
thing, <HI>C. O.</HI> dares not say he has prov'd it,
and no body was oblig'd to believe it upon
his bare Assertion. Nothing can or ought to
be admitted into the Number of known
Truths till it be publickly demonstrated; and
it is a fault in the Improvers of this or any o∣ther
Science, to advance any new thing with∣out
it's <HI>Demonstration;</HI> and he who supplies
this does sometimes better Service to the
Publick, than the first Inventer.</P>
<P>III. <HI>C. O.</HI> In his Remarks upon <HI>A. P's</HI> Se∣cond
<HI>Dissertation,</HI> alledges he has stolen the
Materials thereof from <HI>Borelli.</HI> If <HI>C. O.</HI> had
nam'd any other Author whatsoever at a
Venture, he cou'd not have been farther mi∣staken
than in quoting <HI>Borelli,</HI> for <HI>A. P</HI>'s. In∣structer
on this Head: <HI>Borelli's</HI> Opinion (as
will be evident to any one who reads more of
his Works than their <HI>Index</HI>) about the Man∣ner
and use of Respiration is plainly thus.
He thought that in the strugle of Birth, the
<HI>Faetus</HI> wou'd necessarly dilate the Cavity of
the Breast, whereby the Air wou'd rush in
to fill the <HI>Vesicles</HI> of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> which be∣ing
compressed by the falling down of the
Sides of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> wou'd force the Blood
<PB N="22" REF="35"/>
through the Lungs into the left <HI>Ventricle</HI> of
the Heart; In doing which some of the <HI>O∣scillatory</HI>
Air wou'd be thrust through the
Sides of the <HI>Vesicles</HI> of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and the
Sides of the <HI>Arteries</HI> into the Blood: This
last was <HI>Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elli's</HI> peculiar and darling Opini∣on,
the rest being common to every one who
spoke of these things, since the Structure of
the <HI>Lungs</HI> and the Properties of the Air
were discovered. Now <HI>C. O.</HI> out of the
Depth of <HI>Penetration,</HI> did imagine that this
was <HI>A P</HI>'s Opinion, but such things will
happen one who understands neither of their
Opinions: For 1. <HI>Borelli</HI> thought the Motion
of the Blood through the <HI>Lungs,</HI> was, when
they were Flaccid and empty of Air, as ap∣pears
from the Place quoted by <HI>C. O. Prop.</HI>
117. <HI>Postea coincidentibus</HI> &amp;c. Which is
both false and directly contrary to <HI>A. P's</HI> Opi∣nion
on this head. 2. <HI>Borelli</HI> knew nothing
of the true Figure of the <HI>Vesicles</HI> of the <HI>Lungs</HI>
when flaccid, nor when inflated, which <HI>A.
P.</HI> has hinted, and which may be <HI>Geometri∣cally</HI>
determin'd after the same manner and
from the same Principles <HI>John Bernoulli</HI> de∣termin'd
the Figure of the inflated <HI>Vesicles</HI> of
the <HI>Muscular Fibres:</HI> And the knowledge
of these Figures do mightily conduce to form
a right Notion and explain the True Nature
<PB N="23" REF="36"/>
of this <HI>Animal Function.</HI> 3. <HI>Borelli</HI> knew
nothing of the True Situation of these <HI>Vesicles</HI>
in respect of the <HI>Pulmonary Trunk</HI> viz. That
they were at <HI>Oblique Angles</HI> with the Inferi∣or,
and consequently at <HI>obtuse Angles</HI> with
the Superior part thereof when flaccid, but
that upon an Inflation, the <HI>oblique Angles</HI>
were made <HI>less oblique,</HI> and consequently the
<HI>obtuse</HI> ones <HI>less obtuse;</HI> And that all these
must happen from the <HI>Elasticity</HI> and uniform
<HI>Pressure</HI> of the inflating Air: Now the de∣termina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion
of these two <HI>viz.</HI> The Figures
and Situation of these Vesicles when flaccid
&amp; when inflated are the Hinges upon which
the <HI>Mechanicall</HI> Explica<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of this Operati∣on
can move, without which (as it happens
in all the other different Accounts of this
Matter) all is Contradiction and Nonsense
And these are the two Heads which mainly
distinguish <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Doctrine in this affair,
not only from <HI>Borelli</HI>'s but from that of all
others. 4. Lastly, <HI>Borelli</HI> was clearly mi∣staken
in the use of this Function, imagining
an <HI>osciliatory</HI> Fluid was thereby thrown into
the Blood, which he thought the principle
of Life and Motion; But this Doctrine is not
only false, but were it true, it wou'd not
serve his purpose. And now since I have
thus clearly and distinctly laid the whole
<PB N="24" REF="37"/>
matter before <HI>C O.</HI> I wou'd desire him to
assign the Assertion I have alledged which he
thinks false—Or if he wou'd take a little
good Advice from <HI>such a Fellow a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am,</HI> I'd
counsel him to let the Matter intirely alone;
For notwithstanding the Performances of these
Learned Men this Way, there is something
in the <HI>Mechanical</HI> Explication of Resp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration
which he can neither find out before it be ex∣plain'd,
nor understand it when demonstrated.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>C. O.</HI> Goes on next to <HI>A. P</HI>'s <HI>Disser∣tation</HI>
about <HI>Digestion,</HI> and out of his Aboun∣dant
Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seration to his Fellow Reader,
he will needs give an Abstract of <HI>A. P</HI>'s, Dis∣course;
In Order to which he transcribes
<HI>Borelli's</HI> Opinion about <HI>Nutrition,</HI> and this
he calls the Sum of <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Doctrine about
<HI>Digestion,</HI> and appeals to his Reader, yea to
<HI>A. P.</HI> himself with as great an assurance, as
if he were asserting an <HI>Eternal Truth.</HI></P>
<P>However <HI>Good Charles Oliphant</HI> this will
pass upon no Body but your Learned <HI>Inter∣preters;</HI>
For notwi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hstanding your Confident
Appeal, I mantain that <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Doctrine both
about Digection and Nutrition is different
from <HI>Borelli</HI>'s, and over and above that, <HI>Bo∣relli</HI>'s
Opinions in these Matters are absolute∣ly
false. As to the first it is evident that
<HI>Borelli</HI> thought <HI>Digestion</HI> was mainly per∣form'd
<PB N="25" REF="38"/>
by the Assistance of some dissolving
<HI>Menstruum</HI> or <HI>Ferment</HI> Prop 199. 2<HI>d.</HI> Part.
<HI>Postquam cibi contriti &amp; macerati fuerunt
succo fermentitio stom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chi</HI> &amp;c. Prop. 192.
Speaking of the Manner of the Digestion of
Birds, <HI>Excipiunt ambientem arenam, quam
succo fermentitio quo abundant dissolvere pos∣sunt,
ut aquae corrosiva durissimos silices &amp; me∣talla.</HI>
Prop. 189. <HI>Haec animalia ferment o quo∣dam
validissimo carnes &amp; ossa consumunt,
non secus ac aquae corrosivae metalla corrodunt
ac dissolvunt.</HI> It is true, from the Firmness,
Weight and <HI>Muscular</HI> Fibres of the <HI>Gizards</HI>
of Birds resembling that of the <HI>Heart,</HI> he
thought they might act as other <HI>Muscles;</HI>
But it is evident from the Places cited, and
many others I cou'd adduce, that he thought
the great Business of <HI>Digestion</HI> was performed
by a <HI>Ferment.</HI> Now this is so far from being
<HI>A.</HI> P's. Doctrine, that he has spent one
Half of that Discourse to confute it, and has
shown that <HI>Digestion</HI> is perform'd after a
Manner sutable to the rest of the <HI>Animal
Functions.</HI> And as to the Manner of <HI>Nu∣trition</HI>
which <HI>Borelli</HI> assigns in the Place cited
by <HI>C. O.</HI> it is absolutly false, depending (as
himself says) upon the <HI>Necessitas configu∣rationis
cribrosae,</HI> and the Exploded Notion
of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>milar Parts:</HI> This <HI>configuratio cribrosa
<PB N="26" REF="39"/>
A.</HI> P. has consuted in several of his Dis∣courses,
and the Notion of <HI>Similar Parts</HI> is
absolutly contradictory to the true Nature
of <HI>Fluids,</HI> and the Necessity of <HI>Conical</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Cylindrical</HI> Parts.</P>
<P>Is it not a little surprising to find one a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
this Time a Day, who has the Vanity to
pretend to understand the <HI>Animal oecono<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
and the discoveries made therein in this las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Age, talking at this Rate? and Imagining
this to be a true Explication of <HI>Nutrition!</HI>
Or can there be a more Evident Instance that
<HI>C. O.</HI> understands only a Few Scrapes which
he has pick'd up here and there, &amp; which he
can not tack together to make 'em look of
a Piece? I do not expect Thanks from him
(for he has publickly declar'd the contrar <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
for the Pains I am about to take to inform
him: However I'll take this Occasion to ex∣plain
the true Manner of <HI>Nutrition</HI> founded
on the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the Blood and the Na∣ture
of <HI>Secretion,</HI> and conform to A. P's
Doctrine on this Head.</P>
<P>Seing then it is certain that the <HI>Arteries</HI>
are <HI>continuous</HI> to the <HI>Veins,</HI> and seing <HI>Secre∣tion</HI>
is perform'd by the Composition of two
Motions <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>direct</HI> and a <HI>transverse</HI> one,
and that the Difference of the Secern'd Fluids
depends upon the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the <HI>Secretory
<PB N="27" REF="40"/>
C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>als,</HI> and the <HI>Velocity</HI> of the Fluid with
which it arrives at their Orifices, And lastly,
seing <HI>Nutrition</HI> is but the <HI>Secretion</HI> of
some Portion of the <HI>Arterial</HI> Fluid, to re∣pair
the <HI>Expenses</HI> of <HI>Living,</HI> It follows,
that not the <HI>Similarity</HI> of Parts but the Orifi∣ces
of the <HI>Secretories</HI> of the Nourishing
Fluid, and the respective <HI>Velocity</HI> with which
it arrives at these Orifices, is that which de∣termins
this Fluid to such and such Places,
and that it is keep'd there by the Force of
the succeeding Fluid: Moreover, seing even
the Canals themselves do encrease in Bulk,
may decay and be impair'd, every assignable
Part of the Canals must be the Terminati∣on
of some <HI>Secretory</HI> Conduit, carrying a
Fluid fit to encrease their Dimensions or re∣pair
their Losses; And these <HI>Secretory</HI> Canals
again must have others to encrease their Bulk
or repair their Losses, and so on <HI>in Infini∣tum.</HI></P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>COROLLARY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this Doctrine and several other
Topicks I can adduce (as particular∣ly
from the whole Business of Sensati∣on)
it follows that ev'ry natural <HI>Machine
i. e.</HI> all <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> whatsoever
<PB N="28" REF="41"/>
(which by the by is the <HI>Specifick</HI> Difference
betwixt the Works of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art</HI>) con∣sist
of <HI>Organs</HI> in Number actualy <HI>infinite,</HI>
and consequently require <HI>infinite</HI> Wisdom
and Power in their Contriver and Maker;
And therefore, if there be <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vege∣tables</HI>
which have not produc'd themselves,
there must of Necessity be a GOD. This
is one Argument for the Existence of the
<HI>Deity,</HI> which <HI>C. O.</HI> will not be able easily
to disprove: Perhaps the Doctrine may look
a little <HI>odd and new</HI> to him, but this is not
the only Way I cou'd surprise him, if I had
Leisure and Inclination to instruct him.</P>
<P>C. O. is very hard here upon A. P. for
not allowing Liquids any place in the solu∣tion
of this <HI>Probleme</HI> about the manner of
<HI>Digestion;</HI> This is not unlike the rest of <HI>C.
O</HI>'s Objections. <HI>A.</HI> P. was to show the internal
Forces whereby the Food was reduced to the
Fittest Form for recruiting the Blood, and
<HI>C. O.</HI> will very wisely have him take in Ex∣ternal
Assistents into the Consideration; In
my Humble Opinion this had been begging<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the Question, &amp; he might have as well taken
in the <HI>Boiling</HI> and <HI>Bakeing,</HI> the <HI>Roasting</HI> and
<HI>Frying</HI> and the other Preparations of the
<HI>Kitchin,</HI> to assist him in the <HI>Solution</HI> of this
<HI>Probleme,</HI> as that of <HI>Drinking:</HI> His Business
<PB N="29" REF="42"/>
was only to examin, if the Force of the <HI>Sto∣mach</HI>
and the other concurring <HI>Muscles</HI> was
sufficient to reduce a Solid of a Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Cohesion of Parts, unto a Mass whose Co∣hesion
was dissolved and destroy'd, and to
show that <HI>Menstrua</HI> wou'd dissolve the <HI>Sto∣mach</HI>
it self at the same Time it digested the
Food; which he has very distinctly and ac∣curatly
done: This was solving the <HI>Pro∣bleme
universally</HI> and in its worst Case ima∣ginable;
For if it was once demonstrated that
the <HI>Stomach</HI> cou'd dissolve Food without the
Concurrence of Liquors, even <HI>C. O.</HI> cou'd
infer it cou'd do it more easily with them.
But <HI>C. O.</HI> cou'd not apprehend this Manner
of solving <HI>Problems,</HI> which shows how far
he is <HI>non</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, For all who under∣stand
the first <HI>Elements</HI> of <HI>Geometry</HI> know,
that the only Way of solving a <HI>Probleme hand∣somly</HI>
and <HI>universally,</HI> is taking it in its out∣most
Extension, and in its hardest possible
Case, and requiring no more <HI>Data</HI> towards
it's Solution than what is absolutely neces∣sary,
or in <HI>A. P's</HI> Words in the preceeding
<HI>Dissertation; Nunquam tentanda <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Proble∣matis
solutio</HI> &amp;c. for which <HI>C. O.</HI> laughs at
him very heartily, and which nevertheless
is neither more nor less than what Mr. <HI>New∣ton</HI>
had said before him, <HI>Princip. Phil. Nat-Math.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="43"/>
Math. Pag, 402. <HI>Causes rerum naturalium
non plures admitti, quam que verae sunt &amp;
earum <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>baenomenis explicandis sufficiunt.</HI>
Perhaps if <HI>C. O.</HI> had known this, he wou'd
have been a little more civil to this Expres∣sion
of <HI>A. P</HI>'s out of his profound Respect
to the <HI>Mathematicks:</HI> But seriously speak∣ing,
I believe he meant nothing by this
whole <HI>Paragraph</HI> but a Piece of harmless
<HI>Diversion,</HI> and to bring in his Qaint saying

and not insisted on by him in his <HI>Refutation,</HI>
for that and other Reasons I shall pass it over.
But he tells us now, he can make many more,
which <HI>A.</HI> P's. Friends wou'd have difficulty
to answer. Is not this a Singular piece of
Civility in <HI>C. O.?</HI> He! tender Hearted <HI>Gentle∣man!</HI>
Out of Meer Mercy and Compassion
will not expose <HI>A.</HI> P. So good natur'd, Civil
and Modest a Creature I never saw before.
Oh, but <HI>Well condition'd Charles Oliphant</HI>
do not restrain your self so much, it may do
you harm; Even wreck your <HI>Spleen</HI> a little,
especially when <HI>A.</HI> P. and his Friends dare
you to do it.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="44"/>
These who are not acquainted with A. P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Dissertations,</HI> by these Malicious Insinuatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of <HI>C. O</HI>'s. might suspect there were some <HI>Per∣nicious
Doctrines</HI> conceal'd in them which <HI>C.
O.</HI> threaten'd to display to the World; But
to show you how Impudent a thing this <HI>Refur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>
is, I challenge him to make good these Brags
and Insinuations. In the Name of Nonsense
fall on (<HI>C. O.</HI>) and spare not; Let us have a
tryall of yours kill here; Spew out all your
Venome, A. P. and his Friends defy you;
And if they have any Difficulty in answering
you on this Head, you shall gain the whole
Cause in debate. I'm sure three of the
<HI>Greatest Men</HI> of the CHURCH of ENG∣LAND,
(I mean Bp. <HI>Wilkins,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hooper
Dean of Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>the most ingenious</HI>
Mr. <HI>John Craig</HI>) have all said the same
things more Explicitly and distinctly; And
if these three be not a Match for <HI>YOU</HI> &amp; your
LATINE &amp; ENGLISH INTERPRETERS,
I dispain of ever seing you march'd.</P>
<P>VI. Next, C. O. is hugely displeased with
A. P. because he has broughta <HI>Demonstrati∣on</HI>
for the <HI>Existence</HI> of a <HI>Deity,</HI> from the Im∣possibility
of the <HI>Mechanical</HI> Production of
<HI>Animals,</HI> and alledges the proof is not Good,
because he Imagins A. P. infers from it only,
that the <HI>Origine</HI> of the <HI>Faetus</HI> is derived from
<PB N="32" REF="45"/>
the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</HI> and not from the <HI>Female:</HI> I have
given Several Instances already, how little
C. O. is able to distinguish betwixt things;
The Reason of which is, that he is not capable
of entring into the Inward Nature of the
Matters he speaks about: Like a true <HI>Quack</HI>
he keeps you at a great distance from the
point, defends himself with long <HI>Weapons,</HI>
and endeavours to secure from Blundering, by
General Terms. He thought it a little in∣convenient
to go directly to Work, and fall
a combating Arguments for the <HI>Existence</HI> of
a <HI>Deity,</HI> and therefore he takes a consequence
to A. P's <HI>Demonstration,</HI> which he thinks
False, and wou'd have his Reader conclude
the <HI>Proposition</HI> False; upon the account of
the Imaginary Falsehood of the <HI>Corollary.</HI>
But I tell you <HI>Charles Oliphant,</HI> and look to't;
If an <HI>Animal</HI> can not be produc'd <HI>Mechani∣cally,</HI>
there must be a <HI>Supreme Being</HI> who
did some Time or other creat the same, and
that whither the Origine of the <HI>Faetus</HI> be de∣riv'd
from the <HI>Male</HI> or from the <HI>Female.</HI> It
is true, from the Consideration that the
Works of <HI>Creation</HI> are now ceas'd, and that
an Animal cou'd be produc'd by no Laws
of <HI>Mechanism,</HI> and some other <HI>Appearan∣ces</HI>
of <HI>Nature</HI> that can no other ways be ac∣counted
for, <HI>A. P.</HI> might infer that the
<PB N="33" REF="46"/>
Origin of the <HI>Faetus</HI> proceeded rather from
the <HI>Male</HI> than the <HI>Female;</HI> But this Inference
does noways influence the <HI>Demonstration</HI> of
the <HI>Existenoe</HI> of a <HI>Deity</HI> from the <HI>Immecha∣nical</HI>
Production of <HI>Animals:</HI> For let that
be how it will, Yet this is true and necessar∣ly
follows from his Reasoning. Ay, but says
<HI>C. O.</HI> very learn'dly, the Seeds of <HI>Plants</HI> are
certainly little <HI>Plants,</HI> and they can be pro∣duc'd
<HI>Mechanically</HI> no more, than the most
perfect Animal; And therefore the <HI>Herb∣Woman</HI>
and her <HI>Salladine</HI> are of the same o∣riginal:
I grant it, and where is the Hazard?
Every Individual Animal (as I have afore∣said)
even the least <HI>Insect</HI> and <HI>Plant</HI> requires
to its Production infinite Power and Wis∣dom,
and the most perfect Creature can re∣quire
no more.</P>
<P>I cou'd here show the Impossibility of the
<HI>Mechanical</HI> Production of <HI>Animals,</HI> from se∣veral
other Topicks, besides that adduc'd by
<HI>A. P.</HI> As likeways (from the nature of ma∣terial
Organs; the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Motion</HI> and the
Structure of living Creatures) that there
must be something in the World above the
Power of <HI>Matter;</HI> But these I refer to a
more glorious Work, than that of exposing
<HI>C. O</HI>'s Frailties: No honest Man wou'd lay
out his Pains in confuting any of the several
<PB N="34" REF="47"/>
ways of <HI>Demonstrating</HI> the Being of a <HI>GOD;</HI>
The more they are, the better; For some are
to be wrought upon one way; o hers ano∣ther.</P>
<P>But says <HI>C. O. Malbranch</HI> and <HI>Bellini</HI> have
both of 'em <HI>Demonstrated</HI> the <HI>Immechanical</HI>
Production of <HI>Animals.</HI> It is very hard C.
<HI>O.</HI> shou'd take the Liberty of saying what
he pleases without any <HI>Avoucher, Malbranch</HI>
has barely mention'd the thing, but you can
no more find a <HI>Demonstration</HI> thereof in his
Works, than in <HI>C. O</HI>'s elaborat <HI>Pamphlets:</HI>
And as for <HI>Bellini.</HI> if we may gather his O∣pinion
from his writings, it wou'd seem he
were of another Mind; for he endeavours to
account for the <HI>Motion of the Heart,</HI> the
<HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Blood,</HI> and the Forma∣tion
of the Principal parts of an <HI>Animal,</HI>
from the <HI>Data</HI> of a <HI>dissolving Fluid,</HI> and an
<HI>Elastick Canal;</HI> which (notwithstanding all
the ingenious things he has said on that Head)
will no more form a living Creature, than a
Bag full of melting Butter will produce an
<HI>Emperour.</HI> I come now to consider what he
has to say against <HI>A. P</HI>'s asserting the <HI>Ori∣gin</HI>
of the <HI>Faetus</HI> to be deriv'd from the Male.</P>
<P>Says <HI>C. O.</HI> the Seed of <HI>Plant-animals</HI> is
not<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deriv'd from a Male, and therefore this
Assertion of <HI>A. P</HI>'s is false. There is for
<PB N="35" REF="48"/>
you now. The seed of <HI>Plant-animals</HI> is not
deriv'd from a Male, and Therefore &amp;c. I
shou'd not have taken notice of such an Ob∣jection
as this, but that he repeats it over
again in the <HI>Refutation:</HI> Did ever any one
seriously assert, that there were Distinctions
of <HI>Sexes</HI> in Plants? Does not ev'ry body know,
if an external Injury, a Wound, an improper
Soil or Climate, a chilling constant Blast, a
rotting Fall of Rain, Old Age or some such
cause does not occasion Battenness, that ev'∣ry
Plant duly cultivated will bear Seed? If
I shou'd say that evry Plant is a Male, and
the Earth or at least a convenient Bed therein,
is the Mother or Female, I shou'd be guilty
of a less <HI>Solecism,</HI> than <HI>C. O.</HI> But all such
Language is meer <HI>Metaphor,</HI> and nothing is
to be concluded thence. But, say <HI>C. O.</HI> Na∣ture
works uniformly and after the same <HI>con∣stant
Tenor.</HI> And who denys it? This <HI>U∣niformity</HI>
is not in the least infring'd by our
<HI>Position,</HI> no more than it is in that some.
Animals are <HI>Oviparous</HI> others <HI>Viviparous;</HI>
the true universal Uniformity consisting nei∣ther
in that the Origin of the <HI>Faetus</HI> is in the
Male, nor that it is in the <HI>Female,</HI> But that all
Animals of whatsoever Kind are deriv'd
from a preexistent <HI>Animalcul</HI> of the same
<HI>Species.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="49"/>
<HI>C. O.</HI> saw very well that if <HI>Lew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣hoeck's</HI>
Testimony were admitted, of his
havng constantly observed an Infinity of
<HI>Animalculs</HI> in the Male-seed of all the Crea∣tures
he had occasion to examin, this wou'd
be an <HI>Ocular Demonstration</HI> of <HI>A. P</HI>'s Infe∣rence;
He therefore absolutly denys the
Matter of fact, and resolves the whole into
a meer <HI>Deceptio visus;</HI> It being no other
(says he) <HI>Quam particularum liquoris se∣mina<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s

can suppose him capable of a meaning) that
the Seed of all Animals being a frothy Sub∣stance,
when it is expos'd to the Air, the
imprisoned <HI>Aura elastica</HI> requiring more
Room, breaks its Slender Prison and evapo∣rats,
by which the true Liquor runs into its
proper Substance, as Yest turns into Ale;
and that this running of the rarified Liquid
presents to the Observer the Appearance of
moving <HI>Animaleuls:</HI> But <HI>C. O.</HI> knows not
that the most Tenacious Frothy Liqours
when expos'd to the Air, will dissolve into
their proper Substance in a few Hours; after
which there can be no Motion in their Parts
but a common one (all <HI>Intestine</HI> Motion
commonly ascrib'd to the Parts of Fluids be∣ing
contradictory to their Natures) and
<PB N="37" REF="50"/>
that Lew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enhoeck had observ'd these <HI>Animal∣culs</HI>
moving and living in Seed which had
been preserv'd 8 Days, after which no such
Appearance did present it self, as himself
informs us <HI>Pag.</HI> 144. <HI>of his first Vol. of Let∣ters.</HI>
Besides, Is it not a tolerable Degree of
Assurance in an Obscure Person, who per∣haps
never saw a Good <HI>Microscope</HI> in his
Life, who neither understands their Use,
their Structure nor the way of Managing 'em,
to contradict the Senses of a Number of men
of undoubted Probity and singular Capacity;
who have all asserted the same thing, have
represented their <HI>Figures</HI> and describ'd their
Motions. Not only has <HI>Lewvenhoeck</HI> said
it again and again in his Two Volums of
Letters, But he has shown these <HI>Animalculs</HI>
to several of his Friends, and convinc'd those
who absolutly disbeliev'd the Matter, and
has obtain'd the Approbation of some of the
nicest Judgement and severest Honesty, and
particularly of some of the Members of the
<HI>Royal Society</HI> at <HI>London. Hartsoeker</HI> likewise
had told the same thing 20 years ago, in the
<HI>Journal des Scavans</HI> of 1678. and has since
enlarg'd the Matter in his <HI>Essai de Dioptri∣que,</HI>
pag. 227. And indeed he was the first
who hit upon the Observation, and com∣municated
it to <HI>Malbranch</HI> some Time af∣terwards.
<PB N="38" REF="51"/>
Besides these, if one will examin
the <HI>Philosophical Transactions; Memoirs de
Academie Royal,</HI> the <HI>Acta Lipsiae,</HI> &amp; <HI>Journal
des Scavans</HI> he will find Multitudes con∣firming
it: Aud I cou'd get <HI>C. O.</HI> the Testi∣mony
of Half a Dozen of Gentlemen of Un∣questioned
Veracity, who have beheld and
seen these <HI>Animalculs</HI> with their own Eyes.
It is a great Misfortune to be engag'd with
one incapable of Shame, who will deny a
Matter of Fact, or <HI>Proposition</HI> of <HI>Euclide,</HI>
if they make against him, with the same
Indifference others will a Contradiction. It
is impossible to bind <HI>C. O.</HI> with any thing
but Cords. His next Difficulty is how these
<HI>Animalculs</HI> can get to the <HI>Ovary.</HI> But 1. I
wou'd gladly know who told him that they
must get thither; <HI>Lewvenhoeck,</HI> who first
broach'd this <HI>Heresy,</HI> was of Opinion that
the <HI>Ovary</HI> of the Female, as such, contribu∣ted
as little towards the Generation of the
<HI>Faetus,</HI> as the Breasts and Niples of the Male
did towards their Nutrition. And 2. I shou'd
think that a Living and Moving Animal,
which cou'd turn and wind a thousand dif∣ferent
Ways, cou'd as readily get thither, as
<HI>D. O's</HI> Fecundating <HI>Aura,</HI> which is deter∣min'd
One Way. But 3. the true Answer
seems to ly in the Infinit Number of these
<PB N="39" REF="52"/>
<HI>Animalculs;</HI> There must be some one Place
of difficult Access, where one or more of
these little Creatures (according to the Na∣ture
of the Parents) being lodg'd, may be
accommodated with the Necessaries of <HI>Nu∣trition:</HI>
So that that Case runs thus, If
from a certain Point there passed ten Thou.
and Different Roads, one only of which led
to a Certain Place of <HI>Accommodation;</HI> and if
from this Point, there parted ten Thousand
Different Travellers, evry one pursuing a
Different Road; The desired Place wou'd as
infallibly be found out among 'em All, as if
there were but only one Patent Road and
one single Traveller. Just so, the Number of
these Little Creatures seen s design'd by the
Wisdom of <HI>Almighty GOD,</HI> to answer the
Multiplicity of their Possible <HI>Deviations.</HI>
Next, <HI>C. O.</HI> alledges <HI>Malpighi</HI> had observed
the <HI>Rudiments</HI> of an <HI>Animal</HI> in a Wind-egg.
But all I can find in his whole Works, which
can any ways favour him, is in these Words;
In the second Page of his Observations <HI>De
formatione pulli,</HI> says he, <HI>Placebat etiam sub∣ventanea
ova lustrando cicatriculam intueri,
quae utplurimum minima erat, &amp; licet vari∣am
sortiretur circumscriptionem, frequentius
tamen delineatam A.</HI> (where he has a con∣fus'd
Scheme, which one can make nothing
<PB N="40" REF="53"/>
of) <HI>prae se ferebat figuram, non longe d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tro
globosum condidumque corpus, quase mote
locabatur quod laceratum nullum pecudiare
corpus exhibeat a se diversum</HI> &amp;c. Thus you
see how diffidently <HI>Malpighi</HI> speaks of the
Matter. And it is observable. That in his
repeated and amended Observations (which
are the only Ones we ought to trust to) he
never so much as mentions the Matter. If <HI>C.
O.</HI> can adduce any Quotation more pertinent
to his Purpose, I desire him to point the
Page in his Next; for men are not obliged to
read over <HI>Volumes</HI> to discover his Meaning:
But I am not much affraid he can bring out
of him or any other credible Author, any
thing positively confirming his Opinion.
Nor indeed can the Matter bear it without a
great deal of Caution: For it is almost Im∣possible
to be certain, if the Female, whose
egg you examin, has not been (some short
time before) troden by the Male! Besides
that it is hard to manage the <HI>Cicatricula</HI> so
as to be sure not to be deceiv'd. Before <HI>C.
O.</HI> medles any further with <HI>Malpighi,</HI> I'd
advise him to read his <HI>posthumus</HI> Works,
where he will find his own <HI>Character</HI> in him,
who wrote a Letter against <HI>Malpighi,</HI> intitu∣led
<HI>De recentiorum Medicorum studiis,</HI> to
much the same Good Purpose he has scribled
against <HI>A. P.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="54"/>
If <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vey</HI> did not discover any Remains
of the Male after Copulation, in those Ani∣mals
he examin'd, others have, particularly
<HI>Lewvenhoeck,</HI> as may be seen in his Letters,
and in the <HI>Transactions;</HI> Where he tells us
not only of his having discovered these <HI>Ani∣malculs</HI>
in the <HI>Uterus</HI> and in the <HI>Tubae Fallo∣pianae,</HI>
but describes their first Degree of
<HI>Transformation.</HI> As for <HI>C. O's</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
it is much the same with his <HI>difficiliora</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>,
(<HI>Tarrugo's</HI> Old Way of <HI>Tau∣tologizing</HI>)
to inform those whom he and
his <HI>Translator</HI> have not Occasion to tell, by
Word of Mouth, that they presume to read
Greek, of which there are here so many
shrewd Proofs. Having thus answered all
<HI>C. O</HI>'s Objections against <HI>A.</HI> P's Opinion, I
come now to adduce Two or Three Positive
<HI>Arguments</HI> that seem to conclude, that this
must needs be the Manner of <HI>Generation.</HI> 1.
Supposing there have been discovered <HI>Ani∣malculs</HI>
in the <HI>Male-Seed,</HI> I wou'd ask <HI>C. O.</HI>
what he thinks to be their Use; Why shou d
Nature have furnish'd it with different Ani∣mals,
and not rather with those design'd to
be the Origin of the <HI>Faetus,</HI> since the Lat∣ter
was as easily to be done as the Former?
This looks a little suspiciously, as if Nature
did not bring about its Effects after the most
<PB N="42" REF="55"/>
plain and simple Manner: If there have been
<HI>Animalculs</HI> discover'd (as most certainly
there have) in all the <HI>Male-Seeds</HI> hitherto
examin'd, then as certainly they have been
design'd for the Production of the <HI>Species:</HI>
No other possible Use of 'em being to be as∣signed.
2. It is utterly impossible to account
for <HI>Monstruous</HI> Births, Why some are double,
being joyn'd by the Backs or Bellies, others
are deficient or aboundant in some <HI>Organs,</HI>
without this supposition. 3. Is it not very
ridiculous to think that the Female, which
is the inferior &amp; weaker Sex, shou'd contri∣bute
the chief, nay almost the only Part to
the <HI>Production</HI> of the <HI>Species,</HI> and the Mal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
come in only as a <HI>Hatcher:</HI> This is not lik<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the doings of Nature, who always proporti∣ons
her Effects to the Powers of the Agent
4 Lastly, Upon this Supposition, the <HI>Uni∣formity</HI>
and <HI>Harmony</HI> of the Works of <HI>Crea∣tion</HI>
is maintain'd, and the Dignity of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Male Sex preserv'd; And one might as we
say the Female might ingender without th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Concurrence of the Male, as that the Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣gin
of the <HI>Faetus is</HI> lodg'd in her. The whol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Mystery of <HI>Generation</HI> may be briefly summ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
up in these particulars.</P>
<P>1. That all Animals of what kind soeve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
were originaly and actualy created at on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="43" REF="56"/>
by the Hand of <HI>Almighty GOD;</HI> It being
impossible to account for their Production
from any Laws of <HI>Mechanism.</HI></P>
<P>2. That every <HI>Individual Animal</HI> has, <HI>in
minimis,</HI> actualy included in its Loins, all
those who shall descend of it; And ev'ry one
of these again, have all their offspring actu∣ally
lodg'd in their Loins, and so on <HI>in infi∣nitum;</HI>
Ev'ry <HI>Animal</HI> whether generated or
not, comprehended in its Loins, all that shall
ever descend of it.</P>
<P>3. That not only the Organs and Solid
Parts of all these <HI>Animals</HI> were distinctly
form'd by the Hand of Almighty God at the
Creation, But that at all Times since, their
Fluids have mov'd, and their Blood, or that
which is <HI>Analegous</HI> thereunto, has circulated;
Tho' both these be with some little Diffe∣rence
from what they are in a perfect <HI>Animal;</HI>
In a word, the last of the Race of <HI>Adam</HI> that
shall be, was actualy included in his Loins,
when <HI>Adam</HI> was created, had his solid parts
there distinctly form'd, and his <HI>Fluids</HI> con∣stantly
moving, and has been ever since the
<HI>Creation</HI> dayly augmen ing and growing in
Maturity. And there will be no difficulty
for him to conceive this, who understands
that both above and below any given Quanti∣ty,
there may be assign'd another <HI>similar</HI> Quan∣tity
<PB N="44" REF="57"/>
in any given <HI>Proportion;</HI> and consequent∣ly
that there may be conceiv'd an <HI>Infinit
Number</HI> of <HI>similar Animalculs</HI> descending or
lessening from any giv'n Animal, how small
so ever; And so all these Infinite Numbers
of <HI>Animalculs</HI> might be lodg'd in the Bigness
of a Pin's Head. As likewise that all these
<HI>Animalculs</HI> Fluids may actually move, tho'
perhaps only with a <HI>Velocity</HI> proportional to
their several Bulks. This needs no further
Explication.</P>
<P>4. That some of the Solid Parts of these
<HI>Animalculs</HI> are as it were folded and wrap'd
up in <HI>Plaits,</HI> and these Foldings are wrap'd to∣gether
by surrounding Membranes, which in
process of Time are rent and torn, by the en∣creas'd
Force of the Fluid and Augmentation
of the Solid Parts; As is commonly observ'd
in the Transformation of all Infects: And
that the <HI>Nervous Fibres</HI> are capable
only of a determin'd Degree of Tension,
without losing their <HI>Elastick</HI> Power of
bursting; which Degree of <HI>Tension</HI> answers
commonly to the Utual Dimensions and bulk
of the <HI>Species</HI> of the Animal. And this <HI>Pro∣position</HI>
rightly understood, will account for
the determin'd Stature which all <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> of the same <HI>Species</HI> commonly
reach; as likeways the Necessity of Natural
<PB N="45" REF="58"/>
Death and Declining Age, together with
some other uncommon Appearances.</P>
<P>5. That these <HI>Animalculs</HI> are all included
in the Male, till the act of <HI>Copulation;</HI> as be∣ing
the Nobler Sex, whose greater Warmth,
brisker Motion of Blood &amp; closer Texture of
Organs, seems more fitted for preserving 'em.</P>
<P>6. That the Female supplys only a conve∣nient
Habitation, a Fatter Soil and a Fitter
<HI>Pasturage,</HI> for their more sudden Growth, and
for hastening 'em to their determin'd Dimen∣sions.
That they encreise so slowly before
<HI>Copulation</HI> and so quickly after, will be no
Wonder to him, who confiders the slow Mo∣tion
of their Blood, and their small Bulk
then; and that the Differences of <HI>Cubical
Numbers</HI> (according to which the encrease
of the Bulk of Animals is) have a much less
<HI>Ratio</HI> one to another, when their <HI>Roots</HI> are
small, than they have when the <HI>Roots</HI> are con∣siderably
greater.</P>
<P>7. That this convenient <HI>Habitation</HI> in the
Female (the <HI>Animalcul</HI> having suffered per∣haps
several Transformations e're it get thi∣ther,
such perchance as have been observ'd
in the Generation of <HI>Infects</HI>) is most pro∣bably,
where the Extremities of the <HI>Canals</HI>
of the <HI>Placenta Uterina,</HI> may agglutinat
with the Mouths of the Secretories of some
<PB N="46" REF="59"/>
peculiar Glands in the <HI>Uterus;</HI> so that there∣by
some convenient <HI>Fluid</HI> may be immitted
with some force into the <HI>Canals</HI> of the <HI>Faetus.</HI>
This the Heat of the Sun supplys in Plants
and some <HI>Oviparous Animals,</HI> dissolving a
glutinous Substance and imparting a Motion
to its <HI>Fluid,</HI> whereby it is forced with some
velocity into the Orifices of the Root or
Navel-string Vessels.</P>
<P>8. That by this conveyance of the Fe∣males
Fluids into the Canals of the <HI>Faetus,</HI>
its Solid parts are encreas'd, and the Motion
of its Fluids by the Manner of Nutrition I
formerly explain-d, till it grow of such Di∣mensions,
as not to be contain'd in the <HI>Ute∣rus</HI>
any longer, and till the Force and Power
of its <HI>Struglings,</HI> be too great for the Resist∣ence
of the Involving <HI>Membrane,</HI> whereof
being disentangled, it makes its Way, thro'
the (thereby) patent Orifice of the <HI>Uterus</HI> &amp;
then by known Methods it is thrust out.</P>
<P>This is at least notan unprobable Account
of the Manner of the Production of <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and I was content to let this
rude <HI>Specimen</HI> thereof appear in this place,
to convince the Reader, that the Matter
might be (as himself complains) and for
ever wou'd be a <HI>Mystery</HI> to <HI>C. O.</HI> yet it was
not altogether so to others. The particular
<PB N="47" REF="60"/>
<HI>Illustration</HI> and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of this Doctrine,
as likeways the many useful <HI>Corrollaries</HI>
thence to be deduc'd, I leave to a fitter occa∣sion,
when perhaps I shall explain mechani∣cally
the whole <HI>Animal OEconomy.</HI></P>
<P>VII. Next <HI>C. O.</HI> falls foul of <HI>A. P.</HI> be∣cause
he explains the Effects of <HI>Anodynes</HI>
and the cause of <HI>Sleepy Distempers</HI> from the
<HI>Distension</HI> of the small <HI>Arteries,</HI> and their
Action upon the <HI>Nervous Fibres</HI> of the Brain;
and alledges this Notion is likeways slolen
from <HI>Bellini.</HI> Such a way of talking without
Fear or Shame, wou'd almost make one lose
his Temper: <HI>Bellini</HI> indeed has pretty natu∣rally
explain'd the Diseases of the Head,
But he has no where considered the Manner
of the Operation of particular Medicines. It is
strange to see one of so high <HI>Pretensions</HI> so
sleep in their <HI>Apprehension,</HI> as not to be able to
distinguish betwixt the Cause and the Effect.
<HI>Bellini,</HI> upon supposition the small <HI>Arteries</HI>
of the Brain were distended by whatever
Cause, did show what Effects wou'd follow
upon it; A. P. on the other Hand, shows
that the Nature of <HI>Opium</HI> and other <HI>Ano∣dynés</HI>
is such, as to produce a <HI>Rarification</HI> and
a greater <HI>Velocity</HI> in the Blood, which must
distend the <HI>Arteries.</HI> Are not these two dif∣ferent,
and can there be any thing in the lat∣ter
<PB N="48" REF="61"/>
stolen from the former? <HI>C. O.</HI> here runs
on his ordinary Course, makes a <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her</HI>
with a Quotation out of <HI>Bellini,</HI> which is no
more to his Purpose, than one out of <HI>Apollo
Mathematicus.</HI> He complains A. P. has
maim'd and strait'ned <HI>Bellini</HI>'s Doctrine about
the ways of stoping the <HI>Influx</HI> of the Ani∣mal
Spirits into the <HI>Muscles;</HI> None of which
A. P. was any ways concern'd about, but
that arising from the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifaction</HI> and <HI>Velocity</HI>
of the Blood, which he has duly considered.
But to let the World see, what a happy Turn
of Head he himself has at <HI>Philosophie, C. O.</HI>
is pleas'd to communicat his own Explicati∣on
of Natural Sleep. Sleep says he (hear
him) is an Unbending of the <HI>Fibres</HI> of these
<HI>Muscles,</HI> which have a continual Strugle
with their <HI>Antagonists.</HI> Dr. J. is in the
wrong to accuse him of having borrow'd
this Notion; It is an Original, and was never
broach'd by any but himself. For 1. it sup∣poses
there may be some Muscles without
Antagonists or something equivalent there∣unto,
which I am sure never any one dream'd,
who understood any thing of <HI>Muscular Mo∣tion</HI>
or of the <HI>Animal oeconomy;</HI> for without
an <HI>Antagonist</HI> or something equivalent there∣unto,
if a Muscle were once contracted, it
shou'd still continue so. a. At best this
<PB N="49" REF="62"/>
Explication points only at an Effect and not
the Formal Cause of Sleep; For supposing this,
we still want to know the Cause of this Re∣laxation
of the <HI>Muscular Fibres:</HI> And that
this even in the soundest Acceptation is only
one <HI>Concomitant</HI> of Natural Sleep, is evident
to him, who considers, that some Animals
will ly in a careless unactive Posture for some
Weeks, nay Months, without so much as a
<HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p.</HI> 3. We know that there are some Ani∣mals,
which will move all their <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scles</HI> as
violently when asleep as awake, as Night∣walkers
and those who talk in their Sleep;
which intirely overthrows this Fine Piece of
Philosophie. 4. The easiest Posture for the
Members, and that which occasions the least
Expense of Animal Spirits, is the Mean be∣twixt
Extreme Contraction and Expansion,
And this only requires an <HI>Equilibrium</HI> be∣twixt
the <HI>Muscle</HI> and its <HI>Antagonist,</HI> and
not an intire Relaxation; for as long as the
Animal lives, there can not be an absolute
and intire Relaxation even of the Voluntary
Muscles; for then the <HI>Circulation</HI> through
such Muscles wou'd be altogether stop'd;
And if all <HI>C. O</HI>'s Muscles h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t have Antago∣nists
were intirely relax'd, I shou'd despa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of
ever seeing a Reply to these Papers, for
they say, <HI>Mortui non mordent,</HI> and I am sure
<PB N="50" REF="63"/>
he wou'd leave none behind him, who wou'd
undertake his Defence in such a Cause.
Thus you see what an Old dog <HI>C. O.</HI> is at
<HI>Philosophie,</HI> and were it not a great Pity
that all others shou'd not be silenc'd, that
he alone might have liberty to inform the
World?</P>
<P>VIII. In the Last Place he <HI>Attacques A.
P</HI>'s <HI>Dissertation</HI> about the Cure of Fevers,
and very wisely imagins, that because in
proposing the <HI>Problem. A. P.</HI> says, <HI>Si ulla
evacuatio foret eligenda,</HI> he therefore doubted
if any <HI>Evacuation</HI> was proper in Acute Fe∣vers;
tho' his only design was to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermin
the fittest <HI>Evacuation.</HI> I have before observ∣ed
that this is the very Language in which
all <HI>Problems</HI> ought to be proposed, that they
may include all possible Cases, and exclude
all Possible Cavil. <HI>A P.</HI> knew very
well, that in some Sorts of <HI>Fevers viz.</HI> Slow
consumptive ones, Evacuations often did
Hurt in stead of doing Good, and therefore to
remove all Occasions of Mistake, he adds this
Limitation, to confine the general word <HI>Fe∣vers,</HI>
to Acute ones: He shows here that
any Fluid may be secern'd by any <HI>Gland,</HI>
and that the <HI>Evacuations</HI> by <HI>Perspiration</HI> are
greater than by all the others put together,
which is the only thing he undertook to de∣monstrat;
which he has so far perform'd,
<PB N="51" REF="64"/>
that in my Humble Opinion, this is not
the least Accurate <HI>Dissertation</HI> in his whole
Works. But this whole Affair is so plainly
and fully laid down according to <HI>A. P</HI>'s
Mind, in the <HI>New Theory of Fevers,</HI> that
having now at large answered ev'ry thing
that looks like an Objection (except his
Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling and calling Names) in his refin'd
Pieces, I shall in a Few Words (being alto∣gether
weary of so inglorious and unpleasant
a Labour) examin what he has to say against
that <HI>Treatise.</HI></P>
<P>I have told the World before, that the
Principal Inducement I had to publish any
thing on such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, was a Concern for the
Honour and Reputation of my Countrey,
having seen a good Cause so pitifully bung∣led
by a <HI>Fluttring Pretender:</HI> His Insolence
and Indiscretion both in Privat and Publick,
made me afterwards point out the <HI>Jack-daw,</HI>
not by his Name but by a Part of his <HI>inde∣lible
Character.</HI> Those who know under
what Disadvantages and in what Haste that
Treatise was pen'd, will easily pardon its
Failings; such as they are <HI>C. O.</HI> is neither
capable of mending nor discovering, for it
was not for such Men I wrote; It had been
unintelligible to him, had it been set off with
all the Finery of <HI>Eloquence;</HI> which neither
<PB N="52" REF="65"/>
cou'd the Matter <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, nor my Occasions fur∣nish
me with; <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nari res <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>psa negat contenta
doceri.</HI> Notwithstanding I had told all this
in the Preface, he most ingloriously falls up∣on
the Language, not daring to venture his
<HI>Teeth</HI> upon the Matter, it being too hard for
them: If my Friends here (who are Com∣petent
Judges) do not Flatter me too much,
the Language is fitted well enough for the
Matter, which is all that can be done in such
an Affair; And as <HI>Bellini</HI> has it, He only <HI>di∣cend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

If that will do him any service. I will
give him up the Language, for him and his

It has met with much Better Reception, than
I cou'd either promise or expect, or than
such things usually get. I had in the first <HI>Edi∣tion</HI>
thereof told that it was indifferent to
me what became of it, since I neither resol∣ved
to found my Reputation nor Quiet upon
the fortune of such <HI>Performances.</HI> But since
it has been kindly receiv'd by some of the
best Judges, and since I know that the Whole
is Demonstrable Truth, If I have Leisure to goe
that Way, I shall put all the Matters con∣tain'd
therein in such a Light, as shall intire∣ly
satisfie all those who understand the few

I shou'd not so much as offer to justifie
that Treatise from so Weak Accusations as
<HI>C. O.</HI> has brought against it, were it not for
the satisfaction of those who have not Leisure,
or will not give themselves the Trouble to
look into those Authors, from whom he has
accus'd me of filching. It is still the same
Objection, The <HI>New Theory of Fevers</HI> is
wholly stoln from <HI>Borelli</HI> aud <HI>Bellini.</HI> Every
body ought to speak discreetly of these great
men who have deserv'd so very well of Me∣dicine,
Yet it is certain as to the present Sub∣ject
of Debate, they had Opinions different
from one another, so that one of them at
least must be in the wrong, and consequently I
cou'd not have stoln the same Doctrine from
'em both. <HI>Borelli's</HI> Opinion is plain from 227
<HI>Prop.</HI> of his Second Part <HI>viz.</HI> that the prin∣cipal
cause of Acute Fevers is the <HI>Succus
nerveus fermentatus &amp; acredine affectus;</HI>
and again <HI>Animadverto quod succi ilii destina∣ti

facile degenerare possunt fermentatione in ali∣enam
naturam animali noxiam</HI> &amp;c. And again
<HI>Quae excerni debuerant é nervis</HI> &amp;c. From
which and from his whole Discourse on this
Head it is evident, that an Acidity (by what
ever Manner acquir'd and) communicated
to the <HI>Nervous juice,</HI> and there by produ∣cing
a Frequent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulse (which he falsely
thought the Distinguishing <HI>Symptom</HI> of a Fe∣ver,
and that upon which the rest depended)
was in his Opinion the main and principal
Cause of Acute Fevers: He likeways expres∣ly
declares, that the Blood has no part in
the Production of the Fatal Distemper, which
is not only false but directly contrary to my
Doctrine, which lays the whole Stress of the
Affair, on the <HI>Arterial Fluid:</HI> And if these
two be not different I leave the Reader to
judge. As to <HI>Bellini,</HI> he was indeed a little
nearer the matter, having had Occasion to
observe where and why <HI>Borelli</HI> fail'd; But
then his Doctrine is so general, that it will
apply to any Distemper whose Cause is in∣ternal,
as well as to a Fever. It is evident
from his whole Discourse on this Subject,
that he was affraid of venturing too far; he
<PB N="55" REF="68"/>
dar'd not trust him self with assigning either
the immediat Cause, Subject or Place, where
this Mischief had its Rise: He is extremly
cautious here, and delivers general <HI>Theorems,</HI>
which indeed are true, but do not come close
to the Point. Says he <HI>Prop.</HI> 35. De Febri∣bus;
<HI>Febris est vitium sangusnis aut in motu,
aut in quantitate, aut in qualitate ejus, aut
in harum aliquibus aut in omnibus</HI> (which
is the sum of his Whole Doctrine on the Head,
as himself hath compendis'd it) and so in∣deed
is ev'ry Distemper whoseCause is inter∣nal;
But he no where says, that The Gene∣ral
and most Effectual Cause of all Fevers,
is the <HI>Obstruction</HI> or <HI>Dilatation</HI> of the <HI>Glands.
Vide</HI> Page 11. <HI>New Theory of Fevers.</HI> Be∣sides,
neither <HI>Borelli</HI> nor <HI>Bellini</HI> (perhaps at
that time) understood the true Structure of
the Glands, nor the <HI>adequate</HI> Nature of the
Circulation of the Blood in its full Extent,
upon which the <HI>New Theory</HI> is built. I told
in the <HI>Preface</HI> of that Book, that I made use
of <HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini</HI> and other Authors like∣ways,
where they made for my purpose;
And shou'd have used <HI>C. O</HI>'s Noble Works
so too, If I had found any thing in them for
my Design, that wou'd have endur'd Repeti∣tion.
<HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini</HI>'s Works are <HI>standard</HI>
Books, and men who reason in <HI>Medicine</HI> af∣ter
<PB N="56" REF="69"/>
them, must use them as the text. But I defy <HI>C.
O.</HI> or any one for him, to show any where I have
borrow'd any Principal Proposition from them, and
have not mention'd it: There is in that <HI>Treatise,</HI> as
short as it is, <HI>Materials</HI> for a Work as big as either
<HI>Borelli</HI>'s or <HI>Bellini</HI>'s Book; And if some few of the No∣tions
may have been hinted before, the improvements
are all new, and I doubt ev'ry Single Sentence of
will be so to <HI>C. O.</HI> all his life.</P>
<P>Thus I think I have fairly made out in the gener<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
That true <HI>Mechanical Theories</HI> in <HI>Medicine</HI> are Sever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

the infinit Wisdom of G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Works of the <HI>Creati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI>
And that without such, Physicians must be often at a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<HI>Ingenious</HI> and honest <HI>Practitioners:</HI> I have likeways made
out that <HI>A. P</HI>'s Performances are highly serviceable,
both in the Theory and Practice of <HI>Medicine;</HI> and that
they are in the Main both new, just and his own; That
the <HI>New Theory of Fevers</HI> is neither stoln from <HI>Borelli</HI>
nor <HI>Bellini,</HI> But that the Substance of it was before in∣tirely
unknown, and that there are many Improvements
of the formerly known Notions which I use; That <HI>C.
O.</HI> is an Ignorant Pretender, an Unjust Detractor and a
False Friend; And that his <HI>Translators</HI> are Incompetent
Judges and medling <HI>Coxcombs. Quae Erant Facienda.</HI></P>
